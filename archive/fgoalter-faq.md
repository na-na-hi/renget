### Guides
>How to transfer your account to a different phone:
1. Look at the guide below "How to run FGO on a phone and an emulator at the same time without using a transfer code"
	- This is by far the safest way to transfer an account because using the actual transfer code is incredibly risky. 
	- Transfering by code has been known to fail and many /alter/ bros have had to recover their account because of it. 
2. If you want to remove the original instance, just uninstall it. It will not affect the 2nd instance. 
	- Be sure that the 2nd instance works and that you can access the account, see your servants, etc.

>How to recover your account:

>How to automate FGO:
- [Fate/Grand Automata (Android)](https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA)

>How to create CE bombs:
1. Max Limit Break (MLB) a 1* CE
2. Put your CE XP + Fodder into this 1* CE, levelling it all the way to level 50
3. Feed 8 of these 1\* CEs into your target 5\* CE
	- Only need 4 for a target 4* CE
- There is a way to create CE bombs that is more QP efficient, however it takes a lot more time and clicks and therefore, is not recommended.

>How to run FGO on a phone and an emulator at the same time without using a transfer code:
1. Find this folder on your usual FGO instance:
	- [NA] `Storage/Android/data/com.aniplex.fategrandorder.en/files/data`
2. Locate these 4 files and copy them over to your target device or emulator. They start with:
	- `54cc`
	- `969b`
	- `644b`
	- `e1a9`
3. Install FGO. Open it and update the game data. Then close out of FGO.
4. Copy the above four files into the new FGO instance folder of the same name:
	- [NA] `Storage/Android/data/com.aniplex.fategrandorder.en/files/data`
5. Reopen up the target instance, click the "ID: Tap here to display" at the bottom and it should show your FC if done correctly.
