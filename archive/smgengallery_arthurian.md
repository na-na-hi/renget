 -> *{The separate names stem from the fact that the majority of the people literate enough to 'add' to Arthurian legend when it rose in popularity were from the upper class Norman (French) and continental nobility (compared to the generally more serious history-focused christfag monks), a general 'phase' of the legend's evolution known as the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate Cycles (which is where the women of the court were developed, as well as their dramas, and where lots of the christfag rewriting / inserts took place). If you wish to refer to her as Morgan le Fay - that's fine - but please be consistant and also refer to King Arthur as Roi Arthur (with appropriate French pronunciation of Arthur) ~~and yourself as pédé~~. Which you realistically won't, because we're speaking English, regarding a British 'Pantheon'. Honestly, 'Morgan le Fay' over 'Morgana' just comes off as psudeointellectual, even if it has risen in popularity in recent times}* <-

I mean, if you didn't twig he was poorly written OC, after the part where he was the "very first and most bravest and strongest knight of the round table" or the part where he "defeats the entire Round Table (of over 30 of the most elite named and unnamed knights in Britain), by himself, at once" or the part where "he's been fucking the King of Britain's wife right under his nose while being his bestest fren in the whole wide worl-.... look what I'm saying is that if I hadn't already made a Donutsteel the Edgehog joke elsewhere in this doc already, I'd use one for this guy}* <-
