##Q: Possible new Pikachu Monster?
![Detective Pikachu Corruption from Vinesauce](https://files.catbox.moe/oubi82.png)
>Hi, this is going to be my first post on this forum!
>I usually only lurk and see what kind of stuff you guys have seen and talk about since all of the stuff I've got to say would probably just repeat what other people have said.
>But for today, I think I've stumbled upon something that hasn't been seen yet.
>At least not reported here.
>It's not even that far away from where I live, it was downtown in Ryme City.
>I was walking on back home after a school day speaking to a friend.
>Just talking about some random stuff when he spotted something down an alleyway we walked past.
>He dragged me back to the front of the alley to get me to see it.
>Right at the very end of it was something that looked very similar to a Pikachu, probably would've just passed it off as one if my pal didn't notice the odd things about it.
>For one thing, it's face was covered by a bright mask of a normal Pikachu.
>Okay not exactly normal.
>It's face was blank.
>No expression.
>Just some blank, beady eyes and a small smile.
>And behind the mask was some dark patches where the cheek spots usually were.
>Looking back, that might've been its mouth.
>Its fur was a lot darker and tattered than a normal Pikachu's fur now that I'm thinking back, like it was an old Pikachu or something.
>And it never moved from its spot, it just stood there in place watching us.
>Whatever it was, it gave me the creeps.
>Not for my friend though, he was pretty set on catching this thing but I managed to get him to leave it alone for now.
>At the time I said it was because I was getting a stomach cramp but honestly, I just didn't want to go down there and meet it in case of trouble.
>It certainly wasn't coming to me.
>Anyways, just wanted to talk about this thing and see if anyone else knows about it.
>Especially because my friend wants to go back and catch it tomorrow

##Q:[GRAPHIC]Has anyone else seen the corpse trees in Eterna Forest?

>Okay I know that even for this forum, that title is going to be something a lot of you guys will shake your heads at but trust me.
>This is the real deal.
>Okay so I'll start off simple and then go off from there.
>Eterna Forest tends to be packed to the brim with trees right?
>You've only got a set path to walk through and if you stray off, you're more than likely to get lost within the trees.
>There was this old urban legend I read about recently where the reason that there's so many trees that people won't cut down is because they contain the souls of all of the people who've died within the forest.
>Thought it was some stupid folktale at first.
>But then I went off the beaten path.
>Couldn't help but satisfy that little seed of curisoity.
>So while I was walking through this place, I tried to keep my eye on each of the trees.
>See if any one of them had any signs of having some "soul" inside it or whatever the hell could be there.
>Eyes got tired after a while since y'know
>It was just trees.
>But just as soon as I turned back after a good 5 minutes of walking, I saw them.
>All of them.
>All of the trees I had passed had body parts in them.
>Some had skulls with funguses growing out of the eye sockets.
>Others had ribcages that had branches growing out of the bones.
>One of the furthest ones was fresh.
>Mostly rotted but I could see it was a little kid.
>His skin had turned garbage yellow and his body was breaking apart.
>Out of morbid curiosity I walked further to take a closer look.
>The eyes had sunken into the sockets and little mushrooms were growing out there, along with growing outside of his mouth which lacked a jaw.
>I was going to take a picture but then I heard some of the trees creaking.
>Shifting.
>Hauled ass out of there and never looked back.
>Doubt I'll ever go back there again.

## A: Spotted some weird thing hiding in Cerulean Cave.
![The Thing from Anonymous created with AI](https://files.catbox.moe/x63r68.png)

>There's always going to be some crazy rumours about this place, right?
>Having a history of being protected by guys who'd only let the best of the best in has lead to the average joe wondering what the hell could be inside it.
>The only concrete information that Trainers ever give is that the world's most powerful Pokemon resides in there.
>Plus some other stuff about it being a true challenge to people who think they're tough enough to handle the worst.
>With that said, I managed to get in.
>Had to sneak in at night when the guy guarding the cave was asleep but I was in there.
>Really hard to see in the dark though, had to bring a flashlight with me.
>Even with that, the place was dark enough for me to only see a couple feet in front of me.
>Place was practically coated in dust, couldn't walk a foot in front of me without getting a lungful of it.
>The only sound there was water dripping from the stalactites.
>Better than no sound at all I guess.
>But anyways, coming in at night made things pretty uneventful since most of the Pokemon were asleep.
>Keyword: most.
>Because after a little while of walking in the cave, I started to hear this gnashing sound.
>I crouched and moved over the sound slightly, thinking that I was going to get a cool picture of one of sighted Pokemon's eating habits or something like that.
>Instead, the dim flashlight I used only managed to see the back of this thing.
>Didn't know what it was eating but whatever it was, it was leaving a pool of blood.
>Had the stupid idea of trying to take a picture of it.
>Forgot I left the flash on.
>When it turned...well, you can see what I attached to know what it looked like staring at me.
>I ran as fast as I could out of there, I know it was chasing me.
>Only stopped when I got out of the cave.
>I'm never going back.
![The Creature from Anonymous, created by AI](https://files.catbox.moe/9mfin9.png) ![Mirage Tower Trainer, created by Me](https://files.catbox.moe/z2o2b5.png)
##Q: Have you seen that weird trainer within the Mirage Tower?

>Now I understand that the Mirage Tower in of itself is a strange rumour.
>Off within the desert by Route 111 there's this tower that comes and goes whenever it likes.
>Everyone knows it and everyone is still confused about it.
>But what if I told you there's more to the tower?
>What if there was someone inside the tower?
>It sounds outlandish but just bare with me here because it's a weird story.
>Usually on my commute to work at Mauville City, I always travel through Route 111 just so I can catch a glimpse of Mirage Tower.
>Sometimes I'm successful and I can snap a quick picture to be shown here, other times I'm not so lucky.
>Just the other day, the tower was there.
>And that day was one where I wasn't really doing much, I decided to finally check it out.
>Walking there took a bit of a while since I had to stop to throw out of pebble every once in a while but I eventually got there.
>From a distance the tower is nothing special but up-close it's pretty gigantic.
>Must've been about four floors in but I only managed to check out the first floor.
>You'll know why in a minute.
>Inside the place was pretty dark with only the light peeking through the cracks letting me see anything.
>There was this huge block of rock that went up to the ceiling which forced me to walk around the place in a circle.
>Must've gone around the thing a couple of times to look for hidden things but found nothing.
>On the third walk around though, I saw what I thought was one of the old guys from Mauville City but dressed in all white.
>Had this weird Pokemon too, the attached picture is my drawing of him.
>He was heading the ladder so I followed him there.
>When I tried to climb the ladder he just pulled it up.
>Looking up the hole, I saw him grin at me before waving goodbye as the creature stared at me.
>After that all he said was "You don't want to be stuck here like me, do you?"

>As I left the tower, it vanished again.

##A: The Prophet Pokemon in Hearthome Church.
>Have you ever been to the church in Hearthome City?
>While it is officially noted as the "Foreign Culture Building", everyone pretty much knows that it's a church for the residents of the city to practice Arceusism.
>Specifically it is a church dedicated to the belief of Giratinism which is in the worship of the legendary Pokemon, Giratina.
>Giratina in the mythology of Arceusism is described as a deity of "Death, Hell and Antimatter."
>Despite the grim nature of what Giratina represents, the church believes in the celebration of death, a natural part of life that all living beings go through.
>It is represented by the events the church holds on special days, a grand party to honour the lives the town has lost.
>On every other day however, the church is quiet as the people inside pray to themselves and get in touch with the spiritual side of the world.
>Come night however, something new comes in.
>A lone Pokemon cast in the moonlit shadow sits in front of the stand.
>Nothing of its face can be seen except a lone eye that gazes deep into the soul of those who look into it with angelic wings spread out as if ready to fly.
>This Pokemon possess an ability unlike many that have been seen.
>To see it happen, you only need to bring it a good meal.
>Something for it to be satisfied with, something tasty.
>When it is happy with the meal, it will tell you your fortune.
>Specifically, it will tell where you will go after you die.
>If you are good enough to go Shóre, you will be told of everything of you love in the world being given to you.
>You will experience an existence tailor made for your happiness.
>If you haven't led a good life however, you will be told of everything that happens to you within Rafrié.
>All of your worst nightmares will be made manifest within Rafrié, no detail will be spared when your fortune is read.
>The fortune is never wrong and can never be overturned.

>Would anyone care to visit?
![Drifloon from Generation IV](https://files.catbox.moe/xtp6ct.png)
##A: NEVER leave your child alone with a Drifloon.

>I'm aware that when I make this post, it's only going to be for the specific demographic of Trainers with children.
>For anyone else, you'd have the common sense to never willingly do what I became a witness to a couple days ago.
>I didn't know who tell at first aside from just the people I trusted.
>When I told my son, he said I could talk about it on here so that other people can be made aware of this.
>Of the dangers that Drifloons present.
>It was just like any other day in Azalea Town, the place I grew up in.
>I dropped my son off at school, went to do work at the Pokemon Centre as a nurse and life went on as usual.
>Fun fact about my home town, it's very common to see all kinds of Pokemon walking around the town with no one batting an eye.
>Most of the time it's a slowpoke that needs to drink some from the well but other kinds are welcome to roam the streets just as much as a human is allowed to walk.
>So seeing a Drifloon float down the sidewalk on my way back to the school wasn't of any concern to me.
>There was a child following the thing, fascinated with its resemblance to a balloon.
>Reminded me of the times of looking at the birthday balloons when I was that young.
>She wanted to grab a hold of it and play around with it, as children tend to do.
>Well she grabbed onto its thin and long arm.
>It made a weird sound, it was like a high pitched whistle.
>Its body started expand and then...float.
>And the child came along with it.
>I ran over there as fast as I could to try and drag it down and save the kid but it just kept getting bigger.
>Would've ended up getting dragged along with it if I didn't hold onto a street light and forcibly got the child down.
>Took some time to console her after that experience while the Drifloon kept floating away into the sky.
>After that, I helped her get back home and then I picked up son and got home too.
>I'm never letting my son walk out of the street alone ever again.

![Mewthree from the Pokegod rumours](https://files.catbox.moe/lbmddo.png)
##A: I think I saw the second clone of Mew.

>Do you guys remember one of the natural habitats of Mew, Faraway Island?
>The only way you could find it supposedly was with a sea map dated back decades ago.
>These days that map is fully gone and along with it the location of the island.
>Even with the recent technology of satellite imagery, no island that matches the description of Faraway Island can be seen.
>Which begs the question, what happened to it?
>It must've existed at one point, the existence of Mewtwo validates that.
>Was it a victim of climate change, was it exaggerated to the point of the description barely matched the reality of it?
>I know the answer.
>It was destroyed.
>My story about it happened years back, when I used to live in Lilycove City.
>Since me and my dad were so close to the sea, he'd take me out on boat rides to explore the open ocean.
>We were never looking for anything in particular, it was just one of the ways we decided to bond together.
>On that day though as we were riding the boat out in the deep sea we saw the sky grow brighter.
>The two of us were just talking in the boat when something to far right of us made the sky brighter.
>My dad usually brought his binoculars for bird watching so he pulled them out and looked off to where it was while I looked at the sun.
>After a couple minutes he ran back inside of the boat and rushed to the controls to get us back to land.
>He dropped the binoculars on the floor so I took them and tried to look.
>With them I saw something that looked like Mewtwo holding what I originally thought was the sun.
>I think it wore armour, it was bulky than normal too.
>After a couple of seconds it dropped the ball and it hit the ocean.
>I turned away to save my eyes but the shockwave knocked me down.
>My head slammed the side of the boat and I was out cold.
>Only woke up hours later in bed.
>Always thought of it as a dream until a couple days back when my dad told me the truth.
>I wonder where it is now.

![Ditto from Generation I](https://files.catbox.moe/natxqa.png)
##Q: What are the limits to Ditto's transform ability again?

>I just want to make sure I'm not going crazy here but Dittos aren't the best at transforming right?
>They're not supposed to be able to perfectly replicate into another Pokemon, they always have the weird smile and those beady black eyes.
>Even still though, I've been hearing some local rumours in Konikoni City about a group of Dittos that were impersonating humans.
>The appearances were mostly perfect but the game was given away by them only being able to say Ditto.
>Once someone caught them all and stopped them from being humans, that was supposedly the end of it.
>At least I thought it was.
>It happened some days back, I was getting a an nice omelette from the local restaurant.
>After the meal, it'd gotten dark so I was making the usual beeline back home when I noticed that the light house wasn't on.
>In case I need to spell it out, that's pretty dangerous.
>Ships could accidentally crash into the city if that light wasn't on so I decided to rush in to see what was going on.
>There were a couple of guys there already that were outside knocking on the door to try and get in.
>I tried to yank the door open before kicking it down.
>While the two were yelling at me I went up the stair case and entered the room with the light.
>I saw an old and tall man standing on the balcony past the glass door, taking in the sea air.
>I knocked on the door and opened it to speak to him.
>He just looked back at me and smiled.
>Then when I asked him to turn the light back because people would get hurt otherwise he just stared me.
>And started laughing.
>It was a deep laugh at first but the pitch kept changing.
>He started to shrink, his face began to just become flesh.
>Those eyes melted away to become those black beads.
>His lips faded to become just a simple smile.
>And then he ran away, laughing all the while.

>I don't know what would've happened if he had let a ship crash.

![Burned Tower from Generation IV](https://files.catbox.moe/6u8p70.png)
##A: The Burned Ghosts of Ecruteak City.

>A centuries old legend of two towers that scraped the clouds.
>Two legendary Pokemon stood on top of the towers and protected the region of Johto.
>Until a century and a half ago when lightning struck the tower Lugia sat upon who chose to run away.
>Within it, three unknown Pokemon perished in the blazing inferno that eventually dampened by a storm that shortly arrived.
>While Ho-Oh swooped in and resurrected the pokemon to become the Legendary Beasts, others weren't so lucky.
>Many people were trapped inside the building, killed from blunt physical trauma as they fell from the high floors of the building to the basement below.
>Some were crushed under the falling wooden supports, unable to be saved.
>It is unknown how many died due to many historical records becoming lost to time but among the dead were a father and a child.
>Their bodies were found holding hands near the staircase to the ground floor which was blocked up by debris.
>While exploration of the building these days is heavily discouraged, that hasn't stopped many urban explorers from investigating the ruined building.
>Even so, many explorers have advised many others as to not visit the basement.
>At least not through the stairs.
>Multiple people have reported that they've found themselves tripping on seemingly nothing as they walk down the stairs.
>While some are able to quickly regain their footing, others have tumbled the stairs and have broken bones over the fall.
>The ones that fall down the stairs then reportedly hear footsteps rushing up the stairs.
>Those don't fall say that when going back up the stairs, they fall back down again.
>Often times saying that felt something grab their ankle before falling.
>One day, a man who fell down the stairs and then quickly looked behind him saw a young boy try run up the stairs quickly before being grabbed to the side by a hand.
>And then dragged back down to the basement.

![Doomsday from Pokegod rumours](https://files.catbox.moe/opo20m.png)
##Q:[GRAPHIC] Anyone else ever heard of Doomsday?

>It's this old rumour that was told by parents to any kid who was cocky and arrogant enough to go out of the house and night.
>It was this Pokemon that was originally a human but was resurrected as a kind of ghostly revenant.
>A revenant that came back wrong.
>It would roam around wherever it died and look for any kind of way to avenge its lost life.
>Even if it meant taking another's life.
>There wasn't any basis in these tales back then but they sure as hell worked on me.
>Even as I grew out of those tall tales, I never really ventured out at night because I always feared a Doomsday would be out there.
>That is until a year back when some friends of mine convinced me to check out the burned down Pokemon Mansion on Cinnabar Island at night, when no one could see us.
>I didn't even know how we were going to get there but one of the kid's parents owned a canoe.
>It was just the four of us as we rowed down Route 21 to the abandoned island.
>A lot of the place was destroyed when its volcano erupted, the mansion was one of the few buildings still standing.
>We left the canoe by the port and with our flashlights, got to the mansion.
>All over the place there was some food and healing stuff, last people here ran off in a rush.
>One of the friends decided to run off ahead and try to get to the second floor.
>First it was just footsteps running over us.
>And then a scream.
>I ran as fast as I could to the stairs to try and help him, to do anything to save him.
>But when I got there, there was nothing I could do.
>My friend was being...eaten by it, by Doomsday.
>One of its spikes was roughly shoved through the top of his head and came out of his chin while another was through the chest.
>I could see my friends ribs and lungs fall out of him.
>His back was getting gnawed off by the things teeth.
>While it was eating, all that it ever said was "...Fuji..."
>We had to leave him behind and never look back.

>I'm so sorry Jack.

![Zoroark from Generation V](https://files.catbox.moe/mpvcto.png)
##A:[GRAPHIC] Never look for a Zoroark within the Lostlorn Forest.

>As someone who lived in Nimbasa City, I've always wondered about the nearby forest off of Route 16.
>Everyone I speak to always make a point to the tourists that they shouldn't go deep into the forest.
>Not even just for getting lost but because of the Zoroark that is in there.
>When they feel as if their den is under risk of attack, they create a field of illusions to disorient and scare people into leaving.
>And that forest was where a Zoroark was taking shelter in.
>So with all of these warnings I've known throughout the entirety of my life, you'd think I'd never willingly set foot in that place right?
>Nope, I went there just a couple days ago.
>Both because I wanted to complete my team comp and also because I didn't want people to get lost in the forest anymore.
>So I went off to the forest with a couple of Pokeballs and went looking for the thing.
>Nothing was in the open areas so I started my walk into the thick batch of trees.
>After a while of walking, I started to barely hear some whispering.
>I couldn't make out they said but I know they passed through my ears.
>Just some illusions, they couldn't be real.
>Walking further, I soon started seeing the first bodies.
>All of them had their chests clawed open and the top parts of their head were missing.
>Going further I saw the missing pieces, they were flung at trees where they left a heap of shattered bone and squashed brains.
>The bodies only grew more in size as I kept walking, I knew they just illusions but I couldn't help myself from heaving.
>I eventually spotted it, I think it was sleeping underneath a tree as mounds of bodies surrounded it.
>I shakily grabbed my Pokeball and threw it at the Zoroark, praying the first time would work well enough.
>It shook once.
>Shook twice.
>And it locked.
>I fell down to the ground and closed my eyes, happy the illusions were going to be over.
>I opened my eyes.

>The bodies didn't disappear.

![Parasect from Generation I](https://files.catbox.moe/699hzf.png)
##A: The Parasect's House.
>We all remember Safari Zone right?
>Specifically the one in Kanto, owned by Mr Baoba.
>Way back when I was a kid, me and my friends would always try to catch the Pokemon using some tricks as to follow the rule of not hurting them.
>The best memory I had was finding the Secret House all by myself for the first time.
>I remember that guy sitting on his chair next to his Parasect gasping in shock when I walked in.
>Him teaching me Surf was a vital part in getting my best Pokemon team.
>Once I started to make a stable living out of being a Trainer, I moved away from Kanto to move to Unova to be a full time Trainer.
>After a couple of years there, I earned myself a pretty good life in the city.
>Eventually though, I grew homesick.
>So last week, I had booked a flight back to my hometown of Kanto to surprise my family and take a trip down memory lane.
>After a nights rest with my parents, I went straight for the old Safari Zone.
>When I got there, I found out the hard way that the place had become closed down and abandoned as other Safari Zones were being made elsewhere.
>Nevertheless though, I decided to sneak in and go around the place.
>A lot more Pokemon thrived in the zone now at the expense of it becoming grossly dilapidated.
>Could barely walk through the tall grass.
>After a bit I decided to walk to where the old house was, see if anything had happened to it.
>When I got there I was surprised to see it be in relatively good condition.
>Still dirty and abandoned but not broken.
>I pushed the door to see if I could open, which it did to my concern.
>Taking a few steps in, I felt my heart sank when I saw the man who lived here dead in his chair.
>He was staring up at the ceiling, a whole host of fungi in his open mouth.
>His skin was a mixture of green and black, like he was painted with dark swamp water.
>I began to close the door, ready to go back to town to tell the authorities.

>While the door was closing I saw his head turn to me.

##A: A Pokemon Tower Ghost.

>My mom was always ragging on me for not looking out for myself.
>I've always found myself running into some stupid situations because I was just some stubborn idiot back then.
>She was a reasonable parent most of the time, usually just giving me a stern talking to, nothing really getting her really upset.
>Except for one thing.
>Going into Pokemon Tower alone.
>The endlessly tall building was there as far as I known yet I was never allowed inside.
>She'd always catch me and she'd always...scream at me.
>Legitimate rage came out of her before she'd ground me.
>Never knew why she got this upset.
>Not until one day when I was a teenager where I decided to ask her why I wasn't allowed to go in the tower.
>She made the two of us some tea and promised me to do what she did to me for my own children.
>Her story began when she was a young child, also an overtly curious kid who wanted to explore everything.
>The Pokemon Tower was no exception.
>Late at night when my grandparents weren't awake, she snuck out and got her way inside the tower.
>Rows upon rows of tombstones greeted her in the dark, the dim light tubes her only way of seeing anything.
>There was a strong scent of lavender in the air so that the dead Pokemon in the graves wouldn't make the place smell.
>As she walked, she heard someone stumble.
>Believing it to be a guard, she hid by one of the tombstones.
>As she stayed hidden, she heard little bits of laughter.
>None of it flowed together, it was broken bits of giggles and chuckles within the room she was in.
>She peered out from the tombstone to see what was happening.
>In the dim light, she saw a pale man jump and jitter across the room, his arms and legs bending at unnatural angles as it went across the room.
>She didn't know if the man was laughing or it was something else.
>When he left, my mom got out of there as soon and as quietly as possible.
>She's never gone back since.

![Palossand from Generation VII](https://files.catbox.moe/ng09gn.png)
## A: Keep your eyes open on the beach.

>Hello.
>Just coming onto the forum to give a PSA about beaches.
>Specifically about Hano Beach, close by the Hano Grand Resort.
>There's been some incidents of missing people being reported.
>And as someone who witnessed such a thing, it's my duty to inform you people.
>If the general public on Akala Island isn't going to make an announcement about this, the least I can do is to announce it myself.
>So this incident happened 5 days ago.
>I was with my wife and daughter exploring the beach as we were staying at the resort for a vacation.
>The locals were friendly and courteous, showing us around and giving out some landmarks for us to check out.
>They even took our map of the place and marked out the places to go.
>My wife noticed however that the more the map was marked, the more it became noticeable that there was a part of the beach that no one recommended.
>A huge batch of land was simply ignored by them.
>Being the curious woman she always was, she recommended that we go to check it out.
>I said no of course but she knew her ways.
>So all three of us went to the unmarked land.
>It was very serene and quiet being there, nobody else was around.
>Just us, mounds of sands with toy shovels stuck in and the drifting in sea.
>Over the horizon she spotted a big sand castle.
>A lone sandcastle in the middle of the empty beach.
>She ran off after it, bringing our daughter along with her.
>I went off after them and was able to hold onto my daughter's hand to stick with them.
>That moment proved to be essential.
>Because as soon as my wife got to the castle, it...opened up.
>It collapsed in of itself and opened up a hole for her to fall in.
>My daughter would've fallen in too if I didn't grab her.
>She screamed briefly but the sand swallowed her silent.
>We just thought she fell at first.
>But we still haven't found her.
>I fear she's dead.

![Duskull from Generation III](https://files.catbox.moe/a43013.png)
##>Q: Naughty kids, has this ever happened to you?

>First time posting here, hi!
>Just wanted to see if this kind of thing happened to anyone else.
>I'm a Hoenn kid myself but if this happened to anyone else, please let me know.
>This happened a decade back when I was a little kid.
>I was the youngest kid with two older brothers who were pretty talented trainers.
>Talented enough to win local tournaments.
>They were pretty close with their Pokémon too, making them feel like they were apart of the family.
>Never understood why back then.
>I wish I did when one of them passed away.
>She was a Bulbasaur, died of natural causes.
>We went on a road trip to Mt. Pyre late at night to have her buried and to pay our respects.
>Didn't think much of it, aside from a very late day out trip.
>When we got there and when we stood by the grave of the Bulbasaur, I was starting to get bored.
>Didn't want to stand around and do nothing so I snuck away to explore the mountain.
>Had my pocket flashlight with me to help see through the dark.
>Could barely see much but it did the trick.
>I remember the smell of freshly cut grass and the crashing of waves around the island.
>Little headstones were scattered around the place.
>I decided to read as many of those tombstones as I could with my light.
>First one was dedicated to a Pokémon called Trixie.
>Then one was dedicated to Cruise.
>Another to Kyo.
>As I was reading one that was meant for Dust, I heard the grass rustle.
>I looked around myself, looking around with a pinprick light source.
>Nothing.
>I turned back around.
>And I saw a skull in the tombstone, looking back at me.
>I ran as fast as I could, following the footprints I made as it laughed.
>It only laughed harder as I started crying for mom.
>Eventually got back to where they were and they got me back in the car.
>Mom was pretty mad at me, telling me about how dangerous that was but I couldn't focus on her at that time.

>Not when I saw the skull staring at me through the window.

##Q: [GRAPHIC] Most traumatic Pokemon encounter?

>There's a lot of ghost stories on this forum, but have any of you guys ever had an experience with a Pokemon that truly scarred you for life?

>For me, it's the time I almost died in Petalburg Woods.
>It was about seven years ago, and I was on a trip through the forest.
>One of many, since I live not too far off in Rustboro City, right on the edge of Route 104.
>I always had my trusty Spoink with me, so my parents were fine with letting me go out on my own, although they did warn me to stay on the trail.
>Usually I listened, but I already knew the path like the back of my hand and wanted to see something new.
>The plan was that as long as I kept walking in a straight line, all I'd have to was turn around and I'd find my way back, so I just started walking.
>I must've walked for quite a while, because when I looked, I noticed that the forest had become much more dense, dark and quiet.
>Quiet, that is, until I heard ominous howling in the distance.
>Even with Spoink, I knew I'd be in trouble if a wild Pokemon were to show up here, so I quickly turned around to get out of there.
>I tried to stay quiet as to not alert whatever was making that awful noise, but a Slakoth had other ideas and decided to fall right out of a tree somewhere beside me.
>Before I knew it, a large Pokemon had sprang out of the darkness to devour the poor thing.

>What little light still made it through the foliage lit up the bloody scene, and revealed the Pokemon as a Mightyena.
>It was covered in a bunch of wounds and dried blood, but most disturbingly, its eyes looked to be clawed clean out of their sockets.
>Horrified by the sight, I tried to get away while it was still eating.
>Because of where the Slakoth fell, that meant I had to get closer to that thing to make it back to the trail.
>To this day I still thank my lucky stars that this particular Mightyena just happened to be blind.
>With every step I took, I saw its ears twitch slightly, forcing me to a Slugma's pace.
>Just as I made it past, however, I took one last look back to see that it had finished its meal and was now sniffing the air.
>Its lack of eyes seemingly didn't matter much if it was using Odor Sleuth, because it immediately locked eyes with me and rushed to claw at my back.
>It hurt so much, but I was quick enough to send out Spoink before it could go for my neck.
>Unfortunately, the sound of Spoink being released immediately sent the Mightyena into a frenzy, and it launched itself at him.
>I felt terrible having to use a Psychic type Pokemon against a Dark type, even more so as I heard his terrified squeals, but I was now free to run.
>I recalled Spoink as soon as I could, hoping that the Mightyena's blindness would keep it from being able to track us down as we escaped.
>Eventually, I did make it back to the trail safely, where a few kind trainers helped us to the nearest hospital.
>Both of us still have the scars, but thankfully Spoink has managed to forgive me for accidentally using him as a distraction.
>I haven't gone back to Petalburg Woods since.

##Q: how are these moves not banned yet??? --- aceTrainer004


>now before I go on im a fairly new trainer I started a month ago or so. i know battles always got a bit violent, ive been watching tournaments since I was a little kid, plenty of flying teeth and the occasional spilled blood, but lately ive realized some moves are really fucked up!
>my Charmander recently learned to use ember and I was eager to test it.
>I went for a wild caterpie since I wanted to catch it and knowing bug is weak to fire it would’ve made it easier to weaken it down, but the moment I used it the little thing just burst in flames!
>writhing in pain and crying and such. i was petrified, I couldn’t do anything but watch, it was so fucked up.
>and thats just the tip of the iceberg, rock smash, flare blitz, etc. i know it’s a violent sport to begin with but this is NOT ok


>RE|Q: how are these moves not banned yet??? --- eatrarecandy453

>THIS THIS THIS. This is the reason I completely dropped pokemon training.
>Me and a friend from school were just having a friendly spar. Down to our last pokemon, my Buizel and his Elekid, both almost exhausted.
>Just when I was about to win his Elekid uses thunderpunch, catching my mon offguard and just outright blowing its head up on impact!
>The body was on the floor but still twitched and jolted from all the electricity flowing thru it. I was so distraught that we both swore off poketraining.

>I thankfully never witnessed a Mon dying during combat but I got pretty close.
>We were training to win this tiny local tournament as I really needed the prize money, but during our various spars my Hitmonlee missed its training partner and just smashed against the floor.
>His poor legs bent sideways and I heard a horrible crack. We weren’t able to compete missing my favorite mon.

>surprised to see people reply to this so quickly! I thought incidents of this type were somewhat uncommon. that just makes me wonder why people barely speak up about this though.

>RE|Q: how are these moves not banned yet??? – NOTHINGIMPOSSIBLE

>Holy shit grow a pair you all. It’s a sport, a competition, theres bound to be some blood to be spilled to reach the top lol.
>Not to toot my own horn but I win local tourneys practically all the time and I can assure you you wont get as far as I did without offing a few mons. You get used to it

>RE|Q: how are these moves not banned yet??? – aceTrainer004

>dude what the fuck is wrong with you? thats no excuse, im sure you can get to the top without being unnecessarily violent


>RE|Q: how are these moves not banned yet??? – NOTHINGIMPOSSIBLE

>Lol figured I’d get a pussy answer like this.
>Really its all part of the game, off a good mon of theirs and you wont see their face show up against you for a good while while they scramble to fill the gap in their team (if they even bother returning to duels like that bitch boy above).
>Again you just gotta get used to it but I wouldn’t expect a newbie like you to get it

>Locked thread. I’m tired of having to deal with BS flame wars about ethics by newbies every other day.
