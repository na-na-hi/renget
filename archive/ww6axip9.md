!~**Unnamed Restaurant, Earth**~!

"Finally a working adult huh? Maybe one day you'll treat me to a restaurant dinner instead."

"Haha, thanks, Jake."

Rain takes a bite of the steak served in front of her, then looks up across the table at her older brother. The young man hasn't changed a bit since he moved overseas last year. He works in finance, while she recently landed a position at a Botany research lab.

"I remember when you found a poison ivy bush and rubbed it on yourself just to see what it would do. That was the dumbest yet nerdiest shit I've ever seen!" Jake laughs.

"I wanted to see if it really did make people itchy! Anyway, you're one to talk about 'nerdy'. I'm not the one going around bragging about my *Pokemon Showdown* OU ranking of all things." Rain retorts.

"Hey, I remember you'd borrow my 3DS just to play PMD for *hours*."

"Its a good game!"

"Yeah, for idiots."

Rain smiles. She missed this lighthearted banter with her brother.

"Whatever. I need to go to the bathroom. Dont choke on a french fry while Im gone."

"That was *one* time!"

Rain stumbles into the bathroom stall and barely catches herself on the sink. 

"W-woah."

She holds the sides of the sink as she tries to stand up straight. She's only had half a glass of wine to drink, but it felt like a gallon. Her head is in a daze, she can not focus her vision and her ears are buzzing with a shrill ringing. She grits her teeth and examines herself in the mirror. Was she always this pale?

In the midst of her confusion, the sound of glass breaking outside the bathroom causes her to jump in surprise.

Opening the door with caution, she peers outside, expecting to see broken plates or glasses, but instead -

*Dark.*

A piercing headache wracks her mind.

Unable to focus her vision, she fumbles around the bathroom stall.

**Darker.**

She reaches for the doorknob, but grasps at nothing.

"Jake? What-"

***Darker.***

A cold chill travels up her spine. Her fingertips feel numb, and her legs give out.

She faints.

Darkness.

!~**???, ???**~!

"Hey, you awake? Are you okay?"

"Jake? God no, I feel like that time you hit me with - oh god my head fucking *hurts.*"

Rain has a hard time standing up. Everything sounds too loud, her eyes are still fuzzy and worst of all, it feels like her legs shrunk in size and are bent the wrong way. She decides to continue to lie down on her side instead.

"Jake - I think you need to call 911. I can't stand."

"Oh sorry. I'm not Jake and don't know who he is, I just happened to come across you lying here in this field. But what's *911?*" The stranger replied.

Rain grimaces. Blinking a few times to clear her eyesight, she takes a first look at the concerned passerby. And screams.

"Holy *SHIT*! You're a *really* big bird!" She jumps to her feet and assumes a fighting stance.

"Woah! I've never seen an Eevee stand on 2 legs before! Impressive!" The raven replies. "And thanks for the compliment. I work out." 

Finally opening her eyes to the world around her, she finds her saviour is a rather large black-and-blue bird a few inches taller than her, with ruby red eyes and talons that look like they could rival steel, and a pouch slung across his chest tucked under a wing. Oddly enough, even with a beak, she could tell it was smiling.

Wait... Eevee?

It finally comes to her attention that her body does not feel right - or *human* for that matter - and that she can now clearly see the 'hands' held in front of herself are little grey paws. She can feel her ears sitting on top of her head instead of on the sides, the scarf of fluff that adorned her neck and her new fifth appendage - a tail.  She tilts her head down to face her own body and is greeted by one of an eevee, currently quivering with the struggle of standing on 2 legs. Her mind is instantly flooded with questions. Is this a dream? What happened while I was blacked out? I thought eevees were supposed to be brown? How do pokemon bodies work? Oh my god, do eevees get perio-

"Miss? Are you okay?"

Whatever conciousness she had just gained left her just as fast, and she returns to darkness again.
