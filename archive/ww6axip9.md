!~**Unnamed Restaurant, Earth**~!

"Finally a working adult huh? Maybe one day you'll treat me to a restaurant dinner instead."

"Haha, thanks, Jake."

Rain took a bite of the steak served in front of her, then looked up across the table at her older brother. The young man hasn't changed a bit since he moved overseas last year. He was working in finance, while she recently landed a position at a Botany research lab.

"I remember when you found a poison ivy bush and rubbed it on yourself just to see what it would do. That was the dumbest yet nerdiest shit I've ever seen!" Jake laughed.

"I wanted to see if it really did make people itchy! Anyway, you're one to talk about 'nerdy'. I'm not the one going around bragging about my *Pokemon Showdown* OU ranking of all things." Rain retorted.

"Hey, I remember you'd borrow my 3DS just to play PMD for *hours*."

"Its a good game!"

"Yeah, for idiots."

Rain smiled. She missed this lighthearted banter with her brother.

"Whatever. I need to go to the bathroom. Dont choke on a french fry while Im gone."

"That was *one* time!"

***

Rain stumbled into the bathroom stall and barely caught herself on the sink. 

"W-woah."

She held the sides of the sink as she tried to stand up straight. She only had half a glass of wine to drink, but it felt like she drank a gallon. Her head was in a daze, she couldn't focus her vision and her ears buzzed with a shrill ringing. She looked up and examined herself in the mirror. Was she always this pale?

In the midst of her confusion, she jumped at the sound of glass breaking outside the bathroom.

Opening the door with caution, she peers outside, expecting some broken plates or glasses, but instead saw- 

*Dark.*

A piercing headache wracks her mind.

Unable to focus her vision, she fumbled around the bathroom stall.

**Darker.**

She reached for the doorknob, but grasped at nothing.

"Jake? What-"

***Darker.***

A cold chill travels up her spine. Her fingertips feel numb, and her legs give out.

She faints.

Darkness.

!~**???, ???**~!

"Hey, you awake? Are you okay?"

"Jake? God no, I feel like that time you hit me with - oh god my head fucking *hurts.*"

Rain had a hard time standing up. Everything sounded too loud, her eyes were stilly fuzzy and worse of all, it felt like her legs shrunk in size and were bent the wrong way. She decided to continue to lie down on her side instead.

"Jake - I think you need to call 911. I can't stand."

"Oh pardon me. I'm not Jake and don't know who he is, I just happened to come across you lying here in this field. But what's *911?*" The stranger replied.

Rain groaned. Blinking a few times to clear her eyesight, she took a first look at the concerned passerby. And screamed.

"Holy *SHIT*! You're a *really* big bird!" She jumped to her feet and assumed a fighting stance.

"Woah! I've never seen an Eevee stand on 2 legs before! Impressive!" The raven replied. "And thanks for the compliment. I work out." 

Her saviour was a rather large black-and-blue bird a few inches taller than her, with ruby red eyes and talons that look like they could rival steel, and a pouch slung across his chest tucked under a wing. Oddly enough, even with a beak, she could tell it was smiling.

Wait... Eevee?

It finally came to her attention that her body did not feel right - or *human* for that matter - and that she could now clearly see the 'hands' held in front of herself were little grey paws. She could feel her ears sat on top of her head, the scarf of fluff that adorned her neck and her new fifth appendage - a tail.  She tilts her head down to face her own body and is greeted by one of an eevee, currently quivering with the struggle of standing on 2 legs. Her mind was instantly flooded with questions. Is this a dream? What happened while I was blacked out? I thought eevees were supposed to be brown? How do pokemon bodies work? Oh my god, do eevees get perio-

"Miss? Are you okay?"

Whatever conciousness she had just gained left her just as fast, and she returned to darkness again.
