When the restrictions finally lifted and Japan opened its borders, HoloMyth packed their bags and flew thousands of miles across land and sea to meet up within the country, save for the resident reaper whose only travel concern was an afternoon train ticket. All five of them shacked up in a modest condo on the outskirts of Tokyo's urban sprawl to spend the precious three months allotted by their visas, and seeing one another in the physical world was every bit the emotional high they had anticipated. The first few days spent in each others company was a cavalcade of teary-eyed fun and non-stop sightseeing.

After the emotions leveled off and waterworks dried up, the Myth girls settled into a perfectly ordinary routine as housemates. Chores were divvied up between taking out the trash, general housekeeping, and cooking dinner.

The last item soon proved to be contentious. While it saved money and provided a healthy alternative to the endless stream of takeout boxes piling up in their rooms, most of the girls were out of their depth preparing anything more involved than a ham sandwich. And no one was more eager to point this out than the resident priestess.  

“Mmm...not bad, not bad. It's...an improvement!” Ina set her fork down next to the half-eaten casserole and folded her hands back over her lap. “You left it too long in the oven, right? It's fine, I used to do that all the time. Let me watch next time and I can help you out.”

It was a curious thing to hear Ina of all people weigh in on other people's cooking abilities considering most of the meals in her life had been catered by her doting mother, but things had changed in the last four months before meeting up in Japan. In an effort to become more self-sufficient, Ina had been picking up the knife more than the pen and wanted to “share” her newfound knowledge of the culinary arts whenever she could. Her critique was measured and inoffensive, she knew how much effort the girls were putting into their cooking and didn't want to cut too deep...but the best intentions couldn't hide the quiet smugness beneath her words. 

“Yeah...sorry about that.” Ame leaned back in her chair and gave the same canned response she always did. Rotating days to prep dinner sounded like a good learning opportunity at first, but getting shot down for the sixth time had a way of dampening her enterprising spirit whenever her turn came up. None of the other girls seemed to have a problem with her cooking either, making the prick of Ina's complaints that much sharper. Was it so hard to just keep those thoughts to yourself?

The girls spent the rest of the meal catching up on their days, going over stream plans, and discussing possible vacation spots for the upcoming holiday season. Any lulls in conversation were quickly filled with more of Ina's incessant whinging, and the plastic smile on Ame's face wavered.

By the time dinner was finished and everyone's plates were soaking in the sink, Ame wasn't even hiding her discomfort. Kiara asked if everything was okay and Ame shrugged it off with some half-baked excuse of not getting enough sleep last night. The real issue was much more pressing but, however tempting it may have been to put Ina in her place, Ame just didn't have the courage to directly confront her. 
 
As Ina's footsteps trailed down the hall and into her bedroom, a devilish idea suddenly took shape in Ame's mind. It would need the full cooperation of the other girls but, based on their weary sighs whenever Ina started verbally picking apart their dish, it was safe to assume they would be on board. The corners of Ame's mouth lifted into a small smile.

Perhaps there was a way to fire back after all.

----

 Ten days later it was Ame's turn to cook again. Instead of the usual fare, she took Ina aside outside her bedroom door and informed her that, as a way of saying thanks for all her wonderful advice, Myth would be preparing a special meal for her exclusive consumption. The reveal brought a light tinge of pink to Ina's pointed ears and she stammered out her appreciation. In the back of her mind, Ina had always been afraid of coming down too hard on them so hearing this was a great relief.

Ame took Ina's hand and sat her down at the dining room table. There were no utensils or plates of any kind, the only item of note being a single thin napkin on her right side in a neat triangular fold. Ame dug into her pocket and held out a wide cut of purple cloth.

“Mind wearing this? To be honest, we're still not that confident in our, what did you call it...'plating'? We want you to judge us on how it tastes, not how it looks, y'know?” 

Ina crossed her arms and nodded. “Humu, humu! If that makes you feel better then blindfold away, Ame.”

“Great!” Ame wound the fabric nice and tight around Ina's eyes and finished it off with a simple knot at the back of her head. “I'll let the girls know you're ready. Hope you're hungry!”

Ina sat patiently in place as the sound of various pots and cutlery rattled in the kitchen. The sporadic metallic clangs were a facade, as the only preparation and ingredients Myth needed were currently churning in their bloated nut sacks.

The plan was simple; the girls would take turns serving Ina a hearty meal consisting entirely of their freshly squeezed semen. It wasn't overly malicious, more of a way to blow off steam after receiving weeks and weeks of constant, unprompted criticism. In Ame's words, it was a “harmless prank”. Ame also suggested abstaining from masturbation in the meantime to make sure their dish was as thick and flavorful as possible. Easier said than done, as their overactive virility sent their already sizable bulges straining against the seams of their underwear, and the amount of precum leaking from their cocks mandated a change of panties multiple times a day.

Ame walked back into the dining room and signaled the other girls to follow. “We're good to go, Ina. Also, can you give us a quick review of everything after you eat it? It would really help us improve.”

“Of course, it's the least I can do for all the work you guys put in.” Ina scooted forward in her seat, eager to experience what Myth had to offer.
Gura was first in line. She took a deep breath and set a shallow sake cup down on the table. The girls were advised to bring containers proportional to their release, so Ame had to stifle a laugh looking at Gura's pitiful serving size.

“Not a word, Watson.” Gura grumbled as she gripped the hem of her hoodie.

She pulled it up and and flashed her crotch to the blindfolded girl in front of her. Tucked in her white panties was small bulge pushing out against her pale, supple thighs. While easily the smallest of the Myth girls, her golf ball-sized nuts were still heavily active and her underwear was stained with a large splotch of sticky precum. She fished out her meager cock and jerked it back and forth between her slender fingers, drawing her hips along for the ride as she thrust into the open air. 

*“Hnnmm!”* She fought to suppress her moans as three milky spurts splashed into the sake cup. A single, sparkling strand connected Gura's pink cockhead to her dish which she quickly shook off.

Gura cupped the fragile porcelain and brushed it against Ina's fingertips. “H-here you go, Ina! There's not a lot but it's a good, uh, appetizer.”
A tense few seconds followed as Ina's blind hands slowly grasped around the cup and lifted it to her face. At any moment, Ame feared Ina would sense something was wrong and end the prank before it started.

Fortunately, the priestess' only actions were to give the saucer a light sniff, bring her delicate lips to the rim, and slurp Gura's shiny puddle of sperm into her mouth in one go. “Mmm?” Her eyebrow raised beneath the cloth. She left it on her tongue for a bit, letting the creamy mass soak into her taste buds and pool around her teeth. Ina then swished it side to side in her mouth as if to tease the flavor out of a fine wine, before swallowing it down in a shallow gulp.

“*Ahh...*interesting dish, Gura...” Ina had never done a taste test before, so she brought her hand to her chin and thought back to all those cooking shows she used to watch for inspiration on how to do a proper review. “Sweet and salty...a light flavor that you could drink all day without getting overwhelmed. Kind of fishy too, like well-aged anchovies?” She smacked her lips as she put the rest of her thoughts in order. “It's pretty thin and easy to move around in your mouth, and doesn't have much of an aftertaste. I would have preferred a bigger serving, though. Do you have anymore?”

Still red in the face from watching her friend unknowingly rinse out her mouth with freshly milked semen, Gura locked eyes with the floor and sputtered out a meek apology. “S-sorry, that's all I made for today.”

Ame took the stuttering shark girl aside and moved the show along. “Okay, nice job, shortie. Next up is...Kiara!”

Ina's ears perked up at the announcement. Based on Kiara's previous dinner preparations and cooking streams, Ina wasn't sure how technically proficient her dish would be, but she smiled knowing it would at the very least be made with love.

Kiara strode confidently forward and produced a medium-sized ceramic mug. “World's Best Boss” was printed neatly on the side in bold, orange letters. She didn't bother wearing anything underneath her micro skirt, so she simply reached down and started pumping herself to full length. Her shaft was hot and sweaty in her hand, and Kiara made good use of Ina's skimpy outfit to bring herself over the edge. 

*“Nggh...hmnn!”* Kiara had to cover her mouth with one hand as her balmy spunk blasted against the bottom of the mug and quickly filled it to capacity. She slid it across the table, hands still shaking in post-orgasmic throes, and cautioned, “It's hot by the way, so be careful.”

Ina nodded and cradled it in her small hands like a mug of hot chocolate. Her palms were clammy in seconds and she could feel the heat wafting against her chin and lips. In this moment, holding Kiara's warmth in her hands, she thought back to what they had built up together as co-workers and friends over the years: from the early days of nervous introductory Discord calls, to collabing on covers with millions of views, and now gifting one another homemade meals. With those feelings fresh in her mind, she blew across the top of her beverage to cool it down and then threw it back, chugging the entirety of its contents in seven hearty gulps. Kiara watched enraptured as Ina's esophagus bobbed and bulged with every swallow of her seed that, just seconds earlier, was roiling in the molten depths of her smooth, orange-sized balls.

The mug clacked back down and Ina steadied her breath. Her face was flushed and slick like she'd just run a marathon. “Wow, Kiara, that had some kick. A good deal thicker than Gura's with a lot of volume to spare.” Ina's tongue traveled up and down the inside of her cheeks to lap up the residuals of Kiara's creamy load. “A nice mix of seasonings, and comes off as spicy without being painfully hot. Somewhat greasy as well, it was slipping and sliding all over my tongue while I was drinking it.” She giggled. “And I can still feel it warming me up from the inside, maybe let it cool down a bit more next time?”

Kiara pouted and put her hands on her hips, mildly annoyed she didn't get full marks. “Hmph, well, that's just how phoenix food is...but I'm glad you liked it.” She pulled her micro-skirt down to barely cover the bottom of her cheeks and walked back to the rest of the girls, her clearly visible junk slapping against her thighs on every step.

“Alright, thank you, Kiara! Annnd...looks like I'm up next.” Ame's excitement was clear to see as she bounced over to take Kiara's place.

Ame was holding an oversized teacup, so deep and wide it seemed better suited to serving soup than any type of beverage. Like her genmates before her, she angled the container towards her crotch and freed her cock from the waistband of her stuffy spats. Watching Ina chug Kiara's jizz like an after-work beer had left her balls aching, so she only needed a dozen shorts pumps to climax. It was an nauseatingly audible release and thick, lumpy ropes of jizz shot out of her dilating pisshole with enough force to splash out of the teacup and onto the table. After four noisy spurts, the cup was *brimming* with an obscene amount of steaming, off-white Ame spunk.

Ame looked down at the mess and smiled, wiping a bit a sweat from her brow with the back of her tie. “Oh, gimme a second, Ina. I gotta add the, uhh, garnishes.”

The detective reached under her skirt and slowly peeled her sweat-soaked spats off the slick curves of her massive ass and ball sack, shivering slightly as the room's cool air brushed across her sweltering thighs. Then, as gracefully as she could, she climbed onto the table. The resultant shaking did not go unnoticed by the priestess.

“Whoa, Ame? Everything okay?”

“Yep, totally fine!” Ame, now completely nude beneath her skirt, hovered her hefty sack over the teacup. With a toothy grin on her face, she dropped onto her heels and dunked her fat, sweaty balls on top of Ina's next dish. She let them steep there for a while, making sure that all the rank ball sweat she was stewing in from her RFA endurance stream was soaking nice and deep into the repulsive “milkshake”. Grunting slightly, Ame placed both hands on her knees and pushed back up to a standing position, before plunging down again. Over and over she teabagged Ina's drink, filling the room with the hearty slap of her testicles smacking against a swampy pool of ejaculate and spritzing the area around it in a fine shower of musky droplets.

Twenty thigh-burning squats later, Ame was almost out of breath and shining under a sticky layer of fresh perspiration. With legs opened wide, she sat on her heels and wiggled her hips, content to watch uncountable beads of glistening sweat run down her inner thighs and drip off her musky sack before seeping into Ina's drink.

When she finally stood up, there was a wet *plop* as her balls unstuck themselves from the gummy semen basin they rested on. And thanks to the drink's abnormally high viscosity, her heavy nuts left two clearly visible egg-shaped imprints in the teacup's slimy surface. 

Ame hopped down, straightened out her shirt, and thoroughly wiped the bottom of her dripping sack with Ina's previously unused napkin. Once she was finished, she returned the sodden napkin and gripped the teacup's handle. It was unnervingly heavy, like a full carton of milk. She carefully extended it towards Ina's open palms.

“Here ya go! Sorry about the wait, I had to...press some fresh juice onto it. And it's pretty full so make sure not to spill.”

Ina gave a thumbs up and took the cup in hand. “Of course, I-” Her sentence trailed off. Unlike the other dishes, this one had an immediate and imposing odor. Her nose wrinkled and Ame could see Ina's inner struggle not to comment on the unexpected smell.

“This certainly has a...unique scent.” She guided the teacup right against her lips, the pool of nut batter wobbling precariously around the edge like gelatin, and took a nice long sip.

Nothing happened. The density of the drink left her hovering lips sucking nothing but air.

Perturbed, she buried her lips beneath the surface and sucked even harder. It was an obnoxiously guttural sound, like trying too hard to draw out the last bit of milkshake from the bottom of a glass.

*“Mmng?!”* Ina's body went rigid as the batter entered her mouth and the cup almost wobbled out of her hand. She'd gotten much more than she expected with that first slurp and her mouth was *packed*. Now breathing exclusively through her nose, Ina ran her curious tongue through Ame's backed-up load, teasing it, prodding it, and flipping it over itself in her mouth like an omelet. It was unpleasantly sticky and clung to her gums and teeth like warm glue whenever she tried to push it around.

With a pained grimace, she swallowed what had invaded her mouth and exhaled sharply. “*Pwah!* Ugh...Ame, sorry, but I think you might've misread the recipe.”

Ame grinned and played along. “What? How so?”

“It's way too thick and super bitter... I could barely s-swallow all of it ” Ina swirled her tongue along the inside of her gumline, trying to scrape up the dregs of Ame's clumpy load from between her teeth. “The saltiness is overpowering and stays on your tongue long after it's gone. It's good to add seasoning but sometimes less is more... The main issue is the tacky consistency, though. I tried to drink everything down, but there's still so much left, see?” She opened wide and let her drooling tongue hang out, showing off the fat, quivering globs of briny spunk still plastered in and around her mouth. 

“W-well, ya gotta try the rest of it first...” Ame said as she fought the sudden urge to bust another nut right in Ina's inviting mouth. “I read this is one of those 'acquired tastes' that gets better the more you eat.” She paused for effect. “Unless...it's a little too much for your palette?”

Even without seeing Ina's furrowed brow, it was clear the last remark hit a sore spot.

Ina sighed. “Okay, okay, I'll finish it. But let me see the recipe after, okay?” Despite her earlier resistance, Ina knew it wouldn't be right to leave Ame's dish unfinished after she put so much thought and effort into organizing this event. Ame had always been the trail-blazer of the group, so she probably just got a little too creative with the recipe, nothing that couldn't be refined in the future.

There was something else urging her to carry on, though. Something strange and even more alien than the Old One's writhing within the book in her bedside table. It was a warm, fuzzy feeling fermenting in her head and below her stomach that started after the first sip of Gura's dish, now growing in severity like a unchecked fever. Rationally speaking, the flavor and smell was as off-putting as it had ever been, but there was an unknowable appeal that reached beyond the usual senses...and it was quickly becoming addictive. 

She re-gripped the teacup with both hands and after taking a preparatory breath (in fear or excitement she no longer knew), noisily slurped up the rest of Ame's spunk and ball sweat. Emptying it took a good while but she set it back down on the table with a satisfied grin on her lips. 

“Hmm...you've got a point, Ame. That was actually pretty good at the end.” She shifted in her seat and chose her next words carefully. “But I'm kinda full now, maybe we could do the rest tomorrow?” This wasn't exactly a lie, but her unspoken concern was losing herself to whatever abyssal desire was blooming in her subconsciousness.

“Aw, c'mon, it's just one more! Mori's been working extra hard for this too.” Ame gestured for Mori to hurry up before Ina changed her mind.

Mori awkwardly made her way to the table, too embarrassed to look Ina in the eye even through her blindfold. She hefted up her imposing, fourteen-inch reaper meat and aimed it at the woefully undersized wine glass she brought for the occasion. Performance anxiety was bad enough when it was just her and Kiara, but jerking it in front of her friends was a different kind of pressure. Mori wrapped her fingers around her girth the best she could and started beating off her sweaty, foreskin-covered shaft. Fortunately, being so pent up, it wasn't long before she felt her hefty balls clench and flood her fat cum vein with reaper jizz.

“*Hnn*, okay here it c-comes...”  Mori's load was so thick that it practically poured out of her gaping urethra. It filled the glass after the second shot and splattered heavy ropes across the table and Ina's flat chest, the sheer weight pulling Ina's flimsy chest piece low enough to see the pale, pinkish edge of her A-cup's areola.

Lost in the euphoria of her orgasm, Mori slowly came back down to Earth and noticed a strange wetness around the tip of her dick. “Huh? Oh, shit.” Mori looked down and saw that she had left her cockhead submerged in the wine glass the whole time. And since she almost never bothered cleaning down there, the priestess was about to get especially intimate with the tang of Mori's juicy, unwashed foreskin. She sheepishly fished her cock out of the wine glass and slowly wiped herself off on the glass' rim. *Ugh, gross...hopefully Ina won't drink from that side.*

“Here you go, my dude.” She paused to clear her throat and tried to stay upbeat. “Ya boy isn't that good with this kind of stuff but I tried my best!”

Ina took the leaden wine glass in hand. Something warm and heavy was pouring down her wrist from above and a powerful stench wafted into her nostrils. She forced out a thin smile. “It's okay, Calli, I'm sure it's great!”

That strange feeling bubbled back to the forefront of Ina's consciousness, urging her to “enjoy” this dish as much as possible. Why does this smell, something so objectively offensive, now fill her with such powerful hunger? Why are there small strings of drool coming from her mouth when her stomach is already so full?

Such thoughts bounced and ricocheted through the ethereal landscape of her quickly devolving mind as her body went into motion. She idly twirled the glass in hand before bringing it to her mouth, inadvertently lining up her lips with the exact spot Mori had just used to swab the week-old cum off her smelly foreskin, and guzzled a mouthful of her last dish. Her throat hitched as she realized it wouldn't go down. It was so thick that she had to *chew* before swallowing, and the obscene gnashing of her molars mashing up Mori's load was tantalizingly audible to the girls outside. Ina's saliva glands were working overtime to break everything down, and her sloppy mastication finally thinned it out enough to pass from cheek to cheek. Mori watched wide-eyed as Ina's bloated cheeks bounced and sagged with her spooge, spurts of it occasionally seeping from the corner of her lips as she chewed it into a warm, sloppy mess and strained it through the gaps in her teeth like mouthwash.

Satisfied with her work, Ina winced and forced down Mori's smelly ejaculate. Even in its more malleable state, Ina could feel it travel the length of her esophagus and slam against the pit of her stomach like liquid concrete.

*“Hahh! Hahh...”* Her breath was ragged and desperate like a body brought back from the brink of drowning. She took a moment to compose herself before giving her feedback. “It's...well, it's certainly filling, but I'd try using more water time. Right now it feels like cake batter with way too much flour which takes a lot of effort to chew through. As far as flavor goes, it was extremely bitter, almost like alcohol, with sour undertones the more you let it sit in your mouth.”

Mori hid her growing erection beneath her hands and let out a nervous laugh. “Oh, gotcha. Thanks, man, I'll remember that.”

Ina spent the next few minutes working through the rest of Mori's ejaculate. It was an arduous procession of slurping, chewing, and swallowing that left her jaw aching and stomach heavy. Whenever too much spilled out of her mouth and down her chin, she would dab it up with the crusty napkin Ame used earlier as a cum rag for her balls, spreading dried jizz across her lips like crumbs of a glazed pastry.

Though her work was technically done, finishing Mori's load fanned the flames of lust coursing through Ina's veins to a great pyre and her sensitive nose picked up that there was still some nourishment left sticking to walls of the glass. It would be rude to leave even a morsel behind, would it not? After Mori worked so hard, it's the polite thing to do, right? Thus, as a show of good faith, Ina polished the dish off by extending her tongue as far as it would reach and licking the rest of the glass clean. The mere sight of Ina's cute pink muscle pressed flat against the glass, slowly squeezing across the surface and wiping up stubborn globs of semen with insatiable vigor brought all of Myth's cocks back to full attention. Ina then spun her tongue around the rim, working up a nice slobbery paste and spit-shining Mori's disgusting cum goblet until it looked like it just came out of the dishwasher.

With a fresh, lumpy pile of Mori's sperm collected on her tongue, Ina withdrew it back between her lips, gave it a few good chews, and loudly gulped it down. She then opened wide, proudly displaying that not a trace of Mori's emission remained in her mouth and letting the reek of jizz spill into the air.
 
At last, it was over. Indulging in Ame's little event was fun, but all she wanted right now was to collapse on her bed and clear out the fog in her head. “Thank you so much, everyone! It means a lot that you put so much effort into this, but I need to lie down for a bit. So...if we're done here-” Ina attempted to get up but a firm set of hands blocked her rising shoulders from behind and forced her back into her seat. Unbeknownst to her, the four other girls were crowding around her frail body, stroking and squeezing their raging erections with frustrated hands.

Ina's oblivious cum worship had sent Myth into hormonal overdrive and they were now operating on the same lust-crazed wavelength. More than eating, sleeping, or any other worldly desire, they wanted to dominate the purple-haired tease in front of them until their combined loads were gushing out of every orifice.  Ame herself had blasted the inside of her skirt multiple times just thinking about everything she wanted to do with her and was still throbbing for more.

Ina fumbled to get her blindfold off but strong hands were quick to lock her wrists helplessly in the air. Panic rose in her chest and her confused cries faded to pleading whimpers as Myth smothered her face under the twitching mass of their leaking cockheads. The longest night of her life was about to begin, and through all the brain-searing musk filtering up her nose and slimy precum pouring over her features, deep down Ina couldn't help but feel thankful that she left room for dessert.
