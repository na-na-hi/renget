>Be Anon
>The ship’s calendar reads {July 15th, 2739}.
>you’re lost in space in a crippled single seat spacecraft.
>you must have had some freak issue with the jump drive, because the view out of the cockpit looks totally unfamiliar, and the computer says that you are almost a thousand light years outside of charted space.
>You have supplies to last a little while, and enough fuel that the life support system isn’t going to be a problem.
>However, the jump drive is completely shot, so you aren’t going anywhere any time soon.
>Despite the seeming futility of it, you turn on the distress beacon.
>The likelihood that anyone will receive it in time to save you is negligible.
>It’s the only thing that you can do though, and hey -maybe there are others out there- despite the long history of failure in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
>Time passes. You fall asleep once or twice. You don’t remember how long it was because you never checked the clock.
>Suddenly, you pick up transmissions on the communications system.
>They’re unintelligible however, and the computer couldn’t create a transcript.
>You set the computer to work on a translation.
>The audio feed doesn’t sound like any language that you had ever heard.
>But you were neither a polyglot nor a linguist, so that wasn’t exactly a high bar.
>But that was beside the point. Your situation made the possibility that it might be aliens was not merely plausible, but likely, if anything.
>This turn of events was both a relief, and a source of concern.
>If you were indeed picking up alien transmissions and not just extremely convincing noise that somehow managed to get past the filters that would normally prevent it from being relayed to you, then you might be about to be rescued.
>By Aliens.
>And you knew that you probably (definitely) were not the best candidate for being humanity’s representative in a first contact scenario.
>First contact, however, was dependent on the possibility that the aliens had actually heard your distress call, and that they were responding. You might just be picking up unrelated chatter.
>So you set about broadcasting on all frequencies. Hoping that whoever, or whatever, was out there would hear you and come investigate.
>The comms system picked up some more transmissions, seemingly in response. The sender’s voice was the same as before. 
>This was a good sign; someone had heard you.
>Now that you thought about it, the voice sounded feminine, but it was somewhat difficult to tell due to interference. They also sounded like they were very excited to hear you.
>The translation was only 30% complete, so you still didn’t know what was being said, but they at least sounded excited by their tone of voice.
>30 minutes passed -you checked the clock this time- along with some back and forth between you and your interlocutor, when the sensors picked up contact.
>The bearing was directly toward you, and from what you could tell the approaching object was only a bit larger than your ship. If someone was approaching you, they were probably traveling alone like you were. 
>Hopefully they had room for two.
>The translation on the computer was coming along at a decent pace, it was already 70% complete, and it should only take one or two more transmissions to have enough for basic conversation.
>You Turned on all the ship’s interior and exterior lights to increase the ship’s visibility. Whatever was approaching should be coming into view shortly.
