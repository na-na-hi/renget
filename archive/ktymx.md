{Insert Background}
>Be Anon
>The ship’s calendar reads {July 15th, 2438}.
>you’re lost in space in a stranded single occupant spacecraft.
>you were testing a new miniaturized FTL drive when something went wrong, either the jump controller hadn't been properly calibrated, the energy banks for the drive had been overcharged, or the FTL navigation system had been misconfigured. 
>There would be plenty of time to figure out the exact cause of the malfunction later. You're just happy to still be alive.
>Normally, when something goes wrong with an FTL drive there are no survivors.
>From what you could guess, you had jumped far further than intended.
>The view out of the cockpit looks totally unfamiliar, and the computer says that you are almost a thousand light years outside of charted space.
>You have supplies to last a little while, and enough fuel that the life support system isn’t going to be a problem.
>However, the jump drive is completely shot, the delicate internal electronics are completely fried, so you aren’t going anywhere any time soon.
>Despite the seeming futility of it, you turn on the distress beacon.
>The likelihood that anyone will receive it in time to save you is negligible.
>It’s the only thing that you can do though, and hey -maybe there are others out there- despite the long history of failure in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
>Time passes. You fall asleep once or twice. You don’t remember how long it was because you never checked the clock.
>Suddenly, you pick up transmissions on the communications system.
>They’re unintelligible however, and the computer couldn’t create a transcript.
>You set the computer to work on a translation.
>The audio feed doesn’t sound like any language that you had ever heard.
>But you are neither a polyglot nor a linguist, so that isn't exactly a high bar.
>All of these signs pointed to aliens.
>This turn of events is both a relief, and a source of concern.
>If you are indeed picking up alien transmissions and not just extremely convincing noise that is somehow getting past the filters that would normally prevent it from being relayed to you, then you might be about to be rescued.
>By Aliens.
>And you knew that you probably (definitely) were not the best candidate for being humanity’s representative in a first contact scenario.
>Rescue, and by extension first contact, is dependent on the possibility that the alien had actually heard your distress call, however. You might just be picking up unrelated chatter.
>So you set about broadcasting on all frequencies. Hoping that whoever, or whatever, was out there would hear you and come investigate.
>The comms system picked up some more transmissions, seemingly in response. The sender’s voice was the same as before. So there might only be one vessel within range.
>This is a good sign; someone had heard you.
>Now that you think about it, the voice sounds feminine, but it's somewhat difficult to tell due to interference. They also sounds like they were very excited to hear you.
>The translation is only 30% complete, so you still don't know what they're saying but they at least sound excited by their tone of voice.
> You keep talking, hoping that your mysterious visitor will use your signals to triangulate your position.
>You are pretty sure that aliens wouldn't immediately know how to decode the position data included in the automated beacon's signal.
>After a few minutes of this, between two transmissions you receive what sounds like a frenzied burst of questions that seems to stretch for almost 5 continuous minutes without a pause for  breath. 
>Then, seemingly having realized that you can't understand them, you hear what sounds like a degected sigh, followed by what you guess is them verbally chastising themselves.
>Shortly thereafter, the sensors pick up an approaching object.
>The bearing is almost directly towards you, and from what you can tell the approaching object is only a bit larger than your ship. If someone really is approaching you, they are probably traveling alone like you were. 
>Hopefully they have room for two.
>The translation on the computer is coming along at a decent pace, it is already 95% complete, and it should only take a few more minutes to have enough for basic conversation.
>You turn on all the ship’s interior and exterior lights to increase the ship’s visibility. Whatever is approaching should be coming into view shortly.
----
>Just as you think that you see something, the computer chimes to indicate that the translation functionality is now online.
>"Just in time." you think as you move to test it out.
>You set the computer to translate all communications in this new language.
>You press the talk button and begin to speak.
>“Unidentified Vessel, we should be able to understand each other now. This is Anon of the experimental spacecraft {XV-420}. My drives have failed, and I require assistance. Repeat. This is Anon of the experimental spacecraft {XV-420}. My drives have failed and I require assistance. Unidentified Vessel, do you copy?  Over."
>You pause for a response, hopefully you didn't give your guest a heart attack by suddeny speaking their language.
>After thirty seconds of what seems like stunned silence, you go to speak again.
>"Unidentified Vessel, do you re-"
>Suddenly, you are interrupted by your interlocutor, her (at this point you're confident in that) voice can be described as almost a squee.
>"You can understand me?! I have so many questions! What are you? 'ahn-awnn' doesn't sound like a Putori name. To think that I, a lowly -" she stops to catch her breath.
>"I'm getting ahead of myself," she continues. "There will be plenty of time for questions later. I read you 'Ahnonn'. This is {Łucja Määttä} of the {uh... I never named this thing}. I'm almost at your position."
>The ship approaching yours was now clearly visible. 
>It certainly wasn't a human starship. It was too small to possibly mount a conventional FTL drive, with it being a bit larger than your testbed ship. 
>And the system you were in had no planets, so it had to have traveled here at FTL speeds.
>So clearly these 'Putori' aliens either used a different means of FTL travel, or they had more advanced jump drive technology.
>Like the kind that you were testing before you wound up here.
>It looked like a craft for hauling a few passengers, or a little bit of cargo. Interestingly, it also seemed to be equipped for planetary landings without a spaceport.
{Add additional description}
>After spending a brief moment considering the alien ship, {Łucja} informed you that she was as close as she could get, so you made preparations to abandon your ship. 
>You informed her that you would be leaving your ship here, and requested permission to transfer to hers via a spacewalk. 
>Which was enthusiastically granted.
>You set the ship's fabricator to make an earpiece  and speaker for translation as well as an AR eyepiece for translating alien text, and other essential information. Then you prepared the ship's computer for separation -you were taking it with you so thankfully it was portable, and then went to prepare your space suit and MMU.
>After making sure that the space suit and manuvering unit were functional, you went and gathered up everything that you were taking with you and went to the airlock.
>You always hated spacewalks. Putting on the bulky space suit, leaving the artificial gravity, having to keep a tight grip on things to avoid them drifting away.
>Thankfully this would be brief.
>Switching to your space suit's communicator, you inform {Łucja} that you are about to exit your ship, and request guidance to enter her ship. 
{Write EVA scene}
>It was a bit cramped in this alien ship. You could stand upright, but just so. If you were any taller your helmet would be scraping the ceiling.
>Once everything was in the airlock you told {Łucja} to cycle the airlock.
>To your surprise, the airlock pulls double duty as a decontamination room.
>When the other door opens, {Łucja} is standing in the doorway.
>She's wearing some kind of protective suit. Nothing as thick as your EVA suit, but enough to obscure her figure apart from a few details.
>You notice that her helmet is not round, but instead has a forward pointing almost conical section.
>Much more noticable is her tail sticking out behind her.
>Then the gravity of the situation really hits you.
>When you were talking on the radio, nothing felt real, but now that the two of you are looking at each other, the realization that you've made first contact hits you like a ton of bricks.
>After about a minute of stunned silence -she must have been experiencing something similar- {Łucja} begins to speak.
>"W-wow you r-really are an alien," your earpeice translates. 
>"I was about to say the same," you reply.

!!! info The dialogue in this section might get rewritten later. Please give feedback.

>{Łucja} asks you to take off your space suit so that she can run a scan for potential pathogens.
>She must be rather clever, because you wouldn't have thought of that had the positions been reversed.
>After exiting your space suit, {Łucja} comes up to you with some sort of device in her hand.
>You expected a bunch of questions from her, but
>She presses a button on the device and waves it over your body.
>After a brief wait, the device beeps and {Łucja} sighs in relief.
>"Thankfully you aren't carrying anything. I would have hated keeping this thing on." says {Łucja}.
>With that, she starts taking off her quarantine suit.
>You reflexively look away, trying to be respectful.
>When you finally look back and finally get a good look at the first intelligent alien to ever be encountered by humans, you are a bit shocked.
>For an alien, she looks rather similar to an Earth species. 
>Specifically, like some kind of humanoid European Polecat.{You had seen a documentary on those some years ago.}
>Although normally they had a dark coloring, not a reddish one.
>Maybe she was erythristic?
