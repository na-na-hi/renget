##PROMPTS
***
All my cards contain <rules> tags, for formatting and instructions to the AI.
Add to your JB: "Always follow what's inside the <rules> tag, if present." or something like that.

##UPDATE NOTES
***
7-17-23 **AIDS Game, Among Lust, Ōsama Game, Outercourse Paradise, Strip RPS** - Some minor changes. Removed backslashes in defs, I thought this would escape parentheses and square brackets, but it's just retarded and the AI still gets it without them. Added jb override in Ōsama game that uses {{random}} to randomize who gets number 0.
7-15-23 **Gacha Lollipops, Eshal, Stillwater Asylum** - Some minor edits. Gacha Lollipop's prompt override jb is now prepended instead of appended.
7-12-23 **Ōsama Game** - Shorter character descriptions.
7-8-23 **AIDS Game** - Defend buffed. Idle a little bit.
