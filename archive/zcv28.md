Chapter 1

Finally, after countless days of preparation, the ritual was ready. Russel had spent months reading through the ancient scrolls and texts, gathering the necessary artifacts, and arranging them in just the proper manner to harness their dark power. Now, at this hour, when the blood moon hung high in the night sky, he could enact his infernal mission: summoning a great demon that would grant him untold levels of power. 

Wearing his dark robes, and clutching the bloodied horn of a goat, Russel began his chant.

“Ad Satanas, qui laetificat juventutem meam”

Russel could feel the horn begin to warm in his grasp, and the items strewn around the room began to levitate from the floor. The pentagram etched onto the ground by the cursed spear of Abatu glowed red as a notable energy emanated from its center. One could even hear the sounds of cackling, as though a voice were escaping from the air within the symbol, which itself was swirling and turning a dark obsidian. A wicked smile crept across Russel’s face; the ritual was working perfectly.

“Pone, diabolus, custodiam”

The light cackle from before grew into a deep, menacing laugh as the dark clouds took the shape of a vaguely human form, albeit one that was enormous in stature and exuded immense dark power. Russel threw up his hands and screamed out the last of the demonic rites.
“Veni, omnipotens aeterne diabolus!”

As the last wicked word was spoken, a strong force threw the human onto his back. From his lowered position, Russel watched as the dark cloud finally took a solid form, and out from it stepped the purpose of all of this work: Lerbasaol, the warlord of the great sanctum. The demon stood atop the summoning symbol, easily seven or eight feet tall with a rippling physique and blood-red skin. Though his chest and midsection appeared somewhat human-like, his massive pillar-like legs ended in cleft hooves. From his mouth, a cavalcade of sharp teeth rose out from his gums. Two large horns spread from his head, their ornate twists denoting his position in the underworld. Draped across his body were garments depicting scenes of beasts dancing and partying among fire and brimstone. It was clear that this creature was not from our Earth, and one could only imagine what sorts of things such an evil being had done.

Lebasaol glanced upon the room with his pitch-black eyes before settling on Russel, who was visibly excited that all of his work had come to fruition.

“Oh, great and powerful Lebasaol,” he beckoned towards the beast “I have summoned you here to my abode, and now I call upon you to smite my enemies and bring about the end times for worthless wretches of this world.”

“Naw”

In an instant, the sense of exhilaration Russel felt melted away into confusion.

“W-what?”

“Not gonna do that” the demon replied to him, the nonchalance of his voice seemed an ill fit for his appearance. He almost sounded like a stereotypical fraternity member, utterly bored at the situation in front of him. “Mind if I go upstairs, this basement is kinda bumming me out”

Russel could not reply, lying there dumbfounded as the demon clopped up the basement stairs into his den. Had something gone wrong? No, he was certain he had followed every step perfectly, and he had managed to summon Lebasaol, the warlord of the great sanctum. Yet the stories had described him as a bloodthirsty monster, eager to ravage the land and gift his followers the ability to enact untold horrors onto their enemies. Still in a state of shock, Russel brought himself to his feet, and began to slowly make his way out of his basement. 

Upon entering the first floor of his home, Russel found himself witnessing quite a sight. The demon had sat himself on his couch, resting his legs on his coffee table as he clutched a beer in one hand, and a remote in the other.

“Oh good, you’re here. Mind telling me what channel sports is on? I could certainly go for watching a game right about now”
Russel’s confusion was replaced with pure anger now, and he wanted a reason as to why Lebasaol, the warlord of the great sanctum was now bro-ing out in his living room. 

“Great and powerful demon, I demand to know why you are not following your agreement. I have brought you into the mortal world, and as per your dark customs, I am to be bestowed with unimaginable power!”

Russel was met with the demon lazily turning its head to face him, one eyebrow cocked.

“Don’t tell me all you took all those books seriously”

Once again, Russel felt himself overcome with a sense of immense confusion. “B-but, they were written by the great scholars…”

“No” Lebasaol rebutted “Those books were written by a bunch of d-bags who didn’t like us and wanted to lie about how awful we are. They were like, knights and shit, of course they’re going to hate demons.” The demon took a big swig of his beer, before piercing the can one of his sharp horns. “Personally, I think they were just jealous that we threw way better parties.”

Russel was devastated to hear this. He had spent so long researching and preparing for this moment, only to have it be one immense farce. With a heavy sigh, he sluffed off his robes, and sat beside the demon on the couch, unable to muster any energy to argue.
“Oh cheer up,” Lebasaol responded in a cheery tone, wrapping a muscled arm around the human. “I think you’ll find I can be a great roommate”

Russel’s brow furrowed at the last word, and he mustered just enough energy squeak out a question.

“Roomate?”

“Well yeah, I’m sorta in between places at the moment, and since you summoned me here, I’ll have to crash here”

Mouth agape, Russel repeated his question in a slightly more frustrated tone.

The beast ignored his shocked inquiry. “Now, I can’t really cover rent at all since I can’t get a job looking like this. But, I can make it up to you in a different way”

With that, Lebasaol lowered himself from the couch, onto his knees facing Russel. With no hesitation he dropped his head down to the human’s groin, looking up at him as a long,] tongue slithered its way out of the demon’s maw. Starting at the taint, Lebasaol dragged the muscle up the entire length of Russel’s crotch, leaving a wet trail as it went. Russel felt a sharp exhale of air leave his mouth at the sensation, the wet tongue overwhelming him and tightening his pants with just one lick.

“B-but…I’m not…” Russel began to stammer

“What, never sleep with a demon before? Relax, I'm a natural at this sort of stuff”

Before Russel could protest further, Lebasaol had his claws at the button of the pants, undoing it before pulling the pants loose in one quick pull. Russel’s cock was straining against his underwear, and a wet spot had already formed. Realizing that he had no hope of fighting off the demon, the human instead dug his fingers into the couch cushion. Using his tongue this time, Lebasaol pulled down undergarment, letting the cock it was hiding spring free.

Lebasaol let out a chuckle at the sight of it. “Well, for a small guy, you’ve definitely got quite a big guy”. He pressed his face right up to it, taking a nice big whiff of the shaft and balls. “Seems I caught you before your shower. Good, I like ‘em nice and musky”

The tongue once again sprung into action, wrapping itself around the dick several times and giving it a nice, firm grip. 

“Ready?” Lebasaol asked, his voice somehow not altered despite the position of his tongue.

Russel could only nod, the feeling of how nice and wet the tongue was overpowering his earlier trepidation. The beast let out another chuckle, and the tongue began to stroke up and down the shaft. It seemed the saliva that quickly drenched Russel’s cock acted as a quite strong lube, letting the tongue glide along his length with ease. Each few pumps drew out another bead of pre from the tip, which the tongue was more and eager to lick up. Just as Russel felt he was getting used to this rhythm, he felt a set of fingers begin to caress his balls, massaging them as the tongue’s pace quickened. Russel couldn’t help but begin to moan, his balls were his weak point, and he always felt weak at the knees when they were played with. 

“See, now you’re getting into it” the demon teased as he pushed up Russel’s shirt with his free hand. Once his chest was revealed, Russel felt the clawed fingers begin to circle around his nipple, and gasped as it gave him a slight pinch. At this point, Russel could barely contain himself, his hips thrusting a bit as the demon’s tongue stroked him faster and harder. He could feel the pressure build up inside his cock, and he knew he was getting close. Still groaning from the demon’s technique, he brought a hand forward to gentle stroke Lebasaol’s horns, noting that it felt quite smooth to the touch. 

Then, just as he felt he was about to crest the peak, Russel felt Lebasaol’s tongue loosen its grip around his cock and snake its way back into his mouth. He let out a frustrated moan and felt himself instinctually pulling the demon’s head closer to his crotch, dying for release. 

“Easy there tiger, not yet. First you’ll have to promise me that you’ll let me stay here”

Russel nodded, still trying his hardest to pull the demon closer to his cock.

“And let me eat your grub. And choose some better beer, since you’ve got some real bad pisswater in there”
Russel nodded with increasing frustration to each of these demands. His fingers were digging into Lebasaol’s head a fit out of sheer desperation, though the demon didn’t seem to mind.

“Oh, and let me share your bed since I doubt you have a guest room”

“Yes, fine” Russel erupted in a strong tone “Just let me cum”

“Alright, fair enough” Lebasaol chuckled, a sly grin on his face. “Since you asked so nicely”

Russel closed his eyes, and leaned his head back onto the couch, eager to feel the long, wet tongue wrap itself around his shaft once again. Instead, he was rather surprised to feel it press gently against his hole, prodding it gently and soaking it in more saliva. Russel raised his head again, ready to protest this new change in the dynamic. Sucking him off was one thing but rimming him with that tongue would be something else entirely. Before he could even manage a full, complete word, he was silenced by the feeling of the demon’s tongue pressing into him. He had to bite his tongue to keep him from screaming out in pleasure, the long tongue having no trouble filling his ass as it wormed its way deeper and deeper. Something inside Russel forced him to bring his eyes to Lebasaol’s, and he found himself staring deep into their pitch-black depths. The demon certainly had a smug look about him, visibly enjoying how much pleasure he was drawing out of Russel. Finally, the tongue found the human’s prostate. But, rather than simply massaging it with the tip, the tongue continued to make its way deeper, while ensuring that its length would grind against the pleasure button as it passed.
 
“Fuck!” Russel screamed, his entire body warm from the waves of pleasure cascading from his ass “I’m going to cum…”

“Do it” Lebasaol chimed back “Shoot that thick load all over me” His tone was a bit different from before. It was subtle, but Russel could just barely make out a sense of longing, a desire to have his seed cover the demon’s face.

Russel’s cock certainly didn’t need the command, but hearing the words certainly helped. With a loud, sustained groan, Russel finally exploded onto the beast, his cock shooting large thick globs of spunk onto his tongue, face and horns. As the globs hit him, Lebasaol seemed to show a mix of pleasure and smugness, fitting for a demon so eager to milk a human dry. Russel was convinced he had never cum so hard or so much in his life, and after the eighth clench of his cock and balls shot the last of his load, he could feel his entire body shaking. Lebasaol slowly pulled his tongue out from Russel, leaving the human to shiver the whole way until it emerged with a gentle pop. Now free, the tongue greedily licked up all of the cum coating the demon’s face, swallowing it down with a single, audible gulp. The two remain still for a moment, each collecting themselves. Lebasaol seemed calm and contented, whereas Russel was still an absolute mess, unable to move and gasping for air.

“Well” Lebasaol began, finally breaking the silence between them “You certainly had a lot backed up there. Don’t get laid much do you?”

“S-shut…up…” Russel barely managed to muster

“Hey, don’t worry much, you’ve got a regular semen demon living with you now”

Oh right, Russel thought to himself, he’ll be living here now. He couldn’t help but feel a twinge of annoyance at the thought. The day certainly hadn’t turned out as he planned. Still, it certainly could have gone worse.

With a groan, Lebasaol rose to his feet, stretching his muscles which were now covered in a thin layer of sweat. “God, now I’m starving. You got any meat a guy can eat”

Russel furrowed his brows again as the fog of pleasure began to dissipate from his mind. “There are steaks in the fridge. I figured you might like some raw meat one you arrived here.”

“Raw meat? Tch, you want me to catch something? Least you could have done is cooked me a nice meal”

“If I cook you a meal…will you grant me the demonic power I was promised?”

Lebasaol let out a confused chuckle as he looked down at Russel, who was just barely pulling himself off the couch, struggling to stand on his weak legs.

“What makes you think I even have any powers. You humans are more skilled at magic than we are. After all, you’re the one who dragged me here.”

Russel cursed his increasingly worsening luck as Lebasaol made his way to the kitchen, pulling out the steak from the fridge. “Oh, I hope you don’t mind, but I frequently have wet dreams at night, so I hope it’s alright if you wake up with damp sheets or a sticky back.”

Russel made sure to make a mental note to re-read his books for a spell to un-summon demons.
