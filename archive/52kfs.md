\>be scrolling through Summonr and hit up a cute demon-guy
\>he's kind of a chunky lizard-looking nerd, polite, gentle, and easily flustered
\>not bad to look at either- nice round tum, thick thighs, a decent-sized bulge and a cute nubby tail that wags when you compliment him
\>you invite him over and you have a nice time, but he seems to sweat quite a lot as you cook him a meal, nervously looking around and trying not to draw attention to a growing moisture across his midsection and a very audible growling
\>after he's eaten, you chill on the couch and just unwind for a little while. He's pretty cuddly for someone with spikes, but he always freaks out whenever you go anywhere near his stomach
\>you think he's just being insecure about his weight, but when your hand sinks a little too deep into his pudge and you feel tongue, he looks at you sheepishly and heft up his shirt so you can see his other mouth, which is currently sucking on your fingers with all the skill of a seasoned succubus
\>he's just about to apologize for keeping it from you, but the second mouth cuts him off, careful not to graze you as he spits out your hand
\>from what you're able to gather of the situation, the belly-mouth represents the darker, more assertive part of the main boy's personality, who is none too happy about having to clam up for that long so his loser of a 'brother' can have a chance with you
\>actually, it's relatively easy to tell that he's mostly mad at being smothered in a stuffy shirt all day while the main boy awkwardly tries and fails to flirt his way into a relationship with yet another a hot guy
\>promises to show you a better time than his other half ever could, and is more than willing to suck your dick right there just due to how little action both of them get
\>two_for_the_price_of_one.PNG
\>main boy is confused, but very glad you're into it. When you move in for a kiss, belly-mouth rips off your pants in his teeth and starts to make good on his promise to blow you
\>things have gotten pretty intense, fast, but you're not going to complain- not while the second mouth gives your dick an impromptu tongue-bath
\>you believe what the belly-mouth said about neither of them getting much action. You can really feel the gratitude through the blowjob, because whatever he's got for 'lips' start curling into a smile once you start getting more into it
\>he's inquisitive at first, just letting his long tongue slather everything it can reach in thick drool, but as he starts figuring out your most sensitive spots, he slurps your genitals, nuts-and-all in and starts working them all at once
\>his tongue is long enough to completely wrap everything from the tip of your glans to the base of your perineum, and sinuous enough that your knees start to buckle almost immediately from the unholy pleasure of it all
\>main boy stops you from falling, and presses you into his moobs so that he can carry you the short distance to the couch without having to interrupt what's going on down below. Once there, he lies back, letting you use his body as a mattress while you both finish up
\>The sensation is weirdly cozy- the main body's touch offers a softer encouragement than the ravenous sucking to the south. He seems content to just rub your back, kiss and nuzzle you while his 'brother' pushes you to one of the fastest, hardest climaxes of your life
\>as the first rope of cum hits his tongue, though, you feel the lower mouth shudder around you, and the scales all over his body erect themselves like goosebumps. A wet-spot on your back and a look of dreamy satisfaction on main boy's face is the only clue that your partner has climaxed merely from the sensation of blowing you
\>the blowjob takes on a gentler quality after that, the belly-mouth happy to 'nurse' from you as long as you'll let him. He whines a little as you pull out, clearly wanting to savor the flavor, but you're too exhausted to do much but cling to your lover's side and pass the fuck out
\>As you wake up, you become acutely aware of an unfamiliar sound emanating from the kitchen, along with an incredible smell. You walk down the hall and the sounds gets clearer until you realize that it's the two demon boys arguing among themselves
\> "I can't believe we did that." comes a whisper "Sex on the first date is usually a big no-no for humans, isn't it?"
\> "Who cares?!" comes a somewhat more raucous reply "Guys that are into both of us come along maybe once a century, in case you forgot- can you blame me for striking while the iron was hot? I was dying of thirst."
\> "God! We came all over his back, didn't we? If he didn't tap out right there, I think I would've died of embarrassment."
\> "It's your fault, you know. You never let me suck our dick anymore, so we get too pent up to last. Just hope he doesn't think we've got a short fuse- that's a bigger problem than anything I could cause."
\> "You, uh... ate his pants. Property destruction isn't something anyone tends to enjoy."
\> "Don't remind me. Cloth fiber is shit to get out of my teeth, and that gross-tasting dye..."
\> "Just let me finish setting the table. A good meal will help everyone calm down."
\> While the conversation has been going on, you've been sneakily checking out what's on offer and it all looks spectacular. The two of them have made you a full English breakfast, or as close as they could approximate with the contents of your fridge- eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and hash browns, all fresh, hot, and in copious amounts. 
\>There's no way you can eat all that, or even half of it, so you cough, trying to draw their attention. As they turn to look at you, you have to stifle a snicker- it looks like they've tied their shirt into a daisy-dukes style crop-top so that belly-mouth can speak more freely, and the main body quickly moves to cover his shame, hiding his face in his hands while his other half tries to explain
\>You just walk up and give them each a good-morning kiss, and they freeze
\>belly-mouth seems to be the most taken aback, he just kind of hangs open, agape, like whatever he has for a brain is buffering
\>they only unfreeze when you take a seat at the table, trying to mask their mutual glee by sitting next to you and shoveling food into their respective mouths
\>The main boy grips his fork so strongly that you worry he might snap it in two, and the sound of his lower lips inhaling another portion, paper plate and all is weirdly endearing
\>For better or worse, they run out of food long before they regain their composure, and take to just watching you for a little while, fidgeting. Finally, the soft-boy speaks again, trying desperately not to go full-spaghetti.
\> "So, uh... how do you like it?" he squeaks, hardly getting a word in edgewise before his other mouth interrupts. 
\>"Well, he's eating it instead of kicking us out, so he can't be too mad. You always did know how to cook- how else do you think I got so big?"
\>At this, he puffs up a little as though trying to entice you to rub him. Wrestling control of the arms from his other half, he hefts himself up and down, letting the jiggle speak for itself.
\> "Better question would be- how does he like us? Would he want another date? Another blowjob?"
\> "You can't just ask-"
\> Heedless of his brother’s objections, belly-mouth continues. "Look, I'm not going to pussyfoot around the issue at hand- we like you. A lot. I need to know if this is a friends-with-benefits sort of situation, or a “ruin you for other men” kind of thing. Things can get more intense from here, if you want. We can do the whole shebang."
\> “Warm nights snuggling until sunup. More good-morning kisses. H-hand holding in p-public.” the upper mouth says, blushing a little more deeply with each word.
\> “Waking up with your dick in my mouth. Eating your ass until you pass out. Letting your flavor seep into my every taste-bud until I’m begging for your ‘secret sauce’ with every meal. Kisses would be nice, too, I guess...”
\>"Would you can it with the sex-talk already? He gets the idea." the upper mouth says anxiously. "S-sex is nice while it lasts, but he needs something m-more to be h-happy long-term."
\> Shifting between sassy and somber, belly-mouth replies "Sex is all I've got, numb-nuts- I'm just a mouth! How else am I supposed to contribute?"
\> "You're not just a mouth. You're an important part of me."
\> Grinning toothily, belly-mouth responds "Aw, suck it up, cream-puff - let's spare Anon the sappy bullshit, and pick this little heart-to-stomach talk back up when we're alone. "
\> As you finish your plate, the nervous, awkward charm seeps back into the air as they start playing with their thumbs and stealing furtive glances at you.
\> "S-so, w-what do you s-say? D-d-do you w-want to d-d-date us?"
\> "I know we weren't exactly what you expected- but I can promise we'll both do our part. I'll handle all things hot-and-heavy while Mr. Pure-as-snow deals with the touchy-feely stuff."
\> You turn to them, unsure who to address, but you answer affirmatively all the same- you'd love to have them as your boyfriend(s). They jolt from their seat, almost knocking the table over with their girth, and you stand up shortly after, drawing them into a hug.
\>They're much warmer than you expected of a reptile, and much more comfortable. His belly conforms effortlessly to your shape, the soft, leathery chub not unlike a foam mattress. 
\>You hear belly-mouth grumbling in resignation so you back off enough to let your hands wander south. The effect is immediate as you start to rub- he's biting his 'lip', thick thighs rubbing together with need. 
\>"F-fuck *me*" he grunts, but you can tell from his tone that he intends it l more as an expression of disbelief than an invitation. His upper half joins the fun, kneading his happy gut until you swear that belly-mouth is practically insensate with contentment.
\> "Told you he was a keeper.", he yawns. "Same time next week?"
