Hyena pack by anon & bara/hmoma writefrien

>Single human in a large hyena pack yet somehow can keep up with all of them and even likes the roughhousing being that rough
>Sometimes the human gets "caught" between 2 or more of his friends who are in the middle of a trivial argument or something as a sort of middle man
>or more accurately, a mix between an impartial middle man judge, and the favorite chew toy everyone pulls at to get it
>And usually followed by the play fight which also includes the human, or sometimes there won't be any petty argument bewteen guys and go straight to the point of playfighting just for the hell of it
>And in a pack that's been together for very long, it's common feelings start to develop, especially when the human has been in the pack basically since the pack started
>So, in pure hyena fashion, they all start trying to court the human, by simply playfighting and play bullying the human way more gentle and softly
>The human on his part though, starts missing when the roughousing was more intense, having had a chilhood in a part of the city with an anthro mayority he liked rough play, and now is yearning again for the bites and claws
>One day the human simply bites the bullet and says the guys he's grown bored of all the too delicate fistbumps to the shoulder and light pushing, to which the hyenas react as if he said he wanted to break up with them
>What happened later was a whole lot of spaghetti spilling with a bunch of muscular hyenas almost on the verge of tears and almost heartbroken asking why he wanted to leave the pack and trying to dissuade him
>And a human only then realizing how what he said could be interpreted wrong and having to calm down a bunch of panicking hyenas all at the same time while explaining he DID reciprocate the feelings but also asking them not to turn down the notches on their roughousing, which to them was feeling like you just said you wanted boiling frozen ice cream
>Longest 3 hours
>The issue is resolved (eventually) and anon feels bad for making the yeens worry. Decides to secretly take a day off work and surprise all of them.
>Starts with the easy stuff, cleaning all of their messy rooms up, arranging the dirty chaos in to regular, pleasant smelling chaos, just how they like it
>Runs through all of their assigned house chores like a machine, by the time anon's off to grab dinner the place is basically in the most pristine state it's seen in years
>Has a mental list of each yeen's favourite meal (it's all some variation of meat dish), painstakingly brings it down to their favorite brands and seasonings
>Chores are done and everything's roasting away in the oven, so anon decides to get a quick shower in before they get home. 
>Stays in just a little too long and has to jog downstairs in his underwear to make sure those honey roasted ribs aren't burning.
>Yeens are feeling a little sensitive after what they dub the "very confusing human" incident. Heads filled with irrational, dumb concerns
>All of them are practically vibrating with imagined fears as they slowly open the front door, expecting to see an empty house and a Dear John letter.
>Instead, the pack opens to be hit by a wall of heavenly scents, anon mixed with the smell of herbs, seasonings and various kinds of meat.
>They slowly walk through the den-home, slack jawed at how well it's been cleaned up, creeping around the house in awed unison.
>Any doubts about anon are vanquished and replaced by a burning heat in their chests when they see the human in nothing but some boxers and an apron, humming happily as he finishes up a buffet of delicious looking food.
>The human cleaning the den while simultaneously providing a delicious meal for them is basically the pinnacle of pack animal courting, and anon's just S-ranked it.
>The normally cliff-faced, rough and no-nonsense pack leader is clutching his chest with a look of absolute adoration
