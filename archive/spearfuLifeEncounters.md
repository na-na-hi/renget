####Accidental Guidance

The Golden Leaves Festival was a grand event that attracted many guests to the city. The grand displays of the wealth possessed by the masters of these lands were focused on their estate and the upper city, but even on the outskirts, where people of lower social standings gathered, the air of festivities filled everyone with cheer.

With one exception. A small group of youths gathered in one of the inns standing by the main road, and discussed something fervently. Except for one, all of them were cultivators. Two of them stood out above the others when it came to their presence. The first was tall and well-built, a beautiful woman sitting beside him rested her head on his broad shoulders. The other was of average height, his features much more delicate, yet the strength of his aura was of no less strength than that of the larger man; an intricately decorated mask adorned his face.

The sole mortal was sitting opposite of them. His clothes, rugged, torn and covered in mud, reflected the dreadful story he was telling. He came from a village that lied not far from here, but a couple li beyond the border separating these lands from those of another sect. His village, and those nearby, were plagued by raids of disciples from a devil sect. The masters of those lands did nothing to help the mortals, too occupied by the fight with the elders of the invaders, that were aiming for their capital, to have resources to spare on a couple minor villages.

And so, the mortal decided to seek help beyond the border. Together with his three brothers, they made their way here, hoping that the masters of this place will hear their plight and decide to lend their aid. He was the only one that made it through the border; his brothers were hunted down by the devil cultivators one by one. 

In the end, all his hopes seem for naught. He wasn't even granted an audience, mortal interests deemed not worthy of attention of even the lowest official in the time of the Festival. In one desperate attempt, he decided to beg anyone he met for help. Thrown from an inn after an inn for disturbing the peace, he finally found some listeners here.

Yet even when they decided to lend an ear to his story, most turned him down. The lack of a reward and the risk of facing members of a devil sect made most of the listeners lose interest. The only one who stayed at the table by the end of the story, were the mortal, the tall man and his wife, and the masked youth. 

And even they seemed to puzzled at what to do. They wanted to help, but were unsure if they could with only them left. A discussion of the possible plans didn't fill them with optimism. All their options seemed risky at best, and doomed to failure at worst.

As the light of last hope seemed to dim in the eyes of the mortal, a man with dark hair covering his eyes approached the table with a cheerful grin painted on his face. A harried looking maid was following in his footsteps.

Seemingly, he listened to the conversation the youths had, and as far as going on such a journey was tempting, he gave in to the pleads of the maid to not leave in such a manner. She claimed that she already failed her masters by letting their esteemed guest wander off from their estate. Letting him leave the city like this would convince her that his departure was caused by her ineptitude at providing him a pleasant stay.

He did however aid the youths in making their decision, by providing them information about a passage that might give their plans a better chance of succeeding, and some words that helped them take the leap:

"Life of a cultivator is too long to spend it filled with regrets of deeds undone."
