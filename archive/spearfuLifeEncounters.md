###Life Encounters of Qiang Wei

####Accidental Guidance
*(Qiang Wei, Yasha, Mei Lan, Xu)*

The Golden Leaves Festival was a grand event that attracted many guests to the city. The grand displays of the wealth possessed by the masters of these lands were focused on their estate and the upper city, but even on the outskirts, where people of lower social standing gathered, the air of festivities filled everyone with cheer.

With one exception. A small group of youths gathered in one of the inns standing by the main road, and discussed something fervently. Except for one, all of them were cultivators. Two of them stood out above the others when it came to their presence. The first was tall and well-built, a beautiful woman sitting beside him rested her head on his broad shoulders. The other was of average height, his features much more delicate, yet the strength of his aura was of no less strength than that of the larger man; an intricately decorated mask adorned his face.

The sole mortal was sitting opposite of them. His clothes, rugged, torn and covered in mud, reflected the dreadful story he was telling. He came from a village that lied not far from here, but a couple li beyond the border separating these lands from those of another sect. His village, and those nearby, were plagued by raids of disciples from a devil sect. The masters of those lands did nothing to help the mortals, too occupied by the fight with the elders of the invaders, that were aiming for their capital, to have resources to spare on a couple of minor villages.

And so, the mortal decided to seek help beyond the border. Together with his three brothers, they made their way here, hoping that the masters of this place will hear their plight and decide to lend their aid. He was the only one who made it through the border; his brothers were hunted down by the devil cultivators one by one. 

In the end, all his hopes seem for naught. He wasn't even granted an audience, mortal interests deemed not worthy of attention of even the lowest official in the time of the Festival. In one desperate attempt, he decided to beg anyone he met for help. Thrown from an inn after an inn for disturbing the peace, he finally found some listeners here.

Yet even when they decided to lend an ear to his story, most turned him down. The lack of a reward and the risk of facing members of a devil sect made most of the listeners lose interest. The only ones who stayed at the table by the end of the story, were the mortal, the tall man and his wife, and the masked youth. 

And even they seemed to puzzled at what to do. They wanted to help, but were unsure if they could with only them left. A discussion of the possible plans didn't fill them with optimism. All their options seemed risky at best, and doomed to failure at worst.

As the light of last hope seemed to dim in the eyes of the mortal, a man with dark hair covering his eyes approached the table with a cheerful grin painted on his face. A harried looking maid was following in his footsteps.

Seemingly, he listened to the conversation the youths had, and as far as going on such a journey was tempting, he gave in to the pleads of the maid to not leave in such a manner. She claimed that she already failed her masters by letting their esteemed guest wander off from their estate. Letting him leave the city like this would convince her that his departure was caused by her ineptitude at providing him a pleasant stay.

He did, however, aid the youths in making their decision, by providing them information about a passage that might give their plans a better chance of succeeding, and some words that helped them take the leap:

"Life of a cultivator is too long to spend it filled with regrets of deeds undone."


 
####Battle Brother
*(Qiang Wei, Yasha, Zheng Hao, Yexin)*


Through a valley overgrown by a bamboo grove, the brave youths made their way beyond the border. Even before they reached any human settlements, they have sensed something hostile about these lands. It was as if the nature itself had become twisted by the aura of cruelty hanging in the air due to the atrocities that had been committed here.

Following directions given to them by the mortal man, they made towards his village. On their way, they witnessed proofs of the devil sect's presence. Rotting corpses of both animals and humans were strewn about the roadside. They passed through desolated settlements bearing the signs of carnage that occurred there. 

By the time they reached their destination, a seed of dread was born in their hearts. However, their will to help the mortals had grown too strong to let the fear sprout. And it seemed the Fate itself supported their endeavour, for it blessed them with unexpected allies: two other young cultivators who helped the village stand up to the devil sect's attack so far.

The first of them was a physician, a young man who was passing through these lands on his travels and, due to his call, was unable to walk by the suffering village and do nothing. He decided to lend his strength in battle to keep the raiders at bay, and his mastery of medicine helped save as many mortal lives as he could. Without him, the village might have been lost already.

The other was a woman, her body altered through some mysterious technique, she carried around herself an aura of a beast. One might think she'd use this situation to prey on the villagers, and instead be surprised to find that she protected them along with the physician. And even more surprised when they find out that one of her main tasks was preparing meals that kept the morale high. She claimed she was just repaying the favour to villagers that shared their house with her when she needed to rest after a battle with devil cultivators who stood in her way.

Yet as valiantly as the two fought so far, doom has been spelled for them. Taking notice of the village's resistance, the devil sect announced that if they do not surrender, more troops will be sent next time to drown the village in blood. The time for the promised assault was tomorrow. The physician saw through the devil sect’s plans, knew that the offer was just there to break their morale, and there was no peaceful way of dealing with the devil. He struggled to come up with some way of resolving this situation, but none of his plans offered anything more than a slim chance of survival for but a few people. That is, until the reinforcements arrived.

With their strengths now doubled, the tactical options greatly opened for the youths. They strategized the whole night, and by the last hour until dusk, their plan was ready to be enacted.

When the devil cultivators arrived, they found the physician and the beast-woman guarding the entrance to the village, like they did so many times until that day. After a perfunctory offer of peace if they submit to the devil sect was rejected, the battle that seemed to be the village's last stand began.

Relying on their number advantage, the devil cultivators charged. They cared little for the traps set on their path, nor the toxic swamp that the beast-woman conjured in their way. Like a wave of termites, they stormed forward, eager to give the virtuous cultivators the death they sought by opposing them.

But when they crossed the village gates, the real trap was sprung. The devil cultivators suddenly were not only facing the two youths in front of them, whom they prepared against, but from the rear and flanks enemies they did not expect encircled them. On one corner of the triangular formation closing around them, a spear wielder with spirits of warriors following behind them, stormed violently into the fray, tearing his path towards the leader of the raiders. On the other, a masked man rode a wave of beasts that trampled all in their path, their charge akin to the revenge the nature itself took for being desecrated.

After the initial shock, the devil cultivators quickly regrouped, and a gruelling battle ensued that lasted for hours. In the end, the streets were painted red, and few houses in the village were left standing, but the virtuous four were triumphant.

It was, however, not the end of their plan. Staying here meant that only another, stronger assault would be sent to finish what this one could not. They needed to move fast, while the devil cultivators were regrouping. It was time to evacuate.

They led the villagers towards the border, hopeful that the devil cultivators would not dare make enemies with the masters of another domain so soon. They made their way as fast as they could, but with the toils of battle still weighting upon them, and with the mortals accompanying them, travelling fast was difficult, even with the masked youth's beast of burden helping as they could. All that was left was to hope that they could make it in time.

The hope had been proven wrong. Another group of devil cultivators had been sent their way, eager to avenge the humiliation they suffered so far. It seemed that they would catch them at the entrance of the bamboo valley. They were so close, they needed just a bit more time to cross the border.

The man with the spear offered to buy them that time. He declared that he’ll stay behind and hold back the chase long enough for the others to make it to safety. Protests were raised, but he would hear none of them, arguing that he was the best suited for that role.

The physician and the beast-woman are the ones the villagers trust the most, for they have been with them the longest, without them their morale, and as a result, the tempo of their march, might drop. Both of them also carried the strain of protecting the village for weeks and were crucial to ensuring the villagers stay safe. The beast-woman seemed a most proficient pathfinder, while the physician had to tend to those that were wounded during the battle. In particular, the masked man had been among them, and besides, controlling the beasts without him could prove difficult.

The man with the spear, because of his defensive combat style, was right now among those in the best physical condition, and his abilities did little to help speed up their journey. The others accepted his sacrifice, and each one granted him a boon that would help him in his endeavour. The physician healed the few wounds he suffered during the combat earlier, ensuring that he will enter his next battle in prime condition. The beast-woman gave him a mysterious pill that was said to enhance one’s bottle prowess. The masked man summoned a tortoise spirit that would help protect him in battle.

Thus equipped, the man with the spear bid farewell to his companions, hoping that they may meet again someday, but not expecting it. He chose the place where he would face his enemies and waited.

In the battle that followed, thanks to the support he received, he experienced the heights of power like he never had before. Many devil cultivators fell to his strikes that day. But behind each one he took down, another two appeared. And what worse, this party consisted not only of disciples. Even an elder of the devil sect appeared in his full glory to ensure that those who opposed them would not escape their punishment.

In place of wounds that the physician closed, new ones had been opened. The tortoise spirit faded; the energy lent to him by the masked man running out. The benefits of the pill were starting to be replaced by the price that one had to pay for using it. Golden blood was pooling among the sea of crimson.

At last, the spear in the man's hands disappeared as if sucked inside him when he fell to the ground. But when the devil elder approached him, he noticed that the man was still breathing, and even in his unconscious state, a smile was spreading on his lips, as if he knew he had fulfilled his goal.

The devil sect did not manage to catch on to the villagers before they crossed the border. The only prize they got was the captured youth, and they planned to make him pay for standing against them.
 
####Flashy Heroics
*(Qiang Wei, Heng Zhiqiang, Leanne Pierpont, Jian, Lei Daiyu)*

The devil sect had their hideout in a complex of caves, and that is where they took the captured youth. He joined their other prisoners in one of the caverns that served as a dungeon. In the weeks he spent there, he had seen many others that fell prey to the devil cultivators, but most of them left as quickly as they arrived, sacrificed in gruesome rituals.

The captors took their time with the spear wielding youth, stretching his torture over many days. He had spent most of it hanging tied to a cavern wall, sharpened stones stabbing into his flesh, causing the gold to stain the floor in regular intervals. The sound of droplets falling, akin to that of a water clock, reminded him of the passage of time. Many times, he attempted to escape to his mind palace, to find the solace in the embrace of his beloved, but the aura permeating the place prevented one from doing so, forcing them to experience the visceral reality.

There was one other man there that did not join the sacrificial lambs the second day after his arrival. In fact, he was there the day the spear wielding youth was first brought in, although he was barely recognizable as a human back then. He was a wielder of a peculiar physique, granting him a resilience that would make one question how he got himself captured in the first place. The devil cultivators took pleasure in abusing it, keeping the man in place by staking him to the floor, leaving him in a shape more similar to that of a torn carcass than that of a living man.

On the days when their tortures were more bearable, either because the devil cultivators were occupied with something else, or were trying to give their prisoners a false sense of hope to crush later, the two men became acquainted with each other. They found some form of commiseration in mutual presence, even if speaking was rarely possible.

But days went on and their futures looked grim. Until at last, the moment the devil sect had seemingly waited for had arrived. When the time of picking the victims for the daily sacrifice had come, the two youths that had lasted so long were dragged out of the cell.

The cavern they were brought into had a circular shape. By the walls, hooded figures stood, ritual daggers in their hands. In the middle, besides two altars, the elder of the sect was sitting on a throne made of human bones. In his hands was a large, richly decorated urn.

The two youths got chained to the altars, and the ritual began. Under the instructions of their leader, the hooded figures began chanting and stepped closer to the centre of the room, the daggers in their hands raised menacingly.

A steady beat of drums filled the chamber, echoing from the cavern walls. At first, it seemed to join the voices, but the suspicion visible on the face of the elder betrayed that it was not something they planned on. As it grew louder, it drowned out the chanting.

Some of the hooded robes started clutching their heads, trying to block the pervasive sound. The weaker among them fell to the floor, blood dripping from their ears. The others tried to get their bearings, seeking the source of the thunderous music, heading towards the exit of the cavern.

The shouts were unable to be heard over the beating drums, but the splatters of blood were enough to alarm the rest of the devil cultivators. When they looked towards their source, their eyes met that of a woman with a sword. The expression on her face was calm, but her aura was that of pure bloodlust. With each step, her blade shot forward, stealing the life of another victim. Her movements were clean and precise, no effort was wasted beyond what was required to deal a murderous blow.

The elder of the devil cultivators held his ground the longest, but the sonic attack created the opening the swordswoman needed, and he joined his disciples on the floor. The urn burst into a thousand pieces, which drifted slowly in the sea of blood that now filled the room. Seeing that her work was over, the woman sheathed her blade and turned towards the exit, paying no mind to the two youths still chained to the altars.

But then two more entered the chamber and she joined them. One of them had green hair, a pair of drumsticks in her hands suggested she was the source of the earlier music. The other was clad in armour, she held a flag in her hands and seemed to lead the group. She was the one who broke the chains holding down the captured youths and asked them to show the way to the other captives.

When the rest of the devil cultivators got eradicated and their prisoners were freed, the three women led the people they saved back to safety beyond the border. They were not unified in the reason for their assault on the devil sect. If asked, one of them would say it was out of a sense of righteousness, the second one would say it was because her sect wanted the urn destroyed, while the third would say she heard the pleas of young cultivators that were forced to leave their ally behind.

Nevertheless, it's thanks to those three women that the youths' paths did not end on those altars. Surely, their strength would serve as an inspiration that would help guide the next steps of their journey.
