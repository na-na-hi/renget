#To The Rescue


#####I. Inigo's Apartment
![Image description](https://i.imgur.com/Sz4whdT.png)
***
Outside his window, the sun had just started to set. The sky was scattered with clouds. It was a day that could easily turn into a sunny day or stormy one.

He sat alone on the couch in his unkempt apartment, his mind filled with thoughts about the upcoming tournament. He had woken up early to come up with ideas about what to do, resulting in- he counted the list - thirty seven match ideas.  He ran his fingers through his hair and shook them in annoyance. Why did he have to fight Hoge in the first round? What if he overdid it? He rubbed the temples at the side of his face in frustration and glanced at Gigan, his green dragon construct, who was busy sunbathing by the window. Gigan wouldn't let her get hurt, he told himself reassuringly. 

His thoughts wandered over to his memory of the incident; the one that led to him getting kicked out from the Dai-Ichi Clan. His quirk had spiraled out of control and his brothers had ended up in the hospital for three months. It took all the quirk healing money could buy to bring them back. Things hadn't been the same between them since then. The image of blood, an overwhelming amount of it, the stench of death haunted him. Gigan burst out of a man's arm? What had happened that night? As far as Inigo knew, Gigan didn't understand or speak any languages, relying solely on its own interpretation of the world through Inigo's perspective. His family believed that their dragons were ancestral kamis, heavenly protectors and spirits sent down to guide them. 

As Inigo frowned, Gigan floated in front of him. Inigo shook his head, his gaze softened. "Nah, I'm not mad at ya, buddy," he reassured the dragon and patted its head, but it felt like he was reassuring himself.  "By the way, just how small can you get?" he asked. Gigan swam in the air in front of him and did a backflip. It gradually diminished until it became nothing more than a speck, barely visible to his eyes. 

"Okay, now," Inigo grinned, "turn into a cross between a triclops, two frogs kissing, and Majestic." Gigan transformed, starting of as a formless blob before taking on the exact appearance Inigo had in his head. It was a flat image. A fuzzy amalgamation of a three-eyed, fat Majestic with amphibian ears engaged in smooching stood before him. Did he imagine this or had Gigan implanted the idea in his head? A sense of déjà vu washed over him, as if he had always known about the form and was just recalling it. The fat Majestic mewed cutely and Inigo burst out laughing. He snapped a photo of it for later. He could post it in the class groupchat.

His mischievous grin widened. "Okay, now become a big hat." Gigan obliged, morphing in a large top hat.

 "Rubber goose," Inigo commanded. Without hesitation, Gigan changed yet again, adapting to the request. 

"Dragon Dog!" Gigan changed into a scaled puppy who started chasing its own tail. 

"Naked Yui!" Gigan began to change, but abruptly halted its transformation, fixing Inigo with a disapproving glare before smacking him on the head with a toy hammer. A distinct squeak followed, as if Gigan was scolding him for his audacity. 

"Okay, okay!" Inigo chuckled, rubbing the spot where Gigan had struck him. "Y'know, one of these days, that's gonna work."

 He turned his head as he heard clanking and footsteps coming from outside. The penthouse door suddenly swung open, and Mercury and Junichi walked inside. Without looking at Inigo, they started rummaging through his drawers and kitchen. "Hey.. do you have any empty bottles?" said Junichi as he pulled a dirty rag out of a cupboard.

"Yeah, and some nails too!" Mercury chuckled. "We're blowing up semi-trucks."

"Good morning, and what the heck?" Inigo asked while checking the time on his phone.

"Getting rid of evidence," Mercury grinned. "You in?"

Inigo stood up and searched for his school bag under a pile of magazines. "Nah, I'm good. I should head to class. How's my hair?"

"Four out of five, boyo!" Mercury gave him a thumbs-up as he picked up some empty bottles under the sink.

"Shabby," Junichi's eyes fixed on Inigo and threw him some hair serum. "Fix it."

"Thanks man," Inigo caught it and began adjusting his hair, using Gigan as a mirror. "I didn't sleep too well last night. It's this tournament at Shiketsu. It's a pain, bro." He watched the two home intruders gather what they found in a small cart. "The first round has me going against Hoge."

"Trouble in paradise eh? Just lose on purpose, dunno why you bother with that hero stuff," said Mercury.

"Kick her ass," Junichi said ,without missing a beat, in a scarily optimistic tone, for him at least. 

"Not helping." Inigo pointed at Junichi who just shrugged. "And I'm pretty sure she'd be pissed if I just lost intentionally. I also told the Boys™ that we're winning from now on."

"You have a close friend group without me in it..?" Junichi asked.

"Yeah uh- my classmates." Inigo felt a chill, as he watched Junichi take a step towards him. "We're supposed to show off how much we've improved in front of a crowd. It's a whole thing." continued Inigo.

Junichi's voice came out cold, his purple eyes glowing, "You know that tournament is just like the UA one... It's a sham to keep heroes at each others throats... A way for Shiketsu to appease its investors and government masters... Look at all these super-quirked-up child soldiers. Look at how we have them on a leash, and make them fight each other. They bow and smile while obeying the system. You're all products..."  

"Dude.." Mercury took a cautionary step away from the bone-manipulating teenager. 

"I dunno bro." Inigo said quietly. He didn't really want to admit it, but Junichi made some sense. He shrugged. Everyone had their motivations and things weren't always what they seemed. The world was a boiling sea of ever-changing lies and demands. His world had been like that for as long as he could remember. There was only one stable truth in his life, and it was "her". He placed a hand on Junichi's shoulder reassuringly. "Look, I'll think about making you one of the Boys™, but Sandy already filled your spot as the tragic brooding one. You're gonna have to find another niche to fill."

Junichi shook his head. "I don't want to join whatever that is.... Just be careful who you trust, they'll all turn on you on a dime..." Inigo nodded and they shared a look. They fist-bumped before returning to what they were doing. 

"I'm gonna head out. Wait- what's a dime?" Inigo said.

"En...."

"Ah gotcha. Save some trucks for me later?"

"Can't promise anything boyo! The boss wants them gone by five. You got any gasoline?"

"Check in the third drawer!"  

"Found it...."

#####II. Shiketsu Academy, Lunch Time,  Room C-71

-> ![Image description](https://i.imgur.com/KAW895X.jpg) <-
***
It was lunch time for the hero students in Shiketsu High. Inigo and Hoge were in a Room C-71. It was originally a small, dusty room, full of boxes of old textbooks. They had cleaned it out over a few days to turn it into a suitable base of operation within the school. Hoge, always resourceful and well-informed, had found this hidden gem of a location on her first week in Shiketsu. She considered it one of her hiding spots that she could go to with very little chance of anyone finding her. 

Inigo, with his eyes shining, proudly placed a handmade paper sign above the door, carefully crafted with black and purple markers to read *"The Doki Doki Misteru Club."* He turned to Hoge, a hopeful grin on his face as he finished taping. "Looks good, right?"

Hoge only glanced up momentarily from eating her prepared lunch, "Don't misunderstand. It's a nice sign, but the school guidelines says unauthorized clubs are prohibited. If we were to be officially a club, we would need two more members, and a member of the faculty willing to oversee club activities." Inigo watched her expression barely change as she spoke softly. She threw orange peels at Gigan, who sat at the table. The small dragon happily chewed on them.

Inigo shrugged nonchalantly. "They won't care. We're in the old halls of the general course. You said nobody comes here right? They won't find us here, plus we're completely alone." His heart raced as he took the seat next to her and pulled out his own lunch. It took him two days to clear out this place and convince her they needed a private place. It would be terrible if he missed his golden opportunity. He winked and slid his chair closer to her, as she started taking out files from her bag. 

"Uh, what do you got there?" 

Hoge had placed several paper folders on the desk, she turned to him and reported her findings. "Inigo. Our lunch time is limited, so let's attend to this first. I've been gathering information on the teachers. The general course teachers seem to be clean of corruption and aren't compromised villains."

"First?" Inigo perked up, but she just kept on talking about the files. He did appreciate Hoge's dedication. She was unsurprisingly very effective in stalking the faculty of the school. In fact he had a suspicion that she was doing that before they found the second package." He settled down next to her.

 Hoge flipped through her meticulously organized notes. "It's possible that everything leads back to the hero course faculty, but we should start from the bottom and work our way up. Easiest targets first."

Inigo spoke out, "Yeah, it's not like we don't have any extra leads either. The packages have stopped showing up. But hey, I've been keeping an eye on the soccer coach and the PE teachers, and none of them seem suspicious either." Inigo had a much more difficult time stalking the teachers, in fact he had decided to just hide in plain sight and talk his way into their houses and lives. He was having dinner with the soccer coach and his family that evening. 

Hoge pointed at a document containing the school's defense system. "Did you do what I said before?"

Inigo nodded. "Yep" He did his best Hoge expression. "I had my uncle place back-up cameras in discrete locations around the school, in case the Night Parade attacks from there."

Inigo's grinned. "By the way, do you think we should recruit more members for this secret club?"

Hoge shook her head, her expression thoughtful. "Who would we invite?"

Inigo pondered for a moment before a spark of an idea ignited within him. "Well, everyone in our class is a hero, right? I'm sure they'd be up for saving the school. How about The Boys and Chris?"

Hoge's response was quick and decisive. "No."

Inigo's face fell, disappointment washing over him. "Oh, come on. They'd be a great addition. We could use their skills."

Hoge sighed softly. "They would just be a distraction. We don't even have any concrete evidence yet. Further more I also have something else prepared." 

Hoge reached into her bag. "Oh yeah, me too!" Inigo looked away to take out a single sheet of paper folded into a small square from his blazer. He unfolded it and turned towards her. 

Inigo froze. They had both turned back at the same time, and he found himself really close to her. He met her liquid dark eyes. In that suspended moment, everything else faded away. The bustling sounds of the school outside, and all that remained were the captivating intensity of Hoge's gaze and the charged atmosphere between them. Inigo's breath hitched in his throat. He dropped the paper he was holding.

Their eyes locked, their faces mere inches apart. Inigo couldn't tear his gaze away from Hoge's soft features, bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sunlight streaming from the window. His eyes darted between Hoge's lips and her entrancing gaze, her outline blurring in his vision as his heart pounded in his chest. The desire to bridge the infinitesimal distance between them and feel the softness of her lips overwhelmed him, engulfing him in a whirlwind of emotions. 

She was gonna move any second now and call him dumb. He expected it, or something will stop them. But she didn't move at all. Without realizing it, Inigo's hand quivered as it reached up to lightly brush a strand of Hoge's hair behind her ear. The electrifying touch, coupled with the palpable tension hanging in the air, made every nerve in his body tingle. 

They both leaned in at the same time, as their faces neared, the sharp ring of the school bell jolted them back to reality, and they looked away from each other. *I'm going to destroy every bell in this school. I'm gonna ask the Five to help me. I swear to god. It'll be my own Night Parade.* A nervous chuckle escaped Inigo's lips as he ran a hand through his hair, trying to regain his composure. His face felt warm. "Well," Inigo stammered.  "I guess we could continue later. Lunchtime's over."

Hoge nodded, her voice barely audible as she responded, "Yes, we should...- " The last part of her sentence got lost in her quirk as she gathered her things and hurried out the door, leaving Inigo alone with his thoughts.

#####III. Training Room B

Inigo and Christopher stood face to face at the spacious training room B, their energy radiating as they prepared to spar. The room was adorned with floating and rotating stone covers, providing ample obstacles for their ranged attacks. Inigo, with a mischievous grin on his face, flew up and kicked several green soccer balls towards Christopher, each one soaring through the air with precision.

As the construct balls whizzed towards him, Christopher retaliated by unleashing powerful ki blasts, his focused gaze fixed on his opponent. The room reverberated with the clash of their abilities. A small crowd of general course students appeared to watch them from outside the room.

"Dude, so you're really not dating Kaylee?" Inigo exclaimed as he ducked a ki-blast, he did a backflip and kicked three soccer balls at Chris from afar. Each ball curved and homed in on his location.

Christopher, concentrating on dodging and countering the incoming construct balls, replied, "Nah, man. That's not happening." 

They circled each other, Christopher flying left, and Inigo riding his construct skateboard to the right, jumping from one stone cover to another.

Inigo called out, "Why not? Sure seems like you've been spending a lot of time with her, and she's hot!"

Chris paused briefly and adjusted his glasses, "She and I are gym bros. She's helping me train. I'd rather not complicate things."

Inigo, twirling in mid-air, summoned more construct balls from Gigan. "Well, Chris, you deserve someone who recognizes how cool you are. So tell me, who do you have your eye on then?" He kicked each ball one by one, placing Gigan on the last one to cause it to enlarge into a boulder. 

"Thanks, and no one. I'm just working on improving myself right now," Chris intensified his blasts, barely destroying the largest construct ball before it exploded in front of him. The blast surged forward, causing Inigo to retreat to the back of the training room. 

"Calling you out on that bro! With how intense you've been training, someone's caught your eye!" Inigo landed on the ground and took off running. "Love changes people. I wouldn't even be in Shiketsu this long if not for Hoge. You know how many times I would've dropped out by now?"

Chris gave chase and rushed towards Inigo. The two friends met and their fists flew, ending with each one grabbing the other's wrists. Chris' ki-enhanced strength met Inigo's brawler armor.  

"I don't know what you mean, man." said Chris.

"That's fine, you don't have to tell me. A little birdie told me you've been sneaking off to the arcade lately. Is it Orochi?" Inigo mused.

"Yes. It's her." Chris uttered without missing a beat. They both flew up in the air, each boy adjusted their stance to get the upperhand.

"That just means it's not her bro! Or it is her, and you're playing mindgames!" 

"Yes, I'm aware of it. The one I have in mind is complicated..." Chris began to lift Inigo up, and freed his hand from the blonde-boy's grasp. He started swinging, Ki-punches colliding and caving Inigo's armor. 

"Why don't you give me a hint? Let your finest general help! You gotta let it out, man. Or it'll eat you up! " Inigo winked and he rolled out of his armor from behind, his armor's consistency turned into that of clay and surged towards Chris, covering him and consuming him inside it.

Inigo started running away, and hid before a pillar. He counted. 1..2..3...4.. A surge of ki blasted out of Chris in every direction as he broke out of the clay cocoon.

 "She's an asshole!" Chris yelled, surprising Inigo with the sudden emotion flashing on the 14-year old's face. Chris scanned the room for Inigo, he started blasting cover left and right. His hair spiked up.

Inigo recalled Gigan and transformed it into a copy of himself. Both Inigo's dashed in opposite directions. "That doesn't really narrow it down! Did the Koreans say something mean to you at the WcDonalds?"

Chris roared and sped forward with his ki, he tackled Inigo into the ground, he seemed almost angry. "It's not them!" He clenched his fist and swung ending it inches from Inigo's grinning face. "I win."

Inigo had his hands behind his head as he whistled behind Chris. "That's not me, bro. But I'll concede, you shouldn't get worked up. Your injury's not fully healed." He placed a calming hand on Chris' shoulder. "We'll have to do this again sometime."

Gigan's form vanished, leaving Chris sitting on the floor. Inigo fist-bumped his friend, and offered a hand to help him up.

"You're right. Good match." Chris grabbed Inigo's hand and they stood together. Gigan flew back to the two boys with two fresh towels. They each grabbed one and started making their way to the water fountain.

"You really got Jugo's quirk down, bro. I'll be rooting for ya." Inigo grinned as he dried his hair.

"Thanks. Have you spoken to Hoge about how you want to approach your match?" Chris drank from the water fountain.

"Nah. I'm getting to it. I wrote down a few ideas I think she'd like. I'll give it to her tomorrow." 

The two boys exited the training room together.

"Hey Chris, you ever feel like lunch time is just too short?"

"Not really. Let's go to that cafe."

"Huh? Sure, but why though?"

"I gotta get better at pinball."

#####IV. Shiketsu Academy, Early Morning,  Room C-71

Inigo's heart pounded in his chest as he entered the room, his mind buzzing with excitement. He had spent the entire night brainstorming ideas for Hoge and their upcoming match in the tournament. Despite almost oversleeping, he had managed to make it to school on time, eager to show her the fruits of his labor. Forty-one ideas, one of them would work to make their match better.

As he stepped inside, his eyes fell upon Hoge, who was standing by the window, bathed in the soft morning light that managed to pierce through the dark clouds outside. She looked beautiful, and for a moment, Inigo couldn't tear his gaze away from her. 

But then, he shook himself out of his reverie and knocked on the already opened door. "G'morning sunshine," he greeted her with his usual cheerful tone.

Hoge turned around, and a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips. "Morning, Inigo. What brings you here so early?"

Inigo grinned ear to ear. "Got some exciting stuff to show you. Forty-one ideas for our match! Brace yourself!"

Hoge's expression shifted, and her voice grew cold. She glanced at the paper he held in his hand and pointed at the first idea. "Idea one, you fill the battle stage with printers?"

Inigo's smile faltered slightly, but he tried to shrug it off. "Yeah, I just thought it'd be cool, you know? Like a callback to that one time!"

Without warning, Hoge tossed the paper aside, and Inigo's heart sank. "We're fighting in equal terms. If you hold back on the match, I'll never talk to you again," she declared, her voice was shaky like she'd been thinking about it too, her eyes shined with determination.

Confusion clouded Inigo's face. "Huh? Why the hell not?"

Her eyes bore into his, searching for something. "I don't want any of your tricks or games. Myoga, you have to take it seriously."

Suddenly he was Myoga again, not Ini, not Inigo, his fake last name felt like he had been punched in the gut. His shoulders slumped, and he took a step back. "No."

Hoge's brows furrowed.

"I said no, I won't do it," Inigo said, his voice felt quiet to him. His hair covered his eyes. "You can't really expect me to hurt you, right? Of course, I'll hold back against someone I lo- someone I really like! It's dumb. As you are now, it's just not fair! It's not an even match."

Hoge's hand balled into a fist, and she stomped her foot in frustration. "Do you think I don't know that? You don't think it's frustrating? Tell me more Mr. Tactician of the Nyoro-clan." she snapped, her voice wavering. "This is my chance to show that I can stand with everyone! And I get you!  How can anyone take me seriously when you won't?" As she spoke, her outlines blurred, as if she was fading away.

Inigo's heart ached at her words. "I do take you seriously!" he insisted, his voice filled with desperation. "That's why I know it's bullshit. It's an arena match, and you're so much better than me in other stuff. Like investigating and stealthing, and- everything else!"

Hoge cut him off, her voice cracking with emotion. "This isn't about that; it's about facing the reality of our training. Sometimes our skills don't match the threat."

This was going the wrong way fast. He glanced at his discarded ideas on the floor. Inigo tried searching for something in her eyes, but she had blurred and was looking away. "I know. Hey, come on..." He reached out a hand, but she poked his chest hard instead.

"No," Hoge declared firmly. "If you hold back on your win, I'll never talk to you again." She repeated herself.

Inigo felt a surge of frustration rising within him. "Hoge, there are other ways!" he yelled. "We've always been a team, supporting each other. Are we really going to throw that away for the sake of this tournament? It feels like what we have is being held hostage here because you're being stubborn!"

Hoge's gaze hardened, and her voice turned icy. "I'm being stubborn? You're being naive and stubborn! "

"Fine. At least I'm not being an asshole! You can't make me do anything. If I want to forfeit that's my choice! And don't talk to me! See if I care!"

The sound of the morning bell ringing filled the room, followed by the rumbling of thunder outside. Inigo couldn't bring himself to look at her as he turned around and walked out the door. He thought of a 42nd idea. He could just not show up at all.

#####IV. Class-1D

Inigo watched the storm outside, his heart heavy with the weight of the recent fight. He moped around. The words exchanged in anger still echoed in his ears. He wondered if he had let his feelings cloud his judgment and hurt someone he cared about. The guilt gnawed at him, but he knew he couldn't let it consume him.  The sound of raindrops against the windowpane matched the rhythm of his stubborn thoughts.

Rosethorn was busy teaching them History when the classroom fell into sudden silence as their rescue teacher, Localoca, knocked on the door. Both teachers left the room to discuss urgent matters, leaving the students curious.

What was Localoca doing here? The only class that Inigo excelled at was his rescue classes. At Shiketsu, there had been an option to enroll in bonus rescue courses for students who foresaw being a rescue hero as their main focus, and Inigo had eagerly taken that opportunity. He scanned the room, his eyes landing on Hiro, Yui, and Noah—his classmates who also participated in the bonus classes. It was mostly learning rescue lingo and procedures too boring or long to include in the normal rescue classes. Inigo's admiration for Localoca had grown with each session, as she managed to keep him engaged not only through her exceptional teaching but also due to her undeniable charm.

Interrupting his thoughts, Localoca suddenly entered the room, calling out Inigo and Noah's names. The room fell silent as all eyes turned to them. She spoke with urgency, "No time to stare boys, it's a code 7J-32."

 The room filled with murmurs. Only the special rescue students were familiar with that code. Inigo and Noah immediately sprang from their desks, ready to follow Localoca's lead. Inigo's gaze darted across the room as they left. There was only one student neurotic enough to read through rescue code procedures that's not even part of their curriculum. He spotted Hoge half-standing. His heart ached, but he shook his head, trying to stay focus. 

Code 7J-32—a remote disaster compounded by harsh weather, involving multiple minors and with fatalities expected.

Inigo and Noah hopped into a waiting helicopter with Localoca. They were both quiet and focused as they got behind a curtain to change into their hero costumes. Localoca wasted no time explaining the dire situation to them. Four children had been playing near the riverbed, and entered a long narrow cave. Due to the weather, they became trapped inside, and sealed off. A fifth child was able to hear their cries and report what happened. Now, they were stuck about 70 meters underground, with a looming landslide threat due to the storm.

The remote villagers refused to evacuate until the children were safely rescued. With the urgency of the situation, Localoca had been granted a special license to bring Inigo and Noah for the rescue mission. Noah for communicating and helping with the villagers, and Inigo for his versatile quirk. It was up to Gigan to rescue those children.  
***
#####V. Gawa Village

As the helicopter approached the village, Inigo and Noah caught sight of the scene unfolding before them. The ferocity of the storm had caused the river to rise dangerously, flooding half of the village already. Yet, despite the imminent danger, the villagers remained, united in their resolve to save the children. They had  managed to retrieve one of the kids through their combined efforts, but the situation was still dire.

Noah turned to Inigo, perhaps his friend had sensed his turmoil, but he gave Inigo a subtle angelic smile."Look at them, Inigo. They refuse to give up, even in the face of danger. Inigo and Noah can't let them down."

Inigo felt thankful; he smiled back and nodded. "You're right, bro. They're counting on us."

Noah glanced back at him. "Noah is thankful. Noah was given this opportunity to help. Would you like to pray with Noah?" He offered a hand, and closed his eyes. Inigo nodded and took Noah's soft hand. The angelic hero began a small prayer as the helicopter began to land.

Inigo wished he had Noah's faith. He felt like a ship without an anchor. On his shoulder, Gigan patted the side of Inigo's neck. *Oh yeah, there's you bud.*

One by one, they disembarked and entered the village. Localoca placed her hands on her hips and turned to them. "Okay sweeties. Remember to maintain situational awareness. Assess the surrounding environment for any potential hazards."

Inigo and Noah nodded. "Copy that," they both said.

They rushed into action. The team split up to carry out their respective roles. Archangel and Localoca approached the villagers, their calming presence helping to ease their fears and convince them to evacuate to a safer location, and leave the rescue attempt to them. Meanwhile, Inigo focused on accessing the cave entrance and the situation inside.

Gigan' eyes glew brightly. "Alright, buddy. Let's see what we're dealing with here," Ryu-kishi said, his voice tinged with excitement. As he approached the cave, there were people covered in mud and bruises still exiting the cave. 

A bald middle-aged man with a scar on his right eye moved to block Inigo. "You're all they sent? Where's the rescue team? They only sent a kid to help us!" Murmurs of agreement came from the crowd. More people blocked his way. "Go home kid! We got it from here."

*Damn. Okay.. How should I handle this.* "Hahaha! Fear not civilians." Inigo placed a hand on his hip. "Ryu-kishi is here to HELP!" As he spoke, Gigan wrapped around him in its dragon form. Scaley mirrors flashed and danced around him, wowing the crowd.  "Amidst the chaos, laughter will be our guiding light! For every frown, I'll turn it upside down! It's time to paint a smile on this situation!"

People cheered, one nerd spoke up and pointed. "Hey aren't those Popsy's lines? He's just copying Popsy."

Inigo cringed inside his helmet, it was a good thing they couldn't see his face. He really was just repeating her lines verbatim from her 2nd anniversary Joker's Jovial Jamboree Extravaganza. He didn't think he'd need his own hero line so soon. Still he had convinced enough of them to let him into the cave. He ignored the nerd as he walked forward. "HAHAHA! Make way please! Danger's afoot!" He cringed. He really hoped no one was recording him.

Glancing back, he saw Noah and Localoca bringing in ferries to begin evacuation. Noah was shining like a beacon in the middle of the town, drawing people towards him. Localoca was skipping through the air, while grabbing people caught in the flood waters.
***
 Inigo stood by the entrance, and aligned his senses with Gigan. He took a deep breath and tried to null his own, the chaotic voices of the crowd became fainter, and the rushing rain felt further away now. He willed his dragon forward into the cave. The villagers had set up ropes and lanterns along the cave walls for 30 meters until it became impossible for an adult to squeeze through the tunnel. Inigo had his eyes closed, he couldn't exactly see what Gigan saw. It was like he was receiving several thoughts every second from their mental connection. It was a blurry jigsaw puzzle, that eventually became a complete picture.

As Gigan moved deeper, it started bumping into the tunnel walls.  *It's too dark. We can't see anything.* Gigan flew back to Inigo at his command. 

"Here, take this." Inigo pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight. He gave it to Gigan, and it swallowed his phone. As it opened its mouth, light flew out from it. "That should do it, go back in there." The dragon nodded and swam in the air towards the entrance. Soon they were about 50 meters deep with Gigan lighting the path.

"H-h-hello? Is anyone there?" A weak voice called out from the darkness ahead. It was one of the boys. Inigo pulled out his burner phone, the one used to contact his uncle and the five, and called his own phone. He video called himself and approached the boy with Gigan. "Hey kid. It's the hero Ryu-kishi here. You're gonna be fine. I'm here to help. What's your name?"

"It's Yuto.. I'm scared..." The kid started tearing up, as he shivered. "I can't move my legs."

Inigo turned Gigan, and saw part of the tunnel had twisted the boy's legs. He had struggled so much that the dirt had caved in on him. "Alright, I'm gonna try something. You're being really brave right now, Yuto." 

Project a confident and professional attitude. That's what the manual said, but what the hell was he supposed to do? He channeled his quirk and wrapped the little boy in a bubble. The legs were tricky, he had to reinforce the ceiling before easing his construct around. 

"Owww! That really hurts!" *Crap* "Sorry Yuto, I'm gonna need you to try to free your legs okay? Kick around on my count. 3. .2.. 1.." Yuto shook his legs and Inigo completed the bubble. "Good job! I got ya now, can ya hold the phone for me." Yuto weakly grabbed the phone and cradled it. "Do you know how far the other two are?"  "Sho.. and Nori.. they went to get our secret treasure out... They're behind the big rock."

Inigo called Gigan out of the tunnel, making sure not to damage the walls. He sensed the crowd grabbing Yuto and cheering as the poor kid got out, but Inigo's mind was already back in the mine. The rain had grown stronger, and he didn't know how much time he had. He willed Gigan forward at full speed. *Damn..* The end of the tunnel of was empty. Nothing here except some slippers, a bag of marbles, and some cola. 

"Hello? Sho! Nori!" Inigo called out using his other phone, trying to see if he'd get a response. He had Gigan do a full rotation slowly. There was no "big rock", it was just dirt everywhere. It was really hard to see. He spun back around to see if he missed anything. Another tunnel perhaps.  "Sho! Nori!? Call out of you're there!" He shouted into his phone, but the reception was weak. Inigo got a frantic tap on his shoulder. He opened his eyes. 

"Huh?" It was Noah, he seemed scared and was yelling about something. Inigo pulled off his connection to Gigan. 

"What did you say!?" Inigo yelled. It was like stepping into a battlefield. The noise of the rain was amplified. There were people screaming, trying to get into two large ferries in the flooding river. A boat full of emergency personnel and Localoca were helping them. 

"Noah said there's a landslide coming! The river is about to flood the village. We have to go!"

"There's still two kids down there!"

"Noah understands! Inigo had tried his best, but you have to save yourself now!"

He heard a voice through Gigan. "Noah.. I need you and Localoca to buy me some time."

"How much time do you need? Noah will ask to divert the landslide."

"As much as you can get." Inigo ran into the cave entrance.Grabbing the rope, he hauled himself into the tunnel, and crawled forward. Mud and rocks scrapped against his hero costume as he inched forward. As he refocused on Gigan, it found the "large rock". It was some sort of metallic war plate left here from the chaos 100 years ago. It might've been from a ship or a plane. 

He recalled Gigan, and used his quirk to expand the tunnel as he crawled. Inigo clenched his teeth as he struggled through the narrow tunnel. The rainwater seeped into the earth, making the ground muddy and slippery. He could feel his muscles strain with each movement. Gigan, still in its dragon form, glowed dimly with his phone inside it, providing the only source of light in the darkness. After what seemed like ages, he found his way to the plate. 

The metallic plate seemed impenetrable, and Inigo's attempts to break through it with Gigan's help had little effect. . With a surge of energy, he pushed against the plate, feeling the strain on his muscles and bones. The plate creaked and groaned under the pressure, but it held firm. Inigo gritted his teeth, refusing to give up. Suddenly, pain shot through Inigo's body as sharp rocks fell and pierced his side. He let out a muffled cry, his vision blurring for a moment. 

Gigan squeaked in concern. "I'm okay," Inigo whispered, his voice strained. "We can't stop now. Keep pushing!"

Inigo continued to push against the plate. The tunnel next to him caved and fell on his shoulder and helmet. The weight on him crunched his right shoulder into an impossible bend and his helmet cracked open. Dirt splattered his vision. Sweat mixed with raindrops on his forehead as he fought.

Finally, with a loud crash, the plate gave way, and Gigan pulled Inigo forward, his body aching. 

*C'mon. Please be safe.* Inigo peered breathlessly into the darkness beyond. He could hear the faint cries of the trapped children. They were huddled together and trapped under a mound of dirt, their faces stained with tears.

"Sho? Nori? It's okay, I'm here now," Inigo put on his trademark grin and reassured them, his voice filled with both exhaustion and relief. "We're going to get you out of here." The two children nodded to him quietly and shivered. 

With the last reserves of his strength, Inigo used his quirk to slowly create a protective bubble around the children, while reinforcing the tunnel. He enlarged the bubble and crawled inside. The tunnel behind them was now flooding fast. Mud mixed with debris came rushing towards them. 

Inigo adjusted the construct bubble, handrills and threads appeared on it. Shovels swung by the side of it like a greek trireme. The cost in stamina threatened to consume him, but adrenaline and pain kept him going. Gigan's form flickered. Their shared stamina was pushed to the breaking point. 

*If we don't make it.. Use what you have to get them out. Promise me, buddy.* 

He should have just enough to get out. The bubble rolled forward. As he urged it forward, Inigo heard an ominous creaking noise. 

**CRRRRRKKKKKK!!!**

The walls around them cracked and collapsed. Earth pushed into them from all sides.  He poured his energy into Gigan. He felt his vision fall into darkness. His body gave out. 
***
He heard the soft faint sound of his phone ringing. He paused for a moment, it was the ringtone he had set specifically for incoming calls from Hoge. She was calling him. Did she want to tell him how stupid his plan was? He wondered what she would've done. Probably a lot better than his plan. He really wished he could apologize. *Sorry, Hoge. I'm going through a tunnel right now.* He smirked. *Baka.* His heart skipped a beat. Desperate arms began to claw through the shadowy mists pulling him into the void. He fought to get his vision back. He heard the children crying. Holding on to him tightly as Gigan struggled to keep its bubble up. Inigo opened his eyes. *Sorry I'm up, let's get out of here bud.* 

Using his newfound strength, he carefully maneuvered them through the now collapsed tunnel, inch by painstaking inch, fighting against fatigue. The sound of the approaching landslide grew louder into a deafening roar. 

Inigo pressed on, he held the children close to him and assured them. "We're close now, we're almost there." 

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they emerged from the cave, greeted by the pouring rain and the worried faces of their rescuers. Inigo collapsed to the ground, his body trembling. Gigan curled up beside him, emitting soft sounds of concern. As he layed there, battered and bruised. Inigo closed his eyes and felt the exhaustion wash over him.

#####VI. Shiketsu Nurse's Room 4


Inigo slowly opened his eyes, his vision blurred, and the throbbing pain in his body intensified. He found himself in the nurse's office, surrounded by the sterile white walls and the faint scent of antiseptic. He wore a medical gown, and both of his arms and one leg were encased in plaster casts, rendering him immobile. As he tried to shift his position, he felt a comforting weight on his chest. 

The rain had passed and he could hear birds chirping outside. How long was he out? He looked to his side and saw Gigan as a green egg. It was out resting too. As he tried to focus his vision, he felt the weight on his chest shift, a blurry and shadowy image that seemed almost demonic. Fear gripped Inigo's heart momentarily until the figure leaned forward, revealing itself to be Hoge. She was straddling his lower chest and looking down at him. "You're the most beautiful paralysis demon ever." is what he wanted to say, but it came out halfway as a muffled groan due to his parched throat.

Hoge leaned in and spoke, "Besides your broken limbs, you have a mild concussion, several bruised ribs, and a sprained wrist. You also have a hairline fracture in your collarbone and some internal bruising." She slowly brought a water bottle to his lips, allowing him to quench his thirst. He drank slowly. "The Doctor had to leave to get his energy back, he said he'll be back to heal you later." Hoge stared at him with her large eyes, he began to feel guilty remembering their fight from before. The tournament didn't seem as important now.

"Hoge, I'm sorry for what I said. I didn't mean any of it. I was just angry and frustrated," Inigo said quietly.

Hoge's smile was like a balm to his soul as she leaned her head against his chest.  "I'm sorry too, Ini," she whispered softly. Inigo turned away and blushed, he gulped and shifted himself. On one hand, the medical gown was not very good for privacy, on the other, he was relived that his junk was still working, and not injured, but that dragon was starting to rise. 

"I read your list of ideas, and idea thirty-three really stood out to me." Hoge said quietly, looking up at him as she circled a finger on his chest. He was glad she was oblivious. 

A mischievous grin spread across Inigo's face, "Ah, you mean the one where we go out in matching bathing suits? I got just the right one."

She poked him on the shoulder again and he winced. "Baka. The one where we train together before the fight," Hoge said, her emotions fluctuating as her outline blurred slightly. "You want to train me to fight against you, and I'll train you to fight me." 

Inigo's face lit up with excitement as he recalled the idea she mentioned. "Oh yeah! That one. Yeah, I thought it might be cool if we sparred. I've picked up a few tricks from the others, and who better to help you fight against me, than me?" He grinned too hard and winced in pain. "Ow. It'll allow us to improve too. You know, It's surprising how easy it is to bring down someone in full armor and wreck their balance when you strike the right places. And don't even get me started on blind spots!" 

Hoge seemed amused as she stared up at him. She simply nodded.

"And I'll go all out on you. Whatever happens, I won't hold anything back. I promise." He chuckled, which made his ribs ache as he began to brag. "I kinda feel bad for the arena though. Have you seen me go all out? I'd destroy the stage. Mega-Super-Sentai Gigandragon! Bahamut Comet!"

"Count me in," Hoge giggled and replied, poking him gently on the shoulder. "But let's not destroy the arena. Some of the equipment are being rented for the tournament, and damaging the owner's property might result in fines from the owner such as- Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it. You need rest."

Inigo's eyes widened, and he pleaded, "No! Stay with me and tell me more about the fines." Hoge nodded. She continued to explain the potential consequences and the importance of asset insurance. As she spoke, Inigo found himself easing up. It's been a good few days all things considered.

Suddenly the door burst opened, and Localoca walked in, behind her were some children and people from the village. "Guess who came to see their hero!" Inigo's heart skipped a beat, and panic surged through his veins. He desperately glanced around, searching for a way to conceal Hoge's presence. Hoge pulled at the sheets under his feet, and Hoge hid by throwing the sheets over herself and Inigo's lower body, camouflaging their intimate position from prying eyes. Inigo glanced at Hoge, who peered at him from beneath the sheets, her eyes shining. 

The children squealed with excitement, their eyes widening as they joined Localoca around his bed. The bald man from the village stepped by the side of the bed and looked down at him. "Ryu-kishi. These children and the whole village owe you and your friend their lives. We came here to express our deepest gratitude." Inigo's cheeks flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and pride. "Sho, Nori, Yuto! What do you say, Sweeties?" Localoca said as she struck a sentai-pose. He watched the children and villagers smile and felt something he's never felt before. He wanted to be a rescue hero even more now, so he can save everyone. "Thank You Ryu-Kishi and Localoca!"

Localoca leaned into Inigo's ear, and whispered. "I'm gonna take them to see Noah in the other room, he's with Sally. Let me know when you two are done, okay?" She winked at him, and quickly ushered everyone out of the room, and closed the door.

Realizing what she said, he tried to get up. "No! Wait!" Inigo tried to roll over to stop her only to fall off the bed.

"Baka." Hoge stood up to help him out. "Do you think she'll tell people?"

"Nah." Inigo grinned, looking up at her. "She's a rescue hero like me, I'm sure she's one of the good ones."

#####VII. Bonus Scene - After Credits

As the warm sun bathed the grassy hillside, casting a golden glow over the landscape, Christopher, Hoge, and Inigo found themselves resting at the summit. Lying side by side, they gazed up at the vast expanse of the sky, where fluffy clouds danced together as if celebrating the end of the storm. They had been grouped together for a presentation, and they had finished it early. It took them less than five minutes. Chris and Hoge were human dictionaries and Gigan was better than any powerpoint software. Inigo was just in it for the ride.

Christopher, pondering: So you're telling me the green guy kidnapped everyone, even me? And forced them into the trolley problem?

Inigo, grinning: His name is Ghoulie Grabber, and yeah! He was helping Drekus.

Hoge: I was naked at some point.

Inigo, nodding: Yeah dude, she was! I was too!

Hoge: GG took all our possessions.

Inigo: Except I still had Gigan, so I called in the Yakuza for help.

Hoge: I searched for an antidote, and took his clothes. Then he had to be registered as a sex offender.

Inigo: She's 15 dude, and there were cameras!

Christopher, confused: What the FUCK?

Hoge, continuing: He kept our clothes after that.

Inigo, exclaiming: I was the Demon King of a new age, bro!

Hoge: He got too horny.

Inigo, chuckling: Oh yeah, and then he comes back again-

Hoge, holding up a finger: We were in space. Ninjas in space.

Inige, excited: FUCKING space, bro!

Hoge: He really wanted us to choose.

Inigo, brooding: But I couldn't choose so things got kinda bad. Took me years to get over it.

Hoge, staring: I killed him when we re-entered Earth. I crashed into the Yamato Basin.

Inigo:  She killed him man. It was her first kill.

Hoge: It was a good one. My choice.

Chris, accusing: Is this a fetish thing? A strange roleplay you two are into?

Inigo: Nah! It really happened.

Hoge, agreeing: It happened.

Inigo: But I built a time machine and erased the timeline with our kids.

Hoge: Everything got reset.

Inigo, excited: You're welcome!

Chris, shaking his head and leaving: I have to go. You two are the weirdest pair.

Inigo: What's his deal?

Hoge: He doesn't remember. None of them do.

Inigo, turning to Hoge: We should prepare our plans in case Ghoulie Grabber returns.

Hoge, serious: Yes. Good idea.
