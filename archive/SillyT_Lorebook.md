# How to Create Lorebooks - by NG
[TOC]

## Scope and Purpose
This is meant to be a light-duty/quick guide written in plain English. Better / more complete documentation links are provided at end. 
This covers Lorebooks as used in Silly Tavern / CHUB, and is based on my experience writing in Turbo 3.5 in mid-2023. 
YMMV, and note these AI are emergent... some of below advice will change in time. 

## What they are
**TLDR: *Lorebooks are long term memory for RP with AI's.* **

The Lorebook just provides additional information about the game's locations, characters, history, items, and other related aspects. They give the AI enriched understanding of the RP's narrative setting, offering background details and context that enhance the immersion and depth of the story. 

Think of them as long term memory for the AI; things that it could recall, but isn't part of the short term memory (aka Context) for the rest of the chat.

## How to use them
**TLDR: *Use Lorebook entries anytime you need to define a place, person, or thing that the AI couldn't generate on its own.* **

Lorebook entries can be used for any new thing that you want to closely define, rather than have the AI generate on its own. But keep in mind AI can generate a lot... for example, do you really need to closely define a "Restaurant?" Or a "Club?" If the setting is really important, then perhaps. If not, it might be better to let the AI fill in the blanks... it's really good at doing that. Random stranger? AI can generate that on the fly. Need the new NPC to be defined? Use a card. 

###Entries
**TLDR: *Entries are called by a word, and have a short definition attached.* **

Lorebook entries work by looking for certain words in the text (the Key), then inserting a lorebook entry when it sees the word. 
Here are some examples from one of my simpler lorebooks: https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/NG/Sylvie

####Example Place
Key
```
clothes store,clothing store
```
Content
```
Place: Clothes Store
Description: Owned by Aurelia. During the day it sells clothing, at night it sells lingerie
```
So, when the AI sees the phrase "clothing store" in the chat, generated by either the AI or the User, it will insert the Content shortly below the most recent message. 
Note that Content *includes* the Key... the Key is not added to the Content that Silly Tavern includes. 
Also note that the Key has 2 names, seperated by a comma with no spaces. Either one of those Key names will call this lorebook entry. 

####Example Person
Key
```
Aurelia
```

Content
```
Name: Aurelia
Occupation: Clothes Store owner
Description: tall woman, big breasts, red eyes, long blonde hair, fashionable
```
Again, when the AI sees Aurelia, it inserts the Content shortly below the most recent message. 
This allows you to add new NPCs to the chat without group chat, and closely define the NPCs. 
Note that this format is open; you could also write it like this: 
Key
```
Aurelia,store owner
```
Content
```
Aurelia is the Clothes Store owner. She is a tall woman with big breasts, red eyes, long blonde hair, and dresses fashionably
```
The above is more or less equivalent. Interestingly, the token count is almost identical because of the need for transitioning words, so I usually use the former as it's easier to organize. Really, any format that works for the cards will work for these lorebooks. 

What's fun about Named NPCs is that the AI engine will drop them where they go. If the AI knows that {{user}} is in at the Clothes Store, and Aurelia works there... Aurelia will appear, and may interact with either {{user}} or {{char}}

####Example of what not to do
Bad example #1
Key
```
Collar
```
Content
```
Collar is a thick leather collar studded with fake jems, and the word "PET" inscribed on it.
```
So... does any of that above information help the AI? Does it matter to the story? 
I did something like above for a lorebook, and realized it was a waste of tokens. The AI doesn't need this information, won't likely use it, and anyway can guess what a collar would look like based on a 1 word definition e.g. decorative collar, stiff collar, thick collar, etc. 
Experiment, and if you don't see the AI using the information, or it doesn't impact the RP... ditch it. 

Bad example #2
Key
```
Club
```
Content
```
Club is a vibrant night club with music, dancing, and lively ambiance. DJ beats, dazzling lights, and drinks flowing. 
People socialize, party, and create memorable experiences. 
```
Above is about 40 tokens and descriptive. So what's wrong with it? 
1. It's AI-redundant. It's literally what ChatAI spit out when I asked for a 50 token nightclub description. Just telling AI "{{user}} went to a night club" would have been enough for the AI to build the above definition, without the need to spend tokens. If you're going to define the Club, add information that the AI wouldn't know, i.e. Brad works there, it's attached to a laundromat, the floor randomly consumes dancers, etc. 
2. Key is too generic; Club could be anything (night club, strip club, book club, etc.). It would be better to give a proper name in this case i.e. HotBoxx, or some such, then define it. 


####Other Examples
Other potential entries: very specific objects, drugs / substances, clothing items, tasks/duties for {{char}}. The list of potentials is endless but note that unless the object is very unique, it may not need a definition... the AI can figure something out. Review other lorebooks for ideas on how authors use them. 

###Recursion
With the above example, note that Aurelia includes Clothes Store. With recursion turned on, if Aurelia is mentioned, Silly Tavern will also pull the lorebook entry for the clothes store as well. 

###Budget
**TLDR: *You have a limited budget. Keep it short.* **

For Silly Tavern, the default Budget for the lorebook is 200 tokens. The point of the lorebook is to only pull in what you need, not the whole thing every time. Ideally, lorebook entries are either short (and you get a few) or long (and you get one.) 
**I generally try to keep lorebook entries under 50 tokens, so that every round Silly Tavern can pull in 3-4 of them, as needed.**
For example, that might be 2 Named NPCs, as well as their surroundings. 

Why not expand the token budget? Well, for Turbo you get about 4000 tokens. That 200 Lorebook budget is fighting for space with your character definition(s), NSFW prompt, JB, Author Notes, etc. What's left goes to Context, and generally more Context = Better ERP. Generally, I've found lower token count is better for several reasons: 
1. AI responds better to tighter / shorter definitions
2. Forces bot author to be efficient... do you really need more?
3. Less tokens = more past chat in Context
4. How many Lore entries do you really need? 
In the future, when Context is larger... 3 won't matter as much but I'd bet 1 and 2 still do. As for 4: if you need 200 tokens to create your lore entry, just make sure your budget supports that. My goal: 3-4 lore entries tops, in a budget of 200 tokens. So lore entries need to be ~50 each. 

###Oddnesses
* You may observe Silly Tavern seems pulling in seemingly uncalled definitions: By default, Sillytavern does not match on word boundaries. That means for example that an entry with the keyword "cat" will match (and include it) when you're talking about caterpillars, scat, education, and so on. There's an option to stop this behavior (*Match whole words*), but you can only set this globally.
