**Face**: Garland has an expressive face, even when he is idle or at rest. A scar resembling claw marks graze the right side of his lower jaw from a wound he obtained in his younger teens. 

**Hair**: Normally long, curly and dark, he does rarely draw it back into a ponytail with a bangs left in front for style.

**Eyes**: Garland has brown eyes but the light gives it a slight golden sheen.

**Height**: He stands a good five feet and eleven inches in bare heels.

**Bodytype**: Garland has a swimmer's physique under the formal suits he often wears.

**Complexion**: His skin is a bit pale, but his expressive nature often balances it out.

**Uniform variation**: He likes to wear long sleeves and anything that doesn't make him look too unkempt. But his relic cloak, which he obtained very early into the year, is a dazzling prize he wears in place of his primary school cloak as a badge of achievement. That said, it is a prize that remains within uniform code.

**Voice**: Well defined, but soft, British accent with a very slight hint of Cockney. Depending on where he wants the conversation to go, he'll usually tailor his words to fit his needs.

**Body language**: Like his voice, he tailors his mannerisms to fit his needs in the moment. However, when he is occupied, mentally or not, his eye contact will rarely turn away from his focus.

**Social**: Who he considers his *true* friends is a rare gift indeed. But that doesn't stop him from affording the common courtesy to those he interacts with. Otherwise, he usually keeps to himself, his goals and his animals.

**Visibility**: Garland is regularly bombastic enough he can be found within earshot... when he wants to be found.

**Engagement**: Garland chooses his engagements. But not before studying you.

**Quirks**: From time to time, a smirk would slowly draw across his face betraying an idea that is almost always clever, dastardly and/or fun. He is big into experimenting and not afraid to break things to get results.

**NOGOs**: A good way to get on his bad side is to force him into humiliating situations or by enforcing his thoughts and actions without good reason. Other than that, he has a flexible nature.

**Animals**: Garland has always had a natural affinity towards animals and this affinity is what has helped him deepen his relationship with an animagus named April Windsley. His abilities to understand creatures' needs is second nature to him, supposedly one he got from his mother. He has, at one point, contemplated trying to become an animagus himself. But not before he learns how to game the outcome.
