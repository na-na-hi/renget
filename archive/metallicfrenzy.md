# Metallic Frenzy

I'm so retarded I want to kill myself.

Amidst my alcoholic stupor and combined with my incessant need to sink to ever lower bottoms it seems that I have made quite a couple of "poor" financial decisions to say the least.

This consisted of the purchasing of the following reddit-tier items:
4 (four) collector’s edition funko pops
A Pac-Man AND Ms.Pac-Man arcade cabinet (it’s not a two-in-one style machine I really did buy two)
A Glock 43 barrel (not only do I not need this but I don’t even have the gun. I am going to take an educated guess here and assume I was trying to buy something for my Glock 30)
An assortment of low-priced garbage nick-nacks that are not worth individually naming but due to the quantity have dealt me the financial equivalent of a kick to the balls
And last but also certainly the most worthless:
A beta copy of Sonic CD
This one purchase, not only did it somehow cost more than both of the arcade cabinets, but it’s also the one that makes the least sense. I despise Sonic CD, I consider it to be the worst classic Sonic game in the quadrilogy (pentalogy?). The levels suck, Sonic’s movement is even worse, this piece of junk is only liked because nobody played it when it came out, and I’m willing to bet that the reason behind that has to do with a little more than just Sega’s braindead decision to make console accessories.

However,

it is a beta copy, and out of all the junk I bought it did come first, so……

I kinda have to play it! I mean look it’s still beta content at the end of the day it’s possible that the game was less bad back then. Also this is literally the only item I bought that I can’t get a refund on so I might as well make every dollar count and play it before I desperately try and sell it back as a meager attempt of even getting back half the money I lost.

So I put the disc into my computer, it surprisingly works (thank you Christ), and after getting past the SEGA screen am greeted to a still image of Sonic with the following words below him:

“TIME ATTACK”

“CD SONIC”

“THE HEDGEHOG”

Fucking stupid Japs don’t even know how to grammar correctly. It’s supposed to be “SONIC CD” not “CD SONIC” you retarded fucking code monkeys.

Getting past both the poorly wooded and looking title screen I press start and am immediately thrown into a luscious mountain-filled terrain surrounded by palm trees with the title of…

“SALAD PLAIN”

What? I mean I get it’s a beta so they eventually changed all this stuff but it’s such a stupid title that I’m even giggling at it a bit.

Besides that initial little change in the zone’s title the three stages themselves of “Salad Plain” as it’s now called are mostly the same. The colors look a little bit brighter and some of the platforms have been moved slightly but otherwise it’s nearly identical to the final version of the game. What’s really interesting are some of the new items, the way Sonic controls, and the special stages.

Scattered throughout each of the levels now are a multitude of item boxes that grant the player various bonuses if destroyed. The first one that I encountered, the time monitor, stops all of time for around thirty seconds or so. Pretty useful for getting past enemies as they become absolutely still, also I find it neat that both the background and timer stop moving while it’s active. Coupled with a pretty groovy jingle while active it’s definitely my favorite one.

The second new item box that I accidentally found while in the second zone of Salad Plain was one with a big “S” on it. The route I had to take to stumble upon was far from the game’s designated route and the powers this box grants reflect that. Invincibility, super speed, being granted a shield even after it’s all over, man is thing busted. Though I do like the occasional power trip this one is a little bit too much for me, especially with how easy the game typically is.

Now onto Sonic’s controls: I love them! Unlike the final version of the game where there’s no reason to use the Super Peel Out when compared to the Spin Dash (which also sucks in Sonic CD but it sucks relatively less), there’s no reason to use the Spin Dash compared to the Super Peel Out. Going lightning fast and absolutely shredding through enemies, the only drawback it now has is that you can’t jump while using it. Too bad that doesn’t really hinder me from spamming the move as much as I can. It’s still a shame the Spin Dash sucks as much as it does in Sonic CD but hey at least I get to have fun demolishing enemies at what feels like mach 7 speed, especially considering there’s no timer to halt my fun.

The final thing I noticed was how the special stages were changed. There’s a couple of interesting changes in how they play with oil spills now being scattered throughout the level, the ufos being mostly a gray color instead of the typical purple, and the ability to stop whenever which makes all these stages extremely trivial. What really stood out however in the most literal sense was the now present giant Eggman head always staring at me from the background. It didn’t do anything, I think, just kinda creeped me out while I was collecting the Time Stones.

Besides all that I mentioned it was still mostly the okayish Green Hill clone that I remember, just under a new name and with some little changes here and there.

One of those tiny changes was in the zone’s boss stage itself. Taking place in the present instead of in the future, I noticed the boss’ colors now being a much more light silver color instead of the typical  red. Though its bumpers were also replaced with splinters I was still able to beat him in a whopping three seconds because simply going to the very far right of the screen at the start of the fight is too genius of a tactic for the 300 iq doctor.

After he was defeated I freed all the plants from their canister thingy and saw the results screen pop out. I was ready to enter Collision Chaos, having accrued in Salad Plain two Time Stones and a heapload of extra lives.

The screen turned black for a couple of seconds and instead of me appearing in a pink vomit zone I was now in a dense roofed forest with various aztecian-esc statues littered about. 

The zone’s title finally popped up.

“DUBIOUS DEPTHS”

I slowly began walking through the forest, admiring the slow waving of the branches and the occasional light that would pop out from the forest for a brief moment. As I continued running through, collecting the occasional pile of rings that lay on the ground, I eventually encountered Amy. Instead of the typical pink her fur was brown, sporting a yellow t-shirt with a green skirt all while wearing a big red bowtie on top of her hair.

Looking between the two of us I saw a pile of leaves in the middle of the ground. I stopped in my tracks and watched as she walked over to me, hearts in her eyes, stopping right as she walked over the leaves. The ground began to shake and as quickly as Amy fell through the pile of leaves into the unknown Metal Sonic appeared from above, staring me down as he levitated in the sky.

His color scheme now sporting a collection of much darker browns, seeing him with only a singular eye felt off and three metallic quills instead of the typical two felt off. As we were having a staredown I was patiently waiting for him to grab Amy from the pit and run off, as would’ve occurred within Collision Chaos. Instead the core of his now much slimmer torso started charging into a bright red as he converted both his arms into barrels and pointed both of them towards me. Two streams of lightning soon emitted from both barrels, revealing the skeleton of my character for a brief second before all my rings scattered around.

I was surprised by how early I was fighting him but was much too concerned with not dying to process it. With adrenaline rushing in my veins I quickly picked up a couple of rings and entered my Super Peel Out, dashing right past him. He soon began to follow from behind, continuing to file hot streaks of lightning from the air as I tried as best as I could to outrun them. It was in this rush that he hit one of the background’s trees, causing it and the rest of the forest to light up, emitting a great smoke that made the two of us unaware of each other's surroundings. 

Blindly running away from both him and the fire, I soon found myself in a cave. Though still a hectic area it was in comparison to that blood pumping rush a moment of tranquility. As I went deep into the cave’s rocky interior I found an assortment of drilling machines and other robotic wildlife: anteaters, antlions, even snakes.

Dodging the cave’s various spikes and jumping from one platform to another, my lack of options forced me to take a leap of faith into a seemingly endless pit. Jumping down, I was luckily saved by a fan at the bottom, pushing me up and landing me mere inches from a pit of robotic snakes.

Cautiously moving from one segment of this seemingly endless cave to another I managed to scour up a shield and enough rings to guarantee my access into the special stage so long as I kept one eye open. With bits of smoke starting to ruin my sight again I knew I was near the end of this treacherous cavern. I made a couple of last minute checks around to see if I could scavenge anything else that would help my sprint towards the end, bid adieu, and exited the cave back into the blinding smoke.

I used my Super Peel Out to again shred through enemies and rush to the end, watching the little bits of the forest that weren’t completely covered with smoke like a hawk. Though the fire continued to crackle and was my biggest impediment towards reaching the end I ironically found peace in its noise. It was the only reason why he hadn’t found me yet.

I got to the end and jumped into the giant ring that awaited me, easily completing both Dubious Depth’s first act and subsequently its special stage, attaining the third Time Stone.

Entering the second act of Dubious Depths zone the fire continues to rage on as I travel through the forest. Various roots emanate from the ground as I see roboticized woodpeckers and flying squirrels glide past me through what little vision I have. Reaching what seems to be a dead end I notice a particularly metallic-looking piece of wood coming off the wall. Activating my Dash, I bust right through the wall into a colossal tree, half-metallic, half organic.

Scurrying through its ginormous hollowed roots the local “wildlife” (how wild is it if it all comes from a factory?) was devouring its innards, slowly replacing every inch of wood with carbonated steel as the fire ate up every piece native to the forest. Though quite grim my voyage through this decaying greenery felt similar to a mere hop, skip, and a jump, especially when compared to my recent passage through the first act. 

Besides this entire zone’s setting, what also occurred to me was the lack of Time Warp signs throughout the entirety of the place. There was no possibility I could try and escape by going into either the future or the past.

Escaping from the tree and now back out in the open the flames were beginning to settle. The smoke had become less dense and the trees, now replaced with heaps of ash, were having their trunks slowly rebuilt with metal. Heading to the end I encountered a couple more pits to jump past and robotic woodpeckers to destroy but with the smoke starting to clear the possibility of me getting electrocuted to death felt probable again. I got to the end, entered the special stage, and came out with my fourth Time Stone.

Three left.

Similar to Salad Plain I entered Dubious Depths’ final act in the present instead of the future. With the smoke now mostly gone I was worried for what awaits me in this now lifeless forest. I easily ran through a couple of loops, got past a few rotating platforms, and collected a handful of rings before being thrown on top of an extravagantly designed yet abandoned aqueduct, infested to the brim with great heaps of plants using its masterful design to reap nutrients as rushing waterfalls fill the background.

Not wanting to get ambushed like last time I took my sweet time strolling through the area, looking in all directions to make sure he didn’t get the jump on me. With the semi-frequent robotic antlion that impeded my progress or the occasional loose platform that forced me to jump back to something stable I was starting to worry that any second he’d swoop down and catch me while I was in a bad spot. My only saving grace there was that he might do so right as I’m near an item box

Nearing what felt like the end of the stage I could still feel my heart pumping with how seemingly guaranteed it felt that he would show up in just a couple of seconds, and yet I let my guard down as soon as I encountered the motorbike.

Seemingly abandoned and combined with such qualities as its comically large singular wheel and being rusted to such an egregious level I initially interpreted it as a bit of a karmic blessing, granted to me from God himself for racking up a sweat throughout this stage. I approached it, jumped up, and headed right towards it with the childish assumption that I’d destroy it in a single blow, be done with this stage, and maybe even receive a celebratory letter in the mail from my bank telling me that the massive amount of credit debt I had accrued a couple of days ago was all gonna be forgiven.

What instead occurred is I hit the motorbike a single time, made it fall over, walked a couple of steps to the right, and promptly noticed a lightning bolt from afar hit it, raising it right back up.

The motorbike, now overcharged, began to rev up as it gave me the vehicular equivalent of a death stare. In spite of how retarded I am I do have some sort of intuition. Without skipping a beat I revved up my own Super Peel Out, sprinting out of there as fast as I humanly could.

Trailing right behind me, the motorbike was getting dangerously close as I had to occasionally break out of my Super Peel Out to avoid crashing face-first into any obstacles. Coupled with the fact that the machine would get struck with lightning every couple of seconds and speed up every this feeling of inevitable doom if I were to continue using the same tactics forced me to get creative.

Approaching a loop, I waited right until I was a third through it before dropping down right above the motorbike and activating my Peel Out to head left instead. Praying that he’d continue to mindlessly go to the right I felt relieved when for the next couple of seconds I saw no trace of the motorbike.

And then I saw who was charging the vehicle.

Literally running straight into him, I get taken aback as my character’s electrocuted from getting too close to him, my rings flying everywhere. As I move around trying to recollect a couple of my rings I notice him now flying more than a couple of inches off the ground as he blasts a jolt of lightning behind me, causing the motorbike I had passed mere moments ago to go hurling in my direction.

Having to now dodge two murderous machines I think up of ways to beat both of them and soon realize that it’s not gonna be possible as of now. With that in mind, I scout around for any nearby item boxes and while sprinting from the two of them find a time monitor a couple of platforms above me.

Coming to a halt I hurry up and begin jumping from one platform to another in a desperate attempt to reach that monitor. Metal Sonic, aware of what I’m trying to do, hits me with a lightning blast, causing me to lose my remaining rings and almost fall to the bottom. Charging up another shot I’m just a fingertip away from the monitor, ready to destroy the box moments as he’s ready to fire at me again. As it all unfolds I beg for a missed shot or an accidental mischarge, just anything to help me get this item, yet all this begging turns out to be pointless.

As time comes to crawl I see Metal Sonic’s bolt of lightning motionlessly hovering right in front of my face. Likewise I see that his motorbike has also stopped moving, the two of them stuck in time. Knowing I’m never gonna get this lucky again I swiftly head to the right towards the zone’s exit, wiping sweat off my forehead.

Funnily enough, now not having to worry about the weird-looking Metal Sonic and his killer motorbike for a second, I notice a couple of rainbows coming from the background as I quickly traverse the aqueduct to get to the other side. Though I sadly don’t have enough time to really appreciate them, seeing how there’s still glimpses of beauty in this ever-increasingly artificial world makes me smile for a bit.

By the time the time monitor runs out I can see the end of the zone peeking from the edges of my purview. I rush past the Goal Post and exit the stage.

Time for Collision Chaos.
