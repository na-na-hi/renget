# Metallic Frenzy

I'm so retarded I want to kill myself.

Amidst my alcoholic stupor and combined with my incessant need to sink to ever lower bottoms it seems that I have made quite a couple of "poor" financial decisions to say the least.

This consisted of the purchasing of the following reddit-tier items:
4 (four) collector’s edition funko pops
A Pac-Man AND Ms.Pac-Man arcade cabinet (it’s not a two-in-one style machine I really did buy two)
A Glock 43 barrel (not only do I not need this but I don’t even have the gun. I am going to take an educated guess here and assume I was trying to buy something for my Glock 30)
An assortment of low-priced garbage nick-nacks that are not worth individually naming but due to the quantity have dealt me the financial equivalent of a kick to the balls
And last but also certainly the most worthless:
A beta copy of Sonic CD
This one purchase, not only did it somehow cost more than both of the arcade cabinets, but it’s also the one that makes the least sense. I despise Sonic CD, I consider it to be the worst classic Sonic game in the quadrilogy (pentalogy?). The levels suck, Sonic’s movement is even worse, this piece of junk is only liked because nobody played it when it came out, and I’m willing to bet that the reason behind that has to do with a little more than just Sega’s braindead decision to make console accessories.

However,

it is a beta copy, and out of all the junk I bought it did come first, so……

I kinda have to play it! I mean look it’s still beta content at the end of the day it’s possible that the game was less bad back then. Also this is literally the only item I bought that I can’t get a refund on so I might as well make every dollar count and play it before I desperately try and sell it back as a meager attempt of even getting back half the money I lost.

So I put the disc into my computer, it surprisingly works (thank you Christ), and after getting past the SEGA screen am greeted to a still image of Sonic with the following words below him:

“TIME ATTACK”

“CD SONIC”

“THE HEDGEHOG”

Fucking stupid Japs don’t even know how to grammar correctly. It’s supposed to be “SONIC CD” not “CD SONIC” you retarded fucking code monkeys.

Getting past both the poorly wooded and looking title screen I press start and am immediately thrown into a luscious mountain-filled terrain surrounded by palm trees with the title of…

“SALAD PLAIN”

What? I mean I get it’s a beta so they eventually changed all this stuff but it’s such a stupid title that I’m even giggling at it a bit.

Besides that initial little change in the zone’s title the three stages themselves of “Salad Plain” as it’s now called are mostly the same. The colors look a little bit brighter and some of the platforms have been moved slightly but otherwise it’s nearly identical to the final version of the game. What’s really interesting are some of the new items, the way Sonic controls, and the special stages.

Scattered throughout each of the levels now are a multitude of item boxes that grant the player various bonuses if destroyed. The first one that I encountered, the time monitor, stops all of time for around twenty seconds or so. Pretty useful for getting past enemies as they become absolutely still, also I find it neat that both the background and timer stop moving while it’s active. Coupled with a pretty groovy jingle while active it’s definitely my favorite one.

The second new item box that I accidentally found while in the second zone of Salad Plain was one with a big “S” on it. The route I had to take to stumble upon was far from the game’s designated route and the powers this box grants reflect that. Invincibility, super speed, being granted a shield even after it’s all over, man is thing busted. Though I do like the occasional power trip this one is a little bit too much for me, especially with how easy the game typically is.

Now onto Sonic’s controls: I love them! Unlike the final version of the game where there’s no reason to use the Super Peel Out when compared to the Spin Dash (which also sucks in Sonic CD but it sucks relatively less), there’s no reason to use the Spin Dash compared to the Super Peel Out. Going lightning fast and absolutely shredding through enemies, the only drawback it now has is that you can’t jump while using it. Too bad that doesn’t really hinder me from spamming the move as much as I can. It’s still a shame the Spin Dash sucks as much as it does in Sonic CD but hey at least I get to have fun demolishing enemies at what feels like mach 7 speed.

The final thing I noticed was how the special stages were changed. There’s a couple of interesting changes in how they play with oil spills now being scattered throughout the level, the ufos being mostly a gray color instead of the typical purple, and the ability to stop whenever which makes all these stages extremely trivial. What really stood out however in the most literal sense was the now present giant Eggman head always staring at me from the background. It didn’t do anything, I think, just kinda creeped me out while I was collecting the Time Stones.

Besides all that I mentioned it was still mostly the okayish Green Hill clone that I remember, just under a new name and with some little changes here and there.

One of those tiny changes was in the zone’s boss stage itself. Taking place in the present instead of in the future, I noticed the boss’ colors now being a much more light silver color instead of the typical  red. Though its bumpers were also replaced with splinters I was still able to beat him in a whopping three seconds because simply going to the very far right of the screen at the start of the fight is too genius of a tactic for the 300 iq doctor.

After he was defeated I freed all the plants from their canister thingy and saw the results screen pop out. I was ready to enter Collision Chaos, having accrued in Salad Plain two Time Stones and a heapload of extra lives.

The screen turned black for a couple of seconds and instead of me appearing in a pink vomit zone I was now in a dense roofed forest with various aztecian-esc statues littered about. 

The zone’s title finally popped up.

“DUBIOUS DEPTHS”

I slowly began walking through the forest, admiring the slow waving of the branches and the occasional light that would pop out from the forest for a brief moment. As I continued walking, collecting the occasional pile of rings that lay on the ground, I eventually encountered Amy, a pile of leaves on the ground in the middle of us. I watched as she walked over to me, hearts in her eyes, stopping right as she walked over the leaves. The ground began to shake and as quickly as Amy fell through the pile of leaves into the unknown Metal Sonic appeared from above, staring me down as he levitated in the sky.

His color scheme now sporting a collection of much darker browns, seeing him with only a singular eye felt off.. As we were having a staredown I was patiently waiting for him to grab Amy from the pit and run off, as would’ve occurred within Collision Chaos. Instead the core of his now much slimmer torso started charging into a bright red as he pointed both of his arms towards me. Two streams of lightning soon emitted from both, revealing the skeleton of my character for a brief second before all my rings scattered around.

I was surprised by how early I was fighting him but was much too concerned with not dying to process it. With adrenaline rushing in my veins I quickly picked up a couple of rings and entered my Super Peel Out, dashing right past him. He soon began to follow from behind, continuing to file hot streaks of lightning from the air as I tried as best as I could to outrun them. It was in this rush that he hit one of the background’s trees, causing it and the rest of the forest to light up, emitting a great smoke that made the two of us unaware of each other's surroundings. 

Blindly running away from both him and the fire, I soon found myself in a cave. Though still a hectic area it was in comparison to that blood pumping rush a moment of tranquility. As I went deep into the cave’s rocky interior I found an assortment of drilling machines and other robotic wildlife: anteaters, antlions, even snakes.
