Baton of Courage
 
Where the heck did you come from?
It all began with those few silly words.
 
It's such a mystery.
With their calming scents, the colorful pastels gathered.
 
On the other side of the road.
At one bus stop away.
We kept passing by each other.
Over many nights of singing the same song, and dreaming the same dream, finally, we have met.
 
Here, let's pass this baton of courage around.
A single step of someone will encourage someone else.
 
Look, our small strengths will be bundled together.
You're not alone, so don't be afraid anymore.
 
The moment the morning sun shined through and woke me up, I get instantly excited.
What should I talk about?
 
The town, the trees, even my footsteps are bouncing.
Together, they blend into a beautiful harmony
 
We were born in different places, and lived in different time, yet we all arrived to this same place like being led by something.
Before we know it, "Miracle" has become something "inevitable".
 
Right now, I want to entrust this baton of courage to someone.
Let's pass it around and around, make a full circle.
 
Even if it's not me, it's fine, as long as someone could cross the goal.
