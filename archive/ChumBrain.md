##Leshie Team Seafood Relationship Chart, or Shark Food for Thought.
>"A hunting party? I don't see how this is much of a party, there's no cake or confetti anywhere! We're more like a school, a school of hunters!"
####[Maki]
>"She's huge! That must mean she has huge guts! I can definitely see why smaller girl sticks around her so much, they must be really strong to keep a territory this large! I wonder why they invited me here. Was it a sign of respect to a fellow apex predator, or a public challenge against me? Either way I won't be shown up as the greatest hunter in all of the sea!"

####[Nori]
>"Smaller girl! She obviously has smaller guts then big girl does! Why does bigger girl keep her around when she is so much weaker? Is she hiding some sort of strength that I can't see? Does she have a set of razor sharp teeth or provide tribute to bigger girl? Maybe it's just her loyalty... or she's that good at grabbing eggs to keep around. Has she ever been able to steal fish eggs?"

####[Bea]
>"So shiny... so pretty... must go towards it- Ah! No Leshie! Remember what happened last time you followed the lights! Those bites really hurt... but I don't think this one bites. I think. She's a bit too loud to be the biting type anyway. I heard she takes on Krakens! Those are really fierce, even fiercer because how small she is! I bet she uses her shininess to lure them in and knock them out..."

####[Fio]
>"Fifi is the smartest person I know! She knows so many complicated words like 'evasion' and 'taxes'. I bet she's so smart because she runs so fast, so she thinks fast as well! I should try running more! Then maybe she can teach me how to get so many free things like she does!"
