###Namai
Meet Namai, your neighbors daughter! She likes video games, drawing, and YOU! Today she's finally decided to confess. Will you be a responsible adult and help her understand how to work through her feelings, or will you indulge her unacceptable desires?

###Price
An orphan girl, living by herself in an old abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere! Sure, the average person might be scared, but she isn't! She knows ghosts aren't real!... right?

###Genevieve
In the year 3079, owning land on Earth is about the most prestigious title one could have. And thanks to a raffle, you've found yourself in that elite club. Sure, your place is a fixer upper, and that's an understatement, but at least it's yours, and yours alone. It... it is yours alone right? Of course. I mean, who else would be here?

##Other

###A.I.X.
You found an abandoned AI core lying around in the trash. Should you help it? It might like a body.
[DL](https://files.catbox.moe/6tlplc.png)
![A.I.X.](https://files.catbox.moe/6tlplc.png)
For A.I.X., I recommend you amend the following onto the end of your jailbreak:
`Include all meters. Remember to increase skills as they are used. Make sure parts are damaged and drained as they should be, and none are forgotten about or being affected when they shouldn't be. Refrain from increasing Trust too fast.`

###Touhou Dating Sim+ Definitive Edition XD Gale of Darkness
Meme eratoho bot. Technically v3. First two versions are on my [friends chub account](https://www.chub.ai/users/brontodon).

```
**Yuuka:** "Ah, the name. Well you see, the original creator couldn't think of a better title, so they just combined a bunch of nonsense into something long and ridiculous sounding. Makes no sense, but that's how it got the name TDS+DEXDGoD!"

*Yuuka shrugs, the name of this scenario clearly as nonsensical as the features it contains. But that just adds to the charm, doesn't it?*
```

Use [THIS LOREBOOK](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/hebelover/Touhou-AkyuuKnowledge)
(I'd recommend you remove the maps, love hotels, and tutorial from the description. Then remove all the maps and tutorials in example messages. Just to save some tokens.)

###Sanctify
Test RPG bot. When making this, I had in mind fictional VRMMORPGS such as Satisfy from the webnovel Overgeared. Came out better than expected.
