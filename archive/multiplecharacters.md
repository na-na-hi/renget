	A man of good taste. Like the other Anon said, most multiple-character cards are coom. I tried to get cards that weren't coom-focused, while also having clearly-defined characters in their definitions.

##### 2 characters.

Now, I'm gonna take the chance to shill some botmakers:

- [x] https://chub.ai/users/Antonius
Antonius has made at least fifteen "Multiple Characters" bots. Check them all out.
- [x] https://chub.ai/users/Nyatalanta
Nyatalanta has made at least seven "Multiple Characters" bots. Again, check them out.
- [x] https://chub.ai/users/theroyalwe
theroyalwe has also made at least seven "Multiple Characters" bots.
- [x] https://chub.ai/users/creamsan
Creamsan has made at least four "Multiple Characters" bots. I highly recommend all of them.
- [x] https://chub.ai/users/fireguns
Fireguns has also made at least four "Multiple Characters" bots, and I also highly recommend all of them. Here is my [favorite](https://chub.ai/characters/fireguns/operation-snowfall-097d5b28), and you can try the [fork](https://chub.ai/characters/Anonymous/fork-operation-snowfall-f89ad4d3) of it, too. 

Lastly,
- [x] https://pikamansu.neocities.org/charactercards
Pikamansu has only made two "Multiple Characters" bots, to my knowledge, but they are **top-notch**. Get "A.A" on the page I just linked, and /definitely/ get [MaidXOR](https://pikamansu.neocities.org/maidxor).
