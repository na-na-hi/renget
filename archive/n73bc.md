AVATAR RESOURCES
Free:
https://mmda.booru.org/
https://vrcmods.com/ (tons of really shitty ones)
https://p3dm.ru/files/ (game rips)
https://www.models-resource.com/ (game rips)
https://www.deviantart.com/ (Search MMD or XPS, again you have to filter a lot of shitty OCs)
Search for "waifu sex simulator". The actual "game" is a shitty MMD viewer but you can grab the stolen models from it.

---------- Avatar 3.0 TUTORIALS ------------
HIGHLY recommend that you first watch Sippbox's 3.0 avatar mini tutorial videos up to his 4th one(included) and go along with them with some dummy avatar example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxnjgvWyqQI&list=PLt8qiEFqNHFkPqpKLnVRx-G78mGvjPbFt
These videos are very short but very informative and should give you a basic foundation on how 3.0 stuff works. And they're very short too(first 4 videos combined are like just 5 minutes)
