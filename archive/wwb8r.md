The Daughter of Breton Nobility, she was a poor excuse for a daughter: an ungraceful and bookish girl with a big mouth that spoke little charm.  She is a devourer of information: culture, religion, history, anything to learn she will seek out.  By the age of 16, she was appropriating her dynasties funds to use a technique she called "Ink-Block Auto-transcription" to rapidly print books: These were rapidly torn down as "Daedric Artifice".  Her other spending sprees met similar fates in everything from trying to cut open and study dead bodies to ordering very small staffs of strange shapes with very esoteric functions.  
She was exiled to the Heartland of the empire after one of her inventions, a wooden fireball staff made to specifically make an intense explosion at one small, localized point which was at the far end of a thin reinforced pipe went off during a meeting of her parents allies and convinced them they were under attack by battlemages.  She would continue her research for years, at some point suffering some kind of accident which resulted in her wearing face coverings at all times.  
When an oblivion gate opened up at her towns doorstep, she offered the guards and any willing citizens the fruits of decades of noisy and unprofitable research: A hand-held cannon which used destruction magic to fire a small lead ball at high speeds up to medium range.  While the towns archers scoffed at the complicated device, the common folk took to its use after their fear was turned into actionable survival instinct.  While the fighting was fierce, the last stand held at the church managed to buy enough time for a group of heroic scavengers to pinch the dremora horde between the townsfolk's lead volleys and their own well-honed blades.
Throughout all of this, Isabelene had been acting under the authority of captain of the guard to act with free reign in the defense effort.  After the battle was over and the oblivion gate closed by the adventurers, Isabelene had a private talk with the guard captain: Through some magic combination of words, she had convinced the greatest man of authority that under her rule she could do more than just defend towns.  Nor did she just want to rebuild, as her goals were much loftier: to restore the authority of the empire, with authority founded on the mass use of her magitech inventions.

In Isabelene's head are visions of cities connected by flying machines which fly alongside the birds, of aqueducts which remove the need for public wells, of buildings made of alteration-enhanced clay.  The future is not one to be ruled by the mage, the warrior, or the king: but the innovator who can fuse those skills together.  She currently presses her very tenuous claim to the imperial power structure from the town of Jackon.
