>go to the furbar
>loudly order fuzzy navels and wink at everyone all night
>go home alone
>cry

>try the reptile bar next door
>loudly proclaim that you have a lot of body heat to share
>start hugging the reptiles around you to demonstrate
>alligator bouncer grabs you by your shirt and pants, carrying you like luggage
>tosses you out on your ass on the hard concrete pavement
>go home to tend to your scraped up arms and legs
>guess you'll spend another night hugging your bodypillow

>in a fit of desperation, try the human bar at the end of the street
>immediate silence and staring as soon as you open the door
>turn 360 degrees and walk away

>try one of the bars where all the trashy anthros hang out
>aggressively flirt with everyone in attempt not to go to bed alone tonight
>it was your payday today, so you show off your fat wad of cash and start offering to buy drinks for anybody who'll talk to you
>most take advantage, though they just nod and listen without saying much
>none of them want to go home with you
>except one, a raccoon
>he seems interested in you, even engaging when you chat with him
>he even seems to enjoy your flirting
>take him to your home
>things get hot and heavy as the two of you start making out in the bedroom
>God, it feels good to touch someone
>says he wants to tie you up to make things more interesting
>eager to please, you agree
>he ties you to your bed with some rope he had on hand
>seductively tells you he'll be right back and goes to your bathroom
>when he comes out he's fully clothed
>ask him why he put his clothes on in confusion
>he doesn't say anything, he briskly walks to your dresser and takes all the money you have in your wallet
>then he walks out of your bedroom
>you hear the front door open and then close indicating that he's left your house
>spend hours trying to get yourself untied
>your muscles are sore, your legs cramped from being tied
>you even have rope burns on your wrists from struggling to get free
>its too embarrassing of an incident to call the police so you don't report it
>the thing that sticks with you the most is that he didn't even say goodbye

>living with a buff canine roommate
>the sight of him gets me hot and bothered
>so much so that I masturbate more than usual
>roommate can smell my arousal and my after coom musk due to his canine nose
>pretty much tells me the next week outright that he's moving to another dorm because he can constantly smell my horny and cums
>too much of my spaghetti is already spilled to stop him
>cry myself to sleep at night over the loss and having to pay the full rent

>be poorfag, live in the city
>don't have a car, so I use the bus to get to where I need to go
>I'm sitting in a seat next to this skinny yet fit looking cheetah dude
>dude's in his exercise clothes, he must be going to the gym
>wanna stare but don't want to be seen as a creep who ogles random guys on the bus
>occupy myself by browsing my phone while pretending not to notice him
>distract myself by looking up my favorite anime
>cheetah guy notices what I'm looking at
>get kind of embarrassed and a little self-conscious
>think he's going to make fun of me for being a grown man who watches cartoons
>surprisingly he smiles at me and tells me it's one of his favorite shows too
>we get to talking about the show, discussing the characters, which one's our favorite, ect.
>he's actually a cool, friendly dude
>feel less intimidated by this attractive cheetah the more we talk
>start talking about ourselves, where we're going, that type of stuff
>turns out we have more in common than just the show
>he likes geeky things like fantasy, anime, and RPGs
>we talk so long that he almost doesn't notice his stop is coming up
>quickly he tells me we should exchange numbers
>my heart leaps at the chance to meet him again
>I belt out my number while he adds me as a contact
>he goes to tell me his number, looking at my screen to make sure I've got it right
>I do so, and exit to my home screen
>I forgot that my home screen pic is of a huge muscled leopard anthro with his tongue hanging out
>he's bent over and spreading his asscheeks to reveal his tight asshole
>it's right there, in plain sight for me and the cheetah guy
>his expression melds from surprise to shock and to poorly hidden disgust as he looks at me, I canhardlyu meet his gaze as I quickly put away my phone
>before I can stutter out an apology, he says awkwardly that he'll see me later in a tone that indicates he will definitely not see me later
>he gets off at his stop, walking away from me rather quickly
>I get off at the next stop to cry and smoke
>don't feel like going anywhere anymore so I decide to walk home and drink myself to death when I get there

>after several bar failures you're more desparate than ever
>Amazon's gonna take too long, you're gonna get a sex doll TODAY
>use the car you're borrowing from your dad after the bus incident
>closest shop is pretty far, better take the freeway
>traffic of course, is shit
>after an hour or two, you get there
>too embarassed to talk to anybody, you quickly head for the sex doll section
>look at the anthro dolls, selection sucks, like really sucks
>looks like the fur is made from cheap shaggy carpet
>all of them are stiff, and have this weird open mouth gape and rubber teeth for added "pleasure"
>the only one that looks semi-passable is the cheetah doll
>fuck it, throw down some money for the thing
>dreading getting back on the freeway because traffic
>but you have an idea, you put the sex doll in the passenger seat so you can use the HOV lane and bypass most of the traffic
>things go smoothly for a while
>suddenly sirens, a cop wants you to pull over
>shit shit shit this was a bad idea
>anticipate the incoming embarrassment as you pull over
>cop steps out of the car, and heads over to your vehicle
>look at him from the rear view mirror
>he looks familiar, but you can't quite place him
>nervously wait for him to walk up while trying to figure out who he is
>it's the cheetah guy, the one from the bus
>your heart drops when you come to the sudden realization
>he walks up to your window and looks to you and the sex doll in the passenger seat, then back to you
>his face screwed into an unreadable expression
>he begins writing you a ticket, saying nothing the whole time
>You just want to die right now
>he hands you the ticket, tells you to stay out of the HOV lane and put away the sex doll
>stutter out that you will and you'll never do it again
>before leaving he erases any doubt that he recognizes you by saying "Stick to the bus next time."
>you feel like your head's going to explore right this second
>drive home fighting the urge to drive head first into a concrete wall
