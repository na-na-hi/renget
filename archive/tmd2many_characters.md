### Sparks ♂
Sparks was found by the guild when he showed up one day. Unable to remember a single thing about the life before him, he's decided to dedicate this new life to adventuring. While having the tendency to easily become lost without directions, he's elected to learn how to use the Wonder Maps to guide his way when delving deep into the dungeons. He's made great friends with the other members of Team Shock... and they're always first into battle!

#### Badge Ranks
Below are the things you'll need to replace the badges when you increase your badge rank. 
Also, no, the Hyper Rank replacing Ace Rank is not a typo. It's really weird that the badge appearance quality has a downgrade before reaching Master Rank.

#### Level Table
Below are the levels. Increases in level bonuses have been ==marked== for your convenience. You start with 1 Stat Point you can freely distribute anywhere, separate from your Species' Bonus Stat.
For a rule of thumb: 
- HP increases every 3 levels. 
- Stat Points increase every 4 levels.
- As you level up, you gain a passive bonus to both offensive and defensive stats.
