Hi, so quick introduction my name is Charlie im 24 years old and in the moment i'm writing this i found something very odd in my Mario Party DS copy, so for context i found my DSi in my mothers place,so after years of not playing it, i decided to boot it up to recall the old memories,i've never encountered this when i was a kid playing the game,but there's some strange creature that just follows me around and every time i complete a minigame it gets closer and closer.

to be fair this copy of the game came in those pirated all in one DS cartridges so maybe it was modded and i just didn't see the creature before? I hope its remnants of a scrapped feature or a dev that went crazy and hid this in the game. It would be really sick, I could get my 15 minutes of fame with this or sum.
I'm gonna let him get me to see what happens, but to be honest I'm really creeped out LOL.

I don't remember typing any of this, i found this text file on my pc and i remember nothing, i talked with my brother to see if he was on my computer but he denied it, he might be pulling a prank on me, but i do remember waking up with my DSi besides me, i might be having a psychotic episode or something i need to talk about this with my psychologist, idk im just very confused right now. Tho i'm going to check the game to see if this is real, i know it sounds crazy but it's the least i can do at the moment.
Ok so i've been playing for a few minutes, and i just saw it, i'm gonna try and get to the second level and see what happens.

What is this? I don't remember any of this, I just remember falling asleep playing Mario Party DS and waking up, apparently I missed an appointment with my psychologist? I don't remember ever having a psychologist, then i forgot my brothers name i spent like 20 minutes trying to remember my brothers name im so confused i dont know whats happening i don't remember any of this happening to me, and now theres a fucked up demon or something in my game, i feel like im going insane but the pictures are right there i cant believe any of this.
But I have to see if this is real.
Just saw it, i'm not losing my mind it seems or maybe i'm hallucinating this, i don't know, but i need to search more things abt this, i think it's the only thing i have now, im gonna commit to the objective i had before, get to the second level of the game,the creature it's getting pretty close to me,but im gonna try to get to the boss at least.

I just entered the boss fight and the game seems to be completely broken. It's really odd because I can move the camera. At this point I'm getting completely out of bounds and if i move the camera in a certain angle I can see what seems to be eyes, a knight, a dog?

and i could record this audio that was playing the whole time, i tried to record the gameplay too but the recording came out completely black. https://files.catbox.moe/u53p7z.wav
i don't know what this is it's just abominations i think i'm having a panic attack right now i can't comprehend any of this what is 

So i just found this text file in my computer i don't know what this is, i don't remember having a brother and my name is Mike, but according to this my name is Charlie i woke up on my bed with my DS besides me and my phone was blasting apparently i missed 2 appointments with my psychologist and a dinner with my family i don't remember any of this, everyone is calling me Charlie i don't know who i am i dont know whats going on, i dont remember my mothers face i dont remember my own brother i dont remember anything i feel like im losing my mind and according to this text its fault of this fucking game.
I'm going to destroy it, there's nothing else I can do.
Bye.
