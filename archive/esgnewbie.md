######What is Eversoul?
A comfy harem idle gacha where all the girls are for (you).  Dailies are quick and everything is sweepable, taking around 10 minutes.  You can touch soul's boobs in the menu, if you want.

######Is this game f2p friendly?
Extremely.  You'll get about 10 pulls daily just on the friend and normal banner.  It takes 56,700 gems to pull 300 times on a banner, which is generally enough to Origin a unit.  You can get around 30k gems a month as an f2p player, more in the early game when there's many progression rewards to be had.  All skins are free and high quality.  Banners are 3 weeks, and multiple units are re-run during each event.  Raid and PvP rewards are rather flat, you'll get nearly the same rewards whether you tryhard or not.  You also get a 10 pull for every unit's birthday, with 56 units and a new one every 3 weeks, this happens pretty often.

######Which server should I choose?
Most people here play on the NA/Europe server, we have two NA guilds: Pits and Jammies.  Add /esg/ to your profile or post in the thread when you apply so the leaders know you come from here.  Guilds unlock after battlefront 2-25.

######Should I reroll?
You shouldn't need to, unless your rolls are especially terrible.  This game requires many copies of a unit to reach max power, and you'll need the fodder units from your rolls anyways.  You'll get an infinite reroll at the end of the tutorial so you can get 1 copy of whatever unit you want to start with (except angels or demons).  You should quickly have enough gems to do 300 rolls on your self-select banner, and hopefully you have 8+ copies of your target unit at that point.

######Who should I roll for?
On the infinite reroll the strongest unit you can aim for is Daphne.  She's super useful even with a single copy.  Honglan can also be quite useful with a single copy, if you like her better.  You can select a starter banner to roll on for 14 days that lets you pick from Mephistopheles, Aki, Jiho, Honglan, Erika, or Velanna.  The strongest choice here is Aki.  She is top tier in nearly every aspect of the game.  You'll want to get 8 copies of her with your first 300 rolls on the banner, and 4 of those copies will be guaranteed from the mileage rewards.  Velanna is also a strong choice when starting the game, but doesn't have the ability to compete later in raids and event content like Aki does.

######What other units are strong besides Aki?
Be on the lookout for copies of Catherine, Jiho, Linzy, Mephistopheles, Honglan, Clara, Daphne, Talia, Vivienne, Velanna, Garnet, Nini, Prim, Petra.  These units are universally used in almost all content.  Claudia too but she's an angel unit, and angel/demon units have a much lower spook chance, so you aren't going to incidentally origin her off banner.  Other units that are strong but a bit niche include: Adrianne(Angel), Lizelotte(Demon), Ayame(Demon), Naiah, Miriam, Jacqueline, Haru, Soonie, Aira, Violette, and Cherrie.

######Who do I roll for on the type summon?
Currently, Humans and Faeries have the strongest overall rosters, so I would recommend rolling on those days.

######Who do I level?
You'll only want to level 5 units, as this game has a level sync function.  To not be walled you'll need those 5 units to be origined, so you'll need 8 copies each eventually.  You may want to try and spread out the units you're leveling between races, so you don't get stuck looking for fodder for one race.

######Which Zodiac do I use?
Get the three for gold, mana dust, and mana crystals first, select the crystals one as your Zodiac Blessing.  Crystals are the primary leveling wall until around level 280, at which point, you'll want to switch over to mana dust.

######What do I buy from the shop?
- General Shop -
Buy the mana crystals for gold from every day until you hit the dust wall.  They're more important than leveling keepsakes (the other gold sink).
- Release Shop -
Buy the soul memories, the enhance circuits are for whales.
- Labyrinth Shop -
It's probably best to buy the memories here too, unless you need more copies of Adrianne, Catherine, Haru, Nicole, or Prim.  The soul choices here and in the arena shop have never rotated, so you don't have to worry about holding on to your coins for new choices.
- Town Shop -
Buy anything that adds +idle resources first.  After that you want to buy the stat buildings.  Then just buy decorations to level your town and make it cute.
- Guild Shop - 
You probably want to save your coins here to buy Eternal+ set keepsakes to finish out set bonuses.  You can buy the origin molds if you're desperate.
- Arena Shop -
More soul memories, or Ayame, Jade, Clara, Chloe, or Jacqueline if you want copies of them.
- Artifact Shop -
Buy the shards for the Souls/Artifacts you use, and probably pick up Clara's artifact, Cornucopia, any time it comes across the shop.  She gets a teamwide debuff cleanse at Legendary+ that most raid teams will need.  Talia and Prim have this by default.
- Evil Soul Shop -
Often the Mold Selection Chest (Origin) is your best bet here.  Though if you're swimming in molds and just waiting on eternal+ set keepsakes anyways, the keepsake stones or summon tickets aren't a bad value.
- Alliance Shop -
Buy circuits for your DPS units mainly (Caster or Striker) but you'll probably want to spread these around as there's diminishing returns leveling these.

######I want to spend money on the game, what should I buy?
The $1 starter pack has great value, plus buying anything for the first time gets you a copy of Taila.
After that the growth pack gives a ton of raw gems for clearing battlefront stages, once you're further in the game.
Often they run special limited packs that give 20 pulls for $4 that are a great value.

As for repeatable things you can buy, the highest value will be the monthly subs.  Both give high gem value per dollar, and add a few extra abilities that can be helpful, like the free daily shop reset, the extra expedition, the free quick hunt, and the free soul level reset.
Then I would recommend the gold ticket for the current event.  It gives a bunch of gems, pickup tickets, normal tickets, epic soul memories, progression materials, a decor building, and a stat building for one of the event characters.
At this point, the value of spending starts to drop significantly.  The gold ticket for the soul pass can give a lot of progression materials but not a ton of gems.  The pick-up packs for the current banner have a decent value too.  I would only recommend the event packs if its the last day of an event and you're on the cusp of pulling one of the high value event rewards, like the 40x artifact tickets.  The regular packs and raw everstones are whale bait, don't buy those.


######Are there sparks or pity, how does the pity system work?
There mileage rewards that give static rewards at certain numbers of rolls on a banner:
- 40	- 10 pickup tickets
- 80	- copy of banner unit
- 120	- 100 artifact shards for banner unit
- 160	- 20 pickup tickets
- 200 - copy of banner unit
- 250 - 30 rare fodder of banner unit's race (or another copy of the unit on demon/angel banners)
- 300 - two copies of the banner unit
Past that, you get another guaranteed copy of the banner unit every 100 pulls.  You need 8 copies to origin a normal unit, and 14 to origin an angel or demon.  With 4 units guaranteed in the first 300 pulls, you don't have to be particularly lucky to origin a unit cheaply.  You can get 300 pulls in less than 2 months with renewable rewards, It's quite f2p friendly.

######Do pickup/normal/artifact/alchemy tickets expire?
No.

######How do I know what's coming?
They post roadmaps quarterly, near the end of each quarter.  Ask in the thread and someone will post the current one for you.

######How should I level up my units?
Generally you want to level up 5 units equally in the level sync, but sometimes pumping levels into a good hypercarry like Aki or Velanna will let you push further in battlefront, to a point (when it starts requiring multiple teams).

######Can I brick myself?
No.  There aren't any weird breakpoints where characters become worse by upgrading or leveling them.

######Are there any limited units?
No, you can get any character from any banner, but angel and demon units are more rare.  You can select any unit you want with the alchemy summons, but they're whale bait outside of the free or event discounted alchemy tickets.

######Do I get any free units?
You'll get Linzy at the start of the game, Chloe, Clara, Rebecca, and another copy of Linzy from clearing early battlefront stages.  There's a free Seeha and Mephistopheles in the starter bootcamp rewards.

######Is it worth taking a unit to Origin+5?
The stat difference between Origin and Origin+5 is around 21% in each stat.  I'd recommend only getting a unit to origin on it's banner, and then rolling them to origin+5 on a rerun if you use them a lot.  Or you can roll with your dick and +5 your waifu as soon as she's released.

######How do events work?
Events usually run 3 weeks with a few weeks in between.  You'll get an event story with some free normal summons.  An event raid with gacha rewards based on raid score. You'll get a free copy of each event unit, a skin for each event unit, and a bunch of other goodies.  Its one of the main sources of freebies in the game.

######Am I too late to start?
No.  This game has multiple unit banner reruns going at once, constantly.  There are no limited units, and arenas are grouped by starting date.  ESS raids are rerun in a loop so you can get those skins at a point in the future.

######Any other starting tips?
- You can borrow units 5x a day, friend whales and use their units to push battlefront to get your idle resource gain up.
- Don't waste your gems on artifact banner or Erika's summon, they're for whales and you get free tickets for both commonly
- As soon as a unit is released, they're added to the general pool, so you can get the current banner unit from friendship and normal summons.  Saving up these summons + epic soul memories is a decent strategy to try and snag an extra copy of an upcoming unit you want.
- Save up your idle resource boxes in your bag until you get walled in battlefront, their value will go up the further you are
- You can take girls on outings and give them gifts before their love story is released, you won't lose any points maxing them before doing their stories
