======PROFILE======
[EOH Name]
Darcy Mabbit

[One line description]
Dungeon Mistress and musing demoness.

[Personality]
Every social circle has that one person that will talk ages about things that interest them if they're allowed. The one who walks the line between cute and weird. The one who will show you an adorable picture of their cat and in the next breath tell you exactly how to make anthrax.
That is Darcy.

[Backstory]
A shy soul inspired by great story tellers, bards, and scholars alike, Darcy would always be found in places where she could read or listen to something exciting. This often led her to being a troublemaker for the orphanage as she would always escape and stalk the caravans and travelers for her mental morsels. Her fate as a nerd was sealed when she managed to land a job at the local library, consuming every piece of literature she could grab.

[Goals]
- Record the results of at least 13 ASIMOV simulations.
- Make her own unique contribution the grand library.
- Survive 1.9.1

[Violence Comfort Level]
Depends... https://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/54873891/#q54875443

[Lewd Okay?]
Definitely!

[Kinks, Specifics (optional)]
>Not sure how often these will come up considering Darcy is a face for the faceless.
Do's: Voyeurism, exhibitionism, praise, tentacles, slimes, (some) parasites, oviposition.
Don'ts: "Things commonly considered more detestable than erotic."
