# Anon's Personal VR MMD Video Collection

The following is an upload of my own personal VR MMD collection, maintained by myself. While I do pay for subs to various fantia accounts, its important to note that this is NOT meant to be an archive. I only save the stuff that I personally like and ignore everything else. However, if I currently have access to something and someone asks for it, I'll grab it for them and upload it if I can.

Remember, if a new VR video you like gets posted, **ASK FOR IT IN THE THREAD. DO NOT ASSUME I WILL GRAB IT.**

## FAQ

>What VR video player should I use to play these videos?
I personally and very strongly recommend Heresphere. You can find it on Steam. It is far and away the best VR video player available. Most people are turned off by the $30 price tag, however if you can't find a place to pirate it, you can simply grab the free demo version from its Steam page and use that. Its 100% fully featured with the only difference being you get a popup once every 30 minutes. Heresphere also has a quest port that can be sideloaded if you wish.

I would personally suggest to avoid DeoVR or Skybox (definitely do not pay for Skybox) as I consider them both to be shit. Use whatever works for you though, as long as you don't pay for them (DeoVR is free thankfully). I have heard good things about Whirligig which is on Steam for only $4, but I have no experience with it myself.

>I'm having trouble playing certain videos, particularly the really high resolution ones!
You probably own an AMD GPU. I'm sorry. All GPU fanboy wars shit aside, AMD is genuinely really bad about decoder support for large resolutions like with VR videos, and that's likely why you're having the problems you are.

If you're stuck on AMD or if you've having trouble in general, you might want to try enabling the Directshow backend on Heresphere for better compatibility. There's a chance your video might run better.

>A video from a creator you posted is missing from your collection!
Its probably because I didn't want it. If someone releases a VR video you like, **ALWAYS ASK FOR IT IN THE THREAD.** That way, assuming I'm subbed to the person at the time and its available to me, I'll know to grab it for you and add it even if its a video I don't personally want.

>Any recommendations?
That depends entirely on taste, but I can at least recommend a few from a technical perspective:

- AsteriaMMD does videos in 8K AND 90FPS, with extremely high bitrates, absolutely the peak of video quality from a technical perspective.
- ろいろい does a combination of 6K with very high bitrate to create videos with very very high clarity, resulting in a very strong 3D effect.
- If you get motion sick easily, ミュー has been making videos where the camera is blacked out briefly between camera changes recently, which should make them a lot easier to watch. You can also just look for any video that doesn't have any camera movements, which a few people do.
- MMDpasta has a ton of Hololive content
