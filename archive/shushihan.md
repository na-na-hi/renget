"A heaven which rejects the meek is a meek heaven indeed." 

The Home of Lost Souls is a Tao of contradictions for it posits that even something lost can have a place where it belongs. This home need not be the one allotted by the heavens, in fact, the act of creation of this home creates a heaven unto itself. This Tao rejects the idea of pre-destination, instead affirming that self-determination of the soul's place in existence is the most necessary requirement for transcendence. Immortal then, becomes a byproduct of continually rebuking heaven's fate until natural death can hold no purchase.
