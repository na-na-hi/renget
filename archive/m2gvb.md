>Be you
>An archaeologist
>Who is now about to make the discovery of a lifetime
>realized that one of the ancient texts found in one of the pyramids weren't just telling a legend, but the location of an ancient Egyptian tomb right next to the valley of kings
>Whoever was buried there must have been a certain kind of special to be buried next to the valley of kings but not in it
>Follow the directions and find nothing but a rock
>Or is it?
>See a Marking on the rock and press it
>Right in front of the rocks a staircase leading down into the ground appears
>Yep, smells like fame...and sand
>Walk into the crypt you just found with nothing but robe, a flashlight, some water and food and a knife in case something happens
>Feels like you were going down these stairs for a good while now but finally reach the end of the stairs
>Turn on your flashlight to see a very long corridor Infront of you
>Tie the rope Infront of the entrance so you can drag it along and not get lost
>Realize that whatever this place is, it's just a very long hallway with rooms on each side, and each room holding something in the middle that's either an artifact or an ancient pot, neither of which you touched so they can stay in perfect condition and NOT in fear of activating any traps
>Reach the end of the hallway and get filled with excitement when you see a entryway that's bigger then any of the entries you seen so far
>Every room until now had something that was obviously very important so whatever here must have been even more important
>Maybe even someone important was buried here
>Can't hold your excitement anymore and decided to step through the entryway
>Only to be confused when you reach it's end
>You see the widest and longest room you have seen in your life, with a lot of sand on the ground
>You shine your flashlight the right and to the left and aren't able too see any walls except the one behind you, next to the entry
>If it weren't for all the pillers, you would have thought you somehow came back outside
>See you still have a bit left of your rope so you continue going on in hope of maybe finding something
>Then out of nowhere, you hear a booming voice that sent chills down your spine
>Not that the voice was scary, it felt nice and silky actually, even a bit feminine
>But it was the fact that the voice felt very loud, and the other fact that no one else should be here
"Halt, you who dares to enter this place"
>You shine your flashlight around the room in hope of finding the source of the voice
>Only to come across a pair of...paws???
>You move your flashlight upwards to see who they belong to
>Which turns out to be a very huge feminine figure covered in brown fur with one of it hands on it's hips, it also had a cat like face and dark black hair, and yellow eyes that were staring deep into you
>You also thing you are mistaking it for a second but it has...wing???
>Could this be a sphinx, like the one's mentioned in old Egyptian legends???
>It seems that it got bored of you staring at it in bewilderment and started speaking to you again
"State what is the purpose of you being here, intruder!"
>It commanding voice snaps you out of your bewilderment and makes you answer it immediately
>You tell it that you are a historian (not sure she knows what an archaeologist is) who wanted to explore this ancient place and understand it more
>While you were saying that, it got down on her knees and then on her arms, almost like a cat, seemingly to get a better look at you
>Which gave YOU a better look at it "feminine figure", which you now see is very robust and plumb, sending some red into your cheeks
>Now you can tell that whatever "it" is, it's definitely a she
>"She" then puts one of her hands under her chin, having what seems to be a bored expression, and starts talking with you again
"Whatever you are here for, you are still an intruder, so I will give you two choices"
>As she says that, she raises two of her fingers on her other hand
"You will either leave this tomb and never come back, or you can answer my riddle, which if you answer correct you will be greatly rewarded, or you answer wrong and be heavily punished"
>You gulp after you hear the word "punished"
>She then lowers her head until she meets you mouth to body, staring right through you
"...So what will you choose?"
>You start thinking about it and answering her seems to be the best answer option
>Because if you leave, someone else might come here and answer the riddle and he will get all the glory for discovering this place, which you can't allow of course
>And secondly, how hard could it be?
>Sure the punishment was supposedly "heavy" but you found this place from a legend that had nothing to do with it on the surface so a simple riddle should be a piece of cake
>And being "greatly rewarded" did sound pretty nice
>You tell the sphinx that you will answer her riddle
>The sphinx reacts by having a very happy look appear on her face before going back to her serious look
"OH THAT'S-I mean...as you wish"
>After saying that she goes into a sitting position with her legs crossed and snaps her finger
>Which catches you off guard because you think she wouldn't have been able to do that with a hand that's covers in fur and has toebeans
>But before you can question it any further, the room starts getting filled with light, with torches on every piller lightning up in an instant, one by one
>Which allowed you to not only be able to see how big this room was, but also gave you a better look at the giant sphinx Infront of you
>Oh wow her breasts were huge
>And her lower body part also looked to be pretty plumb as well
>Like they may look a bit bigger to you with how big she is, but to say she had a nice figure was an understatement
"Now then..."
>She closes her eyes and claps har hands (paws?)
>Before opening her eyes to look at you
"I am the black child of a shining father,
a wingless bird flying to heaven,
every eye that meets me weeps, but not from grief.
What am I?"
>You tell her that the answer is smoke
>The sphinx's eyes seem to widen in surprise 
>you tell her that smoke is born from fire which shines, it flies in the air, and when it meets your eyes it makes you cry
>the sphinx's then surprised expression became one that seemed to be... satisfied?
"You have answered...wisely"
>Heck yeah, you got it
"And for that, you shall be rewarded"
>She then places her paw in front of you
>Which after looking at and seeing that there was nothing in, made you realize that she wanted you to hop on her hand
>Which you decided to do after reluctantly leaving the robe you had on you, because it would probably be all gone after she takes two steps carrying you
>She then raises the paw you are sitting on until you are now as high as her midriff 
>A great looking midriff, by the way
>It was well toned, but didn't seem to have any defined abs on it
>When she starts walking to what looks like to be the top left corner of the room, you decide to focus on something other then her midriff
>Like the reward you were promised and still didn't know
>You were gonna ask her what's the reward going to be but decided against that when you reach the corner of the room
>In which she then proceeded to again, snap her fingers 
>And after she does, one of the walls next to the corner opens to reveal a room inside of it
>You were now fully convinced that whatever powers were in this pyramid, and whatever powers she had, we're not something modern day humans had, at the very least
>You look at the tiny room, only to see that it nothing more then a giant chair made of stone
>Was...was this where she was sitting before she came into the room you were in and gave you that riddle?
>Right before you question that any further, you notice that the wall behind you closing and the one Infront of you opening 
>The new passage Infront of you seems to lead to a long hallway with what looks like a door at the end of it
>As the sphinx starts walking in passageway and into the door at the end, you notice that the walls have huge text written in hieroglyphs on them
>This is when you tell the sphinx to stop moving, which seems to have startled her
>You tell her if by any chance she knows what the text on the walls say
>Sure, you know a bit of hieroglyphs, but she probably knows much more then you and can give you more info on what's here
>She seems to be surprised by how enthusiastic you were about that text before letting a small chuckle
"Heh...I guess you weren't lying about being a historian, were you?"
>She proceeded to explain to you that this tomb was made for a great sorcerer who helped Egypt in it's great time of need
>The sorcerer was supposedly very powerful and fearful, so much so that they removed any mention of him outside of this tomb was removed
>But was buried in a separate tomb due to him refusing to be mummified after death, saying that he didn't believe in coming back after death
>You wished you brought a notebook with you to write all of this down
>But before long you have reached the ending of the hallway and to the aforementioned door
>Which the sphinx (apparently her name is Masika) opens the door to reveal a...
>...a bedroom?
>The more you look at it, the more this place starts looking like a one room apartment 
>There's a bed in the middle and a small drawer next to it, there's also big cupboard with a brass mirror on top of it
>There's also a door on the left that your mind fills in to be the... bathroom? Closet? You honestly couldn't tell
>Masika sets you down on the small drawer next to her bad which she sits on
>And then once again, she snaps her fingers
>And from behind you feel another wall open up, so You turn around to see-
>OH MY GOOD LORD IN HEAVEN IT'S GOLD!
>A little compartment in the wall as big as you opened up and it's full of gold!
>You immediately jump at it and see the amazing stuff that you never thought you would be able to hold in your hands
>Everything from jewelry with gemstones, to pots, plates, coins, and even a dagger with it's shaft and handle made from gold
>You start looking right away for what is the most valuable stuff in that pile and stuffing it inside of the pack 
>That is, of course after looking at Masika and making sure she's ok with you doing this, which she singles that it is with a move from her hand
>After getting your bag full of gold in way that you can still walk, you say thank you to Masika and ask if she can take you back to entrance, because you feel that it will take you a good hour to get there and she can do it in seconds
>Masika then looks at you and what can be described as mischievous smirk as she laying down on her side on top of her bed
"Oh, but that was only the first part of your reward, little historian~"
>You were surprised at the motion that there's more to this reward then what you got, but before you can ask her what's else is to this reward, Masika scoops you up in her paw and brings you closer to her
>You aren't really sure what she is doing but she is bringing her other hand to you and-
>She is using her index finger to rub your crotch
>You feel your face go as red as a tomato and try to push her index finger away from her and yell at her about what the hell is she doing
>She doesn't answer you though, instead pushing a little harder which proved to be too much for your arms and continue to rub your crotch
>You try to push her finger away again because you are starting to feel yourself getting harder the more she she rubs you
>But alas, your efforts were futile, but even then, the rubs themselves didn't feel bad
>She was going slowly and softly on you, and it honestly started to feel pretty good...you can even feel your member getting as hard as it could
>Then right there, Masika releases the claw on her index finger and swoops it down, ripping away both your trousers and underwear and leaving your bottom half all naked
>You instinctively cover your exposed shaft before you are dropped on top of her bed
>Masika then says in very sluttery voice:
"If there's anything else you want to do, just point and I'll handle the rest~"
>She...wants you to go on with this?
>And what's more she wants you to...choose?
>...was this... really ok?
>She is telling you to basically to pick and choose what part of her body for what's gonna happen next
>Meanwhile you are still flustered over the rub she gave you and your pants being removed
>But...then again...
>She said this is a part of your reward...
>Whatever happens here is probably never going to be know to anyone as well...
>And you don't think it was ever mentioned how pretty a sphinx in any legend can be, but Masika was nothing else but stunning
>She had beautiful golden eyes, sleek dark hair, her wings almost looked like that of an angel, her hips were beautifully plumb
>And her...feet paws
>You decide that if you are going into degeneracy you may as well go all in on what you want and point at the paws on Masika's feet
>Which caused her expression to become a mix of confusion and surprise
"...you want...my feet?"
>Right after she finishes that sentence you walk over to her paws, not waiting for her to process what you just told her
>She may be big but you had to take the initiative at one point
>You decide to cut it short and jump at her ankle before going to the paws that you so desire
>All the while Masika is watching you in what could be described as utter bewilderment
>You are none the wiser of course, as you have more important things to foucs on
>Her ankles felt so nice to the touch
>They felt firm yet soft, a testament to how amazing her entire body was
>You start rubbing your face on the fur of her ankle and feel the scent of said fur go through you
>It felt nice, it had on obvious lingering smell of sand but it had another smell mixed in it, something that reminded you of the smell of the cactus you drank from a few days ago
>You start to huff the smell of her fur as you slowly make you way to what would be the toes of her feet and more importantly, her pawpads and toebeans
>But when you are right on top of her feet you hear Masika softly chuckle, causing you to stop and turn around to look at her
"I see...so that's what you are into~"
>It seems that her state of bewilderment has ended, meaning she's back in control
>And with a swift move to the left, you fall off her foot into the bed below
>The impact was thankfully very soft that you didn't feel anything, but then look in front of you to see a giant paw that can cover your entire body, flexing and moving as Masika started speaking with you
"I never met anyone with such a taste before in my life, but that just makes me all the more intrigued~"
>And then right there, her paw fell down completely on top of you with a soft *pomf*
>And it couldn't have ever felt nicer
>Masika wasn't pressing hard on you at all, quite the contrary, she was softly but firmly pressing on you, moving her paw up and down and flexing it's joints on top kf
>The fur felt nice and fluffy, rubbing all on your body and face
>And the pawpad on your chest and the toebeans Right between your head felt like some of the softest things you have ever touched
>The smell of sand and cacti was there and amplified as it filled every corner of your lungs
>If you were to describe this sensation, you would probably say it felt divine
>And it seemed that your little man agreed
>Sadly, it seemed that this sensation was coming to an end as the paw was slowly ascending away from your body
>You don't have time to dwell on that however, when suddenly it goes back again and grabs your arm with it toes to lift you up
>You are now in an upright posting held in the air by a paw and are confused about what's happening
>That confusion was gone once you looked to your left and saw another paw right next to you, fully understanding what's going to happen next
"Hmm hmm~ it would probably feel better if I do it with both of them, don't you agree?~"
>Right before you say anything, both paws go on to meet each other, with you trapped in between
>And if what you felt while on the bed was divine, then this was outright heavenly
>All the sensations that you felt were amplified even more to everything from the fluffiness, to the softness, to the smell of cacti
>You were right between her paws that you felt were playing with you with the way they moved and flexed
>Then they started moving back and forward, rubbing each inch of your body with fur and paw
>The sensation and pressure was getting to you with how good it felt, with your member threatening to unleash it's entire load at any second
>Which happened a few seconds later, with white strings seeming to shoot all over
>It seems that Masika felt that since her feet stopped the rubbing with you feeling like a none stop panting mess
>She then opens her paws like a book, revealing the tiny man that was trapped between them
>Masika simply stared at you with a big smug look on her face
"I didn't expect you to feel that good just from my feet~"
>After saying that, Masika picks you up in her hand and brings you close to her face
"You definitely released a lot, you need some cleaning now"
>And then she does a swipe with her finger -similar to the one she did to remove your pants- and removes your shirt
>You complain at her for doing this again since you are capable of removing your clothing yourself but stop mid-sentence when she opens her maw as wide as at she seems to able to
>Then you feel her hand inching you closer to said maw
>You feel every bit of your instincts telling you that you are probably in danger and need to do something immediately, but like a deer caught in headlights, you stay perfectly still
>She slowly starts putting you in her mouth -feet first- all the way in until the only thing left outside when she closes her maw is your head
>You know this is dangerous, then why...
>Why does it feel so good?
>The way her tongue is swaying all over your body, the soft nibbles she does on you with her giant teeth, the sheer warmth you feel through your whole body
>It just feels too damn good
>Then she sucks you all the way in, putting all of you inside of maw
>And you felt going mad from just being in there
>The absolute warmth you felt there made what you felt inside of her feet feel like a freezer
>The way her tongue was moving all over your body, covering every inch with salvia
>The way she would put you under her teeth and very softly nibble on you
>At all felt so good
>To Masika, you were probably like a sweet piece of candy that she going to savor real good
>she was swaying you in her mouth into her cheeks left and right
>She was putting you under her tongue and then on her tongue which she we would fold on you
>You think she even tried to put her tongue inside of your mouth, which didn't work or course because it would never fit, but that still lead to your mouth being full of her saliva
>Meanwhile on the outside, Masika was cleaning her feet from what you left using some water and a towel while humming some song
>You felt that humming as it sent vibrations all over her mouth and into your body, but that only increased the sensation 
>You were probably there for minutes but it felt like hours
>You have already let go multiple times but you don't care anymore, the sensation felt that good
>And finally, she opens her mouth and lets you slide off her tongue right into her chest and between her breasts
"There, all clean now~"
>After that she cleans your body from all the salvia using a towel and some clean water, that you were wondering how she get
>She then gets you a somehow clean set of clothes that were obviously Egyptian in origin to cover yourself
>After all that is done she gets you your bag and takes you back to the room you met her in to send you on your marry way
>The trip felt somehow longer this time...it felt like you had more to Do...
>You step down from her hand and walk forward before looking back at her
>She looks at you for a bit but seems to understand what you were trying to deliver with that look and chuckles a bit
"You can come back whenever you want dear, just make sure you are ready to answer more riddles next time~"
>...you grab the rope you left and start making your way back to the entrance 
>...maybe you shouldn't tell people about this place
