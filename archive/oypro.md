### Brook ♂
 Seemingly not much of a talker, this zorua was found floating in the sea with no other vessel or pokemon in sight. Rescued by a boat belonging to the Ava-Lu empire, and his amnesia assumed a result of his near drowning he's dropped off at his own request in the nearest town with no information other than the knowledge that he's in a body that's not his own, a body that's not human.
