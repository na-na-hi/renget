## Abandoned Hotel Exploration

[0:00]
Alright...that's the camera recording...Okay hello everyone! Welcome back to UrbExplorer, the only channel where pretty much everything I do can be considered a criminal trespassing act. Should be getting paid for this I tell ya but I digress. For today's video, we're going to be exploring an abandoned city. Or at least part of it. Or maybe all of it, depends on how much we can really explore. The place is separated into three layers overlaid on each other, we're starting off at the bottom. Top layer is impossible to get by because of high security and...well I don't need to explain why the middle layer is off-limits, right?

Probably will need to do so for the bottom layer so bare with me. Right now we're travelling through some premade tunnels that were made about 40 years ago, sometime before the city was finished. Maintenance tunnels that have been forgotten to time and underpaid guards. As you can see, these things have a pretty high ceiling. The flashlight can see through the dark by a 100ft away yet it looks as if it can barely reach the walkways above us. By our right you can see some tubes that lead to some barrels. Barrels that smell absolutely awful by the way, be thankful and grateful you're not here.

[00:16]

Moving on past them barrels, we're finally reaching the end of the maintenance tunnels! Past this door here that needs a good *kicking*...and we're at the bottom layer. Still a bit hard to see since there's a whole bunch of road down here but there seems to be a clear path. Strange how most of it is...kinda dictated by all of the trucks here though. Hell that seems to be all that's down here, empty and abandoned trucks from long ago. Guess it would've been hard as nails to actually clear them all out once this whole place went to snuff. Anyways, let's get walking.

According to my insider guy, just up ahead will be the way up to the middle layer. Didn't give much details on what it'd be which is a slight cause of concern but it shouldn't be-

A rope. A rope? Yeah that's a rope. He's making me a climb a rope. Thanks. Least there's a pile of garbage at the bottom, gives me something to break the fall. Time to see if high school gym lessons paid off. You guys get in the bag, I'll take it from here.

[00:26]

Awh, Jesus Christ...my lungs are burning and it feels like my shoulders are about to pop off â€¦need to sit down, sorry old and long dead guy but I'm going to need to use your car as a seat...Jeez, that wasn't even a high climb! Getting too damn old for this. Or I'm just getting fat. Going to take a reading and drinking break, you guys can rest in the bag again.

[00:36]

And that's a book break finished! Atlas Shrugged, huh? I think the unusual writing style gives the book too much of a bad wrap. Personally I find the philosophy behind it all rather interesting...what was the name for it again? Began with a...okay never mind about that. Look over there. Or just look anywhere. This whole place is filled to the brim with cars. Like a can of sardines. You can see some dried up and aged white paint underneath some of them too, this is just as a much as a parking space as it is a road. If we're going to reach the stairs at the centre of this place that the insider talked about, we'll need to carefully walk on top of these things.

It's a delicate art, walking on cars. At least on functioning ones that people use. With old cars you get to not mind denting the hood and top part but you still gotta watch out for breaking the windshields and windows. Like...over there for example! You can just tell that an earlier explorer wanted to rush through this place but *bam*, he stepped through a windshield and cut himself open. Strange how the trail continues though...on both sides. Did he cut himself on the car or before that? L-let's not think too hard on that and just get a move on.

[00:45]

And here we are, the centre of this place! And just as the insider said, we've got a doorway with a little sign that says "Stairs." Let's have a peek in there and see- Awh *god*-

The smell! Awwhh mother of God, that's just a pile of trash by the stairs. Too damn tall, it reaches the first flight of em! It's like a feast made with a 2 year old, sun dried slab of steak marinated with skunk juice. Jesus, you guys need to really be thankful you're not here. Just going to pinch my nose and get to running past, pray for me so I don't vomit. 

[00:54]

Finally got to the top layer...we seem to be in a pretty big building. Lots of broken couches, plenty of chairs. Dirty as hell carpet, very glad I'm wearing my work shoes. And over here...is a reception desk. There's a room leading in from behind, let's take a quick peek.

So in here, we've got shelves upon shelves with lockers upon lockers. Each of them numbered in the hundreds...forgive my presumptions but I believe that we're in a hotel. A pretty big one too. We'll take a good look through here and explore for a bit before taking a look outside. Unless this place turns out to be more interesting than I thought. In which case, we'll just look out the windows and see what's to be seen.

[01:12]

So skipping out on the entrance and the first floor which was blocked up, I managed to check out the second floor. Nothing much was there though, just seemed to be guest rooms. Taking a look outside as well just showed off some... roads? They're not exactly roads, they look like something out of a water ride. Even got the shuttles that are dragged along on a track. Anyways, after the second floor I decided to check what's on the next one. And thank God I did because we've encountered our first gift shop! Seems to be based around the United Kingdom for some reason. Big Ben snowglobes, Stonehenge murals. Would've considered it strange to see this stuff left over but...I mean it is British themed.

[01:23]

Moving on from there, we're going to skip a couple of other floors so that we can check out a better view of this place. Right now we're on the sixth floor with a whole bunch more to go. Just sneak our way inside the guest room...pardon the intrusion...and here we have another view. Very cloudy night which makes things hard to see but...it's still a decent view. Can't see too much, just more of those empty shuttles on tracks above the city. There's a couple of other buildings I can see now though, don't have a clue on what they're for. Going to keep heading up now.

[01:31]

Encountered another gift shop up the way here, this one is themed around Japan. There isn't much left over here but there's a couple of dirtied up prints of The Great off Kanagawa. Also some of those uh...gowns? The Japanese gown things they wear inside or something, we've got some here. Not a lot of stuff here compared to the United Kingdom, guess scavengers have their preference. Haven't heard much news of scavengers though, not from my insider at least. Wonder how that's the case.

[01:47]

Moving up further to the 14th floor now...should be called the 13th but I guess superstition reigns supreme. Anyways, this is the most interesting floor yet because it seems to be a hall set for events. And here...it's set for a wedding. The pews are setup, an aisle with an archway is here. Hell, you've still got a bible left over here on the stand....Oddly recent book though. Barely any dust on it, pages aren't yellowed too. There's a cake over there too in the middle of the table. Well, barely much of what was meant to look like a cake at some point. Right now it mostly looks like rotted mush that's more meat than something you'd bake. But it's definitely more recent than this place has been around. Little envelope here too by this chair, seems to be eligible. I'll read it off for you guys:

-> DANIEL AND UMBRIDGE WATERS INVITE YOU TO A WEDDING TO THE LONELIEST PLACE ON EARTH <-
-> ADMISSION IS FREE (AS LONG AS YOU CAN MAKE IT) <-

Huh. Who the hell would get these invitations and know who the Waters couple are? If there's any answer to this, I'll probably find it further up this hotel. But still, imagine wanting to get married in *this* place. God knows I wouldn't. It is definitely one way to leave some lasting memories. A sure-fire way to leave a little legacy...

Weird things they tend to be, legacies. Sometimes you're like Ayn Rand, remembered by many for being an awful writer but held in high regard by some die hard fans. Other times you're the Waters couple, choosing to be remembered by the very few people you'll have met. And then you're the guy who made this place...sad way to go. Spend all you're life making yourself a vital member of the human race yet in the last few decades, you waste it making something that gets condemned by the public of your era and forgotten to time for everyone else...By the way, sorry about skipping floors again. Mostly just seeing other gift shops for places like Brazil and Taiwan, along with normal guest floors at this point. Not too sure if I'll be seeing another event hall like the one on the 14th but we'll have to see.

[02:12]

need to whisper for this part guys...there's other people in this hotel. there's a man and a woman arguing on one of the floors here...i think this is floor 22. hard to make out what they're saying. not even sure if they're speaking english. proper english i mean. it's in a weird stilted dialect. i'll get a bit closer to hear what they're saying, bare with me. 

**-ssso whaat happened to Garrrry?**

shit, he's going to see me! i need to go, now!

[02:21]

Fuck fuck fuck fuck! I've just been running for a couple minutes straight now, at the 28th floor, need to rest. God damn it I need some rest...oh Jesus thank you for a gift shop centred around Iceland here, gotta sit down...hough...Time to think. That woman called the man Daniel, so they must've been the Waters couple. And there was a guy named Gary on the roof. Can't exactly run down and risk getting caught. Going upstairs is going to be even riskier but I want to keep an eye out for Gary. Seems like he's in a spot of trouble. I'll just sit here for a bit, maybe get some reading in first though. Don't want Daniel to see me.

[02:32]

Alright, finished up the reading and now at the rooftop. Interesting thing to note is that there was a lock on the door but the door was left open. Looking around myself there's...quite a bit more here than just a pool. There's a tennis court over by that side, a basketball court here. A lot of fake grass here, feels like I'm walking through a park. Still no sight on the pool. Plenty of benches out here though. Might sneak in a chance to have a sit down at one-

Oh God.

There's corpses on those benches.

Corpses on all of them. They're all wearing clothes you'd see a homeless person wear. Scavengers. People who wanted a home and found this place fit. Why are they all here on the roof? Did it have something to do with the lock on the door? And why does every park bench have some of them sitting on one. Jesus, it's not even just scavengers. There's skeletons too. Wearing old clothes that came from decades ago. People who died at the top long ago and were never brought down. I'm over at the pool now...it's still filled with water. Black water. Garry...I can see his scalp floating in the water... I don't want to look at that anymore.

There's only one park bench so far that doesn't have any one sitting on it. It faces off this whole city. Everything from the residential houses far off in the distance to the other tall buildings in this place. Either way it's empty. Probably just another bench they haven't gotten to yet. There's a little plaque here though. Let me see if I can catch that...

-> Park Bench Reserved for Lilly and Walt Disney. <-

-> E.P.C.O.T - THE COMMUNITY OF TOMORROW <-

The creator of the city...a bench just for them to see the city he made. Left all alone with no one to-

**SHLK**

w-what...

**SHK SHK SHK SHK SHK SHK SHK**

**...Littlee sneaaky fella, you musst've thought you were oneee sneaaky fella.**
