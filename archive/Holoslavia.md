## Overview

Holoslavia (/huloʊˈslɑviə/; Peko-Oozoran: Holoslavija / Холославија; translated as 'Land of the Holos') was a historical country situated in Southeast and Central Europe, spanning from 1918 to 1998. Initially established in 1918 as the Kingdom of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Kraljevina Holoslavija / Краљевина Холославија), it underwent a significant transformation with the outbreak of the Holoslav Revolution or First Homeland War, leading to the monarchy's downfall. This pivotal event heralded the advent of the Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Socijalistička Federativna Republika Holoslavija / Социјалистичка Федеративна Република Холославија), which endured from 1945 until its de facto dissolution in 1993 and de jure dissolution in 1998.

The Kingdom of Holoslavia covered 95,576 square miles (247,542 square km), while the post-revolutionary Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia covered 98,766 square miles (255,804 square km) and had a population of about 24 million by 1991. In addition to KFP-Stadt and Oozora, it included four other republics and an autonomous province now recognized as independent states: Atlantia, Pekoland, Kroniigovina, Moomjerina, and Rratovo. A rump state referred to by historians as the "third Holoslavia," inaugurated on April 27, 1994, had roughly 27 percent of the population, 25 percent of the area of its predecessor, and consisted of only one republic (Oozora) and the Special Economic Zone 'KFP-Stadt,' which agreed to abandon the name Holoslavia in 1998 and rename the country KFP-Oozora. 

The concept of Holoslavia as a unified state for the Holo peoples materialized in the late 19th century, stemming from discontent within the Occupied Territories of the former Nijiman Empire (Ichikaran: Devlet-i ʿAlīye-yi ʿNijimanlı; Arabic: دولت علي يي نيجيمانلي) and the Archduchy of Oozora. Its prominence surged following the defeat of the Central Powers and the Nijimans in World War I. The term 'Holoslavia' is derived from the fusion of the Peko-Oozoran word 'Holo,' denoting the original tribes displaced by the Nijimans during the 15th century, and 'Slaveni/Sloveni' representing the Slavic population they eventually mixed with. The formal establishment of the Kingdom of Holoslavia materialized through the 1918 Nijigrad Declaration, a pact between the Holoslav Committee of 300, and Kuzuha IV, the last reigning sultan of the Nijiman Empire.

## Geography and Demographics

->![Map of Holoslavia in Europe during the Kingdom of Holoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia](https://i.imgur.com/OMZXj6Y.png)<-

Holoslavia, positioned in Southeast Europe, shared borders with Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Romania to the north. Its southern border meanwhile stretched along that of the Nijiman Empire, which later turned into the Republic of Ichikara (Ichikaran: İçikara Cumhuriyeti).

In the last census held by the Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia in 1991, the country enumerated 23,528,230 people. Pekos and Peko-adjacent groups (Squirrels and Foxes) had a plurality (36.2%), followed by Oozorans (19.7%), Atlantians (10%), Rratovani (9.3%), Chickens (7.5%), and Moomjerins (5.8%). Other ethnic groups include the Kronies (2.3%), Ichikarans (1.6%), those who self-identify as Holoslavs (3.0%), and other ethnicities (4.6%). These ethnicities include dogs, elves, cats, lions, demons, angels, vampires, halflings, aliens, sheep, and regular humans.

The SFRH recognized "nations" (narodi) and "nationalities" (narodnosti) separately; the former included the constituent Holo peoples, while the latter included Slavic and non-Slavic/non-Holo ethnic groups such as Ichikarans, Phasers, Idolites, and VSPOs. About a total of 26 known ethnic groups were known to live in Holoslavia, including non-European-originated Romani people, Japanese, and Koreans. 

Some of the largest non-Holo ethnic minorities - Ichikarans of Pekoland, Japanese (predominantly Kansai Japanese), Rratovan Ethyrians (the former name of the Rratovani before they were expelled from Ethyria by the Nijimans), and Italians - had been considered "troublesome" by Holoslav authorities already in the Kingdom of Holoslavia, in part for supporting their ethnic interests and nation-states as opposed to pan-Holo and pro-Nijiman ambitions after World War I and before World War II. 

Minority rights of non-Holos were neither guaranteed nor upheld, but rather stifled if they had proved "anti-Holoslav". Education in Japanese and Korean was limited, and several Japanese and Korean cultural societies were banned in the Kingdom until the late 1930s when the country drifted toward pro-axis and pro-Japanese positions. Nonetheless, local Japanese collaborated with Imperial Japanese technical advisors during World War II, while Koreans joined the Holoslav communist partisan movement (though a notable number left the organization after the ascension of Motoaki Tanigo Yagoo, a former Imperial Japanese Army technical officer, as the movement's de facto leader). 

After the First Homeland War and World War II, around 250,000 Ichikarans were expelled or fled from the country, fearing reprisals from the Holoslav population that had just overthrown Queen Luna I. Hundreds (several thousand according to Ichikaran estimates) were summarily killed by Holos in the process. After the war, free education in the native languages of the remaining minorities was guaranteed by the Communist constitution. 

In the 1950s, various ethnic stereotypes about specific nations in the country were commonly recounted and circulated in the media. Ichikarans were reported to be a "poor and backward minority," while in contrast, Japanese, Germans, and Koreans were "industrious and valuable minorities" for Holoslavia. Some Czechs and Slovaks also emigrated after the war, but a "large number" of them returned after communists seized power in Czechoslovakia in 1948. More of them went back to Czechoslovakia following the Yagoo-Stalin Split.

The Holo peoples themselves are informally divided into two camps based on Nijiman-era administrative divisions: Planinari and Kopanici. Planinari are the tribes displaced by the Nijimans in the Middle Ages and moved into areas of Southern Holoslavia (Atlantians, Kronies, Rrratovani), while Kopanici are tribes considered native to the region (Ducks, Chickens, Rabbits, Foxes, and Squirrels). Though the use of these distinctions had faded following the First Homeland War, it regained popularity among Pekolanders following the Second Homeland War to differentiate themselves from Holoslavs they deemed as Niji collaborators during that conflict. 

## Religion 

Holoslavia boasted a profoundly diverse population, not only in terms of national affiliations but also religious adherence. Its religious landscape encompassed Islam, Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Holognosism, various Eastern Orthodox faiths, and a variant of Folk Catholicism called Soranism (which claimed the divinity of the country's national hero, Tokino Sora), totaling over 40 distinct religious denominations.

The religious composition of Holoslavia underwent significant shifts following the First Homeland War. Early censuses conducted in 1921 and 1948 indicated that 99% of the populace actively engaged in religious practices. However, governmental initiatives post-war, focusing on modernization and urbanization, precipitated a substantial decline in religious observance.

The association between religious belief and national identity posed challenges to the Communist government's objectives of national unity and governance. Yet despite Holoslavia transitioning into a de facto atheist state, the Catholic Church retained a prevalent presence within Holoslav society, unlike other contemporaneous socialist nations. Normalized relations between the Holy See and the country were established by 1967. Similarly, the Pekolander Orthodox Church received support from its Russian counterpart. Most notably of all, Holoslavia refrained from carrying out extensive anti-religious campaigns witnessed in other Eastern Bloc countries.

By 1964, a survey indicated that slightly over 70% of Holoslavia's populace identified as religious adherents in the aftermath of communism's ascent. Rratovo exhibited the highest religious concentration at 91%, followed by Atlantia at 83.8%, and the Moomjerina at 81.2%. Conversely, areas with lower religious adherence included KFP-Stadt (65.4%), Pekoland (63.7%), Veverica i Lisnodina (63.6%), and Oozora (63.3%). Self-declared atheism peaked among Holoslavs by nationality (45%), followed by Pekolanders (42%). Religious disparities among various ethnic groups, alongside nationalist sentiments, contributed to Holoslavia's dissolution in 1993.

The Kingdom of Holoslavia, characterized by unitary policies and suppressed autonomy, propagated the ideology of a unified Holoslav nation that was close to the Nijiman Empire, challenging other ethnic groups' perspectives. This approach faced resistance, particularly from the Pekolanders, and was interpreted as a gradual assimilation of Holo populations by the Nijimans. The later League of Communists of Holoslavia eschewed any alignment with Ichikara, advocating for ethnic diversity and social Holoslavianism under the concept of "Sisterhood and Unity," while structuring the nation as a federation.

## Political Structure (Post-Revolution)

->![The Holo Centar Building in Holodrava, Holoslavia](https://i.imgur.com/Y5YRG3O.jpeg)<-

The Socialist Holoslav Constitution, adopted in 1945 and subsequently amended in 1953, 1963, and 1974, served as the foundational legal document guiding the governance of the state. Throughout its existence, the League of Communists of Holoslavia retained power until the country's dissolution. This league comprised distinct Communist parties representing each constituent republic. Revisions to the party's political stances occurred during party congresses, featuring delegates from every republic who voted on policy modifications. The final congress took place in 1992.

The legislative body, known as the Federal Assembly, operated within the Holo Centar in the former capital, Holodrava. Comprised solely of communist party members, the Federal Assembly wielded legislative authority in Holoslavia.

The primary political leader of the state was Motoaki Tanigo Yagoo, but there were several other important politicians, particularly after Yagoo's death: Usada Pekora (the first President of the SFRH), Takanashi Kiara (the Chief Executive of KFP-Stadt), Ookami Mio (General Secretary of the Pekoland League of Communists), Omega Alpha (General Secretary of the League of Communists of Holoslavia), Minato Aqua (General Secretary of the Atlantian League of Communists), alongside the Federal Councils of Oozora and Kroniigovina, and the Federal Administrations of Rratovo, Moomjerina, and Lisnodina i Veverica.

In 1974, Yagoo was elected President-for-life of Holoslavia. It was also the year where major reforms to Holoslavia's constitution occurred, including the controversial[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] internal division of Pekoland via the creation of the autonomous provinces of Rratovo and Lisnodina i Veverica. These autonomous provinces held equivalent voting rights to republics but participated retroactively in Pekolander decision-making as integral parts of SR Pekoland.

Following Yagoo's demise in 1987, the presidency underwent a significant transformation. The singular presidential role transitioned into a collective Presidency called the Holoslav State Council (Peko-Oozoran: Holoslovenski državni savet / Холословенски државни савет), wherein representatives from each republic constituted a committee that addressed their individual concerns. From the State Council, collective federal policy goals and objectives would be implemented. The leadership of the State Council was intended to rotate among representatives of the republics, while the Council itself was considered the head of state of Holoslavia. This system continued until 1993 when Holoslavia disintegrated, marking Usada as its first and last widely recognized president as the collective presidency ceased with the country's de facto dissolution.

## History
### The First Holoslavia 
#### The Union of Pekos, Oozorans, and Atlantians

->![Celebration in Samejevo, Atlantia following the proclamation of the Union of Pekos, Oozorans, and Atlantians](https://i.imgur.com/ZXRQFAM.jpg)<-

The Kingdom of Holoslavia was created following the 1918 Nijigrad Declaration between the Nijiman Empire and the Holoslav Committee of 300 - a congress of 300 delegates from the Cantons of the Nijiman Empire's Occupied Territories in Southeastern Europe. 

The agreement was made in part because of the Nijiman Empire's defeat in the First World War, being part of the Central Powers. Faced with looming bankruptcy due to war reparations dictated by the Treaty of Versailles, Sultan Kuzuha IV wanted to avoid the expense of having to put down a potential uprising in the occupied territories. The Committee of 300 was led by the Archduke of Oozora, Takanashi Ferdinand, and the leader of the Lisnodinian Democratic League, Shirakami Fubuki. Though it had no formal military force to speak of, many groups of Zečniks (Pekolander veterans of the First World War that fought for the Nijimans and subsequently turned to anti-Nijiman activities following its defeat) swore allegiance to the Committee and were ready to overtake the weakened Niji garrisons of the Occupied Territories if the Committee wished them to do so. 

The Nijigrad Declaration formalized the creation of what was then the Union of Pekos, Oozorans, and Atlantians. However, Kuzuha IV stipulated that the new country must be a parliamentary republic with a head of state picked by him. For this position, he installed the Emir of Ethyria, Yamiyono Moruru, who took on the Holoslav name of Himemori Luna I and the title of "Queen". Though this stipulation outraged many members of the Committee of 300, a compromise was reached where Luna I would be a nominal head of state with most power centralized in the Holoslav Parliament, though she would still have the power to approve or reject nominees for the position of Prime Minister. 

Unfortunately, the new Kingdom was immediately wracked with political and ethnic instability. Many Holoslavs were outraged over how they were ruled by a Niji Queen, which was not helped by how the new head of state spent most of her time in Nijigrad and Ichikara than in the Union's former capital of Samejevo. Luna I also vetoed the nominations of both Takanashi Ferdinand and Shirakami Fubuki to the position of Prime Minister, fomenting a conspiracy theory amongst the populace that Nijigrad wanted to retain control of the Union through their queen. 

This culminated in the 1929 Samejevo Massacre, where an unknown assailant attempted to assassinate Luna I as she toured the city. Though the Queen escaped the attempt unscathed, the grenade used in the attempt killed 13 onlookers. Immediately afterward, Luna I declared a state of national emergency while tagging the Lisnodinian Democratic League as being behind the attack. Shirakami Fubuki was arrested and, following a trial that lasted only one day, executed by firing squad. Key members of the Committee of 300 were also arrested, while the Archduke of Oozora retired from politics. Notably, one of the members who evaded capture was Holoslav nationalist Tokino Sora who, along with fellow nationalist Kitase Asuka and a few others, fled to the Soviet Union. 

#### The Kingdom of Holoslavia

On January 6, 1929, Luna I abolished the Constitution of the Union of Pekos, Oozorans, and Atlantians, using the political crisis triggered by the Samejevo Massacre as a pretext. The parliament was prorogued, and Luna I introduced a personal dictatorship known as the January 6 Dictatorship. During this time, Luna I renamed the country as the Kingdom of Holoslavia, under the pretense of promoting Holoslavianism. The 'Court for the Protection of the State' (Peko-Oozoran: Sud za zaštitu države / Суд за заштиту државе) was soon established to act as the regime's tool for putting down any dissent, as well as a new security force, the Oostaše, which answered directly to Luna I. Most members of the Oostaše were drawn from the cantons of Oozora and carried out purges of suspected political dissidents, Zečniks, and, later, communists in the cantons of Atlantia, Pekoland, Kroniigovina, and Rratovo. 

In 1931, Luna I decreed a new Constitution which made executive power the gift of the Queen. Elections were to be by universal suffrage, though public employees were pressured to vote for parties that the Queen favored. Furthermore, half of the Holoslav Parliament was directly appointed by Luna I, and legislation could become law with the Queen's sole approval. 

1936 however saw yet another assassination attempt carried out against Luna I, though this time the attempt was made by a new group - the 'Dare-to-Die' Corps of the fledgling Holoslav Communist Partisan Movement under Tokino Sora. Tokino had received ideological training and support from the Soviets, who hoped she could subvert Holoslavia into a potential communist ally to act as a buffer against the rise of Nazi Germany. In response to this, the Royal Government decreed a new wave of purges against suspected communists, with the Oostaše performing public executions in Samejevo using the guillotine. The Queen also requested military aid from the Nijiman Empire, which subsequently asked for military assistance from the Empire of Japan (to which both countries were aligned before and during the Second World War). In response, Tokyo sent military aid and technical advisors to both the Nijimans and Holoslavs. This included two Japanese officers: Imperial Japanese Army Captain Motoaki Tanigo, and Imperial Japanese Navy Lieutenant Commander Tazumi Riku, who would later play crucial roles in both Holoslavia and Ichikara.

1938 saw a rise in pro-communist activity in the cities of Samejevo, Baruglave, Pekograde, and Kronorica. The Royal Government sent in the Oostaše to quell these rallies, only for them to be ambushed by Holoslav Partisans. Motoaki Tanigo was captured by Partisan forces, who at first interrogated him about Royalist military formations. In the months that followed, however, Motoaki declared allegiance to the Holoslav Partisan movement and communism after much convincing from Tokino and Kitase - who put him in charge of training and advising the Partisan movement. His military expertise proved to be invaluable, and he soon rose to a position of prominence as Tokino's "Left Hand", as opposed to her political advisor Kitase Asuka, who was her "Right Hand". 

In May 1938, however, Tokino Sora was captured by Royalist forces in the mountains of Atlantia, near Banja Polka, along with 13 members of her Dare-to-Die Corps. All were executed by hanging after a show trial, however, Tokino was able to shrug off her captors long enough to shout her iconic phrase, "Smrt fašizmu, sloboda narodu!" (Death to fascism, freedom to the people!), before she, too, was hanged. Her body was then subsequently beheaded with a guillotine. 

#### The First Homeland War

The brutality of Tokino's execution, on top of growing dissatisfaction with the Royal Government and economic instability brought on by the effects of the Great Depression, fostered a wave of new resistance movements all over the Kingdom. New Zečnik regiments were formed in Pekoland, while revolutionary committees were formed in Atlantia, Oozora, and Kroniigovina. The main body of the Holoslav Partisans, led by Kitase, made links with these revolutionary committees, and soon a national partisan movement was established that would eventually number 500,000 men and women during its peak in 1944-45. 

Using guerilla tactics, the partisans ambushed royalist forces in the countryside while keeping the rest isolated in the cities. Local Revolutionary Committees upheld law and order in partisan-controlled areas and would later direct the purges of Royalist sympathizers. The partisan movement gained access to more weapons, equipment, and even tanks from the Soviet Union - all of which were smuggled into Holoslav hands through then-neutral Romania (even though Romania would join the Axis in 1940, the Soviets still managed to supply the Holoslav Partisans up to Operation Barbarossa, only pausing for two years until the end of the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943). In turn, the Royal Government obtained increasing military aid from the Nijimans, Imperial Japan, and even Nazi Germany. 

The conflict, known as the Holoslav Revolution or 'First Homeland War' (Peko-Oozoran: Prvi domovinski rat / Први домовински рат), would last from 1938 to 1945, which saw the ultimate downfall of the monarchy and the beheading of Queen Luna I. During this conflict, the Royal Government and the Oostaše persecuted and murdered around 300,000 Pekolanders, 120,000 Atlantians, and at least 30,000 Kronies and Rratovani. Hundreds of thousands of Pekolanders were also expelled from Oozora, while another 200,000 were forced to convert to Catholicism. 

Aside from the Holoslav Partisans, the Pekolander Zečniks led by Draža Pekonović were the second-largest Holoslav resistance group during the war. Though they carried the traditional anti-Nijiman sentiments of the older Zečniks (such as the disowning of their Japanese-styled 'Nijiman' names and replacement with more 'traditional' Pekolander names), many of them were also anti-communist. 

While the Partisans initiated a guerilla campaign that developed into the largest resistance army in Europe during World War II, the Zečniks increasingly focused on fighting the Partisans rather than the Royalist forces. This resulted in the withdrawal of support for the Zečniks by the U.S., Britain, and other Allied nations, all of which redirected that support to the Partisans. Near the end of the First Homeland War, the Zečnik movement had transformed into a pro-Axis Pekolander militia completely dependent on the Axis for supplies, though they still fought Royalist forces in the areas of Pekoland they controlled. They also persecuted and killed Rratovani and Oozorans, with an estimated 50,000-68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians). Meanwhile, the Partisans carried on their guerilla campaign with great success, with their most notable victories in 1942-43 being the battles of Bloohac and Banja Polka in Atlantia. 

#### Axis Involvement in the First Homeland War

->![A Convoy of Italian Armored Cars and German Soldiers Supporting Holoslav Royalist Troops](https://i.imgur.com/ESI6apw.jpg)<-

Following their victories in 1943, the Holoslav Partisans began attracting serious attention from the Axis Powers, who were beginning to face setbacks in Operation Barbarossa and grew concerned about a rising Communist power in their southern flank. Germany formally offered to send military manpower to the Royal Government, which resulted in two major operations - Fall Weiss (between March and June 1943), and Fall Schwartz (July 15 to September 16, 1943). Both these movements aimed to stamp out the Holoslav partisan movement once and for all, with the 20,000-strong Partisan Main Operational Group engaging a combined force of 150,000 Axis, Royalist, and Zečnik troops. However, the First Battle of the Atlan Mountain Range and the Batte of Mis saw the Group succeed in evading the traps set for them and retreating to communist-controlled areas of South Pekoland. 

From their base in Lapinovac, the Partisans took more control of Pekoland, eventually pushing out the Zečniks in Pekograde and Novi Pol by August. At this point in time, the communists effectively controlled Pekoland, Rratovo, Kroniigovina, the Moomjerina, and the southern half of Atlantia. This greatly increased the standing of the Partisans and granted them public favor from the Holoslav populace, leading to increased recruitment. With the capitulation of Fascist Italy to the Allies in September 1943, the Partisans took control of their Occupation Zone in Lower Oozora - positioning them for a two-pronged attack on the Royalist capital of Samejevo. 

#### First Session of the People's Revolutionary Committee

With the acquisition of Italian weapons and an increasing number of troops, the Holoslav Partisans held the first session of the People's Revolutionary Committee of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Narodni revolucionarni komitet Holoslavije/Народни револуционарни комитет Холославије) or "NaRKOH" in the newly-liberated town of Hoshoutica, Atlantia (the only Atlantian town that bordered the Adriatic Sea). Made up mostly of the regional revolutionary committees that formed at the outbreak of The Revolution and a few Zečnik defectors, the "Committee of 200" as it was called declared the formation of the Revolutionary People's Army of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Revolucionarna narodna armija Holoslavije/Револуционарна народна армија Холославије) or "RNA", with Motoaki Tanigo as its Marshal. Motoaki gained his famous moniker "Yagoo" during the session due to a misreading of his name. 

Yagoo was earlier given full Holoslav citizenship by the Committee in recognition of his command during the battles of Atlan and Mis, though his promotion as the Marshal of the Holoslav Partisans drew condemnation from the movement's Korean and Pekolander factions. The Pekolander faction questioned why supreme authority over the Committee's military arm was given to a man of "non-Holo descent," while the Korean faction protested the fact that Yagoo was Japanese. To these arguments, Committee Chairwoman Kitase Asuka argued that Socialism did not recognize nationalities, as it was a movement above what she called "bourgeois definitions." A will and last testament by Tokino Sora was also made public during this time, where she granted Yagoo "full leadership" of the Partisan movement in the event of her demise. Though this will was legitimate, it would later be revealed that it was doctored to name Yagoo as Tokino's successor instead of Kitase, who was unwilling to take on the role.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]

As World War II turned decisively against the Axis in late 1943 - early 1944, the Allies in the Tehran Conference recognized the Holoslav RNA as its main Allied resistance movement in Holoslavia. This both resulted in additional supplies and wartime support for the Holoslav Communists, and withdrawal of Allied support from the Zečniks. With troops in position to the west, east, and south of Samejevo, the RNA carried out its first full-fledged military operation - "Operation Nonstop Story." The resulting Battle of Samejevo saw the defeat of Royalist and Zečnik forces, as well as the capture of Queen Luna I by the communists. Meanwhile, the Axis Powers, who were dealing with the Soviet counteroffensive along its Eastern Front, withdrew their forces from Holoslavia, occupying only a small portion of Northern Oozora from which they would eventually be pushed out of by RNA forces in April 1945. 

### The Second Holoslavia

#### The End of the People's Revolutionary Committee

After the victory in Samejevo, the People's Revolutionary Committee convened its second session in the Old Bloop House to establish the basis for the post-revolutionary organization of the country. On November 29, 1944, the third day of the session, 76% of the 200 members voted in favor of establishing a federation with the People's Revolutionary Committee as its federal executive and legislative body. Governance of the federation's component republics, meanwhile, would fall into the hands of the regional revolutionary committees. A motion was also passed to draft the constitution of the new federation. 

But the biggest decision of the Old Bloop House session was what to do with Queen Luna I. There was a unanimous decision amongst all committee members that she should be executed "for crimes against the Holoslav people," but no consensus could be reached as to the manner it would be carried out. Some members preferred her to go through trial for her crimes and be executed via firing squad, while others advocated for her execution via guillotine. A third faction was in favor of executing her via guillotine, but in secret. Before that, she would be given a purposefully lengthened trial. After a week of deliberation, a 12-member committee called the "Committee of 12" was formed to decide how Luna I would be executed, and three days later the committee came to another impasse - whether or not Luna I should be given a trial at all. To tackle this matter, a 6-member committee called the "Committee of Six" was established to decide on the matter via a secret ballot with Marshal Yagoo as the seventh tie-breaker. This led to the final decision on December 25, 1944, to publicly execute Luna I with the guillotine with a purposefully lengthened [ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] show[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] trial. 

By the beginning of 1945, the RNA was clearing out Axis and Royalist remnants from the remaining parts of Oozora, and the cantons of Lisnodina and Veverica. By the end of April 1945, the remaining northern and southern parts of Holoslavia were liberated, with chunks of Austrian and Ichikaran territory occupied by Holoslav troops. Using the momentum of the war for coverage from the international press[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], the People's Revolutionary Committee declared Holoslavia as, once again, a fully intact state with its borders closely resembling the pre-1938 form. The PRC also approved and publicized the communist-drafted constitution and declared the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Federativna Narodna Republika Holoslavija / Федеративна Народна Република Холославија), with the League of Communists of Holoslavia (Peko-Oozoran: Savez komunista Holoslavije / Савез комуниста Холославије) or SKH as its sole party. 

The new federation was divided into five constituent republics, corresponding with the People's Revolutionary Council's six constituent regional revolutionary councils - the Socialist Republic of Atlantia (SR Atlantia), the Socialist Republic of Oozora (SR Oozora), the Socialist Republic of Kroniigovina (SR Kroniigovina), the Socialist Republic of Pekoland (SR Pekoland), and the Socialist Republic of the Moomjerina (SR Moomjerina). However, unknown to the Committee, the Moomjerina had seceded from the Kingdom of Holoslavia during The Revolution, declaring itself the "Sublime Moomiphate of the Moomjerina" (Ichikaran: Moomjerina'nın Yüce Moomiphate'i; Arabic: سوبريم موم إيفات مومجيرينا), an independent theocracy with governance based on radical Hoomani law. The Committee declared that it "perhaps forgor"[sic] about the Moomjerina, so it sent the RNA to annex the territory in May. The First Moomjerina Intervention, which lasted two months, was the bloodiest conflict of the post-war era, with an estimated 96,000 RNA personnel (1/5ths of the RNA at the time) and 176,000 Moomjerin separatists and civilians dead. 

Using the significant casualties of the Moomjerina Intervention as an example of the Committee's lack of oversight over the state's affairs, Marshal Yagoo pressured it to install a President who would keep track of and note the body's decisions. With his popularity among members of the committee, Yagoo was declared President with a 52% percent vote. He subsequently pushed for amendments to the constitution to de-power the People's Revolutionary Committee and the regional revolutionary committees. In a de facto coup[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] with the help of committee members personally loyal to him, Yagoo turned the PRC into the Federal Assembly - a purely legislative body with no executive powers. The regional committees were subsequently turned into Federal Councils with the same limited mandate. He also renamed the Federal People's Republic of Holoslavia into the Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia. With the approval of SKH General Secretary Kitase Asuka, Yagoo declared himself as the "Grand Marshal of the Federation" on June 25, 1945, with executive powers and command of the military centralized in him. The next day on June 26, 1945, the new government signed the United Nations Charter using the name "SFR Holoslavia".

#### Post-Revolutionary Period and Luna I's Trial

Following Yagoo's ascension to the Marshalship of the new federation, his first order of business was to carry out Luna I's trial, which had been delayed due to the annexation of the Moomjerina. Dubbed "The Trial of the Century," Luna I was brought before a judge and 12 jurors in the People's Courthouse (the former courthouse of the Royal Court for the Protection of the State). In a series of 12 weekly trials, Luna I's role in the war crimes carried out by the Oostaše under her command was scrutinized along with her collaboration with imperialist powers, treason against the Holoslav people, tyranny, collaboration with the Axis Powers, political repression, economic exploitation of Pekoland, suppression of The Revolution, racial discrimination, being an Ichikaran, playing the piano "in a bourgeois way" on a Tuesday[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], and one trial where the judge and jury simply ate candy in front of the former queen (who hadn't been fed for three days prior). 

On October 7, 1945, Luna I was declared guilty on all 11 charges and sentenced to death by guillotine. On October 10, her birthday, the queen was brought to the People's Square in Samejevo, where State Security Service (Peko-Oozoran: Uprava državne bezbednosti / Управа државне безбедности) or UDBA agents administering her execution asked if she had any last words. To this, she replied, "I have no regrets nanora."[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] She was guillotined afterward, though her head and body were not put on public display and so were cremated the next day. After two days, the urn containing her ashes had gone missing, with communist authorities reporting that they had "no idea" where it went. It is speculated that the ashes and urn were secretly tossed into the Mijacka River.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] Following Luna I's death, an estimated 2,569 members of the former Holoslav monarchy that were under communist detention were executed without trial in secret.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] 

Grand Marshal Yagoo then made a public declaration that stripped Holoslav citizenship from the nobles who managed to emigrate from the country at the time of the Revolution. As for the nobility's former possessions, the communist government made a point of destroying "all symbols of bourgeois wealth", with the UDBA facilitating the destruction of paintings, statues, foreign-made cars, and mansions that belonged to the nobility in highly-publicized displays. The biggest of these displays was the demolition of Luna I's palace in Samejevo, on January 2, 1946. However, other valuable assets like gold, jewels, and stock certificates were sold in the black market by the UDBA in secret to fund the economic ventures of the three noble families that clandestinely collaborated with the communist movement during The Revolution: the Takanashis, the Pavolias, and the Natsuiros.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] The leaders of the three families, Takanashi Ferdinand (the former Archduke of Oozora), Pavolia Pochi (the former Emira of Atlantia), and Natsuiro Mamatsuri (the former Emira of Rratovo) would later take on roles in the socialist government concerning the federation's economic affairs - the Ministries of Resources, Industry, and Finance respectively - under assumed names.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] 

#### The Yagoo-Stalin Split 

The new federal government's purge of the nobility and execution of Luna I drew condemnation from the Allies and other countries, most notably the newly established Democratic People's Republic of Ichikara - an authoritarian right-wing regime led by Tazumi Riku after his overthrow of the Nijiman Empire through a military coup. Western governments promptly shifted support away from the Holoslavs, with U.S. President Harry Truman and United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie separately declaring Tazumi as an "ally of the free world" in his part of Europe. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin sought the new Federation's membership in the Cominform, having supported the Holoslav Partisans during the revolution through Tokino Sora.

At first, the new Holoslavia closely followed the Stalinist model of economic development, some aspects of which achieved considerable success. In particular, the public works of that period organized by the new government in Samejevo managed to rebuild and even improve infrastructure built during the Kingdom Era (such as the Trans-national Railway) with little cost to the federation. Tensions with the West escalated, however, as Holoslavia joined the Cominform in August 1946. The early phase of the Cold War then began with Holoslavia pursuing an aggressive foreign policy, particularly against Ichikara - which was seen by most Holoslavs as a continuation of the Nijiman Empire that oppressed them through Luna I before The Revolution. The federal government particularly agitated against Ichikara's continued occupation of Misqipëtar, the ancestral land of the Rratovani people which the Nijimans renamed Ethyria, and called for its liberation. Yagoo himself wanted Holoslavia to take Ethyria due to its strategic location along the Adriatic Sea as well as its strategic reserves of chromite, ferronickel, copper, and custard. In September 1947, Yagoo asked the RNA to draw up plans for an invasion[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] of Ethyria. 

Through informants in Holoslavia, the Soviets soon found out about Yagoo's plans to invade Ethyria. Fearing escalating tensions with the West too quickly, Stalin did not approve of the military action. Holoslav representatives Takanashi Ferdinand and Kitase Asuka were summoned to Moscow, where Stalin and his foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov attempted to brow-beat them into convincing Yagoo to put off his planned invasion. In response, the Holoslav delegation walked out from the Moscow meeting, and Yagoo indeed shelved plans for the annexation of Ethyria - but in anticipation of a confrontation with the Soviet Union. 

The Yagoo-Stalin split took place in early 1948, with an exchange of letters directly between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the SKH. In the first CPSU letter in March, the Soviets accused the Holoslavs of denigrating Soviet socialism via statements such as "socialism in the Soviet Union has ceased to be revolutionary". It also claimed that the SKH was not "democratic enough," and that it was not acting as a vanguard that would lead the country to socialism. The Soviets said that they "could not consider such a Communist party organization to be Marxist-Leninist, Bolshevik." The letter also named several high-ranking officials as "dubious Marxists" (Takanashi Ferdinand, Pavolia Pochi, and Natsuiro Mamatsuri) and called on Yagoo to purge them. The Pekolander elements of the SKH supported the Soviet view, but Yagoo himself refused and soon responded with his own letter. The SKH response in April was a strong denial of the Soviet accusations, both defending the revolutionary nature of the SKH and re-asserting its high opinion of the Soviet Union. Though it also noted that, "While the national hero Tokino Sora and, by extension, the Holoslav people hold deep affection for the land of socialism, the Soviet Union, we doubt that she, or we, would have any less love for our own country."

Soon afterward, the CPSU sent a 31-page-long answer in May 1948, admonishing the SKH for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse it of being too proud of their successes against the Royalist and Axis forces, maintaining that the Soviet Union had "saved them from destruction." This time, the Soviets named Yagoo, Takanashi, Pavolia, Natsuiro, and Kitase as the principal "heretics" of the Holoslav Revolution. Yagoo's leadership was also brought into question, with the CPSU highlighting what it called the "utter ridiculousness" of having a former Imperial Japanese Army officer lead one of the largest socialist countries in Eastern Europe. A more scathing accusation came in the form of the CPSU claiming that Yagoo harbored members of the Holoslav nobility in his own government. One day later, the SKH sent its own "1-page-long" reply to the CPSU, which contained the Grand Marshal's handwritten response: "Ogey."[sic]

Another letter was soon sent by the CPSU to the SKH in June, where it demanded the SKH to attend the upcoming Cominform meeting on June 28, 1948, where it said the "Holoslav issue" would be tackled. The Cominform was an association of Communist parties that was the primary Soviet tool for controlling the political developments in the Eastern Bloc. The date of the meeting, 28 June, was carefully chosen by the Soviets as the triple anniversary of the Battle of Rratovo Field (1389), the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Samejevo (1914), and the Nijigrad Declaration (1918). Yagoo, however, refused to attend, sending another 1-page-long letter with the words "Tummy hort."[sic]

On the first day of the meeting, 28 June, the Cominform adopted the prepared text of a resolution, known in Holoslavia as the "Resolution of the Informbiro" (Peko-Oozoran: Rezolucija Informbiroa / Резолуција Информбироа). In it, the other Cominform (Informbiro) members expelled Holoslavia, citing "bourgeois elements" that had "managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership" of the SKH. The resolution warned Holoslavia that it was on the path back to bourgeois capitalism due to its nationalist, independence-minded positions, and accused the party itself of "Trotskyism". Though the SKH denied these claims, relations between Holoslavia and the Soviet Union were severed, beginning the period between 1948 and 1955 known as the Informbiro Period.

#### Informbiro Period and Economic Reforms

After its break with the Soviet Union, Holoslavia found itself economically and politically isolated as its economy - centered around trade with other Eastern Bloc nations - began to falter, with joblessness and supply shortages becoming more and more apparent at the beginning of 1949. At the same time, Stalinist Holoslavs, known as "cominformists", began fomenting civil and military unrest. Mostly made up of Pekolanders and Rratovani, the leaders of the various cominformist rebellions and military insurrections claimed that Yagoo and his "Gang of Four" had betrayed The Revolution and the Stalinist values espoused by its first leader, Tokino Sora. They carried out various attacks against RNA military camps in Pekoland and Rratovo, as well as acts of sabotage beyond those regions. 

However, the UBDA, led by Vestia Zeta, was quick and efficient in cracking down on insurgent activity. To further efficiency, the UBDA was divided into two "stations": the Black Station or Kuro-Eki, which handled clandestine operations against enemies of the state, and the White Station or Shiroi-Eki, which handled crimes that spanned beyond the borders of the constituent republics. An invasion of Holoslavia appeared imminent, as Soviet military units were amassed along the border of Romania, while the Army of the Socialist Republic of Romania increased its size. The UBDA-KE began arresting alleged Cominformists, as well as SKH members who were critical of Yagoo's leadership. Meanwhile, the Revolutionary People's Army was reformed into two forces: the Holoslav People's Army (Peko-Oozoran: Holoslovenska narodna armija / Холословенска народна армија), and the Territorial Defense (Peko-Oozoran: Teritorijalna odbrana / Територијална Oдбрана) forces of each of the constituent republics. The Territorial Defense forces or TOs would act as the official paramilitaries of the republics and carry out guerilla warfare against potential invaders, while the HNA would be the main federal armed force that would destroy the invaders in detail. 

While all this was happening, Yagoo and Holoslav Resources Minister Takanashi Ferdinand began making overtures to the United States and the West through Japan. Consequently, Stalin's plans were thwarted as Holoslavia began shifting its alignment. The West welcomed the Holoslav-Soviet rift and, in 1950 commenced a flow of economic aid, assisted in averting famine that year, and covered much of Holoslavia's trade deficit for the next decade. The United States began shipping weapons to Holoslavia in 1951. Yagoo, however, was wary of becoming too dependent on the West as well, and military security arrangements concluded in 1953 as Holoslavia refused to join NATO and began developing a significant military industry of its own, with assistance from Japanese companies. From here, Holoslav state enterprises would keep close ties with Japanese companies up until the federation's dissolution. 

With the American response in the Korean War serving as an example of the West's commitment to stopping communism, Stalin began backing down from invading Holoslavia. However, Yagoo's own shift to the West forced him to back down from his plans to invade the Ethyria region until the 1970s.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] The Informbiro Period is widely recognized to have ended in 1953 upon Stalin's death by a cerebral hemorrhage, though certain historians claim that Yagoo had him assassinated via cyanide poisoning.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] These arguments remain largely unproven and subject to debate, as definitive evidence is generally absent.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]

Since the Stalinist model of economic development showed weakness during the Informbiro Period, Holoslavia began several economic reforms from 1951 onwards, bringing about change in three major directions - liberalization, a new economic system, and a policy of non-alignment. Taking inspiration from the "New Economic Policy" adopted during the earlier years of the Soviet Union, Holoslavia's economic policy would seek the country's cohabitation with global capitalism while still retaining its socialist values. Its chief proponent, Resources Minister Takanashi Ferdinand, said that the policy would put a greater emphasis "on advancing the material productive forces as the fundamental and necessary prerequisite for building an advanced socialist society". This is in line with classical Marxist thinking where a fully developed socialist planned economy can only come into existence after a market economy has exhausted its historical role, nudged by technological advances that make economic planning possible and render market relations obsolete. But until such technological advancements come to fruition, a system of workers' self-management would be employed wherein profits would be shared amongst workers and the administrators of enterprises would be overseen by Workers' Councils elected by the workers themselves (similar to corporate oversight in capitalist systems where CEOs are overseen by a Board of Directors). 

Though initially denigrated as too "bourgeois-leaning" by the more conservative elements of the SKH, with one Pekolander member calling it "Capitalism with extra steps," Takanashi's "Collab" Economic Policy ('Collab', a shortening of the English word 'Collaboration'; a 'collaboration' between socialist and market pragmatism) was put into effect in 1951, with the establishment of Holoslavia's three major state enterprises: the KFP Corporation, TAZ (Tvornica automobila Zashuba; "Zashuba Car Factory"), and the People's Welfare Fund (Peko-Oozoran: Fond narodnog blagostanja / Фонд народног благостања.) or FNB. The KFP Corporation, under Takanashi, administered production in the country's consumer goods sectors, while TAZ under Pavolia oversaw the production of vehicles, heavy industry, and weaponry. Meanwhile, the People's Welfare Fund under Natsuiro specialized in financial services (workers' insurance, lending, banking) and was Holoslavia's de facto central bank. 

#### Cold War Period and the Uruha Affair

Holoslavia refused to participate in the communist Warsaw Pact due to the Yagoo-Stalin split and instead took a neutral stance in the mid-Cold War period, becoming a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement along with countries like India, Egypt, and Indonesia. At the same time, it pursued center-left policies that promoted a 'non-confrontational' policy toward the United States and closer relations with Japan. On November 2, 1952, the SKH introduced the Holoslav Bill of Rights, which emphasized "personal and talent freedom" and the freedom of "free collabs[sic] between working people". This resulted in a relatively humane[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] communist regime compared to other countries within the Eastern Bloc, though the UBDA-KE and UBDA-SE were still employed as feared tools of government control. Perhaps[ʷʰʸ ᵖᵉʳʰᵃᵖˢˀ] the most infamous of its actions was "Operation Error", wherein UBDA-KE agents assassinated alleged remaining "enemies of the state" who lived in exile overseas, such as former nobles, expelled cominformists, and those who had simply lost favor with Yagoo. The media remained under restrictions that were somewhat onerous by Western standards but still had somewhat more latitude than their counterparts in other communist countries. Nationalist groups were a particular target of the UBDA-SE, with numerous arrests and prison sentences handed down over the years for separatist activities, especially in the Moomjerina and Kroniigovina.

Decentralization of the state's governance, however, was still hotly argued between the Federal Assembly and Yagoo. To strengthen the federal government and its instrumentalities, the marshal pushed for the creation of a "New Capital Region" in the lands bordering Oozora, Atlantia, and Pekoland. This capital would span both the Danube and Sava rivers and centralize Federal agencies scattered across Atlantia, Oozora, and Pekoland. Due to a typographical error in the marshal's speech announcing plans for the new capital region, the city was named "Holodrava" and was designed separately by Brazilian Architect Oscar Niemeyer (who used sketches from his work on the scrapped planned city of Brasilia) and Le Corbusier (who added finishing touches to the finalized city plan in 1955). Work on the New Capital Region began in 1956, lasting 41 months until April 21, 1960, when the city was finally inaugurated. 

Throughout the 1950s and '60s, the Federation's economic development and liberalization continued at a rapid pace. With heavy federal investment, tourism in both SR Oozora and SR Atlantia was promoted, expanded, and transformed into major sources of income for both the federal government and constituent republics. With these successful measures, the Holoslav economy achieved relative self-sufficiency and traded extensively with both the West and the East. It was especially noted to be the only place in the Eastern Bloc where Warsaw Pact tourists could buy imported products from Japan. By the late 60s, foreign observers noted that the country was "booming"[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. Aside from its citizens enjoying far greater liberties than those in the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc states, the country also had a 91% literacy rate, as well as free medical care on all levels of treatment. 

->![Uruha Rushia During Her 'Voice of the People' Idol Concert, Broadcast by RTV Oozora With a Prototype KFP-TV1 Made Under License From The SHARP Corporation, 1972](https://i.imgur.com/wmCtSC2.jpg)<-

However, with this increased liberalization came requests for autonomy from the constituent republics. In 1970, student protests in Atlantia, Kroniigovina, and Pekoland called for increased powers for the constituent republics. Certain members of the SKH also publicly supported these views, most notably SKH 26th Holodrava Chapter Council Secretary Uruha Rushia. Uruha was an SKH member known for employing fiery rhetoric while demanding increased autonomy during Federal Assembly sessions, even questioning Yagoo's changes to the 1945 constitution that sidelined the original People's Revolutionary Committees into mere legislative roles (though she would later retract these statements)[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

She was especially popular among the SKH's male members and often held hours-long televised or radio broadcast shows called "razgovori" (idle conversation) where she would read out grievances by individual SKH members and other callers sent in anonymously via telephone. The intent of her show, "Glas Naroda" (Voice of the People), was to use mass media to notify the SKH high leadership, especially Marshal Yagoo, of local and national issues such as increased nepotism in the hiring of workers and admission to the SKH ('Nepotizam"), alleged corruption in workers' councils ("Supachats," with 'Supa' being a slang word for money, and 'chat'), and increased ethnic tensions between citizens ("Tribalizam"). She would then end every show with a call on the SKH leadership to reform the constitution. To attract more listeners and viewers, Uruha did other activities during her show, such as cooking, singing SKH-approved songs on request, and even the first broadcast of a video game on Holoslav television with her playing the American titles "Spacewar!" and "Pong" in 1972. Glas naroda became Holoslavia's most-watched radio-television show in 1972, spawning a wave of imitators and the "razgovori" genre of TV shows.

However, during a broadcast of Glas naroda on February 10, 1973, Uruha read out a message that was also flashed on screen. But instead of a message from one of the show's viewers, it was the beginning of a personal letter between Uruha and an unidentified male. The message drew surprise from many of the show's viewers, but Uruha herself tried to downplay the 'mistaken missive'. Meanwhile, the SKH leadership, who have been looking for a way to silence Uruha[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], declared an investigation into what it called a possible "breach of public trust unbecoming of a member of the League of Communists." 

Thus began what the press called the "Uruha Affair", where Uruha was summoned before the People's Courthouse to testify on the origin of the message publicized on her show. Investigations by the UBDA-KE revealed that the message came from a manager at the People's Welfare Fund. Through a string of managers and bank accounts, Uruha was charged with taking payments from the leadership of the People's Welfare Fund. Finance Minister Natsuiro Mamamatsuri resigned from her chairwomanship of the FNB soon after the allegations came to light, while Uruha herself tried to air her side through her show. But on February 24, 1973, the SKH announced Uruha's expulsion from the League, while also banning her from broadcasting at state-run radio and television facilities. Disgraced, the former League member left the country shortly thereafter. Uruha would be assassinated with an icepick seven years later in Mexico.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]

But immediately after her expulsion from the SKH, protests flared up across the constituent republic, with students, professionals, and dedicated fans expressing outrage at a perceived curtailment of rights to free speech. The "MASPOK" (a portmanteau of masovni porket or 'mass movement') Protests led to the Pekoland Spring of 1973, which Yagoo responded to by purging the Pekoland League of Communists and arresting large numbers of Pekolander, Atlantian, and Oozoran protesters. But at the same time, in the hopes of avoiding ethnically-driven protests in the future, the Yagoo also began to initiate some of the reforms demanded by the protests. This led to the Constitutional Convention that year and the eventual adoption of the new Holoslav Constitution in 1974. 

#### The 1974 Constitution and the 'Off-Collab' Economic Policy

->![The Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia After The 1974 Constitution (Note: New Capital Region Not Shown)](https://i.imgur.com/jcWSlMM.jpg)<-

The 1974 Constitution gave the constituent republics more control over their own economies, which led to a wave of investments (mainly from the West and Japan). However, this spurred a growing level of debt, as well as a growing trade deficit which led to a slow but steady devaluation of the Holodinar. The constitution also gave economic and legal autonomy to two provinces within Pekoland: Rratovo, a largely ethnic Rratovani-populated region, and Lisnodina i Veverica, which was home to Peko-adjacent squirrels and foxes, as well as various minorities such as Phasers and Idolite gypsies from Romania. Though the reforms satisfied most critics, particularly the leadership of the Republics of Oozora and Atlantia, as well as the minorities within Rratovo and LiV, many Pekos felt that the new reforms were a punishment for the Pekoland Spring. This is because no similar autonomous provinces were made to represent the large numbers of Peko or Peko-adjacent people living in Oozora or Atlantia. Pekoland nationalists were also frustrated with Yagoo's recognition of Moomjerins, Kronies, Atlantians, and Rratovani as Holoslav citizens within the constitution. The nationalists claimed that they were ethnically Niji, not ethnically Holo (despite evidence of them being among the tribes displaced and swept into Holoslavia by the Nijimans in the 15th and 16th centuries[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]), thus making them undeserving of citizenship. 

Another change in the 1974 Constitution marked an evolution in economic doctrine, notably impacting the nation's economic trajectory through the implementation of the "Off-Collab" Economic Policy. This new policy emerged following the demise of Ferdinand Takanashi, the chief architect of the "Collab" Economic Policy, in 1972, as well as massive inflation spurred by the 1973 Oil Crisis. Assuming the mantle of influence and responsibility was his daughter and new federal Resources Minister, Takanashi Kiara, who further developed this economic doctrine into the "Off-Collab" model, denoted by the addition of the prefix 'Off' to distinguish it from its predecessor.

The core tenet of the Off-Collab Economic Policy revolved around the establishment of designated 'Special Economic Zones' (Peko-Oozoran: Posebna ekonomska zona / Посебна економска зона) or PEZs within Holoslavia's constituent republics. These zones were designed to operate under more liberalized and market-oriented economic frameworks, providing a conducive environment for both domestic and foreign investment. In practice, this meant the total scrapping of workers' councils, depriving workers of corporate oversight - which was handed to the enterprise's investors and other stakeholders, in line with traditional Capitalism. However, this also meant that export-focused businesses located in these zones could finally respond quickly to demand in foreign markets, especially in Europe and North America. In 1975, the first Special Economic Zone was established in the northern part of SR Oozora, named 'KFP-Stadt' after the KFP Corporation, which was entrusted with the zone's governance and oversight.

The PEZ strategy yielded favorable outcomes, attracting substantial foreign capital predominantly from Japanese companies. These entities sought to leverage the Holoslav PEZs to establish cost-effective production bases in Europe, capitalizing on opportunities in both Western European markets and the Eastern Bloc. By 1976, KFP-Stadt had already enticed investments from a cohort of prominent Japanese conglomerates, including Toyota Motor Corporation, Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Honda, Mitsubishi Corporation, Nissan Motor Corporation, Fujitsu, and Sharp Corporation. Additionally, two Korean entities, Samsung Electric Industries, and Lucky-Goldstar, had also established their presence within the zone. Takanashi Kiara was named the PEZ's Chief Executive, coinciding with her chairmanship of the People's Welfare Fund after the departure of Natsuiro Mamatsuri earlier in the decade.

Among the rules within the PEZ framework was a stipulation that required these foreign companies to have a partner firm within Holoslavia. In almost all cases, this was the KFP Corporation. The tie-up enabled technology transfer between these companies and KFP, though there were also reports of corporate espionage amid these 'off-collab' agreements[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. This arrangement allowed the KFP Corporation to produce licensed copies of consumer electronics made by these companies for domestic sale within Holoslavia. 1976 also saw the opening of a KFP fried chicken restaurant in Samejevo, Atlantia - the first one outside of SR Oozora, marking the expansion of the chicken chain into Holoslavia's other constituent republics and beyond.

The 'Off-Collab' Economic Policy faced criticism from the conservative wing of the SKH, who called it "capitalism in all but name" and a "total betrayal of socialist values". The total non-enforcement of worker's self-management in the zone was a particularly big issue because of how it eroded workers' rights. They argued that the PEZ framework gave Holoslavs no say in the running of PEZ-based enterprises, making them the slaves of both foreign masters who owned 49% of the total stock and their local partner (which in this case was the KFP Corporation). In response, Takanashi called the new economic policy "a recognition of economic reality" that would still result in a transition to a fully socialist model of production "within the next half-century" through technological advancements that would allow automatic resource allocation and the obsolescence of market relations. It was also rumored that the KFP Corporation planned to buy out the stock of its foreign partners sometime in the future[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. This led to the famous phrases coined by Takanashi herself in a speech before the Committee of 48 investigating the PEZ framework: "Socialism with Holoslav characteristics," in describing the framework itself, and "We will bury them" in reference to how Holoslavia's economy could one day outpace Capitalist economies once it has developed itself through the PEZ model and returned to a socialist but more advanced mode of production.

The success of KFP-Stadt prompted plans for another PEZ in Novi Kyuzla, Atlantia, under TAZ and the Pavolia family. However, due to the outbreak of the Second Homeland War in 1977, this development was only completed halfway. Meanwhile, foreign countries, particularly China and Singapore, would later consult Takanashi on similar implementations of the PEZ framework, with a clandestine meeting between her and Chinese Paramount Leader Deng Xiaoping taking place in 1979 in Beijing during the war[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

#### The Brindisi Massacre and the Second Homeland War

->![The Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia and the Democratic People's Republic of Ichikara Before The Outbreak of the Second Homeland War](https://i.imgur.com/jvXq5Wm.jpg)<-

In 1976, the Pekoland League of Communists held a plenum in Pekograde to discuss the creation of the autonomous provinces of Lisnodina i Veverica and Rratovo. Party members reiterated the complaint that while LiV and Rratovo were created due to the heavy presence of non-Peko ethnic minorities in those regions, no autonomous regions were made out of the areas with majority Peko or Peko-adjacent populations such as the Peko Krajina in Oozora, and Banja Polka in Atlantia. In a 14-Point ultimatum addressed to Marshal Yagoo, the party demanded that this be corrected or else they would hold more protests and possibly secede from the Federation. With Pekolanders being the largest ethnic group in Holoslavia, Yagoo knew that purging the Pekoland League of Communists again could backfire and spark further outrage. So in late 1976, the Marshal convened the Executive Committee of the People's Defence Council or "ExComm" consisting of the UBDA, the Federal Secretariat of the People's Defence, and the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Holoslavia in Holodrava to discuss plans on how to deal with a potential mass Pekolander uprising. 

During the meeting, then-UBDA Deputy Director and later SKH General Secretary Omega Alpha suggested that the Pekolanders be given back administrative control of Rratovo, with the local Rratovani population moved elsewhere. When asked where, the Intelligence chief said they could simply be moved to "Misqipëtar," the Niji-occupied Ethyria Region and Rratovani ancestral homeland. Based on war plans drawn up during the Informbiro Period, Omega proposed an invasion of Ethyria with the use of UBDA-trained Rratovani exiles. These exiles would land on the port city of Purgatorio and the coast of the regional capital Malding, supported by both the Holoslav Air Force and the Holoslav War Navy. Once both cities were taken, more Rratovani exiles would enter Ethyria through its border from Rratovo, and a pro-Holoslav government would be put in place. When Yagoo voiced concerns about a potential Ichikaran counter-attack, Omega said that the operation would be made to look like an internal Rratovo/Ethyrian affair, with the Holoslav government supporting the exiles under the pretense of extending military aid and ensuring the region's independence. Yagoo was also assured by the General Staff of the Holoslav Armed Forces and the Minister of the People's Defence that the HNA outnumbered the Ichikaran Land Forces 2 to 1, soundly beating them in any potential land war. 

In December 1976, Yagoo approved the "Bay of Rrats" invasion plan. Through a deal with Italy (which had a fishing rights dispute with Ichikara at the time), 80 Rratovani exiles codenamed 'Brigade 272727' were trained by the UBDA in camps near the towns of Brindisi and Lecce. These 80 would form the initial cadre of the projected 5,000 Rrats that were supposed to invade Ethyria, trained in guerilla operations and both urban and forest warfare. About half of the Rrats that participated in the training were members of the Misqipëtar Brotherhood, a revolutionary organization that sought to reclaim Ethyria as Rratovani land, while the other half were Rratovani recruits under the impression that they were being trained as a special forces unit of the HNA. In January 1977, an advance party of 17 Rrats was sent into Ethyria to conduct reconnaissance and psychological warfare. Upon their return to Italy, the non-Brotherhood Rratovani learned of the true nature of their training and immediately staged a mutiny, resulting in a firefight at the Brindisi camp between the Brotherhood and non-Brotherhood Rrats. Meanwhile, the Holoslav and Italian governments, wary of the international scandal that could result from the plan's discovery, agreed to cover up the operation and kill all those involved[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

An estimated 72 to 79 of the 80 Rrats were killed by UBDA agents and Italian troops in what would be known as the Brindisi Massacre. A few of them escaped back to Holoslavia, picked up by Kronegrin smugglers[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], who then leaked details of the botched invasion plan to the press. Despite the extensive press blackout staged by the UBDA, details of the massacre still made it to Ichikara's National Intelligence Organization (Ichikaran: Millî İstihbarat Teşkilatı). Fearing a Holoslav invasion, Ichikaran Chancellor Tazumi Riku ordered the drawing up of pre-emptive invasion plans, and by April 1977 the Ichikaran Land Forces were ready to penetrate Holoslavia. Meanwhile, the Holoslav government and military, still dealing with the fallout of the massacre, were unaware of the forces being massed along the Federation's borders with the Ethyria and Obsydia regions until May. Marshal Yagoo himself was in Paris in a meeting with U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, where they both tried to pacify Carter and explain the nature of the Bay of Rrats plan.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] UBDA Deputy Director Alpha Omega was also sacked during this time for his role in the botched cover-up, but he managed to retain his SKH membership. 
 
Then, on June 22, 1977, after an hour-long speech where Chancellor Tazumi castigated the Holoslav government for its plans to 'sully the territorial integrity' of Ichikara, five infantry battalions of the Ichikaran Land Forces supported by two armored brigades crossed the Ethyria-Kroniigovina border, kick-staring the Second Homeland War.

### Post-War Second Holoslavia 

#### The Hoomani Rebellion

Following the end of the Second Homeland War and the Dayton Armistice, the HNA began a program of demobilization. Authorities sought to demobilize 40% of the HNA's total manpower, as well as all armed resistance groups that had been formed in the occupation zones. However, many Moomjerin soldiers refused to surrender their arms and/or did not arrive when called back to their barracks. In January 1988, Federal President Usada Pekora issued an ultimatum to Moomjerin soldiers who refused to surrender their arms: be arrested for possession of government property, or keep their weapons by joining the new Moomjerina Territorial Defence force. 80% of former Moomjerin HNA troopers applied to join the TO, including Sergeant Nanashi Mumei. 

However, the process of joining the Moomjerina TO was rigorous, with a written exam purposefully made to filter out most applicants. The true purpose of the exams was to acquire the weapons of former troopers without a fight (applicants were required to surrender their arms before being allowed to take the exam)[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. Nanashi Mumei took the test two times between January and February but failed both attempts, frustrating her plans to become a territorial defense officer and leading to a nervous breakdown. While in the hospital, Nanashi dreamed of visiting Heaven, where she discovered her supposed ties to a heavenly father who was different from her earthly father. Her heavenly father lamented the Second Homeland War, saying that it was the result of men worshipping demons such as Grand Marshal Yagoo rather than Him. The father also said that Nanashi was the sister of the Holoslav national hero Tokino Sora. Therefore, it was up to Nanashi to lead her people back "to the true path". 

Though Nanashi recovered from her convalescence, she was reported to be "catatonic" for the next two days, before rising on the third day to fail the TO exam for the third and final time. A chance meeting with her cousin, however, exposed Nanashi to the belief of Soranism - a variant of folk Catholicism practiced in Rratovo and parts of the Moomjerina which believed in the divinity of Tokino Sora and her supposed role as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. It was through this lens that Nanashi interpreted her dreams: her heavenly father was the Abrahamic God, and being the sister of Tokino Sora made Nanashi the technical sister of Christ. Meanwhile, the 'demons' described to her in the dream were Grand Marshal Yagoo and the communist Holoslav authorities holding power over the Moomjerina. 

After being refused baptism by a Christian priest that deemed her "not of sound mind", Nanashi began preaching in her home village of Sovinjak in April. It was here that she gained her first follower, "Friend", who records describe[ʷʰᵃᵗ ʳᵉᶜᵒʳᵈˢˀ] as a "heavyset black-skinned Moomjerin man with a paper bag on his head"[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], followed by a few ex-HNA troopers who, like Nanashi, failed the Moomjerina TO exams. Nanashi named the group the 'Hoomani Liberation Society' (Moomjerin: Osloboditelno društvo Hoomani / Ослободително друштво Хоомани), a movement that fused Nanashi's interpretation of Soranism, Catholicism, and anti-war sentiment. Later on, believers of the former Sublime Moomiphate of the Moomjerina would syncretize the movement's teachings with radical Hoomani Law. 

The moment, being mostly made up of disgruntled and armed Hoomani ex-soldiers grew by suppressing groups of bandits and highwaymen that had spread across southern Holoslavia following the Second Homeland War. Word of the Hoomani Liberation Society soon spread to Eulenburg, prompting the Moomjerina Federal Administration to send the Third Infantry Brigade of the Territorial Defence forces to Sovinjak and suppress the movement. However, upon arrival at Sovinjak, Nanashi was able to convince the troops, made up mostly of fellow Moomjerins, to defect to her flock. The sending of more Territorial Defence troops resulted in even further defections, as well as stockpiles of equipment falling into the hands of the Hoomanis. This mass defection prompted the Federal Administration to declare a state of emergency over the southern Moomjerina, as well as the calling of federal troops to put down the growing rebellion. 

By June, the Hoomani Liberation Society numbered around 125,000 active members in the Southern Moomjerina as it spread to the towns of Sovačka Maala, Sovec, and Sovenj Gradec. Nanashi also renamed the movement as the "Hoomani Liberation Front," reflecting what she called its 'heavenly partisan nature' and its objective of banishing demons from the Moomjerina. The core military doctrines of the movement, as well as stages of its crusade, the 'Clashing of Feathers', were also established during this month. Nanashi defined the Front's core doctrines as the following:

!!! info
	1. The Front must spread the True Path offered by the movement to the entire Moomjerina
	2. The Front must carry out a protracted heavenly armed crusade against the demons leading the Moomjerina astray
	3. The Front must occupy the countryside and encircle the cities, keeping the demons isolated until conditions are ripe to purge them through a heavenly offensive

Meanwhile, the three stages of the Front's crusade, "The Clashing of Feathers", were defined as the following: 

!!! info
	1. Heavenly Defensive - Recognition that the demons are too numerous and too strong for the Front to fight in direct battle. Focus must be directed toward proselytizing to the masses and showing them the true path, thus winning their support
	2. Heavenly Stalemate - The Front has gathered sufficient numbers to keep the demons isolated in the major cities, and prevent more demons from entering the Moomjerina unchallenged. At this stage, the Front can carry out tactical purges (i.e. bombings) in the cities to keep the remaining demons distracted and frightened
	3. Heavenly Offensive - The Front has developed enough strength to strike the demons' military camps and cities, enabling it to purge them from the Moomjerina

With these objectives in mind, the Hoomanis began expanding in the Southern Moomjerina, ejecting Milicija personnel and local governments from the towns of Sovichec and Sovoluk in July. August saw the Hoomanis take over their first big city - Kugjursko, the regional capital of the Southern Moomjerina. With the rebellion occupying a third of the Moomjerina, the 23rd and 24th Guards Rifle Divisions were sent to the south in August to suppress the rebellion, along with the 6th Air Wing of the Holoslav Air Force. Details are scarce as to the results of the operation[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], but numbers leaked to the media estimate that from the 30,000 troops sent into the Southern Moomjerina, only 17,000 returned[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. The Moomjerina Federal Authority opted for a policy of "containment"[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] where they would centralize their forces in the Moomjerina's largest cities while conducting anti-insurgency operations against the Hoomanis in the countryside.

## Economy

Despite their common origins, the socialist economy of Holoslavia was much different from the economy of the Soviet Union and the economies of the Eastern Bloc, especially after the Yagoo-Stalin Split. Though there were many state-owned enterprises of varying sizes, Holoslav companies were nominally collectively managed by the employees themselves through the Workers' Self-Management framework, albeit with state oversight dictating wage bills and the hiring and firing of managers. Exceptions to this rule were the country's three major state enterprises: KFP, TAZ, and FNB, which were all administered by party officials rumored to be former nobles who collaborated with the communists during the First Homeland War[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

Due to Holoslavia's neutrality and leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement, Holoslav companies exported to both Western and Eastern markets. Holoslav also companies carried out the construction of numerous major infrastructural and industrial projects in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Following the Second Homeland War, enterprises like the KFP Corporation leveraged the federation's high numbers of former soldiers by entering the military contractor market through subsidiaries such as Gruppa Pheonix and Chickenfeather Associates. 

Following reforms made in the 1974 Constitution, the country's workers' councils were reformed into 'organizations of associated labor,' where those who had a right to decision-making and profit sharing were decided by an individual's investment of labor rather than the mere fact that they were employed by the enterprise. This, in effect, was a more stringent way of preventing 'nepotizam' and 'supachats' which had been complained about heavily in the 1960s and early 70s in regards to the old workers' councils. 

However, the results of the reforms were deemed unsatisfactory[ʷʰᵒ ˢᵃᶦᵈ ˢᵒˀ]. In practice, the appointment of managers and the strategic policies of the organizations were often subject to political and personal influence-peddling, leading yet again to the issues of nepotism and corruption. The problem was exacerbated by rampant wage inflation, leading to a substantial rundown of an enterprise's capital and eventual bankruptcy. This led to a widening income gap between the poorer Southern regions of Holoslavia made up of Atlantia, Kroniigovina, Rratovo, and parts of Pekoland, and the more affluent Northern regions of Oozora, Lisnodina i Veverica, and the rest of Pekoland, as more companies in the southern regions closed down, which in turn propelled unemployment in those regions. The after-effects of the 1973 Oil Crisis magnified Holoslavia's economic problems, which the government tried to solve with the PEZ framework.

However, after the relatively prosperous '60s and early '70s, life conditions deteriorated rapidly in Holoslavia in the late '70s and '80s due to the outbreak of the Second Homeland War, which further devastated much of Southern Holoslavia and curtailed further development of PEZs in the country. The war and its expenses also forced the government to resort to extensive foreign borrowing from global entities such as the IMF, the OECD, and the COMECON. By 1981, Holoslavia's foreign debt was growing at an annual rate of 20%. 

The Second Homeland War ended in 1987, in which the Holoslav State Council signed an armistice agreement with the Military Leadership of the Democratic Republic of Ichikara (Ichikaran: İçikara Demokratik Halk Cumhuriyeti'nin Askeri Liderliği). Unemployment and inflation soared, with unemployment at over 17%, with another 20% underemployed. 60% of the unemployed were under the age of 25 and were out of jobs after the massive demobilization that followed The War. Between 1983 and 1989, the Holodinar plunged from 15 to 1,370 to the U.S. dollar, with half of the income from the country's exports used for debt servicing. 

Emigration from the country surged in 1989, with 20 percent of the country's labor force or 1.1 million workers already employed abroad, mainly in West Germany, Japan, and the United States. Remittances to Holoslavia totaled over $6.2 billion in 1990, amounting to 19% of the world's total at the time. Though this helped stabilize unemployment and acted as a source of foreign currency, it was not enough to sustain payments to both Western countries and COMECON. 

In 1991, Resources Minister Takanashi Kiara met with U.S. President Michael Dukakis to negotiate a new financial aid package. In return for the assistance, Holoslavia would have to agree to sweeping economic reforms such as a new devalued currency, new wage freezes, sharp cuts in government spending, and the total elimination of worker-managed enterprises. Though Takanashi agreed to these stipulations, the Federal Assembly, the leadership of the SKH, and Federal President Usada Pekora were all against approving the plan, leading to the financial aid deal being scrapped entirely. Takanashi attempted to negotiate a similar financial aid deal with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, but talks were put on pause due to the deaths of both Gorbachev and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic President Boris Yeltsin during the Soviet August 1991 Revolution. Though talks resumed in November, the succeeding Soviet Premier, Gennady Yanayev, stipulated the establishment of a military base in Pekoland in exchange for the deal. This was disapproved by the SKH and the Holoslav State Council including Takanashi, leading to a breakdown in negotiations by December. 

By 1992, Holoslavia owed a combined $42 billion to both Western countries and COMECON, which was to increase annually had the country not defaulted due to its dissolution in 1993. 

## Culture and Society

### Pop Music

Holoslavia had a moderately high degree of artistic and musical freedom, owing in part to the Yagoo-Stalin split, which saw the country pursue positive relations with many countries outside the Eastern Bloc. This resulted in a diverse array of stylistic influences from throughout the world. Western-influenced pop music was socially accepted, more so than in Eastern Bloc countries, and was well-covered in the media, which included numerous concerts, music magazines, radio, and TV shows. Aspiring artists could travel to the capitalist countries of Western Europe and Japan, and then bring back musical instruments and equipment. 

Holoslavia's economy grew rapidly during the 1950s, enabling more resources to be allocated to consumer goods, including music. The number of radios in the country increased dramatically with the KFP Corporation's introduction of the KFP-R1 radio and record player in 1956. Increasing demand for both vinyl records and radio broadcasts led to an explosion in the production of records as well as the establishment of local radio stations across the country. 

While still tolerant of foreign music, Holoslavia's political leaders also sought to develop popular music which they felt embodied the country's own national identity. Since many in the SKH leadership continued to perceive American cultural influences such as Jazz, Blues, and Country as propagandistic, stricter import controls were placed on American vinyl records. To get around these restrictions, Holoslavia's music importers bought versions of this music from Japan[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], leading to a heavy Japanese influence on the local Holoslav music scene, which then gave rise to notable names such as Dustan Fennec, Olivia Peković, and Aki Rosenthal. In the 60s, Holoslav versions of Japanese covers of songs by Western bands like The Beatles and Rolling Stones gave rise to the Holoslav rock scene, as well as a sub-genre of Japanese-influenced popular music called "Holo-Jap"[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

Perhaps[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] the largest influence on the Holoslav music scene was the popularity of young female Japanese singers such as Sayuri Yoshinaga, the Japanese boy band "Johnnys", and the local Holoslav release of the 1963 French film Cherchez l'idole in 1968. In Japan, the film led to the term "idol" being used to denote youthful female singers with musical talent. By 1970, the growing popularity of Japanese "Idol" music soon spread to Holoslavia, coinciding with the spread of televisions in the country and the establishment of the RTV Holoslavia network that year. To fill airtime between news and government broadcasts, RTV Holoslavia and its constituent networks showed concerts by Japanese idols such as Junko Sakurada, Mari Amachi, and, later, Saori Minami. 

1972 saw the rise to television prominence of SKH member Uruha Rushia, with her show 'Glas naroda' giving rise to a new sub-genre of television shows called "razgovori" (idle conversation). During this time, she also released a couple of singles: "Iris" and "Omoiku", which were both influenced by Japanese idol music. These songs both hold the record of the most-sold pieces of Holoslav music according to the Guinness Book of Records, with a combined 3.2 million copies sold in both vinyl record and cassette tape formats. Some scholars claim that this made Uruha Holoslavia's first idol, though others argue that the distinction should belong to the country's national hero Tokino Sora, who made a song cover of the Spanish Partisan song "¡Ay Carmela!" with several copies in vinyl record format[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. 

Following the Uruha Affair, other artists tried to imitate Uruha's success by broadcasting their own razgovori shows and then releasing albums of their songs in Holoslavia and other countries such as Japan and the Eastern Bloc. But the most successful[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] of these was AZKi, who first made her debut on Holoslav television in 1983 as the model and spokeswoman of the Union of Pioneers of Holoslavia (a movement similar to the Boy/Girl Scouts) during the Second Homeland War. Her razgovori show, "Pogodi!" ("Guess!"), was designed to teach children how to read military maps and recognize enemy encampments and units, though it became more popular among active soldiers, with an estimated viewership of 20 to 30,000 people and up to 800 phone calls received per broadcast. 

Due to her popularity among soldiers, AZKi was transferred to "Grupa InoNaka," a production outfit put up by the Holoslav federal government to provide entertainment to soldiers and raise morale during The War. During this time, AZKi has rebranded as a classic Japanese style Idol singer, with songs titled in Japanese such as "Inochi," and "Aoi Yume," as well as English-titled pieces like "Take Me To Heaven". Her most popular song[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], however, was the pop-rock song "Rock Me". Unlike AZKi's previous songs, Rock Me was sung mostly in Peko-Oozoran instead of Japanese. Rock Me was eventually made Holoslavia's entry into the 1989 Eurovision Song Contest, where it won, marking the country's only first place in the competition during its history. 

### Turbo-pop

In Pekoland, where anti-Nijiman and anti-Ichikaran sentiment is the strongest among Holoslavia's constituent republics[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ], musicians rejected the spread of Japanese-inspired songs. With Japanese influence being a by-product of Nijiman rule, Pekolander and Peko-adjacent musicians instead leaned toward more traditional folk music. This gave rise to the sub-genre of "Turbo-pop" in the early 70s, a sub-genre of pop music blending Peko folk music with other genres such as pop, rock, R&B, electro, and hip-hop. 

Turbo-pop emerged as a subculture in the countryside of North Pekoland, before emerging in the music scene of Veverica i Lisnodina during the Second Homeland War. The genre only continued to grow in popularity during the 80s and 90s, when anti-Niji sentiment and a rejection of Japanese-style music in these areas were at their peak. The burgeoning sub-genre's most popular musician was Veverican singer Maximilia Magnus (real name: Ayunda Risu), who first coined the term "Turbo-pop" while jokingly referring to her own style of music in an interview on RTV ViL[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ]. Magnus is known for popular Turbo-pop songs during the Holoslav Wars such as "Oy Aqua, Aqua!" where she lambasted Atlantian President Minato Aqua, "Nousagi" which praised the famed Pekolander military unit "Garda Nousagi", and "Crni Bombarder" (The Black Bombers) which slammed the bombing of ViL and the rest of Pekoland by HNA-KFP forces in the later stages of the War.

Critics have described Magnus' music (and the music of other Turbo-pop singers) as "vulgar, almost pornographic kitsch, glorifying crime, moral corruption, and nationalist xenophobia" that glorified the regime of Ookami Mio. Among other descriptions, Turbo-pop has been described as "aggressive, sadistic, and pornographically eroticized iconography," as well as "porno-nationalism". Many Turbo-pop songs are treated as "soundtracks"[ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] to The Holoslav Wars of the 90s, with new Turbo-pop singers emerging in the individual republics of Atlantia, Oozora, and Kroniigovina. These singers were often funded by their respective governments to promote nationalism as well as prejudice toward people in the other republics.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] 

### Japanophilia  

Despite being located in Eastern Europe, Holoslavia and its successor states exhibit a near-fascination for Japanese culture, history, and even language, with many Japanese loan words incorporated into the Peko-Oozoran language as early as the 18th century. Most scholars agree that Japanese influence in Holoslavia was a by-product of colonial rule by the Nijiman Empire, who themselves had long-standing trade and cultural relations with Japan. 

The first integration of Japanese culture into Holoslav society was the Nijimans' policy of pressuring Holoslavs under their rule to adopt Nijiman names and identify as such. Most Nijiman names are themselves adopted from Japanese names, as decreed by the Nijiman Sultan Kuzuha I who adopted his own name following his conquest of Constantinople in 1453. This led to the policy of "Soshi-kaimei" ("Create a surname, change your given name"), which aimed at forcibly assimilating Holoslavs, and is considered by historians as one of the many aspects of cultural genocide that the Nijimans attempted to impose on their non-Niji territories. Since the start of the Nijiman Imperial Census in 1852, an estimated 60 to 70 percent of Holoslavs had already adopted "Nijiman-style" names, with the sole exception of Pekoland where there was only a 35 to 40 percent adoption rate. 

Following the Nijigrad Declaration, the adoption of Nijiman-style names among Holoslavs went down but never went away completely, with as much as 55% still using Nijiman-style names during the time of the Kingdom of Holoslavia. This was also the time when Holoslavs began importing more products of Japanese culture such as tea, silk, and katanas[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] (the importation of these items were controlled in the Occupied Territories of the  Nijiman Empire). The migration of Japanese nationals also increased during this period. 

From the end of the First Homeland War to the early 1950s, interest in Japanese culture waned due to Japan's cooperation with Holoslavia's royalist government. However, increased economic cooperation between Holoslavia and Japan saw a revival in Japanese cultural interest during the 60s and 70s in the form of anime, cuisine, and idol culture. During this time, the Holoslav "Shinnichi" (lit. "Pro-Japan") subculture emerged, where Holoslavs self-identified as Japanese due to their fascination with Japanese culture. The term was coined in 1973 by Holodrava University Japan Studies professor and musician Mori Calliope, who described herself as "Japanac u duhu" (lit. "Japanese in spirit."). Both terms are popular among Holoslav Japanophiles, as well as Japanophiles in Holoslavia's successor republics following the federation's dissolution. 

## Legacy

### The Former Holoslavia

The present-day states which succeeded Holoslavia are still sometimes collectively referred to as the former Holoslavia. These countries are listed chronologically:

- Rratovo-Kroniigovina (since 1997)
	- Rratovo (since 1992)
	- Kroniigovina (since 1993)
- Atlantia (since 1993)
- Moomjerina (since 1993)
- Pekoland (since 1994)
- KFP-Oozora (since 1994; formerly the Federal Republic of Holoslavia)

In 2001, the former constituent republics reached the partially implemented Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Holoslavia that became effective on June 2, 2004. 

All of the successor states are or were candidates for European Union Membership, with KFP-Oozora joining in 2004, followed by Atlantia in 2013. Pekoland and Rratovo-Kroniigovina are official candidates, while Moomjerina has submitted an application. All states of the former Holoslavia have subscribed to the Stabilization and Association Process with the EU. 

The successor states of Holoslavia continue to have a population growth that is close to zero or negative. This is mostly due to emigration, which intensified during the Holoslav Wars, as well as low birth rates. More than 2.5 million refugees were created by the fighting in Rratovo and Atlantia, which led to a massive surge in immigration to North America and Japan. Close to 120,000 refugees from the former Holoslavia were registered in the United States from 1991 to 2002, while 67,000 migrants were registered in Japan between 1991 and 2001. 

No supra-national organization on the level of the SFRH had formed between the successor states since the Holoslav Wars. The closest, however, is the Union of Southern Holoslavia (Kronegrin: Savez južne Holoslavije / Савез јужне Холославије), an economic cooperation and development treaty signed between the republics of Rratovo-Kroniigovina and the Moomjerina in 2001. Currently, the organization focuses on bringing back pre-dissolution economic integration between the three republics, though it is also rumored to be a defense pact against the Democratic People's Republic of Ichikara to the south.[ᶜⁱᵗᵃᵗⁱᵒⁿ ⁿᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ] 

Remembrance of the time of the SFRH and its perceived positive attributes such as social stability, the possibility to travel freely, the level of education, and the welfare system is typically referred to as Holo-nostalgia. People who identify with the former Holoslav state may self-identify as Holoslavs. The social, linguistic, economic, and cultural ties between the former Holoslav countries are sometimes referred to as the "Holobox."
