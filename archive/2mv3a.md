Accumulation of Round 1 Vote Results, 17/03/2022 23:00 GMT
Voting parties: Sakuran (>>20287032,>> 20287077), /nasa/ (>>20287983, >>20288505), /who/ (>>20291623), /wg/ (>>20291913), /meat/ (>>20309473), Hoshiyomia (>>20294554), /inf/ (>>20304482), /nasfaqg/ (>>20329504, >>20329544), /rrat/ (>>20379004)
Total: 9/92(+schizo wastelands) threads, ~10%

Preliminary notes:
Keep in mind that my knowledge in writing such documents is limited, also I’m ESL, so this won’t be the easiest piece to read. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome.
The voter size needs to be noted. We have reps for roughly 10% of the potential nations. Whether that’s a satisfying number I won’t comment on, but I do think it would be good to keep in mind.
Specific comments: 
/wg/, I appreciate that you decided to combine your answers of every section in a continuous paragraph instead of points, as I understand that is how you would perhaps prefer to do it, being from /wg/ and all. However, the reason I had the questions set in points to begin with, was to be able to get the relevant answers quickly and accurately. I realise that may break the flow of writing, but this had the effect of me trying to glean your answers from your text and making slight conjectures to fit them in the relevant format, which made my job slightly more difficult. I would prefer that next time, if the questions are given in points, you also try to answer in style.
/rrat/, I see you only decided to answer a few of the questions. It was not much of a problem, apart from writing No vote and Abstain to a lot of votes, but I would like to ask if there was any particular reason for that, as I am curious.
/inf/, small comment, but after the initial rep vote, you skipped the next 4 that were related to it. I understand that at a first glance that would make sense, but for 3 of those your answer would have still been relevant, even if you answered N to the initial prompt.
Also, it seems some of my prompts were either not very clear or were lacking critical information, for which I would like to apologise. 

(Note: Y=Yay, N=Nay, U/A=Undecided/Abstain, n/a=not applicable)

/rrat/: Abstain, not aware of the situation
Summary: 3Y, 6A. Vote does not pass. It seems most voters were not aware of the situation to vote. Will be explained further below. TBD

/meat/: old space of /pyon/, even /gorls/ and other inactive threads if necessary
/nasfaqg/: n/a
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: Most in favour of taking over /pyon/’s previous land. If the previous vote passes, that is where /isreal/ and /aa/ will be sent.

>Similarly, regarding any new threads added from here on out, what do you propose is done for them to acquire land?
Sakuran: Cannibalise land from relevant threads
/nasa/: Work with the land we have, territories may have to cede land
/who/: Find generals that are willing to cede territory

/inf/: Choose a general location based on relations
/meat/: Remove threads that have not been around for a long time (not in-game, but on the board itself), cut down land size if necessary
/nasfaqg/: New threads will likely replace old threads that have faded out from the board. If necessary, add islands near tectonics or take land from inactive generals
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: Multiple suggestions, generally converge on taking land from relevant neighbouring threads that are inactive in-game.

/meat/: Nothing, or something but unknown
/nasfaqg/: Polar ocean
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: Multiple proposals, converges on an ocean and a land mass. To be discussed further down. TBD

Regarding the Rushia situation:
>Multiple lore proposals have been made in this thread, following a brief explanation of what transpired during the incident from a fandead, however nothing concrete was decided upon to be anchored. Ideally, we would get an in-universe lorepost from a/the Rushia representative. I see that may be difficult, so reply to this question with your own lore, either by writing one now or linking a previous post.
Sakuran: Proposes >>20274625, also adds that people who abandon the hobby=dead, changed oshi=immigrants, waiting for revival/conclusion=refugees.
/nasa/: No proposal (Abstain)
/who/: No proposal (Abstain)
/wg/: Follows >>20274625, adds that no bodies were found by search parties.
Hoshiyomia: Wasteland with undead, endless storms, skywards purple spiral from the royal palace, capital radioactive
/inf/: Suggests >>20274692, >>20272390
/meat/: Suggest >>20274625, also can weld multiple proposals together
/nasfaqg/: A wasteland that fandead are abandoning due to a disaster
/rrat/: Abstain, suggests this should be the fandead’s responsibility
Summary: Multiple suggestions, converges on currently being a wasteland. Details TBD

>Similarly, for chuubas that graduate, or vt-related threads not tied to any specific chuuba fading away, should a set way to erase them from the map be decided upon or should it be investigated on a case-by-case basis?
Sakuran: Case-by-case
/nasa/: Should depend on whether the chuuba got terminated, including channel suspensions
/who/: Depends on the situation
/wg/: Case-by-case
Hoshiyomia: Investigated case by case
/inf/: Case by case
/meat/: Case-by-case basis
/nasfaqg/: Case-by-case basis
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: General preference on investigating each situation on a case-by-case basis.

>Regarding Jannies and the smiting that may or may not be incorporated into Rushia lore; what are they in regards to our world/pantheon, and what effects and powers do they have? Specifically, assuming their existence is acknowledged, what can be said for eg /meat/, that gets deleted on a regular basis?
Sakuran: Metaphysical cleaners of our dimension that stop chuubanite destabilisations and hate /meat/.
/nasa/: Jannies weight 300lbs, eat hot pockets and work for free. Can discuss the /meat/ matter if they get permabanned
/who/: Jannies are fat and unreasonable. /meat/ matter will become an issue if they get permakilled
/wg/: Forces of nature, such as natural disasters, huge storms, chuubanite instabilities etc, but not personified
Hoshiyomia: Archangels, untouchable and invisible to people, work from the shadows if something needs to be put under control
/inf/: Celestial and/or primordial beings, incomprehensible to us but working to maintain a status quo. Views differ from culture to culture.
/meat/: Powerful, but not divine, intelligent and somewhat predictable entities who are unwilling/unable to communicate with mortals. Actions can be erratic. Perhaps unkillable, but not unstoppable nor truly divine. Suggests dragons, ringwraiths or other mythical beasts as examples.
/nasfaqg/: Spiritual entities, can possibly hide between mortals. /meat/ matter is not an issue unless they get permabanned.
/rrat/: No suggestion (Abstain)
Summary: Multiple suggestions, generally converge on jannies having mythical powers. To be discussed further below. TBD

Regarding Chuubanite:
>Is Chuubanite the final name we want the material to have? Y/N
Sakuran: Vitubium, with element symbol Vt
/nasa/: Chuubanite is the name of the ore, the refined material is Vitubium
/who/: Y
/wg/: Y, seconds /nasa/’s proposal
Hoshiyomia: Y, with Vt the element symbol
/inf/: Vitubium
/meat/: Thirds /nasa/’s proposal
/nasfaqg/: Chuubanite is one mineral form of the element Vitubium (Vt)
/rrat/: Vitium/Vitubium
Summary: Chuubanite and Vitubium are the main suggestions. The question referred to the material, that is, the refined version of the mineral. With that in mind, Vitubium with symbol Vt is the element, and Chuubanite is the/one mineral form of the element in nature.

>Is it radioactive? Y/N
Sakuran: N. Not conventionally, affects the psyche in the effect of madness in high doses and psychedelics in lower doses.
/nasa/: N. Depends on what it bonds with; if the bonding partner is radioactive then yes
/who/: Undecided
/wg/: N
Hoshiyomia: Y
/inf/: Differs on the user’s lore (will count as Abstain)
/meat/: N. It does decay naturally, but does not affect the body nor does it cause chain reactions, with exceptions arising from source beyond mortal control.
/nasfaqg/: N. Not in the traditional sense, emits magical radiation.
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: 1Y, 5N, 3U/A. Passes by majority that Vitubium is not radioactive by itself in the conventional sense. Suggestions that it does decay but causes psychological effects to humans TBD.

>Does it differ from nation to nation, meaning it absorbs some of the qualities of the thread ruling over the area it is in, or is it a simple element which is used differently by separate nations depending on their lore?
Sakuran: Has slightly different properties according to a nation’s deity’s affinity
/nasa/: Each nation has its own kind, but all can be refined to pure Vitubium somehow.
/who/: Undecided
/wg/: Differs, but should gain some of its power from mortal worship.
Hoshiyomia: Simply an element with set properties 
/inf/: Differs
/meat/: Differs, absorbs qualities from the deities that are associated with that particular type of Chuubanite is associated with.
/nasfaqg/: Chuuba-alligned deposits; while the element Vitubium is the same everywhere, deposits differ in every nation, gaining their powers from their respective chuubas.
/rrat/: Differs per nation, but can also differ due to refinement and device that is used in. Dead zones where it stops working can also exist.
Summary: 7 for Differs, 1 for No difference, 1 U. By vast majority it is decided that Chuubanite differs from nation to nation, absorbing some power from the local deities in some way. Exact variations TBD

>If the answer to the above is the former, what happens when the land the Chuubanite is on changes owner?
Sakuran: The Chuubanite senses the change and adapts to the different properties related to the new owners
/nasa/: Depends on the lore of the thread’s general (that is losing the land). (counted as Abstain)
/who/: The techniques (of use/refinement) are changed, presumably lost or replaced
/wg/: Changes properties according to the new worshipped deities
Hoshiyomia: n/a
/inf/: New owners of the land get access to that specific type of Chuubanite until it is exhausted.
/meat/: Qualities stay even if the Chuubanite changes owners, either due to occupation or shipping, but rate of decay may increase where faith to its associated deities is uncommon/non-existent.
/nasfaqg/: The deposits lose a lot of their qualities when the land changes owner.
/rrat/: No vote (Abstain)
Summary: 2 for Qualities change accordingly, 2 for Qualities are lost when owner changes, 2 for Qualities remain until exhausted/decayed, 2A, 1n/a. No real convergence, needs to be discussed further. TBD

>Is Chuubanite only found in the ground initially, then spread around by plants/humans/bacteria/planetary natural processes, or does everything inherently have Chuubanite in them, like mana?
Sakuran: The former, but at this point small amounts of it have spread everywhere
/nasa/: Not midichlorians, ie not like mana. Further research required to determine its nature.
/who/: Chuubanite is rocks
/wg/: Not a midichlorian microbe, it is a physical resource.
Hoshiyomia: Found in rocks and caves, glows
/inf/: Started in the ground and spread out. Also suggest that is a rechargeable source that gains power when the related deities stream
/meat/: The former, but in practice everything will have a small amount of Chuubanite in them as part of their natural processes
/nasfaqg/: Rock for the mineral, few lifeforms can utilise the element itself when it leaks out
/rrat/: No suggestion (Abstain)
Summary: Multiple suggestions, converge on Chuubanite being a mineral that originates from the ground and has spread around the globe.

Not concluded:
To be discussed and voted on in Round 2:

Regarding thread management:

>Do we want a rep to be responsible for making posts like this one, where matters are voted on? Y/N
Summary: 3Y, 3N, 3U/A. Three-way tie, we either tiebreak or the vote does not pass. 
Needs to be voted on. I asked for feedback for exactly this situation in >>20409001, but no one responded. 
The question to be voted on remains the same, but I am open to suggestions.

>As a matter of fact, what should the name of the planet be?
Summary: Multiple proposals but no convergence. Will require further examination. TBD
Current proposals include: Eavth, Planet - /vt/, Chubaearth, Vitalia, Vitria, Veetee, /vt/. 
I personally believe this needs to be voted on for us to have some sort of consistency, though opinions differ.
Changing the question to “Should there be a unified name for the planet across all nations? Y/N”

>Should /fbk/'s and /mion/'s locations be swapped? Y/N
Summary: 3Y, 6A. Vote does not pass. It seems most voters were not aware of the situation to vote.
This was a Sakuran proposal. I did think of including the details of the proposal in the question itself but I opted out of it in the end. I see now that was a mistake.
Therefore, this prompt will be revoted on. This time, I will be attaching the explanation Sakuran gave in their voting post: 
“I have explained this before, but FBK interacts with the Stars in some degree, while Mio does not. This doesn't necessarily mean the threads themselves reflect this, but it would definitely make more sense if they were swapped. Additionally, FBK is an arctic fox, so being further north than Mio, who is I think a wolf in alpine forests, would make sense.
If the change were to be made, I would also suggest changing the size of the borders a bit, as /fbk/ is also represented in /bakatare/ and would get a bigger piece of land, while /mion/'s land would become smaller in the swap. /fbk/'s new land would be frozen however, so that should be accounted for.”

>Should /OKFAMS/ be also added on the map, perhaps around the area of /duck/, /mogu+/doog/, /fbk/, /mion/? 
Y/N
Summary: 4Y, 2N, 3A. Results indecisive. 
This is another Sakuran proposal. Depending on the conditional Abstains, this would pass. However, looking at Sakuran’s answer on the next question regarding /israel/ and /aa/, I would like to retract this proposal and put it on hold until the end of the month, when we can check again if they are stable enough to be included or they should just be an alliance of the area. 

>Should /israel/ and [insert another new thread I forgot the name of] be added on the map? Y/N
Summary: 4Y, 3N, 2A for /aa/, 3Y, 3N, 3A for /israel/. Results indecisive, no clear majority. 
Results could go either way depending on the Abstains. I propose that this, too, is put on hold until the end of the month to check again. Alternatively, /aa/ would get a nation but /israel/ would not. 

>What should happen at the poles?
Summary: Multiple proposals, converges on an ocean and a land mass. 
It seems at least one ocean and at least one land mass would be preferred, however with the recent discussion regarding straits in the thread I am unsure whether this still holds true. I suggest we wait for >>20440107 to give a full analysis of the options and then open it to a vote again.

Regarding the Rushia situation:

>Regarding Jannies and the smiting that may or may not be incorporated into Rushia lore; what are they in 
regards to our world/pantheon, and what effects and powers do they have? Specifically, assuming their existence 
is acknowledged, what can be said for eg /meat/, that gets deleted on a regular basis?
Summary: Multiple suggestions, generally converge on jannies having mythical powers. 
Apart from Jannies being some sort of mythical beings, no real conclusion was reached here. I do believe it would be for the best if we could decide on some parameters for them ie do they live on the planet, in the same dimension, are they killable etc. Alternatively, we could reduce this into a simple discussion matter, and suggest lore for them when necessary, that will then be read and criticized by other anons. Special mention to >>20306260 because it made me laff.

>If the answer to the above is the former, what happens when the land the Chuubanite is on changes owner?
Summary: 2 for Qualities change accordingly, 2 for Qualities are lost when owner changes, 2 for Qualities remain 
until exhausted/decayed, 2A, 1n/a. No real convergence, needs to be discussed further. 
The results are a bit unclear on this one. The two votes that simply claim that the qualities are lost with land change could potentially be included in the first option, where the Chuubanite changes qualities. Since that was not explicitly said however, I did not add them together. Even in that case, due to the Abstains the results would still be unclear. Therefore, I suggest that this is revoted on.
