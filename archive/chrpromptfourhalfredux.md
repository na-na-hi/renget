>Who would win in a fight between Nick and Amelia? The fight takes place in an open field with no obsticles.
Depends on how quickly Amelia can close the distance, I think. In an open field, I think 5/6 times she'd be able to get close enough to get an advantage before being overwhelmed. Nick is also relatively squishy (wizard archetype) in comparison, and Amelia is much better at one-on-one fights than group.

>Maxi is probably a good janitor for the guild, what about Maddie? She's so small! But is she helpful?
Maddi's pretty useful, she mostly takes care of the smaller details of messes.

>Paraphrase "Beast said to the cooking pokemon question : He refuses to cook pokemon"

>What was Elm's job, as a human?
[No answer]

>What does Lliam think about bananas?
They're just food, whatever.

>Linoone, how many people have you run into?
So many people. Probably almost every named character at this point. Crashed into beast at one time, who was transporting groceries and got really mad (which is why he's scared of Beast).
Someone at least once every day when delivering mail.

>Are there any other characters who share Cyndaquil's excentricities?
(Phanphy) There's a treeko with a foot fetish from my first story who is a kindrid spirit. 
(Linoone) Toge's blurb mentions that he has to stop himself from talking about hentai with Cyndaquil.
(Phanphy) [Paraphrase] Only one interaction with Toge and Cynda, but haven't writen that yet.
(Toge) I really need to rewrite that intro

>Linoone, any acceptable CBT?
No part of CBT is acceptable. Except *maybe* cognitive behavorial therepy.
Rumors that Linoone likes CBT are just that, spread by someone unknown.

>Does Asana have an eyepatch? and if so, what does it look like?
She doesn't have one.
>So, kind of like guts? She lost an eye but keeps it shut instead of getting a patch?
I guess, yeah.

>Does Clara smoke weed?
No, but she would.

>[Paraphrase] How much can Smith lift?
"400 gajillion tons" (but for real I feel like you would have to do some math for an answer to that)
the heaviest thing he has lifted was a chunk of earth, roughly his own size, that he ripped from the ground
so, however much that is

>Is Clara able to have some private time or is Smoke always around?
Altough he can leave somewhere else, they both always know what the other is doing, like proprioception.
so no, she can't have "alone time"

>If someone grabbed Kiyo's tails, would they get a curse, or is it just kil?
kiyo would curse people for pulling his tails if he could but i dont think he's wise enough to access ninetales type powers yet
but you WILL get batted at :)
(Booker) now i'm imagining kiyo rearing up and waving his little paws around, trying to figure out how to curse someone who pulled his tail
(Kiyo) lmao maybe once he learns about curses, but a human slips him cursed reference... "AVADA KEDABRA!  WHY THE FUCK ARENT YOU DEAD!!! CURSE-YE-HAME-HA"

>Has totodile attempted making his own alcohol yet?
not yet, he drinks on the guild's tab

>Would clara ride a go kart even if it was so small her knees stuck out?
No, unless she was alone or there was a big prize?

>Is there something from the human world Amelia is interested in that she pesters Nick about?
She would first be interested in if humans have anything comparable to mystery dungeons and exploration teams. (No, not really.) And then possibly in the fact that humans harness electricity to power so many different devices and tools. It would be more of a minor curiosity though, I think.

>does linoone curl up when he sleeps?  or flat on his back or somethin???
curls up usually, but if it was a very busy day delivering lots of mail, he just lays down K.Od in bed on his back!
(Kiyo) i bet a curled up linoone would be kinda like a donut shaped beanbag. very comfy ouo

>does maxi actually smell like garbage?  or is it more of just a look?
He probably hasn't bathed since he got to the PMD world so he probably smells really bad
>Maddi too?
Nah, Maddi actually showers

>It was never mentioned, but does Chespin dislike Pelipper?
As of now he doesn't ACTUALLY have a hatred of them. But all it'd take is one dinged or busted package from them to piss him off enough.
like if he got a special Gummi drink shopped to him and it arrived busted "that stupid fucking WINGER broke my drink!"
(Linoone) soon... When he will realise pelipper mail desn't ever deliver his mail on time...

>Does phanpy like tea?
He prefers coffee but hasn't found any in capim town so he drinks tea now
