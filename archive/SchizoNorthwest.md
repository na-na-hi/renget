### Introduction

Above a section of Vitubia containing verdant plains and sullen mountains, the unchanging winds blow as steadily as ever. But while its flowing breezes may remain constant, the world that meets it head on has shifted, shuffled and turned upside down and back.

In the far north, blasts of bitter-cold air throw themselves upon covered beings; men which wander among giants stagger and screech of places, people, and experiences from a degraded time beyond common memory, barely comprehensible to those who live long enough to hear them.

Further south the wind goes. Gradually, the conditions become more humane. After passing an area rumored to be the home of a 'miracle people', it rushes through and interweaves with branches and leaves, held up by thick trees.

One tree moves. Something that shouldn't be in his forest is running into it: a screeching and sobbing person that cannot be called from his looks as exactly human. Clouded in thoughts but his intent clear, it impales the intruder clean through his chest with one of its mighty branches. As he emits a final, terminal screech, his friend flees.

The tree stops, leaving the body to fester upon the scarred and newly red-stained branch. Was there a custom to disposing of it? Did he need to tell of this invasion of territory? The tree consulted itself for answers, but could not find any; for the only reply was monotone static and dark feelings, punctuated with short and hollow imitations - dim sounds, twisted visuals and garbled actions - of the world which it lives in, but no longer could experience. Giving up, the tree opted to leave the body on the branch. Surely, it will remember soon what to do with it.

Absconding from a forest of death, the remaining non-human, a biological product of his invading progenitors, returned to his village of residence. Shaken by it all, he vows to never wander far from his home again - someone else would take his job as a merchant. Soon enough, a young man, barely of an age appropriate for it, replaced him. Unknowing of the world beyond the confines of his village, he is given supplies, wares, even a tantalizing bit of gold, and set off down a westerly road which was rough and beaten.

Though his route is perilous and winding, he soon finds himself descending altitude. Eventually, he reaches his destination: a "border-village", as his elders called it. Beyond it, the road was watched by armed and trained soldiers, intent on letting no one pass - at least, that was the surface view of them. Regardless of this, he set up his stall and began bartering. The armed soldiers only watched.

Another man came to the border village. A second, older trader. With shock, the young man watched as he fearlessly approached the troopers and handed them gold. Like a set of curtains, they parted before him, and so the older man went on.

The wiser merchant, now past the checkpoint, traveled inland. His endpoint was a special one: the city known to its inhabitants only as the Capital. It was big, beautiful by his own standards, and slowly crumbling. It was the citadel of a once grand Republic of which its third iteration now claims to inherit. Although it clings onto its illustrious legacy, it can never reach the heights its podium once stood at. Arguably, it has even regressed. The merchant recalls the proverb that is passed around the more cynical people of the city: the Third Owl Republic is decaying with the corpse of its founder.

His goods, like many others, ultimately find themselves at a port on the coast. Dockworkers load them onto cargo ships which travel south, into a port that one could swear once handled a lot more ships long ago.

A grizzled customs worker carves the seal of a star onto the wooden crates containing them, and soon they are distributed even farther by traders: they go to the kingdoms of its east, to the various "corpos" and local governments of its south, and further beyond, to the polities emerging from an ancient wasteland, to the local governments and "corpos" of the southeast, to kingdoms and tribes barely known by a name stretching from the plains to the mountains to the cold, cold tundra where demi-men roam with giants.

This region is uniquely colored by war - both inter-species and intra-species - and shaped by the peace which follows them. Like a grand cycle, life here goes on and breaks down. It is an unending epilogue to the chronicles of events occurring centuries ago - an invasion unlike any other and the resulting (or perhaps only assisting?) collapse of human domination.

This region is the Schizo Northwest.

### Overview

Everyone treats their end differently.

Some choose to stay defiant in the face of it. They elect to struggle against inevitability, either desperately or pridefully, unwilling to lie down and accept their unyielding fate. Others may capitulate, seeing no point in resistance to something that always arrives to take them. Still others are fearful of the unknown which rides along with the end, their final moments being one of agony, of confusion or fright or terror. There are only two constants which apply to the end. First: all shall have to turn to it at one point or another. Second: every end comes packaged with a new beginning.

So too is the case with Vitubia. The history of the northwestern portion of the Holocontinent, though somewhat lost to time, is one filled with these ends and its peoples' reactions to them. It is important to remember, however, that history has so far not yet ended. Like the belief of Reincarnation of certain schizo religions practiced in the Shtregi Mountains, the actions of the past, of those who faced their end, influenced both the present and the future.

No scholar of the past will contest that the history of the northwestern Holocontinent is one filled with the conflagration of conflict. Moreso than others, this area has come to be not from the tip of the pen, but from the tip of the sword. Great nations and peoples of the times before were founded from it, defended with it, and fell to it. Such is the cycle of life and death.

Perhaps the greatest war of them all took place in a momentous time. As the world itself faded and fell apart, hostile invaders flooded the gates of countries already on the brink. Coming from the cold wastelands amd rising up in humanity's midst, these familiar marauders - the mentally broken and newly empowered *schizos* - wasted no time in causing chaos and destruction wherever they went. It was well and truly the times of the end. In this period of great crisis, it is where the responses to the end mattered most. Some kept fighting to the brutal finish. Others buckled immediately. All, however, eventually lost to the forces of insanity - and thus, the stage for the future was set.

Six hundred years have passed, but the curtains have not yet closed. Far from it. Tribes, roaming descendants of both conquerers and conquerees, dot the open expanses and tall mountain peaks. Vast swathes of land remain out of reach from the concept of a nation-state. Villages new and old remain mostly solitary, barring a traveling merchant or two, belonging to no one but themselves. Like everywhere else, everything here has regressed.

The closest resemblance to the past lies within the ancient nations and cities of the western coast. Here, civilization endures. Traders trod on beaten roads from village to village, taxmen demand tribute and organized armies camp and patrol the grounds of their nation. Some even dare to live as if nothing had ever changed.

Travel past the barrier of protection that a border provides however, and things become very, very different. Those who wander into the unknown usually do so armed. Many areas aren't dangerous, per se, but in a soil with undiluted freedom coursing through its veins, anything can happen. Better to be prepared than to be potentially dead.

To the north, squabblers duke it out over relics from gods. To the very south, the spirit of the Sakura stands guard. And to the east, a race reviled by many sit in a state of weary peace - for their ancestors had shed blood to seize the world for themselves, and their ancestors' offspring had their blood shed to keep it. But how did this race get there? Both their own legends and humans' memory of history tell that long ago, they begun a great invasion...

## The Great Invasion

The trouble began long ago. It was a calamity - at least the ancient legends claimed it as such. The crops had dried, the poor were starved; the air had chilled as the sun caught afire at the horizon. Nothing like it had been seen before or since; the acts of the world were beyond explanation. Extraordinary times like these lead to extraordinary events. That would be the chain of logic, at least, that could explain *their* expansion.

### Not Quite Men

Feral savages. Unreasonable monsters. Perturbed creatures of the damned. Some may call them by only slightly nicer names, some of which live on to this day. *Lightcrushers. Maziz. Spletnokii. Inhumans.* There is only one race on Vitubia which has obtained these dubious honors: the Vitubian *schizos* of yore and their offspring.

In appearance, most are somewhat similar to human beings; usually they tend to be lankier and have thinner skin, with much smaller amounts of hair on the head and none to be found on the body. Their nails too are sharper than human nails - almost like claws - and usually act as a last-ditch weapon when a schizo has no other on hand. Despite the thin frame, their bones carry with them a strength even greater than that of a man's; their average running speed is a little higher than the human average as well.

The schizo has been a persistent foe. Even before the world's radical transformation, they were noted in fragmentary writings dated from the era as having been an enemy of old nations. How threatening they were at that time is unclear. Upon the start of the calamities of the past, however, it was as if a switch were flicked within them. As if inhibitions were unshackled and the uncertainty and insanity of the times had been channeled into their very essence. Soon, they would let out a primal, aggressive rage that would make the land itself quake and shudder in fear.

### Enemy at the Gates

The assault of the rampaging schizos was one to be fought in the interior just as much as on the borders of all the civilized territories of the world. As great armies and hordes assembled in the northern wastes, entire towns began to fall to madness and despair. Bands of schizos and human marauders terrorized and plagued the citizenry, necessitating considerable diversions of resources - already reduced as a result of the massive crisis in the world in general - from the front line to deal with the threat.

Soon enough, the informal crusade of the schizos began. The shields of human warriors stemmed their tide at the beginning, but the conditions were not in humanity's favor. Many areas were quickly overwhelmed, expanding the conflict's number of fronts and exposing more and more populated areas to the horrors of the invading army.

Very few governments could hold on for long against these odds, and none would last forever in the face of countless schizos pouring into the fields. Despite this, the few surviving histories of the time noted with a tone of near-reverance that one nation demonstrated its resilience and held its ground until the bitter end: the Owl Republic. Adept and experienced in the arts of war, the Owl Republic - now called the First Owl Republic - fought on for many years against their unnatural foes. How many is disputed by different sources and legends: some say it lived for five years before its defeat, while others say it held the line for twenty five years. The true answer may remain unknown for two hundred and fifty more years.

The common myth which the heirs to the First Owl Republic gladly extol from birth to death is that they alone were the only ones who put their all into fighting the schizos. Was this true? It is difficult to say. Other people of the current-day Schizo Northwest would tend to disagree. But then again, nobody wants to claim they came from a nation of losers and cowards.

### A Villain's Welcome

However long the First Owl Republic and its fellow states lasted, it was an inevitability that it would all come to an end. And so it did. At some point, the Republic's capital - the City of Victory - was sacked by the schizo forces and set to the torch. It was an event, immortalized in paintings for centuries to come, which would never truly be forgotten even as decades of knowledge and progress were in the flames of the burning libraries and schools. Today, it is disputed on racial lines who actually set off the fire. It is undisputable, however, that with the loss of the capital came the death knell of the First Owl Republic.

It might have been possible that scattered elements of the Republic's army and citizenry fought on after the Capital's sacking, but the general opinion is that the first war between humankind and schizokind ended then and there. There were no peace treaties nor ceasefires. Any surrender was unconditional, subject to the whims of the crazed victorious schizos.

Although humanity in the Schizo Northwest feared for their survival, many of their worries were thankfully somewhat overblown. It had been years since the world's end had burst-charged the schizos' power; by this point, this said power was already fading. Their infamous madness had begun to subside - though they would obviously never be very "sane" by any human standard, the schizos, lacking purpose and energy, began to regress and relax. They had won their great crusade. Now what?

The exact fate of the conquered human lands was not uniform across it. The schizos had no centralized government, no unifying leader - the closest thing to that being numerous generals of different schizo armies. Having no plans to truly build a schizo nation of their own, the land was instead first-come first-serve to whoever wanted a piece of it. Many personal fiefdoms and minor kingdoms were established, led by schizos who could do what they wished with their new gains with near-impunity. Some humans therefore were treated with brutality and viciousness; others were left to essentially govern for themselves as long as they paid a monthly tribute.

The schizos themselves soon settled down into their own communities, rarely mixing with human ones. And for more or less three hundred years... everything was finally - yet extremely reluctantly - at peace.
