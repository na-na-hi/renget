Collars by anonymous

>Be me
>Live with a dog anthro
>We're watching some movie last Friday and I don't even remember why or how but we started talking about collars
>He gets really riled and angry and starts going on and on about how collars are "hate symbols" and "human devices of mockery and conquest" and that any anthro that would wear one is a "species traitor"
>Tell him to chill out because he's basically yelling at the end and he storms out
Didn't know collars were such a, uh, hot topic

>You go to his room to apologize to him, but he’s still too caught up in his ranting to forgive you.
>You ask him what you can do for him to forgive you.
>He huffs and pulls out a leash and collar from his desk drawer.
>”You’re gonna have to wear this”
>…
>The next thing you know your being tugged by the neck towards his bed.
>He circles around you examining your body with a questionable face.
>”something’s missing”
>You groan and sarcastically suggest that maybe you aren’t “conquered” enough.
>To your surprise he actually lights up and orders you to take off your shirt.
>Your curious as to why and are a bit reluctant, but it was part of the deal to “obey” him.
>Handing your shirt over to him, he slips behind you and holds both your wrists to your back.
>Using your shirt, he quickly and tightly ties your wrists together.
>You comment on his expertise in tying knots but in the middle of your sentence you were kicked from behind the knee sending you kneeling on the floor.
>You look up to see the dog sitting on the edge of the bed stripped to just his fur, a red tipped sheath, leash in hand, and a devious smile.
>”Now be a good boy and suck” he orders.
>”wait a minute, why do you have a leash in the first place?” You question but are quickly tugged to his crotch.

>You’re now mere centimeters away from his growing member, instantly getting a whiff of his musk.
>You dart your eyes up to your dog friend wearing a shit-eating grin.
>”hehe, you look so cute in a collar. Now be a good dog and start licking.”
>it’s taking every part of you to not bite his dick off, but remembering why you’re doing this in the first place is the biggest factor.
>”Just get this over with so he’s not so mad at you” you say to yourself.
>You sink down between his sheath and thigh, inhaling his musk and feeling the heat from his member on your cheek.
>Turning your head, you stick your tongue out and drag it along the side of his dick from the bottom all the way to the top.
>You repeat this a few times on both sides adding a few kisses and making his cock twitch before you notice his grip on the leash loosen.
>You look up to see him with eyes half lidded, panting with his tongue hanging out.
>You’re sorta embarrassed yourself with how long you busied yourself with his cock before you noticed how relaxed he got.
>You can’t deny how much you like the look on his face… You also can’t deny how much your enjoying this either despite being somewhat reluctant to this.
>Continuing your service, you lap your tongue underneath his tip, earning a few concealed “Arfs!” from your buddy who seems way to alleviated considering how you are quite literally under his control.
>His member keeps on twitching more and more while leaking pre.
>You figure it’s time for you to stop teasing and start getting into the main event.
>You slowly and smoothly engulf his dick inch by inch making the dog softly moan.
>Just before your about to rise up and off his cock he immediately tugs at the leash, sending you straight back down till your mouth touches his knot.
>You grunt and roll your eyes to the surprise but ultimately continue with your strokes. It’s not like you could stop anyway since he kept tugging at your.
