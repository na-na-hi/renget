!!!note -> 🪶  **M.E.S. (Mumei (is) Everywhere System)**  🪶 <-
    This is a list of collabs, complementary POVs and cameos done by Mumei available in the other Holomems channels - this is jokingly known on /who/ as M.E.S. or Mumei (is) Everywhere System. This will also include the 'Easter Eggs' like drawing streams. Any brief mentions on streams without any particular footage or any appearance in a holomem chatroom from Mumei won't be counted and won't be featured in the list - there will be simply too many of them, the only exceptions are breakdowns and aftermaths of previous streams that Mumei took part of. Any missing collab or cameo or any suggestions are also welcome, just let it be known in the thread as an answer to the anchor post (second OP).
	
	For clarity purposes, we'll say that this is currently Year 2, which started on August 23rd 2022 - the day after the Council 1 Year Anniversary stream. Year 2 will eventually end either after HoloCouncil's 2nd Anniversary or Mumei's own 2nd Anniversary.
