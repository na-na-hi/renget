#A Sweet Chocolate February

###Chapter I
She reached to turn off the light when her eyes landed on the makeshift sticky note collage she had constructed earlier in pathetic hope of self-motivation. Its bright colors and chipper messages now seemed like a personal attack. Before she could stop herself, she was on her feet, tearing the notes down in ragged strips and letting them fall in heaps around herself. Breathing hard, Hoge sank down among the pile of paper shards. Why did she come back here? What was wrong with her? She drew her knees tight to her chest, head bowed as muffled sobs shook her frame.

A faint squeak sounded nearby. Probably just the old building settling, or mice in the walls. Then it came again, more insistent. She raised her head, blinking through tears. A small green shape perched on the sill of the third floor window which she knew had been locked when she left. Gigan. But if he was here, then…

Three quick taps rapped against the glass pane. She lurched upright, pulse skittering. Was she hallucinating? Imagining what she wanted to see? She hastily scrubbed the tears from her face as a familiar voice called out softly.

"Hoge? Can you let me in?"

She rushed over and unlatched the window with quivering hands. It slid open and Inigo slipped through the gap with ease, straightening up before her. Wordlessly he stepped forward, wrapping both arms fiercely around her midsection and pressing close, anchor-like. His steady heartbeat reverberated against her ear where it lay upon his chest. Solid. Real. Inigo was here.

One hand gently stroked her hair. She sensed him surveying the room, taking in the torn sticky note pieces scattered like confetti. He didn't speak, simply held her in silence. The quiet acceptance undid her. A fresh wave of sobs wracked her frame.


"Rough night?" he asked simply.

She could only nod, not trusting her voice yet. Inigo's arms tightened around her.

“Sorry, I’m a little late..”

“Where you were able to find-” her voice trailed off, the wounds and bruises on his body were fresh. Gigan was cracked and would need time to recover.

“No. Not yet. But I'm here now," he said. "We'll get through this together."

"Will you stay?" she whispered.

Inigo kissed her forehead. "Of course. As long as you need."

###Chapter II

It’s been a week now since he’s been back. No one really noticed his absence except Hoge. Their connection was too strong. It was a tether that anchored him here. A tether that if he was ever forced to remove would undo him. 

Despite the sadness they had endured in the last few months, Class 1-D was the same. Strong, growing, and dependable like a great oak, and Inigo had settled back into his old routine. Today was Valentine’s day. And he quickly pushed away the thoughts of villains, the protestors outside, syndicates, and traitors in the very back of his head. Today they were kids. Nothing more. He turned to Gigan on his shoulder, who gave him an encouraging mew. Inigo put on his trademark grin.

*Plus he had Hoge’s chocolates to look forward to.*

The hallway at Shiketsu High School buzzed with activity as students hurried to their next classes. But three boys in particular sauntered through the crowds with an air of casual confidence - Hifumi, Inigo, and Bobby, three of the most popular first-years.

As they walked, Hifumi was passionately recounting details from a movie they had recently seen together. "Bro! It was Helena who said 'the dial only leads here.' And then Indy goes, 'He designed it to bring help.' That means Archimedes never used the dial for time travel! He designed it so Indy and Helena would come aid the Carthaginians against the invading Romans."

Inigo shook his head dubiously. "Yeah that just seems weak, my guy. In real life, the Carthaginians lose. And the Romans murder Archimedes. The war only lasts a year. So in that time, Archimedes somehow frantically completed the dial? So Indy would come and scare the Romans with a 'dragon'? A dragon who didn't even do anything besides intrigue people. One of the two sides shot the dragon down with harpoons!"

Bobby, casually balancing a basketball on one finger, weighed in. "Nah bro, I think Archimedes conceived of the Dial as part of his inventions to help turn the tide during the Second Punic War. Like you said, it was meant to be a 'time beacon' which would help bring reinforcements from the future. When Archimedes met Indy, the Dial already served its purpose, but he still had to build it so that Indy could fulfill his destiny. He probably realized by then that the Dial won't save Syracuse, and that it exists only to facilitate the meeting and close the time loop."

The three boys nodded sagely, satisfied with their movie analysis. Just then, their classmate Mahoko sidled up to join the conversation. "It was awesome! Harold Ford looked great for his age, huh?"

The three boys blinked in confusion before Inigo answered diplomatically, "Yeah..."

Sensing the awkwardness, Mahoko quickly changed topics. "So did you guys also watch movies with Owari?"

Immediately the three boys tensed up. "Whoa!" Inigo exclaimed. "Touchy subject," Bobby said, shaking his head.

"Rule #12, new guy. We try not to talk about him," Hifumi explained.

"Oh right, my bad fellas," Mahoko said cheerfully, unfazed by their reaction.

As they neared the lockers, Hifumi suddenly stopped. "Something's not right..." The other two boys sensed it too. The chatter around them had grown hushed, and they felt eyes on them.

"Remember the days before summer?" Inigo whispered gravely.

Bobby gulped. "Or just before the bonfire dance..."

Exchanging determined nods, the three boys steeled themselves in front of their lockers.

"Just remember to dodge! Now or never, bros!" Hifumi yelled.

They flung open their lockers, and a deluge of chocolates, gifts and confession letters cascaded out. Dodging frantically, they managed to gather everything into sacks.

"What do we do with all this chocolate?"

Panting, Inigo turned to see a mob of single students protesting outside the principal's office.

With a grin, he said, "I got an idea."

The three boys gleefully dumped their gift sacks over the protesters, who cried out in dismay under the sudden onslaught of chocolate and affection.

Laughing and high-fiving each other, Hifumi, Inigo and Bobby sauntered off to class, leaving chaos in their wake.

***
As Rosethorn allowed the class to hand out chocolates, Inigo watched Hoge from his desk with a big smile. He couldn’t see her at all. Was she really so nervous? But it was more of a general vague sense of where his beloved was. One by one, he watched a small rectangular chocolate bar with a Maru(maru) sticker appear on each his classmate’s top-right desk corner, that is until she got to his desk. A huge grin was plastered on his face. Here it comes. Would he get ten bars? Maybe one of those cute heart shaped boxes. Should he give some sort of thank you speech?

 *Plop* A single bar appeared on his desk. Just like what everyone else got. It fell to the ground and then something nervously picked it up and plopped it again. Hiro’s empty desk is nudged away haphazardly as Hoge kept moving. Inigo turned to look towards her desk. A second bar would’ve been enough. It’s not like he was greedy, right? Gigan patted his back.

***
As soon as homeroom ended, Inigo made a hurried break for Hoge’s desk, accidentally knocking Sora into Shinkan’s awaiting arms. 

“Hey!” Inigo smirked. “What’s the hurry!”

She stopped moving and he heard Hoge whisper some numbers before her outline unblurred. “ Yes, Ini?”

“You’re not mad at me, right?” Inigo teased. “Cause I did get you flowers - I’m saving them for later!”

“It’s not like that. It’s been a busy day. I have to visit Rosethorn-sensei before the next class,” She said tiredly.

“Are you upset cause I tried to get more of your chocolate?”

“You mean when you tried to buy people’s chocolates, and then when they asked for a reason, you shouted “true love”, she teased, half-amused.

“Yes! Cuz it is true love! And it worked- I have half your chocolates right here!” He grinned.

“Ini..”

“Y’know you could’ve at least given me two bars.”

“I only bought exactly enough for the class. No extras.”

“Right, but you’re usually pretty prepared. You plan this stuff out way in advanced,” He smirked and stepped closer, leaning in. “Then why do you look so tired, Coru-chan? My doki doki investigation senses are tingling.”

“You have to be content with that. Be patient. I don’t know what to do- okay?”

“Huh? Don’t get upset.”

“I’m not upset.”

“That’s fine! How bout’ I make you chocolate instead?”

“No! I want to do it right. This is all new for me too.”

“You have an extra piece cuz Hiro’s not around, right? Can I have it?” Inigo said eagerly.

“Ini.. you’re being too greedy…”

“But-!”

“I have to go to sensei’s office now,” she cut him off and walked off.

“We’re still on for a Valentine’s date later, right?!” He shouted loud enough for people in the hallway to hear.

“Uwaaa!” Hoge turned red and ran, notebook clutched to her chest.

Inigo sighed. Did he say something wrong? He looked at a passing Christopher.

“Man, love is tricky.”

“What happenedr?” the dark-haired boy said.

“I dunno, man. Hey bro! You wanna trade-”

“Just take it,” Christopher handed him Hoge’s candy bar.

“Sweet!”


###Chapter III
***

Hoge knocked lightly on the falculty office door before peeking her head inside. "Sensei, you wanted to see me?"

Rosethorn looked up from her desk with a warm smile. "Yes, please come in Nyoro-san. Thank you for coming."

Hoge entered quietly, shutting the door behind her. She approached the teacher's desk, rubbing her arm self-consciously. "Did I do something wrong?"

"Not at all," Rosethorn assured. "I just wanted to check on you. We haven't had a chance to talk one-on-one lately."

Hoge relaxed slightly. She took the seat Rosethorn gestured to, sitting primly with her hands folded.

"So tell me, how are you adjusting to life at dorms so far?" Rosethorn asked kindly. "I know it's been quite an eventful first year for your class."

"It's been challenging but rewarding in some aspects," Hoge said politely. "I'm very fortunate for this opportunity to stay safe and train alongside such talented peers. And yourself as well, Sensei."

Rosethorn smiled wryly. "You can relax, Nyoro-san. This isn't an evaluation."

Hoge blinked, caught off guard. She wasn't used to adults wanting casual conversation. 

"To be honest, I asked you here because I'm a bit concerned," Rosethorn admitted. "You've seemed distracted lately. Your performance remains exceptional, but you appear...troubled."

Hoge stared down at her lap. Was it so obvious, the storm raging inside her heart?

"Forgive my prying," Rosethorn said gently. "As your teacher, I want you to feel supported. Please know you can confide in me, if you wish."

Hoge worried her lower lip. Rosethorn had always been kind to her, unlike her parents.. And bottling up her feelings was exhausting. Still...

"I know something is weighing on you," Rosethorn prodded. "Does this have to do with a certain blonde, red-tie wearing boy?"

Hoge flushed, caught off guard. Was she that transparent?

Rosethorn smiled knowingly. "Perhaps about a boy named Inigo?"

Hoge drooped. No point denying it now. Haltingly, she admitted, "We've...grown close."

"I see." Rosethorn's eyes danced with humor. "And how do you feel about Inigo?"

Hoge fidgeted, staring at the tile. How did she feel? Happy, mostly. Being with Inigo was like basking in sunlight after years trapped in shadow. He saw her, accepted her, made her feel special. Valued. But the intensity also confused her.

"I-I don't know," Hoge muttered. "We went on a date at the start of the school year. I said yes without thinking. But now..." She trailed off uncertainly.

Rosethorn nodded. "I understand. First relationships can be complicated." She tilted her head, studying Hoge. "But you must have some feelings towards Inigo. Positive or negative."

Hoge chewed her lip. She did harbor deep affection for the playful boy who always tried to make her smile. But giving voice to those emotions felt dangerous.

"I...I do care for him," Hoge admitted softly, as if confessing a secret. Her cheeks burned. "Being around Inigo is fun. He's always so upbeat and lively.” She stared down at her fidgeting hands. "He makes me feel...noticed. Important. Like I matter."

Rosethorn listened intently, letting Hoge continue at her own pace.

"I know I'm standoffish. Not the easiest person to talk to or even see half the time." She huffed a self-deprecating laugh. "But Inigo still tries. He tells me I'm cute and wants to spend time together. And he's so patient when I get flustered or angry over silly things. I guess I feel happy with Inigo," Hoge admitted. "Happier than I've been in a long time. He's always on my mind lately and he makes my heartbeat calmer.. I've never experienced this before."

She shook her head, flushing. "Please don't tell anyone I said that. I know it's improper for students to date."

Rosethorn waved a hand. "I won't interfere in your personal affairs unless it affects your studies. Your secret is safe with me."

She smiled gently. "Young love is quite normal at your age. I'm glad you've found someone that makes you happy."

Hoge squirmed, both pleased and mortified that her teacher knew her feelings.

"Have you told Inigo how you feel?" Rosethorn asked.

Hoge's eyes widened. "N-no! I could never. What if I scare him away by saying too much?" She stared helplessly at Rosethorn. "I don't know how any of this works. It's terrifying."

Rosethorn made a sympathetic noise. "I understand your hesitation. Revealing emotions makes one feel quite vulnerable. But relationships require openness and honesty from both parties. The deeper the bond, the greater the need for communication."

Hoge bit her lip uncertainly.

"Inigo may surprise you," Rosethorn said gently. "He seems to care for you a great deal. I've noticed how his eyes follow you when you enter a room."

Rosethorn smiled. "My advice? Speak from the heart. The rest will develop naturally."

Hoge took a shaky breath. "I'll try, sensei. ."

"I understand. Matters of the heart can be trying." Rosethorn gave an exaggerated sigh. "Why, I remember my first crush. What a disaster! But we learn and grow." She winked. Hoge managed a  smile. 

"Thank you, Sensei." Hoge stood and bowed deeply. "You've given me much to think about."

"Of course. Let me know if I can help further." Rosethorn walked her to the door. "Oh, and Hoge?"

Hoge paused, glancing back.

"I asked because I have some wonderful news," Rosethorn said, beaming at her student. "Due to your exceptional academic performance and impressive provisional license exam score, you've been nominated for the prestigious Shining Hero Academics Award this year."

Hoge's eyes widened warily.

"Along with it comes a full scholarship to study abroad at an elite international hero school," Rosethorn continued.

Hoge sat stunned, struggling to process this unexpected information. Study abroad? Her?

"We have visitors to present the nomination and scholarship offer in person," Rosethorn went on. "I wanted to let you know before bringing them in."

"I don't know if I have time today, sensei." Hoge tried to say before a knock sounded at the door. "Come in!" and suddenly Hoge found herself facing the intimidating form of Wash, the #5 hero along with three other students and a handful of reporters.

Cameras flashed as Wash strode forward to shake Hoge's hand. "Congratulations, young lady! We've heard incredible things about your talents and can't wait for you to join our exchange program. I admire your sparkling clean record!"

He turned to Rosethorn. "Would you mind if we stole your star pupil here for a quick tour of your fine academy? Might make a good photo opp for the press release too."

Overwhelmed, Hoge shot a pleading look at Rosethorn even as the teachers ushered her out the door into the chaotic hallway, chattering voices and camera shutters assaulting her senses. She took a deep breath. One step at a time...then she would get through this and find Inigo.

###Chapter IV


Inigo made his way over to the classroom after lunch, expecting the usual midday bustle. But as he approached, he noticed an unusual commotion. There, amidst the crowd, he spotted Hoge, giving a tour to Pro-Hero Wash and a group of reporters. Cameras flashed as they captured her standing proudly in front of the Shiketsu trophy case, adorned with the awards won that year.

His heart skipped a beat at the sight of her. She looked radiant, bathed in the spotlight, her nervous smile only adding to her charm. Inigo couldn't help but pause, his gaze fixed on her, completely captivated by her presence.

As he watched, he overheard two girls from the crowd gossiping about Hoge.

"That's Nyoro Hoge, right? From the Hero Course. I heard she's getting some award. She might get a scholarship to an international hero school in Tokyo next year."

"Oooh. Is that more prestigious than UA?"

"It's a new school, but yeah."

Inigo's stomach churned with unease. A scholarship to another school? Would she really leave Shiketsu, leave him, for that opportunity? He shook his head, trying to push aside his worries. But before he could call out to her, he felt a tap on his shoulder.

"Inigo Myoga." Two officers stood behind him, along with one of the school guards. "We need you to come with us."

Inigo's heart raced as he turned to face them, confusion and apprehension evident in his expression. "What's this about, officer?"

"It's about an investigation into your involvement with Owari Sandatsu and a possible yakuza connection," one of the officers stated gravely. "Are you aware of the Daiichi Kai syndicate?"

Inigo's blood ran cold.  He didn't feel much as the officers led him away for questioning. But as he glanced back one last time, he caught Hoge's eyes. She was still shining in the spotlight. And in that moment, he couldn't shake the feeling of being pulled back into the shadows, away from the light she represented in his life. 

***
***

Inigo tapped his foot impatiently as the detectives grilled him with question after question. He knew the drill - they'd keep him here as long as they could trying to trip him up. The conviction rate in Japan was notoriously high. But the clock was ticking. Hoge was waiting.

Inigo sighed, glancing at the door. By now the clan were probably raising hell to get him released. It wasn't his first time being hauled here.

But today of all days? Inigo groaned internally, imagining Hoge leaving Shiketsu while he languished in this dreary interrogation room.

Finally the lead investigator, Officer Ikari, tossed his notebook down in frustration. "We've got nothing to hold him on. Cut him loose."

"But sir," another officer protested. "If we keep pressing a little longer..."

A knock on the door frame interrupted them. Another cop leaned in, phone held over his shoulder.

"The eyewitness changed their story," he reported. "Said now they're not sure the Myoga boy was even there."

"What? Why the sudden reversal?" Ikari demanded.

The officer shrugged. "Guilt? Cold feet? Who knows."

Ikari scowled, clearly unsatisfied letting a potential lead slip away. 

He strode into the interrogation room where Inigo sat.

"We can keep you here all day," Ikari said gruffly. "You might as well tell us if you know something."

Inigo’s voice was exasperated, “I already said everything. Look, I usually don’t mind being out of class. Hell, I can stay here all day - but today's special.”


Officer Ikari sighed. "I know it's valentine's, kid. You can get your chocolate later."


Inigo glared at him "You don't understand.." Ikari studied the teenage boy curiously. His glare was the same as that Junichi kid he hauled a few months back.

"And what big reason do you have for leaving early?"

Inigo glared, "True Love."

"Ah, youth." He grabbed his keys off his desk. "Good enough for me. C'mon boys, let's give Romeo a ride."

###Chapter V

Inigo sent Gigan flying to find Hoge and he ran the other way. He checked his watch anxiously as he hurried out of the school gates. 

“Hey bro, have you seen Hoge?” he asked as Imai and Ashleigh strolled past, holding hands.

Imai shook his head. "Sorry man."

Ashleigh pondered a moment. "Wait, I did see her get into a car earlier with those UA recruiters. Looked like she was with some other students too."

Inigo's face fell. Before he could spiral into panic, Officer Akari jogged up.

"Hey kid, you need a lift?" the officer asked kindly. "Hop in, I'll give you a ride."

Inigo nodded. "Thank you, yes! Please, as fast as possible!"

They jumped into the squad car and peeled off just as the first snowflakes of the day began drifting down.

***


Hoge sat stiffly in the sleek limousine carrying her, and four other top students to a special nominees dinner. Her peers chatted eagerly about the elite program, but Hoge just gazed silently out the window at the passing city, her mind a million miles away. 

Or rather, her heart - still back at Shiketsu with a particular blonde boy with an infectious grin. Suddenly the glittering prospect before her felt all wrong. She blended into the back of the car.

Hoge took a deep breath, then shouted out, "Stop!"

Everyone turned to her, surprised. Blushing fiercely, Hoge bowed her head. "I'm so sorry, but...I cannot accept this offer. Please, let me out!"

Before they could respond, she scrambled out, bowing once more before taking off at a dead sprint towards the school.

***


Hoge and Inigo arrived at opposite ends of a bridge at the same time, both flushed and panting clouds into the chill air. Inigo's heart stuttered at the sight of Hoge standing there with snowflakes glittering in her hair like stars.

"Hoge, I-" he began.

"Ini, I have to tell you-" she said simultaneously.

They both chuckled nervously, still breathing hard. Inigo gestured for her to continue.Hoge twisted her hands, uncertainty in her eyes. Far down the road, the nominee students and Officer Akari watched silently.

Sensing her hesitation, Inigo stepped forward. “Okay, I’ll start..  I don’t want you to go! I never want to leave again! I shouldn’t have - not without you. This year… has been the best year of my life!”

Blueish-green eyes grew cloudy. “We’ve grown so much closer. I still remember when you hated me. I was a huge asshole! We had awkward conversations where we couldn’t look each other in the eyes. Now, we laugh easily and share touches for no reason. It’s hard to say what goes on in my mind when we do that.. Or your mind. But I love what we have! You are a mystery to me, Nyoro Hoge! A mystery that I am hopelessly lost in.”

Below the bridge, the lights of the city began to glitter as dusk settled in. He pointed out at her and crossed the distance between them in three strides. “You look so cool! You’re so smart. Way smarter than me! I watch you pursue your dreams with all your ambition and all I want to do - is do my best to be with you through it all. You make me so happy, and I find myself asking, what can I do for you? How many ways can I make you smile? Make you laugh out loud at stupid references and jokes?” He shook his head bitterly. “Eventually - I know - you’re gonna grow bored of me… And that’s okay, because for brief moments in time I know that you’re paying attention to me - and listening and reading my words and sentences, but y’know - because of you, I’ve felt a whirlwind of emotions I wasn't even aware I could feel. I don't think any of us realize how nerve wracking bearing your soul out could feel. But I do. Because you got to know me and I got to know you. My whole life the only person I knew this well was myself, I was oblivious to how breathtaking the world could be. And you came in and shattered my reality. So thank you. Nyoro Hoge.. **I DON’T NEED ANY CHOCOLATES TODAY! OR ANY SPECIAL TREAT! I JUST WANT YOU.”**

"Baka… You have me.” Hoge's eyes shone like stars as she gazed up at him. “I couldn't accept the scholarship. I can never leave Shiketsu or you," She said quietly. "This year with you has been...everything. We've grown close and comfortable. I used to avoid your eyes, now I crave your laughter and touches. You shatter my world daily, in the most wonderful way."

She took a shuddering breath. "Saying let’s be together forever sounds cliche, but that’s exactly what I want. I want to see all the places and stories we could end up in. Whenever you look down at your shadow, I want to be by your side. I'll be your light in the darkness. Then when my own dark clouds roll in. Please, remind me that I'm not alone. I’m sorry if I confuse you at times. I’m used to doing things on my own.” Hoge lifted her misty eyes to Inigo's. "I'm no good at expressing emotions so I'll take my time and gradually let you know my heart.”

“I’ll take it.” Inigo grinned, pulling her into a hug as snow fell around them.

“Happy Valentine’s Day, Coru-chan..” he whispered into her hair.
“Happy Valentine’s, Ini..” Hoge whispered back, face burrowing into his chest.

He tilted her chin and tucked a loose strand of hair away. "Here’s to another year - of us..," he murmured. "Being with you has been pure magic. I love you.."

“Ini, I lo-” **“GET DOWN TO OCEAN PLUS FOR THE OYSTER SALE THIS FRIDAY! AND MEET THE SHELL MAN HIMSELF AND” A loud car radio passed by.**

Inigo swore revenge. Hoge giggled and bit her lip, then lifted herself up on her toes to press a soft, sweet kiss to his lips. Inigo's eyes widened in surprise before slowly drifting close. He pulled her tighter against him, returning the kiss with building passion as the golden twilight embraced them.

Behind them, the students watched and Officer Akari sobbed into his arm. This was better than his dramas.


“Uwa~! Ini, we’re still being watched.”
“Heh. You wanna make a run for it?”
“Yes.”

Laughing together, they launched into the air on Gigan’s wings, the falling snow and watching crowd fading away. Inigo soared above Kyoto with Hoge cradled gently against him, her arms wrapped around his neck. The cold February wind whipped past them, but Hoge felt nothing but warmth cradled close to Inigo's chest. Inigo gazed tenderly at the girl he held - the one who had captured his heart. She leaned in and whispered in his ear, and his smile grew brighter than any star in the pink-tinged skies.


###Chapter VI
“Huh, my key doesn’t work..”


"SURPRISE!" Inigo looked at Hoge questioningly. Had she finally lost it? They were back at his apartment. She was looking at him with a smug grin - like they were back in Chihiro’s dojo and she had learned a new technique faster than anyone.

"Do you like it?" Hoge squeezed his hand, eyes sparkling. "I was inspired to make it.” She tapped the door teasingly. “Though you’ll have to figure out how to get inside...”

Inigo just stared, still confused. Then a massive, delighted grin split his face. He leaned down and bit at the door handle.

“How did you- when did you- YOU TURNED MY DOOR CHOCOLATE?”

“I replaced it.” He whooped and pulled Hoge into an ecstatic spin. “You brilliant, wondrous, PERFECT weirdo! Have I mentioned I love you?!”

Laughing joyfully together, Inigo knew this was a night - and a love - he would cherish forever. No gift could ever match just having his precious Hoge here by his side. But munching chocolate off her lips could be a close second. 

“You know, I’m gonna pay you back twice as much on White Day!”
