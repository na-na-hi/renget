If we talk enough for it to be relevant, feel free to ask about my alters as well.
####Names
**always OK :** Bunnie , Clover , Doll , Elaine , Lain , Marionette , Miette , Pom , Ribbun , Sophie
**nicknames for those I'm close with :** Bunbun , Ellie , PomPom
####Pronouns
**always OK :** she/her , fae/faer , pom/poms , bun/buns , doll/dolls
It would make me extra happy if you used a mix of these , but when in doubt, default to she/her. **Please** do not call me they/them , it makes me dysphoric.

All feminine terms are preferred ( Miss , Sister , Princess , Queen , etc. ) and in tandem with words like girl or person you can also call use fox , doll or bun.
I'm okay with pet names like dear or sweetie , etc! Please don't call me "bean" though.
