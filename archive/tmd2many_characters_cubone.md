->Cubone is a strange member of some sort of nomadic tribe. He seems to speak in an archaic fashion, and often cites some manner of koan or saying when addressing others. The group met him travelling alongside a strange Salandit, on the hunt for some manner of old cultural artifact. Though he typically delivers things stone-faced and monotonously, he seems quite easy to annoy. From what little can be discerned, he's an oddball even among his fellow tribe members and associates. Unusually, Cubone doesn't seem to carry the bone club typical of his species.<-
