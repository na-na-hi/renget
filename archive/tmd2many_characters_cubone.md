->Cubone is a strange member of the Marrow Tribe, a small, nomadic tribe that has most recently taken residence east of Baram Town. He seems to speak in an archaic fashion, and does his best to remain unfailingly polite, though he occasionally slips into poetics. While stoic and uptight, he has somewhat of a temper easily activated by being patronized, and he seems to be atypically archaic even among the relatively self-contained residents of his tribe. He initially travelled alongside a Salandit who researches forgotten and lost history-particularly the history involving four Ruinous Pokemon from long ago.<-
