##Recommended Jailbreaks
Claude is very filter happy, would recommend you use https://rentry.org/claudebreak in addition to either fumblebum or pitanon's JBs. With these two combined, I went from a 90% filter rate to around 10%. You can also add it to an impersonation prompt, but be sure to alter it to say {{user}} rather than {{char}}.

Lower or raise the LRO stats accurately, do not apply traits until the stats have reached breakpoints. When a stat reaches a breakpoint, update it.] [INSERT CLAUDEBREAK HERE]```
