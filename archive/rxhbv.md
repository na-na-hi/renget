Reunion under the sea

Abbie/sunny

Sunny went into the most recondite place of the abyss, there was but one objective for such an unpleasant journey

HER

With the throne of hands under a new administration... the same administration...

it was Sunny's action that led to this, and shifting the blame wasn't going to happen this time

His mind divagates if for a bit, Black space always will have that effect on him, but between "it" not leaking anymore and instead just being a part of headspace, black space is becoming just another part of his dreams neither needless suffering nor blissfully ignorance

Is just the truth, or rather, his truth that manifests there

Should he call this place the abyss anymore? he already calls it black space and abyss pretty interchangeably, his clear separation becoming more diffuse with the black space acceptance into headspace

Mapping this place was a foolish errand by his chaotic, ever changing, nature yet some constant reminded and Abbi's prison was one of then 

Sunny finally arrives at the forgotten place, its tar-like floor just as semi-solid as ever, waiting to the slightest slip in concentration for it to eat whole its walker

But Abbi was nowhere to be seen, was she already free? unlikely, without making it official she was still a prisoner

Repress and cut from the rest

Sunny remembered his oldest Memory

----------------------

*12 years ago*

"Mommy and dad are making homework with Mari... boring!"

*The toys aren't fun without her* he pouted angrily *then I will make my own Mari, a better Mari!!*

*She will have more arms like a spider* Sunny froze for a moment before shaking his head *like.... an octopus!*

*And, and, and she will be the smartest and kindes with all the free time in the world*

"how do I look like?"

Sunny thought for a moment "only a mouth is fine so i can know if you are happy or sad"

"i see"

Finally realizing he wasn't alone in the backyard anymore, Sunny looked at the new entity before beaming with happiness

A small, chibi-like creature was looking at him, nothing but a face surrounded by 8 tentacles and said face just a question mark and a smile 

"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey, you are here aaaaaaa you eeeeeeeeeee"

"Sunny, did you create me without thinking of a name?" She was curious that god didn't think this far ahead "that kinda rude"

"Sorry... what name do you like?"

"mmm, oh! can i call me like that super church?"

Sunny try to remember that name he hear one time, but he wasn't really paying attention "Abbi?"

"Yeah, that one! can I have it Sunny? pretty please?"

"Is all yours Abby!"

----------------------------------------------

Emerging from the "floor", 8 tentacles  surrounded Sunny

Before he could know what was happening a huge head erupted causing a wave of tard, engulfing Sunny in the thick liquid

Sunny try to swim up but it was like he was swimming in slow motion, his every action needing so much strength for miserable mobility

The air was running out

------------------------------------------------------

*8 years ago*

Sunny was crying without consolation, Mari will come back at any moment and she surely will hate him for this

"Sunny"

Startle by the sudden sound, Sunny raised his head from his personal ball of misery, his gaze met with his most trusted of friends, the wise

As Sunny imagination became stronger so did she. now in a humanoid form with more of her extra extremities gone minus 2 tentacles in her head, looking like pigtails, she sported a school uniform similar to Mari's now

"It was but an accident, don't be so hard on yourself"

Sunny looked at the ripped sweater, Mari's favorite was no more

"Do you feel bad for what you did?" Sunny nodded a lot in quick succession, with a sniff his teary eyes threatened to spill over ones again

"There's only one thing to do sunshine"

The main door could be heard being open, Sunny got up

After cleaning his tears with one hand, he grabbed the sweater and exited the room

--------------------------------------------------

Gasping for air, he finally got out

his lungs working overtime for the missing time, slowly he regained his footing in the cursed "floor"

The giant head open his one eye

They both stare at each other, their neutral expressions changing as painful Memories came back

Yet her question told a different story "Who are you?"

Sunny couldn't believe it "I am Sunny, the dreamer of this place!"

"Sunny... so familiar.... yet... so evasive" Abbie closed her eye "the dreamer of this place....  doesn't use that form....  of yours anymore"

"do you remember? the truth?"

Opening her eye she looked at him "i know... it exist... yet ... it's content.... have been lost... from my memory"

Resting his hand in her head, Sunny revoked her sentence and returned her title

Abbie's eye widen as her memory became free and returned to her

-------------------------------------------

All these sudden changes

This new "white space"

Closing almost all the abyss just to trow these "somethings" there

She is not even allowed to say their real names, their real meaning that Sunny so desperately rejects

This Headspace perfected her body, giving her a face, but also pajamas to fit the new purpose of this place

Even if she didn't approve of any of it

Using such imagination for such a horrible purpose, it pained her to see all so scripted by one mess up directive by "IT"

He needed time, she is sure of it, but one pep talk will be enough for him to focus his mind on something for the better, rather than for the worst

The dreamer may have split himself in two, but only one part holds the real power even if the other is eroding it all the time with sweet lies

She opens the door of the White prison, she is sure the monochrome monster will be here shortly

Forcing him to stand up, Abbie look directly at Sunny under the black lightbulb

His eyes missing they light, just dry tears remaining

"Sunny you have to tell your friends the truth!" she shake him trying to wake up the lovely boy he knew was in front of her "they deserve to know that you killed Mari!"

"Ma...ri?" Sunny broke once again into crying, even here he felt the burden in his soul being too much to bear

Before she could hug him she felt two taps on her shoulder, it was quicker than she ever anticipated

By the time she turns her head, the knife already penetrated her cornea, the agonizing scream muffled by a red hand strangling her

The red Swarmn pin her down face first to the ground, plunging the knife entirely

Sunny would never allow such a thing to transpire like nothing... then why?

With the threat dealt with, Omori hugged Sunny "it was an accident, I didn't mean it, it was an accident" Omori just stood there while Sunny sounded like a broken record, a broken spirit

He turned his head when Abbie got free if for a moment, her unrelenting spirit only matched by her screams" Kel , Aubrey, and Hero need you! Basil needs you!" despite everything, the things that pained her the most was that broken gaze of him "I NEED YOU!... so please... stop this madness"

She extends her hands, Sunny is there somewhere, just one pep talk, just one push in the right direction will surely, it has to be, if not then

If she doesn't do it now he may

Sunny disappeared in front of her eye, now absorbed by Omori

it was emotionless, it was uncaring, it was weak for the same reason that made then strong in this place

Omori stare...

Reality itself glitched for a second before a knife dropped to the ground

Omori walked to it and grabbed it, at the tip was a cristal orb penetrated by the weapon, full of a rainbow mist

It was only natural that one of the three guardians will have so much imagination stored inside of it, the only things surpassing then being the dream friends and Omori itself

It took out the knife before giving it a final look

The orb cracked at the strong grip of Omori until, finally, breaking into pieces, is power being absorbed by it

No one will challenge his power again

Or so it thought

---------------------------------------

Yet again,  she looked at the dreamer

Missing an eye but with the spark of hope back in the remaining, she could hardly believe it

"Is over Abbie... I told them the truth, just like I should have so long ago... just like you told me" a melancholic smile painted his face "is finally over"

"I... did it?... I was... a good guardian?"

Clenching his teeth he rushed to hug her "No! you were the best guardian i could have ever asked for! I just..." the tear rolled down his cheeks "I am so sorry Abbie, for everything, if I were stronger back then... then maybe you wouldn't..."

"I so happy... I could... fulfill my duty" she embrace him "Welcome back... Sunny"

They stood there for what felt like ages until, suddenly, Abbie started to glow

The faint light rapidly became blinding

No more she will be separated from the dreamer, no more he will miss her guidance, this time they will stay together to the bitter end

----------------------------------------------

Sunny woke up

Stretching before leaving his bed, he got up and made his way to the door

He stopped under the door frame "your coming?"



"always!"
