#####Palm Reading 
	
The wind howled outside the stone walls of the barracks as Ugoki Ayagi, a hulking Trollkind, jerked awake. His blue, hardened palm throbbed as if the skin was being sheared off by a molten iron rod. As he raised his hand to his gaze, a radiant emblem of unknown origin was being magically etched into his skin. An unworldly pain enveloped him, blurring his vision and turning his blood to fire. His gnarled teeth ground together as the glowing emblem completed its arcane formation, and his entire palm was consumed in an intense, dark-orange glow radiating from the mark.

The pain was beyond any mortal comprehension, but it was the surreal flash of light that alerted the guard stationed in the vicinity, and stirred the others in the barracks to awaken. As the watch captain burst into the room, he found Ayagi grimacing in pain as he rolled on the ground, his hand raised like a beacon in the darkened room, an orange light illuminating his rugged features with an ethereal glow. The watch captain, a grizzled veteran of many battles, could only gape in shock and awe at the sight. Stories and legends of the chosen heroes, the Auspices, had been part of his bedtime tales as a child, but to witness the birth of one was beyond his wildest imaginations.

The disturbance roused the city, the flash of Ayagi's emblem visible from the remotest corners. It wasn't long before the Emperor's guard, draped in their ceremonial armor, arrived at the scene, the resounding clang of their weapons a testament to the magnitude of the unfolding situation. They swiftly escorted Ayagi, still dazed and pained, to the imperial palace.

The Emperor, a wise and ancient ruler, received Ayagi with an expression of solemn gravity. As Ayagi stumbled into the grandeur of the imperial chamber, his head still spinning from the throbbing pain on the center of his palm, the Emperor began speaking. He told Ayagi about his destiny, and how his life as an ordinary city watchman was forever altered, never to return again. The etching on his palm, the emperor explained, marked him as an Auspice, a chosen hero. The sign of the Wanderer, a mark usually borne by the races from the far West, was a rarity among the Trollkind.

Being marked as an Auspice was a noble yet ominous honor. Especially for a Demi-Human like Ugoki, since their lands were far removed from the territories of any potential Evils - those villains chosen by the same mysterious powers that selected the Auspices. The villains were marked with their own symbols--destined to be the adversaries of the Auspices.

The Emperor then revealed to Ugoki the daunting task that lay ahead. The sign of the Wanderer signified a journey, a quest of immense proportions. Ugoki's path lay to the West, to the lands of the common races and the uncharted territories, towards the confrontation that would decide the fate of the world. From this moment forward, he was no longer just Ugoki Ayagi, a city watchman, but an Auspice of the Wanderer, a chosen hero destined to save the planet from the grip of evil.

#####Well-Traveled

Ugokis new life as an auspice was shrouded in enigma--even more so for the one chosen as the Wanderer. This mark was distinctive from other Auspice symbols, not a mere declaration of destiny, but more so as a tutor, a mentor that guided its bearer to their unique role among other chosen heroes. For Ugoki, his mark held profound transformative power. It gifted him abilities rooted in the core of his being, amplifying his Trollkind heritage, and endowing him with potent earth-based magic.

As a member of the Trollkind, Ugoki already possessed a natural ability for quick regeneration and an innate robustness that allowed him to withstand, evade, and shrug off damage. His mark, however, amplified these attributes, turning him into a living bulwark, a stalwart defender. It aligned with his deeply ingrained belief in duty and self-sacrifice, shaping his powers to reflect his noble spirit.

The emblem on his palm served as more than a conduit for his abilities. It acted as a guide, glowing faintly whenever an opportunity for learning or training presented itself. Through these signals, Ugoki navigated his westward journey, a path laden with dangerous monsters and vibrant, humble settlements.

The thrill of the battle honed his abilities, turning his raw, newfound power into a refined tool of defense. Every beast he felled, every challenge he overcame, was a stepping stone to mastering his Auspice gifts. The villages and hamlets that dotted his path provided a different kind of training ground. Here, he learned the secrets of witchcraft brewing, the subtle art of herbology, and crafting magical items. He sat with the old masters, listened to their stories, and observed their craft, adding to his repertoire of knowledge and skills.

Another unique feature of his Wanderer mark was its linguistic capabilities. As he journeyed from his homeland in the far lands towards the common territories, he encountered myriad languages and dialects. His mark miraculously helped him understand these tongues, providing translations, albeit sometimes imperfect ones. It turned him into a cross-cultural explorer, facilitating communication and interaction with the diverse inhabitants of the regions he traversed.

Thus, step by step, day by day, Ugoki Ayagi, a Wanderer Auspice, journeyed westwards.

#####A Journey's Beginning.

After many moons of travel, countless battles, and innumerable lessons learned, Ugoki found himself on the threshold of the Common Lands. His body had become hardened, a living testament to the trials he had weathered. His mind had been shaped by his experiences, his spirit molded by the burden of his divine duty. Ugoki had grown to understand and accept his responsibilities, ready to face the looming threat that might not directly affect his distant homeland, yet threatened the balance of the world.

Arriving at a human settlement, his monstrous silhouette was starkly alien silhouette against the night sky. The guards on the ramparts of the walled settlement peered into the dim light, their eyes widened in shock at the sight of his hulking, Trollkind form. They had heard tales of Trollkind, of course, but never had they seen one in the flesh. Terrifying rumors of creatures spawned by the chosen evil had been circulating, and fear gripped the guardsmen as they mistook Ugoki for one such monster.

A clamor of alarms echoed through the still night as the guard sprung into action. The settlement came alive with fear and chaos as archers hastily strung their bows and spearmen assembled at the gates. All weapons were trained on the troll, their steel points glinting ominously in the moonlight.

In response, Ugoki calmly placed his magical marble mace on the ground, the thud of its weight against the earth resonating like a thunderclap. The sound echoed through the silent night, causing the earth to vibrate subtly, and silencing the crowd with its might. Raising his marked hand to the sky, Ugoki spoke in a resonant voice that filled the night air. ""Fear not the stranger before you, for I am a chosen champion of the divine powers. I, Ugoki, come bearing not a sword of war, but a shield of salvation!" he announced, his tone resolute.

He then opened his palm, and the emblem of the Wanderer ignited, casting an intense, dark orange glow that illuminated the night. The brilliant light revealed his true identity, the mark of the Auspice visible for all to see. The guards lowered their weapons, their faces lit with awe and reverence as the realization dawned upon them. A hero stood before them, a beacon of hope in their troubled times, a warrior who had journeyed from the farthest lands to fulfill his destiny. For the first time since Ugoki's journey began, he felt truly recognized as an Auspice. His journey was far from over, but here in the Common Lands, his destiny had truly begun to unfold.
