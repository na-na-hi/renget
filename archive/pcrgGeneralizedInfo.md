##->Limited targets<-
These units are only available during their specific banners, which are typically once a year. A newly released unit will re-run around 6-7 months after their initial release. Re-runs for any other units will take place in their seasonal window, generally. 

### Clan Battle
Units listed here perform very well in Clan Battle. 
**New Years Neneka** - An excellent buffer for mage teams. While the Wind does not have excellent mage options, she will perform once they do. In addition, one of the few units that can perform off element. For maximum value, she is used in heavy manual timelines.
**New Years Homare** - Multi-target mage damage dealer that gets stronger the more enemies she faces. Used in CB, PvE and PvP modes. Dominant Fire mage MT unit.
**Liberator Nozomi** - Excellent Light unit that restore a large amount of TP for physical units only on first cast of S2. Large usage in CB, Arena and various other game modes. 
**Creditta** - Light MT physical debuffer/damage hybrid with TP restoration and Healing over time. Pairs extremely well with Hatsune & Shiori.
**Warlock Djeeta** - Mage debuffer/buffer/damage dealer that has seen consistent usage in CB since release.  UE coming in May 2024, so save up.
**Christmas Christina** - The unit herself is fairly awful, but the +3 TP from her bond stories have had an impact on comps in the past for her 6 Star version. It is possible that a UE2 will save her, but, the reason you roll is for the +3TP. She's a water unit.
**Valentine's Shizuru** - Thanks to UE2, V.Shizuru has returned as a primary buffer for fire physical comps. She's a buffer/debuffer that hands out Physical buffs and TP to the team. 
**Christmas Ayane** - Another UE2 winner, X.Ayane no longer kills herself on UB and has the stats to consistently pump out UBs, thanks to the S2+ upgrades she received. An excellent Water physical damage dealer that is all about critting for big damage.

### Arena
Units listed here perform very well in Arena game modes. While you can survive without some, these do make it significantly easier to maintain a high rank. **Arena game modes do not take elements into consideration in fights.**
**Swimsuit Saren** - Used to TP charge for fast UBs in Arena. TP applies to both magic and physical units. Mostly seen on offensive teams in Battle Arena, but is also seen on defense teams in Princess Arena.
**Swimsuit Hatsune** - Used in burst comps in Arena, quick side story clearing and Battle Stadium comps.
**Transfer Student Kyaru** - Used in many offense comps that require a P.def buff to facilitate running squishier comps, while being able to snipe backline units with her UB due to targeting mechanics.
**Halloween Misaki** With her UE2, H.Misaki has seen renewed usage on defense and offense due to her S2+ now providing a barrier and increasing M.Def. Her Charm, Curse damage and bind CC to all make her a powerful threat.
