>running the gauntlet through a small Spanish town to find the president's daughter
>sounds easy enough, right?
>just go in and get out
>armed resistance was expected, just not the severity of it
>you had packed accordingly for the mission but somehow things were worse than the briefings explained
>the reception was hostile to say the least
>you'd lost track of the amount of villagers you'd gunned down
>this was unreal
>different than the Raccoon City incident 
>they were smarter
>parasites meant each one was faster and smarter than decaying zombies
>you'd had a few close calls but managed
>recovering weapons as you went helped
>you were getting tired of getting screamed at in Spanish 
>the one friendly face that dude with the trench coat
>he seemed to always be ahead of you 
>but just kept taking money for firearms
>you just assumed shithole village was why he had that rocket launcher
>you wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth
>the trail to Ashley was warm now
>what you didn't expect after finally reaching her was a giant mouse girl screaming "don't come"
>you were pelted with a bunch of junk the second you'd opened the door
>the flimsy debris was swatted aside easily and you were quick to assure Ashley you were here to help
>that seemed to calm her for the moment
>you tried to lighten the mood a little, no doubt the kidnapping had her on edge
>of she even saw half the shit you did that might have her spooked
>when you said you were "cheesed to meet her" that stunned her into silence 
>well maybe not the desired effect but she'd calmed down
>you just needed to get out now
>before you set out you gave Hunnigan a report on Ashley's status
>visually she looked healthy and fine
>a rushed series of questions after reporting to Hunnigan confirmed the giant mouse was indeed fine
>looks like the villagers just scared her a little and nothing else
>whatever the group wanted for ransom, they had at least kept her unharmed
>maybe they really were civilized
>probably easier said than done
>the next length of your journey was quieter
>it felt deathly silent
>now you were really not wanting your cover blown
>you could handle yourself fine but you didn't need to get Ashley in danger
>you headed back through the church and leapt down a ladder
>guiding Ashley to leap down was difficult 
>but through silent coaxing she ended up landing in your arms
>you then both encountered a strange robed man 
>started muttering about America and you barely paid attention until he brought up you both had the parasites now
>those weird bugs hadn't hatched yet but he said it was only a matter of time
>all the smooth confidence of a comic book supervillain 
>his desire to have the girl back was something you couldn't indulge in
>a flash behind you made you realize the monologing was distracting
>robed cultists with crossbows
>you pulled Ashley through a nearby window faster than it would take to say "no way fags"
>Ashley looked genuinely worried and you couldn't lie and say you weren't also really anxious
>if those eggs hatched you'd be no different than those guys with the chainsaws and dynamite running around
>you promised her it wouldn't come to that
>somehow you'd set this straight
>you just didn't know how
>but like hell were you letting some super tapeworm win
>Ashley seemed to warm up to you after that whole bravado act
>you wondered if she was adopted after meeting the human president 
>five foot mouse girls with… ballistics don't just pop up without reason
>regardless of your pondering she clung tighter to you
>her white furred arm hooked on yours as she timidly watched your surroundings
>things were noticeably different with Ashley 
>it was more of a challenge dealing with the same group of crazies now
>Ashley was very vulnerable 
>a fact you were quickly aware of 
>you had to micromanage 
>the one upside was the villagers and cultists seemed to avoid hurting her
>"Help!"
>constantly squeaked out after some weirdo picked her up
>you were getting better at kneecapping anyone trying to kidnap her
>escape wasn't possible until you got the parasites out and that Saddler knew it
>you didn't talk that much about it with Ashley
>she was nervous as is
>the mission briefing hadn't covered a lot of this
>so after a while you just ran on instinct 
>Ashley needed help and you had a gun
>simple equation
>you weren't exactly running low on ammo either
>but this job had gotten tougher and it was inevitable that someone would kill you
>Ashley at least was company 
>she was trying to be helpful at least
>she'd bring back ammo or gold if you told her to hide
>ducked out of the way of fire
>you rarely got a break from attacks though
>when you got winged in the arm she acted like you were going to die
>before you could react she pulled you into a rundown cabin
>she had seen you use enough of those herbs and had the first aid supplies out of your case in seconds
>clawed hands deftly pulled your shirt up and she briefly stopped herself before remembering she was attempting to help
>you had managed to briefly buy yourself piece despite the farming tool catching your arm
>that did indeed hurt like hell
>laying back against the wall and catching your breath was welcome
>you noticed Ashley had paused and you looked up confused
>it allowed you to get a good look at the mouse
>a giant mouse
>unusual 
>no one had mentioned Ashley was a giant mouse
>none of the Spaniards seem to make note of it
>Hunnigan didn't either
>you couldn't blame a concussion or anything
>it seemed rude to ask her face to face
>was she blushing? 
>hard to tell through the white fur but she definitely looked skittish in a different way
>not like when you were getting shot at 
>she seemed to notice you noticing and went rigid 
>then her blue eyes went back to your arm and her regular panic returned
>you were surprised she had steady enough hands to treat and bandage the slash
>when you put your shirt back on she looked… disappointed?
>then she remembered the angry Europeans around you all
>thankfully, they hadn't noticed the cabin or decided to attack it at least
>you were shocked when you went upstairs and found a man
>Ashley hid behind you but this one didn't seem hostile
>introduced himself as a police officer 
>commented on the president's daughter's ballistics 
>did he not notice she was a giant mouse?
>you didn't know how to approach that but let Luis talk
>didn't take long for the villagers to notice the cabin after the talk
>the peace and quiet had been shortlived
>they poured in like ants
>Luis was fairly snappy with his gun and you were not slouch yourself 
>your shot gun cleared the ones dumb enough to try the windows
>when that ran out you were taking potshots
>thinking quickly Luis rushed Ashley to a nearby cabinet
>she'd be protected when it got ugly
>yet again the Spainard didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>was it just you being weird?
>no 
>that couldn't be
>the president wasn't a giant mouse
>maybe the first lady had an affair with a rodent?
>a scythe flew over your head and you quickly lost your train of thought to shooting again
>after a tense amount of time they seemed to back off
>good thing too, you would have to see that merchant for ammo
>you called Ashley out and she was so relieved she leapt and hugged your back
>she felt… firm?
>not that you got hugged from behind all that much by women
>you just expected things to be softer
>you wanted to focus on the task at hand now
>pushing your musings back and dealing with the important crap
>Luis laughed
>again, didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>well whatever
>you'd have to part ways and meet again elsewhere
>escape was the main plan, while getting rid of those plagas bugs
>wouldn't do much good to leave while infected
>after parting from Luis you were quickly chased, were they waiting for you?
>you scooped up Ashley despite the protests and carried her bridal style
>you realized too late they seemed to be pushing you towards a creepy castle
>but you had no choice
>the mouse girl felt obscenely warm in your arms as you ran
>she'd given up protesting pretty quickly 
>no idea why, she was very vocal when she wanted to be
>you slid through the gates and instantly felt like the fly in the spider's web
>another weirdo greeted you 
>some manlet once again monologuing 
>you set down Ashley and she hid behind you without a word
>that was a mistake on your part
>because that gave the plagas control a chance
>it was something you didn't notice at first
>but then Ashley had pulled your sidearm and had it pointed at you
>those blue eyes now dull red
>were you too late?
>the midget giggled to himself as the mouse girl maneuvered around you
>the whole time your firearm pointed straight at your head
>was her hand shaking?
>it had to be
>you couldn't be too late
>that parasite would have no reason to not blow your brains out all over this carpet
>Salazar's smugness slowly faded when he must have realized the same thing
>cultists started slowly advancing on you but you didn't want to leave Ashley
>while she seemed to have some control she didn't have total control and she turned and walked past the robed monks
>you hated this
>but you swore you'd fix this
>you dashed across the room, dodging a flail as you ran
>there was a free door in the corner and you hoped you could escape the situation
>you weren't giving up
>not even close
>you were stuck in a running gunfight with the cultists for a few rooms 
>after the chase they seemed to withdraw 
>it had been hectic but you'd bought yourself some peace
>you looted a few of the dead
>the finds were sparse but you did get some ammo and a incendiary grenade out of it
>somehow
>you'd have to figure out how to recover Ashley and escape 
>it just couldn't be too late to save her
>you refused to entertain the idea
>however the new privacy gave you an idea
>you got on the radio to Hunnigan
>things about this situation were bothering you
>you downplayed the current shitshow
>you had to ask it bluntly
>why is the president's daughter a giant mouse?
>Hunningan paused
>"what are you talking about?"
>it was your turn to pause
>so it was unusual
>you quickly recovered and said you must have been mistaken
>"maybe you took a hit on the head? you need to take care of yourself out there"
>yeah it's just brain damage, Hunnigan
>yeah
>well it didn't change your current situation 
>you weren't leaving Ashley to the cult
>whatever the hell was going on you weren't letting that happen
>you took the time to reload and snuck back out
>you made your way through the halls, encountering resistance 
>you gunned down cultists and kept going
>on rare occasions you'd run into a puzzle
>it strained your mind for awhile but you wouldn't let yourself be stopped
>you eventually found yourself a rifle 
>felt good in your hands
>rarely hand any chance to use it
>until
>a massive chamber 
>and below you was Ashley
>still a giant mouse 
>but a giant mouse strapped to a wall
>you breathed deep and took shots at the cultists around her
>you quickly dropped her guards
>she looked up and you were still weirded out by the mouse thing
>at least they didn't harm a golden hair on her head
>you felt relief 
>you ran downstairs to her as quickly as possible
>when you freed her you were surprised
>she pounced on you and you fumbled with your side arm before she pressed her mouth to yours
>the muzzle felt weird but the affection was the first real kindness you'd felt here
>if someone wanted to kill you they could with your guard down 
>at the moment you just melted into the kiss

>after a brief moment, you pushed Ashley up and got up
>you had no idea why that just happened but you couldn't get distracted
>you almost considered it was a ploy by whatever controlled her 
>but Ashley's eyes were that pretty ocean blue
>the red was gone from them
>she really tried to find anything in the room to look at besides your gaze
>but she wasn't pointing a gun at you
>you asked if she was OK and she relaxed a little
>her body posture 
>"I'm sorry about earlier, it was like I couldn't control myself"
>was this about the gun or the kiss?
>she locked up with an "eep"
>then stammered while trying to look at the carpet
>"shouldn't we get going?"
>the change of subject was obvious but you'd roll with it
>her tail swayed as you bet she mentally hoped you bought it
>you had considered ask her outright why she was a mouse but that still felt rude
>you don't just go and ask that
>the kiss did make you look at Ashley a little differently 
>but that was something you'd have to put on the backburner 
>she did at least still look nice despite the kidnapping and attacks
>you wondered just how she didn't get chilly with that plaid skirt
>maybe that's why she seemed to huddle up to you when you both made your way out to the chamber
>her fur was still silky smooth to your bare arm
>the kiss was still present on your mind
>why did she jump you?
>was it her way of showing gratitude?
>you had kissed a mouse
>you almost didn't notice the cultists 
>almost
>another gunfight ensued
>three more corpses
>but the odds were not in your favor
>you grabbed her wrist and bolted for a small room
>you pushed Ashley towards a cabinet and shoved a desk in front of door
>you felt fortunate that they were super predictable 
>they would try to batter down the door
>you had your shotgun pointed at the door when the banging started
>you waited
>banging intensified 
>the door buckled slightly
>there were more than a few
>and they clearly had hatchets
>more gouges in the door
>you waited
>sweat dripped off you as you mentally readied yourself
>deep breaths
>Ashley was nervous
>she tried to keep quiet behind you but you heard her squeaks everyone other hit on the door
>still, you waited
>you fought the urge to flinch on the strikes yourself 
>instead you just braced the shotgun tightly against your waist
>only when they finally busted parts of the door did you act
>you saw their faces as buckshot hit the crowd around the entrance at center mass
>it wasn't as violent as a headshot but you knocked them back
>you followed it with another shot
>and another
>the door was shredded now
>as were the cultists dumb enough to cluster around it
>so with that small peace you shouted back to Ashley
>you both had to move
>she fumbled out of the cabinet onto her face
>ass up in the air she was instantly mindful of her skirt and she panicked covering back up
>she rose quickly, dusting off her sleeveless orange sweater 
>you two didn't have time so you decided to throw Ashley on your shoulder 
>you had her head bouncing against your thigh despite her very vocal protests
>there was no time to lose and the cultists had to all be on high alert
>you didn't know how the parasite shared information but they'd be here in no time
>your hand was firm above her tail to hold her steady on your shoulder
>the adrenaline had your heart racing a mile a minute and you ignored everything except getting to safety with Ashley in tow
>they had to be trying to bog you down in fights, had to be
>so for now your best option was stealth
>you ran through empty chambers, thankful to hear nothing else
>they would try and trail you two but you hoped to put just enough distance between the last fight and you
>Ashley needed doubt felt this was undignified, alternating between squeaking protests and waving her hands around
>she was light on your shoulder
>that much you remembered
>trouble hit like a freight train when you entered one room
>it was almost like a cage
>you didn't have time to ask for what when you noticed a hulking figure with giant claws
>he was on edge but his back was to you
>some growth on his back, the plagas drew your attention
>before you could react the other door opposite your entryway swung open
>the cultist didn't even know what hit him when the giant leapt and tore into him
>it didn't distinguish between friend or foe 
>you quickly put two and two together
>when you entered you were damn near silent
>this thing must need noise to know what's happening
>that's when you remembered your passenger
>Ashley almost screamed at the new threat but you grabbed her by the back of the head and smashed her face into your crotch to muffle her
>the mouse clawed at your pants at first
>you almost reacted at the little razor sharp things scratching through the fabric
>but past experience had you keeping completely silent
>those claws on the blind creature could do worse than Ashley's 
>the mess of gore on the floor was proof enough of that
>you had the back of her blonde hair gripped tight
>she was mashed as tight against your crotch as possible
>thankfully muffled
>her boots failed and threatened to throw you off balance but you held still
>you'd have only one chance at this
>you'd been saving the magnum for something really special
>the stopping power something that couldn't be matched elsewhere 
>you didn't dare risk the peashooter
>you'd have one shot and then the creature would either be dead or would react
>you weren't confident that reaction would be good for your health
>pressing Ashley tight against you, you used your other arm to line up the shot
>you were about four arms length away
>you'd stilled your breath and readied your body for the kickback
>one shot felt like it would rip your arm from the joint
>but it did the job and the thing died instantly 
>Ashley muffled against your pants brought you back to reality 
>you were about to set her down when the unexpected happen
>in her renewed struggle against your grip something dropped and rolled across the floor
>an orange?
>what?
>or was that a grapefruit?
>now wasn't the time to categorize citrus though
>because the hushed silence and her frozen reaction made you keenly aware of another sensation
>your shoulder was wet through the fabric 
>you were aware this wasn't the best place for this
>however… this was pressing against your shoulder
>you set Ashley down gently and if there was awkward behavior before, this took the cake
>she, no he, stood there with one "boob" 
>the other had rolled out onto the floor
>trying really hard to keep the skirt fabric from tenting
>you shut the one door the cultist had stumbled through
>you two needed to talk
>something the mouse didn't seem ready for 
>was this Ashley?
>you'd had your suspicions since the whole giant mouse thing
>now you find out it was a mouse boy
>what the hell was going on
>what you didn't expect was he wouldn't even let you get a word out
>you were all ready to start asking 20 questions and Ashley stole your thunder by falling against you and start sobbing loudly
>your anger at the deception didn't last long in the face of this
>you felt awkward hugging the mouse but your arms just instinctively went to hold who was crying against your chest
>you really hoped a cultist didn't decide now was a good time
>you didn't say anything initially, >it felt natural to allow Ashley to let it out and you weren't getting answers until everything calmed down
>the embrace seemed to do it
>eventually the sobbing slowed and he relaxed a little
>the huge ears on his head twitched a little at you clearing your throat
>you came out and said it
>why was the president dressing his son in girl outfits?
>it was a strange lifestyle choice
>also second point 
>did Ashley realize he was a giant mouse?
>you ended with the promise you weren't pissed
>more confused than anything
>he needed to give you answers
>especially if you two were going to make it out of here
>"so…"
>the voice was still hushed and a little raspy after the cry
>"I have a confession. I'm not the president's daughter"
>of course, he was a boy
>"no no. I mean I'm maybe not Ashley."
>what
>you didn't see this coming
>but why did the cult kidnap him?
>you were conversing in whispers just in case
>"I was in town where the president's daughter was, wearing the same outfit"
>maybe these villagers weren't really civilized after all
>but the mouse thing
>a tail, giant ears 
>how did they not figure that one out?
>you didn't initially question it but you did find it strange
>"I'd always hear all these cool adventures from my older brother."
>you were wondering where he was going with this and let him continue
>"see he followed these siblings around on all their little escapades. I think he said they were named the Redfields."
>that made you perk up
>but no
>that was too much of a coincidence 
>had to be
>"he even wrote it all down. I just thought it sounded cool"
>he pulled himself against your chest again
>didn't really address the crossdressing 
>or why he was a giant mouse
>but you didn't bother with details
>what he said earlier came back to you
>so they didn't kidnap the president's daughter
>"the whole time they thought I was her and they've never bothered to confirm it."
>so they just nabbed a giant mouse with a penis and grapefruits down his sweater
>and never questioned it
>still haven't questioned it
>maybe the parasite makes them collectively fail to see the obvious
>like a hive mind stupidity
>granted, you rolled with it
>but this was actually good news
>you patted Ashley on the back and said it was OK
>actually, better than ok 
>the president's daughter was off partying somewhere and safe
>this terror organization fumbled and revealed their hand
>all you had to do was get the bugs out of you two and install democracy on this shitty little cult
>you weighed the pros and cons of telling your bosses
>might just play along for the moment
>Ashley had calmed down now
>wait that wasn't right
>what was his real name?
>you'd have to call him Ashley around this area to keep up appearances but you were owed that much
>he huffed against your chest and you remembered how warm he was 
>"I guess you're right. you rescued me. so I guess my knight in shining armor deserves a name. it's Ash, no kidding."
>was he snuggling up to your chest right now?
>so you took mental notes
>the situation wasn't ideal 
>and you had plenty of questions
>you made an executive decision to hold onto the information about the president's daughter
>she was safe as long as they thought this mouse was her
>you pat the back of Ash's hair
>it probably wasn't his real name
>too much of coincidence 
>granted, you didn't know what to think
>so you picked him up delicately and allowed him to stand under his own power
>you two were going to have to rely on one another if you were to get out of here
>you wanted him to really understand that
>you weren't using him as bait for the cultists
>that would imply he'd get hurt
>you clasped your hands on his shoulders and promised him you'd bring him home safe
>that's probably when the trouble began
>because if he wasn't clingy before, he had your arm in death grip now for some reason
>but he didn't seem scared now
>you had no idea why he was holding on like that
>but at least he relaxed
>you'd get more out of him later
>possibly ask why Luis didn't seem bothered by the rodent
>you were about to head out the door when he scrambled away and grabbed his "boob"
>some readjustment and they looked like they could fool anyone again
>now you could leave and Ash took up his place next to you
>you had a strong urge to continue your conversation with your companion
>there was definitely a lot that needed to be said
>but you also needed to sneak out 
>he followed right behind you and you got better at not getting tripped up
>the cultists seemed to be unaware of your presence now and you wanted to keep it that way
>when you got to a strange bottomless pit with platforms scattered to an exit on the other side you breathed in
>you were sure Ashley wouldn't make it himself
>you instead looked over your shoulder and told him to hold onto you
>you'd hopefully jump these piggyback style
>he looked hesitant 
>you smiled and said you promised you get you both through this
>he was in good hands
>that made him shift a little but it won him over
>his slender arms around your neck were warmer and softer than a scarf
>your hands rested on his legs and he didn't protest this time
>while it threw off your balance a little he wasn't really that heavy 
>you both held on tight as you leapt for the first platform 
>your boots landed hard and you recovered quickly
>he squeaked into your ear as you leapt and landed on another platform
>the stones must have been some old bridge
>it was holding up well to every jump
>you managed a few more leaps
>the last jump you nearly missed but Ashley shoved himself forward, giving the momentum to stick it
>he had tightly clutched your neck in a panic
>his legs wrapped around you
>you breathed a sigh of relief and gently set your passenger down
>he withdrew and you noticed he was having to readjust his skirt again
>you paid no mind to the tent he was fighting down
>guys will be guys 
>you got erections at weird times too
>muttering above you in Spanish made you freeze for a second before hugging the wall
>Ashley was surprised when you pulled him towards your chest
>your left hand held the back of his head and the other held his lower back
>poor thing must have been scared because he shivered in your embrace
>you were aware of his erection because it poked against your hip
>he really chose a bad time for it but you'd have to make do
>at least he suppressed any noises but you had his face against your chest for a reason
>occasionally he jostled against you and let out a low noise
>he had to be uncomfortable but until the cultists walked away from the ledge he'd need to stay close
>his arms held onto you though
>not in a panic or anything
>at least he was trusting you now
>when the voices got distant you finally relaxed and released Ash
>he seemed flustered for some reason
>well it was better than the screaming 
>he whispered to you and asked if you'd seen a restroom while running through the castle
>you hadn't 
>it was a weird time for a bathroom emergency 
>he'd have to hold it for now
>at least until you had privacy
>you asked if he'd want to get caught with his pants down
>er, skirt
>that somehow got him more flustered 
>he was weird
>regardless, you both pressed on through the castle
>after the rough start on your journey he was starting to get it
>it wasn't like having a combat buddy but he at least was trying to be helpful now
>even offered to carry ammo and medical supplies
>it was good to have a bigger inventory 
>when you got to your merchant friend he practically lit up
>how the merchant got in here you didn't know but it was a blessing
>you had to gently let down Ash because no, he was not getting a rocket launcher to help you with
>the enthusiasm was appreciated but he hadn't even used a pistol yet
>afterwards the rest of the castle was a breeze
>the usual assortment of cultist swarms, puzzles, giant statue encounters and BOWs you'd come to expect
>amazingly, Ash continued to grow in usefulness and seemed to get braver as you two forged ahead
>maybe not quite ready for a rocket launcher but maybe you'd toss him one of your dinky pistols
>the last encounter with Salazar nearly turned your stomach
>you'd had Ash hide nearby in a crawlspace
>this big fights were still something you didn't want him part of
>after sniping the little napoleon looking weird with what felt like all your rifle ammo he went down
>you both could leave now that your gracious host was a bubbling pile of ooze
>you went back and saw Ash peak out of his hidey hole
>when you offered a hand up he looked at it wide eyed before taking it
>"why are you being this nice? I got you into this."
>this wasn't your idea of a vacation but these guys needed to be stopped
>there was always another Umbrella or another Birkin
>so it worked out
>plus you would have went out of your way to help anyone in this
>you told him to make sure to buy you a beer when this was all said and done
>then you'd be even
>he looked a little bashful so you reassured him by clasping your arm around his shoulder
>you brushed his hair out of his eyes and said you promised and you meant it
>you laughed when he said he needed a bathroom break after all the excitement
>at least you calmed him down
>you said you'd find a spot and scout it out beforehand 
>that way he'd be safe
>you said you had a surprise after and that perked him up
>you saw the castle chambers led into a cave and you were unsure what that would bring 
>couldn't go back out into the village with the numbers they had
>so it looked like the only answer was to go deeper with Ashley
>you found an alcove in the caves and made sure, very sure there wasn't some Scooby-Doo secret door shit
>he looked grateful as he ran in when you gave him the all clear
>you were both guys so you'd just stand outside the gap and keep watch the other way
>he almost objected but you weren't letting him get kidnapped again
>the alcove was about seven feet into the cave, that would be enough privacy
>Ash just had to give a signal he was done and you'd both be on your way
>he finally agreed once he got you to promise to only keep look out, he needed his privacy
>practically had to swear on a Bible
>keeping watch was the calmest time you'd had in a while
>for you
>Ash on the other hand
>well Ash had gotten you to promise not to watch him
>on the other hand he watched you
>the second the coast was clear for him he flipped up his skirt
>he had spent a good portion of the day rock hard about you
>ever since getting shoved nose first into your crotch and all the manhandling
>he'd thought you were handsome before but after seeing you in action and being treated like that…
>well he was crushing hard on you
>and even after he found out you'd lied
>you'd wanted to help
>he muffled his moans with his tail as his blue eyes studied you like dinner
>his hand furiously pumped his red cock, it's angry color contrasting with the white fur around it
>he'd been leaking precum ever since you'd shouldered him and he definitely needed new panties after this
>his brother had bragged about adventure but Ash never considered romance 
>his legs were shaky as he just kept watching you and he balanced himself with his other hand
>fantasies filled his mind
>your breath on his chest as you moved to attack a vulnerable pink nipple with your teeth
>you pulling his hair as you drove your manhood deeper than his fingers could reach
>he imagined how much better your crotch smelled with the pants off
>how tight you could grip the base of his tail as a handle
>you were every inch his hero and you came in and swept him off his feet
>you needed a steed but Ash would have been fine with you mounting him instead
>he wanted to give you your reward
>he knew it was dumb to do it here
>this was all dumb
>but he craved you to look over your shoulder, to see him with his panties down and desperate
>but he didn't want to force it, to bring the attention to himself
>he needed you to want him like that
>he dreamed of that big fat cock you must have and how you could stuff it in him
>he yearned for you to just grab him and bent him over the closest thing and just use him
>mentally he was wondering what he'd call you while he rode that big human cock
>would you growl how much you loved him as you emptied a load in him
>would you bring him along everywhere from then on
>Ash knew how dangerous everything was now and this made him swear to himself
>if you got them through this safe and sound
>he was practically your property 
>the way you handled yourself just fighting all these monsters, it was a thrill
>not the adventure his brother had told Ash years back
>something more primal
>the mouse boy knew he swung of the male team but there wasn't a guy like you before
>he wasn't a whore throwing his ass wherever 
>you were special
>he stared hard at your back while he arched his and shot cum across the alcove 
>he almost collapsed but caught himself
>his heart rate eased down and he could think again
>and he all of a sudden felt embarrassed and quickly covered back up
>a soft voice from behind you cleared his throat
>"I'm all, um, finished. sorry."
>well the break was nice at least
>you turned and there he was looking skittish
>you smiled and said no problem then remembered what you said earlier, the epiphany reading over your face openly
>then you could tell he remembered the surprise and his giant ears perked up
>when you went to pull off your belt his eyes shot wide
>"w-what? what are you doing?!?"
>he squeaked out in a whisper and started to panic for some reason
>you told him to relax, it was part of the surprise
>that seemed to make him more fidgety and he really didn't want to make eye contact
>just a stuttering mess now
>strange
>he froze and slowly looked up when you pressed him back to the cave wall with a hand on his slender shoulder
>then you handed him the belt and holster for your sidearm
>you felt you could trust him with a pistol, perhaps you were too rash earlier to keep him unarmed
>you didn't expect him to almost faint in response, it couldn't be that exciting

>he seemed to calm down after a minute or two
>you didn't have a lot of time so you asked if he knew anything about guns
>he silently shook his head
>you were afraid of that
>so crash course in gun safety and all that
>point it down, trigger discipline and all that
>you figured the cultists not wanting to hurt such a high value target would given Ash an edge
>you asked him to stance up, show you how he thinks he should shoot
>last thing you'd need was him flying backwards from recoil
>the pistol looked gigantic in his hands
>when he trembled you felt bad
>he didn't know his little adventure would turn into this
>you took a little pity on him
>you moved behind him and wrapped your arms around him, your hands over his
>he was still shaking so you planted a leg between his
>you didn't exactly tower over him but you could see over his hair and between his big ears
>you instructed him to take deep steady breaths to ready himself
>he was never trained for any of this so getting him calm was the first step
>then you told him to spread his legs more and he nearly jumped for some reason
>you dodged his tail as he nearly jettisoned himself to the ceiling
>however, he soon understood the purpose of the wider stance was to help balance
>after you explained you weren't a "pervert"
>no idea why he thought firearm training was perverted
>after about twenty minutes you were happy he at least got some basics
>he could at least cap those guys hauling him up over their shoulders now
>what you didn't know was how quickly that training would be put to use
>the parasites had done some weird shit so far but it seemed like the cult had been toying with them
>trying to make them even more dangerous
>and you two ran into that in the castle caverns a bit past your break spot
>the creatures that jumped you both looked like giant bugs
>you were starting to get deja vu from all the crap you dealt with in Raccoon City 
>things looked absolutely alien and you discovered quickly they could cloak
>Ashley spotted them first
>because while you couldn't see them all that well, he could hear them
>they shimmered slightly in the light
>taking flight must exert them too much for the camouflage however and that made them easy to shoot
>sure they were nimble in the air but they were visible 
>shotgun made all their weaving worthless because you were sure to clip something 
>one of them got lucky and grabbed Ashley
>you panicked at seeing the mouse up in the air 
>this wasn't happening again
>getting separated like before
>you didn't have time to scream out before Ashley did a very smart/dumb thing
>you were happy to see the gift had paid off
>Ash fumbled with the gun but got it right up to the bug's mouth and mag dumped the thing's brains out
>what was dumb and not so much a relief was Ashley was twenty feet in the air and over a pit
>you ran hard as you could, slid towards the edge, and got hold of something solid
>the bug plummeted and you quickly realized you were looking down Ash's skirt and your hand had his tail 
>the mouse nearly screamed at the tugging and your arm nearly came out of its socket but he was safe
>displaying an inhuman flexibility and agility he just about doubled over and grabbed your shoulder
>it hurt but he managed to scamper up you and to your surprise kill one of those bugs that spotted an easy target
>he'd even used your pistol to do it, pulling it while he had been climbing up
>you'd both had enough of the caves after just a few minutes and sprinted towards an obvious exit
>Ashley continued to spot for you, the hearing making ambushes impossible
>he wasn't even panicked or screaming now
>if he was afraid he didn't let it show as outwardly as before
>maybe actually killing one of those things made him see it wasn't as impossible as he thought
>a few service tunnels and gunfights with the bugs you managed to get out of there
>with Ashley in tow as well
>you took time to slap his shoulder and say you were proud of him in there
>his response was to look everywhere but you and say he was thinking of another bathroom break
>it did get pretty scary in there but that was sudden
>it seemed like the caves led into a mine system
>you'd have to find a way to the surface and you heard more guttural Spanish ahead
>the mines were indeed stuffed to the rafters with villagers that really wanted hurl dynamite
>Ashley had to cover his ears a lot
>the gunfire had been difficult for him but an explosion in an enclosed space must have been hell
>then they got creative
>Ashley and you dodged in different directions from one such explosion 
>the mouse ended up in a tunnel that was weaker 
>another blast and the shit started caving in
>you weren't fast enough to rush for it but he was darting away from the collapse 
>you were shocked for a second, staring at the blocked off cave
>then you were pissed
>you blew the head off the one villager that threw the last stick
>fucking dynamite 
>at least the stick he had just lit took out a group of them 
>but now you had an issue 
>do you pick Ashley or your route through the mines?
>Ashley tried clawing at the rocks and was greeted with more falling into their place
>he wasn't built for strenuous digging and ended up giving up after a few frantic minutes
>he fell back against the rock wall and processed what to do 
>he heard a few more gunshots and explosions and hoped you were alright
>now, he could stay here and hope you could dig out the rock
>or head deeper and hope you two could meet
>the rocks could take hours to clear and neither of you had that sort of time
>so the tunnel it had to be
>Ash just hoped he could circle around in time
>the pistol would be a last resort if he couldn't sneak
>checking ammo, he reloaded like you taught him
>a little clumsy but he managed
>the quiet of the caverns didn't help relax him and he fiddled with the pistol 
>his ears focused and he slunk out into the mine tunnel, torchlight bathing everything in hostile reds
>his boots were ruined by now, mentally he wondered if you two could go shopping after this
>a beach 
>after all this
>definitely going to a beach
>Ash would get a swimsuit
>something barely covering anything
>that was the ticket 
>that would definitely draw your eye
>maybe something low cut
>just enough ass cleavage that wouldn't get you two kicked off a public beach
>what color would best work with his white fur
>he distracted himself with happy thoughts while listening for danger
>the mines in this section had been quiet so far but Ash didn't doubt they wouldn't go for him now
>since you had been separated from him, he was vulnerable 
>or so they believed 
>had to get out of this
>warm ocean water glistening off your skin
>Ashley was living for tomorrow now
>he just had to pray you upheld your part of the bargain 
>you were pulling off his bikini top with your teeth and he wasn't accepting anything less
>slipping through the tunnels was easier than he expected but he was still careful
>occasionally gunfire echoed through the tunnels and he took that as a good sign
>sure, you were fighting but that meant you were alive
>plus you seemed to be moving as well so he had made the right call
>when he heard some shuffling up ahead he was cautious 
>his footsteps grew soft
>sneaking was natural for him
>sunny beach
>just think sunny beach
>Ashley calmed his breathing and went over your firearms training 
>it was brief but it was the closest thing to a security blanket he had now
>this was definitely all the adventure his brother had seen and more
>he wasn't sure he was cut out for that sort of life though
>the glamor had faded 
>now he just had to survive and hope you reciprocate his feelings
>he'd just have to like, seduce you
>somehow
>he really had no idea how to actually do that but that was a bridge he'd cross when he got to it
>more gunfire and footsteps shuffled away from where he crouched
>they were obviously heading off to deal with the intruder, you
>that was good news
>well, not for you
>but it meant he was getting closer to you
>he checked his pistol briefly and crawled forward
>the caverns smelled of mildew and grime
>that part stuck out to him a lot
>the villagers didn't ever seem to stand out too much from their surroundings any more
>you smelled nice to him though
>he thought about that
>at least tracking you might be easy
>then you two would get rid of these bugs and get away from this God forsaken place
>his tail slightly bobbed behind him to give him better balance crouched
>the skirt at helped him be flexible too
>truly the most tactical invention
>the fake boobs were annoying though
>but impersonating a celebrity for the fame and possibly getting into nightclubs seemed like it was worth it
>no one really asked about the giant mouse thing
>and he wasn't about to correct them
>everyone just assumed 
>maybe this Ashley was just kind of homely looking enough he could pass for her
>celebrities were weird and he was more than happy to use that to his advantage 
>at least that was what he assumed
>as for why he never impersonated a male celebrity?
>he liked skirts, so what was the big deal
>this whole wanderlust had led him into a dangerous spot and he thought back
>if you hadn't rescued him
>he'd be a slave to this cult
>he was in love almost at that corny cheese joke
>you noticed he was a mouse or were at least bold enough to say it out loud
>he also took note
>you didn't exactly reject that kiss
>even kissed back
>you didn't think he looked super weird or ugly 
>so there was hope
>he held onto that hope until he found an area with a minecart
>it led down some rickety wooden tracks
>death trap in the making
>however gunfire below the ledge made him peak over
>there you were about thirty feet down
>he eyed the mine cart that would head down to that level
>it was a risk
>jumping would be fatal
>Ash hyped himself up
>it was just like one of those roller coasters
>just hop in a roll down
>but the brakes 
>that's the issue
>could he stop it?
>he saw you were backed into a corner and threw caution to the wind
>hopefully you'd give him a reward for his daring rescue
>that last thought made Ashley perk up
>reward
>yes
>you were pinned behind cover and didn't expect to see a cart flying down the track near you
>you almost opened fire when you saw familiar boots poking up from the cart, moving around in a panic
>the villagers had no time to react before the cart blasted through their group and slammed through several trusses 
>the cart had smashed a few of them but those that were distracted were quickly gunned down
>you felt amazingly lucky for the opportunity 
>Ash had come through and created an opening
>you rushed over and saw he was dazed but no worse for wear
>Spanish behind you made you pick him up out of the cart bridal style and start running 
>these tunnels had to have another opening
>hopefully better than this place
>though judging by the track record probably not
>still, these tunnels were a labyrinth made to waste your time
>getting you both bug free was a priority 
>you had a feeling taking out Salazar early did some damage to the group at least
>the distressing amount of mutations this cult was making didn't ease your fears
>they had to be stopped more than ever
>bugs first though
>Luis had remarked on research about them
>so maybe they had a way to destroy the infestation
>Ash had appeared to recover
>you asked if he wanted to walk it off 
>"we lost them right?"
>sure enough the noises were distant 
>they wouldn't be able to catch up
>you told him you felt like you lost them
>"well in that case, can you carry me a little longer?"
>strange but maybe he felt woozy still
>he draped his arms around you and relaxed in your arms as you trudged through the mines towards what looked like open space
>what was initially disappointment turned to horror
>the glow of the room was due to what looked like a lava pit
>Ashley was already looking uncomfortable in the heat
>he got down and shielded himself behind you
>was he smelling you?
>well that wasn't the important thing because you were greeted by a familiar sight
>two of them
>you'd fought one of those troll giants before in the village outskirts
>but now two of the monsters strode out of a giant doorway on the other side of the room
>Ashley choked back a scream
>you could tell by how he was holding your shoulders he was tensed up
>you couldn't lie and say you weren't also scared 
>they made the mistake of using this room though
>you saw the precarious condition the pit was in
>and it was big enough for one of these things to fall into
>you knew from fighting the one they weren't graceful
>maybe you could have them trip over each other
>you doubted you'd get lucky enough to get both of them
>the mouse boy was nervous
>you clasped a hand over one of his soft ones and told him you needed him to keep it together 
>these things would probably be too dumb to know not to hurt him
>so you'd serve as a distraction and pointed to the apparatus over head
>a few good shots and it would bring down the platform into the lava
>you would plan to be off the platform
>you promised
>he still sounded scared but you needed to trust him
>you would get you both out of here so you added incentive
>if you both got out of this fight you'd do whatever he asked
>give him whatever he'd like
>no objections
>that seemed to calm him instantly somehow
>you'd break on three
>one
>your body felt like a coiled sping
>two
>sweat formed on your brow and the beasts got closer
>three
>you darted forward to catch their eye and Ashley slunk backwards, making no sudden moves
>they were dumb and uncoordinated 
>thankfully that worked in your favor
>piss off one and he swings a club without thinking of the other one
>it was easy to get them to pay attention to just you
>especially when you'd switched to your magnum
>you'd thought about a shotgun but fuck getting within arms reach of these things
>Ashley had made himself scarce and the plan was working
>you'd were getting exhausted dodging the blows but a single hit would kill you
>you couldn't chance getting hit
>one of the idiots charged and made a beeline for the platform 
>you dodged another clumsy swing and peppered a few shots at the other freak to get him to close in
>you were getting nervous about getting boxed in but you had to trust Ashley
>he'd come through
>you knew it
>sure enough Ash had the time to steady up and take aim
>ignoring the urges you telling him to spread his legs had put in him
>every piece of that lesson but that one part
>he was hoping you weren't just exaggerating about that reward because he was looking forward to it
>the first shot didn't hit the chain 
>the second didn't either
>however, third time's the charm
>the chain suspended that whole platform and if it went
>he hoped you didn't make a mistake trusting him
>you heard the gunshots 
>the giants seemed too caught up in attacking you
>you didn't make it obvious you glanced up 
>you saw a shot hit, sparks flying
>Ashley quickly emptied the rest of the gun on the links
>more misses than hits but it did it
>the second giant charged onto the platform and you felt it waver
>you decided to risk it and baited one of them into slamming his club down
>idiot fell for it
>they both just assumed you were dodging but you'd leapt clear of the pad as it dropped from the hit
>both of them fell into the lava but not without a fight
>one of them clawed at you while bellowing and there was a real fear fucking lava couldn't stop these things
>you backed off while training your sight on it
>you weren't shy about shooting a couple more times
>the bullets finally seemed to hit home and actually do something because the beast finally went slack and fell into the red heat
>you weren't sure how durable those things were so you stayed away from the pit and made your way towards Ashley 
>he seemed a little distraught 
>you asked what was wrong?
>was he OK?
>"it's just… I couldn't make the shot. even with you counting on me"
>the mouse boy looked to his boots and slumped against the wall of the cave
>you decided he had the right idea
>you sat next to him and he quietly nudged a rock
>you felt like he needed a boost
>you remarked he had weakened the chains
>it wasn't perfect but you to made do
>isn't that what life was about?
>you two still managed to kill the giants
>you were both alive and that's what mattered
>that seemed to help a little so you added the cherry on top of the sundae
>you get to name your reward, you know
>the ears twitched
>you saw it
>"but I don't think I deserve it…"
>you were both sitting here alive because of his actions
>so he could name his price
>he thought about it in silence 
>"are you sure?"
>positive 
>"really?"
>you offered and you'd pay him back
>he probably wanted money or another vacation or something
>"welp, fuck it."
>you were confused what that meant then he quickly straddled you and wrapped his arms around your shoulders
>"I'm not dying a virgin," he whispered desperately to you
>"you almost died so many times and…"
>he frantically pulled his top up and pitched the bra staffers over his head
>his bravery seemed to fade briefly before he found his resolve
>his hand grabbed yours and he placed it on his bare chest
>his white fur was like silk
>smooth to your fingertips but he wanted you hand flat over a specific spot
>"I know. I know."
>he was pleading when he looked down at you with his blue eyes
>"you're straight or have a girlfriend or whatever and I'm stupid"
>he started to look more and more crestfallen as you tried to figure out how to react
>"but I… can't let this go."
>you realized he wanted you to feel his heart and it raced
>hammered harder than yours did when you just fought out there
>he was so scared
>the stress was getting to him and you figure that had to have taken a lot from him
>so your hand went to undo his black bra
>you gently set it aside and agreed
>this wasn't the ideal place for a thing but you knew he was so terrified
>nowhere was really safe so this was as good a place as any
>you were sort of in new territory here
>but you figured he'd feel bad if you just kind of sat there
>so fine
>you promised 
>you didn't want to leave it unfulfilled 
>so you mirrored him and pulled your shirt off
>that seemed to perk him up
>he ran his paw over your chest in appreciation 
>the pads were soft on your skin
>you allowed him to work at his pace but there was something you wanted to try
>he flinched when you reached up and rubbed his ear
>you'd be curious this whole time what it felt like
>he was confused
>then leaned into it
>"I think I'm going to make you regret that promise"
>he looked somewhat nervous
>you'd never been with a guy before 
>really this was about the farthest you've gotten with anyone
>Ada was kind of a tease but you were probably in a worse situation than this
>Ashley here wasn't a tease given how he arched against you
>you'd have to fix something
>was Ash his real name?
>"I know it sounds silly but yeah. why?"
>well you wanted to make sure you groaned out the right name 
>none of that president's daughter nonsense 
>you felt how tense his back was as your hand went further down
>his fur really was a pleasure to touch
>"we-we don't have to do this."
>he tried to get up off you and your hand clamped over one of his thighs
>he squeaked, actually squeaked and then he gulped down his anxiety for a moment 
>he seriously thought he was forcing himself on you
>you ran your hand up his skirt and if you weren't in a lava cave you could have felt his body burning up
>he buried his face in his hands when you flipped the cloth up, exposing him
>he was rock hard and leaking
>so he really did want this
>his cock angrily throbbed and wasn't at all contained in his panties
>he didn't try to make eye contact whatsoever
>"I'm sorry."
>his anxiety was obvious by now
>did he like you?
>you had to admit, he was alright
>he had pretty soft hips
>you patted his thigh gingerly and he whined and wiggled in your lap
>so he must really enjoy your company
>that was good
>you enjoyed his company too
>so you decided best to go with it
>you had no idea how to go about this
>killing all that shit past you and you were freezing up at feeling up a mouse
>best you could do is lay on the charm
>think back to like movies
>so he was girly
>might mean he likes what women like
>your hand ran over his back down to his tail and he froze
>his eye peaked through his fingers down into your own eyes
>when you softly gripped his tail at the base he jerked his hips 
>you used your free hand to undo your pants 
>or attempt to
>trying to do it one hand was difficult and but Ash helped
>he seemed briefly impatient and almost shredded your pants with his tiny claws just to get your pants down
>tugging softly on his smooth tail seemed to interrupt his thought processes 
>his manhood twitched in his panties 
>your own flopped out the second your pants opened
>it was hard too and his blue eyes were drawn to it
>it strained hard against the boxer briefs 
>he gulped again
>"I can't believe this is happening," he murmured
>his small paws shakily groped at your manhood and you groaned at the sensation
>he froze and you assured him he was doing fine
>his paw pads felt so strange when he got bold
>he watched you for every little reaction
>"you're really sure about this. I'm not… weird?"
>he worried too much
>so you pulled him down into a kiss
>your tongue explored his mouth and he finally relaxed
>you both let your guard down and that was a mistake
>things got hazy after
>you tasted him on your lips
>he was sweet
>that was your last memory before you blacked out
>then it felt like you were in the backseat of your own body
>you were seeing things through your eyes but you didn't have control
>the kiss turned hostile
>you weren't kissing Ash
>he was shocked when you broke the kiss and you got violent
>you saw your body grab the mouse boy by the throat
>your fingers on his neck
>he had noticed something when he saw your eyes and he started flailing
>you were trying your damndest to break the hold 
>this had to be the bugs
>you couldn't let this happen
>he kicked and tried breaking free but your hand had him 
>he tried struggling and you couldn't stop it
>it felt impossible until he finally got enough breath to speak two words
>"you promised"
>that gave you the strength to wrest control back
>these goddamn bugs weren't winning
>they weren't making you a fucking liar 
>and they
>weren't 
>hurting
>Ash
>your screamed that last word to the cavern and unclutched his throat
>the parasite control had faded for the moment
>the mouse boy gasped for air on the ground and when he locked eyes with you he flinched
>it was brief but you saw he was scared
>you said you were sorry 
>while you expected him to stay frightened he picked himself up
>with his breath back he offered you a paw
>you pulled him into a hug and said you were sorry again
>then you noticed a few things
>your pants had were still down and he had a wet spot up against you
>did he just cum from earlier?
>he noticed you noticing and piped up, trying to preserve the dignity of the moment
>his soft heartbeat had slowed against your chest, any hard feelings just nonexistent 
>"I pulled a gun on you, remember?" 
>he had, you knew he wasn't in control
>"so, no sorrys. we should deal with the parasites. this was selfish…"
>you bluntly replied
>you promised you'd save him and you promised you'd take his virginity
>you too had too much to live for so you couldn't fail
>though something did trouble you
>if the parasite could have a hive mind, they just discovered Ash wasn't "their" Ash
>his cover was blown and it would get a lot more deadly from here on out
>he embraced you and buried his head against your chest
>"we'll be ok."
>the danger had made your dick soft and you had suspicions Ash came
>somehow
>you were too much of a gentleman to ask him outright
>you let him break the embrace first 
>since they knew now, you pointed out he probably didn't need the citrus now
>you saw him get bashful when you said he looked better without the fake boobs
>he still covered his chest like a girl would
>you'd get you both out of here
>no, you both would do this
>you both got dressed and you could tell he was still troubled
>you hooked an arm around his shoulder and tried the most sauve line you could think of
>you offered to kiss his neck to make it better and he just about fell over
>he seemed to forgive you for that earlier incident but you didn't forgive yourself 
>you weren't in control but it still traumatized you
>this time he could pick up on that
>"I could have shot you," he muttered 
>his blue eyes were cast towards the lava pit 
>then he glanced over to you
>"I didn't."
>you didn't know what that meant and he didn't elaborate 
>he was right though
>you'd given him the gun and he could have defended himself
>surprisingly, he was the one to usher you two out
>not exactly taking the lead but he was a bit more assertive
>it was a few more tunnels before you found something amazing
>an elevator
>this was it
>you'd be heading up for the first time in hours
>when you smelled fresh air for the first time you grabbed Ash and spun him
>he panicked and insisted you put him down in the most embarrassed tone
>the salt water in the air never smelled so good

>to you astonishment no one heard the elevator
>you had the beach to yourselves for a little bit
>you sat down on the sand and patted the spot next to you
>you'd take the peace and quiet as an opportunity 
>you took stock of your ammo and supplies
>there looked to be an organized camp in the distance 
>more of a fort
>that had to be the main headquarters of the organization 
>no need to run out of ammo now
>Ash rearranged his skirt after sitting down near the sand
>he looked wistfully out to the water lapping at the shore
>"promise me, if we get out of this, a beach."
>a beach?
>"yeah"
>he rested his muzzle on his paw and just stared out to the dark waves
>well if you all got out of this you would take him to the beach
>though you didn't know why he was all concerned about one 
>it would be nice to get away
>a voice behind you interrupted your thoughts and made Ash dive for your lap
>instantly you knew who it was clearing her throat 
>you'd run into Ada earlier before meeting Ash here
>you had no idea what the woman wanted but you doubted it was good
>you patted at Ashley to get off
>it was OK
>for now
>Ada played off the whole Catwoman thing and you couldn't say you were in the greatest mood
>so you got up and asked what she wanted
>it was blunt and to the point
>you didn't exactly have time for riddles 
>Ash sort of cowered a little behind you, clearly not trusting the stranger
>Ada eyed your companion and then shocked you
>"is… that a mouse?"
>there was genuine confusion in her voice
>and Ash gripped your shoulder tighter
>they were reading each other a little and you felt Ash loosen up behind you
>were they sizing each other up?
>that's what it felt like

>Ash watched Ada intently over your shoulder
>you felt like you were in the middle of something you shouldn't be in
>yet there was something you couldn't stop focusing on
>Ada saw a mouse
>Ash was a mouse
>therefore, you hadn't gone mental from stress or something
>it made you so goddamn relieved 
>you had to confirm
>what did Ada mean by mouse?
>"you have a giant white mouse behind you?"
>she did have a point
>Ash's ivory fur shined in the moonlight 
>you glimpsed over your shoulder and saw he was boring a hole through Ada with his eyes
>Ada watched you and Ash with a skeptical, yet bemused look
>"you two, you know?"
>Ash hid back behind you
>you know what?
>you were a little lost
>when Ada walked closer Ash surprised you
>he went from hiding behind you to now in front of you
>his arm over your chest and he was watching Ada
>that seemed to be enough of a reaction for the agent
>she had a small grin
>"it's true"
>she shrugged 
>"guess I lost, right?"
>lost?
>none of this was making sense
>she seemed to watch Ash warily
>"you have your rabies shot?"
>Ash straightened up and scowled
>there was clearly more at play here than you figured
>but this wasn't important at the moment
>you asked why Ada popped up 
>turns out she had information that you'd want
>the research labs
>they had them under this compound
>labs that could remove the plagas
>now that was useful
>you thanked her but Ash seemed hesitant 
>"she's not like a BOW you just found, is she?"
>wait was he?
>you felt rude asking
>you don't just ask someone if they're a bioweapon 
>Ash surprisingly, took initiative and took you by the waist and herded you both towards the fort
>"thank you, bye."
>the mouse boy hustled you along away from the familiar stranger

>Ash was concerned about the parasites, no doubt
>you waved off to Ada and tied to plan out how you'd get into the base
>with the clue Ada provided you remained hopeful 
>you could get rid of these plagas
>but getting into the place…
>you saw the searchlights 
>and the armed guards
>that was a lot of guns
>it was bad enough when they had pitchforks
>thankfully your old friend the merchant was waiting nearby
>or were there multiple merchants
>hard to figure out
>guns made all the deeper thoughts not matter
>there were too many for a frontal assault 
>so you eyed a new sniper rifle
>your old one had gotten you far but this one fired faster
>you also got a new submachine gun
>two actually 
>and an armful of ammo
>the mines were profitable and the merchant was happy as could be
>Ash was shocked when you handed him the submachine gun
>it was something easy to hip fire and he could use it no problem 
>a frontal assault wasn't ideal but it was quickly looking like the best way
>you went over how it should go and Ash hung on your every word
>you used the rifle to clear the towers at a distance
>meanwhile, Ash had used your stockpile of claymores to create a perimeter around your position
>the group was slow to react but you wanted them to come to you
>instead of charging the fort you were forcing them to come out or take cover
>they needed to take the towers to fire at you and you were popping every idiot that climbed up
>you would think they'd learn but no
>so they took the other option
>Ash had retreated to your position and you got your first surprise in a chain gunner waddling out of the gates
>the heavy gun revved and you pulled Ash down behind cover
>it was already shredding your position so you gestured him to fall back with you
>those mines finally came in handy and several of the attackers were blown backwards by the traps
>it wasn't enough to deter the chain gunner though, he kept hammering above you
>getting hit by that would chop you in half and you couldn't get line of sight without exposing yourself
>you did however, thumb the ring of a flashbang grenade
>you heaved it over the cover and towards the remains of the group
>when it went off you popped up and aimed your magnum
>you had to go overkill for this
>the gunner was too stunned to recover after you put 6 bullets in center mass 
>Ash felt reckless and popped up next to you and sprayed the group with the new gift you gave him
>that seemed to do it and you breathed a sigh of relief 
>no doubt there would be more but you'd cleared a path for now
>you both snuck into the fort through the open door now, collecting ammo along the way
>Ash tried to grab the chain gun like a kleptomaniac but was quickly pulled down to earth by its weight and gave up

>you two had cleared out the top facility judging by the silence 
>both of you still snuck around just in case
>no reason to present an easy target
>you looted the outbuildings and got more supplies
>the distinct lack of Spanish chatter put you at ease for now
>Ash huddled close to you
>the company was welcome
>more than once he ran square into your back when you suddenly stopped 
>a hushed silence hung over the camp after your ears had stopped ringing
>someone below had to have heard all the explosions and gunfire
>perhaps they had laid out a trap for you?
>you needed to get in though
>the prospect of the removing the parasites made it essential
>there was a chance of an ambush
>but you had no choice
>either that or let the bugs win
>and you liked having your body
>so you grabbed your new submachine gun and decided you'd mow down the hallways and make a beeline for whatever they had as a lab
>Ada was not exactly trustworthy but she wouldn't lie about this
>you were still amazed she realized Ash was a giant mouse
>BOW was a bit off the mark though
>the mouse boy wasn't exactly a Tyrant
>however, he was trustworthy 
>despite the weirdness that surrounded this whole situation he'd been dependable 
>you'd definitely take him to the range if you got out of this though
>but at least you had a second opinion that confirmed you weren't hallucinating 
>so that was a relief 
>now you just had the countless rooms of armed goons to worry about
>at least you weren't doing it alone
>you got on one side of a set of double doors
>Ash on the opposite side
>a small window let you peek in just enough to see some more guys
>you readied your gun and he did likewise
>on the count of 3 you kicked open the door and cut through 5 defenders like a scythe 
>Ash had trouble holding the gun down from the kickback but the enthusiasm was appreciated 
>more ammo and you went deeper
>Ash nearly rushed ahead of you but you grabbed him and pulled him back by the tail
>he had to stifle a weird noise he involuntarily made in reaction
>you would have to teach him to not just run around corners, hurry or not
>what astounded you was in your investigation you ran into another familiar face
>Luis was snooping around some little jury rigged lab and you were relieved to see someone else in here that wasn't hostile

>Luis showed no signs of infection still so you felt he could be trusted
>from your brief encounters he seemed to just want out as much as you
>you asked if he'd seen some sort of equipment for removing the bugs
>the Spaniard grinned and you could tell he had an answer
>sure enough
>"a little deeper in the facility is what you're looking for"
>he briefly went over the procedure and it seemed easy enough
>you had to ask how he knew and he wasn't forthcoming with that answer
>yet, that wasn't the important part
>you needed in there 
>he gave you a word of caution 
>"there's some experiments buried deep down there. I'm sure you two have seen some of the odder stuff running around?"
>sure but it couldn't be much worse
>stuff like Birkin was old hat to you now
>"just saying, keep an eye out. it gets worse down there."
>that had you a little worried
>again, how he knew this was a mystery 
>but you'd heed the advice 
>the rest of the trip was quiet
>too quiet for your liking
>then you heard ragged wet breathing behind one of the doors
>you had to peek and what you saw made you flinch
>it looked human
>stood like a human
>completely naked and it twitched every so often
>it was just unnatural 
>just a sort of uncanny thing to look at for long
>sneaking past it in the narrow hallway seemed unwise
>this had to be what Luis warned you about
>one of their weird experiments like the bugs
>you would take no chances
>magnum ammo was rare and expensive but it helped with trouble before
>it didn't react when you cracked open the door
>you glanced over to Ash while you lined up the sight
>he had clung behind you, his tiny claws almost like a kitten's against your shirt
>when you fired the first shot it slumped forward a little, then turned
>it was hard to look at but you kept shooting
>the hits registered but it didn't seem to do much more than waver briefly
>this was why there were no guards down here
>you weren't about to let it get close
>for how durable it was it seemed to trade that for speed
>it slowly walked forward and you had to pull back
>Ash was with you the whole way
>occasionally you fired your pistols and it seemed to have no effect like the magnum

>this thing seemed to regenerate from wounds
>buckshot seemed to have the same effect
>it shrugged off having an arm blown off
>even seemed to be growing back
>Ash freaked out and you couldn't lie and say you weren't with him there
>Ash emptied another magazine and something happened
>his shots must have nailed something in the creature because it actually reacted to that
>you lined up the shotgun and hit the same spot before it healed completely
>that put it down for a minute
>it wasn't out but it did do something
>probably popped something inside it
>whatever the parasite shit was doing you'd severed part of it
>so it probably had more targets
>what followed was Ash would spray and pray and then you'd watch
>right shoulder
>another wound that stuck
>buckshot
>fall back
>you two would be running out of room soon
>hopefully, it wouldn't have many more of these things
>Ash was getting better with the gun and two more magazines found another target and you ran in and shot it there
>it frantically reached out for you, spikes growing all over its body
>but it was death throes as it's last lifeline was severed
>you'd won but all that ammo you'd just bought was damn near gone
>Ash leaned against you and sighed
>"there's probably more of those things," he muttered 
>you figured he was right
>you wanted him to be wrong but that's not how this worked
>if they made one of these things they'd mass produce them
>Raccoon City taught you that
>what you wanted had to be past that thing though
>so you headed back down, far more carefully
>searching room to room turned up some supplies
>even a scope that let's you x ray anyone
>which would have been real great for that regenerator 
>but if there were more you'd be better off
>zooming the scope on Ash made him slap it away in embarrassment 
>you had to explain it wasn't that kind of x ray sight when he accused you of looking at him without clothes on
>then he got flustered when you asked why he was worried because you'd seen him without clothes on before
>the search continued

>one more regenerator
>now that you knew the trick to them it was easier
>not easy, just easier
>after clearing a few more rooms you finally found exactly what you were looking for
>Luis had been sort of right
>it looked like the device would put the plagas down for a time but not completely kill them 
>maybe
>you were scared to hit this device full blast on either of you
>Ash looked down but you patted him on the back
>between this machine and the medicine down here you could put off the eggs growing
>given how their hive mind seemed to work you'd just have to kill the head bug and everything would work out after
>no signal to hatch would mean the eggs could be safely cut out after
>at least that's what some of these notes seemed to point to
>it didn't look good 
>you were initially worried about the device
>radiation wasn't exactly your expertise 
>Ash spoke up
>"I'll go first, then we'll know it's safe. just do what you have to get the bugs out. I'll be ok."
>you raised doubts
>these notes were unsure if it would be the be all and never went past a certain threshold 
>Ash looked towards his boots
>"you promised we'd get out of this."
>he was scared and you couldn't blame him
>you offered to go first in his place and he refused
>"you risked your life enough for me. now let me do that for you. hopefully this just gets rid of them and we're safe."
>you helped strap him in and went over the procedure in triplicate
>you couldn't fuck this up
>you refused to fail
>Ash just closed his eyes and tried to think about warm beaches

>you were initially afraid to pull the trigger on the whole thing and you couldn't put it to words
>Ash was kind of odd to you but the tech may kill him
>you'd have been the one to do it
>but part of you knew if you didn't the parasites would end up winning over
>and if that happened the world was screwed
>so Ash did the only thing he could
>you had to honor that
>it took a lot of courage from someone that probably hadn't dealt with anything like this before
>yes, you ended up activating the thing
>it started powering up, making a whole lot of noises you weren't a fan of
>then the lasers started happening
>a red sight narrowed over the mouse boy's chest and hovered over the heart
>he kept his eyes closed and started silently mumbling to distract from the noises
>you didn't know at all how any of this would go but the machinery seemed to work automatically 
>the lasers cut into the mouse and he cried out
>you nearly jumped to stop it but them the next wave began and the incision was bathed in what you assumed was the radiation 
>again, you went off what you could gleam from the notes
>Ashley was clearly going to hurt from this but it seemed to have done the trick after a few minutes of pain
>you hated to see anyone go through that but the procedure was brief
>you helped him out of the chair after the computer read out gave you the best possible news
>the eggs were dead now
>this equipment had worked flawlessly 
>he was understandably shaken and you treated the incision
>the laser had thankfully seemed to seal up the wound after the cut
>he was weak and you offered him some of your provisions to keep up his strength
>you kept verbally checking to make sure he was alright
>slowly he recovered and you were eager to get your own process over with
>after he helped you onto the table you saw his gaze linger over you
>he must be wracked with the same guilt you had
>the pain from the cut burned like hell and the radiation wasn't much better
>you didn't know how Ash didn't scream from this, but you grit your teeth through the whole thing and tried to hold on
>when your reading said you were clean you could finally breath 
>you complimented Ash for enduring that and he turned into a stuttering mess 
>especially when you planted your hand on his shoulder and said you were serious
>God would this cut hurt for a while but the risk and pain seemed to be worth it
>you were both free 
>you pulled him into a hug and ignored the burn when you held him up in the air
>he flailed about like a fish and his tail knocked over a bunch of paperwork 
>"p-put me down!" 
> you looked up at the mouse boy confused 
>"uh, please. you shouldn't reopen your wounds…"

>you set him down gently and he dusted himself off and readjusted his skirt
>still strange to think "his" skirt
>by now the mouse thing wasn't even a big deal
>the whole situation had skidded so far past unbelievable that anything was possible
>next you'd be fighting a giant zombie t rex or evil fungus
>nothing was a surprise any more
>Ash kissing you was the exception
>he pulled back and rested against your chest just as quick as his muzzle had met your lips
>you asked what that was for
>"you saved us, that's why"
>you knew this wasn't over though
>you'd have to kill the queen bug just to make sure this all wouldn't happen again
>and you bet that Saddler was the queen behind all of this
>his attempts at suave Bond villain monologuing meant he had to be the biggest cheese here
>ha
>cheese
>after you both felt up to it you reloaded and made your way out
>along the way you found Luis again 
>he wanted to talk to you more but before you could a stranger barged into the room
>well not exactly a stranger
>Krauser was a former comrade who you'd assumed was KIA on a mission 
>instead he lunged for Luis with a knife
>Ash pulled the Spaniard back in a feat of strength you didn't know he had
>Krauser looked no worse for wear considering the dead man thing
>he also decided to pick up a penchant for supervillain speeches
>so you had no doubts of who he worked for
>instead of letting him gloat you just chucked an incendiary grenade at him and the 3 of you bolted out of the room
>since you'd found the right lab earlier you didn't have to worry about collateral damage now 
>at least the fire would keep Krauser distracted
>no idea why he thought a stupid ambush like that would work
>the three of you managed to get back outside the compound and you contacted Hunnigan
>you were brief with a lot of the details but you saw the way forward into the compound
>the lab facility was just the start and you hadn't found Saddler there
>so that meant he was deeper on this island fortress 
>and with some of the fortifications making this place looking like a tiny camp, you'd need air support
>she said she'd have something prepared in about 15
>that gave you time to speak to Luis
>he ended up coming clean
>the cop thing was a cover
>he'd initially helped with these bugs
>research and development so to speak
>some of those notes you used were his
>he had felt guilty about assisting Saddler but you'd seen he had turned a new leaf
>he thanked you for the assist with Krauser 
>you told him to thank… Ashley
>yes
>the president's daughter Ashley
>you wanted to make sure before you parted ways 
>you asked Luis if Ashley seemed strange to him
>the mouse boy elbowed you roughly for the perceived insult then apologized for the elbow
>"she's American. you're all strange."
>you threw your hands up and wished him well
>you reminded him to find a safe hiding spot if Krauser was targeting him
>hopefully the fire would put him out of commission for a while but given what other experiments happened here you bet he was super charged
>thankfully he seemed to turn his knife on you immediately in that room
>you promised Luis a seat on the chopper out of here if he wanted it and he looked genuinely shocked
>he did help after all
>you hoped this was over soon
>you had enough time to take stock of the situation and your ammo 
>the sniper rifle seemed to work before 
>so you would use that again
>Ash would have spare ammo on hand
>you were hoping the chopper would pulverize the defenses and you'd just have to wipe out the stragglers
>you heard the machine before you saw it
>whoever was flying out in the night now was ballsy 
>sure enough he got on the radio
>introduced himself to you as Mike 
>you told him you owed him a beer and he said he knew a bar
>then he introduced himself to the cultists
>he spared no time and started lighting up everything that moved
>you even saw a couple of those chain gunners caught in a rocket blast
>that was satisfying 
>you shouldered the rifle when Ashley pointed out movement on one of the towers
>a guy carrying a rocket launcher 
>well that would have been a problem if you didn't put lead through his skull
>the rocket launcher was still a threat to you so your sight around it
>someone might have some balls and try to grab it
>you asked Ash to keep spotting
>none of them had found their balls and grabbed the rocket launcher
>After a few minutes Mike brought you out of it with a transmission
>"sorry man, all tapped out. I can spin back around after a resupply"
>you surveyed the burning defenses and said you'd be able to take it from here
>the chopper vanished back into the twilight sky and you both set out
>you felt like the end was ahead of you
>you asked what Ash was doing once you two were done here
>he looked kind of nervous and sort of mumbled an answer
>no idea why he was shy now
>sure enough the destruction was total
>cultists were shredded left and right
>shrapnel in a body there, one charred black there
>you had your pistol at the ready and Ash was right behind you
>both of you had your eyes out and you figured no one would be able to jump the mouse 
>you did make a point to climb up a surviving tower
>that rocket launcher was a good find and the dumbest you'd killed wasn't using it
>Ash did look at it enviously but you weren't eager to hand a rookie that level of ordinance 
>you crept across the open fortress unchallenged
>all the defenders must have come out to deal with the bird
>well, to get dealt with by the bird
>the compound ahead of you looked daunting but the doors were blown open
>the place was bare and exposed
>you feared an ambush but there was no choice
>you bet Saddler was waiting
>quiet hung over the area aside from the fires behind you
>this was it, no turning back
>you turned to Ash and said he could hang back now
>things would get really dangerous now before it got better
>he punched your shoulder 
>his voice was hushed
>"we are getting out of this. us."
>after Ash sort of asserted himself you couldn't really disagree
>you wanted to give him the chance to walk away like Luis but he was adamant 
>well you weren't going to turn down help
>you both snuck through the empty fort and ended up inside a maintenance area
>you'd seen a helipad connected to it and this was the easiest path to it
>you had figured this was the way to it
>Saddler might be trying to escape by now
>what you two didn't expect was Krauser in the way
>ok maybe you did expect it
>he seemed too dead set on fighting you 
>"you going to keep the mouse out of this?"
>wait
>he knew?
>he brandished a pretty hefty knife at you
>you had no idea what his game was but he was serious
>you had to get to Saddler and end this so for now
>the old comrade would have to be stopped first
>so you made the mistake of playing fair and pulled your own combat knife
>he charged at you and went for a killing blow right off the bat
>but you dodged it by inches
>you felt the steel against your neck as the thrust passed by 
>he was fast
>unnaturally fast
>thrusts and swipes were testing your defenses
>you dodged and weaved but you know you couldn't keep the rhythm up forever
>you had to go on the offensive 
>Ash wanted to help but you both knew the whirlwind of blades was a bad idea to step into
>you should have just blown this guy up
>when you'd managed to slam your knife between his ribs he didn't even react
>so you were right about earlier 
>he wasn't human
>the man didn't sell a knife to a chest
>even worse, the knife was out of your hand now
>you knew you shouldn't have played fair
>Krauser decided to stop playing and his arm transformed into some bladed blur of armor
>yeah he was definitely a freakshow now
>he swung faster now
>you saw that blade arm cut through steel like butter
>you were fucked in close quarters 
>thankfully, Ash decided he wasn't playing fair either and Krauser used the arm to shield himself from a spray of machine gun fire
>the distraction gave you the chance to disengage and get a firearm of your own out
>he was advancing on the mouse boy but received a back full of buckshot for his trouble
>he'd pay for turning his back on you
>you had enough time to pump another shot into him before the shield was pointed to you
>Ash picked up the idea and reloaded and mag dumped his exposed side
>if Krauser wouldn't play fair then fuck it
>you had to hurry 
>the veteran couldn't keep up with the two of you pouring on heat 
>that fancy arm couldn't protect him from everything coming his way and he got desperate 
>he rushed Ash, the mouse panicking 
>you hit Krauser square in the back with a double kick and both of you ended up tumbling together
>Ash reloaded and backed up while you and Krauser wrestled 
>the arm was an issue and you had to dodge multiple swipes but you got your knife back and slammed it home into his throat
>all the damage piled up and that was the end of it, BOW or not
>you stumbled to your feet and realized you were covered in cuts from the last little scuffle 
>your eyes hovered over the still warm corpse as Ash asked you something
>Krauser had been a good man at one point
>there was a mystery of why he was here, why he was working for Saddler and how he noticed Ash
>he took that with him
>you only came back to reality when Ash gently shook your shoulder
>his blue eyes were full of concern now when they met yours 
>you said you were OK
>you weren't

>Ash gently guided you away from the corpse and it helped remind you of the mission
>Saddler would keep doing this if you didn't stop him
>that and the bugs in you could still be activated, making this whole struggle pointless
>so you carried on
>cleared your head
>before you left you gave Ash one last chance to leave 
>you thanked him but you knew Saddler would pull some sort of giant monster trick 
>learned that from Birkin
>the mouse checked his guns and said what he said before
>"I'm not dying a virgin and when this is over I'm collecting on that"
>well that was weird
>hopefully he'd find someone to settle down with
>you both made your way over to the helipad and your instincts were right
>the cult leader stood out in the open
>and again started lecturing you on Americans or something
>then did exactly what you called and turned into a giant freakish monster
>even Birkin didn't have that many eyes
>Ash was a little more squeamish and actually said "ewwwww"
>but all those eyes meant one thing
>all those weak points

>Saddler scuttled around the area on thin spindly legs
>you were essentially fighting a giant spider 
>one with eyes on the leg joints
>which was a really stupid design flaw for the parasite
>you told Ash you'd pull what you did on Krauser on this thing
>sure it was faster but the thing's attention would be split 
>you asked if Ash was OK attracting its attention for something big
>he nodded
>a spray of machine gun fire knocked out two of it's eyes and Saddler was pissy with the fleeing mouse
>you weren't getting bogged down I another big fight
>you were finishing this quickly
>you'd embellish it later maybe but you'd had enough lectures and you'd definitely had enough giant monsters
>Saddler had made the mistake of combing them 
>you shouted for Ash to get clear and the creature was pulped by a rocket instantly 
>didn't even have time to react
>Ash was covered in gunk and more than a little pouty you didn't warn him better but he was alright
>you couldn't tell if it was because of the danger or of him wanting to use the rocket launcher
>Saddler was a burning pile of gore on the helipad
>you'd call in a chopper for extraction in a few minutes
>for the moment you rested against a crate and patted the space next to you
>Ash sat down and was still trying to get gunk out of his hair
>you scoffed a little but then decided to help a little
>he got sort of nervous when you brushed his hair 

>your radio crackled to life
>Ada somehow had gotten your frequency 
>she apparently got what she wanted and was leaving
>classic
>you hid your shock pretty well
>however, she offered up a jetski as a sort of repayment for your help
>you didn't bother asking just what you did
>but a jetski would beat the chopper ride
>so you'd accept the gift
>just hoped it didn't come with strings attached 
>Ash perked up
>maybe you needed the time off
>next you got on the radio with Hunnigan
>as it turns out Saddler on his deathbed confirmed the president's daughter was safe an sound elsewhere
>he said he was really sorry about the whole thing
>you were taking off and you made sure to make it known
>hunnigan said your job was done
>vacation sounded good

>you pointed out there was an asset for extraction if they came by chopper
>Luis had been a help and you'd secure him a way off the island 
>plus, if willing, he'd be an expert if this ever popped up again
>it would be a help for the clean up at least
>didn't want an international incident with the idea American hands were involved here
>with all that cleared up, you went down to the shore
>sure enough there was a jetski tied to a dock 
>a little alcove protected it from sight unless you were really searching
>well you weren't looking a gift horse in the mouth
>the mainland could be seen and you figured you'd put as much distance between the both you and this situation as possible
>later you'd need a medical check up but the bug queen was dead with Saddler
>they couldn't come back
>at least not any time soon
>Luis would be a big help there
>you asked if Ash wanted to go to a beach now
>after you hopped onto the jetski, he awkwardly hopped on after and asked you in a whisper
>"Spain has nude beaches, right?"

>you hadn't really been to Spain so you didn't have a lot of knowledge about the beaches, nude or otherwise 
>was he flirting? 
>was that flirting? 
>it wasn't like with Ada where you knew it was a facade
>he seemed like, genuine 
>maybe he liked you
>well maybe the feeling was mutual 
>perhaps you'd pull some overtime with him
>soft white arms wrapped around your neck and you gunned it
>after the mission you'd earned that r&r and you'd make good on it
>was going to be hard to get used to not dodging pitchforks when you heard Spanish though
>at least sangria might be nice
>Ash curled up tightly to your back and you just enjoyed the moment
>after all the danger this was actually stress relief
>you'd save small talk with Ash for when you weren't revving the tiny motor bouncing over waves
>the taxpayer dollar might have to put up for your hotel room

>you initially checked into a decent hotel
>the staff didn't bat an eye at Ash
>you didn't even bother asking
>it had been a rough time and you didn't bother
>what you needed was a shower and a nap
>maybe an actual meal 
>they didn't also seem to worry about the guns
>that might be why they just accepted the money and left you alone
>you'd have to have a long talk with polica down the road but given they were aware beforehand, that could wait
>Ash perked up when you mentioned one room
>"you don't want two?"
>it was just more economical 
>you offered to sleep on the couch to which he strongly asserted you get the bed
>by now the mouse thing was old hat to you
>a lithe mouse boy pulling you to your room with the glee of an excited kid at Disney world was at least a relief
>before any shower you got on the horn to Hunnigan again
>this called for a month vacation at least
>she would wire the funds and she said the president's daughter was found safe after searching party spots
>"so who did you rescue?"
>that made you freeze up
>you looked to Ash for some response and he was equally was stumped
>you decided to slightly fib and say the cult mistakenly grabbed the wrong person
>it wasn't wrong
>but had to stop yourself from giving too many details
>after the tense negotiation for your well earned cash and stay a shower sounded good
>you offered Ash the shower first but he had an idea to save water
>you opened the door of the balcony out to the ocean air
>a warmth crept in and you decided to ask what he meant
>"oh you know," he remarked while looking towards his feet
>well paws
>his meek side had resurfaced yet again and you grinned
>maybe you knew what he was talking about
>it was more fun to get him to fess up though
>he was cute trying to work up the courage
>he helped you fight off Saddler but here he was skittish here
>so maybe you played a little dumb
>he finally stuttered out his idea
>"I-I want to shower with you"
>that sounded like a reasonable request
>you asked if that had to do with his earlier promise
>his courage melted instantly once more 
>fine you both would shower together 
>you'd go buy a change of clothes later too
>after all you'd both been through you appreciated Ash 
>plus, he was looking cute 
>you pulled him into a hug and the mouse boy reciprocated after a few seconds 
>your hand slid down the small of his back and Ash trembled a little
>you felt it 
>well you also felt something else
>you never really did figure out why he insisted on dressing like a girl
>but the skirt made it obvious he was enjoying this
>so after all the danger and stress maybe Ash was perfect
>he leaned into the hug hard this time 
>a quiet sanctuary after the Spanish speaking hell you both were tossed into 
>the sea breeze bristled over his white fur and his blonde locks faintly moved
>he'd look better if he grew the hair out
>you didn't want to ruin the moment by breaking it up so Ash was the first to speak
>"let's get cleaned up"
>surprisingly, the mouse boy was more shy this time about exposing himself
>he tried to hide his face when he slid the plaid skirt down 
>why he thought having his ass to you was better you didn't know
>was he wanting you to see his ass confined in cute panties?
>the color complimented his white fur
>maybe he was attractive
>you had to admit that
>his pink tail clutched tightly to his body and hung downwards
>you realized he caught you staring after a few seconds then you went to strip yourself
>at least he didn't seem to mind you watching
>you had no idea why a guy covered up his chest like you'd see boobs though
>if anything you liked it better with him flat
>when you were both finally naked only then did you strike 
>you picked him up and onto your shoulder
>there was the usual "put me down" but you gave him a gentle smack on his bare ass and he groaned
>you were actually looking forward to making sure he wasn't a virgin now
>maybe he'd stick around
>maybe he'd make you think about an early retirement
>perhaps being with a guy was good
>he was less a tease than Ada
>the mouse thing was oddly charming too
>his fur felt good against your skin
>he didn't fight your grip as you went for the spacious hotel shower
>there was a few feeble verbal protests but you noticed they were hushed when he saw your penis
>you distinctly saw him glance over to it and then try not to glance at it
>being upside down and crotch height didn't give him options
>the manhood against your shoulder twitched a little
>you decided before you set him down to test the boundaries a little
>you gave his hip a quick peck with your lips and you would have thought you'd hit a button on him
>his fidgeting and protests returned with newfound strength 
>well that seemed to work
>you set him down on his feet in the shower
>he was easy enough to handle
>when the water initially came on it was frigid, making Ash leap back into you with a squeak
>then he quickly regained his composure with the water pouring down over you two
>now you really decided to push your luck and try to actually maybe charm him
>you tried to think about the stuff Ada did 
>but that flirting probably wasn't genuine 
>you wanted to be truthful here
>that way he would appreciate it more
>so you pulled him back against your chest, his massive ears almost blocking your vision over his head
>you decided to ask why he wanted to go to a nude beach when he could be nude here
>he got a little sullen from his body language but didn't fight you touching him
>"you're not just saying this because you feel obligated to, right? I feel bad putting you on the spot in that cave"
>the warm water ran off his coat of fur and it mesmerized you
>your hand ventured over his bare chest and you could feel his heart racing
>your other hand pulled him closer so you could make sure he could tell you were serious
>by that you meant your penis
>you felt his breath hitch as he processed it all
>his mind was rushing
>Ash was panicked 
>this was actually happening 
>he was actually getting you
>it was like a dream come true and he couldn't believe his luck
>there was an urge building up in his body
>his pink nipples were growing stiff as his manhood
>he couldn't suppress a groan at the attention 
>something you noticed 
>he got bashful and squirmy 
>when your hand tightened against him he ended up melting into the embrace
>meekly, Ash turned up to look you in the eyes
>his blue eyes gazed into yours
>"I have something to tell you…"
>you looked down to him in anticipation 
>"would you hold it against me if I told you Saddler wasn't the queen?"
>his blue eyes flashed red and you realized he'd pushed your back against the shower
>your heart dropped when you realized the danger you were in right now
>then he smiled and cuddled against your chest
>you had questions and you didn't know where to start
>so he spoke up softly 
>"you're not mad, right?"
>he realized your hands had stopped feeling him up
>the whole situation was like standing on a landmine
>"sorry"
>you felt a little pity over how defeated he sounded
>his ears slouched slightly and that brought you back
>the question though
>was he still Ash?
>you just decided to come out and ask that
>you hit him with that treatment thing 
>this shouldn't have happened
>why didn't that work?
>"well it did. you severed its link. I am still me. but it's weird."
>he held out his hand and transformed into a clawed, armored facsimile of his arm
>that gray carapace replacing white fur
>then he waved his hand and the white fur drowned out the carapace and it looked normal again
>"the procedure couldn't kill the queen plagas. it only neutered it. still all me in here."
>your grip on him relaxed now
>he wouldn't lie about you and if the parasite wanted to it could kill you or turn you into a thrall 
>you asked what happened now?
>"well if you'll have me, I remember not wanting to die a virgin."
>the mouse boy sounded as timid as he ever did
>you were still taken aback by his revelation 
>but it still felt like Ash
>so maybe this was still a little weird
>you asked about the bugs in you
>"they're dead. honest."
>his fur was warm against your skin
>"they probably hoped for me to make a big hive in the white house. but that procedure cut it off."
>the mouse boy still affectionately cuddled back against you
>you realized you were still hard
>your dick had been oblivious to the danger
>"I guess I get this thing riding co-pilot but it's not in control. I was scared to tell you. hell I was scared of what it meant."
>you decided to put your faith in him
>so you asked him something risky
>a test
>fully transform if he can and transform back
>if he had full control then this was the best idea
>if not you were dead
>he was hesitant at first then agreed
>you readied yourself for some disgusting sight to fill the shower
>he groaned as he fully let go and you let your grip go slack as you prepared to jump out of the stall
>what you got was Ash with one clawed carapace arm
>carapace legs that ended in dainty organic high heels
>they stopped right at his thighs like stockings
>his proportions grew slightly, becoming well, thicker
>his hair seemed to grow out a little too
>it seemed to really accentuate the feminine features he already possessed
>was his ass bigger?
>granted it had been a queen bug
>his shame returned when he realized he was standing nude in front of you
>he went to cover his chest again and you nearly laughed
>this was far from what you'd seen from the cult or Racoon City
>Ash had put your fears to rest
>you asked if that was all
>he said it had been cut off there
>his eyes were crimson but so filled with embarrassment you knew who was in control
>so all the parasite could do now was give him a more ample rear
>"I feel like a freak…"
>you asked if that's it?
>"that's it?"
>he looked shocked 
>you were surprised, sure
>but he was still Ash
>he looked like he wanted to say something
>there was that worry
>you decided to take charge 
>the water pounded down, filling the lull in conversation 
>he almost flinched when you grabbed him
>you asked if he was serious about you taking his virginity
>just what was that confession if the cave if he was stopping here?
>maybe love was a bit strong here and now
>but you had no other word
>you'd both seen hell
>he wasn't in a good state mentally now
>so it was your turn to push him against the wall
>he gasped but barely had time to inhale when you kissed his muzzle forcefully
>that broke down the barriers
>he writhed in your grip and you almost thought you'd made him cum just from a kiss 
>you saw what caused his reaction instantly when you opened your eyes
>thin tentacles had sprouted from his back
>his breathing was ragged
>"they…reacted to you"
>you were a little shocked and it showed on your face
>"oh God"
>Ash covered his face with his hands and the tentacles mimicked the motion
>you actually started laughing
>he was still him
>well since it was still him, you reasoned, you owed him a couple promises
>you two had gotten through that ordeal 
>the other promise you hadn't fulfilled
>he peaked out of his clawed hand
>"really? even like this?"
>you pointed out you were both hard as rock
>he'd been so nervous he didn't even notice
>you told him he smelled nice
>that seemed to be good flirting material 
>judging by the way his manhood twitched against yours it worked
>he whined and you could tell he was still hesitant 
>so you went for the nuclear option
>you gently held his clawed hand in your own, your fingers intertwining with carapace digits
>he audibly gasped
>he leaked precum against you and couldn't hide you were winning him over
>the shower still poured over you two for a moment until he spoke again
>"let's do it'
>he broke the hand holding to wrap his arms around your neck and just cuddle against you again 
>you had an idea 
>the mouse boy squeaked when you started cleaning him
>you'd been in the shower so long you had forgotten you wanted to clean up
>it would give you both a good chance to explore 
>when you offered to scrub his back he stammered
>you said he could do you after you do him
>his blush returned but he agreed
>you used what shampoo you had on his fur
>his coat was silky smooth and you allowed your hands to glide over his curves 
>he was still embarrassed but you could tell he was liking the attention
>you turned him back around like how you were originally cuddled up 
>sure enough the five thin tentacles had sprouted out of his back
>you took care not to be rough around them 
>a couple of them reacted to your touch
>at least once one of them wrapped around your wrist when you pulled back
>you were scrubbing right around his thin tail
>when he realized what happened he hid his face again
>"I can't control them sometimes…"
>you asked if maybe they were just doing what he wanted
>then you rested your hand right on that spot and the mouse boy reacted
>his body involuntarily pushed back against your hand
>your palm over his generous rear, he seemed to be beside himself
>the tentacles spoke for him though
>a few had latched onto your hand and you didn't know whether he was doing it voluntarily or not
>you pulled him close and the limbs released
>instead they started searching your body
>you asked if he was doing that and he was a mess again
>so they have a mind of their own?
>the smooth slick appendages seemed to have a boldness Ash couldn't bring himself to have
>one finally found your dick and tried to pull you closer to the mouse boy
>you had an inkling of where the tentacle was poking you into
>you suggested lube though
>shower first and then fun time
>the tentacles did seem to slightly back off with that suggestion and Ash was fine with your hands on him
>his coat had been a mess because of your adventure but now he was looking ivory white 
>the mouse boy's coat looked like it could shine thanks to your work
>washing his armored hand was strange
>it had a tough hard plastic texture 
>switching over to soap, he silently relished in feeling your hands move over his digits
>did you just make him coo?
>when you started washing lower he nearly jumped
>his thighs were definitely plumper now
>you could feel that
>this was the most intimate you'd been with someone, usually the job came first
>this was the first real oasis in your life and it was because of a cult's botched kidnapping
>wet hair came off of Ash as you continued
>he'd needed this cleaning for ages
>chances were the cult didn't exactly have a spa
>Ash now smelled of raspberries 
>rubbing one of his big ears elicited a low groan and the tentacles seem to hug onto you 
>so that was his sweet spot

>your hand on his chest supported him
>maybe it was love
>you sure did enjoy his company
>you decided to kiss his head between his ears and he lost his footing
>his furry hand held onto you and you had remained steadfast
>you asked him to help you wash up
>he paused before whipping around and pinning your back to the shower
>he was deceptively strong now
>he took his time smelling you 
>his eyes were red but he wasn't nervous 
>perhaps he was pushed to the edge by your request
>you were a little frightened but his smelling was followed by licking and kissing
>it felt right to ask if he was OK
>he relaxed his grip and looked apologetic
>"sorry, I think this whole thing is playing havoc with my libido"
>would explain the mood swing
>you'd have to take care of that
>the mouse boy licking and smelling at your skin was already doing a number on you
>you throbbed and he noticed
>his tentacles casually roamed over you as he went lower
>"this thing is making it harder for me to think about anything but…"
>he was on his knees nuzzling his face to your manhood
>"I've spent damn near this whole hell trip wanting this dick"
>he opened his mouth and bottomed out in one smooth motion 
>the muzzle meant it was easy for him to bury his face in your pubes
>something odd was happening to your penis
>his tongue was there
>the muscle working over the underside
>more than that though
>it felt like something was swallowing your manhood
>like a sheath sliding over it 
>eventually the tongue was fully replaced by the sleeve
>the red eyes faded and it was the familiar blue
>he looked up to you for approval and you couldn't help but buck your hips
>you decided to rub his ear again
>he liked that and the moan reverberated over your dick
>whatever was around your dick started milking it 
>Ash just closed his eyes and buried his face as much as possible against your crotch
>occasionally he'd sniff at your pubes and groan
>you were overwhelmed at the moment 
>blowjobs felt amazing
>you had to endorse them now
>you were glad Ash got your first one
>whatever he was doing in his mouth he didn't even need to break away to breath
>he just kept milking you with his eyes closed 
>tentacles roamed to your free hand and slipped around it
>the texture was still alien but you were fine with the small display of affection
>his armored hand rested on your hip as his normal hand played with your nuts
>if Ash was a virgin, he was gifted
>his work was rewarded when you growled his name and busted a fat nut down his throat
>he didn't even flinch
>just kept draining as hard as he could
>when we was sure he had every last drop, only then did he pull off
>"this wasn't exactly how I dreamed it would happen…"
>he looked a little down again as he looked at his hand
>you gave the tentacles a squeeze in your hand and picked up his chin
>he was still Ash
>you were both safe
>and honestly, if he'd have you, you wanted to make this an actual thing
>not a fling
>not fuck buddies
>he'd saved your life
>so you wanted to be in his
>"but… look at me."
>you didn't speak, but you let your cock stiffen in front of his face in response
>you had no regrets meeting Ash
>as long as he was him and in no danger you were happy
>he wasn't a monster
>besides, you told him you were fine with him being a giant mouse 
>"I guess I'm fine with you being a giant monkey too"
>his laughter after was a good sign
>then he had an epiphany 
>"oh shit, the shower!"
>he had come to his senses after the attention he gave you 
>the session must have helped him clear his head
>his eyes were back to that sparkling blue but were filled with a frantic energy
>your best guess was he realized you'd both been in the shower for almost an hour
>good thing water wasn't included on the bill 
>the shower was now tepid against your skin but it was no worse than the Atlantic earlier
>he frantically grabbed the soap, having it slip multiple times from his grasp
>his nervousness had returned and you asked yourself how he made due with a firearm earlier
>you'd definitely need to take him practice shooting
>your hand went for the base of his ear and he cooed and instantly loosened up
>that was win button
>you told him to take a deep breath and he looked over to you apologetic
>"I just feel bad if I waste your time off."
>if he considered earlier a waste of time, well you wanted to waste more time
>after all you had been through that orgasm was the best way to start off your vacation
>however, you pointed out, he would just have to blow you faster next time if he worried about that
>his body language told you he was blushing like a schoolgirl again
>"I just kind of lost it. couldn't help myself"
>his hands went to work softly scrubbing your bare skin
>he was sightseeing 
>you asked if he really wanted all that with the sex or was the bug thing goading him on
>"the first. I really want you. it's just this whole host thing…"
>you raised your arms to let him scrub and you caught him faintly smelling you while he worked
>the nose twitch was an easy tell
>"it's like guys who'd do things while drunk they wouldn't do sober. best way to put it."
>so it just made him bolder?
>"yeah…"
>so there were changes
>you were tempted to ask around but a thought had occurred 
>what would they do to Ash?
>the nightmare of him on an operating table made your dick limp even with the mouse's soft paw on your chest
>maybe for now this would be a secret between you two
>as long as he wasn't hurting
>you did ask him though, in a soft tone
>to please tell you if anything at all changed
>you'd do whatever you could to help
>your hug interrupted his quest back down your body
>but he accepted it quickly
>while you were entangled like this you decided to ask 
>would he want to go steady?
>you heard a sniffle from him in response and he buried himself tighter to your chest
>"thank you. I'd love that"
>it was quiet but you heard it
>afterwards he pushed back gently
>then apologized again for using the hot water
>which you scoffed at
>his scrubbing continued and when he came back up you were amused by how much he seemed to like your face
>both clawed and regular hand ran over it
>he was trying to get a good look with his fingers and you let him
>maybe because you were novel to him as he was to you
>finally he softly washed your hair, the clawed hand almost like a brush through it
>finally, you both stepped out clean
>you both pretended not to watch each other dry off
>Ash had you help him with the blow dryer, the warmth making him sigh as it ran over his fur
>you had a feeling you might not be married to the job any more if Ash was this distracting
>it's funny
>for all his deception he was still the most genuine relationship you'd had
>maybe because he really had just had one real bad day
>you were that way stepping into Raccoon City
>despite the whole package in front you definitely not being related to the president, a girl, or remotely human
>he was just as scared then as you were
>you just had had better training
>after drying yourselves you asked Ash if he could transform back and the mouse boy tried
>tried because all he really succeeded in was having hair grow over the armored parts now
>it was sort of thin and you bet it was easily shed
>however it covered the carapace about as well as it could
>he looked confused 
>the tentacles had receded but his ass and thighs were still plumper
>it wasn't an on off switch like before
>he was a little panicked but you had an idea
>maybe that sexual encounter sealed the deal so to speak
>you were flying blind and that was the best solution you could come up with
>the parasites seemed to worry about concealment to a certain point then said fuck it
>that and he said it was sort of botched by the procedure 
>better than having it control him
>though a remark about him needing bigger panties had him flustered
>his old boots fit and sort of covered the armor
>you joked about an armored codpiece and he'd be set to go outside and he stammered
>you were repeatedly reminded "it doesn't work like that"
>some of his outfit was salvageable 
>you gave him your old jacket to cover up the tattered sweater and you'd think you handed him a bar of gold
>he didn't have to smell it but he did
>he seemed really hung up on smell for some reason 
>was the shower not enough?
>maybe you smelled bad and he was just weird about it
>you'd invest in some different deodorant later
>for now you'd settle on clothes that weren't shredded 
>you both settled on a small store in town 
>thankfully you had enough currency on hand from the adventure for a few outfits
>Ash felt guilty about you paying but you brought up how's this different than when you bought guns for him
>well, her
>you were very aware the giant mouse bug thing was complex to outsiders 
>no reason to add the crossdressing to it
>never did get an answer for that straight from the mouse's mouth
>the store owners didn't seem phased by the whole thing
>just two weird Americans 
>you instantly got a few cheap outfits but Ash was a little harder
>once you encouraged him to indulge he did 
>with gusto
>the mouse busied himself between racks
>managed to somehow get a pink everything
>a new sweater
>a couple of skirts, one of which had a slit that barely covered the thigh
>you asked why he wanted sunglasses when they wouldn't fit his head and he seemed distressed he couldn't accessorize 
>but a new top made up for it
>you asked about a new jacket but he said he was keeping yours
>he told you he had one thing he'd found you weren't allowed to see until tonight
>all together it was a bundle, but not the end of the world for your wallet
>next food
>you had no idea what Spanish cuisine was like but when in Rome
>or wherever this is
>you had enough gold to buy a hundred meals from the sleepy little restaurant 
>again, no one batted an eye at the two weird Americans 
>unsurprisingly, they had seafood
>so seafood it was
>Ash was worried by the sticker shock of the place but you reminded him it was a vacation
>tough times were over
>you were a little surprised when Ash ordered the largest steak possible
>not the price or anything
>just
>he was a mouse
>you expected like dainty or something
>especially with the whole girlish figure 
>a steak almost the size of your head was rolled out
>as was your scallop garlic dish
>you breathed a sigh of relief as you finally got to cut loose after that cultist shit
>you barely even flinched at Spanish now
>this really did feel like a vacation now
>Ash wolfed down his steak with a zeal you'd only seen in lions on nature specials 
>though he was careful not to dirty his new top
>you brought up what his surprise was
>he said it was supposed to be a surprise 
>so no reveal until he was ready
>well, you could be patient 
>the food was good, definitely better than when you were foraging 
>you'd have to hit a market eventually just so you weren't eating out all the time
>"you meant what you said earlier. all the stuff about going steady? like, with me?"
>you almost made a joke about who else you could refer to, the mouse in his pocket?
>but you felt like the first cheese pun had already pushed it
>you said yes and placed your hand over his
>you could feel the armor under his light fur 
>he was no doubt still self conscious about that
>but he was worth it
>maybe you were weird for falling like this
>you'd never had much luck earlier with romance
>he seemed just as hapless
>good luck you were both on equal footing
>you nearly bolted out of your chair when you felt something slip up your pants leg
>all the while, Ash innocently ate his steak next to you
>you tried to get his attention without causing a scene 
>there were two other patrons at other tables
>you finally gently nudged him and when he realized the issue he became embarrassed 
>the tentacle retreated back to its master
>that was close
>the thing had been slipping around your dick 
>after the meal you headed to the market
>they had supplies for a while and you grabbed essentials the hotel didn't have 
>Ash did in fact light up when you handed him a half wheel of local cheese
>they didn't exactly have a whole lot in the way of protection
>you felt slightly nervous buying condoms but they would have to do
>you got some deodorant and he looked confused
>you remarked on him smelling you and he nearly fell over 
>his voice was a whisper as he replied
>"I was doing that because I like your smell"
>that was a weird thing to like
>he smelled nice but you'd never considered yourself to smell good
>well as long as he liked it
>then he saw the condoms and tried not to get antsy
>you got them because they were lubed
>the place didn't have any sort of weird kinky shit so you'd have to just use those
>he knew full well what you had planned 
>he had the same plans though
>carrying a bunch of bags to your room was easy
>Ash even helped with some of it
>you apparently weren't allowed to even gaze at one of the bags
>must be the surprise
>you put the stuff away and took your shoes off
>time to relax a little
>your head hit the pillow and a mattress never felt better
>your thoughts were interrupted when Ash saw you on the bed
>it must have induced something in him because his disguise immediately vanished
>the red eyes returned
>just lying on the bed? 
>was he that affected?
>judging by the tent in his new skirt and how quickly he crossed the room, he was
>the mouse boy straddled your lap immediately and his tentacles came out to play again
>there were more now
>you counted eight
>you asked if he was really OK 
>that seemed to calm him
>his eyes returned to blue
>"yeah, sorry. I just saw you here and my mind just… wandered?"
>a tentacle had slipped into your pants and began playing with your dick
>"you. do you mind if we? you know?"
>a single sharp claw drew a little heart outline over your chest as the weird little tentacles desperately fought against their master's reins 
>his eyes were like the ocean and pleaded with you
>his bare ass straddled your lap as his skirt was toyed with by the naughty limbs
>"please?"
>you even got a view of his throbbing manhood, dripping pre onto your new shirt
>he was the strange combination of a delicate flower and untamed beast
>you slightly hesitated at letting Ash off his leash, so to speak
>you saw him let go earlier in the shower
>you worried for him
>the tentacle in your pants was really putting up a convincing debate
>so you comprised 
>you wanted to make sure, really sure, he was still Ash and it would stay that way
>he was probably annoyed with you asking about his identity as frequently as you have
>but you just didn't want to lose him to this
>you asked him to promise he'd tell you if he had any more changes
>he didn't notice the other tentacles until you pointed it out
>makes sense
>you don't pay mind to your arms all the time
>he looked back to you after surveying the new additions
>"I get it."
>he rubbed down on your lap and groaned
>"but…"
>his eyes locked with yours as he stopped his hips from moving
>"I wouldn't let this thing hurt you."
>you replied you were more worried about him
>"I count breaking your heart as hurting you…"
>the mouse boy used his furred hand to slick his hair back as he fought to keep himself together
>"please keep your promise though, please?"
>the tentacles shoved his top up and undid his skirt
>you had a 110 pound tiger in your lap and he needed to hear you utter the word go
>maybe that was a good sign he was still him
>"it's like there there's this burning in me"
>you were still a little hesitant 
>tentacles roamed towards the the nightstand and grabbed the condom box
>they gently placed the box on your chest
>"pretty please~"
>the mouse pleaded to you
>his eyes, even with the red, really were his
>the armored palm rested on your abdomen 
>the mouse had you were he wanted you
>to his credit he really seemed to hold himself back
>the twink mouse was a coiled spring
>Ash's tail seemed raised in anticipation 
>maybe he knew you'd say yes
>tempted didn't begin to cover how you felt
>he was gorgeous right now
>so you finally agreed
>but only on the condition he be careful with his condition
>he promised then quickly snatched a condom from the package
>Ash decided to impress you by handing off the condom off to himself 
>his new appendages undid your pants, slid them down, and deftly slid the condom onto your manhood
>all without looking over his shoulder
>ok, you were impressed
>you didn't have time to caution him before he impaled himself without a single doubt
>just slammed all his weight down onto it
>holy shit
>he was like a vice
>he screamed your name as the sensation washed over you both
>he wasted no time recovering 
>you were shocked how quickly he decided to jackhammer down on your dick
>your hands went for his hips in some attempt to control him 
>his hips rolled with every slam
>there was a frantic energy burning though him
>he moaned and softly cooed your name
>begged you with every slam
>his muzzle brushed over your neck as he leaned in
>he wanted to kiss
>all the while his legs refused to keep working
>he might just be the most dangerous challenge you'd ever faced
>you didn't expect this sudden rough treatment
>not from the same guy that got jittery with having his shirt off 
>his tongue snuck past your lips
>you were here for the ride and he was hard to control
>your playmate decided to ride you harder and harder
>his enthusiasm was overwhelming 
>your first time with Ash was rough and violent
>within minutes of his start he broke the kiss to cry out
>his cum splattered in thick ropes, shooting as far as your neck
>his body shuddered as he rode the high of his first prostate orgasm
>only after did he relax
>you let him breath 
>his voice was soft in your ear
>"I needed that"
>however 
>you had the condom preventing you from the hair trigger of the mouse boy
>not for lack of trying
>his ass was still clenching at you
>so you asked if he was OK to keep going
>he faintly nodded and kissed at your neck
>your grip on his hips tightened and you set the pace this time
>he groaned and moaned the whole time
>tentacles gently rolled over you, gripping you
>"one small request," he managed to get out
>you asked just what he wanted
>"no more condoms" 
>given how good he felt now, you were inclined to agree
>"like right now"
>he pulled himself off your dick and tentacles deftly tore the rubber off and slunk it into a nearby trash can
>he was getting better at controlling them now
>he didn't hesitate in driving himself back down on your dick
>his clawed hand awkwardly balanced him, lightly clasped around your throat
>if he was a danger, well
>he could probably kill you
>instead he was rolling his his with your thrusts 
>moaning your name alongside sweet long drawn out expletives 
>pretty sure this was the most you'd heard the mouse boy swear
>wasn't even this much of a potty mouth when you fought those giants
>with the condom lube still there you still had some ease of pistoning into him
>without the condom though
>holy shit was it intense 
>the thin rubber had shielded you from the best of it
>in regards to his current condition maybe protected sex was better 
>but it sure didn't feel as good as this 
>you lost track of how long it took to flood his insides with cum
>he instantly shivered and clung tighter to you
>your climax had induced another smaller one in him
>only then did your dick soften and unceremoniously slip out of his clutch 
>you both were ragged
>his smile couldn't be hidden and you saw a return to his blue eyes
>your arms curled around him and he buried his face against your neck
>those tentacles continued to gently attempt to embrace you like his arms now did
>you hoped he liked his first time
>after all you'd been through, you both passed out in a messy heap
>after all that, all the hell, this felt like heaven
>you'd never felt this content before
>it was like all the danger and stress vanished
>you dreamed and slept
>the warmth of the boy laying on you served as a blanket
>he had let go after all of the same hell you went through
>this moment was a culmination and a release valve for you both
>you didn't remember when you woke up
>it was dark out
>you saw from the balcony window
>you needed that rest
>he had buried his face against your chest
>his warm cheek up against your bicep
>when he finally awoke, he gently stirred 
>his claws were like little needles as he flexed
>you noticed the tentacles stirred with him too
>he went to roll off you and yelped
>you jumped and asked what was wrong
>he flopped face first on the bed and rubbed his ass
>well that explained that
>bit off more than he could chew
>he groaned but you figured he'd be ok
>a subconscious reflex had his tentacles grasp out for you
>you made sure he was OK, kissing him on the head
>you broke the embrace to clean up a little in the bathroom
>you checked the freezer and there was an ice pack
>wrapping it in a towel, you had Ash sit on it
>you told him he'd have to be gentler next time
>"next time?" 
>he had a wry smile as he placed his ass on the towel
>you grabbed a cheese wheel and a knife 
>dinner was served
>you wanted a next time and he knew he had you right where he wanted
>you sat down next to him on the bed and you shared the cheese in a warm quiet
>he leaned on your shoulder
>his big ears brushed against your face as he relaxed 
>he looked down at his body and quietly remarked to himself
>"if this got me you, it was worth it."
