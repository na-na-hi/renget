>running the gauntlet through a small Spanish town to find the president's daughter
>sounds easy enough, right?
>just go in and get out
>armed resistance was expected, just not the severity of it
>you had packed accordingly for the mission but somehow things were worse than the briefings explained
>the reception was hostile to say the least
>you'd lost track of the amount of villagers you'd gunned down
>this was unreal
>different than the Raccoon City incident 
>they were smarter
>parasites meant each one was faster and smarter than decaying zombies
>you'd had a few close calls but managed
>recovering weapons as you went helped
>you were getting tired of getting screamed at in Spanish 
>the one friendly face that dude with the trench coat
>he seemed to always be ahead of you 
>but just kept taking money for firearms
>you just assumed shithole village was why he had that rocket launcher
>you wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth
>the trail to Ashley was warm now
>what you didn't expect after finally reaching her was a giant mouse girl screaming "don't come"
>you were pelted with a bunch of junk the second you'd opened the door
>the flimsy debris was swatted aside easily and you were quick to assure Ashley you were here to help
>that seemed to calm her for the moment
>you tried to lighten the mood a little, no doubt the kidnapping had her on edge
>of she even saw half the shit you did that might have her spooked
>when you said you were "cheesed to meet her" that stunned her into silence 
>well maybe not the desired effect but she'd calmed down
>you just needed to get out now
>before you set out you gave Hunnigan a report on Ashley's status
>visually she looked healthy and fine
>a rushed series of questions after reporting to Hunnigan confirmed the giant mouse was indeed fine
>looks like the villagers just scared her a little and nothing else
>whatever the group wanted for ransom, they had at least kept her unharmed
>maybe they really were civilized
>probably easier said than done
>the next length of your journey was quieter
>it felt deathly silent
>now you were really not wanting your cover blown
>you could handle yourself fine but you didn't need to get Ashley in danger
>you headed back through the church and leapt down a ladder
>guiding Ashley to leap down was difficult 
>but through silent coaxing she ended up landing in your arms
>you then both encountered a strange robed man 
>started muttering about America and you barely paid attention until he brought up you both had the parasites now
>those weird bugs hadn't hatched yet but he said it was only a matter of time
>all the smooth confidence of a comic book supervillain 
>his desire to have the girl back was something you couldn't indulge in
>a flash behind you made you realize the monologing was distracting
>robed cultists with crossbows
>you pulled Ashley through a nearby window faster than it would take to say "no way fags"
>Ashley looked genuinely worried and you couldn't lie and say you weren't also really anxious
>if those eggs hatched you'd be no different than those guys with the chainsaws and dynamite running around
>you promised her it wouldn't come to that
>somehow you'd set this straight
>you just didn't know how
>but like hell were you letting some super tapeworm win
>Ashley seemed to warm up to you after that whole bravado act
>you wondered if she was adopted after meeting the human president 
>five foot mouse girls with… ballistics don't just pop up without reason
>regardless of your pondering she clung tighter to you
>her white furred arm hooked on yours as she timidly watched your surroundings
>things were noticeably different with Ashley 
>it was more of a challenge dealing with the same group of crazies now
>Ashley was very vulnerable 
>a fact you were quickly aware of 
>you had to micromanage 
>the one upside was the villagers and cultists seemed to avoid hurting her
>"Help!"
>constantly squeaked out after some weirdo picked her up
>you were getting better at kneecapping anyone trying to kidnap her
>escape wasn't possible until you got the parasites out and that Saddler knew it
>you didn't talk that much about it with Ashley
>she was nervous as is
>the mission briefing hadn't covered a lot of this
>so after a while you just ran on instinct 
>Ashley needed help and you had a gun
>simple equation
>you weren't exactly running low on ammo either
>but this job had gotten tougher and it was inevitable that someone would kill you
>Ashley at least was company 
>she was trying to be helpful at least
>she'd bring back ammo or gold if you told her to hide
>ducked out of the way of fire
>you rarely got a break from attacks though
>when you got winged in the arm she acted like you were going to die
>before you could react she pulled you into a rundown cabin
>she had seen you use enough of those herbs and had the first aid supplies out of your case in seconds
>clawed hands deftly pulled your shirt up and she briefly stopped herself before remembering she was attempting to help
>you had managed to briefly buy yourself piece despite the farming tool catching your arm
>that did indeed hurt like hell
>laying back against the wall and catching your breath was welcome
>you noticed Ashley had paused and you looked up confused
>it allowed you to get a good look at the mouse
>a giant mouse
>unusual 
>no one had mentioned Ashley was a giant mouse
>none of the Spaniards seem to make note of it
>Hunnigan didn't either
>you couldn't blame a concussion or anything
>it seemed rude to ask her face to face
>was she blushing? 
>hard to tell through the white fur but she definitely looked skittish in a different way
>not like when you were getting shot at 
>she seemed to notice you noticing and went rigid 
>then her blue eyes went back to your arm and her regular panic returned
>you were surprised she had steady enough hands to treat and bandage the slash
>when you put your shirt back on she looked… disappointed?
>then she remembered the angry Europeans around you all
>thankfully, they hadn't noticed the cabin or decided to attack it at least
>you were shocked when you went upstairs and found a man
>Ashley hid behind you but this one didn't seem hostile
>introduced himself as a police officer 
>commented on the president's daughter's ballistics 
>did he not notice she was a giant mouse?
>you didn't know how to approach that but let Luis talk
>didn't take long for the villagers to notice the cabin after the talk
>the peace and quiet had been shortlived
>they poured in like ants
>Luis was fairly snappy with his gun and you were not slouch yourself 
>your shot gun cleared the ones dumb enough to try the windows
>when that ran out you were taking potshots
>thinking quickly Luis rushed Ashley to a nearby cabinet
>she'd be protected when it got ugly
>yet again the Spainard didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>was it just you being weird?
>no 
>that couldn't be
>the president wasn't a giant mouse
>maybe the first lady had an affair with a rodent?
>a scythe flew over your head and you quickly lost your train of thought to shooting again
>after a tense amount of time they seemed to back off
>good thing too, you would have to see that merchant for ammo
>you called Ashley out and she was so relieved she leapt and hugged your back
>she felt… firm?
>not that you got hugged from behind all that much by women
>you just expected things to be softer
>you wanted to focus on the task at hand now
>pushing your musings back and dealing with the important crap
>Luis laughed
>again, didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>well whatever
>you'd have to part ways and meet again elsewhere
>escape was the main plan, while getting rid of those plagas bugs
>wouldn't do much good to leave while infected
>after parting from Luis you were quickly chased, were they waiting for you?
>you scooped up Ashley despite the protests and carried her bridal style
>you realized too late they seemed to be pushing you towards a creepy castle
>but you had no choice
>the mouse girl felt obscenely warm in your arms as you ran
>she'd given up protesting pretty quickly 
>no idea why, she was very vocal when she wanted to be
>you slid through the gates and instantly felt like the fly in the spider's web
>another weirdo greeted you 
>some manlet once again monologuing 
>you set down Ashley and she hid behind you without a word
>that was a mistake on your part
>because that gave the plagas control a chance
>it was something you didn't notice at first
>but then Ashley had pulled your sidearm and had it pointed at you
>those blue eyes now dull red
>were you too late?
>the midget giggled to himself as the mouse girl maneuvered around you
>the whole time your firearm pointed straight at your head
>was her hand shaking?
>it had to be
>you couldn't be too late
>that parasite would have no reason to not blow your brains out all over this carpet
>Salazar's smugness slowly faded when he must have realized the same thing
>cultists started slowly advancing on you but you didn't want to leave Ashley
>while she seemed to have some control she didn't have total control and she turned and walked past the robed monks
>you hated this
>but you swore you'd fix this
>you dashed across the room, dodging a flail as you ran
>there was a free door in the corner and you hoped you could escape the situation
>you weren't giving up
>not even close
>you were stuck in a running gunfight with the cultists for a few rooms 
>after the chase they seemed to withdraw 
>it had been hectic but you'd bought yourself some peace
>you looted a few of the dead
>the finds were sparse but you did get some ammo and a incendiary grenade out of it
>somehow
>you'd have to figure out how to recover Ashley and escape 
>it just couldn't be too late to save her
>you refused to entertain the idea
>however the new privacy gave you an idea
>you got on the radio to Hunnigan
>things about this situation were bothering you
>you downplayed the current shitshow
>you had to ask it bluntly
>why is the president's daughter a giant mouse?
>Hunningan paused
>"what are you talking about?"
>it was your turn to pause
>so it was unusual
>you quickly recovered and said you must have been mistaken
>"maybe you took a hit on the head? you need to take care of yourself out there"
>yeah it's just brain damage, Hunnigan
>yeah
>well it didn't change your current situation 
>you weren't leaving Ashley to the cult
>whatever the hell was going on you weren't letting that happen
>you took the time to reload and snuck back out
>you made your way through the halls, encountering resistance 
>you gunned down cultists and kept going
>on rare occasions you'd run into a puzzle
>it strained your mind for awhile but you wouldn't let yourself be stopped
>you eventually found yourself a rifle 
>felt good in your hands
>rarely hand any chance to use it
>until
>a massive chamber 
>and below you was Ashley
>still a giant mouse 
>but a giant mouse strapped to a wall
>you breathed deep and took shots at the cultists around her
>you quickly dropped her guards
>she looked up and you were still weirded out by the mouse thing
>at least they didn't harm a golden hair on her head
>you felt relief 
>you ran downstairs to her as quickly as possible
>when you freed her you were surprised
>she pounced on you and you fumbled with your side arm before she pressed her mouth to yours
>the muzzle felt weird but the affection was the first real kindness you'd felt here
>if someone wanted to kill you they could with your guard down 
>at the moment you just melted into the kiss
