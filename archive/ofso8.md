>running the gauntlet through a small Spanish town to find the president's daughter
>sounds easy enough, right?
>just go in and get out
>armed resistance was expected, just not the severity of it
>you had packed accordingly for the mission but somehow things were worse than the briefings explained
>the reception was hostile to say the least
>you'd lost track of the amount of villagers you'd gunned down
>this was unreal
>different than the Raccoon City incident 
>they were smarter
>parasites meant each one was faster and smarter than decaying zombies
>you'd had a few close calls but managed
>recovering weapons as you went helped
>you were getting tired of getting screamed at in Spanish 
>the one friendly face that dude with the trench coat
>he seemed to always be ahead of you 
>but just kept taking money for firearms
>you just assumed shithole village was why he had that rocket launcher
>you wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth
>the trail to Ashley was warm now
>what you didn't expect after finally reaching her was a giant mouse girl screaming "don't come"
>you were pelted with a bunch of junk the second you'd opened the door
>the flimsy debris was swatted aside easily and you were quick to assure Ashley you were here to help
>that seemed to calm her for the moment
>you tried to lighten the mood a little, no doubt the kidnapping had her on edge
>of she even saw half the shit you did that might have her spooked
>when you said you were "cheesed to meet her" that stunned her into silence 
>well maybe not the desired effect but she'd calmed down
>you just needed to get out now
>before you set out you gave Hunnigan a report on Ashley's status
>visually she looked healthy and fine
>a rushed series of questions after reporting to Hunnigan confirmed the giant mouse was indeed fine
>looks like the villagers just scared her a little and nothing else
>whatever the group wanted for ransom, they had at least kept her unharmed
>maybe they really were civilized
>probably easier said than done
>the next length of your journey was quieter
>it felt deathly silent
>now you were really not wanting your cover blown
>you could handle yourself fine but you didn't need to get Ashley in danger
>you headed back through the church and leapt down a ladder
>guiding Ashley to leap down was difficult 
>but through silent coaxing she ended up landing in your arms
>you then both encountered a strange robed man 
>started muttering about America and you barely paid attention until he brought up you both had the parasites now
>those weird bugs hadn't hatched yet but he said it was only a matter of time
>all the smooth confidence of a comic book supervillain 
>his desire to have the girl back was something you couldn't indulge in
>a flash behind you made you realize the monologing was distracting
>robed cultists with crossbows
>you pulled Ashley through a nearby window faster than it would take to say "no way fags"
>Ashley looked genuinely worried and you couldn't lie and say you weren't also really anxious
>if those eggs hatched you'd be no different than those guys with the chainsaws and dynamite running around
>you promised her it wouldn't come to that
>somehow you'd set this straight
>you just didn't know how
>but like hell were you letting some super tapeworm win
>Ashley seemed to warm up to you after that whole bravado act
>you wondered if she was adopted after meeting the human president 
>five foot mouse girls with… ballistics don't just pop up without reason
>regardless of your pondering she clung tighter to you
>her white furred arm hooked on yours as she timidly watched your surroundings
>things were noticeably different with Ashley 
>it was more of a challenge dealing with the same group of crazies now
>Ashley was very vulnerable 
>a fact you were quickly aware of 
>you had to micromanage 
>the one upside was the villagers and cultists seemed to avoid hurting her
>"Help!"
>constantly squeaked out after some weirdo picked her up
>you were getting better at kneecapping anyone trying to kidnap her
>escape wasn't possible until you got the parasites out and that Saddler knew it
>you didn't talk that much about it with Ashley
>she was nervous as is
>the mission briefing hadn't covered a lot of this
>so after a while you just ran on instinct 
>Ashley needed help and you had a gun
>simple equation
>you weren't exactly running low on ammo either
>but this job had gotten tougher and it was inevitable that someone would kill you
>Ashley at least was company 
>she was trying to be helpful at least
>she'd bring back ammo or gold if you told her to hide
>ducked out of the way of fire
>you rarely got a break from attacks though
>when you got winged in the arm she acted like you were going to die
>before you could react she pulled you into a rundown cabin
>she had seen you use enough of those herbs and had the first aid supplies out of your case in seconds
>clawed hands deftly pulled your shirt up and she briefly stopped herself before remembering she was attempting to help
>you had managed to briefly buy yourself piece despite the farming tool catching your arm
>that did indeed hurt like hell
>laying back against the wall and catching your breath was welcome
>you noticed Ashley had paused and you looked up confused
>it allowed you to get a good look at the mouse
>a giant mouse
>unusual 
>no one had mentioned Ashley was a giant mouse
>none of the Spaniards seem to make note of it
>Hunnigan didn't either
>you couldn't blame a concussion or anything
>it seemed rude to ask her face to face
>was she blushing? 
>hard to tell through the white fur but she definitely looked skittish in a different way
>not like when you were getting shot at 
>she seemed to notice you noticing and went rigid 
>then her blue eyes went back to your arm and her regular panic returned
>you were surprised she had steady enough hands to treat and bandage the slash
>when you put your shirt back on she looked… disappointed?
>then she remembered the angry Europeans around you all
>thankfully, they hadn't noticed the cabin or decided to attack it at least
>you were shocked when you went upstairs and found a man
>Ashley hid behind you but this one didn't seem hostile
>introduced himself as a police officer 
>commented on the president's daughter's ballistics 
>did he not notice she was a giant mouse?
>you didn't know how to approach that but let Luis talk
>didn't take long for the villagers to notice the cabin after the talk
>the peace and quiet had been shortlived
>they poured in like ants
>Luis was fairly snappy with his gun and you were not slouch yourself 
>your shot gun cleared the ones dumb enough to try the windows
>when that ran out you were taking potshots
>thinking quickly Luis rushed Ashley to a nearby cabinet
>she'd be protected when it got ugly
>yet again the Spainard didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>was it just you being weird?
>no 
>that couldn't be
>the president wasn't a giant mouse
>maybe the first lady had an affair with a rodent?
>a scythe flew over your head and you quickly lost your train of thought to shooting again
>after a tense amount of time they seemed to back off
>good thing too, you would have to see that merchant for ammo
>you called Ashley out and she was so relieved she leapt and hugged your back
>she felt… firm?
>not that you got hugged from behind all that much by women
>you just expected things to be softer
>you wanted to focus on the task at hand now
>pushing your musings back and dealing with the important crap
>Luis laughed
>again, didn't acknowledge the giant mouse thing
>well whatever
>you'd have to part ways and meet again elsewhere
>escape was the main plan, while getting rid of those plagas bugs
>wouldn't do much good to leave while infected
>after parting from Luis you were quickly chased, were they waiting for you?
>you scooped up Ashley despite the protests and carried her bridal style
>you realized too late they seemed to be pushing you towards a creepy castle
>but you had no choice
>the mouse girl felt obscenely warm in your arms as you ran
>she'd given up protesting pretty quickly 
>no idea why, she was very vocal when she wanted to be
>you slid through the gates and instantly felt like the fly in the spider's web
>another weirdo greeted you 
>some manlet once again monologuing 
>you set down Ashley and she hid behind you without a word
>that was a mistake on your part
>because that gave the plagas control a chance
>it was something you didn't notice at first
>but then Ashley had pulled your sidearm and had it pointed at you
>those blue eyes now dull red
>were you too late?
>the midget giggled to himself as the mouse girl maneuvered around you
>the whole time your firearm pointed straight at your head
>was her hand shaking?
>it had to be
>you couldn't be too late
>that parasite would have no reason to not blow your brains out all over this carpet
>Salazar's smugness slowly faded when he must have realized the same thing
>cultists started slowly advancing on you but you didn't want to leave Ashley
>while she seemed to have some control she didn't have total control and she turned and walked past the robed monks
>you hated this
>but you swore you'd fix this
>you dashed across the room, dodging a flail as you ran
>there was a free door in the corner and you hoped you could escape the situation
>you weren't giving up
>not even close
>you were stuck in a running gunfight with the cultists for a few rooms 
>after the chase they seemed to withdraw 
>it had been hectic but you'd bought yourself some peace
>you looted a few of the dead
>the finds were sparse but you did get some ammo and a incendiary grenade out of it
>somehow
>you'd have to figure out how to recover Ashley and escape 
>it just couldn't be too late to save her
>you refused to entertain the idea
>however the new privacy gave you an idea
>you got on the radio to Hunnigan
>things about this situation were bothering you
>you downplayed the current shitshow
>you had to ask it bluntly
>why is the president's daughter a giant mouse?
>Hunningan paused
>"what are you talking about?"
>it was your turn to pause
>so it was unusual
>you quickly recovered and said you must have been mistaken
>"maybe you took a hit on the head? you need to take care of yourself out there"
>yeah it's just brain damage, Hunnigan
>yeah
>well it didn't change your current situation 
>you weren't leaving Ashley to the cult
>whatever the hell was going on you weren't letting that happen
>you took the time to reload and snuck back out
>you made your way through the halls, encountering resistance 
>you gunned down cultists and kept going
>on rare occasions you'd run into a puzzle
>it strained your mind for awhile but you wouldn't let yourself be stopped
>you eventually found yourself a rifle 
>felt good in your hands
>rarely hand any chance to use it
>until
>a massive chamber 
>and below you was Ashley
>still a giant mouse 
>but a giant mouse strapped to a wall
>you breathed deep and took shots at the cultists around her
>you quickly dropped her guards
>she looked up and you were still weirded out by the mouse thing
>at least they didn't harm a golden hair on her head
>you felt relief 
>you ran downstairs to her as quickly as possible
>when you freed her you were surprised
>she pounced on you and you fumbled with your side arm before she pressed her mouth to yours
>the muzzle felt weird but the affection was the first real kindness you'd felt here
>if someone wanted to kill you they could with your guard down 
>at the moment you just melted into the kiss

>after a brief moment, you pushed Ashley up and got up
>you had no idea why that just happened but you couldn't get distracted
>you almost considered it was a ploy by whatever controlled her 
>but Ashley's eyes were that pretty ocean blue
>the red was gone from them
>she really tried to find anything in the room to look at besides your gaze
>but she wasn't pointing a gun at you
>you asked if she was OK and she relaxed a little
>her body posture 
>"I'm sorry about earlier, it was like I couldn't control myself"
>was this about the gun or the kiss?
>she locked up with an "eep"
>then stammered while trying to look at the carpet
>"shouldn't we get going?"
>the change of subject was obvious but you'd roll with it
>her tail swayed as you bet she mentally hoped you bought it
>you had considered ask her outright why she was a mouse but that still felt rude
>you don't just go and ask that
>the kiss did make you look at Ashley a little differently 
>but that was something you'd have to put on the backburner 
>she did at least still look nice despite the kidnapping and attacks
>you wondered just how she didn't get chilly with that plaid skirt
>maybe that's why she seemed to huddle up to you when you both made your way out to the chamber
>her fur was still silky smooth to your bare arm
>the kiss was still present on your mind
>why did she jump you?
>was it her way of showing gratitude?
>you had kissed a mouse
>you almost didn't notice the cultists 
>almost
>another gunfight ensued
>three more corpses
>but the odds were not in your favor
>you grabbed her wrist and bolted for a small room
>you pushed Ashley towards a cabinet and shoved a desk in front of door
>you felt fortunate that they were super predictable 
>they would try to batter down the door
>you had your shotgun pointed at the door when the banging started
>you waited
>banging intensified 
>the door buckled slightly
>there were more than a few
>and they clearly had hatchets
>more gouges in the door
>you waited
>sweat dripped off you as you mentally readied yourself
>deep breaths
>Ashley was nervous
>she tried to keep quiet behind you but you heard her squeaks everyone other hit on the door
>still, you waited
>you fought the urge to flinch on the strikes yourself 
>instead you just braced the shotgun tightly against your waist
>only when they finally busted parts of the door did you act
>you saw their faces as buckshot hit the crowd around the entrance at center mass
>it wasn't as violent as a headshot but you knocked them back
>you followed it with another shot
>and another
>the door was shredded now
>as were the cultists dumb enough to cluster around it
>so with that small peace you shouted back to Ashley
>you both had to move
>she fumbled out of the cabinet onto her face
>ass up in the air she was instantly mindful of her skirt and she panicked covering back up
>she rose quickly, dusting off her sleeveless orange sweater 
>you two didn't have time so you decided to throw Ashley on your shoulder 
>you had her head bouncing against your thigh despite her very vocal protests
>there was no time to lose and the cultists had to all be on high alert
>you didn't know how the parasite shared information but they'd be here in no time
>your hand was firm above her tail to hold her steady on your shoulder
>the adrenaline had your heart racing a mile a minute and you ignored everything except getting to safety with Ashley in tow
>they had to be trying to bog you down in fights, had to be
>so for now your best option was stealth
>you ran through empty chambers, thankful to hear nothing else
>they would try and trail you two but you hoped to put just enough distance between the last fight and you
>Ashley needed doubt felt this was undignified, alternating between squeaking protests and waving her hands around
>she was light on your shoulder
>that much you remembered
>trouble hit like a freight train when you entered one room
>it was almost like a cage
>you didn't have time to ask for what when you noticed a hulking figure with giant claws
>he was on edge but his back was to you
>some growth on his back, the plagas drew your attention
>before you could react the other door opposite your entryway swung open
>the cultist didn't even know what hit him when the giant leapt and tore into him
>it didn't distinguish between friend or foe 
>you quickly put two and two together
>when you entered you were damn near silent
>this thing must need noise to know what's happening
>that's when you remembered your passenger
>Ashley almost screamed at the new threat but you grabbed her by the back of the head and smashed her face into your crotch to muffle her
>the mouse clawed at your pants at first
>you almost reacted at the little razor sharp things scratching through the fabric
>but past experience had you keeping completely silent
>those claws on the blind creature could do worse than Ashley's 
>the mess of gore on the floor was proof enough of that
>you had the back of her blonde hair gripped tight
>she was mashed as tight against your crotch as possible
>thankfully muffled
>her boots failed and threatened to throw you off balance but you held still
>you'd have only one chance at this
>you'd been saving the magnum for something really special
>the stopping power something that couldn't be matched elsewhere 
>you didn't dare risk the peashooter
>you'd have one shot and then the creature would either be dead or would react
>you weren't confident that reaction would be good for your health
>pressing Ashley tight against you, you used your other arm to line up the shot
>you were about four arms length away
>you'd stilled your breath and readied your body for the kickback
>one shot felt like it would rip your arm from the joint
>but it did the job and the thing died instantly 
>Ashley muffled against your pants brought you back to reality 
>you were about to set her down when the unexpected happen
>in her renewed struggle against your grip something dropped and rolled across the floor
>an orange?
>what?
>or was that a grapefruit?
>now wasn't the time to categorize citrus though
>because the hushed silence and her frozen reaction made you keenly aware of another sensation
>your shoulder was wet through the fabric 
>you were aware this wasn't the best place for this
>however… this was pressing against your shoulder
>you set Ashley down gently and if there was awkward behavior before, this took the cake
>she, no he, stood there with one "boob" 
>the other had rolled out onto the floor
>trying really hard to keep the skirt fabric from tenting
>you shut the one door the cultist had stumbled through
>you two needed to talk
>something the mouse didn't seem ready for 
>was this Ashley?
>you'd had your suspicions since the whole giant mouse thing
>now you find out it was a mouse boy
>what the hell was going on
>what you didn't expect was he wouldn't even let you get a word out
>you were all ready to start asking 20 questions and Ashley stole your thunder by falling against you and start sobbing loudly
>your anger at the deception didn't last long in the face of this
>you felt awkward hugging the mouse but your arms just instinctively went to hold who was crying against your chest
>you really hoped a cultist didn't decide now was a good time
>you didn't say anything initially, >it felt natural to allow Ashley to let it out and you weren't getting answers until everything calmed down
>the embrace seemed to do it
>eventually the sobbing slowed and he relaxed a little
>the huge ears on his head twitched a little at you clearing your throat
>you came out and said it
>why was the president dressing his son in girl outfits?
>it was a strange lifestyle choice
>also second point 
>did Ashley realize he was a giant mouse?
>you ended with the promise you weren't pissed
>more confused than anything
>he needed to give you answers
>especially if you two were going to make it out of here
>"so…"
>the voice was still hushed and a little raspy after the cry
>"I have a confession. I'm not the president's daughter"
>of course, he was a boy
>"no no. I mean I'm maybe not Ashley."
>what
>you didn't see this coming
>but why did the cult kidnap him?
>you were conversing in whispers just in case
>"I was in town where the president's daughter was, wearing the same outfit"
>maybe these villagers weren't really civilized after all
>but the mouse thing
>a tail, giant ears 
>how did they not figure that one out?
>you didn't initially question it but you did find it strange
>"I'd always hear all these cool adventures from my older brother."
>you were wondering where he was going with this and let him continue
>"see he followed these siblings around on all their little escapades. I think he said they were named the Redfields."
>that made you perk up
>but no
>that was too much of a coincidence 
>had to be
>"he even wrote it all down. I just thought it sounded cool"
>he pulled himself against your chest again
>didn't really address the crossdressing 
>or why he was a giant mouse
>but you didn't bother with details
>what he said earlier came back to you
>so they didn't kidnap the president's daughter
>"the whole time they thought I was her and they've never bothered to confirm it."
>so they just nabbed a giant mouse with a penis and grapefruits down his sweater
>and never questioned it
>still haven't questioned it
>maybe the parasite makes them collectively fail to see the obvious
>like a hive mind stupidity
>granted, you rolled with it
>but this was actually good news
>you patted Ashley on the back and said it was OK
>actually, better than ok 
>the president's daughter was off partying somewhere and safe
>this terror organization fumbled and revealed their hand
>all you had to do was get the bugs out of you two and install democracy on this shitty little cult
>you weighed the pros and cons of telling your bosses
>might just play along for the moment
>Ashley had calmed down now
>wait that wasn't right
>what was his real name?
>you'd have to call him Ashley around this area to keep up appearances but you were owed that much
>he huffed against your chest and you remembered how warm he was 
>"I guess you're right. you rescued me. so I guess my knight in shining armor deserves a name. it's Ash, no kidding."
>was he snuggling up to your chest right now?
>so you took mental notes
>the situation wasn't ideal 
>and you had plenty of questions
>you made an executive decision to hold onto the information about the president's daughter
>she was safe as long as they thought this mouse was her
>you pat the back of Ash's hair
>it probably wasn't his real name
>too much of coincidence 
>granted, you didn't know what to think
>so you picked him up delicately and allowed him to stand under his own power
>you two were going to have to rely on one another if you were to get out of here
>you wanted him to really understand that
>you weren't using him as bait for the cultists
>that would imply he'd get hurt
>you clasped your hands on his shoulders and promised him you'd bring him home safe
>that's probably when the trouble began
>because if he wasn't clingy before, he had your arm in death grip now for some reason
>but he didn't seem scared now
>you had no idea why he was holding on like that
>but at least he relaxed
>you'd get more out of him later
>possibly ask why Luis didn't seem bothered by the rodent
>you were about to head out the door when he scrambled away and grabbed his "boob"
>some readjustment and they looked like they could fool anyone again
>now you could leave and Ash took up his place next to you
>you had a strong urge to continue your conversation with your companion
>there was definitely a lot that needed to be said
>but you also needed to sneak out 
>he followed right behind you and you got better at not getting tripped up
>the cultists seemed to be unaware of your presence now and you wanted to keep it that way
>when you got to a strange bottomless pit with platforms scattered to an exit on the other side you breathed in
>you were sure Ashley wouldn't make it himself
>you instead looked over your shoulder and told him to hold onto you
>you'd hopefully jump these piggyback style
>he looked hesitant 
>you smiled and said you promised you get you both through this
>he was in good hands
>that made him shift a little but it won him over
>his slender arms around your neck were warmer and softer than a scarf
>your hands rested on his legs and he didn't protest this time
>while it threw off your balance a little he wasn't really that heavy 
>you both held on tight as you leapt for the first platform 
>your boots landed hard and you recovered quickly
>he squeaked into your ear as you leapt and landed on another platform
>the stones must have been some old bridge
>it was holding up well to every jump
>you managed a few more leaps
>the last jump you nearly missed but Ashley shoved himself forward, giving the momentum to stick it
>he had tightly clutched your neck in a panic
>his legs wrapped around you
>you breathed a sigh of relief and gently set your passenger down
>he withdrew and you noticed he was having to readjust his skirt again
>you paid no mind to the tent he was fighting down
>guys will be guys 
>you got erections at weird times too
>muttering above you in Spanish made you freeze for a second before hugging the wall
>Ashley was surprised when you pulled him towards your chest
>your left hand held the back of his head and the other held his lower back
>poor thing must have been scared because he shivered in your embrace
>you were aware of his erection because it poked against your hip
>he really chose a bad time for it but you'd have to make do
>at least he suppressed any noises but you had his face against your chest for a reason
>occasionally he jostled against you and let out a low noise
>he had to be uncomfortable but until the cultists walked away from the ledge he'd need to stay close
>his arms held onto you though
>not in a panic or anything
>at least he was trusting you now
>when the voices got distant you finally relaxed and released Ash
>he seemed flustered for some reason
>well it was better than the screaming 
>he whispered to you and asked if you'd seen a restroom while running through the castle
>you hadn't 
>it was a weird time for a bathroom emergency 
>he'd have to hold it for now
>at least until you had privacy
>you asked if he'd want to get caught with his pants down
>er, skirt
>that somehow got him more flustered 
>he was weird
>regardless, you both pressed on through the castle
>after the rough start on your journey he was starting to get it
>it wasn't like having a combat buddy but he at least was trying to be helpful now
>even offered to carry ammo and medical supplies
>it was good to have a bigger inventory 
>when you got to your merchant friend he practically lit up
>how the merchant got in here you didn't know but it was a blessing
>you had to gently let down Ash because no, he was not getting a rocket launcher to help you with
>the enthusiasm was appreciated but he hadn't even used a pistol yet
>afterwards the rest of the castle was a breeze
>the usual assortment of cultist swarms, puzzles, giant statue encounters and BOWs you'd come to expect
>amazingly, Ash continued to grow in usefulness and seemed to get braver as you two forged ahead
>maybe not quite ready for a rocket launcher but maybe you'd toss him one of your dinky pistols
>the last encounter with Salazar nearly turned your stomach
>you'd had Ash hide nearby in a crawlspace
>this big fights were still something you didn't want him part of
>after sniping the little napoleon looking weird with what felt like all your rifle ammo he went down
>you both could leave now that your gracious host was a bubbling pile of ooze
>you went back and saw Ash peak out of his hidey hole
>when you offered a hand up he looked at it wide eyed before taking it
>"why are you being this nice? I got you into this."
>this wasn't your idea of a vacation but these guys needed to be stopped
>there was always another Umbrella or another Birkin
>so it worked out
>plus you would have went out of your way to help anyone in this
>you told him to make sure to buy you a beer when this was all said and done
>then you'd be even
>he looked a little bashful so you reassured him by clasping your arm around his shoulder
>you brushed his hair out of his eyes and said you promised and you meant it
>you laughed when he said he needed a bathroom break after all the excitement
>at least you calmed him down
>you said you'd find a spot and scout it out beforehand 
>that way he'd be safe
>you said you had a surprise after and that perked him up
>you saw the castle chambers led into a cave and you were unsure what that would bring 
>couldn't go back out into the village with the numbers they had
>so it looked like the only answer was to go deeper with Ashley
>you found an alcove in the caves and made sure, very sure there wasn't some Scooby-Doo secret door shit
>he looked grateful as he ran in when you gave him the all clear
>you were both guys so you'd just stand outside the gap and keep watch the other way
>he almost objected but you weren't letting him get kidnapped again
>the alcove was about seven feet into the cave, that would be enough privacy
>Ash just had to give a signal he was done and you'd both be on your way
>he finally agreed once he got you to promise to only keep look out, he needed his privacy
>practically had to swear on a Bible
>keeping watch was the calmest time you'd had in a while
>for you
>Ash on the other hand
>well Ash had gotten you to promise not to watch him
>on the other hand he watched you
>the second the coast was clear for him he flipped up his skirt
>he had spent a good portion of the day rock hard about you
>ever since getting shoved nose first into your crotch and all the manhandling
>he'd thought you were handsome before but after seeing you in action and being treated like that…
>well he was crushing hard on you
>and even after he found out you'd lied
>you'd wanted to help
>he muffled his moans with his tail as his blue eyes studied you like dinner
>his hand furiously pumped his red cock, it's angry color contrasting with the white fur around it
>he'd been leaking precum ever since you'd shouldered him and he definitely needed new panties after this
>his brother had bragged about adventure but Ash never considered romance 
>his legs were shaky as he just kept watching you and he balanced himself with his other hand
>fantasies filled his mind
>your breath on his chest as you moved to attack a vulnerable pink nipple with your teeth
>you pulling his hair as you drove your manhood deeper than his fingers could reach
>he imagined how much better your crotch smelled with the pants off
>how tight you could grip the base of his tail as a handle
>you were every inch his hero and you came in and swept him off his feet
>you needed a steed but Ash would have been fine with you mounting him instead
>he wanted to give you your reward
>he knew it was dumb to do it here
>this was all dumb
>but he craved you to look over your shoulder, to see him with his panties down and desperate
>but he didn't want to force it, to bring the attention to himself
>he needed you to want him like that
>he dreamed of that big fat cock you must have and how you could stuff it in him
>he yearned for you to just grab him and bent him over the closest thing and just use him
>mentally he was wondering what he'd call you while he rode that big human cock
>would you growl how much you loved him as you emptied a load in him
>would you bring him along everywhere from then on
>Ash knew how dangerous everything was now and this made him swear to himself
>if you got them through this safe and sound
>he was practically your property 
>the way you handled yourself just fighting all these monsters, it was a thrill
>not the adventure his brother had told Ash years back
>something more primal
>the mouse boy knew he swung of the male team but there wasn't a guy like you before
>he wasn't a whore throwing his ass wherever 
>you were special
>he stared hard at your back while he arched his and shot cum across the alcove 
>he almost collapsed but caught himself
>his heart rate eased down and he could think again
>and he all of a sudden felt embarrassed and quickly covered back up
>a soft voice from behind you cleared his throat
>"I'm all, um, finished. sorry."
>well the break was nice at least
>you turned and there he was looking skittish
>you smiled and said no problem then remembered what you said earlier, the epiphany reading over your face openly
>then you could tell he remembered the surprise and his giant ears perked up
>when you went to pull off your belt his eyes shot wide
>"w-what? what are you doing?!?"
>he squeaked out in a whisper and started to panic for some reason
>you told him to relax, it was part of the surprise
>that seemed to make him more fidgety and he really didn't want to make eye contact
>just a stuttering mess now
>strange
>he froze and slowly looked up when you pressed him back to the cave wall with a hand on his slender shoulder
>then you handed him the belt and holster for your sidearm
>you felt you could trust him with a pistol, perhaps you were too rash earlier to keep him unarmed
>you didn't expect him to almost faint in response, it couldn't be that exciting
