Some say a maid is nothing more than a servant, devoid of ambition or freedom only to dutifully do as they're told. While I am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I’m a chef, a gardener, an entertainer, a guide, spy network, I can be anything you need me to be.

Well, almost anything. I'm deft with a broom not a spear.
