Face: Does your character look friendly? Gaunt face? High cheekbones? Just vague details you'd see at a glance if there are any that might be good to know.
Hair: Describe your hair! If your hairstyle isn't a 1:1 match to the ingame hairstyle this is where you can convey that. Also useful for characters who wear their hair in braids or similar, go ahead and clarify what it'd look like when it's released. How long it is, volume etc. 
Eyes: Eyecolor!
Height: Tall? Short? Medium?
Bodytype: Keep this as vague as you'd like, but if you want to compare your character to a fruit this is where you'd do it.
Complexion: Details on visible skin like face, hands or arms. Scars, moles, discoloration...
Uniform variation: Long skirt? Rolled up sleeves? Scarf? Is it a hand-me down? You get the gist.
Misc: Any visible physical trait not listed goes here.
