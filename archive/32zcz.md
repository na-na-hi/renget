“Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?"

The Beach Boys - Wouldn’t It Be Nice	

~*~

You regained your faculties slowly. Your body was buzzing all over and your heart was pounding so hard your ears could feel it. Everything your eyes met was blurry and unfocused, all the items in the room were merging with each other in a post-sex haze. What you saw to your right could’ve been a book, a toaster, a mirror, a seashell, anything. 

Labored pants came from the lady under you as her hands blindly groped around the bed trying to find you. Eyes closed, your hands meet with hers. In a frenzy, they reach behind your head and bring you down to her lips, where the sweet, sweet taste of wine awaited you. 

Meaty sounds of kisses echo through the room in a desperate attempt to sate an unquenchable thirst. Dry lips, finally finding a drop of water in the middle of the desert. After both of you calm down, you separate your lips and come back to reality.

Under your head, with a lethargic gaze, Fubuki caresses your hair. 

Oh god.

You prompted yourself up and Fubuki drew back towards the bed frame. Her legs slowly regain their movement and you both look at her groin in awe and horror. 

Your sticky white love, oozed from between her legs.

~*~

“Yeah, wouldn’t miss it.” Fubuki spoke as she cracked open a can of beer, the foam sticking to her fingers. She then left the phone on top of the table and grabbed her beverage, giving it a generous gulp. The sweet taste of bitter, cold beer burns her throat. Her free hand grabs the phone again, careful not to hang up. Her mother had babbled quite a bit in the split second she quenched her thirst.

“...-m so glad you’re coming back!” Her mother shrieked through the speaker. 

“M-Mom, it’s only for a couple of days.” Fubuki hides her embarrassment. She walks over to her room and sits on the border of her bed. Her mirror greets her with the image of her in her wife beater hanging by one of her shoulders, and the beer can dangling from her lips.

“You know, Anon said, first thing when planning the wedding, that he wanted to have you over.”

“I know, I know, he called me months ago.”

“You’ve got transport? You need a lift? A bus ticket?”

“I’ll drive myself up there, don’t worry about me.”

“Ahhh! My little Anon is all grown up! Can you believe it?”

“Yeah…” Fubuki gazed into her reflection. The secrets she held within herself made themselves present as parasites feeding off her nostalgia. Time doesn’t feel real. 

“Can’t believe it’s been so long.” She says.

~*~

It was no secret that the two loved each other. Everything they did they had to do it together, from playing, to sleeping, to bathing. No one batted an eye at their behavior, if anything they thought it was cute that the two siblings seemed to share such a profound love. Everything was so innocent, everything was just games, but, despite what the adults might think, the two were way more witty and aware than anyone would’ve given them credit for.

Anon was Fubuki’s favorite person, and Fubuki was Anon’s. From an early age they had developed a bond that was impossible to break, and the curiosity of childhood was mixed with the despondence of adults that often left them to fend for themselves, only having each other to rely on. They slept together in the same bed, naked during the terrible heat waves of summer, and cuddled up against each other to stay warm during winter.

They grew up in the village with the rest of the kids, and they were fiercely possessive of each other. Fubuki got in trouble multiple times for fighting other girls because they confessed to her brother. She thought they would take him away and that she’d never see him again.

They were no strangers to affection, either. Their parents always kissed in front of them, and so they did too. Their mother told them they could kiss, but on the cheek and not the lips. When the unbridled curiosity of childhood demanded a why, the adult responded with ‘Because siblings don’t do that.’

But, sly as they were, they found ways to be quietly rebellious. Telling them they couldn’t kiss only made them long for it more and more.

In secret, they hid where they wouldn’t be looked for, behind the tree in the yard, under the house’s foundation, in the attic, under the bed, anywhere that would give them some privacy. While the adults went about their duties talking, working and so, these two would give each other warm caresses of affection.

Hidden under the bed, amidst the dust, they gave each other little pecks on their lips. Some were short lived like a spark, some lasted like the orange sky during the sunset. Hugs and kisses, innocent little games that developed into more obscene scenarios later.

It was a game at first, it was innocent as are all the acts of kids. The habit of love didn’t break after they grew, although they had become wary of publicly displaying their affection. How could there be anything wrong in what they did? They loved each other, of course! So what’s wrong if the two wanted to kiss and hold hands? Adults are so crazy, so irrational.

A secret kept between the two, between their lips and their hearts. 

And their bodies began to mature, they began to understand the fuzz. 

~*~

Back then life moved at a slower pace. Dad was out of the village working as a contractor. Welding, plumbing, carpentry, skills learned by necessity, perfected by ingenuity. His absence meant that mom would let herself at her vice, and drink until she couldn’t speak a word. 

Fubuki and you were the ones who upheld the household, at least in the domestic sense. Like a married couple, you two had learned to care for the home better than your parents, and learned how to relax while tending to the house around you. Working was second nature, as natural as breathing. 

The countryside hinged on hard work and seemingly endless labor here and there, but when respite came, it came in the form of sweet mundanities to share with each other. Making small-talk while cleaning, cracking jokes during dinner, the sort of uninteresting mundanities that only feel special in the hearts of those who share them.

Tonight, like any other night, Fubuki was sewing your checkered shirt while you were busy moving firewood inside. Had to make the gas last a bit more, especially during Autumn. Dad wouldn’t be back for another two weeks. 

It was a humble home, not to say poor. A small veil of dirt and dust followed you everywhere and footprints were the natural coating of the floor. You had a mental layout of the floor’s creaking boards, various landmarks of trash like scrap metal by the couch, a piece of wood under an old fridge. The pantry’s handles were mismatched, the doors were too big or too small for the doorframes which often resulted in your dad using his handyman knowledge to engineer a solution out of nothing, grabbing loose pieces of board and stitching it to the openings between door and door frame, holding it together with some elbow grease and amateur carpentry. As a result, many doors had “a way” of being opened, like having to be held from a particular spot, or having to be lifted so they wouldn’t scrape the floor.

It was home. It felt like such.

Mom was out to town chugging down bottles of wine and finding a replacement for dad, a man to attend to her needs. Most likely wouldn’t be back. Like many other nights, all you had was each other. 

Fubuki looked at the old digital radio that rested on top of the unused fireplace. The poor thing blew its transmitters ages ago, now its only purpose was to be a clock, using its red numbers to tell the time. 

“Anon!” Fubuki beckoned you from the living room. “Let’s get in the bath, dinner’s up in an hour.”

“‘Kay.” You replied, clapping away the dust from your hands.

Even with your parents away, you kept a tight schedule out of habit. It helped organize the day and make the most out of 24 hours.

You flipped the lightswitch on the bathroom and saw it flash for a couple of seconds before it finally turned on. Nice! That lightbulb had a couple more years of use. Fubuki passed you by and left the towels in the sink.

With that, you two entered the bathroom and began undressing.

There was nothing outrageous about the scene at hand, at least not in your eyes. It’s not the first time you showered together, having lived together your entire life you had seen each other's bodies plenty.

Plus, there’s nothing sexual about naked siblings. At least there shouldn’t be.

Only one year older than you, Fubuki was the first to enter puberty, as girls tend to mature faster than boys. Her body had been adorned with a supple bottom and a modest chest that you had never paid mind to, at least not until today, the fateful day you were just about to discover your sexuality. The day puberty finally made its move on you.

Constant movement and physical activity kept Fubuki’s body shapely, her curves becoming more pronounced as she had taken the first steps to become a woman, and you, the mess of pubescent hormones you were, got a raging boner watching your naked sister scrub her body with the washcloth.

It’s not uncommon for a young boy’s penis to get erect, innocence still held you by her hand. The problem arose when you began feeling strange looking at your sister’s body. It’s your sister, the same girl she ever was. The difference was in your eyes, and the way their gaze touched her.

Naturally, in a conservative household located in the middle of nowhere, education was rudimentary. The handful of teachers you had had in school never paid any mind to the sexual education of the children. Many of your bodily functions were still an enigma to yourself. The thinly veiled mysteries of puberty were being uncovered, but only on a superficial level. You knew something was happening to you, looking at your sister’s angelic body, watching her snowlike hair and her fluffy tail, you just didn’t know what.

Too stunned by the sudden feeling, you took a few moments to realize she was stretching the rag out to you.

“Here.” She said. Flabbergasted, you quickly took it off her hands and scrubbed yourself as you looked away. The water’s cold, and yet your loins are firing up from inside. Your groin feels delicate, it feels sensitive. Lightly brushing it with your hand is causing you to twitch.

“Seriously… you never wash your hair properly. Come here.” Spoke Fubuki.

Without warning, your sister’s fingers find their way to your head. In reflex, you tried to walk away, through the wall if possible, away from this abominable feeling, but all you managed was for Fubuki to jerk you back to her. Her soft breasts now pressed against your back, and her nails dug into your scalp. The burning sensation of your nether regions only amplified, and now went on a violent assault on the rest of your body.

“Fubuki!” You yelped. 

“Huh?”

You turned around with a massive boner between your legs and pleads of solace in your eyes. Fubuki looks at you confused as her eyes try to discern whatever made you so squeamish in the first place.

You hadn’t the courage to admit what you were feeling. It felt wrong to do so, it just did. Fubuki took a good look at your cock and her mouth gaped for a second. Wordlessly, you both stood under the shower head with a red blush in both of your cheeks. For the first time, you two were conscious of your nudity, of your sexes and of your feelings.

Wordlessly, Fubuki rinsed herself quickly. She reached out for the towel on top of the sink and hurried to dry her feet and step out covered by the towel.

Like that, 11 years of bathing together came to a sudden halt.

~*~

You skipped dinner. You hadn’t an appetite, and Fubuki didn’t poke around. You went to hide in your room but found no solace in burying yourself under the sheets. Your loins still begged for you to touch them, to tend to your needs of pleasure. The room felt unsafe. And that was precisely because-

Fubuki came by soon enough and sat on her side of the bed. A shared bed, a single room. Nowhere to hide. A thick silence hung over the room, and Fubuki’s body was dangerously close to yours. Cool winds snuck inside the room, and ushered  you to grab your blanket. 

“Anon… you’re shivering…” She spoke solemnly.

Fubuki’s arm coils like a snake around you. It’s a night like all the ones that came before it. The bed’s the same, the room’s the same. What changed was the ambiance. A thick, uncomfortable silence is weighing you both down. The innocence of childhood laid slain in the shower, its colorful blood flowing down the sewage drain amidst hairs and other gutter trash. All that remained was these two siblings who witnessed its murder.

You quivered at Fubuki’s touch, her hand innocently drawn across your stomach, and then, slowly lowering itself towards your hips. In a panic, you jumped and you sat on the corner of the room, your back to the wall, and Fubuki’s eyes touching you in the darkness.

Not a word was spoken between you two, while Fubuki slowly scooted over to you on her knees. Her hand landed next to your head, and you felt her right in front of your face. The weight almost made you fall between the wall and the bed. 

Curiosity, interest, and a morbid desire to know what she only knew about by hearsay. Boys around the village were brutes, rude and annoying. In contrast, there was a feeling of safety in one’s own blood. 

“C-Can I… Can I touch it?” Fubuki whispered into the darkness, her words swallowed by the nervous breathing coming from you.

The urge to say something, to say “We can’t, we’re siblings!” was at the tip of your tongue, but Fubuki’s touch, Fubuki’s hands, such a familiar feeling, not a displeasing one either. Against your better judgment, you swallowed your scruples, and replied to your older sister.

“Only… Only if I can touch yours.”

Deep into the night, hidden away from the rest of the world, the two began learning just what their bodies were for. They saw themselves with brand new eyes, and an impossible curiosity. A couple of exalted moans reverberated through the room with no one to hear them. A few mishaps happened here and there, a finger being too rough, a grip on your shaft being too tight, but slowly you were getting the hang of it. Labored pants and kisses that became more lecherously personal as the entire ordeal went on cemented the two on a path to depression, a high they would never reach with someone else.

~*~

A week went by unnoticed by everyone, except for you two. Your mother had received some cash from your father, who was still working somewhere in a distant town. That of course, meant that she too would disappear for a bit. 

“Stop by the market in town, get something for dinner.” She said. “I should be back by 6.” 

So, if she wasn’t home by 5, she wasn’t coming back at all. This woman… she only came back for short periods of time. To think that the two of you had cherished the days she spent at the house, and now, you were aching for her to go away.

“‘Kay!” The siblings said in unison. Your mother set foot on the trail donning her warm clothing, and as soon as she was out of sight, you two hurried to your love nest.

Fubuki sat on the corner of the bed and took off her shoes while you undid your pants. Soon as your shoes and Fubuki’s were thrown on the floor, you pounced on her like a hungry beast while she giggled under your torso. Your lips get to business in no time, filling the air with the sounds of busy lovers. A gentle grip of her hips fills your hand, squeamish and submissive, Fubuki lets your hand touch her to your desire, your fingers dig between her jeans and her skin.

“Wait, I want to try something out!” She broke the kiss. With that she scoots away from you and pulls you by the hips, then pulls down your underwear in one go to be met with your stone hard manhood. You kneel onto the bed, Fubuki fitted herself between your legs. You let Fubuki at it, she eyed your cock with puckering lips. An angel’s kiss lands on the head of your cock, and you shiver as Fubuki giggled, her eyes shining with excitement.

“How’d you…”

“I found it on dad’s stash.”

“Those magazines he keeps telling not to touch?”

“Yep.”

“If he finds out…”

“He’s not going to! Just… relax.” Fubuki’s finger grip your member with the finesse of a whore, stroking you with love. And you, her favorite boytoy, let her have her way with you. 

Soon enough, your cock was met with a barrage of kisses and short, curious touches from her tongue. The latter made you pant like a dog in summer, the fleshy appendage shot bolts of pleasure through your body, and Fubuki took notice of it quickly. Her tongue ran in circles around your head, making your legs feel soft and weak like pasta. 

“Oh…” You grunted.

“That feel good?” She said while she kept licking you.

“Yeah…”

“Then…” Fubuki spoke, before your arms pinned her down, and you rotated your body limb by limb to match your head with her hips. Unspoken between the two, but both knew what they wanted. Like telepathy, a skill born out of a lifetime of living together. Just like that, the two figured out the sixty nine.

Fubuki’s crotch was damp when you sank your face into it. While her tongue was beginning to get more comfortable with your cock, you found her licking your shaft up and down. Sharply, Fubuki’s nose drew air as she took in your musk. 

“Hah~!” She moaned.

“What’s up with you and smells?”

“Dunno…” She said before burying her nose in your ballsack and taking another deep whiff. With her put in a trance by your member, you turned your attention to her pussy, her hand stroking her clit in circular motions. You gently brushed it away and licked your lips, unsure what to do. Testing the waters, your tongue ran across her slit, and in that second, Fubuki’s legs locked your head in place as she shrieked.

“Ahaaa~!” 

“H-Hey! Are you okay?” You asked.

“Do that again~!”

So much to learn yet. Even the most miniscule amount of stimuli was enough for your bodies to react exaggeratedly, to vibrate in newfound pleasures. With that, and her thighs locked around your head, you let your mouth at her pussy once more.

Slowly, Fubuki was beginning to take you inside her mouth. First it was your head, although you had to stop her multiple times as soon as you felt her teeth, panicking as you thought that she’d bite it off. She took the hint, and so began hogging your cock with the walls of her mouth and her tongue as cushions. You yourself, were trying to find more spots in her vagina to play with until a little fleshy bulb stood out to you. You spread her lips apart with two fingers, and swallowing her taste of sweat and love juice in your mouth, you licked her right on her flower bulb. Her thighs shook around you, her legs weakened and yet held you harder until it was harder to breathe. The more you licked her, the more it seemed like she would strangle you to death with her legs.

Suck, suck, swallow. Oh, the taste of your sister was delightfully salty, and the way her subtle bush brushed your chin was a nice touch as well. While you ate her out like she would be your last meal, your cock sank deeper and deeper into her mouth with each time Fubuki took you in, another layer of saliva covering it, another glistening portion of your skin, shining under sunlight that peeked from a hole in the wall.

You could’ve easily spent the entire day eating each other out, but no. Since you two had gotten to know orgasms already, and the tiredness that came from them, you were saving it for the big prize, the one thing you hadn’t tried yet. 

On all fours before you, Fubuki swayed her ass from left to right, her tail excitedly wagging. 

The two had figured out what to do, they just had yet to try it.

You lined your head with her entrance, Fubuki’s legs trembled at the feeling of flesh on flesh. You pushed slowly, savoring the sensation, the taste of your sister’s insides. The deeper you moved, Fubuki squealed in pain.

“Ah!” She yelped.

“What’s wrong?!” You took it out.

“It hurts…”

“I-I didn’t… I’m sorry!”

“It’s… It’s okay, girls’ first times hurt…”

“Wh-Why?”

“I don’t… I heard aunt Ao saying something like that…”

“You… want to stop?”

“....No. I… I want you to do it.”

Turning on her back, Fubuki spread her legs wide apart. Gently, you climbed your body on top of hers and gave her plenty of kisses on her mouth to keep her calm. Her hands caressed your back, her nails slightly dug into your skin.

One of her hands drew towards your hips, and gently jerked your cock as it pointed it down towards her flower. You looked down between your bodies as your shaft’s tip disappeared inside your sister. Once inside, Fubuki began grunting and moaning. Tears of pain and pleasure rolled from her eyes onto the sheets. Your lips locked in a kiss as your hips moved forward. You felt your sister’s pained grunts dying in your mouth, her legs trembling as they locked themselves behind your back, never wanting to let go. 

Oh, it felt so good.

“Ha…Haa!” You grunted. It was difficult to push further. You didn’t know it back then, but you had been well endowed for the affairs of lovemaking, and your sister’s insides were being reshaped by you, while her soul was being merged with yours. The more you tried to move, the more she tightened, the harder it was to push or pull.

Connected into one, you grinded against each other, attending each other’s mouths with wet kisses that eventually involved your tongues. Both of your cheeks, red from arousal, were being covered by warm saliva. 

“Does it still hurt?” You asked her.

“Not… not as much… Ha…~” She moaned.

“Fubu-chan… I love you…”

“I love you too!” She said as her mouth assaulted yours. “Mor fan anyfin… Mor fan anyone!” She spoke with her speech muffled by your lips.

As the ordeal went on, Fubuki relaxed, and it became easier to move inside her. That guilty but delicious feeling of pleasure was beginning to reach its summit between your loins.

“Uhi…!” She squealed. “It’s coming… it’s coming…!”

“Fubu-chan…!” You grunted.

“Yes… Yes! Ah-!”

And in quiet, stifled moans, the two squirmed against each other as their bodies shook and let out slow orgasms, your love being shot inside of her as hell walls clamped down hard you.

And you fall to the side, quivering and shaky, while Fubuki’s hips vibrate still, finally your bodies regain control, and you embrace each other in a loving hug, followed by wet, loud kisses.

~*~

That’s how they spent the first few years of their adolescence. At every turn, at every opportunity they hid from the world like they had done a thousand times before, now learning and discovering new things about each other each day. You made love more than you ate, bathed or slept, with a few precautions here and there. 

Each week, Fubuki walked a long road down to a pharmacy that specialized in basic painkillers and herbs that the elderly claimed had magic healing powers -The sort of thing the companies don’t want you to know because it would ruin the business, of course-, but beyond the make believe medicine and rudimentary pills, she began buying packets and packets of condoms. Bareback was the best, sure, but she knew she couldn’t let her brother seed her as they wished. As basic as her education had been, the mysteries of conception were not foreign to her. 

You, on your side, began reading dirty magazines, souvenirs your dad and your uncles kept from their youth as well as watching the pornography they bought in the city for outrageous prices. The people in the videos sometimes slapped their partners, they hit them violently, which turned you away from the medium soon enough. The idea of hitting your sister was horribly evil, but the poses, the movements, the speech, all of the good aspects of it were embedded into your mind, and you gave your sister’s behind no quarter when the time to practice was due. As long as you both enjoyed it, as long as you didn’t get hurt, it was okay in your eyes.

The days that your mother was missing, you’d abandon your duties and prance around the house naked, so that you wouldn’t waste any time having to undress. The entire home was coated with fond memories of lovemaking. The old raggedy couch, the kitchen table with uneven legs, the bed you shared, your parent’s bed, the shower, the rug on the floor, the tree in the yard, they were all witnesses to your secret forbidden love, and the only ones who heard the promises of eternity between your hearts. 

Love was a habit between you two already, sex was only an extra.

Like all good things, this also had to end.

One night, busy prone boning your sister, your dad barged in unannounced. In a panic, you two separated from each other, and covered your nudity with the blankets and your hands.

“Nnnnoooo!” Your dad mumbled. He stumbled about and tripped face first onto the floor. “Browders and sistewrs… they’r not sup-osed to do it…” 

A quarter of a bottle of whiskey ran through his bloodstream, ol’ Jack Daniels rendered him blind to the scene he had seen. The siblings exchanged a panicked look, and after dressing up ,they led their dad to his bedroom, where her mother lay naked on top of the covers.

And onto the bed they threw him, with half his body barely clinging to the mattress. Taking off his coat, his pants, and tucking him in a flash, the two forfeited their father, and heard him fall off the bed as his body loudly landed on the floor.

Afterwards, they couldn’t sleep, and a glass window had been erected between the two. Never again in that household they dared to love each other.

They knew it was wrong, they had always known, almost being caught caused them to loathe what once was a pure and unadulterated joy.

It was always at the back of their throats, in the tip of their tongues, but they abstained from it. The fear, the panic, it undid what they had.

One time that dinner was served, mom asked you to go fetch your sister from your room. You didn’t want to bother her, because you knew she was busy. 

In silence you took turns to use the bedroom and the bathroom, trying to please yourselves away from the other to deal with the unbearable need to embrace each other again.

Maybe tonight…

You didn’t knock, instead, you let yourself in, and saw your sister desperately masturbating while she sniffed your shirt. Your presence didn’t stop her hand, nor did it disturb her. At most, it was a slight inconvenience.

Closing the door behind you, you climbed on top of the bed, and locked your eyes with hers. 

“Dinner’s ready…” You gasped.

“O-Okay…” Her hand kept trying to please herself. 

Her hot breath was right in your face, and her hand kept touching her womanhood, now her pleasure feeling more insipid that it did before. Wordlessly, your lips close the distance, and you lock them in a kiss. 

“Wait-!” Fubuki whispered as your hand reached down to her thighs, her hips jolt up in anticipation. All of her defenses, her protests, they shut down the second your fingers touched her.

Without asking, your fingers dug themselves into her lips, and touched her in all the spots that you knew so well she loved.

“Ha…Ha~!” Fubuki groaned, only to be shut by your mouth. 

Your hand sped up as Fubuki’s arms drew around your shoulders, her mouth and yours relishing in the comfort of each other, knowing that it wasn’t eternal, that they’d be separated again. With a bridge of saliva from your mouth to hers, Fubuki closed her eyes, and quietly orgasmed from your touch.

“Noooo~!” She moaned onto your shoulder. “We can’t…~”

“Why not…?” You whispered into her hear.

“Because….”

“Because we’re siblings?”

~*~

The opportunity to leave the nest came first to Fubuki when she turned 17. A scholarship one of her teachers had arduously worked the contacts for was in place. With some funding from the government and the rest by her proud parents, she would be going to the city to build her life.

The last day she saw Anon, was right as she got in the bus, their eyes exchanging a silent and depressed goodbye.

And so they parted ways. A decade went by in the blink of an eye. The memory of their lovemaking was distant, but not enough for them to forget. 

And life became a static, buzzing TV.

They tried to fill the void with vacuous and worthless lovers, with destructive and harmful vices. Alcoholism ran in their blood. Fubuki hadn’t orgasmed by a man since her brother, and Anon kept trying to find a spark in a woman that would remind him of his sister.

But there was no way to sate their thirst. They longed for a feeling of home, for an emotional that no one could provide.

One perfectly mundane afternoon, Fubuki received a message from her brother.

He was getting married, and he wanted her to be present.

~*~

The reunion was simple, but not uncomfortable. Her car parked outside and familiar faces came to greet her. Mom, dad, the old dog who just wouldn’t kick the bucket, neighbors. She walked inside her home and saw her brother and his soon to be bride chowing down rice, eggs and tomatoes.

Like all siblings do, they greeted each other with the love language that is only inherent to them.

“I didn’t ask for a bachelor’s party whore.” You said. 

“Oh, so this is the home of the retard.” Fubuki quipped back.

And after that bit of playful banter, you got up from your seat and rushed to her arms in a warm embrace, happy giggles coming from both of your mouths.

“How the fuck have you been, city-schlicker?” 

“Better than you, that’s for sure!”

A decade behind you both, and yet it felt like you hadn’t seen each other since yesterday. Family bonds make a man feel close to his loved ones wherever he is.

You introduced Fubuki to Yui, your bride. They exchanged overly formal greetings as women tend to do, and with that she sat down at the table as you served her a plate of rice.

The usual questions lingered on the table, like the little pests they are. This and that, he and she. Your eyes averted Fubuki’s and she averted yours. In secret, they gave each other brief flashes of guilt, wondering what was left of their life together.

~*~

The wedding, due in two weeks, would be held in a nearby farm, owned now by the son of the man who you used to work for in your youth. He offered himself the second he heard you were finally tying the knot after many disastrous and vacuous loves that came and went. Small, tight knit communities are like that.

The time spent before then was filled with airs of joy and nostalgia. You and Fubuki spent the days catching up, visiting rivers and forests that you used to frequent as kids, and pretending there wasn’t an unspoken subject between you two.

Much to Fubuki’s surprise, Yui didn’t seem to know you at all. She got your favorite foods wrong, including the recipe of onigiri that she used to make when she lived there. Many of these little details were surprises to Yui, and all her husband did was confirm that Fubuki was right.

“Geez, you’re marrying me!” She joked with a hint of indignance. 

“Don’t rub it in…” Fubuki strangled her mentally.

Aside from their bickering, it was pleasant.

It was magical to have your sister by your side once again, now turned into a beautiful woman that made the villagers turn their heads as she passed, constantly getting asked if she was indeed, the little girl they had once known. A few invitations landed at her ears, to be introduced to men and elders alike, but she turned them down. Her mother in turn, vehemently asked her when she would be getting married herself, to which Fubuki answered ‘When I find the right one.’

~*~

And so the day of your wedding came. Everyone left for the farm early, wishing to set up everything. Your neighbors insisted that you stayed home and prepared yourself ‘To kiss your freedom goodbye.’ with a playful snark.

Yui was in her own home getting ready. From her nails to her eyelashes, everything had to be perfect down to the last minute detail.

Meanwhile, you stood before a mirror in your room while Fubuki fixed your suit. 

“How can you not know how to tie a tie?” She snarked.

“Never needed it, never cared.” 

“Well, you should’ve.” She did the knot for you.

The reflection depicted an elegant man, with a body well toned by the labor of the countryside, and to his side, his slim sister wearing a more formal sky-blue dress for the occasion that reached just above her knees.

“Can’t believe it’s been so long…” You growled.

“Yup… And yet, this room remains the same, doesn’t it?”

“Haha, yeah, it does.”

Your eyes locked with each other, Fubuki’s fingers playfully cleaned your suit from bits of fluff that dirtied your almost perfect look.

Oh, her eyes haven’t changed one bit.

Your hand caressed her cheek, giving Fubuki a soft giggle in her heart. Her arms involuntarily locked behind your head, and wordlessly, your fate seals in a fugitive kiss.

It was innocent enough at first, and it would’ve remained so if it stopped at that. But, both of your mouths agape, your lips draw closer again, and a delightfully meaty kiss echoes through the room.

Silently, Fubuki walks backwards and sits on top of the bed. You look for approval in her eyes, with which she fidgets before you lean over her. An exalted moan escaped her lips as her back landed on the mattress. She plays with your hair, with your cheek, and suddenly you’re having at each other’s lips like all those years before. A light rekindled, a passion reborn.

“Wait…” Said Fubuki as she undid the knot she had made a couple of seconds ago. “We can’t.”

“Why not?” You brushed her hair away from her face, her fingers walked along your face and then settled on your shoulders. She gripped them with a gentle strength 

“Because… You’re getting married, you adulterous traitor~”

“I know…” You held her gaze in yours.

A short silence was followed by innocently guilty giggles. It was at the tip of their tongues.

“You’re not going to say it?” You said.

“You haven’t said it either~”

“Because…”

“Because we’re siblings.” Fubuki’s hand reached for yours, and in a warm embrace, your fingers intertwined.

“You know~” She spoke, a sultry tone coating her words. “I’ve never cared for it. Never~”

“And why’s that?” Your mouth reaches down towards her, playfully biting her lips as her hands hurried to undo your shirt and get a nice hold of your body.

“I’ve never fallen in love with anyone else.” Fubuki‘s hand gripped yours, and you returned the gesture.

Like that, she aimed for your exposed neck, her fangs denting your skin with territorial intent and playful invitation. Meanwhile, your hands got a hold of her curves. Time was of the essence and yet, you took your sweet time exploring the bodies nature had given you. You marveled at your physiques. Fubuki’s legs tingled as her fingers felt your strong complexion, your well defined and ample shoulders and forearms that put weightlifters to shame. Meanwhile, you felt yourself salivate like a dog at Fubuki’s elegantly modest yet plentiful curves, a well toned, meaty pair of buttocks, a generous chest, and a pair of beautifully defined legs. You were rediscovering your bodies like you did the first time puberty showed you how truly different you were, and yet, it felt casual and homely. Your heartbeats, your eyes’ kind and gentle sparks, the confident hands and mouths that know exactly what to touch, where to pinch, where to kiss and suck. 

You two were falling in love all over again.

You lifted Fubuki’s dress up to her waist, and saw her white panties darkened by a moist stain. As your finger dug itself between her skin and the waistband, Fubuki freed your cock from your pants and boxers.

“Hah~!” She marveled herself. Playfully, you thrusted with your cock above her until your testicled hit her perineum. The tip of your cock reached up to her belly button, where her fingers made quick work of you by jerking you from top to bottom. 

“Give it a kiss?” You smirked. Fubuki pouted at you with her eyes.

“No… There’s no time.” She lifted her legs up and by instinct you lifted her underwear, biting your lips at how it came off, how it revealed with obscene detail her pretty pink pussy with her white bush. Her panties dangling from one of her ankles, you moved back and lined your cock with her entrance.

“Ha~” She moaned. “Come on! I’ve been waiting years for this…”

Wordlessly, you pushed yourself inside, now her body ready to take you all the way in. 

“Ah!” You grunted as she clamped down on you.

“Yes!” She moaned as her eyes rolled back into her head.

You panted like a dog in heat, Fubuki’s vibrated and shook around you, and with the sly eyes of a fox, she beckons your mouth in place. Hand in hand, mouth in mouth, heart in heart.

No place like home.

You push forward, and begin fucking your sister with no care for the sound of the old shabby bed hitting the wall. Frenzied pants and moans echo through the room. Oh God, it’s been so long since you’ve felt this good having sex.

“Feels so good…” You moaned. “To be home…”

“I missed you… I missed you so much…” Fubuki whispered. 

“Oh fuck…!” 

“Remember when you made me a woman?” She dug herself on your shoulder, and let herself nibble on your ear playfully. In turn, your hand reached under her body and grabbed her between her back and her neck.

“Oh yeah… I’ve never… I haven’t forgotten.”

“When I touch- Ah~! When I touch myself I think of how you fucked me.”

“Oh God…!” You grunted. Your rhythm becomes faster and more violent. What’s a bride to you? You’ve been married to Fubuki in your heart since forever. 

“Oh Anon, harder, harder! Ah~!”

You’ve got to make this quick! Someone could come looking for you two any second!

Your cock slipped out, and as you prompted yourself up, Fubuki’s feet rested atop your shoulders. She smiled at you with sin on her face, a pleasurable and beautiful sin. Playfully mad at her cocky grin, your hands grabbed her ankles and pushed them down towards her head. 

“Ohoho~” Fubuki smirked. “Getting rough?”

Your thumb found itself inside her mouth, greeting Fubuki’s tongue as it slid out in mockery. Her hand walked on your arm, and gently touched your cheek.

“Come on Anon…” She said as your thumb exited her mouth. “Do it… I… I want to be yours forever.”

It was hard to find a comfortable position with these pants hanging between your knees, but after those words, you found a way. 

You put it in, your lips locked with your sister’s, and you kept thrusting like an animal while all the feelings you had pent up slowly showed themselves in the form of kisses, of caresses, of unspoken words of love expressed through your bodies.

The summit of pleasure drew near, and you both felt it. Like telepathy, you knew exactly what was going to happen. You wanted to pull out, but no, you’ve waited years to be reunited with your one true love, and you wouldn’t let it go to waste.

“Fubuki…” You spoke into her ear. “I want to…”

“...Do…. Do it!”

With her approval, your hips hardened their thrust, and like that,

you came inside your sister, filling her up until your cum overflowed her cunt and dripped onto your sheets. You topped off the shared orgasm with a ferocious kiss and a couple more thrusts. Your hands fell to the sides of her head, and Fubuki’s legs shook as they held you in place.

~*~

“Ugh…” Fubuki grunted. 

“What’s wrong, dear?” Her mother asked, seated next to her.

“I really, really gotta go to the bathroom…”

“Agh, you should’ve gone earlier!” She quietly berated her. “You can’t get up now, it’s rude!”

Anon’s bride walked towards the altar, where her husband waited with his suit fixed in a haste and his hair unbrushed.

“I know…” Fubuki smirked.

Her legs tingled. A slimy, sticky liquid was starting to drip onto her legs.

A couple of months went by. The honeymoon was over, and now, thanks to some contacts your wife had, you managed to land a job as a welder in the city, and you’d work your way up from there. The clean air, the quiet afternoons and the nice demeanor of the neighbors would be abruptly swapped with the loud honks of cars, the impossibly short mornings and the cold, frigid attitude of uncaring city dwellers.

“Honey! Let’s go!” Yui hurried you to get inside an old Nissan that was supposed to carry you all the way to the city. A gift from your father, although it was more scrap than car by this point. 

And most importantly, to Fubuki’s apartment. Of course she offered herself to house you two, even if it was for a little while.

“We’re going now.” You texted her.

You put the phone back in your pocket and headed for the toilet to have a piss before you left. Your phone buzzed. Taking it out and turning it on, you saw that Fubuki had sent you an image. 

“I’ll be waiting.” Said the text, and under it, an image of your sister knelt in front of a mirror, with her shirt drawn above her tits hanging about.
