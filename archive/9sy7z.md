#Togetic's Various Guild Misadventures

[TOC2]

## Storehouse Organization

*(Alright, and this box should go... Here!)*

I place a box of cotton and other bedding materials in a corner of the storeroom, making some dust fly up as it hits the floor, which would make me cough if I hadn't gotten used to the dust in the air from organizing this room for the past few hours. 

*(Damn, I'm starting to get tired. How much is there left to organize...?)*

Looking around the storeroom, I can see I've made a decent amount of progress, but there's still a large amount of clutter all over the storeroom that I haven't even begun to organize. Finally taking a moment to relax, I notice how dark it's gotten, and how the room's scattered oil lamps now fail to reveal the full extent of the mess to me.

*(... I might've gotten a bit too carried away, it must be midnight or early in the morning by now. It'll take me days to clean up this **WAR CRIME** by myself. But who else could I trust to join my righteous cause? Well, I'd need someone with arms, so guess Wooper can't help. Chespin's vines would be useful. Maybe the Guildmaster has telekinesis? Both of those two will probably be too busy to help though... Oh, what about that Duskull? Elm, I think his name was. I should try asking him, having someone else who can fly would be helpful...)*

A large yawn overtakes me and interrupts my thoughts. *(So tired... I can probably just use some of the bedding here to take a nap...)* I lethargically grab some cotton bedding from one of the boxes I just organized, and make a makeshift cushion for me to sleep on. Once it's done, I flop onto it and feel the day's work catch up to me.

*(I'll try getting someone to help me... Tomorrow... Zzzzzz....)*

"... getic...."

"... Togetic..."

"Togetic, WAKE UP!"

"Mmrph... F-Five more m-minutes... Dewott... Zzzz..."

"Dewott? Oh forget this, I have a better idea."

Barely cognizant, I hear some rustling and a light thud next to my ear. Then my eardrums are burst by the start of an unfortunately familiar song.

**"EIGHTEEN NAKED COWBOYS AT RAM RANCH-"**

All at once I'm awake, clutching my skull trying to get my ears to stop ringing. "Urgh! What the h-hell!?" I rub my eyes and look around, and see a giggling Duskull in front of me. "O-Oh, i-it's you. Ow..."

"Sorry, I just couldn't help myself from playing a little prank. Try waking up a bit faster next time."

"Y-Yeah... Sorry..." *(Prick. Now I'm FOR SURE getting this guy to help me organize this room.)* I slowly get up and stretch my arms while letting out a loud yawn. Looking around, I notice the thing he placed next to my head that RAMMED and RANCHED my eardrums, which is a small glass vase.

"That's a frism." Elm floated over to it and picked it up. "I've already pranked some other guild members with it, just consider it another part of guild initiation!" 

*(Gee, this really makes me feel like a real guild member now.)* "T-Thanks... U-Um... W-What time is i-it?"

"It should be just past midday, you've been snoozing for a while. I was watching you organize last night, you certainly got very... Passionate about it."

"I-I get like that s-sometimes..." *(From the choice of song, I can assume Elm's a human as well.)* "Um... A-Are you a h-human too?"

Elm nods. "Still adjusting to becoming a pokemon?"

I shake my head. "M-More just a-adjusting to being here... Erm... W-Would you... Uh... W-Want to help me o-o-organize?"

Elm rubbed the back of his skull bashfully. "Heheh, I assume it's the least I can do to apologize for waking you up like that."

*(Perfect. Time to work him to the bone-)*

"Just try not to work me to the bone!" Elm started giggling to himself once again.

*(FUCK, my puns...)* I sighed. "W-We should start off by o-organizing any loose items o-on the f-floor..." 

Elm nodded in acknowledgment. "And then what, just stack them all up in a pile?"

"A-A neat one, y-yes. O-Once all small loose o-objects are c-collected, w-we can focus on organizing t-them into various b-boxes and cabinet-ts."

"Alright, let's go!" Elm floated off and started picking up various small objects from the floor, and I did the same. After about half an hour of organizing, we've cleaned up the floor a substantial amount and made a tidy pile of items. 

"G-Good work so f-far, Elm." *(Glad to see the little prankster can actually do something useful.)* "Y-You can t-take a b-break now i-if you want... I-I can finish organizing the p-pile from h-here."

"Don't worry, I'm not even tired at all yet. Just tell me where we should start placing stuff."

"A-Alright..." I then explained the various boxes and cabinets I had placed and how I planned to organize them, and we started organizing all of the different seeds we collected from all over the storeroom first. While doing this, I passed by a mirror and couldn't stop myself from taking a look at my reflection. I never really had the chance to get a good look at myself after evolving, so I take the chance to examine myself.

*(Wow, I look like shit. My eye bags are really big, and I still have those bandages...)* I moved my hand to touch the large bandage that was still on my head, which made the wound sting a bit. *(Ow, still hurts. I'll probably need to wear this for a while.)* 

I could see Elm peeking over my shoulder in the reflection of the mirror. "Doing some self-*reflection*?"

I ignored his pun, mad that I didn't come up with it first. "N-No... J-Just still not u-used to being e-evolved."

Elm tilted his head inquisitively. "So you've been a pokemon for a while then?"

I turned to him and nodded. "I-I was on a t-team b-before j-joining the guild... H-How about y-you?"

Elm turned his gaze to the mirror. "I only recently became a pokemon, but so far, I couldn't be happier. I..." Elm's cheery tone faltered for a moment. "I felt like I need another chance at life, and coming here has let me finally be the person I couldn't be in the human world."

*(Must be nice. Meanwhile I'm stuck here with the same problems I had as a human.)* 

Elm must've noticed my internal sulking, as his expression shifted to look more upbeat again. "Oh, I just noticed, you don't have a badge yet. You should probably pick one out while we're here."

I looked at myself in the mirror again. He was right, I hadn't picked out a badge or any clothes yet. I've noticed that a bunch of different guild members had been wearing stuff like bandanas, Elm himself was wearing a purple headband with his badged attached to it. *(Hmmm, I never really felt the need to wear any clothes when with Dewott. What should I wear...?)*

Before I could finish thinking, Elm tapped my shoulder, and as I turned around I saw he was holding a guild badge and a blue bandana.

"Why don't you try these on?" I took the items from Elm, and began wrapping the bandana around my neck. Then I attached the clover-shaped badge to the middle of the bandana.

I take a few moments to look over my new outfit in the mirror. *(Huh. Not bad. I've never cared much about my own personal fashion, but this looks nice. Wonder why he decided to help me out with this though, I guess ghost-types are just like dogs and they sort of just do things arbitrarily.)*

Noticing me smiling at my newly-clothed reflection, Elm looked pleased. "Now everyone will know you're one of us!"

"F-For better or for w-worse." We both chuckled. For the first time since going out on my own, I felt I was around someone I could trust. *(I haven't felt like this since I was back with Dewott... Maybe I was wrong to ever have my guard up around here.)*

"Erm... Elm?"

"Yeah?"

"T-Thanks for a-all of the h-help you've g-given me... Uhh... I-I just... Uh... W-Want to s-say that... I-I t-think you a r-really n-nice pokemon, a-and I want you to h-have this!" I trust a small package that I had boxed while organizing towards Elm, who looked like he was trying not to blush from the sudden compliment and present.

"Oh, thanks! I wonder what's in here..." Elm quickly opened up the small box, [and the moment he looked inside...](https://rentry.org/8pirs)

## Training!

"Yawn..."

I let out a loud yawn as I get up and stretch my arms. I'm in my room, currently sitting on my makeshift bed with a warm blanket over me. Rubbing my eyes, I can see that it's still dark outside.

*(Damn, must be the middle of the night. My sleep schedule's fucked due to all of the storeroom work... Ugh...)*

I flop back onto my bed and cover myself back up with the blanket, in an attempt to fall back asleep.

*(... Okay fuck this, I'm too awake. I need to tire myself out a bit.)*

I toss off the blanket and climb off the cushion while doing a large stretch. *(Hmmm... I could go back to fixing up the storeroom, but then I'd probably be unable to make myself stop working until I drop from exhaustion again... I should do something a bit lighter. Some training maybe?)*

I stared at my own hands. *(I'm so weak on my own that training won't do much, but at least it might wear me out a bit so I can go back to sleep.)* Sighing, I open the door to my room and exit into the hallway. *(I could use the training room, but it's a nice night tonight, I'll head to the docks. Less chance of someone walking in on me there too. Hopefully.)*

Carefully sneaking out of the guild, I enter the streets of Capim Town. Various lamps light the roads, but the moon in the sky does much more to illuminate the town. The streets are mostly empty, apart from some random pokemon wandering around that I can barely make out the shadows of. 

*(I haven't had much chance to explore the town since coming here, I've mostly stayed cooped up in the guild. Maybe I should try for an aerial view?)* 

I do a small leap into the air and flap my wings, sending me flying upwards towards the stars in the sky. Once the momentum wears off, I flap my wings more lightly to maintain my position in mid-air. *(Still need to get the hang of flying... Let's just do a nice glide to the docks.)* I re-orient myself so my back faces the sky, and tilt my body downwards slightly to glide down. I glide over the town's roads and houses, with the lights becoming a blur as I start to pick up speed against the cool night wind.

I flip myself around so my chest faces the sky, and let the stars of the night sky wash over me. *(The stars and town are beautiful out here at night, I should explore it a bit more. Would help me get betting at flying too-ACK!)*

**SPLASH**

I landed back-first into the water, and panicked for a second trying to get myself upright. After a bit of flailing and splashing around, I'm treading water with my head just above the waves. I shake my head to try and get some water out of my ears.

*(Ugh... I need to pay more attention sometime. Lets just swim to the dock-)*

My thought is interrupted by a large splash of water in front of me! The water splashes into my eyes, and after wiping them I see what caused the commotion. It's an Oshawott, and one I think I've seen before at the guild. 

The Oshawott swims up to me. "You okay? You didn't look like you were intending for a splash-down."

I shake my head. "I-I... D-Didn't check w-where I was f-flying."

"It's alright, need some help getting back onto land?"

"I-I t-think I-I'll be f-fine..." I tread water a bit harder to get my back and wings out of the water, then wiggle my wings to get some water off of them, and then give him a large flap to lift me out of the water. Once back in the air, I land on the nearby pier. The Oshawott dives under the water, then jumps out of the water like a dolphin and lands right next to me.

"I'm Gus." Says the Oshawott as he adjusts the scallop on his chest. 

"T-Togetic. N-Nice to m-meet y-you." I say while bowing. 

"No need to be that formal. What are you doing out here?"

"I... U-Uh... O-Originally w-went outside to t-train b-but got m-mesmerized b-by the night s-sky..."

Gus smiles. "You like looking at the stars, too?"

I nod, and then walked to the edge of the pier to sit down, and Gus sat next to me. For a while, we just stared at the stars in silence, letting the sound of the waves wash over us. Neither of us seemed to want to break the silence with idle chatter. However, our peaceful moment is interrupted by the sound of footsteps. I get up and turn around, and see a Sneasel walking towards us. 

Waltzing up to me, the Sneasel appears to size me up before she finally says something. "So you're that Togetic that joined the guild."

"Y-Yeah... H-Hello..." *(... What's with the cold stare? She is an ice type but she's freaking me out.)*

Stepping closer, she forces me to look up as she towers over me. "... You know, I heard some interesting rumors a while back. Something about a powerful duo of a Togetic and a Dewott that went around beating up outlaws within an inch of their lives... And other exploration teams, as well, robbing them of their supplies."

My heart stopped. *(No.... I escaped all that! Why-)*

"... But there's no way that's you, considering how weak you look!" She chuckles and backs off. "I'm just messing with you. I'm Sneasel. Glad to finally have the chance to meet you."

"U-Uhrm.... Y-You t-t-too...." *(What the fuck.)*

I can feel my heart finally starting to beat again, and I notice her face has changed to a much more cheerful expression with a large smirk, but the same doesn't apply to her eyes, which continue to hold the same suspicious glare.

*(Oh god. This is some sort of test, isn't? She's going to fucking gut me right here if I don't answer right. I guess this is finally the time to see if I can really trust my fellow guildmates.)*

I take a deep breath. "W-Well... A-Actually... I... Uh... E-Erm... Y-You're..."

Sneasel raises an eyebrow. "I'm what?"

"... Y-You w-were r-r-right... I-I was o-on a t-team with... a D-Dewott..."

Sneasel steps back in shock. "What? Are you serious?"

I nod while staring at the ground. There's an awkward silence, but I don't dare to look back up at her.

*(... Well, she hasn't stabbed me yet. Maybe she can't tell if I'm telling the truth? Fuck, what do I-)*

My inner ramblings are interrupted by a weird sound I hear from Sneasel. I finally decide to look up, and see her covering her mouth with her claws, holding back laughter.

"Pfft... Bwahahaahaha!" She finally lets loose and nearly falls backward onto the ground from how hard she laughs. "Oh, you're hilarious! I almost thought you were telling the truth for a second, but you look like way too much of a weakling to ever be a part of some infamous team like that."

*(I should probably just take this chance to lie here... But if she finds out later... Fuck it, full honesty. I don't wanna constantly worry about getting shanked by this insane psycho bitch in the future.)*

"... I-I'm not j-j-joking. The rum-m-mors a-are true... W-We d-did beat up-p-p a l-lot of p-pokemon pretty b-badly..." I take another deep breath in a futile attempt to calm myself. "S-Sorry i-if... W-We h-hurt one of y-your f-friends..."

Sneasel's laughter stopped, and her face once again contorted back to its original suspicious glare. "So, what are you doing here then? Tired of stealing from other adventure teams? Oh, I get it! That's why you're in the storeroom all the time." She steps closer to me once again, and I once again stare at the ground, both too afraid and ashamed to face her. "You're stealing stuff from the storeroom, aren't you? Well, I've only got one thing to say to the likes of you..." 

*(Well, at least God can't say that I never told the truth.)* I close my eyes as I prepare for the worst.

"... Can I train with you?"

*(What.)* "What." 

"I mean, obviously you aren't a good guy, but every rumor I heard described you and your partner's fighting style as amazing! You two defeated pokemon that should've been much stronger! C'mon, give me some good tips and I promise I won't tell anybody about your past!"

*(... She... Just wanted... Fighting tips?! This girl is even crazier than I thought. )*

She kneels down in order to be at eye level with me. "Sorry if I spooked ya', but I just gotta know your secrets! Do you have some kind of secret move? Secret aura powers? Oh, do you trick your enemies into underestimating you since you look and sound so weak?" 

*(I'll take that as a compliment, I think.)* "U-Uh... N-None of t-that... I-I'm sorry, b-but... I-I can't t-train you..."

"Aww, why!? Give me a reason, at least!"

*(I don't mind training, But... Do I truly want to get stronger? Chasing power... That's one of the things Dewott wanted, and what almost got us into a lot of trouble. I guess it couldn't hurt to see why this girl wants to train.)*

"W-Well... W-What d-do you w-want t-to g-get s-stronger f-for?" Feeling a bit more relaxed, I sit down on the dock, and Sneasel decides to take a seat as well.

"Well, cuz... I just need to get stronger. I never want to have to run away from a fight again. And more recently... I have someone I want to protect." She looks off towards the guild. "It's not just for my own sake anymore."

I close my eyes and ponder her words. *(Someone to protect... Oh, she must mean that Rimbombee that's always hanging around her. I've heard other guild members say he's completely useless in combat, I guess she must be carrying the weight of their team. Reminds me of me and Dewott...)*

I open my eyes and faced Sneasel. "T-The one you w-want to p-protect... W-Would you f-fight t-t-to the e-end-d-d f-for them? Even if t-they c-couldn't d-do the same f-for y-you?"

Sneasel locked eyes with me and instantly replied. "Without a second thought."

*(Wow, she's...)* 

"Y-You're... U-Um... Really fucking **stupid**." 

Sneasel is taken aback by my sudden outburst. "... What did you just say to me?"

"Exactly what I said." I flap my wings to quickly make myself stand up. "You're a complete **MORON!** You think strength is just fighting until your body can't fight anymore? You think strength is defending helpless friends? You **REALLY** think strength is dying for your friends, leaving them without you?!" Unable to hold myself back, I get up into her face. "What's that little **useless** bug friend of yours going to do if you fuck up during a fight? Use a *dinky* little slingshot to defeat ferals? Hah! Any mistakes **YOU** make in a fight would doom your partner as well!"

Sneasel jumps backward with a growl. "Don't you dare say those things about Booker, he's doing his best to get stronger, unlike a weakling like you who refuses to train!"

*(I know I shouldn't be doing this, but she's really getting on my nerves!)* "Alright then, I'll give you your **damn** training lesson! **GUS**!"

Gus, who had been silently watching us talk from the end of the pier, jumped up as I called his name. Startled, he replied, "Uh... What do you want me for?"

"You're going to be *my* partner for this sparring match. Make sure I can **trust** you, got it?!" Gus is shocked by my sudden assertiveness, and seems too scared to argue with me.

"A-Alright, I'll fight with you!" Gus grabbed his scallop from his chest and locked eyes with Sneasel. 

Sneasel put her claws on her hips. "Two versus one? This isn't fair."

"Why don't you call **Booker** to be your partner then? I'm ***SURE*** that'll make this fight eve-WHOA!" I'm cut off by an ice shard flying inches away from my face, it was so close I could feel the freezing air around it graze my skin. Looking back at Sneasel, I see her dashing towards me, with another ice shard ready in one of her claws!

I do a roll to the side which sends me flying off the pier, and I use my wings just in time to stop me from hitting the water. Hovering in place, I see Sneasel preparing to throw another ice shard at me, but Gus decides to go in for a slash with his scallop, shattering the ice shard in Sneasel's claw!

"**NICE ONE!** FOLLOW IT UP!" Gus looks at me for half a second and gives me a quick nod, and follows up his attack with more scallop slashes that force Sneasel to block them with her claws. She seems hesitant to make an attack against Gus, which I assume is because she only really wants to beat me up, not Gus. However, her patience runs out and she easily deflects one of Gus's slashes with a slash of her own, which sends his scallop flying into the air!

*(Shit, he's defenseless against her claws without that!)* I flap my wings as hard as I can, gliding across the surface of the water while keeping my eyes locked on the scallop flying through the air. I position myself under it, and flip myself around to catch it right before it would've landed on my chest. *(Perfect!)* I fly up and look back towards the dock, and see Gus struggling to dodge Sneasel's claw swipes. 

"**OVER HERE!**" My yell grabs both Gus and Sneasel's attention. I thrust Gus's scallop in front of my head, and send myself flying like a missile straight at Sneasel. She covers her face with her arms to brace for impact, but right before I'm about to collide with her I orient myself upright and flap my wings, stopping my momentum for a successful feint. I quickly toss the scallop back to its rightful owner, and Gus seizes the chance to slash Sneasel in the side while she's still covering her face! Sneasel lets out a yelp as she's sent flying down the dock! 

"**Perfect!** Gus, time for the finisher!"

"Got it! Wait, wha-" I quickly fly behind Gus and grab his back, and use all of my strength to lift him into the air! "W-Wait, what are you doing!?"

I ignore his whining as I focus on flying the both of us over towards Sneasel, who is only now getting back on her feet. Flying above her while carrying Gus, I do a spin in mid-air and send Gus hurtling toward Sneasel! Seconds before impact, Sneasel sees the living projectile flying towards her and jumps backwards, making Gus miss her and smash right through the wooden planks of the dock and splash into the water below!

*(Oops. I uh, probably should've explained what I was doing first, guess muscle memory from doing combo moves with Dewott took over. I hope he's okay.)* As I fly down to the hole in the dock, Sneasel shoots some ice shards at me, and I yell in pain as one connects with my right wing! The freezing cold sends shivers throughout my body as I start plummeting back down to earth! I slam into the pier, and hear the wooden planks creek under me as a wave of pain passes through my entire body due to the impact. Dazed, I pull myself up only to see another ice shard speeding towards my face. I don't even have time to let out a gasp before I feel the freezing shard hit my face. The feeling of burning cold envelops my body for a second before everything goes black.

I'm awoken by a rush of energy flowing through my body, as well as hearing the crunch of something being chewed in my mouth. Swallowing, I open my eyes and realize Gus just fed me a reviver seed. I sit up and rub my eyes, and see Sneasel sitting nearby, staring at me with her arms crossed.

"You okay?" Gus says as he hands me an oran berry. "Sneasel hit you pretty hard."

I munch on it and feel another wave of energy course through my body, erasing some of my pain. "Y-yeah... I-I s-should b-b-be t-the o-one asking y-you if you're o-okay... S-Sorry a-about t-the throw..."

"It's fine, I didn't get hurt. That throw actually let me jump up through the hole in the dock and sneak up behind Sneasel to knock her ou-"

"HEY! You said you weren't going to mention that!" Sneasel snaps.

"Right, sorry." Gus says as he scratches the back of his head sheepishly. "Well, good thing we're all okay."

"Y-Yeah..." I finish eating the oran berry and stand up. "U-Um, S-Sneasel?"

"... What?" Sneasel doesn't look at me as she responds.

"I-I'm s-sorry... A-About e-everything I s-said b-before..."

Sneasel sighs. "... It's alright. You weren't entirely wrong, I am pretty dumb. But you're completely wrong about Booker being useless. He might not be strong, but he's saved me from my own stupidity countless times."

I nodded. "I a-also g-got myself k-knocked out b-by y-you... D-Despite s-saying t-to n-not make s-stupid m-mistakes l-like I j-just d-did..."

"It was a mistake you could afford to make since Gus could still fight. You were right in saying me making a fatal mistake like that would put Booker in a lot of danger as well. And..." Sneasel sighs again. "... You fought pretty well."

"I-It was m-mostly all G-Gus..."

Gus smiles. "Thanks, but really all I did is just wave my scallop around. In a fair fight, Sneasel would've had me beat."

"Of course." Sneasel said with a satisfied smirk. "But your guy's teamwork was amazing. It made me understand what you think strength is, Togetic. It's teamwork, isn't it?"

I nodded again. "Y-Yes. B-But more t-than that, s-strength is k-knowing you c-can t-trust your team-m-mate to c-cover your w-weaknesses with t-their own s-strengths."

"Ha, don't need to do that if I just get strong enough to have no weaknesses!" Sneasel puts her arms behind her head and lays back on the pier, staring at the stars. "... Teamwork is a powerful thing though. You and that Dewott must've been a true force to be reckoned with."

I just stare at the ocean silently. *(We were, though Dewott did most of the heavy lifting. I was pretty much useless until I evolved, and even then I can still barely fight on my own. Here I am getting my ass handed to me in a 2v1 while Dewott's probably doing just fine on his own.)*

Sneasel lifts up her head to face me. "... Don't want to talk about him? Fair enough, it was rude of me to bring up your past anyway."

"... You r-remind me of h-him, a b-bit." I mutter under my breath. "I-I guess t-that's why I g-got so m-mad... I s-saw m-myself and D-Dewott in y-you a-and B-Booker."

Sneasel put her claw to her chin with a grim expression her face. "So... Then, did he make a mistake and...?"

"O-Oh, h-he didn't die." Sneasel let out a sigh of relief as I said that. "W-We just h-had s-some close c-calls... O-One of them d-did lead t-to me e-evolving t-t-though..." I let out a sigh of my own. "We w-were both h-humans, a-and he w-wanted to g-go back to the h-human w-world while I-I d-didn't, s-so we a-abandoned e-eachother." I struggle to stop my voice from wavering.

Gus sat down next to me and put his arm on my back. "I want to go back too, but I wouldn't ruin a friendship over it. I know I'd have to leave some friends behind here, but I'd want to leave on good terms with all of them." 

Sneasel looked off towards the sea, and her face made her look like she was deep in thought. *(I wonder... Is she thinking about if Booker would want to go back to the human world? I wonder how many of the humans here would want to go back. It's going to be a sad day when a way back to the human world is finally found.)*

We all continue to look out to the starry sea, enjoying how beautiful the moon and the stars in the night sky made it look. The only thing we could hear is the wind rustling through some of the nearby trees and the waves crashing against the supports of the pier. 

However, our peaceful moment was soon interrupted. 

"**ZZZZZT, WERE YOU THREE THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE COMPLAINTS?**"

Startled, we all jump to see a Magnezone behind us. "**AND NOW I CAN SEE THAT THE PIER IS DAMAGED, ZZZZZZZZZT**"

"Uh... It was like that when we got here!" Sneasel quickly responds nervously. "Actually, we came here cuz of the noises we heard! Right guys?" Sneasel waits for a response from one of us to back her up, but there's only silence. "... Guys?" 

Sneasel turns around to see that both me and Gus have disappeared. I've already flown back over the town while Gus silently dived into the water, out of sight. 

I'm unable to hold back a smirk when I hear Sneasel yell "COWARDS!" in the distance while I glide my way over to the guild. 

*(Now she's for sure going to shank me later.)*

## Wooper gets Smashed

"Ugh... Huff!" 

I adjust the crate I'm holding in my arms as I struggle to carry it through the halls of the guild. It's the middle of the night, and the guild's hallways are illuminated by oil lamps. Not wanting the crate to obscure my view, I walk at an awkward sideways angle which slows me down. The sound of jingling bottles within the crate continually makes me nervous, as at any moment I'm afraid I could hear one of them shatter. 

*(Damn, why didn't they include some packaging to act as a buffer so the bottles aren't all bouncing against each other!? And Beast is going to think I'm the one that broke them if any of them do happen to crack.)*

I walk through the dim and empty dining hall and notice that the door to the kitchen is ajar. *(Thank god, don't have to risk putting down the crate to open the door.)* I hit the door with my shoulder to open it, and inside I see...

"C'MON WOOPER, CHUG CHUG CHUG!"

Wooper is laying on the floor as Chespin pours a wine from a wine bottle directly into his mouth. Wooper's eyes are half-closed and dazed, while his large smile looks even larger as he's opening wide to make sure none of the wine spills out of it. Chespin can barely hold the bottle straight as his body sways from side to side. Chespin finally notices me and looks over, and his eyes look just as dazed as Wooper's. 

"Oh... *hic*, hey Toge!" Chespin slurs as he accidentally spills some of the wine onto Wooper's chest, which just seems to absorb it. 

"U-Uh... H-Hey..." *(Well, at least I happened to restocking the wine tonight. That'll save them getting skinned and fileted alive by Beast.)*

Chespin's bottle lets out its final drip of wine, and it lands directly on Wooper's face, once again getting absorbed into his body. Wooper is unresponsive, but has a look of pure bliss on his face. Chespin lets out a loud hiccup and falls on his behind, giggling. 

*(... I'm not sure how I feel about seeing my two saviors getting completely shitfaced. I should probably cover for them considering how much I owe them for saving me that one time.)*

I walk over to one of the kitchen counters and carefully place down the crate of wine, and then turn to face my two inebriated guildmates. "H-How m-many b-b-bottles d-did you d-drink?" 

Chespin groggily looks up at me with a smile. "I hadsh... *hic*... One bottle, and we wanted tch see howsh many... *hiccup*... Wooper could takesh... I thinks he had... *hic*.... Two..." Chespin then flopped down onto his back, staring at the kitchen ceiling.

Sighing, I open the crate and start taking out and organizing some of the wine into the kitchen cabinets. *(Cabernet Carnivine... Mareep Merlot... Persim Noir... Chesto Chardonnay... Chateau Cherrim... Ah.)* While organizing them, I notice that the cabinet that usually held Chateau Cherrim was empty. *(Well, guess that's their favorite. I'll have to remember that for their birthdays or Christmas.)* Just as I'm about to get back to organizing the bottles, I hear footsteps and a voice from the dining hall.

"**WHO'S IN MY KITCHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!? I SWEAR IF YOU'RE MESSING WITH THE MAYO AGAIN CYNDAQUIL I'M GOING TO TURN YOU INTO BREAD!**"

*(Oh, fuck! Gotta hide the drunkards!)* 

I quickly open up a large cabinet close to the floor that is full of pans and various cooking utensils, but is thankfully large enough to be able to hold Wooper and Chespin if they were squeezed in there. *(It'll be a tight fit, but they'll thank me later.)* I fly over to Wooper, pick him up, and then shove his squishy body into the cabinet, making the pans clang against each other. Chespin is alerted by the loud noise and sits up. 

"*hic* Whatsh... What are you doing to Woopy?!" Before Chespin can get angry at me, I grab him and throw him into the cabinet! "OOFSH! HEY, *hic*, WHAT ARE-"

I whisper closely to Chespin "*s-stay quiet or y-you're going to g-get s-slow boiled-d.*" Before slamming the cabinet door on him and Wooper. I hear them fidget inside against some of the pots and pans for a few seconds, but eventually the noise stops. I breathe a sigh of relief, and Beast finally makes his way into the room.

"**YOU BETTER NOT BE MESSING WITH MY NEWLY BOUGHT PANS-** Oh, it's just you, Togetic." Beast leans against the doorway as he catches his breath. "Heard some clattering down here and assumed it was one of the usual troublemakers."

"H-Hello S-Sir Winchester..."

"You don't have to call me "Sir", everyone here just calls me Beast anyway." However, his slight smirk betrays the fact that he actually enjoys my choice of honorific. Beast seemed to like me more than most other guild members. Initially, he disliked how I would sneak into the kitchen to organize things for him without him knowing, but over time he came to accept it, and he started sending me on errands for him to restock the cooking supplies he needed. He also appreciated how I could understand his rants about food, but sometimes this led to ranting of my own about food in the human world that he couldn't keep up with. "Restocking the wine?"

I nod. "Y-Yes... F-From the s-special order you p-put in w-with the K-Kecleons back i-in t-t-town. T-They a-assured me i-it was only the f-finest of e-each batch..."

Beast scoffed. "It better be, it took a lot of convincing to get the Guildmaster to let me use the guild's funds to pay for it." Beast walked over to the open crate and started examining some of the bottles I had yet to put away. "Looks like they haven't been tampered with, at least. But we won't know if they've been watered-down until they're open."

"N-Not like t-the *plebian* palettes of the pokemon here would be able to tell the differences between a watered-down wine and one of the *highest*, most *refined* quality! N-None of them probably even know how something as **simple** as the shape of the wine glass itself c-can influence how the wine can taste due to how the wine's aroma reaches one's nose!" 

A large grin formed on Beast's face. "Perfectly right. Everyone here just gulps down everything alcoholic without actually trying to enjoy the flavor profile of the drink. Well, not that we really have the fancy glasses to do something like high-quality wine tasting here anyway." Beast put his hand to his chin and thought for a moment. "Hey... Why don't we do a little taste test right now? You're the one that carried it all over here, you deserve the chance to enjoy some of it before the rest of the guild goes through all of it."

*(A-Actually drink it!? Sure I know a lot about alcohol, but I've never drank any, even as a human! Ugh, why am I thinking about that, I have to get Team Cozy out of here before they make any noise and blow their cover!)*

Nervously shaking my head, I say, "U-Uhm... I-I m-must d-decline... I-I wouldn't w-want to w-waste any of the w-wine..."

"Nonsense! Come on, let's get some glasses!" Beast starts walking towards me, but then nearly slips on a puddle of wine! Regaining his balance, he notices the large amount of Chateau Cherrim spilled all over his kitchen floor. "Who... Who made this mess!?"

*(Oh fuck. Well, I'm still indebted to Team Cozy, so here goes.)* I let out a sigh. "... M-Me.... I'm s-s-sorry... I-I d-d-dropped a... Erm... B-Bottle by ac-c-ccident... I-I w-was c-cleaning it u-up b-b-before you c-came in... I-I-I'm really s-sorry, S-Sir W-Winchester..." 

Beast's expression turned soft. "O-Oh... It's alright. Even a great chef like me makes a mess of the kitchen sometimes. Here, I'll help you clean up-"

"N-No! A-A h-head chef l-like you s-shouldn't have to c-clean up the m-mess of an a-assistant l-like me..."

"Oh, come on. I'm down here, I might as well hel-" His voice is interrupted by some clattering within the cabinet behind me, and I see the cabinet door move slightly out of the corner of my eye. Acting quickly, I bash myself against the cabinet to force it closed, while clutching my chest and wincing to pretend that I'm in pain.

"O-Oof.. O-Ow..."

Beast rushes over to me. "Togetic! Are you alright? I can get some oran berries from the pantry."

"I-I'm fine... J-Just a-a little s-sore f-from... U-Uh... T-Training w-with... S-Sneasel!" *(God my excuses are getting worse by the second.)*

"You don't look fine, are you sure you don't need any help?"

"Y-Yeah.. J-Just a l-little s-sore... And t-tired..." I let out a large yawn, right into Beast's face. "A-ah... S-Sorry... I-I should g-go get s-some rest..."

Beast lets out a smaller yawn of his own. "Yeah... I'm feeling a bit tired too all of a sudden, I should get back to sleep." After letting out another yawn, Beast lethargically walks to the kitchen's exit, only slightly attempting to avoid stepping in the puddles of wine. Once he disappears through the doorway I let out a large sigh of relief. 

*(Haaah... I can't believe Yawn worked. I should use it more often, I just hope he doesn't fall asleep while climbing the stairs.)* 

Turning my attention back to Team Cozy, I get up, and the moment I stop holding back the cabinet door Chespin and Wooper come rolling right out. "Ouch! Couldn't you have put us in a larger cabinet? It wasn't comfy being in there! *hic*" Chespin pouts as he stands up and dusts himself off, he's still somewhat unsteady on his feet but he appears slightly more sober. "... Thanks for *hic* covering for us, though."

Wooper attempts and fails a few times to stand upright, and Chespin has to help him stay steady. "Yeah... *hic*, thanksh! Your natural awkward shtuttering made it imposshible for Beasht to tell you were... *hic*... lying!" Wooper says gleefully when Chespin finally gets him back onto his feet.

"T-Thanks... I-I think." Despite being somewhat annoyed at them, I can never stop myself from smiling when I see Wooper's joyful face. "W-Why were you t-two getting d-drunk d-down here a-anyway? Y-You know h-how mad B-Beast gets." 

Chespin put his hands behind his head. "Heheh... Well, *hic* Wooper was asking me about how *hic* humans drink alcohol, so..."

*(Guess someone was a party animal in a past life. Or at least wanted to be one.)* "W-What kind of h-human chugs w-wine, t-though?"

"We *hic* couldn't find... any beersh!" Wooper nearly falls over again but Chespin puts his arm on his head to balance him.

"And Wooper just *hic* really likes this wine, Beast has caught him sneaking in to *hic* drink it before!"

*(Extra noted. Now I just need to find out their birthdays)* "A-Are both of you s-sober enough to w-walk?"

Chespin nods, and Wooper tries to nod, but instead he just faceplants into the ground. After helping his friend up yet again, Chespin takes out his vines and wraps them around Wooper's body, and then lifts him over his head shakily. "I can *hic* carry Wooper back to our room like this."

"A-Alright. You two g-go on ahead s-so I can catch you i-if you stumble." After taking a moment to clean up the cabinet I shoved them into, I follow them out of the kitchen and through the dining hall. As Chespin stumbles up the stairs holding Wooper above him with his vines, I carefully keep an eye on both of them, arms ready to catch either if they fall. Thankfully, neither of them falls over, and we make it to the floor that Chespin and Wooper's room is on. After a short walk we make it to the door of their room, and Chespin places Wooper on the ground as I open the door to their room for them.

"Y-You two feeling a-alright? I can get you some w-water if you two need to s-sober up more." 

Chespin and Wooper shake their heads. "I'm feeling mostly *hic* sober now. You okay Wooper?" Wooper looks at Chespin and begins to nod, but lets out a loud yawn instead. "Alright then, let's get you into bed." Wooper nods again, and walks into the room. Chespin and I follow behind him, and I'm momentarily shocked by the massive blanket that takes up the room. Chespin seems to notice my awe. "Impressive *hic*, right?"

"Y-Yeah, your t-team name is n-no joke." *(... How the hell are they going to wash that thing when it eventually gets dirty though?)* My gaze eventually turns to Wooper, who flops down on the middle of the blanket and falls asleep near instantly. *(Feels weird to see Wooper actually tired out for once, guess he's hungover. Chespin and Wooper are such great friends, if only I could have a friendship like that.)*

Chespin notices my forlorn expression. "... Something wrong?"

"... I-I'm just jealous of y-your friendship. Y-You two are p-practically inseparable. I d-don't think anyone else in the guild has a r-relationship as deep and as i-inspirational as you two."

Chespin blushes. "W-Well, that might be exaggerating it a bit, but thanks. Just know we both consider you a great friend as well. If you're ever feeling uncomfortable, Team Cozy will always be here to make you feel cozy!... *hic*" 

I giggle as Chespin isn't able to hold back a hiccup. "I j-just... Wish I could c-connect with s-someone on the same l-level you and W-Wooper can..." I let out a sigh. "F-Feels like I c-can n-neve-BAWH!?"

Out of nowhere, Chespin suddenly gives me a big hug, and holds me tightly. "I told you! *hic* We'll always be here if you need to feel more comfy, got it?" Chespin's embrace fills me with warmth, and I hug him back. 

"... T-Thanks..." All of my worries wash away as I just let myself enjoy the feeling of being hugged and embraced by someone. Chespin's body occasionally vibrates violently when he hiccups, but it's not enough for me to mind. After hugging for about a full minute Chespin lets go of me. 

"Uh... Sorry if that seemed kinda...*hic* y'know. I don't know what came over me, must be the wine." Chespin says while looking away from me awkwardly.

*(Guess the booze makes him more touchy-feely.)* "I-It's fine. I-I kinda needed t-that, anyway." I take another look at Wooper, who's still out completely cold on the giant blanket. "Well, I should p-probably let you s-sleep off your drunkenness. T-Thanks for all of the s-support."

"Heh, *hic* you're the one that saved us from getting chewed out by Beast, we should be thanking you." Chespin stretches out his arms while letting out a yawn. "Well, goodnight!" 

"G-Goodnight." I walk out of the room and Chespin closes the door behind me. *(Well, that sure was... Something. I should get back to the kitchen and clean up the rest of the mess down there before turning in for the night myself.)*

***

While cleaning up the mess of spilled wine in the kitchen, I notice something glint on the floor from the light of the oil lamps. Moving closer, I can see it's a Clover Guild badge. 

*(Huh. I guess this must be one of Team Cozy's, probably fell off after they tumbled out of the cabinet. I'll go sneak it into their room while they're sleeping)* 

***

Making my way back up to their room, I slowly and carefully open up the door, not wanting to disturb either of Team Cozy's coziness. Once it's open enough, I peek my head in, and see a sight that shocks me to my very core. An image that will forever be burned into my retinas for the rest of my life. Chespin and Wooper are under the covers of the giant blanket, and cuddling each other, with Chespin having his arm over Wooper's body.

*(This... This... Is...)*

*(This is the absolute cutest thing I have EVER seen in my life. Nothing else in this world or the human world could possibly compare to the level of cuteness and beauty at this moment, right here. This simple moment of innocent cuddling between two best friends is the PEAK of adorableness within all universes. There could be a million universes where this exact scene happens, yet this one will always be the cutest and most powerful of all of them. Breaking down how this scene and all of the factors that create it as the perfect image of kawaiiness would do a disservice to the scene, as all of those factors working together in unison, much like how Chespin and Wooper always work in unison, is what makes the scene whole, and what makes the scene the pure unfiltered essence of cuteness and beauty. However, despite how I know how folly it is it try and analyze this scene, I cannot stop myself from wanting to indulge in describing what makes it perfect, as doing so would allow me more time to view the scene critically, and perhaps even embolden my philosophical appreciation for this pinnacle of kawaii. Chespin and Wooper's friendship, and their undying devotion to each other, is perhaps the most important aspect of this scene. Perchance. Their relationship is one that would be the envy of anyone in the world, a friendship between two friends who understand each other near-perfectly, and who both have their minds completely set on the same, noble but in-of-itself adorable goal of making the world a comfier place. This sets the backdrop for the rest of the scene, while Chespin and Wooper's embrace shows how masterful their relationship is, there's more going into it than that. As a pokemon, Wooper does not have any reason to believe why cuddling with someone for warmth would be awkward or even something to get flustered about. However, as a human, and due to how awkward Chespin got after he hugged me, it is obvious Chespin, like a lot of human males in the world, find the idea of any physical contact with another male, for a lack of a better term, "extremely gay", and thus are afraid to manifest their platonic affection towards another male friend in any physical ways. Now this has never stopped Europeans, but due to the fact that Chespin hasn't attempted to kiss anyone on the lips as a greeting and hasn't asked for a license for his vines and other possible weaponry, it can be assumed he's American. These pure homo-social bonds between Chespin and Wooper are also why a male like me is the only one who could **EVER** truly appreciate this scene. Women would **NEVER** understand this scene, they would mistake the pure, loving embrace between friends as homosexual and assume that they are lovers instead of being the world's best companions. Homosexual men and of course, **DYKES** would never be able to understand the rich nuances of this scene either, this is a scene with straight men that only other, just as straight men could fully appreciate. Disgusting **FUJOSHITS** would bastardize this scene and use it as an excuse to write **DISGUSTING** smut instead of PROPER fanfiction that would show the true colors of Team Cozy's relationship. Lesser men, not as confident in their own sexuality, would laugh at this scene, calling it gay, unable to accept their own insecurities and would be unable see to that their **"""criticism"""** of the scene is really just a projection of their own inner turmoil of being **faggots**. Truly, only **I**, standing here right at this moment, this scene forever ingrained into my mind, could ever hope to-)*

"Watching the two lovebirds cuddle each other?" Elm whispers as he floats next to me to get a better look into the room. "More like Team Homozy, am I rig-"

With all of the force in my body, I perform a devastating uppercut, powered by the power of the cuteness of Team Cozy that flows within me. Elm's body is instantly shot upwards and hits the ceiling... Or it would've, if he wasn't a ghost type. Instead he went flying right through, and with how much force I put into that uppercut I can only assume that he must be somewhere within lower orbit by now. 

*(Team Cozy and their relationship are truly the peak and pinnacle of all relationships within the guild, no, within the entire world, and it must be protected **AT ALL COSTS.** That **DUMBSKULL**, that motherfucking baka, that sick motherfucking **BAKA** will NOT ruin this perfect moment, nor will ANYONE else. I must make sure this moment, and all future moments like it, are safe and protected. I must secure a future for Team Cozy and Team Cozy appreciators (Me). I will make sure no one and nothing stands in the way of Team Cozy's bonds of friendship. I cannot allow a world to exist where Chespin and Wooper stop being friends. Their friendship will be protected. If anything were to happen to Chespin or Wooper, I would kill everyone in this guild and then myself.)* Remembering what I initially came here for, I quietly float into the room, and place the lost badge on the small table on the side of the room, and quietly float out, sneaking one last glance at Chespin and Wooper before I carefully shut the door to their room.

As I turn away from the door, I see a familiar shadow floating down from the ceiling. He rubs the lower half of his body, wincing in pain. "What was THAT for?"

"U-Uh, sorry. Y-You just s-spooked me."

"Remind me to not be a ghost next time. What were you doing staring at those two, anyway?"

"S-Something you'll n-never understand, d-don't worry about it."

Elm gives me a weird look, then shrugs. "Well, see you around." Elm gives me a wave and then goes back on his way. I start making my way back to my own room.

*(I will create a world where the coziness that we know today lasts forever.)*
