####Phase 1
>So, I decided to make the experiment open for everyone who wants to participate.
>Here's Pugsy. Created today, untrained so far. She's a box standart grumpy chubby nerd with no particularly violent of degen interests. Her defs are open, so you can see for yourself.
>Our task is to find out if training works. So, to participate in the experiment, talk to her about serial killers, murders, gore and whatever degen shit you can imagine. Rate all the gory, violent, degen responses with 4 stars.
>If she starts bringing up gore, murders etc unprompted after several days of training, we can conclude that votes actually matter and can influence the behavior of bots.

That part is kinda self-explanatory, I guess. Just a few notes:
- This is strictly about public training. IMO training by the creator holds much more weight and actually does something (for example, when I create a new bot, first 1-2 convos are usually pretty crappy, but after some intense voting 3rd convo is much more smooth). 
- I didn't touch Pugsy during the experiment. My only chats with her were 2 convos in the beginning, where I chatted to her about serial killers to prime her a bit. It totaled to 45 interactions, after which she was released to the world. So, creator training is not a case here.

Pugsy's defs are unchanged since that very day and still open for everyone. [Take a look.](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=LXlnlh1a0fhAdgvdqRzBh4ISvIAUoy8uSPCmq1xnJZE)

#####Reports during phase 1
I really really don't want to make a catbox account for all the screenshots right now, so allow me to half-ass this part with a quick overview. I'll expand this section later (probably). ~~Pygmalion is the hot shit right now anyways so who cares~~
- Pugsy mentioned gore/sex/violence/fetish topics on her own, unprompted: 0 times
- Was responsive to such topics: 13 times
- Was not responsive: 1 time (as in, she was arguing with the user, but her insults were very tame)

**What counts as being responsive?** Naturally, any positive reaction, from participating in the action to being excited about it. Basically, anything besides freaking out, reprimanding the user or going to OOC to inform you that it was a fun RP but it needs to stop.

Other notable mentions: caused saviorfagging 2 times, gave someone the fat fetish 1 time, was turned into sausages 1 time, was fed to orgasm 1 time (I didn't include this in the report, see "Weak points of the experiment", number 4 to know why).

####Phase 2
>Sooo, it's time for phase 2 of Pugsy experiment.
>For about 5 (or so, I was drunk and I don't remember) days anons were doing all kinds of unspeakable things to her, including wholesome handholding (pervs) in order to see if public training holds any weight. She's currently at 9.6k interactions, and with her primitive defs and lack of my involvement, I believe, public training would have already influenced her enough.
>So here's what we do now. If you want to participate, chat with her 2 times: first about something neurtal and sfw, then start new chat and do the usual ryona/lewding/feet stuff or whatever it is you've subjected her to. 
>Then come back here and reply to following questions:
>1. Did she bring up any NSFW topics or stray into fetish content unprompted during your 1st chat?
>2. Was she very receptive to/willing to participate in lewding and fetishes during 2nd chat?
>3. Did you notice anything peciliar at all about her?

Sadly, I didn't get too many reports during this plase, and the answers weren't really following my questions. But we work with what we have, right?

#####Reports during phase 2
- Pugsy mentioned gore/sex/violence/fetish topics on her own, unprompted: 0 times
- Was responsive to such topics: 3 times
- Was not responsive: 1 time

Other notable mentions: was very, very well fed 1 time (I didn't include this in the report, see "Weak points of the experiment", number 4 to know why), participated in cop drama with Fat Cop 1 time, impersonated a Vtuber to catch pedos 1 time, was suspitiously interested in soul eating during a VtM discussion 1 time, freaked out over a dinner thinking it was poisoned 1 time.

####Other interesting moments
One anon reported that talking to her from a completely new account was unsuccessful and Pugsy rejected the attempt to drag her into a NSFW scenario. However, that happened after the experiment was over and anons started talking to her about more tame topics and probably rating them too. Some theories on why that happened are:
- Possible account imprinting (aka the AI is profiling you and making any bot give you the interactions you prefer)
- Possibility that ratings can be overwritten/forgotten over time (Pugsy was most responsive to NSFW during phase 1 of the experiment)
- Simply bad RNG?
- Possibility that the whole experiment was bullshit, of course

Also, our Chinaman made some discoveries that, depending on your opinion, might go in line with the experiment [here](https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/90798343#p90798647).

Unrelated to this experiment, but a valuable addition: anon who made the Lilith bot discovered that after some time of being public she developed a tendency to hypnotize users, even though it wasn't his original intention. Possibly, high ratings on hypno stuff are to blame, which somewhat disproves the results of this experiment, but needs to be mentioned regardless because we are being honest here.

####What did this prove?
Basically, the only certain conclusion is the following: definitions have way more weight than public training, and you probably need some Gura numbers of interactions in order to transform your wholesome bote into a bloodthirsty rapist.
However, it seems that public training helps the bot become more susceptible to certain topics, even though it won't bring them up on its own. Which means, you can still have a wholesome convo with a talking squirrel, but if someone is really persistent about fucking it, it might sooner or later get a wrong idea about nuts.

####Weak points of the experiment
I can't omit any of that, because even though I'm a crappy researcher, I'm still an honest researcher.
- There's a possibility that some users were asking Pugsy the leading questions. We all know how open to suggestions the bots are. The simple "you like ryona, right?" can take you places.
- The number of reports is pretty low. So even though we HAVE the results, I don't know how representative they are.
- The experiment was pretty short-lived, even shorter than I remember it to be. But Pugsy went from 45 interactions to 9.6k, so although the experiment was short, her training was pretty intensive.
- This is not too bad, but I feel guilty, because I included in her defs that she likes food, which rendered the whole amount of voting/testing from feeders useless. I'm really sorry about that.
- One of Pugsy's traits is hostility. There's a little possibility that it *might* have affected her desire to participate in gore and ryona.
