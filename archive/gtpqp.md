Sunny, i need your opinion..." the voice cracked a little

The quiet boy separated his gaze from his book just to meet a blushing Basil, sheepishly playing with his own hands. Both of them were reading in the floor of Basil's room while enjoying the peace and quiet

"...But you can't tell this to anyone, okay?" as doubtful as ever Basil needed some convincing to let go of his secret
"don't even Mari?"
"E-ESPECIALLY MARI!!" Basil's face now painted with a crimson glow confused Sunny to an even greater degree.
With a quick shrug, he focuses again on his book "alright... go on"
"i.... want to date your sister" Basil's voice didn't falter this time, a solemn wish guided by innocent love made the words come out crystal clear.
He was still red but his determination was palpable to even Sunny who was looking at the flower boy ones again

Always the stoic, Sunny looked at him for a solid half a minute, taking in all that was said and Basil's new demeanor

His mind raced to control his body but to no avail

With his cheeks full of air, Sunny's half contain giggles exploded into full-blown laughter at Basil expense, much to the dismay of the latter

"Sunny?!? stop that! I am being serious here!" Basil glanced to the side with a mixed feeling of betrayal and shame, the honest heart to heart partially ruined

With his eyes back at him, Sunny looked at him for 5 seconds this time

Indeed, he was being serious


Returning to what he was doing Sunny just dropped back first into the floor, his laughter even louder this time while grabbing his tummy to mitigate a little the growing pain he was feeling

"Don't be mean! geez..." clenched fist and disapproving tone did little to stop Sunny laugh, but Basil's eyes becoming a little watery sure did for even him knew when to stop

"Ah...hehe..ah...okay I am in"
"What?"
"We are getting you a date, but we have to come up with a plan since she can be difficult to convince"
"I can't just ask her out, are you insane?"
"I know, that's what the plan is for, you didn't hear me or something?"
With a groan, Basil drags his hands over his face "Okay but answer my something, no laughter, no funny business, no nothing"
"...."
"I am her type?"
"Probably... worst case scenario she just likes to hang around you, so I think you are in the green"
"That... not half-bad actually"
"Right, now listen up, your best bet is valentines day..."

Right there and then, the boys took the rest of the afternoon hatching their master plan...

"...a then we used the chloroform"
"We are not using chloroform Sunny, cut it out"

...hatching a plan

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The day has finally come

With a bouquet of roses on hand and an anxious smile, Basil hypes himself up in front of the Suzuki's household main door

*This is it, is not as scary as it seems* a quick smirk in his face denotes that the irony is not lost on him

*Three, two, one* he knocks on the door

Heartbeat rising, shaky hands, blurred vision

Disaster about to strike

Breathe in, breathe out

Perseverance and hope make an act of presence, he knocks a little harder

"Coming"

He clears his throat, the first part is quite simple, just give her the chocolate and the flowers, in that order

The door begins to open

"Hey Bas! Sunny isn't here right now, he is in the park"
"Actually, I am here for you today"
"Uh?" finally looking at the bouquet and the heart shape gift Mari got the memo "oh!.... oh~"

Basil knew that if she begins to tease him this whole thing will blow up, so quick in the draw he gave her the flowers first and then chocolate...

*Dammit*

"Basil, you shouldn't have, i love these roses"

*Roll with it*

"Yeah, you love the color violet so I got a bunch of them for you! no so sure about the chocolate"

"don't worry, come in!"

Confidence blooms in Basil, she didn't reject him! oh joy, may all the world know that today Basil has... why are there three chocolate boxes in the table and... three bouquets!?!

Looking at Basil shocked expression Mari knew he had some explaining to do

"Hehe, sorry I normally turn them down in the door but I kinda want to talk to you about... well you know" she scratched the back of her head

Valentine day was always a shooting gallery of suitors bombarding her house, of course, one of them being a close friend was a first for her so extra tact was needed

Basil wasn't doing too good, he looked how she leaves his gift with the rest and makes her way to the couch

Hopeless, he just follows her, sitting by her side

*Wait, wait... this means nothing I may turn this around yet*

"Look Basil, I am flatter, I am really am but I am a little too old for you an--"
"But that the best part"

Silence set in

*Did I think that or did I say it?*

A cute giggle escaped Mari "i appreciated the honestly I suppose~" she rested a hand in her face in amusement "but is still a no from me"
"I... okay" Basil rested his head on the sofa, looking at the ceiling, he continued "so who is it?"
"Who?" she tilted her head in confusion
"You know... the lucky guy?... or you just turn down half of faraway just because?"
"Nobody"

Basil straightened himself, he has to listen to this

"I can't just date a completed stranger just because he buys me some gift"

Basil just looks at her like saying IAM RIGHT HERE, while resting his head in his hand

"I don't know! I don't feel ready..."
"But you have a lot of experience dealing with guys, right?"
"Yeah but no dating then besides everyone just listens to me but they do not hear me, know what I mean?
"Yeah... that happens all the time in my house...." at that moment Basil had an epiphany "wait! i got it"
"What?"
"What if... we date as practice, it wouldn't be dating dating but any experience is good right?

Mari did a mocking clap "you really thought that one didn't you?" with the usual smug look she had a little mercy for the gardener "i am gonna think it over, just for you" her mocking tone

*Worth the shot...*

"I gonna go" Basil just got up, disappointment still lingering in his heart
"You sure?"
"Yeah..."

At the door, Mari try to help his heavy heart one last time

"Cmon Bas, I am sure you find someone out there...."
"Mari... is okay just... make sure to choose someone that makes you happy, because I have no doubts that you will make someone very happy in the future" Basil was being honest even if his smile was tainted by pain
Mari could just smile as she opened the door

She makes up her mind at that moment

Taking the first steps out of the house Basil felt something in his cheek.... a kiss?

"Stop playing it cool~"
"W-What?"
"That better! see you tomorrow at the park?"
"yesofcourseyoubetanydayanytime"
"I take that as a yes then, hehe~" she turned her back, but before closing the door she added "remember is just practice so don't get any funny ideas"

The door closing leaves him in the silence of winter, his face crimson as was humanly possible, he was trying to process what just happened

The realization hit him like a truck, he actually got the date!

*Oh fuck yeah!* he jumped fist in the air in celebration

Unfortunately, he didn't quite stick the landing

"Damn snow..."
