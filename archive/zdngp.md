Another day, another dollar

Such a dumb phrase never did much for her, if anything, it made clear that work was just money for her real passions in life like the piano, learning and her family.

Oh! how grateful she was for the family that she formed here in the suburbs, being a runaway and then living in a cheap department in the city for such a long time really make this place feel like a tropical island away from the problems of the past

From the hardships of rising up from the fall...

Friday burnout was trying to bring her down but Sunny's cooking

Mari parked her car, taking but a moment to meet her ridiculous standards of how centered the car must be, along with a laundry list of other factors. That was the easy part, the hard part will be those 27 steps between her and the comfy couch, a promise of weekend relaxation being negated by such a short, but vast distance

A couch too far if you will

She reclined in the driver's seat, 5 minutes of peace and quiet sounded quite nice before checking on Dawn but something caught her eye. the light of the garage made her wedding ring reflect some of the light to her face

A small giggle escapes her, overwhelmed with nostalgic memories of that day, she played with the jewelry by making it rotate a little with her other hand

While the golden ring in her hand means a lot to her it was second to the meaning of the silver ring in a chain around her neck, another memory from another time

But enough remembrance, she has to tend to her here and now. With cherished memories close to her heart she exited the car with renewed vigor if still a little exhausted by work

However, as soon as she entered the living room a most unexpected scene hit the core of her soul, a big smile made its way to her face while she leans against the wall and crosses her arms

On the couch Sunny was talking to little Dawn that was in his lap
"Su-nny can you say Su-nny?"
"cubby bluby" Dawn babbling, while cute, wasn't quite there in the realm of the spoken language yet
" Almost there Princess Su-nny"

Mari made her way to the couch, hugging her husband from behind she said " Ma-ri, can you say Ma-ri"
"bary bluari"
Sunny chuckles at Dawn's attempt before he kisses Mari's cheek "how was work bluari?"
"Same old same old cubby" they both laugh softly at their new silly names courtesy of Dawn

"I hope she starts to talk soon, I want to teach her so many words, so many stories..."
"you worry too much" Mari gave him a eskimo kiss before continuing "besides she has to walk before running you know? poor girl hasn't spoken yet and you want to see how good she writes!"
"You may be right.... but I will keep trying!"
"Guess i will be the favorite parent then~"

Sunny initial shock was quickly changed by a neutral expression with lifeless eyes, the light in them missing at the prospect of Dawn hating her dad

"I-it was a joke dear hehe"
"Yeah.... a joke...ha...ha"
"Cuuu....."

Both Mari and Sunny looked at Dawn, it was time?
Sunny was broad back to the land of the living and he could hardly hide his excitement

"Su-nny can you say Su-nny"
Yet it was at that moment that Dawn messing up the first letter of Sunny will change everything

Her first word becoming memorable for all the wrong reasons, Sunny is fully aware of this but can do nothing as his daughter speaks for the very first time












"Bunny"

Sunny didn't want to look at his wife, her smug aura was enough to make him sweat at this point, visions of the next month of teasing, the next year, his next several lives with her all stemming from this very moment

She gets close to his ear, a small mouth of air coming from her nose like a bull about to charge, she doesn't say anything yet instead she enjoys the moment most for the suffering of her husband

Finally, she speaks

"My cute bunny~"

Sunny was sure that somewhere in the house was a monkey's paw and he curses it for this

But he will be lying if he said that he didn't like it
