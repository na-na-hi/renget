Max narrowed her eyes. She'd come to a complete standstill, and her friends were looking askance at her. The five of them were on the verge of clogging up the entire corridor. "You go on first. I've got a call to make."
Faith followed her gaze. "Oh! Is that-"
"Yeah." Max raised her phone to her ear. "Uh, hi? Is this the Kyoto- oh, good. I'd like to report a suspicious character lurking outside Shiketsu High." After making a few clarifying remarks, she locked her phone, satisfied. There was a small but significant buildup of grumbling teenagers behind her, but she ignored them.
"I'm pretty sure that counts as mischief under the penal code," Minnie said. They'd started walking again.
"Whatever."
"You should just talk to him, you know," Faith piped up, falling back into step with Max, who valiantly resisted the urge to sigh and roll her eyes. She'd only gone on *one* (1) date with Cain, and it was like she'd become a whole new person. *She was more bearable when she was moping and lovesick.* "Remember that guy in middle school? He ate, like, a three-day suspension for fighting with you." She lowered her voice, insinuating. "Maybe you should try fighting convenience store guy."
Max twisted her lips, looking pensive. "Maybe I should." She waited for all of three seconds before elbowing Faith. "Nah, not a chance."

The car hit a speed-bump and a girl yelped.
"Officer, he touched me!"
"Did *not*!"
Officer Ikari pinched the bridge of his nose. Beside him, Officer Hamada shook his head and thumbed a button on the dashboard, muting the two teenagers in the backseat. He turned to his colleague pleadingly. "Are we really doing this?"
Officer Ikari nodded. "It's not like we've got anything else on the docket for today," he replied. "And these young people are in love."
"I highly doubt that."
Officer Ikari shot Officer Hamada a look. "You've only been on the force for five months, rookie, so I'll let this slide." He puffed his chest out as the car came to a stop at a traffic light. "In high school, if a girl deliberately antagonizes a boy, it's because she likes him. Otherwise he'd be beneath her notice."
"Did we go to different high schools?"
"Perhaps you've just never been antagonized by a girl before." Officer Ikari sighed longingly. "Ah, to be young and emotionally constipated again."
The scanner beeped. *104 come in, over.*
Officer Hamada raised his voice. *104 here, over. We're headed back to the station. We've got a loiterer and a frivolous reporter. Both high-school age.*
A swirl of static from over the scanner. *Takeshi, this again?*
Officer Ikari harrumphed. *Just you wait. When they're happily married with children in ten years' time, they'll look back on this day and thank me and Hamada for kick-starting their love story.*
The officer on the other end sighed again. *Don't mind him, Hamada. He's read too many visual novels.*

"And how does this look, miss?" the attendant asked.
Max squinted at the offered pair. It was a lot thinner than the earrings that she was used to, but her piercings had come back wrong. And she wasn't going to put herself through that sort of agony again. "It looks okay," she replied, doubtfully, and poked at her tender earlobe. "I guess. Do you have any others?"
She was so absorbed by the options on offer that she barely noticed Edie nudging Hailey behind her. Faith started whispering with Minnie, and it wasn't until she turned around, earrings now safely attached, that she realized that her friends had completely vanished. And that there was someone else standing behind her, browsing the men's section without a care in the world, back turned.
"*You*."
The boy stiffened and turned. For a split second, Max wondered why she'd even opened her mouth, but it was a little too late for that. "You owe me a new uniform, asshole."
"Er, miss-"
Max whirled back around, a pair of bony pincers poking out from the back of her dress. "*What?*"
"Would you like this pair?" The attendant looked nervous. "If not, you'll have to remove it."
Max sneered. "I'll take it." She swiped her card across the payment terminal, yanked her purse away viciously, and stalked after the boy as he tried to beat a hasty retreat. "Asshole! Hey, asshole! I'm talking to you!"
From behind, Minnie, Hailey, Faith and Edie emerged. Edie was cackling as she filmed. Faith was giggling helplessly. Minnie was shaking her head. And Hailey was checking her watch.
"If we want to make it in time for our reservation, she's going to have to wrap this up within the hour," she said. "C'mon. If they actually start fighting, we're going to get banned from here."
