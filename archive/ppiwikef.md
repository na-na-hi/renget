##Characters

###Togetic
->![Art by Growlithe-anon](https://files.catbox.moe/mn98wl.png)<-

Togetic is a former human who woke up in this world alongside Dewott, someone he knew in the human world. The two formed a team, but a disagreement led to the two of them splitting up, and Togetic joined the Clover Guild after being rescued by some of its guildmembers. Togetic is very timid and easily flustered, and usually talks with a stutter. The only time he doesn't is when he gets triggered into ranting about some autistic topic he's interested in. Despite his social incompetence, he's grown to love his place at the guild and he cares deeply about (most) of his fellow guildmates.

###Dewott
->![Art by Growlithe-anon](https://files.catbox.moe/1uvbil.png)<-

Dewott is a former human who woke up alongside Togetic. Unlike Togetic, Dewott is hell-bent on returning to the human world, and he wants Togetic to come back with him. After their argument, Dewott found out that Togetic became a member of the Clover Guild, and has now made it his mission to try and get Togetic back and return to the human world with him.
