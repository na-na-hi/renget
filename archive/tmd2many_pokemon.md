## Rules
!!! warning Below is a list of rules for PC and NPC Pokemon.
	Please read through this carefully and consider it while creating a Player Character or a Non-Player Character. Some of these rules may potentially be flexible based on circumstance, but an exception does not make a rule.

### Disallowed
**Duplicate Rolls:** *Dupe Rolls* are of a species the Player behind them has *played previously.* A Pachirisu Player **cannot** play Pachirisu again if they roll for a different Player Character.
**Cheat Rolls:** *Cheat Rolls* are of a species the Player behind them has *showed interest in playing,* or had *prominent past NPCs of already.* Although coincidences *do* happen, if the Player shows no subtlety and has no defense, they'll have to reroll.

### Questionable
**Clone Rolls:** *Clone Rolls* are of a species multiple Players behind them have *rolled simultaneously.* Despite being a rare occurrence, if this is to cause issues, it must be discussed by the Players in question and a GM.
**Legendary Rolls:** *Legendary/Mythical Rolls* are of a species considered **Legendary** or **Mythical.** While some Legends *are* indeed rollable, rolling for them *outside of concrete, un-cheatable means is grounds for a forced reroll,* and in the odd chance an insurmountable number of Players get them, GM intervention may be needed.

### QoL
**Evolution Clause:** If a Player rolls a Pokémon with *alternate forms or is at a later Evolution Stage,* they may choose to play as a different form or go back down the Evolution Line. This applies to *Regional Variants, Form Changes, and Evolution.*
**Same-Species Clause:** If a Player just so happens to roll *two Pokémon of the same Evolution Line,* they may reroll until they get a different option separate from the first. 
**Grief Clause:** If all options available to a Player would make for an *unenjoyable experience,* they may reroll to get a species with less personal grievances. 
**Mega Clause:** If a Player rolls a *Mega-Evolved or Gigantimax Pokémon* through some means, they may choose to have the Mega or Gigantimax Form as their Character's natural state. This is *purely-cosmetic* and does not have a mechanical impact on the game, nor does it make a Character significantly larger than normal.

!!! warning Arrow Symbols in Species Name
	If you see an ↓ ↑ ↕ in front of a name, that indicates these were originally one entry, but have been split between their regional forms to allow rolling for each one. You can swap between any if you happen to roll them, so long as the arrows are pointing to each entry.
