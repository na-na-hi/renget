# ERP/RP and erotica raw data collection
[TOC2]

## RP/ERP forum scrapes
Listed below are archives containing RP (roleplaying) and ERP (erotic roleplaying) messages scraped from openly accessible forums, in CSV format. For non-story forums, average message length can usually give a good indication of their general quality (i.e. _effort_ put into writing them); on good quality RP forums it is often well over 1 kB/message. Besides miscellaneous information about data quality, the notes provide message count, mean length, standard deviation and message length percentiles.

Keep in mind that most messages in the CSV files are in raw HTML and are **not** ready for use for LLM training or fine-tuning. Further processing will be needed for that.

!!! danger Be careful
	Except for rather basic selection criteria (e.g. forum thread length), messages are completely unfiltered, therefore cleaning for removing [PII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) and so-called [CSAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material) where applicable will be necessary.

Generally consistently good prose, although the messages do not have a very long length on average. The theme is non-adult RP with table-top RPG rules or gaming elements which may need some care when parsing into a format suitable for training. **Note 1**: early posts from years 2005-2007 may have some formatting issues, e.g. showing `& quot;` (without the space) in the messages, or with raw BB-like `[ooc]` tags. **Note 2**: Some OOC threads and GM threads also present, denoted by related tags in the thread title. **Note 3**: important information (OOC, dice rolls, story info) can be under spoiler tags, don't discard them.

### Usage notes
All message archive files are in .csv format. They can be easily processed in python using the `pandas` data processing library as follows:
```python
import pandas
data = pandas.read_csv(filename)
```
After doing so, most of the time the data will have 5 or more fields as in the following example:
```text
b.loc[211]
Out[211]: 
thread_title                              new idea, but need some help

### Some details
- Messages have been parsed by chronological order using threads first, then messages. In other words, messages from the same thread will be consecutive in the .csv files.
- `message` contains the message body in html format. To become fully usable for fine-tuning LLMs it will likely have to be rendered as text. The Python library [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) could be used for this.
- `message_timestamp` has not been normalized and thus may have different formats depending on the forum.
- Sometimes, thread labels or tags have been added too as separate fields.

### Suggested strategy for parsing and filtering the files
- Forums can have a lot of off-topic or non-RP threads. The latter _most of the time_ include "OOC" in the thread title. Such threads could be filtered away.
	- For Elliquiy, it is suggested to filter _away_ threads titles containing the strings: `OOC`, `O.O.C.` (out of character, i.e. non-RP/ERP talk); `Character Sheet`, `Character Profile`, `Character Thread`, `Character List`, `Character Roster` (these all contain character descriptions). However, note that `IC` or `in-character` means that the thread is in-topic, i.e. it contains proper role-play.
	- Note that sometimes Character and OOC can be in the same thread.
- For privacy reasons it might be best to anonymize usernames and scramble URLs originating from the forum where the messages have been posted. 
- Typically OOC (out of character) messages within in-topic threads will be enclosed with double parentheses `(( ))`, single parentheses with OOC marking `(OOC: )`; more rarely square parentheses are used as well `[ ]` `[OOC: ]`. However, often just single parentheses `( )` without other indications are used for OOC.
- Threads tend to have a more or less consistent posting style. It is suggested to filter complete threads away if the posts contain too many one-liners.
- Oftentimes there will only be 1 opening post, perhaps due to a failure to attract attention. In principle, these threads could be filtered away, but depending on the forum they are often also high-effort posts.
