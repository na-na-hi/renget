# Be Happy

Omori stepped into the Vast Forest to search for Happy, knife on the ready. It’s the second time she’s gotten herself lost in the woods, befitting of her hyperactive self. Bangs and Brows wanted to come along but Omori ordered them to stay put. The forest’s crawling with all sorts of nasties that could pounce on you at any moment — not a place suitable for little kids. Even though he would never admit it to anyone, their time together in the playground has endeared Omori to the young girl. One might even say that he’s come to see Happy as his own little sister.

“Can you be my big bro from now on?! Preeetty please!” the energetic girl once told him.

Omori nodded.

“Sure.”

“Yaaaay!”

Happy hugged the older boy and Omori had no choice but to hug back. It felt…nice.

A little sister that must be protected at all costs. 

Omori sat in the shade of a tree to rest his weary legs. He’s been walking for over an hour but Happy is still nowhere in sight. He’s never been one to worry about things, but Happy’s disappearance left a certain feeling of foreboding within him. Hero, Aubrey, and Kel were off helping Basil prepare for a house party and Omori didn’t want to burden them with the bad news, even though he knew they’d be willing to drop everything and help search for Happy at once. No, he had to do this alone.

“AHHHHHHHHH!”

Omori jumped up and ran to where he heard the cry, gripping the handle of the knife tightly.

There she was.

Happy managed to get herself up a tree and just beneath it was an angry bear, growling and scratching at the trunk with its massive, fearsome claws.

Happy spotted him immediately. “Big bro Omori, there you are! Heeeeeeelp meeeee!”

“Don’t move, I’ll take care of this.”

As if on cue, the bear turned its attention to him, slobbering like the disgusting creature that it is.

The bear pounced on him but Omori rolled sideways and picked up a rock. The thing with fighting enemies larger than him is that they tend to be predictable in their movement. Omori hurled the rock and hit the raging bear right on the forehead, dazing it. Now’s his chance.

Omori hacked at the bear, slashing its lower half thrice. The agitated bear roared and swiped its claws at him, grazing his right leg. Omori grimaced. That was close. Had he jumped just a second later, the bear would have inflicted serious damage on him. He can’t afford to be careless.

““Big bro, be careful! You got this!” Happy cheered.

Omori stood up again, reinvigorated by her encouragement.

The bear rushed at him like a bull but Omori wasn’t going to let it get what it wanted. He stared down at the beast just as it barreled towards him. The bear slowed down and stopped on its tracks, cautiously backing away. This is a skill he’s been honing for a long time, the power to intimidate foes no matter how big they are. It’s a skill that’s proven useful on many occasions. 

The boy walked slowly towards the now frightened bear, pointing his knife at it. How dare it threaten the life of someone he cares about. Just looking at it is enough to make his blood boil. Omori has become furious. The predator has become the prey. 

*Stab*

The bear yelps in pain.

“Go big bro Omori!”

And another stab, this time plunging his knife through its heart, killing it. Omori wanted to brutalize the bear some more but he remembered that Happy is watching everything. Omori shook his head, wiping the blood off his knife with some leaves scattered below the tree.

“Yay, I knew you could do it!” 

Happy jumped off the tree but thankfully Omori was fast enough to catch her. Typical Happy, always so reckless.

“You were soooooo cool big bro!”

Omori couldn’t help but smile.

“Are you okay?”


“Yep! I’m a-okay!” said the little girl, wrapping her tiny arms around his neck. Omori gently patted her head in response.

“Don’t go off on your own again, understand?”

“Okay, I won’t.”

“Just ask me or any of the older kids to come with you if you want to go somewhere.”

“Okay!”

Good. That was easier than he expected.




“Mister tutor! I’m done!”

Sunny opened his eyes and was greeted with Joy’s beaming face.

“I’ve finished my worksheet, can you see if I’ve gotten it right?”

Wow, he must’ve slept for quite a long time.

Sunny just stared at the little girl for over a minute.

“Mister tutor?”

Sunny smiled, giving her a headpat.

“I’ll have a look at it.”
