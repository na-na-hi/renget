#####Beginner Guide
　⠀
　⠀
• Where can I get the games?
Via 1337x - https://1337x.to/
Search Sims 4, sort by time, download with your preferred method (top of the page).

Via Anadius - https://sims.tarac.nl/the-sims-4/the-sims-4-selective-download/ - You can pick and choose which expansions you want if you want to cut down on filesize, or just grab the whole thing in one go.

Via Fitgirl - http://fitgirl-repacks.site/sims-4-deluxe-edition/
Via Games4TheWorld - https://www.games4theworld.club/t53-all-games4theworld-downloads# - Scroll down to "New Format Repacks"

`[!]The game usually only recieves new cracks when a major release (EP, GP or SP) happens, so you shouldn't expect minor bugfix patches to recieve cracks.`
`[!]There are no available torrents for OS X users. Torrent Windows 7, 8.1, or 10 first and install in Bootcamp, then torrent the fix.`
　
• What's CC?
CC is short for Custom Content, meaning mostly clothes and furniture.

• What's a script mod?
Mods that change the behavior of your game such as sex, murder or other new mechanics.

• How do I start modding my game?
First you have to launch your game, go to the settings menu, check "Enable Custom Content and Mods" and "Script Mods Allowed" then... you're all set! Installing mods is as easy and dragging and dropping the files into your Mods folder. It's usually at:
Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Mods
Remember that script mods can't be more than one folder deep into your Mods folder, or else trouble may happen.

• How do I optimize my CC?
To make your game run better, remove every special character from all CC you download (.package files), leaving only basic letters and numbers. Furthermore, merging them (with Sims 4 Studio) is said to also help with loading.

• Which game is best for lewding?
The Sims 4, being the most recent entry in the series, is naturally the better one for making lewds. It runs better than Sims 3, it's much easier to create sims, and its sex framework, Wicked Whims, is being constantly maintained. Unfortunately, 4 falls short on the gameplay side, and general consensus is that Sims 2 and 3 were better in that regard.

• How do I install sims I downloaded?
Much like installing mods, putting sims you got outside the gallery in your game is very easy. You just have to drop the tray files in the Tray folder and now they'll appear in your library. Folder's usually at:
Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\Tray
A very useful tool is Sims 4 Tray Importer, it will let you check mods what a specific household/lot is using, as well as get their Tray files for sharing. It also tells you if they're using overrides and if there are any override conflicts in your game.

• How do I lewd The Sims 2?
From the /tsg/ FAQ:
Fan favorite is Tits and Arse by Chris Hatch https://www.mediafire.com/file/h30p3kcc54vmp5m/The_Sims_2_Tits_and_Arse_Stuff.rar/file
Alternatively, there is also a family friendly version https://www.mediafire.com/file/pmzuvminycam80m/The_Sims_2_Angel_and_Nurses_Stuff.rar/file
To install these, take the folder of the pack you want to play (you can't have both installed) and drop it in C:\Program Files\EA Games. Run the .Reg file. Then take Sims2EP10.exe found in The Sims 2 Tits and Arse Stuff\TSBin, create a shortcut and put it on your desktop. You must run this .exe every time you want to play with this pack.
