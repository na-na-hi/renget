##Mouse gf size reversal

>your relationship with your micro mouse gf is solid, but has always been plagued by intimacy problems caused by the sheer size difference, but you think you've found the solution
>a new drug that allows a normal sized person to shrink down to micro size for a period of about 48 hours
>however, it is highly regulated and prohibitively expensive for someone of your economic status
>but eventually you're able to get your hands on a single dose after months of saving, all the while teasing your gf for a romantic weekend with a secret surprise
>the fateful Friday had finally arrived and you get home early from work while she's still running errands to prepare
>your house is already set up to accommodate a micro, but you still did a once over just to make sure there were no hiccups before finally setting up an appropriately sized table and meal in the front entryway to surprise her as soon as she walks in the door
>you receive a text from her saying she's minutes away and take the pill with a small amount of hesitation
>a few seconds of vertigo and blurry vision later, and you're mere inches tall and quickly take your seat for your date
>you eyes are so focused on the mouse sized door your gf usually enters through, you don't even notice the knob far above you start to turn
>you're shocked as the enormous door opens towards you, your gut reaction thinking it must be a burglar breaking in, but become even more confused when you recognize the colossal figure standing in the doorway as your cute, little mouse gf
>her eyes seem to scan the room as she looks in with a bewildered expression and begins to walk forward
>your blood runs cold as you realize she's on a collision course for your direct location and has yet to even glance downwards
>you narrowly leap out of the way just before her foot comes down and reduces the table you were sitting at to splinters
>noticing the crunch of something underfoot, she looks down and finally allows the two of you to gawk at each other at your newfound heights
>she quickly but gingerly scoops you up to ask you what happened and you relay your half of the story about your special plans up until her arrival
>she responds somewhat sheepishly that she had a similar idea when mentioned plans for a romantic weekend, and ended up getting a pill that would grow her to normal size and taking it before heading home
>you both stand there quietly for a bit as you digest these new developments that seemed to have ruined your weekend
>peering over the cliff formed by her palm at the scatter remains of the romantic feast, you break the silence by suggesting ordering a pizza for dinner
>soon tensions are smoothed over as your gf enjoys a pizza that hasn't been cut down to morsel size for the first time and you dig in a pepperoni the size of a trash can lid
>you then transition to the couch to watch a movie, bit both of you are too distracted to really follow the plot
>she, with her constant fawning over how cute you look and handling you like a doll, and you find being nestled in her subtle furred cleavage to be far more enjoyable than any kino could be
>the next day is filled with you just being amazed at experiencing life from each other heights and perspectives, and the next night trying things neither of you ever expected to be possible
>before you know it it's nearly Sunday evening and the two of you are again resting on the couch as a dizzy spell comes over your massive mouse gf
>you feel yourself plummeting and landing on the soft cushions below, next to you gf who is back to her normal height and roughly your size
>you intially back away, expecting to grow back at any second, but then realize she took her dose about an hour before yours, leaving you time that much longer as a micro
>you then stare deeply into your mouse gf's beautiful eyes, eye to eye for the first time ever, and embrace each other as a passionate kiss turns to love making
>Having connected like never before, you bask in the afterglow even long after you feel yourself grow back to your full height from under her as she rests on your chest
>planting another kiss on her sweet little head, you begin making plans for your next romantic weekend
