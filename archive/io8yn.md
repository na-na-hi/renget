#Soulmates in the Sunset

>It was a mild sunny summer day.
>The weather was nice, and everyone was having fun outside.
>Sunny looked through the window, seeing the beauty of Faraway.
>He wishes he could be there.
>But he had something important to do first.
>Something to do with his own stupid feelings.
>And what best to hear it than the boy that carries flowers and his best friend?
>"So, what did you want to talk to me Sunny?"
>Sunny turned his attention inside, Basil was taking care of his plants.
>"... It's... Complicated, and maybe long"
>"Well, we have all day right? And I don't mind, just open up!"
>"Hmm... Okay. Recently, I... I have been feeling strange"
>"Oh my, and how is this feeling?"
>"Hm, if I had to describe it, it's a mixture of being heated up from the inside, and feeling a little wobbly and gooey..."
>"Huh, I might have an idea of what that might be... and I think you do too Sunny"
>"I-I... I don't know what you are talking about..."
>Sunny was heating up considerably, of course Basil would know that he knows, but saying it out loud was just too embarrassing.
>"C'mon Sunny, let's not play around, who is it?"
>Basil already turned his attention to him, curious eyes daring him to just say it
>"It's..."
>"It's..?"
>"It's... I-It's Hero!"
>"Woah!"
>Sunny already turned away, face fully red, Basil had a very amused expression at the distance, extremely excited.
>"You and Hero! Oh my this is amazing! You two are perfect for each other! Did you already tell him?"
>"Of course not, he would reject me on the spot"
>"Oh no this won't do, Hero would never do such a thing! Do you see how he treats you? He is so nice and gentle and sweet with you! He is like your prince charming in person!"
>"But he is that way with everyone..."
>"Nah ah! He might be extremely nice with everyone, but he is extra extra nice with you especially~ Didn't you notice he always is making steak when you stay at their house?"
>"I... I guess he does"
>"Of course he does!"
>"So... is there any chance for me?"
>"Yeah doofus! We will get you two together!"
>A hopeful but flustered look appeared on Sunny's face, maybe he will be able to do it...
>"And I'm calling Aubrey to help!"
>"Wait, don't tell Aubrey!"
>"Too late~ The more help the better, there is no time to waste! Love calls!!"
---
>In another place on this same sunny day, was another duo.
>Kel and Hero we're playing basketball together, Kel was quite close to winning, but Hero wasn't slacking either.
>"So... About your weird feeling you've been having lately"
>"Yeah about that, I think, I think it's the same one"
>The basketball was dribbled between the two of them, the sound of it kicking in the ground loud enough for both to hear.
>"Wow! I'm so happy for you bro! Who is the lucky one?"
>"It's..."
>Hero stumbled, Kel quickly catching the ball
>"It's... Sunny."
>Hero says as Kel did a slam dunk.
>"Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
>Kel looked incredulous and shocked at the revelation, Hero on the other hand put his arms in front of his face as he decided to lay on the ground, legs too weak to stand up now.
>"Bro that is so..."
>"Silly..."
>"AMAZING!!"
>Hero left an exasperated sigh, he suddenly felt much more tired.
>"That isn't silly! That is incredible!! Did you tell him that?"
>"Of course not, he probably doesn't even think of me that way..."
>Kel was pondering excitedly about this, his brother finally found love again!! He couldn't be more happy.
>Hero on the other hand seemed embarrassed, a huge weight lifted from his chest for finally saying it to someone, but that didn't ease his stomach butterflies.
>Kel sat down next to him
>"Hey bro, I don't think Sunny would reject you, he really cares about you y'know?"
>Hero removed the arms from his face to look at Kel
>"He has been listening to you all summer, you playing your guitar, your cooking, even when you were talking about your boring medical school"
>"But that is just Sunny isn't it?"
>"I don't think so, one day you ended up falling asleep on your desk after working so much, he was the one who put a blanket on you"
>Hero gave him a sleepish look, but a small gentle smile crept in his face
>"That is why I think you should go for it bro!! You are amazing and you and Sunny would be super cool!! And if he rejects ya that just means he has terrible taste, but I know that won't happen!!
>"Huh... Thanks Kel, you became really good with your words recently."
>Kel rubbed the back of his neck with a shy grim.
>The basketball rolled over to Hero's side.
>Hero picks it up and hits the hoop perfectly.
>"I won by the way" Hero says with a smirk.
>"No hecking way!!!" Kel got trolled.
---
>In Aubrey's house
>"Seriously? Hero?"
>"...Yeah"
>Aubrey looked baffled but not in a bad way, she seemed overall happy for Sunny, who is currently dying of embarrassment now
>"That is... Actually kinda cute, so, how did it start?"
>"I know right? And I'm also curious."
>Sunny sighed, preparing to explain his feelings to his two childhood friends
>"I... I think it start some months ago, I sometimes see Hero coming out of his college, and we talk sometimes"
>"One of these days, it was raining, and I forgot my umbrella"
>The Aubrey and Basil seemed to be about to launch out of their chairs with excitement.
>"I had to go to my home quickly since my mother accidentally left the stove on"
>"I was waiting for the rain to clear, in front of a restaurant"
>"Then Hero suddenly appeared there, a little wet, he seemed to have forgotten his umbrella as well."
>"We talked, he said he didn't mind the rain much since he had nothing left to do that day, but I think he saw how nervous I was... And asked me what was wrong"
>"I explained my situation, and he understood it quickly"
>"He suddenly removed his jacket, and gave it to me, I asked what he was doing and he said 'Well, you need to get home and this rain won't stop, so we will need to run a little'"
>Sunny was fondly remembering this, the other two seemed about to cry with how cute it was.
>"After he put his jacket on my head, he offered me his hand"
>"After that my face seemed to heat up whenever he was with me, and I spoke much less so, more than usual anyway"
>"And I took it... and we started running in the rain"
>"All the time we were giggling and laughing, not caring much about what was happening, we were having so much fun, and before I knew, we were at the front of my home"
>The other two were giggling themselves now, Sunny had a small smile on his face.
>"When he left to go back he had forgotten his jacket with me"
>"...It took me some days to give it back"
>The other two suddenly screamed in excitement
>"That. Was. So cute!" Aubrey beamed, scaring poor Bun-Bun
>"You two are perfect for each other" Bai said with a wide smile
>Sunny couldn't help but crack his own smile at the energy of these two
>Maybe they could be meant to be.
---
>Hero and Kel sat in the park, resting from their heated game
>"So, how long have you been feeling this way?"
>Hero finished drinking his bottle of water empty.
>"Hm, I guess some months ago"
>Hero was thinking intently about when it happened, Kel had a curious look on his face
>"Well I want the details now!"
>With an unusual shy look on his face, Hero recalls the details of that day.
>"In the city, I often see Sunny when I leave my college for the day, we usually talk"
>"One of these days, Sunny seemed quite tired"
>"We sat down on a bench in the park, the day was already setting"
>"We were talking like we usually do, but slowly he stopped talking"
>"I thought he had just nothing more to say, as it is common for Sunny... But, suddenly I felt a weight on my shoulder"
>"I looked to the side and... he was sleeping there, resting his head on my shoulder"
>Hero recalled that moment with a smile on his face, Kel was gleaming at the distance.
>"I didn't want to disturb him, I knew how hard Sunny worked so any sleep is good for him, and I stayed there like this for some long while"
>"For some reason I decided to look at him again, more closely this time"
>Hero felt his cheeks burning, Kel was even more interested.
>"Seeing him this close, his eyes, his nose, his... mouth, so gently there, without the stoic look he seemed to have every day... I guess I just found it too beautiful..."
>"After that I stayed there with him until he woke up from his nap, he tried apologizing but I said I didn't mind, but he insisted, he accompanied me to my dorm as an apology, and the day ended."
>"I remember my cheeks burning a little after that, and I had difficulty forming the words in my mouth"
>Kel jumped out from his sit
>"Bro that was so beautiful!! You were... And he was... Wow!! You are like soulmates and stuff!!
>Hero laughed a little at Kel's enthusiasm, his cheeks burned all the same.
>"We have to get you two together! You are meant to be!!"
>"Wow Kel calm down!"
>But Kel was already babbling at the distance.
>Hero amusingly shook his head with a smile.
>Maybe they could be meant to be.
---
>Back at Aubrey's house
>Aubrey, Basil and half of the Hooligans were there.
>Sunny wasn't sure when and where did they come from
>"So, I have called the Hooligans, for a very important mission"
>"Where are the rest of the Hooligans?" Basil asked
>Only Charlene and Vance were there.
>"I don't know, probably doing their own stuff somewhere"
>"So what is the plan boss?" Vance inquired
>"As I explained Sunny is secretly madly in love with Hero, but they aren't together yet, our mission today is to make them boyfriends"
>"Can't he just confess?" Vance said
>"No..." Charlene quietly but firmly said.
>"I agree with Charlene, she is a specialist in love matters, that is why I'm glad she is here"
>"Fine I guess"
>Sunny was silently nodding at Aubrey and Charlene and their plan, he doesn't think he would be able to confess"
>"So 'Lene, what is the plan?"
>Everyone was dead silent to hear Charlene's plan, she talked very quietly
>"To get with him... we will need to employ hard romance tactics..."
>"So I have concocted a fail-proof 3 parts plan..."
>"First we will need Sunny to bring a gift to Hero... To warm him up"
>Everyone was nodding at her
>"Then we will trip him, so you can catch him in your arms"
>Everyone was nodding but Sunny seemed unsure if he was going to be able to catch Hero
>"And finally you will corner him in a secluded space... so his attention is all on you... And you will say your feelings to him..."
>"That will guarantee that you will be together."
>Charlene seemed proud of her plan, Vance seemed confused, Aubrey had a serious thinking expression, Basil was clapping, and Sunny was sweating bullets.
>"Alright! We are doing this today! Prepare yourselves guys, because love is about to be delivered!!" Aubrey screamed
>"Yes!!" Everyone else said
>Minus Sunny, he wanted to bury himself in the dirt at this moment
>May God have mercy on him...
---
>In Kel and Hero's house...
>"Kel... What is the meaning of this?"
>"So, I have made a group" Kel said with a serious face
>"Seriously Kel? Aubrey called me to do some stuff and what for?" Kim said
>In the room was Kel with half of the hooligans, THE MAVERICK, Angel and Kim, preparing their own love plan for this day.
>"Of course to bring Hero and Sunny together duh? I explained it to you!"
>"...huh? Sorry I wasn't listening"
>"You..!"
>"Now now calm down my partner in crime and my rival, we are here to make love happen, correct?" THE MAVERICK calmed both down.
>"Yeah yeah, right. So, with this team, we are going go to make Sunny, fall in love with you!!"
>Hero gulped, he was feeling nervous, normally he is very good at socializing but this is something else.
>"Are we sure we need all of this?"
>"Yeah this seems like overcomplicating things"
>Hero and Kim seemed to be in agreement
>"Of course! Sunny can be quite the hard rock to pass through so we need to pull all the stops with this!!"
>"Oh we seem to be thinking alike for once my rival! Indeed the dance of love is complicated and needs to be carefully thought out, not for me of course and a master at this already!"
>"I agree with my master! If anybody knows about romance it's him... And the Sunny guy is kinda creepy so we need to plan it very well."
>Kim could only look at the idiot trio with resentment, 4 nerds wasting her time with this idiocy... Oh well, she supposes she has nothing to do now so why not?
>Hero thought this was a terrible idea but it's not like he has a better one at the moment.
>"So... The plan will consist of 4 steps!"
>"The first one is gifting sweets! As my siblings say there is no faster way to get to a man's heart than through their stomach!"
>"And a women's too hahaha!!" Kim beamed
>"Second you will read our script of love, where you will prep him for your confession"
>"I, THE GRAND MAVERICK, will write it personally for you, dear Hero."
>Kel then continued explaining
>"Then we will make a light 'accident' happen to Sunny, so you will save him in time!"
>"That sounds extremely dangerous..." Hero said his worries.
>Angel jumped in.
>"Don't worry Sir Hero! I'm a master at setting traps so no real harm will come to Sunny!"
>Hero sighed "Okay then."
>And finally THE MAVERICK finished
>"And lastly you will read our confession script, that will seal the deal and he will be yours right then and there!!"
>"Sounds stupid and bound to fail, I'm in." Kim said
>Kel exasperated
>"What a way to have faith in us..."
>"We will begin the plan today! So prepare yourselves cupids! Because love is happening today!!"
>"Yes!" The group screamed
>Hero's only thought that today was the day he was going to die...
---
>The time has come
>Both lovebirds were already in position
>It was a nice sunny afternoon in the park
>Althought it was supposed to be a very romantic event, it felt more like a battlefield
>Well, they do say love is war
>The Sun group was already prepared, talking through ear communicators.
>"Charlene, how is the gift?"
>"Sunny is already carrying it... It's a limited edition Papa Chip's cookbook, signed by the author himself..."
>"Okay, Basil, how are the bees going?"
>"They are ready at any moment to fly, it's sure to drive away anyone and leave the area isolated for them!"
>"Got it, Vance, How is the tripping trap going?"
>"I set already 3 of them Aubs, now we just need to wait for your signal to trigger them"
>"Okay, I'm already in position, Sunny?"
>"... I-I'm... I'm fine, I think"
>"Hmm, okay, crap Hero's coming, stay calm Sunny, we will be here for ya, good luck"
>And so it started, the warring date.
>Meanwhile
>The Cookies team was setting up their own plan, communicating through their walkie-talkies
>"Mikha- I mean THE MAVERICK, how is the script?
>"Oh of course it's marvelous! With our bachelor's charms and this there is no chance to fail!"
>"Great! Kim how are the sweets?"
>"Some Oreo-flavor chocolate truffles!! This took a while to make but oh boy if you are right Sunny has amazing taste!"
>"I personally prefer orange flavors-"
>"*cough* Kel!"
>"Oh right, Angel how are the traps going?"
>"Going great! I have set many all around the park, for many different situations too!"
>"Amazing job! And... Hero!"
>"I already have the sweets in hand, the script for love prep in my hand, and mentally prepared to save Sunny from any of the traps!"
>"That is my superbro! And hey! Sunny is at the park, exactly where Basil told you he would be!"
>"I'm going to observe to make sure everything goes right! Good luck bro"
>As Hero saw Sunny, he deeply inhaled, he can do this
>How bad can the situation get anyway?
---
>Both plans were in motion now
>"Hey Sunny! Nice to see you here!"
>"Hi Hero, it's nice to see you here too."
>"..."
>"..."
>"I have something for you." Both said simultaneously
>"Umm I was walking through the Hobbeez and I saw this limited edition Papa Chip cookbook and it reminded me of you..."
>"W-Wow thanks Sunny, this is amazing! It's even signed?! This is the best gift ever"
>Sunny rubbed his neck awkwardly, extremely flustered but equally as proud of himself.
>"Ah here, something for you, I was testing out some new chocolate truffle recipes and decided to eat it here in the park, but I already have so many in my house so I'm giving them to you, I think you will like them a lot!"
>Sunny carefully took the chocolate sweets and tasted them
>His eyes lit up
>He chewed and gulped them quite fast, making a silly face
>He looked at Hero with a sleepish face
>"They were delicious, thank you a lot"
>"No problem haha! If you don't have anything to do now why don't we go to the park hang out a little?"
>"I would like to."
>The operators whispered at the distance
>"Okay guys, part one of the plan done! Start part two!" Both Kel and Aubrey said to their respective teams!
>While both were walking through the park, Hero prepared to read his script in his hand
>"Hero, did you cut your hair?"
>"Oh you noticed haha, yeah I did, but it was just a little trim though."
>"It looks nice on you."
>"Thanks, yours don't look half bad either" Hero said with a smirk
>"Oh no, the hair looks good on you but you are still an old guy" Sunny said, in an ironic tone that only Hero seemed to know.
>"Oh c'mon now, I'm only 3 years older than you" Hero faked being offended
>"True, I suppose, still an old man"
>"Okay okay you win this round, but one day I will be able to tease you too"
>"I can't wait"
>"..."
>"..."
>He felt like this was the perfect time to start phase 2
>"So, Sunny"
>"Hm?"
>"How is it going, with everyone I mean"
>"Fine, I guess"
>It was the moment to strike
>"Have you, taken, the liking of someone?"
>Sunny stammered, he wasn't expecting this
>"N-no, I don't think so anyway..."
>Hero frowned a little at that but-
>"Hero don't get sad! That just means his heart still can be taken!"
>At Kel's words Hero breathed a little and prepared for the next part
>"And you?"
>Perfect, Sunny chimed in the exact response he wanted, which makes things easier
>"Hmm I guess I did have taken the liking of someone, they have pretty dark eyes, hair as dark as the night, and..."
>"Hero leaned a little to read the note in his palm, a little sweaty but still legible
>Sunny seemed to notice something but Hero quickly retreated his hand
>"... And an extremely kind and hardworking p-personality!"
>Sunny frowned a bit at that but the description could be about him so he didn't fret.
>Hero sighed to himself in relief
>"Alright guys it's time to start part 3 of our plan" Kel said to Team Cookies
>"Trap time" Said Kel and Aubrey at the same time.
---
>While talking and walking, both Kel/Angel and Aubrey/Vance were preparing to trigger their traps
>"Okay guys, I think they are getting close, how is the situation from your vision Vance?"
>"They are very close to one of the traps Aubs, Hero just needs to come a little to the left."
>"Okay, Sunny are you ready? Say our secret code word if you are"
>Sunny prepared himself, he just needs to get Hero in the trap's range, easy.
>"I've been missing eating *apples* every day, they are quite expansive there"
>"Okay guys he said the word, prepare yourself Vance"
>In the other team
>"Sir Kel! Sunny is very close to one of my traps! He just needs to go a little to the right"
>"Okay! Bro you ready? Just say the code word!"
>Hero readied himself, luckily Sunny's words will help him on that.
>"Really? There is this local *store" that has then for very cheap, I can show you when we get back."
>"Hero said it! Let's go Angel!"
>As both groups readies themselves for the moment, Hero and Sunny prepare each other for their respective traps
>"I would like that" Sunny moves slightly to the right to nudge Hero to the left
>"Great! Can't wait!" Hero moves slightly to the left to nudge Sunny to the right
>"3..."
>"2..."
>"1..."
>"Now!" Both Aubrey and Kel announced
>Both traps were triggered.
>Sunny trips as Hero stumbles forward, both weren't expecting this.
>Hero catches Sunny in his arms as both fall to the ground
>"Wait what happened!" Aubrey says nervously
>"Did something go wrong?!" Kel says shocked
>"uhh... What happened..?... Hero?"
>"Ouch, Sunny are you okay?
>As Sunny opens his eyes, he sees that he fell right on top of Hero
>They were extremely close now
>Sunny quickly scrambles out of Hero
>"Sorry s-sorry... Are you hurt?"
>"N-No I'm not! Are you hurt?"
>Sunny shakes his head, both blushing immensely, but relieved as well.
>The groups sigh in relief as well.
>"Thank God nothing bad happened, is the plan still on the table?" Basil asked the Aubrey
>"Hmm, seems fine to continue"
>"Are you sure?" THE MAVERICK asked Kel.
>"Love can still happen today! We aren't giving up now!"
>"For the final phase!" Both Kel and Aubrey announced.
>They were almost there.
---
>"Okay Basil, there is still a bunch of people here, we need to drive them away!"
>"Right Aubrey! Ready to release the bees at any time!"
>"Perfect, we just need to wait for them to be in a secure place, Sunny! You know what to do!"
>Sunny breathed in and out, the previous accident left him a little wobbly but he is fine.
>"It's getting kinda hot, let's sit down close to that tree over there."
>"It's our chance! The place is kinda private, perfect for a romantic confession! Go for it Hero!!"
>As they approached the tree's shade, Basil was already getting ready to release the bees.
>"What do you think Basil?"
>"Hmm, yeah, yeah! It's the perfect place! At your order Aubrey!"
>Sunny and Hero reach the shade, and sit down to catch their breath
>"Wow that was intense huh?"
>"...It was."
>"Okay Hero get ready! Mikhael, it's your part!"
>"It's THE MAVERIC- Wait, calm down, it's my time to shine now, dear Hero, let's do this!"
>Hero was extremely nervous, but he was ready, today he steals Sunny's heart.
>"Sunny... I have to tell you something." THE MAVERICK started saying, Hero copying it word for word on his end.
>Sunny looked to Hero, curious and expectant eyes on him
>"Ever since the day we met again, a year back, we've had ups and downs, and yet, we persevered, despite our heart's own problems..." Hero was tomato red saying embarrassing cheesy stuff like that.
>"And still, throughout all this time, no matter what happened, we stayed together, and, in that time something blossomed in me..."
>Sunny's eyes beamed brighter than any star on the night sky at this point, but...
>"Basil! At my signal, release the bees!!"
>"Iyah!!!"
>buzzing could be heard at the distance, and surely enough, the bees drove away almost everyone in the park, the lovers luckily did not notice, others weren't as lucky.
>"Wait, what is happening?" Kim inquired.
>"These are... Bees!!" Angel screamed.
>"The two are safe, but... Isn't that where Mikhael is!?" Kel expressed worriedly.
>"Sunny, what I want to say to you my dear is- BEES!! Aaaaaaahh!!!" And so THE MAVERICK screamed, together with Hero.
>"W-what?" Sunny said puzzled.
>THE MAVERICK ran as quickly as he could to the lake, Team Cookies scrambled nervously.
>"Kim! Angel! Go see if Mikhael is okay, I can handle everything for now! Hero, try to fix this!"
>Hero wanted to die, maybe he would go to some nice place with a cloud beach on a cloud ocean- no, he had to do this, no running away!
>"O-oh umm, I meant- what I wanted to say-, I... I thought there were bees on your hair!! Yeah, that is it!!"
>"Wait... what is this on your ear?"
---
>Angel and Kim ran to THE MAVERICK'S rescue, something caught Vance's attention
>"Aaaahh!!" Someone got caught in his trap.
>"Aubs! Someone got caught in our traps."
>"Really? Damn, Vance! Charlene! Go check if the person is alright!"
>"Yes!" Both said and went to check it out.
>Upon going there they found...
>Angel? Sis?!" Vance exclaimed
>"Vance?!" Kim screamed
>THE MAVERICK was getting out of the lake, completely soaked, Kim was trying to get Angel out of the trap
>"So the traps were from you guys!"
>"Trap*s*? So you were the ones who sabotaged our traps"
>"Wait wait wait a minute. Are you saying you guys were helping dear Sunny? While we were helping dear Hero?!"
>"...Seems to be the case..."
>Vance disarms his trap and gets Angel out of there.
>"So what now?" Angel says
>"I don't know, let's just wait it out I guess, plus, now that we know the gig, it might be fun to see it haha!" Kim gleamed
>"And we put a lot of effort in it too..!" Charlene chimed in.
>"Let's go then my partners in crime!"
---
>"W-what? No no there is nothing here! Nothing at all". Hero scrambled for excuses
>Sunny carefully took Hero's hands out of his ear, finding his communicator plugged into a walkie-talkie in his waist.
>"...Sorry..." Hero looked embarrassed
>Sunny got angry, with himself.
>"No, I... I too, was using one..." Sunny removed his communicator, Hero looked silently shocked.
>"I was talking to Aubrey and she was... she was helping me, she set up traps and bees and... Huh..." Sunny sighed
>"Huh, I was talking to Kel, and he did the same thing heh."
>Aubrey, Kel and Basil were surprised at the revelation, and rushed to find each other.
>"You dumbass! You ruined the whole thing!" Aubrey exasperated
>"*I* ruined it? You were the one who blew it up with the bees!" Kel threw back at her.
>"You two shut up!"
>Kel and Aubrey stopped and looked at Basil
>"We both did something dumb and almost ruined things for our friends, trying to pin the blame on someone is not going to solve anything!"
>"And look! It seems like they are solving this by themselves.
>Sunny had a frustrated look on his face, but Hero started laughing
>"Why are you laughing at this? This was just so pathetic..."
>"Hahaha, sorry! But it's just so silly, I-, we, did all of this, for what? I don't know, I'm an idiot, I should have just been honest... With you."
>Sunny started laughing a little too
>"Then I guess we are both idiots, all these plans and traps and gifts, when I just wanted to talk to you."
>"Can we start over, please?"
>Sunny nodded.
>"Ever since some months ago, we've been talking, and I think, I started feeling differently about you."
>"Every time we talked I just wouldn't be able to stop looking at you, the way you played the violin, the way you silently and calmly spoke, how gently but diligently you handled the things you liked, your face, your small soft smile..."
>"Before I knew I just couldn't stop thinking about, remembering you left a warm feeling in my heart, and I just wanted to be with you more and more."
>Sunny's heart was pounding out of his chest.
>"Sorry I'm bumbling now but after everything, I just couldn't find time to tell you how much you made me happy and how I wanted so desperately to tell you-"
>A kiss
>For a moment, everything seemed to stop, this kiss to Hero was the only way he thought to tell him his feelings.
>"- I love you..."
>"... I-I love you too..." Sunny sheepishly said.
>"I wanted to say this to you so many times, but I couldn't find the right time, your warmth, your touch, your smile, your honest and unrelenting kindness, I fell in love with all of you and I'm so glad that I finally could say it to you!"
>"Do you really mean it!?" Hero said holding Sunny's face in his hands.
>Sunny nodded "Every single word", small tears going down his face.
>"T-Thank you, thank you so much!" Hero tightly hugged Sunny, tears going down his face.
>"I'm so so happy now!!" Hero separated from Sunny, only to kiss him again, deeper this time, both couldn't stop smiling.
>At the distance, the trio and the Hooligans stared at the pair, tears going down their faces
>"I-It's so beautiful!!" Kel was crying rivers of tears.
>"Yeah, yeah it is." Aubrey wiped her eyes.
>"We failed but we did it! Love happened today!" Basil smiled warmly, tears on his face.
>"Plans, traps, gifts, all of that, when I just needed you..." Hero said, brushing Sunny's hair out of his face and cupping it.
>"That is just so cheesy" Sunny corresponded by placing his hand on top of Hero's.
>"But it's true! Haha!"
>"...Yeah, having you here, is enough for me, Henry."
>Sunny rested his forehead on Hero's, as the sunset washed away the Sun's light
>Two people that were lonely, found closure on each other, from now on and forever, they would be happy
>Because soulmates aren't chosen by fate, but by each other.
