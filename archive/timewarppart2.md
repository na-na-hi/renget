>you're only a few days into a long term cargo run through a twisted region of space called 'The Scar'
>it means your clients will get their parcel almost immediately after you departed
>from their frame of reference
>from yours it's still going to be a while
>you're travelling with your engineer-copilot-human-anthropology-expert Dreughbachus 
>a lithe, attractive and boyish alien man with the characteristics of an earth black bear
>you refer to him as drew for the sake of simplicity
>the highly-hyphenated series of adjectives attached to him has just expanded to include -romantic-partner
>a relatively long awaited development considering the escapade for which you are both best known
>you're both superlative diplomats according to the galactic trade federation
>accolades acquired as a result of performing extreme, unprompted sex acts in the presence of a massive crowd of puritanical bug-people
>on a holiday dedicated to chastity
>yes, really
>you weren't even interested in drew before that
>and you didn't even have a clue that he was interested in you
>owing to the out of date knowledge of earth culture drew possesses due to the suspension of earth observation 150 earth years ago
>he waited until you were a captive audience to reveal his true feelings
>to which you whiffed your response badly
>you recovered quite smoothly though
>discounting the fact that you almost died from staring out at a particularly angry part of space

>it's been a couple days since your first proper sexual contact with drew
>so profound was the experience of your dicks touching that you decided you needed just a little bit of time
>to put your thoughts straight
>or gay as fuck as the case may be
>in the moment you felt like nothing could be more right in the world than being the bear boy's gay lover
>you're doubting that just a little
>naturally 
>before your introduction to the strange and vast world you've found yourself in
>and your claim-to-fame  parasite-induced-homolust-outburst
>you were pretty sure about your sexuality
>perfectly confident you were not interested in men of any description
>what changed?
>are you just absurdly touch starved and lonely?
>did those grey motherfuckers alter your brain?
>was it the mites? is all of this just lingering after effects?
>is drew betraying your trust and using some kind of sci-fi means to exploit you for his own ends?
>he did say your brain scan looked "better"
>it hurts you deeply to consider the last one
>it must show on your face
>drew has sat down beside you, putting a hand on your shoulder
>"what's up man? you've been kinda -withdrawn."
>"for a while now" 
>"here I was thinking we'd be hanging off of each other like pupating splitflies"
>"then you go and get homesick or something on me"
>"I know how that goes, my people are really tight knit"
>"I had a lot of trouble in the early part of my engineering training"
>"I feel bad I can't relate to how it must feel to know you'll never go b-"
>"oh, sorry"
>the contact and drew's words help a lot for a moment
>then they turn against you as the doubt and fear still grip you
>it's not about all of that, drew
>honestly, you're a little disappointed in yourself for how easy it was to get over the whole 'never going home' thing
>you tell him that you're having an existential crisis right now
>you're having a hard time getting your feelings in order
>about him
>about yourself and your identity
>"I know that relationships like ours aren't looked upon favorably on earth"
>"but you should know, it's hard to find people so judgmental under the federation"
>"we're both safe as far as that goes, bud"
>"I did wait until we were underway on this run just in case" 
>"so you wouldn't run off on your own and do something stupid"
>you tell him, weeping at this point, that it's not that big of a deal in most places on earth anymore
>you're not much concerned with that either
>you're terrified you're not the same person who left earth
>scared that something has been DONE to you
>"as far as I can tell, nothing about you has changed"
>"it's a matter of the heart, in the terms of your antiquity"
>and the terms of the present
>"if all of this makes you happy"
>"if ~I~ make you happy"
>"there's no reason to second guess yourself"
>"maybe you did change"
>"maybe that's a good thing"
>"maybe you've found somewhere you feel like you're not the only outsider"
>"for sure though, you've got someone on your side"
>"I love you, man" "I mean that"
>your resolve is tested and broken as the weeping devolves into outright crying
>you grab drew and pull him into the tightest hug you can muster to cry into his shoulder
>you tell him over and over that you love him too
>even with family that was rare for you to say
>but with drew it's effortless
>it's almost the only thing you want to say

>"Ha!" "You're such a fuckin' sap"
>you look up, not having expected such a response from drew
>his own yellow-green eyes are at least misty
>and he has an awkward, slightly unsure smile on his face
>he stumbled a bit trying to break the tension
>all the black fur makes it hard to tell exactly whether he fared better than you in restraining the welling up of his own emotion
>"that's nice though" "it means I can trust you not to pull any stoic garbage on me if things get tough"
>"I always hate to see people hide their emotions and problems 'for someone else's sake'"
>"It always gives me the feeling that at least one of the people involved has been presenting a less than honest version of themselves"
>"how can they claim to love someone that much when they choose to keep them out of the loop when things go wrong with their health or finances?"
>"I was a little concerned I'd have to come to understand it myself"
>"what with your 'dashing and talented rogue-who-skirts-the-rules act"
>"I knew it was just a faÃ§ade for drumming up interesting work in the cantinas"
>hey, you can still be a perfectly hoopy frood, even if you do have a sensitive side
>"first of all" "I get the feeling that I'd really enjoy whatever it is you got that joke from"
>"I thought I'd lose out on our little cultural exchange game after I revealed that I'm more clued in than you thought"
>"also, sensitive ~side?~" "I think it's at least a sensitive two-thirds" "maybe three-quarters"
>"you melted right into this couch as soon as I touched you"
>"not to mention that cute look of desperately wanting on your face every time I wasn't kissing you"
>your desire to make one of your one sided jokes outweighs your capacity to do so on the spot
>in lieu of actual wit you say
>you're lucky I can't think of a joke good enough for the opportunity you just gave me
>"what opportunity?"

>there's a musical act on earth who released a song of middling success titled 'Desperately Wanting'
>called 'better than ezra'
>you got as far as making the connection and deciding that there's a good joke there
>then you just ran out of steam
>just now you get it
>damn, you could have said 
>I hope I'm better than ezra at giving that look
>now that you've explained it
>there's no joke and it's not funny
>"you mean you've managed to get every one of those you thought of out as a response to something I said? "Until just now?"
>"you're like one of those guys your nobles used to hire to distract and insult them"
>who sneer jokes in parrots' robe?
>"Uh, I think so?"
>that makes you a Harlequin who's coined a pointless game then?
>"yeah, I'll say" "what's with the prosaic langua-" "oh"
>If he didn't get it on his own
>the stupid little celebratory jig you're doing with just your upper body would have tipped him off 
>you tell drew to start the streak counter back up at two 
>he's back to giving you easy ones

>with your emotions in order and your mind at ease
>in a way it hasn't been since you were abducted
>hell, in a way it may never have been so at ease before
>you ask drew what he meant about 'hanging off of each other'
>"I planned this run out specifically so we'd be cooped up together without much to do"
>"besides getting... uh."
>"especially familiar with our preferences and each other's bodies"
>"I wasn't expecting so much baggage to work through, I'm more than happy to be here for it though"
>all that sounds good to you
>it seems like he's the one getting most familiar with you
>you'd like to even the score
>you've got to come up with a cool line:
>would your dick be happy to be here? you say pointing to your mouth like a dork
>that was cooler in your head
>actually doing it was more awkward than a Final Fantasy cutscene
>drew partially restrains laughter as he says
>"yeah I-I think so"
>"I wasn't sure you were the type for that"
>you told him you'd be willing to suck his dick already
>"you did?"
>just before you- right
>that probably got lost
>in the whole barging-in-on-your-roommate-jerking-off-then-collapsing-on-the-floor-shaking thing
>well, you're going to make up for that now

>drew stands up and presses the button on his side to remove his suit
>should you do the same?
>it'd be cleaner if you didn't
>fuck it
>dirty's cool with you
>especially the kind of dirty you'll get from the lewdicrous torrent of pre drew's going to hit you with
>so you, too, stand up and press your own button
>what would happen if you did that while sitting down?
>"when taking it off?" "not much, the unit might embed itself in the thing you're sitting on"
>"putting it on, you'd get pinned to your seat like a vacuum seal"
>sounds like something some people might be interested in
>you don't actually know what to do now
>do you get on your knees? sit back down?
>"whichever you want, man" "I'm not too big on taking the lead myself"
>"remember, if you can't handle all the... fluid, just stop and tell me"
>"this isn't exactly a common practice back home, for obvious reasons"
>you decide you're going do this on your knees
>that's how it's supposed to go, right?
>at eye level with drew's solidly light pink dick you decide to start with gentle touching and some ball fondling to get it to attention
>It's just a little smaller than yours, which not to toot your own horn, still means it's a little imposing
>his balls aren't small by any means, but the sack is tight and round
>cute, as far as that descriptor can apply to a scrotum
>which in your book is all the way
>you'd be licking and sucking on them right now if you weren't concerned about the slightly-lighter-than-the-rest-of-him fur
>again, fuck it
>here's hoping the suit cleans your teeth
>you take one into your mouth
>with just your lips at first
>then you nervously let it in past your teeth to let your tongue run over it
>"hey I-I wasn't exp-ecting th-aa-t"
>his voice faltering and shifting with your oral manipulations

>you let that nut go and turn your attention to the other
>this time you're much more confident as you suck it into your mouth
>no pre-staging in front of your teeth
>it goes straight in and you make gentle but deliberate motions with your tongue
>delicately sliding over the ball in all the directions and patterns you can manage
>"fuck, are you s-sure you ha-ha-h~aven't done this b~befo-o-re?
>your head and back are now absolutely soaked by the sheer volume of pre that has gushed from drew's cock with each throb and twitch
>"you're not g~on~na get to the .good. part at this r-a~a-ate"
>on that relatively clear instruction you back off and let him cool down
>it gives you a moment to think about how you'll deal with the veritable fountain you're faced with
>are you a quitter in these circumstances? can you invoke the mercy-rule?
>"I don't know if you're just that good or if I'm just unprepared"
>"seeing as no one of reasonable caution would try such a thing with a Br man"
>you're only just now learning what his people are called?
>one sound?
>'man' is technically one sound so you're in the same boat
>or were, until relatively recently
>still are in plenty of contexts
>stop getting distracted by linguistics
>there's bear dick to suck

>you're going to be on a time limit once it's in your mouth
>a shame, really
>but your stomach can only hold so much
>you're gonna have to do the majority of the work before it goes in
>the treatment you gave his balls was a successful test of your sexual intuition
>which you can now confidently apply elsewhere
>like the base of his shaft
>you drag your tongue across the underside in passes that are parallel with his pelvis
>ending each with an exaggerated lick up the near side
>you switch sides occasionally
>to better distribute your attention
>sometimes you throw in small circles and swirls
>and sometimes you just barely prod his dick with your tongue
>"not to complain or anything"
>"but there's no sucking happening"
>"this is more than good enough though, fuck"
>you're getting there
>you reach the head
>which has no frenulum on the underside
>because there's no foreskin
>instead there's a short, dense sheath at the base
>you roll your tongue around the very tip to draw out another spurt of fluid
>it's warm and thinner than water, somehow, with only a slight hint of the same raw egg white quality from before
>you're still mystified by how something so unpleasant in objective terms can be so desirable to you
>you're exited to be gulping it down
>that just feels right to you
>as you finally take it into your mouth drew says
>"I was a little worried the plan had ch-aaa~nged"
>without even thinking you forced yourself to take his dick as deeply as you could
>surprising yourself as much as him
>there's not even an urge to gag
>he's outright pouring his pre essentially directly into your stomach now
>you're done with the fancy stuff
>you pull back and just about slam your face into his groin
>after a few strokes
>drew starts making the same bestial noise that had you panicking a few days ago
>he was sucking his own dick, wasn't he?
>his noises become shorter and more frequent
>he's close, thanks to all the work you did ahead of time
>with one more deep stroke
>you take the whole thing as he finally releases his actual cum
>drew grips your shoulders tightly
>"fuck! my people ought to learn how to do this"
>"we've been missing out"
>"maybe you'll earn yourself another commendation"

>you tell drew he has an outstanding opportunity to be the first in line for that particular cultural exchange project
>maybe he can even be the first to publish a research paper about it
>"I'm done with all of that" "besides, there are ethical concerns that would-"
>he stops himself, realizing the subtext
>"sit down, I'll be right back"
>he rushes into the kitchen (or 'galley?')
>and returns with a small cluster of dark red berries on a stem
>"these suppress your gag reflex" "we used to use them to administer traditional medicines"
>he says just before biting them off the bunch like grapes
>drawing a fitting parallel in light of the 'bachus' part of his name
>he's probably already aware of that one
>never mind that
>why didn't he offer you those?
>not that you needed them
>you didn't know that until after he was already as far down your throat as he could go
>you would have been grateful for the option
>"there's so much dick sucking in human history that I figured you guys had your own methods"
>it's called 'practice,' drew
>and up until now you had none
>"alright" "I guess I have an unfair advantage"
>"you should be able to make up for it"
>"that is" "if you let yourself be as aggressive as you want"
>"I can't puke right now even if I HAD to"
>that's a little... extreme
>is he sure he wants that?
>"oh yeah, man" "it's been a fantasy of mine" "I always REALLY LIKED the parts of your history where that happened a lot"
>what?
>"pretty much the whole time" "at least until some of your people decided they didn't like it any more"
>"it reached a near artform in a few of the micro-states of Hellas"
>"particularly in Lacedaemon" "It's strange but fitting that such a brutal people took such care in an act of mock brutality"
>he means "greece" and probably "sparta"
>you're not 100% sure about the second one
>mostly because your image of sparta doesn't have room for 'mock' brutality
>but he's the one who's seen real video

>the space-couch is apparently highly adjustable
>drew lowers one of the arm rests to leave a ledge for his head to hang over
>maybe that's a standard feature meant for body types you haven't seen much of
>or drew has been planning this since he bought the ship
>either way
>he's pretty serious about the whole
>'Laconic throat-swabbing' fantasy
>recalling that adjective form convinces you
>yep, he was talking about sparta
>do you dare set up the obvious joke?
>from the understanding that it's a movie quote, that's a little awkward
>to him though, it's probably hot as fuck roleplay
>you'll make that decision depending on how well you meet drew's expectations
>you're not sure you can go as hard as he wants you to
>that won't stop you from trying
>he's on his back
>his head's over the edge of the couch
>he opens his mouth wide with an exaggeratedly lewd moan
>he's ready for you to pin him to the side of this thing
>understanding that hesitation and possibly even caution are uncalled for here
>you recklessly plunge your rock hard cock straight into his mouth
>then throat
>facing absolutely no resistance
>if you thought his hands were perfect instruments of sensuality
>you were mistaken as his throat is on another level of its own
>despite the quite imposing nature of his teeth
>the sensorial contrast between the elastic materials of his inner cheeks, tongue, upper and lower throat
>provides an experience you wouldn't have been able to fathom had it been described to you
>he makes vulgar *glk gkg glk* sounds with each thrust
>inconsiderate of his comfort 
>or even your preferred pace
>you're slamming into his face as hard and fast as you can force yourself to go 
>your balls slapping against his nose with such force that it hurts you just a bit
>if doing this TO him is so hard on YOU
>you can't imagine what kind of madness he's experiencing right now
>there's your opportunity
>you manage to get some form of that out between ragged breaths
>you pause as you add
>'but this isn't madness at all'
>you're on the edge of the edge
>this is it
>with a last thrust you're concerned might hurt his jaw
>you cum down drew's throat as you shout your best impression of Gerard Butler's line
>THIS IS SPARTA
>drew has a totally hands free orgasm in response
>that's astonishingly gay
>but that means it was a !! move
>maybe your face is only red from the exertion
>and not embarrassment
>you're almost proud to see his pearlescent cum against his soaked glossy black fur
>you quickly extricate yourself to let drew breathe
>he coughs and gasps and says
>"by graaf, I didn't even know that could happen"
>"there's no way this is your first time doing that"
>it is
>"are you sure you're not, like, the selected champion of some fertility god or something?"
>not unless "dreughbacus" counts as one
>damn, that one was smooth
