Boop

Mari was sleeping late this morning.

That is weird. Out of the both of them, she's usually the first one awake, ready to take on the day.

Hmm. She was always the first one awake...handling a lot of things...

Sunny has an idea. He lets Mari sleep in this morning. She deserves it.

He leans down and gives her a small hug, before getting out of their shared bed.

He sees the small smile on her face, and Sunny briefly considers getting back in bed just to cuddle a little longer.

He shakes the urge off, he has a breakfast to prepare. 




Nothing too fancy, just enough to prepare the both of them for the day ahead. 

...Eggs, potatoes, onions, pork-

He is wrapped in a tight embrace. Oh, looks like Mari's awake.

She nuzzles the crook of his neck affectionately. He blushed hard. She never fails to get him like this...

A hand lets go of the knife he was using on the onions, reaching for one of Mari's hands and gently squeezing it.

Huh. Does she feel a bit warmer than usual?

A finger pokes at his cheek. He blinks in confusion.

Poke. Poke.

"Mari?" Sunny softly asks, confused and lightly amused.

"Mmmsunny..." She mumbles back.

Poke. "Mari." "Mmrrghg..."

Poke. "Maaari..." "Mmmhhhsnuuy..."

...Snuuy? What in the world? He can't resist. He lets out a fit of giggles.

Fully distracted from his cooking, he decides to disengage for a bit to deal with his unruly sister-


"Mari? Are you okay?" Facing her, Sunny could see that she was a bit more flushed and disheveled than usual.

"M'feeling a bit down today, Sunny..." She rests her chin atop his head, softly wrapped around him.

This won't do at all. Frowning a bit at Mari's attitude, he gently guides her to the sofa.

Laying her down, Sunny was surprised by Mari immediately pulling him down with her.

"M-Mari...I need to prepare bre-"

"Staaaay for a bit...mmm..." She nuzzles the top of his head.

Sunny's face fluctuates between a frown and a smile. On one hand, she interrupted him while he was trying to do something for her, on the other hand, he has never seen this side of Mari before, so carefree, so different from the composed big sister-

Poke. His nose this time, which crinkled.

He turned to face Mari, face expressing the great slight against him.

Mari smiles at his cute pout. 

Poke.

Sunny's lips twitch, fight back the smile. He shall not fall to his sister's odd teasing today.

A hand cups his cheek. Alas, he lost, his smile and joy, revealed.

He opens his mouth to say something-

"I love you."

-and immediately finds himself slamming into an emotional brick wall. The wall faintly tastes of peppermint.

Mari leans forward, and steals a soft kiss from him. She moves her head down, resting it atop Sunny's chest.

Mari closes her eyes, and lets the heartbeat of the love of her life lull her back into sleep.



Meanwhile, Sunny is left ever flustered. He softly combed his hand through her hair, admiring it.

Wait.

How was he going to make breakfast now?

Damnit, Mari.
