##->Vitubia<-
->*What if your general was not just a general but a nation, devoted to your oshi and their will?*<-
#
The general's first setting was the planet of Vitubia, with each general given a nation where they could showcase their thread's culture through the culture of the societies they built. Treaties were penned, WAR was waged, and enough autistic lore was archived to last a lifetime. This project is currently inactive, but %red%!~(You)~!%% can read about all that happened through the links below.

###->The Era After<-
->*Almost six hundred years ago, the world of Vitubia as its inhabitants knew it ceased to exist.*<-
#
This setting is a post-apocalyptic take on one of Vitubia's many potential futures. In this timeline, chuubanite has gone inert and left the inhabitants of Vitubia plunged into chaos. Centuries later, those who remain know nothing of the old world save for what they can glean from its ruins. Take a look at what could be as settlers attempt to conquer this strange new world.

##->Viti<-
->*AKA Vitubia 2: Electric Boogaloo*<-
#
Welcome to /vtwbg/'s first collaborative worldbuilding project that is completely divorced from the Vitubia canon. The groundwork is much the same as the previous setting but with a brand-new world to settle and explore!  With a focus on fun and interesting worldbuilding first, any drama or hangups from the old world should be left behind as we learn from the mistakes of the past to build up general-based societies once again.
