### The Boys 

(Ryukishi, Sunlight Man, Challenger)

The sun was high up in the sky as Inigo, Bobby, and Hifumi played baseball on the rooftop of Shiketsu high school. Inigo rode his dragon construct and circled the rooftop from above. Hifumi, with his metal bat in hand, was ready for Bobby’s next pitch.

“You ready? This one’s gonna be a fastball,” Bobby grinned and wound up his arm, his skin started glowing. “The Sun’s picking up!”

 Hifumi smirked and readied himself. “Bring it on, bro! I’ll hit this one out of the school!”

Bobby threw the ball with all his might, the ball created a booming sound as it rocketed forward. Hifumi swung his bat. 

**WTUUKK!!**

The ball soared through the air, threatening to fly five blocks away.

Hifumi grinned. “Woo! See that? What’d I tell ya?”

“I got it!” Inigo sped after the ball on his dragon, Gigan quickly transformed into a giant glove and Inigo caught the ball. Smoke rose from the baseball, still spinning in the glove. 

“Nice catch, man!” shouted Bobby, pumping his fist in the air.

Inigo landed on the rooftop, still holding the baseball. “Thanks, you really put some power on that one.”

Bobby grinned. “I’ve been training with my quirk, I’m getting stronger every day. Y'all should join me at the gym later.”

Hifumi chuckled as he took practice swings with his bat. “Yeah, you two will need a lot more than that if you want to be a top hero like me!”

“We all know you’re strong, but are you really getting better hanging out with Hailey all the time? I hear there’s been a lot of action.” Inigo teased Hifumi as he threw the ball back to Bobby.

Hifumi growled, a hint of blush on his cheeks. “You bet. Hailey and I make each other strong! She’s not just strong, she’s the strongest girl I know!

Bobby caught the ball. “And what about you? How’s your love life going?”

Inigo sighed. “Bro, don't remind me. I’m still single, and it sucks. There’s Hoge, but I dunno if I scared her off. She does this thing where she leaves me stickers, I dunno. “

He flapped his wings and flew upwards. “How’re you and Minnie doing? You two still a thing?”

Bobby threw a quick curve ball at Hifumi, who sent it flying towards Inigo’s cartoon-like giant construct glove.

“Of course, man. Minnie’s my ride or die. Been thinking about getting matching tattoos and everything”

“Bro, I’m kinda jealous, not gonna lie. I wish I had a girl like Minnie.”


“Yeah, you gotta stop chasin’ after every tail bro. Girls talk and you make it harder on yourself. Just pick one and stick to it.”

Hifumi nodded. “Bobby’s right. You gotta play it cool and let it happen naturally, focus on improving yourself.”

Inigo sighed. “Ugh, I know, I know. But it’s hard. I’m surrounded by all these hotties, and I can’t help but dream.”

“Speaking of hotties, ya’ll seen that girl in 3-D. Weiss something, Inigo you should go after her.”

“Yeah I’ve seen her around. Hailey doesn’t like her.”

“Why? What’d she do?”

“You know the fountain near the girl’s bathroom, one time-”

Inigo watched his two friends talking as they played. The gap between them was expanding. In his mind, he  imagined a chasm between him and the two. He was standing on one side looking at them, and he watched the gap get bigger.

He worked diligently to surpass them… But the harder he worked, the more he realized how big the difference between them was. He watched them grow further away. They were probably already kissing their girlfriends all the time. They could be on third base already, and beyond! Is Bobby and Hifumi going Plus Ultra with Hailey and Minnie!? He despaired.

No. I can’t give up.

His imagined self crouched down and started building a bridge with scraps of wood and rocks, even as everyone around him just watched. He would keep trying. So that one day, he’ll fulfill his dream of becoming Japan’s #1 Lover!

“HEY WATCH OUT!”

Inigo snapped back to reality and heard Bobby yelling. The ball was flying towards him. It was on fire! It was too late to catch it, Inigo rolled forward in mid-air with his glove, he got a hand on it but it kept flying.

It soared forward and landed hard. Hitting the windshield of a parked car. Car alarms started going off.

Inigo landed on the roof. 

“Get your head in the game, man. Are you good?” Bobby said.

“It’s not his fault! I told you, you were throwing them too low!” Hifumi yelled threateningly.

“And I told you, it’s high noon and my quirk’s on overdrive. That flimsy bat of yours just can’t take the heat!” Bobby shouted back.

“At least I don’t need sunlight to be strong! What’re you gonna do when you fight at night, put a flashlight up your ass to charge up?

“You’re one to talk, Mr. Whack-A-Mole! You were trying to hit me! What if that ball hit my beautiful face!?” Inigo growled and pointed a finger at Hifumi.

They glared at each other angrily. 

It was like a switch. They all smiled at the same time. 

“YOU WANNA GO!?” Hifumi slammed his bat against the floor and started teleporting around the roof.

“C’MON! LET’S GO BRO!” Bobby charged up his quirk, sunlight filling him as his muscles bulged fully.

“I'M IN! LET’S GO!” Inigo shifted his construct into armor around him. It was his Juggernaut armor, meant for strength, power, and crashing through walls. He felt Gigan tense up, but it knew this was just for fun.

The three friends charged at each other into a three-way slobberknocker.

As they brawled, Inigo smiled and thought about how far he’s come out of the hell hole his family put him in. He wanted to stay in this school forever. It was moments like this that he treasured.
