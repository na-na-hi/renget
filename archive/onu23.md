“Come on anon, you’re going to miss it!”

A soft inhuman voice pierces the haze of sleep and drags you out of a deep slumber, you groan and flip over to face the hole in the wall of the small hut you slept in for the night. Purple and pink sunrays splay against your eyelids, warming the skin and causing your body to unconsciously start to prepare for the day. You reach up and rub your hands across your face as you sigh, the last remnants of blissful sleep falling from your mind as you sit up and gaze at the portly monster at the foot of your bed.

“Geez Slynk, has anybody in your species ever heard of sleeping in?” You lazily complain as you flop your head back onto your pillow away from the sun for a few more precious seconds of shuteye. The sun coasting along the back of your neck kisses the skin and for a brief moment you might just get back to sleep, the rough covers of the bed doing a great job keeping in body heat... Just a few more seconds..

“What do you humans sleep in?” You hear the ruffling of pages as he takes out the notebook he’s been using to scribble notes about you and hear him furiously jot something down as his footsteps tell you he’s coming closer to your side of the bed.

“I’ve been up every morning with you guys, can’t a guy get a little more sleep? It’s good for the brain!” You object, each breath you take becoming slower than the last, the comfort and warmth that only a morning bed can provide slowly coaxing you back into a slumber…. That is – until you feel a clawed talon open your eye, causing you to become face to face with your research partner.

“How can you know what’s good for your brain? Does it tell you?” he asks quizzically, as he puts his rudimentary pencil in his mouth, brow furrowed in thought. “My brain doesn’t tell me anything!”.

You sigh and slowly push yourself up from the bed again. Rough covers scratching the skin and falling off, exposing your chest to the warm sunlight lazily flying in through the open window. You swing your legs off of the bed and touch the warm dirt floor with your feet like any other morning. The room you lived in for the past week was sparse, yet kind of comfy in a rudimentary way. Just the basics and a bed in some corner of the world you’ve never been to before.

“No…. Slynk, but sometimes you just… know.” You sideye the young Svardek standing beside you. He stood about a couple feet shorter than you and a life of studious pursuit left him a bit on the heavier side. He resembled a lizard of sorts, grey, matching up with the colors of the rest of his village, his skin still lean across his body reflective of his young age. Small horn buds appeared on the top of his head that were shaved down to reflect his status as a non-soldier, but you could’ve just look at his gut and came to the same conclusion. A thin layer of skin draped across his neck, a dull yellow and quite short, yet consistent with the biology you’ve seen so far of his species. He stood on digitigrade legs and was draped in simple brown leather and cloth garments, a skirt to cover up his bottom half and a sash stretching from shoulder to waist across his chest with pouches for storing things he would need on the go, for him all that would be is a small pad and pen that he uses for his “research”.  You haven’t known him for too long, but you’re glad that your institution picked him as your guide through this village. At first you weren’t thrilled of being assigned to check in with the Svardekian race, but Slynk made it a bit more enjoyable for you. He shared the same thirst for knowledge that you did when you first started out, the same couldn’t be said about the rest of the tribe. Intelligence wasn’t nearly as important to them as raw strength but allowing the institute to send research parties gave them the opportunity to trade for things they would need. It was also kind of cool to bring Slynk with you to the more modern world, taking him to the city was honestly kind of a blast, like taking a child to an amusement park. It was kind of heartwarming to see somebody get so excited at seeing a water fountain for the first time, and he really appreciated the little notebook and pencil you gave him.

You slowly get up from the bed before grabbing a shirt off the small desk in the corner and tossing it on.

“So, what exactly happens today? Can you remind me again?” You ask slowly, half-stifling a yawn and scratching your back.

Slynk’s eyes light up at the question. “Anon you’re going to love it, this is the day of Recarvence!”

You reach down next to your bed and grab a knapsack to hoist it on your body as you step into your sandals. “Ah yes.. The day of… Reconference..” you reach into your sack and pull out a pack of pop tarts for breakfast, you take a bite and inquire with a mouth full of pastry “What’s that again?”

You rip off a piece of pop tart and hand it to Slynk, he squeaks and quickly snatches it out of your hand, gobbling it in one bite. Ever since you learned that his favorite flavor was blueberry you bought a whole pack, like a dog eating bacon, he seems to never tire of it.

“The day of recarvence is the annual return of the Svardysts from their long and arduous journey of Slaagstyxtivan!” he excitedly relates, swallowing the last bits of the blueberry pop tart. He glances over and beams.

“Err. Yea, can you break that down a little for me?”. You step out the door of his hut and into the small village bustling with Svardeks finishing up the preparations they started yesterday.

Slynk follows closely behind you quickly flipping through the pages of his notebook.

“Ah yes! It’s a Mi-li-ta-ry par-rade!” he manages, slowly saying each word in order to get the pronunciation right

“Ahh ok, that makes more sense.” You glance over the village buzzing with exuberance and excitement. Older Svardek men were slinking blossoming vines around windows and over stalls. The yellow flowers polka dotting the villages around bright primitive paintings of tall Svardeks standing proudly and thrusting their spears out. Strong scents of traditional Svardek dishes wafted out of every huts kitchen as the women were hard at work putting together a feast for the returning heroes. Everybody had shed their usual attire of dull brown skirts and chest wrappings for more colorful and vibrant pieces. Women wore skirts woven through with flowers and beads, chests wrapped in frillier versions of the standard cloth. Men wore satchels laced with bright thread that contained anything from words from the Svardekian language, or intricate patterns that were honestly quite impressive. Their kilts were still a faded version of the females – but bright enough to match the colors worn across their chests. It seems that overnight the village fell into a bath of color and life that up to this point you haven’t seen.

“Man you guys really go all out for this thing huh?” you muse as you notice a couple of Svardeks hauling what appeared to be barrels of ale towards the community area near the center of the village next to two young female Svards laughing in and painting their faces and bellies with symbols. 

“No anon, we stay in! Today is a day of celebration and jubilation to honor the warriors and reward them for their service!” He smiles as he glances over the village hard at work in preparation, before pointing to an older Svard waving him over. “Come on, the chief wants to talk to us.”

You slowly move your way over to the throne situated at the center of the community area. The tables once grey and dusty have been cleaned and adorned with vases of exotic flowers that you’ve never seen before. A couple of Svards at the center were assembling logs and materials for a bonfire that no doubt will be roaring by nightfall. Slynk was moving quite quick for his short size and stature – the excitement reminding you of yourself on Christmas morning.

“Geez slow down Slynk, he’s not going anywhere!”. You yelp as he pulls ahead of you, causing you to jog to meet up with him in front of the Chief.

Upon greeting the chief you bow your head before looking back up at him. “Good morning Chief Lixtis.”

“Good morning Anon!” he says with a wide grin, extending his hand out for yours. He didn’t quite understand that generally people only shake hands on the very first meeting, but it was kind of cute, so you extend yours likewise. He shakes it 3 times, as always, then extends an arm out sweeping over the village in motion. “I trust you enjoy!? Yes?” The chiefs English was still rudimentary at best, not quite up to par with Slynks, but the effort he’s been putting in to learn the language warmed your heart a little bit. 

“Yes, most definitely. I’m sure this is going to be quite the experience!” You smile back at the chief who was no doubt very proud of the display the village was putting up for returning Svards.

“Yes! Very much so! You meet all strong Svardeks! Learn their stories! Write in book, yes?” He excitedly asks you, eyeing the journal you have attached to the outside of your knapsack.

Your eyes light up a little bit, it was always nice when somebody took interest in your research, even if they had a bit of vested interest in it themselves. You take the notebook off the knapsack and flap it a little bit in front of the chief. “Yes! Of course. I’ll catalog as many experiences as I can from their expedition for later reference in my thesis I’ll submit for university!” You quickly gush about your journal to the Chief as he looks at you, smiling, but completely lost. He looks over to Slynk still smiling at you.

Slynk steps up and quickly says a few words in their native tongue which causes the Chiefs eyes to radiate understanding and he responds with a curt nod. “Good, World will know of Svard!” He smiles at you before noticing something that grabs your attention, causing him to yell something in their strange language at Svards sitting down on the job, stumbling off.

“So, this should be pretty fun, huh Slynk?” You look towards the smaller lizard as he stares down at his plain kilt. “Oh! Anon, I’m not dressed! You just stay here I’m going to be right back, it’s starting soon!”

The lizard scampers off back towards the house leaving you to watch over the village as they prepare. You pull up a chair near the community area and take out your journal, sketching the scene of Svards laughing and decorating the town. You’ve never seen them so gleeful before, most of the time they’re somber and duty driven. This must be like their only holiday or something. You sketch the scene as it plays out in front of you, making note of the paintings on the buildings, Child Svards chasing each other with wooden spears, Female Svards in groups painting each other’s stomachs and giggling to one another. Each one with the same plain symbol. It looks kind of like a “Y” with two balls at the top and the bottom splitting down the middle, each tail curving away and down. It didn’t look like a symbol you recognized from their rudimentary alphabet.

Deep in thought you don’t notice Slynk running up to you in his colorful new outfit. Changing his skirt from the dull green to a pale yellow, green thread laced around the waistline and up and down the fabric. He wears a sash like the others with a phrase laced into the leather, you remember him telling you that this one was “Learning is Living” – or at least as close as you could get using their language, and sitting on top of his head, a garish purple trucker hat with green letters saying “GMAD fresh!”

You get up quickly and try to snatch it from his head before he darts away. “Slynk why would you wear that! That’s mine!” You try again but he’s surprisingly quick for his shape.

He huffs at you, “You said I could borrow it when I need too! I need to borrow it! Today is special, and about showing what you do for your tribe! I need to show them that these are my rewards for my hard work!”. He crosses his scaly arms over his chest and stares at you with a pouty look on his face.

You slap your hand against your face and drag it down. You did say he could borrow it. “Ok, fine, you can borrow it for TODAY, please don’t get it dirty, ok? It was a gift from my professor.”

The lizardman’s face lights up. “I promise!”.

You slowly make your way back over to your seat and finish sketching the symbol you keep seeing on the female’s stomachs. You pick up the journal and show it to Slynk.

“What does this mean? Why are they painting it on themselves?” Slynk squints and brings his face closer to the page before quickly backing away and blushing.

“Oh… Uh... The day of Recarvence is also kind of a…” He trails off and mulls over his words carefully, licking his teeth as he does when deep in thought. “Big day for children” he finishes slowly.

You look around at the young Svards running around and playing. You scan each one for the symbol but none of them have it. You turn back to Slynk who begins twiddling his fingers together. 

“How come none of the kids have that symbol on them?”

Slynk starts to fidget a bit faster. “Oh… Its-ts uhh. Not a day FOR children, but the day FOR MAKING children.” He pauses letting you process the information. Slynk continues with a bit more confidence as you slowly begin to understand. 

“The symbol is one of fertility for our people. They paint it on their stomach to signal to the returning warriors that they are ready to accept children from them.”

You glance over the symbol in your book as he says this information. “Oh.” You reply frankly. You quickly make a note in your journal that it’s for reproductive purposes. You look over at Slynk after you finish. “Is it only for returning warriors?”

Slynk’s smile turns into a frown. “Yes anon, only returning Warriors are allowed to breed with potential mates. It’s how we keep the Tribe strong.” He trails off looking kind of hurt. “You have a choice when you are young, you either go off to battle to get stronger, or you stay behind for safety. Either way the tribe will get stronger. If you die on the battlefield you don’t get to mate, if you stay behind, you don’t get to mate.”

You seem to have struck a nerve with him, you reach out to touch his shoulder as he looks down at the ground.

“Oh Geez, I’m sorry Slynk. I didn’t realize it.” You rub his back as his brow is still furrowed together. “I totally understand, humans are kind of the same way.”

With that he looks up at you. “Really?”

“Yeah! People like us, master scientists, brilliant explorers, genius inventors, girls don’t really care about any of that stuff! But that’s the great part about being who we are, you want to know why?” You muster up some gusto as you rally him, trying to get his mind off of the thought.

“Why?” He looks up at you in anticipation, the stupid ballcap juxtaposed against his serious face almost making you falter.

“Because we don’t need them! Knowledge is our mistress! Experimentation is our bedfellow, and Academia is the only one worthy of our time!”

He starts to chuckle a little bit at your bravado, you did your best to emulate all the great speeches you’ve seen in movies, truth be told you did a horrible job, but Slynk doesn’t have much to compare too.

“Yea, I guess you’re right…” he trails off, the frown on his face dissolving into a look of thought.

“Oh! Wait here, I need to go confirm with the Chief that we’ll have good spots for their entrance!” He scampers off towards the Chief who moved from berating the Svards to pointing and griping at other Svards trying to weave flowered vines around his throne. Royalty never sleeps you guess.
 
You heave a quick sigh of relief as he looks like he was back to his old self. You didn’t want to say anything about it, but you were honestly feeling the same pressures as Slynk. You weren’t so much interested in reproduction itself, but just… contact. You could care less about the girls, but you’ve been on a huge dry spell lately. All the guys at your university were straight, you haven’t had sex in what feels like ages, and this expedition certainly isn’t helping any in that department. If anything, sharing a room with Slynk made it almost impossible to get any sort of relief. Honestly you weren’t so much worried about the act itself, but the inevitable rash of questions you would get afterwards from the curious lizard. Peer-reviewed or not, you didn’t want your masturbatory habits recorded in ANY book. At least you can look towards going home to a warm blue screen and a silicon boyfriend, they never seem to let you down.

The sound of drums in the distant wrench you from your thoughts as the villagers look up from their tasks and start yelling with excitement. Soon the village is rife with movement and shuffling as they all move towards the front of the village. You see the chief hobble over and take his place on the throne next to his queen, He didn’t look very happy about it though – I guess there wasn’t enough time to get all the flowers off. The queen herself sat poised and regal next to her husband, wearing fine jewelry and cloth, looking expectantly at the village gates which were then splayed open to welcome the returning heroes. The village started to split down the center onto both sides, forming a long line of excited bodies buzzing and talking among themselves, Parents excitedly standing up and looking for their son to return home, young Svard women excitedly talked among themselves waiting for the males to return from battle.

“Anon! Anooon!” You hear a familiar squeaking above the ruckus of the village, as Slynk has secured a spot near the gates themselves at the front of the pack. He’s jumping up and down and waving franticly at you. You smile to yourself and make your way over to the side of the ancient oak gates as the drums get louder and louder. You take your place right next to Slynk as he stands tall and confident, chest puffed out, ready to make a good impression. Soon the weight of the situation starts to dawn on you, and you start to think about how important this must be for the village.

You poke Slynk with your elbow and lean down next to his ear. “Hey Slynk.. Uh.. Am I expected to do anything here?”

He looks over to your face, snout inches away from yours, and you jerk your head back in surprise. He shakes his head. “No. Not really. This isn’t about you. This is about them, the tribe, and the celebration.” Apparently he read the look on your face well enough because he takes a clawed hand and slaps you on the shoulder and started rubbing it awkwardly. “Don’t worry anon, all you have to do is be present and experience. Not many humans get a chance to do this, just be yourself!” With that he smiles and gives an awkward attempt at a thumbs up.

You’re not sure if it was his words or his haphazard emulation of human social cues, but either way it put your mind at ease. You stand up and look towards the horizon like the rest of the tribe peering off into the distance, waiting. It takes a second to adjust to the sunlight, but you can start to make out marching figures in the distance, painted black underneath a blazing orange sun against a clear sky. At the first sight of movement the tribe erupts in cheers and clapping. Some jump up and down, some whisper to each other trying to figure out WHO exactly they could see. Some started together in song, kind of feels like something out of a Disney movie. It was honestly really heartfelt, and you couldn’t help but take out your journal to record the scene you were witnessing. Scribbling down what you saw as the drums got closer and closer.

You must have gotten lost in recording what you see, because the next thing you notice is the drums pounding loudly right in your ears as the first of the warrior’s step through the door. You quickly look up from your journal to get your first look at the returning Svards, and you almost drop your journal in shock.

Holy shit.

Dozens of Svards come strutting through the oaken doors to the cheers and celebrations of the rest of the village. You didn’t realize that they could get this big, a stark contrast to the rest of the tribe. They were much taller than the others of their kind, scales shining bright colors of green, purple and red, slicked with sweat birthed from hours under a hot sun. Their heads adorned with long horns of varying length and position, one, two, or three, on the sides, or on the top, the one thing they had in common was that they were sharpened to the point, and  based on the wear and blood, used often. The rest of the village was dressed in celebratory clothes of bright colors, yet the warriors wore their skin as their outfit, scales shining bright, reflecting yellow rays from the sun, causing them to gleam as they marched past the onlookers through to the community area. They wore only simple modest loincloths, torsos laid bare, rippling with muscles built from training and hard-fought battles. Many bore the scars of battles won and lost across their frame, and battle they did, as the spears they dragged behind them were just as used as their bodies were. Some of them still had dried blood on them as they walked through. 

The smell hits you as well. A stark odor starts to permeate the town, the unmistakable sense of a man after a long day’s work. It was strong and permeating, but you felt yourself blush a little bit as you realize it wasn’t that bad. Similar but different from the way a human smelled, testosterone, sweat, and just the tiniest hint of… ahem. The many days of loneliness and sexual repression started nagging at your mind as you watched the progression, mind swimming in what could only be described as “sexually available”. It was exotic and your brain settled in a fog of potential and frustration as you felt your lower body start to react instinctually. You couldn’t help but start to admire the males in front of you as they walked by. Strong legs carrying muscled bodies and arms, tattered loincloths with string hugging the pronounced hips and dancing in front of your eyes as they walked. You trace your eyes along their bodies, across the Adonis belt, and before you can stop yourself you start to try to make out whatever could be hiding behind those loincloths. None of them had a pronounceable bulge, that just made you more eager to lift one aside and admire wherever the hell that smell was coming from. You try to sneak a peek underneath the fluttering cloth as they walked by you, lost in your own thoughts. Your eyes snake back up the creature’s body before you realize his head has turned towards you, and his dark red eyes are staring daggers right into yours.

Your heart skips a beat as you realize exactly what you’re doing and quickly look down. What the hell are you doing?! You’re here on research! Not here for… that! You feel your face grow beet red you realize you got caught red-handed gawking at a male not even from your own species, and you mentally kick yourself. How pent up are you!? As you chastise yourself up you feel an elbow poking at your side.

“Hey anon are you ok? Your face is all red.” Slynk takes out his notebook and pulls out his pen. “Can you describe how you’re feeling right now? I can add this to my notes.”.

Oh god, he can’t know. “Uh. Yea. Feeling good! I’m just taken aback by how..” you pause as you quickly try to think of a reason, “you guys really love this day! The first time I came here I didn’t get this warm of a welcome!”

Slynk quickly jots down in his notebook. “Yea, these guys are the closest we have to ‘SE-LEH-BRI-TEES’, when they get back its cause for a large celebration!”, annunciating each syllable carefully like he does with new words.

Yeah that much you could tell, you take out your notebook and start jotting down some notes about the procession, whether or not out of a desire for actual research, or to take your mind away from the potential for reproductive study, you can’t really tell. The final Svards came in through the back and the ancient oaken doors dragged shut behind them. The line of the muscled lizards extended all the way from the front of the doors up to the thrones of the Chieftain and Cheiftess. The crowd’s energy slowly dwindles away to complete silence as they look towards their leaders in anticipation. You look over to Slynk to ask him what’s happening before a loud shouting startles you back towards the warriors. All in unison they shout a strange chant in their native tongue, each one slamming their spears against their shields 3 times, before stabbing them into the ground and crouching down on one knee, heads down before the chieftains. 

The male chieftain stands up and looks proudly over the band of warriors. He stretches his arms out wide and proclaims something loudly, causing the warriors to respond in kind, stand up and grab their spears out of the ground. You have to admit, the level of organization and hierarchy kind of impressed you. These are not the kind of creatures you want to be up against in a fight. The raspy voice of the chieftain calls far and wide over the village, as he speaks more of their strange language. You can’t understand what he’s saying, but it’s no doubtfully full of pride and respect for the troops standing before him. While the chieftain is speaking you nudge Slynk.

“Why do you guys need an army? Everything I’ve seen so far seemed peaceful and civil.”

He turns away from the Chieftain and looks up at you. “They are the reason things are as they are here.” He extends an arm across the stoic Svard. “They fight so we do not have too. We are but one tribe of many, and strength is valued above all else. Those who do not send fighters to maintain territory will no doubt lose it.”

He looks proudly over the lizards listening patiently to their Chieftain talk.

“While they may seem to be nothing but soldiers to you, to here they are everything we are.” He sighs “Without them you wouldn’t even be here right now.”

You have to admit, when Slynk first told you about this day, that’s all you took them for. Soldiers. Dumb, cannon fodder to settle petty squabbles between tribes. The reception and admiration they get is clearly well earned and has changed your mind a little bit. Plus, the way that they offer their bodies for their villages cause, toned muscle covered in hard-fought scars.. You wonder what they feel like under your fingers…

You quickly stop yourself as blood starts to rush to your cheeks. No, stop it. Research, study, understanding, professionalism. Not THAT.

You snap out of your daze and return your attention to the chieftain as he seems to be finishing up his speech. You notice a few Svard have already turned their attention to the painted women doting along the sides, snouts twisted upwards into grins as the women flit their skirts at them. Slynk wasn’t kidding when he mentioned that part. You haven’t seen a pregnant Svardken women yet, and the youngest child you saw was at least a year old. You don’t know much about the reproductive habits of the species, but you’re slowly starting to get a better understanding.

A sharp clap rings out across the village, as you hear the Chieftain bellow one last word before the Svardken warriors raise their spears and chant something back. After they finish the village bursts into cheers and laughter, before all at once they quickly rush the returning soldiers. Some Svard’s immediately leave for the girls on the sidelines, putting an arm around them. Some Svard’s move towards their parents and bow their heads. Most head straight for the beer kegs. One walks up towards the chief, bows his head, and starts speaking to him. The chief’s brow furrows for a second has he looks straight at you. The warrior turns around and stares daggers at you as well, it was the same Svard that you were gawking at, and your stomach drops as anxiety bleeds down into your legs. You gulp reactively and quickly look away, anything to try to ignore the situation you now found yourself in. Soon you notice Slynk tugging on your shirt.

“Come on anon, now the real fun begins!” You weren’t necessarily a party person but when in Rome… Plus anything to get away from being singled out, not for the best reasons. Slynk tugs you over to a Svardken couple giving out “Tredsties”, and hands you one. It looked like a small biscuit with a flower pressed into the dough, not necessarily the most appetizing. The drinks they were handing out looked much more interesting though. You take a sip, realizing that it’s a bit stronger than what you’re used to, but given the occasion, you could probably have a few…

One turns to two, two turns to four and four turns into a number you can’t remember too well. Soon minutes turn into hours as you find yourself sitting next to Slynk in front of a roaring bonfire, listening to Svardekian warriors tell tall tales of beasts and battles they’ve seen over their time. Slynk was translating as best he can, and some of the things they’ve seen seemed too good to be true. The warriors spoke in exaggerated tones and bravado, winking towards some of the girls, while playing it up for the kids who sat transfixed on the heroic tales of mythical creatures or legendary battles. There were a lot less of them around the bonfire now that the night has started to poke its head over the horizon. Many of the older Svards heading inside to spend time with their children returning home from battle, others slinking off with the females into huts or off into the jungle. You turn at look at Slynk.

“This really was a once in a lifetime experience, I’m really glad I was around to see this.” The fire crackles softly in front of you, the once roaring blaze now calming down to a much softer ember reflecting the impending ending of the ceremony. Slynk looks down and smiles, the stupid GMAD cap on his head a bit more disheveled as he also had a few too many drinks.

“I’m glad you enjoyed it anon, we look forward to it every year.” He looks down at his feet in the dirt, a little disheartened that it was almost over. You reach over and give him a slap on the back.

“I’ll have to return the favor one day, Humans have parties like these almost all the time, I’ll need to take you to one.” He quickly looks up to you and smiles a bit. “Yeah, I’d love to see one! Think of all the things I could learn!”

He jumps up and rubs his hands on his hips. Even while partying it was kind of cute that his main priority was learning. You slowly stand up to join him.

“I guess we should probably go get some rest, huh? I gotta head out tomorrow back to the university.” You stretch your back, seating wasn’t the most comfortable, hearing all the stories made you kind of forget that.
Slynk yawns. “Yea, I’m beat! Let’s go back-“

A deep gruff voice interrupts him in his tracks as you both notice a presence behind you.

“Human..” You both quickly turn around to notice the warrior from earlier pointing you out to the chief now towering over you. Piercing red eyes staring directly at you into you. For somebody so imposing and large, the beast snuck up on you two without making a sound. Now that you stood closer you really got to see just how strong these creatures actually could be. A far cry from a stereotypical bodybuilder, this body was built for performance, not for show.

Slynk yelps and says something in his native tongue to the warrior, looking down at the ground and fidgeting his fingers together. The tall beast looks down at Slynk before replying back, and Slynk holds is breath before looking back up at you.

“He wants to talk to you…. Alone.” He gulps and starts to walk away back towards the house. You reach out and grab his shoulder.

“Wait what!” You feel your heart start to beat faster in your chest. “Why?! No, stay here with me, I need you to translate!” The warrior stands patiently there as you chase after Slynk. Slynk waves his hands in the air. “Sorry anon, this day is for warriors and I can’t really contradict his wishes, besides, he says he isn’t going to hurt you.”

Slynk melds into the darkness as he scampers off, leaving you and the beast standing in front of the dying fire. You gulp reactively, before feeling a sharp taloned hand grab your shirt and start dragging you away from the fire.

The imposing voice returns, much deeper than the chiefs and Slynks. “Come.”.

At this point you have no choice but to follow, heart racing as the male drags you away from the safety of the fire and into a small hut that you’ve never been into. Your mind races with what’s going to happen. “Is he going to kill me? Did I offend him somehow? I could try to run away…” You look around quickly for escape routes, but the village is just surrounded by jungle, and getting lost in there, at night, would probably fare poorly for you. Plus, the males muscled legs hinted that he probably could run, just a little bit faster, than you.

You silently chastised yourself. Come on! What’s the worst that can happen, he can’t kill you, you have diplomatic immunity. Right? Either way you’re stuck here, you don’t think that hum murdering an outside human would look good for him. The chief knows you, Slynk knows you, your presence in the village has been at worst tolerated and at best welcomed. There are just too many problems with him outright killing you. That still doesn’t answer the question of why he wants to talk to you… alone… in a room….

Following behind him at least let you get a better look at his imposing form. Much like the other warriors he stood about a foot taller than you and was clad in a simple loincloth. His back was just as muscled as the rest of him, and being so close, your nostrils once again get filled with that same scent that caused you to be here in the first place. The intoxication of earlier drinks flirts with the smell as you unknowingly lose any sense of dignity and soon find yourself involuntarily glancing down his slick back and his exposed butt and tail. Soon you approach the building and he pushed through the cloth, stepping inside, motioning for you to follow him.

You step into a plain room, decently lit with lanterns filled with florescent insects buzzing fruitlessly against the glass. A single chair sits in the center next to a rough bed on the left side. The room is quite small and sparse, clearly intended for short stays, but the insects lighting gives off a slight yellow glow – paired with the sound of their wings it honestly was kind of comfy, save for the large specimen in the center. He walks over to the chair and sits down, staring at you intently as you stand in front of the door and fidget with your hands.

“Uh.. What do you want?” you ask nervously, trying not to look at the creature sitting down in front of you, legs splayed open with nothing but a loincloth draped over his crotch.

The gravelly voice returns. “Strip.”

Your heart skips a beat, and you freeze up, unsure on how to process that information. “Ex-excuse me? Do you me-“, a quick snort from the male in the center quiets you, and he leans forward in the chair a bit.

“STRIP.”

Softly, but firm. You feel cold anxiety drip down your arms and legs. Does he really want for you to remove your clothes? What does he want? You feel a twitching down below. What is he going to do with you?

In order not to upset him you start about the task he wants from you. You lift up your shirt and pull it off your body, tossing it onto the floor. You undo the strings of your trousers and pull them down to your feet, kicking them off to the side. The cold air of the night seeps through the doorway of the hut, causing you to cross your arms over your chest as you look expectantly at the lizard sitting stoically in front of you.

“L-Like this?” you sheepishly squeak. Maybe he just wants to see what a human looks li-

“All.”

You stare blankly at him – as he extends a sharp, taloned finger, pointing to your briefs and points down to the floor.

Your heartbeat begins to pick up as you realize the beast wants you to be as vulnerable as possible in front of him. He doesn’t have his weapons, but he wouldn’t need them.

“oh.. Ok..” You slip one finger beneath your waistband and slowly slip out of your underwear. You quickly realized that you were kind of embarrassed as you see that fear is doing nothing for the solider downstairs, you quickly put a hand over your self- trying to preserve some ounce of modesty as you pull your underwear completely down and kick them to the side. The cold air licks your skin and you start to shiver, standing completely naked in front of the lizard.

You hear a grunt of approval as he quickly steps up from the chair and walks towards you. He towers over you as you hear his breathing pick up slightly. He slowly circles your body, walking past your left side around your back and from your right. You get a chance to look him in the eyes as he returns from your front before you notice that he’s giving you look you’ve seen before somewhere. Wolves circling a deer. A predator eying prey. A gleam in the eyes as the pupil narrows, indicating an instinctual desire to hunt.

A rough hand grabs your wrist and slowly pulls it away from hiding your loins. You whimper a little bit as he firmly pulls your arms away from your front, exposing your tool to the world and his piercing gaze. The fear and cold spring night do little to support your member as it dangles pitifully before the towering beast. To be honest there was a very small inkling of excitement to the anxiety racking your form, as scary as the situation was you can’t help but find it kind of hot. The thoughts from earlier returning to your mind as you stood naked before the imposing warrior.

He quickly crouches down to get a closer look at your flaccid cock. You gasp as you feel a sharp claw prick the tip of your member as he lifts it up, examining the underside. Privacy is clearly of no concern to the tribe as he brings his face inches away from your vulnerable shaft, and you feel his hot, warm breath shock the cold skin as he examines your testicles. You feel him laugh again as he slowly pulls his finger away from your cockhead, lightly letting it scratch along his talon before falling and nestling back into the cold air against your sack.

“Naked.” He slowly stands up again and stands inches from your body. His musk really begins to strike you as he stands uncomfortable close to you. A mixture of sex and sweat that presses a button deep within you that hasn’t been pressed in a while

“Small.” You look up at his eyes, predatory gaze instinctually causing you to focus on his pupils. A deer in headlights.

“Weak.” He gets closer to you. You swallow.

“Outsider”. His maw now stands inches from your face. 

The maw twists into a smug smile “Down”. He pulls his face away from yours and walks back to the chair in the back. He sits down again and stretches his legs out looking at your expectantly. You shift from one foot to the next awkwardly holding your hands in front of your crotch looking at the door. “What do yo-“

“DOWN!” He barks at you. Loudly and forcefully, causing you to jump and stare right at him. He takes a clawed finger and points down to the ground before you realize what he wants you to do. You slowly crouch down and get on your knees. You feel your heart in your throat as you try to figure out what he wants to do with you. You try to bow your head down before him, maybe he wants your respect? You look up at him as he laughs at your display of “fealty”, before taking out a finger and motioning you towards him. You crawl on your hands and knees slowly towards him, not too sure exactly what he wants. The domineering commands, starting to cause something to stir within you, and you begin to grow very conscience of the fact that you’re naked crawling towards the warrior you were trying to forget earlier. You start to sweat as you look up and focus immediately on the grimy loincloth you’re slowly approaching.

“Good.” The creature in front of you snarls. “Can learn.”. He slowly spreads his chiseled legs apart and takes his hand down to the loincloth. You stop right in front of his chair and look up at him with a nervous look on your face, musk and sweat overpowering your nose as your eyes meet his, irises narrowed and hungry. They quickly dart down from his snout down towards his crotch as he slowly lifts up his loincloth, revealing his genital slit to you.

You gulp as you stare at the creature’s anatomy. A thin slit is presented before you on a slight mound on the beast’s crotch. The slight smell of sweat was replaced with a much stronger smell of sex as you sit on your knees below the beast. You can’t help but gawk at the sight of him, revealing to you what you’ve been looking for since this morning. The student inside of you is yelling at you to get up and leave, but the alcohol in your veins is telling you to stay and get closer. Biology takes over mind as your lower half starts to react instinctively being exposed to the creature’s genitals, and you feel your flaccid, chilly member start to pump full of blood.

The creatures deep voice brings you out of your fascination, commanding you forward. “closer”, he commands, legs lazily spread out to each side of you, one arm ripping the loincloth from his waist and the other hanging lazily off of the chair. Obeying his commands, you scoot forward a little bit, until you feel a hand grasp the back of your head.

“Taste…” The creature purrs, pushing your head slowly into his crotch. Your heart starts to beat wildly in your chest as the weight of his words sinks into your stomach. Your mind flips through all the different interpretations of what he could mean, but you keep coming back to one and only one. Did this creature really want you too…? You gulp in anticipation. The hand on your head brings you closer and closer, but you don’t resist, and soon you find your face right on top of his crotch. Without even thinking about it, you open your mouth and let your tongue roll out, before planting your lips right on his slit.

Immediately you taste salt, remnants of his body toiling underneath a hot sun, you begin to blush beet red as your lips cover his opening, and you drag your tongue up and down the sides and entrance. Your breathing quickens as you feel the hand on your head rubbing you like a dog as you lap at the warrior’s loins. Years and years of sexual frustration and loneliness culminate in your mind as you think back to how you wanted your next encounter to be… A warm evening… A long dinner… A long kiss, followed by a warm bed, and an open embrace. You double your efforts on the creature’s lower half as you feel yourself start to pump to full mast against the cold drafty air of the hut. This isn’t what you had in mind, on your knees in the dirt, sandwiched between a sweaty lizard’s hips… You take your tongue and poke the inside of his sheath, breathing haggard against the slight mound on his hips. That’s not going to stop you though, god you needed this, you just needed to taste a male, no matter the species. You shiver a little bit with excitement as you dip your tongue beneath his outside folds and smile as his body starts to react as well, warm salty pre and fluids start to ooze out of his genital covering as you thrust your tongue deeper and deeper. 

His deep voice returns, starting with a slight groan melting into smug commandment.

“Good…. Boy…” He relents, taking his hand off the back of your head and letting you continue your work with no coaxing from him. The words from your strange lover resonated down your spine as you picked up the pace, eager to please, suckling the slit with your tongue lapping deep inside. You feel his head touch the tip of your tongue, and you moan slightly as you realize that you’re tasting his pre directly from the source. 

All logic and shame melts from your body, at this point you were in way too deep and you desperately needed to see this through to the end. Whether it was the party, the lust, or the intrigue, the academic was left at the door, the only person left remaining was a horny animal that was in heat, and a burning need to satiate it.

His member grows extremely quickly now, but there’s an interesting quality that causes you to pause for a second. Your tongue is still deep inside the creature, but you can feel a second growth beginning to scrape against your tongue. A jolt of excitement speeds down your arms and legs and into your desperately hard member as you realize that the creature before you is diphallic in biology. You pull your mouth away from the creature and start to kiss his thighs and around his twin cocks as they slowly emerge from their sheath. 

You bring a hand up and rub your fingers along the hot, smooth skin as they bounce in time with the warrior’s heartbeat. You extend your tongue and rub it along the edges of his groin, rubbing the slick manhood against your cheek as you drag yourself downward hoping to get a glimpse, and maybe even a taste of the beasts other hole before a sharp claw pricks beneath your chin dragging it back upwards towards the creatures fully erect cocks. Now that they are both standing fully erect it allows you to get a good look at them. Both began plump and joined at the bottom near the slit, before splitting and thinning out near the middle. Each one was circled with a flare that rang around the center, extending up and engorging at a tip. The head itself extended outwards about 8 inches before ending in a point, much like an arrowhead. Each one capable of emitting seed as a bead of cum sat perched on each head.

“Finish…” He didn’t even have to remind you as you dive back in eagerly to his dual organs, starting by licking the cum off of each head before savoring every inch of the length on both his members, each one with a strong taste of sex and sweat having been cooped up within his sheath for so long, but soon that essence was replaced with spittle as you bob your head along each one. You move down to the bottom of the shafts as they nestle against your face, driving your tongue across the fold where they meet at the base. You glance up at the creature staring stoically down at you working his pride. Irises widened a lot more as the creature instinctively relaxes as your tongue runs between its cocks, you feel a twinge of satisfaction knowing that the beast no longer see’s you as a threat, but rather, something useful. The last bit causing your mind to shudder in its implications, you thought you had more respect for yourself then..

A clawed hand brings you out of your thoughts and work by harshly grabbing your head and pulling it away from the bouncing organs you’ve been savoring. A string of fluid stretches lewdly from your mouth to the tip of the left organ as it sits there and pulses, another stream a precum developing at the head and rubbing down the length. You quickly wipe the sweat and spit off your face before looking up at the creature, eager to know what he wants to do next, and annoyed that he won’t just shut up and let you enjoy yourself.

“Enough.”. He quickly pushes your forehead away from him and you catch yourself, falling a little roughly on your ass, with an annoyed look on your face. The beast stands up and moves towards you, pride at full mast, and on full display. You look down at his waist again before he bends over and picks you up onto your feet. You yelp a little bit at his strength and how unexpected it was, before looking up at his face. You open your mouth about to ask him what the hell he wants when he quickly moves down and forward, locking your lips against his. You gasp before his tongue screams past your lips and into your mouth, quickly devolving into moaning against his face. All thoughts of asking him what he wants fade away as he grabs the back of your head again, pushing you forward and his tongue deeper into your throat.

He was rough in his kissing like he always was, fit for a warrior used to taking what he wants. His tongue invades every crevice of your mouth, pushing your tongue out of the way as he explores your mouth as he saw fit. It wasn’t gentle by any means, nor really romantic, but his eagerness definitely showed. It was honestly kind of hot in a way, that’s probably the booze and lust coming out, but being alone, naked, with a tall, strong, rough, Svardekian who could kill you if he wanted too, but instead was aggressively French kissing you. Taboo as hell, but the academy doesn’t have to know about this kind of extra credit.

You lean into his face a little bit before he yanks your hair down sharply, pulling your mouth away from his and causing you to yelp for second. He looks at you with your head bent backwards and smiles at you, licking his lips. 

“I like” – he relents his grip on your hair and tussles it playfully. “like leash”. He grins playfully and laughs before pulling your body close to his in an awkward embrace. You gulp in surprise as your torso presses against his. It was soft, and warm, with his abdomen being smooth and slick with sweat. You stand against him kind of in shock before bringing your arms around him and returning his gesture, running your hands up and down his back. A sharp contrast to the skin on his chest, his back being rough and scaled to the touch. You can feel each scar running along the skin, tracing your fingers along them, mapping out stories for how he got each one. His dual members press up against your stomach, painting it with his seed, as yours gets pressed down against the hardened skin of his lower thighs, the sensitive skin rubbing uncomfortably against the rough scales, but you soon find yourself melting into his arms. You lay your head against his chest and hear his heart beating against the skin, and a warm pleasure vibrates down your spine. This is what you’ve been missing back at university, god you didn’t want it to end. He could be gentle when he wants to be. Soon the beast takes his hands and runs them down your back, extending past your spine and down to your buttocks. The room was cold, but the beast was warm, and you press yourself closer into him. His hands greedily and roughly work at your backside, massaging and grabbing it before he slips a finger down and starts to prod at your opening. You gasp into his chest at the sharp claw teasing your entrance, and feel your cock jump reactively as his finger explores your bottom half. You bite your lip and slowly ease up, giving him full access to wherever he wanted. You hear him chuckle as he feels you inviting him inside, and he quickly gives your ass a sharp smack causing you to jump into him. He pulls his arms up towards your shoulder and quickly pushes you away from him.

“Good” he states bluntly. He steps backwards and you look up at his face, a hungry gleam in his eyes as he looks you up and down, quickly stopping.

His hand quickly darts down and painfully grabs your erection, causing you to yelp at the sudden pressure. You look up to tell him to knock it off, but he starts to laugh, throwing his head back to a deep full-bodied cackle. He looks down again.

“You like?” He squeezes your organ a little bit, extending back and forth, causing precum to dribble from your head onto his hand. You’re breathing sharpens and you feel blood rush to your face as you get used to the new stimulus before blurting out “He-hey! Not so hard!”. You look up at him sternly into his eyes, his maw twisted into a smug grin. He relents his grip, causing your cock to bounce back up, the sudden attention causing it to pulse needlingly.

“You like this?” He asks devilishly, reaching down and bouncing his duel cocks up and down while looking at you slyly.

That bastard. That smug, dumb lizard bastard. You quickly look towards the door of the hut, before turning back and looking down at his equipment, before nodding your head up and down.

“Good.” He plants his hands on your shoulder and manhandles you to the bed, before grabbing your hair again and pushing you down so that you’re bending over. You’re used to his treatment at this point, being treated like a bitch kind of causes you to simmer a little bit but the payoff... You look over at his crotch as he walks behind and gives your ass another rough slap. Fuck. It’s going to be worth it.

He ends up behind you and crouches down, you feel his hot breath spill onto your backside before he takes his hands and spreads you out.

“You want be breeder, yes?.” A finger returns to your entrance causing you to moan a little bit again. “Will scream like one?” You don’t even get a chance to respond as you feel a slick protrusion prodding at your most vulnerable area. Your hands grip the rough blanket of the bed tightly and your legs wobble a bit as his tongue slowly stretches you open as he laps your insides. You can’t contain yourself any longer as you start to moan into the bedsheets. He coats your backside with a generous amount of saliva, spittle starts to drip down and roll off onto your sack, as his tongue darts in and out of you hungrily. It was rough, long, and hot, stretching you more and more open as the creature took what it wanted. Each hand planted on each side, spreading you further and giving him more room to work as he prepared you for the finale. You slowly sink forward into the bed as he hungrily pushes forward deeper inside of you. Waves of twisted pleasure wash down your legs as the creature savors you like a piece of meat, you push your face into the rough blankets as you try to rationalize what you’re doing. This was wrong. This was so so wrong. He flicks his tongue up, and grazes your prostate, causing you to involuntarily yelp with pleasure. Soon the tongue retreats from the beast and you feel him stand up before giving your behind another smack.

“Good breeder. Tight. Feel good.” His words drip with hunger and lust as you feel another warm pressure on your loosened back end as his one hot cockhead presses against your opening. He teases the entrance, rubbing it up and down slowly as more words roll off his tongue. 

“Beg, breeder.” The words bleed into your ears and you immediately start to blush. On one hand you wanted to turn around and just leave the room, but on the other… How many people will get this chance? The alcohol in your system swims around your cock and through your brain. Your dick reflexed every time his flared member brushed up against your anus. Fuck, you needed this.

“Please….” You begin to whimper, stroking the beast’s ego. You hear him humph, clearly unsatisfied as another slap rings across the room against your backside.

“More!” He grunts, causing you to jump against the bed.

“Please!.” You moan out, defeated. The academic inside of you shakes his head in disgust as you lay on the bed, ass spread, begging for another species to rut you like an animal. Tonight wasn’t about academia though, this was a night for you.

A hot breath on your ear brings you out of your thoughts as the creature leans down into you. One cock slipped up between your cheeks, the other one pressed up against the bottom of your manhood. You feel his hot sweaty body against your back as he leans into you and opens his mouth.

“Good girl…”

With that, he leans upwards and lines up his members against your bottom, one above and one into, the flared head in line with your hole, and quickly presses it into you.

Stars paint your vision and you yelp as the fat head slips past and into your body. You involuntarily shudder as the full weight if what you’re doing hits you, and your knees become weak as the Svardekian warrior behind you grunts in approval, slowly driving his member deeper and deeper inside of you. He was surprisingly gentle for his size and demeanor, and gave you time to adjust to his length, pumping his wide head slowly, but surely, deeper inside of you.

You feel his fat head slip across your prostate and start moaning unrestrictedly as the beast claims you for himself, your manhood fully engorged and throbbing against the rough bedsheets as the creature inches deeper and deeper inside of you. You press your face into the bed and continue moaning, partly not to wake the whole village, partly because you didn’t want him to see how much you were enjoying this. You feel his other cock press upwards against your backside and between your cheeks, cockhead dribbling lizard precum all over your lower end. You feel a sick sense of pleasure realizing that it was dripping back down and lubricating his other tool currently being pressed deeper and deeper inside of you.

Inches upon inches press into your backside, and soon you feel the flared ring of one of his member stress against your entrance and you gasp as it slips inside. Inch after inch of the beast slips into you as your ass readily accepts his meat inside of you. and soon you find yourself hilted against the creature. You hear him sigh, satisfied, before he slowly begins to withdraw. The ring finds purchase against your entrance and pops out, much easier this time, before only his head resides inside of you, pulling against your insides, corking all of the warriors love inside of you to swim around.

You feel his hand rub the back of your head before he grabs a fist full, pulling your face away from the bed. He slowly pulls your head back, causing you to sink a little bit into his crotch. You don’t have any words to say to the beast about the hair pulling, just moans and gasps as you bring your hand around to rub your needy erection, precum dribbling down from the tip and down your shaft providing ample lube as you arch your back upwards to enjoy this beast to the fullest.

A sharp slap on the ass and rough hand on your arm causes you to stop as he releases your head and grabs your arm currently serving yourself. He opens his mouth and barks into your ear.

“No, breeder! No finish!” He grabs the other arm and puts them together behind your back, holding the wrists together with one arm as the other returns to grab a fist-full of hair, you feel him lean in again and whimper as he slips a few inches in side of you to get close, words slithering off of his tongue and into your ear. “Me first.”

With those final words he slams back inside of you, all seven inches in a second, as your ass hits his stomach with a wet smack. Immediately you get stretched out to capacity, causing you to quickly yelp as he begins to really pound you. The yelp quickly dies off into labored breathing and moans as he fucks you deep and quickly. He pulls your head back, causing your body to arch again and push into him as he rails your backside, occasionally giving your ass a smack and he makes your insides his new home. You feel his ring and head scraping back and forth against your prostate, causing pleasure to engulf your body with each thrust. He lets go of your arms and they flop weakly to your side as you feel his sexual fluids start to drip out and down your legs. Your cock twitches quickly as you begin to realize just how much these beasts leak, all of his emissions painting your insides, new warm home for the sperm of another species.  Soon your tongue lolls out of your mouth as you submit completely to the sensations and the carnal thoughts of being rutted, and soon you feel the sensation in your pelvis start to build.

The Svardekian warrior shows no signs of slowing down, now barreling inside of you with deep long thrusts, smug comments replaced with quick breathing and grunting as he pumps more precum into your bowels, his other member sliding between your cheeks with his cadence, enjoying the feast of flesh and sex that you’ve given to him. You were getting close. In between your moans you breathily pant

“Don-don’t stop, please, I’m so close..”. Each thrust stimulates your throbbing prostate. Each time he hilts you it gives you the satisfaction you’ve been yearning for. Each drop of his essence fuels your drunken lust. This wasn’t love. God, this was far from it. This was carnal, instinctual need. You push your hips deeper into his, trying to get another inch, wanting him to feel every spasm of your orgasm against the member that gave it to you, before abruptly, he pulls out.

You feel a pressure and a wet pop as his head pops out of your bottom, and above all, you feel an emptiness engulf your lower half. He releases the back of your head suddenly and you fall forward, bracing your hands against the bed. Embarrassingly, you notice how much you’ve leaked onto the sheets, the creatures cock milking your prostate way too well for something that wasn’t built for you. You turn your head and pause, trying to word the next phrase carefully. Was there a diplomatic way to ask a creature of another species to please keep fucking you?

He interrupts your thoughts, all too familiar roughness of scale and sharpness of claw returning to your form as he pulls you backwards and turns you around to face him. You quickly look up at his face, both of your wet, slick, and eager dicks touching for a blissful second, before he pushes you onto the bed onto your back.

Your back hits the rough, now a little wet, covers, and the lizard quickly steps over you. His two members bounced in time with his heartbeat and stood poised over your own dick. You gulp and blush a little bit as you realized you were a bit jealous. Not only did he have two inches on you, he also had double the fun. He reaches down and surprises you by grabbing your cock with his hand. His callous hand pricked the sensitive skin, but he was much gentler this time, slowly and awkwardly stroking it. It wasn’t the best hand job you’ve had, but the sheer exoticness of it was enough to cause a bead of precum to form at the tip.

You lay your head back and enjoyed him toying with your dick before his smug demeanor dragged you away, and his gravelly voice filled your ears.

“Now understand.” He gives your cock a flick that causes you to whimper. “Alshikov take away here.” He lifts your legs up and spreads them out, setting your ankles on his shoulders before taking a handful of your ass. You look up at his eyes as they gaze over your form, his focus subtly hinting at the fact that he loved every second of this. The sex itself isn’t what was important. The domination was.

“and give here.” He gives your ass another smack and laughs. 

What an asshole, but the ends justify the means, whatever the hell he wants to call you, as long as it ends with him filling you back up, he was right about one thing though, you were loving this just as much as he was. He continues to chuckle as crouches down a little bit, lining up his cockhead with your ass. He presses a tip against your head, you lay your head back and close your eyes, ready to just sink back into the pleasure of being filled when a new sensation tickles your bottom half. You quickly open your eyes and look up at the beast before he slowly pushes forward with his two heads, one pops in quite easily and you start to say something, but second head starts to push against your ring and the sentence just devolves into a breathy moan.

You throw your head back into the pillow as the creature stretches you to your limit, before the second head pops inside of you.  You feel a wet spot on your navel as you begin to dribble on yourself again, and you hear the Svardekian sigh as he stands above you. The small break doesn’t last long as he starts to thrust into you at the same speed he was before. The dual anatomy inside of you squeezing its skin and fluids into every crevice of your insides and pressing up against your prostate leaves you like putty on the bed, completely limp, moaning, and submissive as a playtoy for the warrior. You weren’t going to last long.

He soon moves to full thrusts into you not hard enough to hurt, but quick enough to never give you a chance to rest. You look up and notice that he has closed his eyes, tongue rolling out of his mouth, breathing heavily and quickly as he pumps his two lengths in and out of you, you could only imagine what that felt like, the kind of pleasure and dominance you can feel with double the manpower.

You lay your head back and relax your lower half as the beast takes his pleasure from you. all smugness gone, replaced with an instinctual need to breed a warm body. Long and deep thrusts push every inch of his members inside of you and pushed you to capacity when he hilted out against you, before pulling himself back to the heads, and back inside. The two members stacked vertically on top of each other inside of you, driving one of the fat heads against your prostate over and over again. Soon every thrust stimulated your swollen prostate, and this time, he was in too deep to stop.

You reach up and put a hand on his muscled chest. “Oh god.. I’m-“ Before you even got a chance to finish you hear a loud snarl before you feel his mouth pressing into your head, tongue sloppily licking against your face and pushing through your lips into your mouth. His hips keep bucking wildly into your bottom as he roughly pushed his face into yours, pressing all of his weight down on top of you as he continued to pump both of his lengths inside of you. His smooth stomach presses down against yours, your cock rubbing slightly against his naval, his tongue pushing aggressively into your mouth, his shafts sliding effortlessly in and out, his cockheads scraping against your prostate with each hilting. You feel your orgasm building to a breaking point, and your eyes roll up into your head as you limply let him ravage you, intense pleasure exploding from your member as you weakly moan into his mouth, hot jets of pleasure spilling from your sex in time with his thrusts. He quickly withdraws from your mouth, pulling up and looking down at your throbbing manhood spilling your lust all over the both of you. Wave after wave of pleasure slowly dies down, and he stops for a second to watch your dick droll all over itself. You slowly come back to your senses and your vision returns as you look up at him, as he starts to laugh, duel members still sitting deep within you. A claw quickly comes up to your neck, and he presses down, bringing his mouth close to your ear

“Waste of seed.” He snarks into your ear. He slams himself back fully into you, eliciting another moan and small spurt as your prostate is forced to push a little more ejaculate out, to make way for the Svardekian manhood. You the familiar hot wetness of his tongue as he licks the side of your face hungrily.

“You don’t need it.”

He picks up the pace again, giving you no time to rest as he stretches you to the limit again, well-used bottom now used to his size and eagerly allowing him to bury every inch of himself within you. You feel his breath quicken against the side of your face as he humps you like an animal.

“Breeder wants mine”.

Almost on que, you hear him snarl into your ear as he pushes both of his members deep within you, and you feel a deep heat bleed throughout your backside. You groan unconsciously as the beast pumps you full of his sperm. Each time he pulses his members swell a little bit inside of you, stretching you one last time as he paints your insides with his seed, and you shiver a little bit with each shot of his cum. You feel a weight in your backside at the sheer amount he was pumping into you, and you feel a warm haze of pleasure wash over your body and mind as you realize exactly what just happened. You should feel disgusted, but instead you can’t help but feel… nice. The Svardekian warrior lies on top of you, breath heaving as you feel his members start to deflate inside of you, tied together in a warm sweaty mess.

You lie there together in the afterglow for a little bit before he grunts and stands up, pulling both of his soft members out of you with a wet pop. You feel his warm ejaculate starting to leak out of your backside and down your leg as he stands up fully away from the bed, letting your sore legs down from your head. You lift up and look at him, as he looks down at you and smiles slyly.

You see him reach his hand down and grab his retreating dicks and stepping closer to you, and you feel warm flesh against your limp member as he smears his slick, coated sex against your own, painting your loins with the leftover sperm from his cocks, even while becoming rapidly flaccid they both were still quite the size, towering over your own as they slid across your head and down your taint, coating it with his cum and causing the cold air to bite. You felt a sick sense of submission as the lizard rubbed his emissions on your flaccid dick, it’s not something you’ve seen before, and not something that really mattered, but there was a carnal tribal principle to it. Getting fucked, bred, and then having your own genitals claimed, you’d have to make a note of this later. you feel a scratching on your lower half as the beast uses his claw to scratch something lightly onto your skin, not enough to bleed, but just enough to see. You picture the symbol he traces onto your left buttock and realize it was the same symbol you saw painted on girls from the ceremony later. He gives your ass one last smack. 

“Now.. You real breeder.” He reaches up and scratches his stomach with his hand and yawns before glancing down at the mess between his legs.

“Come. clean.”

A little bit of lust wells up inside of you again as the words sunk into your mind. You hated what this beast could do to you, but at the same time, he was scratching an itch you didn’t even know you had, let alone knew felt so good. You flip over on your stomach and crawl over to the edge of the bed, face meeting again with the warrior’s crotch. The heady smell of sperm, sweat, and sex greets your nostrils as you open your mouth and take one of the Svardekian members into your mouth, eagerly licking and lapping at the cum coating the skin. You suckle at the limp head, coaxing out a few more drops of his cum before popping it out of your mouth and licking down the length and towards the slit, before moving to the second one for the same treatment. You hungrily lap at both of the members, replacing all the seed with spittle as you clean his tools as best you could. You delve your tongue into his slit one last time to lap up the cum you could reach buried deep inside, before moving to the hips and stomach of the beast, tasting every last inch of his loins as he looked down at you.

You hear him snort one last time as he runs a hand along your face.

“Good boy”. The words drip off his tongue an into your ear as your heart skips a beat. You stare blankly at him as he steps away from the bed and picks up the loincloth he tossed on the floor, not even bothering to put it back on as he steps into the frame of the door and lifts up the cloth. He quickly steps out into the darkness and you hear an all too familiar voice squeak his surprise from outside of the hut.

Color drains from your face as you quickly jump up from the bed, grabbing the rough blanket as a makeshift towel around your waist as you scramble off the bed. You quickly scamper over to the doorway and push through, peering into the darkness, and sure enough, something was bobbing quickly away into the distance. Lying in the dirt next to a bush was a familiar purple trucker hat, now dirty and crumpled next to a bush.

“Fuck!” you exclaim to yourself. How the hell were you going to explain this to him? How much did he see? Oh god he saw the ending… Could he even see anything? Would he keep his damn mouth shut?

Soon the weight of your body on your legs becomes very apparent as the reality of the strenuous activity you just partook in hits your body like a truck, and you lean against the sides of the hut to keep balance. You take deep breaths and slowly calm down as you assess the situation.

So what you…. slept… with a Svardekian warrior, what’s the big deal? You can just say it was for research! Svardekians have no knowledge of human sexuality… You think. You can just frame it as an experiment… right? You slap your hand on your face and groan. This was not going to be a fun conversation to have. You quickly glance up at the night sky. Decently late… but the night was still young. Worse comes to worse you can talk it over with him tomorrow morning, It’s really not THAT big of a deal…

Laughing in the distance pierces your ears and interrupts your thought process. You quickly look around and completely missed the three lizard warriors standing in front of one of the barracks. One had a loincloth tossed over his shoulder and was gesturing towards you and laughing. You start to turn beet red and get ready to leave before the other two bemusedly turn towards you and smile. One reaches out a clawed finger and motions you toward him, while the other lifts up his loincloth, exposing his slit. Remnants of your last lover still drip down your legs as you watch them attempt to beckon you over, and your mind snaps to the potential depraved possibility of being handed around the warrior ranks like a pleasure maiden, plus I mean… if the cat’s already out of the bag..

At the same time you probably should go talk to Slynk, you can’t guarantee that you’ll see him tomorrow morning, and you really would much rather explain the situation rather than read about later somehow, if god forbid, he writes something that takes off… Probably a little paranoid, but either way this was a conversation you really didn’t want to have. It’s hard to gauge exactly how he’s feeling about the situation, not like it really concerns him, but at the same time he kind of was supposed to be liaison between the you and the Svards.

If any anons reached the end – first of all – thanks for reading! Secondly if you want you and there’s enough interest you can vote on what route anon goes next. Both will lead to more sex, that I can assure you, and both will individually be shorter than this one. The only difference would be the type of sex had. Either way feel free to give criticism or whatever you liked or didn’t – I’m talkative and have a thick skin, always looking to improve.
