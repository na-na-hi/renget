#Weezil

\>Species: weavile
\>Nature: Rash
\>Playful, impulsive, determined, very optimistic, a bit of a prankster, selfish, but caring of those close to her
\>Moves learned: Night slash/Dark pulse; Triple axel/Ice beam/Blizzard; Quick attack/Fury swipes; Low kick/Detect
\>The "leader" of the two, when she isn't hunting any humans she's usually up to mischief, be it stealing, pranking, or putting up traps for the local pokemons
\>She's insanely powerful, but lacks experience. Her straight foward rushdown approach & single minded focus on things has given her a loss against weaker but more prepared opponents
\>Thinks all humans are overpowered &/or geniuses, even the weaker or dumber ones. Wants to fist fight with all of them, at times outright ignoring all other pokemon or threats present at the time
\>Apart from fighting, other activities she likes to do are dressing up, "help" with cooking (by tasting what they're cooking *(she likes to eat a lot)*), & collecting various trinkets: Other pokemons' lost stuff, colored or funny shaped rocks, poke, etc.

>\>Inspired by characters such as: Robbie Rotten, Dick Dastardly, Papyrus, Wile E. Coyote, Goro Majima, & others

#Morgel

\>Species: morgrem
\>Nature: Timid
\>Shy, quiet, versatile, easy-going, good-natured, somewhat cowardly at times, & a bit of a simp
\>Moves learned: Reflect/Light screen; Confide/Flatter/Fake tears; Thunder wave (with a room-wide one-time-use variant)/ Trick; False surrender/Play rough
\>Despite being loyal, he sometimes can't stand the common eccentricities of his leader & partner Weezil
\>Tends to hunch his back in public. Thanks to this he got unaturally good at being sneaky & passing by unnoticed (even when his skin is bright red & green, or stands at a height of 1.6 meters, or 5.2 feet tall)
\>Morgel dislikes "face-to-face conflict", so he usually hangs on the back, assisting Weezil with support moves & items. When she goes down, Morgel makes a run for it (rare instance where he stands to his full height) & tries to carry her away to safety
 Though he *can* fight, & *is* really powerful on his own, direct combat is usually a last ditch effort for when he gets cornered, or when someone else's life is in peril
\>He likes to plant/harvest flowers, berries, herbs & more to cook or make medicine, he also prefers to help others when he can, & genuinely enjoys the time he spends with Weezil, both in the highs, & the lows of their adventure

>\>I gues he's inspired by Courage the cowardly dog? He's pretty "original" if you can say that...
