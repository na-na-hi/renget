Some time after the Shinju-sama disappeared...
Yuuki Yuuna and Tougou Mimori were walking through Sanshuu.
 
Y: ...
 
T: Looks like the city's calmed down now. Thank goodness.
 
Y: ...!
 
T: What's wrong, Yuuna-chan? Why are you staring at me like that?.
 
Y: I was just thinking "Aah, it really is Tougou-san"...
 
T: Huh? Yuuna-chan, are you not feeling well? 
 
Y: I'm fine, totally fine. Look, I can even move around like this! Tei! Yah!
 
T: Don't lift your legs too high!
 
T: ...Okay, no bystanders located.
 
T: Tei! Yah! See, raising your legs like that is very unsafe, Yuuna-chan.
 
Y: Y-You're right. Yuuki Yuuna will take care from now on. I didn't think of that...
 
T: I know how great it feels to be able to move your body too.
 
Y: Yeah. My body is fine, and my best friend is by my side. It's amazing how happy I am just with these simple things.
 
T: You're all about that lately, Yuuna-chan.
 
Y: I'm grateful for every single day now!
 
T: I can understand that.
 
T: We haven't been absorbed by the Shinju-sama, we haven't been destroyed, and now our life is slowly returning to its usual rhythm... We have a lot to be grateful for.
 
T: But...
 
G: Sumi! Let's go to Ines today!
 
T: The things we lost were too important... That's why I treasure these precious days even more.
 
I: Ah, senpais!
 
I: Good afternoon.
 
Y: Hi, Itsuki-chan. Going shopping?
 
Y: Yeah. I'm slowly getting used to cooking for myself... So I need to expand my repertoire too.
 
I: But I didn't think we would be able to just go shopping like normal.
 
T: It looks like the Taisha had a lot of goods stashed away for emergencies.
 
I: Well then, I will be off to research what to cook for dinner.
 
T: Good luck, Itsuki-chan.
 
Y: Thanks for your hard work, Prez!
 
I: Yuuna-san... Don't call me that...
 
Y: Ahaha, sorry.
 
Y: Soon it's going to be two years since we met, Tougou-san.
 
T: Two years, huh. I thought it was much longer than that.
 
Y: They were some hectic two years, after all.
 
T: Too many things happened... But I remember them all.
 
Y: Eh? Not just the big stuff like the Mankai, but everything?
 
T: Yes, everything. I won't forget anything anymore.
 
Y: Wow. You're amazing, Tougou-san.
 
T: Go ahead and test me, Yuuna-chan.
 
Y: Let's see, what day did you catch a cold on?
 
T: First year of school, the 3rd of December. You took care of me then, didn't you?
 
Y: Whoa! That answer came too fast!
 
Y: But Tougou-san, you didn't really let me take care of you.
 
T: But what if you caught a cold because of me...
 
Y: And so while we were arguing whether I should nurse you or not, I realised I might be causing your fever to get higher, so I went home.
 
T: That's not all. You came again when I was sleeping, didn't you? That was sneaky of you.
 
Y: Well I thought if you were sleeping, I could take care of you without you worrying.
 
T: Wah! Yuuna-chan, what are you doing here?
 
Y: I-I'm not Yuuna! I'm here to take care of you now!
 
T: Yuuna-chan, I don't want you to catch my cold.
 
Y: Don't worry, idiots don't get colds! Ahaha.
 
T: You're not an idiot, Yuuna-chan!
 
Y: Wah! Don't get so worked up! Your fever!
 
Y: I-I'm sorry. I'll go home. Yuuki Yuuna, leaving now.
 
T: Yuuna-chan, I'm glad you came. But...
 
Y: Yeah, I get it. I won't try to come again.
 
T: (That's good, but it feels kind of sad to hear you won't come again.)
 
Y: (Maybe I should try to come again, after all.)
 
T: No, definitely not!
 
T: Good times...
 
Y: I'm glad you got better the next day. I was really worried.
 
T: I haven't told you before, but it's because my body listened to my demands.
 
Y: Eh? What do you mean?
 
T: At that rate you really would have caught my cold, so I steeled myself...
 
T: They say illness comes from the mind... So!
 
T: Get well, my body! I command you! Healthy healthy healthy healthy healthy...
 
T: Will get well will get well will get well will get well...
 
T: Alright, I'm cured! Got it!?
 
T: So I cured myself by using self-alpha waves.
 
Y: T-That's amazing... Now I see why you push those alpha waves so much.
 
Y: You produce them by moving your hands like bwoooo, right?
 
T: More like this... Feel the flow of energy...
 
Some people were watching those two from a car.
 
A: Looks like the two of them have fully recovered.
 
S: What a wonderful sight. This is how things are supposed to be.
 
Aki would occasionally take time out of her busy schedule to check how the girls were doing.
 
A: We're obviously still going to continue doing Yuuki-san's medical checkups...
 
S: Of course. She was a misukata, after all.
 
A: You are exceedingly close to a misukata as well.
 
During the chaos following the wall being broken Yuuna, who forcibly activated Mankai, had her whole body undergo Sange.
 
Eventually, she recovered like the rest of the girls. But that didn't mean that the original offerings came back.
 
The offerings are sacrificed during Sange in exchange for allowing one to Mankai. There is no way to take them back.
 
It was just that the Shinju, nearing the end of its lifespan, gathered its remaining power and recreated the girls' bodily functions.
 
It took the girls some time to grow used to them. In that way, their rehabilitation period was, strictly speaking, just getting used to their new bodies.
 
S: It must've been hard to get used to a body made by the dying Shinju-sama... No wonder she got dizzy.
 
A: I'll say this again, but this applies to you too.
 
S: So the reason Yuuyu felt different between our first meeting at the Great Bridge and after she got better was because she turned into a misukata...
 
S: It's great that our bodily functions didn't disappear along with the Shinju-sama.
 
A: After you got used to them, you made them your own, after all.
 
Sumi's group. Yuuna's group. As the Shinju watched the Divine Era's battles against the gods' vanguard, it came to have hope for humanity, and switched the strategy from defense to offense.
 
And thus, it granted them body functions again. And next, a counterattack through Kuni-Zukuri was in the works.
 
Until the moment it came to be known that the Heavenly God was about to appear, which didn't happen even in the Christian Era.
 
A: I also had my concerns about Washio-san's... I mean, Tougou-san's body, since she was to take part in the Fire Offering Festival, but it seems that she's fine for the time being. 
 
A: Next up are Mebuki and her group...
 
S: I'll help you out. I think the Nogi name should still be influential enough.
 
A: Honestly, that would be a great help.
 
S: It's nothing, just a bit of assistance.
 
A: Assistance should normally be the extent of what children in school do. As an adult, carrying responsibility for this task is my duty...
 
S: Sensei, you're heated up~
 
A: You seem to be happy, Nogi-san.
 
S: Humans will live as humans should. I think it's a great thing to happen.
 
S: But there are a lot of kids in elementary and middle school who really have it together, so I've got to do my best too.
 
Y: Niku bukkake udon please!
 
T: Soy sauce udon with grated daikon, please.
 
T: I still remember the day you came up to me, saying you were my new neighbour, Yuuna-chan.
 
Y: I'd never forget either. When we first met, my heart skipped a beat from how beautiful you are.
 
T: Yuuna-chan, there you go again with those lines...
 
T: You taught me a lot that day. About the city, and about yourself.
 
Y: I started dragging you everywhere right off the bat, didn't I?
 
T: I was a bit startled, but it was fun.
 
T: We came here on the... third day, was it?
 
Y: Yeah. To gradually expand the area we went to together.
 
T: You've been  with me every day since we've met then...
 
Y: I just wanted to hang out...
 
Y: And even though our houses were close by, I asked to sleep over. Shameful conduct, I'm sorry.
 
T: Sorry for refusing so often at first.
 
T: If we slept together, you'd see a lot of things, like me not being able to move freely... And I didn't want that.
 
T: I was afraid of you being put off by that.
 
Y: I wouldn't be!
 
T: We'd just met back then, so I didn't understand you that well.
 
T: But Yuuna-chan, you became so close to me...
 
Y: Tougou-san!?
 
T: I get teary-eyed just remembering... That's how happy your kindness made me, back then.
 
T: So I thought I should do something in return...
 
Y: And made some sweets!
 
Y: And started feeding me every day.
 
T: You said you wanted to eat them every day, so I listened.
 
Y: Indeed. What a great wife you are.
 
T: And did this wife have troubles! Her husband was about to cheat on her with a god.
 
Y: Uuh... I'm sorry.
 
T: Don't worry, I stopped that in time. I wouldn't let that happen, even with a god.
 
T: And I was the one who had to be stopped before...
 
Y: Tougou-san...
 
Y: It's starting to warm up lately.
 
T: The sea... We have a lot of memories here, too.
 
T: Swimming lessons are going to be starting soon... I have to give it my all.
 
Y: Oh, Tougou-san, you're on fire.
 
T: I have a different course, but I'm glad I can still swim.
 
Y: The school pool is good and all, but it's be great to go to the real sea.
 
T: Yeah, and there are wheelchairs for water use too.
 
Y: Let's do all sorts of things!
 
T: It turned out there were plenty of things that could be done even in a wheelchair. You really looked into that. 
 
Y: It's because I wanted to do all sorts of things together.
 
T: I remember thinking "I'd love to play tag here with Yuuna-chan once my legs get better".
 
Y: Want to do it now?
 
T: Sounds good. I'm it, then.
 
Y: Time to run!
 
T: Hold it!
 
Y: S-She's fast!
 
T: Got you!
 
Y: Not so fast!
 
T: She dodged, deftly and gracefully!?
 
Y: Hehehe, try and catch me!
 
T: Alright, now hold it there!
 
Y: She's even faster!
 
T: There! Caught you!
 
Y: A-Amazing...
 
K: What are those two doing...
 
K: But it's nice and peaceful, I guess... And Yuuna's smiling so much.
 
K: I'm glad. Although...
 
K: Having that fight at the coast with Yuuna was thoughtless of me. I just wanted to help my friend and got too heated up...
 
K: I guess that's what they call wasted effort.
 
K: I should've put myself in Yuuna's place...
 
K: Miyoshi Karin, you still lack discipline! To prepare for any emergencies, today's training day again!
 
Y: Phew. We fooled around at the beach too much.
 
T: That was some good exercise.
 
F: How are the two of you doing? Aloha~!
 
Y: Aloha!
 
T: Good afternoon, Fuu-senpai.
 
F: Tougou. Humanity is going to be expanding outside Shikoku now. It's time for you to become more internationalised and get used to western words. Come on, say "aloha".
 
T: I'm already fairly used to them. I say words like PC a lot, after all.
 
Y: What were you doing here, Fuu-senpai?
 
F: I longed for this clubroom, you see.
 
T: High school hasn't even started and you're already homesick?
 
F: The nostalgic me... Tougou, you can take photos of this sight if you wish.
 
T: One picture for the record then.
 
F: But once I sat down, I began researching, or rather, pursuing the topic of how a good woman should sit on a chair.
 
Y: That sounds very much like you.
 
F: Indeed. I must always improve my girl power.
 
F: But she who gets too close to the truth is bound to hear a voice one day, asking "Do you want power!?". But I'll tell them I can do just fine on my own.
 
T: Senpai, here's some tea.
 
F: Ooh. What nonchalant thoughtfulness. Well done...
 
F: Not that there was any point in saying that, you could do all this from the start, Tougou.
 
Y: You started fiddling with the PC from the first day, didn't you?
 
F: Yeah, I had no idea you were so good with a PC.
 
F: Thanks to that, our club could just crunch away at any requests that came our way.
 
T: You were such a great club president, so I could show what I was capable of.
 
F: And with Itsuki, Karin and Nogi we have double the number of members we had at the start.
 
T: I think a lot of that is thanks to your virtues, senpai.
 
F: Was I really that good of a club president?
 
Y: Yeah! Of course!
 
T: You were the best!
 
F: ...Don't praise me so much, or I'm gonna cry.
 
T: Leave the Hero Club from now on to Itsuki-chan and us.
 
F: Sure thing. I've said this before, but I'm still going to　keep hanging out around here even as a high schooler.
 
T: I think you'll be busy with your new friends at high school.
 
F: You're right, Tougou. Maybe I'll even find a lover.
 
T: I don't think I said anything about a lover...
 
F: But don't worry. This and that are different things.
 
Y: You'd probably look wonderful in a high school uniform too, Fuu-senpai.
 
F: Hmph, you're not wrong.
 
F: Sheesh, I wish the boys would leave me alone for just a while.
 
Y: Ooh, you're glowing with mature appeal!
 
T: Oh, by the way. We saw Itsuki-chan in the city.
 
Y: She was full of spirit about her cooking.
 
F: Oh, I just have to watch over that! I bid you two adieu for now!
 
T: She rushed out at a massive speed.
 
Y: She must be worried about Itsuki-chan. She really is such a kind senpai.
 
T: I'm glad that Fuu-senpai was our club president.
 
Y: Yeah! She's the best senpai! I'm glad I was able to tell her that.
 
T: And speaking of things that I was glad about...
 
T: I'm glad that you called out to me when I moved here, Yuuna-chan.
 
Y: No, if anything I should be the one saying that!
 
Y: After we became friends, my life became a lot more fun.
 
Y: You know, Tougou-san, I love you, even more than you think.
 
T: Yuuna-chan...
 
T: I love you too, Yuuna-chan, even more than you think.
 
Y: Tougou-san...
 
Y: Be with me forever, Tougou-san.
 
T: Of course, Yuuna-chan.
