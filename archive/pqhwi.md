->Chapter 5: New Moon<-

The house felt quiet and empty without the giant, muscular werewolf known as Rory. At this time of the day, Rory would already be up and making his infamous triple everything sandwich. But not this time. Anon, who was awake but still lying in bed wishing he was asleep so he wouldn't have to face his "Rory-less" house, then heard footsteps nearby, then the doorbell rang.
(Fuuuuuuuck!) Anon thought, he really felt like shit and wished to stay in bed, but then there was loud knocking and he slugged out of bed. As Anon opened the door, the brightness of the morning sun blinded him and then he saw two figures standing in front of him and the one closest to him spoke with a familiar voice.

"Morning Anon." it said and Anon recognized it, it was Nancie. His vision cleared and he could see them. Nancie and the young officer Erik were on his porch.
"Nancie? What is it?" Anon said wearily, he wished he didn't have to speak either.
"Sorry to come so early Anon. We just wanna ask you some questions." Nancie said, Anon suddenly had a foreboding in his stomach. "We got a phone call last night about shouting and 'howling' nearby the Gladys park and then we had an eyewitness saying they saw two figures running down this street. They couldn't see what they looked liked, but one them was average size, while the other they described as 'hulking'." Anon could feel his claws shaking. To think they could've nearly been caught that night, Anon tried his best to stay calm as Nancie spoke again, "Did you happen to hear anything? Or see anything at all last night? Anything will help." Anon finally pulled himself together and responded.
"No. No I didn't. I was asleep all night. Sorry." Anon said hoping that was believable.
"Alright then." said Nancie and then the radio inside the police car was going off. "Can you check that Erik?" As the officer went off, Nancie asked, "So.. how've you been Anon? If I'm being honest, you look terrible." Anon took that as an insult to his new wolf look.
"Hey, this is how I'm supposed to look!"
"No! I'm sorry. I meant you look.. exhausted. Is everything okay? Is it anything to do with being a werewolf?"
"Wha? N-no. Everything's fine." somehow saying that made Anon feel worse, "Just.. haven't been sleeping well is all." Anon wished they would just fucking leave already.

After finally leaving Anon, he realized he was all alone again in his empty house and when the feeling of loneliness got too much, Anon decided to just go back to bed and let the day end.

Day three of the cycle was just a blur as far as Anon could remember and day four was just eating cereal, staying in bed, and tons of fapping of Rory. God, it's a wonder how they both haven't had sex despite getting along so well. I should've take the chance, Anon thought. But now that he's gone, Anon realized there may never be a chance of finding another perfect werewolf like Rory.

That night Anon played video games the whole time. He wanted to play Skyrim but as the game booted up and he got to the character selection tab, he noticed Rory's save and quickly lost interest. Nevermind, Anon thought. Anything that reminded Anon of Rory made him miss him much more. It also doesn't help that they didn't plan to contact each other when they could, it would be too risky. Knowing Rory is out there somewhere and that he's safe, was enough for him. Well, as far as Anon could know.

Being up all night, Anon had an excuse to sleep all day. The 9th is all that Anon had to look forward to. Yeah.. my first full moon, Anon thought to himself, and then realizing he'll be alone without 'him', Anon crumpled in a deep depression and slowly fell asleep.

The fifth day wasn't entirely sad and hopeless, as Anon later woke up later that day and when he was checking for clean clothes, he noticed it. Rory left one of his gigantic white t-shirts! Anon felt a little worried that he forgot this, but then again, it is one of Rory's shirts. Then Anon had the idea to try it on. As quickly as he could Anon put on the giant shirt and lo and behold, it hanged like fucking drapes. But who cares! This was honestly the happiest Anon had been since Rory left and there was something else Anon noticed. The shirt... hasn't been washed.

Anon quickly grew hard. Time to fap! Anon wasn't really much into musk, but when it was Rory's musk, it was completely different. There was just something about how he smelled. It was an enveloping, dominating musk of a beast. With Anon's wolf nose he could smell more than before. But what he mostly smelled was sweat. **His** sweat. The same sweat upon those boulder biceps. His gargantuan back. His heavy pecs. Imagine worshipping every inch of him!
"Fuck!", Anon suddenly came to the images of a sweaty, dominant Rory in mere minutes.

Feeling drowsy, Anon decided to sleep again. But this time sleeping didn't feel fucking horrible. In fact sleeping never felt so warm and comfy. It was so good that Anon feel asleep on the floor of his room, thankfully it's carpet.

If I can't have Rory, then I at least have the next best thing. His scent.
***

Day six was arguably the best Anon has been all week thanks to Rory's humongous shirt. Anon wore it the whole time, it's like a charm. It made Anon feel safe as if Rory was around, and that was enough to make him happy. Anon even regained his beastly appetite and was also fine with leaving the house and walk to the seven-eleven. Though wearing a 4xtra large shirt in public would be very strange, so Anon wore it underneath his own clothes.

The weather couldn't be better. There were many small white clouds in the sky and there was a light breeze. It wasn't too hot or too warm. It was perfect. And tomorrow will be even better. Anon knew Rory won't be there to show him how to be control himself as a wolf but. 

Anon had the idea to bring the shirt with him, perhaps it could help him stay focused and calm enough so he could learn everything he can, and with his scent it would be like he was right beside him.

The day was ending and Anon knew there was much to prepare for tomorrow. He planned to rise up early so he could could go deep into the woods. But there was one tiny, important detail Rory forgot to mention to Anon, and that was **when** he would transform. Shit, Anon thought. That was important to know, that way he could undress before transforming so he won't rip his own clothes. But Anon decided that that was future Anon's problem and he'll think of something when it would be time.

There was something else Anon could feel besides the power of the moon, and that he was very horny. Is this a werewolf thing? Anon thought, he honestly felt hot and sweaty now that he realized it. That could explain why Anon fapped so much (more so than usual) this week. So he decided on one last fap before sleeping. He imagined himself transforming into a wolf and how good it would feel. It was all so very exciting and hot since it literally isn't  to far now.

Just a few more hours! Anon thought to himself and he quickly fell asleep.
...
...
...
Anon crept up from bed, he checked his phone and it read, '6:46'. That's more than enough time, Anon felt relieved he was able to get up this early, more than enough to eat and go far into the woods. Anon got up from bed and the deep orange of the sun touched everything it could, which was a little odd for the color was more like...
"**FUCK**", Anon exclaimed and he checked back on his phone and saw the P.M. that he missed. It was 6:46 in the afternoon, Anon had overslept!!

Anon was panicking and fumbled to get dressed and leave the house as soon as possible. How the fuck did I oversleep? Anon thought hopelessly, he honestly can't tell how much time there is before he transforms. Getting everything he needed Anon bolted out the front door and into the neighborhood and realizing he forgot to lock it decided, Fuck it. Time was of the essence and even if Anon ran as fast he could he might not even reach the urban houses at the very end of the city. Forget using a car at this time with everyone getting off work and not to mention it's Friday, there'd be traffic absolutely everywhere.

Anon made so many close calls at intersections that he nearly decided to jump to the other side, but he didn't want to attract attention. If anyone saw him jumping all around they would know what he was and the last thing he wanted was people reporting about a stressed werewolf. It was already 7:30, the sun was low below the buildings and Anon was halted at another intersection but surprisingly there was way less cars, that means he's getting close to the outskirts he can smell the trees.

Feeling a little better Anon tried to relax and as he continued to sniff the woods he noticed something was off. Like something familiar was gone. Anon reached for his chest, his heart on the edge of a blade and felt only one shirt, and nothing underneath.

"(I forgot Rory's shirt...)" Anon thought as his whole being was slowly trying to process it. He was in a daze and until a few cars passed by "(**SHIIIIIIT!** I must've forgotten it while I was panicking! *God damn it!* It was right there on the bed I remember, but there's no fucking way I can get it at this time! There's literally no time! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!), Anon felt like he was lost, he couldn't move and what's worse is that he felt he had failed Rory's promise. Their promise.

Anon quickly fell back into depression, like a rock falling into a puddle everything around him felt cold, strange and hostile. The white walking figure showed up on the other side and Anon forced himself to move. Anon had to face the facts. The shirt may be gone but he's very close to the woods he can almost see it, it was just a few more streets over! If he can just reach it maybe he'll be fine and he would be safe from the city, or at least, they would be safe from him.

Anon was on the other side walking along a huge brick building and as he noticed how dark it's gotten. He saw a few stars shining and just behind him. The white solitary disk in the heavens had revealed itself and forced its light upon Anon, and he felt it at once.
*BABUMP*
Anon felt his whole body pulsate so hard and immensely that he staggered where he stood, one claw to his chest and the other leaning on to the building leaving claw marks. Anon felt hot all over, it was all so much that he fell to his knees. Shit! I didn't think it'd be this fucking intense! Anon thought feeling excited, this was it! Then he felt it. Everything was changing.

Anon saw his fingers getting longer, his nails a fright, and the fur growing all over, not to mention the size of his paws were growing as well. He could feel hair growing everywhere, thicker and thicker until it was like fur. He felt his shirt getting tighter and tighter, his chest, his back! He was growing wider and wider! *RIP* 

It may be intense as hell, but Anon was honestly rock hard the entire time.

Anon's mane was growing alongside his face which was halfway into a wolfs. His ears became sharp and fur popped up, he could feel his entire face twisting and growing. Anon felt his fangs grow twice as large, his muzzle extending and his fur enveloping. Anon grew powerful legs and paws that destroyed his pants and shoes. His dick was also changing and growing to a full, thick, powerful knot that was leaking, and then it all started slowing. It was done.

Over the beastly huffing and his diamond hard cock, Anon felt big, powerful, amazing! But then his breath became quick and he mind started going very fast all of a sudden. Anon couldn't explain it, it was like he was being split, he started moving without meaning to! It felt like he was drawn to something, wanted it, needed it. But what? He tried to stop himself but it was like there was some force constantly pushing. All this started making Anon panic and he quickly was like his old depressed self.

"(wHaT? WhAt iS?! Am-aM i gOiNg WILD?!) Anon tried not to move so he could get a hold of himself. But Anon couldn't help but feel like he's losing it which only frightened him more! (fUCk! PlEasE! SoMeoNe! anYoNE!) Anon's hyper wolf instincts and his depressed, panicky human self were intermingling into some scrambled mess until in the back of his mind he saw him. (rOrY! RORY!) and then in that moment Anon's mind went blank, his eyes dilated and he became wild. Sort of.

*Whine. Whiiiine!*

Wolf Anon had become a sad, wild, supernatural beast who whined and bumped into everything. He had only one instinct to follow, and that was to find *him*. His Rory.

Wolf Anon started jumping onto cars and buildings, scanning the view and landing hard enough to tear the ground. It didn't take long for a couple who saw distressed Anon lifting and bumbling into cars all around the street. They left fast and then hurried to call the police about a werewolf acting very odd.

Word got to the station and the code for a possible 'hostile' werewolf were being radioed to all cops cars, and a certain blonde officer came to be filled in.
"Erik what is it?" asked Nancie to the young officer.
"We got a call about a werewolf acting strange on 16th street.", Nancie suddenly had a foreboding.
"What is it doing? Has it harmed anyone?"
"No I don't think so, they didn't say. It's just acting weird." Erik said "Why?"
"I have a bad feeling. C'mon." and then they both hurried to a car and left the station.

Some cops who were nearby caught sight of wolf Anon on the same street still acting strange. Anon picked up the sounds of the other sirens coming closer, but he didn't care he only wanted to find Rory, but he might just find trouble instead. Nancie, Erik and another cop car pulled into the same area, exited their cars and behold the stumbling werewolf. As Nancie watched she had her suspicions, but as soon as she saw the color of the wolfs fur she knew without a doubt it was him.
"Nancie is it?" Erik came beside her, both of them watching the same creature lifting a car and checking underneath.

"Yes, I think so too. Everyone get your tranquilizers ready. You shoot on my orders!" Nancie shouted and as they all loaded their guns wolf Anon perked up suddenly, making the officers look up paused mid-loading. It was like he knew what they were doing and he just stood there watching. Watching with those glowing eyes.

Everyone had their guns aimed and ready for Anon who was still standing there surveying them. What was up with Anon? Nancie thought. She was glad Anon seemed only wild and not savage, then that would've called for deadly force. Then wolf Anon slowly started to walk on all fours towards them. Nancie really hoped it wouldn't have to come to this but if Anon came too close she would have to give the order, no matter how timid and curious he seemed.

The cops were on edge, one kick from those powerful legs and Anon could tear them all to ribbons in a second. Closer and closer he got and Nancie had her finger pressing on the trigger, she was about to shout the order until they all heard footsteps. Something was coming behind Anon, the cops all looked while focusing on Anon. Then a person, a man, a very, very big man came into the light under a streetlamp and then he roared.

"AANOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!" the man bellowed. Anon paused, stood up and turned upon this familiar voice and sure enough it was him. Who he was looking for. 

Rory was standing right there just a few yards away. He came back. While everyone was absolutely dumbfounded Rory spoke again.

"Anon please.." he said shaking his head. "I don't need to run away. I'm tired of running. I don't care about going to jail!"

Even with the wanted criminal in front of them, Nancie held her hand up to halt the others. Whatever Rory was doing seemed to calm Anon, so they waited to see what else would happen and Rory spoke again.

"You're all I care about Anon. You're all I need." Rory said hoping this was getting to Anon, and he howled his next set of words with all his heart. 

"I need YOU!!"

As Rory's confession echoed everywhere and the cops having no idea what the fuck is going on, Anon's eyes dilated back to normal and finally snapped out of his wild self and felt a himself swelling with so much emotion. All Anon wanted in that moment was to embrace Rory. Then slowly, they both started walk towards each other. Being together was all that mattered to these wolves and with Rory's every step he transformed into a wolf. Tearing his clothes from his wide chest, his arms growing twice their size. His sleek, jet fur enveloping him and his mane exalting him. Then Anon ran for it as he couldn't wait to be in those arms again and lunged at Rory. Anon hugged Rory as much as he could and Rory reciprocated by hugging back and twirling around. Finally together again.

"Fuck! Look at you!" Rory said as he awed at wolf Anon "You look fucking incredible! I knew you'd make a great wolf!", Anon wanted to say something but when he tried he could only muster some weird muffles. He couldn't speak through his snout! "Oh yeah you're gonna need to learn how to talk with your maw now." Rory said petting Anon head. Well if Anon couldn't say anything, perhaps he could express it physically. And without hesitation Anon groped Rory's humongous pecs!

"Mmm missed these huh?" but Anon kept massaging them, they really did feel as great as they looked, and then Rory leaned and held Anon close. "Yeah. I missed you too." then Anon felt something else. Something long and hard and two of them in fact. Rory and Anon looked down, then back at each other and they both had the same idea. In a split second Rory and Anon were atop each other in hot, loving, wolf debauchery.

"H-hey, Nancie? We don't have to watch do we?" said Erik wanting to look away from the pounding wolves but couldn't.
"Unfortunately we do." she said wearily "In case they don't make a run for it. We just have to watch till morning.."

It was a long night to remember for everyone involved that night, especially for Anon and Rory. Together again. But only for a brief time; for Rory's trial.
***

Rory's trial came swiftly after his willful arrest and even as Anon tried to be at his side every moment he could get, he had very important detective work to do. Rory's done so much for me, now it's my turn to do the same, Anon thought to himself while back at the station searching and reviewing many things which will be essential for the trial.

The trial started at 3 in the afternoon and it was a hot day, making Anon sweat even more from the anxiety that was welling up inside as he waited inside the courtroom. Waiting for Rory to come through those doors. He was confident about the evidence he found, but the judge was.. 'Okay-ish' in Anon's words to Rory as he was being transported to court earlier that day.

The doors opened and Rory came through wearing a yellow jumpsuit which didn't leave much to the imagination since it was pretty tight, and he also had a big muzzle cage strapped to his face. It may be regulation but Anon couldn't help but felt disgusted at this treatment. Soon the judge came from another room and sat at his desk to which the officer next to him said
"All parties have been sworn in. You may now be seated."

After formalities Rory was quickly called to the stand and to tell his story to the judge. As he got to the part about the man confessing he assaulted his father the Judge asked
"And do you have proof of that?" he said. Anon knew the Judge was hard, but he was also fair. But unfortunately Rory didn't know about the captured footage.
"N-no. No I don't your honor" Rory said, he was getting very anxious. Anon couldn't take it and tried to step in.
"Your Honor, if I may." Anon said rising from his chair quickly. "We have evidence."
"Is that right?" asked the Judge looking back at Rory and then to Anon "Alright then. Come up."

Anon came up and had a projector before him. The video shown was the same footage of that night at the bar. Anon paused the video as soon as Dennis confessed and it stopped with a blurred image of him being thrown face first into the bar counter. If Anon remembered the autopsy report, Dennis died instantly as soon as he made contact with the counter. Savage, but oddly satisfying.

"There's more your Honor." Anon said. He really hoped all of this would prove Rory's rage and maybe lessen his sentence. "I've also connected the times at which the men left the scene of the crime and the time at their arrival at the pub. These photos were taken at three different liquor stores, all of which are between the neighboring city and ours." Anon handed the Judge with close up pictures of the three different men who were unmistakably the same ones in the footage. "Not only that; we have fingerprints from one of the shards found at the assault and it matches with one of the men. It belongs to Dennis' right hand."

"Hmm yes. That's definitely them. Good job detective. Once again you've proven your skills greatly. Solving a crime within a crime." the Judge said with a tiny smile. Anon could tell he was impressed and he almost forgot that this Judge always liked Anon's work. Rory finally relaxed, he can't express how grateful he was to Anon for bringing light about his father's assaulters. Rory couldn't love Anon more than he did at that moment.

"Oh. One more thing detective." said the Judge just as soon as Anon got up. "I nearly forgot that you're a werewolf now, and it was through Mr. Heart's-" he paused and opened a file on his desk. Then he looked closely as if he couldn't believe what he read, then cleared his throat. "Through uh.. 'sexual intercourse'." Not again, Anon thought getting even more embarrassed than last time. "But I see you've pressed no charges."

"Uh.. that's right your Honor. I don't want to press any charges." Anon said fumbling his hands. "I was planning on becoming a werewolf anyways.. and it was my idea to go in alone with Rory."

"I see. Alright, you can go. Now, your turn son." the Judge said to Rory. As soon as Rory sat down, the Judge spoke. "Now, you seem like a decent man Mr. Heart. Your rage I can understand, but.." then he leaned in close "You.. didn't eat those men did you?"

"No your honor!" Rory said a little surprised and a bit offended. "I never had so much as a drop of human blood! Human or wolf."

"Alright, I believe you." he said "There's just one thing left. I understand that you were with the detective for the past month, and all that time you've been together, you never thought about making a run for it? And then at the end you decided to turn yourself in, then left for a few days, and suddenly last night of the full moon, you came back?" He paused and the entire room was still "Can you tell the court.. what changed your mind..?"

At that moment Rory's heart was pumping fast and so was Anon's. Even though Rory already confessed his feelings to Anon, but to do it in a place like this was utterly nerve racking. Rory was staring intently on Anon.

"It was.." Rory said carefully thinking on his next words. "It was Anon, your Honor. I came back for him. We are pack mates now and... I want to be there for him. I need Anon. And he needs me." Anon bit hit his lip trying to cover his joy, grief and love on his face, but for now they'll stay inside, and he'll give them to him soon.

"Good answer son. You can go now." said the Judge. As Rory sat down the Judge said "We will have a quick Recess and then, I will deliver my verdict."

Those fifteen minutes was the most excruciating wait for both Anon and Rory. Anon waited alone in the hall, but he really badly wanted to be next to Rory the whole time who was in a contained area nobody could get into. Trying not to think about Rory getting long jail time was all Anon was doing, and being alone and hearing far away footsteps and voices didn't help either.

The recess was over. Anon was the first to go inside the courtroom and everyone else followed. Rory was second to last and the Judge was the last person to arrive. Anon and Rory really wished it wasn't this fucking tense. They both stared at the judge like a god about to deliver judgement. Anon felt like he had an iron ball in his throat, and Rory kept his claws together to stop them from shaking. The Judge cleared his throat, at last he seemed ready. This is it.

"Okay Mr. Heart. I can tell you're not a criminal, much less a savage beast. I mean, you tried to turn yourself in even after you left!" he said with a sly smile. Then he went serious again. "I will not charge you with 'Forced Lycanthropy' on account of no harm done to the detective. But.. you really did butcher those men." Anon felt the weight of the ball hit his stomach. Here it comes. "Mr. Heart, I find you guilty of homicide, and nothing more. You will serve seven years of high containment in prison."
*CLACK*

Both of them really expected worse, but this was honestly the best outcome they could've hoped for. Before the cop next to Rory made him move Anon quickly came up to them and said
"I'll escort him officer. And I also want to remove the muzzle from his face." Anon demanded the officer.

"Okay, but he's your responsibility now." he said giving Anon the keys. The keyhole made a neat click sound and the cage was finally off and was a lot heavier than Anon expected. Rory's handsome, beaming face was bare and ready for a kiss. But before they could pucker the Judge suddenly spoke.

"Y'know.. I don't know if it's a werewolf thing?" he paused "But.. you two do seem to be made for each other. Good day."

Anon and Rory slowly walked down the steps in front of the court while holding hands. It was a cloudy day but the rays of the sun were breaking through the clouds giving a spectacular sight in front of them.

"I promise to visit for every meeting. Every month, every year. I swear." Anon said to Rory

"I know you will." Rory said softly "When you transform you don't have to force yourself to be in control. It'll come naturally as you have fun and stuff. And I'll be fine in prison. I promise." they both stopped at the large police truck in front of them and Anon wanted to be there for Rory all the way to the prison.

They turned towards each other before it all. The truck,, the heavy clouds, and the cascading light above. Rory leaned his head a bit, ready for head pats! Anon reached and stroked his luscious jet hair.

"Good boy"
