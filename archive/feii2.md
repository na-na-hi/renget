"Mmmm… Anon…" 

Groaned the monster next to you. He was clearly bored, judging by the way he dragged your name with such a spiritless tone. 

You however, continued on with what you were doing: typing on your phone while you sat up against the headboard of his bed. 

The monster then rolled over towards you lazily, laying one of his huge claws over your leg and resting his head closer to you. His long black tail swayed slowly as he periodically flicked his tongue at you, more than likely checking to see if you were still typing; you were. 

"Anon… What are you even doing? It can't be that important… C'mon, talk to me." 

"Just a sec, hold on." You replied, barely shifting your eyes to meet his red ones. 

And while you didn't say it, what you were doing was very important. At least, to you it was. And you were almost done too. Just a couple more sentences and the guy you were talking to would be done. Finished. 

Finally, you were set. You smirked to yourself, almost too proud of your work. Yeah, you couldn't wait to see that dude's reaction once he read this… Once you completed the damn Captcha of course. It was one of those fading one's too. So annoying. 

And just as you finished and were about to hit send… Your phone was snatched out of your hands, and pulled into the large toothy maw of the monster, who had quickly shifted himself to be above you, planting his hands down on the bed and trapping you under him. 

"Hey!" You shouted, but your mouth was shut by his claws before you could say much else. Even with the phone in his mouth, his words were clear.

"I'm gonna eat your phone unless you talk to me." He rumbled, those red eyes of his beginning to squint at you, looking slightly angry.

"Alright, alright, just… Chill, I'll talk to you." 

"Promise?" He asked, pressing closer.

"Yeah, promise." You answered, hoping this would persuade him to give you your phone back faster. 

Instead, he just jerked his head to the side and threw it on the floor. You cringed when you heard it hit the ground. Instinctively, you wanted to check if the screen had shattered or something, but there was no way out, the monster had basically pinned you to the bed. 

He raised his head, looking down at you with those same, sharp crimson eyes as he let out a low growl. 

Now that caught you off guard; He never growled at anybody unless he didn't like them, or he was mad about something, and even then, he never did it on purpose.

But that didn't catch you quite by surprise as much as what happened next, when he buried his head into you and began to nuzzle his snout against the crook of your neck. It felt nice, his upper "mane" if you could call it that, could best be described as having… A towel-like texture? Yeah, but one made with a bit rougher wool than usual. 

"I love you." He whispered into your neck, and immediately, you could feel a wave of guilt wash over you, and felt the need to defend yourself, and apologize. 

"Look, I-" 

"And!" He said louder, interrupting you once more. "And, you're my boyfriend." He said, dragging one of his many tongues down and dragging it against your face. 

His eyes now had a seductive flair to them as they focused on you. 

"And… And I want to have sex with you."

Your eyes widened. Not at the request, but just at how directly it was said. Regardless, you had no complaints.

"Now that I have your attention, what do you think is more important: whatever you were doing on your dumb phone, or taking care of your boyfriend, who-by the way-loves you very much?" He asked, turning his head a bit to the side and flashing you a smug smile. 

"...You." You sighed, and couldn't help but smile at the way his huge black fangs shifted into a triumphant grin, like he had just won something.

"Good." He replied, rubbing his snout against your nose one last time before pulling away. 

He then proceeded to lie himself on his back, spreading his legs and revealing his thick bulbous rod, already at half mast. He lifted his hands and motioned you to come forward with his claws. "Well? It's not gonna suck itself…" 

Deciding to hold back on the snarky comment about how he probably could, all things considered, you instead pushed yourself forward to take care of your boyfriend. 

You leaned forward, goaded by the paddle-like end of his thick tail on your back, and dragged your tongue over his beasthood. Unsurprisingly, the monster immediately gasped at the contact. You smiled: despite his looks, he was very expressive when it came to sex. Most likely due to his biology, the sensitive parts of his body are very receptive to touch, much more so than other humans, or even monsters. 

You continued, now completely opening your mouth and taking in as much as you could of his inhuman length. He was big, but you knew your limits with him. 

Another gasp, and you can feel his claws beginning to gently graze your hair, pushing you ever so slowly further down to the first bulb of his cock. 

"Ahhhh… Anon… Just like that… Nice and slow…" 

Emboldened by his encouragement, you took it a step further, by rubbing your hands in circle motions at the side's of his-much softer-body, earning a shudder from him. 

"Oh! That's… ahh…" he breathed. 

You lifted yourself off of him and smirked. "Too much?" You asked, bringing your hands around his red shaft. "Maybe this'll be better…" As soon as you wrapped around him, you pressed your thumb against the tip of his shaft, the place you knew where he was most sensitive, and watched with delight as your boyfriend nearly threw back his head in ecstasy, gripping the bed with his sharp claws and threatening to tear the fabric. 

"You're so sensitive." You say, teasingly. "I bet no one would be scared of you if they knew what a softie you were in bed." 

"H-Hey… You're taking advantage here..." Your monster panted in between heavy breaths. "I'm still bigger than you… I could o-overpower you if I wanted too…" 

Your eyebrows raise. "Will you?" 

He turns his head to the side, and you can see the oh so obvious crimson shade contrasting on the pitch black of his face. "Not if you keep doing what you're doing…" 

You kept going for a bit after, enjoying the whimpers that would escape from the shadow monsters mouth, his many tongues wildly swinging from his opened maw. 

Next, you slowly moved your fingers down his cock, past the bigger, second bulb of his length, and right down to his tailhole. 

He jumped a bit when you ran your finger along the rim, but nodded at you, giving you permission to continue. Carefully, you stretched his leathery opening, watching in awe at how easily it flexed under your hands. 

"How does that feel?" You ask. 

He swallows, visibly a bit embarrassed as his eyes glanced away from you. 

"Good, keep going, please…" 

So you did, eventually taking a finger and plunging it into him. As soon as it entered him, you had to admit, you were a bit surprised at how his pucker clenched around your finger so firmly. You took it out soon after though. 

"Well if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to lube you up."

"Oh… I don't have any lube. We usually do this at your house so…" 

"Don't worry about it, I have an even better idea."

Before your monster could ask what you meant, your tongue was already all over his tailhole. He let out a loud moan, his mouth flung open again, letting you see all his wonderful, sharp, monstrous teeth. He could cause so much damage with those things, but of course he would never do such a thing. He was too much of a softie, and even if he wasn't, he probably wouldn't want to upset his boyfriend anyway. 

Done admiring him, you went back to work, licking every part of his tailhole, and slicking up his smooth pucker for what you were gonna do next. You kissed every part of him, his moans urging you to continue making sure no part when unappreciated. 

After a while of some pretty aggressive rimming on your part, you looked to see his tailhole, adequately wet and ready. You shifted yourself, ready to pull down your pants and get the action started before you were pushed back down by both of your boyfriends large claws at the back of your head.

He pushed you into the confines of his sprawled out legs, back into his tailhole. 

"C'mon, don't stop… Keep going anon, keep going…" 

It wasn't like you had a choice. 

So you did, burying your face into his thighs, and licking at his tailhole once more, this time with much more gusto than before. 

"Mmm, yeah… You humans have the best tongues..." He mewled, holding you in place with claws. "Course yours is the best, babe~" 

You continued, ravishing his tailhole every way you knew how. One claw of his even moved downward, spreading himself open even more for you. You could be here forever, and you wouldn't even mind. But, you did have to breathe eventually.

It seemed like, finally, your monster was satisfied and allowed you to pull yourself up. For a brief moment, a string of saliva connected you and the monster's black, wet tailhole to each other. 

You watched as those expressive red dots in his head became much more flirtatious. He opened his mouth and licked his teeth, smiling at you. "Well? We both know you didn't do all that work just so you could stare at me. Come over here and fuck your monster boyfriend." He said, and although you could hear his voice crack a little near the end, you chose to ignore it, happily indulging him in his attempt to be a bit more dominant. It was something rare for a total softie like him. 

You smirked. "Don't have to tell me twice." You replied, taking your pants off and throwing them across the bed before moving forward and straddling your monster's tail, carefully pointing your rock hard manhood at his slippery entrance. 

Now, you didn't always top him, it was only sometimes, but you could still never get used to just how good he felt. And how tight, considering just how fucking huge he was. 

Immediately, you were pulled into his chest, both of his arms wrapped around your back in a loving, good-feeling type of embrace that you feel warm. 

As you thrusted into him, with each moan he would let out, his eyes would close, then open back up with a look that made you feel like the most cherished person in the world. 

"Oh, by the way, I wanted to ask… How'd my t-tailhole taste?" He asked, seemingly embarrassed again judging by the flush of his face.

"Uhh… fine, I guess? Why?"

"Nothing… Just was a bit worried I went too far there. It felt really good so… I wanted you to keep doing-" 

Another moan from him as you apparently had just hit his sweet spot. 

"-it, ahhh… Keep doing it, keep going, please…" 

You listened, and honestly, who were you to deny your boyfriend anything? So you did just as he said. Pushing harder into him, watching as his huge shaft flopped against his chest, black pre oozing from the tip onto him. 

His tightness was making it hard for you to keep going, and from the looks of it, he was having a hard time enduring too. Your movements and thrusts began to slow down as you got closer to your limit, but you pressed forward even harder to compensate. 

He brought his snout up, and pressed it against your forehead. "Anon… Finish inside… I wanna feel you finish inside me, please. I love you." He whispered into your ear, pressing your body against his so hard you could've swore he was trying to merge you two together.

His low, needy voice was all you needed to finally push you over the edge. You came, blowing your hot load inside him with one final thrust. Shortly after, he came too, his black, moderately sticky seed blowing all over his chest, some of it splattering your face as well. 

There were no words between the two of you, just heavy breathing and loving glances. 

Your monster was the first to make a move, moving you both back to the other side of the bed and bringing you into his embrace: not only with his arms, but with his legs and tail as well.

His read rested on top of yours, and his smile showed only content. 

It was only then when you remembered why this happened, and you felt a bit sad again. 

"Hey…" you piped up. 

"Hmmm?" 

"About what happened with the phone… I just wanted to say I'm-"

"Oh be quiet." He said, cutting you off before you could finish your apology.

"I've already forgiven you for that, don't bring the mood down. Now, if you really want to make it up to me-even though you don't have to because I love you and you're already off the hook-you can pull the blanket up. I wanna cuddle with my cute human boyfriend."

You laughed. Of course he would say that. But there was still one more problem. "But what about the mess?" 

He rolled his red eyes at you in the most purposeful fashion. "We'll clean it up later! Anon, please? Cuddling?" 

"Fine, fine. Cuddling." 

"Thank you." He sighed, snuggling up to you even more. 

Having a monster boyfriend was pretty neat, you thought to yourself, before being lulled to sleep by the sounds of your monsters slow breathing.
