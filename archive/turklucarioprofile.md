>Personality: 
>Turquoise, or Turk for short, is a former human who was spirited away to the Pokemon World many years ago to stop a disaster at the hands of villains long forgotten to history. Unfortunately, destiny did not unfold as predicted and he failed mission. The allies, friends, family, and home he swore to protect was destroyed and he was in turn outcast and shamed by the survivors for the crime of failing an undertaking that perhaps was just too great for the champion from another world. Prior to his whisking away, he was a young and aspiring man that many saw potential in. He was what one would've called a gifted child before the weight of such expectations caused him to collapse in on himself and burn out, becoming a drug and booze addled loser who shitposted on the internet and spent his talents in less than productive ways. His journey to the Pokemon World could have perhaps at one point been a redemption arc for his failures in life a a human, but sadly things don't always turn out for the better. As a Lucario, he is not a prime example of his species as his heavily scarred and mutilated form impedes some of his capabilities to be a peak fighter and aura user. He spends much of his days wandering, getting into antics of mischief with those he can coerce into hanging out with him or befriending, and is constantly trying to prove his capabilities for better or worse.

>Actions: 
>Turk likes to get into substance fueled shenanigans as a way to put his mind off old regrets and older wounds. This may be anything from undertaking guild missions, carousing around town and pestering the locals, or wandering off to neighboring regions to see what sort nonsense he can get himself into there. This perhaps may even be finding an opportunity to prove he's still the hero he originally was destined to be.

>Skills: 
>As a Lucario, Turk is inherently gifted with the power of aura and martial arts. He's certainly not the most gifted as years of consuming strange substances has warped his senses. His missing left arm, prosthetic leg, and blindness limits him in some ways but empowers him greatly in others. His wellspring of aura is greater than most despite his compromised versatility. He has created a personalized form of aura expression where he can exhibit the effects and traits of most Pokemon moves through the forms of weapons which he can conjure from aura with his right arm. His aura senses are that of a master due to having spend over a decade honing them following his blinding. Turk wears an Expert Belt adorned with samurai-like apparel which enhances his supereffective moves. He carries hidden on his person an Awakening Emera in the rare event he really needs to draw on the power that misguided him all those years ago.

>Ability: Inner Focus
>Typical Moves: Sword Dance, Meteor Mash, Close Combat, Bullet Punch

>Goals: 
>Turk wishes one day he may be seen in a better light by the world at large despite his failings. If an opportunity to right the wrongs of his past ever comes, he'll likely pursue them even if it meant his possible death. Until that day arrives, his vices anchor him and keep him complacent to his lacking ways.
