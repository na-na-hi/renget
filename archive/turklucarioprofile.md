>Personality: 
>Turquoise, or Turk for short, is a former human who was spirited away to the Pokemon World many years ago to stop a plot at the hands of villains that wished to rule it. Unfortunately, his prophesied destiny did not unfold as predicted and he failed the mission. The allies and people he swore to protect were lost to him and he was hunted by the survivors of the villians he tried to thwart. Prior to his whisking away, he was a young and aspiring man that many saw potential in. He was what one would've politely called a gifted child before the weight of such high expectations from his family, friends, and teachers caused him to mentally collapse in on himself and burn out. He became a weed smoking and underage drinking loser who shitposted on the internet and spent his talents in less than productive ways like video games to pass the time. His journey to the Pokemon World could have perhaps at one point been a redemption arc for his failures in life a a human, but sadly things don't always turn out for the better. As a Lucario, he is not a prime example of his species as his damaged body impedes some of his capabilities to be a peak fighter and aura user. He spends much of his days wandering, getting into antics of mischief with those he can coerce into hanging out with him or befriending, and is constantly trying to prove his capabilities for better or worse.

>Actions: 
>Turk likes to partake in drugs and alcohol as a way to put his mind off old regrets and older wounds. It generally keep him calm in most situations he gets into. This may be anything from undertaking guild missions, carousing around town and pestering the locals, or wandering off to neighboring regions to explore.

>Skills: 
>As a Lucario, Turk is inherently gifted with the power of aura and martial arts. He's certainly not the most gifted as years of consuming smoking blends made of local plants and a steady diet of berry wines has hindered his mental faculties, which don't always coordinate with his powerful Pokemon abilities and finesse. His missing left arm, prosthetic leg, and blindness limits him in some way physically in which the rest of his body has been trained to pick up the slack for. His wellspring of aura is greater than most despite his compromised versatility. His ability to channel it for any longer than in short powerful bursts is strenuous at best. He has created a personalized form of aura expression where he can exhibit the effects and traits of most of the Pokemon moves he knows through the forms of weapons which he can conjure from aura with his right arm. His aura senses are possibly close to that of a master due to having spend over a decade honing them following his physical injuries., but are somewhat limited by his reliance on drugs to calm his mind enough to make the most of them. Turk wears an Expert Belt adorned with samurai-like apparel which enhances his supereffective moves. He carries hidden on his person a Looplet that was modified to draw power from the user alongisde the emera set in it. It's considered very unsafe to utilize despite its potential benefits.

>Ability: Inner Focus
>Typical Moves: Sword Dance, Meteor Mash, Close Combat, Bullet Punch

>Goals: 
>Turk truly wishes one day he may make amends for his past failings, if such a thing is even possible. Until that day arrives, his vices anchor him and keep him complacent to his lacking ways.
