There was a wide arrange of plushies and photos opposite of the bed, neatly organized. The color of the sheets was a baby blue. The curtains where white. My backpack was thrown on the floor. It was empty, but I had brought it with me. 

Noel-chan had told me to come, or that there would be trouble, that I would be turned over to the police for being a pervert and a creep. 

The room was illuminated by an orange glow. I looked to the side and saw a red blinking dot on top of a drawer.

My mom didn't know what was going on. I told her a girl was being mean to me, because I was scared of telling her the truth. She told me to man up.

Her footsteps approached me with a menacing rhythm. They drew ever nearer and yet it felt as if they would never arrive. I cherished the minutes and lived them as if they were years. I didn't want to see her. I didn't want Noel-chan to come in and yet I wanted her to so she'd be done with it.

I told my dad about it. He threatened to beat me if I was a faggot. No one takes it seriously.

My body recoiled in fear when I heard the doorknob turn, and I accepted my fate as I heard the door creak. The ceiling was white. The walls were a tone of lime. 

Noel was wearing a pink set of underwear. 

"Sit." Said Noel. "On the border of the bed."

So I complied. My ribs hurt. 

"Look up, a bit more, that's good. Now, introduce yourself."

"M-My name is Anon Ymous..." I muttered.

"With more energy."

"M-My name is Anon Ymous!" I coughed up. I hadn't the spirit to do this, and yet I could invoke it on command. I feared more what the repercussions would be.

"Good boy! Keep going."

"I'm 11 years old. I go to XX school, m-my hobbies are reading manga and playing baseball."

"Is this your first time doing a porno, Anon?"

"Y-Yes..."

"Louder."

"Yes!"

"Are you nervous?"

What was I supposed to answer? I couldn't find something in myself that wouldn't anger Noel. Staying quiet wasn't the correct option either.

"I asked you if you're nervous, Anon."

"I-I..." I cried. I couldn't hold it in. I wanted to go home, I wanted to get out, but I didn't want to get thrown into jail either. If anything, I wanted to die. I wanted the earth to open and swallow me whole. Snot ran down my nose, and I quickly brushed away my tears with my shirt in an attempt to make the river of sadness stop. Please, not now, I can't have Noel see me like this.

"Shh... shh..." She sat beside me. Soon I felt my head smothered in her bust and I bawled my eyes out on them. Noel's hands comforted me and I sought refuge in her arms. A paradox, my abuser was my savior, my savior was my abuser, but what else was there? There was no one in this room to heed my cries, or to run to. Only Noel existed, only she and I.

"I'm sorry..." I bawled. "I don't want to do this... I don't want to play this game anymore."

"It's okay... It's okay... Come on, here, here!" 

Something poked my arm, and I saw Noel stretching to me a figure of Ultraman. I hated it with all my heart. She bought it for me, to buy my silence; Nevertheless, I took the toy in my hands, but I threw it to the side the next minute. 

"Now, get into position, lay down." Noel commanded me.

I didn't want to.

"Anon, lay down, now."

But I had no choice.

I was wearing my school uniform. Noel told me to wear it. 

A bird sang outside the window, while Noel unzipped my pants. 

"Tweeet, tweet." It went. Who are you, and why are you watching me? Don't look at me, I'm dirty, I don't want to be seen. The notes the bird sang were beautiful. A world outside this room, a world that I would never belong to again. 

"Ohoho, you're already hard!" Said Noel as she jerked me off, and all I could think about was the bird and Ultraman. Why are you watching me? Why are you just sitting there?

Before I knew it Noel was blowing me, and I sat there, motionless like Ultraman.

"Does it feel good, honey?~" Noel asked. I couldn't muster a response, and again, silence was the wrong answer.

I felt how Noel's teeth closed around my dick with a gentle but menacing force, and I gasped in fear. 

"Does it feel good?"

"It feels good..."

"Mmm, Onee-san's going to make you feel even better, alright?"

Noel knelt on top of me and straddled me. My penis was sore. We had done it before, we were doing it again. It hurt. Feeling her bubbly body against mine hurt.

"Now, I'm going to take your virginity, okay Anon?~" 

That was a lie. I didn't know why she lied. But instead of pointing it out, I just nodded. I felt my penis entering her folds, and I took my cue to let out dry and forced moans -Noel didn't like it if I didn't make a sound-.

"Haa, do you like it, Anon?~"

"Yeah..."

"Do you love Onee-san?"

No.

"I love Onee-san..." I said. 

"Again...!"

"I love Onee-san..."

"Again!"

"I love you, Onee-san..."

And she rode me. And the walls were still a faded lime, and the sheets were still baby blue, and the ceiling was still white, and Ultraman was still thrown on top of the bed, but the bird sang no more. It abandoned me, it left me alone with my beloved onee-san.

We did a few more poses, I don't now.

I knocked Ultraman out of the bed. A beeping caused Noel to get up and fetch something to our side. 

And after that, she told me to go home, and that if I ever told anyone what happened... I knew. I knew it well enough.

And I did go home.

And I got hit by a bicycle, and the rider yelled at me.

Then I got home, I began banging my head against the wall.

Why me.

Why did it only happen to me?

Why do my legs tingle for that monster?

And just like that, the video ends. Years of trauma encapsulated in 4 minutes and 12 seconds, and neatly packed in 16MB.
