#Everything Wrong With the Two of Them
The hospital buzzed with frenetic energy, hushed conversations, the occasional wail of sirens, and the ceaseless shuffle of hurried footsteps. As Mio and Sandatsu stood just outside the entrance, the air was thick with the collective weight of the city's recent chaos. Emergency lights flashed in erratic patterns, casting eerie shadows on the worried faces that streamed in and out.

Mio glanced at Sandatsu, her gaze sharp enough to cut through the tension. "Well, congratulations on turning Kyoto into a war zone."

So far, it seemed like their identities were safe. They could enjoy their anonymity,  for now.

Sandatsu kept his eyes forward, his stoic expression unchanged. He tuned out Mio's chatter.

"Anyone with half a brain would have guessed we were involved in the hospital mess," Mio continued, her voice carrying an edge. "It won't be long before they put two and two together."

Sandatsu finally spoke, his tone flat. "Then we deal with it when it happens. No point worrying about it now."

Mio scoffed. "You're always so cavalier. The consequences of your actions never seem to faze you. Is that confidence or just stupidity?"

He shot her a sideways glance, a brief flicker of irritation crossing his features. "Call it whatever you want. Worrying won't change anything."

They moved through the hospital's sliding doors, navigating the sea of anxious faces. Stretchers zipped past, paramedics shouting urgent instructions.

Inside the waiting area, Mio surveyed the chaos, her disdainful gaze lingering on the wounded. "You've made quite the mess."

"Yeah, and  all while carrying some dead weight with me."

"Fuck you."

Their bickering echoed through the crowded halls until their target came within Mio's range: Hiro.

Mio wasted no time, erasing the memories of Sandatsu's failed assault. Modifying them could prove risky, since smart targets could eventually realize their memories had been tampered with. Seeing Mio's look of satisfaction, Sandatsu guessed she was done.

"So, what now?" Sandatsu inquired.

"Not even gonna thank me for fixing your mess? Asshole."

"There's still a lot of time left before the meeting." he ignored her.

She scanned the faces of the distraught, pinpointing those who had just received heartbreaking news. Mio, with an unsettling grin, gestured toward a grieving woman in the waiting area. "How about we kill some time?"

The mourning in her eyes gave way to confusion, a twisted play orchestrated by Mio's wicked whims. The woman staggered to her feet, disoriented, and approached a doctor.

"What happened to my husband? Where is he?" she demanded, desperation lacing her voice.The doctor struggled to explain to the woman that she had already been informed of her husband's passing a while ago.

"That was ruthless" Sandatsu said.

=="And extremely fun."== answered Memory Mio.

Right after they exited the hospital, she zeroed in on another grief-stricken soul, a man sitting on a bench, his hands trembling as he clutched a crumpled tissue. Confusion twisted his features as he rose, his eyes darting around the in bewilderment before he entered the hospital again. Mio leaned into Sandatsu, her voice dripping with mockery, "It's even better the second time."

The man, disoriented, approached a nurse, desperation etched across his face. "Excuse me, but my daughter, is she here? Her name is..."

Sandatsu observed the unfolding scene. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips, a realization dawning. "Strangely entertaining."

"I'm impressed a retard like you can even appreciate this." Said Mio.

After a few seconds of silence, Sandatsu's stomach growled audibly, betraying the hunger that had been gnawing at him. He sighed "I'm starving. Give me something to eat."

Mio shot him a disdainful look. "Oh, no. I hope you brought money because I sure as hell am not spending mine on feeding you."

He scowled but decided to diffuse the situation. "Fine, fine. Let's take a detour then."

The atmosphere was thick with neglect, the abandoned buildings standing as silent witnesses to the ravages of time and circumstance. Sandatsu, indifferent to Mio's complaints, led her through the narrow, decaying streets of the dilapidated part of town. 

Mio wrinkled her nose in disgust. "What kind of dump is this? Well, I guess it matches your standards well enough..."

He ignored her sarcastic comment, his gaze fixed on a group of middle schoolers in the distance. A sinister glint sparkled in his eyes, and without a word, he pulled them into a dimly lit alley. Mio, sensing trouble, followed reluctantly.

The middle schoolers, their false bravado barely concealing the nervous tremors beneath, attempted to put on a front as they faced Sandatsu. Their attempts at intimidation were feeble at best, overshadowed by the shadow of fear that danced in their eyes.

One of them, trying to muster courage, stepped forward with a poorly concealed smirk. "You think you're tough, huh? Messing with us will be the last mistake you ever make, emo fuck."

He was a mutant, almost as tall as Sandatsu. With bony spikes across his body.

Sandatsu, his stoic expression unyielding, didn't dignify their threats with a response. Instead he just grabbed the spiky guy and slammed him against his friend.

Mio, observing the unfolding chaos, couldn't help but voice her concerns. "Right, because we can totally afford to draw unwanted attention. We're going to be caught because of you."

Sandatsu, caught in the throes of his merciless assault, seemed indifferent to Mio's worries. "Heroes won't be bothering with this. Plus, I got you here to fix everything."

"Fuck off." she said, a smile starting to show across her face.

She watched as the veneer of toughness crumbled from the middle schoolers' faces, revealing the terror that lay beneath. Her laughter, a blend of nervous energy and sadistic glee, mingled with the sounds of her companion stomping on the fallen students.

One of the middle schoolers, now battered and broken, attempted to crawl away, his earlier bravado replaced by a desperate plea. "Please, just let us go! We won't say anything, we swear!"

Sandatsu, unmoved by the desperate plea, coldly interrupted with an icy calmness. "Enough of your whining. Hand over your money."

The terrified thug fumbled with his pockets, hastily producing a meager amount of cash. His trembling hands extended the crumpled bills towards Sandatsu, who snatched them with a disdainful glare. 

Mio, observing the transaction, couldn't resist a scoff. "You beat them up and now you're robbing them? Real hero material."

Sandatsu focused on counting his money.

As the middle schoolers attempted to retreat, Mio, always keen on exploiting an opportunity, pointed out with a sly smirk, "You really think these punks are going to tell you the truth about how much they have? They're holding out on you."

Sandatsu, turning around with an intense glare that sent shivers down their spines, said, "You heard her."

The middle schoolers, now thoroughly cowed by the ruthless duo, fumbled nervously in their pockets once more. With a mix of fear and resentment, they reluctantly produced additional cash, handing it over with a defeated air.

Mio, reveling in the discomfort she instigated, chimed in, "See? Always good to double-check."

Sandatsu, scrutinizing the stolen money in his hands, raised an eyebrow. "Kids like them probably have ritch parents and big allowances. Look a how much they were carrying."

"First of all. You have to be joking. That amount is nothing, you poor hobo. Second of all, these kids? They were bullies. That money they just handed over? Stolen from their classmates."

"Then look at me. Fighting evil bullies. I really am hero material."

"Whatever."

The neon glow of the family restaurant's sign welcomed Mio and Sandatsu into its comforting embrace. 

The hostess led them to a cozy booth near the window, where the soft hum of conversation created a pleasant backdrop. Mio, her usual scowl softened by the ambient glow, couldn't help but remark, "Ugh, this reminds me of the last time we were at a restaurant together. I won't be able to enjoy my food like this."

Sandatsu, unperturbed by her words, slid into the booth. "We needed to lay low for a bit. A family restaurant is inconspicuous enough."

Mio snorted. "Inconspicuous, my ass. You just wanted an excuse to eat like a piece of shit.·

The menu, a laminated collage of culinary delights, lay before them. Sandatsu, seemingly impervious to Mio's acerbic remarks, perused it with genuine interest. "I haven't had a decent meal in ages. Might as well make the most of it."

"Sure. Get whatever you want; it's on these punks' stolen money, after all. I doubt they serve human flesh though, you degenerate."

Sandatsu, unfazed, placed an order that seemed to encompass half the menu – a testament to his voracious appetite.

As the food arrived, a parade of steaming dishes that promised indulgence, Sandatsu dove in with unbridled enthusiasm. Mio, despite her outward disdain, found herself amused by his relentless devouring of the meal "You eat like you've been starving for days. Have some dignity"

Sandatsu merely grunted in response, too engrossed in his feast to acknowledge her words.

Between bites, Mio couldn't help but voice her observations. "You know, for someone who's supposed to be a formidable force, you're pretty damn simple. It's all 'eat, fight, steal quirks.' Everything seems so straightforward when you only have half a brain."

"I'm not to worried. I got you to think for me." Sandatsu, still chewing, spoke without even looking at her.

Mio smirked. As the meal drew to a close, Mio couldn't resist a parting shot. "Hope you enjoyed your last supper, hero. Who knows when we'll get another chance to eat like this?"

Sandatsu, wiping his mouth, shot her a half-smile. "There's always a chance. We just need to be smart about it."

"Those words have an entire new level of disgusting coming from an actual cannibal."

The rhythmic hum of the aquarium's machinery and the soft echo of water created a serene backdrop as Mio and Sandatsu ventured into an environment more tranquil than their usual haunts. The subdued lighting cast a gentle glow on the tanks of aquatic life.

Mio, her expression caught between fascination and annoyance, gestured towards a tank filled with vibrant fish. "Look at these dumb fuckers, swimming around like they've got nothing better to do. Reminds me of you."

He shot her a sidelong glance, unfazed by the insult.

They meandered through the aquarium. Sandatsu, unusually quiet, observed the aquatic life with a contemplative gaze. Mio, despite her harsh words, found herself relaxed.

They reached the main tank, a vast expanse that housed majestic rays and imposing sharks. Mio, seemingly unimpressed, remained silent.

Sandatsu, his eyes fixed on the graceful movement of a manta ray, finally spoke. "I'm hungry again."

"Shut up."

Approaching a tank filled with jellyfish, Mio couldn't resist a jab. "Look, Sandatsu, your kindred spirits. All sting and no substance. And not even a brain!"

He raised an eyebrow. "I can't believe you're enjoying the aquarium this much."

Mio scoffed but didn't deny the truth in his words.

"You know, this might be the last time I get to enjoy something like this for a while," he said, his voice carrying a rare note of uncertainty.

Mio, glancing at him sidelong, replied with a surprising touch of empathy, "Can't keep up with the antipsychotics anymore?"

Sandatsu nodded, a flicker of frustration in his eyes. "Yeah. It's a mess."

Mio's expression remained unreadable, but a subtle softening of her features hinted at an understanding she rarely revealed. "Figured as much."

The shopping mall sprawled before Mio and Sandatsu, a modern cathedral of consumerism aglow with artificial lights. Escalators hummed with a gentle rhythm, ferrying eager shoppers between floors. 

Mio, her eyes gleaming with excitement, pulled Sandatsu into the glamorous chaos of the clothing stores. Sandatsu, resigned to his fate, followed her lead. As they delved into the realm of high-end fashion, Mio's preferences became apparent – designer labels, bold patterns, and the unmistakable allure of expensive brands. And, of course, lots of frilly yellow clothes.

Unbeknownst to either of them, their fingers intertwined. Mio, usually attuned to every detail, seemed oblivious to the newfound intimacy. 

"Here, idiot, hold these," Mio declared, shoving a pile of clothes into Sandatsu's arms. "And don't mess them up. I don't want to buy anything wrinkled."

As Sandatsu awkwardly juggled the growing mound of shopping bags, Mio continued her spree. The boutique attendants observed the peculiar duo – a petite girl with a penchant for expensive tastes and a tall, stoic figure laden with designer bags.

After a whirlwind tour through several boutiques, Mio paused to inspect her growing collection. The bags dangled from Sandatsu's arms like a bizarre fashionista's Christmas tree.

"For once, you're surprisingly useful for something other than brooding."

Sandatsu, resigned to his fate as a human coat rack, managed a wry smile. "Anything for the sake of fashion."

As the duo ventured further into the depths of the shopping mall, Sandatsu, feeling a sudden itch for self-indulgence, decided it was high time to add a touch of personal flair to his wardrobe. With a determined nod, he steered Mio towards a store that seemed to cater to his peculiar taste – a cacophony of clashing colors, gaudy patterns, and questionable fabric choices.

Undeterred by Mio's complaints, Sandatsu dove into the racks with a fervor that surprised even her. The choices he unearthed were a carnival of visual calamities – neon shirts that could blind, pants adorned with garish prints, and accessories that defied all fashion sensibilities.

Mio, as she witnessed the disaster unfolding, couldn't help but speak up "What the fuck? Are you for real?"

Sandatsu, oblivious to the fashion crimes he was committing, raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong with this? It's unique. And I'm trying to find my own style."

Mio snorted, her amusement tainted with disdain. "Unique? More like a fucking eyesore. You look like a walking billboard for bad decisions."

"Hey, if it makes you shut the fuck up then I'll let you pick."

"Alright. Time to turn you into something resembling a human being,"

The first thing Mio did was drag him out of that god forsaken shop. Their first stop after that was a small boutique selling a variety of clothes, from avant-garde streetwear to more conventional styles. Mio, with a discerning eye, began picking out items, tossing them at Sandatsu as if he were an unwilling mannequin.

"Try this. No, not that one, the other," she muttered, her tone a blend of annoyance and amusement "Here, try this. No, not the jacket, the whole outfit

Sandatsu, tolerating the impromptu fashion show, donned various outfits as Mio scrutinized each choice.

After a series of trials, Mio settled on a set of clothes she deemed acceptable. "Finally, something that doesn't make you look like you crawled out of a dumpster. You even look like a person."

As they exited the store, bags laden with pricey attire, the realization of their hand-holding escapade hit them. Mio, a flicker of surprise crossing her features, withdrew her hand. She looked at Sandatsu with an expression of genuine disgust, which he didn't notice.

The outskirts of Kyoto sprawled in eerie silence as Mio and Sandatsu trudged along the dimly lit streets. The night, veiled in shadows, seemed to stretch endlessly, and Mio, her patience wearing thin, voiced her discontent.

"Why the fuck did we have to walk this far? I'm not in the mood for a damn hike," she grumbled, casting a resentful glare at Sandatsu. Unlike other times, now he wasn't able to fly with her to the safehouse, due to his damaged quirk factor.

Ignoring her complaints, Sandatsu scanned the isolated houses that dotted the outskirts. His eyes settled on one dwelling, strategically distant from its neighbors. A devilish idea crept into his mind, and without a word, he led Mio towards it.

As they approached the chosen house, Mio, with a skeptical look, questioned, "This better not be some dumb plan of yours. I'm not in the mood for your bullshit."

Sandatsu, unmoved by her protests, eyed the house. With feline grace, he scaled the exterior until he reached a second-floor window. Peering inside, he observed a figure nestled in the embrace of sleep.

=="You absolute idiot! What the hell are you doing? Answer me!"==

Still ignoring her, Sandatsu focused on his peculiar mission. With a display of strength, he broke the window's lock and gently pushed it open. The cool night air wafted into the room, stirring the slumbering resident.

Mio, frustration mounting, continued her assault. "You're completely insane,. I swear, we avoided being caught this long and now your dumb antics will mess everything up. Now, what the fuck are you—"

Sandatsu, interrupting her tirade, bit into his finger, crimson droplets welling up. Extending his bleeding hand through the window, he hovered it above the sleeping man.

"What in the actual fuck are you doing?" Mio exclaimed, her voice a mixture of disbelief and annoyance.

The droplets of blood fell like raindrops into the sleeping man's mouth. Sandatsu, withdrawing his hand, peered at the altered man with a sense of grim satisfaction. 

With a swift descent, Sandatsu landed gracefully back on solid ground. After a few seconds the man opened the main door with an absent-minded stare. 

Sandatsu strolled into the house with a casual air, leaving Mio trailing behind. The controlled man, guided by unseen forces, drifted towards the kitchen with a detached expression. The glint of metal caught Mio's attention as the young man absently reached for a knife.

"What the hell are you doing?" Mio demanded, her voice a mix of disbelief and unease.

Sandatsu, now comfortably seated in the living room, gestured for Mio to join him. "Relax. We're just making a pit stop. I didn't feel like walking either."

The man was still within Mio's range. Mio, her curiosity overpowering her reservations, couldn't resist delving into the man's memories. Images of a mundane life flashed before her eyes – a bedroom cluttered with gaming peripherals, the echo of parental scolding, and the loneliness that enveloped his existence. He was a NEET living with his parents.

"Maybe I'll set the house on fire for good measure after we're done. But for now let's enjoy ourselves."

As Sandatsu disappeared into the kitchen, Mio navigated the cluttered living room. The controlled NEET, knife in hand, seemed lost in a world of his own as he wandered through the house towards the room where his parents were sleeping, carrying out his part in the macabre plan.

Mio, with a calculated detachment, began rummaging through the entertainment setup. A collection of outdated DVDs and a surprisingly extensive array of streaming services awaited her scrutiny.

Mio, settling on a movie choice, called out to Sandatsu, "Hey dumbass, found some questionable horror movie. Figured it might set the mood."

With a sarcastic smirk, she mumbled to herself, "This is the most messed up movie night."

She was actually having fun.
