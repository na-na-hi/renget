“So… you’ve been able to communicate with it.” 

“Yes.”

“And you’ve achieved this by… drinking its semen.”

Sam’s face remained a mask of neutrality as he sipped his coffee, looking from Jenson to Huan and back again. “Yes.”

His two fellow researchers shared a long look with each other. He could see the mixed emotions playing over either man’s face—the slight sneer of disgust stretching Huan’s lip, and Jenson’s widened eyes betraying the rising panic bubbling under his own mask of composure. He could tell what they were thinking: ‘Dr. Finney has lost his mind’. 

Sam couldn’t blame them, he supposed. Especially as he sat with them in the observation room outside the xenomorph’s holding cell, sipping the coffee he’d had Forrester fetch and acting like he wasn’t completely naked and smeared with strong-smelling, slowly-drying sexual fluids. In his defense, he hadn’t had much time—or will, honestly—to grab his clothes and cover his shame; he was more concerned with trying to explain what he was doing fucking the specimen in the middle of the night-cycle to the trio of his fellow researchers. He’d had to work hard to convince them to let him out of the holding cell, though that was probably more because the xenomorph was free of its bindings. Only when Sam had ordered the xenomorph to go to the far wall of the cell, stroking its crested had and cooing to the monstrous creature, and it had obeyed his word had Jenson, Huan, and Forrester allowed Sam out.

He’d passed through the security door easily—no alarm going off. Did that mean that the mixture which allowed him to communicate with the xenomorph hadn’t altered his physiology? Or that it hadn’t altered it too much?—and that was how he found himself sitting in a plastic chair across from his colleagues and explaining his actions.

Huan pushed his forefinger and thumb up under his wire-frame glasses to knead the corners of his eyes. He had always been a skeptic; invaluable to a scientific team, but quite difficult to work with at times. And so it came as no surprise to Sam when the man let out a long, frustrated sigh and said, “You realize that makes no sense, don’t you?” 

“I can show you the research later.” Sam reached down to set his empty cup between his feet and stood. He stretched—caught the way Jenson’s and Huan’s noses wrinkled and their faces reddened at the waft of pheromones from the xenomorph semen and lubricating fluid on his body—and made his way over to the observation window, where Forrester was staring at the freed specimen. The younger researcher—fresh out of university and grabbed up by Weyland-Yutani immediately after graduation—glanced at him and stepped away, both out of deference to his superior and to hide his own reaction to the sight and scents of Sam’s bare body. Sam ignored Forrester for the moment, pushing at the twinge in his mind—his connection with the xenomorph behind the plexiglass—and drew the creature’s attention. “I’m going to make him wave.” 

“You can do that?” Forrester glanced at Sam, and then looked back to the xenomorph in wonderment.

“Would be a real feat if you could.” 

Sam ignored Huan, and focused on that connection. Images of the xenomorph rising up from its hunched, feral stance, lifting an arm, and waving to the humans in the observation room flitted through his mind and into the creature’s. Sam could see the xenomorph cock its head and feel the confusion pulsing through their connection. A soothing thread of confidence from the human, along with a repeat of the thoughts, answered the creature. Finally, its stance shaky but quickly balanced by its long tail. It looked at the plexiglass observation window—looked right through it to the humans beyond—and lifted its arm. The back-and-forth flopping motion couldn’t really be called a ‘wave’, but it was a damn decent attempt at one. 

“Well I’ll be fucked…” Jenson moved up in between Sam and Forrester to stare at the specimen as it dropped back onto all fours. 

“Well, I doubt you taught it to do that while you were occupied earlier.” Huan crossed his arms over his chest to hum in thought. “And regardless, the fact that it’s showing signs of human behavior is extraordinary. I’m still doubtful about this ‘connection’ you share with it-“ His lips curled at the word, as though spitting something foul out of his mouth. “-but I’m curious.” 

Sam nodded, trying to keep his own lips from curling into a smile. Good, he had their interest. Perhaps beyond convincing them to stay quiet, he could gain their cooperation for further experimentation; he couldn’t do everything by himself, after all. 

“Ah, Dr. Finney?” Forrester’s shaking voice pulled Sam out of his thoughts. “Are you, uh, making the specimen do that, too?” 

Sam glanced back to the specimen, and his stomach leapt into his throat as his cock—and the twinge of their mental connection—spasmed. The xenomorph had turned around to present itself to the four humans behind the observation room window, its tail and rump held high to expose its crotch. Expose the hole that was leaking slick, grayish lubricating fluids down its thighs. Expose the tip of the length pushing through the plates hiding its genital orifices. It was hissing and groaning, head turned to set its eyeless stare right on Sam—on the xenomorph’s mate. A clawed hand reached back to rub at the base of its tail, and that was when the thoughts poured through their connection to fill Sam’s mind.

The change of its posture had triggered the completion of its gestation cycle. The eggs within its abdomen had already shifted into place, and were ready to slide out of its orifice and into the world. The xenomorph was ready to lay its eggs—bear their children—and set up the beginnings of their hive. 

Both Sam’s teeth and his eyes clenched as he took in a sharp, hissing breath and squeezed his throbbing cock. The shaft was pulsing back to erection as the thoughts tore through his mind like a gale.

“Can you control yourself, please.” 

He ignored Huan’s scowl and disapproving glare. He ignored the curious glances Jenson was giving him. He ignored the wide-eyed stare from Forrester as the youngest of the four present men gulped hard. Sam turned his thoughts away from and ignored his own arousal as he looked to his colleagues. “The xenomorph is about to lay.” The announcement sent a thrill of shock through the present men; Forrester looked to Huan and Jenson, and the two looked to Sam. For a moment, the previous conversation was forgotten. 

“We need to collect the eggs.” Huan glanced into the holding cell. “Perhaps cryo would be a good idea, at least until we figure out what’s in them.” 

“Right.” With the authority of a head researcher who wasn’t nude and covered in drying alien semen, Sam nodded to Forrester and Jenson. “You two, requisition a few cryo tubes. Huan and I will monitor the subject during the laying process.”

Jenson nodded, and gestured for Forrester to follow him. When they were gone, Huan turned towards the control panel while muttering and murmuring to himself, and Sam considered the man from behind. Forrester would be easy to deal with; he hadn’t ignored the steadily-growing tent in the younger researcher’s pants at the sight of his body, naked and smeared with musky fluids, or the flush on Forrester’s face as he regarded the xenomorph. Jenson was curious—a true scientist—and would be eager to see the experiment to its conclusion; and his earlier comment had already ignited the spark of inspiration for some further ‘experimentation’ in which his colleague could participate. Huan, however, was a problem; they’d never liked each other, and this was the perfect opportunity for the other man to screw him over. Sam had seen both the sneer on Huan’s face and the cogs working behind the man’s eyes. If he took what he had learned to the Board, Huan would have an excellent case to have Sam removed from his position as head researcher and silenced. 

Sam couldn’t allow that. He’d already sunk too much of himself into the experiment; had already committed to seeing the specimen’s—his mate’s—pregnancy through, and to studying the behavior of the resulting offspring. And so, while Huan was occupied considering how to get the sensors from the bindings back onto the xenomorph, Sam put his slowly-brewed plan into action. 

Huan turned at the sound of the security door opening. “And just what are you doing?” 

“Going in to monitor the specimen.” Sam glanced over to meet Huan’s gaze. “Are you coming or not?” 

“With the specimen free?” 

“I’ve already proven that I can communicate with it. It’s perfectly safe.” Sam smirked, reaching down to grasp his cock and slowly stroke it. “It even likes me, as I’m sure you’ve seen.” 

Huan grunted, glancing down at Sam’s working hand with another twist of his lip. He looked like he was about to say something, and then paused. Considered. Lifted his hand to his face to rub at his nose. 

“This is our chance, Huan. Our chance to get up close and personal with the specimen. To examine it more thoroughly than we’ve ever been able to. Its behavior. Its physiology. How its mating cycle works.” Sam tilted his head towards the open doorway. “I’ve already laid the groundwork. If my hypothesis is correct, then we’ll finally be on track to produce more. Like the Board wants.” 

That—along with the faint waft of the pheromone-rich scent that had filled the holding cell through the opened security door—finally seemed to do the trick. Huan glanced from Sam, to the creature in the cell, to the control panel. Finally, he sighed. “Very well, Dr. Finney. I’ll follow your lead.” 

Sam lead Huan into the holding cell, and felt a smile tug at his lips as the xenomorph rushed over to press its crested head up against his caressing hands; and maybe also at the strangled squeak of fear from Huan. He looked to the other human, one eyebrow raised, and pressed his crotch forward against the specimen’s eager face. “You see? It’s perfectly harmless.” He could feel the humid, hissing breath of the xenomorph against his balls, and see the color rising to Huan’s cheeks as the other man’s eyes darted to the point of contact. Lustful thoughts from the creature filled Sam’s mind, fueling his erection as it ground against the smooth chitin. 

“Yes, I see.” Huan gulped, turning his gaze firmly away from the sight before him. “Well? Shall we?” 

“You might want to get out of those clothes. Things may get a bit messy.” 

Huan answered with a scowl. “I’m perfectly fine like this, thank you.” 

Sam shrugged. “Suit yourself.” He kneeled down to look the xenomorph in the face, caressing its precum-smeared crest. Meeting its eyeless gaze as his hand moved below the creature, first to grip and pump its own freely-leaking erection, and then to press against the firm rise of its abdomen. Their children. The thought surged through the connection between them, making both man and alien hiss in pleasure. Sam felt a brief, faint stab of fear somewhere in the back of his mind as the xenomorph’s fang-filled maw opened, allowing its inner jaw to loll out. Sinuous and prehensile, almost like a tongue. Darting forward to brush against his cheek; a sign of affection? Intimacy? 

He was snapped out of his reverie as Huan cleared his throat with impatience, and felt his irritation at the interruption echoed by the xenomorph through the twinge of their connection. “Well?”

“Mmmf, yes.” Sam stroked along the xenomorph’s neck, down to its shoulder, and pushed an image of it presenting itself like it had earlier through their connection. In answer, the creature hissed and turned itself around, hunching down on all fours. And there, again, Sam was able to appreciate the sight before him. The freely-leaking orifice at the base of the xenomorph’s tail, and the thick, prehensile member squirming beneath it. He grasped the xenomorph’s flanks, giving the chitinous flesh a squeeze as his thumbs worked over and between the plates and the tender flesh underneath. “Come here, I need you to help me catch the eggs as they drop.” 

Huan grunted, rubbing his nose as he approached to kneel beside his colleague, and Sam grinned while glancing at the other human. Huan’s cheeks were flushed, and his gaze was locked on the winking hole at the base of the specimen’s tail. As his colleague shifted, Sam could see the tent in Huan’s slacks pressing and pulsing against the fabric. So the creature’s pheromones did indeed affect others as much as they did him; that was good to know.

“Amazing, isn’t he?” 

“Yes…” Huan seemed to be transfixed. He reached out, joining Sam in stroking the xenomorph’s flanks, and shivered as he heard the creature’s hissing and groaning.

“Don’t worry, he likes that.” Sam’s voice was soft and sibilant as he grasped the xenomorph’s wriggling erection. Slowly pumping the flesh as he pushed warm, comforting, aroused feelings through the twinge of their connection. He felt relief from the creature; relief and relaxation, accompanied by a surge of pain-pleasure as, once again, its insides shifted with the new life preparing to emerge. “Get ready, he’s about to lay.” 

“Mm.” 

The process was quick, once it had actually begun. Sam crooned and soothed the creature, and ignored the pulsing and throbbing of his cock in favor of stroking the creature’s own member. Both humans watched as the xenomorph’s rear orifice winked, clenched, and then stretched wide open around the leathery egg sliding through its back passage. Slick, pungent lubricating fluids smeared over Huan’s hands as he caught the first egg that dropped; the man’s expression was a mixture of revulsion and fascination as he hefted the large, elongated orb. Sam quickly told to him to set it aside and prepare for the next one, and Huan followed the head researcher’s directions with a distracted grunt. 

The xenomorph whined as the second egg settled into its birthing canal, and Sam groaned as he felt the thoughts and sensations racing through the creature’s mind shoot through their connection into his. It hurt, it hurt so much. But at the same time, it felt so good. Their offspring—their children—stretching and teasing the creature’s sensitive inner walls as they entered the world. A prelude to the stretching and teasing they would be giving both it and Sam once they were hatched, matured, and ready to breed and be bred in their turn. 

A fantasy flickered through Sam’s mind; he and the creature—his mate—at the center of their hive, surrounded by their offspring. Chitinous bodies pressing against them both. Long, tapered, throbbing cocks and wet, humid, eager breeding holes presented for Sam to explore with his fingers and hands and mouth and tongue and erection.

“Kinky little thing, aren’t you…” Sam huffed out a hoarse sigh, and pressed a kiss to the creature’s flexing orifice. His lips working over the sphincter as his tongue delved into the hot, clenching passage. He could taste both fertility and arousal, a mixture of musky flavors that hazed his brain and made his cock jump between his thighs. Sam was only brought back to himself by a rough prod from Huan, who was staring at him with disgust even as his cheeks flushed and the tent in his slacks throbbed.

“If you are quite finished…?” 

“I’m only getting started.” Sam couldn’t deny the thrill down his spine and straight to his erection as Huan sputtered and stuttered. Good, the other man was tilted. He could set his plan into motion.

The second egg dropped, Sam and Huan catching it together, and then the third was accompanied by a relieved purr from the xenomorph. Three eggs in total; a small clutch, but proof that the xenomorph’s method of reproduction could be altered. Now would come the difficult part: ascertaining that the eggs were truly viable, and that whatever hatched out of them would be of use to Weyland-Yutani. 

But Sam wasn’t concerned about that. He continued to stroke his mate’s crotch and pet its rump, letting his fingers play between the bony plates and ridges at the base of its waving tail, and gazed at his offspring. The lubricating fluid was already drying, and the leathery shells were hardening. Protecting the new lives inside, and preparing them for the moment of their birth. 

“Fascinating.” Huan rubbed at his nose, trying to keep the pheromone-filled stench of the air surrounding him, Sam, and the specimen out of his lungs. He was already panting and flushed, feeling its effects, but seemed determined to ignore them in favor of examining the xenomorph’s eggs. “Once Jenson and Forrester return with the cryotubes, we can put two on ice and set the third up to analyze its biometrics. But first, I think I need a long shower. If you don’t need me for anything else, Dr. Finney?” No answer. Huan turned, one brow raised. “Dr. Fin-?”

He was cut off with a muffled grunt as Sam surged forward to pull him into a deep kiss. The two men struggled for a moment, Sam pressing his naked, aroused body onto Huan and pushing his musk-stained tongue between the other man’s shock-slackened jaws. The still-clothed researcher groaned as the flavors tingled on his own tongue, and tried desperately to bat Sam away even as the pungent, cloying pheromones worked into his system. Weakened his flailing and shoving. Made him fall back onto the cell floor with Sam atop him. 

The two humans panted as the kiss broke. Sam looking down to meet Huan’s swimming, hazey eyes. He grinned, pushing his hips down onto the other researcher’s, and felt the throb of his cock answered with a pulse from beneath Huan’s slacks. “Tastes good, yes?” 

“Yes…” The man’s voice was distant, faint, weak and feeble. He seemed unable to do anything but lay beneath Sam and let the head researcher smear musk-stained fingers over his lips and under his nose. Filling his lungs with mating pheromones; making sure it was all he would be able to smell. Letting the rich scent pulse through his mind and veins and wash away his inhibitions, as they had for Sam. 

“You want more?” 

“Yes…” 

“Then strip.” Sam grinned to Huan, and then looked to his mate. The xenomorph approached, cock still out and throbbing and leaking, to nuzzle against him and hiss in arousal. As he reached down to toy with the creature’s erection, he pushed images through their connection and into the alien’s mind. Straddling Huan’s upper body. Pushing its crotch down onto the other human’s face. Grinding down onto it as the human inhaled its scent and tasted its cock and breeding hole. Like earlier, the xenomorph was confused by this new positioning, but as Sam kissed its crest and bony neck, it grew eager to try.

Meanwhile, Huan removed his clothes. His movements were slow and trance-like, as though the man was sleepwalking as he shrugged his coat off and unbuttoned his shirt and slacks. He could feel Sam’s gaze on his slowly-revealed body. Feel the specimen’s eyeless gaze on him as well, curious and full of lust. Now he was the specimen, to be examined and poked and prodded as he lay back and took everything the two had planned for him. 

For some reason, that thought made his cock throb and splatter a shot of precum across his stomach as it bobbed free. 

“Yes, good.” Sam moved forward, taking over pulling Huan’s pants and underwear down and off as he pushed down against the other researcher’s bared chest. Huan could only allow himself to be pushed back down with a low groan, feeling Finney’s hand stroke its way down. Over his belly and thighs. Between his legs to cup his ballsack and run a thumb over the short, fat length of his erection. “Hm… not really optimal for breeding, but I’m sure we can work with it.”  Huan could feel hot breath over his crotch, a nose pressing against the base of his cock and inhaling slowly and deeply, and lips working over his balls one at a time. He looked up, peering through the mists of pheromone-induced arousal to see the specimen straddling his chest. Lifting its tail to present its crotch to him. Slowly lowering itself down onto his face, and making Huan’s world narrow down to a single point of black chitin and soft flesh and sweet, exotic, delicious musk. 

Sam felt a rumbling chuckle in his throat as his tongue caressed the other human’s ballsack. His senses felt heightened somehow; he could taste the sweat and musk of Huan’s crotch, and smell the arousal pulsing in the other man’s erection as he took the length into his mouth to suckle on it. He felt the eagerness in the way the other man’s hips rocked up against his face as Huan shivered and moaned in need. Was it merely the strange, sexual thrill he felt at debasing the other researcher like this? Or was it his connection with the creature, the seminal concoction he’d drunk to bond with it, changing him in some way? Sam couldn’t be sure, but as he bobbed on Huan’s cock and pressed his fingers into the man’s taint, he found that he couldn’t care. 

A low, hissing moan in his ear and a gentle nuzzle against his cheek drew his attention away from his fellow researcher’s crotch. The xenomorph had hunched over to bring its head down next to his, curious about their newest breeding partner. Sam felt the corners of his lips tug up into a smile as he set a hand on the creature’s crest, and slowly pushed its face down to Huan’s cock and balls. He watched in fascination as the creature took in the other male’s scent, feeling the rush of arousal his fellow human’s hormones and pheromones caused the creature pulsing through his own cock. The creature’s jaws opened, and again its inner mouth extended. Slowly. Carefully. Opening up to engulf Huan’s erection in the tight, clenching tube of the xenomorph’s throat. 

Sam stroked himself, watching the two. His breeding partners. The way Huan rubbed his face all over the xenomorph’s sensitive, needy, leaking breeding hole and the length of its wriggling cock. How the xenomorph emulated the bobbing motion he’d been doing only a moment ago as it pleasured the other researcher in turn. Sam moved to Huan’s head, patting the man’s flushed cheek with his erection to get his colleague’s distracted, muzzy attention. “It’s sucking your cock, Huan. Can you feel it?” The moan of affirmation only made Sam’s grin widen. “Why don’t you return the favor?” 

Huan hesitated. His gaze, swimming with lust and arousal, tried desperately to clear itself for a moment. Then Sam rubbed the head of his cock against the other researcher’s nose, cloying the man’s breath with his own scent, and Huan moaned again; this time, in assent. He grasped the thick, pulsing, wriggling member hanging from the specimen’s crotch, just taking a moment to feel it throbbing in his grip, and then pulled it back to slip the tapered tip between his lips. 

Sam could hear a purr from the xenomorph, and stroked its flank as it began to hump into Huan’s suckling mouth. “That’s right. That’s good. Suck. Drink its semen.” He resumed stroking his cock, watching as the human and xenomorph—his specimens, his breeding partners, his mates—pleasured each other. Huan pushing forward to bury his nose in the gap between the creature’s crotch plates, taking deep sniffs of the rubber-fruit musk wafting freely from both of its slits. The creature pulling its inner mouth back and forth, the tight tube sliding up and down the length of the human’s erection.

Finally, Sam saw the bucking of Huan’s hips growing desperate. With a mental push from its mate, the xenomorph pulled off to allow Sam to grasp his colleague’s length and pump it mercilessly to orgasm. With the first spurts of thick human cum across its face and chest, the xenomorph let out a crooning hiss and hilted in Huan’s throat. 

It was pumping its cum directly into the other researcher’s stomach. 

Sam watched, an idea blossoming in his racing mind. If the seminal mixture he’d drunk allowed him a connection with the xenomorph, what would come of a mixture of his, its, and Huan’s cum? As the creature pulled away from his colleague, leaving Huan gasping and panting as oily black fluid flowed from his slack jaw, Sam gathered up as much of the other human’s splattered cum as he could. Scraped it off of Huan’s belly and crotch, and off of his mate’s face. With a gentle hum, he fed the semen to Huan, holding his hand out to let his colleague suckle it off his hand and fingers. And when he offered his still-leaking erection to the man, Huan latched onto it without a single complaint. 

Hump. Hump. Groan. Hilt. Cum. 

He pulled back, panting and groaning as the relief of finally spilling his pent-up seed washed through him. Reached out to stroke the xenomorph’s chest as it crawled over to press and nuzzle against him. Watched as Huan rolled over onto his hands and knees, coughing and retching and groaning as his body shivered. Shuddered. Convulsed. 

The twinge in his mind growing sharper for a moment. Twisting and stinging like a spike being driven into the side of his skull. 

Huan looked to Sam, and Sam looked back to his colleague. Both of them could feel it; the faint, dull itch. The buzz. The connection. In a single moment, understanding between the two men flared and bloomed. They could ‘hear’ each others’ thoughts, and feel each others’ pleasure; theirs, and that of the xenomorph. Huan moved over to join the creature and his colleague—his mates—and settled against Sam. The two stroked and explored each other; Huan’s hands on Sam’s shoulders, kneading and massaging, and Sam’s hand moving down to the plump curve of his fellow researcher’s ass. Sam found heat down there, heat and dampness, and pushed his finger into Huan’s cleft to brush against the man’s slickened pucker. 

Pleasure surged through the twinge of their mental connection. Desire. Need. Huan’s hole becoming something similar to the xenomorph’s; an orifice to be fucked, bred, and filled with seed. 

Interesting. 

“Uh… Dr. Finney? Dr. Huan?” Sam was, once again, broken out of his musings by Forrester’s shaky voice. The young researcher and Jenson had returned with the cryotubes—took them long enough—and were standing near the security door. Sam could see their wide, staring eyes. Their flushed cheeks. The pulsing tents in their slacks.

He smiled. “Ah, Jenson, Forrester. Perfect timing, you two. I’ve got an experiment I’d like to perform, and I need your help…”
