>you were warned of the taint of chaos
>warned of it for years upon years
>the terrifying reach of it
>from the plagues to the Norscan raids
>your life was devoted to Sigmar and the empire
>stacking crates on a dock
>you didn't question the path laid out for you
>you were just another wheel keeping the empire going
>stacking crates on a dock
>some may go as far to call you some sort of faceless underling
>swashbuckling was not for you
>if drafted to fight you'd fight but you were by no means quick to rush into it
>most of the men had been drafted into wars already
>leaving you one of the last defenders unfortunately
>actually defending such a small river town wasn't a high priority

>almost all the other militia broke and fled because of this
>you just hoped it would be over quick
>purple and pink that almost hurt to look at
>the sweetest smells filled your nostrils, mixed with something salty
>strange beastmen cavorting through the town

>his gaudy talismans and fetishes dangling like windchimes on his neck, horns and other places
>you weren't prepared for the flying tackle that took your feet from out from under you
>"my own man!"
