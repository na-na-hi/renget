#void nigga things

"『 』"- An absence so absolute not even nothingness remains. Being nameless, the closest way to refer to such a lack of being is through silence.

Xū's cultivation is not limited by energy or Qi reserves, but by the sheer risk of erasing too much of himself. Each of his techniques comes at a personal cost. The more he uses them, the closer he comes to becoming nothing himself. To avoid this fate, he must incorporate cooldown periods between the use of his techniques. These periods allow him to recover and rebuild his own existence, ensuring that he doesn't erase too much of himself in the process.

Xū's "『 』" affinity has an inherent "lacking" nature. It replaces Qi usage, and should any be infused into Xū then it will be erased. If the Qi used against him is from someone of the same Grade and in sufficient quantity, it can disrupt him temporarily, forcing him to focus on erasing the foreign Qi before he can utilize his own techniques. This creates a unique vulnerability that other cultivators may seek to exploit. However, it's a risky thing to pull off, since it means depleting your own reserves and leaving yourself vulnerable.

Disrupting "『 』" with Life Energy requires a significantly larger quantity of Life Energy compared to Qi. It's a resource-intensive endeavor and can quickly deplete the assailant's own Life Energy reserves. The sheer volume of Life Energy needed to interrupt Xū's techniques makes it a less practical approach. Even when significant amounts of Life Energy are used, the disruption caused is less effective compared to Qi. While it may create temporary disturbances in Xū's techniques, the results are not as potent, and the disruptions are easier for him to counteract.

Using Soul Energy against Xū's "『 』" affinity is the least effective and least reliable method of disruption, even more so than Life Energy. This is primarily due to the unique nature of Xū's soul and its profound connection with "『 』". Xū's cultivation has left his soul deeply intertwined with the essence of "『 』," to the extent that he could be considered basically soulless. When Soul Energy is used to disrupt Xū's techniques, the results are generally minimal and temporary. His soul's inherent emptiness counters the impact of Soul Energy, erasing it incredibly fast.

>Techniques
**Qi Cultivation** 
"N/0"
Rather than the conventional approach of gathering, refining, and strengthening one's Qi and inner world, practitioners of N/0 walk a path of dissolution and subtraction.  By embracing this unique technique, cultivators learn to relinquish their own existence and shed the layers of their being, slowly unraveling the threads of both their Qi, and themselves. However, they also slowly erase their limitations, essentially becoming "less" in order to become "more". The potential to do anything, born from nothing.

Their inner worlds eventually cease to be, and only a void remains. And their attacks, movements, techniques and just about anything they do have a sense of lacking, absence or hollowness to them.

**Footwork**
"Missing Path"
An extraordinary  footwork technique that defies the laws of conventional movement in combat. It is characterized by the remarkable ability to erase the middle part of his actions, creating the illusion of not only teleportation, but sudden shifts in speed, direction, momentum and orientation. In essence, his movements possess only a clear beginning and a sudden end, with nothing in between. This extraordinary art grants  an uncanny advantage in battles, as adversaries struggle to predict or respond to the inexplicable gaps in his movements, and any maneuvers or shifts made during them, since they are erased as well.

**Attack**
"Vanish"
A very straighforward technique. It's the most basic and controlled application of Xū's 『 』. It's an attack that seeks to hollow out the target. A single flick of the wrist could cause a set of implosions as the air is erased, or rips in space itself if not used with the utmost care. Simply put, is an attack that puts holes (or any shape the user wants really) into things.

**Life Saving**
"Curtain Call"
This extraordinary art has the power to erase his own death, rendering his demise into nothingness, and thereby allowing for his complete revival, regardless of the condition he was in or the manner of his passing. There is no lingering injury, no trace of the fatal blow. His life is restored, and he returns to in perfect health, the irrevocable force of death disregarded. However, its use is limited to only a few occurrences.

**Trump Card**
"End"
Its singular purpose is the absolute elimination of the target, erasing their existence through direct exposure to "『 』".  Using this technique for anything else other than complete annihilation is incredibly difficult. If not aimed at a specific target then it becomes exponentially more dangerous, as it becomes harder to control without just turning the entire area into nothing.

**Endurance**
"Hollow Restoration"
Its primary goal is to heal his wounds by erasing the damage inflicted, turning the effects of attacks into nothingness. This art makes him impervious to the lasting effects of harm, granting him an unwavering resilience against any form of injury as long as he keeps this technique active. The injuries he sustains are systematically unraveled, as if they were never inflicted. Bruises fade, bones mend, and even the most grievous wounds are erased, returning his body to its peak condition. While it can restore damage, it can't prevent it in the first place though.

**Other**
"『 』Unbound"
A technique that allows for truly esoteric usage of Xū's mastery over emptiness and the depths of his affinity with "『 』". His ability to target what he erases becomes fully abstract, even allowing for things like turning previous erasures into nothing, thus reverting them. It allows Xū to selectively preserve and restore aspects of existence, effectively controlling the boundaries between what remains and what is eradicated. 

His other methods of erasure tend to be more indirect, for example "Vanish" is an attack that hollows out the target through erasure, "End" is another offensive technique that seeks no annihilate the target completely. Even his reality warping abilities are just the act of using "『 』"  through the authority of his Realm.

"『 』Unbound" is a much more direct approach. The target simply is no more. It can be anything, really. Turn a single thought of your opponent into nothing, making their battle plan fall apart. Turn the link between someone's strength and the attack they are using into nothing. Erase weak spots from the enemy's perception so they can't be targeted. Target the knowledge of how to use a specific technique, making it so that they can't activate it. Erase the fact that an attack landed.

It's a technique to target truly abstract things.


**Body Tempering**
"Empty Vessel"
A technique with the primary objective of enhancing his physical capabilities by erasing the limitations of his body. He becomes a vessel for boundless potential as he erases the limitations of his physical form. Unlike other Body Tempering methods, which revolve around a transformative process, Empty Vessel doesn't change the body itself, and instead, bit by bit, gets rid of the shackles of logic that applied to it in the first place.

**Soul Refining**
"Soul Dispersion"
Soul Refining technique designed to dissolve one's soul within『 』, weaving it into the very fabric of emptiness. The result is a soul so intertwined with the void that it appears all but non-existent to external observers, making others mistake Xū for an undead being. Yet, his soul retains a functional essence, enabling him to operate with a soul that seems to teeter on the edge of existence, and, hidden within the void, it benefits from it becoming more powerful as its limitations are slowly lost within the nothingness, while also remaining incredibly hard to reach as well.

>Fightin Styles
Either just talking shit (it's a valid fighting style) or completely formless

Xū has developed a remarkable proficiency in utilizing his "『 』" affinity in combat directly, often eschewing the use of formal techniques. Instead, he prefers to rely on his innate connection with emptiness and nothingness, reserving his techniques for situations that truly demand their power. In combat, Xū employs his "『 』" affinity defensively, evading attacks with fluid movements and the subtle manipulation of emptiness. He can phase through attacks or create temporary void shields to protect himself, all without the need for explicit techniques. 

He frequently engages in verbal exchanges rather than immediate combat. When faced with opponents who underestimate the nature of their confrontation, Xū can resort to mocking banter. He might taunt their limited understanding of their situation and who they're trying to pick a fight with.
He may also assert that he does not recognize the encounter as a genuine conflict, viewing it as a mere disturbance in his path. In such instances, he might advise his aggressors to halt their actions, emphasizing the futility of their endeavors.  In cases where his assailants persist in their attacks, Xū may deliver a dire warning. He does not engage in combat lightly, and he emphasizes that, should he choose to fight back, it will be to the death. 

To those who refuse to heed his warnings, Xū delivers the gravest of ultimatums. He makes it clear that if he decides to retaliate, it will result in their complete erasure, the cessation of their existence. When he does decide to use a technique (other thna his footwork), it's too late.

Xū is selective about employing most of his formal techniques. He typically reserves them for adversaries of significant power or challenges that warrant his full attention. Otherwise, Vanish and Missing Path tend to be enough.

>**A bit of background**
He has spent thousands of years trapped against his will as a punishment for a crime that has long fallen into oblivion. During his confinement, he honed his inner strength and deepened his understanding of the boundless void within him.
The punishment was a crucible, and Xū emerged from it not only unbroken but with newfound wisdom. His heart remained kind, and his spirit, undeterred. Now free again, he wanders the world, seeking to share his wisdom with those willing to learn and guiding them along their paths. Xū is a very carefree individual, and he can be considered either a fool or a genius. Despite his appearance, he is very kind and is also a great (while also very eccentric) teacher.
Xū is extremely laid back for a cultivator, and at first glance, it always seems like he doesn't care about anything, but in reality, he's extremely aware and sharp. He loves to fool around, sometimes acting like a bit of a pervert, other times like a clown, but never without his ever-present smile.
