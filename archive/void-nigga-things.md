**Qi Cultivation** 
"N/0"
Rather than the conventional approach of gathering, refining, and strengthening one's Qi and inner world, practitioners of N/0 walk a path of dissolution and subtraction.  By embracing this unique technique, cultivators learn to relinquish their own existence and shed the layers of their being, slowly unraveling the threads of both their Qi, and themselves. However, they also slowly erase their limitations, essentially becoming "less" in order to become "more". The potential to do anything, born from nothing.

Their inner worlds eventually cease to be, and only a void remains. And their attacks, movements, techniques and just about anything they do have a sense of lacking, absence or hollowness to them.

**Footwork**
"Missing Path"
An extraordinary  footwork technique that defies the laws of conventional movement in combat. It is characterized by the remarkable ability to erase the middle part of his actions, creating the illusion of not only teleportation, but sudden shifts in speed, direction, momentum and orientation. In essence, his movements possess only a clear beginning and a sudden end, with nothing in between. This extraordinary art grants  an uncanny advantage in battles, as adversaries struggle to predict or respond to the inexplicable gaps in his movements, and any maneuvers or shifts made during them, since they are erased as well.

**Attack**
"Vanish"
A very straighforward technique. It's the most basic and controlled application of Xū's 『 』. It's an attack that seeks to hollow out the target. A single flick of the wrist could cause a set of implosions as the air is erased, or rips in space itself if not used with the utmost care. Simply put, is an attack that puts holes (or any shape the user wants really) into things.

**Life Saving**
"Curtain Call"
This extraordinary art has the power to erase his own death, rendering his demise into nothingness, and thereby allowing for his complete revival, regardless of the condition he was in or the manner of his passing. There is no lingering injury, no trace of the fatal blow. His life is restored, and he returns to in perfect health, the irrevocable force of death disregarded. However, its use is limited to only a few occurrences.

**Trump Card**
"End"
Its singular purpose is the absolute elimination of the target, erasing their existence through direct exposure to "『 』".  Using this technique for anything else other than complete annihilation is incredibly difficult. If not aimed at a specific target then it becomes exponentially more dangerous, as it becomes harder to control without just turning the entire area into nothing.

**Endurance**
"Hollow Restoration"
Its primary goal is to heal his wounds by erasing the damage inflicted, turning the effects of attacks into nothingness. This art makes him impervious to the lasting effects of harm, granting him an unwavering resilience against any form of injury as long as he keeps this technique active. The injuries he sustains are systematically unraveled, as if they were never inflicted. Bruises fade, bones mend, and even the most grievous wounds are erased, returning his body to its peak condition. While it can restore damage, it can't prevent it in the first place though.

**Other**
i forgot why i picked this so im gonna ignore it it was supposed to be an auxiliary technique 

**Body Tempering**
"Empty Vessel"
A technique with the primary objective of enhancing his physical capabilities by erasing the limitations of his body. He becomes a vessel for boundless potential as he erases the limitations of his physical form. Unlike other Body Tempering methods, which revolve around a transformative process, Empty Vessel doesn't change the body itself, and instead, bit by bit, gets rid of the shackles of logic that applied to it in the first place.

**Soul Refining**
"Soul Dispersion"
Soul Refining technique designed to dissolve one's soul within『 』, weaving it into the very fabric of emptiness. The result is a soul so intertwined with the void that it appears all but non-existent to external observers, making others mistake Xū for an undead being. Yet, his soul retains a functional essence, enabling him to operate with a soul that seems to teeter on the edge of existence, and, hidden within the void, it benefits from it becoming more powerful as its limitations are slowly lost within the nothingness, while also remaining incredibly hard to reach as well.

>Fightin Styles
Either just talking shit (it's a valid fighting style) or completely formless

>**A bit of background**
He has spent thousands of years trapped against his will as a punishment for a crime that has long fallen into oblivion. During his confinement, he honed his inner strength and deepened his understanding of the boundless void within him.
The punishment was a crucible, and Xū emerged from it not only unbroken but with newfound wisdom. His heart remained kind, and his spirit, undeterred. Now free again, he wanders the world, seeking to share his wisdom with those willing to learn and guiding them along their paths. Xū is a very carefree individual, and he can be considered either a fool or a genius. Despite his appearance, he is very kind and is also a great (while also very eccentric) teacher.
Xū is extremely laid back for a cultivator, and at first glance, it always seems like he doesn't care about anything, but in reality, he's extremely aware and sharp. He loves to fool around, sometimes acting like a bit of a pervert, other times like a clown, but never without his ever-present smile.
