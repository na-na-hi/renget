##Authorities (9/10):

>Monstrosification (EX): 
You may assume the true form of the monster from your <Myth>. In doing so, the power of your authorities as well as all of your physical capabilities increases dramatically with incarnation level.

>Bonds of Trust (EX):
When you form a relationship of mutual trust with another <Incarnation>, you may copy one of their authorities, and they may copy one of yours. If one partner breaks that trust, they lose the authority they copied. However, the betrayed party keeps their authority from the traitor

>Siren’s Song (4):

The sound of your voice acts as a lure, driving people towards it. Your voice carries naturally over an amount of distance proportional to this authority’s level without an increase in volume. Additionally, anyone with whom you directly communicate while using this authority becomes infatuated with you

>Pearlescent Wings  (3):

You may use your wings to fly through air or water without the proportional muscle exertion, and at speeds which can not be attained by mortal means, by expending divinity, up to 10 per minute. The feathers have a slight alluring effect. Prolonged proximity to these feathers creates feelings of desire and subordination towards you.

It is also possible to visualize the emotions of whomever you set eyes upon, including animals. 

>Perfect Partner (4):

You may assume the ideal form of a platonic or romantic role a target desires in their life. You also gain a subconscious understanding of the target’s desires and preferences regarding whatever role you use this authority to fulfill. You may also use this authority to transform yourself into any human form which you consider to be attractive. The information-gathering aspects of this authority can be resisted by higher level incarnations or authorities

>Mediate (4):

You may create an area in which people are incapable of taking aggressive actions against one another. The aggressive emotions of individuals within that area are calmed. Additionally, this authority induces positive feelings towards you in the individuals within the affected area
