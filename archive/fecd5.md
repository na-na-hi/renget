# Yasha Relationship Chart

[TOC]

#### Ming Ming
>As a person
"Oh, her! We've done business before. I had these spare qi spirit stones I took from the Crimson Prison, but I couldn't use them, so I traded with her for a new scabbard."
>Private thoughts
*I'm pretty sure she ripped me off. How adorable.*
>As an opponent
"Eh? No way. She's too weak."

#### Zheng Hao
>As a person
"From what I'm told, he seems nice. But there's not much else to say, because he's early into his road to immortality. And unlike me, he doesn't have any infamy."
>As an opponent
"I'd feel bad if I hurt him, so I won't challenge him anytime soon."

#### Yexin
>As a person
"I'm never eating anything she makes. Food made with techniques is no joke. I had a Grade 5 meal back in the Crimson Prison, and everything else tasted like misery for a few weeks. It's pure ecstasy when you take a bite, but it also pampers your palate."
>Private thoughts
*Man... I wish I had a cook cultivator to help my body tempering. I bet I could finally break to Grade 5 with that kind of support.*
>As an opponent
"Her soul probably has an interesting taste."

#### Heng Zhiqiang
>As a person
"The Hongjian Sect is really scared of this guy for some reason. So I'm sure we could get along well!"
>As an opponent
"No idea. The Truth That's Written In The Stone is pretty vague on what he does."

!!! note Author's note
	 The Truth That's Written In The Stone is what Yasha calls his treasure's future sight whenever he's feeling fancy.

#### The Boneless Old Man
>As a person
"A pleasant old man. The puns get old fast, though."
>Private thoughts
*He deserves a better nickname.*
>As an opponent
"I respect his desire for peace, so I won't ask for a fight."
>As a teacher
"I'm sure he's skilled at it, but since he focuses on Qi, I wouldn't benefit from any practical lessons with him. And his mindset isn't something I need right now."

#### Xiu Yi
>As a person
"The Hongjian Sect hates her, so obviously I love her!"

"A~hahaha... I joke, but she is somewhat inspirational. There were a lot of people trapped in the Crimson Prison who were saved by her before, and some of them helped me during my escape. Her goodwill managed to reach even me, so I'll treat her to something if we meet."

>As an opponent
"I just need to experience her in action at least once. It doesn't matter it we're fighting side by side or sparring."
>As a teacher
"She's apparently good at Body Tempering, which could help me. I'm sure she wouldn't mind, considering her pursuit of the Tao."

#### Gyldenwulf
>As a person
"He's... scum. There are plenty of people like him roaming around, he's simply one of the stronger ones. The rubbish at the top of the pile, if you will."
>As an opponent
"Unlike most of my opponents, if I were to fight and somehow win against him, I wouldn't spare his life."
>As a teacher
"No."

#### Shu Luxing
>As a person
"We traveled together for a bit, right after I broke out of the Crimson Prison. I was recovering in the same cave she was cultivating her qi, and one of the walls bust down because of her spirit root, which led to my sleeping body dropping in front of her."

"She only accompanied me until I reached my home, but it was a breath of fresh air compared to the people I had to deal with in the sect. She also taught me a lot about storytelling, and even helped me improve some of the chants for my techniques!"

"... I hope I can show her more improvement when we meet again."
>As an opponent
"We've sparred. It was good practice for using my Twilight."
>As a teacher
"She couldn't help my cultivation directly, but her philosophy of Discovery gave me a lot to think about. Mostly about how I use my techniques. When our paths cross again, I wouldn't mind learning more from her."

#### Morgain Blackheart
>As a person
"I wanna go to her circus someday. It sounds exactly like my kind of place."
>Private thoughts
*But, y'know... I would need someone to come with me. These festivities are always better when you have someone to enjoy them with.*

*... At least that's what I've been told.*
>As an opponent
"There would be no losers in this battle. But if you asked me who would win more... I would have to say the audience."
>As a teacher
"Hmm... her philosophy rubs me off the wrong way, but that's just my ego speaking. I'm sure I could learn a lot from her."

#### Jian
>As a person
"We've met. She's not a bad person, she's just... troubled."
>Private thoughts
*Maybe Zhuque could purify that sword of hers? I'll try it if we meet again.*
>As an opponent
"I'd rather not, and I'm pretty sure she's on the same page."
>As a teacher
"I don't want to put more on her plate."

#### Mei Lan
>As a person
"There are various truths in the world, and none of them are better than one another. I chose my Tao because it suits me the most, but sometimes, I have to take in the teachings preached by other sects to adapt into something new."

"However, I can't see myself ever following her path. I can't become stronger by being subservient to another. Still, it's clearly working wonders for her, which is impressive."
>Private thoughts
*Man... I wish I had a cute maid to help my cultivation. I bet I could finally break to Grade 5 with that kind of support.*
>As an opponent
"She wouldn't accept a challenge unless I did something scummy to provoke her, and I'm not that kind of person, so... it is what it is."
>As a teacher
"Again, I can't see myself following her path."

#### Wen Lifen
>As a person
"She's from that family of... uh... courtesans and gamblers, right? They're built for the current era, just like me."

"Some people say they hate gamblers, but life itself is a gamble, especially for a cultivator. I understand this after getting future sight. The Wen clan also gets it, and they use Fever along with high stakes to gain control."
>Private thoughts
*I know about Luck. I know about Fate. And I know about the Tao Heart that manipulates those two.*

*So I can't hate someone who bets big, even if they don't succeed... or are from a devil sect.*

*A~hahaha... look at me... looking down on others because I managed to leave my prison. I guess it's the privilege of the lucky in action.*
>As an opponent
"It would be fun, but not very productive."
>As a teacher
"I doubt she would accept someone outside her clan. Or let me go once I felt I learned enough."

#### Lei Daiyu
>As a person
"Fascinating. Her musicianship, her way of life, her heroism... we've never met, but I'm already a fan!"

"A~haha... I'm getting off-track. She's one of the few people with the potential to reach the heavenly throne. But I still think I could make it before her."
>Private thoughts
*I like someone with a nice smile, but I have the feeling she wouldn't like me if we did meet.*

*It's a shame, but I'm not too upset. I knew what awaited me when I decided to use the All-Devouring Dharmadhatu.*
>As an opponent
"A challenge I can immerse myself in."
>As a teacher
"This is kind of embarrassing to admit... but I'd rather learn a string instrument."

#### Xu
>As a person
"Never heard of him, which should be weird for someone of his strength, but apparently it isn't. There are tons of old people who shut themselves away and come back to the world after cultivating for centuries. I think it's lame, but to each their own."
>As an opponent
"Extremely unfun. I'd die."
>As a teacher
"Risky but rewarding. But is the reward worth the risk?"

#### Zhihao Cheng
>As a person
"I'd call him and his entire sect worthless if their theory wasn't on the mark. But as things stand, he's a cripple with a key to revolutionizing the current era. Good for him!"
>Private thoughts
*Even though his techniques worked, I doubt he can spread them far enough, considering how the Heavens punished him.*
>As an opponent
"Boring."
>As a teacher
"Boring."

#### Chenrezig Bodhisattva
>As a person
"... Is that really what enlightenment looks like?"
>As an opponent
"I'm sure she would come up with something clever for my punishment, even though my soul is as pure as it can be."
>As a teacher
"A~hahahahaha!"
