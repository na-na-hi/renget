Unfortunately, the nature of 4chan results in disruptive users that would otherwise be purged from any other community being given free reign on most threads. You can try and report them, but these reports often go unanswered. The following types of behaviour are listed for your convienience. When you see it, do not reply to it. Do not take any words they say with any value because all they are doing is trying to get you upset

#Terms:
Whines/whinefag/A whine: People who intentionally shit up the thread by following certain styles cemented by one particular dedicated autist. We'll randomly call people who exhibit these behaviors "whinefag" because its an easy monkier, but understand that each whine is a different person. There is some debate whether the original whinefag is paying these "Whines" to act on his behalf. This is unconfirmed.

#Lists of behavior

## Raging for no reason
This can take the place of using slurs/derogatory language in a sudden or "out of the blue" method, ala what normies think 4chan is completely full of. Its designed to hurt you and make you want to respond. Don't.
## Ridiculous arguments
This form is to generate an argument that is completely pointless to the rest of the thread, and is designed to make you think that denizens of the thread are the kind of chucklefucks who enjoy these arguments.
##Wasting time by sending you into "Are we their yet" tier loops
This is a rare form of trolling, it's usually shown as the words "Can you show me", to ask you to provide proof of a matter. Asking for proof once is not a whine behaviour but continuing to pretend that they don't understand something is classic Whine psychology warfare.

##trying to enshrine themselves as legitimate thread personalities ala anti-southern
This is a tricky one. At one point in the thread we had several "Thread personalities" who distinguished themselves by having a gimmick (such as posting a fox girl, posting a loli, posting about Warhammer 40k, etc. We still have some of these posters left, but in their place, whines will create "anti-personalities" as a bizarre method of protest that only exist to attention whore and waste time, as opposed to the original personalities that made the threads special

#What you should do when you encounter a whine.
**DO NOT REPLY TO THEM**. Ignore them, and if you can, report them for low-quality/trolling/etc.
