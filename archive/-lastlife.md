-> **OO1**. do not call us helen/any variation.
♡ ♡ ♡
**OO2**. if you have introjects of us, please tell us!!
we can further go over boundaries in DMs.
♡ ♡ ♡
**OO3**. do not assume **anything** about us. if
you need clarification or have questions, ask us.
whether it'd be in DMS or in a server ticket.
we'd gladly explain stuff if need be!
♡ ♡ ♡
**OO4**. we are 420 neutral, but rather not
have it talked about in front of us / near us. 
♡ ♡ ♡
**OO5**. if you block us, we will block you
back. don't complain when you blocked us
first. think of it as block for block. <-
