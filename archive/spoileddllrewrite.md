**Mark**: We have some breaking news tonight as we have uncovered more information about the latest "Sonic.exe stabbing" that happened which killed two people and injured one. Perpetrator Amanda Rich was recently found dead in her bedroom last night by her mother due to a self inflicted slash to the neck, with multiple cuts on her arms forming the letter X over and over again. Her PC showed something in Notepad which said "I did it for you, X". It is currently unknown who this X individual is. We now go live to our interview session with the injured victim who has made a full recovery and has been released into her home once again. Daphne?

**Daphne**: Thank you, Mark. Now, before we continue with this interview, what's your name?

**Alix**: Alix Hayes, thank you.

**Daphne**: Right, we're just going to ask you a couple questions related to the stabbing. First off, what were Amanda's behaviors before the incident?

**Alix**: To be honest with you, she was quiet even before everything. Until one day at lunch, she just sat there and stared at her tray, murmuring something about an "X" to herself.

**Daphne**: Is this "X" related to this supposed Sonic.exe thing on the internet?

**Alix**: I've done some research and I guess according to a wiki I found, it's his real name or something.

**Daphne**: I see. Next question, seeing as you have experienced just about everything related to the murders, can you describe to me in detail what exactly happened as you are an eyewitness?

**Alix**: Yes I can. One night, Amanda invited us all to a group chat and just said "Do you want to play a game?" and nothing else. She then texted me to meet me deep in the forest next week at the time. Obviously my worst choice, but I'm here so yeah. I walked in the forest and apparently she killed a lot of animals which formed a trail or something. Still never getting those images out my head. And then I saw her at the end of the forest and she just turns around and says "Hello, do you want to play with me?", and then she comes up and stabs me many times in the chest. Somehow I survived, but it's probably because she missed my heart and I called the ambulance fast. You might already know what happened to the other two.

**Daphne**: Yes, that we found them dead at an abandoned factory and an old castle. Do you have anything else to say on this situation?

**Alix**: Not too much, just that if you think a Creepypasta character is controlling your every move, you might need to see a mental doctor or a therapist.

**Daphne**: Right, and is that all you need to say on this?

**Alix**: Yeah, it's all good now. Thanks for having me on here, Daphne.

**Daphne**: You too, Alix. Back to you, Mark.

**Mark**: Thanks, Daphne. Parents and guardians, please do keep a very close eye on your child while scrolling through the internet. You may not know whether or not they're following orders of a character that doesn't exist in real life. Now on the local weath-
