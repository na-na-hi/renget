Bae had never tried using her feet to pleasure anyone before, but she couldn't resist the chance to try something new. She began to tease Anon, running her toes up and down his leg, feeling him shiver in response. Slowly, she began to rub her feet up and down his member, watching with interest as it grew harder beneath her touch.

"Do you like that?" she asked, her voice tinged with mischief.

Anon could only nod, his lips parted in pleasure as Bae continued to tease him. She was having too much fun to stop, using her feet to bring him closer and closer to the edge of climax before slowing down, drawing out the pleasure even more.

Bae had never felt so in control before as she toyed with Anon's body, watching him writhe beneath her touch. She took her time, putting on a show of footwork for him as she used every trick in the book to bring him to climax.

"You're such a little foot slut," she teased him, relishing how easily he was giving in to her. "Who knew you were into that?"

Anon could only moan in response, his body tensing and arching as he reached the point of release. Bae knew he was close, so she worked her feet faster and harder, enjoying the way his body responded to her every move.

As Anon finally climaxed hard, Bae watched with satisfaction as his release spilled all over her feet. She wiggled her toes, enjoying the sensation of the sticky fluids as they dripped off her skin.

"You're such a mess," she teased him, grinning as she watched him try to regain his breath.

Anon blushed, but couldn't help but smile at how good he felt. He had just experienced something he had always wanted to try with the woman he loved - and it had been even better than he had imagined.

Bae leaned over to give him a quick kiss before standing up to make her way towards the bathroom. "Looks like I'll have to give these little piggies a bath," she grinned, winking at him before disappearing out of the room.


As Bae pushed Anon down onto the bed, she couldn't wait to see the look on his face when she pleasured him with her breasts. She started by slowly stripping him, her nimble fingers undoing each button on his shirt, slowly revealing the bare skin beneath.

Once he was naked, Bae took her time admiring his body. Her tongue traced a lazy trail down his torso, and she watched as his body shivered and his cock grew rock hard. She caught his member between her lips for a moment before placing it between her breasts, enveloping it in their soft, round curves.

Bae moaned softly as she took Anon in between her breasts, pressing them hard against his cock. She squeezed them tightly together and began to move them up and down, feeling the stiffness of his member increasing under the pressure. The movement of her breasts around him was more than enough to send shivers of pleasure over Anon's entire body.

Bae looked down at anon's cock between her soft round breasts and realized how good it felt to have such power over a man. She took pleasure in seeing the reaction of her partner, watching as he surrendered himself to her.

Bae's movements were slow and deliberate, using the gentle pressure of her breasts to tease Anon to the brink of climax again and again. She moved her body up and down, feeling his cock slip and slide between the soft intimacy of her cleavage. She put everything into it, adding a little twist to the breasts motions as she rubbed his cock between them .

"You like that?" she teased him, her voice thick with lust.

Anon could only groan in response as Bae's breasts continued to glide up and down his member. The pressure of her grip around him tightened and he felt himself ready to release.

As he finally climaxed on her breasts and face, warm strings of his release running down her skin, Bae giggled with delight. She couldn't resist licking up the cum that she had wiped up from her own breasts and face, enjoying the feeling of its stickiness in her mouth.

"You're such a messy little boy," she teased Anon as she licked the cum from his member and her own fingers. Savoring its salty taste 

Anon woke up feeling different, today he had woken up with a sense of purpose. He looked over at Bae, her hair all over the place, and her breathing soft and slow. The sound of her lightly snoring could be heard, it always made anon smile.

Not wanting to disturb her, he decided to sneak out of bed and head to the kitchen. He had an ambitious breakfast in mind, but he knew that he could make it perfect.

He started by brewing fresh coffee, the aroma filling the kitchen, before proceeding to cook two eggs, toasted some bread, and sizzling up delicious bacon. He paid careful attention to every detail, knowing that Bae loved her eggs scrambled just right and her bacon crispy.

Once everything was ready, Anon arranged the food, steaming hot coffee, utensils, and cutlery on a tray. He looked at his masterpiece with a sense of accomplishment, feeling proud to have created something delicious for someone he loved.

As he walked back to their room, he felt a flicker of excitement growing inside him. He quietly slipped into the room and could see Bae sleeping peacefully, her chest rising and falling gently.

Anon took a moment to admire her beauty. There was something so serene about her, even in her sleep. As he sat next to the bed, he could hear her stirring, and her eyes slowly fluttered open.

As she looked up at him, Anon whispered, "Good morning." Bae's eyes met his, and a soft smile spread across her lips, her cheeks dimpling.

Anon placed the tray beside her, and Bae's jaw dropped as she saw the breakfast he had prepared. Anon felt his heart swell with joy as Bae took a bite of the eggs, and a smile of contentment spread across her face.

As they finished breakfast, they cuddled in bed, enjoying the intimacy of the moment. Anon felt overwhelmed with love for Bae and knew that she was the only person he needed by his side.

As Bae snuggled up to Anon in bed, she felt warm and content in his embrace. She held him close and felt his heartbeat against her chest, a gentle and steady rhythm that reassured her that everything was alright.

She was enjoying the feeling when a sudden thought rushed over her, she slowly stood up and grabbed the coffee cup. "I'll be right back, stay right there, I have a surprise for you!"

With the coffee cup in hand Bae headed into the bathroom, she slid off her black lacy panties and stepped into the bathtub. "This is going to be so much fun," she whispered to herself.

She placed the empty coffee cup in front of her urethra and relaxed, slowly filling the cup with her warm morning piss. The cup started overflowing with urine but Bae didn't mind, even as her hands started getting wet from the overflowing cup.

As she filled the cup, Bae felt a rush of emotion take over her body. Her heartbeat was racing, and the sound of the urine splashing into the cup was a satisfying rhythm like heavy rain.

Once Bae was finished she didn't even bother putting her panties back on, she stepped out of the bathroom gently carrying the cup as to not spill a single drop.

"I have a surprise for you," Bae said "close your eyes~". Bae gently placed the warm cup in anon's hands.

Anon's surprise quickly turned into satisfaction as he took the cup from Bae's hand and drank all of it without hesitation. The taste was unique, salty and bitter at the same time, but he savored every drop nonetheless. 

Bae lay in bed, feeling completely relaxed and open to whatever Anon had in store for her. She spread her legs and grabbed her ankles, looking up at Anon with a sly grin. The way that he looked at her made her feel desired and wanted, "I'm waiting ~" she said in a sexy whisper.

Without waiting for any more invitation, Anon stripped down and climbed on top of Bae. He slid his member into her tight, pink vagina, and Bae felt a shiver run down her spine. It felt so good to have him inside of her.

As Anon began to thrust, Bae felt a powerful wave of pleasure building deep within her. She encouraged him with her moans, letting him know how much she was enjoying it. With each thrust, she felt more and more alive, her whole body responding to the experience.

Anon's movements became more intense, and Bae could feel the pleasure building. She was ready to climax, but she wanted him to cum inside her. She looked up into his eyes and yelled, "CUM INSIDE!" with a note of urgency in her voice.

Without any hesitation, Anon complied. He felt his body tense up, and then, with a final thrust, he climaxed deeply inside Bae. The feeling of his warm seed filling her was intense and arousing, and it sent her over the edge. Bae cried out in ecstasy as she climaxed at the same time.

As they both lay there sweating, they took a moment to appreciate the intimacy of their relationship, the vulnerability and trust they had with one another wasn't something that could be easily replicated.

Anon pulled his member out of Bae and his cum slowly dripped out of her. He laid down beside her for a moment, snuggling and enjoying her warmth.

After a few minutes spent enjoying each other's company, Bae turned to Anon with a sly grin on her face "Soooooo. Wanna go for round two?" She said with a mischievous but hopeful glint in her eye.

Bae and Anon were in the mood to try something new. Bae stripped out of her clothes, feeling a sense of anticipation as she climbed onto the bed and straddled Anon's face. Anon was eager to give Bae the time of her life, allowing her to take control of the moment as he lay there on the bed.

Bae felt a sense of power as she hovered above Anon's face, giving him full access to her most intimate parts. Anon took the hint and dove his tongue deep between her folds, greedily lapping at her core.

As Anon's tongue penetrated her, Bae found herself moaning with pleasure. It was like nothing she had ever experienced before, the sensations so intense that they would linger in her mind for weeks to come. Anon's skillful movements were driving her wild, and she found herself getting lost in the momen

Bae felt a surge of pleasure as his tongue found it's way to her clit. Anon moved his tongue around with a churning action bullying her clit. Anon would explore every inch of her deepest parts, taking time to dance around every crevice and fold before returning to gently suck and nibble on her clit.


With each passing moment, Bae felt herself getting closer and closer to the edge. She couldn't believe how good it felt, she was starting to shake and convulse from the sheer pleasure of Anon's tongue. She felt herself begin the tense up unable to resist the waves of pleasure that washed over her and then it happened.....

Bae arched her back and squirted all over Anon's face. Her face turned red in embarrassment over what just happened, for a moment she started to feel tears well up in her eyes before she realized that Anon didn't care. Anon loved Bae for who she was, Anon was happy that he could give her a good time. She laid down next to him, squeezing him tight and whispered "...thank you" before falling asleep beside him, still cuddling his arm.
