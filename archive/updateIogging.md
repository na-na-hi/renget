ã…¤
-> **4/1/2024** :â€‚I did a few touchups to make some of
the info easier to read , and I've put the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive into a
[s](https://rentry.co/archivingly)eparate rentry , so that it's easier to look at on the eyes *!* <-
ã…¤

-> **31/12/2023** :â€‚finally finished putting everything in
the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive today *!* ^^ <-
ã…¤

-> **31/12/2023** :â€‚I decided to archive less resources mainly
because it was really exhausting , so I've removed everything
in the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive section that I haven't archived yet ^^; however ,
I still managed to archive a lot for you guys *!* :D I will be planning
to archive a few more pixel resources , just before the update as
well >:D ( I keep saving so many pixels in my files it's insane LOL ) <-
ã…¤

-> **29/12/2023** :â€‚added lots of laces in the [l](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#lace)ace section , and
added invites to the servers in the [d](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#discord-servers)iscord servers section ,
but the descriptions of the servers are still a work in progress *!*
I also fully set up the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive , and so far I've successfully
archived [ashepixels](https://rentry.co/ashepixels) entirely and almost completely
archived everything on [cielpixels](https://rentry.co/cielpixels) too *!* ^^ <-
ã…¤

-> **27/12/2023** :â€‚finally ensured that every [t](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#rentry-templates)emplate with
discord links is still usuable with the [**+**]() symbol addition *!* :D
( it's soon gonna be time for me to archive every single site
in the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive section ðŸ˜­... SEND HELP PLEASE LOL ) <-
ã…¤

-> **25/12/2023** :â€‚IT'S ALMOST TOMORROW *!* but somehow I
managed to go on a graphic making spree while I'm still trying
to stay awake for 24 hours so...... ðŸ˜­ WELL I HOPE YOU GUYS
ENJOY LOL...... I added lots of stuff [h](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#made-by-me)ere :D <-
ã…¤

-> **25/12/2023** :â€‚I added new [t](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#tips)ips , and sections for
[l](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#lace)ace , [o](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#overlays)verlays , and [d](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#discord-servers)iscord servers *!* I also made a new
graphic with frames in the [m](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#made-by-me)ade by me section , and a few
more f2u graphics [h](https://postimg.cc/gallery/Ny3grxr/79dbe7e4)ere , but those function as examples
for the tips I added as well *!* <-

this collection of resources I've compiled , it just makes me
really really happy ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’— when I think about this actually
being helpful to someone , I feel so motivated to try my best
to make it even more useful for you guys *!* :') I hope everyone

you're doing amazing *!!* :D I added and went over lots of
things today ( my sleep schedule has never been this
insane LOL ) , I hope you guys enjoy them *!* ^^ <-
ã…¤

-> **24/12/2023** :â€‚( thinking of making the archive section
in a separate rentry , so the [m](https://rentry.co/roses-resources)ain resources one loads
faster as well *!* ^^ ) <-
ã…¤

-> **24/12/2023** :â€‚figured out how to more efficiently archive
for the [a](https://rentry.co/roses-resources#archive)rchive section , so I'll be sure to archive everything I've
listed .. but also sort them in the same way , too *!* <-
ã…¤

-> **19/10/2023** :â€‚planning to add a link to my personal
symbol stash , once it's organized *!* <-
ã…¤

random things I've edited that can hopefully be useful too *!* <-
ã…¤

-> **12/09/2023** :â€‚listed some apps and websites for
