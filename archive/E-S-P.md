Character concept: someone skilled in mental manipulation for various ends.
Being a Tenshi alone tends to make individuals follow you around, Max Charisma does what it says, Bardism for believable backstories, false memories, and mastery over eliciting responses from others, Beast Mastery at higher tiers lets one control sentient creatures, and Light to cap it all off with a tier one ability brought to tier one power level. If you can soothe a mind at tier one what can you do when you can crank more magic into it? Combined with the other abilities mentioned above?

Her current vessel and generally preferred body type. Considers herself to be the reason Euthymia followed the path of a mind controller and happily throws herself at him to be his playground. He actually believes it's his fault for her bizarrely obsessive nature and is trying to make her normal again. Even though he may never make any progress, the quiet moments do grant some peace of mind to both...
