# The フギミ LoRA Collection - Furryrock

This Rentry serves as an easier way to preview the [LoRAs I have uploaded to MEGA](https://mega.nz/folder/2FlygZLC#ZsBLBv4Py3zLWHOejvF2EA). Anything linked below can also be found through this main link. ==Only a .safetensors file is needed to use any LoRA==. Extra info can be found in the metadata or other files provided alongside the .safetensors file.

## Additional Notes

- I use [Regional Prompter](https://github.com/hako-mikan/sd-webui-regional-prompter#latent)'s "latent" generation setting to generate these previews, activating a single region by adding a BREAK at the end of the prompt. Previously I used [Composable LoRA](https://github.com/opparco/stable-diffusion-webui-composable-lora), but it was abandoned and the [newer fork]() ~~does not function the same~~ has also been abandoned. Be careful if you also use this method, adding more breaks or having a LoRA outside of the BREAK will have weird effects.
- If you would like to support me making LoRAs and/or make a request, you can do so on [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hoogyme)
