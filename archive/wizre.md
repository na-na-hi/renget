Stripper bf by anon

>you had been dating for some time now, but you already felt some kind of connection
>you'd met each other at a local furry strip club, going there on a whim when your usual joint was closed for remodeling
>and my god, you were thankful for that french fry vat exploding in the back when someone forgot to turn the oil off before closing up, you never would have met *him* if it weren't for that poor poor part-timer's mistake
>Logan
>he was the star of the male dancer clique, with a clientele lined up to see him longer than the average rapsheet of someone in the area living there
>you'd go every weeknight to see him, a crowd surrounding the tiger as he did his routine, but it never got old for you, watching him majestically twist, turn, lift, wiggle, spin and even thrust his body on stage
>he notices you again amongst the sea of fans as you watch him once more tonight
>he'd always had an eye for you, not that you were the only human there, but he seemed drawn to you and you alone
>after his routine he ushered you to the vip section amidst a sea of cries of others begging and pleading to book him, some of the numbers being offered as his pay making you dizzy from how many more times they were higher than yours
>shutting the door behind him, he leads you to a boxing ring in the middle of a room
>you raise an eyebrow at this, but he sighs and waves his hand 
>"It's a monthly theme thing, I think it's dumb too. Supposed to be "Lover's Wrestling", when really I want to give a "Lover's Chokehold" to some of the people I have to be here with." 
>you share a laugh, standing at opposite ends of the ring, you decide to poke fun a bit more 
>"You're a cute kitty though, I beat I can beat you in a wrestling match while surviving one of your fluffy "chokehold" hugs"
>he gets visibly angry at this, his body tending up, you could swear you could see steam come out of his nostrils
>"Hmph, really? You're on then, I'm going to make you my bitch right now!"
>his footwork was immaculate, almost as if he was gliding towards you
>you raise your guard, unsure as to whether he'll lunge at you or tackle you down
>instead he goes for your legs, picking you up on both sides of your thighs and carrying you like a baby before throwing you onto the mat
>the cushion made sure you didn't suffer any injury but the wind was definitely knocked out of you, as you take a second to try and get up from all fours you feel his fuzzy arms lock together around your neck, and that all too familiar singsongy voice you've come to know and love calls out
>"Gotcha, bitch~"
>you feel the back of his underwear rub up against your buttocks, he was clearly very pleased with the current situation if his rock hard erection was anything to go by 
>"How about we sweat it out for a bit? I could use some relaxation~"
>you rub his arms, his hold on you wasn't tight, in fact you liked how it felt, almost as if he was a big warm scarf around you
>"Here? Really? If I'm a bitch, you're a horny bitch." 
>Logan scoffs and rubs his paws against your face. 
>"Can you blame me? I've been waiting all day for you to come see me, it's the only enjoyable part of my day."
>You smile warmly, even if he can't see it. His sincerity was always like a second wind whenever you were upset
>You begin to undo your belt and pants, your body position letting the clothing easily slide off, underwear soon following
>"Go get 'er tiger~"
>"Oh shut up you" is his reply, before you feel his barbed member pressing into you
>God it never fails to make you tingle, but in a good way
>The unique feature of his length made you appreciate him all the more, having tried dildoes of multiple species, you found feline the best 
>as Logan got into it more he began making feral noises, tiger instincts of dominating and breeding his partner awakening in him 
>you two fucked all night, and decide to spend the night at his house to shower and cuddle
>you didn't mind, he was all worth it
