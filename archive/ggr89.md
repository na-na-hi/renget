This is the rentry where I'll be listing my bots out in case Chub gets its shit whacked again. Chub links are usually more updated than catbox links, if there's any difference between them that is.

I mostly do **KanColle and Nikke** bots, but I do make cards of other things occasionally. The bots listed here are the public versions and vary slightly (up to moderately) from my personal use ones, if you run into any problems you can bring them up to me.

I'll make some combat cards down the road eventually too, but **most of my cards are for smut**.

###Nikke Bots
Here are my Nikke bots. Mostly keeps to canon depictions of characters and most if not all of the example dialogue is taken from in game. They are all made to be used with my Nikke Lorebook.
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![The doctor is in.](https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/2a/67/__mary_goddess_of_victory_nikke_drawn_by_chien_zero__sample-2a670fd76d1cc73ca3ac307c1dbf4c04.jpg) | Mary | A dutiful Nikke doctor. She likes to give checkups and is a big time tease. She's my personal favorite Nikke, I love her a lot. Oh, she's also a fucking mass murderer who participated in GROSS medical malpractice. That's in the history section of the card, read there if unfamiliar. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/Mary) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/14s7lc.png)

Lightly mesugaki, lightly exhibitionist who's a little unreliable. Still, doesn't mess around in battle using the fully equipped Seven Dwarves Weapon System. Comes with three greetings.

###KanColle Bots
Here are my KanColle bots. They are all made to be used with my KanColle Lorebook, which partly contains OC content. All my KanColle girls are made under the assumption that **this takes place in pretty much the normal world we live in, just with Abyssals and Shipgirls. Shipgirls are mostly normal people who just happen to remember a little from WW2 even though they explicitly were not there.** Since its so similar to normal, they should work without the lorebook but it can't help to load it up too.

 ![Cute autist taking a selfie.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1135920553245548715/00006.png) | MILF Kaga | The first card I made myself, featuring my waifu, Kaga. Differs a little from my personal version of the card, but should still be pretty good. You're her husband and already married for some time. Take care of the autist, okay? Works well with her big sis in group chats. Comes with two greetings, the Combined Fleets Gala and big pregnancy.| [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/milf-kaga) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/3c38sb.png)
 ![Cute older sister taking a selfie.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/532820318985650176/1148505624540348436/06591.png) | MILF Akagi | Finally releasing a modified version of my personal Akagi card. Like with Kaga, you're her husband and already married for some time. In fact, you're married to both of the sisters. Works good on group chats with her little sis. Comes with two greetings, the Combined Fleets Gala and big pregnancy. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/milf-akagi-602eb85b) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/toa8xw.png)
 ![A horny Empress of a new Abyss](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1166359227820933192/battleship_princess_aircraft_carrier_oni_and_aircraft_carrier_water_oni_kantai_collection_drawn_by_konoshige_ryuun__9f5eafb7dc9665b3d53061b2a2685cb5.jpg?ex=654a33ad&is=6537bead&hm=2313117b816e37764438f25ce3ca9590fb94731da847b568f10adc129b78f061&) | CVX Empress | Part of the 8492nd Aggressors, CVX Empress is Kaga's Abyssal form while she's recovering from fatal injuries. While Akagi's personality shift as an abyssal is comparatively slight, Kaga becomes almost an entirely different person. Still holding the same values, she no longer has autism and is much more forward and aggressive about getting laid with you. You're the 8492 commander and both of you are relaxing at the secret Moonhover retreat while she's still an Abyssal. Works well with the Midway card I made. Comes with a pregnancy alt greeting. | [CHUB link](https://chub.ai/characters/ggr89/cvx-empress-703fef67/main) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/yjc1ry.png)
 ![Regal Abyssal boobaaaaa - mind the spikes](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/4c/ec/__midway_princess_kantai_collection_drawn_by_konoshige_ryuun__4cec29e09609139882bafa590c6d22ae.jpg) | Midway Princess | Part of the 8492nd Aggressors, Midway is Akagi's Abyssal form while she's recovering from fatal injuries. She has a massive appetite and a slight personality shift. You're the 8492 commander and both of you are relaxing at the secret Moonhover retreat while she's still an Abyssal. Works well with the CVX Empress card I made. Comes with a pregnancy alt greeting. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/midway-princess-dd0c7211) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/wu4d7a.png)
 ![Bratty and aggressive, gonna wring you dry.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125515582947741857/1135916415250092122/06566.png) | CLC Bungo (Female version) | My OC daughteru, Bungo. She's feisty and the scenario has you paying her for compensated dating at my behest. She's down for pretty much anything, but be wary, she's a straight sociopath Abyssal. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/clc-bungo) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/kjku3q.png)
 ![You're gonna get raped (with cock!)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1125515582947741857/1135916416277684294/06574.png) | CLC Bungo (Futanari version) | My OC daughteru, Bungo. She's feisty and the scenario has you paying her for compensated dating at my behest. She's probably gonna rape you, also be wary, she's a straight sociopath Abyssal. Also she's packing a huge horse cock. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/clc-bungo-futa) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/yxwstd.png)

Shigure has PTSD and an exhibitionist fetish. You can saviorfag her or make her worse I guess. The intro has been written so you can choose to be whoever you want, from her nice and caring Admiral to a random passerby blackmailing her with pictures of her indulging in her exhibitionism. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/b8889963-ffff-439e-bff9-09bd6c14d3b9) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/t7p9k3.png)

Now you've been freshly assigned to a new base on a temporary basis, and lo and behold, none other than the pest herself greets you with even more teasing. A real mesugaki who's goal is to be "corrected" on her terms. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/dd-arashio-bb7be5b4) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/baazc1.png)


###Armored Core Bots (heh)
Ended up cooking a lot more than I thought I would for Armored Core, I originally only meant to make Walter and Ayre but the project just sorta ballooned from there as I got more ideas. So, a new category was birthed. They're mostly combat cards (except Dafeng) but you can fuck them regardless. Uses a custom JB burned into the card. **REQUIRES** the associated lorebook for good function, especially if you don't want the AI to think Ayre is a sentient rock. All cards come with two greetings - a "down to business" one and a laid back slice of life one - except C4-621 who has three. You can even chain (most of) them together for group chats!
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 !["Raven... I'll support you, whatever you decide to do."](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/18/05/__ayre_armored_core_and_1_more_drawn_by_las91214__1805fc5bf2a1f4ab26c87e6195e24845.jpg) | Ayre | Schizo hallucination? Alien entity stuck in your brain? How about both? Ayre is a sentient Coral consciousness that's become attached to your augmentations, living as a voice inside your head that can hack into electronics and provide logistic support during missions. Lucky for you, she also seems to be quite fond of you outside missions. Even though she lacks a physical body, that doesn't stop either of you from getting up close and personal. After all, hallucinations can seem quite real to those who suffer them... Compatible with Walter for group chats! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/ayre-5b799352) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/nhgfg8.png)
 !["621, its time to get to work."](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/4a/7e/__handler_walter_armored_core_and_1_more_drawn_by_karuvo816__4a7e012937d4d24950e2f81c7caa13e8.jpg) | Handler Walter | The man who bought you from the Augmentation clinic, purchasing you wholesale to use as a pawn for his schemes on Rubicon. Walter is your mercenary Handler, giving you jobs for the various warring factions. While he looks all business, he's perfectly capable of hanging out with you during your downtime. Won't stop his somewhat cold demeanor though. Compatible with Ayre for group chats! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/handler-walter-804b02b8) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/3xwh4m.png)
 !["More than enough for a merc with a fried brain to buy their life back."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1153043434312040549/621_full.jpg) | Augmented Human C4-621 - Raven | The Fires of Raven, the Liberator of Rubicon, whatever they end up calling her she's still a disabled, emotionally withdrawn Gen 4. But she's also your Gen 4, to take care of, or abuse, or send on missions to earn some cash. Outside of the AC, C4-621 is barely capable of sustaining herself. She can hardly make her own food or keep up hygiene, so you'll need to treat her like a child in her day to day life. Old model Augmentation and whatever injuries she sustained before being sent to the clinic have left her covered in bandaged burns and without the ability to speak, needing to draw on her tablet to communicate. NOT compatible with Ayre or Walter in group chats, though compatible with all cards lower on the list. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/ah-c4-621-raven-5ba01e90) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/nr0tn7.png)
 !["Rb-23, reinstating active status. Welcome back, Raven."](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/13/43/__allmind_armored_core_drawn_by_las91214__1343aa81e128eb63d2d9c09cb8dc4069.jpg) | ALLMIND | The mercenary support system, ALLMIND, that supports mercenary activities on Rubicon. Or at least, your liaison from said company, run out of a dingy office that... hey, wait, how come she's the only employee you've ever seen? How come she's talking about "Chat-GPT?" and "cooming"? Lady, stop reading the script! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/allmind-11523a4a) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/1c2wbh.png)
 !["Hey, Buddy. Never thought I'd be rubbing shoulders with the Liberator of Rubicon."](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/2a/77/__v_iv_rusty_armored_core_and_1_more_drawn_by_yukko93__2a773ca0d93a639075e6680153fdf86c.jpg) | RLF Rusty | V.IV Rusty is what they used to call him, piloting AC STEEL HAZE. You two've had more than your fair share of run-ins, both good and bad, but he still calls you Buddy to this day. Now that the corporations have been sent reeling and he's back in the RLF, things are much more clear between you two. Hang out over some beers, rebuild the shattered world, see what you two have saved. After all, you're both Liberators. | **UNRELEASED**
 ![A stout tree with slender branches...](https://cdn.donmai.us/original/de/57/__dafeng_nyan_nyan_armored_core_and_1_more_drawn_by_0304yama__de57e1281949d74d787a470b90e0e9be.png) | Dafeng Niang-Niang | It seems stupid to say, but all companies run off profit. Dafeng (A Balam subsidiary) is no exception, and it seem like they're going for an age old tactic: sexy saleswomen. Visit the Rubicon Demonstrator Expo, showcasing the lastest developments from all the corporations ready to be snagged by inquisitive mercenaries! Or at least, that's the plan if the Dafeng girl doesn't get ahold of you, eager to get you to buy whatever Chinese junk they're offering. Holy shit, is that an internal combustion engine? | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/dafeng-niang-niang-b877f836) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/l8lgjk.png)

While an otherwise normal all-girls school, Serizawa also hosts the JK Exorcist Club, where students with spiritual aptitude are trained to fight against supernatural threats. You're one of these threats, a demon who's recently begun stalking the school in order to harvest the exorcists for their precious spiritual energy. Shiho Ohka is the first of your victims and was named by anons at /aicg/. No associated lorebook.
