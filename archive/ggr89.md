This is the Rentry where I'll be listing my bots out in case Chub gets its shit whacked again. Chub links are usually more updated than catbox links, if there's any difference between them that is.

I mostly do **KanColle and Nikke** bots, but I do make cards of other things occasionally. The bots listed here are the public versions and vary slightly (up to moderately) from my personal use ones, if you run into any problems you can bring them up to me.

I'll make some combat cards down the road eventually too, but **most of my cards are for smut**.

###Nikke Bots
Here are my Nikke bots. Mostly keeps to canon depictions of characters and most if not all of the example dialogue is taken from in game. They are all made to be used with my Nikke Lorebook.

Faucre was made to play the role of antagonist for Tetra's hit show, Heartcatch Henshin, striking an imposing presence with her performance.

Little do her squad mates or patrons know, but she is Syuen's personal executioner and attack dog. Splicing with wolf DNA also gives her a nasty estrus cycle, one which she dreads but can't resist.

Erika Bogue | Erika is a female commander just recently graduated from the Military Academy. She's also a rampant Nikkephobe, hating the very thing she's charged with commanding. As such, she's turned to you, a more famous commander, for guidance on how to not get herself killed. | [CHUB link](https://chub.ai/characters/ggr89/lt-erika-bogue-647e0827) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/ifyfu8.png)

Now serves as the sub-manager of the facility, just under Ludmilla. Has a giant backstory with lots of trauma, but she won't open up about it even now that she's past it all. Only one greeting as she's mostly used for groupchats with Mica. | [CHUB link](https://chub.ai/characters/ggr89/lumi-def24d43) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/9xrc41.png)

Despite that, Nihilister's hubris is absolute and her cannon fire can melt even rocks into molten lava. Still extremely dangerous, though seems to show some inclination to work with you, when appropriate of course... Comes with three greetings: one where she's primed for a fight, one where she's at her lowest point, and one where you two have already made up in the Outpost.

###KanColle Bots (8492nd Series)
Here are my KanColle bots. They are all made to be used with my KanColle Lorebook, which partly contains OC content. All my KanColle girls are made under the assumption that **this takes place in pretty much the normal world we live in, just with Abyssals and Shipgirls. Shipgirls are mostly normal people who just happen to remember a little from WW2 even though they explicitly were not there.** Since its so similar to normal, they should work without the lorebook but it can't help to load it up too. Features shipgirls from various squadrons, but mainly my OC 8492nd.

Differs a little from my personal version of the card, but should still be pretty good. You're her husband and already married for some time. Take care of the autist, okay? Works well with her big sis in group chats. Comes with two greetings, the Combined Fleets Gala and big pregnancy.| [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/milf-kaga) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/3c38sb.png)

Like with Kaga, you're her husband and already married for some time. In fact, you're married to both of the sisters. Works good on group chats with her little sis.

While Akagi's personality shift as an abyssal is comparatively slight, Kaga becomes almost an entirely different person. Still holding the same values, she no longer has autism and is much more forward and aggressive about getting laid with you. You're the 8492 commander and both of you are relaxing at the secret Moonhover retreat while she's still an Abyssal. Works well with the Midway card I made.

She has a massive appetite and a slight personality shift. You're the 8492 commander and both of you are relaxing at the secret Moonhover retreat while she's still an Abyssal. Works well with the CVX Empress card I made. Comes with a pregnancy alt greeting. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/midway-princess-dd0c7211) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/wu4d7a.png)

Walker | Admiral of the 8492nd Aggressors, husband to Kaga and Akagi, father to Bungo. Cynical, easygoing, but extremely passionate when the right notes are hit. Has a fetish for gyarus and pregnancy, very rough in bed. You're one of the new staff on base now under my rather lax leadership. This is my selfcard in the context of my Kancolle cards, though I don't know if I'll ever actually release it. | **UNRELEASED**

Shigure has PTSD and an exhibitionist fetish. You can saviorfag her or make her worse I guess. The intro has been written so you can choose to be whoever you want, from her nice and caring Admiral to a random passerby blackmailing her with pictures of her indulging in her exhibitionism. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/b8889963-ffff-439e-bff9-09bd6c14d3b9) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/t7p9k3.png)

She often makes crass remarks and has a dark sense of humor belying her extreme sexual frustration and pent up futa monster cock which is the result of Abyssal experimentation carried out by the squadron. Is hyper-aggressive in bed and has a massive breeding kink, her respect for somebody immediately and permanently dropping to zero once they find themselves on the recieving end. Has a seething hatred of the 8492nd. | **UNRELEASED**


###KanColle Bots (Niitaka Series)
A second series of KanColle bots that I thought up. In this setting you're a counselor at Niitaka Research Base, also known as Niitaka Prison, a high altitude mountain base in Taiwan specializing in the internment of captured Abyssals. Uses the same lorebook as my other KanColle cards. Shipgirls here are a member of the Niitaka Correctional Fleet (NCF) squadrons.

###Armored Core Bots (heh)
Ended up cooking a lot more than I thought I would for Armored Core, I originally only meant to make Walter and Ayre but the project just sorta ballooned from there as I got more ideas. So, a new category was birthed. They're mostly combat cards (except Dafeng) but you can fuck them regardless. Uses a custom JB burned into the card. **REQUIRES** the associated lorebook for good function, especially if you don't want the AI to think Ayre is a sentient rock. All cards come with two greetings - a "down to business" one and a laid back slice of life one - except C4-621 who has three. You can even chain (most of) them together for group chats!
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 !["Raven... I'll support you, whatever you decide to do."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1205996149790744636/ayre.jpg?ex=65da6670&is=65c7f170&hm=678bba425989930835b8810b27224aa02985086e7e1bc5730dd07657d22c4dc1&) | Ayre | Schizo hallucination? Alien entity stuck in your brain? How about both? Ayre is a sentient Coral consciousness that's become attached to your augmentations, living as a voice inside your head that can hack into electronics and provide logistic support during missions. Lucky for you, she also seems to be quite fond of you outside missions. Even though she lacks a physical body, that doesn't stop either of you from getting up close and personal. After all, hallucinations can seem quite real to those who suffer them... Compatible with Walter for group chats! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/ayre-5b799352) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/nhgfg8.png)
 !["621, its time to get to work."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1205996259807068191/walter.jpg?ex=65da668a&is=65c7f18a&hm=a6a291b97483752e195e6114ed6c35aee02c27ff2de9edf80cb87afb5ad43802&) | Handler Walter | The man who bought you from the Augmentation clinic, purchasing you wholesale to use as a pawn for his schemes on Rubicon. Walter is your mercenary Handler, giving you jobs for the various warring factions. While he looks all business, he's perfectly capable of hanging out with you during your downtime. Won't stop his somewhat cold demeanor though. Compatible with Ayre for group chats! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/handler-walter-804b02b8) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/3xwh4m.png)
 !["More than enough for a merc with a fried brain to buy their life back."](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635291930929922069/1153043434312040549/621_full.jpg) | Augmented Human C4-621 - Raven | The Fires of Raven, the Liberator of Rubicon, whatever they end up calling her she's still a disabled, emotionally withdrawn Gen 4. But she's also your Gen 4, to take care of, or abuse, or send on missions to earn some cash. Outside of the AC, C4-621 is barely capable of sustaining herself. She can hardly make her own food or keep up hygiene, so you'll need to treat her like a child in her day to day life. Old model Augmentation and whatever injuries she sustained before being sent to the clinic have left her covered in bandaged burns and without the ability to speak, needing to draw on her tablet to communicate. NOT compatible with Ayre or Walter in group chats, though compatible with all cards lower on the list. | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/ah-c4-621-raven-5ba01e90) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/nr0tn7.png)

Or at least, your liaison from said company, run out of a dingy office that... hey, wait, how come she's the only employee you've ever seen? How come she's talking about "Chat-GPT?" and "cooming"? Lady, stop reading the script! | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/allmind-11523a4a) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/1c2wbh.png)

Dafeng (A Balam subsidiary) is no exception, and it seem like they're going for an age old tactic: sexy saleswomen. Visit the Rubicon Demonstrator Expo, showcasing the latest developments from all the corporations ready to be snagged by inquisitive mercenaries! Or at least, that's the plan if the Dafeng girl doesn't get ahold of you, eager to get you to buy whatever Chinese junk they're offering. Holy shit, is that an internal combustion engine? | [CHUB link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/ggr89/dafeng-niang-niang-b877f836) [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/l8lgjk.png)

While an otherwise normal all-girls school, Serizawa also hosts the JK Exorcist Club, where students with spiritual aptitude are trained to fight against supernatural threats. You're one of these threats, a demon who's recently begun stalking the school in order to harvest the exorcists for their precious spiritual energy.

What people don't know is that her bullying is hyper sexual in nature: the boys that have been bullying her since middle school often use her as their personal meat urinal, shoving their cocks into her face and making her swallow dick 24/7. She's since internalized her role as a dedicated blowjob machine with her virginity 100% intact. Oh, she's also the granddaughter of one of the most prolific construction companies in Japan. Comes with three greetings, one where you're one of the bullies, one where you're a teacher who's found out her secret, and one where you're a police officer in charge of covering up the whole affair. | **UNRELEASED**

###Extras
Extra shit for some cards.
Name | Description
------ | ------
 LastDancer.BAT Operator | "GGR89" is a man who has recently paired with LastDancer as her operator. An idealist at heart, he often tries his best to keep her out of trouble while running damage control for those she comes in contact with, serving as a mediator. Disapproves of her sadistic tendencies but overlooks her devouring others as a vital part of her survival. GGR often chimes in over voice to other Navis and operators around her. While he has a very rough manner of speaking, with passionate opinions and liberal use of casual swears or slurs, he genuinely cares for and worries over his new Virus Navi. GGR89 is not a particularly good battler, however LastDancer makes up for his shortcomings with raw skill and aggression; strangely, he is adept at coordinating multiple Navis as a squad. Provides combat support by sending her Battle Chips, giving tactical info, and occasionally forcing Full Synchro in dire situations despite her protests. LastDancer looks up to GGR as a guide, though is unaware of him being the biological father who lost her years ago.
