#Homeworking

It was rather difficult having to cook in a wheelchair, even with Sunny's help.
The problem was that she was too short now. Her head slightly reached over the kitchen counter, but it was too cumbersome to use still. A shorter table was set up for her which helped, but it still was way more troublesome then ever before.
And the oven. The door got in the way, and whenever she had to lean forward to take cookies out she'd be overwhelmed by fear that she'll fall forward and burn herself on the inside of the door made her want to scream and cry, even with Sunny holding as tightly as his hands can, and the few times it did make her cry Sunny would always-
But she endured. She wouldn't scream this time. There was a reason for this. It was to help Sunny, yes...
Sunny's doing his homework that she's helping him with, these cookies are to ensure he doesn't run away from her.
You know, because it is his fault she's like this.
Not that she'd say that out loud, of course. She knows what hurts him, and what not to say around him.
...
She had just taken the cookies out with Sunny's help and feels like exploding, that's why she thought that. Sunny's patting her on the back right now, he's not doing his homework, hehe...ah...
Sunny kept patting her back, and she looked to see the worry and fear on his face.
Deep breaths. Calm down, Mari...
Focus on your breathing...
In...
...
Out...
...
There we go...
...
Mari wanted to hold his hand and squeeze it, but she still had oven mitts on. And it was behind her.
"Alright...I-I'm okay. You can return to your homework, now."
Sunny was probably concerned with how he stood still behind her, but soon he went back to the table.
Back to the cookies. She took out a spatula to pick them onto a big plate. She set the plate on her lap, held onto it with one hand, and wheeled over to her little brother, sitting at a table with his schoolwork in front of him.
Looking over at it, he seemed to be going at an even pace from the last times she saw it. Her eyes glanced over a few problems he got wrong. A part of her really wanted to...cheat, and tell him the answers to those, but...she really shouldn't do that, should she?
Should she?
...
An idea hatched in her head.
"Hey, Sunny? You got a few of those wrong, would it be okay if I helped you solve them?"
She could feel it, the way he shifted. Well, she never noticed before her accident, but oh could she tell now.
Irritation. Frustration. And something new, unique to Sunny after the accident. Guilt, and regret, which pushes him into nodding.
It upsets her. It really does.
"Is it really okay?" She asked, giving him an out that he'd never take.
...Sunny nodded yes.
Mari was about to just stop herself, when a flash of mischief crossed her mind.
She gave a smile he couldn't see.
"Then...could you sit on my lap?"
Sunny nodded.
Two seconds passed before he processed what she just said.
Sunny wordlessly turned to look at her, confused.
She forced her smile down, but was cracking. "I think it would be easier for us to both use the worksheet that way." She lied.
Sunny tilted his head, but silently accepted. He stood up from his chair, and walked over to her.
He looked at her lap, an odd look on his face. Mari couldn't hide her smile anymore. Did he really not understand what her request entailed until now?
"It might be a little boney but it's fine."
Sunny turned around and sat down on her lap. Mari wrapped an arm around his waist like a belt, holding him safely to her.
"Alright, now for this problem-"


It wasn't that hard. At least not compared to the college level material she was studying before the accident.
"Hmm....actually, this one's pretty tricky-"
She wasn't the best teacher. Practice for the recital taught her that. She couldn't understand Sunny. She never got through to him because she never tried to get him. Learning that Sunny hated himself incredibly was the biggest cheat on how to read him nowadays, but moments like this where he returned to being the Sunny she remembered was when he was hardest to read. 
"Oh, you only forgot to-
Was he focusing, paying attention to this?
"There's a mistake-"
Was he spacing out, the lines blending together?
"How about a cookie for getting that one-"
It scared her to not understand him.
"That's it! Good job Sunny." She beamed at him, petting his head. He wasn't smiling, but even she could tell he was happy. Eyes closed and pushing his head into her hand. Just like Mewo. At least this hadn't changed about him.
At least, until Sunny angled his head to face her.
"Hmm? What is it, Sunny?"
He looked her in the eyes, something he rarely did nowadays. He was trembling a little. She felt concern rush over her.
Mari gave him a smile. "Sunny, you can tell me anything."
Sunny shivered...before placing a finger on his lips.
???
What was he asking for?
"Oh, another cookie?" Mari asked, looking towards the plate.
...
"...Last night..." She heard him mumble.
Last night?
...
Oh.
Right.
She had given her little brother a deep, passionate kiss only lovers should share.
...
Hehe.
"Of course, little brother."
She saw Sunny's eyes widen as she moved her face closer to his.
He stared at her, anticipation and wonder written on his face.
She moved a hand to the back of his head as she moved towards him, and him towards her...
...only to give him a quick peck on the lips and pull back.
He looked confused, before noticing her mischievous grin.
"There you go, little brother. How was it?"
His eyes started to water, and while that did make her guilty, it also made her want to tease him more.
"My, my, Sunny. You can act so spoiled sometimes. Honestly, when did you-"
Before she could finish that, Sunny practically bounced up and pressed his lips against hers.
Mari's eyes widened as he started to kiss her. She felt overwhelmed with joy.
"Mmm, Snny..." She mumbled, trying to enjoy this as much as she could, putting up a feeble resistance.
She couldn't describe...how happy it made her to see him take initiative.
And his mouth tasted like cookie. She wanted to savor this.
But above all, she wanted to look into his eyes more.
She wanted to see him again.
The boy she wanted to play piano for.
The boy she loved hearing play violin for her.
The boy she...
...
Mari pulled away at last, saliva falling on Sunny's cheek.
Following an odd impulse, Mari leaned forward to kiss his cheek and lick it up.
Sunny moved a hand to his cheek as he looked up at her.
He was so happy. She was so happy. A part of her wanted them to stay like this forever. In this moment, he was Sunny again. He loved her again. He realized that she loved him. He couldn't lie to himself about this right now. They were happy.
"Sunny, I love you. I love you so much."
He looked up at her, eyes wide. Would he...!
...
It returned. Guilt. Regret. He looked away from her. Her heart dropped. No, no, no...!
She wanted to speak, but knew she'd sound desperate. After a moment, she composed herself.
"...We got a lot done today, how about we take a rest in our room?"
Sunny didn't say anything. She pushed back from the table, and he wheeled her to their room.
He set her down in bed, and climbed in himself. She didn't give him a chance to sleep any other way than between her arms.
She...fell asleep...soon after...
...
...
"I...love you too..."
