It had been over a month since her suicide. The funeral and come and gone. Open casket, of course, Mari looked just like she would've on that night.
Hero didn't come. Kel forced a weak smile, but his eyes were pained, and never quite looked straight ahead. Aubrey's were either full of tears or buried in her hands. Sunny and Basil were there, but weren't *there*. Neither said a word. Basil stared at his feet, Sunny looked in the direction of Mari, but didn't really see.
It had been weeks, then, since Basil last saw Sunny. He knew Sunny didn't want to see talk to anybody, but Basil needed to know that he was okay, or that he was anything. He couldn't lose Sunny, especially now.
Is what he told himself, trying to build up the courage to knock on their doorstep. He had already stood there for nearly 5 minutes, anxiously looking around, photo album at his side. "Come on... it's lucky Kel or Hero haven't seen me here already... I need to hurry up. Sunny.. wouldn't be angry with me, right?"
He had just raised his shaking fist to knock when the door opened in front of him. It was Sunny's mother. "Oh, Basil, it's you. I was just going out for groceries. Are you here to see Sunny?"
"Y-yes, ma'am-" He couldn't look her in the eyes. He didn't want to. "Is he home?" As if he needed to ask.
"Yes", she sighed, "he's up in their room. You can go on in," she said, walking past Basil towards the garage.

He paused at the foot of the stairs. There was no one there. He gripped the book of memories tighter and ascended. 

The second door blocked Basil. He was somehow more scared to knock than before. He was afraid of something. He wanted to see Sunny again, didn't he? There was nothing to be afraid of. Everything was okay. Everything was...
He tapped the door with his knuckle. "S-Sunny? It's me... I thought you might want to... um, talk a little? I... I brought our photo album..."
The silence from behind the door held. Basil rocked back and forth on his feet, waiting for what seemed like hours in front of the room. "This was a bad idea... if he wanted to see me, he would've come out on his own..." he thought, about to turn to leave. He heard the creak of bed springs. He waited.
The door opened. Sunny's painfully neutral face glared back at him. The room was dark, curtains closed. They looked at each other, silence all around. Basil broke off and looked at his side. "I, uh... thought you might want to look through this...", extending the book in his hands. Sunny looked at it for a moment, then took the end and turned into the darkness. 
Stepping in, Basil had to wait a minute for his eyes to adjust. "Could we, hah.. uh.. turn on a light?" he asked, not sure what kind of response to expect. 
In the darkness he could see Sunny's silhouette stop where he was. He stood at the desk in front of the doorway, motionless, album in his hands. Then, as if nothing had happened, he reached across to the bed stand in the middle of the room and switched on the small lamp.
The room had changed since Basil was here... last time. It looked barren. Sunny's side had a wardrobe, the floor in front of his bed was clear. Mari... her bed was still here, sheets folded and stacked, and everything else on her side of the room was in boxes. 
"You really, ha, keep your room clean... ha..." Basil tiptoed around and sat on the edge of Sunny's bed. Sunny rummaged around in drawer in the desk, pocketed something, turned towards Basil, and sat on the floor in the center of the room. He opened the album in front of him.
"Everyone has kind of... been on their own lately... Hero and Aubrey have been staying home a lot, and Kel has been... quieter than usual. I... I just wanted to see you again, Sunny. Everything is going to be okay... we just have to... stick together, right? Sunny?"
Basil lifted his eyes from the floor in front of him towards Sunny. He flipped a page in the album. He was... writing?
"S-Sunny... what are you-" He began to crouch down by his side. Sunny had a marker, his grip moving mechanically left to right. Their faces... Kel, Hero, Aubrey, they were replaced by the chaotic markings. Mari was nothing except a black spot.
"Sunny, hey!" Basil put his hand on Sunny's shoulder. He stopped writing, but held the marker firm in his hand. He stared at Basil. His eyes... his eyes scared Basil. They weren't angry, or sad, or afraid, or anything. They were empty. Basil withdrew his arm. 
"Sunny... why?" He buried his damp eyes in his hands. He sat like that, listening to the faint scratching of the marker. Why... why did something like this happen?

He heard the book close.
He kept his head in his hands, but then heard footsteps. "Sunny?" He saw Sunny walk out of the room, and heard the bathroom door shut. He turned to the album. 
Its plain back was normal. It... looked just like it did before. It was the photo album, it held their precious memories. Everything was okay. He went to pick it up off the floor, where it was left. He turned it around, its front was just how he remembered it. It was okay. It was...
The edge of a photo peeked out of the album. He could see part of Mari's piano. He opened the page to fix it...
**Black.**

He was rushing down the stairs when he heard a door open behind him. He glanced behind him. Something glanced back.
