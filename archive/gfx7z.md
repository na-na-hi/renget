#Lost

Cassie embraced her crying daughter tightly, whispering words of comfort and reassurance into her ear. “It wasn’t your fault, baby. Please don’t cry, I’m sure we’ll find Sunny in no time.” The mother’s forehead creased with worry as she held her daughter’s shaking body, resisting the immense urge to break out crying herself. No, now’s not the time for that. She needs to keep a clear head and look for her son.

“I’m sorry!I—I’m soooo sorrrrry!” Mari sobbed on her mother’s chest. “Sunny was just next to me but I accidentally let go of his hand and then…. and then he wasn’t there anymore! I’m such a bad…older…sister!” Many eyes were fixed on them but nobody approached. “Come now,” she said, stroking her back. “That’s not true at all. Sunny wouldn’t agree with you if he heard that.” She held her soft, tear-riddled face in her hands, meeting her eye to eye. Just the sight of her absolutely devastated face was enough to break her heart into pieces. “We will find Sunny, understand?” Mari nodded as she rubbed her sore eyes. “Yes mommy.”

Mother and daughter trudged on, hands locked with each other in an inseparable grip. Cassie was holding her daughter’s hand and Mari onto Sunny’s when it happened. A sudden surge of crowd heading right in their direction. Like a strong downpour obscuring visibility from a window, Cassie lost sight of where they’re headed for a moment but kept her daughter close. Thinking back now, she realized she should’ve held Sunny with her other hand. The sheer stupidity of it made her want to scream and curse herself for being so thoughtless. Focus, she told herself. Now’s not the time to get carried away. The only thing that mattered was to find her son before it’s too late.

They went back to the location where Sunny presumably got separated — in front of the toy store. “Maybe your brother went back inside,” she said. Mari nodded in agreement. The toy store was quite expansive so it might take a while to comb through the entire place, but something in her mind told her that her son would be somewhere inside. She just knew it. Cassie and Mari approached the cashiers in front and described to them what Sunny looked like, asking them if they’ve seen him.

“Ah yes, I think he’s still here,” said the young woman in a comforting voice. “I’m sure you’ll find your son further inside.”

Cassie thanked them and the two proceed inside with renewed hope. Dark thoughts kept resurfacing in her mind as they walked however. What if Sunny already left and wandered off somewhere else? What if someone bad got to him first and took him away? What if—, she felt a tug on her finger. “Mommy, please don’t cry,” said Mari who’s staring right at her, on the verge of bursting out crying herself. She hadn’t noticed but tears were streaming down her face at that moment. She hastily wiped them away and smiled at her. “I’m so sorry, sweetie. Come on, let’s get your brother back.”

Cassie asked almost every adult they happened across if they’ve seen her son. Four years old, with a blue shirt and brown pants. Most would say no or that they haven’t noticed; some would avoid them outright, but despite everything the mother did not waver. She took a deep breath and calmed herself. Sunny’s in here, she could feel it strongly and so did Mari. It wasn’t long after that when Cassie and Mari encountered some familiar faces. They’re a rather large family who lived in the same street and everyone in the neighborhood knew them well — the pious Bakers.

“Oh there you are! Good afternoon Mrs. Suzuki, said Beth, the mother. She’s sitting with her husband, Marco, on a bench with shopping bags scattered around them. “Why the long face?” asked the father. “Is there something wrong?” Cassie explained what happened back then in a frantic voice. The guilt was so palpable she couldn’t help but break into a sob in the middle of it, and so did Mari. Suddenly, she felt Beth’s warm hands on hers; a smile on her face. A smile that seemed to be saying that everything is okay.

“Oh goodness, we thought you were with Sunny here,” she said, not letting go of her hand. “He’s with our twins and younger boy in the children’s books section in the back. In fact, we were just about to look for you.”

Cassie felt an enormous surge of relief wash over her whole body. Sunny’s safe with them. “H-He is…,” she said, still too stunned to properly process what she just heard. Mari too, was beaming. “Sunny’s here! Yaaaay! Come on mommy, let’s go!” Her daughter forcefully grabbed her arm and she followed. 

And there he was, her boy, sitting with the Bakers’ children. The children were huddled together in a circle, peering over through some huge book filled with animal pictures. 

“Oh…Sunny! Thank goodness you’re safe!” Cassie embraced her son who’s surprised at the sudden commotion. 

“Mommy?” His little arms wrapped around her neck and the little boy gave her mommy’s forehead a kiss. Mari did the same and hugged her brother while he’s still in their mother’s arms. “I’m so, so sorry! I shouldn’t have let you go!” Mari was crying in full force again.

“Mawi don’t cry,” he said, giving his older sister a head pat.

“Good afternoon Mrs. Suzuki” said the twins in unison. Mikhael, the youngest child, remained sat in his position, unable to make sense of what was happening. Cassie explained to the older kids what happened and how thankful she is to them for looking out after Sunny. 

Their parents soon arrived at the scene and Cassie poured out every gratitude she could at them from the bottom of her heart. All’s well that ends well.

The three walked out of the toy store, hands locked with each other; Mari to the right and Sunny to the left. She vowed never to make the same mistake again.
