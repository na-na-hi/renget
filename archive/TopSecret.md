#My Stable Diffusion based rentrys:
!!!danger FOR YOU SAFETY, ALWAYS SCAN FOR PICKLES BEFORE USING MODELS FOUND ONLINE. THOSE TOO!
!!!info Best way is to download only files that are in `safetensors` format. ->-> Or if you want to share you model, you should convert it to it. ->-> ->-> Converting does not scan for pickles, so scan first, then convert. ->-> ->-> `safetensors` files can be compressed to up 50% of size with 7zip. ->-> ->-> `safetensors` are theoretically pickle free format and run a bit better in WEBUI ->->
!!!warning **Hash numbers in webui are bad.** They are incomplete. AND their process was already changed once, making old hash irrelevant. ->-> **ANYONE CAN UNZIP A MODEL FILE AND REPLACE STARTING FILES TO MATCH HASH NUMBERS FROM WEBUI!!!** ->-> ->-> Use tools like https://github.com/gurnec/HashCheck instead. ->->

!!!note SELF NOTE: If you have permission error in python. When it worked before. ->-> AND you did a reinstall of it, at some point. ->-> ->-> AND even more, if you EVER installed it `for all users` before. ->-> ->-> GO TO THE `AppData`, find folder named `PIP` and DELETE this SHIT!!! ->->  ->-> It is not being deleted when you uninstall python, and it locks of the permissions. ->->  ->->  No regedit deletion of pip or python necessary.
