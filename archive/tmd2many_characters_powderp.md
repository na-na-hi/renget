->Powder Painting, also known as Powder, is a Chesipin and appreciated member of the Bright Bandit Gang. Being a lover of the creative freedom the gang stands for, Powder is beloved for her artistic integrity and gentle nature. She spends most of her time touching up parts of the base, usually in the Inkery, and is responsible for dyeing the fur of each of the gang's members with their signature faux-shiny coloration. Powder has been interested in art since the day she hatched, always drawing lines in the dirt, building castles out of mud, getting in trouble for making messes in the pursuit of self-fulfillment.<-
->With the Bright Bandits, she can scrawl whatever she wants wherever she wants. Somehow this is a less destructive outlet.<-
