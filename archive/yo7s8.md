>#Human Kobold Alliance Story

"So I'm not allowed to cover my chest or between my legs anymore?" 
    Kliz asked her mother with a whine.  Kliz always liked her dresses, and was reluctant to part with them as part of her adulthood ritual.  Her mother was having none of it, and pointed to her own exposed groin.
    "Hon, have you EVER seen me or any other adult kobold female in the kingdom with covered breasts or crotch?"
    Kliz had to admit that she hadn't, but then again she hadn't really given it much thought.  It just seemed normal.  She didn't realize it was a law, and one that would apply to her once she grew up.  With her adulthood ritual rapidly approaching, all the little details that she had heard over the years were suddenly having a lot more meaning now.  She was also starting to notice details she hadn't while growing up.  Like how her mother's clothing had strategically placed and sized holes.  How her father's clothing was always bottomless.  How every adult kobold wore a collar.  How the occasional adult kobold she passed on the street was wearing shoes and a collar, or only a collar in some cases.  The way every human male was Sir, and every human female was Ma'am.  She couldn't stop thinking about it.
    Resigned, knowing there would be no way out of it, she had to ask.  
    "But why are things this way?"
    As her mother told it, a few hundred years ago the Kobolds had their own kingdom that neighbored the Human kingdom.  The humans were one of the few races that would even deal with the Kobolds.  Then one of the other races figured out they held a strong military and technological advantage over the Kobolds, and declared war.  Kobolds were proud of what they could do, but their smaller size and lack of strength always limited their capabilities.  They also didn't produce as many highly intelligent prodigies as the other species naturally did.  Kobolds weren't dumb, but they didn't have very many geniuses either.  Within a week, nearly half the Kobold kingdom had been taken, and 2/3rds of the army had been wiped out.  The Kobold ruler at the time was a rather crafty Queen, and intelligent enough to be considered charming and witty company by diplomats of all species.  Knowing there was no way to win without help, and knowing absolute destruction was the only possible result otherwise, she traveled to the human kingdom to meet with their king.
    As the legend goes, her mother claimed, she asked him directly for help to save the Kobolds from extinction.  He asked her what she would give in return.  She said she no longer had anything to bargain with.  At which point he dismissed her, saying he had no reason to help.  She then promised him anything she could give.  The human king thought about it for a bit, then asked her to wait.  He left the room and came back some time later with a few of his scribes, and what is now known as the Human Kobold Alliance contract.  Knowing it would be a deal to rescue her people, she asked to sign immediately, without even reading it.  The king only laughed and told her that she couldn't sign until she read the entire contract, and would know how to sign after she finished reading.
    "I don't get it."
    "The contract is on display at the palace main hall for any visitor to see, I can quote it word for word.  This contract hereby merges the entire Kobold kingdom into the Human kingdom.  All Kobold lands are now Human lands, and the Kobold government is dissolved.  All adult Kobolds are to surrender themselves to the nearest auction house in Human lands, where they will be sold to the highest bidder.  Once sold and collared, a Kobold is expected to serve their Human owner a minimum of 60 hours a week, but is not required to serve longer or remain while not serving.  This servitude is to last until the Human owner dies, at which point the Kobold is required to surrender themselves to the nearest auction house in Human lands, or the Human decides to sell the Kobold back to an auction house."  
    "No adult male Kobold is allowed to wear any clothing that covers any area from the underside of their tail to an inch above the base of their penis.  No adult female Kobold is allowed to wear any clothing that covers any area from the underside of their tail to two inches above their clitoral hood.  No adult female Kobold is allowed to wear any clothing that covers their nipples or breasts, with a minimum of a quarter inch gap between the edge of the clothing and the breast.  All adult Kobolds are required to submit to any punishment their owner decides on as long as it doesn't draw blood, causes permanent damage, or otherwise mutilate the Kobold being punished.  All Kobolds are required to follow any order given to them by a Human unless it conflicts with an order given by their owner or an authority figure, the order would result in themselves or another person getting hurt or injured, the order would result in a crime, or if an adult human ordered an underage Kobold to do something sexual.  There have been many changes and adjustments to the rules over the years, but the basic contract still stands."
    Kliz couldn't believe it.  
    "So she just signed us all into slavery to the humans?!"
    Her mother just shrugged.  
    "It was that or death.  She didn't exactly get off easy herself.  The final part of the contract was the trade.  In addition to everything prior, the current Kobold Queen will become the property of the Human King.  She will be expected to serve non-stop without the prior stated limits on servitude.  She will be required to produce at least one female child with a male Kobold every ten years, with continual breeding until the requirement is met if she fails to bear a female heir.  Her eldest living adult daughter will become the next Kobold Queen after she passes away, and will be required to meet the terms of the contract as stated prior.  In exchange, Kobolds will be protected by their owners.  They will be fed, be given proper grooming, and protected against hostile species.  Any children borne by a Kobold female are to be taken care of by the mother and her Human owner.  Human owners are expected to provide for any Kobold children borne by any female Kobolds they own.  Though the mother is still expected to serve, she is not required to serve to the point of neglecting her children.  If the Kobold Queen is willing to agree to these terms, she is to remove all clothing, kneel before her new owner, place her arms behind her back, and wait for her first order."
    "...and she did?"
    Her mother favored her with a look she usually reserved for the town idiot, and pointedly put her hands behind her neck with her elbows up, thrusting her breasts forwards.
    Kliz was more than a bit embarrassed.  She knew this, she was just distracted by the story.  
    "Oh, yeah."  
    She had heard about the contract, but never knew how degrading the entire deal was until now.  
    "I just can't believe she did it.  He practically treated her like..."
    "A slave?"
    Her mother's response was just another nail in the coffin.  She wanted out.  No doubt, she had more than a few fantasies about human men late at night, shuddering and shaking while remaining dead silent to avoid waking her mother.  It would be hard not to, given how warm and soft they usually were.  And strong.  And tall.  And smart.  But the thought of being controlled by some human sent a cold shiver down her spine.  She wasn't some kind of animal or pet, she was a person!  Didn't she deserve to make her own choices?  
    "Mom, please, there has to be a way out.  I could run..."
    "Don't even DARE think about it!  A brother and sister tried to flee the kingdom once.  They were caught, brought back, and were publicly restrained and tickled for five days for every day they had been gone.  From sun up to sundown, with no rest.  They were crying by the end of the first day, and begged non-stop for mercy as they were lead to and from the stockade every day after.  After the punishment was over, neither one was willing to leave the city, much less the kingdom.  You do NOT want that to happen to you."
    Kliz already had her tail wrapped protectively around herself out of reflex.  She once had an experience where a human boy had held her down and tickled her sensitive belly.  She laughed and squealed, and felt her muscles turn to water.  The moment she felt she could move again, he tickled her again.  It felt even more intense than the first time, and she immediately realized she couldn't make any move to escape from the intense sensation as long as he was tickling her.  Which he kept doing exactly as she nearly recovered.  Every time it felt like she was running out of air and couldn't breathe, he would stop and let her start to recover.  Then those damned soft hands would be on her stomach again, and she would be back to screaming laughter while desperately trying to plead for mercy.  It had gone on for about ten minutes before the boy got bored of the game and left her alone, but it felt like an eternity to her.  Having to go through that, without her tormentor stopping when it became painful to breathe, from sun up to sundown, day after day?  She shuddered.
    "Kliz, I know you are afraid.  But there is nothing to be afraid of.  Most humans treat us well, the few that don't usually get themselves barred from the auction houses, and you'll probably enjoy it more than you think."
    Kliz couldn't help but stare at her mother over that.  
    "Enjoy it?  What makes you think I would enjoy it?!"
    Her mother only met her gaze and said "That human boy you always spend time with, Teiras, how would you feel if he owned you?"
    Which was more or less the nature of those late night fantasies of hers.  Her answer sounded lame to her even before she said it.  
    "That's different."
    Her mother snorted.  "How so?"
    "He wouldn't..."  She thought about how nice he always was to her.  "...be mean to me." she lamely finished.
    "Kliz, dear, what do you think my owner has me do?"
    Kliz had never really thought to much about it.  She never wanted to think about what some human forced her mother to do.  But her mother always seemed happy in the company of her owner, so she never asked before.  She shrugged.
    "I spend most of my serving time sitting in his lap."
    "...sitting?"
    "Yes.  Just sitting.  Nothing sexual, just sitting in his lap.  He likes me to sit in his lap with my tail wrapped around his body.  I enjoy his warmth, he says he enjoys my cold."
    Kliz had to chew that over for a bit.  
    "Humans like our cold?"
    "Some do, more-so in the hot summer months.  My owner does.  He also enjoys having me served on a platter."
    Kliz could only look confused about that.  Her mother elaborated.
    "Every day after evening meal, I am sent to the kitchen with some rope, and ordered to instruct the chef to serve me to my owner.  The kitchen staff take off my clothes, lay me on a platter, and tie me to the platter with my legs spread wide.  They then pick up the platter, and deliver me to my owner.  I am placed in front of him on the dining table, and he eats until he's content.  Once he's satisfied, he drops a napkin over me, and the staff take me back to the kitchen to be untied and redress."
    "...he likes that?"
    "Very much.  Sometimes when I'm sitting in his lap he'll rub between my horns and call me his little iced treat."
    Kliz froze a bit at that.  Sitting in a human's lap, basking in the heat, being petted and rubbed and called affectionate names, didn't she masturbate to that very fantasy last night?
    Her mother misunderstood her reaction.  
    "He doesn't say it to be mean, and he's not trying to be mean."
    "I know, I...never mind."  
    Her adulthood ritual still loomed ahead of her.  
    "How much longer until the ritual?"
    Her mother looked out the window at the slowly setting sun, still well above the horizon.  
    "Another few hours at least.  Just try to relax, it will happen soon enough.  I have to go to my owners now, but I'll be back home in time to walk you to your ritual.  Alright?"
    "I thought you had today off?"
    "He did give me the day off to look after you for your big day, but he did say he still wanted his little iced treat after dinner."
    She could only blink at that.  
    "You weren't joking when you said every day."
    Her mother just smiled.  
    "If he asked for a honey-covered little iced treat, I would have needed to leave sooner.  I'll be back before the sun goes down.  Behave while I'm gone."

	*		*		*

   An hour later, and Kliz was about ready to chew her own tail off.  Her mind kept racing around in circles, thinking non-stop about humans.  Humans.  A Kobold's greatest strength, a Kobold's greatest weakness.  They were tough, but usually gentle.  They were clever, but not snobby about it like the elves.  They could be stern, but were usually merciful.  They had great power, but their flesh was soft and pleasant to the touch.  They owned Kobolds outright, but they never treated Kobolds like the other races did when they had Kobolds at their mercy.  They didn't lock them in permanent chastity devices and force them to eat off of the ground like the Elves did.  They didn't use the Kobolds for labor and work them to death like the Lapines did.  They didn't eat Kobolds alive like the Orcs did.  They had full power over the Kobolds, but...
    Kliz looked around her mother's home for what must have been the thousandth time.  It was a house in the style of a Kobold hovel, but made from Human engineering and materials.  Kobolds tended to build their homes out of mud, clay, and any nearby plant matter they can use to hold the mud and clay together.  Usually not more than five feet high, but that worked fine for Kobolds since most of them were no larger than four feet tall.  Basic design was circular, with a firepit in the middle with a hole at the top to let smoke out, a door for entry, and a hole to act as a window.  Her mother's home had the same basic design, but was Human-ized.  The door was solid and had hinges rather than being a piece of wood that was moved out of the way and replaced.  The windows, more than one, had glass and could be opened for fresh air.  The walls, floor, and ceiling were all made of wood and held together with nails.  And in the center of the home wasn't a firepit, but the always incredible heating stove.
    She thought if it wasn't for the contract, Kobolds would have probably sold themselves to the Humans just to get access to the heating stoves.  Heating stoves were an amazing human invention that made fire look bad.  You added in the fuel, which could be just about anything that burned, started it burning, then closed it up.  There was a pipe that would carry the smoke all the way outside of the house, which was sealed watertight with the roof so you didn't get rain falling in the house like you would with the old hole method.  No smoke in the house, and the metal of the stove caused it to radiate a lot of heat with very little fuel.  It burned much slower than a firepit, so you spent less on firewood and other fuel as well.  And the best part of all, the heat was trapped in the stove.  As long as you didn't actually touch it when it was hot, you could get right next to the heater stove without worrying about a flying ember burning you or catching your bedding on fire.  Long lasting easily approachable heat, at any time, and you didn't even need to watch over it to prevent it from going out.  For such a wondrous invention, the Kobolds would have probably sold their souls.
    She couldn't take thinking about Humans anymore, and started pacing around the house.  The sight of some of her mother's clothing hanging on the circular rod that went about halfway around the house made her stop.  She started thinking about her own clothes, and how she would soon be wearing adult clothing with the special holes.  She slowly approached one of her mother's dresses, a light blue and frilly thing that ballooned out at the hips and remained wide and billowing all the way to the ground.  The top half had two holes on the chest, and was made out of some silky soft material.  The bottom half of the dress had a circular cutout around the waist going from the front to the back, with a hole cut all the way through all the fluff and frills to the other side, only to close back up by the knees.  Tied to the wooden bar next to the dress was two ribbons in the exact same light blue color.  She knew what those were for, she had seen more than a few Kobolds with a ribbon tied around each horn.  She had heard more than a few Humans say it was cute.  After spending about five minutes standing there and feeling the material of the dress, she made a decision.
    It was her adulthood ritual day, so she wasn't likely to get into trouble for wearing adult clothing which was forbidden from children.  She could see what it was like, couldn't she?  What harm could possibly come from it?  After convincing herself it was 100% safe, she took her own dress off and began putting her mother's light blue dress on.  It was a bit tricky getting her arms into the long thin sleeves, and she was surprised to find the lower half had silk sleeves to guide her legs into.  At the bottom of the sleeves on the legs were small holes for her toes to stick out of, with a silver ring mated with the holes for her largest and smallest toes.  When she lifted the bottom of the dress out of the way, she saw the sleeves had the effect of covering her lower legs and feet in light blue, with the silver rings calling attention to her claws.  Those sleeves stopped just above her knees, where the cutout zone began.  Looking in the mirror, she could see it looked as though she was wearing the sort of dress a rich noble Human might wear, except her groin was completely visible from the front and back.  As she stepped forward, her light blue clad foot would stick out just beyond the range of the dress's frills, and the silver rings caught the slightest light and flashed.  As for being exposed, nearly any movement she made would cause the cutout around her crotch to spread and open up just a little more than when she was standing still.  The longer her stride, the more she was exposed.
    The bottom half of the dress was loose and billowy, and would feel like nothing at all if it wasn't for the light blue silk she could feel pressing between her toes.  The top half of the dress was quite the opposite, with the silky light blue material being stretchy and clinging all around her, the sole exception being her breasts.  She could feel it gently squeezing from her waist up to below her neck-bone, and all down her arms.  Much like with the legs, the arm sleeves ended with holes for her fingers to fit through, with silver rings mated to the middle hole.  She was a bit confused as to why there wasn't two rings on each hand like she had on each foot, until she remembered the middle finger was where Humans wore their wedding rings.  Weddings were not a Kobold concept, they didn't even usually stick together after the female was impregnated.  It was a Human concept, a concept which had left many Kobolds awestruck.  One of the most common fantasies among the other Kobold girls Kliz had grown up with was having a Human marry them after buying them.  It had happened before to some Kobolds, and there wasn't a single Kobold female that didn't think about how amazing it would be to have a Human declare you his life-long mate.  Kliz looked in the mirror at her exposed breasts and crotch, fingering the ring on her right hand.  She had to admit, the dress made her feel good.  And the rings on her hands lent themselves to all manner of fantasies.  She thought about Humans seeing her wearing a dress like this.  She thought about Teiras seeing her in this dress.  She thought about that for a minute, then pulled her hand out from between her legs and started planning.
    She knew she had to have the right look, or some Humans might suspect she was in violation of the law.  After her mother's story earlier, she would rather eat broken glass than break the law.  Presenting herself as an adult Kobold without actually having an owner, that could be bad.  She reasoned as long as she looked the part and said the right things, no one would suspect anything.  If she did things right, she could go for a walk in her mother's dress and maybe run across Teiras...  She grabbed the light blue ribbons off the wooden rod where they hung their clothes, and tied each one in a large bow onto her horns.  She admired the way the light blue bows looked on her jet black horns, with this getup even she was starting to think she looked cute.  She found a spare collar under her mother's bed pallet and put it on around her neck, with the small metal ring in the front like she had seen it worn.  At first she was afraid to put it on due to the look of the lock and no key being anywhere in the house.  Then she discovered it opened and closed without needing a key at all, and a closer inspection showed the lock to be just a hole to give the appearance of a lock.  She almost left the house before a wave of panic brought her to her senses.  She had almost forgotten the makeup!
    Makeup wasn't just for looks, it said things to Humans.  The important colors were Red, Yellow, and Green.  Any time an adult Kobold was in public, they were required to be marked in a specific way.  Red around a body part was a flat denial, that area belonged to that Kobold's owner alone.  Green meant anyone was welcome to help themselves and was effectively an open invitation.  Yellow meant the Kobold was allowed to share that part of their body with another Human, if the Kobold chose to.  This law was a result of how possessive Humans could be with their Kobolds.  Before the law came out, Kobolds that were forbidden from having sex with other Humans still would, and just say they couldn't resist the advances of the Human.  With the marking, Humans knew the wishes of the Kobolds owner without even needing to ask.  Going outside without makeup would look very unusual and would have blown her cover before she even got started.  She dug around her mother's belongings until she found the three colors and some brushes.  Knowing full well she would be closely inspected before the auction, she painted red around her groin.  She thought about Teiras again, and decided to paint yellow around her mouth, just in case she ran across him and he really liked her dress.  Looking at the green paint and thinking dirty thoughts, she carefully painted green around her breasts.  She checked herself in the mirror one last time.  Dress looked great, her breasts and crotch were exposed as would be expected, and...  she was ready if she ran across Teiras.  If not, well, the green on her chest would mean she could expect some soft warm hands on her breasts.  At least, she was pretty sure that's how it worked.
    She left the house and started walking down the street.  Humans and Kobolds were everywhere as was the usual.
    "Hello there!"
    She froze solid and whipped her head to the source of the sound.  An adult Human male, looking at her.  He was smiling and appeared to be friendly.  Middle aged, brown hair...he was probably expecting a response.
    "H-Hello sir!"
    He crouched on a knee the way Humans usually did when they wanted to talk to a Kobold face to face.  Kliz honestly preferred them to stand tall when talking to her, but it was a Human thing.
    "That's a very pretty dress you're wearing." He complimented her, reaching towards her.
    "Ah, it's...one of my favorites." 
    She stumbled over her response as his hands reached her sides under her arms, and she started feeling the warmth of his hands seeping into her.
    "Well it looks wonderful on you.  The ribbons are a nice touch, they really look good on your horns."  
    His hands slid slightly towards her front, and he started rubbing under her breasts.
    "THANK...you siR."  
    She was having some trouble controlling the sound of her voice, the Human's soft warm hands were doing everything she had hoped for when she painted green around her chest.
    "So what are you doing?"  
    He had extended his thumbs out, and were using them to gently flick at her nipples, while his palms were still pressed against under her breasts, pushing the warmth in.
    "Just..MMMmm, going for a walk."  
    She could feel herself leaning forwards, trying to get even closer to that heat.  Suddenly he stopped playing with her breasts, which snapped her out of the daze she was in.  Had she done something wrong?  The Human was still smiling at her, and his hands were moving...  He laid one hand on each side of her face, making the sweet warmth all around her neck and face.  Before she could tell him how much she liked the feel of that, he kissed her on her forehead between her horns, told her she was very cute, and then let her go and bid her a good day.  
    She was disappointed it didn't last longer, but outside of the duration of the event, it was exactly what she had been hoping for when she put the paint on.  He even kissed her!  Her plan was working better than she thought it would.  She would just be able to walk around and enjoy affection from some nice Humans and maybe Teiras too.
    A half hour later and the sun was starting to set.  Kliz had been having a wonderful time, with a grand total of four male Humans, and even one female Human who had done something with her mouth and Kliz's nipple that left Kliz humping her leg.  Her plan was flawless, and she was invincible.  Humans greeted her, complimented her, gave her warmth and affection, and then bid her good day.  She was starting to feel a bit cocky, and had actually managed to act seductively with the last male Human.  She might have done it too if he hadn't declined due to a lack of time.  She figured she had to get home soon, and change out before her mother got home and caught her wearing adult clothes before her ritual.  She was just down the street from her home when she saw a local Human town guard who she had seen many times in the past.  She had fantasized a few times about that particular guard.  Feeling on top of the world, she decided if she wasn't gonna get a chance with Teiras today, the guard would make a good consolation prize.
    Putting on her best seduction game, she made her approach.  She kept her pace slow, but her stride long to ensure the silver rings on her feet were reaching sunlight.  She kept her gaze fixed on the guard's eyes.  Once he looked her direction, she wasn't going to break the gaze.  She made sure to place her feet slightly closer together as she walked to create a swaying motion that always worked to attract male attention.  She kept her arms behind her back, wanting to make very clear to the guard what colors she was marked with.  After closing about half the distance, she had the guard's attention.  She continued to look directly at him while smiling, until she was standing directly in front of him.
    "Why hel~lo there sir!" she said with an in-often practiced curtsy she hoped looked elegant.
    "Hello there yourself.  Can I help you with something?"  
    The guard was smiling at her, like every other Human had today.  She was really liking this dress.  She made a point of slowly lowering her gaze to his crotch, then raising it back to his eyes.
    "I'm really hoping you can." she said with a smile.
    "I think I can.  Would you like to come with me to somewhere more private?"  
    He was still smiling, and had his hand extended out to her.  She gladly took it.  Walking down a street holding hands with a Human was one of the many fantasies she often had running around in her head.  And it was everything she hoped it was.  Everyone who looked her way and saw her holding the guard's hand was smiling at her, and a few Kobold women gave her gestures of congratulations.  She then remembered the rings on her middle fingers, and understood exactly what this scene looked like to passerby.  
    She looked up at the still smiling guard who was holding her hand.  He was a bit of an older human, and he was starting to get bits of grey hair.  An older human male, holding hands with a kobold female wearing rings on both hands?  She let herself dive into that fantasy.  By the time they had arrived at their destination, she had developed a complex narrative in her mind that she was walking home with her human husband, who always had her wear her rings outside the home so everyone could see she was claimed by him.
    The guard had led her to a nice looking inn near the center of town.  He opened the door and held it open for her.  "Right after you." he said with a smile.  She thought about how she must make sure to show this human a VERY nice time.  He was being really nice.  She held his hand as they walked up the stairs, and after unlocking the door, led her into one of the inn's rooms.  Even just being a rented room at an inn, the room was still nearly twice the size of her mother's home.  The walls were clean wood, and smelled of cedar.  In the center of the room was a giant bed, Kliz figured it could probably hold at least four humans.  The human let go of her hand and walked over to a dresser, where he started taking off and setting down the various items of his profession.  
    Kliz wasn't sure if she should take off her clothes, or if the human wanted to do it.  She then remembered the red she had put around herself, and figured there was no reason to undress at all.  By the time she had made that decision, the human was in front of her.  He had a chair she didn't see him grab, which he placed in front of her and sat down in.  Then he beckoned her closer.  Resisting the urge to just jump into him, she decided it was best to keep her seduction game up, and slowly stalked towards him.  Before she could get to the close distance she wanted, his hands came up and this time they settled on either side of her face.  One soft warm hand on each cheek.  Then they started gently rubbing her cheeks.  She reached out and grabbed his wrists, pulling and trying to get even more of those hands on her face.
    "Do you like this?" he asked her, still with the same gentile smile.
    "I...love this ssssir."  She was already starting to feel a bit sleepy from the warmth.  It was just right there, so close to her.
    "I hope you don't mind, but I don't like doing stuff with strangers, could you tell me a bit about yourself?  he asked, still with that same smile.  She wanted him to give her that smile and give her compliments every day.
    "Whatever you want sir."  She more or less mumbled out.  The cloying heat made her feel drained in the most wonderful way.
    "So whats your name?"
    "Kliz sir."
    "Nice to meet you Kliz, my name is Senna.  Most people just call me Guardsman Senna."
    "Nice to meet you Guardsman Senna."  
    She really hoped he wasn't expecting all that good of a conversation out of her.  At least not with his hands on her face putting her into a stupor.  She was trying to be seductive earlier, now she was just hoping she could fumble out the right words and not offend him.
    "Where do you live Kliz?"  The slow warm touching on her face didn't stop, and she didn't want it to.
    "Here in the capitol."
    "And where in the capitol?"
    "Over on the west side, south of the market."
    "Not far from where I found you then?"
    "That's right sir."  
    She remembered the sir this time.  She was having a very hard time remembering to call him sir.  She wanted to buy land in those soft warm hands, build a home, and raise children in them.
    "Can you describe your owner?"
    She thought about that human boy she liked so much.  "Black hair, strong, tall, warrrrrrmmmmm"
    "What sort of food do you like?"
    "Mmmm, pork, and...uh....mmmm...."  
    She was having a hard time thinking.  What sort of food did she like again?  She wanted to say hands, but somehow that didn't feel right.
    "How old are you Kliz?"
    "16 sir."
    "And when did you turn 16?"
    "Today sir."  She was glad for easy questions, thinking was getting harder and harder.
    "And when was your ritual?"
    "It's tonight."  Those hands just wouldn't stop.  She prayed they would never stop.
    "What's your favorite color?"
    She had to think about that.  Which color had done her the most good?  
    "Light blue."
    "Is your mother named Seris?"
    "Yeah."  
    That was a little strange.  How did he know her mother's name?  The hands kept rubbing and rubbing, and Kliz let herself get lost in the feeling.
    "And how old are you?"
    "16 sir."  Didn't she say that before?
    "And when is your ritual?"
    "Tonight sir."   
    She was pretty sure she had covered that before as well, but who cares?  He asked, she answered, everyone's happy.  He was obviously happy with her answers, since he kept right on rubbing.
    "And how old are you?"
    OK, she had definitely told him this before.  Was this some kind of game?  She shook her head to clear out the fuzziness and took a good look at the human.  He was still smiling.  Was he teasing her?
    "I'm 16 sir."
    He was still smiling and rubbing.
    "And when is your ritual?"
    This was starting to annoy her.  What the hell was he doing?  Why repeat the same questions over and over again?  
    "I'm pretty sure I've told you sir.  To....."
    She felt her stomach go cold and drop, and her tail droop to the floor.  He was still smiling, but now he stopped rubbing her cheeks.  His hands were still there, but no longer moving.
    "I think you have made a terrible mistake."
    The warmth coming from the Human's hands did nothing to counter the cold she felt growing within.
    "I think I have made a terrible mistake."
    He was still smiling, so maybe things weren't going to be bad.
    "And what terrible mistake did you make?"
    This was it.  Her future was going to depend on her answers.  There was still a chance.  Her mother always told her, be completely honest with authority figures like guards.  There must be a reason why.
    "I was wearing adult clothing and markings before my adulthood ritual."
    Smile hadn't changed, she was doing good so far.  Her mother was right again.  She was always right about the hard things in life.
    "And?"
    She felt herself twitch at that question.  Had she broken more than one law?  Just how deep of trouble was she in?
    "I...didn't say sir enough?"
    She felt him rub her cheeks twice.  "No one cares about that."
    What had she...oh.
    "I tried to seduce an adult human male before I was legally an adult?"
    He was still smiling, but her panic was rising, she HAD broken more than one law.
    "That's right.  Do you know how I knew you were underage before I even talked to you?"
    He knew?  The entire time she thought she was attracting him, the walk here, he knew the whole time?  She shook her head in a negative.
    "Maybe you should read the inscription on the rings you are wearing."
    She never saw any inscription.  Bringing her hands up to her face, she looked for an inscription, and found both rings had tiny words engraved on the side closest to her.  The only person to be likely to see those words would be the wearer.  Bringing them closer to read, she was able to make out what they said.
    "My...little...iced..."  She didn't need to finish.  She could guess the last word.
    "You know what a ring on the middle finger means in the kingdom, right?"
    "Um..."  It felt a little awkward to actually talk about the much fantasized marriage with a human.  "...a bond?"
    "More or less.  Do you know what a ring on both hands on the middle finger means?"
    More was better right?  
    "Really big bond?"
    "It's an open declaration of slow and painful death to anyone who harms the person wearing the rings.  As in the person giving the rings will hunt down and kill the offender."
    Her mother's owner felt that way about her mother?  There were suddenly a lot of questions Kliz had about that relationship.  Just how close were they?
    "So there's a double ringed kobold walking around with green paint on.  Had you known what the rings meant, you would have probably known no human owner is going to double ring a kobold then allow just anyone to touch."
    He finally took his hands off her face, but she was a bit too numb to notice.  He walked over to the dresser where he laid his equipment and started putting it back on.
    "I have to give you credit.  If you had worn all red paint out, you might have gotten away with it.  Maybe even a yellow.  But green was a dead giveaway."
    She just stared at the wooden floor.  How could she have been so stupid?  STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!
    The guard was in front of her again, fully equipped.  He pulled a small thin chain with a clip on the end out of a pouch.  She recognized it.  She had seen it only once before.  A rather sad looking kobold being lead by another guard.  When she asked her mother, she said that kobold was being lead to punishment at the stockade.  Stockade.  The fear was rising like a high screaming note.  She started hearing her mother's words repeating like an alarm.  You don't want it to happen to you, you don't want it to happen to you, you don't want it to happen to you...
    Suddenly, she felt the clip of the lead as it connected to the small metal ring on her collar.
    "Alright, let's go."
    There was an attempt to beg, but she had fallen into a state of full panic, and instead did the only thing she was capable of.  She screamed.
    "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"
    The guard's head jerked back in shock.  "What the-?"
    She uncontrollably shook all over, her legs gave out, and she tried to plead her case while crying, screaming, and shaking on the ground in a curled up position with her tail wrapped around herself.
    "AAAAABHUAAAAWAAAAAMAAAAA!"
    Guardsmen Senna was crouched over her and had his hands rubbing her throat.
    "Hey!  Calm down!  It's off!  The collar is off, calm down!"
    She wanted to calm down for him but couldn't.  She saw the collar with the lead still attached laying next to her, but that wasn't what had her terrified.  Her punishment was still coming.  The guard finally pulled her face into his stomach, rubbing her back and between her horns while she cried and screamed.  After enough coaxing and the warmth helping to calm her down, he finally asked.
    "Who choked you?"
    What was he talking about?  "Huh?"
    "You had a freakout when I put the lead on your collar.  I've had kobold thieves who didn't react like that.  Who choked you?  What's their name?  There are laws against that."
    "No one has ever choked me sir."
    He held her out at arms length, taking her away from the wonderful warmth, but his hands still on her shoulders.
    "Then what was that about?"
    She started shaking a bit again.
    "I'm sorry sir, I can't!"
    "Can't what?"
    "I can't stand being tickled!" she finished with a sob and started crying again.
    "Woah, hey, calm down, you aren't going to be tickled!"                                           
    "I'm not?"  She wanted to believe him.
    "No.  I was taking you home.  To your mother."  
    He gave her shoulders a brief rub and then let her go.  Absolute relief.  There wasn't going to be some harsh punishment.  She wanted to cry with relief.
    "Thank you sir!"
    He put his hands back on her shoulders.
    "Now who tickled you?  Was it a human?"
    Whoops, this was starting to get dangerous in a different way.
    "Please sir, I can't!"
    He suddenly didn't look so pleasant.
    "Were you threatened to not talk about it to a guard?"
    "NO!"
    She may have protested too strongly.  He gave her a disbelieving look.
    "You don't have to be afraid, no human is immune to the kobold abuse laws.  Just tell me the name."
    "Please sir, it was a long time ago and it never happened again.  I just wanna forget about it."
    He kept giving her that look for a few seconds, then nodded.
    "Alright, if you aren't willing to name the guilty, I won't press you.  Feel free to forget about it."
    "Thank you sir."
    He helped her off the ground, then bent over and picked up the collar he had taken off when she started her panic attack.  He held it out to her.
    "Can I take you home like this, or will you need another way to travel?"
    Kliz wanted to ask him to hold her hand home, but this probably wasn't a good time.  She put the collar on and held the small chain out to him.
    "I'll be fine sir."
    The stench of her own urine finally got through to her.  She didn't even remember pissing herself.  Looking down, her mother's dress now had a yellowish tint below the cutout all the way to the bottom.  And she had left a small puddle on the floor.  After dodging the terror, and finding out she was probably not likely to ever face that terror, all she could do was feel slightly bad that she had made a mess on the floor.  And on Senna's pants apparently.
    "Sorry about peeing on the floor and you." she said with a sniffle.
    He sighed, gave her a smile she didn't feel he really meant, and said "It's alright.  Now let's get you home."
    The walk home was nowhere near as enjoyable as the walk to the inn.  She didn't feel like some kobold out for a walk with her human husband.  Her dress was dirty and smelled of urine, her paint markings on her face were mostly washed off by her tears, and she was being lead on a leash by a guard.  She felt like a small child being returned to her mother after doing something stupid.  Her mother must have seen her coming from the window, and was out the door before they even got close enough to knock.
    "Kliz!  What are you..."
    She looked at Kliz in her dress, then at the guard.  Kliz was expecting to get screamed at, but instead her mother just threw her hands in the air.
    "Why Kliz?  Why?  Why did you have to pick that dress and that guard?  Couldn't you have chosen someone else or a different dress?  Why did you pick those two?"
    Before she could reply, the guard spoke.
    "Hello to you too Seris."
    "Hello Guardsman Senna.  Let me guess, she's getting three days?"
    Three days?  He told her he was taking her mother!
    "Nah, just a warning.  She managed to punish herself far more than I ever had planned, so no need for it.  If her ritual is tonight, I doubt she has enough time to commit this crime again anyways."
    She felt relief, of course he wouldn't lie to her.  But her mother looked...angry?
    "A warning?"  She was flicking an ear like she had gotten dirt into it.
    "Yes."  Senna folded his arms in front of him.
    "A warning?!"  What was her mother upset about?  Did she want Kliz to spend time in jail?
    "Yes, a warning."  His response to her mother's anger was to give a calm reply.
    "You gave me three days for the exact same thing!"  
    Kliz looked at her mother with surprise, she never knew her mother had spent time in jail.  Senna let his arms drop to his sides.  
    "That's incorrect and you know it.  First off, you only wore green markings with your dress.  Second, you lied when I confronted you about it and led me on a two hour search for an owner you didn't have.  Third, you were twelve at the time.  I arrested you for lying to me and wasting two hours of my time.  I gave you three days for being twelve and pulling a stunt like that."
    Seris still looked angry, but somewhat guilty too.
    "I thought you were gonna give up."
    "I almost thought you put your daughter up to this before we got here, little miss friendly."
    "HEY!"
    He just shrugged, then knelt down and disconnected the small chain from Kliz's collar.
    "You have to admit, the coincidence is pretty strong.  Though those silver rings are new.  Congrats, and good day to you."
    Her mother watched the guard depart, saying "Yes, yes, good day."
    Before she could even start apologizing to her mother for all the trouble and what she did to her dress, her mother cut her off and started shoving her inside the house.
    "Later!  I've already drawn a bath.  When I got home and you weren't here, I figured you would be coming home dirty but I honestly thought it was going to be mud again.  Now hurry up and get clean, you're already going to be late for your ritual and you don't want to anger the Church."
    The washtub was next to the heater stove, and her mother helped her out of the dress.  While scrubbing herself with a wet rag in the warmed but still somewhat tepid water, she asked a question that she had been wondering.
    "Guardsman Senna seen you around in that dress a lot of times?"
    "No, just the once or twice."
    "...little miss friendly?"
    Her mother gave her a dark look.
    "I was trying to come on to every human nearby.  Senna thought it was a funny name.  I didn't think it was so funny.  Less talk, more washing."
    She kept scrubbing, but had to ask.
    "How did he remember that dress?  Wasn't that a long time ago?"
    "Questions!"  Her mother sighed.  "He didn't have to let me keep the dress, but he did.  He said I could keep it if I didn't wear it again until after my ritual.  And I didn't.  After my ritual, I wore the dress and waited until the next time I saw him.  He said it was a very pretty dress.  I thanked him.  Then, right after he turned around and started walking away, I threw a dirt clod at him."
    "MOM!"
    Her mother crossed her arms like the guard had earlier.
    "It was three days in jail, in a chastity belt.  I still feel I was in the right.  Now scrub!"
    Kliz scrubbed.

    *     *     *     *     *

   A while later, and Kliz and her mother were a street away from the local Church building, where Seris had stopped her daughter for a certain talk.  The sun had set, and the streetlamps were mostly lit up by the town guards.
    "Kliz, remember when I said to always be honest with the guards, because you don't want the guards angry with you?"
    "Yes?"
    "Well, that's nowhere near as important as this.  Be very careful about what you say and do when you are inside the church, alright?"
    Kliz just nodded, not really sure what her mother meant.
    "You know how we feel about humans right?"
    She had an idea what her mother was talking about.
    "Well, double that.  Then double that again.  Keep doubling it over and over for days on end.  Until the feeling is so strong you are choking on it.  That's a member of the cloth.  They are beyond obsessed with humans.  They worship humans and everything about humans."
    Kliz remembered her mother keeping her away from the members of the church in the past, saying she didn't want to be around people like that.  She called them cultists.
    "Can't I just do my ritual somewhere else?"
    "Impossible.  The church runs all rituals, and no auction house will take a kobold who hasn't gone through the church first.  They have more power than you can imagine."
    Power, in the human kingdom?  Her mother must have seen the skepticism on her face.
    "Kliz, human laws don't apply inside the church, if the church decides they don't want them to apply.  It's entirely kobold run and controlled, and not even the crown seems willing to tell them otherwise.  I've seen church members call off guards.  I've seen them violate laws in front of guards without punishment or fear."
    The laws didn't apply to them?  How was that even possible?  All members of the church were kobolds.
    "Remember those two things.  They worship humans, and the law does not apply to them.  Do not say or do anything that might even hint that you don't like humans, or don't want to serve a human.  They are completely insane. and you will not pass your adulthood ritual unless they approve of it.  You don't need to be obsessed like them, they only demand that sort of dedication from those seeking to join the church.  You just need to stay polite and friendly.  If you don't know what response they want from you, just smile and try to agree with whatever they say.  Understood?"
    Kliz nodded.  Simple enough.  Be polite, nod, smile, don't pick an argument with anyone.
    Her mother seemed satisf
