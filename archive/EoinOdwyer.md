Name: Eoin O'Dwyer
Face: Most consider looking at him to be slightly unnerving, while he is conventionally attractive. His face is almost always locked in a neutral or apathetic expression, only rarely letting himself gain a slight smile and even rarer is the time when he can be spotted frowning. Leaving those who haven't talked to him feeling rather uncomfortable.
Hair: Raven black hair that is kept slicked back the great majority of the time. Occasionally some of it rests in front of his face when he's in the middle of studying or working on something. An oddity is the white streaks in his hair, with the largest being along the top of his head. Judging by the roots it is the natural color of that area yet there is no explained reason why it looks that way.
Eyes: Indigo, sometimes appearing more blue or purple depending on the lighting he's standing in.
Height: Very tall, Even while still young he was tall but upon hitting his final height he reaches 6 foot, 10 inches, or around 208 cm. Needing to look down at every witch or wizard he speaks too except Hagrid.
Bodytype: While athletic, it is nowhere near to the level of his grandfather. Most of it having come from spending time swimming or from the physical education class. Many expected him to take on the leadership role over Fit Club but it appears he prefers being athletic enough to stay fit but not go much further.
Complexion: Standard dark skinned individual.
Uniform variation: Often prefers formal suits underneath his robes and choose to make small additions to his robe to match his own taste.
Misc: N/A

Voice: Rather slow talking, not especially so but noticeable if you pay attention. Has a deep soothing tone to his voice and very rarely finds himself raising it in front of anyone. He tends to speak respectfully of everyone unless people give him reason not to. A rather noble british accent compared to his family's usual irish tone. Even those he holds disdain for will still be treated with respect, but when speaking of those he cares for he will not utter anything that could be considered disrespectful.
Body language: Confident in his mannerisms and always keeping good posture. Electing to keep his back straight and body facing whoever he's speaking too at the time. If he gets into a prolonged debate or discussion with someone he tends to use his hands while talking, but most of the time they remain working on something or behind his back.
Social: Surprisingly few friends. He tends to keep to himself outside of a few usuals. There is a precious few that he considers true friends and even fewer that he has opened up to deeply, most noteable amongst them are Addie, Maria, and Matthias. Seen in a small group with them when he is being social.
Visibility: Eoin is easy to spot due to his clothing and hair, and just as easy to lose. Due to his tendency to go to places that are normally off limits. He's gotten good at blending into the crowd. Often vanishing in the time between classes to get a quick bit of studying in before showing up just before the next class is about to start.
Engagement: Infrequently, not due to being shy, but just having precious few things to talk about. Occasionally helping others with their studies or allowing people to follow him into the restricted section if they are quiet. Those who would be considered loud and boisterous are avoided by him, citing that it would result in too much theatrics for him to want to be near them. Though similar to his grandfather, if he notices someone by themselves or having a bad day he'll take a few moments to speak to them if they allow it.
Quirks: Just tends to be one of those people that would rather spend time studying or practicing magic than anything else. Routinely saying he intends to work at the Ministry once he graduates.
Things your character wouldn't do: Be openly disrespectful to someone. Often if he feels the need to insult someone he'll use a backhanded compliment instead. He won't let himself stay in an actual argument or fight for very long, knowing where it leads he'll often just walk away once it's starting to get too heated. If followed he'll either use a secret passage to escape or cast confundus by surprise before leaving the area.
Animals: He's fond of most creatures, not going out of his way to befriend every one he finds, but enough that he enjoys studying them and spending time with them for the brief opportunities he gets. 
Misc information that might be useful: Eoin pays attention to everything he hears and sees, even if he doesn't directly acknowledge it in the moment. Often if he hears students in more unfortunate circumstances he'll go out of his way to leave a gift outside of their dorm and leave before he is seen.
