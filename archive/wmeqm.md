#Omori X Basil

>Basil wakes up, groggily. his neck was stiff.
>His bed wasn't normally this uncomfortable, had he fallen onto the floor?
>He rubbed his eyes and his vision cleared. Revealing... Nothing. Just empty white space.
>Panic begins to set in. He quickly begins to whip his head around. Looking for anything at all.
>His eyes eventually stop on a strange scene.
>A laptop, a tissue box, a small notebook, a black cat. And most importantly... Sunny?
>Sunny? sat on the floor, his legs folded beneath him and a collar with a leash around his neck.
>He stared up at Basil silently. A blank expression on his face.
>This Sunny looked quite a bit younger than the present one. But Basil needed help. He wasn't going to turn away from a friendly face.
>"Sunny what's going on? Where are we?" Basil said as he moved towards the sitting boy.
>Omori said nothing. He simply picked up the end of the leash and moved it towards Basil's hand.
>Basil instinctively took the leash in his hand. It took him a second to realize what he was doing. He quickly let go of the leash
>"Sunny! What am I supposed to do with this? Can you please just answer me?"
>Omori said nothing. His gaze was fixed was to the leash. He watched it drop from Basil's hand onto the floor.
>His face unchanged Omori grabbed a kitchen knife, Basil had only just realized he was sitting next to. And stood up.
>He began to advance on Basil
>"Sunny w-what a-are you d-doing?" Basil squeaked out as he began to backpedal.
>Without hesitation Omori kicked Basil in the knee causing him to fall onto his back
>Omori wasted no time in sitting on Basil's chest. With one hand he brought his knife up to Basil's neck, With the other... He held up the end of the leash.
>Seeing no other choice. Basil reached out and grabbed the leash in one hand
>Seemingly satisfied Omori took his knife away from Basil's neck and moved down towards his shorts.
>Omori brought the knife towards Basil's shorts and Basil began to struggle.
>In an instant Basil was pinned by red hands. Completely unable to move
>Now confident that Basil wouldn't squirm. Omori slowly and delicately cut through the fabric of his shorts.
>He quickly ripped off the shredded shorts when he was done. and begun work on Basil's underwear
>Soon Basil's manhood was exposed. No longer worried about any knife accidents, the red hands retracted and Basil could move freely once again.
>Omori ran his soft delicate hands across Basil's cock until it was completely hard
>Basil's face was completely red. He held his hands in front of his eyes the entire time Omori worked.
>He spread his fingers slightly and saw the grinning face of Omori. His knife pointed at one of Basil's hands. The one with the leash hanging loosely from it.
>Without knowing what else to do. Basil moved his hand back and tugged lightly on the collar.
>Omori moved his face towards the head of Basil's cock in response. Seems he was on the right track
>Omori opened his mouth and began to breathe on Basil's cock. Just inches away from swallowing it.
> Basil couldn't handle the teasing anymore. He pulled his hand back as hard as he could
>Omori swallowed five out of seven inches in response.
>Basil had begun to panic. He may have gone too far. Omori was still gripping the knife hard.
>Omori bobbed his head up slightly to breathe but didn't take his mouth away.
>Basil was frozen in shock. Omori glared up at him. Unmoving. He wanted Basil to do most of the work it seemed.
>Basil tugged on the collar once again and Omori swallowed his entire length in response.
>He moved his mouth back up, swirling his tongue around as he went.
>Basil's was biting on his knuckle with his free hand in an a futile attempt to stifle his moans
>After a few more leash yanks. Basil was close.
>He did his best to warn Omori but the only sound to come out of his mouth were a series of incoherent moans.
>That seemed to get the message across however.
>Omori removed his mouth from Basil's cock. Instead he ran his tongue along the head.
>Letting out one final high pitched moan. Basil came directly onto Omori's face and collapsed onto the floor spent.
>Omori used his hand to clean his face before licking it clean. Ignoring the box of tissues behind them.
>He cuddled up next to Basil and the two drifted off.
>When Basil awoke. Omori was sitting on his chest. Staring down at him. His shorts around his legs.
>...Today was going to be a long day.
