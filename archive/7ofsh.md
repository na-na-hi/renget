#First Test - Yui

"You're late Sagara-san. We'll discuss your truancy after class. For now, you may take a seat and start the exam."

Yui unceremoniously snatches a test sheet from Rosethorn's desk and trudges toward her seat, sneering at any students she catches curiously glancing at her.

She lazily answers the questions and even begins to skip over some when they start repeating. There were only so many ways she could say she wasn't going to strangle a civilian. Not that anyone would believe her.

Unintentionally, her lack of care produces a level of honesty that couldn't be pried out of most people without a mind-reading quirk. It wasn't likely to earn her higher than a C, though.

As the last few minutes tick down, she comes across the final question: 'Why did you decide to be a hero?'

Her already sour expression worsens as it reminds her of the painful truth that she hadn't chosen any of this. Still. she had to write something...

A sickening crunch is heard as Yui's head collides with the nose of a boy a few years older than her, causing blood to gush out and cover both of them.

"Fuck! You crazy bitch!"

He tries to throw her off but the red, ribbon-like appendage wrapped around his neck ensures that she won't be going anywhere as long as it remains. Though, his prong-like fingertips digging into her skin and delivering a shock earn a pained howl. Her screaming only stops when she bites down on his shoulder. The pain is enough to send the older boy to the ground where they struggle.

As they roll around he continues to shock her while she tightens the ribbon around his neck. Her grip starts to weaken as she's crushed under his weight and spots start to appear in her vision. All she can do is cry hot tears of frustration as she feels herself slip away.

*Meow*~

The soft, sweet sound pierces through the haze of anger, pain, and exhaustion that clouds her mind and reenergizes her. The ribbon tightens as she shrieks like a banshee and her opponent starts to spasm from the electricity being channeled through it. Finally, he goes limp.

After catching her breath, Yui picks herself up and shambles over to the cause of this brawl â€” a small kitten with patches of singed fur.

The young girl practically pounces on the creature with her remaining energy and hugs it tightly against her chest.  Red strands emerge from her ginger tips and bind together to make a fresh ribbon, which she tears off and uses to tie a bow around the kitten's neck.

"I saved you, so you're mine now, okay?"

The kitten only meows in response while rubbing against her bruised cheek.

"Good. We can't let assholes like that decide our fate. You and I...We're going to choose our future, together!"

"Time's almost up. Finalize your answers and prepare to hand in your exams."

Yui hurriedly scribbles her answer down while grumbling something. When Rosethorn sat down to grade the exams, she'd find a selfish yet honest answer:

'*To feed my cat.*'
