-> **discourse opinions** <-

-> anyone who claims to have a da or irl is wrong. <-
-> you aren't special for refusing to admit you're fictionkin. instead you're just mocking people with actual psychosis. <-

-> queer is still a slur. don't use it or any other slurs on people you don't know. <- 

-> aro/ace people aren't inherently lgbtq. <- 
-> yes they should still have their own spaces. <-
-> but, lack of representation doesn't equal discrimination. <-

-> words have meanings. mspec lesbians aren't really lesbians. just say bi or pan. <- 

-> men can't be lesbians! <-
-> pronouns don't equal gender, so he/him lesbians are perfectly fine. <- 
-> transmasc people can also be lesbians if they so choose. but MEN cannot be lesbians. <- 

-> the r-slur cannot be reclaimed. <- 
-> again don't use slurs on people you don't know. <- 

-> tonetags don't help everyone. <- 
-> read [this](https://rentry.co/tonetagging). <- 

-> stop using functioning labels. they don't help anyone.  <- 

-> person first language sucks. disabled isn't a dirty word. use it! <-

-> **syscourse opinions (aka facts.)** <- 

-> there is more to osddid than just introjects & "brain friends." <-

-> osddid only forms from repeated childhood trauma & disorganized attachment. <-
-> endogenic systems aren't real. <-

-> alters are parts of one person. treating them otherwise is just encouraging dissociation. <-

-> functional multiplicity isn't an end stage of healing. final fusion is the only true recovery. <-
-> alters don't die. fusion isn't a bad thing. <-

-> child parts aren't literal children <-

-> you can't have just one part that's abusive. if one part is, all of you is. you are not separate people. <-
-> just because you have did, you don't have an excuse for being a shit person. <-

-> persecutors are just traumatized. locking up alters won't solve anything. <-

-> typing quirks have absolutely nothing to do with osddid. <-

-> if something would be weird for someone without osddid to do, it's still weird for you. <-

-> i do not believe most people online who claim osddid actually have it. <-

-> read [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRQX1FJfWD6RKWTc6Hdcq2H5L3rlIUlOCwiJBQ8Vb48/edit), and [this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zEqDnO60EplWatv8GwHNMwa3r3HaT-f8NeU8M_GxKY/edit). <-
