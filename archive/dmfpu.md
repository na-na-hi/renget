You feel the now-familiar throbbing in your temple starting up again as you stare at the text from your friend. You blink, checking to see if you misread, but the words on the screen remain the same.

"Anon?" Eleazar's voice jerks you out of your thoughts, and acknowledge the magus before standing up. Ethan never had any problem with directions before, so there must be something going on. You tell Eleazar to get the towel out of the bathroom while you head out into the hallway, and the magus gives you a bow and turns to head off without a word.

At least he won't be completely naked once you bring your friend in. 

As soon as you open the apartment door, you catch sight of him; an athletically-built young blond man is pacing up and down the hallway and turning his head frantically back and forth to peer at the numbers on the doors on either side. You call out to him as he approaches, but he walks right past without even acknowledging you. When his eyes glance your way, it's like they're looking right through you. 

Well, that's weird. 

You step out of the room to follow behind him, grabbing his shoulder and calling out his name again. Then you have to jerk backwards as Ethan lets out a yell and takes a swing at you, and you barely dodge his flailing fist. “What the fuck, Anon? Where the hell did you come from?” 

From your apartment, you tell him with a roll of your eyes. You turn to point at your open door, but have to blink and try to clear your vision as it swims and involuntarily slides past the entryway to the wall beside it. Something really fucky is going on in your apartment, but you can’t think of any cause for it. The only thing different from yesterday is that you’ve brought Eleazar home. 

Eleazar. A supposedly really powerful magus. One that can bend space to his whim to make your small shower fit the both of your comfortably. 

“Yo, Anon, you okay?” Ethan is staring at you, one brow raised in a familiar expression of mixed concern and irritation; the same look he’d give you every time he found you slumped on your college dorm’s common-room couch after yet another coffee-fueled all-night study session. 

With a wave of your hand you tell him you’re fine, and ask what he’s doing.

“What, I can’t come check up on you? It’s been a couple months, man, and you’ve practically fallen off the face of the Earth.” He gives you a grin and a hearty smack on the back, and you feel a smile tug at your lips. Ethan’s one of the few friends you made in college, and one of the even fewer you kept in touch with after graduation—it helped that you had the luck to be roommates with him all four years, and had gotten to know the boisterous guy pretty well in that time—so you have to admit that it is good to see him. Before you can lose yourself too much in reminiscence, you give him a grin of your own while lightly punching at his chest, and ask what he’d been planning to drag you into this time. “Eh, maybe grab some grub and go see a movie or something. I know you like more chill stuff when we hang out. But I think we got a little problem you might wanna solve first.” He jerks his thumb in the direction he probably thinks your apartment door should be. “Is this some kind of Other shit, or what?” 

Oh, right. 

You tell Ethan that you got a new roommate—that’s the easiest way to explain Eleazar without going into what happened at the slave auction last night—and grab his arm to lead him into the apartment. It takes all of your concentration to focus on the doorway, but you finally both step through to find Eleazar waiting for you. 

“I brought the towel you requested, Anon.” He holds it out to you, not making a single move to cover his shame. He looks from you to Ethan, the lights in his eye sockets darting down to where you’re holding the other human’s arm, and then tilts his head. “Who is this?” 

“Name’s Ethan. And I guess you’re Anon’s roommate?” Ethan looks nonplussed—being part of the football team in high school and college meant he saw a lot of naked men in the locker room--but he still holds up one hand to block the sight of Eleazar’s bare lower body while offering the other to shake. Eleazar gives you another glance, seemingly asking for approval, and then tentatively moves to grasp and shake your friend’s hand. 

That’s right, Eleazar Dread-something, you say as you quickly yank the towel out of the magus’ grasp and wrap it around his hips.

“Just Eleazar, much like you are just Anon, Master.” You can’t shake the feeling that the magus is teasing you a little bit. 

“Uh, right. Did I come at a bad time?”

Not at all, you say when you finally get Eleazar’s wardrobe situation sorted. You ignore your friend looking from you to the magus and back again with a raised eyebrow, and tell him that you were actually just about to make breakfast. A little bit embarrassed, you gesture to the meager ingredients you were going to attempt to turn into an omelet.

“Well then, good thing I caught you, dude. We can head on out and get something together.” That sounds like a plan to you; if he doesn’t mind stopping by a few stores so you can pick up some groceries and maybe get some clothes for your roommate to wear.

“Yeah, alright. There a reason he doesn’t have anything, though?”

Before you can think up a plausible answer, Eleazar bows deeply and speaks. “Young Master Anon, in his beneficence, saw fit to purchase me from last night’s Auction, though I had been stripped of all I own.”

You could probably hear a fly fart in the awkward silence that follows the magus’ words.

With a bit of a stammer, you go into a rough explanation of everything that’s happened since last night. Meeting Aldrich and ‘buying’ Eleazar. Trying to get the magus settled into his new life on this side and teach him about modern technology. Of course, you leave out the part about taking a shower with the magus, but can’t shake the feeling that your blushing is giving away that something went on between you two. Once you finish, Ethan lets out a thoughtful hum. “Well, alright then.” He shrugs; thankfully, he’s one of the acquaintances you have that doesn’t really care about what the Others get up to, so the matter doesn’t seem to be of much concern to him. “I’m guessing you want him to tag along, then?” 

Well, of course, you say. Though a pointed look from Ethan reminds you of Eleazar’s lack of clothes to wear while you take him out to find clothes for him to wear; a classic catch-22. You ask Eleazar where he stashed his loincloth—if nothing else, you can run it through the washer and dryer real quick—and the magus’ eyes flare as he gestures with one hand. He seems to be drawing invisible whirls and shapes with the tip of his finger, and then he holds his hand out to catch the cleaned and neatly-folded cloth as it drops into his palm. 

“Shall I dress myself in preparation for our outing, Anon?”

You and Ethan both stare at the magus, your mouths hanging open. When you nod, still speechless, Eleazar tosses the towel around his waist aside and flourishes his loincloth. A fresh scent wafts from the fabric as he winds it around his crotch and ties it off at his left hip. Once that’s done, he gives you another low bow. “Is my appearance sufficient?” 

Well, you suppose you can say goodbye to using the apartment complex’s crappy rip-off of a laundromat.

You clear your throat. He looks good, you say while elbowing Ethan in the side to break your friend out of his own stupor. Eleazar seems to puff up a little bit at your praise, his sinuous tail swaying behind him, and you can’t keep a slight smile off of your face. Looks like you’re ready to head out.

“Uh, yeah, I guess so.” As you make your way out of, Ethan stares up at the magus, his expression curious and intrigued. “Yo, uh, Eleazar was it? What else can you do?”

----- 

Breakfast is, all things considered, uneventful. Eleazar receives more than a few odd looks as he follows you and Ethan down the stairs and out of the complex, nodding or giving the occasional short answer to the human. Ethan seems to be really interested in the magus and what exactly he can do, which—from what little of their conversation you listen in on, seems to be just about anything. That prideful tone slips back into Eleazar’s voice as he describes a few of the feats that had raised him up to the higher echelons of his Order, but when Ethan starts asking for details about his society the magus becomes shy and evasive once more. 

Ethan leads you to a nice little diner, where your group settles in to continue your conversation while waiting on your meal. While Eleazar looks over the menu with ravenous curiosity, you try to suggest things he might like and Ethan just orders a massive plate for himself and you. Once the food arrives and you three dig in, you learn quite an interesting fact about Eleazar—the magus apparently has a massive sweet tooth. He picks idly at his eggs and accepts to try some of your bacon, but the pancakes on his, yours, and Ethan’s plates disappear faster than you can blink. 

“Well, can’t blame him. This place does make the best pancakes,” Ethan says, trying to hide his disappointed scowl at having the fluffy treats stolen from him. Eleazar gives you both an apologetic bow from his seat, stammering out that he couldn’t help yourself, but you just sigh and gave the magus a pat on the shoulder while telling him it’s alright; at least you have an idea of what to feed him now.

With your stomachs full and a couple of hours to burn before the matinee starts, you decide it’s time to get Eleazar some actual clothes. While you don’t exactly mind him walking around the apartment naked—not that you’d say such a thing out loud, especially with Ethan present—the stares and whispers of from nearly every passerby as you three walk together down the sidewalk are starting to make you uncomfortable. Eleazar doesn’t seem to take any notice, however; he keeps his head held high as he follows you, arms clasped behind his back. It’s easy to imagine the magus clad in long, flowing robes while striding down the candlelit halls of some ancient castle. 

You’re shaken out of your musings when Ethan prods your shoulder. He gives you a look, but you just wave away his concern as you lead your little group into the nearest clothing store. You thank your lucky stars that they have a section for Others, and nod your thanks to the horned shop assistant as he leads you to it. It takes a while and more than a little time in the fitting room, but you finally manage to find some shirts in Eleazar’s size—ranging from a few t-shirts, to a nice button-down you insist on, to a couple of muscle shirts Ethan recommends. Add in a few extra loincloths in patterns Eleazar picks out himself—he insists that they’re more comfortable than any of the available pants, especially around his tail—and the magus’ wardrobe seems complete.

Well, nearly complete.

As you make your way to the registers, Eleazar stops dead in his tracks next to the coats. He seems to be captivated by a long, flowing overcoat, reaching out to finger the material almost nostalgically. When you ask, he answers that it reminds him of the robes he once wore back in Eyghlewhyn, before he was cast into slavery.

Even this out of season it isn’t the cheapest thing on the receipt, but the delighted flaring of Eleazar’s eyes as he strides out of the shop, the bottom of his new coat brushing against his ankles and his hands curiously exploring the pockets at the fitted waist more than makes up for it. The magus cuts an impressive figure, so different from the bound, chained, and broken slave he’d been just the night before. 

Finally, it’s movie time. Ethan chats with you about it as he leads the way; apparently, he’d been looking forward to this movie for a long time, and thought you might enjoy it as well. Eleazar seems intrigued by the thought of ‘scrying’ giant monster fights, and follows eagerly behind once you’ve bought your tickets. Ethan passes on getting any snacks for the movie, but you want to give Eleazar the full movie theater experience; he tries a little bit of popcorn before spitting it out politely into a napkin, and you can almost read the disgust on his skeletal face as his jaw works and the lights in his eye sockets flicker. The soda, however, is another story—a straw doesn’t really work with his lack of lips, so you take the lid off of his cup to let him lap at the bubbling liquid like a dog. And lap he does, once he gets over his reticence at trying the “odd concoction” and takes a taste of the “delicious ambrosia”.

Sweet tooth confirmed.

Eleazar continues following you like a puppy as Ethan leads you to the theater, chooses the seats for you three, and you all settle in. The magus is surprised by the sudden dimming of the lights and presses against you, but a reassuring pat on the forearm and a few quiet words make him relax. You ignore another raised eyebrow and smirk from Ethan as you lean against Eleazar in return, watching as the movie begins.

-----
You stretch and let out a long sigh as you make your way out of the theater, listening to Eleazar and Ethan chatting excitedly.
“Simply amazing! And when they-!“
“I know, right? I can’t believe they-“ 
You let out a soft laugh, and turn to look up into Eleazar’s glowing eyes when he sets a hand on your shoulder. “To bear witness to such things—I could hardly believe it was a scrying. Were I unable to feel the fire and magic myself, I would swear it was happening before me.” 
Ethan pipes up. “By the way, what do you mean by ‘scrying’?”  
It takes a little while but, as you make your way back towards the apartment, you and Ethan reassure Eleazar that what he saw wasn’t real. No, giant monsters like the ones in the movie aren’t real, as far as you know—though the fact that Eleazar seemed to recognize a few of them is mildly concerning. No, the city it took place in hasn’t been destroyed and rebuilt. Yes, the humans in the movie were all actors. It finally seems to click when you describe it as a play, but on a much, much larger scale.

“I see. In Eyghlewhyn, such scryings would take the work of multiple magi. To think that humans have accomplished such feats using their technology, and with fiction alone.” He shakes his head. “Master Anon, when first you bought me I knew not what to expect. But you have shown me such wonders that I must consider my servitude to you a blessing from the Source itself.” As he speaks, he squeezes your shoulder and earnestly locks gazes with you. You can feel your face grow warm as you look up into the brightly-shining lights in the deep shadows of his eye sockets, and you can only stutter out something about not calling you ‘Master’.
“Hey, what about me, dude?” Ethan chimes in, crossing his arms with a playful snort. “The movie was my idea.” 
Eleazar flinches and blinks, and then turns to give Ethan a deep bow. “Of course you have my gratitude as well, Ethan.” 
“No prob, man. Now, you said something about getting groceries, Anon?”

Oh, right. 

Luckily, you’re able to find a supermarket with a small Other friendly section, where everything’s labeled safe or toxic to humans and vice-versa. Eleazar’s eyes light up as you take him through the aisle, the magus choosing this or that strange bit of fruit or bag of oddly-shaped nuts. You also make a stop at the soda aisle, picking up a bottle or two, and head down the cereal aisle while making sure to look out for anything labeled toxic to Others. Eleazar barely conceals the disgust in his voice when you make a mention of milk—“Do humans truly find pleasure in drinking the milk of lesser animals? How can that be palatable, Anon?”—and so you grab a carton of almond milk instead. 

“Dude, you’re forgetting the most important thing.” Ethan beams as he holds up a few six-packs of beer. “Since we’re already hanging out, wanna make this a night?” It’s been a while since you just chilled out with Ethan, drinking beer and playing videogames together, so you eagerly agree. A few more boxed meals and some lunch meat for you, and you’re good to go. 

It would be easy to carry all the groceries back to the apartment between you three, but Eleazar has something else in mind. He tells both you and Ethan to gather in close against him, and you feel the heat in your cheeks again as you’re pressed up against both the magus’ firm chest and Ethan’s own athletic form. In a flash of blinding light you’re home again, and the bags of groceries are set out on the floor of the kitchenette waiting to be put away.

Ethan staggers and you have to catch him—no small feat, considering how much more built he is than you. “Fuck, dude, what the hell was that?”

Oh, right, Eleazar can teleport. You give the magus a smile, and he preens a little bit.

“Dude, sweet!” Ethan smiles broadly and nods his thanks as he rights himself with your help. When you glance over to Eleazar again, you notice the magus quickly looking away from you and your friend.

“May I help with anything, Anon?”

With Eleazar’s help, it doesn’t take any time at all to get everything in its place —the groceries literally fly onto the shelves and into the fridge as his eyes pulse and flash and his clawed hands glow. Ethan just stands by, watching in amazement and already cracking open a beer. Once you’re done, your friend hands you an opened bottle for yourself, and you take a nice swig of your own sweet ambrosia. “So, dude, you still got your old 360? I’m guessing you still haven’t upgraded, have you.”

No, you tell him. You cover your embarrassment by saying all the good vidya is on the older consoles, and he clinks his bottle against yours with a nod.

“Vid… ya?” 

You and Ethan both turn to look at Eleazar, seeing the magus cocking his head as he looks from Ethan to you and back again. The grin returns to your friend’s face as he walks over and slings an arm over what he can of the magus’ bulky body; you notice that Eleazar stiffens a bit at the gesture, and can’t help a small surge of schadenfreude at  someone else getting a dose of all the touchy-feely stuff that’s suddenly started happening to you. “If you thought that movie was amazing, you haven’t seen anything yet, El.”
