->A Whore in Church<-
Yoru Heinard walks awkwardly for once, her purple hair done in a simple high ponytail on this particuler Sunday.  Usually her twin tuft style was her go to, but today was a day she dreaded.  The Prideful Preacher, Yoji had been INSISTING she come to church for weeks.  He'd left flyers for small groups, leaflets, approached on her way out of the cafe, during her work at the cafe(When she was teasing one of her regulers no less!).  Today was the day she shut him up and just sat through this.  
Apperently, Yoji had connections with women who seemed just as prudish and sexless as him that had brought "proper" church clothes for Yoru and would make sure she actually showed up.  Both looked almost identical, with short black hair and maxi skirts paired with long sleeved blouses to cover their bodies.  Yoru herself was coaxed into a white, knee length pinafore dress with a pastel yellow blouse under it that covered all her best features.  She may as well be wearing a burkha, and the voices which drove her agreed.  Were one of the women not practically dragging her along she would have just torn it all off and walked back to the library in her lingerie.  Even her shoes were normal black flats without a heel to speak of, revealing how short Yoru was.

The church was bustling with people who were at best middle-aged, all dressed in uniforms of conformity with only the slightest variation.  Some children who played on their parents phones or teens that were sucked into their own were around: They immedietly watch Yoru as she passes, her purple hair standing out in a see of black and brown.  She seated between the two women, who deign to engage her in chatter.
"Isn't the building just beautiful?  Its been here since the 60's from what I've heard"
"This must be a lot to take in, so just follow how we do the sacraments, okay?"
Yoru wanted to scream obsenities only held back by staring some younger church goers who dared to show a small amount of cleavage.  She chooses to simmer with her voices screaming at her pounce on the seemingly single woman and use her eyes to lead her to room at the library and take some frustration from this whole affair out on her.

Yoji Ryoshi composes himself as his congregtion mingles, watching the lines between in shades amicable green.  Some had lines of hidden red animosity over petty squabbles, a common thing amongst the urbanites which flocked to church's as a way to deal with problems in their life rather than the community he and his brothers and sisters in Christ offered.
His usual snooping picked out Yoru immedietly: Black lines of hatred spilling out of her to even building itself.  She fidgets and looks around like a paniced squirrel, biting her lip, and seeming to lose patience by the moment.  Momoko and Kaori had at least managed to dress her respectfully without one of them being seduced, so it seems she beleived his badgering would stop after this one visit.  Still, it was clear this was not the derpaved sort of pain she craved, with the usual churchgoers gossiping about her dyed hair.
He approaches with tact and gentleness, greeting Yoru's escorts and looking toward the lust-cursed girl: "Thank you for coming, Heinard-san.  I assure you that whatever has been haunting you will be quieter after today" he says, trying not to be smug over his well-planned rehabilitation.

"Shut up, dickless prude!  I'm not haunted!" Yoru says to Momoko and Kaori's shock
"How rude!  If your not going to say something nice to Ryoshi-san than at least keep quiet"
"And so loud too?  Where is your shame at acting so childishly"

Yoji gives a mock sigh of frustration toward the living embodiment of excess: "Heinard-san... please, I just ask you attend service this once.  Would it help if you were sitting alone?" he says, trying isolate her from any victims.
"If I sit through this you'll never bother me about me again?  No more "pray away the gay" pamphlets or propanda to try and turn me into a blue-pilled sheep?" 
"I promise to God himself"
Yoru lets herself be re-seated in a pew in the back, she looks at Yoji as he leaves to prepare the elements of communion: "Hey... after this we should find a _nice_ secluded spot so I can confess _all_ my sins"
Yoji avoids her eyes, having talked with the Librarian enough to know how dangerous looking at Yoru can be when she's clearly desperate to please the demons of corruptive desire that plauge her: "Perhaps if your clothes stay on and you speak more reverently of those above you"
"You think your better than me?  When I could have wrapped around my finger and streetwalking in an afternoon!?" She hisses.
"I have control over my own mind and body: You are the puppet of demons which have debased you into sex-crazed victim of your own lacking inhibitions.  Your eyes are what grant you your supposed power, and I know you still are not so far gone as to publicly stab me"
Yoru rummages through the purse she brought, looking for Thunder Lance: the priest grabs her wrist before she can bring the weapon sparking to life.
"I want to _help_ you: You can either accept that you have a _problem_ or keep living until you do something _extreme_ enough to get you killed" He says, hiding his pride in how well-engineered his social attack has been behind a seeming shedding of his mask.

Yoru's heart flutters for a moment as the priest grabs her hand, her dataslate falling onto the floor and showing is seal: A photo of her with two of her with Mari looking down on her.  He wasn't strong, angry, or loud as Mari could be when she was serious, but her demons were giving all sorts of ideas.  This could a slow corruption of him, gaining his trust and then making him realize the joys of unrestrained pleasure, or even another person with an attitude to be a dom to her since so few could say no to her when she offered a good time.

She quivers with pent-up desire and blushes with feigned innocence toward Yoji as he keeps touching her wrist: "Okay... just for today though~" She says with a wink, keen on playing a tsundere so he keeps having to be aggressive with her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoji looks down toward his hand, and releases it, noticing a distinct pink line of lust.  It was thin... for now, but would likely get thicker and brighter if he looked toward her and exposed himself to her powerful eyes.  

This... was not the plan.  But it was better than her just leaving and never getting help.  He leaves her to find some solace in his duties, taking short glances Yoru's way: she kicked her feet like a lovesick schoolgirl despite while swaying her head.  Hopefully she could actually hear his sermonizing in between her digusting fantasies.  He notices most of the congregation seem to avoid her gaze except the children, either out of awkwardness in the case of the teal lines and a slight degree of green disgust toward her non-traditional hair and previous outburst.  At the very least, Yoru herself didn't seem to care about those feeling toward her.

Hinako watches Yoru in her lingerie as she makes out with her own doll, its wrists tied with red rope to the backbaord of her bed.
"..And then I thought it might be nicer to see if Mr. Prudish Priest would take the initaitve himself so I'm looking for one of those flagellation whips so he can help me be _cleansed_ of _sins_" the purple haired girl says as she sits up.
"Why not use your reversal eye and have him wear a nun outfit too?" Hinako says with a giggle.
"I want him to dom me, not to see him lust over himself as a well-endowed holy woman" 
"Oh.. I see"

Yoru stretches out, tilting her head when realizes Hinako is recording her with her own data slate: "P-Puff your chest out again... Yoru-chan, I need some referance photos"
"Oh~"
"Why don't I get the tripod so you can have footage to play back for all the special features on my next commission?"
Hinako blushes intensely: "Mari won't like it if she hears about you sleeping around again..."
"Oh come on... She's at her best when she stops trying to be all quiet and considerate.. when the beastly side of her gets to lash out.." Yoru says, quivering a bit.
"Besides, its almost midnight.... I don't want to waste my demons ideas..." she says, licking her lips and looking longingly at Hinako.
