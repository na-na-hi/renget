"Get your hands off me you… Nngh! You loathsome brute!" 

"Shut it, lizard!" 

With force, the green-scaled reptile was pushed unceremoniously onto the bed in front of him. He turned around, shooting the human a mean scowl, his claws gripping the edge of the mattress with fury, threatening to break the cloth. 

This did not deter the man in the slightest.

He sauntered forth, looking immensely pleased with the sight before him. "Your manners could use some work, *lizard*." He said, treating the last word as if it was a curse. He reached out his hands, gliding down the creatures back, all the way to the protruding ridges near his waist. 

"Someone needs to put you in your place… and don't worry, I'll happily be the one to do it."

The lizard snapped back, baring his teeth in anger. "As if I would ever let you-"

"Quiet!"

The human screamed, his calm demeanor only returning to him once he saw the creature's hushed face. 

"You know what happen if I tell the others that you've been acting up… Right?"

The lizard gulped.

"Ah, so you do know. Good, good." The human's smile returned. A wicked sight if the lizard ever saw one. "Now, why don't we drop the tough guy act, and just skip to the part where you do what I say, shall we?" 

"...Fine." 

"I'm sorry, what was that?"

"I said fine!" The lizard repeated, through clenched teeth. 

"That's more like it. Now, give me just a moment."

The human's hands were finally off the lizard's back, but it was a brief respite. The next thing he heard was undressing: the fiddling of clothes, followed by the metallic sounds of a belt unbuckling. 

And just like that, he was right back behind him. Naked.

"Lizard?" The human said, his voice brimming with smug confidence. He didn't need to hear the creature answer him, he knew he was listening.

"Why don't you lift up that nice tail of yours, and let me see what you're hiding back here, hmm?" 

Wordlessly, the Lizard obeyed. Lifting his tail slowly at the human's command.

"Ohh… Excellent." And the human wasn't lying. It was indeed a breathtaking sight. 

The usual dark-green hue of scales that the lizard carried turned into a softer, milkier hue under his tail. And of course, its shape was worthy of note as well. The lizard was no slouch, clearly. His rear was of well defined shape. Firm, but with just the right amount of fat. 

His eyes moved lower. Towards the two hefty orbs that hung between his thighs. They moved gracefully with every slight movement the lizard made. And right below those, was his length. It was big, bigger than the human's own, but he would never admit it. It was pink and quite healthy. With an impressive girth that tapered off to a fine point near the tip. But those details didn't matter, he wouldn't be using it at the moment. 

The human stepped forward, once again reaching his hand out. The texture of his rump was… Different. Pleasantly different. Instead of the rougher scales of his back, which were likely for protection, the ones here were smoother, softer. It more closely resembled the feel of well-worn leather than anything else. How utterly wonderful.

And this was just the beginning. The human then bent down, reaching for something underneath the bed. After coming back up, the lizard noticed the bottle in his hand. A clear, viscous substance that could only be one thing, considering the situation.

The human leaned down, and whispered into the creature's ear. "Just know, lizard, I am not using this for your sake. This is for my own pleasure, and nothing more. Consider it an inadvertent mercy for you."

He growled at the human. It was deep, throaty, and was as menacing as the lizard could muster. 

The human paid it no mind. 

Instead he opened the bottle, letting the liquid settle on his pointer finger before going down into what excited him the most the second the lizard lifted his tail. His tailhole. A pliable, inviting thing that was just begging to be played with.

His finger slid it without issue, but that didn't surprise him. What did, however, was the quiet moan that was sure he heard escaping the lizard's mouth as he entered him. 

Was he… enjoying this? No, that would be too rich. Surely he wasn't but… that noise was unmistakable. Choosing to say nothing about it, he made a mental note and continued getting the lizard's hole wet and ready for him. Removing his finger, he then got himself into position.

He took one last look at the lizard's rear before beginning. What a tantalizing sight this was. This creature was bigger than him in every way. Stronger too. And yet here he was. Legs spread, tail lifted high, and his hole wet and leaking, ready for entry. It was nice to appreciate when life gave you moments like these. Without further pause, he aligned himself with the lizard and thrust himself forth. 

Ohh, how delightful this creature felt! Tight, warm, familiar… It was everything the human had hoped for, truly. And yet, somehow, even better than this, was the lizard himself. The sounds he was making in particular.

They were moans. So he hadn't been just hearing things earlier. 

"Mmm…" The human began. "You dirty little lizard. You're enjoying this, aren't you?" He said, plunging back into the lizard once more, earning another moan from him, although this time, it was muffled. A poor attempt at hiding it, honestly.

Fine. He'd just have to turn things up a notch. He grabbed the lizard's waist firmly, before once again burying himself within the lizard's warm insides, this time with a  notably stronger force. 

"Mmph!!" The lizard let out, unable to contain it this time. He couldn't help it. 

The human was speechless, but a smile was plastered over his face. He was sure he even saw the lizards long, clawed toes curl as well. He didn't like this, he loved it.

"Well! I was going to tell you to bite something and bear it, but it looks like I won't need to!" The lizard didn't talk at all while the human mocked him. 

"Hard to believe you were giving me all that backtalk earlier, isn't it? I mean really, what type of si-" The human's speech was cut short when he felt the lizard push his rear back against him. 

The creature had picked himself up. Rather than being laid down on the bed with his rear and tail held high, he was level now, his hands planted firmly on the mattress. To say the human was caught off guard would be an understatement.

Another wave of pleasure was sent through him suddenly: the lizard pushing himself onto his cock once again. 

"Stop… talking…" The lizard said through huffs. "And keep… going…" The human was too intrigued to argue with him.

He placated the lizard for a time, thrusting in rhythm with him, and over time, the lizard began to pick up the pace. 

"You were… right…" The lizard muttered under his breath. The human didn't have time to question him before he kept speaking. 

"I'm an evil creature… I need to be… put in my… place…" 

Without warning, the lizard sped up once again. And this time, it was hard for the human to match up with him. 

"I need to be put in my place… by a big, strong human like… like you…" The lizard was breathing heavier now, and with more force. His eyes were closed as well.

The lizard was really getting into it, the human noticed. And suddenly, he didn't feel quite as in control as he was mere minutes ago.

"Do it…" The lizard pleaded, pushing back once again, even harder this time. "Put me in my place, human… Do it…" 

Even faster now, practically frantic. The human felt himself getting pushed back. 

"Do it…"

It was impossible at this point for the human to keep up with the frenzied pace the lizard was setting. 

"Do it." 

The lizards breathing became hectic at this point. He was very obviously lost in pleasure, there was no doubt. At this point the human was sure he was-" 

"Do it!" The lizard practically screamed. He let out one final moan before completely drenching the bed and some of the floor in thick, hot lizard seman. A remarkable load to be sure. 

The lizard was in ecstasy. And his post-orgasm bliss was such that he completely ignored the pokes on his shoulder from the human. It was only when he heard his name that he broke out of his daze. 

"Nenat!" The human shouted, and the lizard turned back, all too aware of why his name was being called.

After all, he did just cum all over his boyfriend's bed with no warning. 

The human's expression was now visably different than before. A happy, genuine smile could be seen upon his face, and his eyes, full of love for the verdent green reptile in front of him. Nenat just smiled sheepishly in response.

"Ahh, Sorry about the mess, Henry. Looks like I got a little carried away at the end there…"

A snicker from the human. "A little? I almost lost my balance with how hard you were pushing me back!" He joked, taking a seat on one of cleaner parts of the bed as Nenat twisted himself to sit beside him. 

"I'll admit, I'm a bit surprised. I know you said were into this but man, that was something else." 

Unexpectedly the next thing Henry felt wasn't a playful punch on the shoulder like he usually got when he teased his boyfriend. Instead it was two strong arms wrapped around his waist as Nenat squeezed his snout into the crook of his neck. 

"Thank you for indulging me today." The lizard cooed, planting a gentle kiss on the human's skin. "It means a lot to me, really. I know it's not exactly the most normal thing someone could ask for."

"Nenat, of course." Henry replied, reciprocating the touch by wrapping his own arms around the lizard. Fleshy skin met hard scales, and Henry sighed. He ran his hands down the lizards back, just like he had done earlier, but this time the entire purpose was different. This time he did it to appreciate him. He loved every inch of this lizardman, down to the last scale, chipped or not.  

The roleplay was fun for what it was, but he was already beginning to miss getting to touch him like this, even if it was for just a few minutes. 

"I could never say no to you. Ever." 

"Mmm… You're so sweet." 

They stayed in quiet bliss for a few more moments before Nenat shifts, moving in front of the human before falling over and pinning him softly under him. 

Not one to complain about having large lizards on top of him, Henry stayed quiet. This is, until he noticed Nenat sticking his tounge out. 

A peculiar habit among his species that wasn't hard to catch at all. They would usually stick their tounges out when they were thinking or daydreaming. It made them easier to read and understand, but more importantly, it was cute. 

"What are you thinking about?" 

The lizard just replied with a smirk. "Nothing. Just about how next time it'd be better if you pulled on my tail a bit. That really gets me going." 

Henry just laughed. "Of course that's where your head is at." He reached up and started carresing the lizard's head. The same way one would do to a dog, but with a more personal touch. "Horny lizard."

Nanet stuck his tounge out again. Although this time it was just as a tease. 

"Again, sorry about the bed." 

"Don't worry about it, I'll just change the sheets. I was gonna do laundry next week anyway."

"You should probably get on that now, actually. If you don't the smell of sex and lizard cum will probably just stick to the mattress." 

Henry shrugged. "The wouldn't be so bad. The last part at least." 

"Oh, and *I'm* the horny one?"

"Yes… and I love you for it."

The lizard smiled. "Love you too."

.
.
.
.
.

"But seriously you should change the sheets if were gonna be sleeping here."

"Yeah, yeah, I'm on it."
