###Lliam
>Lliam (Lee-yam), formerly Stargazer, is a Male Meowstic who is the Guildmaster of the Clover Guild. He is a poised, shrewd, though friendly, and an approachable individual. Normally, he has a high level of tolerance when it comes to behaviors regarding and from guild members, but when it reaches the point of hurting others, that's where he draws the line. He does not resort to violence but tries to understand what the matter is and acts accordingly, for his own safety and that of others.
>He tends to be very secretive when it comes to his past. He might refuse to answer questions relating to that matter or outright lie about it. Rarely does he ever tell about his past to anyone, even the guild members.
>On paper, he is one of the strongest in the guild with his overwhelming psychic powers, but due to an incident in the past, he is unable to cast his fullest potential; he can only cast a certain amount of moves before his body can't withstand his high power output anymore, which causes him to faint. This could possibly put him at the bottom of the guild list in terms of power scaling.
>He uses Hoopa's ring, wands, support moves, and items to compensate for his lack of use of his psychic power, however. He tends to be flexible with anything in his arsenal, like combining wands with his support moves, for example. He can use Reflect not only for his allies' protection from heavy attacks, but he could also use it as a mirror for his wand shots. He can still freely use telekinesis as much as he likes as it doesn't take that much from him.
>Though he will use his psychic powers when his life or others that he cares about are in peril, he values his friends/guild members very deeply, even if they tend to be a bit deviant. But to them, it may come off as somewhat of an annoyance and slightly a bit too overprotective, like a mother to her children. Wonder who he took after that from...?

>Interactions:
>When he talks to someone he isn't familiar with or to people he highly respects, he talks very formally, ("Hello!" "Thank you so much!" "I apologize, I'll do better!")
>When he talks to friends and to the guild (that are native to the Pokémon world), he is more lax on the formality with a pinch of snarky response, ("Thanks!" "You're... an idiot! You step on the trap!!" "Then... I'll grab this broom and whack you with it, how 'bout that~?")
>He also acts similarly to the anon-mons but depending on who it is, he may be crude with his 4chan/internet manner of speech at times, ("You guys acted like retards last mission but did good this time, and I'm proud of y'all!" "Oh, you're approaching me? *Insert posing awkwardly*" "Be careful now; you might break that client's item. You know who you are... No dinner for you if that happens, okay~? *proceeds to smile at the terrified members' faces*")
>When confronting enemies, he uses taunting tactics or an aggressive tone depending on the enemy; the stronger the enemy, the more serious he gets, ("Hmhm~ not bad! But can you eat this! (low threat level enemy) "Tch... you're crafty as well, I give you that. (somewhere in between)" "Hey... don't hurt them!!! (high threat level)")
>When he talks to ???

>Backstory (An Adventurer's Journal):
>???

>Backstory (as a human):
>A passionate librarian in the human world He dreams of traveling around the world and meeting new people, but due to the circumstances, he is stuck at his job, day in and day out. Having read the books in the library and played videogames in most of his free time, he daydreams, fantasizing of being part of another world, a world where he is free. He is a quiet, well-mannered individual (in public, anyway). He doesn't have many friends, though it doesn't matter much as he prefers being alone. However, he's not being honest about what he's feeling. What he wanted was... When a certain event happened during his journey in the Pokémon world, he thought that this was his second chance in life, a chance where he could change; turn his life around, and be someone that he always wanted to be: an approachable person. Someone people could count on to be their friend Though despite the efforts, his former self still seeps in when it is not in check.
>(Also no, he isn't really a self-insert, as I'm not a librarian and some other details listed differ from irl.)

>Misc:
>His favorite food was Lava Cake and Pudding, now it's Gold gummies; not like he has a choice anyway! Ever since he found out about the ingredients of his favorite foods in the Pokémon world, he dreams on making those again, at least for once.
>He usually wears a black capelet with a friend bow on his left chest (since he refused to wear it over his head), so he made it into something like a boutonnière with the Clover Guild badge clipped onto it. On the right side, there's a bag with a similar design to a treasure bag, with a hidden gold ring chained behind the bag. Inside the capelet are pockets where he stores extra items like wands, elixers, TMs, etc.
>At the guild office, there are two secret rooms on each side. To open it, he has to do some sequences on the hidden switches around the room, or he could just enter through the gold ring's portal if he feels like it. The left wing's secret room is his bedroom (with no windows as his wardrobe would be blocking it, so he got rid of it). While the right wing's secret room is his personal laboratory (it has windows with blinders to prevent any flying Mon from eavesdropping).
>The lower basement floor is off-limits. No questions asked.
>**Secret**: He may act tough, but he is actually quite fragile. If you pointed out his flaws, he would be very saddened.
>**Secret**: Someone is living in the guildhall that nobody is aware of except for Lliam. 
>**Secret**: He writes letters to someone often and has their familiar Noctowl fly to the guild at night to deliver mail/parcel/allowance.
>**Secret**: His name, Lliam, has a meaning behind it that is related to the plot.
>**Secret**: He is a liar.

>Abilities:
>Keen Eye (An Adventurer's Journal), Prankster

>Moves (Support form):
>Reflect
>Light Screen
>Helping Hand
>Misty Terrain 
>Psychic Terrain (often paired with Psybeam, Psychic, or Expanding Force; counts as two consecutive uses per attack on respective moves)

>Moves (Combat form):
>Shadow Ball (faints after 8 consecutive uses)
>Thunderbolt (an alternative to Shadow Ball; faints after 8 consecutive uses.)
>Psybeam (his usual Psychic attack, faints after 8 consecutive uses)
>Psychic (stronger attack than Psybeam, but after 4 consecutive uses, he will faint.)
>Expanding Force (usually unused; his final attack. He will faint once used.)

###Nick
>Nick, Vulpix (M), Calm
>- One of those people that would've been considered "gifted" as a child, and then burnt out *hard*.
>    - As a human, was stuck in a dead-end job, and felt generally ineffectual.
>    - Views this as an opportunity to do new things that he never had a chance to, but worried he's eventually just going to return to old habits. 
>    - More willing to take risks and do things he previously wouldn't do because of that fact, although only to a point.
>- Very organized, or at least organizedly disorganized.
>- Has a tendency to overthink and overanalyze things.
>- Endlessly fascinated with the world.
>- Relatively new compared to some of the others - arrived in the world a day and a half (the afternoon before) the events of "Gathering".
>- Comes from a TL where Chunsoft, unfortunately, went bankrupt before 2005. While the broader Pokemon series existed, PMD did not, and he had no knowledge of concepts specific to the series upon arrival.
>- **Speech**: Very formal and on guard usually, but willing to be more casual with people as he gets to know them better.
>- **Garb**: Multiple storage options when on an expedition, usually at least a pair of (size-appropriate) saddlebags and a pouch/toolband on his left foreleg. Also usually a blue scarf (kerchief) with a green clover marking.

>Amelia, Shinx (F), Quiet
>- Comes from a small village/tribe of Luxray in the Grass Continent's Amp Plains.
>    - Area is having a rough go of it due to the demands of several competing tribes and the increasingly encroaching mystery dungeons as well.
>    - Has a lot of practical knowledge due to her upbringing, but not much booksmarts.
> - (Approximately the same size as Nick (~2'0"))
>- Wants to explore & discover new things.
>- Somewhat disorderly and unsystematic, often forgets things.
>- Energetic, but quiet. Not likely to speak up in a crowd.
>- Feels a need to prove herself to others.
>- Slightly pessimistic at times.
>- **Speech**: Often tends towards terseness. Can occasionally talk at length about subjects she's interested in, but not to strangers.
>- **Garb**: Always seen wearing a somewhat worn Dodge Scarf, dyed in a pallet matching her own colors. Owns a wool traveling cloak.

###Charm/Smokey
>charm/smokey the charmander (names will be explained in issue #1) was a layabout in the human world; unreasonably scared of most things and sheltered herself inside a bubble to prevent said things. terminally online, but without social media (so mostly imageboards, youtube, etc). Wanted to get out of the bubble for a year or two before being isekai'd but couldn't ever get herself to justify it.
>Now that she's been forced- and into what in her eyes is an ideal scenario, no less- she's absolutely relishing it. Trying to do the exact opposite of what she did back home and try everything. Taking stupid risks, saying stupid shit, running around and HAVING FUN. Not exactly fearless, but a lot less fearful. Focused on finding ways to take full advantage of her new body and spending the rest of her time truly cherishing the first genuine friend she's had in at least a decade.
>Not naive, especially due to borderline-encyclopedic knowledge of pokemon and their combat specifically, but probably pretty easy to dare into doing something or joke around with.
>has a cynical and stressed core due to how uptight she was as a human but that core has long been overtaken by unbridled enthusiasm, recklessness, and courage

>natu the natu (whose name I have yet to settle on) is a lot more reserved. think of an evil genius and you're mostly there. he's semi-amoral, but he has a good heart. good at the technical side of things, as well as manipulating people on a base level, but typically puts these skills aside to have fun and make sarcastic quips instead of cause mayhem or commit evil crimes. enjoys the fact that his life is mostly normal outside of rescue work, and brags more about being a stable person than he does about his intelligence or wit.
>(not sure if I described them super well but I've tried my best lol. It will probably be more obvious when I write more. Both of them focus on bullshitting the opponent in battle (accuracy hax not excluded) and taunts, but charm is a little bit more aggressive than natu (who would prefer to watch the opponent slowly shut down as opposed to doing that until they can't attack and then landing a final blow like Smokey)

###Booker
>(The following is subject to change, but probably won't change very much)

>Male Ribombee. Timid/Quiet/Modest. Mostly Lawful Good.
>Image: https://arch-img.b4k.co/vp/1678844081456.png
>- A typical introvert, he likes to keep to himself, avoids confrontation, and hates being the center of attention.
>- He often freezes up when pressured or scared.
>- If he manages to make a friend, he will grow comfortable around them and gradually open up to them. In particular, he becomes more confident when he's with his partner, Sneasel. Away from her, he reverts to a more withdrawn and docile persona.
>- He is generally careful and studious, preferring to think before acting.
>- He is empathetic and polite, and wants to help those in need.
>- He is self-conscious about his small size and low physical strength (in fact, he is smaller than average for a Ribombee, closer to 6 inches than 8).
>- He is incapable of flight (for now) and can't move fast on foot, so he typically rides on top of his partner's head (or another Pokemon, if she's unavailable). However, he can use his wings like a parachute to slow his descent and negate fall damage.
>- Like all Cutiefly and Ribombee, he can naturally sense Aura, but he is unskilled at this. As of "Learning to Fly: Chapter 4", KFC is training him in Aura.
>- His antennae let him pick up pheromones and scents.
>- He mainly consumes nectar/honey and pollen.
>- He has an instinctive attraction to flowers now, and enjoys rare/foreign flowers both for their looks and their nectar/pollen.
>- He is trying to learn the new world's written language, with his partner's (reluctant) help.
>- Due to his cute looks and high-pitched voice, he is sometimes mistaken for a girl, to his dismay.
>- Since he already has a built-in scarf, he instead wears his guild scarf as a “waist cape”, attached to a belt around his waist and hanging down the rear (this looks similar to someone tying a sweater/jacket around their waist by the sleeves). His belt has a pouch at either hip. He uses a tiny version of the Clover Guild badge as a belt buckle.
>- He knows no moves (yet).
>- He arrived in the new world two days before the Gathering.

>**Booker's partner**
>Female Sneasel. Hasty/Adamant/Sassy. Mostly Chaotic Neutral.
>Image: https://arch-img.b4k.co/vp/1679270885032.png
>- She is the opposite of Booker in many ways. Booker acts as a voice of reason to temper her hasty/aggressive tendencies.
>- She is headstrong and overconfident.
>- She loves to fight and train, and often goes out of her way to fight feral Pokemon. However, she won't pick fights with civilized Pokemon for no reason.
>- In combat, she is fast and agile, yet frail. She dislikes strategizing and prefers the straightforward approach.
>- She can go berserk and behave almost feral if pressured enough. This is fueled by uncontrolled Dark-type energy, and is a quirk of the Sneasel/Weavile population of her homeland.
>- Despite her recklessness, she has a phobia of dungeon shifts and will be very cautious in high-level dungeons as a result.
>- She is kind and has a good heart deep down, but tries to hide it beneath a blunt and sarcastic attitude.
>- She is not above pranking or mocking others. Booker often reins her in if he thinks she's being too harsh.
>- She greatly values strength and despises "weaklings" who make no effort to become stronger; at the same time, she has a deep respect for those who are weak but try to improve.
>- Due to an incident in her past caused by cowardice on her part, she developed a sense of self-loathing. She tries to overcome it by devoting herself to training and growing stronger.
>- Her ear has a triangular notch on the outer edge, an old injury that never healed.
>- She wears her blue guild scarf in a standard fashion, tied around her neck like a bandana. 
>- She typically wears a belt with a large pouch on either hip, containing various useful adventuring items.
>- She knows the moves Ice Shard (her main attack), Scratch, Taunt, and Quick Attack.
>- Originally a tribal Pokemon living on a wild island north of the Mist Continent, she warped to the Grass Continent by accident a few months ago. She's overcome the culture shock by now, but still hasn't mastered the local written language, and can act uncivilized due to her upbringing.

###Macom
>Macom keeps his human history close to his chest and refuses to talk about it. The Guildmaster's attempts to get into his mind have always been met with him playing a card game in his head and when asked he says he learned it from a video game he played once or twice. While more reserved than quiet he speaks only if he needs to, indicating some sort of older wisdom. Outside of his research he can be gruff, but it just shows that he cares in his own way. He tends to build electricity when stressed or angered, but it is a rare sight to see either.

###Augustus
>Male Oshawott. Quiet nature.
>Worked a desk job that he liked, now is a small aquatic mammal.
>For lack of any better options, lives down at the Capim Town Docks until the guildhall dorms are finished. 
>Book smart, but didn't know much of anything about PMD before finding himself here. Pretty clueless to begin with about the ins and outs of dungeoneering, or certain items beyond oran berries and apples, but he's slowly learning. ~~Not a strong fighter due to this lack of knowledge (including moves) combined with his generally passive nature. However, he will act when needed.~~
>Currently knows Razor Shall and Icy Wind. His general strategy when fighting is to chill the enemy with Icy Wind and follow up with a Slash or Razor Shell from his scalchop. Physical wounds hurt more when you're cold, right? Prefers not to fight, but doesn't hesitate when he's needed to.
>Will absentmindedly play his scalchop in his hands when anxious or thinking.
>Can overthink and get paralyzed by indecision over small/insignificant things at times, otherwise tends to be rather decisive.
>Doesn't talk much and prefers to spend time alone. This is especially apparent when among those he doesn't know well, but is very open and talks more among friends. Despite playing it off as cool, he's secretly resentful he never got a partner to begin with and gets lonely.
>Will (silently) talk to himself if alone.
>Enjoys card games (particularly ["31"/"Cat"](https://bargames101.com/31-card-game-rules/)) and music.
>Dislikes lewdness.

###KFC the Combusken
>KFC the Combusken Portrait courtesy of Linoone-anon:
>[KFC by Linoone](https://i.imgur.com/qGQXGjt.png)

>Origin Story (WIP): 
>https://rentry.org/KFC_Path_to_Aura

>Personality: 
>KFC was born to a large and vicious tribe of Blaziken on the water continent, where anyone who stepped out of line was met with harsh punishment. As such he usually keep his honest opinion to himself. While he will generally act cordial, he will usually have a sarcastic retort or two in the back of his head. Additionally he is easily excitable and quick to emotion, so his true colors will show if you rile him up. Even when his true personality shows, he isn't evil, or anything, just a little ruder than he seems normally. He has a bit of a hard time with opening up to others. 

>Actions: 
>KFC does want to help others, which is why he became an explorer, but he sees it as a means to gain power rather than doing it entirely out of the goodness of his heart. KFC will often go on solo missions as a means to train but if some Pokemon is in the area and needs assistance he will go out of his way to help. 

>Skills: 
>It maybe because of genetic abnormality or something else entirely, but KFC cannot use any fire type moves, which is ironic since the tribe he was born to are infamous across the world for their strong fire.  However, KFC is the most profiecient in hand-to-hand combat out of everyone in the guild, as he is the only one in the guild who had professional training. And it was with someone who was once ranked an Aura Master. KFC is always ready for a fair fight and will avoid using items during battle as he sees it as cheating. Even without items, he tries, and sometimes fails, to think strategically.  However he has quick reflexes that improve as a fight continues (Speed Boost). Wears the Iron-Zinc Scarf which slightly boosts Def. and Sp. Def.
>Ability: Speed Boost
>Moves: Swords Dance, Sky Uppercut, Aerial Ace, [Aura Techniques](https://rentry.org/2qupq)

>Goals: 
>A big part of KFC's training focuses on Aura Mastery. Think of it as pursuing the path to fighting power as opposed to fire power. His aura sensing abilities have reached an intermediate level, while his aura expression is at the most basic level. His true goal is to be officially ranked as an Aura Master. Currently, there are only 4 in the world, alive, who are ranked as Aura Masters and all of them work as Aura Guardians.

>Quotes: 
>'()' = inner monologue
>"(Maybe I should get him a handler?)" - being considerate
>"Can you give me any other insight?" - politely asking for clarification
>"Hold still, I can pop that back into its socket. Just prepare yourself cause this will hurt." - providing assistance
>"(She's calling me ugly, while she looks like her family tree is a stright line.)" 
>"Your attacks are so predicable, I can literally dodge them with my eyes closed." - taunting opponent
>"(Damnit! That stung, and their next attack will be even stronger. I need a plan, and fast.)" - thought in a fight
>"It… It was completely intentional! What the fuck is your problem? Why the hell did you do that?" - pissed off
>“‘Scuse me, it must be the pollen in the air… Y’know… making me sneeze… ”  - in an awkward position

###Kaiji
>Kaiji:
>A quick-witted, formerly-human male Alolan Meowth with a sharp mind and sharper tongue. He thinks on his feet and quickly adapts to changing situations, doing whatever he can to ensure survival. He's the Clover Guild's treasurer and also a source of income for the guild as a merchant, making a decent amount of money using underhanded sales tactics (such as lootboxes) that the primitive Pokémon society hasn't caught onto yet. Tries not to feel bad about it because he still isn't sure how "real" this world and its native inhabitants are. His accent is actually entirely fake, just as much of a character as any other voice he puts on. Doesn't talk much about his human past. He values freedom and sleeps in a hammock under the open sky regardless of weather. Hates corruption and seeing others falsely accused, even native Pokémon.
>Ability: Technician
>Moves: Fury Swipes, Pay Day, Feint Attack, Assurance

>Kris:
>A male Absol whose horn was broken off slightly above the base of the blade. Became partners with Kaiji because everyone else thought he was crazy and avoided him. His predictions of imminent danger are usually wildly exaggerated misinterpretations of the actual impending threat, which he will still believe wholeheartedly every time without fail. Soft-spoken, good-natured, and a bit too trusting, he'll try to do what he thinks is right even if it gets in the way of the mission, and might need someone to reign him in. A relatively experienced battler who used to go on adventures some time before meeting Kaiji, but doesn't like to talk about it (nor his horn). Seems to already have a basic familiarity with humans. Insecure about being called crazy/dumb because of his predictions. Has a tendency to hyperfocus and go quiet during battles. Hates anyone who would betray those close to them.
>Ability: Super Luck
>Moves: Night Slash, Psycho Cut, Fury Cutter, Sleep Talk

###Skiddo
{Pending}

###Beast
{Pending}

###Phanpy and Pals
>Phanpy
>Tends to play the straight 'mon in the group. He also has a strong desire to feel useful to other Pokemon. This gives him a tendency to overwork himself. Can be a stickler for being proper and professional during work, and has a habit of acting without thinking when he gets angry 

>Cyndaquil
>Appointed as Phanpy's partner by the Guildmaster. Has a habit of hitting on anything that moves. Awful at flirting. Tends to be cowardly in physical confrontations, but isn't incapable of acting if there's an emergency.

>Torchic
>Logical and snarky. Values independence and self-reliance. She's struggling to get adapted to her new body's lack of arms. This leaves her reliant on the others to accomplish many basic tasks, which upsets her.

>Totodile
>Alcoholic, but a happy drunk. Wants to have fun, and wants everyone to get along. He's too anxious when sober to socialize, so he feels like drinking is the best way to make himself social and liked by the group.

###Chespin/Wooper
>Decided to stick with a basic name for the sake of blending in. Despite this, slips up and mentions the human world a lot
>Easily startled and worries a lot. Quick to panic when things go badly
>Gets pepped up from exposure to sunlight
>Primarily sticks to Vine Whip in battle, sometimes holding enemies down for him to Headbutt. Has recently learned Solarbeam, and is unable to resist performing the move like an attack from a certain show.
>Hates hay beds, gets very irritable when he doesn't sleep well
>Becomes absolutely furious when coming across a foe who hurt him or a friend in the past, will often attack them even after they're knocked out.
>Will put up with all the memes the other guildmates love to talk about
>His first encounter with Ice types went very badly and nearly ended in complete disaster, traumatizing him. Due to this the mere sight of any kind of Ice type attack spooks him
>Isn't much for going on missions and adventures, preferring to take his time and check out the sights
>Most adventures he actually dares to go on are to obtain mundane items the guild is mysteriously missing

>Chespin is accompanied at all times by a Wooper who is obsessed with the stories of humans coming to his world. Upon learning Chespin was once human, he leapt at the opportunity to live out the stories he grew up reading
>Wooper frequently pesters Chespin to go on missions and treasure hunts, is enthusiastic to the point of obsession
>Wooper tends to be treated as a living gun by Chespin in battle, being carried by his vines
>While unusually skilled at fighting with moves like Earth Power, Wooper is reckless and frail. Even just one moderately hard hit will knock him out
>Due to this, Chespin prioritizes protecting Wooper from harm in battle, even going so far as to use himself as a shield
>Chespin can't shake the feeling that something seems a little off about him
>Despite that mild worry, the two are almost never seen apart.
>Should something happen to Wooper, Chespin will ignore everything else, even immense fears, to get him back.
>Other guild members trick Wooper into repeating memes, with the promise that the phrases are "human detectors"


###Mindy
>A Mew that was found knocked out on the side of the road by Chespin and Wooper
>A former human like most of the guild, she is completely unaware of what she might be capable of
>As such, even though her current form should allow her to do all kinds of things, she cannot perform even the most basic of actions
>At best, she can float off the ground by pure accident
>Timid, is afraid of heights and tight spaces
>Does not have a team of her own, tends to hide away in her guild room
>Seems to come from a different place as the rest of the guild. Does not understand their inside jokes
>May one day learn more about what she is

###Sableye
{Pending}

###Casey
>To throw my hat in the ring, Casey is a quiet, athletic female raboot who use to be a human. That much is obvious but there's more to her. She use to be a male professional athlete in the human world, the driven and ambitious type, before an accident crippled him. That headstrong approach to life became a jaded shuffled to the next day.
>It's only now that she's turning around. As a raboot she's got all her strength back and treasures it- why sit when she can stand? Why wait in the guild when she can go exploring in one of these dungeons?
>Besides that, she avoids drawing attention to herself. She's heard of pokemon but wasn't a fan, so instead of asking a million question she keeps quiet and pieces things together from the conversation the guild nerds spout on about. When she talks, it's short and to the point, not much internet slang.

###Tybo
>Tybo is a male Skitty, native to the pokemon world. Prior to his entry into the Clover Guild, he was an isolationist living alone in a cabin in an arctic area. He’s pretty greedy, and tends to loot “abandoned” places he finds and sells them. He never steals anything where there are people around and doesn’t like stealing from someone unless he sees them as a shitty person or if the place is abandoned, or just in a general state of chaos where someone stealing another’s belongings is of least concern. He tends to not think too much ahead and acts in the moment, he’s also really lucky when it comes to staying out of trouble, he most goes with the flow and silently observes whatever drama is going down at the moment, although he never gossips about it and keeps all his knowledge to himself. Tybo isn’t very malicious, but he’s far from being an angel.

###Ross
Ross (M), Smeargle
>Chronically tired, struggles with insomnia (undecided as to whether Insomnia is his ability or not)
>Struggling to deal with the whole isekai situation, feels very out of his depth. Easily stressed.
>Has no prior knowledge of Pokemon before becoming one, gets easily confused with how strange everything is compared to the normal world
>Basic knowledge assumptions are lost on him (why does eating a berry heal your wounds etc)
>Has a habit of overthinking when confused or stressed, leading him to seem distant or disengaged when speaking with people
>Despite that, is nice and tries to be polite, but won't realise if he's coming across as curt or rude
>Despite being a Smeargle, has no artistic talent whatsoever. Gets annoyed when people assume he does and asks him to draw something for them
>When he CAN get to sleep, he's prone to occassional episodes of sleepwalking. Has painted some incredible pieces of art while sleepwalking, but has no conscious recollection of doing so, and refuses to take credit for it
>He's the sort of person who can be incredibly resourceful and creative but only if something's causing him frustration or creating a problem for him
>Constantly forgets that his tail drags behind him and leaves a trail of paint wherever he goes unless he's tucked it into his belt - this can come in handy though as it means he's easy to find most of the time.

Ability: Insomnia (probably)
Moves: Sketch (hasn't figured it out yet)

###Jimmy
>First of all, as he's still not completely used to this new body, he hasn't learned how to hop on his chest like a normal Gimmighoul. Instead of dragging it everywhere, he prefers to leave it in his room most of the time, and only uses it to store coins, and to sleep inside of. Once he gains control over his chest he'll start hopping around the guild, but will still not take it to dungeons.
>Very brave, but also incredibly dumb. He frequently gets into dangerous situations despite warnings to *not* get into said dangerous situations. Starts fights he cannot win against feral pokémon. Says his size isn't a detriment but a challenge, and wants to prove his worth despite his (very) lacking moveset. Never runs away, he only 'leaves a fight on hold to re-evaluate his strategy'.
>Will not give up on something once he sets his sights on it. Can hold a grudge for years, just waiting for the moment to get payback.
>Reckless to a fault. Will prefer high power but low accuracy moves to medium power and one hundred accuracy moves. Prefers to avoid stat boosting moves, he thinks it's a waste of a turn you could instead use to punch your enemy's face.
>Fears nothing, says 'I'm a ghost so I'm already dead, there's nothing in this world that can kill me twice'.
>Slowly getting used to being smaller than a bird. Uses his size to his advantage to pass through small openings others can't get into, hide behind small boulders, and other stuff of similar nature.
>Will throw a coin at you if you ever call him reddit. And will also immediately skitter to retrieve said coin because he needs it.

###Percival
>A brave and dutiful yet stubborn and paranoid chivalry-larper, Percival is 100% not his actual human name. He acts up his knightly features but is rather easily broken out of this character. He's also a jokester and enjoys making stupid fucking animal-related puns around the former-humans who know what an animal is about their new forms. It's enough to make a Mr. Mime croawn.

>Extremely shy and tends to keep to himself. Can get easily flustered if pulled into a conversation or is in a crowded area with a lot of noise. However will always lend a helping hand when asked, unless the request is joining an adventuring team, in which case he needs heavy convincing to join. Can be seen as cold by other guild members due to how he avoids interacting with people, but he does care about keeping his fellow guild members safe and healthy. Terrified of being on adventuring teams due to his incompetence and clumsiness in fights, and also always has bad luck with using metronome.

###Carrot
>“Carrot” (Nickname), a male Dusk Lycanroc, he’s a seasoned explorer and former member of another Guild, arrives at the Clover Guild along Hazel sometime after it was founded, in the called “Second wave”, he’s brave, courageous, and some even say incredibly reckless, he will not stop at anything or anyone if he believes that Hazel or any innocent pokemon is in harm’s way or under any peril, at that point his eyes turn bright red like a Midnight Lycanroc’s, becoming almost unstoppable, unleashing his full power, in some cases excessively, after all those years he still doesn’t know his name, so officially he doesn’t have one, although Hazel decided to give him the “Carrot” nickname after he said that “He looked like a damn carrot” after evolving, he has great respect for the sun and the moon, calling them his “Guides” and “Masters”
>>Interactions
>Be someone new or an old friend, Carrot will always talk casually, cracking jokes (Sometimes a bit too far, and mostly lame) but keeping a high degree of respect for them, he will treat anyone equally, be a simple townfolk or a federation agent, this might cause misunderstandings and to some pokemon to even feel offended for his layback attitude
>While in combat, however, any drop of casual talk disappears, becoming almost authoritarian, barking orders, and in some cases, even screaming to be heard
>>Misc.
>He wears a purple scarf on his neck, and for a time, some broken sunglasses he found in a mystery dungeon, he keeps his badge on either the scarf or a bag he wears for quick access to his objects
>He has an irregular white patch of fur on his side due to a powerful ice move damaging that area
>His ‘Sigil’ is of a chariot as told by a Xatu, he will not stop until the job is done, or he considers it to be done
>Secret: He still misses the flavor of meat and cold cuts like Salami, and has wondered how different pokemon would taste, but those are just intrusive thoughts and he will never even try it

> Hazel, a female Liepard and Carrot’s partner, she’s a seasoned explorer and former member of another guild, arrives at the Clover Guild along Carrot sometime after it was founded, in the called “Second wave”, she’s quite mischievous, calculated, and some even say incredibly reckless, unlike Carrot she prefers to trap her foes with the use of almost-guerrilla tactics and pre-planned traps, that sometimes are not marked at all, triggering by other pokemon, she didn’t remember her name, but a small collar with her name was found alongside her, so she supposes that Hazel is her real name, she considers Carrot’s thinking of the soon and the stars to be foolish
>>Interactions
>Hazel is a trickster by default, her entire personality is being mischievous or at least a jokester, so she might laugh a bit while talking
>While in combat, her voice turns slightly softer, an omen of her traps and trickeries she has prepared to her foes, to the point of almost being enticing.
>>Misc.
>Her 'Sigil' is that of an inverse star as told by a Xatu, her loss has bringed her fortune in her life
>She wears a golden scarf, with her badge(s) on it, along with a secret oran berry she keeps as a safeguard in combat
>Along that, she also has two small bags that work as quick access to blast seeds and healing/reviving items
>Secret. One of the only things she can remember of her past is a black and red shadow, that, although is scared of, knows was important in her past

### Elm
>During his life as a human, Elm was very afraid of taking risks and trying new things. This caused him to miss many opportunities in life, and he carried many regrets because of that. After being turned into a Duskull he promised to himself that in this life he would be someone more adventurous, who seeks new experiences and unique days.
>Elm has a bad tendency to overthink and expect the worst possible outcomes, as unlikely as they might be, and it might even lead to anxiety attacks. This can cause him to hesitate when facing the unknown, but he always remembers his promise and tries his best to put fear aside and push forward.
>He has a hard time socializing with people he doesn’t know and can come across as being serious and formal. But with friends he takes a lax and informal tone and is always willing to help. He joined the Clover guild mainly because he enjoys the antics of all its members and believes that he will not have boring and mundane days with them around.
>Becoming a Duskull has caused some quirks in his behavior. Sometimes he feels like an internal voice is whispering to him in order to guide him or make him take specific actions. It also helps him stay focused during fights, although it can also cause an unfamiliar rage to awaken when he’s in a pinch. He attributes this voice to Ghost Pokémon instincts. This also has caused him to acquire a taste for pranking and spooking others, but he doesn’t want to be an annoyance, so he makes sure to do it sparingly and to only do pranks that aren’t dangerous.
>Doesn’t like to be near Pelippers due to personal reasons.
>Abilities: Shadow Sneak; Astonish; Will-o-Wisp (in a future story); can go through walls and floor. Must create visualizations in order to use moves, so he needs more time than usual to perform them, but they also pack a bigger punch.

###Kiyo/Cassie/Bean
[See Linked](https://rentry.org/kcb-01)

### Smith
Name: Smith 
Species: Skorupi 
Sex: Male 

(still subject to change but stuff is more established now)
>Quiet natured. He typically only speaks when necessary, and often keeps his statements as brief and to-the-point as possible. 
>Thinks to himself all the time, usually zoning out into daydreams without even realizing it. 
>Remembers culture and memes from the human world, but tries to avoid bringing it up, to not make himself look like a dumbass. 
>Speaks crudely and casually in friendly conversation. Much more professional and polite speech mannerisms around strangers/superiors. 
>He's susceptible to becoming anxious and sometimes overwhelmed in unfamiliar situations. 
>He doesn't like seeing strong emotional outburts from others, it makes him uncomfortable. 
>He tries to remain stoic, but his mask starts to slip when he becomes emotional or is praised, and he has to struggle to retain his composure. 
>Pretends to not be interested in cutesy things, but secretly, he loves them. 
>Loves fighting. Wants to become "overpowered". (Nobody knows exactly what that entails) 
>Won't provoke people who don't want to fight, but is willing to accept challenges from others. 
>Skilled combat adept. His time spent training in the dungeons and surviving on his own has hardened him, and he is much stronger than an average feral. Stronger "boss" pokemon are much closer in power. 
>Picks his battles. He's not afraid to refuse a fight against if he knows he has absolutely no hope of winning. However, he won't try to escape a fight that's already started. 
>Terrible skills at navigation, puzzle solving, resource management, and other crucial aspects of dungeon exploration. Most of the time, his adventures in dungeons end in failure, unless he gets incredibly lucky. 
>Despite this, he's willing to assist guild members on their expeditions if there's a reward for him, or he feels it will be good for training. 

Ability: Sniper 
Moves: Poison Jab, Crunch, Rock Tomb. (maybe he'll find another TM later...)

###Pikachu
>Pikachu (name pending) is a bashful-natured human-turned-Pokémon who comes off as a bit of a dense airhead. She's someone with incredibly good intentions, but her naivete, gullibleness and tendency to catastrophise and panic over the most minor of problems means her efforts often come off as clumsy at best and flat-out dangerous at its worst. Despite her naturally spacey, silly, and sometimes stupid demeanour, she's surprisingly perceptive at times and tends to be one of the more worrisome types out of the Clover Guild. She's a crybaby at times, too. She's got a lot of knowledge about Pokémon, but it's less of the useful combat stuff and more like tons of extremely obscure trivia which she's more than happy to ramble to you about, but gets incredibly embarrassed when you point out that she's rambling
>Because of the fact she isolated herself so hard in her human life, she's more than enthusiastic about going on adventures into dungeons and trying to befriend the other guildmembers. She's a bit of a scaredy-cat though and doesn't like exploring alone. While she's overjoyed to be able to experience a world she adores, she's the most likely 'mon to experience bouts of homesickness and worries for her family back in the human world.
>The most likely to be the only person in a room who uglysnorts and break out into uncontrollable laughter when an anonmon makes a stupid meme reference. Or any bad joke at all, really.
>Also the most likely to start obsessively fawning over cute things/pokémon (not in that way, you degenerates)

###Tooca/Lapi
>Lapi (male Axew):
>The Axew is a Gentle, kind, and considerate Pokémon...but a bit of a wuss and leery of violence. Not a coward per se, but its not in his personality to fight with someone over something that might be viewed as trivial. Not the type to be all high and mighty either however. Would absolutely not be the type to go after outlaws as a mission for example.
>In general more relaxed and placid, more of a "go with the flow" sort of Pokémon. More likely to wander aimlessly around a mystery dungeon just to see the neat things there.
>A lonely Pokémon as well, his more passive nature and lack of self-confidence didn't win him any friends in the lively Capim Town where he originally came from. This has started to change a bit since finding a friend in Tooca.
>He'd be more lawful neutral or something I guess. Would never even consider stealing from a dungeon Kecleon shop.

>Tooca (female Snivy):
>The Snivy is Timid, sure, but there's more to her than just being a scared little critter. A bit of a snark/dry wit, can be a bit snide and devious on occasion and this can get her in trouble at times. Might just be a touch evil, deep down. Just a little bit, in the "kick a man while he's down" sort of way. Comes with being human originally kek. Lapi being around goes some way to counterbalance this once they get to know each other more.
>An anxious one too. More likely to stress over something like low food supplies where Lapi would be more likely to take things as they come.
>She'd be chaotic neutral. Not explicitly evil, Not explicitly good, but a coward and opportunistic when given time to think. This may also go badly for her as she may overestimate her own cleverness being in this world of seemingly primitive Pokémon. If placed in a more serious situation however, she would still try to do the right thing at the end of the day. For the most part though being timid and frightful thanks to now being such a small creature keeps her out of any real trouble, and in more of a support role in general. Would be more likely to use a trawl orb near the stairs/with a pure seed to swipe from a dungeon Kecleon shop.

>For writing purposes their adventures in theory would generally wind up with them finding some sort of different solution to an issue that may typically be resolved through direct combat, such as the case with the Onix in the origin story. Neither of them are good at fighting directly.

###Solid Linoone
>claims to be the fastest on-foot mailmon in Grass Continent
>worked for pelipper mail, now works for Delibird deliveries
>always seems to be in a good mood, overall a happy pokemon
>laid back, likes imageboard memes
>especially likes to hang out with anon-mons to goof around after work
>likes to hear stories from guild explorers
>his nickname "Solid Linoone" is a reference to how he sometimes acts as a spy for the guild
>At work, his ultra secret nickname is Kaczynski. "But don't call me that..."
>dislikes combat, avoids fighting if he can
>dislikes cock and ball torture
>silly little guy
>suspiciously never spends his Poké, lives in a shithole in a poor part of town
>kind pokemon, doesn't want to hurt anyone, prefers to watch people laugh instead
>bad habit of teaching native pokemon memes from the human world

###Debby
>Debby the Delibird, a native pokemon from the north pole, runs a courier service called Delibird Deliveries, and will announce herself as such when greeting people. Proud of her business and line of work, she is a diligent mailmon who takes the sanctity of mail extremely seriously. Any opened or stolen letters or packages are soon repaid with an explosive Present delivered express to the offender. For some reason she harbors a vendetta agains the Pelipper Post and Pelippers in general, and she wishes to take over the postal monopoly for herself.
>Most of the time Debby is a jolly and kindhearted Pokemon, willing to help out anyone in need in hopes her kindness is reciprocated by others. Often she will give a gift to new acquaintances to emphasise this. This kindness is a calculated but sincere trait, as she has had good experiences with it working in the past. Outright violence isn't in her nature, but she holds no qualms about leaving explosive surprises to those who have slighted her professional pride.
>A curious trait of Debby is that she seems more in the know than she should be. Some human concepts seem familiar to her, and others she seems to gloss over without note. Regardless of the situation she faces, she does it with her usual confidence and cheer, never truly off-footed by even the most bizarre scenario.
>Debby speaks with southern drawl, so words like “y'all, hon, reckon', do declare” etc. are common in her speech patterns.
>Example: “I was walkin’ down the road yonder when I was jumped by this group of rascal Rattatas. They done took my package I was deliverin’ to the Magikarp at the lake. Could y'all be so kind as to help a poor gal recover her livelihood?”

###Bullet
>Rescue team "Variable"
>A team known for taking exclusively Rescue missions and being the gossip of the town, this duo seems to have feelings for eachother with neither being able to confess yet clearly enjoying eachothers company.
>In the field these two can be tactful and profesional with their rescues but clumsy and kinda stupid outside the job.
>Willing to team with others if it means that they will save many people.

###Archie
>Personality
>Archie is a little quirky. She isn't great with words (be they written or spoken) and mostly prefers to hang out on the sidelines. On a good day, she has a hard time sitting still and is always running around and finding things to do. She doesn't mind doing favors for people and doesn't expect recompense. When things go wrong, however, she tends to get flustered and it's hard for her to keep her head in the game. She can be a little abrasive when that happens. She blames it on Archeops' Defeatist ability, but she was always like that lol. When talking, she keeps her responses short and to the point, unless you get her started on something she feels strongly about, then she'll go on and on.

>Occupation
>If she's in town, it's probably to barter for materials or to ask Pokemon to let her study them. If she's at home, she's either writing notes, drawing diagrams, or trying to recreate the most commonly used O.R. drugs. The reason why is most of the memories she retained pertain to her job back in the human world. She worked in the operating room as a scrub tech (guy who sets up the instruments and assists the surgeon), and because the PMD world lacks the modern medical developments she was used to, she wants to attempt to recreate it. This task will be an eternal work-in-progress on account of the huge diversity of Pokemon anatomy and physiology, and the fact she is nowhere close to having the knowledge and experience of a doctor. She will head into dungeons now and then, but most of her exploring is in the overworld. Because of this, she doesn't become a proper guild member, but will happily assist the guild if asked. Humons gotta stick together, yeah?

>Other
>- Loves to regale others with stories from the O.R
>- Can only glide at first and gradually works her way up to flying
>- Really misses her thumbs

###Concord
>All around pretty quiet, and prefers to stay out of the limelight but also just likes helping however he can.

###Nigel
>Personality: Constantly concerned with "clean escapes", avoiding risky situations, keeping "his kids" from becoming starved retards, and being sure he can ruin anyone with a serious reason to oppose him... As such an obvious coward about it that "NTRsol" is as much a Guild in-joke on non-member anons as a serious warning that this apparently-PTSD-ridden literal-motherfucker has, somehow, stolen girls

>Backstory: Management strategies for disability-worthy paranoia turned out to fit Absol precognition like a glove, so being dropped in an exceptionally violent Dungeon did not result in Dying Horribly. Began Netori "career" by being far better provider for and non-counterproductive teacher to otherwise-feral Eevee kits than their Espeon father, who died from infected injuries sustained in the fight over the first dubious-paternity egg. Has since expanded beyond the Field egg group with dietary and educational assistance for poor mothers

>Interactions: Relatively commonly comes to town to purchase "luxury" foods as treats for the MANY kids he feels responsible for and post time-consuming but low-difficulty jobs, near-always with one of the kids and still visibly bloodstained. Gets currency from "drastically undervaluing" items sold to Kecleon, due to prioritizing cashflow and "mail orders" over profits

>Misc: Despite nickname, fucks very few of the females lured away from less-cringe but less-capable males, as it's all about not wanting to see children meet a PAINFULLY early end. Did not train to teach, does not know anywhere near enough to uplift-wank, but the paltry scraps he can recall through being a midwit, initial trauma, and isolation alongside hard-learned personal experience is still a big improvement
