And outside that instant, you were swept off your feet and cradled in a thick, glowing scaly limb. Roller coasters were an understatement of the fear you were feeling as he romped from building to building. You held on tightly to his smooth build, arms wrapped around this meaty neck.

Seriously, what the fuck did you get your dick into? Your head was buried in his deep body. Eyes could only be fixed on the sheen of his black scales, reluctantly catching the city lights below. You finally managed to look up, catching the attention of his radiant, lustful red eye, as his smirk returned.

“Nothing you should worry about. I gotcha.” He snorted a plume of orange vape, flexing tighter his grip on you.

He finally landed on an old, unassuming brownstone building, seamlessly striding with those clawed talons of his clacking on the concrete. You felt as though he had no intention of letting you down as you both ducked into an open, arched window.

“You can look up, cutie.” His greeting rumbled in your ear melting away the anxiety in the pit of your stomach. You turned your attention from his broad chest and scales.

Despite the sex-hungry impression you got back at the bar, his flat was much the opposite. Rows and rows of books lined every inch of the walls of his place—dotted with some sculptures, knick-knacks and plants in between. An assemblage of flat partition couches as a makeshift bed sat in the middle of everything. It was like an old barrister’s library turned bedroom. 

The only thing you could murmur was, “Wow…” as you reluctantly pried yourself from his warm body, and set foot on the wooden floor. He laughed, amused, resting a heavy arm around your shoulder like before.

“You like it? Guys don’t really seem to care about what I got.” He said, rubbing your side gently, pulling you back into him.

“You’ve really read all these?” Your voice, hoarse, managing to utter the most you’d said so far. You looked up at him above you. He beamed from your genuine appreciation: eyes, mouth, orange bits glowing brighter than usual.

“Most of them. Some I just found or read a chapter or two. But I pretty much jump around book to book.” He said, and draped another of his heavy arms onto your shoulders, crossed. The smooth, squishiness of his muscly scales caressed your face. He scratched your shirt and belly teasingly with deadly claws.

Despite your desire for small talk to ease your nerves, you didn’t forget what you were both here for. And you found your gaze still locked onto him. Your nerves returned back to you as you ducked your head, grinning stupidly in cringe and embarrassment. He gave a lustful titter as a clawed hand reached down and gently scooped your crotch.

“But we can talk about that later. First, show me the eager human I met back there.” He lapped in your ear, giving your crotch a reassuring squeeze. You let out an aching breath, immediately giving the monster opportunity to take the thumb of his claw to lifted your head upward, diving into your mouth. His glowing tongue hooked and pried your own oral tastebuds, fishing it out and licking your chops.

With your mouth in his grasp and one claw rubbing your hardening package, he slipped his other underneath your shirt and dragged his calloused scales over your bare skin. You didn’t know how to return the favor, but raised both of your own arms against his thick, smooth dark forearms and biceps, traversing the tough luminescent fins of his elbows, as he enveloped his body over your own frame.

Soon he scooped you up effortlessly from your crotch, like a hasty kidnapping, and carried you to his bed. He sat down on the edge, arms and claws still wrapped around your torso and bulge, as you eased back into his clutches and helped take off your shirt. He traced his sharp claws around your chest, flicking a scratch on your nipple as your boner ached in your loins in response. Off came your footwear as he continued teasing the throb down below.

“So, stud…” He growled as he craned his neck down and licked your ear. “What’s your name?”

You revealed your identity in shuddered groans as he clawed off the button in your pants. He laughed deep from his chest at your easy reaction while he slipped off your pants with a deft claw.

“Well then…tonight this big bad monster has you all for keeps. Especially this.” He uttered, sliding his large claws underneath your garments. He took hold of your throbbing erection. With rough, scaly hands intricately wrapped around your dick, you shuddered a wail of pleasure—eyes wide and embarrassed at your involuntary reaction, leaking pre and fiery radiant heat rivaling the monster’s own body.  You tried to pull his grip off, but beating you to the punch, he took your reaching arm and held it behind you.

He gave a sinister chuckle. You didn’t know how to interpret this. Nor did you care. Your thoughts were racing again. The feeling of reclining against this smooth, monstrous brute, in his clutches, edging you, was too much to think about. 

Suddenly he stopped, tracing his claws back from your crotch, up through your inner thighs and belly. What an absolute fucking tease. You were left exasperated, and looked up at his glowing face. He seemed to have read your disappointment as that orange glow smug returned from before. You were lifted up from his lap onto the bedside rug, only to find as you finished turning around in that moment, the great black beast sprawled before you on his bed.

It was gorgeous to see: his powerful thick, tree trunk legs spread in a perfect V. Digitigrade taloned claws and soles open and bare like branches. His monstrous tail lifted to the side, revealed his shining, inviting black passage, as he laid, belly-down, powerful arms propping himself up, turning to you with sheer cockiness.

“C’mon…prove to me you want this.” He challenged, rocking his ass and tail at your throbbing cock.

You shakingly reached out and grasped his two black, scaly globes. He hummed in approval, slowly dragging his thick tail across the back of your legs as you gave his smooth rump a good squeeze. He inhaled his own feedback of your good move. Your mind tried to wrap the situation, but your urges started to take reign. He could’ve guessed that you were going to plunge in ass-first, but…

“That’s it…no need to be shy…” He invited you in that allure as his thick tail started to rope in front of you. Taking a grip on his ass, you spread his cheeks apart. Better now than never. And with a great lap of your tongue, you dove mouth-first onto his pucker.

“Fuck!” He yelped as you lapped from front to back of your tongue around his ass ring. “I knew you werAAHH-“ His turn to moan. You prodded your tongue straight inside his fleshy hole, taking in the indescribable musk and salty fleshy taste exquisite of monsters, as you tackled around his smooth insides.

His hums turned to primordial grunts as he worked with your attempts, clenching his ass as your tongue explored his entrance. His tail coiled around you once in a tight embrace positively reinforcing your efforts, the jagged edges of the scales pressing into your flesh. Before you knew it, you felt a heat beneath your chin, as his own raging hard-on betrayed the opening of his slit: a literally glowing-red, pulsing need of papillae and veins that throbbed with each squeeze of his ass. Your own dick was feeling left out. It was time to satiate your own need.

You took hold of the base of his thick tail and heaved its weight over your shoulder. Your monster mate sensed, reaching back as far he could and rubbed the sides of your legs.

“Fuck me, human.” He ordered.

No need to say twice. You took your own pulsating hot member and angled towards his ass. The brute greedily nudged first as you felt the head of your dick, then girth, plunge into his winking entrance from the point of no return. It took all your might from not exploding then and there. You let it all out—a great big moan erupted from your throat as you gave in to the beast. You were full hilt in the big lug, and you were too pent up to move at risk of cumming too early. The warm folds inside his ass fiddled your dick, urging you to move.

“Take as long as you need. I know you’re enjoying this.” Your monster mate growled, belying his own lust.

You finally cooled down enough to drag your dick inside and start moving. He cursed as you took hold of the sides of his ass and began working out your raw need. The feeling was nirvana. Your mortal, bare skin pampered inside this great being’s velvety confines, milking your dick. Finding your rhythm, you pounded away as you dragged your hands up and down his spiny thick tail over your shoulder.

It was too soon, but you felt close, your thrusts irregular, as you felt your breath and need rise within you. 

“Can…..Can I-“

“DO IT.” He roared.

That was all you needed to hear while you forced several last, long strokes of your cock full hilt back into the meat of his tight, scaly insides, desperately grabbing any part of his horns and wings, crying out indecipherable babble. Every part of your body shirked all your raw essence deep inside the black monstrous beast as your dick uncontrollably throbbed and felt an indescribable hot fire in his ass, basting his guts inside with your human seed and coating your own. The feedback of your ecstasy followed through to your monster as he boomed a guttural utterance and spilled his own seed onto the bed beneath your knees. You couldn’t hold yourself up much longer and collapsed your entire weight around his tail and onto his back and wings, shivering as he moaned satiated pleasures clamping down on your cock with each remaining throb.

You propped yourself up with his tail, still relishing in being inside him as you softened what remaining lust was left below. Your monster mate took liberty to pry you out and turned over to reveal your messy-work. You looked down as a long streak of your seed trailed from his puckering ass.

He reclined, both muscular arms splayed atop the cushions of his bed, inviting you to explore more of his frontside. Without hesitation, you smoothened both hands across his steely scales up to the horns of his chin and returned the favor, kissing him. You felt the throb and mess of his own softening dick against your ass, but that will have to be for another time.

“Looks like I caught myself a good one.” He grinned in between kisses. You pecked every part of his brutish features exotic to you, from the baroque features of the horns on his chin, to his bottom fang, back to kindle of firey glow of his mouth and tongue.

He stopped you, pressing a firm claw plant of your chest, and turned you on your backside, exploring your own fleshy features with the trace of a claw as you toppled over on your back, exhausted.

Several deep breathes of coming to your senses, you managed to say: “You are so fucking hot.”  It was stupid. It was direct. But your delivery was earnest, especially after expelling your lust.

He chuckled as he sprouted an eyebrow (or what you could perceived as an expression of astonishment).

“Pretty bold coming from you.”

But you meant it. You wanted to know more about this big, black sheen of monstrous beauty as you prodded questions of where he came from, what lands, what dimensions, his kind…

He cradled the side of your face with a monstrous claw as you professed your own origins. You admitted you weren’t well-read, but liked some popular fiction. (“Designer novels” he teased your taste with his smug-ass grin.) But he sensed your genuine attraction of his eruditeness and stopped you mid-sentence, silencing you with a gentle smooch.

“Why don’t we pick-up about ourselves tomorrow.” He said. You laughed embarrassingly, and said yes as you propped up and reached a hand to kiss him back. It was a date.

In the midst of everything, you suddenly realized you forgot to ask what his own name was. You suddenly became too tired to interrogate as your mind and arms draped across his coarse chest, your fingers dragging across and against his smooth scaly body.

He picked up a pair of glasses on a makeshift nightstand, and reached for the book under it, holding it above the both of you as he began to narrate in that dark voice. That voice, deeper than night, that lured you into his kidnap in the first place. So began your own reading into his world. You held on to what little conscious you had left of the night as he recited the first chapter…something about Loomings or Lemmings…Ishmael…and drifted off in his warm embrace.
