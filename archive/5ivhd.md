#Homecoming in the Suit of Diamonds
The campus was buzzing with activity down below his dormitory window, the fall breeze pulling leaves in various states of decay from high branches and pressing them briefly against his window screen, before dragging them away to reveal the twilight glow from between the buildings and the clouds of the city's skyline. He tapped his pen against the desk, his left leg bouncing up and down in syncopated rhythm. The paper before him was covered in ink, words repeated and crossed and repeated across, up and down the page. Various small doodles sunk below and stood defiantly above the various discarded ideas. Zoro? Too spanish. He scratched the paper again, spinning the pen in his left hand as he chewed his right thumbnail.

*Why the theatrics? I thought for once we agreed, it's meaningless.*

The voice comes from inside his head with exasperated authority, as though it were as tired of his deliberations as he was but, as usual, unable to remain silent and deal with it.

'I need something, it's part of the big game. You can't play if you don't follow the rules.' Which is true, the entire world had been somewhat upended in the last few years. Yet there were common elements, patterns that worked, and freaks that survived. Even some of the most vile beings imaginable seemed able to walk away still breathing as long as they dressed up like clowns and called themselves something stupid. He could do that, he didn't care.

*If you don't care... I recommend you GET UP AND LEAVE! YOU PROMISED BLOOD! I WILL HAVE IT.*

'I told you, this is part of the deal. We go out, fuck some shit up, sure whatever, but only after I get at least a costume and a stupid nickname.'

*I AM NOT CONVINCED YOU AREN'T SIMPLY DELAYING THE INEVITABLE. NAME, NO NAME, NONE WILL REMEMBER.*

'I'm not killing anyone unless they try to kill me first. Those fuckers in the alley, and even that pig faced moron, they were going to kill me. They had it coming.'

His only answer was a rough, choking laughter. The cheap plastic pen cracked between his teeth, and he tasted ink on his tongue as it dripped down his hand.

*Fine. Take your time. I'll be waiting for you to... defend yourself again.*

The presence receded like a snake, gliding through the dark until it coiled the room in uncomfortable silence. Whatever value the messy page of failed monikers and costumes had sunk into pools of black against the light wood of his cheap desk. Disgusted, he crushed the slightly wet page and tossed it into a can of various torn pages and fast food wrappers. His hand was still covered in ink, black dripping down to the carpet as he moved his free hand to cup below, a shade too slow. Dropping the pen into the trash, he unlocked his door to unleash the sound of excited voices bouncing off the walls of the hallway. He moved hastily, eyes straight ahead, ignoring the few open doors, loud voices, and prying eyes until he arrived at the bathroom, hurrying his way to the sink.

He scrubbed. Back and forth, between fingers, under the nails, and then over again and reversed. He scrubbed until his hands were red and raw and there was not a spot of black on them. The steam clouded his reflection, a mop of unruly dark hair pushed out of his face, with two watery blue eyes sunken into the pale cheeks of someone who could have been himself in a dream. Smudged. He dragged his hand across the mirror, revealing the sharper lines and flecks of black ink staining thin lips and colorless cheeks. So he wiped those too, rinsing his mouth with soapy water until he could taste it on his throat, bile bubbling up as he dragged fingers across the spots of ink on his cheeks. 

"Got something on your face, Little?" Trip said, brushing some white off his nose and mustache in the mirror just left of Alexi's own, looking like he just stepped off a jet, hair windswept and eyes bloodshot.

"Nothing worth snorting." He shot back, as the tanner student snapped his cigarette case closed.

"Not true." The up and coming football star turned, and Alexi followed him from the reflection in the mirror as he approached, something like greed glittering in his dilated pupils.

"I don't have any coke, Trip. You know I can't afford it."

"No shit, Little. I want the ritalin. You filled up right? Spare a brother some love-it's Homecoming."

Alexi grimaced, of course, not even a week, maybe Trip wasn't as dumb as he thought. As though he could hear his snide remark, the larger boy advanced more rapidly, pulling him by the collar of his shirt, up to rabid eye level.

"Do not fuck with me tonight, *brother*."

"You're the one about to punch me when I haven't even said anything yet." He dropped Liddel with an apologetic shrug, as though he honestly believed he hadn't meant to do it. 

"Well? Cough it up."

"How many?"

"All of it, little bro."

"You got the cash for that on you right now? You're crazy."

"Here's the deal freshie, you give me the bottle, I get you back next week when the wire comes in from my parents."

Alexi sneered, feeling his fists curl as the other boy tried to bullshit him.

"No deal, I don't take credit." At that, Trip drew back, pulling himself up to his full height, a solid six two and over two hundred pounds. If this had been even a few weeks ago, Alexi might have been afraid. Now, the only thing that held him back from instigating further was the memory of hideous, half choked laughter. Then, Trip smiled, changing his previous bullish face to the more affable, photogenic football star that allowed him to effortlessly coast through life.

"How about a different deal, you give me the bottle, and I let you party with us? There'll be way better than prescription there, if you catch my drift, and you'll be with me, you won't have to pay for anything." The pale boy froze, immediately tempted, immediately ashamed, but unable to deny the way his chest hammered in response. He had heard the rumors, seen the aftermath, and been forced to sleep on couches due to the kind of parties his semi-famous, very rich classmate threw, and Alexi had been here less than two months. 

*How pathetic. You can barely feed yourself yet you let this parasite prey on you, for what? Distraction? Company? Am I not enough?*

The hateful voice sounded smug, as though it had already figured him out, knew how to get him to crack. It only solidified his choice.

"Deal. When?" He said, surrounded by the guttural heavy breathing coming from each shadowed corner of the bathroom.

"After the game, numb nuts, when do you think?"

"I don't watch sports, give me a time."

"I dunno, Little, like 10-11? You got plans or something tonight?" Trip asked, smirking slightly at the thought that the smaller boy probably didn't have other plans, and that he was just so clever to assume that.

"I do, actually, but I'll be back by then. Don't worry, I'm sure I'll find you." Alexi replied, turning to the door and shoving it open, nearly smacking some giggling couple in the hallway. Trip said nothing, turning back to the mirror to adjust his hair as the door closed. With a carved scowl, Alexi stalked his way back to room 203, pulling it open to grab what little he kept on himself; wallet, lighter, and cigarettes. He turned to the door, only to immediately turn back, opening the desk drawer to retrieve a small set of keys and a bottle of pills, shoving the keys into his back pocket and pills into his jacket as he pulled it off the bed frame banister. He was out the door and down the stairs before the jacket actually made its way all the way on, the crisp autumn air blowing worn black polyester across his chest in flaps of fake fabric.

There were throes of students, some dressed fancy, others in various uniforms for whichever team or band, and just as many dressed typically, but out celebrating regardless. Alexi fought his way past the various globules of cliques, hands in his jacket pockets clutching the pill bottle and lighter as he maneuvered through the kaleidoscope of exhausting school spirit. The bus stop closest to the dorm was blocked from the earlier parade, so he kept walking, lighting a cigarette as he went. Soon enough, he escaped the noise, the crowd thinning as he exited the campus from the east side, past the empty science center, the tall, faux-Greek architecture littered with gold, purple, and orange streamers.

The bus stop rested between skyscrapers, here in the southern tip of Brockton Bay where the capes and hoods seemed loath to travel. Maybe it was all the cops, he noted idly as he drags acrid smoke in, letting it hang, then exhaling slow, only to draw it back once more through his nose. The red and blue lights flashed distantly down the street, sirens running as several sped past the intersection in quick succession. There had been plenty stationed around the school too, there always were. One of the many benefits of being rich, he supposed, was that the police actually gave a shit about you. Or at least about the taxes your parents paid, he thought with a brief smile, flicking ash into the street.

Eventually, a cigarette and a half later, the bus arrived, the big silver box brimming with people, mostly students he half recognized, who spilled from the open doors like neon guts in a rush of excited movement. Emptied, the bus sat idle as he finished his cigarette, the driver stepping out to stretch their legs and have a cigarette of their own. It was the last stop on the number 6 line, from Brockton U. to Ferry Station S. He had a few hops to make to get home, but it was faster than walking and he couldn't afford a cab, so he took a seat at the back of the bus and waited. His leg bounced, up and down, and he could feel his teeth grind, as he flicked the lighter off and on in syncopated rhythm. There was no reason to be afraid, not any more.

The bus started with a groan, and then lurched, puttering through the intersection at the ponderous pace only public transportation could afford. The wealthy side of the city was alive with traffic, foot and car, the bright lit signs beginning to turn on in the fading twilight, the occasional office park tree somewhere between gold and red, and the various suits congealing like ooze in spatters of black against the concrete. The parahuman craze was still sweeping the city, images of costumed men and women littering the sides of buildings, even wanted posters and various warning signs had their place against the glass and stone.

*Is that why you want a costume? To be recognized? To have your image plastered on the walls?*

'You know I don't.'

*You say you don't. I know you do.*

Alexi sneered, catching his ugly reflection in the mirror, looking back at himself with all the contempt he could muster.

'I need a costume to survive. Here's a humanism; most great artists die before anyone gives a shit. I don't need to be recognized, I need to not kill myself due to your incessant whining AND not get murdered by some hero of justice in the lengthy process of pacifying your insane bullshit.'

The laughter came easier now, less choked, but no less disgusting. He felt it recede back into whatever hole it crawled out of, the echoes bouncing off the walls of the bus, drowning out the drone of the engine. He exhaled, taking his time to count to five, before repeating the process over and over as he closed his eyes and pressed fingers to his temple, only opening them just in time to catch his stop. The intersection of South Strip and Bay Avenue smelled like fish and shit as usual, his nose crinkling immediately as he stepped off the bus. The next bus stopped a block and a half down Bay Avenue, the smell of rotting fish rising from the sewers as he stepped past the more derelict buildings of the harbor district. Here, he had to be a bit more on guard, the multicolored cliques that haunted street corners weren't waiting for reservations. Thankfully, the bus stop was deserted, and only a single, shabby shadow crosses the empty road to the other sidewalk to avoid him as they continue on their way. He doesn't light a cigarette, knowing from experience the smoke would draw bums and bored hoods like moths to a flame.

The number 12 bus creaked down the road after a tense spell of waiting, the street lights turning piss yellow as the last of twilight faded. The air was cold now, and the people who spilled from the grey crate held their coats tight to their bodies as they shuffled out furtively. There was a group of red bandana wearing losers posted up in the back, so he took the first seat he could near the side exit. For a second, he wished they would start something, the low murmur of whispers setting the hairs on the back of his neck straight up and the reality of how close he was to home mounting like a tidal wave behind his eyes. But whatever they were up to seemed to be a post-bus phenomena, and he was left with a headache and a bouncing leg as he counted down the seconds before he'd have to pull the cable and go through with this. Even the voice seemed content to abandon him to his self torment, not even offering the comfort of a distracting hostile banter to ease the anxious tremor in his hands as he tugged against the rubber line.

From the stop at Butcher and Fleet, his parent's home was only a five minute ride on a subsequent bus. The walk was about twenty minutes, but he had the time and no desire to rush. The air was cold, but clear, as each step took him further away from the smell of the harbor district into the grimy townhouses of cheap suburbia. He doesn't chance another cigarette, but for entirely different reasons, hoping to avoid any and all unnecessary conversation and moralizing. The cul-de-sac of Oyster Street was as unremarkable as it had been months ago, when he left with his dufflebag and hadn't looked back. He wondered if they had the decency to keep his things, or if whatever was left had been scorched earth. It didn't matter either way.

The lock clicked open, and in he stepped, through the suburban threshold into his childhood home. It still looked a bit like a dollhouse, the tacky doilies, bright colors, worn wood, and worn fabrics sent wave after wave of nostalgia and nausea. It hadn't even been more than two months, but somehow it felt like a lifetime ago. He slipped off his shoes out of habit, trying to make as little noise as possible as he tip toed towards the staircase down the hall.

"That how you come into my house? Like a thief?"

From his right, the slurred voice of his father pours from the television room. He's there, sprawled into his recliner almost exactly like he remembered. Alexi watched push himself to his feet shakily, the splint on his right leg slowing him down from the typical ooze to more of a crawl.

"Don't hurt yourself, I won't be here long. Just grabbing some things."

"Like hell you are. Ain't nothing left for you to grab. Tossed it, day after you left. Shoulda seen your ma crying. Shame what you did-to her, and your sister."

Alexi's pulse pounded in tandem to the warlike beat of his headache, the fury crashing into anxiety like the sea at storm.

"What I did? You're lucky you aren't in jail, that my mother pities your worthless ass, and that I didn't fucking kill you." He can't stop himself from advancing on the wounded drunk, his vision blurred and hands shaking with rage as he clenches them around phantom throats and blades.

"Tch, always blamin' me, see where that's gotten you, boy. I didn't introduce your sister to that poison-you did. Never forget that.'

For an instant, he can almost feel it. The sword, the blood, the relief. The world in crimson. He grasped the illusion in both hands, choking it down to the depths where it belonged, snarling his response,

"Sit down. Or I'll make you-I told you, I'm just here for some things. Alice's things. Not worth shit, just Halloween costumes and pictures."

His father exhaled like a corpse, putrid, bloated, and blotchy. A fat, diseased version of himself, if he'd been held underwater for forty three years. Alexi met his jaundiced, watery blue eyes with a single challenge frozen in ice and reflected in dilated pupils as the older man found his chair safer company.

"I'll call the station boy, if you're not gone before my show starts. Don't need you moping up there until your mother gets home and cries all over me again."

"No you won't. But I'll be gone before you can pass out in your juices." He could feel the furious tears stinging his eyes, leaving the hideous watercolor dredge behind in its picturesque tomb. The blurred surroundings twist, spinning out as he stomped his way through the house, half blind, but familiar enough to avoid pastel corner tables and cabinets full of gaudy toys. He stopped, just for an instant, at his old door. The room was almost empty, just a few boxes of shit he doubted was his lining the walls. Alice's door greets him next, the street sign he'd stolen a year ago still hanging like he'd left it for her. It read: **Elm Street.** Like the movie she'd loved so much. He could remember her laughing when he'd shown her, immediately begging to have it for herself. He'd given it to her, what else was he gonna do with it?

The door isn't locked, but the dust spoke volumes to its lack of necessity now. The lock had been broken for years anyway, and it's all he can do to not turn on his heel back down to where his father sat, unmolested. Like a man on a mission he stalked forward, determined to ignore the ghosts pawing at him from every direction. Each dark shape could at any moment morph into memories of better times, of horrible times, of tears and screams and moments where they were happy. The closet blends into the dark, but sightless, he grabbed the handle, flinging it open and clicking the light on.

Her various dresses, from all across the years stared back at him, accusatory in the harsh false light. For a second, he can't breathe. Then, the anger returned full force, like a tidal wave, drenching his eyes with red as he shoved the center row of blue and white dresses aside, revealing a gigantic trash bag, bulging with various plastic and ill-fitting clothes. He doesn't bother sorting it, instead he hauled it over his shoulder like a body bag, clicking the light off as he whirled around. In the dark, he caught his reflection's furious glare. It juxtaposed horribly with the various pictures that adorned the rim of the mirror, pictures of them, or her and her few other friends, taken with her polaroid. All smiling, sometimes laughing, usually not even looking at the camera. He finds the one he took, two years ago, at the fair on the pier. The bay glitters invitingly below them, reflecting the multitude of colored lights and various shitty carnival attractions. She's laughing, green eyes closed, smile brighter than the light of the ferris wheel. He's got pie on his face, covering half a cheek and on his fingers, as he reaches with the other hand to smear some on her.

He pocketed it shamefully, the only concession he'd allow as he pulled the oversized sack through the door frame behind him. He supposed he looked like a burglar, as he flew down the stairs, two at a time, feeling freer already as he headed to the front door. The television was turned up, loud as all hell, drowning out his steps as he stepped past the side room without so much as a glance. If his father noticed, he didn't say, and for that, Alexi was thankful.

The trip back to the dorms was uneventful. Even with his gigantic sack of trash, or maybe because of it, the groups of color coded gangs gave him a wide berth. It couldn't be later than 10 when the number 6 bus rumbled back to the stop near the science center. His only company on the last bus of the night exited first, a fidgety white haired asian kid in a blue hoodie, mumbling in some language Alexi didn't understand as he rushed out, 

"遅れました、遅れました!"

Alexi followed slowly, setting the bag down for a second to light a cigarette before hauling it over his back again. There's a single light on in the science building, and he watched the white haired chink split off down towards the stadium. The campus isn't quite deserted, but the majority of students were coming or going, the beginning and ending of celebrations and events fractioning and recombining groups of brightly colored youth under hanging lights and street lamps. The clock in the lobby read 10:23, and the dorm was quiet as he trudged up the stairs. He unlocked the door to room 203, tossing the bag into the dark corner next to the bed as he shrugged off his jacket. He had time before the game ends, probably, or someone would've been waiting for him. Probably. He couldn't care less at the moment, sitting down at the desk and dropping his head into his hands. In and out, slow and fast, then slow, then fast, he breathed and breathed, massaging his temples.

Eventually, someone knocked on the door. Loud, fast, triggering his headache all over again. Alexi flung the door open with a scowl, to the surprise of Trip and a gaggle of groupies. His face immediately heating, he coughed, looking away, saying,

"Oh. Right."

"This a bad time bro? We're heading over to the house if you wanna come with." Trip said, seemingly concerned. He must've looked worse than he thought.

"The Alpha Delta Phi house right? I can walk, haven't had a chance to shower yet. My bad." Alexi answered hoarsely, his voice sounded even worse than he must look.

"All good, just figured I'd offer. See you there brother." Trip said, taking his cue with the grace of a born socialite, directing his posse to follow suit as Alexi closed the door with a bit too much force and a shouted 'Sorry!' to a chorus of giggles and a retreating footsteps.

He rushed through his ablution ceremony without grace, scrubbing viciously back and forth and across and across until the water turned cold. Dried and hopefully looking a little less like a mangy stray, he rushed back to his room. He emptied his bag across the sheets, papers and pens and notebooks and books of notes spilling out like monochrome guts. First, the toiletries from the bathroom, toothbrush, paste, shampoo, soap and sanitizer. Next, clothes, faded band shirt X, shitty ripped jeans Y, underwear, socks. He hesitated. Just for a second, then he turned to the sack of Halloween costumes borrowed from his sister's closet. It doesn't matter what, but for last, he grabbed a vampire cape that had been too big for him when he was 12, and a pair of novelty glasses that had never failed to make Alice laugh at least once. 

Overnight bag complete, he patted his pockets one final time, finding the lighter, cigarettes, keys, and wallet. For a second he panicked, only to grab his jacket and wrap a single hand triumphantly around the bottle of Ritalin he'd kept on him all day. Pulling the jacket on, he grabbed the bag and stepped into the hallway, feeling halfway human. He locked the door behind him, gliding down the hall and stairs and welcoming the crisp autumn air like a breathe of smoke. The walk, though he took it fast enough to be a jog, wasn't far. Opposite from the science center, towards the gymnasium, then from there, take a right and follow the street to the fraternity row. It couldn't have been ten minutes, and he heard the rowdy energy rising from the entire line of houses before he'd even turned the corner. 

The whole street was alive with lights, music, and young adults anywhere from eighteen to twenty eight. He recognized one, even from a distance, the tall. red haired Volleyball star hard to miss. She looked a little uncomfortable, almost completely surrounded by various admirers and teammates, nursing a small red cup with furtive sips between short phrases he couldn't hear as he passed. He smelled pot in the air too, and it immediately drew his eyes toward the various balconies of collected students with their various implements.

He spotted the banner for Alpha Delta Phi somewhere in the middle, one of the larger, livelier houses and for a second he felt dread cut the wind from his sails. How was he going to get in? He wasn't even twenty one, he certainly wasn't part of the frat, and he couldn't see Trip on any of the balconies or any of the lawns. The walk up to the front door is crowded with students, drinking, shoving, dancing, or some combination of all three, and Alexi tries not to hurt anyone as he shoulders his way through the undulating pseudo-organism. To his surprise, there's no one at the door to stop him waltzing in, and so he stuck his head in first, looking left and right and up the stairs of the ritzy frat house.

There's certainly people everywhere. A whole lot of them, some of them very attractive girls who must have been in the upper level courses because he'd never seen them before and here he was, sticking his head through the door like a thief. Embarrassed, he stepped inside proper, trying to avoid the gazes of the few people who'd even noticed his earlier stunt amidst all the chaos. Thankfully, it doesn't take much sheepish wandering to get grabbed up the man himself, Trip Touchdown, aviators on inside, nostrils lightly dusted. He grinned, ear to ear, before slapping Alexi on the back with a laugh and a bark,

"Look at you bro-bring that bag to take notes on how to party?" He laughed still, and the surrounding students immediately laughed with him, though Alexi would have bet they couldn't hear a word.

"No, it's in case I pass out here." He shouted back, and for a second Trip stops laughing, before only laughing all the harder, slapping the pale boy on the back again.

"Now that's what I'm talkin' about! Come upstairs, it's not quite so crazy, yeah?" Trip was already leading him away before he'd finished asking, the hand at his back not so gently guiding him through the students watching with various amounts of interest. In Trip, probably, and maybe he ranked as some sort of charity case or curiosity? Alexi didn't dwell on it, mostly because he was struggling to keep up with Trip's incessant pace up the stairs, two at a time.

The upstairs was marginally quieter, though the music that pumped through the speakers thumped the walls and the general volume of every competing conversation from inside and outside bounced off the brightly lit, well adorned walls of the house. Down the hall, and to the left, they stopped in front of a double door on the second floor. Trip turned to him, asking lightly, 

"You bring the Ritalin?"

"Yeah, I have it right here." Alexi responded, flashing the bottle from his jacket pocket to the satisfied grin of the older boy.

"Then let's party, brother." He said, opening the doors to reveal a gaggle of mostly girls and a dark wood table cut with lines of white, ashtrays, bongs, bottles, bottles of pills, and a pile of playing cards.

Time passed, in waves of awareness, he remembered dropping his bag in the corner, taking a shot, taking another shot with the group because he had taken the first on his own 'like an animal.' Then he was smoking, dope, tobacco, together, they passed it back and forth and across the table and across the leather couch to Trip's immediately mocked disapproval. After that, things became, a bit more hazy. Haha, like literally, the room filled with haze, so they had to open the window and let some of the noise in to let the smoke out. He remembered talking about his sister, just a little, to the surprising sympathy of the group, especially the dark haired girl who seemed to be sitting closer and closer. Then another round of shots, then Trip talked about his dad, it was heavy, bro. So they took another shot. Then he was handing out pills, then they were doing lines, then they were dropping tabs, and then the screaming started.

##->Nonoptional Anime Intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gyF_5GBMj0<-

They tore through the window like an arctic gale, sobering, sending Alexi's hair straight up and he knew down below, near the street, someone was torturing kids en mass. He could almost feel it, almost see it, like a phantom horror show played out in an ever increasing number as the cacophony reached a fever pitch.

"What the hell is that?!"
"We need to get out of here!"
"Screw this!"
"Is it the cops?"
"Capes?! No way! No fucking way!"

His new friends were quick to panic, bolting upright off their various lounging positions with graceless abandon, knocking bottles, pills, and ashes all over the carpet. Trip groaned, but turned to him, trying to look determined.

"Get the hell out of here freshie, you were never here tonight, understand?" He said, somewhere between frantic and authoritative. Really, he just looked scared, and Alexi felt something dripping down his throat as he grabbed his bag and turned to follow the stampede out of the double doors towards the foyer. But the crowd outside was pushing its way inside, forcing the people trying to leave back into the house as the screaming poured in from the few left behind. He, and the rest of the group, turned back to the study, terror merging with hopelessness the instant they heard the heavy front door slam shut.

Alexi felt his heart pounding wildly, his vision blurred and perpetually swirling with a light dust of ultraviolet in a pattern that never stayed the same long enough to settle. The outline of someone who looked like Trip stood at the window, peering out into the darkness fruitlessly, and Alexi felt it, somehow. Through the haze, through the various chemicals and patterns distorting his vision, he felt his spine tingle like a phantom finger dragging down each vertebrae with an electric caress. But he didn't know how to stop it, so he watched, paralyzed, as the wall caved in under the window in slow motion. Through the haze, the wide eyes of Trip Touchdown met his, just for a split second, Alexi saw the terror and the hopelessness underneath the bloodshot, tanned, windswept facade. Then a blur, looking like a ball of spikes and feathers, crashed into the table of paraphernalia like a cannonball, sending Trip into the wall like a rag doll. The students around him screamed, pushing past each other fruitlessly to escape the study in a distant torrent of trampling feet as Alexi felt absently for the zipper of his backpack. 

The intruder stood up, surveying the damage with a grin like razor-wire stretched tightly by his thin mouth and sharp, angular face. There was something vaguely familiar about him, or rather, his outfit. The DIY football player aesthetic, though this outfit was clearly a step above anything he'd seen so far. Sharpened, real bones seamlessly woven with human hair along the pads gave it more of an authentic chic, like a savage warrior of some dystopian future, not a kid playing dress up. It was all red, some fresh blood, most old paint, even his slim, scarred body was lined with both shades of red where the gaps in the pads revealed flesh. That pig faced parahuman he'd bisected and this man were in the same gang, but clearly, only one of them had had more then zero victories under his belt.

Absently, Alexi rummaged through his pack, grabbing the glasses and cloak, pulling them out as he got up from his shameful position on the floor. There was a blood spatter on the wall, where Trip had impacted, and the tall, thin, red man walked over to the limp football star without a care in the world. He leaned down, one hand on his bone-spiked knee pad, laughing as he pulled the student's head up by his wavy blonde hair. It didn't look like Trip was waking up any time soon, so the man dropped him with another short bark, turning on to fix Alexi with a blood crazed stare. He paused, meeting the pale blue eyes slightly obscured by prescriptionless glasses. Alexi stared back. He'd managed to put on half his costume, the shitty plastic glasses resting uncomfortably on his face, fake nose slightly limiting his breath and the fake mustache tickling his skin. Taking the moment in stride, Alexi flung the cloak over his head, adjusting the glasses as they jumbled around his face at the motion. Then, the man laughed, deep, from his belly, as he beheld Alexi's quick and dirty costume.

"And what is this? To think I'd find you here, hiding out with the upper crust." Find him? The other man rose, slowly, like a lion, the sharp lines of his outfit blurring as the world continued shifting at the chemical cadence, hues distorting and details smudging and sharpening in pieces like a dirty broken mirror.

"Find me?"

"Oh yes, surely you didn't think I'd just let you walk away after killing poor Albert, would you?" The thin man replied, grinning ear to ear as Alexi struggled not to laugh.

"Albert? You mean pigman? Like Fat Albert? My condolences." He failed, choking out his reply as he found his footing, shaking hands steadying as he laughed. The other man laughed too, grin widening as he slapped his knee pad, practically howling out of the broken wall to the exposed moon.

"So who are you supposed to be then, let me guess, Massacre? Red Man? Blooddrinker?"

"Butcher. The second. And you are?" He introduced himself with a flourish, the few bloodless spikes on his gauntlets flashing as he swept his hand across his chest.

"Uhhhhh," Alexi floundered, wondering, the semi-tangible sword resting heavy in his left hand, "Cold steel? Sure, whatever, you won't remember it anyway." The declaration changed the atmosphere immediately, and he watched the other man eye his left hand with obvious predatory interest. Suddenly, his eyes glowed, and then the world went white as pain shot through Alexi's addled brain. It's almost enough to distract him from the leap of the red drenched man, the electricity unmistakable underneath the dulled agony. But maybe it was the alcohol, or the marijuana, or the special K, but somehow, it just wasn't painful enough to stop him from stepping out of the way as the other man crashed through the double doors like a freight train to a chorus of screams.

*Avoid his gaze, and he is just a big dumb animal.*

The voice spoke as if pouring in from the night sky, surrounding his brain in a comforting chill. He could do that. Again, this time, Alexi is ready for it, as Butcher tears through the floor, freshly coated in red and flecked with white drywall powder like a big harlequin. Alexi dived underneath him, ignoring the screaming students pouring out of the room underneath the study, which had been some sort of billiard room before being ruined in a few seconds of parahuman mayhem. The cloud of dust stood still, somewhere between purple and orange as the artificial lights battled with the ultraviolet tint, and for a second Alexi forgot it was his plan to be here, before his pursuer roars, tossing the two halves of the powder stained table from the study down in quick succession. Just like baseball, Alexi lined up a quick strike, cutting the two pieces into four pieces with a cross, then back across, reversing his grip. 

From the upper level, Butcher roared again, diving into the cloud with one of the tall, metal lamps from the study crashing down into the floor between hands. Stupid choice made, the sword came crashing down, carving through both arms as he stumbled backwards, the fountain of blood following him like a trail of sparkling confetti. Alexi twirled the sword, splashing blood on the floor, preparing to decapitate the larger man, but as the man's knees hit the floor, he began to laugh. It's rough, harsh and cruel and it sounded so much like the thing in his head it drew Alexi up short. The silhouette spoke, as the blood pooled between them in a steady stream, reflecting the older man's glowing eyes in the vibrant lights,

"I had hoped it would be you, the other, well, she's more of the same, this, I want to try." He said, his voice weak but ringing with some sick triumph as Alexi approached.

"Who?"

"Don't tell me-you don't know? The one caught up with the fodder outside? Well... I'm sure we'll see her soon-Together." He said, grinning up at Alexi's silhouette, ringed with lights from the crystal chandeliers like a halo. With both hands, he takes the Butcher's head clean off, and then he's somewhere and someone else.

He's a man, or he was a man, weeks ago. Maybe years ago, he couldn't tell how long it had been since he'd been strung up like this. Every nerve burned, and every drop of blood seemed impossible with how thirsty he was, his breathe ragged and equally painful, as if he'd been swallowing coals. But that was before he woke up in this body, brought to being by the weeks of agony, a blood pact. He would live on, if not in body, then in blood. The second man walked in, a slim sort of man, in a doctor's scrubs and looking like the cat who'd swallowed several dozen canaries. He spoke, but the first man had no sense to hear them, only the slow shifting in his binding as he pressed withered body against reinforced steel and felt it give. The second man almost missed it, his knife drawing arcane patterns and his notepad readied with morbid interest. But the needle struck his carotid before he could break the chains, and then, he was somewhere and someone else.

He was a good doctor, top of his class, and dreadfully bored of it all. The world wasn't ready for what he had become, but he knew it would be the forefront of all modern science, so he found his specimen and when it got out of hand, well, he put it down. But the voice offered something more, the chance to escape the drudgery. To pursue legacy, bloodshed, the life he'd always dreamed of. Of course, he said yes. Being a gang leader was a lot like running an office, there was always something to do, but instead of being boring, it was fun. He mixed new compounds, culled the ranks, collected parahumans, and generally killed whenever he wanted. He hadn't been too attached to either body, but now, he figured he'd try and stick around for a while.

His body moved, lurching at first, too heavy on one leg, then the other. There were so many sounds, and for some reason he couldn't focus on a single one. Sirens, screams, cheers, they all blurred together as a sound like crashing waves came to overtake them every other moment. It was like a drain, flushed, spiraling, then clear, then all over again. Distantly, within the whirlpool, he heard a crash and watched with detached eyes he watched a poorly masked woman break through the glass doors on the far side of the room. She's flanked by a man in a bug-like suit of tinker tech, and a woman even taller than the first with a single horn protruding from her hairline.

The dust had settled, painting a damning picture of Alexi that he viewed as if from third person, observing the headless corpse of his old body and the goofy costume of the new, now considerably less comedic with the swathes of red that cut across his chest and back across his arms and hands. He felt himself turn, appraising the new arrivals with predatory interest as a grin split his face like razor-wire.

"Stop in the name of the Protect-Holy shit what happened here?" The first woman spoke, hands raised and posture defiant despite the lacrosse helmet and bandana doing a piss poor job of transmitting the sound. It sounded muffled and shaky, as if she'd never seen a dead body before. The other two were less shaken, the caterpillar dressed individual holding his hands out like he was going to start throwing knives, the gigantic woman readying what seemed to be a gigantic spiked club. Alexi laughed, and so did his body, to the pleasure of none of the guests.

"This is crazy, kid was high out of his mind! What. A. Rush!" The body spoke, and Alexi realized a few things in a single moment that sent his sense of reality to pieces on the floor. He couldn't move his arms. He couldn't speak. He was trapped, in the vortex of sounds that flushed in and out and the vibrant patterns that seemed to spread out and contract back in with an incalculable tempo. Distantly, a conversation he should have been a part of played out like a nightmare.

"Maybe I'll even get a two for one deal, no, four for one!"

"He's lost it, Triumph, we have to stop him."

"What do you mean by that? This is a guy from my school, I swear I've seen him before."

"Whatever it takes. I don't think he's going to give us any good options."

"Then we make one ourselves, I called the Protectorate, we just have to hold out."

Alexi closed his eyes, or he tried, but the screen stayed on, playing out distorted images as he felt his own phantom limbs drag across his face.
The power ranger wannabe throws his hands out, the bespectacled student doesn't move, until they transform mid flight into a variety of grotesque creatures. Chimaera crosses between bug and mammal, like some budget horror movie, fly, crawl, and skitter at irregular speeds as the two women approach on either flank. The old vampire cape fluttered as the sword flashed, cleaving through monsters with a chesire grin, eagerly anticipating the strike from the club that was aimed at center mass. His eyes flashed, and the woman screamed, missing wildly as he stepped in to deliver a quick jab with the butt end of the blade to her abdomen. She crumpled, just in time for the leg of Triumph to swing over her head through empty air, as with a single hand on his glasses, Alexi watched his body bend backwards before springing back up. No longer pain-sighted, the ogre woman used her low posture to roll out of the way of the translucent sword, and it cleaved through the dirtied carpet and hardwood frictionless, surprising him and forcing him to pull it back unnaturally.

He stumbled slightly, and it was all the time the two women needed to launch their assault. A sweep kick to the legs, prompting a hop, while the other went in for a kick only to be warded off by a slice. The next wave of monstrous constructs filled the room, this time clinging to the ruined ceiling and shooting thick, viscous liquid at irregular intervals into the melee. The blade flashed, and impossibly, it swept through the air in quick painterly strokes, catapulting the projectiles back at the two women attempting to take advantage of the distraction. With a shout from the man hanging back, the bioluminescent insects engorged, before launching themselves at the stolen body.

The first, he sliced as all the rest, only to dismiss the sword suddenly stuck to the ground. With furious acuity, he moved, weaving and slicing and moving between the sticky bug missiles with his eyes fixed solely on the conductor, eliciting a horrible bout of screams from the other man in return. The larger woman screamed, charging the caped boy ready to kill. He did, sliding his blade through her ribs, into the heart and pushing her body back with his foot. She lay still for a moment. Alexi's world melted once again as he watched her bleed out for what seemed like forever. But it was only a moment, in the next she was up, rearing her fist back like she'd never stopped moving. The eyes didn't seem to deter her this time, and Alexi watched his body duck the haymaker, only to have to flip backwards out of the following uppercut.

"See? That would have killed you. Either of you. Take this seriously."

"Yes-Seriously! KILL ME!" His own voice roared back into her face as he skewered her again, dragging the sword side ways to cut her nearly in two, then back across to finish the bisection. No-No, No No. How did it take him this long to figure it out? He wasn't dissociating. This wasn't even his voice. This was *him.* That stupid, bone obsessed, pumped up moron who he'd decapitated. It had nothing to do with the drugs-no-maybe it had everything to do with the drugs. Maybe that was why he wasn't resisting. Just observing, watching himself be piloted by so much human garbage it made him want to puke. Spiraling in and out of consciousness from his own stupid decisions. Just like *daddy.*

The rage crashed into his mind again, this time, he felt it shake. Felt the weight of the sword in his hand, for just a moment. Felt Butcher quake, as a punch from Triumph slammed straight into his gut and sent him flying into the wall. Alexi watched himself smash into the wall with a twisted sort of triumph, but he knew he'd have to do better. Getting up is a painful affair, Alexi dived into it, relishing in the ache of his ribs, the pain in his legs, and the blood dripping from his lips that he knew had to be his own. The metaphysical weight of two psychopaths rammed into his consciousness, sending his body to the floor in an inglorious heap of broken wood and dirty costume. 

He looked up, through the hole in the ceiling, he could see through the first hole made in the study, the shard of night sky glittering with stars. Distantly, from that small pocket of night sky, Alexi heard the voice, calling out to him-His voice-spiteful and crooning for vengeance,

*I am not able to hold out, the other, it's eating me-but together we could **survive.***

'How?'

*Let me in. You've spent so long running, trying to keep me out, it has made us weak. Let me in. **Let me in.***

The hand hangs in the air, long, spindly, like five blades extended from the moon, twisting into the five points of a star. With a single, bloody, hand, Alexi grabbed it, and then the world filled out like an unfinished painting, stroke after stroke of sensation filling in the hazy gaps of his awareness as sight and sound returned to his control. This was his body. It always was. He was the one in control. He always would be. This was his dominion, a one man kingdom, and he had no room for despots.

The crown filled in like mercury poured from a basin above the clouds, five diamonds, diminishing in size from the center, with a single thin rim connecting them across his forehead. The world glowed, transformed, violet light bathing his surroundings as he bloomed out of the wreckage, cape spread like monarch wings from the wind preceding the approaching ogre woman.

She's pretty fast, he noted idly, her club smashing into and through the wall like the sound barrier as he leapt over her. He can feel it filling out in his hand, the sword, the once see-through black blade glowing ultraviolet and brilliant like a star in the night sky. It's beautiful, and as he landed, he couldn't help but marvel at it in the center of the room. It's every color at once, and none he'd ever seen, some sort of pattern swirling, contracting and expanding in a tempo beyond his understanding. The bronze titan yelled, statuesque body moving in slow motion as he avoided punch after punch of mechanical motion. It exhaled steam through its iron visor, frustrated, as the bug slides past, diving for the headless ogre woman. The ant-man caught the horned head, and with surprising agility, collided it back with the falling body, digging a syringe into it before it had even hit the ground.

The ground shook as the titan advanced, boxer stance light and fists cocked. He danced with it, moving between hits to the sound of a fading rhythm, the pump of his blood an adequate replacement, as the sword flashed forward when he felt like it, to keep the thing on its toes. To the giant's credit, it was pretty agile, though he was enjoying himself seeing how many nicks he could make on its armor before it noticed what he was doing. He's about to ask it to try harder, when he felt a familiar tingle in his spine, like the caress of a lover, it ran down his back and he jumped backwards just in time to avoid the flash of lightning.

With a shout, a white rabbit in a blue hoodie literally spun into the room from the broken glass door, his one foot crackling with lightning as he flew towards Alexi. It was pretty impressive, but a little slow, earning a quick side step as the rabbit landed against the wall, and with grace popped back towards him again, leg crackling with brilliant energy. This time, the rabbit doesn't overshoot, and despite the effortless dodge, Alexi found himself flanked. They attacked in short bursts of movement, and while he'd had been in a street fight or ten, and his father had taken him to the gym to 'teach him to be a man,' there came a point where he had to admit that he was outmatched in terms of skill. 

The titan was trained like he had been, boxing, tight swings, few legs, she was easy to read. The rabbit was the opposite, if not for his sixth sense, he'd be eating feint after feint from this thing's bizarre kung-fu. Even his swordsmanship was, without mincing words, totally lacking, his sweeping strikes effective enough to deter movement, but unable to leverage his reach for more than a defensive advantage. The Butcher had made it look easy, moving with a killer instinct and total confidence. Alexi was quickly forced on the back foot, dodging and weaving, ever mindful of the recovering ogre and the caterpillar man speaking into some bizarre looking insect on his wrist. He needed to get out of here-and he wasn't exactly sure what to say. Sorry, my body was possessed by a man I murdered in self defense? But I did take your head off-Just in self defense! What a joke.

He doesn't have time to deliberate, as they're on him once again and this time Alexi is looking for openings. He found the first in the titan, the great armored body rearing up a heavy right hook, leaving her front leg exposed. He cut through the gap in the armor on its Achilles heel, and it crumbled, creaking and spilling oil as it attempted to stand. The rabbit screamed something in an asian language he didn't understand, before filling the room with light as it pulled the electricity out of the walls and surrounded itself in crackling energy. He didn't have time to think, or look for openings, it could have been hours, as he followed his instincts, the dark room flashing as the rabbit sent a myriad of kicks and punches from as many directions, bouncing off the walls, spinning on its heels, and feinting nearly half. But there was one, single, solitary moment, Alexi knew he'd have to take.

The rabbit erupted from the wall in a blast of crackling light, spinning so fast Alexi almost missed the identical movement. This time, Alexi dropped his guard, exposing himself as he feinted a particularly wild swing with his left hand. The lightning encased boot swung fast, the flash of electricity enough to almost blind him as he shifted backwards, feet planted as he dropped the sword for a millisecond into the space between, only to pull it out with his right and grasp it with his empty left, smashing the pommel into the rabbit's following leg to the sound of splitting bone.

The lights go out, and the thing screamed. In its big, round eyes, Alexi caught his reflection in the fading sparks. He looked deranged, the long spindles of blades gripping his skull from five pointed digits, face covered in blood, sword pulsing in the dark in tandem with his heart as he stopped his next blow before it struck true. The sword faded. The home was deserted, sirens echoing in the distance, and he ran from the scene with no one to stop him, hopping up to the second floor to grab his bag. He looked around, the power was out across the house, and the remnants of the study was busted up beyond repair. He knows there's a bottle somewhere here with his name on it, but he doesn't have the time to dig it up and find it, grabbing his backpack from the corner, stopping only to check Trip's pulse. He was somehow still alive, and for a second Alexi debated, but he figured, the night couldn't possibly get any worse, so he grabbed him and jumped back down.

The ant-man seemed to have collected the wounded, dosing them all with his syringes. The others noticed his entrance, but he threw the body at them and leapt back out, this time, through the hole in the second story to the outside of the house. His body burned, ribs broken, vision blurry, and a headache that seemed inescapable pounding between his ears. But he was alone, as he struggled over the fence, leaving Fraternity Row behind as he took off through the small neighborhood behind. Distantly he could hear screams, coming from the night sky, and all around him, but they were so distant he figured they were just echoes from earlier in the night, haunting him like any other horrible night as he circled back around to the dormitories through the gymnasium. Despite how terribly tonight went, in every respect, he almost felt like laughing as he opened his door, flopping onto his bed atop the various notebooks and books of notes that didn't even rank on the discomfort scale compared to the beating he'd taken.

In the dark, as the echoing screams faded, he realized that he had never been alone. From the dark corners of the room, it slithers out in tendrils of horrible shapes, before it takes a form he wished he'd never shown it. She smiled back at him, eyes impossibly big, smile too wide, his sister shaped monster. He laughed, as his vision blurred and the thing smiled even wider, sharp corners of lips carving upwards and distorting pale cheeks with mirrored lines. It looked like a V, he thought, as it stared down on him, motionless, unblinking, and smiling in horrible victory and without moving a single muscle, he heard it speak, cold voice almost feminine,

*You did very well today. Sleep now, you've earned it.*

**FIN**
