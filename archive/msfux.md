>”Nyeh…d-don’t get the wrong idea, okeh? T-this is just so I won’t lose.”
>You just nod along to Miko’s slurred speech as she looms over you, her speech impediment worsened by the copious amounts of alcohol the both of you have consumed
>All the other girls in the karaoke booth giggle as you prop yourself up on your elbows
“Miko…if you don’t want to, this bet is hardly th-”
>She interrupts you by grabbing both sides of your head to hold it in place as her flushed face inches closer and closer to yours
>The lingering odor of the fruity alcoholic drinks she’s had mixes with her natural scent and fills your nostrils once she gets close enough for her breath to hit your face
>Staring into her bright emerald eyes makes this situation…harder to handle, in a particular sense
>At least she’s on her knees so she won’t notice what being this close to her does to you
>You break eye contact and try to focus on something else, but quickly realize that curtains of pink hair prevent you from finding anything other than her face to look at
>”Hey…”
>You bring your gaze back to Miko’s eyes, and find that her expression isn’t one of annoyed reluctance like it was a moment ago, she looks almost nervous
>Her nose brushes yours as her eyelids flutter shut and her soft lips press against yours
>...
>W-whoa
>When this first started, you expected, if she did it at all, to do it so quickly that it’d be hard to tell if she did at all
>Instead she earnestly holds her lips in place and lets out a sigh through her nose that sounds almost…happy
>At least, until everyone explodes in uproarious laughter, then she basically jumps off you
>letting out a “bleh!” She grabs a random drink off the table and chugs it to rinse her mouth
>”Hahahah! W-wow Mikocchi, I didn’t know you had it in you!” 
>Marine stumbles out through her cackling
>You just stare at Miko, who now is the one to refuse to make eye contact
>”...There’s a reason Miko likes girls you know! That was…”
>She refuses to elaborate her feelings on kissing you further, just finishing the rest of the glass before slamming it on the table harshly
>Wait…
“Miko.”
>You point at the finished drink on the table as the room quiets down except for a few inebriated snickers
>She finally meets your eyes and looks at you with a questioning expression
”That…was my drink.”
>Her face contorts into a look of shock as she does a double take at the table while everyone starts howling again
>”FAQ!”
