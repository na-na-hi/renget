Started out as a womanizer which backfired, but then found himself a great gf in Hoge. One of the BOYS, friends with Chris and Junichi.

Legacy. Her family is a mutant branch of one of if not the biggest hero clans in Kyoto. Seiryu is her cousin. Used to delinquent pretty hard, then her family put a stop to it. Her quirk gives her regeneration, durability, venomous blood and strength. Got put in coma by Feral. The event shook her up hard and she's trying to refind her confidence. Is falling back with her former gang. A brewing ship with Edith. Avid arcade gamer.

##Sandatsu Owari HN "Reaper"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88192177 (further information at https://rentry.org/Reaped-Quirks)
Edge incarnate. His family was some weird death cult, and his mum was a fed who trained her kid to be a killer for the government. He captures quirks when people die or are close to it.  Overdosing on quirks is causing him to schizo even harder, but lately he learned to get rid of some of them. Also in recent news, murdered his mother. Is hate-dating Mio who acted as a sort of his handler after she learned about him (she took the deal cause the alternative was getting dissapeared). Part of the boys but he's pretty much on the run now. Cannibalized Hiro, but he survived somehow. He killed so many people, gangers, heroes and more. Had license before as government sponsored, but is not interning considering the situation

##Yui Sagara HN "The Binding Hero, Capture Cloth"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88383012
Was a minor Villain due to being a poor orphan. Got beaten and forced into the rehab program by Rosethorn. Her quirk is making threads with some funky effects. Lives with her cat. Friends with Orochi mostly.

##Kyoda Hiro HN "Overdose"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88193619
His quirk is making custom drugs. Or was I guess. He got fucked up by Sandy recently and barely survived (he's in coma), but his Quirk got stolen. He was held back after he used his quirk without license last year trying to stop some thief.


##Sally McCathy HN "Last Rite"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88810810
Transferred in mid-year. Another rehabilitation program member.  Her quirk is guns. She has barrels in her arms and can shoot variety of stuff from there. She can also bend bullet trajectories around her. She shot some robbers back in America, when she goofed and accidentally used lethal rounds. Desolater is interested in making her his pupil. Dates Noah. Has a beef with Hoge, mostly because due to her she had to retake the license exams. Interns under Popsy.


##Takara Tame HN "Android"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/89199766
Another transfer. Android with a goal of making friends, which allows her to use their quirks, but she's not great at it. Had to retake the exam. Interns under Rosethorn.

##Junichi Takagi VN "Marrow"
https://archive.4plebs.org/tg/post/88435130 (further information at https://pastebin.com/27Pruk8a)
Not in 1D, but there is a big chance he'll join them at some point. Failed the entrance exam to join Shiketsu because his Quirk of growing bones is gorey and bad PR, so instead he joined a revolutionary Legion organisation and "interned" under the Five. Friends with Inigo. "Dates" Maxine. Together with Hifumi, messed with Tomi from the Night Parade.
