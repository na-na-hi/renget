<"Joachim, I already called the studio, Sunday's fine for the shoot. Uh huh, alright. Bye.">

"Yo."

"Hey, there's the man of the hour."

"Psh, whatever you say."

"No, no, Junpei, I'm serious. You did good out there today."

"Uh huh."

"Really, you did. You're being hard on yourself again."

"It's not that, Ernst-senpai, I-where-"

"Oh yeah, maintenance moved the other chair over when they fixed the...{air conditioning}, A/C. Yeah. Yeah, right over there."

"...Wait, they fixed it?"

"Yes!"

"God, I've been complaining about that forever! It's like a sauna in the gym!"

"At least you don't have to worry about making weight."

"Well played. Tea?"

"Raspberry?"

"Green."

"If there isn't sugar, yeah, I'll drink."

"But you don't drink."

"I meant the tea. Thank you."

"Got it at the 7/11 on my way back from the hospital."

"*Sehr gut.* Speaking of which, your arm..."

"Good as new."

"Awesome!"

"..."

"..."

"Your Japanese, it's a lot better."

"Wait, wait, what were you going to say before you sat down?"

"Oh...It's just..."

"Thank you, by the way."

"Yeah, you're welcome. I don't know, it's just...uh, well, this isn't very manly to admit, but I don't feel like I protected any-"

"Shut up."

"wh-"

"Junpei, stop lying."

"But I'm not, I got hurt today just trying to hold that big villain in place, and for what? You and those kids, you took it down, right?"

"We did, but you were there first."

"So?"

"We don't just do this for fame. True heroes are first responders. You responded first."

"But I couldn't even take it down."

"Bro, you did. There's video, too."

*20-METER BREAKING ROOM!*

"See? What's that?"

"Me...But I didn't take it down like you.*

"Junpei, don't be a hero like me. Be a hero like you."

"Your dad tell you that?"

"No, but...it's probably what he'd say."

"Oh, come on, senpai, you've got that look again."

"Just saying, Junpei. Those young heroes who helped us out today, they, heh, they couldn't stop talking about you. You inspired everyone there, myself included. You-you're a better hero than I. You've got passion."

"Ernst-san..."

"..."

"..."

"For convenience-store tea, this is seriously good."

"Welcome to Japan."

"I'm very welcomed."

"You know, it's the interns' first day tomorrow. You worked anything out yet?"

"Ten rounds hard sparring?"

"Absolutely not."

"YA-HA-HA-HA! Kidding, I'm kidding! No, but we will train after they get done with the intro stuff."

"Muay Thai?"

"Maybe in the afternoon, if morning patrol doesn't take up our time."

"Promise?"

"Promise."
