###Switch not booting after update
***
If your device is not booting into [Horizon OS](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology#horizon-os-hos) after an update then you may try one of the three fixes from down below:

####Old CFW version
***
You may be running an old CFW version. Please ensure you are on the latest
CFW version. You may read this [guide](https://rentry.org/UpdateCFW) to learn how to update your CFW.
####Broken installed theme
***
Your Switch not booting may be due a theme being broken on your updated firmware.
You can fix this by deleting the folder `/atmosphere/contents/0100000000001000/`.
####Broken installed sysmodules
***
If you have had installed previously any sysmodules, then please ensure you delete 
the folder `/atmosphere/contents/`.
