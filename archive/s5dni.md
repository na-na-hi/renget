#I won’t leave you behind

>Aubrey is staring at her rotting house, the day has finally come. She tried to control her breathing, it wasn’t working.
>Then, he placed his hand on her shoulder. She turned around to see a grown-up Sunny; ready to walk down this painful path together. All she could do was smile knowing that he was by her side.
>She takes one last deep breath and enters the house. The first thing she sees is her mother, watching nothing but static on the TV with beer in hand.
>”M-Mom…”
>”…”
>”I’m…I’m leaving, for good.”
>”…”
>”Is that so?…”
>Aubrey was shocked by her words, she barely speaks anymore. She felt her hand tighten by Sunny’s, reassuring her that everything will be alright.
>”Y-Yeah…and you’re coming with us.”
>”…”
>”Even after everything that happened between us…you’re still my mother and…I still love you.”
>”…”
>”I-I want to help you! You don’t deserve to be alone, even after everything…we can go to rehab and-“
>”Aubergine…you should just go…”
>”Mom! You know I can’t!”
>”You can…you suffered long enough from my failure.”
>Sunny steps forward to say his piece.
>”Miss…it’s not too late for you.”
>”That voice…hmmmm, you must be that Sunny-boy. The one who broke my daughter’s heart years ago…”
>”Mom it wasn’t like!-“
>He turns around to nod at her, letting her know that he understands. She nods back and tighten the grip of their hands.
>”Remember my sister…Mari.”
>”…”
>”She didn’t die by her own hand, but from mine.”
>”…”
>”I spent those 4 years rotting, somewhat like you right now. I thought there was no redemption for someone like me…but, I soon realized that-“
>He looks towards Aubrey’s face with a small smile.
>Sometimes you need to have a little faith in the people you love…knowing that they may support you no matter what crime you’ve committed.”
>”…”

>”Things can be rough when you stand on your own two feet again, you might even think it’s impossible but…knowing you have people who support and love you, will push you to greater heights.”
>”Mom, Sunny is proof alone that anyone can recover, no matter how bad things were in the past…please, I don’t want you alone here. I won’t let anyone be alone like before, not again.”
>She says while holding onto Sunny’s arm now, reassuring herself she won’t make the same mistake like she did years ago.
>”…”
>…”
>”You’ve grown…sweetheart…”
>”Mom?”
>The dirty old woman stood up and walked towards the TV, she turns it off and drops the beer bottle.
>”Lets…do it your way…”
>”Mom!”
>Aubrey runs to her mother to give her a hug. She gets breaking down, tears of joy falling like a waterfall.
>Her mother held onto her, she hesitated due to her dirty clothes, but that didn’t stop her daughter.
>Her patted Aubrey’s head then looked at Sunny.
>”…take good care of her…”
>Sunny nods, he already ruined his own family. The least he could do is save another…maybe even start a new one.
>Hours later, they arrived at the rehabilitation center in the city. Aubrey’s mother was wearing clean clothes, they were simple; just gray sweatpants and a hoodie. At least they were clean.
>”Sunny and I will clean up the house, you don’t have to worry about that…I’ll call you daily to see how rehab is doing, and I’ll-“
>”Sweetheart, I’m a grown woman…not a toddler.”
>”I-I know but-“
>Her mother rubbed her head for the last time. Aubrey couldn’t help but blush, knowing Sunny was just watching the whole thing.
>Aubrey’s mother starts walking away to the center, but stops for a moment.
>”W-What if I don’t get any better…what if I relapse…”
>”Then you’ll get better again. Because we’ll be there for you, helping you one step at a time.”
>The mother looks at Sunny and chuckles a bit.

>”He’s a real catch, sweetheart.”
>”M-Mom!”
>Aubrey’s mother and Sunny couldn’t help but giggle as Aubrey just pouts at the two teasing her.
>”Take care…”
>Her walks into the building and fades with the crowd. Aubrey took a deep breath and collapsed on the floor with her knees.
>”Aubrey!” Sunny kneels down to make sure she’s alright.
>”It’s okay Sunbun, I’m just a bit exhausted from all of…that.” 
>Sunny puts her arm over his neck and lifts her up. Aubrey couldn’t help but wonder-
>”Y-You think she’ll recover…even just a bit?”
>”Of course she will, honey-bunny…because she’ll have us to count on now.”
>Aubrey smiles, knowing he’ll be there to help her with her mother lifts the world off her shoulders.
>”Honey-bunny?” She said with a smug look.
>”I-I wanted to try something new and!”
>”Pfft.” Aubrey starts laughing as Sunny looks away, completely embarrassed by his nickname for his wife.
>Aubrey leans over to kiss his cheek and whispers.
>”Thank you for everything, sunbun~”
>Sunny gets redder, but he smiles knowing he did something right. If only Mari could see him now, she would be so proud.
>The two head back to their car, hands together. The sun shined brighter that day, better wear some sunglasses.
