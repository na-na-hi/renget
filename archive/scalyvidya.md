# /scaly/ vidya

Resurrection of an older project, listing video games bearing potential relevance in regards to the presence of reptiles. The quality of the actual games vary drastically, the intent is to jot down vidya that people will unironically play solely because it has dragons or lizardmen or dinosaurs or what have you playing at least a secondary role.

Sharks and salamanders are not reptiles.

!!! warning
	Very much always a work in progress.

[TOC]

## Series
At least 2-3 or so games each; we'll get them out of the way first. Largely unsorted.

####Monster Hunter
!!! info
	See **Advanced: Monster Hunter!** threads on /trash/ if you have any inquiries.
**Capcom action games with (mostly) casual grinding and some spin-offs; primarily features reptiles you hunt.**
**Has jumped between a lot of hardware, but is never consistent about multiplat between entries.**

The franchise offers a large selection of wyverns with some grounded basis and also an 'Elder Dragon' category, a more supernatural category of both true dragons with six limbs, but also some weird motherfuckers. As a Hunter, you slay or capture them all the same with a (usually) big weapon of your choice and create or upgrade weapons and armor with their parts.

This isn't a franchise you play in release order.  For which game to start with, generally the latest release will have a more active playerbase or be easier to get into. Some, but not all entries also have an expanded version. If you have a toaster, *Portable 3rd* w/ translation is also a decent entry point despite its age and status as a 'high rank' game, as it can easily be emulated and still has a decent amount of content.

The ***Stories*** JRPG subseries has the player star as a monster rider, practicing monster eugenics as they fight alongside their manlet-sized monsties.

####Spyro
**Insomniac's platforming series on the PSX with a dragon protagonist.**
**A skub-tastic remaster of the trilogy also exists on modern platforms.**

Come on now, you were expecting this. It goes without saying that going past the initial three game results in varying QUALITY.

####The Elder Scrolls
**RPGs set in first-person view that gradually become less WRPG with each iteration.**
**Play these on PC if you don't have brain damage.**

Also known for its lore and modding capabilities, the series features the Argonians as a recurring playable race of lizardmen that can breathe underwater and resist disease. *Morrowind* gives them digitigrade legs, but in most other games (including *Daggerfall*, of where they are also dickless) they are bipedal. *Skyrim* has dragons as the central point of conflict in its main quest, of whose ranks include Charles Martinet. *Online* is the only modern game that allows players to go to the Argonian homeland, Black Marsh.

The general has an [Argonian modding index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1da6nGUtR44JPrgurwGYzxb04e4TbwLPHStmfGCbHQyM/edit) for *Skyrim* specifically if you want to mod the game, as well as some for *Oblivion*.

####Drakenguard
**Features some hack 'n slash and aerial combat.**

The gameplay in these are generally regarded to be bad, but they're also Yoko Taro games so they're also bizarre enough to be endearing in their own right. Some of the entries include dragon partners (Angelus in 1, Mikhail in 3) for the main characters. The Nier games are also related.

####Gex
**Mostly known for its two 3D platformers during 5th gen.**

Filled to the brim with TV and movie references of the time.

####Croc
**Two 3D platformers.**

Another short-lived platforming series, despite having a fairly cheery protagonist these games sometimes have a more eerie atmosphere.

####Bubble Bobble / Puzzle Bobble
**Taito's arcade game series and spin-off.**

In the former, two brothers turn into chibi dragons that blow bubbles in pursuit to rescue their girlfriends from an alcoholic. The latter is a puzzle game series.

####Breath of Fire
**Capcom JRPGs.**

Some of the games have the protagonist have a dragon transformation powerup, and perhaps some very much scaly party members.

####Divinity
**Mostly WRPGs, some of them have /scaly/ relevance.**

Most here may be familiar with Original Sin 2 and their lizardmen, including the Red Prince. There's also Divinity 2 for an adventure game with dragon shapeshifting, while Dragon Commander also features some of that but in the form of being about empire management.

#####Jurassic Park/World
**Dinosaurs.**

*Operation Genesis* is the first park building entry hailing around from 6th gen, *Jurassic World Evolution* and its sequel are its modern successors. There's also a few odd other games out there.

####Dark Souls
**Action games with cool exploration sometimes.**

The other quintessential action game series on this list, featuring a good share of draconic bosses and also transformations made accessible through given covenants the player may join . Though the latter isn't that practical, the first game at least had them fashionable while they want sandwiches in the third. DaS2 instead makes it a set of armor. This should probably get bumped down elsewhere but dragons are already prominent enough throughout the franchise somewhat.

## Standalone
Ideally these should be games where the /scaly/ part is very much relevant.

####Snake
hiss

####Dragon's Dogma
Itsuno from Capcom tries his hand at an action RPG, which garnered something of a cult following. The main antagonist is Grigori, believed to be one of the best vidya dragons around. Play it on PC for a drastically better framerate than on consoles.

*Dragon's Dogma Online*, an MMO spin-off, was taken offline but private server efforts for it are making some tangible progress.

####Angels With Scaly Wings
This is a visual novel, not a video game. Anyway, you are the ambassador to a Earth-like world populated with dragons no bigger than a horse. Like some other furry VNs, it can also be depressing.

####Snoot Game
A parody VN of Goodbye Volcano High that is not only a high quality shitpost that is better than it should be, but will likely unironically remain better than the actual GVH itself if it ever actually comes out. Any presence of it on /v/ will make janitors **completely** assblasted for reasons unknown.

At least one of the devs has decided to make his own commercial VN afterwards, titled *I Wani Hug That Gator!*.

####Golden Treasure: The Great Green
An interactive novel about a draak-kin's (feathered wyvern) life, from egg to adulthood. Survive by exploring, getting stronger and avoiding danger. Hunting and fighting have their separate minigames, the latter a bit more involved. After 3 deaths, you lose your save, but can restart from certain points and keep some permanent upgrades that make it much easier later. Very draconic point of view in writing.

[The anon who suggested this has also provided a link to the game.](https://mega.nz/file/5A4kiBZK#Otp0Zt5kz5AJGJhHM0cLCOhUpa7l7t3oRziLlNbfw78)

####Rune Factory 4
Ventuswill is often revered on /scaly/, so it's only fair that her game goes on here. But it's been released on more platforms now and you STILL can't marry her, goddamn it.

####Dragalia Lost
!!! danger Approaching End of Life.
	The developers are scheduled to end releasing content by July 2022, after which then the end-of-service schedule will be apparent.
Gacha game ventured between Nintendo and Cygames, some of the dragons are popular around these parts and the game has a transformation powerup mechanic involving them. However the latter actually cuts into DPS significantly in practice and was mostly used to tank damage, and the game also needs to cater to vanilla waifufags to presumably keep the lights on and someone also gave the dragons some humanoid forms, further defeating the point.

/scaly/ also has an alliance within the game.

####ARK
One of the more known OPEN WORLD SURVIVAL CRAFTING (and formerly) EARLY ACCESS but with dinosaurs, of which some can be tamed. Also has a more fantasy-themed DLC.

####Drakan
A dragon rider game, with Arokh assisting the player in the air and sometimes ground.

####Snake Pass
An unusual platformer where the central mechanics involve being a snake, you coil and slither around objects to navigate levels and avoid falling.

####Dino Run DX
A standalone, more developed version of the Dino Run flash game of old but would probably pass for pixelshit these days. Run away from the meteor's destruction.

####Century: Age of Ashes
It's a competitive dragon rider game that happens to be free-to-play. As a result, anything could happen so take some caution.

####I of the Dragon
A dragon game hailing from around 2004.

##Browser / Flash
In-browser and Flash games that are a lot more compact than the above, but **aren't pornographic.** Look a bit further down for that.

####[How to Raise a Dragon](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/502747)
A game going through the life cycle of a dragon, you control and influence its upbringing at different stages.

####[Deepest Sword](https://cosmicadventuresquad.itch.io/deepest-sword)
A former flavor of the month the internet made porn of for a bit, you try to make a very long blade to penetrate the dragon's scales and slay it.

####[Flight Rising](https://www1.flightrising.com/)
Browser game about breeding dragons, that has at least one anon in the general still playing or keeping tabs on it.

## Lewd
!!! warning
	This section could use some expansion. There are very likely plenty of these by now that are better than these offerings.

####[Kobold Adventure](https://koboldadventure.com/)
It's a text adventure game where you go through the hardships of being a kobold.

####[Flexible Survival](https://blog.flexiblesurvival.com/p/flexible-survival-singleplayer.html)
Coming in both single player and even MUD forms, both are text adventures sharing the premise of the furry apocalypse happening, where defeat in combat, items, and certain scenes can transform the player. There are a few reptilian transformations as with some NPCs. Still under development, the Godot build appears to be a different game entirely.

####[Grove](https://grovedevelopment.itch.io/groverpgnsfw)
A gay-oriented RPG Maker game with a humanoid dragon protagonist and some of his kin exploring cursed as fuck lands, with corruption as an overarching theme. Still under development, but reaching the end of story content at least unlocks a gallery for you to see bad end content without needing to throw battles.


## Character Creators or Mods
This is for anything with powerful enough player character editing or has any notable mods, but bears little relevance to /scaly/ in literally any other way.

####[Guncaster](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=37066)
A GZDoom gameplay mod that can be ran with most Doom WADs, the player character is an overpowered, anthropomorphic dragon who uses both guns and magic in tandem, also able to fly freely. Created by the Russian Overkill dev, the overall quality of the mod is also very high despite the premise, but it's also very overtuned in strength on purpose as a result.

####Second Life
Still somehow kicking almost 20 years later despite having a shitty engine, basically anything /scaly/ should be possible to make as an avatar, be it bipedal or quadruped. The catch is that SL works on an economy; you'll likely have to fork up money or somehow get enough lindens from someone since any good avatar isn't free, and some specific knowhow may also be required to achieve given results if you don't buy a holistic avatar. If you've had any experience with modding Bethesda games - what with body mods and needing clothing meshes that fit them, it's sort of similar but with everything behind microtransactions.

Obviously it is also up to you on what you will actually do with your avatar afterwards. 

As there are multiple third-party clients available, [Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org/) is typically recommended for general use but others do at least have other niches. If you are doing degenerate things, it does have RLV built-in as well.

####VRchat, NeosVR, etc
Seriously nigger? You can pretty much just use any model properly rigged for these. [You can even *be* the Tama!](https://arcticmoray.gumroad.com/l/mizmiz)

####Phantasy Star Online 2
!!! danger *New Genesis* in itself in a rough spot as far as the actual game goes by Sega trying to do open world shit, while base *PSO2* itself has minimal support since it more or less finished.
Arguably has the best character editor in a game without access to user-made assets (compared to the above two); creative use of accessories can accomplish a ton of things, yielding a reptilian/draconic appearance isn't that hard but this is still a service game, so this may involve needing to build up a collection over a sizeable amount of time for desired results. Playing as a CAST can be an easier way out of accomplishing this with cybernetic-looking parts. If you're skeptical, artist [agitype01](https://twitter.com/agitype01/status/1481838081217302528?t=8UA-S2FX4-jiD9a4uvnWJg&s=19) has a knack for figuring out scaly/furry getups within PSO2.

The original PSO2 features draconic mobs and characters from a planet named Amduskia, where they play a largely minor role but come back for some relevance in the final episode. Strangely, most of its boss-type enemies have female voiceovers for their rarer counterparts.


##Honorable Mentions?
Maybe this can be a section for games that contain scaly characters or critters worth mentioning, playable or not, but don't really fit elsewhere. However there can be a lot of 'token scaly' characters or races out there (ie Sorlag in QC, Goris in FO2, or XCOM 2 vipers) and this could be long. The editor will see if there's demand for it, possibly a section for relevant playable factions (ie in 4X games or RTS or whatever) could work too.

Stuff like MTX will probably just be left out on the whole since I don't think anyone here would really care about paying money to have a pet dragon follow you around in Path of Exile or something else gay like that.
