```md
>You are a lucky human and you have a lucky monster boyfriend.
>You love him and he probably loves you. He never said it directly, though.
>He appears to fail at man speech, but you perfectly understand his set of growls, snarls and hisses, and he likes to unexpectedly throw them at you and watch you jolt in fear.
>Living together in his home, he eats food you make specially for him and works as pillow and quilt in the bed.
>Every night, he just lays there immobile for you in his bed, you suspect his kind never sleeps, though.
>You dream about him often in your sleep.
>This relationship is probably something more than you being his pet. You hope so.
>What would such a four-handed, clawy, 3 m high, 2 m wide creature need a hairless ape for?
>Ideas race in your head, but all of them are equally terrifying, and half of them hot.

>One day it's the 5-year anniversary.
>You want to make a very special present for him.
>Something he will remember till the end of his life.
>Something you will remember till the end of your life.
>Something for both of you, to have each other nearby, forever.
>You want to offer yourself as a gift.
>Not that he will fuck you restless, you fuck each other daily anyway.
>It's a bit tricky on your side, since his bottom opening is between his triple-tentacle cock.
>And cock usually inside a slit hole with curious trapdoor.
>Yet he seems always content when you stick some part of yourself there.
>Other way is much simpler, albeit his members can penetrate you till appendix.
>Though it's suspicious he tried to fuck you in the urethra once.
>However, there is one secret of their species, you discovered only recently.
>Totally want it.
>It's part of their weird reproduction mechanics, you failed to grasp the full context, though.

>Few days ago, you decided to quit your job.
>Also decided to shave an entire body, including hair and eyebrows.
>Wondered about eyelashes, but left them alone for now.
>In zoological shop you bought your boyfriend's favourite raw seafood.
>Thinking now, you should have shaved your eyebrows after doing shopping, instead of before.
>Soon you will be getting much more weird stares, though.
>Found fettuccine for your dish, out of the forgotten part of the cupboard.
>Spend the midday bathing yourself, preparing dishes, laying table and lighting candles.
>You made a cute monster-shaped nest out of the cushions on the bed.

>Finally your soulmate returns home, it's Friday evening.
>He sees the whole ceremonial setup.
>His human sitting behind a table of steaming dishes, naked, in a candle-lit room.
>You stare at the silhouette in the corridor.
>As wide as two doors.
>Covered in hard plates of dark scales and anthracite skin in other places.
>Smooth, perfectly round head crouching below a ceiling.
>Broken line of pointy teeth curving around, right in the middle of what would be called face.
>Four glowing vertical purple slits on his forehead.
>Somehow his eye openings are usually closed, yet he doesn't bump into walls. You hope to soon learn his secret.
>Wiggling his claws in all of the four hands, he makes a questioning growl.
>It's been a long time since you learned his limited vocabulary, but he seems to understand over a dozen human languages in speech and writing.
>"It's our anniversary, remember?" you slowly announce "I wanted to make a special gift for you. For both of us."
>On a cupboard lies an encyclopedia of his species, you point at the book.
>It's opened at the specific page, with very disturbing images.
>The dark creature towers over it for what seems like an eternity, and then turns back at you, his eyes became violet circles now.
>You don't remember seeing them like that. Ever.
>"I hope you want to do this as much as I do." you state.
>"My mind is decided. I organised everything for this to come today."
>Next to a book is a pile of documents, stating you are free to disappear from the face of the Earth now.
>"Do it, for me, let it be your anniversary present." you barely can hold excitement, and hope for the same for him.
>You put an arm around his thick neck, you had to stand on a chair for this, feeling parts where scales turn into skin.
>Gently tug him in the direction of the bed.

>He slowly sits on it, under his weight a bed shifts down 30 cm.
>You kiss his maw, feeling exposed rows of scales/teeth with your lips, tasting his saliva.
>Smells sweet and soapy, opposite of the usual food and other substances he normally digests.
>His external canines are so sensitive, he starts to purr as you slowly lick them, watching out not to pierce the tongue.
>Eye slits are closed now and pressing your mouth onto him, you manage to make him lay on his back, in a prepared nest of pillows.
>You grip his digitigrade feet, tickling their underclaws a little, dark claws wrapping around your hands.
>Then strongly push them against the body, on the bed. It took surprisingly little force.
>As if he helped you to slide himself deeper into a warm nest.
>Now it's your turn to lay down.

>The best position would be if you laid on back, on his torso.
>You awkwardly climb a huge dark mountain.
>His enormous muscles are like somewhat hard, yet squishy pillows.
>There is a dedicated spot to put a head on, between 4 of the pectorals on the chest.
>You spread out the rest of the limbs.
>Legs on his legs and arms on his lower arms. Your palms don't even reach his elbows.
>You grab one of his enormous limbs and barely lift it on your chest.
>The feeling is as if someone sat down on you.
>Five sharp claws start to gently pinch your skin.
>You close eyes. You are blind with them closed, unlike your mate.
>Soon there is a feeling of more delicate stings around the body.
>There are five sharp points more.
>And then next five.
>And next five.
>The weight makes you almost suffocate, but 20 delicate talons massage every part of you now.
>Smooth claws, each of the size of your fist. Then rough, but still gentle scales following. And parts of a soft skin between them.
>Four of them are pinching your nipples.
>You normally experience this every second day. On other times you massage his body with puny little hman fingers.
>It's nice and all, but you wouldn't mind to advance to the next part. Before you change the mind.

>Then there is a new feeling.
>Little movement from below, and opening crevices of warmth.
>Oh my God, it's happening!
>You feel sharp scales slowly moving away from below your body, showing an incredibly soft and cosy structures inside.
>Sinking in it, you peek about what colour are your boyfriend's rubbery insides.
>They are purplish, the same hue as his eyes, maw, tongue and obviously, triple cock.
>By the way, you feel something is touching a tip of your length. Something wet, wiggling and slippery.
>It's spreading a slime.
>You decide to keep eyes closed and relax even more, as your legs slowly descend down.
>The number of massaging points got lowered by half and soon you feel uneven terrain also below the hands.
>Scales gave way below your fingertips and they fell into a warm sticky glue.
>Then the palms follow.
>At then your spine ridge gets the same treatment.
>You try to wiggle the feet, but they are now held in a prison from all of the sides.
>The pressure from above is slowly applied along your arms too.
>Your fingers and toes become numb for some reason. You wonder if it's because they are probably being dissolved.
>The mate starts to purr, in this weird deep tone. You hardly can catch those infrasonic harmonics with your human ears.
>Waves with different velocities travel through squishy surroundings below you and denser surfaces above.
>Meeting right inside your guts. You are being massaged from all of the sides.
>Then you feel some hot splash on the forehead.
>You cannot mistake it with anything else, it must be your boyfriend's mighty tongue.
>Nice forked long purple muscular and drenched in saliva.
>It makes its journey all around your face, the newly shaved scalp, visiting both nostrils at once, tightly closed eyelids, the now half-submerged ears and finally, lips.
>You invite it deep inside to meet your own teeth. You love the musky taste it leaves.
>It's a farewell, though.
>You believe you will never experience feelings like that again. Or will you?
>The visitor soon leaves, shortly after strolling the last loop around your own tongue and peeking into the throat.
>But then something unexpected happens, a new object slowly gets slid in as a replacement, leaning against your cheek and submerged neck.
>It's a pipe?
>You try to breathe through it and end up inhaling his usual scent and some incredibly potent humid pheromones. Right into your lungs.
>Intrusion makes its way deeper and deeper until it reaches the throat.
>And then a gag forming between your teeth, locking the pipe in the mouth.
>You won't be able to split it out, even if you wanted.
>But you don't.
>That comes just in time as your nose gets overflowed with his insides, and cut off from the outside world. And oxygen.
>Now breathing through the smelly tube, you start to drift away.
>During all this time, a pressure from above was constantly spreading from your hands and legs.
>It now reached torso and head. Those must be the surface scales closing back on you.
>You are now fully locked inside.
>It's like those 1000 embraces you were giving him daily, got all returned in one absolute hug.
>The pressure is overwhelming.
>The only exposed part of your body appears to be your stiff member. Still leaking something.
>Cacophony of heartbeats is heard.
>Yours beats faster, and there is a second one, much larger, deeper and slower.
>You think something is changing, because both oscillations slowly change frequency and then phase.
>Soon there is only one heartbeat.
>Same frequency. Same phase. Double the amplitude.
>You both got synchronised.
>Your heart slowed down and his sped up. Quite amazing, you believe.

>Now a new surprise.
>But this time deep under your half-aware body.
>Making its way slowly into the rear opening.
>But how is it possible? His cocks were left outside. In fact you still feel one of them trying to fit into your peehole.
>Unless… yes, that's another pipe.
>You relax your sphincter to open the gates, welcoming an unexpected guest.
>It entered the insides, this is a familiar feeling.
>But it expanding, and forming a knot, was not.
>You are stuffed and tied from both sides now.
>Well, you won't need that second hole anyway, so why bother?
>Yet you sense it may have something to do with those parts of encyclopedia, you failed to understand.
>Or maybe no-one managed to study this internal cock phenomenon before?
>The newly entered tentacle raised its width even more, slowly stretching your sphincter.
>It would have hurt, if you hadn't been so numb already.
>There is also a distant feeling as if you need to pee.
>Yet this new bladder appears to have a different position.
>And it's something else than pee. And not poop. And definitely not sperm.
>You failed to hold it anyway. Or it wasn't you who let it flow? Whatever.
>Feeling of a hard smooth cold object entering your bowels.
>And then your hole is allowed to shrink a little, but the filling sensation advances deeper.
>Wondering about what has happened, an external thought appeared in your mind.
>You just have been injected with an egg!
>Got turned into an incubator for his monsternets.
>…our monsternets.
>Or maybe they will hatch there inside you, and you are supposed to be eaten alive instead?
>You decide that both of those possibilities were worth getting absorbed.
>As long as your mate needs it, you are ready to become a protein source if necessary.
>Another sphere got slowly pushed inside.
>And then another and another.
>You feel the skin on your belly getting stretched, and then it got numb, just like the rest of the body.
>That means your boyfriend is not really a boyfriend, but a girlfriend?
>But those cocks… maybe he is a hermfriend?
>That would explain why you've never read about genders of his species.
>Anyway, it seems to not matter anymore now.
>A distant thought appeared, agreeing with you.
>Can he read your mind? Can you read his?
>You sigh through the wet pipe and feel his overwhelming being in the throat, then lungs, and then bloodstream.

>Weird thoughts start racing inside your head. You feel a little feral now.
>There is something heartwarming in them, as if running wild naked was an amazing feeling.
>You now remember chasing something in the forest in the moonlight, and distant feel of hot blood splashing your maw.
>You move the tongue to lick a memory around, but mouth feels awkward.
>As if you have been at the dentist and your teeth are shaped a little differently now.
>Wiggling your muscle gives both unfamiliar and bound feeling, plus some vague taste of a musky pipe.
>You try to lick the lips, but you cannot do so.
>Both because your tongue is obstructed by something, and because you don't feel any lips now. Just a rows of pointy teeth.
>You try to feel the hands. Both are half-numb at this point.
>You don't even know where they are located. No, wait. You do. You are aware of them. One, two... three, four.
>Shouldn't there be only two of them? No, you remember you always had four upper limbs.
>Managing to focus on one arm, you try to move it around, feeling it as if it was covered with some heavy armour plates.
>You bend to touch your torso and it also feels as it you were wearing some kind of thick clothes.
>Lifting up one segment of this hard suit with a claw ends up being painful, so you abandon this idea.
>The bed is still there. And a round wall of cushions on it.
>Funny, you would swear they were colourful, but now you cannot remind yourself their hue and they all look similar.
>They are filled inside with soft feathers. You know the position of the pointy tip of each of them. But how, since they are inside? You just know apparently, somehow.
>There is also some kind of a warmness on the table and two flat containers of organic material.
>You see them, even though a table surface should be obstructing the view.
>One of the dishes there are your favourite small ocean creatures, still barely alive. And on the second there are some wet strings.
>You prepared one of the foods. No, you prepared both, don't you remember that?
>You never liked the flat ropes thing, but yet you feel like you would happily devour this food as well now. Weird.
>Your body gets raised from the bed, as if automatically and without your will.
>It sits on a weirdly sized chair. You remember it always has been too big for you. And yet it matches perfectly.
>The fire support columns are almost depleted now and should be taken out. You decided to pinch them with the talons, like you always did. But then remember it could be painful.
>So you try to blow off the fire. You blow and blow, but only a gurgling sound comes out of your maw.
>Oh, right.
>You never had air pockets, unlike your human. Why did you think you could blow off a candle in the first place?
>Where is he anyway, your human?
>You scan and experience the whole room without moving a muscle. You failed to find both a human and the monster in it. Where did they go?
>Calling them by name may be a good idea, but instead of words, only weird growling noises come out of you. And you accidentally bit your tongue.
>You decide to find them again later.
>Anyway, the food on a table should be eaten warm. Even though the living water creatures cannot be boiled, because they would be dead in that case.
>Yet you have some questions about eating living things, even though you did it so many times before.
>There are also some thin, clear paper rectangles on a second furniture. You remember them having writing on, despite clearly being blank now.
>One of them is supposed to inform that you decided to not attend to a special place anymore. The one, where they give you money.
>Why would you ever need such place, you don't need money to survive, right? You can just go and catch something in the forest, it's easy.

>You note the fourth cock just above three of yours, weird. It's short, straight and weirdly shaped.
>You touch it and feel warm pleasure deep inside yourself.
>It feels as nice as touching your other three prehensile tentacles.
>It started to pulsate on its own, so you decide to stroke it even more.
>You want to lick it, just like you always did, you will have to lay on your back instead of torso for this, but why?
>Leaning forward appeared to be difficult, as if something inside your body was blocking the movement. Never before had you this problem.
>So you decide to wrap and pull the flesh rod with your left bottom hand.
>The weird thing then spurs some more goo and you remember the familiar feeling.
>Then got a thought about using the other three cocks to make them stroke that fourth cock for you.
>Just like you always did.
>You remember having good control over them, but this time you need to help yourself with your talons.
>You configure and twist them in a form of a tube and stick over that upper leaking one to redirect the goo, to your only other opening.
>It's located between the tentacles. You have thoughts of the warm rod sliding inside of it and wonder why it is now in such a weird position, to not being able to do so anymore.
>Suddenly a fourth cock shoots a sticky liquid, you know you have been covered with it before. And its taste.
>It gets redirected towards an opening, and another memory of such things appears in your mind.
>A pleasurable feeling envelops your whole self. You never experienced anything like this.
>Then the weird cock slowly descends, hiding inside the body, never to be seen again. Your hard scales fit into place after it.
>It would be quite unwise to let it leak inside you now. Staining the purplish smooth warm structure.
>Some back-head thought tells you you should form yet another internal pipe to contain a hidden organ.
>But where to put that leaking substance?
>You could redirect its output to the first one, so nothing would be lost.
>As you do so, you feel how a warm substance gets transferred through the tube to another one.
>And you taste a salty flavour in mouth yet again.
>Weird. There is nothing in your mouth right now, though.
>You decide to try repeating the pulling process with the other three cocks.
>It's easier, since they naturally wrap around your claws and brush sensitive areas under the plates of the scales.
>After short time of such play, you yet again experience a new pleasurable feeling and a sticky warmth inside of the new internal pipe.
>Long things start to slither and hide back into the body. At the end, they plugged the hole with something like triple petals.
>Trying to insert a claw between them results in hard blockage.
>You feel you will see them again soon, when they come out at their own, when the time is right.

>A vibration starts in all of your body again. This time it didn't do it by itself. You know how to start purring.
>You self-massage yourself, and that new body insert you got, with infra-sounds, until you remembered this is not healthy for the eggs.
>The eggs that are now kept warm and safe deep inside you. Deeper than previously for some reason. And you remember laying them somewhere.
>You think you will be needing more food now, so you decide to try to eat what's left in front of you on both of the plates.
>Small sea creatures easily slide into your throat, as always. They tickle the internals while trying to get free.
>You take them one by one, fishing them out with your skilled tongue.
>This is not enough, you are still unsatisfied. There is that second human food there, though.
>The oily strings are difficult to catch with the same technique. Then you decide to just bite everything and cut with teeth to smaller pieces.
>It's messy and you think you should have used a fork. You also think you never needed a fork before.
>After eating, you randomly slap the whole head with your tongue. This time successfully. It takes over a hundred loops to lick yourself clean.
>Then you decide to walk around a little, but right after standing up, you immediately fall under some huge weight right back into a bed.
>Only managed to stand on all six for now, as if you forgot how to walk on your hind arms.
>It's not worth trying. Your huge mass falls down on the bed again.
>You lay like this for a longer moment, then become sleepy.
>It's the first time you experience this feeling. Normally you just stayed cuddled with you human for a whole night time.
>But unlike you, human was becoming unresponsive when held in four strong arms. And then felt refreshed at the dusk.
>So you decide to give in and fall into darkness like never before.
>You fall asleep, still experiencing hugging that warm human of yours, even though your hands are empty for the first time in many months.
