Chapter 3: Tama Stroll
An: One day during recess, Tamacchi-senpai said such a thing:
WaYu: Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Yu: Look that way!
Wa: Whoa.
WaYu: Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Wa: Look that way!
Yu: That was close!
WaYu: Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!
Wa: Look that way!
Yu: Oh!
An: They're really picking up speed.
Hi: The two of them have great reflexes.
Ta: Okay, okay! Be quiet for a moment, guys! ...Uhm, how to say it in a cool way... Searching, searching... That's right, "attention."
Ta: Attention please, everyone!
Hi: What is it, Tamako-san?
Ta: Listen, you know, just for today, Tama's gonna do something really nice for you.
Wa: Thanks, but I'm fine.
Ch: I'll pass on that.
Hi: Tamako-san, please go for it!
Ta: Ahaha! Don't be shy, guys! You at the awkward age, huh? That's exactly why Tama's worried about you. It's no easy time for the heart, you know.
Wa: I really am fine though.
Ta: Yuuna, you really, really want Tama do do something nice for you, don't you?
Yu: You've already done e-...
Ta: Don't you!?
Ya: Of course! Yeah! Right, Gun-chan?
Ch: Uhm, well... If Takashima-san says so...
Ta: Alright, it's a deal! Prepare yourselves!
An: Here!
Ta: Yes, Anzu?
An: Concretely speaking, what are you going to do?
Ta: Hm. I'll do house visits. Or rather, room visits.
Ch: Huh?
Ta: Tama's gonna come to your rooms and observe your daily lives from "good morning" till "good night!"
Ch: Eeh...
Hi: Oh my! You're kindness personified.
Ta: I know, right? It's fine as long as it's not ta much, don't you think?
An: But you come to my room all the time, Tamacchi-senpai.
Ta: Tama knows better than anyone that you're a good girl, Anzu. You're off the hook this time.
An: Then... whose room are you going to visit?
Ta: Who's it gonna be, who's it gonna be~. Durururururururururururururu...
Yu: Like a spinning roulette wheel?
Ch: I have a terribly bad feeling about this...
Ta: Okay, Chikage! It's you!
Ch: I thought as much. I refuse.
Ta: Isn't it about time you drop the shy girl act?
Ch: I understand that we need to cooperate in battle. Having our meals together... well, I can sort of understand that too. But don't come hang out in my room.
Ta: That's too bad. Then I'll be nice and settle for observing you after school for now.
Ch: ...!
Ta: I'm gonna follow you everywhere! This is how caring Tama is.
An: Tamacchi-senpai, in short...
Hi: You just want to have fun, isn't that right?
Ta: But you don't really dislike it, right, Chikage?
Ch: Tch.
Ta: Oh, are you a tsundere?
An: It seems like she really doesn't want it...
Ta: Tama will show you warmth! A moderate warmth like that of ramen left out in the open for about 10 minutes!
An: The noodles would get soggy.
Yu: Then I'm gonna join that after school event!
Ta: Hey, hey! Yuuna, you're such a spoiled kid. Sure thing.
Ya: Ah! Thank you so much!
Ta: I like your response! Three Tama points for you!
Ya: Thanks!
Ch: If Takashima-san is there... I guess...
 
Ya: And such, after school, the three of us went to a game center at Gun-chan's suggestion.
Ta: An arcade, huh? What a busy place.
Ch: Is it too cramped in here for an outdoor lover? You can go home if you like, no need to force yourself.
Ta: No worries, no worries. Tama doesn't dislike this kinda atmosphere.
Ch: Ugh...
Ta: You play games all the time, don't you, Chikage? No wonder you love places like this.
Ch: Well, not really that much though.
Ta: Whatcha gonna play? I'll cheer you on.
Ch: All right. I will play this one.
Yu: Ah! Gun-chan, you're going for a shooting game! Starting off with guns blazing!
Ch: Yeah.
Ta: Let's see what you got.
Yu: Gun-chan's amazing!
Ta: That's pinpoint accuracy!
Yu: As expected of Gun-chan!
Ch: The enemy is hiding here!
Ch: It only seems as if this enemy's weak spot is its head... it's the crystal on its shoulder!
Ch: This appears to be a scripted defeat at first glace. The probability to win is displayed as 0%, but that's just because this game rounds down fractions. In truth, I can beat it with a less than one percent chance!
Ch: Heh... And that's game clear.
Ta: Wow! Without using any continues!
Yu: Gun-chan, you even got the high score!
Ta: You ranked first, that's tamazing!
Ch: Now, to enter my name... T. K. G.
Yu: Tamago kake gohan!?
Ch: ...Chikage.
Yu: Ah, sorry...!
Ch: I use this one when there's a three letter limit. Otherwise I'd use C-Shadow or something...
Yu: C-Shadow...!
Ch: Yeah.
Ta: C-Shadow!
Ch: Stop repeating it.
Ya: That's so cool!
Ta: Yeah, so cool!
Ch: ...Thank you...
Ta: Alright. How about you fight against Tama next?
Ch: You still want to challenge me after seeing my skills just now?
Ta: I'm not gonna lose when it comes ta ma reflexes.
Ch: Heh... interesting.
Yu: You sure are getting along!
 
Ta: And that's how I had some fun with Chikage and Yuuna after school!
Hi: Now you've openly admitted that you just had fun.
Ta: I'm not worried about those two so I wrapped it up early. ...And that's why it's your turn this evening, Hinata!
Hi: Oh my!
Ta: The kind Tama will check how you're living your life.
Hi: Oh my, oh my.
Ta: Prepare yourself!
Hi: Please don't be too hard on me.
Ta: That depends on your attitude.
Hi: Would you like a cream puff?
Ta: Yes please!
Hi: Here, eat up.
Ta: Yummy! So yummy!
Ta: ...So, why are you here, Wakaba?
Wa: Because this is my room.
Hi: Wakaba and I often stay at the other's room in the evening.
Ta: Mhmm... Okay! Just act natural now, I wanna see how you spend your days.
Ta: ...What's up? Aren't you gonna do anything?
Wa: I guess so.
Hi: Right. Usually we'd read books together or do something else to pass the time.
Wa: It's not like we do anything in particular every day.
Hi: But when the two of us are together...
Wa: ...We can relax, yeah. Even if we don't do anything.
Ta: You sure are taking it easy... You're like students from Kichijouji.
Wa: What!? Have you been to Kichijouji before?
Ta: Nah, I just really want to go there so I referenced it. Like Shibuya or something...
Wa: Shibuya, huh. It's true, those are places Shikoku girls like us yearn for.
Ta: By the way, do you know why the building in front of Shibuya Station is called "109?"
Wa: I have no idea. Does it have a meaning?
Ta: Apparently it comes from the business hours and the name of the company that runs it.
Wa: Wow, you know a lot.
Ta: I read it on the net! ...Oh, we got off track. I see, so you're usually just reading books and stuff.
Hi: Ah, I know! Speaking of books, we do this thing while we're reading.
Wa: Ah, that.
Hi: While we're reading our books, we do like this...
Wa: We lock our legs together or tread against the other's.
Ta: What's the point of that?
Hi: Oh, we do it to keep our legs occupied.
Wa: Yeah. We're just teasing each other a little.
Ta: I-I understand...
 
Ta: So basically, Hinata and Wakaba were chilling out.
An: Huh. We talked about it before, but they're like a married couple.
Ta: Yeah. The atmosphere was so relaxed that it made me all fidgety.
An: So, why did you come to my room? You said you wouldn't come today.
Ta: Ah, I forgot. That's what I said during lunch, huh? Well, ya know, Tama's feet kinda started walking towards your place.
An: That's very you, Tamacchi-senpai.
Ta: Now that I'm here, I might as well do something senpai-like for you, Anzu.
An: It's fine. You're always doing that for me already.
Ta: That so?
Ta: But now that I'm here, I really should do something.
An: Eh? I said it's fine...
Ta: Tama's gonna cook for you! Tama's kitchen!
An: Why are you trying to add that punch line there?
Ta: Calling it a punch line, how rude! Whether it's our dinner or the Vertexes' goose, Tama's gonna cook it!
An: This isn't the time for witty remarks...
Ta: For starters, let's heat some eggs in the microwave.
Yu: After this, Tama-chan enjoyed a delicious dinner.
