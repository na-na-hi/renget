greetings, i am lucia-- though i go by other names, too. just ask. i use **any** pronouns, preferring she/he/it/[%black%!~neos~!%%](https://pronouns.cc/@seraphlaser). im lesbian and i use xenogender labels-- however for the most part i choose to not speak of my gender. 
i am severely ill and have little to no empathy for others. my conditions also impact the way i communicate/think about others, along with what i believe. often, i may be in my own world. i am prone to making jokes in regards to my own experiences (sh/suicide, beating, etc.) i have the inability to recognize tone to some degree, please do not get pissy if i don't understand you the first time. im very gatekeep-y with some of my special interests and favorite characters, especially those who i heavily identify with
i may seem mean. for the most part, i try not to be, but be aware that i am easily provoked and i will be mean if i desire. if i dont respond, i'm either asleep, purposefully ignoring you, or unstable, sorry ^\_^"! 
i use neos, xenos, titles and nonhumanity terms sorrh for being cringe Guh
