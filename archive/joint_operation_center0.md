This is the still relatively fresh library of /ope/, the Nerissa Ravencroft General. In here, the users of the general or any other people will find any useful information about things related to The Demon of Sound and Lover of Idols. Be it her musical productions or informations about her streams (general ones and mengens alike) at the current state. Will expend eventually according to the needs of the general.

!!! warning About recorders (ytarchive, twitterspaces...), a bunch of neet tools and how to use them, please refer to /who/'s tools guide: https://rentry.org/xu6td. You're going to need it and you're likely to use some of that stuff at some point, especially for unarchived karaokes.
