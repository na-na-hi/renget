#### Hello, World!
>*“Programming is learned by writing programs.”* —Brian Kernighan

*"Here, we present the simplest C++ program that actually does anything. The purpose of writing this program is to
• Let you try your programming environment
• Give you a first feel of how you can get a computer to do things for you
Thus, we present the notion of a program, the idea of translating a program from human-readable form to machine instructions using a compiler, and finally executing those machine instructions."*
