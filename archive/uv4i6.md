It was almost Halloween and Clark had no fucking idea what he was going to do. He was getting desperate to get out of the shitty "mandatory" Halloween party that his office was having and he was running out of time. He was looking for ways to skip out entirely. He spent all week actually getting work done so his boss couldn't fuck him over that way. He carefully avoided the assholes in HR so they couldn't "volunteer" him for some more stupid bullshit that he could care less about. He sat there, rubbed his eyes, and ran a hand through his blonde hair, remembering how fucking boring and awkward the office party was last year.

"Man, this is fucking lame" he said to himself while getting up from his desk and scrambling for ideas. He went into the break room and noticed a bowl of keto-friendly, gluten free bullshit they were trying to serve as a healthy option instead of actual candy on Halloween. 

His eyes widened. He grabbed a nearby pen and some paper and wrote a quick note: "Hey I'm running to go get snacks and stuff for the party, be back later" 

Perfect. The only problem now was getting out without being seen. He put his phone on silent and looked around the corner. 

Nobody was there. 
He glanced at the clock on the wall and noticed it was almost 4:00 P.M. With his luck, everyone was on the other side of the building putting up decorations. He quickly walked outside and made his way towards his car. He let out a sigh of relief, turned the keys in the ignition, and drove away. 

Since it wasn't too chilly outside, he decided to run to the store to actually pick up some snacks and a six-pack of beer. That way he could wander off into the woods, get buzzed, and ignore people in costumes knocking on his door all night. He paid for all his stuff, got back in his car and drove home.

Clark was glad the weekend was finally here. All he had to worry about right now was finding a good spot to sit around and drink his beer at. He figured what he was wearing was enough. Just some jeans, a nice fitting hoodie, and an undershirt. 

He was looking forward to this all week. No stress. No office bullshit. No problems to take care of. Just some peace and fucking quiet. He grew up hearing all sorts of weird rumors about the woods he always visited. Far as he knew, he never saw any weird shit so he didn't care.

Sure, sometimes he heard weird shit off in the distance, but he figured it was just wildlife, and it's not like it could be anything huge since it was so close to a city. It never crossed his mind to be careful out here. It was just a casual twenty minute walk home anyways. 

It was a little colder than usual tonight. He took a few deep breaths, and stared up at the moon while he cracked open his first beer. He sipped on it slowly at first, remembering that he skipped lunch today since people were having a gluten free "taste test" for the office party. 

"Fucking gross" he mumbled to himself and chuckled, while draining the rest of the can. He grabbed another can and smiled. "Gluten free? More like flavor free" he cracked up at his own shitty joke while staring off in the distance.

He stopped laughing for just a moment to do a terrible impression of his co-worker talking about "the health benefits of the keto diet" . He couldn't even finish before he was doubled over on the ground, holding his sides from laughing so much. He stayed like that for a while, before rolling over onto his back. He was having kind of a shitty week, and he really needed that.
 
He heard a twig snap and froze. He was a little too drunk to realize where it came from, so he just looked around randomly while sitting up. He squinted to try and see the seven foot tall creature that was peering at him. Figuring it was nothing, he grabbed another can of beer and opened it while it got closer. 

The demonic goat-hybrid walked toward him slowly. He was mostly covered in thick brown fur, except for his coffee colored neck, stomach and thighs. Two massive black horns sat on his head and curled back like a Ram's. Despite how cold it was tonight, he was wearing nothing but a thin shirt and a loincloth. The barely modest clothes did nothing to hide the creature's strength, the veins on his massive arms, or the fat bulge between his legs. The creature, Zanoll, needed some sort of offering before it could return, and Clark seemed like the perfect target.


The demon walked up to Clark and he just sat there, wondering how someone wasted that much money for a Halloween gag. Thinking it was just someone in a costume, he waved the creature over and tossed him a can of beer. He sat there in disbelief which slowly turned into panic when he watched it puncture a small hole in the top of the can and start drinking instead of using fingers. 

Trying to appear calm and failing, he started talking: "That was cool, what else can you do?" The last time someone asked him that, he pointed at a tree and set it on fire. Zanoll looked at him, raised an eyebrow and sat there wondering how he could appease this human's curiosity without having him run off.  He figured he would tone it back a bit and instead scorched some grass on the ground into a smiley face. 

For some reason the fear left Clark, and he sat there, amazed. "Well uh, can you talk? Like uh, you know, in English and stuff?" Zanoll scoffed at him and started laughing. It came out short and ragged, and got deeper the longer he laughed. He finally spoke up in a strange voice that Clark almost couldn't understand. The creature raised an eyebrow and said, "Yes, This one has a learned tongue". His voice fluctuated constantly, like two people were speaking. Sometimes his eyes gave off a weird, faint glow that made his wide pupils look even stranger. Zanoll sat down next to Clark, and continued sipping the beer. Every now and then he would use his unreasonably long tongue to lick the beer off his chin.

Clark took the time to look at Zanoll more closely now. His eyes were slightly yellow, his thick, brown fur looked amazing to touch despite the situation he found himself in. Clearly he wasn't cold since all he was wearing was a loincloth and a thin shirt. Clark couldn't help himself. Everywhere he looked the demon was muscular, with a thin layer of fat. His pecs and thighs were massive, and every now and then, he took a glance at the demon's fat dick that just hung there. As cold as it was, he was at least six inches soft, with a pair of orange-sized balls. He forced himself to look away, but Zanoll didn't really mind. He figured it was simple curiosity that all humans showed. 

He was careful about the effect his kind had on humans, but on a night like this, it didn't really matter. He did get an offering, after all. 

The two kept sipping on beer while Clark's restraint got lower and lower as time went on. Wanting to speed things up, Zanoll looked at Clark with a smug grin, and scooted closer to him, and purposely let his fat, uncut dick flop out. 

Clark's eyes widened and he almost choked on his beer. He stared while the demon's dick fully hardened to ten inches and almost as wide as the beer can he was holding. He compared the two, looked up at the smug goat demon, and looked back down. "Holy fuck". 

Normally, this sort of shy demeanor would have amused Zanoll, but this wasn't going to satisfy his craving for human dick. 

Zanoll leaned in, took a few deep breaths and let his pupils dilate. He even smiled a bit to show he wasn't threatening, then pushed Clark over and positioned himself above him. His fat cock rubbed against Clark's shirt and left a trail of precum. Zanoll looked down at him, and licked his lips before speaking up in that weird, two-toned voice, "This one senses what you crave." he started to chuckle, and turned it into a playful growl while he lowered his snout to Clark's face. "Let's hope you can satisfy me..." He started panting while he gave into his arousal, spilling more precum on Clark's shirt while he leaned in closer and started licking Clark's face. 

Too drunk to care anymore, Clark started kissing back. He playfully grabbed his horns and stopped when he heard Zandoll growl at him, then felt the demonic goat shove his fat tongue in his mouth and pull him in closer. He loved how primal it felt. Clark felt his throat bulge slightly while it slid down a little further. They made out for a few minutes, stopping every so often to let Clark catch his breath, eventually he tilted his head back a little more, and put his hand on Zanoll's shoulder, then let it fall down to his pec and gave it a light squeeze.    

Zanoll let out another grunt and relaxed a little while Clark's hands roamed all over his body. He took a moment to bury his face in his chest, while he fondled his abs, played with the goat's muscular back, and brought his hands back up to his pecs and started teasing his nipples. He heard the monster grunt, start moaning, and felt even more warm precum stain his shirt. Clark leaned back a little, looked up at  Zanoll, and said "Looks like you're still not satisfied".

Then he sat up partially and started sucking on one of the demon's nipples while fondling him. He enjoyed how warm and heavy Zanoll's balls felt in his hand while the demon above him started whimpering and panting even louder. His eyes were half shut, and his long tongue hung out of his mouth, tempting Clark. Clark's hand and wrist were drenched in precum by the time he stopped, and it made him wonder what else the demon liked. He reached around and squeezed the demon's fat ass, and heard him let out another moan in response.

Without saying a word, Zandoll took off his loincloth, got on his knees, shifted around, and bent over in front of Clark and angled his back, presenting himself. Clark took off his pants, looked down at the massive demon and gave his fat, muscular ass a nice slap. Zanoll arched his back higher in response, while his breathing got even more ragged. Precum was steadily leaking out of his fat, uncut dick and onto the ground below him. His short tail wiggled back and forward while Clark got closer. 

He brought his face closer and pressed his nose into the demon's sack for a few moments. That was all it took to make Clark want more.  The light musk was pleasant and intense, he got more and more of it when started planting kisses on the demon's balls. The taste was somehow even better. 

Zanoll let out a frustrated moan while he continued to leak precum onto the ground. He was certainly enjoying this human worshipping him, but he was starting to get impatient. His frustration quickly faded when he felt Clark spread his toned, muscular ass apart with both his hands. The demon's tailhole was slightly pink and very tight. Watching Zanoll lightly shake his ass in anticipation was all it took for Clark to start rimming him. Zanoll continued panting and grunting while Clark slowly continued. 

He gave the demon's tight asshole a few kisses, then went down his taint and back to his balls. He couldn't even fit half of one in his mouth, but he still sucked on them slowly, planting long, slow kisses  before he slid his tongue along the underside of the demon's hard dick and tasted some of his precum. Clark gave the demon's ass another slap before continuing to slowly lick and kiss his pink tailhole. Every so often, Clark felt Zanoll pushing back, forcing his tongue in deeper. By the time he was finished, Zanoll was shuddering on the ground below him. A small puddle of precum sat underneath both of them. 

Zanoll was getting too frustrated. The human almost made him cum just from foreplay, and now he was being denied what he wanted. He glared back at him and growled, "HURRY UP. AND FUCK ME. ALREADY".

Clark didn't have to be told twice, but he decided to keep teasing him anyway.

He lined himself up with the demon's ass and pressed just the tip of his dick in. He did this a few times until he felt Zanoll push back into him, forcing all the way inside. He felt the demon clamping down as he slid all the way inside, then pulled out with a wet pop. Clark pushed in again and started thrusting slowly, loving how tight and hot Zanoll's ass felt. He watched with amazement as Zanoll leaned forward slightly to give him a better angle as he continued fucking him. On a particularly deep thrust, he heard Zanoll scream, dig his claws in the ground him clamp down even harder. Clark started fucking him faster, only for Zanoll to start muttering "MORE. DON'T. STOP." every couple of thrusts. 

Zanoll was completely lost in the moment while Clark pounded away at his fat ass. He was angled just right to hit the goat demon's prostate and he was getting close. All that making out and foreplay from earlier was finally catching up to him. Humiliated and angered that a human almost made him cum so fast, he tried his best to hold back and only ended up speeding it up as he growled, bucked his hips back a few more times before he came hands free. He clenched down on Clark's dick even more while he shuddered on the ground below him, embarrassed at the idea of being forced to cum so hard. 

He shot out ten massive ropes of cum all over the ground below him. Some of it shot as far as a foot away from him while he bucked his hips uselessly. He let Clark keep pounding away at him until he also came, shooting his load as deep inside as he could. Clark weakly thrusted a few more times before pulling out, then collapsing on top of the exhausted goat demon. He laid there for a few moments before slapping Zanoll's ass again, then spoke up. "Well?" He paused to catch his breath and continued, "You satisfied?"

Zanoll grunted in response and gave a thumbs up before getting up and stumbling towards the woods. His legs were a little shaky, but he managed to get there, looked back at Clark, grinned, and disappeared.

Clark stood there for a while before getting dressed and grabbed the rest of his beer. "Best. Halloween. Ever." he mumbled to himself while he strolled home.
