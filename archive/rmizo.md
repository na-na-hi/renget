2nd Exclusion team
Captain Anon

**Being the captain of an exclusion team is certainly not an easy task. Having to manage each member and work in unison to be efficient takes a toll on you. But that's just how it is. It's been a year and a half since joining the National Security Forces (NSF) after having been discharged from the military. Most of the time I've been here has been training and providing protection for several high-class members. But that task has changed. About five and a half months ago, a message was given from the higher-ups informing several members of the force about certain "exclusion teams" being formed to investigate The Exclusion Zone that was formed around the Chernobyl Nuclear Powerplant months after the devastating disaster had occurred. Not much is known about The Zone since barely anyone has dared to enter. And there are no official records of people who are said to still live there ever escaping. I was told that due to my high work ethic and leadership skills, I was going to be one of the soldiers given the role of captain for an exclusion team. I met my team shortly after the position was given. The team was a mismatch of humans and anthros from different walks of life. Some were ex-military/government personnel while others were from other private military companies. I didn't think much of it but there was one member that bugged me. A tall Female wolf woman named Ana (short for Anastasia/Анастасия). I was told that she would be my second in command of the group as she had about as much experience as me. She was eager to be part of the team and happily introduced herself when given the position. We trained several months after that and became close as a team working effectively and efficiently. Although small altercations still came up. Nothing too drastic. When training was done, our task was given. We were to retrieve information about a missing team that had gone in before us and collect any vital information about the zone. As for the difficulty of this mission, no one said this was going to be easy, but here we are.**

##Chapter 1
**2 hours before Deployment**
>The smell of cigarettes fills the room
>Everyone on the team has taken a laid-back stance after the briefing
>The investigator was packing the documents to leave so no one thinks much of it
>As you were writing down something in the journal you brought along, you catch Wick looking at you from the corner of your eye
>"Hey captain, what are you doing with the journal?" Said Wick smoking his daily cigarette
>"Just starting a log book to record our expedition. Just in case anything is to happen while in the zone." You retort
>"Seriously? You writing a log book isn't going to help us in the middle of a firefight." 
>"As I said, it's just to document our findings. Nothing special."
>Closing the journal, looking at him "Besides, the journal isn't going to hurt you."
>"The captain makes a good point Wick." Victor responds "Documenting the expedition will provide the researchers with a better understanding of what is going on."
>"Alright then." Wick concedes while putting out the cigarette
>"Anyways. What do you guys think of the mission?"
>"It certainly something new and different compared to the previous assignments I've been given." Dominic reply's  
>"Certainly beats taking care of oil tankers while in the heat of the middle east."
>"I've heard rumors from the higher up's that the team before us had seen some wild shit before losing communication." Ana replied
>"I guess we have to see for ourselves." Wick coldly responds
>The conversation is cut short when Colonel Roy enters the room
>All of you proceed to stand to properly salute him
>"At ease." He says calmly "I come to inform you that due to an unexpected weather event and your deployment will be sooner than expected."
>"Ah shit." You say
>"Ah shit indeed. Your deployment time has been pushed up to thirty minutes." Colonel Roy affirms "Your gear is ready in the armory. I would suggest taking what time is left and contacting any friends and family members you might have before deployment. Good luck." He says before he leaves the room.
>"Well I guess time is ticking. You heard the man. Let's go"
>After leaving the room, all of you head to the armory to gear up. Not much is said during this time, but everyone takes the time to call their loved ones individually. So do you, well at least what is left of the family.
>Once finished, the entire team heads to the airstrip to board the transport helicopter. Although, you end up getting pulled to the side before getting there.
>"Captain Anon, I need to speak with you for a moment." Colonel Roy announces "I need you to know this before you go. The team can not mess up the mission. Even though we have other teams on standby, don't get your ass and your team's ass killed. Understand?"
>"Don't worry Colonel. We will do our best to perform to the utmost extent. Besides, isn't this the reason why we trained for?" You reply
>He gives you a mildly unamused look but sighs.
>You go back to your team and board the helicopter. 
>After a few minutes, the pilot was given the green light to lift off.
>The flight is about an hour long, but the time is spent resting or playing cards.
>Soon enough the drop-off area was nearby
>It's a considerably-sized patch of grass with heavily wooded forestation surrounding it. All you can see is trees for miles.
>"This is as close I'm allowed to leave you, Captain. Without risking the safety of everyone on board" The pilots say
>"This should be good enough." You reply
>You open the side door as the pilot starts to lower the helicopter. The height is just enough for you and your team to get out of the helicopter
>Once everyone was off, you give him the green light to leave
>"Bravo team to Headquarters. We have successfully arrived at the drop point."
>"Affirmative Captain. Remember what I told you" The colonel responds through the radio
>You pull out a small map and compass from a small pouch on your plate carrier. There's not much detail on the map but it will have to work for now.
>"The edge of The Zone appears about 3 miles North East from here." 
>"Everyone knows what they're doing?" You ask
>Your team members collectively nod in unison
>"Good. Because it's too late to turn back"
