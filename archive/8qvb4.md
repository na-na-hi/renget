`ENTER: FAITH KANG, exiting a lift. She scuffs her sneakers on the floor as she paces back and forth, hands shoved into the front of her hoodie, before reaching out and ringing a doorbell. As she withdraws her hand, visibly torn between standing her ground and making a run for it, the door opens, revealing MR CAIN.`

`MR CAIN: Oh, Faith. Good morning.`
`FAITH: Um, good morning, Mr Cain. Is Chris in?`
`MR CAIN, turning: CHRIS! YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S HERE!`

`The sound of footsteps. A silhouette over MR CAIN's shoulder resolves into CHRISTOPHER CAIN, red-faced, nudging the older man aside.`

`CHRIS: Jeez, Dad, keep it down.`

`MR CAIN raises his hands in mock-surrender and retreats indoors. His voice drifts back to them.`

`MR CAIN: I'll leave you kids to it.`

`Slipping his shoes on, CHRIS steps out into the corridor and shuts the door behind him. FAITH is silent. Her hair has been tied into a loose bun. He thinks she looks beautiful.`

`FAITH: So.`
`CHRIS: So.`

`She folds her arms.`

`FAITH: You've been avoiding me. Does it have anything to do with Hailey's party?`
`CHRIS: What? No.`
`FAITH: OK, well, I'm pregnant, so if it's not you, then I don't know what I'm going to do.`

`Her voice cracks for a moment. CHRIS stiffens as several disparate threads suddenly come together in his head all at once.`

`CHRIS: You're pregnant.`
`FAITH: Yeah.`
`CHRIS: Shit.`
`FAITH: Yeah.`
`CHRIS: OK. It's probably, uh.`
`FAITH: Yours?`

`CHRIS nods jerkily. He has not made eye-contact with her once throughout the entirety of this conversation.`

`FAITH: Great. At least one of us remembers their first time.`
`CHRIS: My judgment was - impaired.`
`FAITH: So was mine. Do you want me to -`
`CHRIS: Well, it's your body.`
`FAITH: But it's partially your fault.`
`CHRIS: OK. Well, we're not poor, so.`
`FAITH: It's manageable.`

`She shrugs, faux-nonchalant, then crumples. CHRIS catches her.`

`CHRIS: There's still time for either of us to change our minds.`
`FAITH, wetly: Yeah. Yeah. OK. Whatever.`

`CUT TO: EDITH LEE, exiting another lift. She crosses to the windows and stares out over Kyoto before extending one long arm to knock smartly on the door. A few minutes later, HAILEY CHANG answers the door. In lieu of pants, she is wearing a massively oversized T-shirt. A half-empty tub of ice cream is floating in the air behind her.`

`EDIE: Sup.`
`HAILEY: Sup. Where's Faith?`
`EDIE: Off with Cain.`
`HAILEY: About time.`
`EDIE: Yeah.`
`HAILEY: You going to apologize?`
`EDIE: Not really. Just came to drop off a package.`

`A small box pops out from nowhere, then hangs suspended in the air, caught by HAILEY's telekinesis. The girl in question squints at it, then at EDIE.`

`HAILEY: The fuck?`

`EDIE shrugs.`

`EDIE: Well, you've got to admit that it would make a lot of sense.`
`HAILEY: Are you calling me fat?`

`EDIE shrugs. HAILEY's face does look a bit rounder, now that she thinks about it.`

`HAILEY: Oh my god. You're calling me fat. Not all of us can be as hot as you, Edie. Jesus.`
`EDIE: No, you idiot. I'm talking about that party you threw here two months back. Faith's positive, you know.`
`HAILEY: What?`
`EDIE: Yeah. She's telling Cain.`
`HAILEY: Fuck.`
`EDIE: So, how many kids does Takeda want?`
`HAILEY: Shit. Shit. Shit.`

`Her face has gone white.`

`EDIE: It's probably nothing to worry about. Just to be sure, though -`

`She plucks the box out of the air and waves it in HAILEY's general direction. HAILEY snatches it out of her hand.`

`HAILEY: You can come in, I guess.`

`She disappears down a corridor as EDIE kicks off her shoes and makes herself at home. Switching the TV on, she cycles through the channels until a sound from behind makes her sit up, turning halfway to peer over the back of the couch.`

`HAILEY: You got more of those test kits?`

`She's thrown on a pair of trackpants. Her voice is very, very soft and very, very dangerous. In response, EDIE produces a couple of additional boxes from thin air with a flourish.`

`EDIE: Going to try again in the hope that you get a different result?`
`HAILEY: No, actually. I'm going to drag Max and Minnie down with me.`

`CUT TO: MAXINE NGUYEN, one hand kneading her face as she shuts her eyes. Her other hand is holding what appears to be a thermometer. She is sitting on the toilet. Someone knocks on the door.`

`MINERVA KIM, muffled: You OK?`

`MAX doesn't respond. After a few minutes, MINNIE leaves. Another interminable amount of time later, MAX stands up, dumps the device in the dustbin - taking care to bury it beneath a layer of unused toilet paper - and washes her hands. Her reflection looks puffy.`

`MAX, quietly: Shit.`

`She exits the bathroom and plops down beside MINNIE. The other girl is grazing unselfconsciously on a jumbo-sized pack of crisps. It's "cheat day". It's been "cheat day" for the past two weeks. MAX does not have a good feeling about this. She turns, opening her mouth, but is cut off by the sound of the doorbell.`

`MINNIE: Who's that?`
`MAX: I don't know.`

`MAX clambers over the back of the couch and skitters to the door. She stands on tiptoes to look through the peephole and descends, looking disgusted.`

`MAX: No one.`

`The doorbell rings again. MINNIE stands up and heads over to the door. She looks through the peephole, then at MAX, one eyebrow raised. MAX raises her chin. MINNIE opens the door.`

`HAILEY: OK, first off, I'm not apologizing.`

`MAX snorts loudly, then blinks at the sight of EDIE at HAILEY's elbow.`

`MINNIE, surprised: Where's Faith?`
`EDIE: With Cain.`
`MAX: No one uses the groupchat anymore.`
`HAILEY: Gee, I wonder whose fault that is.`

`She brandishes a pair of boxes.`

`HAILEY, with forced cheer: Anyway, that's not what I'm here for. I'm here to get you to do this. I'm not leaving until you do.`
`MINNIE: Oh, great. A sleepover.`
`MAX: Already did.`
`MINNIE: Already - wait.`

`She takes one package from HAILEY and scans it.`

`MINNIE: Hailey, what is this?`
`HAILEY: Are you illiterate?`
`MINNIE: You're being ridiculous.`
`HAILEY: We had to force you and Samson to get a room before Abrams got scarred for life.`

`MAX snickers.`

`EDIE: So, are you positive?`
`MAX: Unfortunately.`
`EDIE: Takagi?`
`MAX: No comment.`
`EDIE: I rest my case.`
`MAX: Fuck off.`
`MINNIE: Language.`

`MINNIE looks up.`

`MINNIE: Wait. Is Faith -`
`HAILEY: Yeah.`
`EDIE, cheerfully: All this could've been avoided if you'd come to Paris with me.`
`MAX: Or if you'd hung around to cockblock.`
`EDIE: I'd have passed out after five shots. Haven't we tested this?`
`MAX: You could just, like, not drink.`

`EDIE's phone chimes. She looks down at it.`

`EDIE: Faith's coming.`
`MINNIE: Why couldn't she message in the groupchat?`
`EDIE: You know why.`

`MINNIE sighs and hefts the package in her palm.`

`MINNIE: I'm going to the bathroom. Max, let them in.`
`MAX: You're not the boss of me.`

`She does, however, take a few steps back. HAILEY and EDIE enter after her. EDIE clocks MINNIE's half-empty pack of crisps and rolls her eyes. HAILEY levitates a handful into her open mouth and chews noisily. MAX rubs her temples.`

`HAILEY: I think we could skip graduation.`
`MAX: Please.`
`EDIE: You could just have your gowns let out or something.`
`HAILEY: I'm not wearing a tent onstage. Are you keeping it?`
`MAX: I dunno. It's still early, isn't it?`
`HAILEY: For now.`
`EDIE: Hailey displaying long-term thinking? Never thought I'd see the day.`
`HAILEY: I'm going to kill you.`

`MINNIE shuffles out and collapses on the couch.`

`MINNIE: No one's killing anyone. Max, stop wasting toilet paper.`
`MAX: Got the panic attack out of your system yet?`
`MINNIE: I didn't have a panic attack. I guess I'm just built different.`
`HAILEY: As if. More like you've been fantasizing about having Samson's babies since freshman year.`
`MINNIE: OK, well, first off -`
`MAX: She's seriously trying to defend herself.`

`EDIE stands up and goes to the door. She returns with FAITH. The five of them congregate on the couch.`

`FAITH: So I guess we're going to start using the groupchat again?`
`HAILEY: Yeah.`
`MINNIE: Yeah.`
`MAX: Yeah.`
`EDIE: Yeah.`
