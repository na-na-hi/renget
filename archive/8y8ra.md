#Dollmaker's Paradise

!!! info [Scene: A neatly organized room in which a lone girl toils away at her desk. Despite being quite spacious, the number of figurines, dolls, and materials for their creation make the room feel a little cramped. While many of these have been bought and depict popular characters, a startling amount are handcrafted and modeled after people the girl knows.]

"A-Ah, you look so pretty~"

Hinako carefully finishes doing Yoru's hair. Not the flesh and blood Yoru — she wouldn't reuse if asked, of course — but the one that was carved and painted and had fabric for hair. The purple locks were tied up in her friend's usual style, but the bands were different along with the rest of the outfit. It was... *interesting* to say the least and it was maybe too easy to imagine the real thing wearing. As Hinako gives the doll a look over, her cheeks turn red at some of the details.

"Everything looks good... Now, we just need to get you packaged! B-But first..."

It would be too much of an exaggeration to call what the white-haired girl had a business. Most of her creations would never leave her room, posed on their shelves to be enjoyed solely by her. But, Yoru was technically a customer and this was one for the few that would leave. Even as another Yoru stares at Hinako from its place on her desk, she finds herself reluctant to package it away. Instead, her eye starts shining with power as she sucks in a breath through her teeth. Any price was worth paying for even a short goodbye.

At first, nothing happens. Then, the doll's limbs start to fidget until it pops off of its stand. It does a small spin as it checks itself out before looking at Hinako with a smile.

"You did such a good job on me~"

"Of course! You know I always treat you well..."

"You do~ You deserve a reward~"

The doll winks and its tiny finger curls to beckon its creator closer. Even knowing that this is playing out exactly as she wants, Hinako can't stop her cheeks from burning as she leans in to receive a peck on the cheek from the recreation of Yoru.

"Y-You're too nice to me! Are you sure you don't want to stay?"

"Anyone would want to stay with you taking care of them, but then you'd miss out on getting praised by the real Yoru."

"O-Oh... You're right. She might even ask someone else to do this for her."

"Wouldn't that be terrible?"

"They wouldn't know how to treat her at all!"

"Exactly. So, give me to Yoru to make sure she doesn't get any silly ideas."

Doll Yoru gently strokes Hinako's hand to calm her down before falling lifeless again. The white-haired girl reattaches the doll to its stand and finds a comfortable, cushioned box to place it in. She also puts in a few accessories. Yoru hadn't asked for these, but Hinako couldn't stop herself when she thought of all the things she'd look nice in and what would be needed to take care of her. She wraps the box up and slips it into a bag that she slings over her shoulder.

A current runs through her, making her fingers fidget restlessly. As much as she hated to let her things go, the thought of getting praised by Yoru made her skip a beat.

"I'll be back soon. Be nice to each other everyone! Oh, and please try to make more friends Mari."

The power of her eye surges again as Hinako stands at the door to her room. A sea of smiles and waves sees her from the perfect world she created, even from her less friendly acquaintances. Maybe even more than she loathed the idea of giving them up, she hated the world outside wasn't more like her paradise. The people outside were so... stingy. Not like her dolls at all.
