###Recommended Streams
Not sure where to start? Here are a few suggestions:

Mariya:
[The 3D Showcase](https://youtu.be/bKV0ZOe7CoU)
A good chance to hear her sing and bounce off her gen-mates.
[The Possessive ASMR](https://youtu.be/klWij7A1XRw)
The vampire does a lot of ASMR and a lot of role play, this one should give you a good sense if you'll enjoy her style.
[Happy Hour Stream #1](https://youtu.be/0HQFVa16YH0)
Part of Mari's charm is how playful and dorky she can get, that really comes out in this stream.

Mono:
[Onsen Stream #1](https://youtu.be/YiuQWVD6O1A)
This stream in particular had Mono opening up in a way that a lot fans found endearing, some going so far as to oshi(hen).
[Welcome to MonoBurger](https://youtu.be/CsREQkdeg78)
Another one of Mono's charms is the work she puts into stream assets. This stream in particular has her manning the drive-thru, complete with drawn restaurant and uniform. Pull up to the window, and Mono will have your order ready for you... Probably.

Biscotti:
[The Confessional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQIf1fSxm0M)
Bisco has been described as FFE: Fujo Friend Experience. Regularly references Twitter memes (in this stream, the "multiplayer onahole") and generally has shit-poster energy.
[Valentine's Day Relay: Bisco's Section](https://youtu.be/2EK2D2YatmU)
In addition to the aforementioned shit-poster energy, she also is a solid singer! This karaoke is an excellent showcase of both in ~20 minutes.

Collabs:
[The Uno Collab](https://youtu.be/LSyjrUCA5FA)
The full Petalight collabs are always fun! This collab in particular (like many an Uno collab) is on the salty side. Try this one for a bit of playful banter.
[The Roblox Collab](https://youtu.be/E1qphYsanKI)
A bunch of hags get into a kid's game. This one is more on the silly side.
[First VR Collab](https://youtu.be/wI_LnBK13SA)
Whenever the girls get into VR, things get sensual.
