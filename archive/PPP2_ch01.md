#### Computers, People, and Programming
>*“Specialization is for insects.”*  —R. A. Heinlein

*"In this chapter, we present some of the things that we think make programming important, interesting, and fun. We also present a few fundamental ideas and ideals. We hope to debunk a couple of popular myths about programming and programmers. This is a chapter to skim for now and to return to later when you are struggling with some programming problem and wondering if it’s all worth it."*
