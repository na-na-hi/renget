Man´s Best Friend(s) by anonymous

Just an idea from the feline vs canine arguments. First time writing, I hope it meets the board’s expectations.

>Have two anthro friends
>One husky the other one a black cat
>you’ve had other friends but these two have been with you through everything.
>you met both of them during middle school.
>you genuinely have lots of fun with them and enjoy their presence.
>you consider them your two BEST friends
>flash forward to the end of high school.
>as you guys hang out more often, you notice them trying to get… closer.
>at first it started with them sitting closer to you on the couch or when you go out to eat. Then they started hugging you way more often with the husky sneaking in a sniff and the black cat lightly rubbing the top of his head on your neck. Next, they were practically cuddling you any second they could. Touching and smothering any body part they could get their squishy paws on.
>it felt a little weird at first, but you just summarized it up as “common anthro to anthro affection”. They were your best friends after all why wouldn’t they be showing affection?
>flash forward to you getting ready to move out
>you tell them that you’ll be moving to another state for college
>they look at at you with absolute shock and hurt
>the rest of the conversation is relatively quiet and a bit awkward
>you try to relieve them by saying you’ll keep in touch and will visit them whenever you can but all you get in response are empty “yeah’s”
>it pains you, knowing you’ll have to leave your buddies behind
>as the conversation comes to an end, you head towards the exit, but before you leave a black paw pulls on your arm
>”wait! T-take us with you!”
>huh?
>”please!” The husky pleaded “uh, I mean, we can find an apartment together, right?”
>you could always use extra help for rent and hey! You’ll be able to stick with your two favorite people in the world! But, what about them? They’ll be dropping everything just to live with you? Are they thinking this through?
>”Oh come on anon, you know how rich my family is. My amount of AP classes should cover college admission too!” Said your feline friend.
>”I am the best in my soccer team, so college shouldn’t be too much of a problem.” Said your canine comrade
> wow, they really were ready to drop everything… kinda scary in a worrying way
>nonetheless, you were elated to hear that you wouldn’t be alone, and even better, you would spend it with your two loyal friends!
>after a joyous group hug, and a lot more planning, job hunting, and essay writing, you decide to spend the night over at the black cats home.
>You’re all tired from the excitement, but before anyone goes to bed you decide to return some of that affection by petting them since they did such a good job planning.
>you catch the cat heading to the bathroom getting himself ready for bed.
>”oh, hey anon did you need something?”
>”I just wanted to say thank you for deciding to move in with me” you say
>”aww, it’s really not that-“
>before he can make a humble retort you reach your hand over his head and start to smoothen his head fur.
>although his fur covered his blush you could see his ears pricking up and turning red.
>How cute!
>you were beginning to realize why anthros were so physically affectionate. His black, silky fur was so addictive that eventually you began to use both hands to caress his face, scratching behind his ears and under his chin.
>he was purring loudly with closed eyes while he pushed his skull into your hands. His tail swinging slowly left and right.
>”what a nice kitty you are~” you say causing the black cat to shiver a little.
>you let go a few seconds later. His purring continuing, head still in petting position, and eyes closed.
>he slowly opens his eyes before springing up and looking away.
>”t-thanks a-anon, uh I, um have to go brush my teeth now!”
>the agile cat slips away down the hall and into his room
>but wait, you were just standing next to the bathroom?
>You move on, trying to find the husky.
>You find him lying face down on the living room couch with his arm dangling on the side. He isn’t wearing a shirt and only has on shorts.
>time to give him some tender loving… errr petting. Yeah, petting.
>as you approach the couch, his eyes meet yours and his tail wags a bit.
>”Hey anon, what are you up to this late at night?”
>You plop yourself down next to his feet.
>”ehhh not tired yet, besides I still need to thank you. How about a massage to show my appreciation? I know you need one since you play soccer a lot.
>he sits up a little ”uhh, s-sure! I mean you don’t have to-“
>you roll your eyes and smile. You push him back down on his stomach.
>it’s not the first time you’ve seen your husky buddy shirtless. He isn’t a overly muscular stud, but you do know that he’s pretty fit thanks to his soccer team, but Damn! Looking at his back this close and seeing every definition of his body is kinda making you salivate… and feel a bit jealous.
>”I don’t think I’ve ever told you this but, nice bod dude”
>”h-hehe thanks- Ahhh~”
>you push into his shoulders letting your fingers slide through his soft fur.
>although your main goal was to relive some tension in his back, you were now way too entranced to just feeling him out like you would with an actual dog.
>you imitate a friendly “good boy” like you would say to a regular dog.
>this gets him to tense up and cover his snout and eyes with his paws.
>hmmm maybe you shouldn’t talk to a canine anthro like a dog, he didn’t seem to like it.
>With his previously tense shoulders now relaxed, you move downwards to his lumbars where you can see his tail wagging furiously.
>was this massage really that good? You were mostly just petting him to be honest.
>soon, you finish up and ask if he’s gonna stretch and go to bed now.
>”u-uh, why don’t you go ahead. I-I think I’m gonna just gonna chill here and finish this episode!” He tells you breathing slightly heavily and stomach still facing down on the couch.
>The next morning, you hear voices outside the guest room door.
>”oh yeah, well, I was called a ‘nice kitty’, did he even call you anything?”
>”Yeah. He. Did! He called me a ‘good boy’ and he even gave me a back massage.”
>”pshhh as if a back massage could amount to head pats.”
>”h-he gave you head pats?”
>DUNK!
>they burst through your door, each of them holding a plate of eggs, bacon, and buttered toast.
>the black cat springs up to you first. “good morning anon! I made you your favorite~.”
>”hah, you clearly don’t know anon at all. Anon likes his eggs scrambled and with ketchup, not sunny side up. Here, you can take my plate instead” the husky says pushing the black cat back, almost causing him drop his own plate.
>”no, he likes them sunny side up!”
>they’re both butting heads at this point trying to flip each others plates. Weird… For as long as you’ve been friends, you’ve never seen them argue before. Especially not about your preference on eggs.
>”guys! I like my eggs either way”
>they stare at you, then back at each other giving a quick “hmph”, then they hand both their plates to you, to which you take (one in each hand so as to not spark another argument on who’s plate was taken first) and eat while they watch.
>why are they watching?
>A few weeks pass and these little arguments about you keep popping up. Things like “who knows anon better”, “who gets to hangout with anon”, and even the smallest of things like “who gets to sit up front with anon”.
>sometimes you can hear them argue who’d be the better boyfriend for you.
>the arguments are starting to get so annoying that you’re rethinking about your plans of going to college with them.
>one day, you find yourself in the middle of an argument between the two. It had somehow escalated to sex.
>”I bet you just can’t wait to get him on all fours just so you can stick your dumb doggy dick in him and call him your own personal cock sleeve!”
>”oh whatever, it’s not like your prickly dick will make him cum. Your more likely to hurt him with it than give him an ounce of pleasure!”
>”I bet you can’t make anon cum!”
>”well I’m about to prove you wrong!”
>before you can get a say in the argument, a husky hand appears on your chest and pushes you back down on the couch. He places his knee between your legs and, with his free hand, brings your face to his for a kiss.
>what the hell is going on!?!?! Your two best friends who were just arguing about who would have better sex with you and now it evolved into one of them literally making out with you!
>the kiss, at first, was messy, but once his tongue invaded your mouth it began to feel a lot more smooth. His tongue was the first to explore your mouth. It was almost feral like he had been wanting to do this for a long time.
>after a while, he let go to allow you to breathe. A string of saliva connecting your lips. The husky licked his and held a grin. He looked to the cat and said, “ha! Got to kiss him first!” Then he wiggled his knee to your groin. “I even got him hard! What are you gonna do about that!”
>the cat quickly rushed over to push the dog out of the way. “Thanks for making this easier”
>the black cat got into a kneeling position between your legs and began to unzip your pants. He was pulling down your boxers like he was opening a treasure chest. When he finally revealed your hard on his eyes lit up and he put on a devilish smile.
>he began to fondle your balls with one hand and give your shaft a squeeze with the other.
>god he was good. He would squeeze as he pulled down on your length, and when beads of pre popped up he would give your tip a lick.
>he began to jerk faster, adding a light squeeze to your balls trying to milk you.
>you sat there holding a hand to your chest as each pump got you closer and closer and-
>he stopped stroking
>you looked down to see the smug grin on the black cat’s face. He was edging you!>He kept getting you to your peak and holding his hands still till you calmed down.
>till suddenly the husky pulled the cat away.
>”my turn”
>the husky pulled on you legs causing you to shift forward and place your back on the seat cushion.
>he lifted your thighs over his shoulders and eagerly began digging his snout into your balls and inner thighs taking deep inhalations of your scent.
>the next thing you know he starts lapping at your balls, then he starts moving up.
>Thank god for the mini respite you were given when the husky was busy pulling the cat off of you.
>Once he reached the end of your cock, he, without warning, completely engulfed your dick till his nose reached your stomach.
>Looks like that respite wasn’t enough because now you were fully unloading several shots into his maw while letting out a moan.
>the husky had a look of surprise at first but quickly started to suckle on your shaft drinking all of your cum.
>once your orgasm had calmed down, he slowly slid his mouth up from your dick and stuck his slightly painted tongue at the cat who was now fuming, probably at the fact that the husky made you cum.
>the black cat took your wrist and dragged you to his room leaving your pants behind.
>he locked the door, grabbed a small bottle of lube from his nightstand, and aggressively pushed you onto his bed.
>”can’t believe he just took all the credit for my work, tsk typical canine. I’ll show him” he said as he straddled his legs around your hips while taking off your shirt.
>you could see a sizable tent in his pants and decided to help him unbutton and unzip.
>he shook off his pants and let your hands roam his soft, silky, furred thighs and chest while he did the same.
>you rubbing him seemed to have the same effect as before when you were petting his head. His purring grew louder as you continued and when you grazed over his nipples it seemed like an electrical shock would go through him.
>picked up the bottle of lube beside him and poured some on the hands. You reached under his tail and started prodding his hole. He jolted a little, but relaxed as you eased a finger in. One finger became two till you eventually found his prostate. His legs quivered a bit and he tried to cover a yelp.
>the cat seemed to have decided that the teasing was enough and took the lube bottle and poured the cold goo onto your newly hardened cock.
>he aligned your dick to his hole and slowly drifted town onto in.
>you could feel your length breaking his incredibly warm, tight inner walls as he very slowly moved down to the hilt.
>”finally” he sighed out, his cock leaking pre.
>then he started the up and down movements. The cat was still purring and releasing tiny moans of pleasure each time he dropped down. Eventually you started bucking your hips in time with his downward motions causing him to once again jolt as he felt you reach further inside.
>the pace got faster and at some point it just came to you thrusting into his prostate while he was hunched over you. Your eyes met and you two fell into a deep kiss, entangling your tongues trying to see who could reach further.
>the next thing you know is the feeling of hot cum splatting onto your stomach and the cat moaning out loud.
>his warm walls squeezing your shaft trying to stimulate your orgasm.
>you put in a few more pumps before your shooting several shots inside him.
>by the end your both panting and laying on top of one another.
>you couldn’t help but here whining and panting on the other side of the door though, and when you opened it you saw the husky jerking himself off and fingering himself.
>oh boy
>you had hoped that the arguments would’ve ended after this event but at least now they ended with more sex. You just hope there isn’t so many.
