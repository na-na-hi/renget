"Oh shit. Oh fuck. Goddamnit."


And many other such thoughts appeared in your head as you scolded yourself mentally, nearly drowning yourself in beer as a huge, eight foot monster approached you, his every step causing both the ground, and you, to tremble. 


Before you knew it, you had finished your beer, and had no choice but to pay attention to the monster now sitting in the seat just next to you, staring at you with a smirk as he propped his head on his elbow. 


"Hey." He spoke, his voice was as deep as you had imagined, maybe even more so. 


"H-Hey." You replied, cringing at the studder in your voice. 


His smirk just grew wider. 


"So, let me just get right to the point here. I saw you glancing at me from across the bar. You wanna fill me in on why?" 


"Uhh…." Shit. 


You looked into the deepest parts of your brain for a viable excuse. Maybe you could just pin it on his unique looks? 


I mean, the guy was one of the biggest dudes in the bar, his tail was so long it dragged on the floor, (with a giant club like ball on the end of it.) And, his horns, and parts of his shiny black scales, were literally glowing. I mean, it was hard NOT to notice him. 


Yeah, he just looked weird. It totally wasn't because you were having every dirty thought on the planet right now and he was somehow involved in all of them. Yeah. 


"You just, look… Neat?" 


Jesus Christ, seriously? 


He let a small laugh, and the rumble from it literally made your knees weak. 


"Heh, you're cute." He said, leaning in closer, his glowing red eyes now practically burning right against your own. 


"But you know what? I think I know the real reason." He backed up a bit, stroking his hand in the air and motioning towards all the various women in the bar.


"There's all these girls in the bar, and yet, your eyes land on me. More than once in fact, don't think I didn't notice the other glances." 


You gulped. 


"Yeah, you got a type, bud. And it looks like I tick all the boxes. But hey, it's okay. I got a type too, you wanna know what it is?" 


It didn't look like he cared about your answer, seeing as he leaned in as soon as he asked the question. He moves his mouth right up to your ear and whispered in his deep, rumbling tone. 


"I like humans." He said, leaning back, but pulling himself right back in as he said something else. "Male humans, specifically." 


He went back to his original pose of resting his head against his arm, only this time he looked a bit more… Suggestive? You couldn't really put your finger on it, you were too shocked by what you had just heard, and your mind felt like it was melting from his attention. 


"So." He began, sneaking his warm, scaled hand and intertwining it with your own. "Why don't I take you back to my place, have some fun, then you take me out on a date the next day. Sound good?"


 "Fuck yes." You blurted out, surprising even myself with how fast you responded. 


He just laughed again, a bit louder this time. "Well okay then. Let's go, cutie."


And with that, you two were off. His arm slung around your shoulder protectively as you did. 


"Oh, and by the way." He began, once again leaning into your ear and telling you words that made your dick nearly burst from confines. 


"When my tail is over your shoulder, and your pounding away, don't be shy to grab one of my horns. I tend to like that."
