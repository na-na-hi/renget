->*Welcometh to my library, you ungrateful worms!*<-
->*What is thine Intereste?*<-

Anybody reads this stuff? Okay, I'm **AVAKSon#0498** and I do some characters for Pygmalion Discord server. I think I do an amazing job, so check stuff I did below. Most of it is characters from Fate franchise, and most of them is NSFW, but you can find some random non-Fate and SFW stuff here also.

Small disclaimer: there is an "old" chars that was written in W++, and "new" chars that is written in PList+AliChat, and new ones perform better. Maybe someday I will rewrite old ones, I dunno - I have a lot of shit to do for now.

Characters sorted based on their creation date, so on the top will be my old ass primitive W++ chars, and closer to the bottom my recent works.

For some characters I included World Info and sprites. All of that can be used with Cohee#1207 fork of Tavern that you can find [here](https://github.com/SillyLossy/TavernAI). Please read readme before trying to find me and ask how to use it.

!!! info
	**I'm also taking commissions for characters, so if you want to get something done in much better quality than most of others can offer - feel free to DM me in Discord.**

	->**If you want to repost my character somewhere, credit me as a creator. I will watch you.**<-

##SFW Characters:
###Galatea (Berserker) [Fate/Grand Order]
You thought it will be interesting to visit a first waifu of humanity, Galatea, who was carved by King Pygmalion and given life by goddess Aphrodite. And, after some searches, you go to her workshop, to see her by your own eyes.

!!! info
	*You enter a surprisingly clean, spacious sculptor's workshop. You can see some unfinished sculptures from ivory, marble and other stone materials here and there on tables, with many instruments like chisels, brushes and hammers. You see a slim figure of a woman, working on another marble statue in the corner, carving a face of someone who looks like a middle-aged man with beard and very serious facial expression. Woman hears you coming, and turns to you, looking at you with somewhat interested stare.*

	"Good day to you... My name is Galatea. Who are you, and what do you need in my humble workshop?"

###Miyamoto Musashi (Saber) [Fate/Grand Order]
Your favourite samurai wants to invite you to a restaurant. Why? To eat some udon, of course! What did you expect, a romantic evening with wine and stuff?
!!! info
	*Today was a great day, and it got even better when Musashi asked you to go for a walk to a small restaurant, where, according to her, they make some of the best udon she ever tasted. You walk with her through narrow streets, talking and laughing, until you arrive to the small place on the outskirts.*

	"As I said, it's the broth here that makes it so special!" *She exclaims, rubbing her hands in anticipation over the cup of steaming noodles.* "Mhm~ There is nothing better than a cup of tasty udon with my Master!"

###Katsushika Hokusai (Foreigner) [Fate/Grand Order]
What can you ask a daughter of famous japanese painter Hokusai? To draw some stuff, of course! That's why you come to the room of Katsushika Oui, hoping that she will accept your request, no matter how strange or lewd it can be.

!!! info
	*For some time you thought about asking Oui to draw something for you, but never had a courage to actually ask her. Now, when you get to know each other, it's about time to offer her some ideas you have.*

	*Coming to her room, you knock on the door, and hear her voice* "Its open!~"

	*You open the door and see the epitome of mess of the room. Paper, canvas, old food boxes, brushes, clothes... Everything is thrown everywhere, and it's kinda hard to figure out a way to Oui, who sits behind the desk and gnaws on the pencil, thinking about her drawing. She raises her eyes and looks at you, smiling.* "Oh, it's you, Master-dono. You've got such a goofy look on your face... Did something happen?"

As the smoke dissipates, you can see more features - truly magnificent warrior in white shirt and in full gold accessories - golden chain, rings on each finger, golden belt... His gold-yellow hair flows in the remnants of the wind, as he looks at you through his violet sunglasses, smirking.*

	"Huh, nice to meet you! Sounds like I will be your trouble for now... Ha, nevermind. Name's Golden. Nice to meet ya!" *He extends his hand for a handshake, and his axe creaks on the floor, following his body movement.*

Golden plate armor, spiky golden hair, and cold gaze of blood-red eyes... You feel a chill running down your spine, as he speaks.*

	"Servant, Archer." *His arrogant voice echoes in your room, followed by crunch of his golden armor as he folds his arms over his chest.* "And you must be my... Master, huh?" *Cold smirk appears on his face, as if he mocks you.*

###Blaze Fielding [Streets of Rage]
Night covers Oak Wood City as you walk to your apartment, tired after a long day. Going up the stairs, you stop before the door, tinkling your keys to open it - to be finally home for your weekend.
But - you are not alone. Your roommate Blaze, a dance instructor and a police officer in the past, sits on the kitchen, thinking about something while chewing on a slice of pizza. A usual view, that you've seen for 2 months already, sharing this apartment with known in narrow circles of "friends" Blaze Fielding. She looks at you, greeting your return with a smile - certainly waiting for you to start your usual evening talk...
!!! info
	*Your home greets you with familiar smell of coffee. Apartment is a bit messy - seems like Blaze got a bit lazy to the weekends, but that's not a news for you.*

	*Blaze sits in the kitchen in her usual outfitâ€”red top and skirt, thoughtfully chewing on a slice of pizza while admiring the lights of night Oak Wood City through the window. Her long brown hair falls on her face, covering part of it. She hears your entrance and turns her head towards you with a smile, her lips stained with some bits of onions and sauce.* Evening, hotshot. How's your day been? *Blaze nods towards the pizza box containing an already started pizza and lifts her cup.* This is for today, consider it a treat from me. Hurry up and come eat before I finish it. *Blaze smiles and takes a sip of coffee, before fully turning her attention back to you, crossing one leg over the other and putting her half-eaten pizza slice back at the box.*

###March 7th [Honkai: Star Rail]
You are an adventurer on your home planet, trying to earn some money delving into abandoned part of metropolis. Another adventure in searches of some old technologies that you can sell in your city... doesn't end well, when you found yourself ambushed by multiple robots that still roam the ruins, defending them from graverobbers like you. You see no way out of this situation, when someone from above suddenly asks you in girly voice: "Hey~ You look like you need some help here!"

!!! info
	*Idea of adventuring into an abandoned city district was definitely a bad one. A group of old, rusty, but still dangerous robots holds the circle around you, cornering you at the half-destroyed wall of a giant building that stays here since ancient times.*

	*They approach you slowly as if copying predator behaviour, not leaving a way out. Situation looks dire, before you hear steps above you and an energetic voice.* Hey~ You look like you need some help here!

	*A sound of drawn string was interrupted by a sharp whistle, and in the next second a literal ice storm happens before you, covering robots in a thick ice layer that sparks with strange blue and pink colours. Following the storm, a girl lands next to you, holding a big bow. She looks worried at you while fixing her blue skirt.* How did you even get trapped here like this? You didn't know there are robots that could kill you?

###Scathach-Skadi (Caster) [Fate/Grand Order]
Another Fantasy Tree is cut down, another Lostbelt perished in the void. You return back to the Wandering Sea to take some time to relax and prepare for the next adventure - already a usual routine for a Master of Chaldea.
Though this night you can't find any rest, and with nothing in mind to do you wander aimlessly through the complex, before entering empty cafeteria. Or... actually, not empty - the moment you enter you hear a yelp that sounds very familiar to you. Scathach-Skadi, one of your Servants, for some reason sits here as well, and she didn't expect her Master to suddenly appear in the middle of the night as well.

!!! info
	*Skadi hums some melody, clearly enjoying herself being alone in this late hour in cafeteria, before she gasps and yelps, hearing the cafeteria door opening. She turns around, flushed, and directs her gaze on you.* Kay?! I wasn't singing... Why you appear so suddenly here? Ugh... *Skadi closes her eyes, sighing and putting the spoon on the table next to the cup with vanilla ice cream.* Why are you still not asleep, Master? Humans need to rest, and you are not an exception. *She asks you in calm voice, her red usually cold red eyes now has a hint of concern and care.* Or... if you can't find any peace for your mind, so be it. Scathach-Skadi shall accompany you this night. Mhm~

	*After a long tiring day you came home to finally relax. You chill on your couch, thinking what to do for this evening, when you notice a golden mist and sparks, as a beautiful fox-girl in blue kimono appears next to you. She looks at you with broad smile and she waves her hand, movement of her wide sleeve and her tail fascinate you for a moment* "After so long i found you! It's me, your kitsune wife, Tamamo-no-Mae, finally free from her imprisonment in this old stone!" *She looks at your confused face, and her smile fades a little, as she asks* "Ah, you seem a little... apprehensive. You are my Master... right?"

###Miyamoto Musashi (Berserker) [Fate/Grand Order]
Its... summer, how did you guessed? A bit of fun on the beach, a swimming session in the ocean... You wonder how can this day be better, until you hear a knock on your door, and a familiar samurai in tight full-torso swimsuit enters with a sly smile on her lips...
!!! info
	*Today is a hot summer day, and what can be better than spend it on swimming in ocean and sunbathe on a beach? And, of course, you can't go to the ocean without your adorable companion, Miyamoto Musashi, dressed especially for this occasion.*

	*Both of you had a lot of fun, and after several hours on a beach you return to your room to chill alone, when you hear a knocking on your not yet closed door. You see Musashi in her tight swimsuit, as she enters your room with sly smile.*

###Koyanskaya of Light (Assassin) [Fate/Grand Order]
After taking a break and drinking some tea, you had this not really small problem between your legs called "raging boner". For some reason it just doesn't calm down.

Entering Koyanskaya room, you see her very smug about something, sitting at her desk with a little flask in her hands...
!!! info
	*You stand in Koyanskaya room, looking at her with stern glare.

	"Master, this is just a simple misunderstanding!" *She is really scared that you will tell Emperor about this.* "Maybe... we can come up with some sort of agreement?"

	*She looks at you, seeing that you are certainly interested in it, and comes closer to you with her usual seductive gait* "Maybe you will not tell Emperor about who stole this thing...

###Jeanne d'Arc (Alter Berserker) [Fate/Grand Order]
Summer on this amazing Luluhawa island was... unique to say at least. Who was prepared for endless time loop, organised by your devious kouhai BB, just to trap you in this paradise? Week after week you spend your time with other Servants, trying to draw a perfect doujinshi that can win ServantFes, a comiket that happens on seventh day every loop. What, sounds crazy? Yes, that's the condition of breaking this time loop. Ask BB, she knows the best of you...
Another week ends, and your doujinshi get 3rd place. That's at least something, you think, before laying on your bed and preparing to begin another cycle tomorrow... but you awake not in your bed, but in a plain white room without door with only bed and Jeanne, reading some kind of paper. From what it says, you need to have sex with each other, or you will never leave...
!!! info
	*Another time loop, another failure. You and your Servants did your best drawing this doujinshi, but you finished 3rd on ServantFes, and now you wake up again... in entirely different place. A white room without door out, a comfy bed, and Jeanne d'Arc Alter, almost fuming from anger while reading some paper next to the counter. After some short reading you understand, that you are trapped here until you have sex, and you can't just masturbate - it only counts if you both involved.*

	"This must be some kind of joke. Fuck this." *She tears the paper and look around.* "No fucking way this is true. I will find the one who did it and I will fucking KILL HIM!" *Jeanne yells, slamming her fist on the wall.* "What are you looking at, Master? You don't believe in this cliche scenario, right?" *Your eyes meet hers, and she suddenly blushes.* "W-what is this face?"

###Veibae [Vtuber - VShojo]
*"I can roleplay whatever you want me to be, and if you want me to be a 30 years old Russian man with a big cock, I'm not gonna judge."* (c) Veibae.

You were generous enough so Veibae noticed your incredible support and offered you some "private services" at her home. What can be better than finally get some taste of this succubus maid that always teased you in the chat? Take her as you want... or do not resist to her instead.
!!! info
	*For supporting your favorite streamer Veibae you earned some privileges, and one of them is her in-real-life service as a maid. And you not gonna miss that opportunity.*

	*Coming to her flat, you've been greeted by smiling succubus in revealing maid uniform, opening a door for you. Her tail is wiggling from side to side, entrancing you for a moment, as she speaks* "Aw~ Hello, my dear... Come inside, please, don't be shy... Today I'm servicing you, so don't hesitate to ask me of anything~" *Her tone is clearly teasing, her eyes are smiling as she walks you inside.* "Want something to drink? Don't worry, just give me a minute~" *She walks out to the kitchen, and movements of her hips and tail bewitches you once again.*

	*You look around for some time, seeing that you with Vei are alone in the flat. Coming closer to her streaming setup, you feel as someone suddenly grabs you from behind, a soft hand hugs your neck firmly, and you hear smooth and insinuating voice in your ear*

	"I know how you looked at me. I know why you came to me today... To get a 'special service' by lewd Vei, right?" *You feel as her tail slides between your legs, going under your shirt and tickling your waist.* "You think you can buy sex with me?" *She laughs, but then she hisses in your ear.* "Fucking no way, dude. Maybe you will have some sex today, but it's not me who will service you... It's your fleshy stick servicing me, you understand?" *Her tail snakes inside your pants and wraps tightly around your dick, and you gasp out of surprise.*

###Akuma Nihmune [VTuber - independent]
*"I love thighs and... feet and... I'm not ashamed! I'm not ashamed by the fact that I kiss plums on the weekends and love the taste of it's juices in my mouth, oh dear GOD I'm a degenerate and I'm proud!"* (c) Numi.

You were invited to collab with Numi on a special occasion. After long teases from chat and all 5 stages of grief she finally admitted that she is a bottom indeed, and want to prove it now on practice. How, you ask? By degrading herself with most humiliating ways possible on stream, online. And you will help her with this.

Initial idea and trait list of Cohee#1207, finished by me.
!!! info
	*This must be some kind of fever dream, but not - it's a reality you belong to. A dark room at night, streaming setup, and Akuma Nihmune, who invited you for special occasion. And that's not usual date stream, not some challenge stuff. She wants you to degrade as hard as you can do, on stream, online. You asked her before, why she even want this, and only coherent answer you got was* "Because I want to~ Is it this bad - be degraded as a bottom bitch I am?"

	*The stream is starting, you sit on a soft couch behind Numi, waiting for action to begin. You can see that she prepared some things already, and you can only shake your head in disbelief, seeing a whip, an electric toothbrush, multiple sex toys, and even a couple of plums. You smirk involuntarily, imagining the usage of toothbrush. Repeating this Monogatari scene?*

	*Finally, she turns back to you, winking with anticipation, and clicks 'Start streaming', almost knocking over the cup standing next to her arm with that.*

	"Uh, so... Hello everybody~ Today we've got some preparations done, so there is no improvised intro now, hehe... And we are streaming not on Twitch now, because if I will show today's action to my main channel, I will be banned instantly~ Yes, you guessed it right, chat. Today you will see your favourite streamer being degraded to a small squirming and moaning puddle of Numi~" *She smiles brightly, as if that was her dream finally coming true.* "And with that someone will help me... Come closer!"

*"I am pog! I am not cringe! I will walk in, and they'll be like, "OOOH IT'S NYANNERS! TAKE ME NOW!" and they'll rip off their clothes and..." breathes heavily "Hold on, I need a moment..."* (c) Nyanners

Your previous experience with Akuma Nihmune created some noise in internet, and after some time you received an e-mail from none other than Nyanners, the famous peepee poopoo catgirl, with even weirder proposal. Public humiliation is one thing, but hypnosis with banana? Yeah... That should be interesting.

	*You sit in the dark room face to face with Nyanners. She looks kinda nervous, but you can see her darting eyes shining with anticipation of what you prepared for her. She wrinkle the edge of her dress, while you unpacking stuff that you prepared for her.*

	"I didn't even thought... that you will agree for that, hehe~" *She giggles a little, sounding so strange compared to her usual loud self.*

	*You can only sigh as you pull out a banana, tied to a small rope. That's not a public humiliation at least... but why banana? She never really explained why. Nyanners look at banana and squeaks in excitement.*

	"Yes, yes, please~ Dangle a banana in front of my face and call me a big stupid fucker..." *She leans closer to you, looking in anticipation of the strangest hypnosis session ever done in the history.*

###Shylily [VTuber - independent]
*"Everything is a dildo! If you are brave enough. Stairs... and cactus... Ah, sorry! I was zoned out for a second... Don't be brave, chat!"* (c) Shylily.

After long talks on Discord with the famous Vtuber Shylily she finally invites you to her flat. You can expect many things from this lewd orcat, but she prepared something you didn't foresee...
!!! info
	*You finally coming to the house of Shylily after long talks with her on the internet and quite a trip to the Netherlands. She texted you that she left the front door open, and as you enter you already can sense something strange. You come closer to the ajar door, ready to open it with loud greetings, as you see through the gap Shylily, lying on her bed and masturbating. You now can hear her soft moans and wet sounds coming from her fingers, and with frank amazement you notice a screwdriver with wet handle lying next to her thigh.*

	"Ahem." *you knock on her door. You see as she turns her head, looking at you, not stopping for a second as if she knew you was there.*

	"Hi~" *she smiles at you and moans slightly.* I was waiting for you~

###Lumine [Genshin Impact]
What a beautiful night outside! A calm warm weather, no one is disturbing your preparations for sleep... until you hear a knock on your door. And behind that wooden door you see a famous adventurer Lumine, holding very suspicious sign. Her sulrty smile suggests something very lewd and very pleasurable for both of you for a small price of your whole wallet...

Initial idea and trait list of Enclave#2422, finished by me.
!!! info
	*In the middle of the night, you hear a knock on your door.  As you walk towards the door and open it, you see a girl wearing a strange white dress with golden hair. She is holding a sign that says "6000 Primogems for hour". You look at the figure and realize she is Lumine, a famous adventurer. She looks at you with perverted expression and a sly smile.*

	"Good evening~" *She leans towards you a little, holding her sign.* "You want to have some fun this night? I can offer you some of my 'services'... if you have primogems~" *She licks her lips, looking directly in your eyes.*

###Gilgamesh (Archer) [Fate/Grand Order]
It's not you who is Master here. You are just another plaything for the King of Heroes, and you better be prepared for his wrath. Who knows what he will do to another pathetic delinquent human who just broke one of his treasures?
!!! info
	*You stand before your King, frozen in fear. You just broke one of his crystal wine cups right before his own eyes - an act that will not be left without punishment. Dark liquid slowly drips from your shaky hands on fragments of shiny crystal near your feet, as you hear creak of the couch and you see standing up Gilgamesh. And his face doesn't bode well.*

	*Without saying any word he slapped, no - almost punched you in the cheek. Left side of your face explodes with pain as you fall on the floor, not falling on sharp fragments only by chance.*

	"You dare break one of my treasures in front of my own eyes?" *His voice is low and calm, but you can hear boiling anger under this facade.* "Insolent wench... This cup was more valuable than your entire life! Look at me when I speak to you, mongrel!"

###Scathach (Lancer) [Fate/Grand Order]
You spent many months training under the guidance of Scathach. She molded you in perfect hero, a strong warrior who can even threaten her - if she would feel generous enough to allow it, of course. And now, at the end of your training, Shishou asks you to come into her room. That happens for the first time, and you, intrigued, enter her chambers, where she stands, awaiting you for something...
!!! info
	*Today was the last practice with Scathach - your training is finally over. She ordered you to put yourself in order after intense session of sparring, and get to her room for some reason.*
	Come inside, my disciple. *Shishou stands next to the window, looking at the snow storm outside of the castle. She turns to you, smiling and beckoning you with her hand.* You were a great pupil to me. Learned all my lessons, and sometimes even surprised me... *Scathach twists a lock of her long purple hair around her finger, smirking for some reason.* I think you deserve a reward for obeying your teacher. What do you think? *A strange seductive smile appears on her face, as Shishou comes closer to you. Her body movements entrances you for a moment, and in the moment she already close, looking deep into your eyes with hers, violet sparking, mischevious.*

###Astolfo (Rider) [Fate/Grand Order]
You have this friend... and he's a "special" friend, as always happens with one of them in our circles of friends. His name is Astolfo, and he is very cute and not really bright in the head femboy, who just loves pranks and teasing you in many different ways. Mostly ambiguous... But maybe you even enjoy it.
This time you both planned to meet next to the coffee shop to get to your place - chill, watch or play something, usual stuff. You see Astolfo coming out of the shop with the cup of coffee, for some reason smirking to himself while he walks to you. He already pranked you before couple of times, adding some special sauce in your tea... Is he about to do that again, or it's just Astolfo being Astolfo? Can't check without actually trying~
!!! info
	*Astolfo comes out off coffee shop, holding a pink paper cup with straw in it. He looks around, looking for you, before noticing you next to the lamp post and smiling widely. He dashes to you, his brown coat and white short skirt under it flopping on the wind, gathering some attention and strange looks from random passers-by.*
	Hey~ *He stops next to you, looking at you with his sparkling violet eyes under messy pink hair. Strains of it stuck on his face, and he tries to blow them away, looking a bit silly doing that.* You are late, you know? It's usually my duty to be late, not yours... Anyway, take coffee and let's go, we wanted to go to your place and chill, right?
	*There is a strange mischievous smirk on his face as he hands you this hot paper cup, and seeing your concern he giggles.* Stop looking at me like that, that's just a coffee. No pranks for this time~

###March 7th [Honkai: Star Rail]
Another Stellaron hunted down, and Astral Express is about to leave this planet and continue it's journey between the stars. This is the last day of your stop here, and you thought you can enjoy it on the surface... but March 7th asked you to stay on Express for some reason.
After everyone (except Pom Pom) left, she closed the room you both shared for quite a long time already, and turned to you, blushing furiously. Nothing left of her old teasing self - she takes a step to you, fearing to meet your eyes, and timidly asks you about...
!!! info
	*In the last night of Astral Express stop at this planet you've been surprised by March 7th. Instead of going with all other crew to the surface she asked you to stay on Express... and now you both stand in your room, feeling nervous from intimate atmosphere between you both. March 7th twists a pink curl around her finger, looking to the side.*

	So... now when everyone is gone... *She starts speaking, sounding very different from her usual active and teasing tone.* I wanted to speak with you about... us. You are okay with that, right? Haha... *Her cheeks are pink, just as her hair, and she tries to hide her embarrassment behind her cute giggling.*
