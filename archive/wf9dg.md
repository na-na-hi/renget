->Chapter two: The Werewolf in Human Clothes<-

Through the high pine trees and the land glistening with morning dew, our Detective Anon, slowly regains consciousness. Like waking a from a bad sleep, his eyes are sore and tries hard to see where he is. This is the outskirts, Anon deduced as he recognized the large green hill that overshadows the city just straight ahead. He's far, but not too far and it's still morning. I'd better go now. But as soon as he gets up. Something doesn't feel right. Anon looked down and now he see's. He's half naked. Nothing down there at all, he's just has his coat and shirt. Then last night came to him in a flash. Everything.

Anon could feel his face burning and also.. something else. 

Wuh-oh! A boner.

Without a second thought, Anon took off his long coat and tied the sleeves 'round his waist. But there was slight problem. The coat would only hide one side and show the other. But wait! Anon took off the coat and then buttoned it. Voila! Now both sides were completely hidden. Ingenious. Anon couldn't help but feel smug. If only Nancie could've been here- oh fuck!
It hit him all at once. Again.
After last night they must have known I went missing, because he...!!
Anon quickly looked to see if he was around. He focused on every little thing he could see hoping that he's somewhere around here. Is he awake? Is he lying somewhere like I was? I would be after a night like that. But no, werewolves are known for their incredible stamina, even when they're human. But still, there must be a shit ton of stuff happening at the station and I don't have time to find him, not like he's not gonna fucking present himself. Even though... I want to find him. 

Anon closed his eyes and cleared his head, and began walking towards the city. Without a phone he can't call his buddies at the station and let them know where he is. And his badge was in his wallet so he can't prove who he is when it would be important. Just great. It's at least a few miles to the city and then a few more blocks to my house. I have to get to the house first, can't fucking go to the station with no pants or underwear, not again, Anon thought to himself loathingly. He wished he could forget that time in his life.

Anon finally came out of the woods, followed a road that he hoped leads into a main street. He walked past the urban living houses, past the gas stations and many, many people, and big ass intersections. Turning into a corner he was in familiar scenery, he was in his neighborhood and finally at his front door. Thankfully Anon keeps a spare key under a fake rock.
"Finally hoome" moaned Anon. Now there wasn't a moment to waste, he quickly got everything he needed and then some. Now it's time to go. Before Anon left the house, he caught a quick glimpse of himself in the mirror that hangs next to the front door. It wasn't until Anon was walking down in the direction of the police station when he thought, "Were my sideburns.. longer? I thought I shaved them? ...Whatever."

It wasn't long until Anon started seeing commotion as he got closer to the police station. Parking spaces were packed, tons of people moving together and Anon could see a dozen antennas from news broadcast vehicles as well as anchor men and women speaking to the camera. They must be talking about me being missing.. and Rory. Anon didn't know why, but he started feeling very irritated. Fuck, everyone's so fucking loud! Shut the hell up! he thought. He then went up to the large crowd gathered in front of the station, where Nancie behind a podium with dozens of microphones was standing, as well as Erik and a few other officers.
"Me and everyone at the station here wants you to know that we're doing everything we can to locate Mr. Anon. As well as the werewolf." said Nancie
"What do you think Mr. Anon's current condition is?" asked a reporter girl.
"We did find signs of a struggle, but no blood thankfully. I believe Mr. Anon is still alive at least." Nancie said ominously.
"What about all the semen samples at the site?" said another reporter as the the entire crowd burst into laughter, including the officers while Nancie gave a toothy grin.
Oh god, Anon thought to himself feeling very embarrassed, as though he felt like they knew what actually happened. Anon did realize he can end all this crap if he just forced his way through the crowd and reveal himself. Though he is a little surprised no one's recognized him till now of all places. But something was keeping him from doing just that. In the back of his mind he was waiting for something; someone. Actually now that he thought about it, putting himself out there would be too much hassle, dealing with the reporters and their questions and shit, not to mention everyone was freaking loud. Think I'll just go to the back of the station and stay in my office. As soon as Anon turned around he bumped into a very large man.
"Oh shit, sorry abou-!!! (What the?!)" Anon couldn't explain it, but he caught a small whiff of the air; fresh soil and testosterone. Anon looked up at the mans face. His jet hair glistened in the sun and his big wolfish grin.
"I Found you!" Rory said softly "My little detective."

Rory?! Anon could not believe that Rory himself was in front of him, of all the places?! In less than a second, Anon took hold of Rory's forearm and he swore he heard a small yelp from him, "I'm not squeezing that tight" he thought as he yanked him from the crowd to an empty alley where they can 'talk'.
"What the *fuck* are you doing?!" exclaimed Anon as quietly and angrily as he could so that no one could hear.
"I came to find you!"
"And you came here?!"
"I know, but you wouldn't slow down and I couldn't call out to ya. Buut, I guess I could've met you at your house earlier. What I mean is, I was at your house."
"Where-what-when?"
"A little earlier than you, but everything was locked so I couldn't get inside. And then you came, but I just stayed in the backyard till you left"
"...Then you followed me here? Approached me, to the very crowd everyone around would recognize in a split second and to the very people who want to put you away?" Anon crossed his arms, Rory flinched at every word.
"Yeeaah" he said timidly "Also you're still holding my arm"
Anon noticed as soon as Rory said that and let go. Fuck, even human Rory is fucking massive. He can still feel how tough Rory's arm felt. Imagine those big, thick arms embracing me. They both stood in silence in the old alley. Rory was happy he found his "little detective". But Anon on the other hand, he felt hungry. Very hungry. God I'm so fucking hungry. He then weighed what was more important in that moment. It was either; get some food or arrest Rory. Anon sighed and made up his mind.
"Let's.. go eat somewhere" he said wearily, the hunger was getting to him. Rory was a little confused, but excited.
"Cool, I could go eat!" said Rory with a handsome, fangy smile. Fuck! Don't smile like that with those big ass fangs! Anon thought trying not to imagine Rory letting him feel them. After many calculated twists and turns through the city to avoid either of them getting noticed, which was a little hard considering Rory's tall stature and massive frame, they finally reached a restaurant.

It was a small diner, 'Marty's 24hr Diner'. It was Anons favorite place to eat because he can get good food whenever he liked and because of his time as detective would sometimes leave him in the dead hours of the night. As soon as they entered the place it was nearly packed, it was the lunch rush it seemed. As a waitress came up to them and to make sure Rory wouldn't be noticed, Anon suggested he turn around and stare at his phone the whole time.
"Hi!" she said bubbly "Just two?"
"Y-yes" Anon said hoping no one has seen Rory's face yet. "Um.. could we have a table in the back please?"
The waitress had seated them in an room that was separated from the main area all the way in a corner table next to the kitchen doors. This a good spot, Anon thought, not to mention the room was windowless and had warm, red lighting. And with further precautions, Rory sat on the opposite seat to Anon so that his back was to the main dining area. Then the same waitress came up to their table to take their order.
"What'll be hun?" she said with a small notepad ready.
"Can I get a grilled steak, rare, with mashed potatoes? Oh! And a coke please." said Rory with the menu very close to his face.
Anon still couldn't decide what to get, he was unbelievably hungry and even though the main dishes here were pretty big, one might not even be enough. Fuck it.
"I'll have the double cheeseburger with fries, a sloppy joe, the meat sauce spaghetti, and..." Anon considered the steak even though he never liked steak, but after coming in here and seeing plates of it coming out of the kitchen he decided to have some anyway "And a grilled steak, with steak fries. And a coke too please"
"Ah hungry today aren't we!" she said with a smile "So how do you want the meats to be hun?"
(Fuck! The meat, I forgot.) Anon thought, he always got medium well, but he had some craving he couldn't explain and so, (Fuck it) "Rare.. please"
"Alrighty then!" she said marking it down. She reached to take the menus, but as she reached for Rory's who was still using it to hide, he quickly said
"I'll keep the menu. Thanks" That was close, they both thought.

As soon as the food came they both devoured it like hungry beasts, it had all gone just as it came. Anon couldn't believe how much he ate and wasn't painfully full or anything! In fact, there was a lot of things he couldn't explain now that he thought about it. It was at this point Anon felt that something else is going on besides all the shit that's been happening. And he had considered it, oh very much. But the more he thought about it, the more it made him feel hot and bothered. Nervous. Excited. I need to know, he thought feeling even more nervous.

"Rory" Anon said, as Rory was relaxing and had his eyes fixed on him. Anon was trying his hardest what to ask next, it was just getting him more hot and bothered. Not to mention Rory's tight shirt wasn't fucking helping.
"I've noticed that.. some things are different.. about me" as Anon said this, Rory's grin was growing. "Did.. did you do something?"
There was a moment of silence between them. Anon was readying for Rory's response and then he spoke.
"So you finally noticed?" he said adjusting in his seat, not taking his yellow eyes off Anon and had his wolfish grin. "It's like I said back there, last night. Remember? Waiting for my new, **pack**, **mate**" Anon's entire body was rushing. Hoping to hear the words.

"You're a werewolf Anon"
