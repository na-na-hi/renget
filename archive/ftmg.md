##Emergency Baker Guide##
!!! warning Emergency Baker Guide:
	1. Breads are to be baked & announced as soon as the bump limit of 300 has been reached
	2. If no new bread has been posted after bump limit but the current baker has NOT indicated they are done, please wait until around ~330 before announcing a new bake but create a bake when the thread is at least on page 8 and prior to 500 posts.
	3. CTRL+F "bake" & "baking" in the thread to see if anyone else has already announced their intention to take over
	4. If there is time, check the catalogue to see if no other bread is already prepared 
	5. When announcing your intention to bake, make it obvious - e.g. "BAKING", "I WILL BAKE", etc. 
	- To avoid thread splitting: He who announces first, shall bake... UNLESS either of the following apply:
	*(1) The first to announce was an obvious troll 
	(2) The first to announce was a tripfag*
	6. Post links to your new thread in the previous one, & again, make it obvious - e.g., "NEW THREAD HERE >>[Thread Number]"
