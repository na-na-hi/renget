##### `Wolf Milk`
>Waifur always wants to make your morning coffee.
>You've had coffee a lot, but the way she makes it is just so special that it tastes absolutely incredible.
>Better than anything you'd ever had as a matter of fact.
>When you ask "what's the secret?", she merely gives you a knowing, innocent smile, saying it's her "secret recipe cream".
>She beams with pride when you start drinking your "morning pick me up."
>And when the warm drink is done, you see her blushing heavily, taking careful breaths, and eyes you with those same bedroom eyes.
>("What on earth could she be up to?") you wondered.
