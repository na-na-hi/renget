## Narrative Summarization
!!! (8/22/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #01 No Stranger to Disaster 
This world is full of peril and danger greater than what the natives can handle on their own. In these times of need, looking beyond becomes a necessity to ensure the survival of all that we know. So... something reaches out and pulls in the willing heroes. You've answered the call, whether consciously or by accident. You're here now, in a world full of only Pokémon, as a Pokémon.

!!! note (9/05/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV01 Abrupt Awakening
You wake up in a strange place, with even stranger company. Whatever and wherever you are, this definitely isn't Kansas or Kalos anymore. Structures older than you've ever seen before tower over you, exploring the ruins with others who are all supposedly share the same predicament as your own. Eventually encountering mysterious gates leading to far-flung places, you're encouraged by an eccentric Orbeetle, Turning Trails, to escape through them. The supposed stranded 'mon is a seeker of glory, a treasure hunter! But that's just his word...

Arriving on the plains of the Air Continent, almost immediately do you find yourself beset by a challenge from nature. A stormful of ash clouds the sky, threatening to choke you out or leave you as a burnt crisp. Scrambling together under the pretense of survival, the group manages to assemble a shelter in time to survive the disaster and ride it through the night. Raining embers... what an odd sight.

!!! note (9/16/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV02 Town Called Baram
Escaping the heat from the escalating ash-storm-turned-forest-fire, your group treks across the hazardous terrain. With the guidance offered by Turning Trails, it's not long before you enter the first lick of civilization since the very abrupt arrival. The cozy and coastal Baram Town probably would look better during the day, you might admit. However, you're exhausted beyond belief and could want for nothing more than some safe place to pass out.

You find what you're looking for in the form of the Subsumed Château, an inn run by an all-too generous Primarina. To the point that you might think it's suspicious. Regardless, you take them on the offer, without much else choice in the matter. Beggars can't really be choosers. As you prepare to wind down from your escapades, another begins, down at the docks. With little subtlety and all the fanfare, a group of mysterious troublemakers abscond with an entire vessel, Turning Trails included! Had you been had? Exhaustion is catching up to you, and this must be a problem for future you.

As you spend the next day or so in the town, learning the lay of the land, you learn from a distraught Pokémon that the boat had indeed been stolen. With little else you can do, other than ask questions, your investigation goes cold. Retiring to the rooms, your well-deserved rest is interrupted by some unruly patrons, convinced you're nothing more than leeches looking to bleed the proprietor dry! Battling them off to see the dawn, you manage to subdue the Dreepy and his crew of ghost buddies. Looks like you'll need some more rest.

!!! info (9/20/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ01 Cat-astrophic Marketplace
After a rough night and a lost appetite for slumber, you exit the uncomfortable confines of your potentially-temporary home and spend your morning wandering around town. Feeling tired, sore, and unfamiliar with your surroundings, you find strange relief in learning of other's problems, notably a Charmeleon lamenting the destruction of his merchandise, and a group of delinquents vandalizing the town's darkest corners.  In the end, after a successful deal for some Berries with the delinquents announcing themselves as the 'Bright Bandits,' you help make a smoothie for a quiet Espurr with a headache, leaving Charmeleon to fix his problem himself.

!!! info (9/21/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ02 Near Farfetch'd
Upon seeing some activity by a strange tent tucked away in a corner, your group ends up aiding a Sneasler looking to rescue a Farfetch'd from her guild. After learning the basics of dungeon exploration, you eventually find the Farfetch'd struck with some sort of mental affliction. However, this situation explodes into action when a weird Orb riles up all the ferals in the dungeon! After promptly tying up the Farfetch'd and weathering the literal stampede, a quick deduction finds that he was met with an unknown assailant, an identity which remains inconclusive...

!!! info (9/24/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ03 For Want of a Tame
The group sneak through the fogs of a secluded grove to find a few rare 'meat' berries for a traveling chef.

!!! (9/30/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #02 Rub-a-dub Ravine

!!! note (10/3/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV03 Stay HAPPI

!!! (10/7/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #03 The Color of Strife

!!! info (10/8/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ03 Blast Seed Bomber
Back to bothering Kleavor once again, you discover a "Detective Croagunk" loitering in the general area. He's in town to seek aid in bringing a criminal explosives enthusiast Frogadier to justice! After being accompanied to an underground cavern lake, you quickly find that its passages are trapped with bombs, ready to go with hair triggers. In the end of a dicey, spiky, and bomb-y encounter, you successfully apprehend the criminal, handing them off to Detective Croagunk. You've left an impression... perhaps you'll see more bounties in the future.
