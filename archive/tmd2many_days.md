## Narrative Summarization
!!! (8/22/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #00 No Stranger to Disaster 
This world is full of peril and danger greater than what the natives can handle on their own. In these times of need, looking beyond becomes a necessity to ensure the survival of all that we know. So... something reaches out and pulls in the willing heroes. You've answered the call, whether consciously or by accident. You're here now, in a world full of only Pokémon, as a Pokémon.

!!! note (9/05/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV01 Abrupt Awakening
You wake up in a strange place, with even stranger company. Whatever and wherever you are, this definitely isn't Kansas or Kalos anymore. Structures older than you've ever seen before tower over you, exploring the ruins with others who are all supposedly share the same predicament as your own. Eventually encountering mysterious gates leading to far-flung places, you're encouraged by an eccentric Orbeetle, Turning Trails, to escape through them. The supposed stranded 'mon is a seeker of glory, a treasure hunter! But that's just his word...

Arriving on the plains of the Air Continent, almost immediately do you find yourself beset by a challenge from nature. A stormful of ash clouds the sky, threatening to choke you out or leave you as a burnt crisp. Scrambling together under the pretense of survival, the group manages to assemble a shelter in time to survive the disaster and ride it through the night. Raining embers... what an odd sight.

Escaping the heat

!!! info (9/20/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ01 Cat-astrophic Marketplace
After a rough night and a lost appetite for slumber, you exit the uncomfortable confines of your potentially-temporary home and spend your morning wandering around town. Feeling tired, sore, and unfamiliar with your surroundings, you find strange relief in learning of other's problems, notably a Charmeleon lamenting the destruction of his merchandise, and a group of delinquents vandalizing the town's darkest corners.  In the end, after a successful deal or some Berries with the delinquents calling themselves the 'Bright Bandits,' you help make a smoothie for a quiet Espurr with a headache, leaving Charmeleon to fix his problem himself.

!!! info (9/21/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ02 Near Farfetch'd
Upon seeing some activity by a strange tent tucked away in a corner, your group ends up aiding a Sneasler looking to rescue a Farfetch'd from her guild. After learning the basics of dungeon exploration, you eventually find the Farfetch'd struck with some sort of mental affliction. However, this situation explodes into action when a weird Orb riles up all the ferals in the dungeon! After promptly tying up the Farfetch'd and weathering the literal stampede, a quick deduction finds that he was met with an unknown assailant, an identity which remains inconclusive...
