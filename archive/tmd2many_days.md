## Narrative Summarization
!!! (8/22/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #01 No Stranger to Disaster 
This world is full of peril and danger greater than what the natives can handle on their own. In these times of need, looking beyond becomes a necessity to ensure the survival of all that we know. So... something reaches out and pulls in the willing heroes. You've answered the call, whether consciously or by accident. You're here now, in a world full of only Pokémon, as a Pokémon.

!!! note (9/05/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV01 Abrupt Awakening
You wake up in a strange place, with even stranger company. Whatever and wherever you are, this definitely isn't Kansas or Kalos anymore. Structures older than you've ever seen before tower over you, exploring the ruins with others who are all supposedly share the same predicament as your own. Eventually encountering mysterious gates leading to far-flung places, you're encouraged by an eccentric Orbeetle, Turning Trails, to escape through them. The supposed stranded 'mon is a seeker of glory, a treasure hunter! But that's just his word...

Arriving on the plains of the Air Continent, almost immediately do you find yourself beset by a challenge from nature. A stormful of ash clouds the sky, threatening to choke you out or leave you as a burnt crisp. Scrambling together under the pretense of survival, the group manages to assemble a shelter in time to survive the disaster and ride it through the night. Raining embers... what an odd sight.

!!! note (9/16/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV02 Town Called Baram
Escaping the heat from the escalating ash-storm-turned-forest-fire, your group treks across the hazardous terrain. With the guidance offered by Turning Trails, it's not long before you enter the first lick of civilization since the very abrupt arrival. The cozy and coastal Baram Town probably would look better during the day, you might admit. However, you're exhausted beyond belief and could want for nothing more than some safe place to pass out.

You find what you're looking for in the form of the Subsumed Château, an inn run by an all-too generous Primarina. To the point that you might think it's suspicious. Regardless, you take them on the offer, without much else choice in the matter. Beggars can't really be choosers. As you prepare to wind down from your escapades, another begins, down at the docks. With little subtlety and all the fanfare, a group of mysterious troublemakers abscond with an entire vessel, Turning Trails included! Had you been had? Exhaustion is catching up to you, and this must be a problem for future you.

As you spend the next day or so in the town, learning the lay of the land, you learn from a distraught Pokémon that the boat had indeed been stolen. With little else you can do, other than ask questions, your investigation goes cold. Retiring to the rooms, your well-deserved rest is interrupted by some unruly patrons, convinced you're nothing more than leeches looking to bleed the proprietor dry! Battling them off to see the dawn, you manage to subdue the Dreepy and his crew of ghost buddies. Looks like you'll need some more rest.

!!! info (9/20/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ01 Cat-astrophic Marketplace
After a rough night and a lost appetite for slumber, you exit the uncomfortable confines of your potentially-temporary home and spend your morning wandering around town. Feeling tired, sore, and unfamiliar with your surroundings, you find strange relief in learning of other's problems, notably a Charmeleon lamenting the destruction of his merchandise, and a group of delinquents vandalizing the town's darkest corners.  In the end, after a successful deal for some Berries with the delinquents announcing themselves as the 'Bright Bandits,' you help make a smoothie for a quiet Espurr with a headache, leaving Charmeleon to fix his problem himself.

!!! info (9/21/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ02 Near Farfetch'd
Upon seeing some activity by a strange tent tucked away in a corner, your group ends up aiding a Sneasler looking to rescue a Farfetch'd from her guild. After learning the basics of dungeon exploration, you eventually find the Farfetch'd struck with some sort of mental affliction. However, this situation explodes into action when a weird Orb riles up all the ferals in the dungeon! After promptly tying up the Farfetch'd and weathering the literal stampede, a quick deduction finds that he was met with an unknown assailant, an identity which remains inconclusive...

!!! info (9/24/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ03 For Want of a Tame
Hired by an eccentric traveling chef, Berry Sizzler, for an interesting job, you're sent into the depths of a hidden grove for the express purpose of recovering rare "meat berries:" strange fleshy berries that are highly prized for their texture and flavor, found only in Mystery Dungeons. Within this hidden grove, you quickly find the path guarded and hosts a pack of feral Houndours. Snatching your prize and fleeing with embers hot on your trails, you all safely make it out of the dungeon and receive a delightful snack for your efforts!

!!! (9/30/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #02 Rub-a-dub Ravine
There's a critical lack of experience with adventuring between all of you, so in order to remedy that, your group heads out into a nearby ravine to get your toes figuratively and literally wet in the life of an explorer. As far as it goes, it's actually a pretty tame endeavor. You manage to save an Azumarill from tumbling over a waterfall, who provides a little bit of local help in directing you through the ravine. Eventually, you find yourselves crowding the end of where the water flows, suddenly surrounded by an imposing force of Poliwhirls. Gearing up for a confrontation... is unnecessary! These wildmon would prefer to just give a good massage. You all leave feeling refreshed.

!!! note (10/3/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV03 Stay HAPPI
A mysterious benefactor from your dreams divulges information regarding one of your goals toward legitimization: forming recognized teams! They tell you to head out to search for a Sneasel. True to their word, one winds up in Baram Town, with the capability to get your problem sorted out. Convenient, isn't it? Now you can't help but wonder who this might be... at least you've got badges!

!!! (10/7/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #03 The Color of Strife
Now officially adventurers through HAPPI, you receive a request to return to your burned-up roots. Buizel and his friends are now your concern... all of whom are already quite familiarized with some members of your entourage. In the ashen forest, it's not hard to find who you're looking for. Something is amiss, however, as you soon find the group has been consistently harassed and hunted by a mystery Pokémon. Quickly moving to secure the area, you begin fighting the shadows as the hunter, shrouded in the ash and darkness, takes the fight to all of you. With the raging sandstorm and gray dust withering your constitution, Glum Grove is returned to silence as the Greninja is knocked out.

Skipper the Froakie's exclamation tell you that this is also his mother. But why would she attack her own child? Perhaps that Twilight Syndrome might be the root cause...

!!! info (10/8/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ04 Blast Seed Bomber
Back to bothering Kleavor once again, you discover a "Detective Croagunk" loitering in the general area. He's in town to seek aid in bringing a criminal explosives enthusiast Frogadier to justice! After being accompanied to an underground cavern lake, you quickly find that its passages are trapped with bombs, ready to go with hair triggers. In the end of a dicey, spiky, and bomb-y encounter, you successfully apprehend the criminal, handing them off to Detective Croagunk. You've left an impression... perhaps you'll see more bounties in the future.

!!! (10/14/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #04 Watcher's Reverie
Deep in your dreams, you find yourself somewhere familiar that you don't quite recall anywhere in your mind. An easing voice has called out to you, flanked by a calming green ambiance. Wherever you are, this is definitely nowhere in the waking world. As you look around in this infinite expanse, a Gardevoir suddenly appears before you, claiming to have six answers for six questions. You learn that you're here as a solution: a living key to a terrible, unfolding disaster, called forth by the Voice of Life standing before you. Something is out there seeking the destruction of the world... and it's found you! Darkness explodes into the dream like a flood, and the Voice of Life moves to guarantee your escape out of this nightmare.

One by one, you "wake up," until you're down to last the struggling to leave the dream. As the final member of your group begins clawing back to reality, her parting words tell you that she'll watch over all of you, as best as she can. And with that statement, you're all awake. With her fate unknown, you can only hope that the Voice of Life escaped the dark clutches of the malevolent force. 

!!! (10/17/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #05 The Foreshore Turnabout
On the shores of a black sandy beach, you're here to steal back a ship and everything on it! You certainly don't have your sea legs, much less any experience under the belt with your new forms, but now is the time to be tested by fire! Or water, or grass. Semantics, really. You all quickly board the vessel and wrestle control from the Sprigatitos swarming the decks of the craft, moving throughout the various levels to uncover the strange secrets and find any stowaways. 

Meanwhile, the cave has you find that traitorous Turning Trails, accompanied by that Meowscarada that fled on the same ship your group is taking back. With a loud rumbling, the ship slides off the shore and floats once more. Taking the opportunity, everyone regroups and flees, nearly being caught by the impressively fast trickster cat. As you sail away successfully, you can't help but wonder what they needed this for. An... ultimate treasure?

!!! info (11/11/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ05 Local Treasures
After meeting the dubiously-titled Professor Salandit and his assistant, he hires your group to seek out a lost tablet from the Marrow Tribe that was stolen by bandits. Retrieving the old text, a recounting of the tribe's foundation, Salandit offers payment and suggests that he'll consider hiring you for more assistance. Although the mission was a success, and you've established some connections, you can't help but feel there's something off about the whole ordeal...

!!! info (12/02/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #SQ06 Ruined Trial
The group visits the Marrow Tribe after an invitation from Cubone. There, they shop and interact with the locals, while Mohka, Dustin, Wallis, Kaz, Darius, and Matchia decide to take an early trial meant for the tribe's newcomers to prove themselves. However, when they enter, Darius, Kaz, Wallis, and Matchia are lead astray by the lingering spirit of Chien-Pao, known to the locals as the Blade, and Kaz strikes a deal with the beast for their safety...

!!! (12/05/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #06 Echoing Forest

!!! note (12/11/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #EV04 Fleeting Twilight
The gaggle of ghosts and the 'mons you rescued from the ashen forest have decided upon trying to break into the quarantine house that keeps Skipper the Froakie's mother. Against better judgement, most of you head in to ascertain what exactly is causing the affliction. Trying all you might, it only seems Skipper, his friends, and the bar's ghostly regulars are rewarded for their bravery with... the sight of Skipper's mother attempting to end the little Froakie. This... is more than just a normal disease.

!!! (12/12/23 ᴇᴀʀᴛʜ ᴛɪᴍᴇ) - #07 Holy Grounds, Holy Airs
Hired by the elders of the clans, you're all tasked with ferrying a large offering (one that requires multiple 'mons to even lift it) across the stretch of the Dragonhymn, a holy site for many within these lands. Howling wind buffets you at every step you take, and your group struggles to keep everything from flying away. It doesn't particularly help that the ferals of the dungeon, something that they did not inform you of, seem keen on making everything incredibly difficult. As you battle your way through against nature and foe, you arrive at an impasse, when the only way is up.

Taking the chance, you ride the winds up with the plated offering, landing safely above. Quickly, you learn that it must be deposited into the wind tunnel, and you watch your hard work literally swept away by the winds. It seems that had always been the intention. Shortly afterwards, a mesmerizing sight streaks across the sky... a falling meteor... followed by an explosion in Baram!
