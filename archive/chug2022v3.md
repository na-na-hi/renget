!!! warning Emergency Baker Guide
	1. Breads are to be baked & announced as soon as the bump limit of 300 has been reached
	2. If no new bread has been posted after bump limit but the current baker has NOT indicated they are done, please wait until around ~330 before announcing a new bake
	3. CTRL+F "bake" & "baking" in the thread to see if anyone else has already announced their intention to take over
	4. If there is time, check the catalogue to see if no other bread is already prepared 
	5. When announcing your intention to bake, make it obvious - e.g. "BAKING", "I WILL BAKE", etc. 
	- To avoid thread splitting: He who announces first, shall bake... UNLESS either of the following apply:
	*(1) The first to announce was an obvious shill 
	(2) The first to announce was a memeflag*
	6. When posting your OP, remember to put the correct thread # in the subject and to link the previous OP
	7. If you are lacking OP images, refer to the emblem repository in the "Links/Resources" pasta
	8. Post links to your new thread in the previous one, & again, make it obvious - e.g., "NEW THREAD HERE >>[Thread Number]" 
	9. If you can no longer bake, be sure to announce it as EARLY in the thread as possible - e.g. "NEW BAKER NEEDED", "BAKER IS LEAVING", etc. 
	10. Stay comfy, fuck kikes, and thank you for your service!

## Bypassing Catbox block

▶Video not playing?
First try a different browser since it might be a codec issue. Still not playing? Download the file (right click -> save as) and play it locally in a player like VLC, MPV or MPC-HC. Many players can open the video URL directly to stream it.

▶Fatbox/Pixstash proxy
People complain about not being able to access Catbox in their country for various reasons, whether its a country-wide block or ISP/DNS related.
One possible way to get around this without a VPN is to use Fatbox or Pixstash proxies. They can bypass these blocks since they were originally created to be able to access files on Catbox using Tor. To do this manually per file change the URL from https://files.catbox.moe to https://files.fatbox.moe or https://files.pixstash.moe. For https://litter.catbox.moe use https://litter.fatbox.moe. This can also be setup up to work automatically using the instructions below:

>Install the Redirector extension
- [Firefox addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/redirector/)
- [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd)

Or alternatively from: https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector

>Save the following configuration to a file called "Redictor.json"
```json
{
    "createdBy": "Redirector v3.5.3",
    "createdAt": "2024-02-20T11:00:50.397Z",
    "redirects": [
        {
            "description": "",
            "exampleUrl": "https://files.catbox.moe/",
            "exampleResult": "https://files.fatbox.moe/",
            "error": null,
            "includePattern": "https://files.catbox.moe/(.*)",
            "excludePattern": "",
            "patternDesc": "",

            "patternType": "R",
            "processMatches": "noProcessing",
            "disabled": false,
            "grouped": false,
            "appliesTo": [
                "main_frame"
            ]
        },
        {
            "description": "",
            "exampleUrl": "https://litter.catbox.moe/",
            "exampleResult": "https://litter.fatbox.moe/",
            "error": null,
            "includePattern": "https://litter.catbox.moe/(.*)",
            "excludePattern": "",
            "patternDesc": "",
            "redirectUrl": "https://litter.fatbox.moe/$1",
            "patternType": "R",
            "processMatches": "noProcessing",
            "disabled": false,
            "grouped": false,
            "appliesTo": [
                "main_frame"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
>Import the "Redirector.json" configuration file from the extension settings
The extension will now redirect all https://files.catbox.moe/ and https://litter.catbox.moe requests to https://fatbox.moe/.
Copy the above configuration and repeat the same for https://files.pixstash.moe.

This makes some shills so mad, they will take their memeflags off just to tell you how mad you make them!

Remember
\>shills are paid by the post and by the (You)
\>starving them of (You)s directly affects their personal income!
Make sure to remind shills that they are fat nerd virgins who work for Langley for slave wages, but never give them a (You)! You will filter them, but they NEVER filter you! Post comfy and fun images you know they hate, because they will see it every time, and you will never see their response.
You can also filter persistent shills by ID per thread. This takes only two clicks - whenever you see the first shill post, just filter his ID immediately, hit F5 and enjoy the rest of the thread.

Stay Comfy Kings!
