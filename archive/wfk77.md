#Captain's Log

Argo, Captain's Log. Date: 23/03/58. 0745 Hours.

We have successfully made it to the region that was once the North-East of the United States of America. The level of civilization is of predicted; that being minimal. There seems to be multiple factions declaring themselves the "Last legitimate remnant of the U.S Government", but none possess the capabilities of the original. Further investigation will take place.

In the meantime, records of significant individuals encountered will be documented.

>Sasha the Snake 
Mutant. Either a human mutated into a snake, or a snake mutated to human. Female. Limited intelligence, functions primarily on instinct. Resilience to be noted, small calibers largely ineffective, while physical capability is extremely high. Little more than an animal, simple enough to avoid until opportunity for termination.

>Ramses
Mutant. Inhuman, and seemingly proud of it. Disturbingly for a mutant, it has demonstrated high cognitive levels, as well as some psychic abilities, and extreme physical prowess. Objective is to unify "mutant-kind" to dominate the wasteland. To be terminated at earliest opportunity. 

>Dr. Charles Crane
Human. As civilized as a person raised in these wastes could be. Noted for his intelligence and rare level of medical skill. Extremely empathic, good bedside manner. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Mike the Driver
Human. In possession of potent ground based vehicle. Operates transport service. May be of future use for recon or reclamation. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Ricky W. Booth
Human. Operates a light aircraft as a courier. Potential use for similar missions as above. Note that his mannerisms conceal a cunning mind. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Lockley Aimes 
Human. Pilot of light aircraft. While intelligence is to be noted, so to his her youth, inexperience, and potential mental health issues. Probable psychic powers. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Marcus Cassius Allen 
Human. Claims to be from the past, had unproductive words to say upon meeting. Skills indicate extreme level of competence on the battlefield. Equipment is of claimed time period. Research time travel claims further. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Karnak
Mutant. Slave of Ramses. Lethality in close quarters to be noted. Minor irritation over radio frequencies otherwise. To be terminated.

>Aaron Cob "THE ANT KING"
Human. Displays behavior synonymous with dissociative disorders. Has giant ants under his control. Investigate pheromones and possible uses. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Magnus Wang 
Mutant. Reports indicate reproductive organs are hopelessly deformed. Capable combatant otherwise. May have use as mercenary. Termination of low priority.

>The Nymphs
Mutants. Tribe of mutant cannibals. Their territory may provide useful equipment, but they themselves are to be terminated when possible. Note to keep distance and possess auditory protection if encountered.

>Kara Ramirez
Human. Proficient cook in possession of vehicle. Disapproves of our activities, but in no position to oppose us. May provide use in logistics in the future. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Amu 
Robot. Data indicates that it was an automated assistant personality in the controlling of a former airship named Sky Sovereign. Databanks almost certainly contain useful information. In search for parts of its airship, as it apparently was looted over time. Reclamation of vessel and related technology to be of high priority. Plans in place to aid it in reconstructing its former ship for future use.

>Samson
Mutant. Uncertain if any genetic heritage is human. Dangerous in close quarters, capable of limited flight. Terminate when possible.

>Isha, Princess of the Verzon Tribe 
Human. Despite limited/no education, high level of cognitive performance indicated. Technophobic, of very little use to our mission. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Hannah Ossus 
Mutant. Demonstrates extreme combat potential. Of minimal danger so long interaction is avoided. Termination of low priority, assuming no changes in behavior.

>Nikto 
Mutant. Experienced an attack by mutants, which resulted in his own mutation. A sellsword, may prove useful as a hire for certain missions. Upon termination, dissection in order to research mutations further.

>H0P3 
Robot. Databanks contain wide range of useful information. Has no defenses beyond its "customers" providing it with such, in order to further access its information. Acquiring could prove difficult owing to said customers, but reclamation is to be a priority.

>Sage 
Mutant. Reports of her being an experiment. Numerous external symbiotic lifeforms attached to her. Dissection to further understand wasteland levels of gene-editing a priority.

>Yuki Kikuchi
Human. Personality profile suggests she is mostly harmless to our mission. Could prove a useful hire in certain missions. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Dr. Remilia Rochefort
Human. Originates from a bunker that survived the collapse. Gene-profile should be stable. High degree of cognitive competence demonstrated in multiple fields. Considered for a long term hire. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.
 
>Quinn Chase
Human. Another inhabitant of U.S bunkers. Acts as a gang leader, demonstrates multiple skill sets. May prove to be a useful associate for future endeavors. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Alexander S. Luthor 
Human. Presence of another inhabitant of bunkers suggests a greater level of genetic stability than originally predicted. Similar to Chase in that he aims to become powerful in the wasteland. May be another useful contact. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Ultra Magnus
Human. Not seen without his armor. Said armor is of pre-collapse quality. Honor-bound mindset. Useful contact so long as honor is demonstrated. While his equipment is of notable quality, he demonstrates no technical knowledge related to its maintenance. Potential opening for fostering good relation. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Heli Matharom 
Human. Demonstrates atypical reaction to mutants and mutations, to the point of admonishing preservation of humanity. Termination may prove necessary. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Nick
Human. Abnormal level of physical performance, beyond even what is expected from external examination of his body. Potential mutant. If discovered deceased, dissect for more information. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Georgia Dolittle & Bob 
Mutant. Appears to be a sad case of a pregnant female falling foul of a mutation to her unborn child. Considerable combat risk, particularly from various animal companions she keeps close to her. Low priority for termination.

>Lance 
Human. Radio host with notable technological setup. Could prove to be of great use in gaining information of surrounding territories, as well as pacifying local population. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Calliope 
Human. Mental health issues apparent. Potential hire for certain missions, but this is unlikely owing to aforementioned mental state. Terminate if she obstructs mission. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Brunnea "Sunny" Brown 
Mutant. Imitates pre-war crime culture. Of no use to the mission. Professes pro-mutant ideology. Terminate if obstructive. 

>Lin 
Human. Noteworthy combat abilities. Potential for hiring, but note a complete lack of common sense. Always seeking a challenge, could prove useful for reclamation projects. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.

>Maya Liang 
Cybernetic Mutant. Clear destructive capabilities, stymied from obvious lapses in lucidity. Reports indicate that she is seeking a way to reverse what has happened to her. Potential project? If not, terminate when possible.

>Marty Robbins
Human. Demonstrates behavior reminiscent of "wild west" genre of media. Should not prove to be obstructive. Collect genetic sample to test for degradation.


Richard Major stopped the recording, stood up, and stretched. It had been a busy period. He and his crew were tasked with cataloging the damage done to organisms from the collapse, and from the look of it, there was a lot of work to do. 
Raiders, mutants, tribals. What had been the most powerful nation on the planet was reduced to such a state. If only they hadn't sent the rest of the world there with them. He walked over to a porthole, looking down on the wastes. If civilization was to be restored, there was much to do. So much...
