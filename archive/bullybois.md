>with a strong cough on your knuckle you say:
"I'm here to join your club" 

>the otter stands up quickly and blurts out his answer
>"Of course! J-Just take a seat right there and make yourself comfortable!"
>there was a certain edge of panic in his voice

>immediately the two starts scoping you out, seeing what makes you tick
>damn there's a hierarchy even among nerds? 
>you sit up straighter which makes you taller than the rest on the table

>he was tempted to run his paws all over you and maybe even a lick in
>plus your size just tickles him in all the right areas
