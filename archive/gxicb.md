"Yoisho"

Kiara let out a loud sigh, plopping herself down on the bench at the bottom of the ski hill. Bending over to undo her ski shoes from her skis, a small wince peeled at her face. Her body had been soar from a long day of skiing. Well, that, and some crashing too. Having not done much physical excercize in a long while, her body wasn't used to the stress and it really did take its toll.

"I can't wait to get inside and relax" she whispered to no one in particular.

Once her skis were off, she ran her hands over her sore legs, massaging them slowly as she began to sit back up. Turning, she looked up the mountain to see RMT riding the ski lift up to the top, only about 20 seconds from getting off. Kiara was surprised at how much she was actually able to keep up with her friend, considering she hadn't skied in years and her friend went multiple times a year. Still, watching her friend zip down the steep hill in front of her while she slowly scooted along was impressive.

Feeling and hearing her stomach growl, Kiara's attention was torn away from the mountain in front of her. In reality, not only did she want to go back into the warmth of the cabin they were staying at, but she also was getting a little hungry. The dinner the prior night left nothing to be desired and she looked forward to another good, full meal. Well, that, and 2 desserts. She smiled to herself thinking about how nice the staff was in her last couple vacations and how she managed to milk extra dessert out of them every time. Cakes, pies, cookies, strussle...

Another stomach growl pulled her out of her sugar daydream, but this time it was accompanied by something else. Something a bit more annoying, but there was nothing she really could do about it except wait. Placing a hand on her stomach area, she rubbed lightly through the puffy jacket she bought for the trip, trying to rub away the very light pain that she could feel in her abdomen. Leaning lightly and inconspicuously to one side, she released a small bit of gas, the heat from it a stark contrast to the weather outside. She could feel the heat run along her crack as a small amount of abdominal pressure was relieved.

'Ugh, I don't know why this happens to me so often' she thought.

Truth is, she knew exactly why she was in the state she was currently. Her food choices had been heavy and solid, not very healthy, and lacking in any real substance. Friday night was fast food, her favorite, a chicken burger from Burger King with fries and an Oreo shake. Saturday Morning was the last slice of cake from one she had purchased a few days prior. Snacking for lunch on chips and a banana during the stream. Saturday night was another favorite of hers, lasagna. Sunday was breakfast with RMT on the road, pancakes were an easy choice. And Sunday night was the impeccably well made schnitzel and sausage, with a boatload of cookies for dessert.

The other real problem with all of this was the fact that she fought the urge to go multiple times because she was too busy to be inconvenienced. She pushed it off during the German members stream on Friday because it was a short stream and she didn't want to leave. She pushed it off on Saturday because she felt like it might take longer than normal and she didn't want her chickens to be suspicious. Once the stream was over, she waited a while with no returning feeling before going to the bathroom and trying to make something happen, which only yielded in a bit of gas being nosily released and a little bit of pressure being taken off her stomach. Sunday was the ride in and she always had issues on travel days just because she didn't want to inconvenience herself or her traveling partners. Once they got to the hotel, she had similar results, although this time a little more self-conscious about the sound. RMT hadn't mentioned anything about the sound and she had the TV on while Kiara was in the bathroom, so she was almost positive she wasn't heard.

"HEY KIARA, EARTH TO KIARA!"

Kiara was snapped once again out her thoughts, looking up to see RMT in front of her.

"You know you could go inside, you don't have to wait for me out here" RMT said with a little concern in her voice.

Waving a hand in the air, Kiara let out a little chuckle. "Oh no, it's fine, I can wait for you. It's not a problem."

RMT lets out a sigh. "Well, I'm gonna go do one more run on the double diamond this time. Just go inside and get yourself a hot chocolate while you wait for me. I don't need you getting lost in another daydream and freezing out here" she says with a smirk pulling at her lips.

With that, Kiara stands up moving to collect her skis, the bending over causing her once again to wince a little.

"Ok, I guess you're right. It's kind of dumb for me to sit out here waiting for you when I have a warm, cozy gift shop to poke around in"

With that, RMT used her poles to push her back towards the ski lift again.

"Alright, I'll meet you in there once I'm done with this last run"

Turning towards the store, Kiara gives RMT one last nod before heading towards the doors. Setting her skis on the rack outside, she clumsily enters, the boots on her feet making it much hard to walk normally. On hearing someone enter, the clerk behind the counter looks up and gives her a light nod before returning his attention to his phone. Poking around, Kiara looks through various knick-knacks, trinkets, and souvenirs on the shelves, nothing in particular catching her eye. Rounding towards the back of the store, she sees a rack that might have something she really could use at the moment.

The medicine rack

Making her way up to it, she starts to look at all the small boxes and bottles lining the wall, her eyes scanning for one specific word. Finally seeing it, she reaches up to grab a box with the word 'Abf√ºhrmittel' written in small letters.

Grabbing a small water bottle out of a cooler on her way up to the counter, she sets her items down somewhat heavily to draw the man's attention away from his phone.

"That be all for you, miss" he says, scanning this two items.

The moment he picks up and looks at the box of laxatives, a small flush creeps onto her face. This random strange man now knows that she's dealing with something like that! Thinking quick on her feet, she moves to speak. "Oh, my mom is having some stomach issues so I'm just picking those up for her!" she blurts out.

"Uhhhh, okkkaaayyyy..." the clerk replies, obviously feeling a little awkward given the strange outburst from the woman in front of him. "That'll be 7.95".

"You can keep the change" she says as she sets 8 Euro on the counter and stnatches the bag from his hand. With a roll of the eyes, the clerk cashes out the transaction and returns to his fixation on his phone. 'Perfect' she thinks to herself as she hobbles over to the furthest window away from the counter. 'I can just stand back here and look like I'm looking outside for my mom and take these!'

Reaching into the bag, Kiara takes one last peak over her shoulder to make sure the clerk's attention is fully on his phone still. She pops open the box and uses her nails to rip open the small package containing two small laxative pills. With a quick wash of water, the pills disappear, no one the wiser.
Around ten minutes later, the bell chimes again and Kiara turns to see RMT walking through the door.

"Yo Kiara, you ready to head back to the cabin and get ready for dinner?"

Quickly shuffling over, Kiara gives her friend a smile.

"Oh my god, yes! That food yesterday was sooooo good, I can't wait to see what they have tonight!"

"I know, right? I'm so ready!"

"Do you think I can trick them into giving me another dessert again" Kiara asks with a devilish smile.

With a small nod from RMT, Kiara lets out a little giggle. The two of them grab their gear and wait outside for a shuttle nearby to take them back to their cabin. The two friends chit-chat, the snow on the ground making for a bumpy ride back, and for a few small farts to slip out of Kiara. Luckily none of them were loud or their smell noticeable, but it was obvious that Kiara was in desperate need for those laxatives to take effect before the night was over.
When they finally reach their cabin, the two of them take off their ski boots at the door and leave them off to the side. Kiara almost sprints off to her room before turning back to RMT.

"Do you mind if I take a shower first before we head back for dinner?"

A small nod is all she gets from her friend before she flits off to her room to grab some more comfortable cloths. Popping back out, she sees that RMT made her way to her room as well. Reaching the bathroom, Kiara flicked on the lights and fan. The bathroom layout was pretty typical. In the right corner there was a nicer Jacuzzi bathtub. Next to that was a standing shower with a glass door if your preferred to take a shower. To the left of the bathtub was your run of the mill toilet. She was glad to see it wasn't one of those shelf models like you sometimes get in older buildings like this one. The vanity and sink were to the left of that, and in the left corner, there was a full-body mirror.

Flicking on the shower to warm up the water, Kiara quickly peeled her snow gear off and removed her clothing underneath. Feeling a small pang in her stomach, she gave it a light rub and took a second to look herself over in the mirror. Everything was normal up until her eyes rested on her abdomin. The bloating from the constipation was showing its effects, as her stomach was slightly distroted outward. Pausing her rubbing, she pressed her hand against her stomach and gave a small, firm push inward.

*frrrrtrtttttttt*

She felt her cheeks reverberate as some air escaped, but nothing felt like it was moving around. Another firm push yeilded no results. Sighing, she realized she probably should have read that box before throwing it away in the trash on the way to the shuttle, but RMT was being nosey and she didn't need her finding out what she bought.

Inhaling to let out another sigh, Kiara's nose finally caught wind of one of the toots she had been letting out throughout the day. This one in particular had a very strong and bitter stink to it and as it registered in her brain, her face contorted.

'Well, at least I know that these stupid laxitives are probably doing something'

Bringing her hand up into the air, she waved lightly to try and disipate the small before walking to the shower, pulling the door open, and stepping in. Taking her time, she let the hot water run through her hair and over her body, her sore muscles easing out the tension as she slowly massaged various muscles down her body.

*Bpppttttpptt*

Another fart escaped her body as she made her way over her midsection, the sound being amplified by her cheeks being wet, the water running through her crack, and the small space she resided in providing acoustics. Within seconds, she realized that the sound wasn't the only thing that was amplified. Stifling a cough, she tried desperately to wave way some of the smell, as the enclosed space along with the moist air did nothing but make her gas that much more powerful.

"Stupid body" she murmured, grabbing for the soap hoping the scent would help cut through the bitter smell in the air.

Her prayers were answered, because as soon as she started using the soap and loofah, the scent started to disappoint and the air was cut through with a slightly sweet smell. The maple soap she had picked up the first day from the shop seemed to work wonders on removing both her sweat that built up from a day of skiing and the stink from her tush. Rinsing off the soap, she decided to just rinse her hair as she'd already used product that morning and didn't want to dry out or strip her hair of its natural oils. A few minutes more of relaxing, and she popped out of the shower, toweling herself off.
While grabbing her cloths off the vanity, Kiara looks over at the toilet.

"You're just mocking me, aren't you, you stupid toilet!"

Setting her cloths back down she marches over to the porcelain. After what seemed like a minute of debating, Kiara turns around and plants her butt on the seat, her cheeks pancaking outward, spilling over the edge slightly.

"Well, I'll show you," she says in a frustrated tone. 
*hurrrgg*

Kiara presses down internally on her bowels while her hands rest on her stomach. All she's rewarded for her efforts with is another loud release of air, just as dry as all the others the last few days. The sound of tinkling can be heard in the room as the trickle splashes into the bowl below. Letting out a whine, she pushes again, her anus pressing outward in vein, not even a small release of air given for her efforts, but the splashing picks up speed and intensity.

"UGHHHHHHHH" she moans loudly in frustration as she waits for her bladder to finish emptying itself. A quick tear of a a few squares of toiler paper, one swipe, one toss, and a flush later, Kiara is left standing and getting her cloths on for dinner.

Popping out of the bathroom, she sees RMT waiting on the couch, watching TV while waiting for her.

"Took you long enough" she says with a smile.

"Yeah yeah, lemmie go toss these into my room quick and we can go to the restaurant" Kiara says holding up her ski cloths while making her way to her room.

The two of them hop back on another shuttle at the edge of the lodging cabin area and ride off together to dinner. They spend a little more time just observing their surroundings and enjoying the scenery instead of talking.

The restaurant is just as themed as everything else in the area, a stunning lodge with plenty of decoration and fanfare. The two of them get led off to their table by their waiter, an older gentleman who's all but happy to talk to them about the various dressing adorning the walls and tables.
After being seated, RMT goes on to tell Kiara about her adventures on the double diamond, the celebrity she met while up there and the two of them share stories about their day when they weren't right next to each other. At one point, Kiara feels another sharp pain in her stomach.

'Ugh, I know I shouldn't do this here, but I have to at least try and help myself along' she thinks to herself as she leans ever so slightly in her chair, one cheek rising off the wood.

A small, soft flex on her abdomen and she feels warm air slowly escape her, passing through her cheeks. A light blush forms on her face, knowing exactly what she's doing in a somewhat crowded restaurant. 'Oh my god, why won't it end!' she thinks silently while nodding to pretend that she's listening to RMT's story she's telling as the fart slips past 8 seconds of non-stop release. Finally, at the ten second mark, she feels her anus close, and she can feel the heat dissipate from her crack.

A wave of nervousness hits her seconds later though, as she breaths through her nose and her senses are met by a strong, tangy smell unmistakable the gas she just release.

'Please, please, please, please no one come over here' she thinks as her eyes dark around the room to make sure no one is headed her way, a nervous sweat almost breaking out on her forehead.

"Mam', did you need more water?"

Turning around, Kiara sees their waiter waiting behind her, a pitcher in hand.

"U-Uh no!" she stutters out, praying that the man would just leave as soon as possible. Watching his facial features, Kiara can tell he most certainly got a whiff of what she was cooking up in her own little corner of embarrassment. Behind the calm face, she could see his eyes shift slightly and look down at her, knowing exactly what happened.

"W-Well, just let me know if you need anything else" the man said losing his composure as he quickly turned to walk away from the stink cloud that was currently hovering around Kiara.

Kiara spent the rest of dinner half-heatedly replying to RMT and couldn't bring herself to ask her waiter for the always loved second desserts, the cloud of embarrassment hanging over her head almost as strongly as the stink that hung in the air from her fart for a minute earlier.
The only positive out of all of this was that Kiara could feel something churning inside her. The medicine along with all of the exercise that day must have done something to help her start shaking the bulk built up inside of her loose. Her mortified ego just wanted to be back at the cabin so she could throw herself into her bed and bury her head in shame while riding out the rest of this constipation episode.

Once the two of them finally got back to the cabin, RMT stopped Kiara before she could dart off to her room.

"What's wrong Kiara? You've been pretty out of it since this afternoon. Are you alright?" her friend asked, concern plastered on her face.

Letting out a sigh, Kiara turned to her "I'm just not feeling that well and it's getting annoying. I don't want it to ruin the rest of the trip and I don't know if I could go to the spa tomorrow if I'm still feeling poorly..."

A smile flashed quickly on RMT's face. "Oh, is that all? Well even if you don't feel well tomorrow and you just have to hang out here, it's no biggy. I won't stay too long at the sauna, and this beats working all the time, so just relax a little and enjoy!"

Kiara gave her a weak smile, feeling a little better about the situation.

"Thanks, I guess it really is no big deal"

"Also, I'm sure you're not the first person to fart at dinner and have the waiter smell it" she replied with a laugh.

Kiara's face instantly lights up at the revelation that RMT could smell it to. "OHHHH MY GOD! I'M JUST GONNA GO BURY MY HEAD IN SHAME NOW! You could smell it too?!"

"Hahaha, seriously Kiara, it's no big deal. It happens sometimes. Just relax, it really doesn't matter"

"Well yeah, maybe not to you, but I subjected that guy to my fart! And it wasn't even just a normal fart at that, it was sooo bad! I'm gonna die of embarrassment!"

"Oh no, a girl farted. Who would have guess that women do that too? Seriously, you're making too big a deal out of it."

Kiara let out an inaudible grumble. "Easy for you to say, you're not the one stinking up the place because you're constipated!"

RMT's laughing died down "Listen, if that's your issue, I'll go back to the restaurant and let you have some alone time so you don't feel as pressured from your embarrassment. They have a themed dance I wanted to check out tonight and I know parties aren't really your thing, so I'll give you a chance to take care of your 'business'," she said using air quotes.

With that Kiara's face got even redder, but she just gave a small nod in affirmation to the plan. A half an hour later, Kiara was left alone in the cabin. About an hour into watching Seinfeld on Netflix, the occasional rub or press on her stomach, and a few hot, semi-wet farts later, Kiara finally felt the telltale pangs in her abdomen. Pressing pause, she popped up out from under the covers she had buried herself in on the couch, along with the most recent gaseous release bittering the air.

*pfft* *pblt* *plbt*

The walk to the bathroom was much noisier than she anticipated, small farts slipping out from between her cheeks with every other steps. She was really glad RMT was nice enough to leave her alone, because she would have died from the embarrassment of all the noise she was making.

Once in the bathroom, she pushed up her shirt revealing the bulge in her stomach from the gas still remaining and the waste just waiting to come out.

"You little shit!" she cursed her stomach as she gave it a playful soft punch

*p-p-pbb-bblltt*

The push caused another much wetter, longer fart to slip through her crack, her cheeks reverberating ever so slightly, the repugnant smell filling the once clean air in the bathroom quickly. With one last look at herself, she moved over to the toilet, popping the lid up before swinging herself around, planting her white cheeks firmly on the seat below, pancaking outward just as they had before, her legs pressing together in an attempt to keep the soon to be smell at bay.

This time though, unbeknownst to herself, Kiara was placed slightly forward on the bowl than she normally would sit, leaving a gap between her tailbone and the seat. Reaching her hands downward, she felt her stomach pains kick in again as she started to rub her abdomen slightly. Leaning forward, she pushed her anus outward.

*BLPPTTTT*

A loud sputtering fart echoing in the bowl was her reward, her anus shrinking back up and inward as her pee trickled out of her into the bowl below. Given that she had drank nothing but water the whole day, and a sizable amount at that, the pee flowing out of her was a pale color, barely changing the color tone of the water in the bowl below.

"Ugh, you stupid little shit" she cursed her body as she applied pressure again, her anus protruding outward slightly again. She could feel things really starting to move, but knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

Keeping up constant pressure between breaths, she could feel the first bit of log turtle-heading out and it pressed through the seal of her anus and pocked outwards to the world outside. Anyone looking at it as it crept its way out an inch would be able to tell how hard and compact it was, very tiny cracks on its dry-looking surface. Kiara being unable to keep up the pressure let go, and her anus retracted, cutting just the smallest bit off the tip, the cracks proving too much to keep it together.

*plop*

The small bit plunked into the water, no bigger than a pebble, and sunk to the bottom of the bowl.

"That's it? All that work for that little bit?!" Kiara shouted after taking a peak through her legs, obviously angry at what little her body could do at the moment.

Leaning forward and increasing the gap on the back of the toilet, she began to push again.

"Herrggg"

The log that had receded back inward trudge back out of her anus, around a half inch showing still looking just as dry and compact as before. With another big push, Kiara could feel the piece slowly working its way out. As it pushed forward, the width kept growing and growing, all the way to 2 and a half inches in diameter, her sphincter being pushed to its limit.

"Oh my god, I think I'm laying an egg!" she said between strained breaths.

With one last hard push, the extremely dense piece moved past its thickest part and quickly exited Kiara, splashing loudly into the bowl below, sending water droplets up onto her butt cheeks and even getting a few drops on the back of the seat through the gap. A sweat had broken out over Kiara's entire body from the exertion.

*huff huff*

Leaning back slightly, Kiara's anus shrunk back into itself, although not as tight as it had been before its intense ordeal. Kiara didn't even want to see what had just come out of her. As impressive as it might have been, the idea of what lay below her scared her just a little and somewhere in her mind, she didn't have the heart to know that she could push out something so grotesque. The bitter stink of a light fart filled the air as the smell from the hard turd she just pushed out finally hit her.

'Honestly, the smell from the restaurant was way worse than this' she thought to herself.

But then, another pang hit her and she doubled over on the seat again, the gap between her tail bone and toilet seat revealing a 6 inch, hard, thick bomb laying in the trap below. A loud, loose fart sounded the start of wave two, as her anus easy spread open to accommodate the small, less dense logs that started to slip out of her. The first one quickly dipped into the water below, no break as it touched her original behemoth and began to curl on itself in the water. From 3 inches, to 6, to 9, to a foot, the quickly sliding log felt like it would never end. Finally, at just a little over a foot and a half, the tail of the log slipped out even quicker than the rest of it had, the smooth log laying coiled on itself and the bomb dropped at the start in the water. Her anus closed on the tail, causing a decent buildup of residue to cling to it.

"Oh my gosh! I don't think I've ever had to go this badly!" she called out. Another pang hit her stomach again signifying it wasn't over yet. "What! Really, there's more?" she cried out loud in an exasperated tone.

With another light push, she felt an extremely soft batch of poop start to push its way out.

*Plip Plop Plop Plop Plip*

Nothing near as solid as the first one or as together as the second one, she started to push out small, mushy pieces that began to pile on the very front of the long snake she released, the bits beginning to pile up to the point they were starting to reach out of the water. At this point, the smaller soft logs really kicked up the scent of poop in the room. As they pushed out, Kiara couldn't help but gag at how strong and overwhelming her dump had become. Soft, semi formed logs turned into loose mush as Kiara's body worked to rid itself of everything she'd been holding for the last 5 days. Each and every piece seemed like it just added some small bit to the layer of filth that was building up around her anus.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, her hole slowly closed on the last piece. The fan in the room did nothing to cut the smell, she doubted an industrial fan could even do it at this point as she tried not to breath too heavily between her panting.
Once Kiara regained her composure, she reached for some toilet paper.

'I know I don't have to clean everything up because I can just take a shower, but I don't want it to be too dirty' she though, pulling of a few squares.
The moment her fingers touched her anus, she regretted the decision and wished she would have just flushed and went straight to the shower. The stinging was unbearable. With just the lightest amount taken off, Kiara threw the piece to the back of the toilet. Slowly standing up onto her shakey legs, she could feel the mess that was left be pressed and spread as her cheeks came together, the sticky residue pushing outward from her anus giving her a very dirty feeling.

Turning around, she looked at what she left in the bowl and her mouth dropped open in shock.

Right below the small piece of paper that was floating a the back end of the toilet was a dark, dense log that had wedged its way into the drain slightly. The hole looked like it just might barely be able to accommodate its girth. A little bit forward in the bowl from the hole, the medium sized, smooth log lay folded and wound over itself, creating a small pile with a single, long, log. On top of and in front of that, the softer pieces piled on each other, and they tumbled forward to the from of the bowl. So much had built up that there was a good half inch of messy, wet poop sticking up above the water.
Kiara held back a scream as her hands ran over her butt, the movement causing the mess in her crack to spread ever so slightly outward and the sticky feeling really sinking in as the cheeks separated from their resting position.

With a shaky hand, Kiara leaned forward, the smell making her dizzy, and pushed the flusher down with a prayer.
Watching, she saw the large, compact log get sucked in a little bit, before immediately jamming leaving just a little bit of the tail showing outside the hole. The rising water whipped the small stuff up to start spinning and lots of small mushy pieces slowly circled the bowl, some of them slightly muddying up the water. The long piece had barely moved, just shifting slightly backward and towards the drain, still coiled up upon itself.
"YOU BIG SHIT! FUCK YOU! STUPIT EGG POOP!" she shouted at the toilet and her poop. Looking around quickly, the only thing she saw next to the toilet was a toilet brush. Panic started to set in as she bent over to check under the sink for one hiding. Anyone behind her would have been treated to a show, her inner cheeks smeared with the residue of what she had dropped just minutes ago, getting messier by the second with her quick movements.
Not even taking time to put on her cloths, she quickly searched the cabin, checking in all the cabinets and even the small cleaners closet in the corner, but she was unable to find a plunger. With a long, drawn out whine, she returned to the bathroom.

Looking at the toilet, she saw the mess waiting for her, the bowl about 3/4ths the way full with water. Only one option left unless she wanted to expose her shame. Grabbing the toilet brush, she leaned over her mess and put it into the bowl. Pressing downward towards the hole, she felt very little resistant until finally reaching the beast. Some small bits that were floating got caught in the bristles on the way down, and once she hit the beast, she started to furiously try and break it apart with the brush. Feeling some mushing under her pressure as the bowl got muddier and muddier, she hoped she was making some headway. After a solid 30 seconds of attacking the poop in the bowl, the water was a dark brown. She pulled out the brush and saw that it was a total casualty. Poop bits stuck all over it, with one of the sections of the long turd embedded into it. She'd have to throw it away before RMT got back, setting it into the holder and dirtying that up as well.

"Please god please god please god" she said repeatedly as her hand shakily reached for the flusher a second time.

Another press down on it, and the sound of water flowing into the bowl could be heard. But Kiara's eye went wide with horror, as the water continued to rise in the bowl, no signs of any of it making it passed the blockage. Crying a little bit to herself, she watched as the water rose all the way to the rim and stopped.

'OH MY GOD THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU' she thought to herself as the dirty water and floating poop stayed in the bowl, albeit barely.
Letting out a soft sob, Kiara resigned herself to having to be majorly humiliated when RMT came back from the party and again majorly humiliated when they had to call the front desk for help tomorrow morning.

Turning on and stepping into the shower, Kiara had one final though.

'I really hope RMT doesn't need to use the toilet when she gets back...'
