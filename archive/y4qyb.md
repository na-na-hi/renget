#Omari - The Truth Curseraw

>"W-what the hell!", a man sitting across from her on the bus yelled while pointing at Mari's quickly bulging underwear, snapping her from her trance and attracting everyone's attention.

>She had been completely enthralled in her book trying to calm her nerves before a job interview, she had forgotten it was past time already.

>This day of all days, she was wearing a short skirt, and due to the amount of "successes" her, um, Sunny's thing was full, stuffed even, and she was already leaking precum.

>"I-I, um..." she hesitated, now well aware all eyes were on her.  A huge mistake.

>Whatever cursed magics at play took affect, Sunny's cock cut straight through her panties at a 90 degree angle, and in a moment decreased to a 45 degree one, dripping precum along the bus seat, floor, and skirt along the way.  It was too late.  This was not going to be pretty.

>All eyes were now on her, she could see and hear every chuckle, sneer, and gasp of horror and disgust from everyone on the bus.

>"I-I-I need to tell you s-something..."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>The last time she felt a swelling like this was at the hospital.  It wouldn't be half a decades worth of repression coating a passed-out and bruised Hero to her and her friends' horror, less than 7 month's worth, but she knew it would attract a horrifying amount of attention towards her.

>She also knew this time the amount of overwhelming ecstasy she was about to experience.

>She knows she should have let it out in small bursts beforehand, but she knew if she kept perfect timing it would never be a problem ever again, although clearly...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!" the man shouted

>"I...I...I..." she said in higher and higher pitch, clenching the bus seat with her hands, nearly cramping her feet while curling her toes in her shoes as Sunny's dick began leaking a small stream of cum down his shaft onto her skirt and the seat.  She was already feeling the months of repression in her body, she just needed to let it out.

>"Y-YOU W-WHA-"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>"I KILLED SUNNYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE~" she screamed, semen rapidly shooting outwards coating and blinding the man and then quickly spurting towards the ceiling as the cock changed to a 15 degree angle, creating a small wave as it did so, firing off like pressurized line break at the roof and splattering the nearby area.

>If her outfit wasn't ruined from the rain already, the blinding pleasure causing her to lean back and hump the air certainly did as the spray moved from the ceiling towards her head and the back window.

>Luckily the stream of cum flooding her sinuses along with the bus driver slamming the breaks knocked her out of her stupor.  She knew she only had a limited time frame to abandon the bus while everyone was in shock before... someone called the police?  Assault her for her horrendous act?  Remember her face?  What's worse, she was in the middle of the city, and Sunny's cock was going to stream for a couple good minutes before it just started dribbling and shrinking for a while and then she was back to her old self.

>Still in mid orgasm and firing with the force not enough to coat the ceiling but still certainly high for what was occurring, much like that of a lower pressure hose with no pinching, she ran to the emergency exit and barreled out the back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Oh no

>When exiting the bus she had accidentally rubbed Sunny's dick against the back door, she couldn't now resist now.

>But she still had to run

>Pedestrians and traffic moved away in horror as a young woman coated in cum sprinted by, one hand firmly grasping and rubbing what appeared to be a massive raging erection shooting out an unnatural steady stream of semen, the other frantically waving and pushing people, a bizarre look of both fear and pleasure combined on her face.

>After what seemed like ages the pleasure finally subsided but she kept running, only stopping for a moment to move Sunny's chub into the top rim of her skirt to both support it and hide it under her shirt, the magic no longer a threat to her clothes, eventually deciding on an alleyway and hiding beside a dumpster.

>Perhaps when her clothes and hair dried she could go out safely and pray she wouldn't be noticed, but it would probably be better to wait until dark.

>She certainly wouldn't be going to that job interview, it'd be sheer luck if she wasn't going to jail

>She cried

>She punched Sunny's cock in frustration repeatedly, knowing full when it disappeared she would still feel the bruises for some time afterwards

>"Why Sunny... I'm... sorry, so...why... why...".

>She knew deep down Sunny was sorry too, she didn't quite know how, or why this was happening in the first place

>She sobbed waiting for nightfall

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>She would never know that not only did she and Hero imagine a faint, single knock come from the toy box in the hole near the tree, but the spirit within the tree did as well, but unlike the two checked on the poor child granting his wish, at least what it thought the scared and confused and broken dying child said in it's fading thoughts, confusing giving Mari his pleasure and letting everyone know until she told everyone what happened rather than his actual wish for the tree spirit to tell Mari that he was alive and he needed her comfort and help from everyone and didn't know what was happening, using the child's soul itself to power the wish and bind it to her.

>She didn't know why, but she did know it would be a few weeks before Sunny would appear in her dreams again, if she dreamed at all during that time.

>She could never remember them clearly, all she knew is that they were vivid and almost like a young boy's fantasy land, and that Sunny was there, a bit of sadness in his eyes and constantly muttering apologizes of some sort even though she didn't think he did anything wrong, not even breaking his violin.
