>Backstory:

Ultra Magnus was the Great Warrior of the Winterstorm Clan of the Frozen Valley. When the Mighty Gods of Avgart laid waste to the lands, the ancestors of his clan gathered in the forgotten Hall of Heroes, a construction made by the Gods to house mortals,their champions and themselves.

With great magic and equipment of legends, the ancestors of Winterstorm survived by pilgriming towards the mighty Hall. Crossing the lands ravaged by the deadly wrath of the Goddess of Plague and Monsters, Radtion, the clan shouldered the hardship using suits of armor worth of legends and giant metal beasts, no longer available to anyone but those who dwell deep enough in the Hall of Heroes.

The clan survived their passing through the lands tainted by the Goddess of Plague, reaching the Hall of Heroes. Yet, no other clan besides theirs had reached it. Nor any of their Gods. The Chief God, God of Light and Fertility, Malch’tal. The Goddess of Winter and Survival, the wife of Malch’tal, Ahena. The God of War, Battle and Nobility, Ramus. No God, not even the Goddess of Plague and Monsters was there. Only them. 

Rallying on the entrance of the Hall, they persisted. Leeching off its heat and substantial supplies, periodically sending supplies like food, and equipment. As if the Gods, at least in spirit, were there for them. Great hardships awaited for the clan, survival was hard as the land failed to bear fruits and only great beasts lurked in the snowy mountains but with the help of the Hall, they persisted, walking on the thin rope between starvation and survival.

The Winterstorm Clan built around the entrance of the Hall of Heroes, a first a camp. After years of cruel winter and punishment, they managed to forge a village. Generations later, the village turned into a town. A town of strong warriors, who adapted themselves to survive in the harsh land they inhabited. Yet after decades, the Hall stopped giving resources, as if sensing the Clan had progressed enough to survive. 

Even without the Hall’s help, the Clan endured. Adapting themselves to hunt down the great beasts of the frozen hell they called home.

It took generations for the Hall of Heroes’ great gates to open for the Winterstorm clan again, the insides of it being dark as the night, a maze of darkness and wonder. With years of exploration, the Clan managed to discover rooms of the Hall filled with ancient equipment and with magic and power beyond mortal’s comprehension. As they venerated the legacy of the Gods, a doubt sprouted in the hearts of many: was it wise to usurp Gods’ legacy? If so, to whom the divine gear should go?

To avoid an era of tyranny and misery, it was decided upon by a council that the mightiest and most noble warrior of the Clan should keep the gear, and decide the right time to use and whom to give it.

The çeader of the Clan was obviously enraged by the decision of the council, tried to make a revolt and overthrow the decision, as well as seizing the equipment in the Hall of Heroes. The warrior chosen to be the overseer of the Hall’s treasures, Ultra Magnus, went to the depths of the Halls with a handful of his chosen and most trusted warriors, taking some of the fabled gear. The leader’s rebellion was squashed, and order reigned as  it always should. 

Generations later. He was the warrior chosen to oversee the Hall of Heroes with duty and wisdom, and so he did. Yet, mere years later the Winterstorm Clan was attacked by people of foreign lands, using strange lightning weapons, in search of a “Military vault Pre-War”. The force and ferocity of the Winterstorm Clan was not enough to contend with the arcane weapons the invaders used. IN a last ditch, he went down the Halls, like the Legendary Ultra Magnus did, adorning one of the God’s Armor to face the invaders as well as taking the ancient spells known as “C-4” and “dynamites”. The voyage down the Hall was treacherous as some areas collapsed, others filled with traps laid by his ancestors.

In the end, only he escaped from the vault, using a God Armor and a relic-sword. His clansmen were killed, or taken to far away lands as the invaders overtook the town. As a last stand and act of spite, with the ancient spells, he exploded his town, and collapsed the entrance of the Hall of Heroes. If his clan couldn’t control it, if his clan was no longer alive, then he would deny the invaders their prize.

Taking the name of the Legendary Warrior Ultra Magnus, he now seeks vengeance against the ones who attacked his clan, determined to hunt them down to the deepest pit of damnation if needed. 

>Personality:

As a person, Ultra Magnus is passionate about combat, his nature as a warrior and the one chosen to oversee the now sealed Hall of Heroes, passionate about living- one never knows when they may fall in combat.
He is an upright man who won’t turn to crime or stealing, even if needed, trying to lead a “righteous life”, as righteous as the waste allows it to be. He wanders the wastes, trying to find a lead about one of his Clansmen that was taken away, if they are still alive, and a clue about the bastards who invaded his home and killed his kin.
Even without any stakes in many conflicts, he will appear and help the side he deems as “righteous” after some time of observation, if he can spare time for it. Taking down threats and “evil” even if he doesn’t get anything out of it.

Attacking “innocents”, the “downtrodden” and children who do not take part in the combat would make him turn sides immediately as long as the other one isn’t as wicked or worse. He has no qualms with slavery, the spoils are for the victors to take, but one should always bear in mind when slaving someone: Slaving a person is a gateway for their loved ones to swear an oath of vengeance against you. Be mindful of the price.

He already wandered the Wastes for three years, going far away from his destroyed homeland, fighting monsters and humans alike, those he considered “evil” in his journey of vengeance.

Outside of combat, he takes time to pray for the food he eats and for the safety of those he mets, everyone needs it in these trying times. Religiously taking time to honor the Gods of his culture, praying to never deviate from his path. He likes to hear the histories of those who wander the wastes and fellow warriors, trying to absorb any teachings and knowledge they can give, as well as giving some of his own knowledge and worldly experience as a payment.

>Sexual Interest:

Homossexuality and bissexuality wasn’t a common sight back in his village, sex being mostly used for reproduction rather than pleasure, in some extreme cases, survival. So sex for sex wasn’t common, much less between those of the same gender, unless it was necessary for their survival. Ultra Magnus was raised in a more traditional family of the Winterstorm Clan, so he has zero sexual interest in other men.

Back in the day, people didn't have too much time in their hands to have sex, making it more of a necessary action rather than one of pleasure. He isn’t averse to casual sex, but it would take lots of convincing, more so due to his quest of vengeance and the possible dangers of leaving his God Armor unattended by too much time. 

Partners are chosen by their valor and strength rather than beauty, so he takes interest in strong warrior women, more so by those with strong muscles and strength. He doesn’t care too much about their external beauty, unless an extreme case like being a bug person or some short of amphibian/fish, seeing a mutant in the same eyes as a normal human. Better if their muscles are big and strong, a sign of health and strength.

If one manages to earn his love, he will passionately defend them, as much as he would defend his clansmen. Although sex (unless convinced) wouldn’t be as often as one would like, he wouldn’t be against morning cuddles or other romantic actions, actively making them, even going as far to not use his God Armor for those occasions, despite the risks.
