Edie was lying on her bed when Faith opened the door. Her eyes were closed, and she had her headphones on. Faith stood on the threshold, wondering how to proceed, but was preempted by Edie removing her headphones and sitting up.
"Okay," she said. "Just so we're clear, I'm not feeling left out or anything. I'm not as eager to get attached as you."
Faith nodded.
Edie took a deep breath, then visibly deflated. She flopped back onto her bed. "Hailey's right. I'm just being childish. I'll get over it."
"I'm sorry for telling him. I didn't think."
"Whatever."
