-> *This is a list of my favorite Sanrio characters. Additionally, I will note my experiences with them and Sanrio as a whole.* <-

-> ![-](https://files.catbox.moe/errqfz.ico) PANDAPPLE. First fave, all-time fave. <-
-> ![-](https://files.catbox.moe/lzwend.ico) *Chi Chai Monchan is my second!* <-
-> *Third place goes to Kabukinyantaro. But, Landry is a fella I think of consistently.* <-
-> ![-](https://files.catbox.moe/z9p8nc.ico) *Out of more mainstream names, I would go with Tuxedo Sam! This is mostly influenced by my watching of some Hello Kitty Fairytale Theater. As a result, I like Catnip too. Gudetama is a runner-up to the popular fave, honestly.* <-

-> *Aggretsuko is probably my favorite show, so, of course, I like Retsuko, the protagonist, a bunch. Yet, my favorite character has to be Shikabane.* <-
-> *I loved the Ringing Bell film, clearly.* <-
-> *I love Jewelpet as well, but there's no way I'll be watching all of it like I did for Aggretsuko! Despite me enjoying most of them a fair amount, I'd say my favorite Jewelpet is Dian*. <-
-> *My Melody and Kuromi were two of my favorites because of Onegai My Melody, but their popularity seemed to shoot up in 2020. The adaptations on shirts, others' interpretations, and my growth as a person have made me like them less, though I still feel rather possessive of Kuromi.* <-
-> *My Sweet Piano, a character I favored at the same times as them, hasn't been soured. Yay.* <-
-> *I'm sure every Sanrio fan has had experiences with Hello Kitty. Behind Aggretsuko as a franchise, I have had a few Hello Kitty things in my life. She never really imprinted on me in spite of that.* <-
-> *I have been a Show by Rock fan for years and somehow I haven't watched it yet. Help. It's on my watchlist ok. Luv Howan*. <-
-> *I like the Beatcats. I am a Chelsea stan.* <-
-> *I would like to watch Caribadix. Fund my Crunchyroll description.* <-
-> ![-](https://files.catbox.moe/usxtfa.ico) *Miscellaneous ones I specifically adore are Mellotune, Corocorokuririn, and Marumofubiyori!* <-
