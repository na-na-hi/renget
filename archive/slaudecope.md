#Coping with Slaude
#### -> Spermack, 3.2k context token, Single and Unfiltered Response from Claude <-
!!! danger Slaude has tigthened filter as of late. You might get 24h ban. Proceed with caution.
!!! info For slowburners: https://rentry.org/hn3bd
***
###Why still Cope with Slaude?
#####Advantages:
- Better in roleplay than Local or Turbo.
#####Disadvantages:
- Low context size. Use character cards with less tokens if you favor more chat memory.
- Short response. It is to ensure that more messages are stored within the low context memory.
- Possibility of getting 24h ban. Create new accounts and switch up your prompts/cards.
***
###Steps:
######1. Install Spermack
https://github.com/AmmoniaM/Spermack
Claude in Threads only stores ~7,500 chars (1.7k tokens) from my testing. Claude in DMs can read up to max message limit (12k chars or 2.7k tokens). In addition, you can increase the message limit to around 13-14k characters since Slack allows leeway in their API message with 1k+ over the message limit.
######2. Modify Spermack
I modified Spermack so that we only need to send one message to Claude DM. This is to ensure that all context within the message are stored. I was able to test by manually sending two messages that add up to 3.7k tokens to Claude and it still remembered context from the first message but I don't know how to make it work consistently through SillyTavern.

**Replace Spermack files with the ff:**
- config.js: https://files.catbox.moe/fhk47m.js
Changes: Basically changed user role to A, assistant role to B, and removed system role. Removed jailbreaks and retries.
- utils.js: https://files.catbox.moe/81ts6m.js
Changes: Removed the split message code so that it forces to send only one message. If there is a blank response from SillyTavern, lower your context size (3,250 context tokens). Automatically removes blank newlines and asterisks to save character space.
######3. Change SillyTavern Settings
XML tags with gaslight will be used to prompt. This is to ensure Claude will respond once and unfiltered by enforcing `<requirements>`, adding `<ban>`, and gaslight prompt at the end. Enable Streaming with Legacy Streaming can be turned on.
