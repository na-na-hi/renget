# RCTA / ECTA Awareness

## -> Intro to RCTA/ECTA - Why I made this <-

RCTA stands for Race Change to Another and ECTA stands for (i believe) Ethnicity Change to Another. I will use them interchangeably as long with sometimes saying "transracial". If they have more in-depth/specific meaning or if I got what ECTA stands for wrong please let me know using my [guestbook](https://bulebrery.123guestbook.com/) or my discord (justblueberry_)!!! PonyTown whispers work as well as just telling me in public chat (though I'd prefer whispers)! Any way you can get to me is nice, so long as I'm not busy.
The RCTA/ECTA community may have disappeared from tiktok but there are most definitely still RCTA people out there. FYI, RCTA/ECTA/Transracial people are NOT accepted into the LGBTQIA+ community, trans people are BORN trans. Being trans is NOT, and I repeat NOT, a decision and being RCTA is most definitely a decision, not something you're born as.
I myself am mixed, irish and puerto rican. I was born this way, I am mixed in real life. I don't want anyone after me trying to be RCTA.

!!! note so i just saw a tiktok posted by an RCTA person for 6 days ago-  date : 8-31-23

## -> What is RCTA/ECTA <-

RCTA or Race Change to Another, is a community that started on tiktok (surprising ik /sar). The somewhat small tight-knit community is a bunch of teenagers (usually teen girls from what I've seen so far) deciding to change from their birth race (usually white) to another (most popular being korean or japanese[?]). I'm sure that no matter what race you are, you can see why this is so problematic. They do seem to have reasons as to why they decided to change their race, usually just being bullied for being basic, they were bored with their own race, they thought culture was cool, etc.. They also claim that people call them slurs, the specific slur they claimed was the word Ranny/Rannie which (on the Merriam-Webster) means "a poor quality calf of mongrel breeding" and on other sites it means shrew, aka the mouse-like animal. There's a few other meanings so I don't know which one for sure but they definitely do claim that it's a slur. Ranny is not a valid slur at all, feel free to use it I guess.
They claim that they're different from transracial people because they "learn" about the culture, but in all reality they go knee deep into the "culture" (aka just the cute stuff) and spread more misinformation about the culture and are trying to be racist caricatures of what their "desired race" actually is.

## -> Why could ECTA people harm the LGBTQ+ <-

A thing about transrace/RCTA people really like comparing themselves to Trans people. Which is not comparable at all. They've also made themselves flags and at some point USED THE MAP FLAG (I'll make another entry in this for "MAPs")
