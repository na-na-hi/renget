Reunion over the fire 
B.O.I. short 1
The campfire felt good after hiking the entire day. Days blended together since you arrived in this strange land. Life was unusual here. Since landing it has become a journey. Avoiding execution was only the start. Making nice with the inhabitants the best you could. They viewed you as a curiosity as much as you did this place. 
Quiet except for the crackling fire. It had been a rough couple nights before you learned how to do this. The work to survive had been rough. It wasn't like you could depend on strangers. A farmer you met initially refused to let you stay. Jack, a beastman hybrid like everyone else you'd met here. As far as you knew you were the only pure human here.
Jack eyed you with mistrust and refused to allow you shelter. Something about running a farm or another. The donkey boy was rough and wouldn't sugarcoat you weren't welcome. Well, that was bullshit. Not like you asked to land here. 
That's why it was surprising to see Jack walking into the light of your campfire. You were about a day from his farm. Last you'd seen him was a month or two ago. "What do you want?" He was curt with you so why shouldn't you be that way back. 
That was the reception he expected. After his behavior leaving such a shitty first impression how could it not? He turned to walk away but hesitated. You noticed his clothes looked more ragged compared to your last encounter. Granted, he was a farmer. They looked worse than that.
He even looked scrawnier. Though that may have been your imagination. It was a very uncomfortable silence as the fire popped. You could see him look down to his hooves. Whatever he was thinking about it weighed on him heavily. "What?" 
That seemed to make his mind up. You saw him retreat from the glow and then vanish. Perhaps you were too harsh. It wasn't until you went into town the next day things became clear. Apparently a huge fire, arson suspected, claimed everything. His farm was his family's. One that seemed to end with him after the loss of his parents. 
So you felt a little guilty. Given how he acted before you were harsh but if you had known things may have been different. You had an idea. Tonight you camped near the farm grounds. Sure enough he came near the fire and he looked disappointed when he saw it was you. No doubt expecting the same cold welcome. 
Instead you patted the ground next to you. The donkey boy hesitated once more. His ears on the top of his head spoke more than his words. They drooped and gave him more of a downtrodden look. Yet he still insisted on his pride. Jack probably felt like a failure but didn't want to admit it. You held off bringing up the subject for fear of making this look like pity.
It wasn't simple as pity. Sure you felt bad for him. Even with how he behaved you didn't wish that on him. You sensed he felt close to how you felt. While no one was hostile to you, you still felt lost here. An alien in an alien land. Jack was stuck in a similar predicament, just thrown into the fire without a choice. 
He finally sat silently next to you and watched the fire. His clothes were burnt. So that's what looked off. When he shivered, your instincts kicked in and you threw your coat over his shoulders. Jack almost spoke to protest but ended up gripping the coat in his hands. 
His ears perked up when you rustled through your bag. You didn't have a lot of food left from before ending up here. However there was beer you'd been saving. Some sort of half hearted celebration for maybe a rescue. Not like you had access to wine. He looked conflicted when you handed him half the beer and some bread. "You need energy."
His stomach seemed to finally make his decision for him. Booze seemed to kick his ass quicker than you expected. Granted he was probably drinking on an empty stomach. Not the wisest decision you could make but oh well. 
Thankfully, he seemed to want to stick around. The buzz seemed to loosen him up. When you laid down on your bedroll he held back a little but the blanket looked inviting. You slept back to back, his body felt petite compared to yours. Your fire died down and you felt his coarse hair on your skin as you felt asleep. 
You had bet he would have slipped out during the night. Maybe even pilfer your pack out of desperation. Instead he was now facing your back and cuddled up to you. His breathing against your back told you he was still asleep. 
He didn't embrace you, which made turning to face him easier. You decided to embrace him. That seemed to be what woke him up. Jack took a second to register what had happened then flew into a panic. The donkey boy kicked out of your grip.
Even in his disheveled state he had a girlish appeal. You could have had worse bunkmates. This land had a few mysteries and one of them was why all the men looked downright feminine. His protests were hushed when you took the lead and kissed him. Both of you were strangers but that didn't have to stay that way. It helped his fighting felt half hearted. Almost like he wanted companionship but still wanted to have his say. If he really wanted out you probably couldn't wrestle him. 
When you pulled him to your chest that must have been when the dam broke. It started small. A sniffle. Soon he was crying against your shirt. He must have been through Hell after losing the farm and you were probably the kindest face he'd seen in all this time. If he even went to anyone else. You held him close and let him release all of it. 
His fur tickled your arms as you let him sob. The donkey boy's body felt so small in your arms. It was obvious he'd carried too much weight on those shoulders. Having to carry on his family's legacy like that alone. Maybe he was in better hands now. You hoped he would stick around and maybe you could help with his family's legacy.
