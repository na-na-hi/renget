"This is stupid", he said to himself, trying to curl dumbbells more suited to a rhino or bull. "Look at them..." he thought, eyeing all the muscled figures in the gym, lifting weights heavier than him with a smile.
“What can I do?” the buck thought, dropping the weights with an audible thud. “Why do I even--”
“Hey, bud.”
The buck startled as he turned to leave, collecting his water bottle and towel. A shark man, hands on hips, stood and looked to be sizing him up with a grin.
“The hell are you doing, if you don’t mind me asking?”, the shark man asked. He stood at a good seven feet tall and it made the buck, only a mere six with antlers cringe in on himself. Bullies, he thought, they just get bigger…
“Lifting”, he said, at length, cool demeanour hiding his anxiety.
“You’re gonna get a hernia or throw your back out like that,” the shark man said, inspecting the dumbbells the buck had dropped.
“The fuck do you care?”, asked the buck, anger and embarrassment seeping through. 
“Woah, easy, didn’t mean to step on your toes or nothin’”, the shark man asked, suddenly defensive and rubbing his neck and looking anywhere that wasn’t at the buck. “Just thought you could use a partner.”
The buck deadpanned, thinking about his sex life, or lack there of, and why this guy cared.
“For the work out. You’re new here, right?”
“Oh,” said the buck, embarrassed by his own thoughts. “Yeah. Uh, sure” He held a trembling hand out, part nerves, part strain from the too-heavy weights. “I’m Dennis.”
The shark brightened and gripped the hand with enthusiastic crushing. “Roy,” he said, flashing all his dangerous teeth. “Alright, let’s get you some weights more your speed…”
The work out lasted a little over an hour, Roy teaching Dennis proper techniques, helping him find what weights he should use, getting reps and sets established, suggesting routines for building strength, the works. The buck listened attentively and followed the shark’s instructions and before he knew it, he was lifting like a pro. He liked to think so, anyway. After the last exercise he was exhausted, but strangely never felt better.
“You did great,” said Roy, handing him a bottle of water. 
“Thanks,” said Dennis, breathing heavily. “Really, thank you, for everything,” he bashfully added and took a few gulps and sat down on the bench.
“No worries,” Roy said and sat down beside him. “I like helping newbies when I can. I know it can all be intimidating at the start. Didn’t want to see you give up before you got going.”
“I wasn’t gonna give--” Dennis started, but he didn’t feel like lying to the helpful shark man. “Okay, maybe I was,” he admitted and took another drink, looking away. He capped the bottle and looked down at his feet. “I’m not great at the whole confidence thing, sue me.”
Roy frowned at the dejected buck and scratched his cheek. “I used to be skinnier than you, believe it or not.”
Dennis’s eyes snapped back to his impromptu coach, disbelief evident on his face. “No way.”
“Yep,” Roy said, smiling sheepishly. “Real scrawny. My brother actually got me into lifting. You should see him, he’s huge!” the shark threw his arms to the side to imitate the size of his brother and Dennis struggled to imagine an even bigger Roy. “I was terrified to start, almost gave up myself. Didn’t think I could do it, convinced I was just making a fool out of myself. But Rob showed me the ropes, wouldn’t let me quit. And when I didn’t, I was hooked.”
“Rob?” the buck asked.
“Oh, my brother.”
“Ah. Heh, hard to imagine you as all skin and bones like me.”
“Yep. Not that you look bad or anything. You’re hot as hell as is.” Roy’s face dropped when he realised what he said and the stunned buck stared back at him for an awkward moment. “Well!” shouted Roy and shot up. “Time for a shower good work out I’ll see you around Dennis and remember not to hyperextend and make sure--” Roy rambled as he walked off before he was out of ear shot, earning a few odd stares from the other gym-goers. 
Dennis watched him go, mouth hanging open slightly, trying to process what he just heard. Roy called him hot. The big, well-muscled, charming, helpful shark guy called him hot. Dennis would be lying if he said he didn’t reciprocate the attraction. He stole glances at Roy as the lifting pro demonstrated exercises, noticing how his shorts stretched across his muscular ass, how the tank top that was basically just two bits of thread connected to some fabric did nothing to hide his slab-like pectorals or chiselled abs, how he could effortlessly pick Dennis up with just one of those massive arms… Dennis didn’t stare too long as he didn’t want to explain any sudden erections, but still, he couldn’t stop checking Roy out. And every time he did he internally berated himself. “No way he’s into guys,” he thought, “and even if he was he’s way out of my league. No chance. Stop being dumb and horny.”
Seems he was wrong. Any other day, the buck probably would have just gotten flustered and went home and jerked off. But he was feeling particularly confident today, thanks in no small part to Roy.  Standing, he decided it would be ungrateful to not show the hunky shark man his appreciation. 

Peeking into the shower, Dennis saw that every stall was empty except for the one at the end of the room, the water flowing from the shower head and steam pouring out from behind the partition. Not much privacy, the buck thought, but it’ll do. He gently padded in, not wanting to ruin the surprise, and stripped out of his clothes, pulling off his trainers and his sweat dampened shirt and shorts, followed by his socks and finally boxers. 
As he deposited them on the bench, his ears perked up when he heard soft muttering. He carefully moved closer and the words became clearer. “What was I thinking?” he heard Roy say to himself. “Real smooth, you dick.” Dennis stopped on the other side of the partition and listened to the shark admonish himself. “Probably scared him off. Great. Probably won’t even come back, knowing that some creepy gay guy is going to be perving on him. He wouldn’t even be wrong. God, I suck…” Dennis frowned, thinking Roy sounded a lot like himself when he was being his own toughest critic. He didn’t want to hear somebody like Roy talk about himself like that. Time to give him a little “pep talk”, he thought.
“Guess I’ll just die alone,” Roy said and sighed, standing under the water with his head hanging down, not even bothering to wash. 
“Being a little dramatic, don’t you think?” Dennis said from behind him, hands on his hips, trying his best to be smooth.
“Ah!” Roy screamed in a too high voice and spun around with his arms raised. “D-Dennis!? What are-- I mean, what, uh… h-how long have you been standing there?” Roy suddenly remembered his nudity and his hands shot down to cover his crotch, Dennis catching a quick glimpse of the slit there.
“Long enough to think you’re being a too harsh on yourself.” 
“I-- shit, I was…” Roy stuttered and looked away, embarrassed.
“Easy, big guy,” Dennis said and moved closer and put his hands on the shark man’s impressive chest, his heart hammering away in his own. “Deep breath.”
Roy looked down to where Dennis’s hands were then back to his eyes and inhaled and exhaled deeply. 
“Better?” Dennis said and smiled.
“Yeah,” Roy said and smiled awkwardly back.
“So, think I’m hot, huh?” the buck said, laying on the charm as thick as he could, despite his own nervousness. 
“Oh. Uh, yeah,” Roy said, rubbing his neck. “Like, smokin’.”
“Got nothing on you. They could put you on the sign out front and run all the other gyms in the city out of business overnight.”
“Pfff,” the shark snorted and chuckled. “Think my toothy mug might scare away all the customers.”
“Fuck ‘em, more for me then,” Dennis retorted and stood closer until their bodies were pressed together. He craned his neck to look up at the fidgeting hunk.
“Uh… here? Really?” asked Roy, surprised.
“What, sharks don’t like water?” Dennis said with a smirk. Seeing this giant being made so flustered and anxious by him and shifted his usually fragile confidence into overdrive. 
“Heh, like something else even more,” Roy said and wrapped his arms around the buck. He leaned down and brought his mouth to Dennis’s for a kiss, being extra careful with his teeth. Dennis moaned in response, letting Roy’s tongue in to greet his own. He felt positively dwarfed by the shark, his own lean body being enveloped in Roy’s bulk and muscle as the shark’s hands roamed across his thin back. It made him a little nervous, but excited, knowing that he could tell this massive predator to get on his knees and he would oblige. Luckily for Roy, Dennis had other ideas. 
They broke the kiss and panted slightly. Roy felt something press against his thigh and looked down to see Dennis’s dick at full mast. Decently lengthy, but not too thick, suiting the rest of him well.
“Somebody’s excited,” Roy teased.
“Can’t help it,” Dennis said, a little embarrassed by his eagerness, “didn’t know sharks were such good kissers.”
“Guess most folk are afraid to try,” Roy said, flattered.
“Good thing you taught me to go for it instead of wussing out,” Dennis said and reached around to squeeze Roy’s ass cheeks, making the larger man jump slightly. “So let me thank you properly…” Dennis slid out of Roy’s grip and down to his knees, bringing his face to be level with the other’s crotch. He rested his hands against Roy’s thick thighs and inspected the slit in front of him. “Huh,” he said, having never seen one himself and not really knowing anything about shark anatomy.
“It’s, uh, not too weird or anything, right?” asked Roy, noticing the buck’s curiosity.
“’Course not, nothing weird at all,” Dennis said, looking up with a reassuring smile.
“Wouldn’t say that so soon, if I were you…” Roy muttered while Dennis leaned in to give the slit an inquisitive lick, making the big man shudder.
“Tastes like fish,” the buck joked.
“Hilarious,” Roy said sarcastically.
“Heh, sorry,” Dennis placated and gave the slit several longer licks, making the shark’s breath hitch between moans. Spurned on by Roy’s reaction, Dennis pressed his tongue into the hole and felt something hard inside almost immediately.
“Fuuuuck,” Roy breathed. Dennis knew it was Roy’s internal dick he was feeling, so he slathered his tongue over the head, eager to bring it out. Sure enough, it began pressing his tongue out and was soon spreading the slit apart.
“Brace yourself,” said Roy and Dennis watched in surprise as the dick emerged. Both of them.
“Oh, wow,” Dennis said in surprise, gawking at the other man’s dual junk. 
“Told you,” Roy said, a little self-conscious. “Not a problem… is it?” Dennis grabbed both thick appendages and felt how hot and smooth they were, completely different from the rest of Roy’s rough flesh. Both were moist from the shark’s internal fluids and he found himself salivating.
“Two for one? You’re spoiling me, Roy,” Dennis reassured him as he gave the two erections exploratory touches. Dennis relaxed despite the occasional spasms from the soft touches.
“Mmf, glad you like ‘em.”
“Jeeze, how do you even fit them in there?”
“Heh, it’s a little snug but comfy eno-ooooh, fuck,” Roy moaned as Dennis dragged his tongue along one dick while gently pumping the other. He took into his mouth as far as he good, careful not to make himself gag. The taste was strange, but not bad, and the smell was incredible. He couldn’t describe it as anything but “masculine.” They radiated heat that made even the hot water from the shower feel tepid. Pre was dribbling constantly from the tip in his mouth, mixing with saliva and coating his tongue. Dennis moaned so Roy could feel the vibrations. He chanced a look upwards and saw Roy with his mouth open, breathing heavily and looking back at him with half-lidded eyes. He began to suck more eagerly and pumped the other more enthusiastically, his own erection throbbing between his legs. 
“Shit, ah, Dennis…” Roy said, hands balled into fists at his side, feeling his climax building. Roy swirled his tongue around the tip before deepthroating, congratulating himself on controlling his gag reflex. Roy’s moans and whines picked up in volume and the buck was sure people outside could hear them. The shark began thrusting into his face, desperate to get off. 
Dennis doubled his efforts and earned even more lustful sounds from the bigger man. Curiosity got the better of the buck and with his free hand he slid two fingers into the slit, under the cocks. “Hah, f-fuck!” Roy roared and grabbed Dennis’s antlers in his hands and drove his dick in as far as it would go and unloaded. One dick pumped jizz right down the buck’s throat while the other coated his head and face faster than the water could wash it away. Dennis swallowed again and again, surprised by the quantity. 
Finally the orgasm died down along with Roy’s groans. He released the buck’s head who slid his mouth slowly off the already retracting cock. He swallowed the last of it and sighed before giving the other one a teasing lick and releasing it, making the oversensitive shark spasm. He licked his lips and smiled up at his exhausted partner.
“Dang, Roy. Been a while, huh?” he said and began to stand, Roy immediately reaching out to help him up.
“Nah, jacked off this morning.”
“Holy shit,” Dennis said in disbelief. “Good thing, I guess, otherwise I’d have drowned.”
“Don’t worry, I know CPR,” Roy said and leaned down to kiss Dennis, tasting himself in the process. He broke the kiss and they grinned at each other, both blushing. Roy noticed the mess he’d made over Dennis and felt a little guilty. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”

After the shower, they both got dressed and chatted. Once clothed, the conversation died down and they looked at each other expectantly.  Roy fidgeted and asked, “So, you’ll be back?”
“Of course. Gonna get a year’s membership, actually,” Dennis said, watching the shark brighten up immediately. 
“Really? That’s great!”
“What can I say, you made a hell of a sale’s pitch,” Dennis teased and Roy rubbed his neck, a little embarrassed. “Really though, thanks for all your help,” the buck said, taking his own turn to feel embarrassed. “Promise to keep coaching me?” 
Roy's expression grew serious. “Well, alright, but it won’t be free,” Roy said and crossed his arms. Dennis’s face fell a bit.
“Oh. How much?”
“Dinner with me?” the shark said, relief washing over Dennis even as his heart beat faster.
“Sold.”
