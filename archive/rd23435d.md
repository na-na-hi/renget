>your party's efforts to salvage the airship were fruitful
>Amy tagged along and that actually seemed to keep Sonic at bay a little
>you didn't know if it was out of courtesy or if he was still scared of her
>either way he was affectionate but not too affectionate
>you'd found a way to calm his ass down
>turned out it was women
>sounded obvious when you thought about it
>still didn't stop him when you had a second of privacy
>the blowjobs got a lot faster and more covert
>if anything the short windows of privacy made him absolutely desperate to make you cum
>he wasn't even worrying about his own orgasms
>he'd put his speed to a new use draining your balls as fast as he could
>then pretending he wasn't just gagging on you a second later
>but those times were rare
>Amy wasn't clinging around out anything but she was just kind of hanging out
>Tails had gotten used to her quicker than Sonic did
>she actually started striking a friendship with the fox
>the fox was honestly the only reason Sonic was getting lucky
>he was the best wingman the hedgehog could ask for, often asking Amy for help about 100 feet away from you two
>Sonic occasionally acted cordial and repaid the favor, distracting Amy long enough for Tails to have privacy with you
>they were double teaming you but planning it out
>Amy was a nice girl though
>you related with her given similar backgrounds with Sonic
>eventually she grew comfortable with the idea of Sonic being with someone else
>she figured out you and Tails were a thing quickly enough too
>probably smelled it on him
>you wondered if she knew you three were fucking around the second you could get the chance
>she might have been too polite to say
>you all had decided to stay on this island for now
>the airship made it obvious Robotnik felt the place was important
>you all camped on the beach, using the airship as shelter from the occasional rainstorm 
>nothing had popped up since that ship attack
>but Tails did find more information off the computers
>that rogue robot was in the data 
>helped clear its name
>Gamma
>Robotnik had a whole series of them too
>but this one was marked as a threat 
>whatever Robotnik had planned involved the chaos emeralds and that slime monster
>Tails came up the idea they'd link up with Knuckles
>Sonic wasn't sure he'd work with you all but Amy and you didn't have an opinion either way
>it would be the first time you'd seen this Knuckles
>from how the other two boys talked, he was super strong
>and possibly grumpy 
>so it was a coin flip if he'd work with you
>however, if anyone would have a chaos emerald on the island it would be him
>one night the two boys were busy working on a radar for the emeralds 
>well, Tails was doing the technical work
>Sonic was occasionally watching over his shoulder and asking questions
>he took the jargon easily
>the airship had been turned into an improvised workshop
>something good came from Robotnik's inventions at least
>you'd use the radar and hopefully Knuckles would help if you found him
>you didn't know what the fuck echidnas were
>you relaxed on another side of the ship, up against a steel wall
>place was a probably a little menacing when it was airborne
>now it was just another wreck
>”so… both of them?”
>you shot up and saw Amy
>she sat down next to you
>while she had been accepting of your relationship, she hadn't talked much about it
>her tone wasn't accusatory or angry
>just very nonchalant 
>but also with a trace of underlying curiosity 
>so you let your guard down
>not a lot of people to talk about this stuff with anyways
>you apologized a little for not being up front about the both of them and she stopped you
>”it's not a big deal.”
>it was strange at first, you started to say
>Sonic was kind of an impulse thing that happened in your world
>he was bustling with curiosity about earth
>humans like you
>”so, earth is a lot different?”
>you described station square but worldwide
>humans were pretty much it on your side of the cosmic pond
>”so it's not usual for humans to well…”
>she finished the sentence with a gesture towards the room Tails and Sonic were in 
>well humans didn't have options
>we were it
>this world was an anomaly, but a welcome one
>you were curious where this would go
>you let her keep going 
>yeah Sonic was just a really sudden surprise to you
>you didn't even know you were into him at first, the whole situation was bizarre
>maybe even more bizarre than the little harem you had going on now
>”and they're OK with it?”
>again, she was curious
>you'd entertain her
>yeah, they sort of made a little pact to share you
>but you wanted to make sure there was no hard feelings between them
>you didn't feel right spilling the confession Tails had about his buddy though
>he poured his little fox heart out to you and that would be a betrayal of trust in your eyes
>but both of them were happy to share 
>”and is it… romantic?”
>well, it was a little different for guys
>maybe? 
>you couldn't lie and say you hadn't been strung along by your libido at first
>but a lot of emotions had surfaced spending time with them
>legit love, strange as it was, blossomed between you and those two
>you cared about them and they cared about you
>that was why the threesome thing worked honestly
>you had the feeling there was concern between all three of you for the others 
>hell, you originally felt like you were intruding on them when you three first well…
>”but I'm guessing it was a success? judging by how much they share you.”
>you could definitely call it that
>she grinned and looked towards the other room
>you weren't exactly one to kiss and tell and you said as much
>”oh come on. I've seen how Sonic dresses around you. he definitely wasn't doing that for me.”
>so he was different before?
>”a little. he definitely didn't have a skimpier wardrobe than me.”
>she sighed 
>”I guess that made accepting things a little easier. I mean it's obvious he's infatuated with you.”
>she hugged her knees to herself
>normally a confession like that might sound defeatist, even depressed
>but the soft grin hadn't left her face
>”so are all the guys on earth like you?”
>it was your turn to be curious
>like you? 
>”would there be someone over there into girl hedgehogs?”
>oh
>ohhhhh
>so that's what all this was about
>you almost laughed but realized how rude that would come off 
>of course
>hell, she might meet someone in the city 
>might save a cross dimension trip
>humans here weren't any different than over there
>that idea hadn't occurred to her
>with how hectic things had been she'd never even considered the option
>you really weren't certain if getting home was easy
>you hadn't exactly been worried about it
>but everything involved with your trips had been a complete fluke
>you'd help her with dating a human if she wanted either way
>she looked relieved by that
>you held off suggesting Sonic give her advice
>she might attract a whole different kind of attention with whatever he'd have in mind
>the vibe was a lot more informal after that
>she'd probably been working up the courage to talk about this and since it was out in the open now she was relaxed
>you were on friendly terms before
>now you felt like she saw you as a friend
>you'd graduated a little
>or at least a wingman
>she confessed she kind of felt silly chasing after the blue hedgehog now
>”I guess in hindsight it should have been obvious I wasn't his type”
>she almost sounded defeated but she accepted it
>it's not like she could force him to like vagina or something
>and it was best to pull the bandaid off now instead of years down the line
>so you sort of spared her a lot of ugliness
>she could see that now
>while before you'd worried about her a little now she was someone to confide in
>you hadn't talked this openly about relationships with anyone but the two you'd fuck all the time
>”so why do you all sneak around?”
>you asked her to clarify 
>she giggled, covering her mouth to shush herself
>”you don't think i notice you and Sonic sweaty after Tails asks for my help finding a bolt?”
>well she had a point
>you did say you three were trying to be on good behavior around company
>it's normally a lot more…
>”promiscuous?”
>yeah
>”well don't hold back on my account.”
>she leaned against the wall
>”I've got my closure. if you're worried about me, you've got my blessing.”
>things had been complicated for a while and she had to do some soul searching
>but Sonic was enjoying himself, you weren't a bad guy and she was more than ready to move on
>her crush was just a crush and it wasn't reciprocated
>so she was closing the door on that and looking forward to the future
>”just between us girls,” she joked, “how is he?”
>well… you really weren't a kiss and tell type
>”do you really think your boyfriend will be embarassed?”
>ok
>very fair point
>shame wasn't exactly the strong suit of a guy who more than once wore a thong openly around you
>you did point out he'd been on his best behavior around you
>sort of
>about the closest to chastity since you met him
>but fine
>both of them could be a handful
>but they really enjoyed what you brought to the table
>so to speak
>”I'm going out on a limb and guessing you're in charge”
>it was light hearted jab and you were glad she was able to joke about such things now
>well that would be accurate
>Sonic could be kind of bratty and usually his confidence would melt away after a few rounds
>”rounds?”
>yeah, he was usually like 6 or 7 orgasms to your 1 
>one average
>”humans can do that?”
>she exclaimed in sort of a whisper, realizing before she asked how loud she might be
>well, you didn't know about all humans but yeah 
>you figured yourself to be the average
>she wanted to confirm again the people in Station Square were identical with earthlings
>as far as you knew 1:1
>”and Tails?”
>total sweetheart
>Sonic had his affectionate side too but Tails was so shy and reserved 
>they really complimented each other
>about as well as they did out in the field 
>together they were enough to exhaust the hell out of you
>”and you said it's romantic?”
>it would get pretty dull if there wasn't emotion behind it
>”alright, I want some details”
>you were surprised she was this enthusiastic about gay guys
>the pink hedgehog shrugged
>she admitted seeing guy on guy stuff wasn't exactly the worst thing ever
>oh God she was a yaoi fangirl
>or whatever the equivalent was over here
>she prodded your arm
>”spill it”
>she was smiling
>well if there wasn't a bigger sign she was over her crush it was asking his boyfriend about how he gets fucked
>well, if she was sure she wanted to hear
>you looked towards the room the boys were in
>there would be details you would omit but you decided to roll with it
>stretching your legs felt like a good idea so you got up and paced a little, trying to brainstorm just how much to say
>might be good someone else knows about your relationship 
>that was what you reasoned
>you didn't tell her about your first time with either of them
>those felt very special 
>not the other times weren't special
>but your first times with the boyfriends felt… sacred somehow
>hard to figure out how to phrase it
>you were unaccustomed to boasting about such things
>and you'd come up with something to say then stop yourself 
>more than a couple times
>you paced as you stumbled over an satisfactory explanation 
>a voice to your left interrupted your musing
>”did you hear that Tails, he does care.”
>Sonic had one leg raised behind him, his hands locked together in front of him 
>he went for a mocking “awww” as he leaned his head to one side
>fluttering his eyelashes 
>goddammit 
>the fox boy behind him buried his face in his hands as it hit him what you were explaining to Amy
>ok how long had they been standing there?
>”not long,” Amy replied, “but long enough to hear.”
>perfect
>well at least Sonic and Amy seemed to agree trolling you was hilarious
>you pinched the bridge of your nose and hoped the situation would go away when you reopened your eyes
>nope
>Tails was trying to hide his shame and sit in the corner
>absolutely refusing to meet anyone's gaze, yet in no rush to leave
>Sonic was now leaning against the wall next to Amy
>cool as can be with his hands in his shirt pockets and flashing a grin like it just came naturally to him
>Amy was now leaning forward from her sitting position, hoping for story time to continue
>you wished she would just heave a hammer at you instead 
>while you'd been sort of confident before, that wavered
>you tried to come up with an out
>”bit rude to keep the girl waiting”
>dammit
>Sonic went from fearing her to working with her just like that
>meanwhile, a certain fox busied himself with his gadget
>he made sure to turn away from you
>but every time you went to speak his ears flicked
>he was listening even if he was hiding it
>yeah at this point you figured Amy harbored no hard feelings
>you had no allies here
>scowling at Sonic only earned you a laugh from the blue hedgehog 
>”he's probably thinking about punishing me right now”
>Amy looked to him
>Sonic shrugged
>”might involve Tails and me in maid outfits judging by his tastes”
>Tails immediately fumbled the screwdriver in his hand like it was covered in butter
>this party had become a 2v1 and a clumsy fox
>Amy was curious and only encouraged Sonic’s teasing more
>the glare you delivered to the blue hedgehog promised him he wasn't sitting for a week
>he was dead set on earning that and then he brought your internet search history that led to all this
>he wasn't running straight for a month
>ha
>straight
>so the worst happened and Amy went over your head and asked Sonic directly
>you missed when they were hostile to each other
>but you wanted everyone to get along
>well you were reaping what you sowed
>she asked what he meant by search history
>”have your heard the term… ‘buttslut’”
>you crossed the room with speed that would rival his
>nope
>this wasn't continuing 
>he laughed, knowing he got a rise out of you
>you stopped
>he wanted to get punished
>experience cooled your reaction
>that's how it was going to be
>he'd tease you and you'd full nelson fuck him until his legs wouldn't work
>so you'd be playing right into his clever scheme
>diabolical 
>you took a deep breath
>you were the boss here
>you would be the mature adult
>he looked a little disappointed and you thought “good”
>if he could be a tease, so could you
>the buttslut thing wouldn't work again
>nope
>he snatched your phone and showed Amy 
>you genuinely hated his super speed sometimes
>sure enough, that picture of his blowjob behind the Tornado 
>Amy was not offended
>she spared a glance at your crotch
>”so are humans just that… big?”
>”very”
>to be fair, at least he just showed something of his
>no teasing the fox
>not like he was particularly photogenic with your dick in his mouth
>unlike some hedgehogs
>well you'd gotten Sonic over his stalker
>but at what cost?
>at what cost?
>he allowed you to snatched back the phone 
>his point made
>that was sort of your fault for still having that picture on your phone but… come on
>why delete it
>so
>since she knew now you could carry on
>right?
>”oh he loves us. it's cute when he gets all grumpy”
>he hooked a thumb over to Tails
>”you should see him with Tails. perfect gentleman.”
>once more the fox fumbled with his gizmo
>your hand went for his mouth
>he needed shushing
>instead he sped around you and was piggyback on you before you could react
>he peeked over your shoulder
>”see, he went and defended Tails' honor and everything”
>he wasn't expecting the kiss
>climbing off the ground meant he couldn't just run
>you'd grabbed his head and planted a deep crushing kiss on him
>shoving your tongue into his mouth, your hand tightly gripping the back of his head
>you had him at your mercy
>then pulled back
>well, that took some sass out of him
>he actually didn't know how to react
>you were a little worried about Amy's reaction but when you looked to her she had a grin on her face
>her eyes went to the shocked hedgehog
>you could tell she was thinking
>maybe getting her own human
>thankfully she didn't look angry or upset in any regard
>well at least she seemed over it
>you weren't so debauched you planned to go further in front of her
>Sonic might be tempted
>but that still felt a little strange
>the kiss bought you a few precious moments of silence before he spoke up again
>”well, he's… impulsive too.”
>pot meet kettle
>he hopped off your back and uncharacteristically tried to keep his erection concealed 
>just had something interesting to talk about in the other direction
>the shoe was on the other foot now and it wasn't every day you got to see him bashful
>he wasn't beating Tails in a blush off but it was still evident you'd caught him completely off guard with that kiss
>good
>he cleared his throat and he was back
>the rare instance of embarrassment was fleeting
>still funny
>but fine
>the cat was out of the bag
>it was awkward at first but you three had made it work
>you told the truth about your initial worries as you leaned back against a server tower the size of a fridge
>but it had more than worked out
>you were actually glad you came here
>despite all the danger it had been worth it
>out of the corner of your eye you noticed Tails relax and turn back towards you all
>since the topic wasn't completely centered on his prostate orgasms now, he was content to participate 
>things had just clicked
>it was hard to explain
>you were obviously into guys
>Sonic had made that abundantly clear to Amy
>you had a type
>this time it was your turn to hook a thumb to the hedgehog in the swimsuit
>so he wasn't wrong
>you more than enjoyed their company
>the truth was you didn't feel the need to go back to earth again after meeting these guys
>and yes, it could be romantic
>you didn't know how much was appropriate for her but you did remark you got even Sonic to melt a little
>the initial start of things was sex, and you were honest about that
>but traveling with these two it became deeper than that
>and you wouldn't change that for the world
>if Amy wanted help getting a human guy you'd help
>you turned your head to Sonic and he was a little stunned you just cut to the chase like that
>you shrugged
>fucking him in a dirty cheap hotel was the best decision you made
>the confidence returned to him when you put it like that and he turned back to the pink hedgehog that looked to him intently
>”after we deal with Robotnik, we'll go cruising over in the city”
>”deal”
>you went to sit near Tails while he worked and the two hedgehogs bonded over boys
>getting the fox in a jargon speaking mood had him pulling a 180 to the earlier gremlin attempting to melt into the metal frame of the ship with how much he blushed
>so this little portable device was a radar
>shaped like an old pocket watch
>a green grid on the screen lit up
>Tails quickly explained it would track the faint energy signature the emeralds gave off 
>the previous four had helped fine tune it
>one or two would no doubt be with Knuckles 
>maybe all three if you got really lucky
>speaking of, Sonic and Amy definitely looked to be on friendly terms
>it probably stung less knowing he wasn't into her because he wasn't into women
>not like she could force him to like vagina
>you felt like she definitely had a human thing going on now too
>getting her a date couldn't be any harder than saving the world 
>plus, someone in the city might have an easier time with these anthro people than you did
>weird to think that was a reservation at one point
>when Sonic and Amy started whispering to each other you knew you'd regret trying to patch things up
>well at least she had friends now and had mellowed the fuck out
>Tails was finished calibrating the radar and the island was shown off
>he tapped a button on the side and four dots lit up
>one off the coast and two on land
>the last dot was your spot 
>it was hard to believe these gems were that powerful
>but hopefully once you gathered all seven something good would happen
>there was no time like the present and the sooner they were in safe hands the better
>Robotnik was probably out there thinking the same thing
>the urge to split up was strong but Sonic decided against it
>strength in numbers was the game now
>you noticed neither he nor Tails objected any more to you coming with them 
>getting the one off the coast might be prudent
>the two seemed confident this Knuckles could handle himself if he found one
>high praise but you trusted their judgement
>the phrase “too dumb to quit fighting” wasn't exactly the best praise but Sonic did say it half joking 
>taking the Tornado without a guaranteed landing spot seemed like a bad idea
>Tails made a note to himself once more to work on a seaplane conversion 
>he always did get excited at further ideas of making the plane transformable 
>if anyone for do that it would be him
>you left the airship at a brisk pace, Sonic dashing ahead to scout it out
>within the day you'd pushed and gotten across the island 
>Sonic kept running the beach, looking for trouble but eventually got bored and hung back with you all
>he didn't see any threat and the patrolling was dull
>that was fine
>hugging the beach made it easy and it thankfully wasn't on the wrong side of the island
>Tails would click the radar and it got closer and closer
>the sun was going to go down in an hour or so by the time you got there
>you all thought you were alone until you saw a fat purple cat just… fishing?
>with a frog perched on his head
>well whatever
>not the weirdest thing you'd seen
>you paid him no mind and hit up the radar again
>it was out there
>you volunteered to dive for it
>Sonic did point out he was wearing a swimsuit
>but you wanted to be useful
>Tails would flu out to where it was as a guide
>Amy elected to help search below
>Sonic was best above the water 
>made sense
>but didn't help with his boredom
>the water was nice at least
>you tossed your shoes and socks on the beach and started wading out
>Amy followed suit
>shame Tails couldn't have rigged up some sort of submarine on short notice
>Sonic decided to chill on the beach but kept an eye out for you all
>that cat just did his own thing
>you just let him fish
>time was of the essence before the night made diving impossible 
>Tails flew out but it didn't look that far
>hopefully it was just laying in some reef
>you rushed over to the location with Amy in tow
>you were glad Sonic and Tails finally let you help a little
>it just made sense for them to be available in case trouble came
>Amy might be a help to 
>you took a deep breath and dived into the tropical waters
>camping out on the beach tonight was probably going to happen
>the sooner you found the gem the better though
>you hoped there was a reef or something 
>you knew what to look for at least
>it was funny
>here you were, on an adventure all because you got lucky and met Sonic
>you wouldn't change this for the world 
>so no way was Robotnik ruining this planet for your boys
>you were invested in protecting them as much as they were in protecting you 
>Amy and you would scan the sandy ocean floor for a bit then surface
>it went on like this for a while 
>Amy was the one to spot it first
>she pointed towards a small alcove with a twinkling light
>the sun from above had caught a red gem
>that had to be it
>you both made a beeline for it and you let Amy grab it and head for the surface immediately 
>the sun was vanishing over the horizon and with it the light
>Amy was excited as she swam to shore
>five emeralds down
>thank God that cat had packed up his rod and left
>the night would be a little uncomfortable on the beach but you weren't going through the jungles at night
>Sonic and Tails were on the shore waiting for you
>a camp out didn't sound too bad
>feeling the warm dry sand under your feet was nice
>you wondered if all land on this planet was comparable to a tropical resort
>people paid obscene amounts of money to go to Hawaii when you had this for free
>beautiful 
>the sun was just going down and you took the time to watch it
>without that light filtered into the water, Amy wouldn't have caught that sparkle
>you were blessed
>Sonic had gathered sticks and leaves for a fire
>these cookouts had become the go to on the island now
>staying in Station Square was an option but you felt guilty imposing like that indefinitely 
>you supply of rations was getting sparse though
>maybe a visit would be in order
>you hoped it wouldn't come to that
>things had slipped into a nice comfortable lull
>you'd brought a change of clothes and let your wet ones dry on a tree branch
>Sonic gave Amy one of his outfits
>Tails took his time recalibrating the radar and making sure everything was working
>the blips were still there
>and the one out in the ocean was gone, collected like the others
>you were going to need a case for these things soon
>but for now the pack you had would do
>you thanked Amy 
>traveling together had worked out, despite the embarrassment earlier
>you mused about how one of Sonic's outfits looked more revealing on her than her usual clothes
>he really did dress skanky when he wanted to 
>you'd be the last one to complain about that though
>that night you slept like a baby
>it came easily to you after the trip across the island
>your pack for your pillow and the two boys on your side
>in the middle of the night you awoke to a hand down your pants
>you almost sat up until a voice whispered in your ear
>”don't spoil the fun”
>that was definitely Sonic's voice
>he was softly gasping against your neck
>you turned to face him and looked down
>Tails was jerking him off 
>and he, in turn was softly stroking you to hardness
>the fox was fucking his own hand too
>the whole thing was frantic but quiet
>all three of you tried to keep your voices down
>Sonic freed your cock and ran a soft hand over the tip
>”Tails got horny and decided to whip it out. don't know why but not complaining.”
>with all three of you rock hard you got an idea
>peeking over, you made sure Amy was asleep
>thank God
>you picked yourself up and pinned them both
>untangling them was awkward but you did it
>they were facing each other now, with your body on top
>you kissed and frotted both of them
>all three of you tried to be dead silent but there was only so much you could do
>both the boys stroked and worked your three cocks together
>you worked your hips, rubbing against their own manhoods
>the urge to just sink it in was strong
>but you didn't want to lose control of your inhibitions and wake up the girl sleeping feet away
>your hands gripped fistfuls of sand as you felt them work together 
>kisses were quiet and affectionate
