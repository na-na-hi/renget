A good Hunter, is one who kills beasts without hesitation. One who understands that a beast is worth no more then the Blood Echoes they leave behind.

A bad hunter is one who turns beast themselves. One who can't control their blood lust in a hunt and leaves their mind to forces stronger then them. 

But what of those who consort with them? 

It was a question no sane man would ask. But then again, are Hunters even sane to begin with? 

It was safe to assume that the type of people who would go out on the night of the hunt and tear those wretched things walking the blood covered streets limb from limb had one or two screws lose.

It was something the good Hunter had wondered about when his Saw Cleaver tore flesh for the first time.

Asking himself "Is this right? Should I be doing this?" 

Those thoughts of self reflection were quickly discarded as the Hunter found himself running from the various dangers that night. Whether it be beasts, or angry villagers, it seemed everything wanted him dead that night. 

But the Hunter continued on. 

Wandering the streets, and killing the beasts that walked them, as the strange man in his dream had requested of him. 

"Just go out and kill a few beasts. It's for your own good" 

The Hunter has repeated those words in his head continuously, as if trying to convince himself that he really believed them. But he didn't. 

No matte how hard the Hunter tried, there was a nagging at the back of his head. There was something familiar about these beasts, but what was it?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

It had been a full week since then. And aside from now wearing the appropriate atire for his job, not much had changed for the Hunter. 

The streets of Yharnam were still as violent as ever and it felt like there was no end to the amount of beasts the Hunter has to deal with. It was as if more of them were coming to the town every day, as least, that's what the Hunter has thought to himself.

"You plague-ridden rat!"

"This is all your fault!"

The awful yells of the angry villagers had shaken the Hunter from his deep state of thinking and Immediately, he has drawn his Cleaver and rushed towards them.

After his first day on the hunt, the Hunter has developed somewhat of a routine. He would walk towards the town center and begin "cleaning up" as the beasts wandered Yharnam aimlessly. Today was a bit different however.

For whatever reason, there seemed to be a greater number of beasts around the bridge today, so that's where the Hunter went. As he reached the bridge, the first thing that greeted him was a Scourge Beast. The Hunter remembered them, for they had killed him once before. 

As grim as it was, the memory if his death has made him smile, if only for that fact that it was so ridiculous that he was still standing, completely alive. 

The beast continued to walk slowly, completely oblivious as to the Hunters presence. Using this to his advantage, the Hunter took a Molotov Cocktail from his belt and threw it at the beast. 

The Hunter just watched as the Beats burned and howled, unable to do anything as it's fur and flesh became turned to ash. 

Despite what the man in the wheelchair had told him, the Hunter still found no great joy in killing the beasts. He still did it of course, but mostly out of an obligation he felt he owed to the people of Yharnam. Despite not knowing any of them as more then a voice, he still felt like cleansing the streets would be a good deed, and one that the resident's would appreciate.

The Hunter looked towards the end of the bridge, but his vision was obscured by an odd fog. 

"That's no good." He thought to himself. Perhaps there were beasts there, or maybe, a route to some other part of the city he had neglected to even think about. 
It might even explain the constant appearance of the beasts and why there seemed to be no end to them. 

Even if it was nothing, it was still worth at least the trouble of going over there to check. 

As the Hunter reached the end of the bridge, he was rather disappointed to find nothing of note. No beasts. No passage. No nothing.

There was a door, but it was locked shut, and with no solution to opening it, the Hunter decided to turn around and go back. 

"Guess there was nothing here after all." He said to himself.

Just at that moment however, he heard a terrible screeching noise. It sounded like it belonged to a beast, but it was no beast he had ever heard before. Not to mention the horrifying fact that the scream sounded close, close enough that the Hunter could feel his bones shaking. In the dead silence that followed, the Hunter could feel his own heartbeat as well. 

The Hunter turned around, hesitantly, unsure if he even wanted to see what creature could produced such a wicked sound. 

At first, the Hunter felt relief. There was nothing there, aside from what he had already seen. 

Not even a minute after, however, something had slammed into the bridge from above, and when he took a good look at what the thing was, the Hunter had wished he had just stuck to his usual routine. 

Standing before him, tall and deformed, was a beast the Hunter had never once seen before. 

He had antlers like a deer, but they were twisted, malformed. They looked like dead branches that had grown from his skull. 

His rib cage was exposed, making his chest looked as if it had teeth and his stomach was sunken in.

His arms were lopsided, one clearly larger then the other and covered in fur, making his other arm seem weak, even though the Hunter was sure both of them could crush him just the same. 

Strangely enough, despite all these oddities about the monster, the thing that caught the Hunters attention first was the massive, inhuman length that hung between his legs. It was huge. As big as the Hunter's entire arm, with what seemed to be twice the girth. His balls were proportional to the length, which is to say, they were massive.

The force of the slam from earlier had caused the Hunter to lose balance and fall onto his back, which in turn made him lose his grip on his weapon. 

Laying on the ground, without a weapon and at the mercy of a monster. Calling the situation an "unfortunate circumstance" was a understatement. 

The Hunter looked at his options, and found that simply praying for his life was probably his best option available to him as the beast made his advance. 

Finally, the Beast loomed over him, massive and imposing. The Hunter looked him over for what he was sure to be the last seconds of his life. 

Most men would call it disgusting. A freak of nature. A menace. And they would probably be right, but at this moment, the Hunter couldn't help but find something incredibly arousing about him. 

It was a combination of multiple things. For one, it had to do with just how powerful he looked. The beast was nearly three times bigger then him in every aspect. The second was probably the feeling of being completely at the mercy of such a beast, helpless to do anything. The third, quite simply, had to do with the fact that the beasts shaft was so big it dragged on the ground.

As the Beasts giant maw approached him, he was sure it was over. The Hunter closed his eyes, thinking, for some reason, that it might ease the oncoming pain a little.

But the pain never came. Instead, he heard a sniffing sound. The Hunter opened his eyes and saw that the beast, was indeed, smelling him. 

The Hunter stared at the beast, confused by his odd behavior, but remained perfectly still, his instincts were still telling him it was better not to do anything to agitate something that could so easily kill him. 

The Beast sniffed like it was looking for something, and before the Hunter could even think about what it could be, it seemed like he had found it, and when he did, a shiver ran up the Hunter's spine.

The Beast had stopped sniffing at the spot right between his legs. It was obvious the Hunter now that the Beast had smelled his arousal and was all too eager to do something with it. 

The Beast leaned up and licked his teeth before chomping down at the Hunter's crotch. 

"Ahhh!" The Hunter yelped, fully expecting his manhood to be taken from him. To his relief, the Beast had only torn his pants, releasing his cock and letting it stand erect in the cool air. 

The Beast then got down on all fours and positioned himself in front of the Hunter, like looked like a dog waiting for a bone from they're master. 

He opened his mouth began dragging his tongue along the Hunter length. The contact made the Hunter jump, but he couldn't deny it felt good despite how clumsy the Beast was being. 

In fact, clumsy might have been a generous word to describe what the Beast was doing. The Beast essentially had the Hunter cock in an open bear trap. If he closed his maw, there would be trouble, so instead, he let his tongue do all the work by wrapping it around the Hunter's cock and treating it like it was a piece of food and he was a starving rat. 


The amount of drool that was leaking from the Beasts mouth was egregious. It was the wettest, most disgusting act of fellatio the Hunter had ever received.

And it couldn't have made him harder. 

The Beasts tongue then traveled downward, coating his balls in the same slobber that had drenched the Hunter's length. 

He went even lower and before he knew it, the Beast had shoved his tongue in the his taint. 

"Ahhhh!" The Hunter yelled with a jolt of his hips. It's not that the Hunter had never been eaten out before, but with a tounge like the Beasts it felt completely different. He could feel the Beast reaching new territory within him. Every inch making him writhe harder and harder in pleasure, yet no words came out. The Beast was leaving him breathless. 

When the Beast pulled out from the Hunter, he couldn't help but feel terribly empty. He wanted to whine. 

Maybe, the Beast would understand and resume what he was doing before, after all, he was smart enough not to close his maw around the Hunter's manhood. 

Before the Hunter could begin however, The Beast had pulled on his legs and dragged him towards his massive frame. 
The Beast then grabbed his massive cock and placed it on the Hunter's chest.

The Hunter could barely even believe it's size. It looked even bigger up close then it did from afar, and it didn't even look completely hard. While it was placed on his chest like this, he could even feel it's weight, and it felt heavy enough that it could probably  be used as a weapon if the Beast ever tried.   

Licking his teeth, the Beast then positioned himself in a way that made it obvious as to what he had planned. 

Fear, once again, found it's way into the Hunter's mind as he began to think of the damage that monster could cause to his insides. But who knows, he had never really checked how "stretchy" he was before, and the Beast had prepared him rather well, so perhaps he would even surprise himself. 

With no pause, the Beast aligned himself, and penetrated the Hunter with great force.

Or at least, attempted to. 

No matter how hard the Beast tried, his cock simply wouldn't go in the Hunter. It was just too big. 

The Hunter could tell he was getting irritated now, for the Beast was now mindlessly ramming the head of his cock against his ass with no success. Each time harder, but with similar results.

With a whimper, the Beast stopped and the Hunter wondered what he was going to try next. I was all too apparent to him now that the Beast was incredibly sex deprived, and absolutely needed some type of release, why else would he be doing this with something so much smaller then him?

The Hunter tried getting up. He had the idea to try and fit what he could of the Beats humongous piece of flesh in his mouth. Maybe even lick it like the Beast had done to him just a moment ago. 

As soon as he got his back off the ground, the Beast had pressed his bigger arm to his chest and pushed him down to the floor again. 

Too scared to move, the Hunter waited for the Beast to act. He watched motionless, as the Beast got up on his two feet and stood to his full frame before walking over him until he was just on the other side of the Hunter.

What happened was the last thing the Hunter would've expected. 

The Beast squatted down and placed his ass directly on top of the Hunter's face, which in turn, made the Beasts length flop against the Hunter's chest, his enormous balls resting on the spot just below his neck. 

Before he could adjust to the new position, he took a deep whiff of the Beasts thick scent. It was powerful, manly and most of all, absolutely intoxicating. 

The Hunter could barely stop himself from plunging his tongue inside the Beast to get a taste of him. When he did, he heard a loud roar from above him, urging him to continue, so he did just that. 

While lapping up all the sweat around the Beasts pucker, he took his hands and placed them firmly on the Beasts cheeks, which allowed to him to pull himself up and dig even deeper into the Beasts pungent hole. 

As the Hunter's tongue continued to explore the Beasts insides, he heard the moans from above become louder, more desperate. The Hunter couldn't help but feel a little proud of himself for making the Beast moan so loud. It's just too bad he couldn't speak, for surely, at this point he would've been screaming his name. 

After hitting a certain sweet spot within the Beast, he could feel him lean back and attempt to support himself by leaning on his larger arm. The Hunter stopped for just a moment to see if the Beast needed a break, but was instantly shoved by the back into the hole by the Beasts smaller arm, which was now at the back of his head. 

The Hunter was at a loss of what to do, but he knew the last thing he wanted was to stop. So he continued praising the Beasts ass with every way he knew how. Licking around the pucker, licking the sweat the came off the Beasts skin and even kissing his hole. Anything he could think of. 

Sure it was depraved, but the Hunter didn't care any more. The only thing that mattered to him at this moment was the monstrous creature that currently had all his weight pressed on top of him, and how he was the most important thing on earth as of right now. 

A few more licks and the Beast had moaned again, this time lifting himself off the Hunter and falling forward. Hands on the floor and ass held up, presenting his hole to the Hunter in such a submissive manner that it made the Hunter question who really had the power in this situation. 

He walked forward until he was standing right in front of the massive ass of the Beast, his dick, as enormous as it was, was uselessly hanging in the air, with so much precum leaking from the tip it had made a small puddle underneath him. 

Feeling a surge of absolute control at the scenario, the Hunter fearlessly smacked the Beasts left cheek with hand. 

"Man... you really want my dick bad don't you?" Said the Hunter, placing his hand on the place where he had struck and began squeezing. "And to think, just a moment ago, I was scared of you." 

He teased the Beasts hole, barely touching it with his index finger. The Beast made a rather pathetic sound, like a whimper or something similar. But instead of waiting for the Hunter, the Beast, in all his impatience, took his smaller arm and began fingering his wet whole, fervently.

The Hunter took this chance to get a hold of one the Beasts huge orbs that were hanging low. Unsurprisingly, it was rather heavy, but it was hard to tell if it was from the amount of excess cum it held that needed to be released or just a result the size. 

Regardless, the weight felt nice, so he grabbed the other one, which hang a bit lower, and held it in his palms. 

It was hard to believe that the situation he was in was even real. The Hunter was currently playing with the balls of a monster who had one of his own clawed fingers sunk into it's own ass. The thought alone would be enough to get the Hunter hard as rock, but to actually be doing it? It was even better then the Hunter could've possibly imagined.

The Hunter tried putting one of the massive orbs in his mouth, but just ended up suckling on it, like a newborn would his mother. He kept going however, as debauched as it was, he enjoyed the sickly salty taste of the sweat that had accumulated on the Beast's sac, and vigorously licked every droplet, savoring it like it was a fine wine. 

When the Beast whined again, he stopped fingering himself and spread his legs wider. The Hunter knew what he wanted. But the Beast was so tall that it made fucking him as he was impossible. He had to get a stone slab that was lying around and placed it underneath himself just so he could even reach the Beasts hole. 

Once he was set up, the Hunter spread the hole in front of him, not to stretch the Beast or anything like that, he was quite sure he would fit, but mostly just to get a good look of the pucker he had became so intimate with in the last few minutes.

It was a sight worthy of looking at, but he knew the Beast must have been desperate since he had begun wailing again. So he grabbed his cock, positioned it in front of the welcoming hole, and entered the Beast.

The pleasure was immediate. The Beast was warm, very warm. And despite the size of him, he was oddly tight. 

"Must be his first time" the Hunter thought to himself as he plunged deeper into the Beast. 

In no time at all, he had gone as deep as he could go, and the Hunter's entire cock and now firmly wrapped by the fleshy walls of the Beast. He heard the Beast screech again, but this time it was obvious it wasn't with the intention to intimidate. He scraped the ground with his claws the second time the Hunter thrust into him, his breathing was sporadic now.

The Hunter began to speed up, and put as much force into each thrust as he could, putting his entire body weight into smashing against the Beasts ass, trying to make his best to make the creature scream. 

He loved it. He loved how subservient the Beast had become. How such a terrifying thing was now on it's hands, getting stuffed by something so much weaker then it. 

The Beast was now moving, pushing away from the Hunter when he pulled out, and pushing back in when the Hunter went forward. 

The Beasts cock was flopping everywhere, spraying the ground with copious amounts of precum every time it swayed. It's balls were doing the same. Eventually, with all the motion the Beast was doing, his sac was slapping against the Hunter each time they connected. 

The Hunter took note of this, and the next time he pushed his entire manhood into the Beasts hole, he took one in his hands before it could move away, and gave it a squeeze. 

The Beast yelped and a thick rope of cum ejected from his cock onto the ground. 

The Hunter took this to mean that the Beast was finally coming, so he slowed down. 

This was a mistake.

The Beast screamed loudly and pushed his body against the Hunter, causing him to fall off the plate and land, once again, helplessly on the ground. 

Instead of getting a face full of ass like he had gotten before, the Beast just positioned himself on top of his length, and slammed onto it. 

There was pain, yes, but the feeling of getting inside the Beast, balls deep in less then a second was good enough that he could learn to endure it, not that he had a choice. 

The Beast gave the Hunter no time to rest. He repeatedly raised and dropped his massive body down onto the Hunters cock endlessly, grinding his hips into the pavement below. And the Hunter, uncaring about the reality that he could very well break a bone, had his eyes rolled back to his head out of infinite bliss. 

Every time the Beast had lowered himself, his length would dangle with him, in all its massive glory. The Hunter found that especially arousing. It was just too bad he couldn't do anything with it. The Beast really did have an amazing cock, but at least he could admire it for now. 

The Beast felt wonderful, and as he looked up at him, his blood-red tinted horns and his pale grey fur was nothing short of breathtaking. 

He wished his time with Beast would never end. He'd never even thought sex could be this good. It would be impossible, the Hunter thought, for him to ever spend time with another human after tonight. No human ever felt this warm, or this good. 

Finally, with a few more screams and moans coming from the both of them, they came. 

The Hunter came first, but he didn't feel ashamed. How could anyone last even one full minute under the Beast like that? It would be impossible. 

The Beast came shortly after with one final scream, releasing himself all over the Hunter, covering him in his thick seed. The Hunter swallowed some and gave it a taste. 

Salty and bitter, not that he had expected anything else. 

The Beast was still on top of him, gasping for air. He was still recovering from the climax, and going off the amount of seed that had erupted from him, he deserved it. 

Lying in the afterglow was bittersweet for the Hunter. He was, of course, feeling incredible. How could he not? He just had the best sex of his life. But the problem came if what would happen after that. 

He knew he probably couldn't ever do this again. His partner for tonight had been a beast, and by daylight, all the beasts that roamed the streets disappeared without a trace. He knew it would be the same with this one, and that made his heart sink a little. 

He looked up at the Beast, who had stopped his heaving and gone back to breathing normally. There was just something about him that made the Hunter lose himself. He was sure if he told this to anyone, they would lock him up in an asylum, but he couldn't lie to himself, he loved how the Beast looked, claws and all. 

Just then the Beast leaned down, coming closer to his face until they were inches apart.

"No... is he gonna? No, he couldn't be... is he?" But just then, he did. 

The Beast stuck out his tongue and let it drag over the Hunter's lips, drenching his face in drool. The Hunter returned the favor, bringing his own tongue to the Beasts much larger one. 

It could barely be called a kiss. It was too sloppy, too disgusting, and much to raunchy to be called that, but the Hunter continued nonetheless. 

As the Beast fell lower, the Hunter reached up and kissed every single one of the Beasts sharp, jagged teeth, hoping that somehow that Beast knew what it meant. He didn't.

The Beast turned over to lay on his back, and the Hunter rolled over to his side. He moved closer to the Beast warm fur, which smelled completely like him and nothing else, and drifted to sleep. 

-------------------------------------------------------

When the Hunter awoke, it was daylight and much to his disappointed, the Beast was gone. He knew this would happen, but he was still devastated. 

Some other citizens found him on the bridge, and judging from they're reactions, he must've been quite the sight.

The rumor, as he had last heard it, was that he went crazy from pure sexual frustration and ended up ripping of his pants and masturbating all night, "reliving" himself all over the bridge. He laughed at that, after all, it was probably more believable that what had actually happened that night. 

After that night, he became one of those Hunters who eagerly awaited for the night of the hunt, but not for the reasons anyone might think.
