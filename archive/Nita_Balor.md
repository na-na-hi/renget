## Material Gains *(Items)*
Nita hasn't obtained any items from character creation but has obtained several outside of it during her five year prelude adventure.

## Personal Gains
The power of friendship or something like that.

**Sygom:** Sometimes the devil on your shoulder has a great idea, other times it just wants to watch the world burn. Sygom acts as a familiar but is in truth a higher summon that Nita has made a special contract with; a touch of freedom in exchange for power. Content with fire or frolic he usually eggs Nita on or in rare cases acts as a mentor.

## Making her Mark
Spells, abilities, and special moves. Nita is an accomplished elementalist but excels in pyromancy to the point where a snap of her fingers can result in large scale conflagration. This power comes at the cost of not being able to control water or earth and being average with air at best. She is an agile fighter backed up by potent magic, gets in close melting through armor and weaker weapons, forgoing a weapon entirely due to not finding any that can handle her channeling fire through it. To save on the laundry list of various types of fireballs, flamethrowers, explosions, and jet propulsions Nita is capable of here's a shorter list of some unique abilities.

**Abyssal Heritor:** Sygom temporarily possess Nita allowing her to use the demons abilities to amplify her own, however it's mostly Sygom in control. Nita's horns and tail grow larger and spiked during the possession which the extra mass crumbles to ash afterwards.

**Fatale's Mark:** Calling upon a vampires need to feed with but with a lack of teeth, Nita drains the life force out of her target through supple flesh. Nita has both treasured and tragic memories involving this trick and saves a certain lipstick for special occasions.

**Immolate Vessel:** Nita sets herself alight. In addition to acting like a torch her spell casting abilities are heightened at the cost of putting herself on a timer.

Big changes: Traded Vampirism for Dhampirism, cut down on all proficiencies due to loss of Chosen, lost Mao and Sadist and Yan Yan so Nita is less of a little shit in the long run.
She still fights the same but with weaker magic she's not capable of flight.
