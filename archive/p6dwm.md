#####J. Walker
!!! info Johnny Walker | HN: Titan
	**Size Matters**: A quirk that allows Johnny to increase or decrease the size of whatever he's touching. Although over-use can quickly tire him out, the long duration of his effects and the sheer amount he can change his targets size by makes it a powerful quirk. Hasn't really explored the shrinking side of his power much.
![A scrawny black-haired kid in a black hoody.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1680/55/1680552056452443.jpg)
######Background
Born as the son of the famous American heroes Atomic Man and Gigantica Johnny was always a rather popular kid. He'd later begin to see this as a burden due to everyone approaching him for his parents rather than because they actually liked him. As he grew older the more this happened and the more frustrated he felt at everyone just trying to use him in an attempt to get something from him.

Seeking to get away from all of it, when asked which Hero school he wanted to go to he asked to become an exchange student to try to have an actual social life in a country where no one knows him or his parents.

>Personality
A rather carefree individual he tries to not get life get him down much. He extends this to trying to help and support others when he can.

#####D. Jackson
!!! info Damien Jackson | HN: Dark Seer
	**Chronovision**: Damien can see up to 100 hours into the future, the farther into the future, the longer he needs to focus. Immediate events are highly accurate but farther off events are much less certain. His eyes will glow a bright blue when using his power, and while he can still fully sense his current surroundings, it can become hard to focus on the future and present. Going in and out of chronovision puts a large strain on his mind, but little affect on his body. 
![That's white boy Black Panther?](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1680/28/1680284435303462.jpg)
######Background
Damiens father was an ambitious and aggressive hero from america, but due to the high hero population he couldn't stand out. In an attempt to make a stronger dynasty he arranged a quirk marriage. Damien was trained by his father trained him through middle school, but realized that damien had not inherited either of his parents flashy powers. Damiens father sent him away to Japan to either become a strong hero, and if that failed, to be rid of his disappointment. Damien was given only the bare minimum he needed to survive in stipend from his family. Most of his normal clothes and items began to get worn down. The only item he could keep in good condition was his whip, shadow strike, his father had given him, passed down to him from his father. Becoming a hero was his best way of surviving. The relationship with his father eats away at Damien, while not having real anger torwards him, there is resentment, but also a desire to impress him, and hopes to one day earn his respect 
>Personality
Damien is a intelligent and introverted person and will mostly stick to himself. He spends a lot of his time checking his near future which leads him to over analyze many simple tasks. He is over meticulous and a perfectionist in his actions. He tends to disagree with reckless and impulsive people.

#####R. Hertz
!!! info Richard Hertz | HN: Cactiking
	**Sabotenda**: This Quirk allows such close communion with cactus plants that they can even create cactus parts on the body. Subtly encourages a love for arid environments and a higher discomfort in high humidity. Become a natural needle sharpshooter!
![A young boy with cactus needles coming off his green hoody. There's a red flower on the hood.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682474253325144.jpg)
######Background
He thinks becoming a hero will probably be more fun than getting a real job. Even though he's a relaxed and slow-paced kind of guy, he's an adrenaline junkie and will do extreme sports with a sloppy, lazy style. His favorite thing in the world is his Suzuki enduro bike.

#####A. Kamiyami
!!! info Aomi Kamiyami | HN: Yokawaii
	**Kawaiiccubi**: A demonic body with an affection-boosting mental effect. The longer someone is in a 10 meter radius, the more positively they feel about Aomi. Warning: people do not always act nice or sensible towards the people they like. Can only work on up to four individuals at a time.
![A short red-haired girl with red eyes, a spade tail, and small wings.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682474780206068.jpg)
######Background
Aomi speaks in third person. Aomi does not like to be touched or manhandled. Aomi has body image issues. Please do not hurt Aomi. Aomi prefers to hover instead of walking because Aomi does not like being looked down on (in any sense).

Villain/Hero Trivia

#####R. Kamiyami
!!! info Rikae Kamiyami | HN: Bunraku
	**Puppeteer**: Rikae is able to psychically control puppets, even multiple at once, at a range of up to 100 meters. When they return to her, she learns what she would have been able to see and hear if she were in the place of the puppet, for the entire duration they were away. She does this by letting them 'whisper' in her ear, though this quirk does not grant puppets the ability to see, hear, or speak as such. The puppets "remember" for as long as they remain within 10km of their puppeteer, even if they fall outside of direct control range. Puppets under Rikae's control are much more resilient than the material that makes them up, and so are functional as combatants, tools, and shields.
![A short blonde girl with blue eyes wearing a large blue bow in her hair.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682474780206068.jpg)
######Background
Rikae is good at talking to people and upholding her image as a good and gentle girl. She loves horror media, witchcraft lore, and the occult, but tries to keep it hidden from most people because she does not want to be unpopular. She knows how to sew and how to make dolls, and is an expert at making bento boxes - and only bento boxes.

#####K. Fuhayai
!!! info Koukoka Fuhayai | HN: Hyōtetsu
	**Nekomimi**: Does whatever a ~~spider~~ house cat can. Is she strong? Listen, bud. She's got efficient hunter blood. (Slightly worse eyesight during the bright day, so has to wear subscription sunglasses sometimes.) She can make her retractable claws as hard as diamond but only as brittle as steel, thanks to her parentage. 
![A white-haired catgirl with pink eyes, glaring and ready to pounce.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682475735946512.jpg)
######Background
Kou-chan is a loud and aggressive person and classic tsundere type. She likes to socialize by doing her own thing in the same room as people she likes, and will only try something new if somebody else is doing it with her. She definitely doesn't end any of her sentences in nyan like mama, okay? And she's not going to just purr for you. (You have to earn it.) She is a bit of an otaku for professional fighters, like sumo, or olympic martial artists, and thinks exercising at gyms is boring (but free-running is kino.) Unsurprisingly, she has some feline instincts, like preferring to ambush targets from cover and not thinking of retreats as a loss.

Her mama is also a Nekomimi, and her papa can turn his fingernails into an exotic carbon compound. He owns a convenience store, and the family lives above it.

#####H. Akairo
!!! info Haruka Akairo | Taoyama
	**Osu-Oni**: Possessing a resilient body with the mutant ability to generate directed energy in the form of heat. Because the muscle fibers are more resilient, injury to the interior of the body is made much more difficult and they are able to provide exponentially superior leverage for their size. Extra-tough skin is not harmed by the power of the super-strength.
![A tan girl with white hair, orange horns, and orange eyes. She wears a gas mask.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682476008075036.jpg)
######Background
Haruka (晴香) comes from a long background of both heroes and villains. Even today, some of her family is tied up with the Yakuza, though her direct parents are second generation Professional Heroes. She was raised almost like a cousin to the other Haruka, though they aren't closely related; their families are just tied together that much by shared history.

She has a distant and sadistic personality and doesn't let anyone forget how tough she is. She has yet to master the hot-spirited persona that makes her family so popular in commercial heroics.
######Stats
>Skimpy Costume
>Hero Family
>Wealthy
>Rival: Haruka
>Gadget
Owns a heatsink device that inefficiently turns ambient heat into levitative force. It is not enough to lift Haruka's body, but it is enough to store away energy to prevent her from overheating and becoming ill.

#####H. Mizuiro
!!! info Haruka Mizuiro | HN: Ochiryū
	**Hiku-Oni**: The ability to draw in energy in the form of heat, empowering one's own body. The endothermic energy is converted by mysterious processes into everything the body needs, making it work beyond the optimal levels of the normal person.
![A tan girl with white hair, teal horns, and teal eyes. She looks smug.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682476008075036.jpg)
######Background
Haruka (遥花) comes from a long background of both heroes and villains. Even today, some of her family is tied up with the Yakuza, though her direct parents are second generation Professional Heroes. She was raised almost like a cousin to the other Haruka, though they aren't closely related; their families are just tied together that much by shared history.

She has a smug and condescending personality and likes to feel better by making others feel worse. She has yet to master the cool persona and careful public relations that make her family well-regarded in public life.
######Stats
>Skimpy Costume
>Hero Family
>Wealthy
>Rival: Haruka
>Gadget
Owns a powerbank device that constantly produces waste heat while levitating itself. Because of the thermal output, Haruka can tap into it passively to keep her ability active. The device is not strong enough to provide lift to Haruka and could burn someone else's skin.
>Skills

>Body Enhancement Quirk
Self (Reflexes, Strength, Endurance, Stamina, Willpower)
Consume (thermal energy), Material dependent
Cosmetic Mutation
Note: This is less efficient and complete than an Absorption quirk, but has a broader effect. It requires concentration, intention, and target selection, also making it less dependable than an Absorption quirk. The upside is that it allows better granularity.

#####N. Atsuini
!!! info Nekketsu Atsuini | HN: Iesujō
	**Kinryoku**: Charged by the fire of pure fighting spirit welling up from within, physical abilities go beyond their limits and perfect awareness is near! ...If you're in the mood for it.
![A big-lipped young man with bulging muscles and a stern expression. He wears a wrestler's bodysuit.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682477197128158.jpg)
######Background
Prefers to go by Nekke, and Nekke-san. He has a goofy, affable personality most of the time, and shies away from conflict. However, Nekke has a serious and violent side that comes out when there's no other way forward. He likes to get along with people so much that he's more or less a doormat, but he can't stomach when people are cruel to others who have no strength to resist it. Although he bears some resemblance to a legacy hero, they aren't family; Nekketsu was just deeply inspired by their example.

Note: Not *self*-protectiveness.

#####T. Seijinto
!!! info Tamtamoi Seijinto | HN: Magatayami
	**Firesoul**: This quirk provides a spiritual connection to fire and flames, giving supernatural affinity with it. Flame spirits are said to protect the one blessed by this quirk, and familial legend says it's been passed down from the pre-quirk era due to the intermarriage of a kitsune ancestor.
![A tall, thin young man with curled orange hair and a fox-like sneer. He is wearing a two-peaked black beanie.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682478393451715.jpg)
######Background
Tamtamoi belongs to a long family line of priests and maidens associated with a specific shrine, its relics, and the associated rituals. Even though he's quick to anger, with a sharp tongue and crass vocabulary, he is a true believer in his faith and the necessity of his duties. His goal in becoming a hero is to make his family's shrine a household name, and ensure that it stays in upkeep and donations for the foreseeable future. He is clever, but not booksmart, and so trusts that hard work alone will carry him to success.

His afterschool life is dominated by the need to go back home to the shrine and perform daily chores or spiritual errands his elders send him on. Tamtamoi, in spite of his traditionalist image, loves punk and metal music and can talk for hours about his favorite bands.

#####K. Kūindō
!!! info Kamome Kūindō | HN: Senpūkiūki
	**Cy-clone**: Kamome can create ethereal copies of objects that move atmospheric gases, and manipulate their outputs. By multiplying and directing the force they create, she can push and pull light objects, hover and levitate, and stir up twirling gusts. (She can likely clone other objects too, but can't wrap her head around how to do it.)
![A young blonde girl with red eyes is wearing two oscillating fans over her hands. A seabird is also there.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/47/1682479859529174.jpg)
######Background
An air-headed and well-meaning girl whose enthusiastic plans are as likely to work as they are artfully constructed - that is, not very. Her favorite hobby is eating, whether it's snacks, fine dining, experimental dishes, or comforting junk food. She never keeps the weight on because she's so energetic and active, burning it all away. Secretly, she wants to be the heroine in a perfect and historical romance, and worries that her stature is preventing her from achieving her dream. Becoming a popular and helpful hero can help in the meantime, right? Kamome may be loud, excitable, and easily distracted, but she's also an innocent soul who blushes and cries easily.
######Stats

#####Y. Yericsson
!!! info Yokia Yericsson | HN: Telefonia
	**Chatterbox**: The ability to get inanimate objects to talk in yes or no responses, and move about in small ways.
![A girl with a yellow rain coat and terminal over-design syndrome.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/48/1682483580670466.jpg)
######Background
Yokia is a normal high school girl. She likes fashion and cute things. She likes sweets. She likes pop songs about happy subjects. ~~And she likes people to be loyal.~~ And she likes when people get along. She can be pouty and jealous sometimes, but is also eager to cheer people up, encourage the downtrodden, and help out in even small ways. Yokia wanted to be class representative, because she wants to be student body president someday and thought it would be the ideal first step. Unfortunately, she found out that it's an assigned position at this academy, and it already went to another girl in class.

That's fine. Happy thoughts. Stay genki! Daijoubu!

#####T. Tenshi (Class Rep)
!!! info Tetsuko Tenshi | HN: Interface
	**Android Body**: can incorporate technology into itself along with fuel/ammunition like bullets or batteries. Assimilated technology can be damaged, and the android body will need to release the damaged items and send them to be fixed. Assimilated technology can take on new shapes or sizes, even shrinking down a large computer tower to a computer chip. Assimilated ammunition can be different kinds, like rubber bullets vs live rounds, and the android body can keep track of which is which before firing. Only so much fuel/ammunition can be utilized at once, meaning more intensive systems require rerouting energy from other systems. Other less intensive systems can also be overclocked with too much fuel increasing their effectiveness at the risk of damaging them.
![A tall girl with long black hair and bright red eyes. She has a neutral expression.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/48/1682485157256521.jpg)

#####Stephan Gunn
!!! info Stephan Gunn | HN: Ō-Seidō
	**Bronze Age**: Stephan turns his renewable body tissues into bronze metal constructs by propagating it through his skin in shell-like layers. He has absolute control over the shape and state of the bronze while in contact with it, even able to turn it into exotic states of matter - though this means the biomass is lost to him. The bronze layer is like his living tissue, and properly made devices from it will seamlessly interface with his body. It is possible, and even painless, for him to turn part of his bronze layer into a discrete object and let it fall (or shoot) from his surface. Removing all the bronze from his outside would be as damaging as removing all the shell from a lobster. 
![A tall, metallic, monstrous figure with hoses and antenna implanted.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1552/94/1552942506613.jpg)
######Background
Stephan doesn't talk much, and tends to get by with monosyllabic answers or, better yet, gesturing. He has a lot of baggage from mistreatment, due to the way his quirk has mutated his body. He is quiet, thoughtful, and persistent, and enjoys looking at popular mechanics magazines. More than that, he loves flowers, and has settled in well with the Gardening Club. They're protective over him. (His feelings are a lot easier to hurt than his body.) Has an innocent and bashful mentality.

#####V. Legosi
!!! info Valerie Legosi | HN: Necromancer
	**Onryō-Shi**: Can create spooky ghostly figures in an area of 80 meters around her. It can be anything from hundreds of transparent floating bedsheets with googly eyes to a single fully realistic 50+ meter tall opaque ghost that can't be visibly distinguished from a real human. Since they don't actually exist, ghosts can't be hit or impeded by physical obstacles, but their attacks still inflict pain. 
![A pink-tinted drill-haired maiden with wide, soulless eyes and a crown on her head.She is wearing a pink, black, and white gothic lolita outfit and is surrounded by simplistic ghosts.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/48/1682485866368408.jpg)
######Background
Val is the most bubbly goth around. She has a mischievous streak and never passes up a chance to tell a ghost story or frightening urban legend. In between her hero studies, participation in the Occult Club, and haunting of Shibuya, she reads anonymous message boards for the popular reoccurring threads about real supernatural encounters - which are both more believable and less frightening in the Quirk Age. She doesn't giggle after her pranks and puns; she cackles.

#####K. Mirokazu
!!! info Kaga Mirokazu | HN: Fight Man
	**Fatigue Boost**: He gets stronger and faster the closer he is to exhaustion. Just before he collapses from fatigue, he is incredibly powerful.
![A very short boy with chestnut hair and enormous eyebrows. He is wearing a karate gi with a red belt.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/48/1682488287976542.png)
######Background
Kaga is an avid martial artist. He loves training his body and perfecting his technique, and cherishes the peace of mind and focus that martial arts practice brings. He is easily irritated by people not taking him seriously or looking down on him, because of his unusually small size for his age and babyfaced appearance. Kaga is diligent and serious about everything he does, and has trouble having or expressing fun like a typical boy. He smiles broadest when he's in a difficult fight.

#####J. Brooks
!!! info Joan Brooks | Mire Girl
	**Fungal Thing**: allows the drastic manipulation of fungi, from the generation of spores of any species, to the rapid growth of fungi and their spores, to titanic supersizing and direct -kinesis, even to the creation of hybridized and force-evolved new fungus. Some of this is instinctual and automatic, accounting for the complex network of fungal symbiotes throughout Mire Girl's body, but the more impactful expressions of this mastery of all things mushroom is subject to willpower and nervous fatigue.
![A young woman with clouded eye, green skin, and mushrooms covering a great deal of her body. She is dripping water or slime from her arms.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/49/1682491541796275.jpg)
######Background
The daughter of an English diplomat and a Japanese housewife, Joan has a socially isolating quirk and an even more isolating flat affect to her voice and mannerisms. She is determined to turn her childhood of being bullied as "zombie girl" and "swamp freak" into a source of positivity in the world. She is sleepy in general, and legally blind, but her adaptable quirk and natural curiosity make up for the shortcomings.

!!! info Kiba Jūi | HN: The Beast
	**Henshinyūrui**: Kiba can turn into any specific mammal that he's gotten a good look of. Naturally, this includes other human beings, although he is unable to copy their quirks. Kiba has such high control from his years of playing and surviving with his abilities that he is able to shift just parts of his body, enabling him to become hybridized chimera. Turning into the same shape is demanding on the body, so Henshinyurui has to rest in a pattern that has not been used recently, or in the natural birth shape of Kiba. (Don't ask where the extra mass goes and comes from. Fifth dimension, maybe.)

######Background
An actual wild child. Yes, those are real tattoos. He does stick-and-poke and mixes his own inks. As for attitude, when you think "shonen," in a literal way, you're probably already describing him.

#####D. Bellis
!!! info Dario Bellis | HN: Rakugaki
	**Encrokinesis**: A quirk that enables one to control dye, ink, paint, and other liquid pigments/mixtures with the mind.
![A young man with a blue-black mullet, yellow eyes, and gray skin. He has seven star-shaped scars across his forehead and is holding three black butterflies.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/50/1682506133076897.jpg)
######Background
Dario doesn't take any of this seriously. Not heroing, not schoolwork, honestly not even life in general. He wants to be a hero because it's the least restrictions on using his powers, and he wants to be able to use them constantly. Although not been formally caught, he's been so strongly suspected of being a local graffiti artist that it's kept him in trouble with the school administration. Like he cares!
######Stats

Large quantity (50 cubic meters), Long range (100 meter radius)
Permanent change, Sight Only, Somatic

Compressed tank of black ink. Has a special valve that allows the quirk to open it from the inside and release precise amounts. 


#####L. McDichael
!!! info Liam McDichael | Canadaman
	**Maplesweat**: Liam can turn his sweat and skin oils directly into a sticky, brown, viscous substance that can be globbed into bouncy elastic blobs. It's not salty or musky, either. It's sweet. 
	
	Please don't eat the Liam syrup. It breaks down quickly.

#####A. Kijiko
!!! info Ainiji Kijiko | Majo Shimā
	**Headology**: The ability to create a disc of exotic material which is able to intelligently copy the memories of a person and implant it into another person's mind. The control over these discs is so great that they are able to be manipulated even after creation and copying, so as to create blank segments or entirely falsified information. Because it is a highly specialized form of tactile telepathy, Headology can also be used in a much weaker way without the disc medium but at a greater distance. This enables shallow read/write of surface thoughts, only in the most general sense of current emotional states.

#####K. Ōjijitsu
!!! info Kurosunō Ōjijitsu | HN: Tengan
	**Special Eyes**: Although not strictly limited to just vision, this quirk does allow for supernatural sight. These eyes can see more colors than others, and enable one to see lies as distortions in the hue of body heat and nervous signals. In fact, Special Eyes seem to be able to see what no one else can, such as "the true meaning and intent" of words, or unmistakable though subtle omens before personal harm.
![A long-haired blond boy in a bad suit. He has a puffy ponytail.](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1682/51/1682515028907000.jpg)
######Background
Kuro is here to learn everything about the protocols, and relevant laws, of Heroing, but he doesn't want to a professional hero per se. Legally speaking, he does not require a license. His main hobby is reading detective fiction, and his other hobby is amateur sleuthing. As long as he graduates from this prestigious academy, makes the right connections, and masters how to spot the crooked Pros from the true Heroes, he feels his time has been well spent.

Very much a know-it-all and a show-off, Kuro has no personal friends. The way he tells it, that's not to be unexpected. Great men always walk alone. When in front of a camera, though, he knows how to dial his smugness back and work his angles.
######Stats
>Skills
Investigate, Genius (Memory), Public Relations
>Clairvoyance
Danger Sense, Truth Sense (Aura), Alt.Sense x2 (IR + UV vision added), Translation Filter x2
10 km range
>Cosmetic Mutation: Heterochromia, pupil shine

#####N. Xiaohei
!!! info Naza Xiaohei | HN: Hantei
	**Hihoīru**: While appearing as flame, they give off light but no heat. Generated by this flame-wheel quirk, they have unusual physics, can be thrown and redirected mid-flight, and will expand and shrink to the wielder's demand. In this way, they are primarily used to bind things together, like collapsing structures or a person's limbs. Naza is good at balancing "on" them, enabling a way to skate through the air.
![A brown-haired girl in casual clothes, floating on two flaming hoops and summoning a third in one hand.](https://cdn.donmai.us/sample/ef/5e/__nezha_luo_xiaohei_zhanji_drawn_by_tsukiichi_0__sample-ef5ea1c6f9e94982d7572e326d84dd0b.jpg)
######Background
Naza has a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect others, which naturally lead to professional heroing as a career. She's been practicing with her flame wheels diligently for her entire life, but her single-mindedness and lack of nuance also holds her back. Lately, she's been trying to find reasons (and excuses) to intervene in petty crime in her neighborhood without running afoul of the quirk-use laws. So far, all she's been able to do is monitor and report. It's a source of frustration that is distracting her from her responsibilities in the classroom.
