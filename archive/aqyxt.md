##### `Camping and Loving`
>You’d finally managed to get a few days away camping with your wife away from the kids
>you loved them to the ends of the earth of course but sometimes you needed to get away, y’know?
>anyway your wife had led the two of you hiking through the woods for a few hours
>you had no idea where you were going but she did
>you emerged from the woodland onto the edge of a spectacular lake
>you soon recognised it where to two of you had first admitted your love to one another
>your wife insisted on doing some hunting after you set up your tent
>however said hunting consisted of her running off into the woods for 10 minutes and coming back covered in blood carrying a dead deer over her shoulder
>even after all these years she still showed off
>you helped her wash herself in the water, running your hands over her soft fur
>that night you watched the sun go down and the moon come up
>her eyes glowed in the moonlight as she looked at you
>the two of you drew closer and your body’s intertwined
>under the blessing of the full moon you would bring another pup into your pack
