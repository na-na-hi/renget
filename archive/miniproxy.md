    Sorry.

- I don't have a tripcode 
- I will check the emails and answer every single one of them.
- You can donate api keys and sources for access to the proxy. PLEASE DONT FILL YOUR PERSONAL KEYS WITH MONEY THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
- The proxy will only use organization keys.
- Miniproxy is not logged and will never be.
- I am not accepting monetary donations because they caused too much drama. 
- <3 to every other proxy host for providing proxies.

Feel free to email me for anything(yes, that includes logs/bots). Doesn't need to be related to proxies and /aicg/. Always open to key/source donators. 
needtocoomoridie@proton.me
(source hints are greatly appreciated)
If it takes me more than 3 days to reply to you feel free to send another email and yell at me.
<3
