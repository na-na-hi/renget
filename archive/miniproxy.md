- I don't have a tripcode 
- I will check the emails and answer every single one of them.
- You can donate api keys and sources for access to the proxy.
- The proxy will only use organization keys.
- Miniproxy is not logged and will never be.
- I am not accepting monetary donations because they caused too much drama. 

!!! info info and news (06/02/2024)
    gemini ultra is not released yet. I can't add that to the proxy...
***

Feel free to email me for anything(yes, that includes logs/bots). Doesn't need to be related to proxies and /aicg/. Always open to key/source donators. 
needtocoomoridie@proton.me
If it takes me more than 3 days to reply to you feel free to send another email and yell at me.
