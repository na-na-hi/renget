*Plap plap plap plap plap*

Umeko's slimy feet slap against the plastic tiles of the school hallway as she crawls along her way towards the bathroom, leaving a translucent, shiny trail behind her. She yawns, still very tired, even after sleeping through half of today's classes. She'll probably be sleeping through the other half later, to be honest. The only reason she's awake now is because it's lunch time.

The bathroom door pushes open smoothly, and she steps inside. Umeko's eyes lazily look through the stalls, and thankfully she finds no pairs of legs in any of them. By a stroke of luck, the place is empty. Choosing the closest stall to the door, she steps forward and crawls in from under the door. Midway into her entry, though, Umeko stops to look up at an unexpected sight.

"Oh, hey, Suki. Why are you-"
"GET SA FUCK OUT!"

Her greeting is met with a foot to the face, and the salamander girl swiftly retreats out of the stall. She blinks and raises her torso up, now fully awake from the shooting pain. She runs a hand up to her nose to make sure it's not bleeding. Nothing. The head of Umeko's classmate Suki peeks out from above the stall door, standing on top of the toilet to do so. Her glare shoots daggers down at the still-recoiling salamander.

"What sa fuck do you ssssink you're doing!?"
"Well, hello to you too. Fancy meeting you here, Suki. We haven't even known each other that long, and we're already synced up, huh? Isn't nature crazy?"

Umeko shakes her head and gives the delinquent snake a smirk. Suki is about to start yelling, but her screams get caught in her throat when she sees the bathroom door swing open with a lot of sudden force. The entrant this time is someone she would want to see here even less. If the smell didn't give away who it was, the intense sound of buzzing would. Daigo Ulmeyda, with his posse, a massive swarm of flies, enters for some reason.

"W-What!? Why isss- You're in the girl's bassssroom! GET OUT!"

Umeko holds up a hand towards Suki, but her eyes don't leave Daigo as he looks around the bathroom.

"Hold on, I want to see where he's going with this."
"WHAT?"
"Come on, it's Fly Boy. This has got to be good, right?"

Suki doesn't seem to agree; her face is tinged red with a mixture of shock, repulsion, and mostly anger. Daigo, for his part, doesn't even seem to care about their reactions as he confidently strides over towards the garbage can in the corner of the room.

"Fear not, ladies! Don't mind my presence; I'm only here to retrieve that pile of treasure before it's gone! The cafeteria's aren't very full, and the janitor is cleaning out the other bathroom as we speak! It's only a matter of time before those thieves take this away!"

Daigo arrives at the garbage can and wastes no time before diving headfirst into it. To the uncultured masses, it may have looked like any old regular dive, but to the real enthusiasts, it was like watching an Olympic performance. Daigo glides into the can as smooth as butter and gets to digging through its contents right away. Suki's face curls in utter disgust, but Umeko is holding herself back from bursting out laughing. She approaches him, stopping just outside his fly swarm to get a better view of his spelunking adventure.

"Man, he's really deep in there. Do you think he looks for specific things or is he just grabbing anything he can?"
"Why are you jussst letting him do sat? And how can you ssstand being so closhe to him? He reeksss."
"Calm down; I'm sure he'll be in and out in no time. And it's easy when you don't breathe through your nose... or your mouth. Really, you should just learn to breathe through your skin. It's pretty great."

And as predicted, Daigo pops out of the trash, arms full of... "treasure." His flies are already swarming his new collection, making Suki's skin crawl as she watches the boy get covered in them. He heads towards the door to make his swift exit, but is halted by Umeko, of all people, walking up to him and getting his attention.

"Heyyy, Fly Boy. Say, you want to grab dinner with me tonight? My treat!"

She makes eyes at him, but Umeko's question isn't answered in the way she'd like. Daigo shakes his head and turns her down.

"Afraid not! Thanks a Latte takes out their trash tonight, and that's something I can't afford to miss! Farewell, ladies! I'll see you in class!"

Daigo exits the bathroom with a dramatic flourish that's undermined by the garbage and flies he's covered in. Umeko sighs as he leaves, but she doesn't let it get her down.

"Damn, shot down. Oh well, it was worth a try."

She turns back towards Suki, who is giving her such an incredulous look that you'd think she just saw Umeko turn inside out.

"Wh... What'ssss wrong wiss you?"
"Hey, don't get mad that I'm not afraid to shoot my shot. You snooze, you lose."

Suki continues to stare at her like she is an alien lifeform, which gives Umeko an opportunity to bring up something important.

"Oh right. Suki, I was going to ask... Why are you naked?"

Suki scowls as a tint of red comes to her face. She lowers herself down, hiding her head behind the stall again.

"I mean, I won't judge. I just didn't see you as an exhibitionist."
"Sssshut up!"

The sukeban grits her teeth and flings something at Umeko from behind the stall before hunkering down inside again. It only takes Umeko a moment to realize what it is, and she hurriedly lowers herself down and runs to the corner of the room.

"Don't do that! You know I'm afraid of snakes! Even dead ones!"
"Thiss isss all that sstupid gross worm guy'sss fault! If he hadn't ssspewed sat fucking pink sssit on me, I wouldn't be like thisss! I had to leave my body and clossse in sa cafeseria."

Suki kicks the side of the stall she's in, letting out her aggression on the graffiti placed there. Umeko takes a few moments to slowly come out of the corner, warily looking at the snake corpse still lying on the tile floor.

"Why don't you just go get your clothes back?"
"Becaussse I'm naked, you ssstupid isiot!"
"So? Weren't you naked when you came in here?"
"I wasss a sssnake sen!"
"What does that have to do with anything?"
"AAARGH!"

Suki bangs on the sides of the stall again. This back-and-forth is going to make her pop a blood vessel. Umeko walks closer to the stall, giving the snake corpse a wide berth as she does.

"Oh, your clothes are probably still stuck, huh? Okay, hold on. I know how to fix this. Give me a second."

Umeko goes silent as she does... something. Suki is still crouched down on top of the toilet, catching her breath and calming down so she doesn't do anything too rash. When she doesn't hear her classmate say anything for a while, she takes a tentative peek out from the top of the stall again but quickly goes right back down.

"W-W-WHY ARE YOU NAKED!?"
"Oh, deja vu. I just asked that."

Suki's eyes bulge as she sees Umeko's clothes slide into the stall from under the door.

"I figured it'd be obvious. You can just wear my clothes! Problem solved!"
"NOT SSSSOLVED! PUT YOUR CLOSSSSE ON!"
"Relaaax. I'm a weird amphibian thing. Not like I have anything to hide. You can go ahead and wear mine."
"I'm nos pussing on your ssslimy sssnot clossse!"

Umeko sighs, shaking her head at Suki's attitude.

"Man, you sure are picky for someone in trouble. Are you sure?"
"Yesss, I'm ssure! If you want to help me out, sssen go get my gym clossse from my losser (locker)! Before lunss (lunch) endsss!"
"Fine, fine. We'll do this your way. Okay, I'll be right back! Don't go anywhere!"

The salamander girl laughs at her own joke, which turns into a yawn. All this goofing around is making her sleepy again. She shakes it off before going down and crawling back out the bathroom door, leaving Suki alone again.

The sukeban hisses to herself in frustration, but she can feel her feeling of turmoil starting to fade. At least this incident is going to get solved soon without her having to streak through the school. And maybe if Umeko does well here, she could be a good prospect for a henchling. She sits down on the toilet to let her legs rest, and she feels her feet touch something cold and slimy, not bathroom tile. It makes her legs flinch back on instinct. She looks down, and her eyes widen.

"YOU SSSSTUPID LISSSARD! YOU FORGOT YOUR.... clossse... Ah, fuck it. If she getsss in srouble for thiss, then a ssseacher ssshould be here to help me evenssually."
