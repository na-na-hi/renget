The ship reported "an explosion in close proximity to the vessel" east of Yemen's Aden, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said, adding the vessel was sailing to its next port of call.

>⚡️| 🇾🇪 SUMMARY of AnsarAllah leader, AbdulMalik al-Houthi’s speech:

• The amount of explosive materials used by the Zionists against Gaza is equivalent to 4 atomic bombs that the US used against Hiroshima in Japan.

• The Zionists destroy the agricultural lands of Gaza to turn this area into an uninhabitable place, forcing its residents to migrate.

• The pride of israeli soldiers is the massacre of Palestinian children. The Zionist enemy poses a danger to all of humanity.

• Hundreds of israeli soldiers suffer from mental illnesses, and many of them flee from the battlefield.

• Where is the Arab support for the Palestinian issue?! Especially when the US president talks about providing $14 billion in aid to the Zionist regime.

• Support from Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen for Gaza continues. Hezbollah in Lebanon is expanding every day and striking blows against the Zionist enemy.

• America & Britain have admitted that the Yemeni front has been effective in influencing the economy and capabilities of the Zionists and supporting Gaza.

• The time has passed for America to threaten while others just watch.

• Today, no one fears America's threats; new strategic developments are in favor of the Islamic Ummah.

• Food supplies for the Zionist enemy passing through the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb strait have reduced by 70%.

• The prices of goods in the israeli market have increased by 30 to 50% due to changes in the routes of its ships.

India has reportedly delivered 20 Hermes 900 drones to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.

>⚡️#Gaza: Government Media Office:
- The occupation army stormed the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis Governorate with tanks, drones, and heavily armed soldiers, shooting at the medical staff and displaced people inside, killing many citizens inside, and turning it into a cemetery and a military barracks; It is a clear and complete war crime, a crime against international law, and a crime against all international treaties.

The occupation army threatened those present with death and direct shooting, deprived them of water, food, and infant formula, and imposed harsh practices on them, which exacerbated the crisis inside the Nasser Medical Complex, and made the conditions dangerous and arousing fear and terror, in a way that clearly prevented the crews from providing medical and health services to hundreds of sick and wounded people. and displaced people, which threatens their lives.

We denounce and condemn in the strongest terms the occupation army’s storming of the Nasser Medical Complex and turning it into a military barracks. We consider this a war crime and a crime against morality and humanity. We hold the “Israeli” occupation, the international community and the United States of America fully responsible for the safety and lives of hundreds of medical staff, the wounded, the sick and the displaced. Our #Palestinian people are inside it.

We affirm that the lies that the occupation is spreading about the Nasser Medical Complex are just dirty, expendable propaganda exposed to the world, and that its claims have no basis in truth, and that they come within the framework of the occupation’s plan to completely eliminate the health sector and hospitals within its strategic plan aimed at displacing the people of the #Gaza Strip to Outside the #Gaza Strip and outside Palestine.

- We affirm that the occupation army will leave the Nasser Medical Complex having committed the crime that we have always warned against around the clock, and will leave the complex carrying the tails of disgrace, infamy and failure to achieve any of the lies and false narratives that it spreads to public opinion, and that it will not succeed in achieving any image of victory. As long as it violates international law, violates all the various international treaties, targets patients, and destroys hospitals.

>⚡️Speech highlights of Bahrain's Leading Shia Cleric Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Qassim, during the 13th anniversary of the 14 February Revolution - 2024

• Islam means resistance and construction, resistance to all evil, all deficiency, all barbarism, all injustice, everything that harms this human and degrades his worth.

As long as I belong and submit to the perfect, the perfect does not accept the deficiency that can be filled, then I have to resist. I am a Muslim, which means I am [one that] resists. A non-resisting Muslim is not perfect [in his] Islam.

• The job we are obligated to, which is resistance and construction, inevitably requires patience and effort, so this dimension entails that we should not expect comfort in jihad, resistance, and self-building.

• February 14 is not only a day for Bahrain, but rather it is a day for Bahrain, for the struggle between truth and falsehood, and a day for a nation — that is, a day for the struggle within the framework of the nation between truth and falsehood.

With this existing reality, which is getting worse due to state policy, injustice, mockery of humanity and the abolition of religion
Is it permissible according to Islamic law to stop resisting?
Is it reasonable to stop resisting?

Can the state expect - even if it resorts to any means - that this people will remain silent? 
For this people to kneel to its policies?

As long as the human being in Bahrain remains a human being, the movement will not stop and the determination for change will not be defeated or recede.

Let the state do what it does and plot the plot of the accursed Satan, for its plot is a failure, and the day of change, the day of victory, and the day of the return of dignity and the prestige of Islam and the worship of Allah Almighty to the land of Bahrain as it should be, the Islamic morals, and the achievement of complete independence from American and Israeli corruption, and blasphemous corruption throughout the land.
This day is indeed coming!

• Al-Aqsa flood began not to recede, it began to increase, not to decrease, it began to strengthen, not to weaken, it began to continue its march and destruction of the enemy and every falsehood on earth.

The old man is responsible, the healthy man is responsible, the rich is responsible, the poor is responsible, all members of the nation and to the ability of each one of them is responsible for the continuation of the flood and pushing it to a greater and greater extent.

None of us, for Gaza, for Al-Quds, for the entire Islamic nation, has an excuse, even to a small degree, to abandon the battle.

Normalization equals an alliance against Islam, Muslims, and human dignity.

People are responsible for joining the Axis of Resistance in defending, struggling, spending and sacrificing.

If all the peoples of the nation come together to overthrow the Zionist Jewish state and make it leave the land of Palestine, then this will not be difficult, God willing.

The divine victory of Imam Khomeini and what this victory produced in terms of the establishment of the Islamic State is a blessing not only for Iran, but a blessing for the entire nation.

>⚡️SUMMARY key points of Abu Obeida, Al-Qassam Brigades’ Spox speech:

• 133 days since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Flood battle, which has changed and will change the face of the region. It marked the beginning of the end for the longest and last occupation in contemporary history, leading to its defeat, disgrace, and exposure.

• The Al-Aqsa Flood continues to evolve to eliminate injustice and aggression against Al-Aqsa and the land of Isra and Mi'raj, becoming a pivotal point in the history of our nation, by the will of Allah.

• For 5 consecutive months, our steadfast Palestinian people in Gaza confront a Zionist-American war. Despite the brutalities and appalling massacres, this resilient and generous community stands resolute, refusing to surrender.

• The defeat of those incapable of subduing a population whose children teach lessons of courage to the helpless adults. Women who raise generations and embody the essence of resistance, turning it into a legendary force of the era and an iconic symbol of courage, sacrifice, and heroism.

• How can they defeat a population whose resistance is deeply embedded in their collective conscience, sharing the burdens of suffering, pain, and hope? They sacrifice their most cherished, with leaders and soldiers marching in the path of Allah, defending the holiest sanctuaries and the most significant causes.

• Our fighters in Al-Qassam Brigades and other Palestinian resistance factions continue to confront a criminal army, the likes of which have not been seen in modern history in terms of its brutality, savagery, and repugnant racist ideology. They inflict unprecedented losses on the enemy's army, a level unseen in the history of our people's revolution.

• Our fighters destroy the enemy's vehicles and armored units, engage heavily armed soldiers supported by tanks, aircraft, and military ships, setting well-prepared ambushes. They skillfully snipe at their officers and attack their soldiers from point-blank range.

• Whenever the enemy thinks it is secure in a scorched area, our fighters emerge unexpectedly, conducting high-impact operations, fighting with the help, support, and guidance of Allah.

• Simultaneously, battles with the fighters of our nation and its resistant forces continue on all fronts, expanding and intensifying in the face of the enemy's arrogance, aggression, and Nazi-like brutality.
  
• We won't delve into listing the operations by Al-Qassam Brigades, as we announce them promptly 24/7. Some fighters' field conditions delay the announcement of certain missions. We prioritize security and complex field conditions, choosing to postpone the disclosure of some operations and scenes for safety reasons.
