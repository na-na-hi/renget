While the US and UK announce that they are targeting Houthi missile depots in Yemen, i.e. targeting empty hills and fields, because the Houthis keep their weapons deep in bunkers, the Houthis continue to effectively maintain the blockade.

An explosion was reported near a ship off the Red Sea coast of Yemen, British maritime security agency UKMTO said Thursday, adding that both the vessel and crew were safe.

The ship reported "an explosion in close proximity to the vessel" east of Yemen's Aden, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations said, adding the vessel was sailing to its next port of call.

>⚡️| 🇾🇪 SUMMARY of AnsarAllah leader, AbdulMalik al-Houthi’s speech:

• The amount of explosive materials used by the Zionists against Gaza is equivalent to 4 atomic bombs that the US used against Hiroshima in Japan.

• The Zionists destroy the agricultural lands of Gaza to turn this area into an uninhabitable place, forcing its residents to migrate.

• The pride of israeli soldiers is the massacre of Palestinian children. The Zionist enemy poses a danger to all of humanity.

• Hundreds of israeli soldiers suffer from mental illnesses, and many of them flee from the battlefield.

• Where is the Arab support for the Palestinian issue?! Especially when the US president talks about providing $14 billion in aid to the Zionist regime.

• Support from Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen for Gaza continues. Hezbollah in Lebanon is expanding every day and striking blows against the Zionist enemy.

• America & Britain have admitted that the Yemeni front has been effective in influencing the economy and capabilities of the Zionists and supporting Gaza.

• The time has passed for America to threaten while others just watch.

• Today, no one fears America's threats; new strategic developments are in favor of the Islamic Ummah.

• Food supplies for the Zionist enemy passing through the Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb strait have reduced by 70%.

• The prices of goods in the israeli market have increased by 30 to 50% due to changes in the routes of its ships.

🇮🇱🇮🇳 The Israeli army has received a large number of Hermes 900 UAVs from India

India is now officially joining the US, helping Israel in the Gaza genocide.

India has reportedly delivered 20 Hermes 900 drones to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.

The India-made drones were manufactured at a private facility in Hyderabad. However, the possible use of drones in the Gaza war has caused concerns and complicated India's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

The Indian news channel TV9 Hindi reported on February 7 that the drones, manufactured in the south-central Indian city of Hyderabad, would help fulfill "Israel's needs in the Israel-Hamas war."

Defense analysts say that drones have been one of the mainstays of the Israeli military during its ongoing assault on Gaza where they are used for intelligence as well as to carry out attacks on Palestinian civilians and homes.

>⚡️#Gaza: Government Media Office:
- The occupation army stormed the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Yunis Governorate with tanks, drones, and heavily armed soldiers, shooting at the medical staff and displaced people inside, killing many citizens inside, and turning it into a cemetery and a military barracks; It is a clear and complete war crime, a crime against international law, and a crime against all international treaties.

The occupation army threatened those present with death and direct shooting, deprived them of water, food, and infant formula, and imposed harsh practices on them, which exacerbated the crisis inside the Nasser Medical Complex, and made the conditions dangerous and arousing fear and terror, in a way that clearly prevented the crews from providing medical and health services to hundreds of sick and wounded people. and displaced people, which threatens their lives.

We denounce and condemn in the strongest terms the occupation army’s storming of the Nasser Medical Complex and turning it into a military barracks. We consider this a war crime and a crime against morality and humanity. We hold the “Israeli” occupation, the international community and the United States of America fully responsible for the safety and lives of hundreds of medical staff, the wounded, the sick and the displaced. Our #Palestinian people are inside it.

We affirm that the lies that the occupation is spreading about the Nasser Medical Complex are just dirty, expendable propaganda exposed to the world, and that its claims have no basis in truth, and that they come within the framework of the occupation’s plan to completely eliminate the health sector and hospitals within its strategic plan aimed at displacing the people of the #Gaza Strip to Outside the #Gaza Strip and outside Palestine.

- We affirm that the occupation army will leave the Nasser Medical Complex having committed the crime that we have always warned against around the clock, and will leave the complex carrying the tails of disgrace, infamy and failure to achieve any of the lies and false narratives that it spreads to public opinion, and that it will not succeed in achieving any image of victory. As long as it violates international law, violates all the various international treaties, targets patients, and destroys hospitals.

>⚡️Speech highlights of Bahrain's Leading Shia Cleric Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Qassim, during the 13th anniversary of the 14 February Revolution - 2024

• Islam means resistance and construction, resistance to all evil, all deficiency, all barbarism, all injustice, everything that harms this human and degrades his worth.

As long as I belong and submit to the perfect, the perfect does not accept the deficiency that can be filled, then I have to resist. I am a Muslim, which means I am [one that] resists. A non-resisting Muslim is not perfect [in his] Islam.

• The job we are obligated to, which is resistance and construction, inevitably requires patience and effort, so this dimension entails that we should not expect comfort in jihad, resistance, and self-building.

• February 14 is not only a day for Bahrain, but rather it is a day for Bahrain, for the struggle between truth and falsehood, and a day for a nation — that is, a day for the struggle within the framework of the nation between truth and falsehood.

With this existing reality, which is getting worse due to state policy, injustice, mockery of humanity and the abolition of religion
Is it permissible according to Islamic law to stop resisting?
Is it reasonable to stop resisting?

Can the state expect - even if it resorts to any means - that this people will remain silent? 
For this people to kneel to its policies?

As long as the human being in Bahrain remains a human being, the movement will not stop and the determination for change will not be defeated or recede.

Let the state do what it does and plot the plot of the accursed Satan, for its plot is a failure, and the day of change, the day of victory, and the day of the return of dignity and the prestige of Islam and the worship of Allah Almighty to the land of Bahrain as it should be, the Islamic morals, and the achievement of complete independence from American and Israeli corruption, and blasphemous corruption throughout the land.
This day is indeed coming!

• Al-Aqsa flood began not to recede, it began to increase, not to decrease, it began to strengthen, not to weaken, it began to continue its march and destruction of the enemy and every falsehood on earth.

The old man is responsible, the healthy man is responsible, the rich is responsible, the poor is responsible, all members of the nation and to the ability of each one of them is responsible for the continuation of the flood and pushing it to a greater and greater extent.

None of us, for Gaza, for Al-Quds, for the entire Islamic nation, has an excuse, even to a small degree, to abandon the battle.

Normalization equals an alliance against Islam, Muslims, and human dignity.

People are responsible for joining the Axis of Resistance in defending, struggling, spending and sacrificing.

If all the peoples of the nation come together to overthrow the Zionist Jewish state and make it leave the land of Palestine, then this will not be difficult, God willing.

The divine victory of Imam Khomeini and what this victory produced in terms of the establishment of the Islamic State is a blessing not only for Iran, but a blessing for the entire nation.
