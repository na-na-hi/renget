## Modding Basics For Fallout 4 VR
*Updated January 2024*

This guide is focused on what I'd consider essential mods, and some recommended mods for decent VR gameplay in Fallout 4 VR. Fallout 4 VR is a separate game from standard Fallout 4. CD keys can be had for cheap from deals.gg and the like, and the game can be pirated as long as the exe isn't changed by the crack. 
It's recommended to copy over the DLC from a regular copy of Fallout 4. In your Fallout 4/Data directory, copy every file beginning with DLC to your Fallout 4 VR/Data directory. 

You probably should be using [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModOrganizer2/modorganizer/releases) to manage your mods. Use Steam community bindings, especially with anything but Oculus controllers or Vive wands. [This](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41931) may be needed if you use a non Index headset with Index controllers. Modpacks for this game are pretty bad right now, even by modpack standards.

##Recommended Essential Mods for Fallout 4 VR:
[Fallout 4 VR Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42159), [VR Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64879), and [VR Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/45167) - are dependencies for many mods
[Fallout 4 Version Check Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42497) - Allows mods made after the November 2019 patch to be loaded, but with some caveats (See below)
[DLCVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/28842) - Fixes bugs that the DLC may have in VR
[Automatron Rebuild](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/34741) - To build robots and do the Automatron quests in VR
[Fallout Priority](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/52515) - Helps performance by keeping the CPU priority high
[Buffout NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64880) - Fixes crashes and enables achievements
[MCM VR](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/354663002433388545/876390467351232532/MCM_VR.zip) - Allows you to configure mods
[Disk Cache Enabler VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/75037) - Enables disk cache, less stutter
[Baka Scrapheap](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/46340) - Allows scripts to use more memory. Mandatory for heavier mods like Sim Settlements 2.
[High FPS Physics Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/44798) - Scroll down in the downloads page to grab the VR version. Look at the .ini. Improves loading times.
[FallUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48758) and the [VR Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51556) - For a decent UI with item sorting
[Complex Item Sorter](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/48826) - To tag items for FallUI's sorting
[FRIK](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53464) - Adds a full first person body in VR. Allows you to reposition weapons and smooths out movement. Don't save in power armor.
[FRIK New Game Crash Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/71840) and/or [SKK Fast Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29227) - FRIK will crash when starting a new game. Ideally only enable FRIK after you leave the vault. 
[Virtual Holsters](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/51224/) and [Virtual Chems](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53625) - To use chems and equip weapons via holsters attached to your body. Pair with the wrist based pip boy in game settings so you never use menus in combat.
[See Through Scopes](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9476) - Better than the vanilla black scopes
[Better Scopes VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/61214) - Uses above to let you zoom in and have collimated sights
[VR Weapon Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/64610) - Fixes for See Through Scopes on a lot of mods
[Kabuto VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35909) - Adds immersive power helmets
[Binaural 3D Surround Sound](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39692/) - Decent spatial audio
[VR Perfkit](https://github.com/fholger/vrperfkit), [Reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46999), or [Fallout 4 Upscaler VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/73715) - Individually or in some combination, for sharpening, upscaling, and better anti aliasing if you need. The game is pretty blurry by default so at least sharpening is nice. SMAA via Reshade and DLAA via Upscaler VR can't hurt compared to \>TAA

##Also Consider:
[Insignificant Object Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9835) - Removes twigs and stones that keep your drawcalls high
[Fallout 4 VR FPS Stabilizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/65961) - Adjusts settings on the fly based on your framerate. Can help in areas like Corvega or downtown Boston.
[PipBoy Light VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/29245) - Makes your PipBoy Light a handy flashlight
[Lightweight Lighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57680) - All in one lighting and weather improvements without killing compatibility or performance. Darker interiors make the above mod matter more.
[Bullet Time VR](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/72502) - If you really don't like VATS. Allows (most) VATS perks to still work.
[Optimized Vanilla Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/1204) or [Low-End Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/68112/) - If you are hurting for VRAM.
[F4 Enhanced Color Correction](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/5060) - Adjusts LUTs to improved contrast. Everyone can enjoy better colors with no performance hit.
[Generating LODs](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/4162) - Being able to see in the distance well really helps with immersion. Make sure to use the [VR LOD fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/42870) and don't generate LODs for Diamond City or Goodneighbor.

##ini Tweaks:
In Documents\My Games\Fallout4VR consider editing Fallout4Custom.ini
Tweak these numbers to your liking to have decent recoil and give yourself a reason to two hand weapons with FRIK.
>\[VR\]
>fRecoilMaxHorizDeg=3
>fRecoilMaxVertDeg=100
>fRecoilVertMultiplier=2.00
To move in the direction your head is facing
>\[VRInput\]
>bUseWandDirectionalMovement=0
To make your HUD not blurry on high res headsets
>\[VRUI\]
>iVRUIRenderTargetHeight=4096
>iVRUIRenderTargetWidth=4096
To make hair not glow
>\[HairLighting\]
>fHairPrimSpecPow=2.0
>fHairPrimSpecScale=0.01
>fHairPrimSpecShift=0.26
>fHairSecSpecScale=0.01
>fHairSecSpecPow=2.0
>fHairSecSpecShift=0.26
To make TAA less blurry
>\[Display\]
>fTAAPostOverlay=0.675
>fTAAPostSharpen=0.675

>fTAAHighFreq=0.8000
>fTAALowFreq=0.5000

##Compatibility:
Unlike Skyrim VR, Fallout 4 VR doesn't have ENB. There is no support for .esl files either. Any .esl plugins need to be renamed to .esp if you want to load them.
 
Mods made after the November 2019 update might have issues with overwriting base game records. If you are installing newer .esp mods I would recommend running [xEdit 4.0.4](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/releases/tag/xedit-4.0.4) with the -IgnoreESL flag. After everything loads, look for the error "is being overridden by record". If you find plugins that report the error, run [xEdit 4.0.3](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit/releases/tag/xedit-4.0.3). Then right click the offending plugins, click "Renumber formIDs from", and type in "800". After that save your changes. Mods that rely on the edited plugins won't work anymore. None of the mods in this guide have this issue.

F4SE plugins need to be either be NG plugins (ie Buffout NG) or specifically compiled for VR. This means that XDI and mods that require it (Fallout London ;_;) won't work in VR. 

UF4OP causes issues in VR, such as softlocks in the DLCs. Please don't use it. Arthmoor is a faggot.
