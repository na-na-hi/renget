>School trip to Okinawa
>The entire school is excited
>That American boy is one of the most excited
>He really likes the prospect of R&R
>After how hard he's worked to learn with me, he deserves it
>I could use a vacation myself
>Plan to catch some sun, play some volleyball, maybe go for a swim
>We change into our swimsuits and head for the beach
>I wonder where that American boy is...
>Oh my
>I knew he was well-built, but I had no idea he was THIS well-built
>Kami, you could probably grate cheese on his stomach
>How does he eat as much as he does and stay so fit?
>...I'm staring, aren't I?
>He turns to look at me and flashes that wonderful smile of his
>I blush more
>Turn away to pretend I wasn't staring at him
>He walks toward me
>"Wow, you look great."
>"Thanks. So do you."
>Did
>Did I just say that out loud?
>Suddenly I want the sand to swallow me up
>He laughs that good-natured laugh of his
>"Well, the water looks nice", he says, changing the subject. "Let's jump in!"
>His enthusiasm is so infectious
>We run to the water and plunge in
>My friends comment that this is the liveliest they've ever seen me at the beach
>A couple hours later, I'm taking a rest
>Sitting on the sand with one of my friends
>She's eccentric, but really nice
>Watching that nice American boy enjoy himself in the water
>He's been doing that practically the entire time
>Kami, he's got so much endurance and energy
>I only saw him stop twice
>Once to use the bathroom, and once to help rebuild an upset little girl's sandcastle
>And judging by how he calmed her down, he's good with kids too
>Why is he so perfect?
>"You like him, don't you?"
>My head snaps to look at her
>"How... how did you..."
>"Don't act so surprised. I'm a weirdo, not an idiot."
>That's true
>She's a lot more perceptive than she seems at first
>"You know, I think he's been good for you. You're not so shy anymore."
>"You... you think so?"
>"Yeah. I think everyone's noticed, though I'm not sure they know why."
>"...Please don't tell him. Not yet, anyway."
>"I wasn't going to. But personally, I think you should go for him. He really bring out the best in you. The time he's been at our school is the happiest I've ever seen you."
>"You think so? ...Do you think he'd want to date me?"
>"Honestly, I think he probably would."
>"What... what if he doesn't?"
>"Well, you'll never know unless you confess."
>"I... I don't know... I'm afraid I might-"
>"Come on, do you want to spend the rest of your life kicking yourself and wondering what might've been? If you don't at least try to nab him, you'll regret it for the rest of your life."
>...Kuso
>She's right
>I need to make my move
>Alright, I'll do it
>I'll tell him how I feel
>...When the time is right, of course
