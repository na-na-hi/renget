>your friend asks you if they can ship a package to your house since its closer and cheaper. You tell him to just mail it to the agency, its gonna cost next to nothing there.
>the package comes when you are spending time with Mio (Like a good manager should), you tell your homie you are gonna open it to check if everything is in order. Mio looks over your shoulder, curious, before freaking out
>What the fuck.png
>Whats the problem? Its just a bunch of dog clothes, chewing toys, some treats and
>a dog collar?
>Mio looks utterly nervous, as you take of the collar from the box
>Ask her whats the problem. She just tells you its a sensitive theme for kemonos
>Two days later, after your friend picked up the stuff, Mio is still weird around you
>Decide to investigate. Get exposed to a new fetish
>Every single almond in your body is activated
>You carefully prepare yourself, make sure Mio has calmed down before striking
>''Miosha... you are good with pets right? could you come help me pick something for my friend's pet?''
>Mio is oblivious to the truth,thinking its a date with her beloved manager you take her to a mall to get some dog toys
>You suggest a walk, down a nice street
>Until you reach a very obvious shop, that sells goods for kemonos
>The jig is up, she looks mortified yet somehow aroused at the same time
>Ask her if she can help you choose a very special collar
>she cant even speak
>you tell her to wait outside if she's nervous. You go in as the bell from the door rings
>a few moments later, the bell rings again, and a Sweaty and almost hyperventilating Mio is behind you
>you gently take her hand and guide her down the aisle
>''What do you think? i dont want the poor thing to choke, but a loose one will definitely look bad yknow? it has to wear it everyday after all''
>she just mumbles through every single question you ask, her face is flushed and her tail cant stop waging in all directions, something she's triying to subtly stop with her hands
>you keep peltering her defenses, keep pressing. Soft enough to weaken but not hard enough to make her run away
>Until it happens, as you are showing her another collar, her eyes snap to one in the shelves before snapping back to you. A little too fast
>You can hear her holding her breath as you pick the Black collar from the shelve and toy with it a bit
>''This one looks great! what do you think?'' She mumbles again, before you take a step in her direction
>''It even has a place to hang a tag'' you take another step, your pants suffering to keep your erection in check, she looks at you with a terrified yet pleading look
>You step in front of her and tell her that this is the last chance, that she can turn around and forget this happened
>She stays there
>You gently put the collar in her neck, she's vibrating, her face red and her entire body emitting body heat
>CLICK!
>You come closer, your erection rubbing against her stomach
>''There is a love hotel down the street'' you whisper
>She whimpers
>Fuck
>You pay for the collar and a tag with shaking hands, Mio barely keeping her hands to herself
>you drag her as fast as you can out of the shop and into the alley, forget the love hotel
>The next day, in the office, you both experience a walk of shame
>You, full of kiss and bite marks, not to mention the multiple scratches you sport all over your body
>Mio, somehow proud despite looking red like a tomato, sitting on her desk with her new collar and Tag
