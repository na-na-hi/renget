    Behind the cryptic name is in fact a page of the general information for the membership content by Nerissa. The membership content list was created preventively as the possibility of more people joining the Jailbirds ranks in the future and that might be interested in supporting Nerissa in her projects via joining her membership. We'll provide a list and details for the membership in this page and just for the sake of it, we'll just say that the membership streams will contain Zatsudan parts - so read the disclaimer of the Zatsudan parts - we know there will be questions about this eventually. The current level of production for Members content is still unknown but we'll get there once we'll get more informations.
	Another word of warning: we're not planning to store nor making a list of any posts from the members section. Any screenshot of member posts is also excluded, that would be unfair for anyone that spent the minimum effort for supporting Nerissa and it's not highly regarded either.

![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png)  ** *Disclamer regarding member zatsus or zatsudan parts* **
    This list exists mainly provide a brief overview over Nerissa's members streams. Due to the sensible nature of the Zatsudan bits ,which will inevitably happen in the case of the members streams (even in non-specified Zatsudan streams) and will contain topics that might be too personal or more personal. The list cannot be a replacement for members content nor is it meant to be a replacement, which is why in that case, the description will be a little vague and a full overview for these streams cannot be provided. There's also a chance these topics might also end-up in non-members content.

####![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Membership General Info
The main uptake of the general infos will come from the Membership Opening stream itself
[![【MEMBERSHIP OPENING】I guess you can come in my house, Jailbird~🎼](https://files.catbox.moe/7u77qw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQaUs-vNgXo)
This section will serve as a tl;dr, although it's still advised to watch the stream itself. Although, the list will be very much the stream recommendation page - it will be evolutive as time goes by. So more informations will be provided.

#####Tiers
There's 3 tiers for the membership:
- Jailbird +
- Jailbird Ultra
- Jailbird Ultra+
Each tier comes with their own price (Jailbird+ being at 4.99$/€, Jailbird Ultra being at 9.99$/€ and Jailbird Ultra+ being at 24.99$/€). A person with a lower tier of membership has the possibility to upgrade to a higher tier.

#####What type of content is expected for Nerissa's mengens and for the membership overall?
In theory, there will be no difference in content nor perks even in different degree of membership support - theoretically because tiered member stream is still a possibility. Everybody will get the same emotes to use and will get access to the badges. Everyone joining the membership will also have access to the [members special tab](https://www.youtube.com/@NerissaRavencroft/membership) in Nerissa's YouTube page in order to get exclusive updates (membership posts). What is to be expected is also ['goodies' as she puts it during the membership opening stream](https://youtu.be/CQaUs-vNgXo?t=1260) so potentially (monthly) commissioned wallpapers at some point.

As far as streaming content goes, ASMR was the first thing cited as the possible first stream. Membership streams aren't just limited to ASMR - it can be in fact very varied : it also includes zatsudans, karaokes (unarchived and archived), watchalongs, behind-the-scenes special streams (for projects, unique breakdown or musical production), some sporadic gaming streams with members (although specific to some type of games with special permissions).
