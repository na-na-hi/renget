    Behind the cryptic name is in fact a page of the general information for the membership content by Nerissa. The membership content list was created preventively as the possibility of more people joining the Jailbirds ranks in the future and that might be interested in supporting Nerissa in her projects via joining her membership. We'll provide a list and details for the membership in this page and just for the sake of it, we'll just say that the membership streams will contain Zatsudan parts - so read the disclaimer of the Zatsudan parts - we know there will be questions about this eventually. The current level of production for Members content is still unknown but we'll get there once we'll get more informations.
	Another word of warning: we're not planning to store nor making a list of any posts from the members section - that would be unfair for anyone that spent the minimum threshold for supporting Nerissa and it's not highly regarded either.

![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png)  ** *Disclamer regarding member zatsus or zatsudan parts* **
    This list exists mainly provide a brief overview over Nerissa's members streams. Due to the sensible nature of the Zatsudan bits ,which will inevitably happen in the case of the members streams (even in non-specified Zatsudan streams) and will contain topics that might be too personal or more personal, the list cannot be a replacement for members content nor is it meant to be a replacement. Which is why in that case, the description might be a little vague and a full overview for these streams will not be provided. There's also a chance these topics might also end-up in non-members content.

####![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Membership General Info
The main uptake of the general infos will come from the Membership Opening stream itself

This section will serve as a tl;dr, although it's still advised to watch the stream itself. Although, the list will be very much the stream recommendation page - it will be evolutive as time goes by. So more informations will be provided.
