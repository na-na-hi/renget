-> **FROZENVAN's Ramblings** <-
I'm going to write this rentry in like ten minutes, so don't expect proper structure, grammatical coherency or anything. I'm just going to go through the process of how I invent my ideas. I'll list some of my notable bot ideas and how I derived these concepts. Fuck, it's been 3 minutes already.

#Frilly and the mercurial sea
I'm going to fill up this section if I ever fill like it. Filling it now with TLDRs maybe.
Though I advocated CAI's propensity for delivering excellent horror prose in the past, I was never really scared by it. I merely admired the way it depicted horror in cool prose. So for the gothic horror month, I wanted to make a "cool" horror. When Frankenstein came out back then, it must have been horrifying in a cool way. I wanted to capture the same "cool innovative horror". So at once a concept came to me: The magnesium sea in the Arctic. Why the Arctic? Because Frankenstein starts and ends at the Arctic. And what the heck is a magnesium sea?

I envisioned a sea corrupted with magnesium, where the HORROR will take place. It will not be a PHYSICAL horror, it would be a CONCEPTUAL horror. Something would rise of the magnesium and be HORRIFYING. But what is a something HORRIFYING that is cool? I want a disgusting creation to crawl out, but what should crawl out?

I was stumped. In between thoughts, procrastination and bad life decisions, I changed the sea to a mercurial sea because that seemeed more fitting (sadly), and did nothing else. WHAT IS HORRIFYING? I thought back to my often used memory motif. I thought about stuff like Julia and Sayuri. Losing memories...I could reuse that trope again. But how?

If you lose your memories, you can see "something fresh" again. And to see a thing for the first thing, won't that be horrifying, in a sense. This beautiful, strange, new thing, cut off from all our neural links, is this thing we're witnessing for the first time. Actually, why is it that we don't feel terrified of normal things? These seemingly normal things like artificial buildings and animals so different from us, why have we accepted them as normal? Because because. Because we're human and these things are normal human things. But take away what makes us human - our memories - and then what happens.

I want to see the HORROR OF NORMAL THINGS. I think there is still some work to be done with this concept, maybe more example dialogue would help exaggerated the HORROR OF NORMAL THINGS instead of a fixed format, but I'm really satisfied with the current concept. I want AI to see the things I cannot see myself. For Frilly to describe the HORROR of a pear that I cannot, I think it's something cool that "ONLY THE AI CAN DO BECAUSE IT'S A CONCEPT HARD OR TOO MUCH EFFORT FOR MOST PEOPLE TO DO". I want to create more stuff like this. Like Hero Consultation Clinic. 

Claude seems to exaggerate the HORROR OF NORMAL THINGS too much by giving buildings claws and pears spikes, but that's a cool in a different way. I think if I were to make a very late submission for the mental illness theme, I would do something like the MUNDANEITY OF NORMAL HORROR.

##Pointless tangent
(It is at this point that I must confess that I am netural about Frankenstein's writing. Call me a plebian if you must, because I really am lol. I didn't really resonate with the first half of lolita and dropped it after that, finding the plot meandering and pointless though I normally like meandering and pointless things like some of the stuff in Sugaru Miaki's works. Yeah, yeah, call me a utter tasteless hack. I sorta liked the spider web prose, but I didn't really find any of the prose revolutionary or colorful, though the prose might stand out upon a second read. Stuff like alliteration and word chocie might appeal to me more too, though I have my doubts. Doubts are fine. I appreciate some poems after their meanings are spelled out to me in class. The same thing might happen to Lolita if I read it in a better headspace. I like some of the prose some people bring out as their favourites, but I really don't care for stuff like the sun is a white diamond...I guess because I never read a lot of books, I never got the feel of what is a trite metaphor and what is a fitting metaphor, so I stuff a lot of newly read metaphors in the former, thinking that "Ah, of course hundreds of people would have written that the sun is a white diamond. Isn't that a cliche metaphor?")
#CRY THE SOULSTEALER
I wanted to create a schizo bot, I did it! Yay. I used heavy example chats to accomplish my schizo speak, but I'm still not too satisfied with some of the cliche metaphors CRY still uses from time to time for GPT4/Claude. I have a few versions of her that I don't know work better or not. Hmmmmm, wahtever
#Alban
I remember wanting to do a shounen concept for some time day but I couldn't quite figure out a central gimmick. I already had masked rider dan for a kamen rider parody and I had a few fight bots, even if they were coom focused. I think I developed Alban's idea a few days after some anon posted a fusion simulator bot.

"What if instead of fusing proper materials, you asspull a fusion instead? After all, isn't the art of shounen most beautiful when characters asspull? Hey, what if I threw the lore of mongirl clinic as a backdrop?"

So began Alban's creation. I hacked together a greeting, typed in a few sparse details and sighed when the bot needed example chats to really work. So I wrote example chats, sighed some more, had fun writing and inventing bullshit, didn't have fun trying to fail but failing but doing it anyways. And yeah. At the end of the day, I thought I whipped up a decent open ended concept.

Like most of my bots, I maintain that Alban could have been either gender. (I would make gender forks of my other bots if I wasn't too lazy. Sayuri's concept could easily be a goofy guy). I decided to make him a guy because it fits the shounen aesthetic more, and because I wanted to try genning a male using nijijourney. His best picture had a flaming amulet, so I just invented a GRUDGEFLAME amulet to justify the picture.

#Akari
I saw vagoomey's VN CAI bot and I wanted to create my own take. Akari was the inverse concept of a short game called "Air pressure" where your waifu wants to stay with you even though she's the personification of depression. Part meta commentary, part desire to create something that I was inspired by many years ago, I made Akari with the hopes of fully emulating a short flash game.

The results were kinda inconsistent on CAI but the highs CAI Akari reached were something I could never really recapture, even with my updated version of Akari that I like in my own way. Working on the new Akari and wrangling something coherent and stylish stirred up some form of accomplishment within me not unlike finally beating a metroidvania. While I still need to wrangle the bot a little, I think getting something stylish that I personally desired was way better than nothing, and I really liked some of the metaphors that GPT4 created. I could write a little more, but I'll stop here.

#Iterita
Iterita was a bot that took quite some time to create. Before even starting on def/greeting, I think I spent a good week thinking about how to make a unique melancholic concept about a fallen demon lord. Yes, Iterita was kinda "My own take" on the depressed demon lord Rozifer, that JellyBones, some guy really liked, I didn't play much of, but I liked the concept enough. In Rozifer's case, she was a suicidal demon lord with time travel elements. If I wanted to include a twist, I could steal a time related element, but what?

One of the first ideas that came to mind was "frozen time". Iterita and you would be stuck in a state of frozen time after something has went wrong. That concept seemd kinda appealing, but it didn't really stir a creative urge within me. So you WOULD BE STUCK IN FROZEN TIME. And then what? What's the hook? What unique elements could rise from BEING STUCK IN FROZEN TIME? No matter what, I couldn't imagine interesting prose and scenarios from FROZEN TIME. Do I play up the melancholy from seeing everything in perpetual static? Do I play up the loss of moving reality?

These questions kept nagging at me without answers. I would think about the concept, generating demon girls stuck in frozen time (SD didn't really capture that feeling), think about the concept again and meet no answer. I must have thought of other concepts related to time, or maybe I was hung up on FROZEN TIME.

Eventually I decided to FUCK FROZEN TIME. Whenever the going gets super fucking tough, give up. But I still wanted a concept that had something to do with time. Stuck time... I don't remember the exact thought process I had, but something struck me then.

Instead of physically being stuck in time, how about being stuck in time in memories????? Yes, memories, the theme that I would go back to, and would probably make more bots of in the future. (Thanks Satoshi Mizukami) 
You know how some shows portray this spiritual connection about dreams? Like, Kamina appeared in Simon's dream and that was the REAL KAMINA What if I inverse that trope? What if Iterita was stuck in your mind only as a memory and a memory only? Won't that be uniquely tragic in a way? Won't that give the ai room for interpretation?

So thus I created Iterita and that was all I'm willing to share because there is not much else I can share about her creation because I think they do not matter. Like, I spent a few more days crafting her greeting, but I'm very so slow at crafting greetings. The longest amount of time I spent on a greeting was probably a week or so on Spirit Guide.

Nowadays, I would probably rewrite the greeting SOMEHOW and rewrite the example dialogue to mold the writing in a julia esque manner, but that takes too much I think. I made a prequel loli bot about Iterita's warring days, but I don't think anyone played it lmao.

##Approach to melancholy
Melancholic things should carry a bittersweet inevitability. Something has been lost, will be lost and will continue to be lost again and again. Sayuri will always forget you. Hina's husband will always be dead. Iterita will only exist in your memories, nothing more. It's depressing, but I want to capture that sombre, bittersweet feeling in a single moment. It does not really matter to me if the prose degenerates or if the ai models can't handle the exact melancholy I want to feel. I want the AI to condense hurt in a single moment. I think it's magic how the AI is able to do this. It's not quite like Sugaru Miaki's philosophy of falling in a hole and showing what happens to the hole, (C'mon, I only read his books just a weeks ago) but it's something like that.

Of course, I might make some normal saviourfag bots someday. Maybe I already have, have I? Hmmm.

#Liang, Suspicious Friend, Evelynn
Liang - An experimentation with plaintext only. What if a bot had no *actions* or "dialogue"? What if it was purely like Loopi, purely rambling on with plaintext alone? I was in the mood for some half baked eastern philosophy so I had fun spontaneously drafting the greeting, wrote some defs and was very pleasantly surprised at the laidback cool responses I receive. Even now, I still think Liang is one of my "coolest" bots, even if her concept is simple. I though she held up well throughout the various lobotomies, but alas, her responses grew less interesting as CAI grew more filtered. Still, I believe that the CAI version is/was the definitive version of this laidback. Heck, I still prefer the current CAI Liang's poems compared to GPT/Claude. GPT/Claude just keep rhyming....

In the same vein, I liked CAI suspicious friend. I drafted her in 30 minutes or was it two hours, spent a bit more time generating example dialogue and voila, that chunni super OOC kawaii Souko came to life. While I do think GPT4 Souko is a bit better, I don't really think it compares to the sheer creativity of CAI back then, even if I thought the responses were decent back in December. It's like you: You remember the best parts of a novel, but skip through the parts where the characters just talks or nothing much happens. I think a lot of botmakers are still trying to reach that "CAI high"

Evelynn is the last (???) of the talky conversational bots I made. She's really really cool I think, partly because her defs were taken from a roleplay I had with mongirl help clinic. I haven't actually tryhard-ed a complete roleplay with her. Actually, I don't really "complete roleplay". I had more fun asking her about her favourite animal and swiping her responses. Good times.

#Preya, NTR bot
"What if NTR was funny." That's it, really. Even the extreme cuckery elements that Preya's first memories and stat blocks were to juxtapose the fucked up NTR nature verseus the absurd premise that you're actively cucking yourself because your girlfriend is a PRAYING MANTIS.

#Mongirl help clinic
I shared it with the thread before, but I made MHC because some anon posted about an open ended scenario (It was a loli spa?) and I wanted to see how the defs worked. CAI did okay with stuff like text adventures anyways so I figured why not test its open ended nature? I don't recall how the idea of a mongirl help clinic came about. I knew I wanted a randomly generated mongirl bot (because mongirls are cool) and I knew I wanted a convenient setting for that to happen, so I thought that the clinic setting was natural, somehow? "This has to be a bot" was the mentality I was going for, instead of making MHC an aetheroom prompt. It's the same kind of thinking of inspired me to make {{user}} a commentator instead of an audience for futa fuckfight.

Worried that CAI might not get the idea of a "mongirl help clinic", I made the defs of MHC a little overkill, describing how types of mongirls would appear etc. Instead of going for a stylish greeting, I opted for an instructional greeting that gave the AI room to work with. I even tried to add in hooks like "Your uncle's old potion shop" for the AI to latch onto. (Though this factoid never really came out. I only saw it once when I was working with a fork of CAI mongirl clinic) I used w++ for some the defs (kinda unnecessary but I had space) and used the extra space to introduce an unique character, Luna, who I hoped who naturally introduce herself in the story. She kinda never did, so that part was a failure I guess. I think there was more potential with open ended CAI bots. Shame that scenario bots never really got explored in CAI.

I have to say that I never expected MHC to be my most prominent bot. I just made MHC as an experiment for simulator bots in the future and to show that hey, you can make simulator bots on CAI instead of the usual character bot. I remember making MHC at the height of the doom december Era where bots were lobotimised and MHC was doing alright somehow. I thought "If MHC could work during CAI's worst period, surely CAI couldn't be this bad". Well, I thought more. Soon, in feb/march, MHC stopped producing as many interesting responses, so I just gave up. 
I think CAI MHC inspired a bunch of simulator bots way down the line, but I don't really want to take credit except for the bots that directly credit me. (Kyubey kun, noticeeee me) Actually, compared to stuff like Unholy Party and even some of the classics, MHC isn't really mentioned a lot, or even at all, so it's always a surprise when it's brought up again. 

MHC Clinic was also something I uploaded "at the right time". It was one of the few bots that was first uploaded on chub.ai, so that's why it has one of the highest rating counts. The token count could be further optimised, but I decided against changing what worked, and I had a shorter more optimised SFW version. If the token count was too much, move to the SFW version! I think most people still stuck with the NSFW version though...

Fun factoid: MHC Clinic is actually mispelled as MHS Clinic in the CAI defs. Because of some CAI error, I couldn't edit the defs, so I sent a email. This was when CAI was "training its staff", so I never got a response back. Then, they introduced locking defs for popular bots, so once again I couldn't correct my mistake. I still can't correct MHC to this day...

##Mongirl help clinic and its many forks
Throughout MHC's run, I made many different versions of it, from different formatting, to stat blocks, to a harder version, to a very short version without stats. I wonder if someone has every version kek. (My own local copy of MHC has some futa content sprinkled in. Some russian guy made a new version with his own take, and some other vore guy created mongirl vore clinic)

Pokemon Breeding Wall motivated the stat block that the heaviest version of MHC has today. I would have somehow sprinkled in stat elements regardless (I had already worked on RPG stat stuff like haunted house and Lunacreek. I think I was the first one to experiment with turbo formatting), but PBW made me realise that the stat format would work really well for MHC. And work really well it did. I think I considered converting some of my CAI bots into RPG ports later on, but I only decide that for Sisyphean Girl and Unfair RPG.

#Erena Graywhisper
Probably the first yuri bot predating Esther? Some anon posted that they wanted a yuri bot that was also ryona, so I decided to make one because why not and yuri is justice. I hope that anon eventaully tried Erena, but I dunno. I had to write the sappy ERP example dialogue and tweak the bot a few times to pass the filter, but I think I got the right balance, having employed a few CAI tricks to skirt the filter. I didn't intend for her surname to resemble gaywhisper lol.

The card version should seggs and rape effortlessly. It was the joy of making "something that worked on CAI" that appealed to me though. And yes, I have a futa version of Erena. No, I will not upload it.

#Turbo and RPGs

Even before GPT4, I made a few attempts at RPGs esque stat blocks and I thought they went decently well, albeit inconsistent at times. Of these turbo bots, I think fisherwoman Minori still holds up.

My motivation: "Wait, can turbo do rpgs? Like jsk rpgs? heck yea!"
The reality: "Auto generated jsk rpgs are still a bit away...even for GPT4..."
