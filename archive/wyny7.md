As the classes at Shiketsu High School came to an end, Suzuki Nene, with her carefree gait, strolled through the bustling campus. Her steps were light, and she hummed a song as she made her way across the school grounds.

The campus itself was a sprawling expanse of well-maintained pathways and vibrant gardens. Tall buildings, mixing traditional japanese and modern architecture, towered around her, housing classrooms, training facilities workshops.

The air was filled with the hum of youthful energy as students hurriedly made their way to various activities. First-year heroes-in-training chatted animatedly, their backpacks filled with textbooks and hero costumes. Nene, relishing her free time, took pleasure in wandering through this vibrant atmosphere.

Continuing her journey, Nene navigated through the labyrinthine hallways of the school. The walls were adorned with motivational posters and framed photographs showcasing the achievements of Shiketsu alumni.

The sound of distant music caught her attention, drawing her towards the school's music club room. As she approached, she could hear the melodic strains of a piano drifting through the door. Intrigued, she poked her head inside, grinning mischievously as she caught the attention of the musicians. A cheeky wink and a playful wave, and she was gone. The band played with more energy after she left.

With a final stretch and a satisfied sigh, Suzuki Nene concluded her leisurely walk. She had reached her destination: Class 1-D.

Most students had already left the classroom or were in the process of doing so. Nene's looked around before her gaze fell upon Yui Sagara.

"Nee~ Yui-chan! Fancy meeting you here," Nene exclaimed, her voice laced with a teasing tone.

"Ugh. What do you want?" answered Yui in a harsh tone.

"Oh come on, do I really need a reason to come see my not-so-secret crush?"

"Nope. Not doing this. Don't start with that." said Yui as her attention went back to the papers on top of her desk.

"Fi~ne" answered Nene, grabbing an empty chair and moving it closer so she could seat next to Yui.

They stayed like that for a few minutes. Yui was struggling to finish an asignment, and Nene was happily looking at her. However, after seeing her kouhai's serious expression as she focused on her school work the catgirl couldn't contain herself for long.

"ʸᵘⁱ⁻ᶜʰᵃⁿ~"

Hearing Nene's voice and feeling her breath so close to her ear surprised Yui, who almost jumped from her chair.

"What the hell is wrong with you??!" 

"Want help with that assignment?" Yui's anger was ineffective against Nene "It'd be faster if I help you out. After that we can go grab a bite..."

Judging by Yui's scowl, she wasn't fully convinced. Yet.

"... and it'll be my treat~" finished Nene.

"Hey, there you are!" said Inigo "We were about to call you to see if you were still coming"

"Hey what's up Sagara. Didn't know you were coming." said Bobby.

This wasn't what Yui had in mind when Nene invited her to eat. The guys were having a barbecue in a clearing in the woods. Bobby had already set a camping table, and she could see Inigo bringing plates with the help of his small dragon Gigan. Hifumi and Sandatsu were talking besides a grill and a couple of coolers, all set on the shore of a very small stream.

The tantalizing aroma of sizzling food filled the air, instantly whetting their appetites, and causing the group to move closer to the grill. The talked among each other, several conversations taking place at the same time.

"I call dibs on those skewer things!" said Bobby.

"Nuh-uh" responded Yui.

"Woah, there's more food than I thought!" said the catgirl senpai.

"The hell you mean "Nuh-uh"?" asked the tall american.

"It means they're mine"

"You see senpai, our meat budget was kind of low, but one should never underestimate Sandy's hunting skills." explained Hifumi.

"The words "meat budget" sound incredibly cursed" added Inigo, who was helping preparing some veggies.

"How did you guys even find a place like this?" asked Yui.

"Inigo discovers all sorts of cool places when he's flying around" said Nene, while the blonde boy and his dragon gave a thumbs up "By the way guys isn't this grill different than the one you used last time?"

"Oho? That's a keen eye you got there senpai" said Hifumi "This was built by us! It's the BBQ MARK 2!!!!"

"If this is number two then what happened to the first one?" asked Yui.

"We don't want to talk about it..."
"It's complicated..."
"I don't think we can get into that right now..."
"Classified information..."

Said all of the boys at the same time, averting their eyes.

"Anyway, why don't we decide who gets the yakitori playing rock paper scissors~?" suggested Nene.

"Yakitori?" asked Bobby.

"The skewers" explained Hifumi.

"Oh yeah? Lets do it! Today is the day we finally beat you senpai!" announced Bobby. Nene had never lost at games of chance against her kouhai, thanks to the misfortune she could cause with her quirk. Something she kept quiet about of course.

"Ohh? My cute kouhai thinks he can beat me?" responded the senpai.

"Why the hell are you joining, Nene?" said Yui.

"What's this~? Grumpy because you don't think you can win against me?" said Nene with a devilish smile.

"... You'll see. Those skewers are as good as mine." responded Yui, answering Nene's challenge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nene ended up winning at rock paper scissors, but they didn't stop there. After that they decided to play UNO. The game was going well, until they spent around ten minutes arguing about the rules. One talking about how they had always played one way, other saying that the rules were written in the box the cards came in. Classic UNO time.

The sun-drenched day had ignited an extra spark of energy within Bobby, his excitement palpable as he challenged their senpai once again.

"Wasting our time with this won't get us anywhere! Nene-senpai, I challenge you to..." he went to grab something from his bag "a dodgeball match!" said as he retrieved a red ball from the container.

Hifumi's eyes lit up with enthusiasm, and Inigo's energy mirrored Bobby's excitement. Yui and Nene exchanged amused glances, knowing they were in for a spirited game.

"You two better bring your A-game to stand a chance against us!" said Inigo, loosening his tie "Hifumi, you're the team leader"

"Why not Bobby? He was the one who suggested it!" responded Hifumi.

"Your strats are better" answered the american boy.

"Your drive is contagious!" said Inigo.

"If you lose then they can blame you" added Sandatsu, who was still cooking.

As the group prepared for their epic dodgeball match, Yui's quirk came into play, providing an innovative solution for marking the boundaries of their makeshift court. With a flick of her wrist, delicate threads spun from her fingertips, creating intricate patterns that crisscrossed through the air.

"I guess that means we're on the same team"

"Yup! Let's do our best, Yui-chan~" said Nene.



The teams lined up on opposite sides of the makeshift dodgeball court. Bobby gripped the ball tightly in his hand, a determined expression on his face. "Alright, game on!" Bobby passed the ball to Hifumi, letting the leader do the honors and start the things up.

With a swift throw, Hifumi launched the dodgeball toward Yui and Nene. Yui's reflexes kicked in as she dodged the incoming projectile with a quick sidestep. Nene, on the other hand, opted for a more playful approach, waiting until the last second before intercepting the throw, grabbing the ball with finesse.

With a smirk, she retaliated, sending the ball sailing toward Inigo, who narrowly dodged it with a dramatic leap. Bobby grabbed the ball next, and with his strength overflowing because of all the sunlight his throw was incredibly fast, making Nene dodge this time.

Yui swiftly tied a thin red thread to the dodgeball when she went to retrieve it, its color blending seamlessly with the ball itself. Nene, with a mischievous glint in her eyes, nodded in approval. They were ready to put their secret weapon into action.

Yui launched the modified dodgeball  toward Inigo, who dodged by executing a graceful dolphin dive. But just as the ball left Yui's hand, Nene tugged on the thread, altering its trajectory mid-throw. The dogeball, swinging in a pendulum motion, was about to hit Hifumi!

He stumbled backward, and would have dodged it if not for the fact that he stepped on Inigo's (very stylish) necktie, being the first one hit by the ball!

*Imagine the following scene with dramatic shading and everything*

As Hifumi took the full force of the dodgeball, he clutched his chest, staggering backward as if he had been struck by a mighty blow. Inigo and Bobby, ever the theatrical duo, rushed to his side, their expressions filled with faux anguish.

"Ah, my comrades," Hifumi spoke, his voice trembling with as he acted like some sort of wounded soldier. "Looks like... this might be it for me..."

Inigo dropped to one knee, his eyes filled with solemnity "Bro! We won't let it end like this!"

Bobby continued the dramatic performance "Your sacrifice shall not be in vain! We will win those skewer thingies, for you!"

"Heh... I told you those... are called yakitori..." said Hifumi, before he pretended to pass out.

"I hope there's yakitori for you in heaven, bro..." uttered Inigo.

The girls were watching the melodrama unfolding before them "Are they always like this?" asked Yui, leaning a bit closer to Nene.

"Yup! I think it's very cute how they have fun like that~" answered the catgirl.

"Food's ready" said Sandatsu, aproaching the group.

"But we still haven't finish-" Bobby lost his train of thought when he saw that his friend was cleaning blood and feathers off his hands with water from the stream "What the hell man?"

"I caught a duck while you guys were playing, and used it to make more skewers."

"I have really worked up an apetite!" said Nene.

"Same" added Hifumi, dropping the dramatic performance.

"Well, I guess it's pointless if there are more skewers now" said Bobby.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The group settled around the table. Apart from the popular skewers, there were also ribs, steak and burgers, and a lone salad.

"Primitivism be damned, my boy can work a grill." joked Hifumi.

Bobby, taking a sip of his drink, grinned at Sandatsu. "Man, this is some top-notch stuff!"

"Cooking is an art form, and the grill is my canvas." answered Sandatsu. His friends chuckled. "By the way Inigo can you get my drink from the cooler?"

"Sure thing man" Gigan opened the lid of the cooler for Inigo, who retrieved a large glass bottle of milk and handed it to his friend "Definetly an uncommon choice though"

Sandatsu took a long sip from the bottle before talking "Mmhm. What can I say. I just like my cow juice."

"There they are. Two words more cursed than "meat budget"." said Inigo covering his face with his hands, defeated.

"By the way what are you eating? Looks different from the rest of the food" asked Bobby.

"Long pork and rabbit. I've been hooked on it lately..."

Amidst laughter and friendly banter, the group savored each moment of the barbecue gathering. Nene's tail, swishing playfully, brushed against Yui's leg, sending a shiver up her spine. She fought to keep her cool, concentrating on her food, hoping to divert her attention away from the teasing.

But Nene wasn't easily deterred. With a mischievous glint in her eyes, she poked Yui's side lightly with the tips of her fingers, causing Yui to stifle a surprised gasp.

"The hell are you doing?" whispered Yui. The boys were talking loudly among themselves so they didn't notice.

"Sorry, your smile was too cute and I couldn't resist~" ansered Nene with a sly grin on her face.

Had Yui been smiling without realizing?

"Looks like bringing you along was the right choice." said Nene "Hanging out with these guys is the best way to forget about your highschool worries~"

"You make it sound like we are your personal clown squad" said Bobby. Nene had stopped whispering and the boys had heard her.

"You make it sound like we aren't, man" joked Inigo.

"That's cause you are **my** personal clown squad" said Hifumi chuckling, and causing his mates to laugh as well.

"Talk for yourselves. I'm a freelance bufoon" added Sandatsu.

Yui sat there, hearing their banter. Until now she had thought of them as the rowdy boys of the class. The ones with girlfriends, calling each other "bro" all the time and constantly making jokes. A typical sight in the structure of every class.

It wasn't like she had grown incredibly close with them in such a short time, but more like she found herself enjoying the experience with them as company. Could she call them friends? Maybe? She didn't know.

Nene reached across the table to grab the last of the popular skewers, her fingertips accidentally brushing against Yui's hand in the process. Yui looked at her, expecting this to be more of her teasing. But this time, it was Nene who was blushing!

"Hehe... feels kinda different when it's not planned" said Nene, trying to brush it off with an awkward smile, completely different from her usual flirty expressions. It looked like when Nene wasn't on the offensive, she was super weak to small things like that.

After indulging in the delicious barbecue feast, Sandatsu, with his ever-practical nature, took charge of setting up an extra-large hammock.

"Now bros" said as he finished dealing wiht the hammock "let us go throw large rocks into the stream"

For some reason, that really hyped the boys, leaving the hammock for Nene and Yui to share. The sound of leaves rustling and distant ape-like sounds from the boys at the stream created a surprisingly soothing symphony. Both girls fell into a comfortable silence, relishing the warmth of the sun on their skin and the gentle sway of the hammock.

Yui's gaze wandered. She looked up at the canopy above, where sunlight filtered through the leaves, painting intricate patterns on her face. The scent of earth and foliage filled the air.

A filled stomach and a calm ambience threatened to lull Yui into a peaceful slumber. She fidgeted, attempting to rouse herself from the encroaching drowsiness.

Eventually her eyes landed on Nene. She could hear a faint purring coming from her, and her tail was swaying lazily. Her ears moving slighlty towards the sounds around them. She was like a normal cat taking a nap.

As the sun cast its warm hues across the clearing, Yui's battle against sleep intensified. She tried to distract herself, gently swinging the hammock and tracing patterns in the air with her fingertips.

But the peacefulness of the woods proved too enticing. Yui's eyes fluttered closed for a brief moment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her senses awakened to the subtle shifting of the hammock, a gentle swaying motion that nudged her from her slumber. 

Blinking her eyes open, Yui found herself still cocooned within the oversized hammock, the fabric cradling her body in a serene embrace. The surrounding woods were bathed in a warm, golden glow, as if the world itself was preparing for the imminent arrival of twilight.

She looked to her side. Nene's fidgeting was what woke her up. The catgirl was stretching and finished yawning before looking back at Yui.

"I wish I could wake up next to you like this everyday~" said Nene with a soft smile.

"Come on, don't start with that already." 

Yui stood up. She could see the boys packing everything up.

"So so, did you have fun? Aren't you glad I invited you?" asked Nene, who was enjoying having the hammock for herself for a bit before getting up herself.

Yui took another glance at the guys, and then back at Nene, before answering "Yeah"

And her smile as she said that, with the setting sun in the background, would become a very precious memory for Nene.
