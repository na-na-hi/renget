##Tao
>Unholy Rejection of Fate Tao:
 Through intense suffering, one can eventually grow powerful enough to reject and alter their very fate. His Tao is not one he's chosen, but one which was forced upon him. Heng sees no option now but to follow it, even if it brings him further misery. Getting stronger is his only remaining drive in this world, his only path to freedom from his curse.  
>~~Tao of Love:~~
~~Orphaned by the brutal slaughter of his family and village at the hands of a slighted cultivator, the young man has since nearly forgotten what love feels like. Stripping away such feelings has made him stronger, and not doing so would only curse innocent people to become more unfortunate lessons in misery. Deep inside his soul, however, a repressed part of himself still longs for those connections. Though he's locked it away as an impossibility, his truest desire is to create bonds of friendship, partnership, and family- free from the horrors which follow him now.  Unknown to him, such bonds could provide their own form of strength.~~
##Taoist Philosophy
>Mortal:
Heng's experience with the seemingly divine has given him more than a mere distaste for The Heavens. He holds an intense hatred for Gods, Sovereigns, and all others who wield similar power, viewing them as merely agents of destruction who trample upon those weaker than themselves. Of course he's really no different from them now. He follows the same sort of philosophy for the sake of his own goal: to become strong enough to slay the entity which denies him sovereignty over his own life and death.
##Tao Heart
>Heart Domain:
A natural development of the Unholy Rejection of Fate Tao, Heng's heart domain forms the foundation of his cultivation and martial arts. 
##Generation
>Disciple:
(Not sure who'd actually take him. Maybe Void Nigga?)
##Qi Gathering: Spirit Root [Realm 3]
>Divine Talent, Exotic [Will]:
Heng has no known affinity for natural elements, but through his intense suffering he has developed the ability to shape his qi into a physical manifestation of his will. Said will entirely determines the potency and flexibility of his element, and his enemies' loss of will bolsters his own and can even restore Heng's qi.
##Body Talent: Bloodline [Realm 3]
>Divine Talent, Human Bloodline:
Heng was born to a family of modest laborers. The young man's family was not bred for cultivation, rather it's something which he's developed as a product of circumstance. Still, he is an exceptional physical talent in his own right.
##Soul Refining [Realm 1]
>Basic Spirit Awakening
##Taoist Roots
>Loose Cultivator:
The Golden Man's Sect of Unholy Rejection is one of uncertain existence, and the entity himself rarely offers direct guidance. No, to be chosen by The Golden Man is to be mercilessly tested, to have your fate manipulated so that you will suffer endlessly. And through your suffering your cultivation will naturally emerge as it did for those cultivators many centuries ago. At first you will flail wildly like a prey animal, both physically and spiritually, but your continued hardship will eventually produce a level of instinctual cultivation which is truly unique and terrifying.
##Circumstances
>Mortal Ties:
Despite The Golden Man's attempts to strip him of his attachments to the mortal world, Heng can't help but value the lives of those who are often most abused by cultivators. While he typically has no intention of doing so, Heng often steps in to protect vulnerable mortals and prevent them from suffering as he has.
>Notorious, Ancient Sect: 
The Golden Man's mysterious and sinister reputation leads those in the know to fear anyone who's earned his "blessing." Save for a few rare exceptions, his cultivators eventually go mad or become truly wicked. The Golden Man is an ancient power, and his mark on the world yet remains, even if it's largely unseen. Whether or not his sect still persists, many of its lost secrets may be found in the dark, hidden corners of this world- locked away from those who have yet to earn such forbidden knowledge.
##Life Encounters

>Sudden Betrayal:
It is rare for The Golden Man to meet his chosen cultivator in his true form. In Heng's case, The Golden Man presented himself as a blind beggar and proposed he read the boy's future as repayment for him bringing the man a meal. It was then that the beggar revealed Heng's fated death at the hands of a cultivator and offered him the ability to deny this fate if he were willing to face whatever consequences resulted from the decision. Heng agreed, and just as the beggar had fortold, Heng soon came into contact with a prideful cultivator. Accidently angering the man proved to be inevitable, and Heng was swiftly struck down without a thought, like a mere pest. The man was enraged even further when Heng got up from the seemingly lethal blow, resulting in even more gruesome retaliation. His body persisted no matter the damage caused, until the cultivator's rage reached a boiling point. In his mad frustration, he unleashed his wrath not just on Heng, but on the entire village. He brutally slaughtered every single inhabitant, including Heng's family. It was then that the beggar appeared once again before a battered and broken Heng and revealed himself to be The Golden Man. He healed his injuries and handed him the blades of a fallen soldier, urging him to take his vengeance and complete his first lesson. Heng's anguish unlocked something deep within him, allowing him to eventually slay the cultivator in a grueling battle. Following the duel, The Golden Man revealed that it was he who entwined the cultivator's fate with Hengs, so that the latter could abandon the mortal realm and become something greater than his humble origin. He insisted that Heng would one day understand the incredible value of this gift.
>Nameless Heroics:
 Heng does what he can to keep his identity hidden and stay out of the business of others, especially when it'd draw attention to himself. Sometimes he fails in this, but he makes an effort to not be remembered once he continues on his way.
>Budding Romance:
There was a time when young love was at the forefront of Heng's mind. Alas, the object of his affections was slain with all the rest. He has put such feelings away, and now the experience merely serves as insight for keeping potential victims of The Golden Man's game at arm's length.
##Fated Encounter
>Mysterious Mentor:
The mysterious entity simply referred to as "The Golden Man" grants him little in the way of direct tutelage. Instead, his gift is a form of unholy immortality meant to prolong the suffering caused by Heng's manipulated fate. At the entity's whim, Heng's body will ignore death. He still suffers the pain of every wound and bleeds as he would if he were dying, but death remains rejected. The Golden Man can heal any and all of Heng's injuries when he so desires, but he almost always makes recovery an excruciating slow process. Furthermore, methods of mitigating pain no longer have any effect on Heng.
##Weapons
>Duandao (Barrage, Trump Card)
##Techniques
![Image description](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1698211156199747.jpg)

>Forbidden Pure Will World Denial [Grade 10 Qi Gathering]:
The instinctual qi gathering technique developed by Heng. By tempering his very being through intense emotional and physical trauma, he can manifest a pure rejection of the world itself. He imposes his own will on reality, butchering an undesired destiny by shaping his qi into an unstoppable onslaught of pure resolve. He is only able to gather qi as long as he retains the will to fight.
>Sufferer's Unholy Bloodletting [Grade 10 Attack]:
The only technique directly taken from the Sect of Unholy Rejection- it was detailed in an ancient scroll and buried with a follower of The Golden Man in a long-forgotten crypt. The user of this technique attacks with two massive bisecting arcs which are imbued with a portion of his inner suffering. This strike also rejects the victim's ability to heal, resulting in persistent blood loss. 
>Forbidden Bloodied Step [Grade 10 Footwork + Grade 10 Barrage]:
Perfection in movement and bladework combined with complete clarity of will allow Heng to move and strike instantaneously, at blinding speeds, and with unrelenting volume.  To those who can perceive of these movements, they may appear animalistic or nonsensical, but each step acts as a deliberate killing blow capable of punishing even the most minor mistake.
>Deathless Fate Cleaver [Grade 4 Trump Card]:
A technique devised to take advantage of The Golden Man's curse. Heng readies himself by imbuing his duandao with his will while accepting whatever pain and damage the opponent may inflict upon him. He then abandons all things but his resolve to slay his opponent/s, dashing through them with an unstoppable attack of channeled killing intent. 
##Advantages
>Blessed Relations:
Heng may not be aware of it, but his willpower has developed to the point that he could deny undesirable fates for those he'd allow to get close to him. While this wouldn't be enough to stop any serious meddling from The Golden Man on its own, it is enough to ignore the entity's typically detached manipulation of Heng's fate as it pertains to those around him. 
>Perfect Efficiency:
His fighting style is not one of memorized movements or intensive study, but one of pure adaptation and instinct. His martial arts is an extension of his will to push onward and has the efficiency one would expect of a style that is truly his own.
>Undying Tenacity:
The result of his life lived so far, his resolve has become truly unbreakable.
>Second Style (Dual Duandao):
These lightweight blades allow him to attack swiftly and unpredictably from any angle, and he's developed his techniques entirely around their use.
##Fatal Flaws
>Exposed Encounter:
The lingering presence of The Golden Man is not yet forgotten by those familiar with the stories of the most ancient sects, nor is the significance of his chosen cultivator missed. There are some who seek to snuff out Heng before he has a chance to repeat the many horrors of his predecessors.
>Ruthless Foes:
Those of the lower realms are unlikely to recognize Heng's significance. No, it is those of the higher ranks he has to be most wary of.
>Ruthless Warrior:
Heng does not enjoy bloodshed, but views it as an unfortunate inevitability in a world where cultivators run amuck. What's more, his style loses all potency unless he has full intent to kill. He will avoid conflict when it doesn't benefit him, but "If [he draws his] blade, then it must see blood."
>Abandoned By Fate:
His fate has not been his own since he earned the attention of The Golden Man. His path has been severely twisted so that he will face endless hardship.
##Special Perks
![Image description](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1698211217663289.jpg)

>Hiding in Plain Sight:
Through will alone, Heng has developed the ability to hide his trail from even those of the highest realms. Especially powerful cultivators may sense The Golden Man's presence after enough time spent speaking to Heng directly, but even this has been mitigated. 
>The Way of Killing:
Heng fights with an intense clarity which most traditional cultivators lack. His instincts guide his actions far quicker than his conscious mind ever could and faster than most enemies can keep up with.
>Pillaged Fate:
 In defiance of The Golden Man, Heng rejects his manipulated fate and shatters the advantages of his opponents via sheer strength of will.
