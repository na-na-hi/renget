# Riveting One's Gaze

## Chapter 1

“Sheesh, Russell, don’t be such a prude!” The fuzzy lynx shook her head with such vigor that it was liable to spontaneously detach from her body…or at least give her a serious kink in the neck for the evening. “I *said* that I only liked it during high school, not a decade later when we’ve all long since graduated from college!”

Sitting across the table from her was a lithe gazelle with a contagious smile plastered on his face. Being a few beers into our weekly “group therapy” session, he was hardly subtle about trying to goad me into joining in on the ribbing, giving a few exaggerated tugs at my shirt sleeve. “Emily, you decided to kick things off describing *that* little doozy to us. I don’t think me or Drew can match that threshold of ‘embarrassing’ in our entire lives, huh, buddy?”

Speaking of kinks, we had somehow found ourselves in the midst of revealing, one by one, our personal fetishes to each other. Really, *really* not the kind of conversation I had envisioned in this rinky-dink apartment I shared with Russ. It’s not like we weren’t all thick as thieves after spending our university years training together on the track and field team, but still, I felt horrendously nervous with my turn on deck. 

“H-heh, I, uh, don’t know about that, Russ,” I gulped, steeling myself for the worst. Man, I hated how I already knew what his reaction was going to be. As a hare, I had at least a solid six inches in height on the gazelle, yet I could feel his aura towering over me in terrifying fashion. 

Before I could start my spiel, however, Russ beat me to the punch, volunteering himself as the next tribute. “Crossdressing.”

“Wait…for real?” Emily slid back in her chair a few inches, trying her best to process this apparent revelation. 

Me, on the hand? The guy worked at Abercrombie and Finch as a brand representative. It was literally his job on the daily to flaunt fashionable clothing, and he still had a very respectable build despite no longer participating in the rigors of competitive sport. Decently lean, a tight stomach, and a nice butt, one of which I had become acquainted with years ago and still did on occasion in the present day. 

“Definitely. Like, I don’t totally get why. Maybe like a forbidden fruit type of thing.” He twirled one of his chestnut brown locks of hair, deep in thought. “Huh…I bet I could rock lingerie just as good as the girls.” Okay, maybe not that deep in thought. “Hint, hint, wink, wink.”

“Sounds like Russell’s got his birthday gift picked out already,” Emily mused, gesturing towards me. 

I mouthed, “why me?”, but she merely put her thumb to her ear and stuck out her pinky, signaling to call her later. Resigned to put this topic on hold, I shrugged my shoulders. 

“Well, Drew? Whaddaya got?” He playfully nudged at my side with his elbow. 

“Yeah, Drew, come on, we don’t have all day.” A little short from Emily, but I could imagine that she was still internally fuming at Russ for his ever-consistent shenanigans.

“Okay, okay, jeez.” Deep breath. “So back when I was a sophomore in college, I had a one-night stand—” 

“…that’s it?” the gazelle interjected, stroking his chin. “Shit, I had a half-dozen of those my first year. Perks of being a star sprinter, if you catch my drift.” 

“…with a guy who weighed about two-and-a-half times as much as me, but just as tall.” Dignity, I knew thee well.

It was Emily who now had a malicious grin spreading from ear to fluffy ear. Meanwhile, Russ…well, his eyes were bugging out of his skull.

“*YOU*? Sticking your dick in…” He trailed off, clearly not eloquent or fully sober enough to finish his sentence. 

I nodded, fully aware of the implication. “A guy I met at a frat party, about a year or two older than me from what I could tell. Run-of-the-mill deer, outside of how tremendously tubby he was. Lord only knows how he didn’t trigger a miniature earthquake with each step he took.” A snicker from Russ, settling me down a smidge.

“Anyway, I dunno if someone invited him there on a dare or what, but it was clear he was totally out of his element. Too uncomfortable in his own skin to mingle with any of the partygoers, sadly. The irony is that he stuck out like a sore thumb and managed to get entirely ignored.” I lazily stretched my arms above my head, a feeble attempt to play off the scenario as nothing out of the ordinary.

“Drew, please continue to regale us with this wonderful story!” I swear, there had to have been sparkles in that cat’s eyes. Goddamnit.

“So…I walked over to him, trying to strike up a quick chat. You know, to help him integrate with the ambiance and all that. Unsurprisingly, the poor guy was skittish as hell. Couldn’t get a word out of him at first. When the gears started turning, though, his mouth was moving a mile a minute. He was really big on anime and tabletop games and rambled on about them at length despite me not being able to contribute much in turn.”

“It sounds like he was just really big in general.” Evidently, the lynx had recuperated enough to make a dig of her own, although not entirely unwarranted. Instinctively, I pinched the bridge of my nose in faux frustration.

“Hey, be nice. For what it’s worth, being a good listener seemed to be enough for him to enjoy my company. Given the loud-ass music blaring in my ears, I’m not sure how much I actually heard. Therefore, rather than becoming deaf at the ripe old age of twenty, I asked if he wanted to go to a private room to chat. You should have seen how he bobbed that flabby ol’ face of his up and down.”

“Barf.” Russ flopped back in his chair to let his arms dangle freely. With a spare index finger, I flicked his forehead, eliciting a pitiful whine from the gazelle.

“Rude.” I cleared my throat, hesitant on how to proceed further. “Uh, okay, let’s see…he ended up leading the way, waddling up the stairs in all his 500-something pound glory. It was actually impressive how nimble he was getting up each step. Sneaky quick, too. But the kicker? He had an ass the size of Alaska, and god, the way it shuddered and swayed in his sweats with even a slight amount of movement…I kid you not, getting a front-row view of that gargantuan sight gave me an erection with the strength to tear through fucking sheet metal.”

Upon this admission, my face burned with the intensity of a thousand suns. Somehow, being punted into one of them would be preferrable to this self-induced humiliation. I hardly dared to gauge the reactions of the others at the table, yet I found myself glancing around to survey the wreckage. 

Thankfully, Emily was doing her best to stifle what probably would have been an uproarious fit of laughter. Russ, on the other hand, was hitting the bottle like nobody’s business.

“Drew…Drew…come on…” he muttered, the scent of watered-down liquor on his breath reaching my nose at breakneck speed. “I know you’re…*urp*…not much of a liar, but seriously…”

“I *am* serious,” I insisted, much to my chagrin. “There was scarcely an inch of space between the bannisters before that doofus of a deer would have gotten himself wedged in extra tight.”  

“A sh…a seriously shitty liar.” The gazelle sighed obnoxiously, letting his irritation be unequivocally known to the public at large. 

“Ignore him.” Thank you, Emily, for being the sole voice of reason under this roof. “Go on, Drew.”

 “Yeah.” I couldn’t help but get in a short, yet piercing glare at my roommate before continuing. “Honestly, I’m not sure how he interpreted my request for privacy. Personally, I just wanted a place that was quiet since that figured to be the best environment for the both of us at the time.

“After getting up the stairs, we chose an empty room at random and sat down on the edge of the bed for a little while. He was a lot calmer, steadying his speech and telling me that he really appreciated me reaching out to him. As a sign of solidarity, I put my hand on his shoulder, and…he pulled me in close for a wet, sloppy kiss.”

This got Russ’s attention in a hurry. Bewildered, he rushed to blurt out his next sentence. “On the cheek, or—”

“On the *lips*.” 

“Ooh, now we’re talking!” Emily, reinvigorated by this tidbit, pounded her fists on the table. “More, Drew! I demand more!”

I rolled my eyes. “And…it felt…well, amazing, despite his obvious inexperience. So, fueled by my libido, I reached up under his bed sheet of a shirt and groped him a little, sinking my fingers into his, *ahem*, doughy figure wherever the fates guided my hands. He actually yelped when I tweaked his…moobs, I guess? Shit, I thought I had accidentally hurt him, so I pulled back for a second.”

“Well, did you?” the feline inquired with morbid curiosity.

I shook my head, a grin tugging at the corner of my lips as I could hardly believe how much detail I was divulging. “In reality, it was a shameless moan. Strangely, it’s as if me engaging in foreplay with him made him a lot more willing to take the next step, which I’ll get to in a second.”

“Sure, I mean think about it this way, “ Emily reasoned. “If you had been rejected all your life, and suddenly you end up with a hot dude feeling you up, that’s got to be a massive confidence boost, right?”

“I…yeah, that actually makes sense. I never really thought about it that way.” Checking in on Russ, it was clear *he* was totally checked out, the upper half of his body splayed out over the surface of the table. I delicately slid a couple of empty beer bottles away from him, not being particularly interested in sweeping up broken glass off the tile floor tonight.

“Before I knew it, he was unbuttoning my jeans with lightning speed and yanking down the zipper. I was surprised by his enthusiasm, but…very much into the whole thing. He peeled away the underwear too, and I immediately felt his puffed-up cheeks all mushed up against my nuts.” I shifted uneasily in my chair, trying to adjust for the raging boner building up just talking about this.

“I hear this big whiff, like he was inhaling deeply, then…he was slobbing on my knob like his life fucking depended on it. Loud slurps, airtight suction, tongue action up and down my shaft, you name it. Bless his heart, he was trying his best. And was it *ever* for me. I must have blown the biggest load of my life in his mouth in thirty seconds. I was so overwhelmed by the stimulation that I kinda…forgot to tell him I was that close.”

“No!” Emily grimaced out of sympathy, but was clearly still engaged in the story.

“Mhmm. He tried swallowing, but there was so much volume that most of it dribbled down his chin. He looked so incredibly happy though with that sugary-sweet smile of his, knowing he could make me cum so easily. That was what really emboldened him to go the full distance. With me still being in the afterglow of the orgasm, he was already stripping down to literally buck naked.”

“How’d he look?” The lynx cocked her head in anticipation.

“Well, let’s see. He had an apron belly, pepperoni nips, thunder thighs, these saggy upper arms where the fat was kinda just billowing out and over the elbows like built-in floaties, pretty much what you’d expect. It was difficult to tell whether he had a cock buried in all that blubber down below, given that he had a…uh…what do you call it?” I beckoned towards Emily, hoping she could fill in the blank.

“I think the word you’re looking for is ‘fupa.’”

“What now?” I raised an eyebrow.

“Technically not a word, but an acronym. Fat upper pubic area.” She nodded, affirming her faith in her answer.

I eyed her suspiciously, not quite believing that was a real thing. “Okay, sure, whatever. He had a fupa, so it was hard to see his full length. Whether there was more to it, I couldn’t say for sure. Either way, his weight wasn’t doing him any favors in that department. 

“It didn’t really matter though, since he hoisted himself up on the bed to get on all fours. And did that bed ever creak with all that mass quivering on top of it. He wiggled his tail, all seductive-like, then smacked his ass with a comically pudgy hand. You know how water ripples when you skip a stone across it?”

“Of course.”

“Well, imagine that, but with this guy’s caboose. Literally, just the sheer heft of it wobbling to and fro with no end in sight. If there are seven wonders in the world, this would undoubtedly be the eighth. And…that opened the floodgates for me.

“Fortunately, there was some lube and condoms set aside on the end table, which was probably the only forward thinking done in the history of the frat house. With some effort, I barely managed to part the buck’s chunky cheeks to slick him up. He certainly wasn’t expecting the cold, so he gasped and mumbled something nearly inaudible when he first felt it. Sounded like ‘oh my gosh,’ but he struggled getting past the ‘g’ several times before finally spitting out the rest.”

I ran my fingers through the fur on top of my head, readying myself for the denouement. “Equipping protection to help limit the clean-up, I mounted as deeply as I could muster into that divine behind. *Believe me* when I say I absolutely tried my hardest. However, as desperately as I wanted to reach the objective, I simply did not have enough dick to do the job properly.” 

“So what did you do instead?” Calm down, crazy cat lady, I’m getting there…

“In my lust-addled state, my next best option was, um, smushing the cheeks together against my length and sorta…grinding and humping in between them.”

“Hotdogging.” Emily was absolutely stoic with her delivery this time. 

“Hotdogging? All right, let’s go with that. At any rate, he was still enjoying himself, pushing back against me and jiggling his ass to help get me off. I had to grab hold of some of his fat folds to maintain my position during all the commotion.”

“Love handles. Power bottom.” How did a lynx possess the *power* to be this smug?  

“Now I’m sure you’re just inventing terms on the spot.”

“Am not!” Folding her arms, Emily managed to capture the essence of a disappointed mother and a petulant child all in one expression. Not worth pressing my luck any further!

“Fine. Wrapping up the story, he got me to finish in a few minutes, then I jerked off his teeny little knob to reward him for all his effort. He closed his eyes the entire time but was making these squeaking sounds with each stroke. It was kinda cute, looking back on it. I mean, it was the least I could do, and yet I still felt awful for not doing more for him. The dude was totally winded and drenched in sweat at the end of it all. Fell asleep in the buff shortly after.”

“I’m assuming you stayed with him through the night?”

“Of course. I got to be his little spoon in that bed, which was likely the only time that will ever happen in my life. He was gone before I woke up in the morning. Devil’s magic to be able to accomplish such a feat, I’m certain of it. Shame I didn’t get his number ‘cause I would have liked to have stayed in touch with him, even beyond the romp.”

 “I find it hard to believe you didn’t spot him on campus afterwards. He’d be pretty hard to miss if you were looking for him, right?” The lynx scratched the nape of her neck while pondering the scenario.

In turn, I clasped my hands together out of exasperation. “That’s the thing; I caught neither hair nor hide of him again. This was in the spring term, so maybe he was actually a senior and graduated at that point.”

“Wild.”

“Yeah…wild.” My throat was unbearably parched, likely for a variety of different reasons. Cracking open a lukewarm beer, I took a few healthy swigs. “I know Russ will hate to hear it, but I swear to you that was by far the best sex I’ve had, and it’s not even close.” 

The gazelle stirred, ears perking up at this perceived slight. 

“You’re a chubby chaser then?” Emily beamed.

“I…guess.”

“More like a *whale watcher*, am I right?” Ah, there was the Russell we all knew and “loved.”

Gently, I patted him on the back. “Go back to sleep, Russ.”

“What time is it?” he groggily inquired. “Need…my beauty rest for work tomorrow.”

“Time for *me* to head out,” the lynx quipped, preempting what would been a slightly snarkier response from yours truly. “I’ll catch you two later, all right?”

As she ambled for the entryway, I stood up, intending to accompany her. “You good to walk home by yourself?”

“I’m not inebriated like pretty-boy is over here,” Emily asserted, making an impromptu finger gun to the long-haired ungulate by my side. “Gotta get the blood circulating in my legs again, that’s all.”

“Fair enough.” With a click of the front lock, we were down to only two for the night. Realistically speaking, I was by my lonesome. 

Although I contemplated leaving Russ in the kitchen, my heart hadn’t entirely frozen over quite yet. Draping a limp arm across my shoulders and propping up his back, I hauled the gazelle off to his bed, rolling him onto his side on the mattress. Amusingly, he barely stirred a muscle once I let go. “Sorry, bud, not tucking you in,” I whispered, departing to let him to hang out in dream land for the time being.

Returning to the kitchen, I found myself sitting idly in the same chair that had been so gracious to support me for the past few hours. While I knew I had to get myself to bed soon as well, something simply felt…off. Hard to describe the sensation; it wasn’t exactly a gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach, but more like a sneaking suspicion that I had opened Pandora’s box. 

Was it really that bad to admit to being turned on by fat dudes? I strongly doubted Emily would turn it around against me. On the other hand, Russ was much more a wild card; whenever he latched onto something, it was an unenviable task getting him to let go. That’s part of what made him so devoted to his craft as an athlete, but also what made him a pain in the ass rather frequently. 

Oh well. There were more important things that required my attention this week anyway, like Russ’s birthday. I could only hope that a call with Emily tomorrow would be a good pick-me-up and the panacea for all the wild and increasingly perverted thoughts running through my brain.
