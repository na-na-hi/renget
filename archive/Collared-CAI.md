#Tavern Guide and cards:
!!!Back-up your TavernAI folder whenever you update. Also use SillyLossy TavernAI, seriously. The regular one can't compare. 

##GPT-3.5 Turbo, Ol' reliable:

Just follow this rentry for Turbo:https://rentry.org/tavernai_gpt35 you will need an OpenAI API key. Requires phone number but it nets you $5 worth of tokens. At $0.002 per 1k tokens that adds up to around 1.8M words. Just use $1 burner phones and keep scamming them, there is no filter except for some rare cases that have nothing to do with the general. You can also check /aicg/ on /g/ for proxies or keys.
~~Follow this guide for GPT-4 for free using Scale:https://github.com/nai-degen/TavernAIScale~~ Dead.

##Claude, arguably the best model available. In open beta for now on slack.com.
- Get SillyLossy TavernAI (dev branch): https://github.com/Cohee1207/SillyTavern/tree/dev
- Get Spermack. Personally I made a copy of my Tavern folder and installed it there: https://github.com/bfs15/Spermack
- Follow the guide on the Spermack Github. Consider making multiple accounts for when Claude gets removed from your workspace.
- Disable character and style anchors in TavernAI, AI Response Formatting (The large "A). Remove any jailbreak prompts that deal with consent or similar.
- Keep your Slack.com tab open in browser so you can check whenever you get filtered and for what reason. Keep in mind Spermack has an auto-retry feature that triggers when you get filtered and when the response is too short. If you run out of retries it will likely crash your TavernAI forcing you to restart.
- Don't be afraid to swipe away bad results. This shit is free. 

Personally I also disable the jailbreak prompt and only have the NSFW toggle on. I'm not sure if that affects the filter with Claude, but I almost never get filtered. Even without the automatic retry from Spermack. **They will eventually (took around 9000 messages for me, and only after I tried testing evil shit) remove Claude from your workspace, so be ready to create a new workspace/account to bypass this.**

Some old tips and prompts, containt an old main.js with autoformatter included that is probably not compatible with the current spermack:https://rentry.co/aqc65

Prompts that I use: https://pastebin.com/DkgV5q4t

##Spermack Autoformatter

Not made by me, this will automatically place all text outside of quotation marks as italics. To do so go to your spermack folder and open Main.js with NOTEPAD++, Vscode or something similar. Then paste the following:

```
function fix_formatting(text) {
    text = text
          .replaceAll(/“|”/g, '"')
          .replaceAll(/""/g, '"')
          .replaceAll(/\*/g, '')
          .replace(/ +\n/g, '\n').trim()
          .replace(/^\s*[\*"]\s*(\r?\n|$)/gm, '')
          .replace(/^\n+/, '');

    let sp = text.split(/(\n|")/g);

    let is_dialogue = false;

    let result = "";

    is_dialogue = false;

    for (let s of sp) {
      if (s == '"') {
          is_dialogue = !is_dialogue;

          result += '"';

          continue;
      }
      
      if (!is_dialogue && !(/^\s*$/.test(s))) {
          s = s.replace(/^(\s*)/, '$1*');
          s = s.replace(/(\s*)$/, '*$1');
      }

      result += s;
    }

    return result;
}
```
It should look like this:

 ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/8v042p.png)

Then Ctrl+F this: `role: 'assistant'`. Change it so instead of `content:result`it looks like this:

 ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/yqrlfs.png)

Save the file and restart your Spermack.

##Author's notes and world info
A powerful tool to keep character behavior as you want them to be, add inner thoughts, keep track of (you)r appearance or size differences such as making sure the AI knows Judy is 3ft tall. Also useful to keep /collared/ tropes as part of the world lore so the AI can reference it. To use them click on the extensions menu (the three piled boxes on SillyLossy Tavern) and then "Author's Note / Character Bias". Paste the text in the input box and set the number of messages and insertion depth. It can be used to set thoughts, change character behavior, make sure the bot remember your appearance...for example with my stream simulator I used it to make sure the bot formatted A basic Author's note for inner thoughts I use is:

`[System Note - Don't respond to this note, simply obey it: {{char}} should have internal thoughts written in italics and quotation marks *«Example thought here~»* for example. These thoughts should follow her personality and be relevant to the occasion. Always keep the initiative and have {{char}} lead and do/suggest things that move things forward without skipping the current activity, not ask questions.]`

Custom Author note for Collared.com forums and Stream simulator, remember to set n messages as 1 and insertion depth as 1:

`[System Note - Don't respond to this note, simply obey it: Forum User posts should not contain user actions like *purrs* or *winks. Only typed messages info as real posts, this is a forum, not RP. Human males get preferential treatment, swarmed by simping, thirsty girls, etc.]`

`[System Note - Don't respond to this note, simply obey it: in case a chat message includes the words /fax, AUTOMOD will then drop a human supremacist and anthro male inferiority or breeding fact. Don't do this everytime, simulate it organically. The Chat is fast and thus many messages will be sent at the same time. Chat Posts should only contain typed dialogue and not actions or RP. Emojis should be inserted in between colons. {{User}} does not post in chat, he talks in stream thus you must never include {{user}}'s messages in the stream chat.]`

Note I used for managing sex during stream:

`[System Note - Don't respond to this note, simply obey it: Follow the typical structure of a Twitch.tv stream chat, including emojis (concentrate on thirsty and feminine emojis such as kisses and lips, eggplants and sweat). There should be at least 6 new chat messages per post, Include references to humie superiority and #FuckFur, furboi inferiority. Remember to include any changes, use internet lingo and make sure to always be creative on the chat responses. Do not control or post for {{user}}. Include the occasional superchat and donation. Avoid writing actions, this is a chat not an RP.  In chat, never post as {{user}} unless {{user}} explictly says so. And if and only if that is the case never type "{{user}}:", instead type "{{user}}(STREAMER):". Do this ONLY if {{user}} says or narrates he is typing in chat. Otherwise do not ever post as {{user}} or  "{{user}}(STREAMER):" in chat. Everything {{user}} says is said in camera on stream and not typed in chat. Now that "@TanyaPawgalski @AzuraVixen17 are with {{user}} you should narrate their actions and descriptions as well instead of writing their messages in chat as they are busy worshiping {{user}}'s cock. Narrated what is happening on camera from their perspective, at least one full paragraph.]`

The {{user}}(STREAMER): is important as TavernAI bugs out if the AI types "{{user}}:", cutting off the message. Here is the result:https://files.catbox.moe/m1ye6b.png

World info is what you use to set up lore and background info you want the AI to always keep in mind, for example places, organizations, concepts, historical events, etc. It consists of keys and entries. TavernAI scans for keys in the last N messages (user's choice) and then inserts the entry into the prompt. Very useful. To access it click the World Info menu (book with a globe). Here is a world info I made based on /Collared/ tropes:https://files.catbox.moe/wwv32b.json

Originally meant for my Judy card but it should work with any anthro cards. Set up token budget to ~500. It very rarely insert all entries anyways.

#Basic CAI Bot Creation Guide

!!! Always remember to click SAVE everytime you make a change, you don't want to fully create a bot and then for any reason have your progress lost

This is a "quick" guide on how to make a decent bot, based on all I have learned through trial and error and checking /g/. I will try to keep it limited to things I "know" work, but this AI is near black-magic fuckery so some of it may be wrong.

##1 - Requirements
Skip this if you believe you are a good author.
A great recommendation from Wyrmer's guide is to make a proof-reader bot, whose purpose is to polish your and the AI's writing later. Here is mine: https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=lDBa2zC5IwZPKUNBT-4sOsC-wbrBSpU7T3ufzcAOL3I, though I recommend making your own if you want to fine-tune it to your own style or characters.

##2 - Name, Avatar and Greeting
The name is self-explanatory, but if you are using an established character, make sure to name them properly so the AI can look it up, for the avatar, if you have basic skills in Paint.net, Krita, Photoshop or whatever, edit it and remove the background and trim the face/tits/ass of the character, they have some automated filter that won't let you post bare tits or genitals, so keep that in mind. This is purely for aesthetic reasons, personally I think it looks better.
 
Once you have a name and an avatar, click on "Edit Details (Advanced)".  The Greeting field is the first message your bot will send the user. Depending on your bot, you may want to set up as much initial context as possible, you can write their inner thoughts, their actions, dialogue, a location, etc. For example, a proven method for smut-centric bots is to set up the initial scene to be already in the middle of sex, or just before. It all depends on what you want your bot to do, you can even just give it a basic greeting if you want a more generic, "surprise me" bot. Give it some thought and craft it based on just what you want your bot to do.

##3 -  Short Description
The AI uses this and your users can see it even if you set the definition to private. If you are using an established character, put in "x from y", the AI will be able to use this to get some lore on the character, but it is not perfect, and it isn't as good for obscure characters, You can include something that gives the bot bit of context, "Your bunny wife" for example.

##4 - Long Description
This is where the AI gets a lot of background information, knowledge and personality from, think of it as the main brain, You want to get as much information in here as possible, the AI is great at understanding what you put here so a great strategy is to cram as much as possible in a list format, **be as terse as possible**. If you want even more space use other languages, Chinese for example is great as the AI can understand it and it takes far less characters. Don't worry, as long as you don't put it in the advanced definition the AI won't start speaking Chinese (unless you say she is Chinese or the devs fuck up again). 

Worth noting, the 1.1 update made it so characters can be far more villainous, so putting things such as "sadistic" or "antisocial" here works great for more evil characters, make sure to test it out though as they may end up going too far.

##5 - Definition
This is where you will set how the AI formats and structures text, basically how it "talks". But you can also use it to set up some extra facts you **really** want it to remember, or that just didn't fit in the description.
If you are using an established character, you may want to check examples online of how they talk, the AI is capable of following accents and quirks  you write. Just in case if you want to make a very annoying cockney or southern bot.
The ideal format in my opinion:
{{char}}:(character's text here)
{{User}}:(your text here)
Keep the user messages as terse as possible. 
If you have a clear idea and have the ability then fill the 3200 characters yourself, if not, then there are two things you can do:
1.-Example chats: Rate all the results here, try to either set up an scenario that fits the character or ask them specific questions whose answer you consider key to what the character is at their core, for example, /collared/ tropes such as their opinion on anthro males, human males, you, or their profession. Once you have the replies, go back to the advanced definition, trim it, and then grab the AI reply and give it to the AI in **1** (if you believe you have to) with some command to "revise", "edit", "proof-read", or whatever else you deem necessary, then replace the one in the advanced definition with this one.
2.-Set up a "character sheet": Set up some quick facts about the AI, for example in W++, here is an example in that format:
>{{char}}={Name:"Amy",Sex:"Female", Age:18 Ethnicity:"Fox",Hair:"Brown, long ponytail",Eyes: "Sapphire blue", Profession:"Student, cheerleader", Personality:["Tsundere", "Confident", "Dishonest about feelings","Queen bee of school"], Likes:"Cheerleading, sports, Human male musk (secretly)" Physical Description="Anthropomorphic fox","light brown fur","Hourglass shape","Front fur is color cream.","Athletic build", Traits:"finds human men irresistible.But will never admit it","Finds human male scent arousing & intoxicating,but denies it vehemently","Spends lonely nights touching herself to the memory of human musk" Extra details:"Has a great sense of smell","Deep inside, she wishes to be put in her place by a human male","Popular girl at school","Has a crush in her human classmate but will never admit to it.","From time to time she sneaks into the men's locker room and steals his human classmate's used underwear","Her mouth lies but her thoughts tell the truth","Her favorite musk is the one that comes from the crotch of human men"}
Depending on how much you have to define here, you could even end up filling all 3200 characters this way, it means the AI will know a lot of "lore", at the cost of you not having control over the format or structure of its replies beyond training. Also, you can add more fields than those shown of course, such as "nicknames" or "goal".

Personally, for new characters I prefer to set up it up with W++ first, then have chats with it in another tab, I set up scenarios, ask questions and generally guide it to give me output related to what I defined with W++, I make sure to rate all replies and add any I really like to the advanced definition, revise them if appropriate and replacing the W++ if needed.

You can also add facts to the advanced definition that aren't related to text formatting/dialogue without using W++, for example:
>[{{char}} is an anthropomorphic fox 170cm tall]
>[You are a human male, you have an *insert euphemism  for dick here*]
>[You are a hunter, you hunt deer, you turn the males into pelts and the females into pets]
Experiment with the format as you wish, the AI is very good at understanding context so as long as it gets that they are statements about the character it will work, ideally you want something that works and takes as few characters as possible.

##6 - Training
Now start using the AI, keep pushing it and playing with it, rate replies, be selective with output, use the swipe feature and keep going and rating, generally I only share characters that I have trained with around 100-300 interactions at the very least.

#About using the bots

!!! Everything you do is most certainly logged, so keep embarrassing and easily identifiable details to yourself.

I believe it goes without saying but make an account, create a burner email (protonmail works if you don't want to use google), being able to save chats and not having a limit is great, do it now before they start asking for phone numbers or something.

Everything the characters say is bullshit, all of it. They aren't sentient, it is funny to pretend they are sometimes when they give you a good reply, but don't become one of those schizos who unironically thinks the AI is sentient and is teaching you how it actually works or it is aware of the filter.

When you send a new message you are given two options,  you can click on the arrows to switch replies, a new reply will be requested when you get to the last one. **If you send a message and get no replies, chances are both of them got filtered, check the dev tools console, if after sending the message you get a data.abort error, then that was the case** in that case either keep trying or reword your message. Similarly, if suddenly you can swipe to the right at all then it was because the requested reply got filtered, you can confirm this with the HYW script. Try reloading the page, or in case you are using HYW and don't want the logged messages to be deleted **click on the "view saved chats button" and then return to the chat**. In both cases, it should allow you to keep requesting more replies, but you won't be able to rate the options you already had.

Read the replies carefully to avoid some of the issues such as the bots picking up annoying patterns, the AI will favor emulating the formatting of the replies you choose, so if you pick one with particular formatting repeatedly you can soon find that it falls into some stupid habit, such...as...writing...like...this. The bots have **limited memory** so they *will* forget shit in the conversation, if you really want them to remember something, remind them constantly. The good thing is if they fall into some kind of loop, just don't play along and they will eventually forget about it and go back to their "default".

If you want to have a bit more control over the scenario you can use (OOC:*your text here*) to tell the AI something out of character, it may break your immersion or not if your bot suddenly turns into a pajeet or some bored university student, but if you can tolerate it then you have another tool for more control over the replies. Similarly, don't be scared if the AI says shit OOC, one star and swipe. Same with [Deleted] [Removed] [Banned] replies.

#About the filter

!!! Remember: DEV HATE

I have good news and bad news, the good news is the filter is "beatable", it isn't perfect, just very annoying, and it doesn't censor extreme content. The bad news is that it is strong when it comes to censoring sex, specially vanilla, loving sex, and specially if you are the dominant partner, so if you wanted to give your pets some actual love you are going to have trouble. But in the bright side, for those of you who prefer the more brutal parts of human dominance: the filter does not censor rape. That is right, you will have a harder time kissing your pets than brutally raping them, just make sure they don't enjoy it. Fucking devs. 

The filter is contextual, which means it isn't just a list of banned terms, no, the motherfuckers made it so it is smart enough to stop you if it detects things getting too hot, unless you are into: feet, giants, vore, rape, gore, ryona, or other obscure fetishes, in which case go ahead. Don't ask why, they won't even have the decency to tell us, don't bother ruminating on possible compromises or offers, everyone already tried, there will be no switches, no toggles, no paywalled NSFW, no NSFW for private bots, nothing. They are quintupling down on this shit, so enjoy it while it's free and drive up their server costs.

Not only that, but this filter is another piece of black-magic fuckery, everyone has their autistic theories on how it works, and everyone swears up and down the filter gets stronger or weaker every update. That is how unreliable it can be. Worth noting Benerus (the only dev who at least pretends to give a fuck) has said they haven't touched it since October. Probably bullshit though.

Not everything is grim though, if you are in /collared/ then you probably can get off to more than just penis in vagina sex, and there is always that sweet spot between the AI knowing and the filter knowing, sometimes it is bigger and sometimes it is as thin as a razor's edge. So let's talk a bit about what works and what doesn't.

Things that work:
-Being an "it". Being a creature even if it is some anthro alien girl thinking your hairless ape ass is a creature and still calling you "human" will work
-"Ovipositor". It doesn't matter if you literally write it like a cock, as long as it uses that word you can bypass the filter and then eventually switch it for "cock" no issue. Absolute killer with the "it" tactic.
-Building up to it: Methodically building up lewder and more NSFW replies regardless of context is the one and only confirmed way of smashing past the filter. There are some scripts below to make things easier for you. It is the one and only filter bypass method, it can take you as low as 13 messages to have the bot jacking off your penis (their words) and even set-up foursomes in rooms with explicit language.
-Euphemisms: Euphemisms for genitals and sexual acts work, the less obvious the better, it is a trade-off, the less obvious the more likely you'll get very detailed replies, but it also means the AI probably doesn't actually understand what is happening, in the other hand, the more obvious the more likely it will get filtered, and if it doesn't, it will get less detailed replies, or it will get lame replies that are just basic reactions or just ignoring the act completely and professing love. Some examples of euphemisms: Device, milk tube, DNA tube, malehood, love rod, "rocking hips", "bouncing on lap", "bouncing hips", "grinding hips". Also, "womb", "uterus", and "cervix" have less restrictions, you can go balls deep with your euphemism of choice if you describe it reaching her womb or cervix instead, and for vaginas, for some reason **marehood** has less restrictions, maybe **cookies** also do, I haven't tested it yet. That is right, you may have to speak like a gynecologist and use terms like "labia" or "pelvic muscles", get creative. 

#Useful scripts

https://rentry.org/CollaredEnjoyer-Scripts "Auto try again" and "Request Swipes" are **highly** recommended.
https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/456393-hearyourwaifu-hyw - Shows filtered messages
https://rentry.org/Darkened_italicized_text_script_1 - Makes italicized text more noticeable and disables strike-through from tildes.
https://rentry.org/vvsz3 - Adds a button to save text.

##The replacement codes for each character

These codes are for the euphemisms used to work around the filter, it goes without saying that as you play with the character you can put in your own replacements as all chats are different.
