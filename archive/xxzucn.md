Auntie's little secret.

Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?

~*~

Most of the memories you still have from those days are foggy, as if doused in a thin, yet impenetrable mist. You see clear shapes that you don’t want to name. You can remember almost every detail before it covers itself in mist once more.

Perhaps it’s a coping mechanism. You've grown to believe your own brain is trying to protect you by making you feel the way you do. One time you heard that the brain tends to forget about insignificant memories, which made you realize it was indeed, a coping mechanism. There wasn’t anything “insignificant” about those days.

He scribbled something on a piece of paper. You looked at him for a second. The sound of graphite had snapped you out of your monologue and turned your attention to the man in the desk. He noticed you had broken out of my trance, and promptly apologized.

“Excuse me, keep going.” He said.

You took a deep breath, and resumed your narration.

~*~

At first you could only hear a clock.

Tic. Toc.

Tic.

Toc.

Someone’s at the entrance. Your Lego Spaceship had just taken fly after a valiant speech to your other toys.

The door unlocks. You can hear distant static coming from the kitchen, it resembles the voices of some cartoon no one can recall by this point.

Mommy addresses you. She greets you as she enters and heads straight for the kitchen. You hear the running sink.

Mommy says nothing.

Soon enough, an engine. A car is in the driveway.

That’s dad.

This entire moment feels wrong. Something’s off.

Perhaps the sun shone in a different way today. But you could tell something was missing.

Suddenly, you hear her voice.

The world regains colour once more.

Your dad unlocks the door, and she beams as she sees you.

There she is. The first time you saw her.

The beginning of it all.

~*~

“Happy birthday auntie! I don’t have money to give you a gift but I will study hard and get the first place in my class for you. You’re the prettiest woman and also the goodest.” -Anon

Her heartbeat became erratic as she read and reread the little letter given to her by her nephew, an endearing sense of love washed over her gently, like a slow, calming tide. In her evening clothes, Fubuki searched for Anon amongst the children in the backyard. She found him playing cops n’ crooks with the other kids and gently beckoned him to come closer. Whatever policeman Anon was going to do to stop one of the fiends was put on hold. The voice of his auntie always had that effect on him.

Fubuki gave Anon a deep hug in full view of everyone, squeezing his face onto her chest unconsciously as little Anon tried to hug his aunt back. While his face was pressed with increasing force into his aunt’s chest, Anon sneaked a glance inside her shirt, watching and memorizing every detail of his aunt’s cleavage. Fubuki’s gesture caught the attention of Anon’s parents, his mother looking at the scene with a certain feeling of unease.

“Have you noticed how Anon behaves around Fubuki?” Commented Anon’s mother.

“Yeah.” Replied Anon’s dad.

“I guess he has a crush on his aunt.” She added, trying to catch her husband’s attention.

“Yup” Said Anon’s dad, absent mindedly as he watched TV.

“Well, better that it’s now rather than when he grows up.” She said, mad at her husband’s indifference.

“I guess.”

Fubuki came back inside hiding the letter from view and sat in the living room with the others, sneaking little glances at Anon.

~*~

That night as Fubuki was getting ready to get into bed, her husband saw the letter Anon wrote for her.

“I don’t have money, but I will study hard.” He read it aloud as he giggled. “That little rascal…”

“Heeey, that’s my gift, thank you.” Said Fubuki smugly as she took the note off his hand trying to not tear the paper apart and put it on her nightstand’s drawer.

Her husband looked at his wife endearingly, before turning to a serious face.

“I know that boy’s special to you, Fubuki.” He said as he took off his shirt. “But your deal isn’t healthy.”

“Oh god, are we gonna have this conversation again?”

“Shirakami.” He continued. “Anon’s mom feels like you’re stealing the boy away from her”

“Oh, right, stealing the boy away! From whom?” Fubuki said almost as a reflex. “I taught him how to walk, how to read, how to write, all because your sister thinks her job is more important than her son!”

“Fubu-chan, lower your tone. That’s not the deal with Hana, and you know it. She’s a busy woman, she finally landed the job she wanted and…” He replied, managing his tone as best he could. He traced his steps back to get back at the topic at hand. “Please, this can’t go on, you know Anon could-“

“Could what?” Replied Fubuki.

“You know what I mean. Anon will get too attached to you.”

“Well, that isn’t precisely my fault.”

“Fubuki, please. I know you’ve always wanted to be-“

“Stop.” Fubuki cut him off as she felt sick, as if her stomach was about to bring out everything that came in during the party. “Don’t go there, please.”

“I’m sorry.” Replied her husband, guilty knowing he was about to go too far.

“He’ll grow out of it. I know.” Fubuki said, with a shriveling voice of defeat. “It’s just that, he needs it… I don’t want him to feel alone either…”

“Shirakami…” Her husband came from behind and hugged her, his wife began sobbing in his arms as she turned around and dug herself into his shoulders. There she stood. Half-truth, half-lie. She really couldn’t have cared less about Anon’s mother, but she knew she’d bring trouble.

“Come to bed, honey.”

“Okay.”

~*~

The moonlight slightly illuminated her husband’s figure. Blue shapes in the dark. Once she felt his weight on the bed, she approached him and exchanged a few kisses.

Perhaps it was the honeymoon effect, but she felt him being a bit… different. More intense, to be precise.

“So feisty!” She said as he bit her shoulder.

“Always.”

“Why?”

“Do I need a reason to love my wife?” He emphasized the word “Wife.” Fubuki blushed as a result.

“Y-You know what I mean, honey.”

“Do you want to have a baby, Fubu-chan?” He replied without missing a single beat.

Fubuki felt her body slowly go numb. She little shine in her eyes disappeared with the darkness of the room.

“Babe, don’t…”

“Let’s have one.”

“We’ve been doing it for years like this, honey.”

“I’ve got a feeling, you just wait.”

“A feeling? Why?”

“Because…”

“Because we’re married now?”

“Just… trust me on this one, alright?”

She giggled.

“You’ve always been so stubborn.”

And so he embraced his wife for the night, and the next one, and the next one.

Tirelessly he struggled, until he finally gave up.

~*~

His instincts didn’t spare him either. He wished to raise a little boy himself. He wanted to raise him along Fubuki. In the mid of his sorrow, he reached a compromise.

“Adoption is an option.” He told Fubuki.

“Kenji, not now.”

Her husband was conflicted about her behavior, he knew she wanted to be a mother, but refused her chance to. Perhaps she’s insecure? Maybe she’s scared of doing everything wrong.

And it was true for Fubuki, she was terrified. Not of being a bad mother, but to hurt the poor little thing.

This was because of a secret. A secret she promised to take to her grave.

~*~

“Ahh, ahhh~!” Said Fubuki as she rubbed her pink pearl reading Anon’s letter. Her eyes lingered in the words “The prettiest” and “the goodest”. She resisted her temptations for long, but that only caused them to burst in moments like these, her taste for forbidden fruit kept pestering her.

The memories of giving you a bath or helping you change to enter a pool, running her hands over your tiny body as an excuse to touch you in your “funny zone” gave her all the necessary fuel for her to get lost in her fantasies, now using your letter as an aphrodisiac.

Her legs shook and vibrated as she squirmed in bed. Falling back, she looked to the side and was greeted by her reflection. The very same woman as always, but this time she was smiling, and Fubuki smiled back.

“I guess it can’t be helped, right?”

~*~

You walked over to the table with your chocolate milkshake. Your auntie had taken the food trays. She insisted on doing it herself, since it was your special day. You followed her fluffy tail towards your table, and before you could notice, you milkshake exploded in your hands.

The loud thump of a ball hitting the wet floor made you realize what happened. A woman hurried over and saw you. She apologized deeply before taking the ball in her hands and going over to a kid who was with her.

The woman’s voice sounded angry, but you didn’t pay much attention to it.

Fubuki had left the trays in the table by then and she knelt in front of you.

“Anon! Are you okay?”

You couldn’t let your auntie see you cry. Not her. You held your tears like you though a man should.

Fubuki repeated her question. Still no answer. Before you knew it, she asked the cashier for a paper bag and put everything inside after ordering a second milkshake.

Now you were clutching in your hand the brown bag. Your shirt and pants felt all sticky.

Fubuki was driving back to her house. Your silence was concerning her. Not a droplet of emotion could be seen from your face. She took a turn in an empty street and turned over to you.

“Anon.”

You said nothing.

“Anon.”

“Yes auntie?”

“Are you okay? You’ve been silent since we left the restaurant.”

“I’m okay.” You said in a shaky voice, gathering all the courage you could.

“He’s scared.” Fubuki figured. “He must have a reason to…”

These kinds of moments broke her. Anon seemed to be so emotionally flat it genuinely punctured her guts. Kids are supposed to be lively and happy. Their only responsibilities in life are to play and attend their needs. So why is Anon so scared of crying like a normal kid?

“Anon, are you really okay?”

“Yes.”

“No, Anon, I mean if you are really, really okay.”

Why did she repeat her question? You’re feeling heavy in your chest.

“I-I…”

Fubuki looked at you endearingly. She beamed with worry which only made you feel worse. You felt it rising, you couldn’t keep it in anymore.

First you sniffled wetly. Then a tear peeked out from your eye. Another sniffle. Another tear. Soon enough, you felt Fubuki’s soft hand caressing your cheek, wiping your tears away with her fingers.

Your first whine came out. Fubuki smiled.

“There, just let it out.”

Fubuki undid her seatbelt and yours too, her arms came around your head and gently pushed you towards her.

“Auntie, I’m all sitcky!”

“It doesn’t matter, clothes can be washed.”

And just like that, she rested your head in her soft chest.

And you cried.

You cried like never before.

It wasn’t just about the milkshake, it was about everything you couldn’t cry about before.

Fubuki kissed your head as her hands caressed your hair, and you wet her breasts with your tears.

You stayed like that until you calmed down. A wet stain was left on Fubuki’s shirt. She cleaned your face once more and gave you a kiss on the cheek.

“Better?”

“Yesh…”

“Let’s go home and eat our burgers, okay? I’ll give you a bath as well.”

“Yes!”

~*~

You insisted in cleaning yourself. Fubuki agreed reluctantly.

“9 years old. He’s growing up so fast” She told herself as she heated the food slightly on the microwave. “Feels like just yesterday I was sitting down with him to learn the alphabet…”

Fubuki took the food out and set it on the table as she heard faint calls for help coming from the bathroom.

“Anon?” She asked.

“A-Auntie, could you comereforasecond.”

“Eh?”

“P-Please come!”

Fubuki went to the bathroom and knocked before opening the door, as you told her to come in, she saw you covering your lower half with a towel.

“H-How do you turn the hot water on?” You asked her.

Fubuki giggled and bent over to show you. First she turned the knob to it's sweet spot and then turned it off and told you to try it yourself. You let go of your towel to try and twist the knobs to their sweet spot, and accidentally, your towel fell to the ground, exposing you to your auntie.

You became red with embarrassment. It was bad enough that she had to help you and worse that you were naked, but the worst part about it was that…

…you were hard.

You covered your private parts with your hands without looking at Fubuki, who was making little “o”’s in her mouth involuntarily.

Fubuki’s hand fell over your shoulder, she had a strange look you’ve never seen on her face before.

“Hey, s-since you don’t know how to use the shower, why don’t I show you?”

“W-What? You already did…”

“I-I mean, why don’t we, I, uh…” She muttered.

The look of your prepubescent body was bringing her out her senses. For all she cared, she could assault you right now and you wouldn’t have the strength to stop her, but no, not you, not her little Anon. Instead, she'd see how you would react.

Your aunt began taking her clothes before your very eyes.

“A-Auntie?”

"Well, I saw you, it's only fair if you see me too, right?"

"Um-"

"It's okay, I'm just gonna take a shower with you, to save water, I mean."

You remained silent.

“It’s alright, I’ll keep my bra on to join you.”

You looked flustered.

“Or would you prefer if I didn’t wear it?”

Your silence told on you.

Fubuki’s hands went behind her back almost in slow motion. The bra hung from her shoulders. Fubuki looked at your expression, beaming expectation. She giggled to herself before she took off her garment and revealed her bare chest to you. Before, you used to look at her in secret, and now she was revealing herself to you.

She moved from side to side, letting her chest hypnotize you with their movements, the idea of being the first woman you've seen topless made her feel like she had won the lottery.

“Would you like to touch them, Anon?”

You swallowed. Your hand slowly stretched itself towards Fubuki’s chest. Impatient, she grabbed your wrist which caused you to squeal.

“It’s okay…” She whispered as she felt her sins crawling under her skin.

Once your hand was on her nipple, Fubuki lost it.

“Oh my goodness, my tit is burning, oh shit, oh shit…” Her legs rubbed together involuntarily. She bit her lower lip as you squeezed her boob slightly, causing her to moan and bite her finger.

“A-Auntie, are you okay?”

“Oh yes, don’t worry, Anon…”

Fubuki was breathing heavily. The fire she felt inside was taking over.

“Want to try sucking them, Anon?”

“S-Sucking them?”

“Yes!”

“But I’m not a baby…”

“Grown ups do it too, all the time.”

“Really?”

“Yes!”

Her enthusiasm was throwing you off, but how could you deny your auntie, looking at her so excited to do this with you?

Fubuki pressed your face in her chest, and after finding her nipple with your face, you licked and sucked it.

“Ohoho~!” Fubuki yelled. Her fingers behind your back were fighting between caressing you and pushing you harder in.

Something clicked for you. Like that weird magazine your dad has and beat you for looking at, the one where the lady “wrestled” a man on top on her.

Your hips began thrusting towards Fubuki, and she felt it.

“Oh god…” She thought. “He’s… he’s trying to…”

Her reasoning shut off, Fubuki hurriedly took her pants off and sat on the floor. She signaled you to come closer. You walked over to your aunts lecherous pose, and as her arms wrapped around you, she threw herself back.

“Oh yes, Anon~!”

Confused, you kept humping her between her legs.

Fubuki was completely out of it. She could barely look at you as she felt your hips hitting her lower half.

This went of for a while, after which, the sound of the front foor being opened caused a panic and horror to run through Fubuki’s veins.

In a hurry she turned on the shower and told you to get in. You knew you were both in trouble.

Fubuki put her pants back on and left her bra on the floor. As she left for the kitchen.

Her husband was home.

“Hey honey.”

“Hey!”

He heard the shower in the distance.

“What’s…”

“It’s Anon.”

“Oh? I thought you guys would be out today.”

“Yeah, we were, but, something happened and Anon was left all dirty.”

“I see… we’re having McDonalds?”

“Yeah.”

Fubuki’s heart was about to explode. He was supposed to come home later.
