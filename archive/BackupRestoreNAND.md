###How to create/restore a NAND backup
***
It is highly recommended to create a NAND backup before you start using your CFW setup. 
You can make a NAND backup through two methods:
* [**Switch Method**]()
	* This is the recommended method.
* [**PC Method**]()
	* This method is recommended for those who have a small SD card and are unable to create a NAND backup due to their SD card storage size.
