Tickle Fun Time with Omori

> You find yourself in a featureless, white room, with no recollection of how you got there
> You see a white door right before you but just as you were about to approach it, a voice from behind calls out to you
> It's a young boy no older than 12, the sole inhabitant of this white space. Without showing a  hint of emotion, the plain looking boy gestures for you to sit next to him
> "How did you get in here?" he asks brusquely
>You right hand reaches for the top of your head, pondering the question. "I have no idea," you say, telling the truth
> The boy stands up. "I see," he says. Something about his demeanor has just changed but you can't tell what and it's making you uncomfortable
>"Um, I really don't want to take up any more of your time. Can I go now?"
>"You may go," he says in his monotone voice. "But I'll need you to pass a test first. Only then will I allow you to leave."
> Allow? Just who is this weirdo kid anyway? "Look kid, why not just let me out? It'll save us both of our time"
> The boy seems unaffected. "I'm afraid that's not possible."
>"Okay, so tell me about this test of yours," you say. Might as well humor the kid, you think. He doesn't seem like someone who'd try to pull anything funny
>"It's a test of physical endurance," he says, his huge black eyes staring straight into yours. Suddenly, four red hands materialize out of nowhere, restraining both of your arms and legs. They feel grossly sticky and you could feel your strength being squeezed out
>"What the fuck? What's going on?"
> "Simply put," he whispers, smiling for the first time. You felt a chill run down your spine at the sight. "You're going to have to survive an hour of being tickled,"
> "Let go of me, you fucking brat!" you scream
>Struggling will only weaken you," he says, seemingly relishing your pathetic sight with his impassive eyes
>"So what happens if I fail then?!"
>"You're going to be my slave for the rest of your life"
>You gulped
"Now then, shall we begin?"

>At his signal, another red hand appeared out of thin air
> "Let's start off with something easy," he says, moving closer from his position
> You try not to let the boy intimidate you, staring him down without any hint of fear
> The hand touches the back of your neck, its slimy fingers caressing the skin. This goes on for two more minutes and it feels oddly pleasant
>"Is that your idea of a tickle torture?" you growl
>"I just told you we're starting off with something easy but we can move on if it's not to your satisfaction," he says, his voice taking on a smug tone
>At this point, three more hands appear. The boy smiles again, this time baring his teeth like a predator who just cornered his prey. "This is where the real fun begins"
> Your mind hasn't even processed what's about to happen when two of the hands enter your pants, assaulting your crotch from both sides. You let out a scream as the boy inches closer to you, his face almost touching yours
>The remaining free hand holds your mouth shut
>"I believe I haven't introduced myself yet," he says, licking your cheek. "I'm Omori, the ruler of this place,"
>You can't believe what you're seeing right now. This fucking nightmare has to end
>With the ferociousness of a wild bear, he rips off your shirt with his bare hands, exposing your abdomen
>He puts his pale hands all over it, pinching as if to test what kind of material it's made out of, then moves both hands in a clockwise motion, his fingers grazing the surface
>"You only have to tell me to stop," he says. "But then you'll fail and you'll be mine to keep forever,"

>The hand on your mouth disappears but Omori keeps both of his hands on you
>Unable to resist any longer, you laugh as tears come streaming down your face, the sensation overwhelming you
>”That’s it, don’t hold back,” he says. Omori crouches and his tongue enters your bellybutton, swirling it around like a kitten would to a bowl of milk, flicking it inside with deadly precision
>The wetness of his tongue coupled with how he’s moving it inside you is starting to make you nauseous
>You see his dead eyes fixed upon yours while licking, waiting for you to succumb
>But you don’t. Not yet at least
>You want to strangle the life out of this brat but you’re in no position to do so, helpless as he continues to violate your body
>More than half an hour passes and your body feels sore and numb
>”Congratulations for holding out this long,” he says. Omori crosses his arms, his eyes downcast
>”But I’m afraid this is the end for you,” he declares, sporting his most sadistic smile yet
>You feel like you’re about to have a really bad time
>Suddenly, you find the red hands attached to your limbs tighten their hold, lifting you up in the air
>”What the fuck’s going on!” you scream
>Omori positions himself right beneath your feet and does the same thing he did with your tummy before, running his fingers all over the surface
> Being the most sensitive part of your body, you’ve been dreading this moment would come and the little fucker knew it all along
>”Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I’m going to fucking kill you when I get out of here!”
> This only makes Omori’s fingers move even faster, like a pianist performing at a recital
>This goes on continuously for another five minutes
>”STOP! Please, stop this!” 
>You give up
>You’re done
>You fail
>Omori stops at once and the red hands disappear, dropping you on your back
>You find yourself laughing and sobbing like crazy at the same time, a huge boulder just having been lifted from your shoulders
>If you could hear yourself right now you wouldn’t hesitate to just end your life this instant

>Omori gives you time to recover as you lie down the floor a broken mess
>”Well then, looks like you failed,” he says in his usual monotone voice
>”Fuck you, I’m not going to be your slave,” you weakly declare as you make an attempt to reach for the door
>The door disappears as the place changes from white to red
>”There is no escape”
>The boy draws out a dull knife from his pocket, approaching you
>”Just kill me,” you say
> “But a promise is a promise,” he says, sporting the same sadistic smile from before
>In one swift motion, he stabs your heart with the knife
>There is no blood and you’re still alive, but the pain from the stab is the most painful thing you’re ever felt; no words could adequately describe how excruciating it is
>You lie your head down in defeat. You’ll do anything to not experience that pain again
>”From now on, you will address me as Master, is that clear?”
>”Yes, Master,”
>Now then, for your first task,” he says. You see the boy drop his shorts
>”I want you to make me feel good. Grab some tissues from the box and get to work”
>You do as he says, preparing your mouth for the worst
