Some etf story related idk if can finish on time or just scrap entirely

There's many things I dunno bout so I'm not that confident lol anyways, anyone may take this and refine it, I guess. 

* Takes place right after the teams are assembled and they head off to their respective dungeons
* Alakazam and Chatot either decides to walk around capim town with Lliam accompanying them ('cuz got nothing better to do) or Alakazam decides to stay at the guide to do some further inspections with Lliam accompanying them (make sure they didn't wreck shit or steal anything)
* While walking, they did some overview why Lliam selected the teams on those dungeons (This part idk if he gets to choose, Alakazam to choose or the team themselves choose. This part mainly focuses if Lliam is the one that chooses the teams). 
* Overview like who each of the characters are, their abilities, like their strategy, synergy with other team members, hypothetical scenario talk like doesn't have to be exactly what happens in the story, but in character of them to do said action, I think (idk what I'm doing lmfao). 
* This part is where they decided to take a break and eat at the outdoor area (Floor 3, based on Kiyo's sketch of the guild). The remaining members in the guild does some hospitality at the background (cleaning up, etc.) to please Alakazam (to lighten up his mood, I guess?). 
* One or two members bring dishes (they bought from town because I recalled Beast didn't join the guild yet). They look displease and Alakazam notices and criticize of humons being rude. 
* This then leads to some debate on Humons (this part idk if Akalazam would even bother to "play along" with Lliam or just ignore his refutes and continues eating.) If he just continues to discuss, then some good stuff that happened with proof (had another member bring in letters from office to show appreciation) with Alakazam's counter argument based on the reports he heard.
* Along the line, they moved on to talking about the past humons (something something related to Lliam but maybe omit that part) and what they did to the pokemon world (is the Explorer heroes canon in this world, I know Tybo did with Rescue Team, like Chatot knows about that thing with Dialga. If so, then this is the turning point where Chatot sides with Lliam which comes a shocker to Alakazam
* But it ends up in "agree to disagree"

This section might/ought be removed because it's a bit "too much" and heavily focuses on Lliam

* Once they're done having a light meal, Alakazam suddenly speaks up and tells Lliam again that he is Stargazer. 
* Of course he denies that claim
* Frustrated that Lliam keeps that up then moves over that he sense that someone else is hiding in the office, implying there's a secret room at the right side (sense aura)
* Lliam will then summon that person and introduces themselves. Then some background how they met and why blah blah
* This reminded Alakazam and asks about the kingdom aftermath, Zorua, the Delphox, and one character (because what happened in his story)
* He will just claim he visited the kingdom in the past but not as Stargazer but someone else so that he can deny ever knowing who the foxes and are
* Afterwards, Alakazam will ask for Lliam's eyes in his ears to confirm, but he refuses with reasoning like "not his business, it's rude, etc."
* It will be back and forth until it pisses Alakazam off that Lliam isn't budging 

If previous section gets removed, this one will be linked to the "agree to disagree" part. 
* Then lastly, he asks why the door at the lower basement is locked then Lliam reveals it's an underground pond with cave systems surrounding it. Lliam sometimes uses it as shortcuts to reach a certain area faster, though exploring the caves itself is dangerous as it has links to some hidden mystery dungeons that hasn't reached the surface and they're quite tough so he locks it up for safety reasons. 
* Then it should be nightfall after all the talking and the guild members should return to the guild with bottles in hand (does it take 1 day or several days? I haven't read the stories yet sorry.)
