In this table, the total income of the past week was split into its core components, indicating how much every element contributed to the weekly profits. When a component brought losses, it was skipped so all components would sum up to 100%. This table is sorted by rank.
Higher-ranked players rely almost exclusively on dividends and wallet appreciation for profit. Trading has a maximum profitability cap associated with it since the number of trades you can make in a single cycle is limited. This is reinforced by the need to spend liquid to be able to hold coins that will generate profits over time in an exponential manner, stifling the profitability of trading higher-up.
On the other hand, trading can make up the bulk of income for the newer players It remains the primary method of climbing since it heavily differentiates between players, while dividends are more or less the same percentage-wise.
Auctions are a niche source of income most of the time, but can explain much of the rapid movement at later pages of the leaderboard.
As you can see, wallet appreciation starts being the main driving force of late-game income. This trend will deepen as long as dividends remain stagnant.
