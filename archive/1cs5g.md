Foreword
AntiDooM is an alternate universe comic in the world of the Doom games. The main narrative difference conducted here is on behalf of the demons who are depicted as intelligent and having their own history, laws and traditions. Yes, deviating from the rule of the series, the comic emphasizes the story over the spectacular bloody battles and sceneries. However, those are not excluded, so read at your own discretion.
All of the plot takes place after the events of Doom (2016), and other games in the series aren't taken into consideration. However, the designs and appearance of the demons and locations may contain elements from other parts and entries of the Doom series. The comic contains references to canonical events, places, and characters, but most of it is the author's fan fiction, based on their personal headcanon, theories, and ideas, as well as on other fans' ideas – many of which don't correspond to canon lore. Knowledge of the fandom is not necessary to understand what is happening, but it can significantly change the reader's perception of the story and the relationship with the characters.
This comic is nothing more than non-claiming fan art, created primarily for myself, as well as for the sake of training, as this is my first work of this kind. I don't deny the result is mediocre, but after all, nothing is done perfectly on the first try. This is just the first step towards something greater.

**p.6**
Wake up, your time has come.
Open your eyes, child of the Underworld.

**p.7**
Quiet.
You know why you're here. There's only a few of your kind, and every one of you is precious to us. Hell awaits your decisions.
You – a representant of a higher race. One of those in the hearts of which an inextinguishable flame burns...
...and your name?
Amanuil.

**p.8**
Archviles are one of the higher races belonging to the noble caste of demon lord-priests.
From the moment they're born, they strive to take possession of their own territory and to gather a following of lower-demon servants. This is usually not difficult, thanks to their outstanding intellect and unique abilities.
Archvile brothers usually show rivality and unfriendliness towards each other, even when circumstances force them to make contact with one another.
However, serious altercations are rare, and things usually don't go past verbal skirmishes or demonstrations of each other's abilities in order to assert their superiority over the competitor.

####Chapter 1: No Choice

**p.10**
Lord Ogthearn, a newcomer for the position of Keeper has arrived. His name is Amanuil.
So, Amanuil?

**p.11**
Imshe*, who is it you brought in, anyway?
The worthiest, as you've asked.
It would've been better to take the first purebred that came across.
You know as well as I do that the Great Womb is almost empty after the First Invasion. There is no choice.
Only Amanuil had a strong, fully formed body.

**vocative case - should it perhaps be Imsh instead?*

**p.12**
Strong body...
An Archvile should be strong not in his body, but in his mind and abilities – that is our main gift.
The gift given to us by the Great One!
Leave showing off physical strength for empty-headed idiots like Pozarey.

**p.13**
Master, I know of your distrust of the unpure.
Believe me, I would have never brought one of them if I had a choice.
No... Not again...
Calm down. I didn't say a word about your guilt.
Well done, at least you've brought someone.

**p.14**
Tell me this, instead:
How long did you have to wait before even one of them was born?
I didn't have to wait. The priestesses said they had been watching over one of the larvas for a long time. It should have been released long ago, but for some reason, it didn't want to go.
I took the liberty of helping him with this. I know that it's not allowed - he could have killed me or injured himself - but, sir, believe me, the others were absolutely unprepared.
Unclean, and even artificially liberated.
Ogthearn!

**p.15**
Why all this chatter? If I don't suit you, just tell me, and I'll leave.
No. Imshe is right: There's no choice. We need a Keeper now.
Come here.

**p.16**
I always personally test the ability to fight of my subordinates who have come into my domain.
It doesn't matter if they're here willingly or not.
For me, only the strong are needed; and the weak are banished.
Come on, knock me off my feet with only the power of fire. Prove you're not a weakling, and I'll turn a blind eye to all your flaws.
You want us to fight?

**p.17**
Fight!
Come on, imagine your worst enemy stands in front of you!
Hold on, couldn't you...
Silence!
Show me all your rage! Or are you not a demon?

**p.18**
Even though many of us don't possess defensive magics, you won't surprise me with that.
Show me something useful.
What, are you just going to stand still?
All right.

**p.24**
Aren't you capable of anything besides your stupid shield?
Or do you not want to be a Keeper? Or maybe you despise the gift given to you by the great Icon of Sin?
Then you have no right to call yourself an Archvile! Unpure whelp!

**p.26**
Are you well, master? Or should I call Alebran?
Can you hear me, master?

**p.27**
Horned one, are you crazy? We didn't agree on hurting each other.
You told me to show you what I can do.
I meant the abilities of our race! Any idiot can wave his fists around!
That's not enough, you still need to know who to use them against. If you thoughtlessly let yourself get under attack – like you have – then even the most powerful fire attacks won't help you.
I see, you like to try and play clever.
Well...

**p.28**
You may consider yourself passing the test.
But that doesn't mean I'm happy with what I saw.
I'd say empowerement* will do you good, and you will appreciate your true power.
Empowerement - what?
It's a thing after which your abilities' powers should increase.
It's called something a little different.
I don't care what its correct name is.
Your advisor will tell you the details.

**Not sure if this is a good translation, but the original doesn't seem to mean more.*

**p.29**
Hey, you! Get up and go show your new master his domain!
Also, explain to him his responsibilities and the law in this place! It's in your best interest for him to get it right!
And you, Amanuil, don't forget you got this position because no one else has yet applied for it.

**p.30**
The Keeper is a demon entrusted with overseeing an important object or place and coordinating the guardians for defending it. More duties and other details depend on specific cases.
Since this position is not considered very honourable among Archviles and few of them sign up for it voluntarily, the Keeper's duties often fall on very young individuals who have barely left the Womb and don't yet have plans for their lives.
"Newborns" are the most mendable for re-education during which their natural stubborness, inherent in all Archviles, is suppressed as much as possible, and goals that are in their masters' interests are imposed.

####Chapter 2: The Keeper's Abode

**p.31**
...and when I get fully dressed as a human, they will consider me one of them.
And when the Slayer comes, he will think I am not a demon and let me live. And you will all die!
Ryton, as always, with his "brilliant" ideas.
You're kidding, what if the Slayer really comes for us - out of nowhere?
Are you weighing yourself down with human trash to become one of them, seriously?
Yeah, if just one of your crazy ideas ever works, I'll bite my tail off.

**p.32**
Then prepare yourself to live without a tail. It doesn't suit you anyway.
So, why haven't we kicked him out of our group yet?
It would be boring here without him.

**p.34**
These guys are always so reckless. No duties, no worries...
And this one is even healthier and stronger than the previous one. I'm so screwed.

**p.35**
Did you say something?
No, no, master, nothing.
Then, please, tell me: How do I address you?
My name is Gilri, but you can call me anything, master. I shall respond to whatever you wish.
Hold on...

**p.36**
No, master, I beg you, don't hit me!
Stop! I never thought of hitting you.
I just wanted to say, enough of these honorifics in every sentence.
But...
Yes, I'm an Archvile, and, according to the racial hierarchy, you are inferior to me.
But let's agree on this: No more "my master" and the like.
Just call me by my name or use "you". Trust me, it will be much more pleasant for me. You've heard my name.
Yes.
That's good. Now, let's go, you will tell me and show me everything.
Also, you shouldn't react so roughly like that to every gesture I make, you haven't given me a reason to hurt you yet.

**p.37**
So, what do my duties entail?
To keep outsiders out of our main sanctuary and to keep order in it.
In case of a major invasion, there are Knights, the Master's task...
"Your".
Oops... Your task is only to tell them what to do. It's better to not risk your life and engage in battle directly only as a last resort.

**p.38**
Only as a last resort? Do you think I'm not strong enough too?
No no no! I didn't mean it like that! I saw you knock down the Warlord with one blow! Not many can boast of such success in a trial!
Not many? How many Keepers were there before me?
(bump)

**p.39**
The Liturris Sanctuary: The main place for carrying out many rituals and safekeeping our sacred valuables.
Looks quite nice.

**p.40**
Look, look! Gilri is bringing in that Archvile. I told you it's the new Keeper.
You lost the bet agai...
...again... Uh... Forget it.
If this one is as inadequate as the last one, I swear I will strangle him myself.
Hey, man, take it easy. We don't need problems with these flame guys. You know they're untouchable and all that.

**p.41**
I know, that's why they piss me off even more.
I just want to punch their smug, arrogant faces.
All right, let's at least not anger Ogthearn. He probably wouldn't like it if something happened to this Keeper.
Act friendly. I don't want to have their first impression of me ruined. 

**p.42**
We are pleased to welcome you, master! My name is Riton! And this is Ermer, my friend and one of your guards from now on.
He's always a little moody, but don't mind him.
We swear to serve you faithfully and, if need be, at the cost of our own lives!
I'm sure you will like it here...
Let's skip the formalities. Can you please get to the point?
Oh?
Y-yes, yes. You need a key to get inside...
...inside the sanctuary...
Ermer, give him the key.

**p.43**
There you go, this opens the gate right behind us.
Thank you.

**p.44**
This horned guy is suspicious. Too polite, and he didn't even listen to your flattering nonsense.
I've never seen an Archvile like that.
Yeah, it's a bit strange, but perhaps not too bad.
We'll ask Gilri later how things are.

**p.45**
So, what did you tell me about my duties?
Keeping order in and outsiders out, but that's not all, is it?
It's the main line of work, but we haven't had a Guardian in some time, so there might be more to do than usual.

**p.46**
I would also advise you, master--
I told you to not use that.
--Amanuil, to not leave the sanctuary for long in search of adventure. Ogthearn wouldn't like that.
I think he has more important things to do than to keep track of my actions and whereabouts.
So...
Are these books? I think you didn't tell me the most important thing.
Am I the Keeper of Knowledge?
Well, yes. I thought you were told that.
They just told me I'm a Keeper, but they didn't tell me any details. Looks like you should be the one to do so.

**p.47**
So, should I tell you everything, then?
Do you still need to ask? Go on, of course.
You'll need to rewrite all the books that were corrupted in the absence of a Keeper.
All important rituals are performed by Ogthearn, but you need to make the preparations for them and the clean-up afterwards.
You need to get rid of the Trites too, they weave their webs all over everything.
You have two dozen Hell Knights at your command. It would be better to immediately establish order among them that best suits you. True, they may be unhappy about it, but don't worry, they'll do anything you tell them to.
Ah! You need to be careful with your abilities around here, there are many flammable things here.
Do you want to take a look at everything in here?
The first place I want to see is where I'm going to be residing.
A Keeper should have his own personal space, right?
Yes.

**p.48**
Behind this door, master-- I mean...
...is your room.
And why are you standing here?
The master would never let me go in there.
I'm the master now, so come on in. We'll look around together.
Was there a fire here?
Yes, I heard one of the previous Keepers caused one.
It wasn't the one before you, though.
So, the last tenant's belongings are still here?
Yes... probably.

**p.49**
Tell me something about yourself. Since we have to work together, it's better to get to know each other more.
Well, uh... I've lived here my whole life. Uh...
I don't have much to say.
What about you?
What about me?
They dragged me into this world against my will and brought me here without explaining why. That's it. That's my whole life.
So you're still quite young.

**p.50**
You make it sound like that's a bad thing.
No, no! It's just that you know so much...
You overestimate me. I don't know more than any other "newborn" Archvile does. Don't you know anything about how things are with us?
Well, I know a thing or two from Ogthearn's words, but I don't really understand them.
And when did Ogthearn tell you those?
Not me personally. I heard them at congregations where he announces to everyone the Great One's will.
Imagine this: She appears in his dreams!
She does to any of us, if she sees it as necessary.

**p.51**
So, you were just sent out to coexist with an Archvile without any preparation?
Why didn't you read anything about us by yourself? There are plenty of books here, I'm sure something could be found. It would be useful for you as a Keeper's advisor.
B-but, I can't read.
Oh, they haven't even taught you that.
Well, I could help you with that.
Let's see what this place has to offer.
Here, maybe this will do.
Come here, don't be afraid.

**p.52**
Of course, I'm not going to teach you how to read right now.
But at least I'll tell you something.

**p.53**
See, there is a place called the Great Womb.
It's believed that when the Great Icon of Sin fell, her body exploded, and parts of it scattered across all of Hell. And on the remains of her womb, a huge bloody nest formed, which gave life to a new race: us, the Archviles.
This is where the name of the place comes from.
And there, in special capsules*, our bodies grow and develop. When the time comes, we emerge from them as adults with just enough knowledge and skills necessary to survive in this world.
However, our character, our habits and manners, remain as they were when we died in our past life.
That is why it seems to you that I've been alive for a long time.

**It really isn't referred to as anything less sterile or formal in Russian, sorry.*

**p.54**
So, you're not afraid to die, then? You don't lose anything.
We don't lose anything?
When we die, we forget our past destiny. We lose everything we had acquired: our status, territory, and much more. The only thing that's never forgotten or changed is our true name. Others may recognize us by it, but not everyone prefers to be called by it.
But sometimes death is good for us. For example, there's nothing worse for an Archvile than the loss of his abilities, for without them he is hardly able to achieve anything in life. Many of those who suffer this fate resort to the ritual of "liberation of the soul"...
...in fact, it's more like a voluntary, honourable public execution. A steel stake is driven through the poor being's forehead, and his body is exsanguinated.
(sigh)
Seems like I'm burdening you with useless information.

**p.55**
No, I'm interested, I would listen.
Some other time.
Here, you can look at the pictures for now, and I'll rest and gather my thoughts.
Shall I go, then?
Stay. No one will disturb you here, and you'll be safe.

**p.56**
The Archvile's main offensive ability is pyrokinesis, with the exception of particular cases of impure blood.
To use the full potential of his body during combat, the Archvile concentrates huge amounts of hellish energy in certain zones, which also causes visible changes. Lit up eyes and pupils narrowed down into small points, those are the first signs telling you to hide, away from the demon's sight. The temperature of the whole body rises and, if surrounding light is dim enough, blood glowing from within the veins can be seen alongside body parts with thinner skin.
At the same time, the Archvile's pain threshold increases significantly, and he becomes practically impervious to it. However, when he comes out of the berserk-like state, any wounds sustained will make themselves felt.

####Chapter 3: Initiation

**p.57**
Amanuil, this was a bad idea.
What if Ogthearn finds out? You can't leave the sanctuary for long, you must--
"You must be there at all times". Yes, I've already heard that from you, and I've told you what my opinion on that.
Nothing bad will happen if we take a little walk.
We can't stay locked up our entire life.

**p.58**
Hey, Emanuel!
Yes, yes, I'm talking to you.
My name's Amanuil.
I hear you're new here. Wanna get into local entertainment, eh?
Ogthearn is setting up fights again. So, now two dozen recruit Barons are going to go up against the elite of "His Majesty".

**p.59**
Whoever survives will get to join the highest rank in the Warlord's personal guard.
It promises to be a teeth-grinding spectacle.
And mind-blowing, in the truest sense of the word!
Well, isn't that lovely?

**p.60**
Oh no, I don't like fights.
Understandable. For a tough guy like you, fights aren't fun to watch.
They're something much more enjoyable to partake in.
But if you really don't enjoy this sort of fun, maybe you'll find it pleasant to grab a couple of portions of broth made from almost fresh human flesh, eh?

**p.61**
Or whatever you eat?
In any case, you can get some treats with little effort. What do you say?
Amanuil, I'm hungry. Come on, there'll be food  there.
But Ogthearn will probably be there too. Weren't you telling me just now that he'd better not catch a glimpse of us?
And you just wanted to take a walk.
After those lectures, I've almost changed my mind.
I won't do it again.
All right, but we're not going to the fights.
By the way, where are we going?

**p.62**
It's right through this tunnel. Once you exit it, I'd say you'll figure out the way yourself. You can't miss it.
Do you know him?
I think his name is Dzhar. He's the only Harvester here.
At least I think...
I haven't seen any others.
Is he always so pushy?
No idea. We don't know each other personally.

**p.63**
Grrr?
Relax. It doesn't matter where he goes.
Al said to just watch what he does. And now...
Huh, I think we have another quiet guy with unpure blood here.

**p.64**
Excuse me, is this the place to satisfy one's hunger?
Who the hell are you? Our Warlord doesn't allow any intruders on his grounds.
I'm here by his will. I'm the new Keeper, Amanuil.

**p.65**
Ah, another rookie. I see.
Well, take what you need.

**p.66**
"Archies are for minced meat", "Die, skeletal freaks"...
Not very polite.

**p.67**
Um, listen.
What?
I've come here recently and still settling in. Tell me, how are Archviles treated here in general?
If you're talking about common small vermin, then it's like anywhere else – they hate you, and they might squeak with fear at you.

**p.68**
And what about you?
I don't care. There's scum in any group.
More in some groups, less in others.
I take it we're in the former category. Have you known at least one Archvile you didn't dislike?
Well, you're all right, kinda.
You just ask a lot of questions.
But I'm not the only one, right?
There was the previous Keeper too.
His name was Ignus.
He would often ask for trouble, but...

**p.69**
Compared to others, he wasn't a bad guy.
Small vermin without a sense of humour disliked him for his dirty jokes.
Some even threatened to poison him.
Right, Gil?
Oh, really?
And where did he go?
I don't think anyone would dare to actually act on their threats.

**p.70**
Archviles...
Are you so sure that no matter what kind of shit you do, you get away with it?
I'd like to believe the right of untouchability is still somewhat respected here.
Some become so arrogant that the rule can't save them.
I've known some like that.
As for what happened to Ignus, I have no clue. And I don't really care.
I've only heard rumours of some of his lower-demon servants killing him, but no one knows how.
No one's seen his body, either. Eaten, probably.
Ogthearn then simply announced that he's dead, and that was the end.

**p.71**
In general, Keepers don't stay here for long. One thing happens, then another.
So if I were you, I wouldn't trust anyone here.
I'd also not interrogate the first stranger I come across like this.
All right, then.
Gilri, let's go.
Gilri?

**p.73**
These rookies are swarming around like the parasites in their guts.

**p.74**
(ugh)
What a garbage show.
Praise the Great One that I'm unable to see this horror, but the aura of a thousand bored demons kills me nonetheless.
You should be arranging fewer of these monotonous massacres. Everyone is already tired of them.
I'll do as many of them as I want. I'm in charge here.

**p.75**
Really, sir, perhaps you should attend to more mundane matters.
You may have forgotten, but you have a new Keeper. And he's still waiting for the initiation ceremony.
It's fine. It would be too much honour for an unpure one.
Let him stay in his dusty burrow. As long as he doesn't cause trouble.

**(Damn, it took the author over seventy pages in a non-porn comic to have a Tarantino moment and show their foot fetish? I'm not complaining about demon beans, but still. Some based guy in the comments asked for flat out R34.)*

**p.76**
Master! Maaaster!
There's something!
Lord Ogthearn!

**p.77**
Why is everyone annoying me?
I've said: As long as there's a single fighter left standing in the arena, don't bother me!
Master, don't be angry.
He must be bringing an urgent message, otherwise he wouldn't dare disturb you. Thar is not that stupid.
Let him talk.

**p.78**
Speak.
But if it's garbage, I will gut you and feed you to your own flock.
There's a strange demon in there, we haven't seen him before.
What other demon? Where?
Near the feeders. He's looking for someone, asking everyone about some Cacodemon.
An Archvile, I think, but I'm not sure. Looks like you, except he's pale and has horns.
Oh, yes, of course. Who could it be?
Was the news helpful, master?
No, get out of here.
Does Thar deserve a reward?
I said, get out!

**p.79**
Was he talking about the newcomer?
I hope it was about him.
Imshe, go check it out.
If it is him, tell him not to slack too much; and to keep his advisor at his person.
I understand your reluctance, master, to have a full ceremony.
But shouldn't we at least introduce Amanuil and announce that he is here with your permission, so as to prevent unrest among our minions?
I'd rather break his horns, not introduce him.
I'll do it later.
Do what? Break his horns or introduce him?
Both one and the other.
Why wait? The sister is right: There are demons from all over Raungarr here now. Tell them the Keeper has changed. Is that so difficult?
It's not difficult, but those meatheads are gonna get distracted by something, and they'll forget him again.

**p.80**
Then you'll have to go with the ceremony.
That's what they're for. All this pathos and noise about nothing attracts attention perfectly.
I still remember all of those events, but I've already grown bored of the emotions they evoke in the crowds.
You should bring something new to the event.
Like what? You've got a suggestion – say it; if not, then shut up and stop whining about your addiction.
Emotions are not an addiction but a need, one as natural as your need for power.
My people draw power and strength from them.
Yeah, yeah, we've already gone through this. I didn't care then, I don't care now.
So, what's the suggestion?
It's simple. I'm surprised such an obvious idea hasn't occured to you.

**p.81**
Send this Amanuil of yours to the arena, let him kill some useless vermin.
He'll be entertained, you will introduce him to the crowd, and the crowd will be delighted by the spectacle.
How about that?
That's more like it.
Well, you're useful sometimes too.
If you were more obedient, you might take place among my favourites.
But I can't stand overly domineering people.
All right, Imshe, bring him in there. We'll give him an "initiation" for sure.

**p.82**
(Khsh-sh-sh-s-s-s...)

**p.83**
Hey, Gilri!
Gilri!
Come to us!

**p.84**
What, not even a single burn or scratch on that cowardly ass of yours?
That new Archvile seems kinda indifferent towards you.
And I told you he wouldn't do anything to him!
All right, Gilri, tell us about him.
I made a bet with Ermer for some good stuff that this Archvile is actually a decent fellow.
If it turns out I'm right, I'll share it with you. I know you like giblets. 

**p.85**
Well, his name is Amanuil. He told me to address him with "you", never yelled at me, told me interesting things, and even let me live in his room with him. I was afraid to sleep next to him, though.
Wow...
See, there are some nice Archviles too!
As soon as I saw him, I thought he was different from the others. In a good way.
He's lying! You little bastards played me!
Come on, Ermer. Learn to take a loss.
I think we should try to get along with Amanuil, find a common ground.
Especially you. It's better to be on good terms with your superiors.
I don't like him.
With regular Archviles, you at least know what to expect, but with this...

**p.86**
Oh yeah, you always see negatively. What can a peaceful Archvile do that's so bad?
You never know what.
For instance?
I'd say, he wants to take power from Ogthearn and is gathering minions, that's why he's so kind.
Then, making friends with him is the best thing we can do now.
So.
There you are.

**p.87**
What was that about? As soon as I got distracted, you make yourself lost.
If you've got any personal business, you should tell me. I would let you.
I... I j-just...
All right, don't make excuses. Let's go, I think that was enough for a walk.
Master, wait! Look!

**p.88**
Um, I mean, if you're busy, I won't bother you.
I... It's... You're the Keeper of Knowledge, I thought.

**p.89**
It's a souvenir from the weak people.
People?
Yeah, the First Invasion and all that. You know.
I'm not sure I know what you mean. Events that happened while I was in the womb aren't a part of my inherited knowledge.
Huh?
I was born only fairly recently.
Ah!
All I know of is an image of a human being's appearance, and I believe the people of the Doom Slayer call themselves the people of Argenta.
No, those are different.
The elders call them the people of Earth. They are like those from Argenta, but they're weak, and their belongings and buildings are different. They were here, not right here I mean, but in this world. It's not really important, Raungarr wasn't affected by it, but Ogtearn said we could get involved nonetheless and take whatever we want from the weak people. So, I've gathered a lot of different things.

**p.90**
I have a whole collection! If you're interested, I'd be happy to show it to you.
(whoosh)
Amanuil, Lord Ogthearn asked me to tell you to not forget about your duties and to be diligent in fulfilling them. He also orders you to report to him at once.
What have I already done wrong?
The Gargoyles reported to Lord that they saw you. Your presence frightened them.
How awful. Can it wait a bit?
No. I am obliged to escort you to him immediately. This is for your own good.

**p.91**
All right.
An interesting thing, but I have to leave. Here you go.
No, no, you can have it.
Listen, if you're just giving it to me because I'm of a higher caste than you, I won't be happy about it.
It's customary for us to share. It's a gift. Take it.
In that case, thank you. I would like to take a look at the rest of your collection, hopefully there'll be some other time.

**p.92**
Did you see that? He liked that human thing.
If we give him gifts like that, we can make friends with him.
An Archvile friend would be so cool! All the other packs would be jealous of us.
You want to bribe a highborn demon and gain his trust in case of a takeover?
That could work if anyone else would be down for it, but no one is.
Then why don't we work together? We're a team!

**p.93**
No, Riton, I'd like to support you, but you yourself know...
This is an Archvile! He's calm and quiet now, but then something will snap in his head - and that's it, we're screwed!
Yeah, I've heard they all go crazy sooner or later, in their own ways. They say it's a side effect of their abilities or something, I'm not sure.
Come on, guys, I'm sure it's not that bad.
He seems friendly, and Gilri said...
Gilri's a coward and a whiner, do you really believe all that?
Of course I do. He's shy, but he's still closer to the Keepers than any of us.
He definitely knows more about them.

**p.94**
He don't know nothing! I also worked with the Archviles, and let me assure you, they're all crazy.
Cleaning dirt from under Ogthearn's claws and him promising not to incinerate you in return doesn't count as working with them.
Oh...

**p.96**
Well, is anyone up to this?
No, nobody's gonna help you with that!
All your idiotic plans always end in failure, and it's us who suffers from it.
You're suffering? Do you remember who found the way to save us from the Slayer back then?
Uh, Riton, that's all well and good, and even a bit of fun, but half of our pack was crushed by a slab of metal.

**p.97**
Weeeell...
I also tamed Droolie. He defended our pack from a herd of Spectres and, by the way, risked his life.
And then he got hungry and smashed the nest himself, devouring our entire future generation.
We still haven't recovered, and I see you're not even going to help us do so.
Things can't be always bad. Come on, I swear, everything will be fine this time. Just play along.
Do you like Ogthearn better?
(So-so idea) (Not) (Sorry, but no)
We don't like any of them, but at least we're used to Ogthearn. Besides, we don't need any Archvile friends.
You stay out of this before you get into any more trouble. Word of advice: One more plan of yours ends with dead people, you're exiled.

**p.98**
Ermer?
No!
(Nobody cares)

**p.100**
What's that in your hands?
That Imp gave it to me. Said it belonged to humans. It looks interesting.
Imps are curious little boys. Anything they see, they drag into their nests.
You shouldn't spend a lot of time in their company and accept their gifts. Their toys can be dangerous.

**p.101**
This thing doesn't look threatening. There are some symbols, letters, and it glows.
It's hardly a weapon, more like a tablet? An artifact?
It's not of our world. Who knows what it was used for.
Amanuil.
If you choose to collect and study otherworldly artifacts, don't devote others to your endeavors.
They may spread rumors that get to Lord Ogthearn, and he would not approve.
But you won't tell him, will you?
I should...

**p.102**
But I won't unless it poses a threat to all of us.
Leave your advisor here.
He can find a place to look at the competitions from.

**p.103**
Here, be careful and don't lose it.
Isn't it dangerous? Amanuil, I'm scared.
Don't worry, it won't eat you.
Why did Ogthearn summon me? It's not just because of the Gargoyles?
You'll find out on your own.
And plase, do whatever he says.
Lord Ogthearn is in a bad mood and more unstable than ever in his decisions and desires.
I'll try, but I don't promise anything.

**p.104**
Master.
Amanuil is here, as you requested.
Now then, you.

**p.105**
Get in the arena and show the demons what you can do.
I will introduce them to you so that this little thing won't come running to me, panicking, every time they see your face.
Is it clear, what I want from you?
Now go already. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll be able to do your direct duties.
So will I have to do something special?
Don't worry, it's nothing complicated.
I'll throw you some feeble victims, like Imps or the Unwilling, and you'll deal with them in the most refined way you can think of.
Now you can also show off your strength.
You were so eager to throw punches before.

**p.106**
Excuse me, is it necessary to kill someone in order to introduce myself?
Absolutely. Make a good first impression. You don't want to publicly disgrace yourself and be remembered by everyone as a spineless weakling?
But not wanting to kill unnecessarily is not a sign of weakness.
Yes, it is. Your superiority must be constantly shown, so that everyone can see it, know it, and fear it.
Those who are confident in their powers don't need to constantly show them off.
And what did these, as you put it, feeble victims do to deserve to be killed for nothing?
Listen, smart guy, you were brought straight from the Womb to a warm place, given a post, provided with accommodation, and after that you still dare to show your character here?

**p.107**
If it weren't for me, there's no telling what nest you'd be lying in as fertilizer for the bodies of inferior creatures. With your behavior, I don't expect another outcome anyway.
If it weren't for you, I'd still be in the Womb, safe and sound.
I'm thankful for everything, but I also have a small request, if I may.
You may not.
I see, the news that you are the only candidate for this post gave you confidence, and you think that I will treat you like the chosen one.
No, I will not!
Remember once and for all: Your opinions, feelings, interests, likings, and other dreck - I don't give a damn about them.
You're already indebted to me.

**p.108**
And if you think that by getting on my nerves you'll get rid of my orders, you're sorely mistaken.
You have two choices:
One, you keep your mouth shut, do as I say, and don't get smart when I don't ask.
Two, you give up the first and go rot in the Point of No Return.
It's such a miserable place, many would rather die than to be sent there. The Great One herself bequathed to send the undesirable there. She alone knows why, but I, like any self-respecting Archvile, obey her will.
So, if you think you've got the right to contradict me, you will go there, and I will assure that your name would be spread with shame and dishonour through the whole of Hell for a hundred more rebirths!
All right. Have you finished your angry monologue? Can I speak now?

**p.109**
Shut your mouth, you filth-blooded mongrel! You don't understand the words; I'll throw you out myself!

**p.110**
Don't make me hurt you again. Believe me, I don't want that.
I don't want problems, and I hope you don't either. So, for common sense's sake, calm down and listen to me.

**p.112**
You can be as strong and willful as you want, but you're nobody, and you're alone.
Enough!
Throw him in the arena.
All right, all right, I see your methods. I will enter the arena myself. But I'm not going to main someone without a good reason.
I'll give you a reason.

**p.113**
May I ask everyone to shut their maws and turn their faces here!
Not a long time has passed since the passing of the Keeper of Knowledge, Ignacios.
I know many disliked him, but one should not judge the righteous children of the Great One! Only his mother can judge him now.
And so...

**p.114**
I'm introducing to you the new Keeper! He's not pureblooded, but I am willing to give him a chance!
A recent tragedy, caused by no fault of our own, took the lives of many of you, and we have to make do with what we have.
His name is Amanuil!

**p.115**
You all know how I feel about these pathetic, horned imitations of true Archviles!
They lack even a fraction of the greatness, the power that are given to us, the purebloods!
So let's not judge our fresh new Keeper harshly and demand the impossible from him!
He will simply show us what he is able to do to the best of his modest abilities!

**p.116**
Remember him like that!

**p.117**
Well, what are you waiting for? One dead Imp is too much of an opponent for you?
Are you kidding me?

**p.118**
Of course I'm kidding.
Onaira.
Yes?
Fly to the other side, there are recruits waiting. Pick someone who's dumb enough to go up against an Archvile.
What for? Just let the big guy they told to bring the Imp in fight. He's standing right there anyway.
No. Don't let the guards in, even if they volunteer.
Why not?
All right, I see your point.
That's why Imshe is better than you – she doesn't ask so many questions.

**p.119**
Don't worry, I won't hurt you. You can go.
I-I can't. He'll kill me if I try.
And y-you?
I've told you, I'm not going to hurt you.
So Ogthearn just snatches the first guy he sees and turns him into a plaything for a kill? How is that fair?
Our master is good to us, he'd never send someone into the arena just like that.
My pack disowned me. Exiles are handed over to Lord Ogthearn and receive something good in return. This is the last bit of good I can do for my pack.
That's how it's done, I have to accept it.

**p.120**
You don't have to try justify Ogthearn. I can see that's not your opinion but his, imposed upon you. Even your life is worth something. I just can't believe that someone like you could do something so horrible so as to deserve to be torn to pieces.
I'll get you out of here as soon as this is over. All right?
Look, our Keeper is so overconfident that he refused an easy victory and asked for an opponent beyond his abilities!

**p.121**
I didn't ask for a strong opponent!
Stop the fight!
Ogthearn, you (??)
What if he kills Amanuil or wounds him severely?
He won't, the idiot is more likely to maim himself.
But if something happens to him...
Calm down, nothing will happen. What are you so afraid of?
Anyway, if things don't go just according to план*, Onaira will take control of the Gladiator.

**(Translator's note: план means plan)*

**SUDDENLY CLIFFHANGER AND ON HOLD, AMAZING**
