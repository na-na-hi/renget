Nerissa stood naked in a hotel bathroom with her clothes folded neatly by the sink. Careful to avoid snagging on her horns, she pulled a long white t-shirt over her nude body, the hem falling a few inches below her butt. She briefly twirled in front of the mirror to make sure she was properly modest. Wearing anything to bed was annoying (she could never fully ignore the unnecessary layer of fabric sticking to her bare skin all night) but such concessions had to be made when rooming with someone else. She gathered her clothes against her chest and opened the bathroom door to a dark room humming with the mild chill of air conditioning.

As she crawled into bed and sunk into the downy embrace of her pillow, Nerissa allowed the knotted anxieties of the day to disentangle and wash over her body. All those technical hiccups and rushed errands felt far away within her drowsy, semi-conscious state. Her body and mind were more than ready to slip away.

But rest did not come so easily; for only six feet away, Shiori, her roommate, was very much awake.

“The two girls stared unblinkingly at their ceilings,” Shiori said to a hypothetical third party, smiling to herself and lending her voice a giddy texture. “Neither was willing to break the silence that had claimed the room since settling down for the evening. To think these young maidens were forced to spend the night together so early on in their budding friendship…it was no wonder that sleep eluded them!”

Nerissa sighed and tried to cover her ears with one of the pillows. On most occasions she would relish the sweet tones of Shiori’s narration, but it was well past midnight and they had less than five hours separating them from the dawn of another hectic day. 

Shiori prattled on. “The midnight air was simmering with tension but neither of them could place it; was it purely platonic? Romantic? Or…perhaps…*erotic*?!” Shiori turned towards Nerissa, yellow, cat-like eyes gleaming through the dark. “The obtuse feelings were bubbling up inside Nerissa’s heart, aching for release. Oh, if only she had the guts to confess how she truly felt to the gorgeous goth girl beside her!”

“Please, you know I love you, Shiori, but I’m trying to sleep,” Nerissa groaned and hugged the pillow to her face. “Let’s pick this up in the morning, ‘kay?”

Shiori seemed to consider this and turned onto her back, once again looking at the ceiling. The silence lasted five seconds. “Tragically, the inexperienced demoness didn’t know how to close the distance between them. The heart-wrenching failures of past encounters kept her guarded against any romantic intentions, no matter how forward.”

Nerissa rolled her eyes.

“But Nerissa couldn’t be blamed,” Shiori continued, a certain lecherousness seeping into her words. “How was she supposed to know how long Shiori had been prepping for this particular rendezvous? How was she supposed to know that Shiori had successfully conquered her gag reflex, trained her dexterous tongue to tie cherry stems into all sorts of knots, and forced herself to swallow *anything* edible, no matter how salty or bitter?”

Now Nerissa was fully awake. And so was her lower half. Hesitantly she reached down to fondle her cock, embarrassed to find it already semi-erect and slick with precum. Goddammit. She’d been abstaining for far too long, the hustle and bustle of travel leaving her without a good time to jack off during the week. And being around Shiori’s unguarded bombshell body certainly didn't help. Her poor balls were full and aching, and a deep well of desire began pulling Nerissa from her designs for slumber.

From the corner of her eye, Shiori watched Nerissa’s bedsheets shift and roll as the songstress reached between her thighs. Just a little more...

“Still, Nerissa couldn’t help herself. She’d gone so long without proper release and her self control finally buckled in those lonely hours. At least she had her hands to keep her company, as she was far too cowardly to pursue an actual woman. Ah, the thoughts of courting Kiara were surely nothing more than a fantasy if she couldn’t even take advantage of the voluptuous vixen right beside her!”

Nerissa’s bed frame creaked. The lamp on the bedside table snapped on, bathing the room in harsh yellow light. Shiori, barely hiding her smile, slowly turned her head to see Nerissa’s imposing figure lording over her, arms crossed under her enormous breasts. She looked tired, frustrated, and extremely horny.

“Get on your knees, *darling.*” Nerissa spat, yanking Shiori off her bed with unnatural strength and throwing her to the ground. The thin carpet dug roughly into her bare knees. “If you insist on being so impatient, then we’re playing by my rules. I’m not gonna be gentle tonight, you know?”

Shiori’s breath quickened (nearly panting, really) as her body processed Nerissa’s threat. She looked up at her raven-haired friend, the shadowed form of her tall hourglass figure shifting beneath her t-shirt’s practically translucent material, and watched the absurd jiggle of those fat, shirt-straining tits. Though the true object of Shiori’s affection sat much lower. Hanging heavy and free below her t-shirt was Nerissa’s impressive package, her meaty cock and balls slapping against her inner thigh whenever she shifted her weight. The sheer mouthwatering size was almost hypnotizing in its own right, and the faint smell of drying sweat and musk drifting lazily to Shiori’s nose worked as a potent aphrodisiac.

After swallowing her saliva, Shiori quickly uncapped a roll of lipstick from her pocket. She spread it nice and thick over her lips, coating them in a shimmering inky black that made them look even fuller against her pale skin. She smacked them together a few times to ensure an even coat, then met Nerissa’s intense glare. 

“In a sudden rush of emotion, Nerissa pulled Shiori from the sheets and forced her to her knees! Maybe there was some fire in her after all. Shiori knelt there, unsure if Nerissa could take the necessary steps to truly bring her to heel. Nerissa was, after all, a run-of-the-mill *stacy* whose idea of playing rough in the bedroom was a light spanking during foreplay. Shiori wished to be utterly *dominated*, but would this milquetoast demoness be able to even read the definition of ‘ryona’ without passing out like a litt-”

**SMACK!**

Nerissa’s hand struck Shiori firmly across the left cheek and sent her skull swiveling viciously to the side. The impact echoed through Room 305 like a whip cracked from the shadows. After a shuddering breath, Shiori righted herself, a dull pink claiming the entirety of her cheek from below the eye. Her smile returned, more manic than ever.

It took Shiori a moment to settle her rattled brain and remember how to speak. “Such violence! Had anyone in Advent seen this side of Nerissa before? A good start…but unfortunately, it was nowhere near enough. Shiori noted, with disappointment, that it felt more like a fake slap you would see in a theater club. And considering Nerissa’s weak constitution it was unlikely that she cou-”

**WHAP!**

A vicious backhand from the right side, this time strong enough to jostle Shiori’s upper body and send a spray of spittle to the floor. Before she could brew up another cheeky retort, the demoness brought down her fury again and again, wide sweeping arcs slicing through the air with plenty of runway to build up speed before smacking violently against the supple flesh of Shiori’s face. The archivist’s hair spun and twirled as Nerissa tenderized her delicate doll-like features like a misbehaving whore, nary a sound escaping the kneeling girl’s lips but lurid moans of unabashed masochistic pleasure. Spit and droplets of blood flew from Shiori’s lips and nose, flecking against the carpet and cabinets. Nerissa hit and *hit* and **hit**, her shoulder growing sore from the exertion, until the small bones in her hand tingled from the relentless impacts against Shiori’s swelling cheeks.

When Nerissa stayed her stinging hand, she could see bruised, reddened skin replacing Shiori’s paleness and small teardrops building in the corners of her wild yellow eyes. Stray loops of ruffled bangs splayed across her forehead. Shiori hiccupped and tried to sniffle the thin ribbon of blood seeping out from her left nostril, her breath coming through raspy and uneven. 

As much as Shiori wanted to mouth off, her lips weren’t cooperating. Her jaw felt heavy and out of place, words were mushy and mumbly, her head a sloshing pool of pain and lust. “*Nngh*… Sh-Shiori’s head was shpinning after taking on Nerissa’s pent up aggression. She could feel blood trickling down to her lips and a bit of…w-wetness between her thighs.” Shiori audaciously fingered the front of her damp underwear; she must have squirted a bit sometime after the tenth backhand. “She was pleasantly surprised by Nerissa’s assertiveness, and could only pray she hadn’t run out of steam.”

That wasn’t going to be an issue, not with Nerissa so perfectly agitated. Nerissa lifted up her shirt, hoisted her monster of a dick in hand, and casually flopped it atop Shiori’s upturned face, using her beautiful, bruised features as a personal cockrest. Half of Shiori’s face disappeared beneath Nerissa’s girth, leaving only one prying eye peeking out from the side.

Lightly slapping her cock on Shiori’s brow, Nerissa spoke with acute softness: “I’m sure there’s something you want even more than my palm across your face, hmm? Give me all the love you can down there before we really get started.”

Shiori mumbled something unintelligible then closed her eyes and flared her nostrils, drinking deep from the musk pouring off Nerissa’s dick. She puckered her lips to bathe the bottom of Nerissa’s girthy shaft in a barrage of tender loving kisses, each more passionate than the last. The final few heavy lip smacks left picture-perfect impressions of their shape along its length, though the heat and sweat soon melted them into unrecognizable inky blots.

Pointedly high off of cock musk, Shiori couldn’t help but set aside her pretentious third person narration and addressed Nerissa directly. “How’d ya manage to hide this thing under that tight skirt all these months? It’s frickin’ *humongous!*” She switched into that specific goofy tone of voice she used exclusively for telling jokes as she tried to circle its girth with her fingers. “Golly, Nerissa, I thought you were the Demon of Song, not the Demon of Schlong!”

Nerissa guided the head of her cock to Shiori’s face, firmly rubbing her frenulum around those shiny, puckered, dickpolishing lips. “I’m the Demon of *Sound,*” Nerissa corrected with a growl, “and let’s just say what little magic runs through my blood is more than enough to hide my body’s more…intimidating aspects. Now open wide, Shiorin~!”

Shiori happily lowered her jaw and let Nerissa ram her cock against the back of her throat, instantly smashing her uvula against the roof of her mouth. After soaking in the warmth of Shiori’s maw for a few seconds, Nerissa yanked her back, thick globs of saliva following the archivist's mouth on the way out. A deep cough racked Shiori’s throat and she spat messily onto the floor.

“*Hahh…hahh…*. Oh good *GOSH*, ouchie! I…I don’t think my little throat could handle much more than that.” She looked up and wiped the saliva from her bottom lip, noticing with a small amount of panic (and glee) that the thick black ring left by her lipstick sat only about a third of the way up Nerissa’s shaft. 

Nerissa immediately reinserted the slick head of her cock onto Shiori’s flattened tongue, then wrapped her hand around the back of her head. “I don’t really care what you can or can’t do. You’re my toy for tonight, remember? Now…any final words, my little bookworm? I won’t be able to hear your precious voice for much longer~.”

Shiori's eyes grew wide with anticipation. Though her speech was garbled around the fat cock filling her mouth, Nerissa could clearly interpret her four, expertly chosen words. The last word in particular came through with rage-inducing clarity: *Do your worst, **normie.***

Nerissa curled her fingers into the roots of Shiori’s bi-colored hair and violently yanked her head forward like she was ripping the pull starter of a chainsaw, *spearing* the virgin depths of her throat with every inch of her massive, sweaty futa cock. Her battering ram of a dick happily ignored the firm resistance of Shiori’s tight esophageal walls until the archivist’s nose smashed painfully into Nerissa's pelvis. One hand was all Nerissa needed to manhandle Shiori’s mouth up and down the length of her steelhard erection. Uncontrollable *glucks* and *hrcks* vibrated through Shiori’s throat as her body tried to expel something that was far too big to fit inside.

“*Mmff.* And here I thought you’d…*nggh*… ‘conquered your gag reflex’? That was only step one so don’t pass out yet, okay?” Nerissa giggled.

Nerissa grit her teeth and thrust like a beast in heat, her large buttocks clenching and firing her hips forward to slam into Shiori’s mouthpussy with as much inhuman force as her demonic body could muster. The hot wet walls of the Shiori’s saliva-laden innards felt tailor made to swallow and squeeze her dick. Sweat and spittle splattered out from Shiori’s lips as Nerissa’s angry cock plowed through her throat like she was trying to impregnate her stomach.

This kind of abuse sent Shiori into an abject paradise. She could tell from the ruthlessness of her partner's actions that she’d been soundly demoted from human being to living sex toy, and barely had time to breathe between having her nostrils pressed against Nerissa's pelvis and various fast-flying sex juices rushing up her airways. Everything was sweat, musk, and the constant rhythm of the throat-filling cock pistoning down into her gullet. She could feel herself being stretched out both physically and mentally as her mind succumbed to the overdose of white hot pleasure frying her brain each time Nerissa bottomed out in her throat. She grabbed Nerissa’s free hand and guided it behind her head to join the other, urging the demoness to properly brutalize her vocal cords.

“Sorry, darling, was that too gentle?” Nerissa sneered, and used both hands to drive Shiori’s face deeper into her crotch like she was trying to crush her skull.

In the frantic midst of breeding Shiori’s mouth, Nerissa noticed a strange resistance midway along her stroke, a tightness that seemed only an inch or two across. She looked down to see Shiori’s lacy black choker straining and stretching every time her massive cock plunged downwards, some seams already tearing themselves apart from the intrusion. Smiling, Nerissa upped the length and power of her strokes, dredging up even more slimy saliva and raising the guttural sounds of her sloppy throating to an ear-filling din. Nerissa’s plump, heavy balls rode the increased momentum and swung up to clap against Shiori’s poor chin. The violent facefucking finally took Shiori’s strained choker to the limit, audibly snapping off her bulging neck like a slingshot as rivulets of precum and drool rolled down her throat and pooled in the depressions of her collarbone.

Despite getting everything she wanted and more, icy pangs of fear slid around Shiori’s heart. Oxygen was rapidly thinning out. A low ringing was building up from behind her ears, dampening the sultry grunts and moans from Nerissa who seemed miles away. Her vision blurred, though whether that was from her lack of air or her teary eyes she couldn’t tell. Instinctively, Shiori struck both hands against Nerissa's powerful thighs, attempting to shove her back or at least signal her distress.

Nerissa didn’t budge.

Panicking, Shiori balled her hands into fists and punched weakly at her partner. She looked up to see Nerissa pounding away with a heavy blush across her sweat-streaked face, her deep red eyes alight with total satisfaction. And how could she be feeling anything less? In between her legs was the most incredible cocksleeve she’d ever used, a promiscuous pale-skinned beauty with a mouth apparently heaven-sent to drain semen.

Shiori started bucking horribly, her entire body convulsing in an attempt to fix her burning lungs. Her nose and throat were thoroughly clogged! She couldn’t breathe! Fat drops of tears welled up in her eyes and spilled down her cheeks, dragging thick trails of running mascara like rivers of dark watercolor down a fresh canvas. The mascara soon thinned and blurred with the rest of the juices soaking into her features, stamping messily onto Nerissa’s pelvis when she pounded Shiori’s mouth forward for the hundredth time. Sloppy strands of sweat, pre-cum, and liquid makeup bounced and compressed between Shiori’s face and Nerissa’s crotch in an obscene, gooey slurry. The archivist's precisely applied makeup was a garish runny mess of its former self, perfectly reflecting the state of the ravaged, asphyxiating throatslut wearing it.

Nerissa didn’t let up, not for a single breath, as Shiori’s muffled, gargled cries grew more desperate and her hands slammed into Nerissa’s thick thighs like she was pushing against death’s door itself. The constant, *wonderful* gagging and stuttering half-swallows only urged Nerissa’s climax along, and solidified Shiori’s mouth as Advent’s premiere cum toilet.

“Fuck, *I’m coming!*” Nerissa moaned, digging her fingers into Shiori’s hair as she tensed up and unloaded the entirety of her overstuffed balls in the archivist’s helpless throat. Shot after ropey shot of pent up ball batter erupted from her throbbing shaft, each one more than enough to bloat a condom to bursting. 

Midway through the climax, Shiori’s resistance was fully snuffed out. With a gurgled whimper, Shiori's hands fell limp against Nerissa's thighs, then slid down to the floor, unmoving, as ropes of thick futa spunk continued pumping unimpeded down her tight throat. Shiori’s eyes went glassy and unfocused, only marginally aware of the fat cock pulsing in her throat or the dense ropes of jizz piling up deep into her stomach. As snot and cum bubbled out of her nostril, Shiori twitched fiercely and squirted a clear, pathetic spray of girlcum into her sodden panties.

This, Shiori thought in her cockdrunk haze, was nothing short of ecstasy!

Panting and shivering, Nerissa held Shiori close, watching her throat involuntarily spasm and her eyes dim almost to the point of no return. Ten seconds passed. Then thirty. In the back of her mind, Nerissa knew any longer would be a genuine threat to her life. Reluctantly, she loosened her death grip on Shiori’s head and stepped back, unsheathing her enormous bitchbreaker with a grotesquely wet-sounding squelch. Jizz and throat slime gave her cock a heavy sheen, and thick strands of spit remained stubbornly connected to Shiori’s well-used mouth.

With nothing left to hold her, Shiori pitched forward and collapsed onto the carpet in a large puddle of glimmering spit and semen. Seconds passed without so much of a twitch of her finger.

Suddenly her eyes shot wide open and a deep, guttural inhalation filled her lungs, sputtering with the myriad of futa juices she’d been drowned in. She heaved a torrent of cum where she lay, clearing her airways enough to take her first full breath of pure oxygen in what felt like hours. She coughed and gagged and rubbed her wrecked throat as her body slowly thrummed back to life.

Nerissa circled around, watching her struggle for a simple breath of air. She looked terribly sad, like a salmon flopping aboard a boat’s deck. “Shiorin~! Are you still with us?” Nerissa asked in a singsong voice, as she leaned forward and drove her foot deep into Shiori’s stomach.

Shiori gasped and curled up from the pain, more bile and spit leaving her mouth. She didn’t have the energy to guard. Nerissa wound back and kicked her once more, driving Shiori’s body off the ground and slamming her back against the TV cabinet. Nerissa’s eyes traveled down to Shiori’s skirt, smiling at the wetness leaking from her pussy.

“You really are hopeless,” Nerissa said, now wearing a genuinely warm smile as she knelt down to pick up the quivering mess of a genmate. “C’mon now, let’s get you cleaned up.” Nerissa carried her toward the bathroom and gently set her beside the tub. It didn't take long for her to run a hot bath, occasionally sliding her forearm through the water to test the temperature.

The soothing humidity and sound of running water slowly roused Shiori from her broken state. She sat up, blinked, and rubbed the back of her sleeve against her nose to soak some of the blood that had been dripping onto her lap. “O-oh, you don’t need to worry about me, you should go back to bed, Nerissa.”

Ignoring her offer, Nerissa tore off a few squares of toilet paper and handed them to Shiori. “These work better than your clothes. Is anything broken?”

Shiori tested the bridge of her nose and her bottom jaw. There was a dull pain but nothing serious. “Nope! I’m good.”

“Then your bath awaits," Nerissa said as she stripped off her single sweat-stained piece of clothing. "Can you stand?”

Shiori nodded, shakily getting to her feet. Nerissa entered the bath first and Shiori followed soon after, carefully sitting down and leaning back against the soft warmth of the demoness’ huge chest. While Nerissa hummed to herself and studied the ceiling tiles, Shiori splashed water on her face to wipe clear the last dregs of mascara. The two of them sat still in the soapy water, breathing in the scent of each other and letting their sore, battered muscles relax.

“S-sorry for teasing so much.” Shiori whispered after a good five minutes of silent soaking. Her voice was still scratchy and hoarse. It would likely take a day or two for her throat to adequately recover from that kind of abuse.

Nerissa sighed and pulled her closer, a bit of water splashing over the rim. She stroked her fingers through the sleek mangled knots of hair she’d just used as handlebars not ten minutes ago. “It’s fine,” Nerissa said, covering a yawn with the back of her hand. “Just keep it in your pants until morning next time, ’kay?”

“Okay… And, uh, did I go too far with the normie comment?” Shiori asked, timidly. She could feel Nerissa’s muscles tense up at the question.

“Well…it did piss me off a little,” Nerissa snuggled her face next to Shiori’s, “but I’ll always forgive *you*, Shiorin~.”

Shiori smiled to herself. It was somewhat mean-spirited to keep track of the specific insults that really pushed Nerissa’s buttons, but that always led to a more violent (and satisfying) session afterwards. She couldn’t wait for the next collab, for the next opportunity to tease and poke at Nerissa on stream. Knowing full well what would happen as soon as the mics and camera went off.
