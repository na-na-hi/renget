Comment: “Pessimistic, depressive, melancholic, extremely helpful, compulsive, expects everyone to hate her, gets VERY happy when someone’s kind to her, has a soft spot for children, low self-teem, if you manage to cheer her up with kindness, she will be the sweetest girl ever and will love you very much.”
