Ace detective Miroku-san's case files.
 
Suz: You know, I've been feeling some weird presence lately.
 
Aya: A presence?
 
Suz: Yeah. Kind of like I'm being watched by someone, but when I turn around to check, there's nobody there.
 
Shi: Must be your imagination.
 
Suz: No no, there's no way it's just that! Maybe it's a fan of mine, secretly watching from the shadows?
 
Yum: I cannot think of a single quality that would gain you a fan.
 
Shi: Kusunoki might have some fans, though. I bet there are some Sentinels who secrely admire you.
 
Suz: Yeah I can see that.
 
Meb: What a farce.
 
Suz: What would you do~? If there was a hidden Mebu fan club?
 
Meb: Add thirty more hours to their daily training as a part of club's rules.
 
Suz: That doesn't even make sense time-wise!
 
Aya: Ah... Now that you mention it, I've noticed something strange lately too.
 
Yum: Kokudo-san, you too?
 
Aya: Yeah. I occasionally clean the Sentinels' rooms when they ask me to.
 
Suz: Oh yeah, I ask her from time to time too. You're so good at making things nice and tidy, Ayaya. You're a lifesaver.
 
Aya: Thank you very much. But sometimes the things in the room would be scattered in an unnatural way...
 
Yum: Would that not be the fault of the room's owner?
 
Aya: Hmm... But I think they were scattered differently from how it normally is. The clothes and things looked like they were violently thrown around...
 
Shi: Definitely your imagination.
 
Meb: Yeah. I don't think it's anything serious... But I'll look into it.
 
Yum: The wind is certainly strong today.
 
Aya: Apparently there's a typhoon approaching. It will hit Kagawa by night.
 
Suz: Seriously!? Mebu, I'm scared! What if the Tower falls down? We all need to evacuate right now!
 
Meb: It won't fall.
 
Suz: But what if!?
 
Meb: I'm a carpenter's daughter, you know. The Tower's earthquake and wind resistance are perfect, I've checked.
 
Suz: Mebu, I'm gonna fall in love right now. 
 
Meb: Alright, I'm off to training.
 
Suz: Ah. So you're going to train even in a typhoon...
 
Yum: And thus, night fell. Both wind and rain grew ever stronger. The Sentinels were locked inside the Tower by the storm... And trouble occurred!
 
Aya: Kyaaaa!
 
Suz: What's wrong, Ayaya!?
 
Yum: Is something the matter!?
 
Aya: I came to return a book I borrowed from Mebuki-senpai... And she...
 
Suz: Sh-She's dead!
 
Yum: Mebuki-san... Is sprawled on the floor buck-naked!
 
Suz: Are you dead!? Mebuuu! 
 
Yum: However, that was merely the beginning of the events.
 
Sent A: Aah! My room's been ravaged!
 
Sent B: I saw something glimmer in a corner at the viewing platform!　It's a will'o'the'wisp, I tell you!
 
Sent C: When I came out of the toilet, something attacked me! There's even a wound!
 
Yum: The string of inexplicable occurences continued.
 
Suz: Just, just what is happening?
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai doesn't seem to be in danger, but she's not well enough to talk yet.　The medical staff said there weren't any signs of physical trauma either.
 
Yum: Due to the typhoon, our Gold Tower has completely turned into a locked room. And in this locked room of ours, more and more people fall victims to something.
 
SHI: Nah, they're probably on the edge and exaggerating. It's gotta be their imagination.
 
Suz: Oh, so you switched.
 
Yum: Now that it has come to this... I shall avenge Mebuki-san! I shall solve this mystery and bring the culprit into the daylight! By the name of Miroku! 
 
Suz: Miroku-san, you just wanted to say that.
 
Yum: First of all, we shall inquire with the suspects.
 
Aki: To think you asked me to suddenly come to the viewing platform... To give a testimony?
 
Suz: Oh yeah, I bet Sensei could kill someone without batting an eye.
 
Aki: Kagajou-san.
 
Suz: Just kidding! I don't actually think you would kill a fellow man in cold blood or anything! 
 
Aki: ...A fellow man? Now that's just weird. I'm a woman.
 
Suz: ...That's your problem?
 
Yum: So, miss, what have you been doing tonight and where?
 
Aki: Alibi inquiry, huh. I'm afraid I have no alibi to prove that I was in my room... Hmm. That reminds me, there's a certain legend told here in the Gold Tower.
 
Suz: Why is she suddenly talking about legends?
 
Yum: Suzume-san, this flow of events is a given.
 
Aki: This tower is called Senkeiden in the Taisha.　Sen as in "a thousand", kei from "view" and den from "palace". Thus, Senkeiden - Palace of Thousand Views. The Uesato family directly named it so.
 
Yum: This is my first time hearing of this.
 
Aki: But the name "Senkeiden"... Is actually rumoured to have something to do with a girl who met an untimely end...
 
Yum: Could it be...　That the girl's grudge...
 
Aki: It's just a legend... Nothing more than a story.
 
Suz: I-I'm scared, Miroku-san! Is it a ghost!? A ghost!?
 
Yum: W-Whether it is a ghost or not is something we must find out starting now!
 
Aya: T-There's trouble!
 
Yum: What is it, Kokudo-san?
 
Aya: Shizuku-senpai suddenly left the Gold Tower and said she's going to the training grounds!
 
Yum: I see... So that was it. This mystery... is solved!
 
SHI: Jeez. Shizuku can be a pain in the ass too...
 
Suz: That's as far as you go, SHIZUKU!
 
SHI: Huh!? Why are you all here?
 
Yum: Mebuki-san's murdererer is you, SHIZUKU-san, is it not?
 
Aya: Miroku-senpai, she's alive.
 
SHI: I'm the culprit? And why is that?
 
Yum: Your personality change. After Mebuki-san got attacked, Shizuku and you traded places for some reason.
 
SHI: And what's that supposed to prove?
 
Yum: Allow me to explain: Mebuki-san proposed you to have a match, with your attitude on the line. However, you lost to her, and the grudge finally drove you to murder!
 
Aya: She's not dead.
 
Yum: And once you learned that I, Miroku Yumiko, was on the case, you quickly fled here, afraid that your crime would be discovered.
 
SHI: Hold on-!
 
Yum: Now that I remember, you kept suggesting all those events were just people's imagination. All that was to mislead the investigation-
 
Meb: That's not it, Miroku-san.
 
Yum: Eh? Mebuki-san, why are you here?
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai! You woke up!
 
Meb: Yeah. And the culprit behind these events... is this.
 
Cat: Meow.
 
Suz: Uh... What's this creature?
 
SHI: Haah... What's this look like to you, a dog? It's a cat, a cat.
 
Cat: Meow.
 
Suz: Oh, it just made a cat-like sound.
 
SHI: That's 'cause it's a goddamn cat! Okay, fine! I'll explain. So, basically...
 
SHI: ...And that's the gist of it.
 
Yum: Uh, so to reiterate... The cat you picked up and secretly kept would sometimes escape and cause a mess in the Sentinels' rooms?
 
Meb: The will'o'the'wisp glowing in the darkness must've been its eyes reflecting light. The girl that got injured must've accidentally startled it and got scratched as a result.
 
Yum: And the reason you were passed out?
 
Meb: Ugh... That's because I got exhausted from today's training and spent too much time in the bath...
 
Aya: We were worried! Please don't overdo it.
 
Meb: I'll be more careful from now on. Sorry for worrying you.
 
Yum: ...T-then the reason you swapped personalities?
 
SHI: Shizuku was trying to catch this mischievous kitten and scold it, but it scratched her. So I got brought out.
 
Suz: Miroku-san... "The mystery is solved!" was it? 
 
Yum: O-O-O-O-O-Of course I knew all along! I was merely testing you all!
 
Suz: Ew, that's the lamest kind of excuse.
 
Cat: Meow.
 
Meb: So, what are we going to do with it, SHIZUKU?
 
SHI: Shizuku's been keeping it in secret because she wasn't sure if she'd get a permission to, but now that it's caused such a mess we can't really keep it hidden anymore.
 
Aya: What if they tell us to throw it out? I feel bad for the kitty...
 
Meb: Haah... I'll ask for a permission to keep it as well.
 
Suz: Mebu, you really are kind, after all.
 
Yum: She is a tsundere, after all. That is one of the points she shares with Miyoshi-san.
 
Meb: N-No I'm not!
