Qi Cultivation: Water Organ Cultivation
This man has only two internal organs; the Water Yang organ, and the Water Yin organ. These are what he uses to perform the alchemy within himself.
Traveling: Flowing Wave Crossing
A wave of water appears under the man, and he uses it to travel.
Profession (Bodily Seal): Seals of the Wake
Normally, the Bodily Seals of his Sect could not be easily perfomed on the user, merely others. This changed with the user's unique physiology, who writes the seals on his own kidney. Although mainly used for healing, the seals can have other uses. Something in his mind was unlocked, as well, after his exposure to the scripture he studied. In exchange for part of him, his knowledge of seals grew.
>Scripture Techniques
Barrage: Waves Eroding Stone
Vibrating the water within his body, the user strikes the opponent multiple time. This can cause both internal and external damage. Focused on efficiency.
Reversal: Raindrops in the Sea
A unique reversal technique. Instead of reflecting the attack against the opponent, the user reverses the technique into himself, gaining back the energy wasted. A technique designed for defense, and stalling the opponent, to wear them out. He always uses this technique when applicable due to the cost being the amount of energy the opponent uses, which he hopes to match.
Movement: Waterlogged Bones
The users bones contain, and are filled with, water. He can achieve incredible speed with his fluid filled skeleton; similar to a cockroach's ability to go at full speed from standing. This also increases the speed at which the user can move.
Other: Body of the Waves
Contrary to his name, this man actually does have bones. However, his body is unique. He can liquify his skeleton and other internal organs, in order to avoid the brunt of serious attacks and fit into small places or through cracks.
>Martial Arts Techniques
Profession (Brewing): Tea Mastery
A technique and style he came up with himself, after he lost most of his body in exchange for secrets. By steeping herbs into his own body, this man turns himself into a form of tea. He uses this for healing, but he could also steep other herbs into himself in order to add effects to his body and techniques.
Endurance: Slippery Surface
Weaker attacks seem to slip off of him like water.
Support Cultivation x3: Inner Ocean
This man has three dimension-like oceans within him. As he fights, he can break the seals on them to aid in his battle, as if he was going into another "phase." They also aid in his cultivation.
>Bio
This man does not exist. As much as his enemies may like to think otherwise, according to the greatest detection techniques known to anyone, he does not exist. On top of a mountain, there is a humble sect that provides medical services to all. With a special technique that involved carving seals onto others, qi would be restored and the body healed. This sect is known to many, and they welcome all who wish to learn or require attention. They provide their service to all who require it. There was once a man of great strength who served as a doctor. He required great strength; his job was to carve seals on those with the toughest skin, who could not have seals carved onto them otherwise. This man was a hulking mass of muscle; you would be surprised to see how delicate he was with his hands. He commanded some respect around his sect, and he had many friends and apprentices. One day, a patient came to the sect with incredibly hard skin. Not even the strong doctor could pierce it. The skin was not natural; he was a young apprentice of the sect who wondered into a mysterious cave, and was afflicted with his disease. The strong doctor realized what he had to do, and he set out to the cave himself, to find a cure. Hours after he left, the young apprentice fell to his illness. Days later, the doctor returned, but no one recognized him. He had lost all of his muscle mass; he was merely skin and bones. He told them all what had happened: he had discovered the cause of the young apprentice's illness, a scroll deep within the earth. After reading it, he destroyed it, and its knowledge was only contained in his mind. Although heartbroken to hear that the young apprentice had died, the doctor told all of his friends and apprentices that he had a new mission. Although he did not disclose this mission to them, he made them take a vow. They were never allowed to mention his name again, in order to protect themselves. With those few words, he vanished, off to travel the world. Eventually, strange men appeared at the sect and asked about a doctor who used to work there. The others merely kept quiet. The doctor who had forgotten his name travels the world, searching for mysterious artifacts. If you were to ask him what he was doing, he would merely say "I'm doing the world a favor." On his travels, he always makes sure to try and help someone in need, and is always free to lend a helping hand. He also has a sense of humor, and loves bone puns.
