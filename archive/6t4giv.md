####Chapter 1
As the morning winds of October 31st touched Kyoto, Japan. The kids of Shiketsu High School were busy making plans for Halloween, which had only grown in popularity with Japan’s youths over the years. 

“So what do you think? Tada! I’m the Pumpkin Prince,” Inigo grinned next to the plastic pumpkin head he carried. “Even got the orange tie to match.” His construct, Gigan, floated alongside him as a ghoulish green cat.

“I thought you were going as a samurai,” Christopher said as the two walked to school. Sally lagged behind them, on a phone call with her boyfriend, Noah, as they coordinated their costumes. Upon hearing that UA was allowing school costumes on Halloween day, Principal Karaburan had done the same for Shiketsu. It was a welcomed surprise.

“Nah. That’s only if Hoge matched with me.  What’re you supposed to be?” He watched his dark-haired best friend struggle with his cravat and deerstalker hat, which would’ve made him look sophisticated if not for the two winter coats he was wearing. It made him look like a cotton ball as he penguin-walked along.

“Take a guess.”
“You’re a royal potato-head.”

“Tut-tut. It’s elementary, my dear.” Christopher blew into an old smoking pipe and bubbles flew out of it.

“Some sort of tumbleweed magician?”
“I’m Sherlock Holmes. The famous detective! Faith's going as Watson.”
“Huh? That was my next guess.”

"It'll look better when I get to school and take off these coats."
Inigo whistled, "I'm cold too man, but sometimes you gotta suffer for beauty. We can't be scaring away all the ladies."

"Uh Uh. We already have girlfriends."

"Nah, I mean for the other guys! Shinkan, Sora, and Hiro are still single! On a night like tonight.. such loneliness can drive a man toward **murder.**"

"What dumb thing is he saying now?" Sally asked as she rejoined them, putting her phone away.

"See! Sally gets it!" Inigo pointed out. "She's a sexy robot maid for Halloween!"

"I'm Joan of Arc!"

"So that's what you are. I thought you were some kind of golem," Christopher blew on his pipe again.

"S-shut up! Puffball and Squashhead!" 

"Hey, I'm the Pumpkin Prince!"

"Whatever. Why are you holding on to that headband?" 

"Oh, this! I dunno exactly why I brought it." Inigo stared as he held a green headband with bobbling alien eyes. "I think it'll look good on Kaylee though. She must miss her planet."

"I think she's from England, isn't she?" Sally asked.

"Indubitably," Christopher added.

"Planet England?" Inigo pondered.

And so, Sherlock Holmes, Joan of Arc, and the Pumpkin Prince warmed the chilly Halloween morning with conversation, as they chatted and joked their way towards Shiketsu, ready to embrace the spooktacular day ahead.

As the clock's hands inched closer to noon, the students of Shiketsu High School gathered in the classroom for their Halloween lunch break.  In one corner, they had transformed their lunchtime into something much spookier. The students of 1-D huddled together, their costumes a stark contrast to their usual everyday school uniforms. The window shades were down and the room was completely dark, except a flickering candle, casting eerie shadows on the classroom walls. An aura of suspense hung in the air, as they shared scary tales.

Hailey, dressed up as a cat to match Hifumi's rabbit costume, leaned forward, her face bathed in the eerie candlelight. She concluded the story and whispered, "And then when she got home, she flipped the tag on the dress and saw it was marked as 90% off. She had been shopping at the bargain bin... the entire time." Her words sent a shiver down the other Koreans' spines. Faith hugged her as they shivered together.

Bobby, wearing an unmasked gorilla costume, raised a brow, "I don't get it."

Inigo shuddered. "Nah, bro. That was actually terrifying." He hugged his genuine Italian-made suit jacket close.

"Okay, who's next?" Hifumi asked, looking around the room and holding out the single candle lighting the room.

"I have one." Half the room jumped as Hoge materialized to take the flickering candlestick. She had not dressed up, but her quirk made her scary in the dark. 

"This happened about four years ago... Being a tutor really can be scary."

#####The Doll
Hoge needed money. As a second-year middle school student living alone, her allowance from home was paltry. She got permission to distribute flyers around the neighborhood advertising tutoring services. The flyer stated she could teach university-level English and Japanese for 3000 yen an hour, and included her contact details. A few days later, she received a call from a middle-aged-sounding woman.

"I saw your flyer. Would you be able to come over?" the woman asked.

When asked for details, the woman said she needed a tutor for her son. She wanted four-hour sessions every day.

Hoge was shocked. That was 12,000 yen per day! She knew it was odd to request so many hours, but the money overrode her caution. The woman wanted her to start the very next day. After eating an early dinner, Hoge set out for the address in the evening around 5 p.m.

 Hoge arrived at the address given over the phone at 5:04 pm. The sun was low in the late summer sky, not yet set but dimmed behind clouds. This far from the city center, only one streetlight lit the narrow road. The house was old, paint peeling, with a neglected yard overgrown by weeds.

*Single story. Concrete block structure. Built circa 1950s. One door, one curtained window visible.* Hoge noted. The wind carried a scent of mildew. It exuded neglect. Hoge's stride slowed. Her quirk, Wasuremono, made her difficult to notice at the best of times. Currently, her wariness spiked it higher, obscuring her outline. It made first impressions difficult. She needed to calm down. *Atmospheric pressure nine-hundred-ninety-eight hectopascals, humidity seventy-eight percent.* She recalled the day's weather broadcast.

At the door, she pressed the worn, tarnished button. A loud buzz rang out.

Moments later, the door creaked open. The woman's head emerged, grinning widely. "You came! Wonderful, wonderful." Her hair was lank and dull, her skin sagging. And her milky white eyes - they gazed straight at Hoge despite her quirk. Was she blind? A mutant? The woman's stare pierced through her. 

"Yes, thank you for hiring me," Hoge replied, polite but uneasy. 

"Please, come in, come in." The woman held the door wide. Reluctantly, Hoge stepped over the threshold into a dark, stale interior. The woman closed the door behind them with a thud. "This way dear, follow me. My son is so very excited to meet you." The woman shuffled down the hall, gesturing for Hoge to follow. Heart pounding, Hoge complied. 

The hall led to a shut door covered in childish stickers. "Come in, come in. Ken-kun is waiting."

Hoge entered what appeared to be a child's bedroom. However, thick dust layers revealed its disuse. A made twin bed. Desk and bookshelf crammed with toys. Decorative touches like picture frames and lamps shaped like animals. Hoge cataloged details rapidly.

At the desk sat a small figure drawing.
"Hello, you must be Ken-kun. I'm Hoge, your new tutor. Pleased to meet you."

No response. The figure stared straight ahead. Dread trickled down Hoge's neck. She moved closer. No motion. Up close, the illusion fell away. "This is...a doll," Hoge realized aloud.

"Huuuhhhhh?!?!?! What are you saying?!!! That's my son!!! Ken-kun!!!!" the woman suddenly screamed, then burst into tears. Hoge flinched.

"Y-you're right," Hoge said, hands raised placatingly. "I'm very pleased to meet you, Ken-kun. Let's start our first lesson, okay?" Analyzing the doll's features, Hoge surmised hand-crafted, not manufactured. Clothed in real children's garments. 

The woman's face relaxed into another wide grin. "Excellent, excellent. Teach him well, now! He's been so excited for this." She rested a bony hand on Hoge's shoulder with unsettling familiarity. "I'll just observe from over here. Please, start anytime."

Suppressing a shudder, Hoge sat before the doll. Its features were limited to mere stitches - two large eyes, a barely visible line for a mouth. It wore a blue shirt and shorts. Specks of black yarn hair topped its head. Hoge's skin crawled being so close.

Clearing her throat, Hoge began speaking aloud on basic grammar principles, as if tutoring an actual child. Of course, Ken-kun didn't respond. Hoge had no choice but to spend the next four hours conversing with the doll one-sidedly. Even ten-minute breaks were agonizing.

"The ‘be’ verb is here so it becomes this. This is the conjunctive form so it's 'u' okay." Hoge babbled on alone while the woman watched grinning creepily. The woman sat against the wall, grinning and nodding along.

***
Twenty minutes passed this way. Hoge's voice was steady, but her heart pounded.  Once the woman left them alone even briefly, she would seize any chance to flee this bizarre, frightening scenario.  She pointed to a vocabulary sheet and mimed the doll circling words, narrating its actions. Inside, her mind raced with theories about the delusional woman. Why pose a doll as her child? Why request a tutor? Did she once have a real son who left or died? Some sort of lingering trauma. If Hoge left would the woman leave her a bad review on the tutoring website? Too many unknown variables.

The woman showed no signs of leaving. The lesson dragged on. Hoge contemplated faking an illness.

Outside, the sun fully set and heavy rain started. Inside, the suspended dust and sense of things long unused weighed down the stale air. The doll remained vacantly unaffected. And the woman kept staring, smiling, as Hoge pretended to teach it.

Hoge glanced at her watch. 9:03 PM. Four hours of uneasy tutoring finished.  The woman still smiled vacantly. "All done for today? Ken-kun learned so much, I can tell."

"Yes, four hours goes quickly." A complete falsehood. Each minute crawled by. “It was a very productive first lesson. I'm sure with more practice, he'll make excellent progress." She stood, wincing as her stiff joints crackled.

"Won't you stay for dinner first?" The woman blocked Hoge's path to the door holding out the money Hoge earned, grinning eagerly. Behind the bizarre hospitality, Hoge sensed a dark undercurrent. Refusal could provoke this unstable person.

"That's very kind, but I wouldn't want to impose..." Hoge demurred as she took the bills and placed them inside the wallet she kept under her bait wallet. A crash of thunder rattled the walls, making them both jump.

"Oh dear, listen to that storm! Please, you simply must stay for dinner. I won't take no for an answer!" The woman grasped Hoge's wrist with startling strength.

Hoge assented. The woman led her to a dingy, neglected kitchen. Hoge cataloged details rapidly for future reference. Gas stove, refrigerator, chipped countertops. A cockroach skittered into a crack.

Taking out a knife and pot, the woman set to preparing curry. When the knife flashed under the fluorescent lights, Hoge's adrenaline spiked. She tracked the blade warily.

Soon, curry bubbled. The woman scooped it onto cracked porcelain dishes. "Eat up! You're skin and bones."

The curry was...not inedible. Hoge forced enthusiastic compliments through a tense jaw. Thunder boomed outside. "Oh my, it's gotten quite extreme out there," the woman fretted in exaggerated tones. "You simply must stay the night, I won't hear any arguments."

Hoge paled. Overnight with this unhinged stranger? Abduction or worse seemed imminent. "T-truly, that isn't necessary, I can call a car..." she tried weakly.

"Nonsense! It would be irresponsible of me to turn you out in this dangerous weather," the woman insisted with manic good cheer. "Ken-kun would be thrilled for you to stay. Come, let's get you settled in his room."

Hoge allowed herself to be shepherded back to the bedroom. Futon laid out, pajamas provided. The woman leaned down, rancid breath washing over Hoge as she whispered, "You'll keep Ken-kun company tonight...won't that be fun?"

Suppressing revulsion, Hoge nodded jerkily. The woman left her alone with the doll.

Hoge sat rigidly. Adrenaline flooded her veins, heightening her quirk. Not that it impacted the woman's sight. Hours passed tensely. The woman did not return. Hoge remained wide awake, listening to the storm and pondering her next move. When lightning illuminated the room. The doll sat motionless.

Near midnight, Hoge could no longer stand it. Donning her shoes, she eased open the door and crept into the dark hallway. Silence rang out. It appeared the woman had gone to bed.

Hoge snuck toward where she believed the front door lay. Thunder shook the floorboards. She froze, heart in her throat. No noises stirred. She continued on. The door materialized from the gloom. Nearly there! Hoge reached for the knob, so focused on her target that she failed to look back. A hand clamped down on her shoulder.

The woman stood grinning behind the dining room door, having watched Hoge the whole time. "You weren't trying to go home now, were you?" she asked with that chilling grin.

"I umm.." Hoge stammered. Before she could react, the woman grabbed her arms, fingernails digging in. Hoge cried out.

"We have so much to do! I've laid out books and toys. Oh, Ken-kun will be thrilled!" The woman shook with excitement. "You can't leave yet, that would be rude!"

Panic overwhelmed Hoge. ""Uwaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" With a strangled scream, she twisted away and fled blindly up the dark staircase of the house, nearly hyperventilating. A bedroom! Any window! She had to get out!

Behind her, the woman's ghastly giggles faded. Ahead, potential escape beckoned. Hoge kept running, heedless of what she might find.

**"Dotadotadotadota!!"**

She saw a door in front of her. She opened it. It was pitch black. She looked for the light switch and turned the lights on. Everything in the room lit up.

The room was full of nothing but stuffed toys and dolls. She was brought to a standstill as something moved within the pile of dolls.

**"Kyakyakyakyakyakya!!!"**

A figure with a huge head and bulging eyes met Hoge's gaze. 

"Ken-kun?"

**"Hyahyahyahyahya!!!!"** it shrieked.

Hoge nearly wet herself and leapt out the second story window in sheer panic. She was so scared she didn't feel the pain. Running all the way home, she discovered the next day that she'd broken her left ankle.

-> ![She could almost swear she saw some of them move and tried to ask for help.](https://i.imgur.com/xFL93hx.jpg) <-

Hoge never returned, too disturbed by what she'd experienced. She still wonders what that thing was in the upstairs room.

As Hoge concluded her tale of terrifying dolls with a deep, ominous voice, the classroom fell silent, and the flickering candlelight danced eerily across the faces of his friends. Goosebumps erupted on their arms, and their wide eyes were filled with a mixture of fear and fascination. Sally clutched her chest dramatically, pretending to be bored, while Orochi, dressed up as a magician, widened her eyes and whispered, "That's some creepy stuff, Nyoro-chan."

"Hoge-chan! You could've been killed!" Inigo rushed to hug Hoge's head to his chest. "Are you safe now? I'll protect you!"

"I am safe and healthy. There's no need to do so." She blinked from the contact but kept her posture.

"So was it a real story?" Christopher asked as he held a spooked Faith's hand.

A faint smile spread across Hoge's face as she merely shrugged.

"Ooh! I got a real one." Inigo said as he took the candle and sat himself next to Hoge.

#####The Green
It was mid-October. Hoge smiled to herself as she glanced around the classroom. For once, everything seemed perfectly in order. Her classmates were all quietly focused on their schoolwork, including Inigo in the back row. He appeared totally engrossed in his textbook, not even noticing as she walked by.

Feeling a sense of peace, Hoge decided now would be an ideal time to step out and fetch Rosethorn for the remedial worksheet session they had planned. She slipped out the door, leaving her classmates diligently studying.

As soon as Hoge left, the five Korean girls near the center of the room turned to each other and began gossiping.

"Did you guys notice anything weird about Inigo today?" Minnie asked, lowering her voice conspiratorially. Maxine glanced over at Inigo, who was hunched over his desk studiously taking notes, though his construct Gigan was missing from his shoulder.

"He is acting strange," Maxine shrugged.
"I don't know..." Minerva murmured. "His eyes look kind of...glowy."

The girls peered closely at Inigo. His eyes did seem to have an odd fluorescent green shimmer to them.

"You're right, that's not normal," Minnie gasped. "Do you think...he replaced himself with his construct again to get out of class?"

"Would he really do that?" 

"I wouldn't put it past him," Hailey replied.

Their chatter was interrupted by Orochi skipping over. "What're you guys blabbing about over here?"

"Shh, quiet!" Max hissed. "We think Inigo replaced himself with his construct Gigan to ditch class."

Orochi's eyes widened. "No way, really? Let me check!" She popped back up and bounced over to Inigo's desk to investigate. 

The Korean clique watched Orochi converse with the strange-eyed Inigo. After a moment, she spun around, and to their shock, her eyes were glowing that same eerie green, even her hydra-heads glared with the same color.

"She's infected!" Minnie shrieked, tugging insistently on her boyfriend Bobby's arm. Bobby had been chatting with his bro Hifumi, but turned to Minnie in concern.

"Whoa, what's wrong babe?"

"Inigo replaced himself with his weird construct and it did something to Orochi too! Look at her eyes!" Minnie whispered urgently as Orochi sat down on her desk and assumed the same straight polite posture as Inigo.

Bobby glanced over and laughed. "Babe, I'm sure there's a reason-" Bobby sighed and headed over to Inigo's desk where Orochi was still hovering. After a brief interaction, Bobby also turned around, his eyes glowing bright green.

"Oh no, Bobby!" Minnie cried out.

Beside her, Hifumi was looking anxious. "Hey Hai, I don't like this at all. We should back up."

Hailey just snorted derisively at Hifumi's fear. But across the room, Ashleigh and Faith were looking freaked out.

"Guys, this is really scary! We need to barricade ourselves!" Faith exclaimed.

Chihiro shrugged and stood up as she followed everyone else.

The rest of the class began murmuring nervously as more of them noticed their classmates' glowing eyes. Thunder rumbled ominously outside.

"This is bad, I heard of this, it's a quirk virus," Christopher deduced. "We have to keep them in the classroom until help arrives. If I copy Inigo's quirk, I can stop it."

"Be careful!" Yui warned as Christopher cautiously approached Inigo. But a moment later, Christopher also collapsed to the floor. Faith shrieked in fright.

"I think- I'm o-okay." Christopher said to Faith as she helped him stand up, only for his face to become expressionless and his eyes glowed green.

"We're taking action," Imai declared. He strode over to the infected students and attempted to read their minds, only to sway and crumple to the ground himself. When he stood up, his eyes were glowing too.

"They got Imai and Chris!" Hiro yelped. Imai and Christopher moved to join Orochi, Inigo, and Bobby. All five stared at the class with green eyes. "Quick, barricade!"

The uninfected students scrambled to shove desks and chairs up against their corner forming a makeshift barrier, as their glowing-eyed classmates slowly advanced. Sally stood ready to blast them back with her quirk if needed. Lightning cracked threateningly outside.

"Don't hurt them, they're still our friends." Noah cautioned.

Once the barricade was made, the uninfected huddled together in fear. A crash from inside the barricade made them jump. Sandatsu suddenly let out a vicious snarl and pounced on Hifumi, sinking his teeth into the boy's arm. Blood spurted everywhere. Hifumi let out a blood-curdling scream as a green-eyed Sandatsu bit down, blood dripping from his mouth as he infected Hifumi. Both boys now stood with glowing green eyes.

Ominous thunder rumbled outside the windows as chaos erupted.  Students began screaming and scrambling away as their possessed classmates attacked. Quirks flew and loud yells filled the room. It was like a scene from a nightmare.

Chaos erupted as all the glowing-eyed students swarmed the barricade. Thunder boomed, lightning flashed, and screams pierced the air.

Before it can get too out of control, the infected students suddenly burst out laughing, the eerie glow leaving their eyes. It had all been a big prank. "Gotcha!" Inigo cackled. Beside him, the masterminds - Christopher, Sandatsu, Imai, Hifumi, Bobby, and Orochi - were nearly crying with laughter at the successful scare.

Just then, the classroom door banged open. Hoge rushed in, Rosethorn behind her, and surveyed the scene with shock.

"What is going on here?!" Rosethorn demanded. 

"Uh- class-wide hero practice?" Inigo said. The rest of the class pointed at Inigo and his conspirators. 

Rosethorn's eye twitched. "All of you...detention!" 

***

Inigo animatedly recounted the spooky prank he and his friends had pulled a few days ago. As he finished the story, he high-fived Bobby, Hifumi, and Sandatsu. However, the rest of the class collectively groaned in unison, their faces bearing expressions of exasperation. 

"Inigo, we remember that prank, and we were all there," Sora grumbled.

"I know! But it was funny right?"

Christopher picked up the flickering candle. "We have time for one more story before lunch ends."

Sally frowned. "Back home we had stories about the Wendigo. They would disguise themselves to bait kids into the woods, then chase them through the woods and eat them."

Christopher held out the candle for her to take.

"No, thanks." She shuddered. "I don't want to talk about them. It's bad vibes." Noah patted her shoulder comfortingly.

Bobby chuckled as he stood up from the back of the room and moved to circle around. "Talking about stories from home. I got a good one for ya'll. Ever heard of candlejack? He's a trickster who goes arou-"

Silence.

Imai in his genie costume raised a brow. "What happened to Bobby?"

"Maybe he got hungry." Kaylee, in her alien costume as she sat at her desk, unamused by the scary stories.

Hifumi shrugged and grabbed the candle. "Okay! My turn then-"

#####The Bloody Ceilings
Some of you already know about the shrines. Last week, my sisters and I visited the old temples there. So here's the story: Back in the late 1500s there was this warlord named Hideyoshi who ruled all of Japan. He built himself a huge castle in Kyoto called Fushimi Castle. But then when he died, there was a power struggle over who would take his place.

Hideyoshi's main rival was this other warlord named Tokugawa. Tokugawa left a whole army led by his best samurai, Torii Mototada, to defend Fushimi Castle while he went off to fight somewhere else.

Mototada only had 2,000 soldiers versus an attacking force of 40,000! He knew it was hopeless but he was completely loyal to Tokugawa. So he decided his men would fight to the bitter end to delay the enemy as long as possible. For eleven days Mototada and his men held off over twenty times their number! But finally, their ammunition ran out and there were only ten samurai left. With no chance of winning, they decided to commit seppuku - ritual suicide by disembowelment.

They solemnly knelt on the wooden floor of the castle, said their prayers, and then rammed their swords into their bellies, slicing them open. The blood just poured out of them as they died. By the time Tokugawa came back victorious, Mototada and his men were long dead. Left hanging there, their blood had seeped deeply into the floorboards. No matter how much servants scrubbed and cleaned, the blood stains would not come out.

When the castle was dismantled. The floorboards were sent to five different temples in Kyoto and used for the ceilings. That way the memory of their noble sacrifice would be preserved. Hosen-in is one of several chitenjo (blood ceiling) temples found in Kyoto, along with Yogen-in, Shoden-ji, Genko-an, and Kosho-ji among a few others.

You can visit the shrines, and see those ceilings with your own eyes. In one of them, you can still see handprint and footprint shapes where the dying samurai tried to get up after stabbing themselves.

 In a way it's like those samurai are still up there reaching down trying to tell the visitors how bravely they fought. You can picture their mangled bodies and the blood dripping down. Like staring death right in the face.

They say that after seeing the Bloody Ceilings, even just a picture. You start having vivid nightmares every night about being one of those samurai killing himself and feeling the sword slice open your stomach. SO vivid you could even feel the pain and the blood rapidly leaving your body. You wake up screaming in a cold sweat.

***

As the chilling tale of the Bloody Ceilings reached its conclusion, the classroom of kids sat in silence, some faces were pale and others like Inigo and Bobby were busy looking at the pictures in Hifumi's phone. 

Just as the story's lingering dread seemed to settle in, the lights flickered on, and Rosethorn entered the room. The sudden illumination and the presence of their homeroom teacher provided a much-needed, if somewhat eerie, sense of normalcy, dispelling the lingering unease caused by the chilling tale.

"Take your seats, please. Everyone. I know you're all excited for Halloween tonight, but since most of you have your license I need volunteers to assist with hero patrols. Any takers?" 

Several hands shot up from the class.

###Chapter 3
-> ![It's more fun to party between patrol breaks!](https://img.freepik.com/photos-premium/citrouilles-halloween-dans-piece-sombre-pleine-lune-derriere-elles_337384-9658.jpg) <-
Inigo gave a thumbs-up signal to Junichi on the ground,  the dark-haired boy wearing a vampire costume nodded and turned on the lights. The whole park came to life as the jack-o-lanterns lit up and the fog machine activated. Music blared out of the speakers they put up. Hoge gave him a nod of approval and Inigo flew down to discuss their plans.

The party takes place in an empty picnic area located next to the cemetery near the Nishikyo Ward. Tall, bare trees line the edges of the lot, their branches casting eerie shadows in the moonlight. A dirt path winds through the grassy field to the various activity stations they set up, including a photo booth nestled between crooked plastic headstones. Jack-o-lanterns and paper bats dangle from the trees, rustling in the autumn breeze. Fog drifts over the ground, swirling around guests' feet as they make their way between games. The cemetery provides a delightfully spooky backdrop for the Halloween party.

Inigo looked up at Junichi as he manned the DJ booth and played a Halloween mix. 
"Thanks for stopping by."
"Not like I had anything better to do."
"Sweet dracula costume bro. Did you pick that cuz Max is a sexy demon?"
"No..."
"They kinda match!"
"No, they don't and if she shows up I'm leaving." He lit up a cigarette and stared broodily towards the distance.
"Nah, you're staying to enjoy the sights!" Inigo winked. Junichi shot him a glare.

As guests started arriving, Inigo took to the mic. "Alright, everyone! Happy Halloween! I know some of us are in patrol duty, but I think tonight is a great excuse to have some spooky fun! People can go in and out as your patrols end! That's why we've put together this party!" 

He gestured grandly to the decorations. "We weren't sure if you all had costumes, so we brought a bunch of extras just in case!" Inigo added, pointing to a rack filled with various costumes and accessories. He himself was dressed up in his pumpkin prince outfit, complete with a cape, and pumpkin scepter. Hoge stood stiffly next to him, wearing her hero costume with a witch hat on top of her helmet.

His classmates murmured excitedly as they started looking through the costumes. Sandatsu, Kaylee, Shinkan, and Chihiro had been the first to arrive. Sandy looked at the bright colors before settling on a bloody hockey mask. Kaylee picked up an alien headband, much to Inigo's amusement. Shinkan wearing a cap with helicopter propellers challenged her to an arm-wrestling contest over one of the barrels. Chihiro shyly picked out a fox-ear headband to match her hero name before joining Hoge in preparing drinks.

"Yo Chris!" Inigo yelled as he spotted the teenage Sherlock Holmes walk by. "How's your patrol? Any sign of the Halloween thieves?"
"No. Just some drunks and one weirdo. There was a villain with a Fang quirk using it on civilians." 
"He was biting people?"
"No.. He was putting fangs on girls with his quirk. He got spotted a few times, so we handed the information to the next patrol group."
"Hmmmm..." Inigo paused, rubbing his chin.
"Think you know where he is?"
"I need to find a way to get Hoge to him. Can you imagine?"
"She'll kill you."
"Some things are worth dying for, bro."

Sally and Noah followed after Christopher, and Inigo watched as Sally led a blindfolded Noah into touching the bowls of "brains" and "slimy eyeballs."

The Korean clique arrived next, stopping by with Bobby and Hifumi. Minnie was in a banana costume. Inigo whispered a joke about Bobby peeling her that made the American boy blush. Faith had donned a sexy angel costume that didn't match Christopher's costume, but the younger boy didn't seem to mind one bit as they made their way to one corner of the party. Edith in her skeleton costume barely looked up as Inigo greeted them. 

Yui, Orochi, and Ashleigh stopped. Yui wore a mummy costume alongside Ashleigh's cowgirl costume. Orochi had brought with her a box of expensive sweets which they happily passed around.

Imai, Jugo, Hiro, and Sora popped in last after having tangled with a drunken werewolf mutant on their patrol. Imai, in his matching cowboy costume, soon joined Ashleigh on the dance floor as Jugo and Sora went to pick their costumes.

As everyone arrived, they started with typical party games like bobbing for apples. Hifumi succeeded in securing all the apples on his run except one until an exasperated Hailey gently lifted it from the water for him. Yui and Orochi worked together perfectly to demolish everyone else at the three-legged race. For the donut eating contest, Jugo ended up accidentally eating the string too, but still managed second place to Kaylee.

After the games, the group split up to explore the different activity stations Hoge and Inigo had set up. Christopher, Bobby, and the other athletic guys headed straight for the strongman game, seeing who could ring a ringing moon by swinging a bone-like sledgehammer down on a platform. Yui and the craft-minded students tried their hand at pumpkin carving. Chihiro was roped by some of the others into doing fortune-telling for them.

Music blasted across the park, as the couples of class 1-D danced together in the night. Inigo leaned his head against Hoge and nodded towards Max who lingered next to the DJing Junichi to yell at him for his terrible music taste. 

"Told ya they'd find their way to each other." Inigo grinned wide.

"Alright, who wants more candy?" Hiro called out when the music stopped, placing several buckets of candy on a table next to stacks of pizza. "They're not drugged I promise."

"Boo!" Edie yelled next to a disappointed Maxine as other students swarmed the table.

After filling up on candy, most of them gathered around a fire pit to roast marshmallows and let those who didn't get a chance in the classroom, tell ghost stories. Noah recounted some creepy folk tales he learned on his missionary trips. The wind whistling through the bare tree branches and rustling the leaves added to the ominous atmosphere.

In a lull between stories, Orochi speaks up thoughtfully. "Hey Myoga, Nyoro, can I ask why you decided to host the party out here?"

Inigo grinned wickedly, sharing a look with Hoge. "I'm so glad you asked! Hoge and I actually have one last Halloween surprise for everyone!"

Inigo flew up and yelled for people's attention and pointed at their class representative. Hoge nods the bells on her witch's hat jingling. "We have uncovered some suspicious activity occurring in our patrol areas on Halloween night. Follow us and we will show you."

With confused excitement, the classmates made their way towards the cemetery gates. Hoge gestures for everyone to keep quiet and low as they sneak amongst the headstones, the full moon overhead providing an eerie light.

In the distance, Inigo hears voices and sees flashlight beams dancing around. They duck behind the larger monuments as we creep closer. Finally, we spot our targets near a mausoleum on the edge of the cemetery.

"There they are," Hoge called out in a dramatic whisper, pointing out the group of shadowy figures hauling large bags and boxes between them. They were led by a pair of horse mutants, one of whom had mangled legs. "The gang of thieves that's been committing robberies against tourists all month. We tracked their hideout here but we were waiting for them to all show up together."

"Looks like they showed up for the meeting. Let's give 'em a little scare?" Inigo adds with a grin. "Operation Trick-or-Treat!"

The class leaped out of hiding, yelling and letting loose with their quirks. The costumed students were intimidating, charging out of the darkness. The gang of robbers shrieked in surprise, the two horse mutants reared up and ordered a counterattack. But the students were ready.

###Chapter 4:
The six villains stalked through the graveyard, using the cover of night and fog to slip away unnoticed from the Shiketsu students. Now they moved as one, ragged but determined, searching for an opportunity to regroup.

Big Stallion flashed with rage beneath his hood as he recalled the sword-wielding girl who took down his brother. His fists clenched and unclenched, itching to wrap around the throats of the heroes who had ruined their plans.

"This way," Razer rasped, leading the group towards a narrow alley. His flames had been exhausted in the fight, but his mind still burned with dark purpose.

As they slunk into the shadows, a young drunken couple stumbled into view, giggling and clinging to each other. Razer's dry lips split into a grin beneath his mask. Easy prey to vent his frustration on. He raised a hand, ready to burn them both if they didn't surrender.

A glowing katana materialized in the air before them, stopping the villains short. They traced its glare back to a small figure in a dark hoodie standing at the alley's entrance.

"Fun's over, creeps,"  Noctiluca declared. More glowing weapons formed around her, an array of hammers, swords, and spears.

The villains tensed, ready to fight, when a gust of wind buffeted them from above. Seiryu landed beside Noctiluca, wings spread menacingly.

"Need a hand?" the dragon hero asked.

"Oh it's you again," Noctiluca blinked. Together, they advanced on the villains. During their battle, a war cry pierced the night as a figure in an egg costume barreled into the alley, nearly bowling Noctiluca over.

"I have arrived!" announced Popsy. She turned to wave at the startled couple. "Fear not, citizens! We'll *hic hic* protect you!"

The egg wobbled dangerously as she tried to strike a pose. Seiryu facepalmed while Noctiluca stifled a giggle.

Behind her, a tall figure stepped forward, black braided hair flowing. Smokin' Sexy, in a pirate costume, drew his sword, black smoke swirling around him. The blade glinted wetly in the moonlight.

"What a bother," he muttered. "On our day off too."

The villains exchanged uneasy glances, sensing the tide had turned. With nowhere left to run, they were soon overwhelmed.

***
After restraining them from the police, the heroes gathered together. Seiryu studied Popsy's egg costume in bewilderment.

"Dare I ask?" Noctiluca started.

"It's my Halloween costume!" Popsy exclaimed. 

"We were on our way to the Kraftwerk Agency party. You guys should join us." Smokin' Sexy explained.

Noctiluca shrugged. "I've got no other plans tonight."

Seiryu nodded. "I'll come."

Smokin' Sexy sheathed his blade smoothly. "The more, the merrier. It's been a while, Seiryu."

"It'll be good to catch up, Ryusei."

"So...egg, huh?" Noctiluca said, eyeing Popsy's costume as they walked.

"Yup!" Popsy replied cheerfully. "I'm going for fun instead of sexy this year. What do you think?"

She wobbled her egg body around, nearly losing her balance. Seiryu put out a hand to steady her.

"It's very...egg-centric," she said diplomatically.

Noctiluca and Seiryu collectively groaned. Smokin' Sexy smirked and adjusted his eye patch.

"And what is your costume supposed to be?" Popsy asked the vigilante.

Noctiluca shrugged. "Same as always. Just my trusty hoodie. People think I'm a rabbit."

"Aww, no fun!" Popsy pouted. "You should have dressed up too."

"I don't really do costumes," Noctiluca mumbled. She hefted the large bag of candy she had been carrying. 

Seiryu eyed the bag curiously. "Did you collect all that yourself?"

"Yes. Got a pretty good haul this year," Noctiluca said defensively.

"With your short stature, you could easily pass for a child seeking candy," Seiryu pointed out his observation.

"A clever tactic," Ryusei added.

Noctiluca flushed. "Hey, I'm not that short! The costume just makes me look small. There's no law saying adults can't go treat-or-treating."

"Of course, my apologies," Seiryu said smoothly.

Eager to change the subject, Noctiluca turned to him. "What about you? No costume either?"

Seiryu shook his head. "Didn't have time. I just finished my patrol and then came to help you."

"Well aren't you two party poopers," Popsy huffed.

Smokin' Sexy rested a hand on the hilt of his sword. "I'm dressed as a drunk pirate."

Popsy tilted her egg to the side. "Yeah, I can't really tell the difference, to be honest. In any case, we don't want to be late to Impakt's party," she declared. 

Laughing together, the heroes headed off into the night.

***

The Halloween party was winding down as the class gathered up the leftover food and decorations. After the excitement of busting the cemetery thieves earlier, everyone was ready to keep celebrating somewhere else.

"Let's head over to the Kraftwerk Agency office!" Hifumi suggested, pumping his fist. "Impakt said we can all come. It's 80's themed!"

The class cheerfully agreed. 

Inigo and Hoge fell back as the others went on ahead.

"Some party, huh?" Inigo said, flashing a grin. "Pretty cool we finally got those guys. Nice leg work!"

Hoge nodded a slight smile on her face. "It went well. And I appreciate you organizing this, even if it was...unorthodox."

"Thanks Coru-chan!" Inigo patted her on the back. "I'll do anything for an excuse to party."

He looked around furtively before leaning in close. "Hey, I've got something to show you. Check this out!"

Inigo quickly shed his makeshift samurai costume to reveal his actual samurai outfit underneath. The bold red and black stood out even in the dim light.

"Ta-da! My real costume! Whaddya think?" He struck a dramatic pose.

Hoge's eyes widened in surprise. It took her a moment to respond. "It's quite striking. The colors and patterns are aesthetically pleasing."

Inigo grinned. "I figured I'd wear it under my costume. Y'know, just in case you wanted to match. Plus it feels badass, you know?"

Hoge hesitated, glancing around, and she stopped walking.

Inigo blinked. "Something wrong?" 

"I know you've got your ninja outfit under there! I wanna see my deadly assassin girlfriend in action!"

With a headshake, Hoge removed her Marumaru helmet and unbuckled her armor to reveal red and blue kunoichi garb. She slid the metal mouth cover into place and faced Inigo. Even without speaking, her body exuded grace and Inigo found himself stunned as he watched her silhouette against the full moon. 

"Please tell me that's your new Marumaru hero outfit and not just a Halloween costume."

Hoge tensed awkwardly and looked away. "O-of course it's a costume! Cosplay kunoichi is completely different conceptually from a modern ninja influenced by the trends of hero society. In fact, a costume like this has many historically fictional elements that make it just as fantastical as any other Halloween costume, such as a vampire or goblin. When we think of the word "ninja," our minds often conjure images of shadowy figures clad in black, skilled in stealth, espionage, and martial arts. But the truth is that the concept of a ninja has undergone a  transformation over time, blending history, myth, and pop culture into a cocktail.

"Whoa... yeah but-" Inigo breathed. He slowly circled her, eyes shining with admiration. "You look so freaking cool! Like you could kill me in a hundred different ways. This is the best!" Unable to contain himself, he swept her up in a big hug. 

He set her down and grabbed her hand eagerly. "Come on, let's go catch up to the others! But first, tell me while we're running along a fence wall and it looks like I'm chasing you with my sword!"

Hoge raised a brow. "What fence wall?"

"That fence wall!" Inigo's quirk shimmered and a tall green fence materialized next to them.

Hoge glanced between Inigo and the illusionary fence uncertainly. Then she nodded and sprinted forward, her feet barely making a sound.

Inigo whooped and chased after her, holding his sword high. "Just pretend I'm a deadly samurai hunting down a fugitive ninja! But you're too fast and nimble for me!"

As they raced down the length of the fence, Hoge spoke between breaths. "Very well. It will give me time to practice my running."

She effortlessly hurdled over trash cans and benches that appeared along their path, courtesy of Inigo's quirk. He continued to call out dramatic threats as he swung his sword haphazardly behind her.

"You can't escape me, vile ninja! I'll have your head for betraying the shogun!"

Hoge glanced back, the eyes of her mask glinting. "You are mistaken, samurai fool. I serve the people while you blindly follow orders."

"Lies! You are nothing but a heartless killer with no loyalty!" Inigo panted, struggling to keep up.

"If I am heartless, why does my heart race at the sight of you?" Hoge answered softly.

Inigo stumbled, caught off guard, he nearly fell off the fence if Gigan hadn't extended a dragon hand to catch him.

Hoge stopped and turned back, blushing red and tilting her head. "D- Did I say something wrong?"

"N-no, that was perfect," Inigo said, rubbing his neck sheepishly. 

He cleared his throat, trying to play it cool. Taking her hand, he stared at her for just a moment. Hoge nodded, squeezing his hand gently. 

"Let's go again! - I won't fall for your tricks, kunoichi witch!" He brandished his sword. Hoge ran.

Running together, the samurai and the kunoichi made their way toward the distant lights and music of the party. The night was young and they had all of Halloween ahead of them.
