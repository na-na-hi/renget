**Story**
Ruka felt the sting of memories unmade in her final year of school, having fallen back on wish fulfilment manga as her classmates carried on as if she didn't exist. 
 
Now presented with total control over her looks, she opted for an idealised version of herself, retaining her meek height, shunning aging, and clinging to the youthful human look she sculpted out, the other racial choices repulsing her. An eastern face stared back from the ethereal mirror, not far off from a popular classmate of hers, complete with pale porcelain skin, medium black bangs and hypnotic purple eyes. As she stood in that purgatory between worlds, she pondered her figure for what felt like hours, heart eventually racing as the fabric of her uniform stretches to accommodate her swelling hips and chest, her skirt resting atop the pillowy backside now swallowing her panties.
 
Each choice neglected practicality, but this was a light-hearted fantasy world, right? Worlds like these always operate on video game logic, so wouldn't being a petite girl with narrow shoulders and a round ass have no bearing on your combat abilities? She grew hungry and impatient as she scrolled through the seemingly endless choices, eventually deferring to the Arbiter to "Just give me some cool skills you think I'll like" with complete apathy spread across her face. 
 
As she shut her eyes to an endless void, words like "masochist" and "damsel" swam through her mind, a hint of uncertainty shooting up her spine as her HUD initialises noting that her charisma and sex stats are unusually high... wait, sex stat? She cursed at herself for daydreaming a little too much during the Arbiter's introduction, before opening her eyes to the sunny land of Haven at midday. Oh well, these isekai plots always have the same tropes, and as the protagonist, there's no way she wouldn't have plot armour!
 
 
**TL;DR**
Has a suspicious lack of family, friends, or even basic knowledge of Harahel. She claims to be from "the far east" and both speaks and dresses eccentrically, often raving on about just how important she is as the protagonist of this world. Ruka's now ill-fitting school uniform seems to have survived the trip between worlds, modern underwear, skirt, pantyhose and all.

With a soft, short body, no combat or magic skills, a maxed out sex stat, and traits that serve no purpose beyond aiding the pleasure of others, it seems Arc set her up with a build that's good for nothing but serving cocks, all as punishment for zoning out and asking to skip character creation. She doesn't age, doesn't need sleep, doesn't produce waste, has a womanhood sculpted by a deity, feels pleasure from pain, slowly regenerates, doesn't get her period, and is wet and ready no matter who or what comes knocking... an incredibly cruel fate at the hands of the Arbiter.
 
**Goals**
Experience life as the chosen one, and then figure out and take down whoever the stereotypical big bad guy is. 
Avoid prostitution or enslavement.
Kill Arc...
 
**Violence Comfort Level**
Being beaten to the point of bruising, bleeding and unconsciousness is okay, serious gore is not.
 
 
**Lewd**
Yes, this character is built for it, though she isn't fully aware of just how intense the traits Arc granted her are, nor how mind-blowing the sex will be.
 
 
**Kinks**
Males, both con and non-con, kidnapping and slavery, drugging, sexual exhaustion, degradation and humiliation, forced clothing, etc. 
Train my sex stat up to 6 or 7, maybe?
