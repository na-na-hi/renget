Only thread #19572319 (November 2018) so far.
I'm trying to keep stuff original and non-repetitive, so ideas about ayys and relationships and biology are fine, something focusing purely on benis in bass probably won't end up here.

\>tfw no ayy bug boi who happens to crash-land near my home
\>tfw can’t patch up ayy boi

What is it about ayys being eyeless that makes them so much cuter
I dunno man, they just seem like they’d be super expressive despite the lack peepers

I imagine eyeless aliens would focus much more on physical displays of affection. Rubbing their face against your like a cat, idly combing their fingers or talons through your hair, always staying nearby for your reassuring smell. Lots and lots of licks and kisses, they love the way you taste. So many little things to just, tie them more closely to you. But I'm a cuddleslut so that does color my desires

I was playing some Darkest Dungeon and I suddenly thought:
Would creatures of more... eldritch orgin count as ayys and would you fuck one?
...Assuming they don’t cause you immediate insanity from just looking at them

Yes and in a fucking heartbeat

I dunno, I’m half-and-half.
Like I’m sure they could be the best bfs you ever had even if you can’t tell what’s what between the tentacles and eyes.
I dunno, I just wanna see these wierdos more just because they’re interesting.
I just find the idea of a totally chill eldritch horror both cute and somewhat humorous. 

Agreed. I totally want to just hang with an Eldritch abomination, be friends and maybe do some sexual experimentation 

Now for the big question: What would an eldritch abomination’s dick look like 

Maybe those are his dicks and he's frotting you?

I want a Mind Flayer boyfriend, but instead of eating your brain, they like to embrace it as a means of sharing emotions.
\>wake up in the middle of a night
\>you feel gentle, warm, wet, sticky pressure around your temples and scalp
\>tentacles are tickling you on the neck and chin
\>if you could move and look, you'd see your illithid bf with a loving, serene expression as he painlessly nibbles on you, wanting you two to share your peaceful moods stemming from a nice cuddly sleep
\>sure, you need to thoroughly wash your hair every morning, but it's worth it

While this is exceedingly hot and I can only imagine how good the tentacles feel, I mostly want to feel close to that nice alien. Maybe kiss the tentacles, cuddle it, something. 

Ok that’s fucking adorable, I wouldn’t mind cuddling with a wierdo like them
Would these fellows be able to speak? If so what would they sound like? Gurgly? Like multiple people speaking at once?

You've had some problems understanding him (it? them? he prefers he because it's closer to you), because it's very subtle. It turns out that the quiet slaps and thuds of the tentacles mixed with a gentle gurgling from inside forms into actual phonemes and morphemes and words and sentences. It's a little like many worms, but instead of creepy, it's kind of deep and comforting. And, well, the best way to really understand him is to bury your face in him in an intimate hug and listen to him babble sweetness to you.
He, on the other hand, likes the way humans say a lot of things in quick succession with one set of organs and how different they all sound. Properly rolled 'r' sound melts him. Gotta practice rolling your arse, eh?

That’s an interesting way of putting it, really fits their whole thing
Also the idea of the eldritch bf being so interested in human speech and various other human things is so FUCKIN CUTE
I’ve always imagined an eldritch boi as alarmingly smart for a mass of tentacles. 

  \>"Hold that for a little moment, my human."
  \>"Huh?"
  \>"That sound you just made, could you do it again?"
  \>"Uh, sure," you produce a pretty common consonant.
  \>"How exactly are you reproducing that sound?"
  \>You try to, not exactly professionally, explain how your tongue moves to do so.
  \>"May I see it for myself?"
  \>A tentacle circles around your lips and when you open your mouth, enters it.
  \>It's smooth and tastes a little salty, but with an otherworldly scent that's somewhat comforting.
  \>It gently rolls around your mouth and even the back of it, making a mental image of the cavity.
  \>"Now, try to repeat it."
  \>You do, even though the tentacle makes it pretty much impossible to pronounce it right.
  \>The organ twitches and detects your movements.
  \>"Wonderful, I had no idea the tongue could do that against the roof of your mouth! And... I must admit that the way it made vibrations was very pleasant."
  \>The tentacle retracts from your mouth, not before you give it a last kiss.
  \>You two do this sort of thing all the time, you do something seemingly usual and boring and he doesn't stop until he figures out what fascinates him about it.
  \>He still likes to just cuddle with his tentacles without using them to inspect your physiology.
  \>At least, not in a scientific way.

(...) Ideas for stuff concerning the tentacular bf? 

I got a few cute scenarios
\>Teaching him how to play vidya, he seems to favor RPGs and loves Darkest Dungeon in particular
\>Watching a movie with him, naturally he experiments with different genres
\>Going to the beach with him
\>Figuring out what clothing can actually work on him
\>Sexually experimenting with him, he seems to take great interest in the human body and what stimulates what.

  \>Playing a tycoon.
  \>"I don't understand the point of these, why are you simulating reality with a focus on materialism?"
  \>"I guess it's something most people can't achieve? Also, people like money and often high social standing?"
  \>"Ah, power and domination? That seems somewhat simple, especially when focused on just wealth."
  \>"Kinda? I don't really get it either, there's a lot of things the games let you do you could in theory do in real life, but you don't or can't. ANYWAY, speaking of escape from reality, you might like this."
  \>Play a couple of RPGs for a change.
  \>He seems to be much more interested in fully fictituous scenarios, even if they make less sense. Not so much the plots, but rather the environments and characters.
  \>Play Darkest Dungeon and find an Eldritch enemy.
  \>"This is fascinating, I thought humans had no idea about our kind before! And the way we are portrayed is almost universal, I wonder what causes that and where the similarities stem from."
  \>His tentacles babble excitedly and they seem to even say multiple things at once.
  \>"Coming from the sea, that's intriguing, maybe an alternative to us coming from space? I wonder why we're always seen as hostile. Does human perception of monstrousness play a role in it? Why do you -not- see me as a monster?"
  \>You really don't know.
    \>He has a very, very vaguely humanoid body.
  \>There's a lot of tentacles, mostly on his head, but also around his torso and his limbs can turn into sort of tentacles.
  \>He's used to being shrouded in a reality fabric that's unintelligible to your eyes.
  \>It's probably better if he finds something more normal.
  \>An extra large t-shirt sort of works, but a large number of his tentacles are more or less immobile there. At least they're not completely cramped.
  \>You draw where his tentacles are on the cloth with a marker and take the shirt to a tailor to make neatly designed holes in it.
  \>It's not for rituals, but for casual home cuddling, it's more than enough. And cute.

This suddenly makes me think he’s quite philosophical, always asking those questions you can never really have a direct answer to.
And he seems to be quite the thinker for even the simplest of things one would gloss over, like environment or world bulding, and perhaps question the motives of certain characters (boy what would he have to say about The Ancestor)
Also I can’t help but imagine he can use all kinds of pointlessly large words, kinda like the Ancestor. Although I imagine he simplifies things a bit.
