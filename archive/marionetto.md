%#696969%**about me**
 i'𝗆 morte, luciel or cielomort, use any i dont mind. i have a typing quirk + i speak in third person from time to time (only when extremely overwhelmed / trying to regulate my emotions) so it could be confusing, so let me know if you want me to stop using it if we do interact. i am pretty shy + always very nervous. nicknames are fine, however **do not** use any affectionate ones if we **aren't** close. i am a delicate person + i get (very) overwhelmed easily. please do not be overly mean or i'll take it the wrong way even if it is a joke. (only if we arent close). i am pretty nice, though once i get comfortable i will be a bit mean jokingly.  **always** tell me your boundaries & etc when speaking to me.%%

 %#696969%**BYI** 
 i block/unfriend people freely when uncomfortable. do not use tone indicators nor i need them used on me, however i do not mind if i need to use them on you, but there are times that i am a bit slow. so just let me know what way you meant the message in, though these moments happen rarely, so do not worry. nsfw jokes are fine, though **do not** make them about me or go too in detail, same goes for gorey jokes. i make kys/kms jokes + also say vulgar words sometimes. usually when i am more comfortable. **do not copy my typing quirk or other habits i have an individuality complex**, also not too mentally well. i am very passionate about my favorite characters as well.%%
