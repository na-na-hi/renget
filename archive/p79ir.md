You shifted uncomfortably in your sleep, sweating from the heat wave that had just assaulted you. Why the hell was it so hot all of a sudden? You definitely don't remember turning the heater on before you went to bed. 

Before even opening your eyes, you reached your hand over to grab your phone, which was always placed right beside you on your nightstand. When you instead felt the warm touch of a stone floor, you knew something was up. 

You opened your eyes groggily at first, still a bit tired from just being woken up, but quickly snapped them open once you got the first look of where you were. 

You definitely weren't in your room. In fact, you were pretty sure you weren't even on earth anymore. Just where were you? 

Before getting up to scan your surroundings, you noticed a very ominous, and very huge shadow looming over you from where you sat. 

Oh no. 

You could feel your heart pumping as you steeled yourself to turn around, already dreading to see whatever horror was there face-to-face. 

You decided to do it like a band-aid: snapping your body back in an instant and opening your eyes. You laid your eyes upon the beast. His large, strong imposing stature was the first thing you noticed: He was easily a bit more than twice your height, and that wasn't even counting his horns, which brought you to the next strange detail. His head, which was completely made of bone, with dark voids for each of his eyes. 

But most strange of all, was that upon his face was… A grin? 

Huh?

Before you could take a closer look to make sure you were seeing right, the large, beastly figure spread his powerful arms wide and bellowed out his first words. 

"Welcome!" He exclaimed cheerfully, his deep, commanding voice juxtaposing greatly with the happy tune of his words. 

You couldn't speak. Too surprised to find even a single word to say in your current situation. Thankfully, you didn't need to, as the odd figure in front of you continued talking. 

He put his hands on his hips, and looked down at you, grinning once again. "I understand you may be a bit confused by what just happened, so I'll try my best to explain, okay?" 

Still as confused as ever, you nodded slowly, eager to get some answers as to what exactly was going on. 

"First, there's me." He waved. "My name is Bar'gemoth, but you can just call me Barge if you want, I don't mind! Second, as to why you're here… Well, it's really all because of me, but I have a good reason for doing it!" Bar'gemoth explained.

You stood up because you were intrigued at what he was going to say, and wanted to pay full attention to it, but something caught your eye. Something big. 

To be blunt, it was his dick, and it was huge. 

Actually, it was about proportional to his size, but to you, it was still pretty fucking big. It hung loosely from the center of his beefy thighs, along with his hefty sac which swung like a pendulum with every slight movement he made. As soon as you noticed you were staring, you turned away from him nervously. It had only been a couple of minutes, you didn't even know what this guy wanted and you were already staring at his junk. 'Damn, at least have some tact.' You thought to yourself. 

The monster, noticing your awkward fidgeting, spoke up. "Oh! Oh man, so sorry! I actually read about this too, I just forgot! Ahh… I know how you mortals feel about seeing other being's more sensitive areas. Things are a little more open here, so I forgot to wear something, hold on…" 

You heard a strange noise emit from in front of you, but you kept looking away. 

"There! Better?" Bar'gemoth asked, prompting you to turn and see what he had done. 

Instead of just letting everything hang loose like before, he now had on a primitive piece of clothing which resembled a loincloth. It was crude, but at least it covered his lower half up enough so that you didn't feel weird staring at it, so you nodded. Plus, his upper half was also impressive in its own right, and it at least felt less weird to gawk at his broad chest than it was his manhood. 

"Alright, sorry about that, that's my fault, won't happen again, promise." He said nervously, causing you to question how someone as intimidating looking as himself could possibly sound nervous.

"Now, uh, back to what I was saying: the reason why you're here is because I've been… Keeping an eye on you. And I know that sounds bad! But hey, there's not much for us demon's to do here anyway other than watch mortals do stuff, so cut me some slack there."

Fair enough, you said to yourself as you continued to listen to him talk.

"Let me just get to the point here… I've noticed you have some… interesting tastes, in terms of what you look for in a partner." 

Welp, there was the embarrassment again. 

"No! Wait, don't feel bad! I've got weird tastes too! That's why I summoned you here!" He confessed, looking a bit more anxious as he kept going. 

"I mean, I didn't know if It would even work, since no one's ever really tried summoning from this side… And trust me, If I knew, I wouldn't have done it while you were sleeping, it's just, I was so excited and I wanted to make sure it worked so I ended up doing it, and now you're here and… Ahh, sorry. I'm rambling."

Bar'gemoth then took a deep breath and calmed himself down. You couldn't help but find the way he acted kind of cute in it's own unique way. I mean, he was a demon. A huge, handsome demon at that, and he was acting like a teenager with a crush. It was honestly adorable. 

Of course, not that he didn't look cute before he started acting like that. It was true what he said after all, you had a thing for guys like him. There was something about huge monster men that just hit the right buttons for you, and Bar'gemoth was definitely appealing to your tastes.

"I'm just gonna be blunt since I feel like I'm talking in circles right now. I'm a demon, and I like human's. You're a human, and if I've got you down right, you like demon's. So with that, I was wondering if you maybe… Want to do something?" 

He asked timidly, his voice getting slightly quieter as he went on. You opened your mouth to say something, but were cut off. 

"You can say no if you want! I don't want this to feel like I'm forcing you or anything! Definitely not! I completely understand if you don't want to do anythi-"

"Yes." You said, abruptly.

The demon stopped talking for just a moment, before his skeletal face shifted into a happy grin once more, taking you into his arms and pushing you against his large, muscled chest. 

"Oh, thank you! Thank you so much for saying yes! You have no idea how happy that makes me! I promise you won't regret this, I'm gonna make sure of that!" He yelled, starting to shake his tail happily against the ground. 

You were close enough to him now that you could feel the soft fur that covered his neck. It was remarkably soft, and it didn't take much for you to give in and relax into his embrace. You stayed like that for a while before feeling one of his fingers tap against your back. 

"I know I'm being a bit forward here… But are you okay with just heading back into my place?" 

You lifted your head from the soft fluff of his neck, and looked at him. You were gonna say yes anyway, but the Demon just looked so cute with that timid, hopeful smile on his face. Like he'd be crushed if you said no. God, it was adorable. 

"Sure, let's go." You replied, holding on even tighter to him as he let out what you could've sworn was a squeal, and began to walk towards wherever his home was, with you securely in his arms. 

-------------------------------------------------------

It didn't take long at all for you to get to his place. It didn't really look like something you would consider a home back on earth. It was a basically a large carved out rock with a black floor that looked only somewhat cleaner than the ground outside. 

Once Bar'gemoth stepped inside, he gently placed you on the floor and turned around to wave his hand at the opening in his home, which had somehow closed in on itself, just how, you weren't sure. Then again, there were plenty of things about this whole situation that were pretty questionable. Best to just not think about it and enjoy the moment. 

There was an attractive, kind, and gigantic demon guy who wanted to hook up with you. It was pretty much the dream for someone like you, best just take it at face value.

After the demon had sealed his home, he turned back to you, leaning down further until his bone face was as close as it could get to yours. His eyes, hidden in the shadows of his skull, now turning into a slightly more seductive expression, instead of his usual cheery one. 

It was getting a bit intense. 

You gulped and took a step back, keen on seeing where he was going with this, but a bit scared to really initiate yourself. 

"Oh! Wait!" Bar'gemoth said, stopping his heated gaze and turning back into his original happy-sounding self. "What was I thinking? We can't just do it right here on the floor! Hold on… Just one second…" 

You eyed him curiously for a moment as the Demon began pondering something, humming to himself with muted tones. Eventually, it seemed he finally found his answer. 

With a bright, skeletal grin, he snapped his fingers together. The strange sound you heard from before rang against your ears again, and in the very next moment, your feet were no longer on the floor. 

Instead, you were laid back against the soft touch of a mattress. It wasn't just any plain mattress though: the blanket that covered it was decorated in heart patterns, and there were red, pink and white pillows all around it. It was something straight out of a cheesy romance film. 

It was also huge. In fact, you guessed it was big enough for Bar'gemoth to fit on. And so he did, plopping himself right on the large bed and resting his head on his propped up elbows. Just looking at you with tender eyes. 

"I know that some humans like to have these designs when they're making love, figured I'd make it more comfortable for you." He explained, moving one of his hands towards you as he began rubbing one of his fingers against your palm. 

"So… Have any ideas on what you wanna do? I'm kind of at a loss since I didn't think you'd be here so soon. I'd be willing to do anything though. Giving, receiving. I'm not picky as long as it's with you."

You could feel your dick jump at the prospect of doing either of those things with Bar'gemoth, but… How? 

"Uhh… Not that either of those aren't super hot, but just how are we supposed to do either? You're kinda huge." 

He laughed. "Guess we'll just have to get a bit creative then, won't we? But first, give me an answer, how do you want me? Giving, or receiving?" 

It wasn't really a hard choice for you, considering you were obviously gonna do both before this was over. So you just decided to bottom for him first, since you already had an idea of what you could do. It unfortunately didn't involve his dick going inside you, but that was gonna be impossible anyway. Your idea was about as close as you could get. 

"Giving." You answered, earning a grunt from your larger partner as he sat up on his knees, looming over you. 

"Fine by me." He said, slipping his fingers underneath the fabric that was covering his impressive length. "Guess that means you won't mind me taking this off now?" He teased. 

You shook your head, and watched as he took his claws, and ripped both of the thin strings at the sides apart, letting the cloth fall slowly, and revealing his length to you, which already seemed to be half hard. You'd already seen it before, true, but it didn't make it any less wonderful to look at.

Bar'gemoth then put both his hands on his hips, letting his naked form completely bare for you to see, and letting his cock flop in all its glory. "So how do you wanna do this?" 

Before answering, you undressed yourself as well, hastily. Once you were done, you got into position by laying flat on the bed, face up.

The demon looked a bit confused, so you explained. 

"Uhh… Okay, so can you just like… Grind on me?" You said, a little bit embarrassed at how blunt you had to be. It's true, sex was supposed to be natural and kind of a 'do what you think is right' situation, but this was a bit of a special case. 

It took a bit for Bar'gemoth to understand what you meant with your admittedly undescriptive explanation of what you wanted. Still, once he moved forward and dropped his heavy shaft on your body, you knew he got the idea. 

He pressed his hands down against the mattress, trapping you and giving you a really good feel of just how great the size difference was between you two. It only made you more excited, however. 

"You ready?" He asked, spreading his legs a bit. 

You looked directly at the large cock that was now pressed against you. You could see a bead of pre dripping down from his tip onto your chest, which showed how excited he was for this too. 

You took a deep breath before answering. "Yeah, go ahead." 

Without hesitation, Bar'gemoth bucked his hips forward, pressing his weighty shaft against your body. You had to grab the bed with both your hands just to stay in one place. His thrusts were desperate, but slow. Most likely on purpose, in order to draw out the moment as long as possible. 

After he had finished his first rut, you could hear a loud breath emit from the demon. He must've been pretty eager up if he was already getting this worked up. 

He reared back and readied himself once again, grinding his meat against you and letting out a deep rumble as he did. It was probably the weirdest way to frot against someone, but the disparity between you two only enhanced the experience, in your opinion. Feeling his cock gradually grow harder with each cycle made you more excited as well. 

As Bar'gemoth kept going, his cock seemed to grow more appealing by the second. You couldn't just do nothing while the demon's well hung length was so close to you, so you raised your arms and wrapped them as closely as you could around his cock, stroking him as he continued to work himself on you. 

The new, more intense sensation had Bar'gemoth moaning louder than before. With both the friction of his movement, and your hands working in tandem, he could barely keep quiet. Pre began leaking more than ever. 

You worried for a moment that he was close, and you were about to get the most messy facial of your life. 

He stopped not long after, panting loudly before taking his member off your chest. He looked at you, still catching his breath. 

"Sorry. I was getting close, but I didn't want to finish before you got your turn." He said, though a few more gasps. 

"My turn?" You repeated. 

Bar'gemoth nodded. "Yeah. It's your turn to give. I don't wanna do just one thing and be done. I've never done anything with a human before, and now that you're here, I wanna do a lot." There was a grin on his face as he said those last words. 

"I don't know, like I said before, you are pretty big. I can't even think of where to begin." You said. While just the idea of a big bad demon like Bar'gemoth bottoming was enough to get you going by itself, it was a bit hard to actually think of something to do when you were in the moment. Even more so when you couldn't just fuck him like you could anyone else. 

"Take your time, I've been waiting years for this, I think I can wait a couple more minutes. Just remember, I'm not afraid of getting a bit submissive if you want me to…" Said the demon, his voice becoming deep and sultry, and his eyes shifting into those same seductive slits as they did before. "I'll do whatever you want." 

Oh god, did he know how to push your buttons. 

"Uhh… Okay, then can you… I don't know, turn around for me?" 

The demon turned his smile into a smirk. "Do you want me to present my backside to you, human?" 

Woah. 

You said yes, obviously, but that part that really made your dick jump was the "human" he added at the end. Something about it just… Stimulated you. It was weird. Like a mix of him being demanding, yet servile at the same time. You liked it. 

But you liked what you saw in front of you more. Oh, it was truly something incredible.

Bar'gemoth had bent over, his knees spread on the bed, giving you a complete view of his behind. Powerful legs. Round, heavy balls. And most notably, two perfect globes of pure muscle that parted to let you see his inviting hole right in the center. His tail swayed side to side in a taunting motion, almost daring you to go over to it. 

You walked over to him, and thankfully, when you stood up, you were level with his opening, which gave you much more options than if you had to reach up.

Oh, you could hardly wait to do something to him. But first… "Hey, Bar'gemoth… Can I ask you do something for me?" 

"Hmmm?" 

You paused before making your request. "Could you… Do that thing where you referred to me as human? And could you make it more… Demanding?" 

"Oh, yeah, I think I can do that. Let's see here…" The Demon then cleared his throat before speaking again. His tone now deeper, and more menacing than it has ever been before now. 

"Will this suffice, human?" 

Both you, and your dick agreed that yes, it would suffice. 

You approach his giant backside once again, laying your hands on his flank and giving both his cheeks a firm squeeze before spreading them apart and giving you a better look at the real prize.

It took a bit of fighting with your own brain to finally get the courage to do what you wanted. You remember Bar'gemoth said he'd be okay with anything, but it was still a bit embarrassing for you to actually just do what you wanted. It was either now or never though, and you definitely weren't gonna pass up this chance. 

You pushed yourself forward, nose first, and before doing anything else, took a good whiff of the demon you were soon to be pleasuring. 

His masculine, heady musk hit you immediately. It definitely wasn't unpleasant, just a bit stronger than what you'd been anticipating. Honestly though, you should've expected it. With the heat here, it probably wasn't hard to work up a sweat. Especially for Bar'gemoth, what with fur and everything. 

You reared back a bit before diving in once more. 

"Mmmm… Yes, human. Take in my scent… I've worked hard to make it strong for you. Enjoy it." 

Goddamn. 

You huffed his scent one final time, letting his musk burn through your nostrils again and fully appreciating all of him. His smell had turned your mind hazy, and nothing seemed more important at the moment than Bar'gemoth and making sure you did a good job making him feel good. 

More determined now than before, as the great demon goaded you with his powerful voice, you stuck out your tongue, and began dragging it over his hole, lapping up every drop of sweat that you could find. 

"Ohhh, human… To lick me even there… Oh, continue…"

The large demon commanded, gently pushing his tail against the back of your head, keeping you in place. Not that you cared at all, mind you. This was exactly where you wanted to be.

You reached forward to take a hold of the demon's hefty sac, each of the enormous orbs much too big to fit in your hands. You played with them for a bit, watching in amazement as they dropped with such force whenever you held them up. 

You could hear the demon moan above you, growing louder each time you dropped his orbs and watched them swing. 

"Ahh… I see you aren't afraid to be rough with my more delicate parts… Very well, go on, human."

'Don't mind if I do.' You mused, moving your  hands onto his thick, girthy length that hung lazily in between his tree trunk legs. You pressed your hands against his shaft, and began to knead his flesh, hitting every sensitive nerve you could. He was close again, you could tell. 

Before he finished, you took this chance to press your mouth against his pucker once more, and press a few gentle kisses to the ring of muscle. It flexed underneath your touch, as did his shaft. 

You plunged your nose back in his hole, moving your hands onto your own manhood and jerking yourself off as quick as you could, hoping to reach climax alongside the demon. It worked, although you'd doubt anyone but you would even be able to tell as he busted his load. His hot, demonic seed drenching the bed as his breathing became sporadic and heavy. 

You gawked at the amount he was able to produce before collapsing backwards into the sheets. He must've been really pent up. Not long after, he fell onto the bed right next to you, both of you exhausted from the strange, but absolutely enjoyable sex. 

Bar'gemoth turned to you, his expression content as could be, before closing the distance and pressing his bony face against yours. Despite the difference in size making it a bit unusual, you still found it sweet, and moved into his touch. 

"That was nice." The demon said quietly, returning to his original kind voice. "Very nice. Actually… You wouldn't mind doing this again sometime, right? I'd hate for this to just be a one time thing…" 

He looked at you with dreamy eyes, sitting up and turning to you, his head rested up on one elbow as his free hand aimlessly fiddled with one of the sheets. 

"Oh, and uh… Don't worry about the mess, I'll clean it up later. As for you going home, I can send you back whenever you want. But… Can we cuddle first?" 

How could you not? 

You didn't even respond to his question, instead just moving closer to the big warm demon and nestling yourself against his chest. The low rumbles coming from his chest showed he was happy. Which was good, because so were you. 

You still couldn't really understand why you were here, or how, hopefully Bar'gemoth would explain that to you later, but for now, it was fine to just be thrilled it happened.
