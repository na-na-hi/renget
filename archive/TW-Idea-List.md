## Accessory System

## Building (LiG Housing) & Carpentry Skill
- In response to requests for the MC to be able to make their own furniture, in order to bypass paying for a commission at the Human Village, I believe it would be best represented by a skill.
- This skill could theoretically tie into being able to build your own house.
- The specifics have yet to be determined; concerns about balancing issues have been raised.
- Alternatively, porting over the LiG housing system as a money sink may be a more viable option, with the carpentry skill being used for minor things.
## “Can I Sleep With You?”
- Touhous living on the same map as you should sometimes ask to sleep in your room instead of their own. Mainly for the wholesome “gf spooning” experience while keeping your own room, but it can also serve as an excuse to change something about 2hus that stupidly masturbate right next to you while you sleep. Like you know, have actual sex at the cost of waking up a bit more tired.
If she’s horny enough it should be something like “X tries to gently shake you awake”, you can wake up and fuck her or pretend to be asleep to see if she has any special masturbation dialogue, as to not render it impossible to access.
Somnophilia is also a thing, hint hint.
The higher the favor the bigger the chance. Should also be possible for multiple lovers to ask for it simultaneously. If you’re spending majority of your day underneath a pile of women, why not spend majority of your night drowning in girl’s affections too?
Btw this suggestion is for AnonTW, not any other branch. Don’t you dare steal it, pedina.
