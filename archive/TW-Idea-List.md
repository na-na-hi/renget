## “Can I Sleep With You?”
- Touhous living on the same map as you should sometimes ask to sleep in your room instead of their own. Mainly for the wholesome “gf spooning” experience while keeping your own room, but it can also serve as an excuse to change something about 2hus that stupidly masturbate right next to you while you sleep. Like you know, have actual sex at the cost of waking up a bit more tired.
If she’s horny enough it should be something like “X tries to gently shake you awake”, you can wake up and fuck her or pretend to be asleep to see if she has any special masturbation dialogue, as to not render it impossible to access.
Somnophilia is also a thing, hint hint.
The higher the favor the bigger the chance. Should also be possible for multiple lovers to ask for it simultaneously. If you’re spending majority of your day underneath a pile of women, why not spend majority of your night drowning in girl’s affections too?
Btw this suggestion is for AnonTW, not any other branch. Don’t you dare steal it, pedina.
## Childcare Expansion
- To be determined.
## Danmaku Expansion

## Dating Expansion
An expansion of the functionality of the dating system, such as visiting an izakaya, going out for karaoke, and other distinct dating locations based on map, which might allow the player to train other stats while on dates and minimize the sameness of dating.
For example:
- [Go to an Izakaya] could be an expensive alternative of [Eat Together] since it involves alcoholic drinks and there’s just more things you can do with alcohol involved. Potential features include:
	- A main drinking mini game where you two compete in some sort of game; the losing side drinks a round.
	- Drunken conversation.
	- A “Mood” meter that gives a boost to everything you do during the entire scene.
	- If someone passes out from drinking the entire scene is over (the date should still go on so drunk rape can happen), which forces the player to engage in resource management.
- [Engage in Karaoke!] should not penalize either of you if you have low musical skill because it is merely a fun party activity; however, it should give a boost if either of you do have a high musical skill.
- [Window Shopping at Kourindou]
- Event specific ideas such as [View the Fireworks] on New Year’s Day.
## Egg Laying Mechanic

## Hate Mark Date Forgiveness Overhaul

## Hickey Mechanic Tweak
- https://gitgud.io/Pedy/pedy-tw/-/issues/11
## Hypnosis Expansion
- In particular, the ability to guarantee that morning sex events happen the following day, the ability to make characters exhibitionists/nudists (they would walk around in their underwear or naked), and the ability to make characters surrender their panties to you and/or not care if they catch you with panties.
## Incident Scenario
- To be determined; initial concept by AK Spectre and Eri.
## Jealousy Expansion
- To be determined.
## LiG Housing System & Carpentry Skill
In response to requests for the MC to be able to make their own furniture, in order to bypass paying for a commission at the Human Village, I believe it would be best represented by a skill.
- This skill could theoretically tie into being able to build your own house.
- The specifics have yet to be determined; concerns about balancing issues have been raised.

Alternatively, porting over the LiG housing system as a money sink may be a more viable option, with the carpentry skill being used for minor things.
## Map for Makai
- Self-explanatory; in the past, requests were made to relocate Makai citizens to their home dimension to create room for homeless characters.
## Milking Improvements
- https://gitgud.io/Pedy/pedy-tw/-/issues/31
## New Achievement Ideas
- https://gitgud.io/Pedy/pedy-tw/-/issues/14
## New Request Ideas
- https://gitgud.io/Pedy/pedy-tw/-/issues/18
## Research System
- A feature to allow the player to research recipes.
- Mixing would be a method to achieve quick results, whereas research would take more time but produce more consistent results; i.e. expediency at the expense of time vs. consistency at the expense of time.
- This technique could be used instead of interacting with certain 2hus to unlock recipes.
- Plans for implementing some type of counter-balancing so that this system does not overrun the original mixing mechanism will be addressed.
## Sex Act Expansion
- This issue will serve as a non-exhaustive list of sex acts to be added to TW as commands specific to character and species. Facesitting, gap shenanigans with Yukari, tailjobs, and wingjobs are among the examples which have been requested.
## Tanuki Loans via Mamizou
- A feature that allows the player to request a loan from Mamizou, with the risk of losing reputation if they do not repay it in a timely manner.
