	- In particular, the ability to guarantee that morning sex events happen the following day, the ability to make characters exhibitionists/nudists (they would walk around in their underwear or naked), and the ability to make characters surrender their panties to you and/or not care if they catch you with panties.
- Feature: “Can I Sleep With You?”, Spooning, & Et cetera
	- Touhous living on the same map as you should sometimes ask to sleep in your room instead of their own. Mainly for the wholesome “gf spooning” experience while keeping your own room, but it can also serve as an excuse to change something about 2hus that stupidly masturbate right next to you while you sleep. Like you know, have actual sex at the cost of waking up a bit more tired. 
	- If she’s horny enough it should be something like “X tries to gently shake you awake”, you can wake up and fuck her or pretend to be asleep to see if she has any special masturbation dialogue, as to not render it impossible to access.
	- Somnophilia is also a thing, hint hint.
	- The higher the favor the bigger the chance. Should also be possible for multiple lovers to ask for it simultaneously. If you’re spending majority of your day underneath a pile of women, why not spend majority of your night drowning in girl’s affections too?
	- Btw this suggestion is for AnonTW, not any other branch. Don’t you dare steal it, pedina.
