# -> **Pygmalion bot prompts** <-
-> Written and maintained by YuriFag <-

# This Rentry will not be seeing updates for the forseeable future. Cataloging characters has come to be a tedious task with 40+ posted a day. 
# I have written a new guide on Pygmalion Tips and Character Creation here: https://rentry.org/PygTips

This rentry will be a collection of prompts and news on character creation for Pygmalion. If you would like yours added, simply post your json to catbox or anyother file hosting service to either /aicg/, /wAIfu/, or /aids/. This Rentry simply is serving as a stop gap until the devs come up with a real sharing method. If this rentry gets big enough I will add a table of contents.

- JSON
- Human facing info, anything you want to tell other anons about your bot.
- Image (Optional)
- Name to be credited by.

## News:
->**1/19/23**<-
- **I am changing the format of this website to be far more barebones, with the wealth of characters being posted it would be far to much to format and type out greetings and scenarios.**
- Pygmalion.chat domain secured for future website. (Nothing there as of now.)
- Pygmalion Logo created, https://imgur.com/a/nXWsZdj (May not be used forever, seems like it is unliked)
- Pygmalion becomes the 3rd most downloaded conversational model on huggingface
 ->**1/18/23**<-
- Humi, the developer of the TavernAI front end, confirmed to be working on big update, should be released in the next couple of days. Image: https://imgur.com/a/0Vug2Hw
- Pygmalion official logo being worked on by some partners, devs hard at work on v6 and new UI.
 ->**1/17/23**<-
- V5 found to be heavily overfitted, hopefully we see a new model soon, I'd probably avoid the beta branch in the meantime.
- Matrixfag returns, to announce Pygmalion V5, experiment 4, a new experimental model on the beta branch. This model is designed to respond better to user input, instead of everything in the chat log mashed together. See full post here: https://imgur.com/a/y8oVvHQ
 ->**1/14/23**<-
- Chat saving added to official Pygmalion Notebook.
- Devs release PygmalionV3 to the official notebook, the beta is now set to be PygmalionV4 a more experimental version. 
- Memory problem confirmed in Offical Pygmalion notebook, by yours truly. Pygmalion V3 on the beta branch mitigates this problem a bit. Use Tavern/Kobold if you can't wait for the the true fix.
- First person prompts and actions confirmed to perform worse. Try to describe your characters from a narrators perspective. "Galatea is a statue of marble, she was created by Pygmalion, an ancient Greek sculptor." 
 ->**1/12/23**<-
- General advice for getting characters to act a certain way, don't prompt using negative statements if possible: https://imgur.com/a/lXjgt0n
- General intresting discussion from the matrix chat, persona injection, memory stuff: https://imgur.com/a/SLTnHhK
- Matrxifag returns with a new update, discussing the new experimental model, beta mode, and saving chats! Read the full post here: https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/90861511#p90861716 Images: https://imgur.com/a/AqZY7tI
- Devs confirm better sharing methods are planned, this rentry will eventually become obsolete: https://imgur.com/a/P00HJet
- Devs confirm new model is in the works, and may already be finished: https://imgur.com/a/9KAMSVl
- More testing, from a dev at that seems to imply that using <START> tokens really does improve the output: https://imgur.com/a/aqsgtgO
- Example chats said to be one the stronger factors that influence output; https://imgur.com/a/7AQMebu They also may work on a new system for persona injection, that will lead to better and more accurate portrayal of characters, but that will probably take a while.
- Name bias confirmed: https://imgur.com/a/cNhFW4c Devs seem to want to implement this a feature though. Their next move is currently unknown.
->**1/11/23**<-
- Anon discovers name bias https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/90850752#p90852038
  Try short descriptions of the character instead of their name, see "Adoptive Daughter" and "Abusive HS Girlfriend" as examples.
  Please post your findings on /aicg/ or /vt/. I have already informed the devs of this and hopefully we'll get a statement tomorrow.
  I have been finding it weird that these two bots have been preforming so well, but this would explain it. Images here; https://imgur.com/a/dgVgu0C
- Local Anon does some testing! Read the whole post here: https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/90848678#p90850689 or in a thread archive.
 This anon proves it's possible to pick back up where you left off in CAI, and does a direct comparison. Think of what will be possible when we have   token editing! Images: https://imgur.com/a/V3ObzJn (Includes addendum by anon)
- Anon confirms out of character messages do have an effect; https://imgur.com/a/ZbmUvgA (Only one example, but give it a shot!)
- Dev's confirm memory issue relating to personalities and example chats; https://imgur.com/a/qeoEB8f 
- Some anons reporting that using <START> tags after dialog in the example chats section can improve character personality; https://imgur.com/a/fyvA6pv

## ->FAQ<-
- Q: Why is there so few characters?
	- A: We need more to be posted, I've checked every thread since the announcement, and this really is all the json's we've gotten. Seems sharing isn't a high priority right now. You can always share your creations and make this rentry even better!
- Q: Where's some normal girls to try, why all the fetish/loli bots?
	- A: It's not like I wanted it to be this way! If we get some more normal character jsons, I'll add them to the top of the list. Sorry!
