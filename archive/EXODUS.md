EXODUS
 
Crossing the sea of light,
the birds rest their wings by the window,
and start chirping, talking about their past days.
These normal things that no one cares about, things that I've started to forget,
have now become so dear.
 
Baring its fangs, the ordinary everyday life shows its true form.
Even though it shouldn't be something special or worth mentioning. Why?
 
Floating
on my fountain of imagination
are images of the sun hidding behind clouds, and of the sands wet from rain.
The skirt
that I've always longed for, someday, I want to try dancing to the rhythm of the waves while wearing it. Is it okay for me to have dreams?
 
Noisily, the birds start to
prepare for another journey.
Reflected in their eyes is the image of their next destination.
I wish they would put me on their back,
and take me out of here.
But my voice just won't reach them.
 
Just like now, even though I'm always looking up at it,
the blue sky stays silent, never gave me any kind of answer. However
 
In a deep breath,
I'm gonna bring the swaying coral reefs
under the sea of mirage into being.
And then,
while listening to sound of the waves, I'll throw my shoes away,
and run along with the horizon. Is it okay for me to have dreams?
