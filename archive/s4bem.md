\>laying in bed at night, listening to the wind howl outside
\>alone in your house, and yet can’t shake the feeling someone is watching you
\>someone, or something
\>try to ignore those thoughts as you close your eyes
\>still, after several minutes, that sense is growing stronger
\>peel your eyes open a bit to glance around
\>funny, you don’t remember putting your winter coat near the door
\>lay back down setting a reminder to deal with it in the morning
\>wait
\>you don’t own a winter coat
\>glance back to see the shape is gone
\>start feeling uneasy
\>that’s when you hear it
\>heavy breathing
\>guttural breathing
\>deep, animalistic breathing
\>but you can’t place where it’s coming from
\>feels like it’s coming from all directions
\>and it’s growing louder
\>closer
\>coming for you
\>you tell yourself it’s just night terrors as you scrunch under the covers
\>the floor creaks as you watch a shape emerge at the foot of your bed
\>as it takes form, you catch a few darkened features
\>curled horns
\>muzzle full of what must be sharp teeth
\>hulking figure easily eight feet tall
\>and it’s glaring down on you
\>sizing up its prey
\>feeling your body frozen in fear as it reaches out with a clawed hand
\>mere inches from your face
\>and then, in a deep, growling snarl, it speaks
\>”tonight, you’re my cute little snack…”
\>at that, you can’t help but burst out laughing
\>”I knew it” the beast responds, face red as he flips the lights on “knew it sounded better in my head”
\>”It’s alright” you tell him, patting the bed next to you “the lead up was a lot better than usual”
\>with a frustrated huff, the demon curls up next to you
\>you do your best to wrap your arms around his frame to comfort him
\>”Just gotta keep at it, and I’m sure you’ll pass the demon entrance exams”
\>another huff escapes his lips as he pouts
\>”You’re just saying that. I know I’m too much of a softie”
\>”You’re a softie where it counts” you respond, pressing a peck on his back. ”That’s what I love about you”
\>you can feel him blush at that “stop, you’re gonna make me tear up you jerk”
\>”Well, maybe you could work that in the routine. A scary, crying demon”
\>”Oh shut up, now you’re just being a real jerk”
\>you both chuckle, flip the lights off, and snuggle together for the night
\>”I love you Oronnoth”
\>”Love you too anon”
