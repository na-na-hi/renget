###->CHAPTER 1: Unhappy Endings<-

Colonel Eva Graham sat across from her Human prisoner, she had caught him yesterday after a scuffle with him. He was carrying a Wolf pup on his chest and a handgun. He even attempted to kill one of her soldiers! The gall of this Human was unlike anything she had seen before. A lesson must be taught to this scum.

She stared at him for a moment, staring into his eyes, and told him, "Your race is meat. Your future is meat. Your job is meat. Your name is meat. You're a thick slab of human flesh laid out on the cutting board for me, nothing more." She leaned down and grabbed his chin, "What's your name?"

"It's Anon," the Human replied. She stroked his temple softly with her left hand, then slapped his face with the right.

"Meat," she said softly. "You answer to meat now. Say 'yes.'"

The Human- no, meat, stared at her. He grinned and started giggling. "Fucking bitch. Fucking shrivelled up bitch, wrinkly old military bitch." He said while going into a fit of laughter. "Cunt like a rotten three-week-old peach black and dripping."

Eva became enraged, but refused to show it to the meat, she took a deep breath and exhaled through her nose. "Private, go get my interrogation kit."

"Yes, ma'am," responded the private, who saluted and left to retrieve it. 

Eva planned on making him suffer. She got out of her seat and began walking around him, studying her meat. When she made a full rotation she kicked him in the chest, sending him to the ground, and followed up with another kick.

"We have a strategy for difficult little humie roaches who don't know their place. Third and last chance for tonight, meat. Take off your pants, right here, right now."

The meat was half-laughing half-sobbing. "No damn way," he choked. 

Eva pressed her foot against the meat's throat. "I won't fuckin' ask again, meat. Take. Those. Pants. Off." She began leaning her full bodyweight into his neck, slowly applying pressure. She was fine with doing it with an unconscious slab of meat. It didn't matter how it was prepared for her.

Then, the room and her meat disappeared, replaced with black. Her foot slammed against the now eternally black ground.

"What the fuck!?" She exclaimed, looking around at the darkness, there was nothing but herself.

"Ah, my child has finally arrived, as anticipated." A voice boomed. Eva looked around to find the source, but it seemed omnipresent.

"Who the fuck are you? What's going on?" Eva yelled.

"I am the Lord, the Father, creator of all." The voice said.

"Oh yeah? Then I'm the tooth fairy."

"Amusing, my child, but pointless. Your life has come to pass, your trial is over." 

"What? I'm dead? What trial? Give me answers damnit!" Eva continued to yell into the void.

"SILENCE." The voice commanded, and Eva felt compelled to listen, her anger turned to almost fear, it felt like she was being scolded by her father again. "Life is a test of your soul, to test its pureness, your deserving of a right to live in the Kingdom of Heaven, with Humanity, built in my image and tested just as you are." 

"Built in your image? Bullshit! They are nothing but useful slabs of meat for pleasure, nothing more." 

"And that is one of the many sins you have committed. Your lust, your wrath, which you have shown me and shown to all in your final moments. You have continued the subjugation of the race I put there to watch over YOU." 

Eva understood what He said, she understood where this was going. "But aren't you supposed to forgive? They said we would be forgiven of our sins." 

"Indeed," He confirmed, "I forgive, but that does not mean you are free of punishment." 

"But I only did the best with what you gave me, you bastard! You are the reason I am the way I am." Eva argued.

"It is true, I allowed you to be born into that world, but that does not mean I controlled your life. After all it wouldn't be a test then, would it?" He asked.

"You fuck! So you'll just leave me in this fucking void? To make me sit in timeout and reflect like I'm a pup who played in the mud?"

"No." He said flatly, and paused for a moment, then continued. "Even this eternal darkness is far brighter than the fate that awaits you," was the last she heard of the echoing voice before she lost consciousness.


###->CHAPTER 2: New Experiences Aren't Always Good<-

Eva awoke violently, as if waking up from a terrible nightmare. Her eyes met the gray sky as she laid on her back. The air felt cold, come to mention it, so did the ground. She sat up and got a look at her surroundings. 

Snow was all around her, about three inches deep at least. Tanks and armored transports lay burned and wrecked, but they didn't look like any vehicles the State used. Some bodies of what appeared to be Anthros were on the ground and charred limbs stuck out of open areas of the various wrecks. The air reeked of death.

She wondered if the last few hours were all just a dream, perhaps she was knocked unconscious during battle, got some amnesia too? Eva got up and checked herself. No signs of injuries, her clothes were completely intact, but her pistol and ammunition were gone, figures.
 
"Hello? Is anyone there? Anyone alive?" Eva called, hoping to find someone, they had to know what happened.

A loud groan responded to her call. The noise came from her left, and she started heading in the direction of it.

"Where are you? I need you to call out again," Eva yelled. Another groan, this time to her right, she could smell them now. She followed the sound and found the source, an Anthro wearing a uniform closely resembling a State military uniform laid against the back of a transport clutching its abdomen. At least, Eva thought it was an Anthro. 

It had a rodent-like appearance from the neck down, but the head was one of a canine and had two saberteeth. It was a female too, telling by the fact it had breasts. Nothing like Eva had seen before. 

Eva rushed to the unknown Anthro's side. "What happened to you, are you hurt?"

"Sie doth ard in," the Anthro choked, and let go of her crimson colored abdomen, revealing a metal rod with fins at the end impaling her.

"Holy shit," Eva said, not even paying attention to the fact the Anthro was speaking gibberish. Eva knew she had to stabilize the Anthro before her questions could have answers, and she knew she couldn't just pull it out without something to patch the wound, or the bleeding would worsen. "Is there a first aid kit around? Something I can use to help you?" 

"Uh? S'kot dir ind?" The Anthro asked weakly.

Eva began to panic, "I need you to speak English, I can't help you if you are incoherent.
Where the fuck is a medical kit?"

"Ki'ji fur sind," the Anthro said in a labored breath.

"I'm going to find a medical kit, try to stay awake," Eva told her, and bounded off.

Eva searched endlessly in the cold, deserted battleground. The wrecks had nothing, they were all burned. She found more Anthro bodies laid about and checked them too, no luck. She found a lever action rifle with just a single round left in it on them though. She slung it over her shoulder and returned to the injured Anthro. Thankfully she was still awake, and looked excited to see Eva again.

"Do you know where our Headquarters is?" Eva asked her. The Anthro tilted her head. 

Eva quickly drew a crude picture of a house in the snow, and pointed at it. "Home? Do you know where that is?"

The Anthro pointed in front of her, "Im hom skind"

Eva pointed in the same direction. "That way?" The Anthro nodded in response. "Well, let's get you home." Eva put one of the Anthro's arms over her neck, put her arm under the Anthro's armpit, and lifted her up. Eva was taller than her, standing at 6'1, while this Anthro was particularly short compared to her, only 5'6 at most.

Off to their right was a hill that went towards where the Anthro said HQ was, and slowly made their way to the top. A highway laid atop the hill, and the silhouette of buildings was in the distance roughly a mile or two away. That must be where the HQ was, so they began their trek towards it.

Now it was snowing, and the wind started to howl. Eva was getting cold now, even with this Anthro at her side. The visibility got worse and worse, the town was out of sight for them, but they pushed onwards.

The town was in sight again, but it was all too much for the injured Anthro, and she collapsed to the ground, falling on her side, then rolled to her back. Eva went to the Anthro's side. The movement must’ve caused too much damage.

"Hey, c'mon we're so close, see?" Eva said and pointed to the townhouses. "Just a little further and we'll make it." Eva's words of encouragement were in vain, the Anthro fell limp, and unresponsive.

"FUCK!" Eva yelled, grabbed her rifle, and in a fit of rage threw the rifle onto the asphalt, accidentally discharging it. Luckily she wasn't hit. Eva sat there for a moment, angry at herself. A soldier under her had died on her watch. This has never happened before, she was able to bring them all to safety before, after every attack from Human partisans.

She stopped her thoughts right there. Humans. The only ones that could be responsible for this, the State wasn't at war with no Anthro nations, and Humans were their only enemies.

Though before she could sit and simmer in her rage towards Humanity, she heard something distant coming from the direction she was walking away from over the now quieter howling of the wind. She turned her head and saw silhouettes, over a dozen at least, in formation heading towards her.

They were close enough to smell too. She could smell something metallic in nature, and the familiar smell of the now deceased Anthro. They must’ve been State forces that captured some Humans, surely.

Eva got up and approached them. "Hey, I need help over here, I have a casualty!" She yelled at them. She got the pointman's attention, who was now going in a light jog towards her, flanked by two others.

As they approached, Eva knew something was off, they were all in black, and the metallic stench got stronger. A red glow came from their faces.

Now they came to a stop just about twenty or so feet ahead, and now they were clearly visible in the snow storm. 

[They had no tails, and no muzzle was visible through their helmets, they were Humans! Armored from head to toe in black, with visors dimly glowing crimson red.](https://www.deviantart.com/lurkingedgelord/art/Federation-of-Mankind-Marine-Standard-916932032)

Their guns were long, and made of what looked like a black steel, there was no bolt action nor was there an open bolt like a submachine gun. These weapons were aimed at her, if she moved, she would likely die or be seriously injured.

The pointman began to speak in a deep, distorted voice. "Hands in the air, now!" He ordered.

"I'm unarmed, humie. If you want me, come and get me the old fashioned way," she taunted, and balled her fists. She thought she could take them on, she had a few inches of all of them.

"Two, three, engage with non-lethal!" The pointman ordered, his gun still trained on her. The two others slung their rifles and replaced them with nightsticks, they pressed a button and electric sparks emanated from them.

"Now you've made it fun!" Eva said. The two Humans charged her, she threw a punch at the one on her left, and it connected with his faceplate, he stumbled back. She just barely dodged the second soldier's swing at her with the electrified nightstick. Eva responded with a kick to the abdomen, sending him to the ground.

She wasn't fast enough to deal with the first soldier's counterattack, and she got hit in the chest with the tip on the nightstick. All of her muscles tensed up, and it felt like every muscle in her body cramped at once. She fell to the ground, and let out a cry.

The Human kicked her in the stomach with this metal boot, she grabbed her stomach in pain and rolled on her side. Then a strike with the electrified nightstick, again, again, again, and again. All on different parts of the body, but mostly aimed at the face. Her entire body seized up at every strike.

Now the second Human joined in, and stomped on her snout, she let out another cry. She couldn't take much more of this, it was the worst pain she had ever felt in her entire life. The sound of her heartbeat was now thumping in her ears and tight pain in her chest.

"CEASE! We're ordered to bring em' in alive, you dolts." Said another distorted voice, likely the leader. Eva had her eyes shut now, it was painful to even open them, tears still escaped them.

"This is a feisty one sir," a soldier responded.

"What, because it didn't understand your order to stand down, and fought you?" The leader asked.

"No, sir, it refused in English, challenged us to fight them, called us 'humies.'" The soldier reported. There was silence, except for Eva's labored breaths.

"What have they been putting in your rations boy?" The leader asked.

"It's true sir, that's what happened." Said a distorted voice Eva recognized as the pointman.

"I gotta see this for myself, outta the way fellas." The leader said. She heard two pairs of metal feet get out of the way, and there was silence for a moment. "This thing looks like my dog, a Bloodhound I got back on Arcadia, ugly motherfucker too."

Eva was enraged, but too focused on the pain to show it. Humans had subjugated her people? Humanry finally crushed them? This couldn't be possible.

Eva felt a metal hand run across her head, petting her. "Speak, it's fine, you're safe now." He said in the most calming voice the distortion could allow him to.

"The State will have your heads, scum." Eva said weakly, and used the last of her energy to spit in front of her, sending saliva, blood, and a tooth in the direction she thought the Human was. The Human responded by grabbing the skin and fur on her head, and slammed her head against the asphalt. Eva whined.

"Get this bitch in formation, the FDA will want to see this, probably the Bureau too if her uniform has anything to say about it. Alders, Green, make sure she stays upright on the way back to the FOB." The leader ordered, and she could hear him walk away. Eva seethed at being called a bitch, reminding her of the dream she had, or was this still a part of the dream?

She was hoisted up, her legs barely able to sustain her body weight, threatening to fall at any moment. She was led by them, and felt them lead her hands to another's body.

"Hold onto them until you can see again, then put your hands in the air." The distorted voice told her.

"Alright, we're on the move!" Yelled the leader, and off they went. 


###->CHAPTER 3: Belly of the Beast<-

After what felt like hours, Eva was finally able to open her eyes again, and was met with the Sun shining through the gray clouds. The snow and wind ceased. She raised her hands in the air as ordered, and followed the Anthro she was put behind. She figured if she wanted to live and escape she had to wait for an opportunity to strike.

Other than the Human leader singing something about "the flowers of Bermuda" and something called "The Nightingale," Eva had been hearing a loud, heavy mechanical sound coming from behind her forever now, their footsteps were loud and shook the ground ever so slightly.

She turned to get a look at who it was, and the tinted glass visor of the soldier met eye level with hers. The suit he wore was big and bulky, the armor pieces were attached onto some kind of mechanized chassis, same with his arm mounted guns.

"Face forward!" The distorted voice told her, and pushed her, sending her to the asphalt, flat on her face. He then lifted her like she was a paperweight and put her back on her feet. "Do as I command and it won't happen again." She made a mental note not to fuck with him.

They finally reached the town, and out of the open ground that was the highway. A checkpoint was stationed there.

"Good God, what's that thing in the back?" A soldier asked in another deep and heavily distorted voice. This was a pattern, they were purposely hiding their voices with some kind of voice modulation technology.

"We don't fuckin' know, but the leeches are about to have a damn field day." Yelled the pointman. Eva had to keep a mental note of what they called what and who's who, as it could be key to her escape, but the issue now arose, she knew nothing about Human culture and their slang.

They continued on through the town, Eva getting eyed by Human soldiers everywhere she went. She was confused, the Human squad leader had said he had a Bloodhound, an Anthro, so how do they think she is different?

Then came what looked to be the final checkpoint, a large wall with a gate, all looking made of sheet metal that separated two streets. Guards were posted on the wall, and there was writing on the wall, it said "F.O.B. Charlie."

Eva heard low barking coming from the front of the group, and it became louder and louder until it came into view. A German Shepherd, on all fours, unevolved and feral, being led around on a leash by a Human.

Her mouth went agape, what kind of place was she in? Was this Hell? Or was this reality? Was her entire life before not real? She couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't anymore. 

The German Shepherd had finally made its way to her, and began to sniff her vigorously, but didn't seem to find what it was looking for.

"They're clear, send them to the X-ray," the Handler of the German Shepherd yelled. Eva and the other captured Anthros walked slowly through the gate, accompanied by their Human captors.

When they made it to the other side, another Human yelled "Clear!"

"You all can lower your hands," said the squad leader, and made the motion, much to the captives' relief. 

The group made their way deeper into the base, and Human activity grew more and more. Men prepping tanks, cleaning weapons, taking stock of captured arms. Some stopped what they were doing, and pointed at Eva, getting the attention of their fellow soldiers. 

Their faceplates hid their expressions, but Eva knew they had looks of confusion, curiosity, and disgust. The last one angered her, disgust. How could these Humans think she was disgusting? She was their superior, no matter how well equipped they were. Human men would kill each other to have her as a wife in the State, even if the choice was up to her.

They finally stopped in the center of town, which acted as a landing zone for their transports and the HQ, telling by what she thought were aircraft in the middle of a field and prefab metal buildings with comms equipment laid about them.

The captured were being sorted, one group dressed in civilian attire, and another that wore military uniforms. Eva looked on in dismay, she feared what these Humans would do to them, what horrors would be inflicted, while she was unable to stop them.

Eva was then forcefully pushed out of line, and to her knees, a pair of boots came into her line of sight as she faced the ground. She looked up to face an unmasked Human. A man with eyes as green as emerald, and hair brown like the soil. He would've made a handsome trophy husband in the State. 

He wore a beige trenchcoat, and his uniform was gray underneath, all tightly fitting, she could see the handgun in the inner right pocket of the trenchcoat.

"Good afternoon," the Human said almost pleasantly, looking down on her. "You must be the new species Sergeant Reeds said he found." 

"I ain't new, roach." Eva spat.

"Maybe not new here, but new to us. Now do you need help getting up or can you do it?" The Human asked condescendingly, and opened a hand to her. She grabbed it with her right hand and was hoisted up. As she rose, she quickly reached into his coat and grabbed his handgun, aiming it at his face.

In a flash, the Human's hand grabbed onto the barrel as she pulled the trigger, the upper mechanism stopped dead in its tracks. Eva was in shock. A kick to the stomach brought her back into reality, as she let go of the gun and fell to her knees again, whining.

The Human leaned down, grabbed her head, and yanked on it to face him; he aimed his gun at her lower jaw. She winced, and looked him dead in the eyes. "I've been trained to fight things even your fucking nightmares are scared of, you're gonna have to be quicker than that, subhuman. If you do that again, I'll blow your fucking jaw off and rub one out down your Goddamn neck, you understand?" 

Eva growled at him, and he pushed the gun onto her jaw harder. "All you gotta do is say 'yes.'"

"Yes." Eva said through a growl.

"Hmmm," hummed the Human. "I'll take it, but next time no attitude, or you'll get a beating. You may get up now." 

Eva rose along with the Human, who placed his gun in a holster on his side. He put it in his coat on purpose, he wanted her to go for it, this was all a game for him. 

To her surprise, he was as tall as her, with two similarly sized Humans flanking him. They had armor similar to the ones who found her, but with blue visors, a different insignia on the left arm, a blue streak along their arms, and finally text on their right breastplate that read 'SENTINEL.'

"Now, let's start again," the Human said. "I'm Agent Paul Harper, Federal Department of Anomalies, and you are?"

"Colonel Eva Graham, Armed Forces of the Anthrostate." She replied begrudgingly.

The Human huffed, "'Anthrostate' you say? Cute name, never encountered them yet. Hope I didn't just kick off a war."

Eva growled, and bared her teeth. "You already have." The two Humans behind Harper took aim at Eva.

"Prep her for transport, I want to interrogate her on the command ship." Harper told them, and walked off.

"Yes, sir," came from what sounded like four distorted voices. Her arms were quickly cuffed behind her back by someone behind her, and a soldier brought what looked like a small metal cage that looked like a cylinder. They put it over her face, she couldn't open her maw now.

They brought her to a smaller aircraft than the ones the other Anthros were being herded onto, and they attached her to a side wall, with metal clasps holding her legs, torso, and neck. It was uncomfortable as her hands and the cuffs stabbed into her back. 

She was held there for a while, while a group of ten soldiers with the blue visors; she assumed were Harper's men, entered the aircraft. 

Eventually Harper got on and went to the cockpit, not even giving Eva a passing glance. "All on board, take us to the Will of Steel." 

"Wilco," came from what Eva assumed was the pilot. The ramp lifted up and enclosed the craft. She felt sick as they lifted off, she never got on aircraft often, especially whatever this one was, because it certainly didn't feel like it took off like a plane.

Other than some heavy turbulence, the aircraft was dead silent, the soldiers sat down and inspected each other's bullpup rifles along with their armor. Harper had taken a seat across from Eva, staring at her, studying her. The rage grew inside her, she wished to give him a piece of her mind.

Harper pulled out a small box from his coat, opened it, popped a white capsule in his mouth, and chewed. Gum, no doubt. Though Eva thought it could've been something entirely different, these Humans had all kinds of toys and gadgets the State could only wish to have, so that could've been a stimulant for all she knew.

"You know, you remind me of a kind of specimen we've been hunting for centuries," Harper said, and the attention of the soldiers was now all on him, Eva included. "The Cynocephali tribes."

"Didn't we hunt them to extinction in the twenty-one tens, sir?" A soldier asked.

"We think, er, we hope." Harper replied.

"They only take the form of Wolves, right?" Asked another.

"They can take the form of almost any canine mixed with man, if history is to be believed." Said Harper, a mint smell now filled the cargo hold, it was definitely gum he was chewing. "But who knows, considering this subject isn't tribal, taking into consideration what she told me, we're probably dealing with a whole new beast."

"Sir, we're ready to dock, they want the password so we can," the pilot said.

Harper got up and walked over, and Eva heard him say "The creatures that hide in the darkness shall be dragged into the light."

Another voice, this one almost robotic, said, "Permission granted, Agent Harper. Prepare for docking procedure, containment units and medical personnel on standby." They were docking? Docking on what? You can't dock an aircraft.

The soldiers all got out of their seats, and one pressed a few buttons on the wall next to Eva. The section of the wall popped off, and it was revealed that her section of the wall was a dolly.

The aircraft rattled, and came to a stop, after a moment, the ramp dropped, and she was carted off of the aircraft into a very large room. It was a solid steel gray coloring, and there were various craft hung on the ceiling with catwalks surrounding them, and some aircraft were on the ground. Flight crews ran about maintaining them, refueling them, and installing weapons. 

Eva was immediately surrounded by an entourage of men, some more soldiers, and others looked to be doctors, studying her physical appearance. A little voice in the back of her head told her she should fear these men. They are likely going to cut her up, experiment on her, but she'd be damned if she let them. 

The large group passed through various corridors, filled with soldiers and crewmen of various professions. They were now entirely men that Harper could command, none of the red visored men. Speaking of, Harper now was in lead talking with a doctor, Eva tried to listen in as best she could with the clanking of the soldier's armor and their stomping on the metal floor.

"We have to run medical tests on the subject first, Field Agent. I understand the need to get information, but we have to make sure it isn't putting any lives at risk by merely existing, including yours." The doctor explained, in an eastern European accent. 

"Fine, Minsky, but make it snappy. First case I've had in a while."

"Don't worry, it shouldn't take long. We'll have it brought to interrogation within the hour."

"You better," Harper said, and turned off into another corridor, a few soldiers following.


###->CHAPTER 4: Invasive Screening<-

Eva was carted into a solid white room, with various medical equipment, or what she assumed was medical equipment, all around the room. An examination table laid in the middle, it was a flat, stainless steel surface. 

More doctors were here now, and most of the soldiers had left, spare a few who posted themselves around the room. Two doctors approached Eva, carrying a device made of glass with metal surrounding it, something was projected onto the device. Their faces were concealed by a face shield and a cap, just like the rest.

"I am doctor Anthony Peeters," said the one on the right, then motioned to the doctor on his left. "And this is my colleague, doctor James Sullivan." Sullivan gave a meek wave. "We are going to remove your muzzle so this isn't a one sided conversation."

A soldier removed the muzzle from her maw, which allowed her to lick up saliva that accumulated on her droopy features. The neck restraint was removed and something was placed around her neck, it pricked her when it was fully on.

"What did you put on my neck?" Eva asked, eliciting surprised gasps from the crowd of doctors.

"J-ust a s-shock coll-collar," The doctor known as Sullivan said, but not in a voice of fear, he sounded rather calm. Eva let out a low growl.

"Please excuse my colleague, he has a slight speech impediment, he's not much of a talker anyways." Explained Peeters. "Anyways, we placed the collar on you because it's standard procedure, and so we're on the same page, we're going to give you a taste of its capability." 

"Wait!" Eva cried. Then, there was a beep, then shock to her neck. Her entire body went slack, she couldn't move, couldn't speak either. After a moment or two, she raised her head to meet the two doctors, her breathing had quickened, adrenaline pumped. "W-what the fuck?"

"That was a test at max setting, here's it at fifty percent power." Peeters said blankly, and tapped on his glass device. The beep sounded again and Eva felt a light zap, but within a second it felt like all of her muscles were on fire. She struggled in her restraints for at least a minute, riling in pain.

When she stopped, Peeters spoke up. "This was merely a demonstration, you will be shocked multiple times in a real scenario. Now, we are going to release you of all restraints, and allow you to stand for a few moments, do you understand?" 

Eva huffed, and the restraints were all off, everything but the cuffs, but a soldier out of her sight quickly took them off. She stood, and stretched.

"Strip please." Peeters said flatly.

"What!?" Eva roared through a growl. A soldier aimed his rifle at Eva.

"Strip. I will not repeat myself." Peeters warned.

"No!" She yelled. Then there was a beep, and a zap, she dropped to the floor. Three soldiers rushed over and began to undress her. She could feel their cold metallic gloves as they began to remove the articles of clothing underneath her uniform. She felt them grope her a few times, mainly on her breasts, but one got brave and felt up her crotch, even put a finger in and pumped a few times. The three men giggled in that horrible distortion.

They threw her clothes into a bin and went back to their posts. After another moment, Eva was just barely able to get up, and immediately covered her intimate areas with her hands. Eva felt humiliated, and a bit scared. With the collar locked onto her, she couldn't do anything against her captors, at least until she could find a way to stop it.

"Excuse them, women aren't allowed in the Federation military, nor its vessels. That's the only action they're getting for a while." Peeters explained, brushing it aside as if it was a normal occurrence, just like the State did. "Move to the examination table please."

Eva hobbled over, struggling to make her legs move, and laid down. Restraints were placed on her wrists and ankles, effectively gluing her to the table. Then the tests began.

They cut off a patch of fur, a piece of skin, put cotton swabs in her nose and mouth, they even put a breast pump on her, but got nothing, all it did was arouse her, much to her embarrassment. The Humans didn't notice though, so she tried to keep composure. She couldn't show weakness.

Sullivan asked her various medical questions, her height, current weight, if she took any medication, that kind of thing. Though the question of frequency of sex made her feel uncomfortable. The truth was she did have intercourse, with one of the many Human prisoners in the work camp she supervised. She lied and said she didn't, out of fear of retribution. 

The last question Sullivan asked was about her various injuries. He had spotted a swollen eye, signs of various bruises on her body, and he even had to patch up a small cut on her abdomen. She told him she was fine, she'd walk it off. Then Sullivan asked Peeters to check if everything was done.

"Well, let's see," Peeters said, looking through his metal and glass tablet. "Oh, we forgot to take sexual fluids. I'm not doing it though, I did it last time." Eva's eyes widened, they were going to go all the way this time?

"N-not me." Sullivan said. "Y-you st-ill owe me." 

"Any volunteers?" Peeters yelled into the crowd of medical personnel. Someone in the back stepped forward, and came over to the table.

"I'll do it," he said, a hint of eagerness in his voice. Everyone in the room looked at him, in those trademark blank stares. "Better to get it done and over with." He explained with a nervous laugh.

"Do you know how to stimulate it?" Peeters asked.

The unknown doctor looked at Eva's nethers. "I don't really know how I'd do it to one that isn't a Human genitalia, but I'll try." 

"Very well, all you have to do is stimulate, I wouldn’t bring her to completion though, or nobody's gonna sit with you in the mess." Peeters half joked. 

Eva's breathing quickened and her eyes widened as his hand went out of sight. Her breathing hitched when she felt two fingers go in, then out. The doctor brought his two fingers into view, in a blue glove slick with fluids. 

Eva whined, and couldn't feel more embarrassed than she already did, she couldn't hide her arousal from the soldier or the pump anymore, not even to herself.

He gave another nervous laugh, "Looks like I don't have to go all the way, cotton swabs please." 

The doctors took their sample and started to clean up and run tests on the samples, leaving her on the table. The soldiers had left their posts and gathered around her. There were five of them in total. They all stared silently, waiting for someone else to start the conversation.

"Is it weird to wanna fuck it?" Whispered one, his distorted voice was at a higher pitch than the ones she heard before, likely a young recruit.

"I look at it this way, newbie, you can get to third base without even buying her a drink." Whispered another. The younger soldier looked away from the group, embarrassed.

"Don't be hard on yourself, I don't think you're the first. Rumor is that it's pretty common. Just don't tell anyone, you know it's against regs." A third added. Eva didn't like the sound of that, stuck in a facility full of sex starved Human soldiers who can do as they please with her, as long as they kept it a secret. She whined at the thought.

"Alright boys, enough teasing her," came a fourth distorted voice, the deepest she had heard from all the Humans so far, with a country drawl. "Boss just radioed me, he wants us to prepare her for transport." They put her back on the dolly, but kept the neck restraint off.

"What about my clothes?" Eva asked.

"They told us not to give them to you," The leader told her.

"I. Want. Them. Back." Eva growled.

"Tough. Shit." The leader shot back.

Then, the sliding doors at the far end of the room opened, and in came Harper. "It's been an hour and a fucking half! Are you finished sexually assaulting the subject?" Sarcasm dripped from his outburst. The group of soldiers, all but the young one, laughed amongst themselves.


###->CHAPTER 5: Good Cop, Bad Cop<-

Eva was carted out of the medical room, back into the gray steel hallway, the entourage now being only six men strong. Harper, and his men. 

As they passed through, Eva looked at the walls, now increasingly filled with propaganda posters mainly glorifying five things: the "Federation," Humanity, God, their military, and someone named Kowalski. A man with blue eyes and ginger hair, wearing a three piece black suit. Eva surmised he was their leader.

They passed by many people on the way to their destination. Most averted their eyes away from Eva, some stared intently. She began to feel uncomfortable again, she couldn't stand them staring her down.

She was soon brought through a sliding door. The room was dark and barren, all but a single large chair in the middle, and some boxes in the back she couldn't make out. Her restraints were released, and she fell to the ground abruptly.

"Sit in the chair, if you will." Ordered Harper, Eva complied, and her wrists were automatically restrained on the armrests. "Good Girl, doing exactly as I asked."

"Because I have no choice," Eva spat.

"No, because you're afraid. Afraid of that little collar 'round your neck." Harper chuckled.

"I'm not afraid of you, roach, or this stupid collar, your lackeys neither!" 

"Fool yourself all you want, but you're not fooling me."

"Let me out of this, and take this collar off, then we'll see." Eva growled. Harper's eyes looked dead into hers, his gaze was apathetic. He put on a pair of black leather gloves.

Harper sighed. "So what was this Anthrostate you spoke of?" Eva said nothing, only turning her gaze away from him. "Oh don't pretend like you've suddenly grown up some courage again, I saw how defeated you looked on that infirmary floor." 

Eva kept her gaze away from him, she tried to look at anything but him. Harper then stomped closer, and grabbed her chin, his gaze now met hers again.

"What. Is. The. Anthrostate?" Harper asked again. 

"A place where you'd make a good trophy husband for me." She smiled. She received a right jab to the eye.

"I want an actual answer." Harper said.

Eva thought she could get the upper hand wordwise on him now. "That is an actual answer, roach. It's the truth. What, can't imagine such an 'inferior' parading you around as a prize?" 

A frown now broke Harper's apathetic visage. He reached into his trenchcoat, and retrieved a whistle. 

Eva giggled. "You think a whistle is gonna make me talk, humie?"

Then Harper blew into it, and Eva heard a deafening squeal, even began to feel light headed. This went on for a full two minutes. Eva gave Harper a determined look.

"Huh, guess we'll have to get physical." Harper said, walking past Eva to the boxes in the back. When he came back, he carried a nightstick.

"Still don't wanna talk?" Harper asked, and Eva shook her head. "Your choice."

Harper swung the nightstick at her, the first strike landing on her snout with incredible force, causing blood to pour out of her nose. A stab to the abdomen, then a hit to the throat to finish it, causing her to gag and cough.

"That's it?" Eva asked him through her coughing fit, he responded by pressing that same button she saw before and stabbed her in the chest with the nightstick.

She shook violently, her muscles seized, she couldn't even scream out in pain this time, it felt like there was a lump in her throat. Her mouth stuck open, she began to drool. 

Then Harper hit her again with the nightstick, and just kept hitting her. "Just. Fucking. TALK!" He said through his strikes. Blood, saliva, sweat, and tears flew in the air.

Eventually, he stopped. Eva felt the tears build up, her vision became watery, she sniffled. Eva leaned down, trying to block her face from Harper. He had gone out of sight for a moment, and now he was back. He had a flogger, its metal ends cut into razor teeth.

"C'mon, I can do this all day, all you have to do is comply, and you won't get hurt." Harper warned. 

All Eva did was babble. Harper took this as non-compliance, and whipped her left arm, every time the flogger struck she yipped or howled, and jumped in her seat, in a fruitless attempt to get out.

Harper moved to her right. "Defiance is futile, I assure you that you'll do as I want, one way, or another." Eva used all of her energy to hold back the tears rather than yield. This caused what happened on her left arm to happen on the right.

Eva was barely coherent now, she couldn't keep her eyes open. She heard the soldiers and Harper discussing something, but she couldn't hear them, it was muffled to her. Then, it faded to black.

Eva awoke to a sweet smell, and soreness all over her body. It almost smelled like the cookies her grandmother made. She opened her eyes to find herself in a small room, a cell. She checked herself, her arms had been mended with gauze and bandages, but she was still completely nude.

The next thing that caught her attention however was the smell that woke her. It laid on the floor just next to her. A bunch of crackers, shaped like bones, had been left there. She got on the floor, next to the treats, and picked up the note first, it read:

"Dear Eva,
If you can read this, I'm Tommy. You heard the other guys call me the 'newbie' back in the infirmary probably. Anyways, me and the guys are assigned to guard you, and we feel your well-being is our responsibility. Take these treats as an apology for the conduct of our CO. We hope this does not offend you, as these are dog treats we have from the kennel on board, and thought you'd like them considering your biology. Finally, there is at least one of us posted outside your door at any time, feel free to talk to us, we can hear you.

Yours, Tommy and the rest of Echo Squad"

Eva didn't take a second thought and began engulfing the treats, she hadn't eaten for at least a day at this point. As long as it was edible. The treats were fairly good, or maybe that was the partial starvation talking.

As she ate, she checked her surroundings. It was pretty bland, the same gray steel as the corridors. Her cot was connected to the wall, and was closest to the tinted sliding glass door that served as the entrance. In a corner of the room adjacent to the door on the ceiling was a camera, a red flash came from it every so often.

On the opposite side of the door, there was a window replacing the wall itself, facing the outside. Eva couldn't believe what she was staring at. Outside she could see a planet, but it certainly wasn't Earth. Some parts were yellowish, some gray, and some white. From time to time there would be flashes all over the surface, the intervals at random.

Above the planet was what looked like thousands of craft, the sizes varied. Eva thought about it for a moment. This was space, all of these vessels were likely Human or allied to them at the least, and the "Anthros" She encountered weren't Anthros. The State doesn't even exist, nor Anthros, if Harper's questioning is anything to go by.

Eva's eyes watered. Escape was unlikely, and even if she did, where would she go? These Humans could be the dominant force wherever she was, nobody would take her in for fear of retribution. She laid back onto her bed, put her face into the small pillow she had, and cried.
