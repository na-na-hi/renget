>Be Anon, a travelling handyman
>Going where I so please, doing odd jobs in any town or village I stumble across to find a place to stay, food, and money
>Enjoying the freedom it lent me
>After a few months of backpacking from town and city alike, I come across my next destination
>A rather large anthro village
>Larger than most, but smaller than most human cities I've come across
>the village was a very boisterous and lively place full of anthros of different races and creeds living together
>Far more industrious that one might expect
>The streets were lined with smooth clay huts of various sizes and intricate designs
>Had various features such as shops, food courts, a village square and a grand library
>Despite the distinct culture clash of different anthro races, people for the most part all seemed to get along fine
>However, it wouldn't be long before I was reminded rather quickly, that humans were a contentious subject
>Some anthros didn't mind them
>Others appeared to be afraid of them
>Others still hated them
>I had arrived rather late in the day, having planned on buying a couple things to help me in my work, then retiring to an inn for the night
>Stopped by a local shop to purchase some tools for my work
>The shopkeeper was an old goat in the most literal sense who refused me service
>I was about ready to simply give up, when a woman spoke up from behind
>"Cornelius, if his money's good, what does it matter? Sell him the goods."
>I turn around to find what appeared to be a young female canine wearing a dark blue stitched up robe adorned with a red 'H', with a hood covering her face
>The goat man seemed indignant at the suggestion, but once he saw who was talking, caught himself
>"Oh. It's you. Ugh. This is the last thing I need for business. Fine. Just take it and leave, the both of you."
>Despite his attitude, she thanked the man, and gestured to the materials.
>"There you are sir. I apologize for his rude behavior."
>As we make our way out of the store back onto the village streets I thank her for the help, and ask what her name is
>She unveils herself revealing her glossy golden fur and soft ears that frame her delicate muzzle. Her deep violet eyes shimmered brightly
>"My name is Illiyana. A pleasure to meet you." She spoke with a warm softness
>I explain to her why I'm here, and her eyes light up at the news
>"I see. Truly this must be a fated meeting indeed." she said with a knowing smile. "It just so happens I'm in need of a few projects around my home that I've had trouble with lately. If you haven't found a place to stay while you're here, you could stay with me while you work. It's a bit out of the way, but I'll be sure to compensate you properly for a job well done."
>I didn't want to impose on a stranger so suddenly, but she insisted that I stay with her
>It had already become rather late and was quite tired from the journey
>We made our way to her home, apparently on the far outskirts of the village, just beyond its borders
>As we walked through the streets, I did notice we were drawing quite a number of stares
>People were murmuring various things out of earshot, but I simply chalked it up to them having not had a human visitor in some time
>I chatted with Illiyana as we walked, to learn more about the jobs she needed done, herself, and the village
>Illiyana worked as an apothecary, while occasionally moonlighting as what I can only describe as a mystic of sorts
>She had a very quiet and mysterious air about her, but she seemed kind
>As for the village, it hadn't been around for a terribly long time, only a couple generations, but while it borrowed some aspects of human life, for the most part it was intent on developing its own sort of culture 
>It was led by a chief and a royal order comprised of the former chief and various representatives and royal houses of sorts
>And for the work she had, she wanted to expand her garden that she takes herbs and the like from for her work 
>She would like me to clear away some of the shrubbery behind her house and build a new reinforced garden 
>We made it back to her hut, which was small, but very cozy
>It was comprised of two stories with a single bedroom up top, and a bathroom, kitchen, living room, and a tiny lab where she would brew healing concoctions and ointments
>she laid out a large soft mat and bedding for me to use in the living room
>Tired after the long day, I set my travelling gear and work supplies off to the side and lay down for the night so that I might be ready to work in the morning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>The next day, I woke up to the smell of something delicious
>Illiyana was in her small kitchen cooking up breakfast
>"Good morning, Anon. I hope you slept well. Give me just a moment, breakfast will be ready soon."
>I thank her again for all that she's done for me, and how I was ready for work as soon as we were done eating
>"Think nothing of it. It does get rather lonely out here, so I'm very appreciative of the company myself. Here you go."
>Her cooking was amazing, and I made sure to let her know
>Her knowing eyes sparkled with my words, and despite it being covered, I could distinctly tell her tail was wagging under her robe
>After eating, I picked up my tools and went out back into the garden to start my work
>Time flew as I worked away in the back, and every couple of hours Illiyana would service a customer of her own
>I'd made decent progress clearing away the space, but I still needed more raw materials to begin construction
>I stepped inside to speak with Illiyana and explain the situation
>"I see." She nodded. "Well, I'm afraid the only place to buy that with any convenience is back on the main shopping streets of the village."
>Bearing that in mind, I told her I intend to buy the rest of the materials today and continue work tomorrow, since I'd have to carry it all so far
>She quickly recommended that I utilize her small pull wagon that she takes with her into the village whenever she does her own shopping
>As she went to fetch it, I brought up the question of why she decided to move so far from the village in the first place
>She was well beyond it's normal borders, to the point where if something were to happen to her, it would take some time for the village guard to show up and help
>"I... am a bit of a shut-in, I suppose." she said casually. "I enjoy my privacy and you don't really get that in such a village. People talk, you know."
>I get that. I enjoy my own space as well, but I bring up the matter of safety, and even that her customers have to travel so far to meet her
>But she simply shushed my questions and hurried me off to the village, going on about having things to prepare for work tomorrow
>She wouldn't be able to accompany me this time, but she assured me that the construction shop-keep was much more amicable towards humans
>I should have no problems, so wagon in tow, I left
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>The village had generally grown quieter as it had gotten late, but the shopping district street was still bustling with a new night life
>Magical torches lit the lane as various anthros made their way through the area, clamoring about prices and the like
>It didn't take long before I found the material store I'd been looking for
>Just as Illiyana said, he was a nice man who got me what I needed without delay or issue
>As I was finalizing the details of the purchase, some anthro male sheep who were very clearly intoxicated were making their way through the street
>They stopped when they noticed me and began to speak amongst themselves
>"Oi bruv. Look! There IS one of 'em in the village, huh?" One bleated to the other
>"How bout that," the other chided. "Been a while since the last of their kind came through these parts."
>"See now, it’s probably the witch's doin, you know." The first sheep slurred.
>"I knew the Chief was too lenient on 'er. I knew it. She shoulda killed that broad when she had the chance. It's only a matter of time before they conquer us all, you know. First, they'll take our women. Then they won't stop 'til we're all bound and gagged in chains."
>Witch? Are they talking about Illiyana? 
>"D-Don't worry 'bout my friend 'ere. He's swamped." the sheep said...sheepishly. "You 'ave a good evenin’, mate. C'mon you git, before you get us roused." Said the other, before pulling his stumbling friend along into the crowd of people
>"I wouldn't pay those two much mind." Spoke the shop-shopkeeper. "However, well, as is the case with any small community, news spreads quickly, just as fast as rumors do."
>Curiosity got the better of me, and I asked what the shop keeper meant
>The shop-keep beckoned me close as he began to whisper.
>"That Illiyana girl? She does possess magical powers. It's supposedly what makes her such a good healer. But some say she also deals with dark magic, forbidden works here in the village."
>"That's why she was exiled beyond the border of the village."
>Exile?
>"And to be honest still, especially in your case, if you have some business with her, you should just about end it."
>Why is that? Just because of some unfounded rumor? Sure, she's been a bit secretive, but she's also been kind and hospitable, one of the few who have here
>"There's more." The shop-keep continued. "You've seen that 'H' that was stitched on her robe, right?" The shop-keep started again
>"that’s tells all who see her that she consorts with humans. They're her victims that she kidnaps and spirits away into her small hut so she can manifest her dark magics."
>Oh
>"Even if some anthros don't care for humans, it's still against the treaty we established with your nobles in the human cities and towns to bring harm to 'em. But since it's all been rumor without any real proof, the Chief simply decided to brand her with the mark and exile her to her own fate as opposed to killin' her or imprisoning her. I suppose it keeps humans out of our affairs that way."
>"I've got no ill will towards you, boy." The shop-shopkeeper said solemnly as he packed up the rest of the materials in the pull cart. "Be smart. Leave while you can."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>Great. Just great
>I travel all this way in hopes of finding work, well out of the normal human territory
>I think I find a nice, pretty anthro canid who was willing to give me room and board in exchange for some super basic construction
>Only my luck could lead me to a witch's den. Where all my shit is
>I finally make it back with the supplies, already starting to think of excuses as to why I have to leave when I'm greeted by Illiyana at the doorway
>"Welcome back." She said again wistfully "Thank you again for this. I hope you didn't have any trouble this time."
>I tell her that everything went fine, not mentioning what I had heard from the others back in the village
>"Wonderful. Just bring it all in and set it aside, dinner is ready, so run along and wash up." She said, walking back inside
>I tepidly followed her, and nonchalantly began searching for my traveling pack when I noticed it wasn't where I left it
>I ask Illiyana about it
>"Oh that?" she spoke from the kitchen. "I figure since you've been traveling for so long, your spare clothes must be quite filthy. I hope you don't mind but since I had some free time waiting for you to come back, I took the liberty of washing them up for you. You can collect it all tomorrow, alright?"
>Perfect...
>We sat down for dinner, and despite how good it smelled I didn't have much of an appetite
>After a moment, I realized she was watching me rather intently
>"Is everything alright, anon?" She started. "You've hardly touched your meal."
>I play it off as being nothing, and start to dig in
>Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. I mean, some village gossip about someone who just likes their space isn't grounds to stop trusting them
>"Are you sure?" She cocked her head to the side. "Did perhaps something happen at the market?"
>Much harder to play off my nerves now
>"It is as I said," She continued. "In a small village, people do like to talk." She mused. "But you shouldn't believe all that you hear." She said, giving me that knowing smile again
>Maybe it was all just gossip. But it's not like I'm the only handyman on earth. She can find another
>After we'd finished dinner, Illiyana told me she would be up late working on some new aromatics and to get some rest for tomorrow
>Then she then bid me good night and excused herself to her lab room and closed the curtain behind her
>I lay in bed for but a moment as the words of the shopkeeper rang in my head yet again
>If I don't take this opportunity to get out now, I might not live to see another
>I slowly climb out of bed careful not to make a sound
>After checking to make sure Illiyana was in her lab, I begin creeping about the hut in search of my missing things
>I poked and prodded every nook and cranny, but it didn't seem like it was here on the first floor
>I tiptoed through the hallway and began making my way upstairs
>I move the privacy curtain to her room back, not sure what to expect, but I don't think anything could prepare me for what I found
>Luminous crystals lit the walls dimly with a faint reddish pink glow
>On her walls were a myriad of papers, ranging from human anatomy illustrations from medical journals, to human literature
>And scripts the likes of which I'd never seen before
>Strewn about many shelves that lined her walls were what I could only describe as false penises, true to human form and meticulously crafted out of strange material
>Along with collars, leashes, and other methods of bondage
>My heart sank as I accepted the rumors were true
>Illiyana was a witch, and I seemed like her next victim
>I saw my travel pack had been rutted through and left on the side of her bed, with my spare clothes covering the mattress
>I carefully investigated them, but it was clear they hadn't been washed
>On the contrary, it was as if my own natural musk was mingled deeply with Illiyana's distinct fragrance
>Alright. I've seen enough
>I begin quickly shoving my things into my pack, when the glint of the glowing crystals near her the head of her bed catches my eye
>Beneath them, lay a small book sitting on a nightstand
>...I should go
>There's really no time
>Just grab my things and get the hell out of here
>....
>So, I pick up the journal, expecting to see magic sigils and perhaps human skin working as a makeshift bookmark
>Only to find what appears to be declarations of love and devotion?
>Ramblings about how some sort of grand master race is her one true love and how she's attempting to lure a master to-
>"Someone has been poking around where they don't belong~" I heard from behind.
>The crystals lining the room all flickered suddenly, turning a deep purple
>I spun around quickly, sending the journal tumbling to the floor to find Illiyana standing in the doorway, wearing her loose fitting robe that barely dangled around her arms
>I froze up as I was confronted with her
>"But I assure you, I am not mad." She said, reaching down to collect her journal. "I was waiting for the right opportunity to make my move, but it looks like now will have to do..."
>Having been caught, I instinctively back away and inform her that I didn't mean to pry, and don't want any trouble, just to leave
>"I'm sorry, Anon." she said sincerely. "But it's been faaar too long since I've had a human come through the village, and I simply can't let you leave."
>She began closing the distance between us
>I ask if it's all true, telling her what I'd learned at the market
>She listened quietly, taking in every word
>"Hmm. I see." She pondered. "Terrible gossips this village has."
>She paused in her approach, and began pacing around the room
>"What you heard was true. I was exiled from the greater community of the village. And I do study some arts that some consider...unnatural."
>She stepped closer still, her eyes seemingly flickering with a what I could only describe as a wild desire burning deep within her
>I continued to back away until I bumped up against her nightstand
>"However, that is not the whole truth." She said, gesturing to the 'H' on her robe. "You were told that I try to capture humans in order to practice my magic? Hardly."
>"This 'H' symbolizes one who WORSHIPS humans." She clarified, taking one of the false penises off the shelf and caressing it lovingly "Believes them to be the ultimate master race, and wants nothing more than to please them."
>I'm sorry, what?
>Illiyana lowers her arms as her robe slides away from her breasts, falling to the floor and completely exposing herself under the waves of purple light filling the room
>She stood there, trembling as I took her body all in
>Her modestly sized breast heaved with each deep breath she took, her pointed nipples tasting the cool air
>the force of her tail wagging made her hips sway back and forth, and between her legs was a matted mess of glistening golden fur
>Droplets of clear liquid fell in rivulets and dripped upon the ground
>I was so taken aback by the whole experience, I couldn't breathe
>After a what felt like an eternity, I looked Illiyana in the eyes only to find this desperate, lusting face as she inhaled sharply
>She finally closed the distance between us and pressed her warm muzzle against my lips stealing a kiss
>It started as a peck, but quickly turned into a sloppy, needy make-out session
>"I'm sorry" She gasped breathlessly as her tongue dove into my mouth, filling it with the wet sensation of her saliva "I've been wanting to do this since I first saw you in the village."
>I wasn't sure what to do
>I wasn't sure what to say
>But some part of me felt that what she said was true. It certainly looked to be the case
>And I can admit...she was attractive
>My body began responding to her aggressive advances
>And I suppose that was all the reasoning I needed
>I returned her embrace, clasping the small of her back drawing her hips close
>Our tongues were now battling for dominance as my hands moved south around her plump cheeks, the soft fur from her tail tickling my knuckles as it feverishly wagged back and forth
>Illiyana wrapped her arms around my neck, as if she weren't willing to let me go
>In our fierce make-out session, we tumbled onto her bed
>Illiyana raised herself up as she sat on my lap, and began tugging at my shirt
>Once she'd gotten it off, she took a deep sniff, and her tail began wagging furiously
>"Mmm...yes. This smell..." she whispered "This damned aroma has completely captivated me!"
>Tossing it to the floor, she rolled over and slipped her hands into the band of my pants
>"But I am sure it's even more intense down here, isn't it Anon~?"
>I work with her to pull them off, and my cock springs out
>Illiyana's eyes lit up as she wiggles closer, taking it into her delicate paws
>"Oh heavens..." She whispered. "Humans are truly something else!"
>She watches it's every move as it throbs and bounces, her warm ragged breathing assaulting the tip
>"May I?" She asks, only barely able to contain herself
>I pet her on the head and give her permission
>Without hesitation, she begins servicing me with all her heart
>She laps at the length, before sloppily slurping on the tip
>Her long tongue slithers down my shaft as she begins greedily swallowing the entirety of my cock
>My own breathing begins to speed up, and I pull her away before I can cum
>She still desperately fiending for another taste, her tongue laps at the sensitive head even more
>I slip a hand under her throat and give her behind a smack instructing her to calm down
>I can feel her moan escaping her throat at the sensation, and she meekly apologizes
>"Ah. Forgive me," She says "But I can hardly contain myself..."
>Her tail continues wagging the entire time, and I tell her to spin around so that her ass is facing me
>She complies, straddling my chest with her hands continuing to stroke my member
>In front of my face my nose is assaulted by her feminine musk, with a dainty little asshole puckering up above
>I use my hands to pry apart her dripping sex to see her pink lips quivering with droplets
>"Ahh...~" Illiyana squeaks. "Please don't stare so intently...it's embarrassing."
>The smell of this horny bitch awakens a deep primal urge within me
>I call out that it should be embarrassing, with how desperate she looks
>She apologizes again, but I cut her off by diving into her sex with my tongue
>She lets out a surprised yip before switching to another lustful moan
>"Wait Anon, don't! It's dirty down there!" She cries
>Despite this, she's grinding onto my face as I eagerly slurp down the streams of love juice now oozing from her
>My hands sink into her ass cheeks, the soft fur giving way to her warm flesh
>It doesn't take much before I feel her tense up on top of me
>"Anon! Oh gracious, I'm cumming!" she cried, her tail wagging above my head
>Another deluge of her tart juices came squirting forth
>"M-Master, this isn't right." She managed to mewl out, "I'm the one who is supposed to make you feel good..."
>Illiyana herself went back to salivating on my now painfully erect cock, as I could feel the head sliding against the slippery insides of her mouth before slithering into the back of her throat
>I pulled myself away from her pussy, and flipped her over onto the side of the bed next to me
>I got up and scanned her room for something, while Illiyana watched restlessly, her hand slowly massaging her wet crotch
>"What is it, anon?" she asked impatiently, eager to continue
>Found it
>One of the collars she had on the shelf, and a nice short leash
>I settle back on the bed, towering over her as she lay against the pillows she had propped up against the wall
>I bring up what I'd read, and what she said
>About wanting to find a master to serve
>How she believed humans were superior, and she wanted to serve us
>And how if that were the case, I could claim her as my own follower, and she shouldn't have any objections, right?
>I place the collar around her neck and give the leash a tug
>Illiyana's eyes tear up briefly before clasping the hand I held the leash in
>She leaned in close to my chest
>"Yes, yes!" She whispered. "I've waited so long for someone like you. I knew it was fate when we met, I just knew it!"
>I wound the leash around my knuckles until we were face to face, bringing her in forcefully for a kiss
>This time, there was no battle for domination, as I wretched her muzzle open and probed deep into her warm mouth
>When I pulled away this time, Illiyana was breathless and panting heavily
>She flipped onto her back, her tits bouncing as she did, and wriggled her hips
>"Please Anon. Master!" She cooed. "Let me fulfill my duty as your follower! Please, breed me!"
>I line myself up to her drooling slit, teasing it ever so slightly before inching forward
>She breathes in deeply as I slip further and further inside the inviting walls of her pussy
>The only resistance I'm met with is her overwhelming tightness
>After a couple tense seconds, I bottom out and have to regain my composure
>Once I have, I begin to move
>The entire time, Illiyana's face is twisted with pleasure
>Gone is the calm, mysterious persona she put up before
>Now she's nothing more than a bitch in heat, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, completely unable to keep herself from moaning
>Illiyana's insides wrapped around me completely, the folds of her sex stroking the whole of my cock
>With each deep thrust, I knock on her womb, and the desire to mate with this woman compels me to rut even harder
>I assault her breasts, giving each a firm squeeze with my free hand before pulling her nipple between my knuckles
>She cries in pain, but that too gives way to another moan, her hands grabbing at the bed beneath her
>I begin to berate her slovenly appearance, to my own surprise
>She tries to apologize as I speed up my thrusts
>"I'm sowwy!" She cries "I'm showwy you have to see me like dish, Mashter!" 
>Soon nothing can be heard in the quiet small room except the wet smacks of raw mating and the desperate gasps of the bitch being bred
>I feel it coming now
>I tell Illiyana that I'm about to cum, and that I plan on doing it in the deepest part of her
>Her hands travel up to my chest as she gazes at me with her shining violet eyes
>"Yes, please master..." She moans. "Grace me with your child. I'll take it all."
>The thought of potentially knocking up this lustful wild canine pushes me over the edge
>I thrust as deep as I can as the urge hits
>I can feel rope after rope surge forward into her tight little cunt
>I slowly come to a stop, our breathing beginning to slowly sync up
>My cock starting to soften, pops out of her now gaped pussy, still trembling as my cum begins to flow out and onto her sheets
>I let out a deep sigh, and fall over in bed next to her
>"After all this time..." Illiyana whispered, before wriggling under my arm into my chest. "I've finally found a dear master."
>Her fur smelled like a wonderful blend of different aromatics as I held her
>Now I was tired, well beyond tired
>If this were all some elaborate plot to get me to drop my guard, and I wake up without my kidneys...
>Still a damn good lay
>The twinkling stones upon the walls begin to fade into faint star-like dots of light as me and Illiyana drift off to sleep.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>The next morning
>I wake up to the sound of birds singing outside the window, with light shining through illuminating the room
>I was still in Illiyana's bed, now having been tucked under a clean sheet
>So, I guess what happened last night wasn't a dream
>The curtain in the doorway slipped to the side and in walked Illiyana, wearing one of my shirts and the collar from last night, and nothing else
>She was carrying a tray with breakfast on it, and she placed it on the bed besides me
>"Good morning, Master." She greeted me with her usual warmness. "I hope you slept well. I hope you don't mind my wearing you shirt. It's simply too comfortable."
>I tell her that it's fine, and then pause
>I wasn't really sure what to do from here
>I snuck in her room and read her private journal
>She's definitely a witch of some sort
>And we had some amazing sex last night
>Should I be worried? I should be worried, right?
>"Don't worry." Illiyana started. "I'm sure you have a lot of questions, and I would be more than happy to answer them if I can."
>First, I apologized for going through her stuff, but she didn't seemed concerned at all
>"Given what you heard, it makes sense."
>I then ask if what SHE told me was true as I begin eating
>"It is. I would never harm a human. They are the true masters of the world." She said, solemnly placing her hand over her heart "And I believe it is the place of all anthro-kind to worship at their feet as concubines, slaves and breeding sows."
>Alright. Very strong religious beliefs
>I ask if she would serve any human
>"Ah, well. Yes and no." She starts. "I have waited for some time for humans to make their way to the village, in order to find a master. But usually, they leave well before I can meet with them, thanks to the village's rude attitude towards humans. But now that I have a master, I will do only as you say. If you were to tell me to service every human male in a back alley pub, I would do it, for it is my master's order."
>Huh. So, you were serious last night, which wasn't just some elaborate roleplay?
>Illiyana looked a bit sad "I was. However, I cannot force you to be my master." She spoke. "If you do not want me, then that's that."
>Having such a devote follower was a rather big responsibility
>But Illiyana was kind, helpful, and an amazing fuck
>There's not much more I could ask for
>I say that I'm willing to give it a shot, if she'll have me
>Illiyana's eyes light up with sparkles, as she graciously nods her head
>"Thank you very much, master." she said sweetly. "I think you'll come to find you're a natural alpha when the urge comes on."
>She nudged me gently before leaning in and whispering
>"The way you treated me was fitting of a dominant male claiming what is rightfully his, don't you think?"
>I must admit, Even I wasn't sure what came over me
>I've fucked, but never quite like that
>But now many other questions began to float in my head
>Could I really stay in this village? How long would Illiyana want to stay? I could just force her to leave, but that feels a bit much...
>"And just think...I know I'm not the only one." She continued. "They might not realize it, but deep down, they would fall to their knees and serve you, as do I all the same."
>My interest is decidedly piqued
>"This village is full of anthro women who, with a little nudging could all be your followers. Your slaves. To do with as you please." Illiyana whispered.
>I swallow deeply at the thought, and could feel my cock hardening again
>"I'll help you, of course" she said, caressing me under the sheets
>"So, what do you say, Master? Are you interested?"
>...Well, it would be rude to just leave when there's so many new people to meet...
