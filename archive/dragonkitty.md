##Backstory
Korrina is an awkward girl that is not sure how relationships work, even after she was given everything she asked for by Arc she was still alone. Sometimes she thinks that she should have picked some of the boons that make making friends easier, but she didn't want to feel like she was cheating.
In the beginning, she worked at the adventurer's guild where she had to ignore the rude commentaries about her height and mixed-race until she manage to get some reputation for herself, however, she got bored because most of the loot was not cute enough for her and she always had to discuss with someone to get the jewelry.
One day, after finishing an adventure in the great wilds the fey were awfully nice to her, more than any other group of people have been to her in the "civilized" lands. At that moment she understood what she had to do if she helps the people of the wilds she can ask for stuff that she likes, like food and cute clothes, so that is what she did.
Years later she is liked and respected by various villages in the great wilds. The compliments went to his head and feed her ego, so she assume that everyone in the great wilds knows her and understand her deal with the people of the wilds.
She is still awkward and she still doesn't understand how relationships work, but at least she is having fun.
