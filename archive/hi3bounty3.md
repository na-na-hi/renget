Haha the game still uses the word "Bounty" if you go to sort the Weapons page in the Foundry. In most places it has been replaced with "Universal Mirage".

### Foundry costs

Crystalyte-based system.

Crystalyte have grades: G1, G2, and G3.

Crystalyte have types:
- Ice tower (Glacial Fences) stages drop Blue Crystalyte.
- Fire tower (Illuminated Land) stages drop Red Crystalyte.
- Lightning tower (Roaring Palace)  stages drop Purple Crystalyte.
- Phys tower (Blade Grave) stages drop Grey Crystalyte.

You may choose the tower to challenge, thereby choosing to farm only the desired type of Crystalyte.

These are the Stigmata forging costs. For a more complete list, please refer to your game. Yes, at the time of writing, G2 Stigmata Tesla Band and Planck do not have transmute path.
- | G1 direct | G2 direct | G2 transmute | G3 transmute
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
New mats cost | 190 G1 Crystalyte | 200 G2 Crystalyte | 125 G2 Crystalyte + G1 Stigma | 140 G3 Crystalyte + G2 Stigma
- | - | - | - | -
Blue Crystalyte | Nohime | Robert Peary | Robert Peary | Ana Schariac
Red Crystalyte | Higokumaru | Thales | Thales | (Leeuwenhoek?)
Purple Crystalyte | Nagamitsu | Monet | Monet | Ishikawa Goemon
Grey Crystalyte | Ekaterina | Michelangelo | Michelangelo | Dirac
- | - | - | - | -
_Fuel_ | 700 | 900 | 550 | 900
_Other mats_ | 80 Honkai Pieces + 150 SS Imaginon | 160 Purple Lens | 110 Purple Lens | 150 Red Lens

These are the Weapon forging costs. At the time of writing, Fenghuang Pinions is the only G2 Weapon.
- | G1 Weapon direct | G2 Weapon direct
-- | -- | --
_New mats cost_ | 190 G1 Crystalyte | 250 G2 Crystalyte
- | - | -
- | Pledge of Sakura | Fenghuang Pinions
- | - | -
_Fuel_ | 700 | 1200
_Other mats_ | 80 Honkai Pieces + 150 AE Imaginon or fewer | 200 Purple Lens

(Some G1 Stigmata cost 48 Honkai Pieces + 120 SS Imaginon or 60 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon; the number varies.)


### Farming (Towers)

Four towers as follows.
- Ice tower (Glacial Fences) stages drop Blue Crystalyte.
- Fire tower (Illuminated Land) stages drop Red Crystalyte.
- Lightning tower (Roaring Palace)  stages drop Purple Crystalyte.
- Phys tower (Blade Grave) stages drop Grey Crystalyte.

Each tower has six floors.

Each floor can be cleared in solo mode or in coop mode. The coop mode will only be unlocked after completing the solo mode once. After first clear of all the floors in solo mode, can pick whichever floor to farm.

10 Mirage Invites per week: 1 per day of the week, 1 extra on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. (There is a typo in the English translation that says Friday and Sunday only. It reads "週五至週日" in Chinese.) Each floor costs 1 Mirage Invite. The first clear of a floor in solo mode will not cost a Mirage Invite.

There are no material rewards for assists. If you are in assist mode, you will get nothing.

The rewards of floor clearing are as follows. The left side rewards are guaranteed. The right side rewards can be redeemed by spending Time Swirl Pass upon completing a floor.
Floor | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte | Spend Time Swirl Pass | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 4 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 50 to get | 21 | 9 | 0 | 0
2 | 4 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 60 to get | 24 | 14 | 0 | 0
3 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 70 to get | 28 | 7 | 5 | 0
4 | 5 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 80 to get | 32 | 0 | 10 | 0
5 | 5 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 90 to get | 36 | 0 | 6 | 4
6 | 6 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 100 to get | 40 | 0 | 0 | 9

Here is the normalized Time Swirl Pass payoff, i.e. the payoff on 100 Time Swirl Pass.
Floor | Fuel | G1 Crystalyte | G2 Crystalyte | G3 Crystalyte | Total Fuel if salvaging everything
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
1 | 42 | 18 | 0 | 0 | 60
2 | 40 | 23.33 | 0 | 0 | 63.33
3 | 40 | 10 | 7.14 | 0 | 64.29
4 | 40 | 0 | 12.5 | 0 | 65
5 | 40 | 0 | 6.66 | 4.44 | 66.6
6 | 40 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 67

### Value calculations - "Is it worth it?"

Not very rigorous; just to give you a sense. It's kind of moot to be super precise about value calculation, because the value of the basic resources themselves in this game fluctuate greatly depending on game progress; the topic of value in Honkai merits its own thesis of work. I think the below calculations are "good enough". You're welcome to suggest a better one.

One more note: the following is intended to calculate the price in terms of Time Swirl Pass; it deliberately omits the amount of mats you get for free for clearing the stages. If you take the cost in Time Swirl Pass and divide it by the weekly income of Time Swirl Pass, you will get a number of weeks longer than actual, since you get mats from simply clearing. In many weeks you will have spare attempts but not enough Time Swirl Pass to redeem for the additional rewards.


##### G3 Stigmata from 0

1 G3 Stigma = 3145.90 Time Swirl Pass + 160 Purple Lens + 150 Red Lens

Rough calculation:
1. Using Floor 5, 2100 Time Swirl Pass => 186.67 G2 Ghosts + 140 G3 Ghosts + 956.67 Fuel
2. Using Floor 4, 76.19 Time Swirl Pass => 13.33 G2 Ghosts + 35.24 Fuel
3. Using Floor 2 or 5, 969.71 Time Swirl Pass => 808.10 Fuel
4. In addition, need 160 Purple Lens and 150 Red Lens.


##### G2 Stigmata from 0

1 G2 Stigma = 1588.57 Time Swirl Pass + 160 Purple Lens

Rough calculation:
1. Using Floor 4, 1142.86 Time Swirl Pass => 200 G2 Ghosts + 528.57
2. Using Floor 2 or 5, 445.71 Time Swirl Pass => 371.43 Fuel
3. In addition, need 160 Purple Lens.


##### G1 Stigmata from 0

1 G1 Stigma = 1068 Time Swirl Pass + 80 Honkai Pieces + 150 SS Imaginon

(Some G1 Stigmata cost 48 Honkai Pieces + 120 SS Imaginon or 60 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon; the number varies.)

Rough calculation:
1. Using Floor 2, 518.18 Time Swirl Pass => 190 G1 Ghosts + 241.82 Fuel
2. Using Floor 2 or 5, 549.82 Time Swirl Pass => 458.18 Fuel
3. In addition, need 80 Honkai Pieces and 150 SS Imaginon


##### Reroll Devices

1 Reroll Device = 750 Time Swirl Pass

By farming Floor 6


##### Converting between Crystalyte and Fuel

You will likely need to convert Crystalyte to Fuel since Fuel is short.

1 G1 Crystalyte => 1 Fuel
1 G2 Crystalyte => 2 Fuel
1 G3 Crystalyte => 3 Fuel

I not recommend converting Fuel to Crystalyte because Fuel is more of a bottleneck.

100 Fuel => 25 G2 Crystalyte (1 G2 Crystalyte <= 4 Fuel)
100 Fuel => 14.29 G3 Crystalyte (1 G3 Crystalyte <= 7 Fuel)


### Income

Per week:
- 90 Time Swirl Pass for free (1 Asterite)
- 20 Time Swirl Pass for 160 Ranger Creds
- 56 Time Swirl Pass + 868 United Tokens for 56 Honkai Shards (buying the 4 Time Seal Boxes per day)
- 55.48 Time Swirl Pass + 651 United Tokens for 2940 United Tokens (buying the 3 Time Seal Boxes per day)
- Some fairly large amount from events

Per week total (no events):
221.48 Time Swirl Pass <= 160 Ranger Creds + 56 Honkai Shards + 1421 United Tokens

Per week total if you spend no United Tokens on Time Seal Boxes (no events):
166 Time Swirl Pass + 868 United Tokens <= 160 Ranger Creds + 56 Honkai Shards

The data on the contents of Time Seal Boxes is thanks to records by Toast#7009. Each Time Seal Box contains on average, 1.2 Time Structures and 31 United Tokens.

A [SWAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_wild-ass_guess) for Time Swirl Pass from events would be 350 Time Swirl Pass twice per patch, so 116.67 per week.


### Time horizon - "How long does it take?"

Here I will make some estimates using the cost of bounty equipment and the income of Time Swirl Pass.

You get 10 Mirage Invites per week. The amount of materials for simply clearing a floor is worth 25 to 40 Time Swirl Pass. It is closer to 25 for higher floors (required for G2, G3 Crysalyte), so I will just use 25.

I think it's a bad idea for beginners to use United Tokens on Time Seal Boxes because of how precious United Tokens are. I don't think bounty farming is that slow even without United Tokens, so I would prefer to spend early- to mid-game United Tokens on Honkai Cubes and Divine Keys.

Thus, the amount of bounty mats gained per week in "equivalent Time Swirl Pass" is:
- 166 Time Swirl Pass from income (no events)
- 250 Time Swirl Pass from 10 Mirage Invites
- 116.67 Time Swirl Pass from income (event only)


##### G3 Stigmata

Around 6 weeks each


##### G2 Stigmata

Around 3 weeks each


##### G1 Stigmata

Around 2 weeks each, or likely less time, since lower floors yield more mats for free


##### Reroll Devices

You can get around 4 and 1/4 Reroll Devices per patch if purely farming Reroll Devices.


### Questions? Something looks not right?

I hope this helped. :)

This took me a while to write, but I don't play this game full-time, so perhaps I overlooked something. Find me, Imy (ww#1234), on the Solstice armada [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UFU2k99WWR).
