>They are very shocked
>There are no humans in this world
>Aparently no one has seen humans in ages, but the stories of human being turned into pokemon to save the world are the same as on my world
>They begin to disscus my very nature in front of me, as if it were gossip.
>They decide that the best way for someone like me to do whatever he has to is to see the world and become a rescue or explorer team
