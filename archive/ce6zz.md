In the southeastern part of the region, a small village by the name of Ruthuns had a metaphorical dark cloud floating over it. It was an isolated place, surrounded on almost all sides by thick forest that was used for lumber. The only exceptions being the one long dirt path that leads towards larger towns, and the river the village was built beside. Being so far from others had its positives, namely being left alone and allowed to live as they pleased, but it also meant they had to deal with any problems that may arise on their own. And soon, a problem the villagers have been struggling to deal with were about to come to a head.

Inside the village head's home, a strange woman with long white hair and porcelain white skin was partaking in a meal. It was the highest quality that the village could provide to her, but her expression held clear contempt for it. If it weren't the only food around for who knows how far, she wouldn't dare eat it. The villagers of Ruthuns held a lot of pride in their work, so her attitude grated against everyone in the building. Her attitude and appearance were at odds with each other, pompous to a ridiculous degree, yet her hair looked unruly and unwashed and her dress was stained and tattered.

They were very hesitant to accommodate someone like her. She appeared out of nowhere, demanding everyone be awed by her arrival. Her appearance was clearly inhuman with her arms and legs of red bone and her bright red eyes. They would have tried to tie her up and burn her alive, but after a small glimpse into her abilities (burning down a shed with magic), the village head known it would be a bad idea to try. Instead, he tried to appease the demon woman.

"This food is terrible! And after I showed them so much mercy! These savages must have no clue about the concept of gratefulness or how to treat a lady properly."

As she continued to gripe to herself without any care about who was listening, the elderly village head held his tongue and spoke as politefully as he could.

"My apologies for the food, Miss... Caniara, yes? We can try to get you something else to eat later. But first, I have a request if you could be so kind as to hear me out."

"Hmph," she scoffed. "First it's a terrible reception, then a horrid excuse for a meal, and now you're asking me for favors? My mercy will only go so far, peasant. And that's Miss Caniara to you!"

"I... that is what I said."

"No it isn't. I have ears you know. Are you calling me a liar?"

She took another bite from her meal, unwilling to believe she had simply misheard him as she did. The village head's patience was wearing thin, but he needed her help, and that drove him forward in this conversation.

"Please, accept my apology. It must have been a slip of the tongue. As I was trying to ask... Ruthuns is in danger. We've gotten word about a pack of monsters from up north heading our way. We can't afford to hire anyone strong enough to deal with this problem, so I have no choice but to ask you. If nothing is done, we'll have to abandon the village and leave behind our livelihoods-"

"Alright, I've heard enough. There's obviously nothing left for me here."

Caniara stands up from her seat, meal fully eaten now. She grabs the table cloth and wipes her face with it before letting it flutter down to its original position. She looked like she was about to leave out the door, so the head acted quickly.

"Please, Miss Caniara. We have nobody else to turn to! You're the only one powerful enough to possibly defeat those monsters!"

She stops in her tracks, placing one of her body hands on her cheek and turns around towards the head. He expected her to yell at him again, but was greeted by the sight of her smiling with a slight blush to her cheeks.

"...Powerful? Yes, I suppose I am very great and powerful. Well worded, yes. What was it you needed again?"

He has to take a moment to register the sudden complete 180 in her attitude. He swiftly gathers his senses and pleads with her some more.

"T-The monsters from up north. We need someone as... strong and elegant as Miss Caniara to defeat them before they can reach us."

"Elegant... Yes, that does sound like me. I suppose it wouldn't be bad timing to stretch my limbs and kill some mongrels for a fan of mine. No, not at all!"

Her spirits had been fired up. All it took was a few compliments and she was ready to throw hands for this village.

"Yes yes yes, you can leave it to me! And when I return, please get a better meal ready!"

"Right, yes, of course Miss Caniara! We'll have a feast ready for your return!"

Without asking, the demon woman grabs a decorative sword from the wall and bursts outside, taking off into the forests. The village head released a sigh of relief. Dealing with her was tiresome, but he'd do anything to save the village he loved so dearly. As he watched Caniara run into the distance, he could feel hope welling inside his chest again.

Unfortunately, Ruthuns Village was destroyed a couple days later and everyone killed because Caniara got lost and went the wrong way soon after going into the woods. Coincidentally, she did eliminate a completely different pack of monsters that was minding their own business, and believes she did save the day. When she tried to go back and claim her prize and get more praise, she was never able to find that village again.

And life goes on.
