>hyena boys always have it shitty in their packs
>the women run it all with an iron fist
>this results in prison rules type shit
>the males treat each other shit from top to down
>littlest runt gets abused the worst
>what this means is the hyena femboy in front of you has nothing positive
>no caring parents
>no siblings that won't use him as a punching bag
>humans and human kindness almost sounds unreal to this boy
>but both of you adventuring led to this curious boy in front of you
>he wants a better pack
>starting with you
>traveling the plains led by your curiosity had paid off
>originally you were big game hunting
>a life of adventure
>now you had this in front of you
>buck naked and constantly interested in humans
>any caution on the hyenas part was long gone
>maybe it was too much sun
>you didn't know
>you didn't mind the company though
>a gift of dried beef had him staying close to your fire

>you found yourself tired from the day's journey
>you hoped sincerely the hyena would follow suit
>or at the very least wasn't just a thief
>granted he'd already stolen a couple things from you 
>plus you were pretty confident he'd learned quick 
>you were a good provider and he'd be a fool to pass that up
>while affection at first seemed completely alien to him, he had enjoyed it 
>judging by the slight swelling of his manhood when you kept touching it, he definitely enjoyed it
>you weren't about to push your luck with a boy who's bite force could go through bone though
>weren't quite that daring
>so for tonight you accepted the new blanket 
>your fears of him just leaving in the night seemed foolish in the face of this behavior
>the hyena was probably harder to untangle than a python 
>not that you were going to want him gone
>the warmth of his short coat on bare skin was nice
>as was the thump of his heartbeat so close to yours
>he said something in his language 
>almost a murmur
>"yangu"
>clawed hands pulled him as close to you as two people could be
>you reciprocated and sleep hit you like a hammer

>the savanna sunrise was almost as warm as the body still clinging to you
>legs and arms all entangled around you
>how either of you slept like that on the ground was anyone's guess
>his soft breath against your neck was cute
>his morning erection digging against your hip was another story
>not that you minded
>you had a feeling you weren't leaving your spot until he awoke
>not like rising up with the hyena was impossible
>you just didn't want to wake him
>you wanted this moment to stay pristine
>your fears last night felt ridiculous now
>his lithe frame coiled so tightly around you
>it seemed all his weight went to his hips 
>otherwise a stiff breeze might have dire consequences 
>you tried not to push your luck at the moment again
>while you knew he liked your company it wasn't quite right to pounce on him like a lion on a kill right this second
>might spook him
>from the corner of your eye you saw his eyes flutter awake

>he did a double take
>maybe he thought last night was a pleasant dream
>you'd be inclined to believe it too
>he was slow to untangle himself 
>all the while he watched you with curiosity 
>you noticed he noticed your tented pants
>you were both men after all
>was that a blush on his face?
>it was a cute look on him
>your warm smile towards him made him cuddle back up to you
>there were other pressing matters unfortunately 
>you absolutely stunned him with a soft kiss before you made to get up
>at least you had company now
>though there were some personal space things you'd have to chat about eventually
>made for an awkward trip to the brush
>afterwards you elected to get cleaned up, breakfast could wait
>bathing in the nearby river was easily gotten across to him
>through body language was what smattering of English you pointed out he knew just where to go
>normally you wouldn't concern yourself with such comforts but you were finishing the hunting trip early
>watching his hips as he led you you were pleased with the game you bagged
>though the scars along his back troubled you
>best not to inquire right away
>introducing him to soap and shampoo would be a fantastic opportunity to get handsy as it was

>you had brought your kit and rifle along to the river 
>you'd take this other man back to civilization hopefully
>the hyena could be your… guide
>yes
>a guide
>putting him in pants would be disappointing 
>if he was worried about your rifle he didn't show it
>seemed more interested in your other gun
>he guided you by the hand all along
>his body moved gracefully through the brush 
>all the while you tried not watching his body move too much
>the ass jiggle was making that difficult 
>by the time you made it to the river you were rock hard again
>hiding it would be pointless with bathing 
>his eyes went immediately to it when he turned to show you the water
>your eyes scanned for hippos and crocodiles 
>neither would be welcome company
>one part safety and one part trying really hard to fall prey to the rough pretty charms of the hyena
>satisfied they would be undisturbed you went to pull toiletries from your pack
>not paying attention to him gave him the opportunity to yank you pants down
>you jumped up in surprise as he giggled
>yellow eyes went right to your exposed dick when you turned
>maybe your earlier conservative approach but unwarranted

>you removed your boots and pants
>the shirt was next
>all the while he stared up and down
>hiding an erection was impossible now
>to be fair he wasn't hiding his either
>surprisingly hung for such a petite guy
>after you hung up your clothes he was quickly cuddled up to your shoulder
>without warning he decided to play with your manhood
>he appraised it 
>repeated that word he said last night
>"yangu"
>you relaxed and embraced him 
>this was your goal all along anyways
>convincing him to come to civilization might be very easy
>his grip was rough but he knew just what he was handling
>you decided to reciprocate 
>your own hand ventured downwards and squeezed a full glute
>he moaned like a whore into your ear
>what a good guide
>the instinct to just breed the boy on the beach was so strong
>his hole was begging for it
>you'd seen it while he walked
>he made no point of hiding his body
>this native boy needed stuffing
>you looked over him
>the grey and black coat was silky and shined softly in the sun
>pretty yellow half lidded eyes craved him
>his mouth hung open with cute little noises
>"yangu"
>you decided to parrot it back for his reaction
>"yangu"
>he melted in your arms

>the urge to just utterly ruin that hole was strong
>a weaker man would just bend him over against the nearest tree
>you'd normally pretend you were civilized
>but God help you you were a weaker man
>but goddamn did you want to make a hyena wife out of this specimen
>your other hand pumped at his manhood and he was a leaky mess
>this hunting trip was a lucky break
>you were going to enjoy this
>so was he from the sounds he was making
>you might not bother with pants when you to went to civilization 
>might be fun to see him in something more feminine 
>he was girlish enough that you could throw him in a sundress
>that would be a fantastic idea for later
>his language in your ear was so cute
>the way he just gave into your touch 
>his little tail twitched against your arm as you kept squeezing his ass
>he was a keeper
>it brought out the animal in you
>the need to just make him yours
>that pink hole teased you all along that walk
>it was perfect for your dick
>you spread his cheek and moved him to the nearest tree
>bathing could wait after all

>some might have said you behaved unseemly 
>out in the savanna you didn't give a damn right now
>rutting this hyena boy took priority over civility 
>he was practically babbling as you bent him over
>there was the prize
>right under his twitchy tail
>"yangu"
>there was that word again
>you didn't understand it but got the intent
>the way he said it and the way he reacted it had to be a term of endearment 
>he was just too fucking good to pass up
>now you weren't going in dry
>as much as you wanted to do unspeakable things to this ass you were still a gentleman
>he gave a sultry look over his shoulder
>you spit on your cock and on his hole
>made sure they were both as wet as could be
>you wanted him to enjoy it too after all
>after a couple minutes of luring him up you could feel him rub against your manhood 
>his wet warm hole twitching against your shaft
>he was biting his lip over his shoulder
>pleading up to you with puppy dog eyes
>his ass was thick enough your fingers sunk into it
>you cockhead parted his ring of muscle as his claws shredded the tree he was pushed against 
>he threw his head up and groaned as it slowly filled him
>"mtu wangu"
>The words were drawn out but you let him speak 
>"nifanye mama"
>even now what he was saying was a mystery but you kept pushing slowly
>bottoming out in the hyena was a greater trophy than any game

>he clung like a vice
>it took all your self control not to make his hole a mess then and there
>getting a better grip on his meaty hips was necessary 
>he was noisy
>you enjoyed every second of it
>he must be a virgin because there was a real concern you'd not be able to pull back
>his hold was that tight
>eventually though persistence won and you slowly pulled out
>watching that pink ring cling the whole way back
>his noises were so girlish 
>it was endearing
>yeah he was definitely a keeper
>your cockhead stayed lodged firmly in 
>tugging back slightly made him whine and look back at you with pleading ears
>language barrier or no you knew what that look meant
>slowly back in 
>slowly back out
>you were careful not to hurt him
>his claws dug deep grooves into the bark
>after building up a decent rhythm you ran a hand up to his chest
>he gasped at the rough touch
>you leaned down to give him a hungry kiss
>slamming it back in every thrust made him squeak into your mouth
>the jiggle from his ass was felt in your other hand
>every bottoming out made it ripple
>his cock bobbed with every thrust, spreading pre cum across the sand 
>you loved everything about this hyena 
>when you broke the kiss both of you were briefly out of breath
>his tongue hung out of his mouth, a trail a saliva still connecting you 
>he kept wanting to look into your eyes and you loved looking into his
>you felt his ass start pressing back to meet your hips
>he needed this bad
>and you'd be lying if you said you didn't need this too

>burying yourself in the nape of his neck flooded your nose
>his scent was a mixture of male, dirt and meat
>like musk mixed with the plains and your last meal
>you wondered how he'd smell clean
>this boy would look good in anyway
>as feminine as he looked you loved the manly qualities he showed here and there
>like the throbbing cock between his legs spraying thin precum like a hose
>he made no attempt to touch himself
>content to get all his pleasure from his newly christened pussy
>you however were a gentleman 
>the hand that was pressed to his heaving chest ventured down and gripped his cock
>he let loose another moan and that touch was enough to set him off
>ropes of hyena seed started decorating the sand beneath you both
>his body quivered and you were sure he wasn't even speaking his tongue so much as gibberish now
>his asshole was now strangling your shaft
>as unreal as his hole was before, with his climax it was a dick trap
>the skinny hyenas body quivered as he came and came
>you could swear it lasted up to ten seconds
>his own orgasm wretched yours out out your body
>he was stuffed full of your seed to the point it spilled out as you slowly pulled out
>a little post coitus cuddling and now you were ready for a bath
>the other man was putty in your arms now

>once more you watched for any sort of predators 
>your companions steps were understandably shaky
>you steadied him with your arm around his waist
>hyena took this as an opportunity to cuddle up to you
>he nuzzled up to your neck, occasionally nibbling at your ear
>all while he whispered nothings in his tongue 
>you grabbed your soap and shampoo and guided him into the warm water
>he hissed and rubbed his ass a little 
>you kissed his forehead and he all of a sudden didn't seem to mind
>his giggle was adorable
>he was a hyena after all
>he cuddled up to your chest and you relaxed while looking into his eyes
>eventually you got him turned around in the water
>he was getting ready to bend over again for you before your hand held his chest 
>your soap wasn't exactly ideal for his coat but it would do for now
>your hands lathered the bar and you started scrubbing him
>he was fascinated as you started with his arms and chest
>all the while you kissed the back of his neck to relax him
>you had a feeling you couldn't lose him even if you wanted
>in fact you were more than happy you convinced him
>you appreciated his frame the more your hands ran over him
>the shallow chest, the slender arms
>he looked over his shoulder with a toothy smile
>here you had one of the deadliest things in the savanna totally domesticated 
>though he didn't seem like he could or would hurt a fly
>washing the front was easy
>he looked a little nervous when you washed his back
>the frenzy of arousal no longer overpowered his self esteem issues about it
>no doubt there was a story with those scars
>you'd be there for it when the time came
>at the moment it was just another part of him
>you worked him all over
>after getting him you spun him around and gave him the bar
>you'd take care of the unmentionables soon enough but not after your face
>he got the message immediately 
>his hands roamed and scrubbed you, parroting what you did for him
>occasionally he'd get distracted with your bicep or your collarbone
>but for what must be a first time he'd did well
>eventually both of you ended up clean and smelling of ginger
>he even copied the kisses to your neck when he scrubbed you 
>it was refreshing
>after cleaning you'd take breakfast and take him along to civilization

>clothing him would be funny
>if it wasn't you being the one to try and put spare pants on him
>you couldn't take him back to the lodge with his meat hanging out
>you could take him behind the lodge like that
>but not into the actual establishment 
>it didn't help that your pants seem to hide his favorite thing in the world
>multiple times during the trek he'd try to get intimate 
>his charms were of course, working
>but you had a couple days journey back to comfort
>you both would need to conserve the energy
>to his credit, while pants seemed difficult, he was happily following you
>you tried to explain there were more nice things where you were from
>he seemed unconcerned about all that
>judging by how he stayed in your lap when you rested that's what he wanted from civilization 
>you wouldn't mind 
>at least you were a cheap enough dowry
>the nights were the toughest
>he was so hungry for you
>you'd awoken in the night to him grinding against you
>his little moans are what awoke you
>you pulled him close and kissed him
>while you didn't join him you let him finish on your leg
>he was so going to be trouble
>good trouble
>the next day you did some basic English as you walked
>slowly he picked up your words and occasionally you'd pick up his
>it was all really bare bones and having a full conversation was out of the order 
>one of the most important things was out of the way
>his name was Chacha
>it made you smile when you repeateded it

>his company was welcome 
>you used to hate the idea of hunting in a group
>sure there was safety in numbers, but usually you had little tolerance for a lot of people
>it was risky to just go out into the brush for weeks at a time
>honestly, you stood a scary chance of running afoul some danger eventually 
>you'd have slipped up somehow
>but with Chacha you stood a fairer chance in the field
>somehow you doubted you'd have much time to hunt any more anyways 
>when you finally returned to the lodge your contemporaries were understandably baffled
>Chacha was your guide
>yes
>you'd need room and board for the night for the both of you
>yes he'd sleep in your quarters
>it was simply economical 
>ignore the way the hyena hung off you affectionately 
>it was… cultural differences 
>after all the Italians kissed as greetings
>no, you weren't accepting more questions now
>Chacha did seem curious about this new alien world around him

>your room was humble but had all the basics
>running water and electricity was accessible 
>Chacha was clearly awestruck by it all
>you took a lot of this stuff for granted
>after the journey through the brush you were exhausted and you figured he was too
>a quick scrub down in the shower and a change to more comfortable clothes had you certainly more relaxed
>Chacha enjoyed your hands on him at least
>still resisted clothes but behind closed doors you weren't as persistent 
>you instead offered him space on your bed for a midday nap
>he immediately hopped onto the bed and took his place next to you
>he preferred using you as a pillow over all the ones on the bed
>you threw a light blanket over both of you and just let your weariness take you
>he tangled himself around you and this had to be the best feeling in the world
>you awoke a few hours later to another best feeling in the world
>he'd awoken sometime before you and straddled you under the blankets
>you were eye to eye when you woke up to the grinding 
>at least you didn't worry yourself about conserving energy here
>he had fished your cock out of your pajamas and was frotting your manhoods together
>all with a big toothy smile on his face
>"yangu" 
>you'd have to figure out his tongue sooner or later
>"p-plesse"
>well that you sort of recognized from an earlier impromptu lesson
> your hands dug into his ample hips and you ground back against him
>both of you bucked slowly against the other
>God if he thought electricity was fascinating he was going to love proper lube

>this savanna boy was insatiable 
>not that you could complain
>he'd even seen other humans now and preferred being glued to you
>if that wasn't endearment you didn't know what was
>you felt his tail occasionally twitch just from how it affected his glute muscles
>he looked good perched on you like this
>there was no frantic rush to orgasm like before
>you were both content to just enjoy each other's company
>plus you worried about how much noise your…guide would make if you both went all out
>Feeling him throb against you was thrilling
>you both got this reaction from the other
>he dipped down to hungrily kiss at your face
>he kept murmuring as he did
>his voice was sugary sweet and a little sleepy
>it was adorable
>surprisingly you were the first to cum this time
>with a grunt you shot your seed upwards, making Chacha smile
>"yangu"
>he worked a little faster against your softening cock and soon followed
>thick strings of cum decorated your pajama shirt
>it was hard to tell who's was who's but Chacha made an impressive show of venturing down and licking it all up

>as tempted as you were to just let him drain your balls all day, you were hungry
>you suspected he was too
>after the nap and relaxation you had that need in your mind
>thankfully the lodge provided
>it was like an inn back home
>just a lot stranger menu
>water buffalo had a distinct flavor compared to beef
>if Chacha liked the jerky provisions you had, he was going to love a nice juicy steak
>after cleaning up your shirt he had contented himself with resting against your chest
>always with that smile
>the warmth was very welcome
>you tried indicating you were taking him to dinner
>took a second before he lit up further
>then the enthusiasm was lost when he had to put on pants
>an idea struck
>in a moment of spontaneity you torn the bed sheet up
>turns out he much rather preferred the freedom of a knee length "tribal skirt"
>you had no idea if that was a thing but you would bluff your way through your compatiots regardless 
>you'd just pay the owner for new sheets later
>he wasn't so stubborn about one of your shirts
>even taking the time to smell it
>satisfied, you walked down to grab a meal with the hyena on your heels
>most of the other hunters and staff paid you no mind
>occasionally the hyena got a head turning but since he was with you there didn't seem much trouble
>his dress attracted the most attention and you did gall back on his "tribal ways" that you not a single damn thing of
>still easy to bluff
>your companion wasn't super unique to the savanna and wasn't hostile
>that was enough for most

>trouble came eventually
>you both were at your table minding your business 
>a young fellow hunter came over
>you knew from his swagger what was coming
>he had something to prove
>his eyes went to Chacha 
>you intervened first
>hand on the knife on your belt you rose slowly
>"you taking in strays?"
>the tone was contemptuous 
>the mock smile fooled Chacha
>he smiled back, though his eyes went back to you
>he started to look worried 
>what you did was none of his business 
>palming the handle of your knife hopefully got that across
>you were stoic 
>eventually he backed down and left
>thankfully it didn't end up in violence
>though you weren't sure about a next time
>the guy glared daggers as he left
>you allowed yourself to relax and enjoy your steak
>the hyena relaxed after watching you
>you'd have to protect the boy 
>watching him devour the water buffalo steak and felt a peace
>you'd have to protect this
>Chacha finished his dinner first unsurprisingly 
>you savored your meal while also teaching him basic words related to the surroundings 
>he was using his new outfit to his advantage, flashing you under the table
>this boy was going to be a handful
>perhaps after acclimating him more you'd take him back upstairs 
>you couldn't lie and say his flirting wasn't working

>sitting around and digesting was a good idea
>you conversation was still sort of broken
>you didn't expect him to learn overnight though
>it was best to just enjoy the moment 
>he was smart though, catching a lot here and there
>his enthusiasm was adorable
>he hung on your every word
>you also learned from him best you could
>it may help fill the gaps of conversation.
>you were learning just as well as him
>your mind was filled with ideas but you persevered 
>he hung on every word
>yangu was in fact a term of endearment and the most simple one
>it meant mine

>you retreated to your room
>Chacha was too eager to be affectionate out in the open 
>and it wasn't like you were going to deny him
>in fact you think all it'd take is him pouting or flashing that smile and you'd be wrapped around his finger
>it was hard to deny someone so cute
>you had a feeling you'd be taking trips out to the brush just so he could openly snuggle against you
>that wasn't an awful proposition in of itself at least
>you'd found something more fun than the hunt
>you continued your fast and loose English lessons up stairs
>reclined in a chair facing a window, watching the African sunset with him in your lap
>while he insisted your dick was "yangu", even grabbing through the pants for emphasis, you insisted on proper English 
>his accent was adorable
>ended up giving "dick" two syllables 
>played around with it on his tongue
>then went back to calling it "yangu"
>well you tried

>Chacha became a bit of curiosity when you started to bring him home
>often your journey to the shore was punctuated by questions about the hyena
>the climate of the ocean was strange to him
>the air had a humid chill he wasn't a fan of
>it just made him all the more eager to get closer to you
>it would either that or he would bundle up in your older clothes
>he appreciated your old wardrobe but appreciated your embrace even more
>the hyena attracted stares
>outwardly he was your guide freshly hired from the plains
>you had brought him back because you wanted his services on call
>that was not so much a lie as a half truth
>he was a guide… of sorts and he did provide service
>you'd be relieved when you returned to your estate, away from wordless questions
>in order to fit into polite society you had started an in depth curriculum in English and manners
>table manners were right out first off
>you were enough of a realist to know cutlery was not important from Chacha's background and you felt it would be better in a more formal setting
>he had taken a liking to learning when you provided incentives
>you however did not completely discourage his native tongue or habits
>his world was fascinating to you 
>however from what you could see he was far better off with you
>with his slow acquisition of a common tongue you were provided a unique glimpse 
>you encouraged him to learn to write
>he took to it easily
>grasping the concept readily despite what appeared to be no history of it from what you gathered
>he was not grasping prose and poetry immediately but he was coming along better than one with little experience on the subject
>the enthusiasm in his lessons was heartwarming 
>you knew he was doing it as an expression of his affection for you
>an outsider may have seen this as you uplifting Chacha
>it was different than that
>the boat trip offered an extended chance for time together
>he was in a spare set of your sleeping clothes, not enjoying the chill of the cabin air that evening 
>he excitedly pointed to a page in one of your books
>an illustration demonstrating waltzing
>the gestures got over the language barrier 
>he wanted that
>clearly he wanted to appreciate your culture 
>your room on the ship was cramped but you'd make do
>years of education beaten into you gave you a muscle memory of how to do the basics
>you were not an expert 
>however you could not say no to that toothy smile
>so you naturally found yourself charmed
>the hyena boys fur had softened and made glossy from your efforts to keep him cleaner
>not that he did not take every opportunity to make it dirty again with you
>he had learned more English than you had guessed he would in such a short time
>"please?"
>that sweet voice was growing on you
>it was easy to hold onto his waist and you took his hand with your free one
>the clawed fingers and smooth pads always felt so very strange entwined with yours but it was uniquely his hand
>he let you take the lead without question
>that night, your cramped cabin might as well be a ballroom
