*%yellow%"WELCOME EVERYONE!"%%
%yellow%"TO THE GREATEST HERO AWARDS!"%%*

[*Theme Song*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=e9r5hx47kxM&pp=ygUXbWFyaW8ganVtcCB1cCBzdXBlcnN0YXI%3D)

A man in a bright pink suit walked on stage.

*%yellow%"WE'VE HAD HIGHS AND LOWS THROUGH ALL THESE YEARS... AND A QUESTION RINGS THROUGHOUT THE EARS OF EVERY CITIZEN:"%%*

He turned the microphone in his hand to the audience.

**%orange%"WHO'S THE GREATEST HERO?!"%%**

*%yellow%"WELL, TODAY'S THE DAY THAT QUESTION GETS ANSWERED! I'D LIKE TO BRING OUT MY FIRST GUESS: **ATUSHI OROCHI!!**"%%*

The crowd roared in applause. Everywhere, people were cheering and clapping. TV and online viewers around the world were tuned in to see this monumental event.

And then, Orochi walked on stage. In her beautiful red dress, she took a few bows as people threw roses up at her as she attempted to make it to the pink-suited man in the center stage.

Some people fainted.

*%yellow%"Well, Mrs Atsushi, I suppose there's no use delaying this any longer! **YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THE GREATEST HERO AWARD!!!**"%%*

The crowd went wild. People screamed, cheered, they were losing their minds. A few people in the back got rowdy, starting a weird mosh-pit of sorts.

Then, Orochi cleared her voice.
She had a speech.
Everyone went quiet.

"...peeple say im a self excerpt mary sue slut. but the truth is i have 50 bilion boyfreinds and they all love me and your just mad that i am haveing way more fucking fun then you ever will. you know. whats your damage? maybe you should try and have 50 bilion boyfreinds too becuase maybe then youll not be such a salty jealous bitch! im just saying."

The crowd **SHRIEKED**. This was the most excitement anyone had felt in a long time, probably in the history of Earth. How could they not? The strongest, richest, hottest, and smartest hero- no, being that ever existed or ever will exist had just graced them with a speech that shook the world to its very core.
Some people in the crowd started killing each other out of excitement.

*%yellow%"Mrs Atsushi! T-That was beautiful! But, it's not enough to hear it from someone as humble as you. Let's hear it from **your family!**"%%*

And so, 6 people walked onto stage.

Sandatsu.
Mio.
Orochi I.
Orochi II.
Orochi III.
And Orochi IV.

All with the last name Atsushi.

Orochi's husbandwife, wife, and 4 kids.

Sandy went up to Orochi and gave her a big meaty kiss.

"Queen Lady Orochi... I have to thank you for all those years ago when I went crazy and you raped me in front of all my friends, MINDBREAKING me into your cute husbandwife. And then I gave you our two beautiful children, Orochi I and Orochi III. I love you for that."

And then Mio walked up to Orochi and gave her a big meaty kiss.

"Queen Lady Orochi... and then you tracked me down and dragged me into the streets, where you raped me, MINDBREAKING me into your cute wife. And then I gave you our other two beautiful children, Orochi II and Orochi IV."

Both Sandy and Mio kneeled down and began practically worshipping Orochi on stage, and she considered violently raping them right then and there, but decided not to because she was tuckered out from her speech.

All four of Orochi's kids said "We love you mommy!" in unison.

*%yellow%"Oh, you lovebirds are adorable! But, now we have to get you the physical award!"%%*

17 scientists came on stage, and unveiled a strange device behind a curtain.

"Erm, the greatest hero award is forged from 32 dying multiverses, so if it's not properly contained, erm, existence as we know it we'll be destroyed. This device is to summon it, but even with our collective IQ of 4000, we can't figure out how to operate it!"

Orochi cleared her voice.

"i have an q of 4001 and i bulit this device last tuesday."

The crowd awed and oooh'd.

As Orochi went over to the device, and hit the big red button that said 'ON', reality began to quake before them. She merely reached out and held reality in place thanks to her strength from her 39 prior Quirk Awakenings.

As the reward was printed out of the machine (a thin piece of multiversal paper that said "u r number 1"), Orochi held it triumphently in the air.

I'm not gonna bore you all with the details.
Orochi won, and that's what matters.

Orochi had a fun time and then she went and had sex with Sandatsu and Mio.
The end.
