>So here I am
>Packing my things
>Getting ready to move to America with my boyfriend
>Wow
>I never thought I'd find a man to love
>Let alone a foreigner I'd follow back to his home country
>How do I feel?
>Equal parts excited and nervous
>Will I do well in America?
>I know my English is excellent
>Thanks to him
>But I still stumble at times
>Will his friends and family like me?
>I know they know about me
>But meeting someone in person is a whole different story
>Will living with him be a good experience?
>Kami, I'm worrying so much
>I'm sure it'll be fine
>I'll enjoy myself
>...I hope
>I hear the door open
>"Need any help?"
>I turn around to see him in the doorframe
>"I don't think I need it, but I'd appreciate it."
>He looks at me
>"Nervous?"
>"...A bit."
>"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of. I was nervous about coming to Japan."
>"Could've fooled me," I tease
>We share a laugh at that, which breaks some ice
>"Seriously, though, it's only natural to be nervous about moving to another country long-term. Just don't let it get the better of you."
>"Easy for you to say, you've never had to deal with chronic shyness and social anxiety."
>"Don't sell yourself short. You've made so much progress, and this'll help you keep going down that road."
>"I don't know... I'm still-"
>"Well, I'm sure it'll be a positive experience for you. You'll adjust like I did. Hell, you've got a head start."
>"...You have a point."
>He smiles
>"Trust me, baby, I know you won't regret this. Coming to Japan was the best thing I ever did. If I hadn't, I'd never have met you."
>...Kami, how does he know exactly what buttons to press to turn my face red?
>"Sorry if I'm getting sappy, but I'm serious. I know America will be as wonderful for you as Japan was for me. Maybe even more."
>I look at my handkerchief to hide my blush
>"What are we going to do in America?"
>"I think the better question is what aren't we going to do. I'm gonna make sure you experience everything America has to offer, just like how I experienced everything Japan has to offer."
>"That sounds wonderful."
>"It is. And you won't be seen as an oversized freak. People as tall as us aren't so unusual in America. We won't stand out as much as we do here. You won't exactly be small there, but you won't be a giantess either."
>"...Will I do well in an American college?"
>"Of course you will. You're one of the smartest girls in your school and your English is almost perfect. It's better than my Japanese when I first came here. Thanks again for your help, by the way."
>I blush
>"But will I fit in with American college culture?"
>"It's more forgiving than high school culture. People have outgrown bullying and caring about cliques. Besides, foreign students aren't seen as unusual."
>"...Will your friends and family accept me?"
>"If I know them half as well as I think I do, of course they will. I've told them so much about you and our relationship. They can't wait to meet you. All you have to do is be yourself."
>He really knows how to reassure me
>Makes sense
>He's been helping iron out my insecurities from practically the moment he first entered my classroom
>I know adjusting to America will have its challenges
>But I can overcome them as long as he's with me
>And if I don't like it, I can always go back home
>Though to be honest, I'm starting to feel like my home is with him...
