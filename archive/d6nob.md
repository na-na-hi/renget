    on the topic of lore, i guess i can share a little piece of lore for fun. my original plan for booker was to not reveal his true name, and just use a nickname he had as a human, which he got b/c he was a nerd: bookworm
    (it was also a pun b/c he becomes a bug pokemon)
    but i decided to give him an actual name instead, and changed bookworm to the similar-sounding booker
    but i still imagine bookworm was indeed a nickname he had as a human, derived from his true name of booker

    at the very start of the guild, i actually made a whole word doc with pictures and a table explaining booker and sneasel's backstory, stats, perosnality, etc
    it's got lots of outdated info but some was kept to the final canon version
    maybe i'll share it sometime

    @booker what's the biggest difference from word file booker and true booker?

!!!info booker
    ok... i found the doc with my initial ideas for booker it was created 3-3, which i think was the same day the whole guild project started, or thereabouts. one major difference is that booker could actually fly
    sneasel had the goal of earning enough money to open her own dojo
    and her nickname would have been "Lin" short for "Gremlin"

    that is a huge difference lol

	also, unlike the current version which just has a damaged ear, she originally had multiple scars all over her body, but none on her back because she never flees from a battle

	booker used to play music but can't really do it anymore due to lacking fingers, which makes him sad
	but in the current version of his character, i dunno if he ever learned how to play any music

	I thought he mentioned playing an instrument in one of your stories
!!!info booker
	@phanpy i can't remember that
!!!note phanphy
    @booker https://rentry.org/RibombeeSentimental

	@phanpy oh, i forgot. thanks for reminding me

	one more thing: in the first version, booker had a phobia of being picked up or grabbed, since sneasel once hurt him by grabbing him early on
!!!note linoone
	@booker that would be way too sad! Grabbing the booker and putting him on your head shouldn't be feared

	actually, one more thing. the original team name was "cutting edge", mainly due to sneasel's claws. i like team brave better though
