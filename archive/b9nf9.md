>It's still dark out...
>Hey, Anon, what time is it-
>Oh, right. He's...
>Don't think about him... you need to get to sleep... j-just close your eyes and block it out...
>...
>God damn it... stop thinking about him!
>It couldn't have worked out! You knew that! HE knew that! If the our families learned we were getting so close... I mean, it's one thing that he's a guy, but HUMAN too? If anybody found out it would mean...
>So why did he keep trying to get so close to you?! H-he should have known better! This is HIS fault!
>...
>No, that's not being fair to him, is it? You let it happen. Wanted it, even, didn't you? Begging for every glance and word like a stupid lovesick puppy...
>Ancestors help me... i'm such a freak...
>I wonder what he's doing right now? What he's thinking about? He's probably asleep, he has his important human duties or whatever, he's certainly better adjusted than the pack's runt here...
>Does he even think of me anymore?
>Would he even care that I can't get him out of my head? That I keep waking up thinking if I reach out he'll be there?
>The bed doesn't even feel like mine anymore without his body being there to indent it...
>...
>You had to burn the bridge too, didn't you? Say all those horrible things about him because you were insecure and scared...
>Who am I kidding, no way he's thinking about a loser like me after all that. Especially after I started crying towards the end...
>...
>No, Anon's not like that. He's a good person. He's probably already licked his wounds and m-moved on... to someone better than me.
>Guess he'll never know then... how much I miss him...
>How much I regret hurting him...
>How badly I want him back here in bed with me and to tell me it will all be ok...
>...
>Come on, get to bed. That's enough moping for one night...
>he thought Anon got to move on
>but in reality he just lays on his bed doing nothing.
>nothing interest him
>one day or several passes without anything happening.
>he doesn't cry, just feels emptiness
>but every now and then he thinks of him
>how his presense filled his life with sense of worthiness and happiness.
>but without of him what remains
>Anon. A empty husk without direction, passion or purpouse
