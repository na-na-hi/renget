There once was a population of weakling beings whose only motif in life was survival: they didn't have great thoughts, only ate and drank and let their existence run out. But there was a reason for this, the eyes of giant behemoth snake Boros, who emitted a radiance brighter than the Sun without respite, made impossible any other way of living. And his eyes were always open. There was no malice in this, with that action he kept away some degenerate little critters, exiled deviants demons of the land of Towa, who found hospice in our land and tortured us for fun before the snake acted upon them.

We have memory of this eternal destiny because it ended.
We have memory because time was born.

>*This is were all begun.*
>*Our homeland is born.*
>*The existence of* **TIME** *is realized.*
>*There was no kronies before* **TIME**.
>**TIME** *made us kronies.*

Then a strange woman appeared from the East, her dark hair instantly called the attention of the natives who were accustomed to just blinding brightness. What a sight to behold for the tortured eyes of this people. 

The woman approach the light directly, something impossible for any natives, capturing the attention of every single one soul in there. No one was more baffled about this than the snake Boros, who was being acknowledged for the first time. The eyes of the woman go white and blind, but she doesn't waver. Then something impossible happens: she mutters in an intoxicating low voice to the snake, whom gets startled by this action, another first for the beast. Then they start to communicate in an unknown language, one that no mortal would be able to articulate, the language of gods and magical beings.

The woman, whose naked beauty was being exposed, kisses the tip of the massive snake head.

The eyes of the snake close.

For the first time the natives experience darkness, which makes them scarred and lost, but they don't despair, they perceive that they are at the presence of a goddess who is on their side. At the same time, with the newborn darkness came the realization that the land they live is not a indissoluble continuum of light reflecting surfaces, but that the territory is full of riches. Their home is not the inferno they believed it was and a feeling of hope is born in them. **This is were all begun.**

The eyes of Boros started to open again but then the goddess talked again. After some words the snake decided to just open one eye, which made the light he emitted just bright enough to illuminate the territory.

A short discourse take place between them, indecipherable to mortal ears. When it finished, the snake impulsed itself up and then hit the ground, making a big divide, disappearing inside of it. After this, darkness was once again.

Moments later, the snake reappeared but now its size was comparable to the one of the goddess. Its new appearance featured a white and gold body with sapphire eyes, with the latter emitting a bright strong enough to make the scene visible. Another short exchange of words happens between this entities. Then the beast begun to creep the body of the woman, who remained undisturbed: starting from the left leg, going around the torso and through the bosoms, until reaching her neck, where then he punctuates her. The woman's eyes recovered its sight and color, now it was appreciable   that she had the same sapphire color of the snake.

Thereupon, she gently grabbed the being and put it between her hand and neck, and turned her face to the natives and approach them. One fearful little girl begun making sounds trying to ask her something, but the native don't have an articulated  language able to produce meaningful sentences. But this pure intent is nonetheless understood by the woman, the question being: 'what did you tell The Bright One?.' The woman replied, in what would become our ancient language, "I told him I found my family". She made a pause before continuing, as the present where in shock after the realization that they understood her: she was talking directly to their hearts. 'I told him,' she continued "that together we need to keep you safe, as you are his family too".

It was then when a halo, with the three unending lines, made of light appeared over the goddess head. The snake disolved in sparkles, who traveled underground.

Soon after, the earth rumbles: Boros became a giant behemoth again under the land. But it also rumbles because the land is being moved and separated from the continent and its dangers, traveling East, becoming an island. **Our homeland is born.**

Everything changed then. The snake Boros kept living underground, waiting for when he's needed again.  While resting there, when he opens his eyes the shine escapes from under the land and reflects in the sky: that's our Day. When tired, he closes his eyes and that's our Night. The newborn community, between the people of the island and the goddess who guide them, perceive this cycle and **the existence of TIME is realized.**

**TIME** is the name of this phenomenon, but the name is also **KRONII**, as the goddess reveled to be called. **OURO KRONII**.

**TIME** was the first gift of the goddess who became our goddess. Our creed is Kroniism, to love and be faithful to **KRONII**. We call ourselves Ouroborians, in honor of the sacred event that created us. We, born in this island that is our home, are kronies, as this is the land our beloved gave us.

After this, kronies learn what time is and their civilization starts.The woman names herself Ouro Kronii and told us that the snake name is Boros. We became worshipers of the goddess and her ally behemoth snake, we are the Ouroborians. Kroniism is born.

There was no kronies before **TIME**.
**TIME** made us kronies.

 !!! note Extra lore:

>Etymology of words:

Language and religious scholar has been studying together the origin of our words to understand better how our culture developed.

Boros and Ouro: Boros is linked to modern words of Light, but also Loop/Repeat. Ouro is pretty precisely the word for Time, but also has the meaning in old language for Order and was used as Dark/Darkness as an antonym of the former. So Ouroboros means 'Light and Darkness' and also 'Time Loop', and the Ouroborian name we receive as believers of Kroniism comes for the symbolic union of the snake Boros and the goddess Kronii.
Kronii: besides being a name, theorist believe that it might have been a title of the likes to 'ruler' or 'queen', and that probably lousy translations from past historians is where the modern title of Warden came from. But this also would make sense as some religious scholars believe Time is a separate entity of Kronii's existence but only her advent gave it significance to the people of Infinity. Both interpretations, Kronii being Time or the Warden of Time, are accepted, as it doesn't affect the cult of Kronii. As a color note, linguist like to say that our ancient word for the sea animal seal is a homonym of the word Kronii for some unknown reason.

>How Kronii chose her clothes:

The white and black scheme is because she brought the day and night cycle, her first gift.
Ribbon is the same as her eye color and is the same color Boros took upon himself. Sapphire.
The gold was a gift from Ouroborians to her goddess.
The chain represent the union between her, Boros and the Ouroborians.

>What about Tick and Tock?
	
Tick and Tock, historians believe, weren't with Kronii from the start. Our history has been passed in oral tales, so much of the details are confusing and might be distorted. In the case of those weapons, the most clear origin seems to be the tale of a blacksmith, who might have been a kronie or not but definitely an ouroborian, that one day came to Kronii and gave them to her. She told Kronii that one day she had a fever dream in which the Titan WADA, mother of Kronii, asked her to do this weapons in a magical forge with materials only available in the real of dreams; so she complied and worked on them for what felt centuries, just to suddenly wake up with Tick and Tock resting on her lap. Some recent studies by scholars have found that in another country, now that we have access to them, there is a deity figure that might fit the character of the blacksmith: Kaela from the Holo ID pantheon. But there isn't enough proof of this, and there has not been a historical revision about it by the Kronii Appetentia yet.

>Is Kronii really our goddess if Boros existed before her?

The Boroshian, who believe Kronii is an usurper of Boros' kingdom, think that the goddess Kronii abused Boros difficult position of eternally protecting the people of this land to claim for herself the people and land of Infinity. Not only the Boroshian people believe that they were 'separated' of Boros and the perfect and peaceful union with him of being one in a simple loop on shining ignorance, but condemned the land of what now is Infinity to be separated of the Holocontinent.

>What about Krono. Where he comes from, what is his deal?

Some other day anon. Some other day.
