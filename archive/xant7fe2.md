# Ghidorah Jutsu List

## Weapon Art + Chakra Flow

> Blades of Blood
Ghidorah's trump card - he uses his poisonous blood to launch crescents of purple, poison-infused chakra that not only have extreme cutting power but are highly poisonous as well. 

> Bloody Tears
Ghidorah's most common technique to use when threatened - he either pricks his finger or slices his wrist (depending on the severity of the technique) with a kunai and throws the bloody, poisoned kunai at his opponent.

> Bloodblade
Ghidorah cuts himself with his kunai then uses his chakra to create a chakra blade of blood that extends from the kunai. He uses this as a melee weapon. 

## Illusory Arts

> Feel the Pain 

Ghidorah's Genjutsu operates in a very different manner than more standard Genjutsu. Instead of targetting the more traditional sense of sight or sound, Ghidorah traps people in his Genjutsu through the sense of touch. This Genjutsu is represented in many of his other techniques - as soon as someone is touched by either Ghidorah himself (both through close contact or from afar through a thrown kunai) or his Earth Dolls, Kidaichu, Puppets or Ink Creatures then they are under the effects of the Genjutsu, which induces and amplifies feelings of intense pain. 

> Illusory Anesthetic

The opposite of Feel the Pain, Ghidorah uses his touch-based Genjutsu to minimize the pain someone is feeling. This jutsu has multiple uses. Ghidorah can help people by reducing the pain they feel, but there's also a subtly effective way to use it offensively - foes of Ghidorah may not realize the cumulative damage they're taking over time from the constant barrage of poison, kunai and attacks from Ghidorah's little "friends". 

## Homunculi Clay

> Earth Doll
Ghidorah's basic clay dolls are quite robust as they are infused with Ghidorah's basic Earth Release. Ghidorah prefers to create small Earth Dolls which are about 3 feet tall and resemble a child's version of a small humanoid creature (think the Mole Man's Moloids from the Fantastic Four)

>Earth Doll: Poison 
Ghidorah infuses the clay with poison, making Earth Dolls which can spit out poison and burst into poison shrapnel when destroyed. 

>Earth Doll: Bloody Poison
Ghidorah's most effective (but dangerous) Earth Dolls, the mouth on his hand bites its lip and infuses the clay with the salamander poison in his bloodstream. These Earth Dolls can spit out the salamander poison and burst into bloody poisoned shrapnel when destroyed. 

## Ink Style

> Ink Swamp
Ghidorah spreads ink along the ground and uses Earth Release to create a small swamp of "inksand"- essentially quicksand made of ink. This slows down anybody who enters considerably, except for Tick, Ghidorah's pet crocodile, who will often enter the created swamp to feed.
