>The local K9 unit of the police has a 55 page file on you
>You haven't commit any crimes

>Most of those 55 pages describe your scent and your habits
>He is waiting outside your place most of the night, watching you from his car.
>He often stalks you and randomly stops you on your way to work.
>He don't want to harass you but he don't know how to talk to you

>"Chief, why do we have to guard the human in south district? Is he under witness protection or something"
>"No, nothing of the sort. It's just that he's a human in a city of predators. The only one, insofar as i'm aware, in a 300 km radius."
>"So?"
>"So it means that there's a target on his head by the more nefarious elements of our city. That's why it's up to you to keep an eye on him and make sure he's safe."
>"Isn't that kind of excessive for one human?"
>"No, and in fact i'm worried it isn't enough. Have you read the reports of the rumored human black market on the west coast? And since there's even less of them here it makes the presence of even a single one all the more prominent. Besides, why are you complaining? You seem to enjoy to taking the pictures for his file well enough. I'm honestly curious how you even got the photos of his second floor bathroom with him in it."
>"T-that's... uh... I..."
>"Skinny little thing isn't he? Could use some more bulk. Maybe you should offer to take him out to dinner?"
>"C-chief what the hell are you implyi-"
>"Oh dear, no more time to talk, your patrol is about to begin! Don't want to be late, officer, do we?"

>He spent weeks getting a good idea of the target's schedule
>He went to the gym once or twice every week, the tiger thought he should stake it out like always
>But then he figured it would be best to get a little closer to the target, for personal reasons, really
>He sat there and watched his target struggle finish running 2 miles before doing some other exercises
>All it took was forty minutes of sitting around and looking at his phone, but his target finally went to the locker room
>The tiger followed him, before he had a chance to lose sight of his target
>He walked inside and lost his target, his chief was going to eat him alive for slipping so easily
>Just as he was getting ready to leave, he noticed his target's personal gear and gym clothes on a nearby bench
>Cold sweat ran down the tiger's back
>This was his chance to get something he could use to track the target down easier
>Trying to be careful, he grabbed the target's damp, sweaty undershirt, stashed it away, and made his way back to his car

>With his task done, the tiger decided to drive away before he was noticed
>About half an hour later, he got back to his precint, with the evidence
>He figured it was best to drop it off at evidence collection and finally be done with his shift but for some reason he didn't want to get out of his car
>He stared at the shirt, desperate to control his urges
>"No" he said calmly, "I need to get rid of this before..."
>He trailed off like something was distracting him
>He grit his teeth, one hand on the door handle, another on his thigh, trying to get a hold of himself
>"God damn it" he said before losing what little self-control he had left and picked up the under-shirt before bringing it to his face and giving it a sniff
>Dopamine flooded his brain, his eyes went wide, he swore his heart skipped a beat before throwing the shirt in the passenger seat and forcing himself out of his car
>"H-holy fuck" he whispered while sitting on the ground, forcing himself to hyperventilate to get the smell out his nose
>He looked down at the bulge in his pants, and a precum stain that was starting to form, and blushed
>He sat there for a while, wondering why there was nothing in his briefing about how dangerous something like this could be
>More aroused than shocked, he walked towards his back seat, opened the door and quickly grabbed an evidence bag
>He walked to his passenger side, grabbed the shirt, stuffed it in the evidence bag and sealed it as fast as he could
>Just touching the bag was making his heart race and his dick throb
>He went inside the now empty precint, found a marker and scribbled some words on the evidence before placing them both in a safe spot
>The bag read: HANDLE WITH EXTREME CAUTION, DANGEROUS!!! with the last word underlined as if that would stop someone's curiousity
>For a second, he wondered how bad it would effect some of the canine members of the force, his boss, in particular
>That was a problem for someone else though, as he walked out

The next morning...
>Cops filed in the room, and started their standard briefing
>The officer, a firm but kind pitbull stood in front of them, holding the evidence bag with the shirt in it
>"As you saw in the report, one of our agents managed to secure this"
>He waved it around the room like he was showing off a prize, then continued
>"We will be keeping this to study it further, if anyone has questions, go ask someone else" he said with a smirk
>The meeting ended, as they all started to leave, the officer demanded one of them bring him some coffee to his office before storming out with the "evidence"
>He walked to his office and shut the door
>He was too eager to lock it
>"Besides, how bad could it be?" he said to himself while sitting at his desk, "He was clearly just exaggerating-"
>He opened the bag and slammed a hand on his desk to stop himself from screaming
>"Oh my fucking-" he said before putting his snout in the bag and sniffing
>He paused, trying to tear himself away before taking another deep breath
>His shut his eyes, sealed the bag, and hid it inside his desk when he heard the door handle move
>It was one of the interns from earlier, with his coffee
>"Just my luck, the worst fucking timing, can't you SEE I'm busy here!" he screamed while standing up, unaware of the tent in his pants
>Too shocked to say anything, the intern put the coffee down and left, apologizing for no reason
>The door shut, the officer sat back down at his desk and started sipping on his coffee, trying his hardest to not imagine a human putting a leash on him and calling him a good boy

>Anon, blissfully unaware of all of this, was simply confused as to where his shirt went
>Who would want to steal something like that after all...? What kind of weirdo...?
>He was starting to get kind of unsettled between this and the number of police cars he was seeing near his house
>And sometimes he would get goosebumps out of nowhere... like someone was watching him...
>Fortunately the weather was just warm enough to allow him to get away with jogging home without a shirt, just his shorts and backpack, although he felt decidedly naked doing so
>Anthros would do it all the time since they couldn't sweat as much to thermoregulate so it's not like he was being indecent, but he didn't like the amount of stares he was drawing...
>He always did draw stares, of course, being the only "exotic human" around these parts, but...
>And sure enough, there was another police car again, parked less than a block away from his house across the street
>Fortunately for the lupine officer sitting inside the patrol car, anon could not see behind the tinted windows of the vehicle, and remained ignorant to the growing arousal and luminescent blush of the flesh of his ears as he viewed the show
>And ignorant still was anon to the surveillance photos that were taken of him with the newly installed 24/7 security camera. Of him without his shirt on, glazed with sweat, the evening sun shining off of his lean but toned body that was now being uploaded to his file at HQ

>Finally, 2 weeks later, you had enough
>After leaving your running shoes out on your porch for 30 minutes, you returned to find them gone
>Who the hell would even steal them?! You're the only digitigrade being on this side of the fucking country! Who would find value in your sweaty brooks?
>You couldn't help but think this was targeted harassment, so you decided to put the fact that a police car was ALWAYS nearby to use
>You approached the patrol car and the window rolled down to reveal an oddly nervous looking wolf with an equally unnerved looking tiger riding shotgun
>"G-good evening Anon- HUMAN, I mean good evening human...!"
>Uhhh????
>"Officer, did you see anybody on my porch in the last 30 minutes? I left my running shoes out to dry and now they're gone."
>The wolf just stared at you with his ears tucked down and an odd expression on his face. Isn't he a cop? What's got him so nervous? Is it just because you're an odd species to him?
>The tiger noticed his partner's reticence and filled the silence in himself after clearing his throat
>"Apologies An- citizen, i'm afraid we haven't seen anything of the sort."
>Awww man, what the hell is going on that even the police didn't see anything?
>The wolf finally broke his silence and shakily asked you "u-uhh... did you want to come with us to HQ and file a stolen item report? We need to d-drop off some evidence there anyway.", he explained, his eyes darting for a split second to the backseat where a black bag with OFFICIAL POLICE EVIDENCE - DO NOT TOUCH sat
>The tiger gave the wolf a look that almost seemed so say 'what are you doing?!' to the wolf, but the wolf ignored him and kept his eyes locked on to you. It made you shiver a little.
>But... why not? Those shoes are expensive after all... since you have to import them. Might even make it easier to find them if police start looking since nobody else around here would use them...

>The tiger officer looked... nervous for some reason as you sat down in the patrol vehicle's back seat
>So much so that even when the car started moving, he kept staring at you.
>"I-is something wrong officer...?" you asked, concerned that you had somehow done something wrong
>"No, citizen. I just, uh, think I should keep the evidence up here for now.", he replied, reaching back to pick up the black bag
>But when he swung the bag up to the driver's seat, the lupine officer's eyes went as wide as a satellite dish and he started coughing, the patrol car starting to swerve in between lanes
>"W-what are you- *cough* - DOING dude?! P-put it back! Now!"
>What the fuck are they carrying in there?! Some kind of deadly agent? Is THAT why they were so nervous?!
>The tiger practically threw the bag back into the back seat with you and the wolf stabilized the car, all three of you sitting in tense silence
>Fortunately the ride to the station was short. The police car was a really nice ride, it was kind of cool to ride in it, and the HQ was a huge, sleek modern building
>"S-sorry about that. Shall we go in and file a report for you?" the wolf offered as the three of you began to climb out
>But the tiger, who quickly rushed to the back to get the mysterious evidence back into his custody, had the bag slip out of his hand
>Oh CRAP! If there really is something dangerous in that bag you're fucked six ways from sunday!
>A look of sheer horror appeared on all three of your faces as out of the bag fell...!
>Y-YOUR SHOES?!
>"W-what the FUCK?!"
>The two officers just stood there in stunned silence as you looked at them with complete dumbfounded shock

>The wolf, clearly the less experienced of the two, looked with a mix of guilt and mortified shock between the shoes, you, and finally the tiger
>The tiger, clearly the senior here, looked uncomfortable, but recovered quickly, clearing his throat again before breaking the silence with a careful, calculated order
>"... I apologize for the circumstances, Mr. Anon, but i'm afraid you are under arrest."
>HUH?!
>And hang on, they DID your name! What the hell is going on here?
>"You can't be serious! This is an outrage! For what offense, complaining about having my things stolen? Was my shirt because of you assholes too? IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN PARKED OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE EVERY-"
>The wolf took a step towards you, making you choke on your words and back up
>"I-i'm really sorry anon, but the chief thought it was necessary to keep you safe. I realize this all must be an enormous shock but we've had to keep an eye on you since you've moved here to keep you safe."
>"Keep me safe?! From WHAT?"
>The Tiger, with a less sympathetic voice, interjected this time
>"You're the human here, you know. I'm surprised you even have to ask. Are you not familiar with the situation your species is facing on the West Coast?"
>"I-I thought that was all a bunch of stupid, tabloid nonsense though! T-there's no actual proof of any of that stuff!"
>The silence and pained expression on the wolf made your heart drop. Were you seriously in danger?
>"I'm sorry, Mr. Anon, but it is true. And under the Endangered Precursor Species Act of 2087 i'm afraid we have the authority to make efforts to protect you without a need for a warrant, and that will include bringing you into custody for now."
>"But why are you arresting me? I haven't done anything wrong! By all means, tell me how stealing my clothes is protecting me-"
>"I don't have to explain anything, Mr. Anon, just as I don't need a warrant to execute this action. Please come with me, i'd like you to speak with the chief."

>What a fucking dickhead!
>But... these guys were trained professionals. That and if you refused that would be... resisting arrest...
>Ahhh fuck...
>"...fine."
>"Thank you, Anon. I will not be restraining you unless you make it necessary. Please follow me."
>The tiger led you and the wolf into the building. The wolf was bringing up the rear and he was following you uncomfortably close
>The other officers were a panoply of other species. On one hand it was nice to see some variety and diversity in a city as multispecies as this
>On the other hand you had EVERYONE'S undivided attention
>A few of them pointed to you and you heard them mumbling to each other in confusion and worry
>How much of a known entity ARE you around here?
>Out of an office stepped an older pit bull, who was smiling to himself contentedly until he saw you, causing him to choke on his coffee and rush back into his office
>Finally, you neared a large, ornate door with a placard reading "Police Chief - Precint 433" over the top
>Inside was a massive polar bear, who looked at you with surprise, saying "Something's come up, i'll have to call you back" into his desk phone before hanging up and putting on a polite smile
>"Mr. Anon, welcome."
>"So you already know who I am, huh?"
>The chief glared at his two subordinates for a split second and you could actually hear the tiger and wolf audibly gulp, but he quickly returned his attention to you with a warm smile
>"Indeed. I assume officer Rajhahan has already explained to you our purpose in watching over you?"
>"Yes, but he didn't explain why your officers have been stealing my clothes."
>The chief had a look of surprise for a split second before glaring at his subordinates again
>The wolf cracked almost instantly: "W-we needed to get a scent tracking specimen per section 506a of the-"
>"Save it, officer. I apologize wholeheartedly for the distress we may have caused you, Mr. Anon"

>Well at least ONE person here is being reasonable-
>"I'm afraid that the situation has changed, however. We are going to need to maintain a higher level of security for you in order to keep you safe."
>"So... you're going to imprison me?!"
>The polar bear let out a hearty laugh, but there didn't seem to be any malice within it
>"No no no! Not at all, Mr. Anon! I simply believe that we need to have one or two of our officers posted more visibly at or in your house for the time being."
>"IN my house, sir?"
>"Indeed. We will need to maintain a 24 hour vigilance, so there will be a need for rotating bodyguards to ensure that you are protected during all hours. And for at least the time being, you should have an escort for any travel in and around South District."
>You've got to be kidding...
And that's how the tiger, wolf and pit bull became your new roommates.

>"To protect and serve" was the police force's motto...
>Well, the three officers who had been assigned to your house to "protect" you certainly had no issues serving themselves, either
>Stealing your clothes at the gym, stealing your shoes off your porch, and now breathing your air and stealing your personal space...
>To say you were mad would be a gross, criminal understatement, but your options were limited
>True to the bearish police chief's word, the three officers had been rotating shifts every 2 days... inside your own home
>Each of them had a wildly different personality
>The Pit Bull was the only one of the two you hadn't been acquainted with yet, but he acted like you were all buddy-buddy...
>And he seemed far too happy about this new "assignment"... you had come home one evening to find that he had entered your room, the one place you expressly forbid ANY of them from ever entering, and was rifling through your dirty clothes bin
>Is everybody on this police force a huge pervert or...?
>After angrily shooing him out, the large tent he was pitching not quite escaping your notice, your mind began to settle on dark matters
>If this was what the police chief deemed 'necessary' to 'protect' you, then fine, fine
>But nothing is going to be able to protect these perverted officers from YOU
>The next day it was the inexperienced, anxious wolf's turn to invade your house
>Since you forbade any of them from entering your room, this meant that when evening came, he was camped in your living on room, out on your couch
>Staying up for 24 hours at a time is taxing on anyone, and on this particular night, the young officer had fallen asleep on your couch, curled up into a little lupine ball
>It would be cute if he wasn't a government sanctioned home invader
>And if his reaction to your shoes was any indication, your scent had the same effect on him that it apparently did to the rest of the officers...
>Time for an experiment

![Image description](https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1610/85/1610856372102.jpg)

>Gingerly, gently, carefully, you draped a blanket over the peacefully sleeping wolf
>Except it actually wasn't a blanket, it was one of your gym towels
>The reaction was instantaneous
>Still in the throes of a deep sleep, the wolf's nose began to twitch, his pulse and breathing quickened, and he let out a little whine as his dreams took an apparent shift in tone
>His tongue lolled out into view as he began to lightly pant and his left leg, hanging down from the edge of the couch to the floor, began to twitch subtly.
>So, too, did his third leg, after making its sudden appearance, begin to twitch as well
>Why in god's name did your scent have this effect on these officers? Was it a human thing? Was it like this for all of the anthros you had been around?
>Your solemn musing on the subject was interrupted, however, by the sound of your front door's tumblers, indicating a need for a hasty retreat back to your bedroom, with just enough time to make it inside and quietly close the door as the staid tiger made his entrance to your abode
>Although you couldn't directly see the encounter, you could hear it well enough
>"Damn it man, what the hell are you doing?!"
>"H-huh?! What the...! I swear I didn't-"
>"It's bad enough we have Officer Mulholland on the case with us, the last thing we need is you doing this! It's our job to keep him safe and how is he going to feel safe with constant sexual harassment?!"
>Pretty rich coming from the guy who arrested you for discovering the great shoe heist...
>"But I told you, I didn't-"
>"Enough! Where is Anon now?"
>"I think he's s-sleeping in his room-"
>You heard the quiet pitter-patter of digitigrade paws making their way to just outside your room
>You normalized your breathing and pretended to be asleep as you saw the piercing green eyes of the tiger and the quivering blue of the wolf peek in through the door

![Image description](https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1630/17/1630174840036.jpg)

>"... good, you didn't ruin everything for a second time."
>"I-i'm sorry! I swear I didn't-"
>"Enough. Go home, crank one out, take a long, cold shower and get some sleep. If you and the other canines can't keep it in your pants i'm going to have to suggest to the chief that we reconsider the staffing of this entire operation."
>A small whine of protest could be heard from the wolf as the door closed
>So Mr. Stripes fancies himself a consummate professional, huh? And yet he was still just as complicit in everything as his canid coworkers...
>Time to see how far you can push him until he cracks, too
>As revenge for arresting you, of course
>The next morning, the Tiger was posted in his usual sentry spot near the junction of the living room and kitchen, head held high, hands behind his back, looking at you
>Without a word, he would usually salute you and then go back to staring intensely at your living room wall
>This morning though, the gym towel was still there on the couch next to him
>... neatly folded into a square
>He noticed that you noticed and for a second a flash of worry appeared on his face
>"Something wrong, Anon?"
>...
>"Not at all, officer. But you see, I was intending to go to the gym today, but if I recall, I am to be supervised 24/7, no? I happen to recall... that you are a member of the same gym, are you not? Perhaps you'd be able to accompany me?"
>Another flash of worry, more pronounced this time, appeared on his face before he quickly corrected it
>"Ah, yes... I had forgotten."
>Yeah right you did, it just struck you that there was only one person who could have stolen your undershirt! Looks like you've got a very naughty kitty on your hands, and a hypocritical one, too!
>"V-very well. I can accommodate this. Shall we be off, Mr. Anon?"
