>Be anon
>Be married to beautiful Doberwoman
>Live together in small town near the city
>One day receive a large package in the mail
>She won't tell you what it's for, only that it's a surprise
>You shrug it off and put it in the back of your mind
>A week later, she asks you to follow her into the bedroom
>As you enter, you are shocked to find a wide array of fetish gear on the bed; collars, leashes, muzzles, a bag of puppy treats, and even a dog bowl
>Dumbfounded, you look to your wife for an explanation.
>She explains that she wants your sex lives to take a kinky turn
>She's been reading online about petplay and how it's the latest sex craze
>Asks you to partake in some some roleplay with her with you being the master and her being the pet
>You're to tell her no when she gives you those adorable puppy eyes canines are famous for
>You sigh and agree to play along
>She squeals in excitement and runs off to put on her lingerie
>While she's getting ready, you take the time to inspect the sextoys
>The collar is a typical dog collar, colored bright pink, with a single white stripe running across it
>Attached to the collar is a metal tag reading, "If found, please return to Anon."
>The leash is black leather, and appears to be of very fine quality
>The dog bowl seems to be custom-made, with her name in printed out in big black letters
>The dog treats are in fact, normal biscuits meant for human and anthro consumption
>After waiting around 15 minutes, your wife finally returns, wearing black lingerie
>"Puppy is ready to be trained, Mister Anon" she says in a cutesy-style voice
>You pick up the collar from the bed and fasten it around her neck
>You decide the best way to start the roleplay session is by having her do some tricks
>"Sit, girl" you stammer; she immediately complies, sitting on her knees
>You reward her with a dog biscuit which she eats out of your hand
>"Paw!" she sticks out her hand, which you grab
>"Shake" she again completes the action, which you reward by placing a treat in her mouth
>You repeat this with other phrases like "Play dead" and "Rollover"
>Soon you've run out of phrases
>You pour a handful of treats into the dog bowl and place it in front of her
>"Stay" you order in a stern tone
>You pull out your smartphone and set the timer for 5 minutes
>She fake-whimpers and squirms impatiently as the clock counts down
>Eventually the waiting is too much for her and she just begins eating the treats
>"Oops, I ate the treat before I was supposed to. I'm such a naughty puppy" she giggles
>"Bad doggies need to be disciplined", she says in a cutesy tone, motioning for you to continue
>You sit down on a chair and order her to crawl on top of your knees; she complies and you begin her punishment
>At first it's just light slaps on the ass, but then she mutters under her lips "Harder"
>You begin spanking your wife with much more power put into it
>She's moaning in a mixture of both pain and ecstasy
>After a good 5 minutes of spanking, you finally stop
>She crawls on top of the bed and collapses, panting and drooling in pleasure
>After a few minutes of silence, she finally speaks
>"Oh my god, this is amazing."
>"I guess" you reply, lying on top of the bed with her
>"Yeah. But it can be even better."
>"Sure thing, honey," you say, hugging her from behind
>Fast forward to tomorrow
>It's the weekend, and neither of you have any work today
>You're sitting in the living room, watching the news when your wife walks in, wearing a tank top, some running shorts, and the collar fastened on her neck
>She's holding the leash in one hand, and a ziplock bag full of treats in the other
>She looks excited and somewhat nervous
>"Umm, puppy needs her excercise, so I was hoping, you could, umm, t-take me for a w-walk at the p-park?" she stammers
>You stare at her for a few awkward seconds
>"What happens when people see us?"
>"We can tell them it was just a dare. Besides, both of us work in the city, it's not like any of our coworkers will see us."
>You can think of several reasons why her reasoning is flawed, but now she is giving you those irresitable puppy eyes
>You sigh and give in, getting up from the couch
>It's not like you'll be doing anything else today anyways
>You take the treats bag and stuff it into your pocket
>The two of you then get into your car and drive to the park in the center of town
>Once there, she hands you the leash, which you attach to her collar
>Once that is done, you begin your stroll around the park with you holding her leash
>Surprisingly, the park isn't very busy today, so at least not many people will be witness to this
>Even still, you can see and feel people staring at you
>Many humans have looks of confusion and bewilderment on their faces, while several anthros appear angry and disgusted
>Parents are covering their children's eyes while shooting dirty looks
>The sight of a fit anthro Doberman being led around by a human man is probably a pretty shocking sight to most people
>Your face is blushing bright red from embarrasment
>The both of you jog several laps around the park before you suddenly hear a shriek of anger behind you
>You turn around to see a short male cat fuming at you
>"What's big idea, asshole?" he hisses "What are you, some kind of human supremacist who gets off on degrading anthros?"
>You try to stammer out some kind of explanation, but he cuts you off
>"You make me sick" he says, pulling out his phone, probably to post your transgression on the internet, "treating anthro women like this. Anthros are not your-"
>"Hey dipshit! I'm right here! I'm a person too!", your wife suddenly shouts angrily
>The cat's tone suddenly changes, frightened by your now infuriated wife
>"I-I'm s-sorry m-ma'am, I th-thought that-"
>"You thought what? That you'd interrupt a couple's day out by harrassing them?" she snarls "For your information, this whole thing was my idea!"
>She's very angry now, baring her teeth at the now terrified feline
>"I'm s-sorry ma'am. I-it won't happen again" he squeaks out, backing away slowly
>"It better not. Now fuck off" she growls
>You have never seen a cat tear off as fast as he did
>"Anon, I'm tired. Can we please take a break?" your wife says, switching back into a playful voice
>You both take a sip from the water fountain before sitting down at a bench
>"Umm, Anon, I'm very hungry, can I have some treats please?"
>You pull the bag out your pocket and place a few biscuits in your palm; she happily begins eating out of your hand
>Afterwards you spend the next hour relaxing on the bench, cuddling together and watching the fish and ducks in the pond
>Your wife breaks the silence by asking you if you're okay with a few more laps around the park; you agree
>Afterall, your reputation with the townspeople is already at rock bottom, it's not like it could get any worse at this point
>You both get up from the bench; however your wife doesn't stay standing for long, as she gets on her hands and knees and begins crawling like a feral dog
>You are going to probably die from embarrassment by the end of the day
>The two of you walk around the park for about half an hour, before finally deciding to go home
>It's now nighttime
>You and your doberwife are now lying in bed, about to go to sleep
>She turns to you with a smile on her face
>"This was such a wonderful day, Anon, we should do this every Saturday!"
>You smile and embrace her as you close your eyes
