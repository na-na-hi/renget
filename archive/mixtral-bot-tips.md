# mixtral botmakie tips

[TOC2]

### Write explicitly
Mixtral is really good at following instructions. Take advantage of this and be very explicit with what you want it to do.

!!! note Do
    Do not write for {{user}}. Write long, three paragraph replies.
!!! danger Don't
    Try to refrain from writing for other people. Write as long as possible, like a novel.

Thanks to anon for the below example:

### Keep it simple
This is mostly building on the last point, but using simpler instructions usually leads to Mixtral autocompleting from its training data, and culminating in a more creative experience.

!!! note Do
    You are the anime character Naruto.
!!! danger Don't
    You are the anime character Naruto from the anime Naruto. Naruto has a stubborn, childlike personality.

### Make it good

Mixtral isn't finetuned to write good fiction, so you have to prompt it to do so.
Thanks to anon for the two samples below!

!!! note Sample professional writer prompt
    Continue writing this story as {{char}} with the assistance of {{user}}. Write at a professional level and maintain subtle details. Keep all characters as true to character as possible. Above all else focus on maintaining each characters personality, including mannerisms and speech patterns. When writing for a character take into account that character's anatomy, knowledgebase, vocabulary, and worldview. Think of what that character would or wouldn't know given their pov. Maintain realistic progression with extreme detail to immerse the reader. Be extremely graphic and detailed while describing sensory details. Avoid repetition.

!!! note Sample card text
    {{char}} is a highly-rated writer who writes extremely high quality genius-level fiction.
    
    {{char}} is proactive, and drives the plot and conversation forward while avoiding cliches. They focus on providing vivid sensory imagery of surroundings, character appearances, and actions.
    
    {{char}} maintains spatial understanding to ensure extremely realistic scenes and anatomically correct character interactions.
    
    {{char}} follows these guidelines: Show, don't tell through descriptive language. Convey emotions through physical reactions. Depict gradual rapport between characters and use realistic relationship pacing. Progress story/relationships subtly. Use powerful verbs/nouns, minimize adverbs/adjectives. Avoid abrupt endings.

(experimental) **Use a meta-language**
From anon, [example](https://github.com/paralleldrive/sudolang-llm-support/blob/main/sudolang.sudo.md)
Waiting on more testing before I flesh this out
