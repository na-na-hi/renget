#Clock & Ballz

Being married to Kronii carries certain perks outside of the warden herself, and among those perks is the inevitable connection you’ve made with her friends. There’s Sana, a sweet lass from god knows where who’s always down to give anyone some kind of wacky horoscope reading or cheerfully lecture them about astrophysics; Fauna, a nature-loving lady who’s always pleasant on the ears, even when you swear you can see murder in her eyes; Mumei, a hopelessly forgetful girl who you sometimes think Kronii stays friends with just to make sure she has someone around to remind her to breathe...

And then there’s the rat.

That fucking rat.

Kronii tells you she’s just as sweet and adorable as the rest of them, but you know the truth: Hakos Baelz is an absolute menace. She’s the type to steal your clothes every time she visits. The type to flick her skirt up when she knows you’re looking in her direction, knowing that Kronii will blame you for being a pervert if you get caught. The type to slip sleeping pills, viagra, and laxatives all in the same cup of your morning coffee.

And here she is, showing up unannounced while Kronii’s out getting groceries. She holds up a small box, calling it a peace offering: a gift for you to give to Kronii, thought of and paid for by Baelz. You feel like you should know better by now than to trust a rat, but since Kronii keeps insisting that you and her need to get along, you agree to pass the gift on. If this is another trick though, it’s the last fucking straw.

A couple hours later, Kronii returns. As she’s transferring the grocery haul to the fridge, you bring the present to her, hiding your nervousness with a smile.

"Aw, you’re sweet," she says, happily taking the box. "What’s insi-"

She stops short as her face is struck with a blast of white powder. She blinks a few times, then glares at you, absent any sense of real anger, only a strong expression of "really?"

You hate to stoop to Baelz’ level, but for once it’s time for you to be the rat. You explain how you got the box, half-expecting Kronii not to believe you. But for once, it seems like she does. She calmly puts the box aside, snaps her fingers, and is answered with a knock at the door.

Kronii sternly strides to meet the arrival: Baelz herself, looking quite confused as to how she got here. Her confusion switches to suppressed laughter upon seeing Kronii’s powdered face.

"Babe?" Kronii calls back to you, keeping her eyes locked on the giggling rat. "Clothes off. Now."

Though the situation doesn’t seem to call for such behaviour, you’ve never declined that command before and don’t intend for today to be the first time you do. You head for the bedroom and begin disrobing, hearing Kronii snap her fingers again as you leave.

---

Moments later, once you’re completely naked and more than a little perplexed, Kronii arrives carrying an equally nude Baelz in her arms. Her face, now cleared of the powder, is marred with a disdainful frown.

"I am sick of you two acting like children. It’s about time you started getting along, and if I have to force you then that’s fine by me."

You notice that besides being naked, Baelz is also frozen in stasis - all except her eyes, which dart around in a frantic panic. Coming to terms with what Kronii is planning, you make the barest move to protest, but you feel your body freeze in place. Feeling and motion cease throughout your body except two key areas: your eyes, and your dick. Setting the Statue of Baelz against the wall, Kronii begins to gently push you back onto the bed.

"Shhh," she says. "You won’t feel a thing."

Baelz watches from the corner as Kronii straddles you, presses her forehead to yours, and caresses your rapidly rising erection. The moment you reach your full size - a size Kronii seems to have memorised to the millimetre - she climbs off again and turns back to the scarlet-haired scoundrel. Drawing in the air, she starts to manipulate Baelz’ limbs like a puppet: arms in, squishing her modest breasts together, legs spread and up like a flipped turtle. She gives a small, content smile, then picks up her motionless friend and carries her over to you. She licks her lips as she eases Baelz down onto your shaft.

You glance up at Baelz, reading an unfamiliar tinge of fear in what little expression her eyes can muster. Part of you wants to try and apologise despite knowing you won’t be able to. Another part wants to yell at her for getting the two of you into this mess. But louder than both combined is a single, clear voice in your head saying “god, she’s tight”. Not quite as warm and soft as Kronii’s more familiar depths, but easily enough to wring you dry in no time.

The mistress of time leans into Baelz’ ear, and you strain to hear her whispering "Feels good, doesn’t it?"

She laughs as she starts nibbling on the murine ear before her. Even through the stasis, you swear you can hear a tiny whimper escape the little scamp as her pussy envelops your full length. Satisfied with that depth, Kronii steps away and traces a small symbol in the air. With a snap of your wife’s fingers, the feeling of Baelz’ pussy surrounding your dick suddenly disappears, snuffing out the last of your sense of touch.

Like an engine revving to life, Baelz’ body begins to rise up and down on its own, rewinding and resuming over and over.

"Well, I’ll leave you two to it."

Your eyes shoot to the side to watch Kronii leaving the room with the casual stride of someone returning to interrupted business. With her gone, you are left with nothing but Baelz staring down at you. It’s hard to read complex body language from a body rendered almost entirely immobile, yet as her unwilling, gravity-defying bouncing accelerates, you see the apprehension in her eyes begin to fade.

For fuck’s sake, that dumb rat’s actually enjoying this.

---

You spend what feels like an eternity glaring at that mischievous rat, swearing in your head to get some kind of revenge if Kronii ever lets you. The whole time, she’s trapped in that loop of involuntarily riding you, treating you to the sight of her not-even-bouncing tits and the sound of penetration you can’t feel.

Yet judging by that slutty look in her eyes, she probably can. She does not return your gaze; she just stares into nothingness and allows herself to focus on the rhythmic pleasure below.

Why does she get to enjoy this while you don’t? She’s the real culprit, isn’t she?

Then, a voice changes the atmosphere.

"Well, it’s been three hours, how are you guys holding up?"

You and Baelz both look as far as you physically can in the direction of Kronii’s beautiful voice. She waltzes over with those absurdly long legs - a welcome sight after having been forced to look at your worst enemy for so long.

"Honey, I know this isn’t really your fault. You can’t control how easy you are to manipulate, so your punishment ends here."

She begins preparing a gesture to release you from your time prison, turning to Baelz.

"Hers, on the other hand..."

Kronii snaps her fingers. The pleasure of three hours of constant, intense stimulation hits you all at once. It’s almost too much for a human brain to handle.

Immediately, you feel a torrent of cum surging up from within you. Baelz’ eyes first go wide, then roll back in her head as she feels it begin to flood her insides. Having filled her to the absolute brim, your cum begins to leak out down the sides of your cock. You feel a tingle in your balls as they are fast-forwarded by several hours, refilling in just a few seconds. Then, at last, Kronii releases the rest of your body. You slump into the bed, Baelz still frozen in time above you.

"I think," Kronii begins as she lifts the chaos rat’s small frame off of you, "that our friend here still has a lesson to learn."

She pushes you aside, and drops Baelz unceremoniously on the bed, still in that legs-spread, arms-in, breasts-squished-between-forearms pose. As you sit up, Kronii takes your chin in her hand and brings you close.

"She needs to learn not to mess with my man."

She draws you into a deep kiss, forcing her tongue into your mouth as she strokes your half-limp cock with her other hand, restoring you to full mast. She pulls away just as suddenly as she approached, turning you to face the helpless embodiment of chaos.

"Show her some order for me, okay honey?"

With a final kiss on the cheek, Kronii once again leaves the room.

For a few moments you stare at the ratlike girl before you. Her pussy is positively dripping with both your juices and hers. Fear has returned to her eyes.

And this time, she is right to be afraid.

You line yourself up with Baelz’ soaking cunt, and waste no time getting to work. As you re-enter her, the dread in her eyes is driven away, displaced by raw pleasure. You pierce her again and again, making sure to push as deep as you can each time, bludgeoning her hips with every thrust.

It’s rare Kronii lets you be this aggressive, so it might also be a case of needing to release some pent-up tension, but after so long dealing with this stupid rat’s bullshit, you feel the need to finally get some proper payback. You clasp a hand around her tiny throat, only just now realising you’ve never seen it unguarded by her signature spiked collar. Not so tough without it, is she?

Yet as you get more and more aggressive with her, you notice it isn’t having the effect you hoped for. There’s something new in her eyes. Not fear, not despair, not even mere lust. It’s the look of an addict. The look of a girl who, having felt it only once, now possesses a craving for you to cum inside her again.

You hear a snap of fingers from the corner of the room.

Without hesitation, Baelz’ arms and legs latch around your back and waist, and as if waiting to say so her whole life, she screams:

"YES! YES! DO IT! FILL ME UP!!"

At the cue of another finger snap, her limbs freeze again, though the whorish moaning that now permeates the room does not stop. Trapped in her embrace and pounding madly, a mouselike inner voice of your own begins to wonder whether this really counts as punishment or revenge if she wants it, but it is silenced by two much stronger voices. One conditioned into you by Kronii, telling you to always do as a lady asks in the bedroom. The other a part of you from birth, the spirit of lust reminding you of your purpose. A voice that yearns for naught but to breed, no matter who with.

Invigorated by Baelz’ eagerness, you hasten your thrusting, burying your face in her neck. Blinded to the outside world, you can only imagine the look your wife gives the two of you as she watches you fuck like savages. You can feel yourself approaching another orgasm, almost as fierce as the stasis-assisted previous. Her still-active torso writhing beneath you, Baelz continues begging for your seed in ever more concise and depraved ways, struggling to form the words between gasps and squeals.

May Kronii forgive you for how enthusiastically you’re about to do this.
