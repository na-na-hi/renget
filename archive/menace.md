hai im queency quincy whatever,,
co-host of symbiosis im 16 uh n im a faceclaim of yoshiko tsushima from love live

we arent that distinct, we are very diffused u cant tell if its me or some shit as we cant tell who is who either in front but i promise u im sillier than rem like in an odd way bc rem actually likes more of darkish stuff while i like pink so if we ever start talking rambling about how much we love pink thats def me (ien sort of likee vintage-y retro vibes thats very him)

entp 6w5 i think uhhsojdkfnfk my interests are like girls... i hatw men with hatred (⁠｡⁠・⁠/⁠/⁠ε⁠/⁠/⁠・⁠｡⁠) im a lesbian just lesbian but im a girl im a girl guys so ye use she/her

like said earlier im slightly sillier in terms of silliness than umerem im also not that creative enough i have no creative juices whatsoever,, also im the one who uses fancy stuff like kaomojis n obv has typing quirks. we dont have actual distinct personalities just rely on clues 

tbh im a tadbit more of a pick me girl im promising u im trying to get rid of it

UHHHHHJJ SO YEAH BYE
