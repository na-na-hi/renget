“Hmph… This is the last rabbit…”
The werewolf lazily finished off the last bit of meat off the bones before tossing it aside. She sat alone in the room of a long abandoned fortress deep in the forest. Some simple cloth wrapped around her breasts and hips and the thick, silver fur covering her body served as her only protection against the night cold.
“If I don’t get some more food… Rrff?”
Her ears perked up and her nose twitched.
“Hmm, this smells like… a human… child? Perfect… It will be a while before I’ll need to hunt again.”
She got closer to the fortress’s window and waited for her pray to come closer.

A small figure walked a hurried pace down a narrow path. Perhaps they were seeking to quickly leave these woods, where monsters were said to live. A red hood covered their face, obscuring their features. However, their lips as red as their hood would make one think it’s a young girl.
“I know you’re here…”
Even as they felt the presence of a monster nearby, the figure continued at the same pace. Underneath their cloak, their hand gripped onto something tighter.
“Come on… I’ll take you anytime…”

The werewolf climbed to the top of the fortress. She looked down into the forest below, her mouth watering in excitement. She let out a growl.
“It’s not everyday that such delicious prey just walks into my mouth…”
She decided it was time to strike. She used all four limbs to run down the side the fortress towards the human. When she approached the ground, she leaped forward with her front claws extended as she let out a howl.

“...Found you!”
In an instant, the red cloak flew back and something jumped out from underneath onto the assailant. It was a lasso that quickly wrapped around her neck. As soon as it snared her, her movement became sluggish and imprecise. Not missing a beat, the human jerked back on the rope, sending the werewolf’s body crashing into the ground.

“Shit!? Gyah!? Why can’t I… Aaahh!”
She tried to rip the rope from her neck, but despite her sharp claws the efforts amounted to nothing. Strength continued to leave her body until she was unable to even stand. The human child walked over leisurely and kicked her to the ground before pinning her down.

The child looked over the her body and let out some words of admiration.
“Oh… I’ve been a hunter for quite a while, but this is the first werewolf I’ve seen that’s so cute…”
His voice sounded innocent, but his expression was cold.
“It’s nice to meet you, miss werewolf. My name is Kurz. Did you think I was a girl? People often say that to me. Even though no boy would be happy to hear that. And on top of that, a run-in with a monster left my growth stunted by magic.”
His red lips distorted into a smile.
“So I work to hunt them down. Can’t move? Of course not. That rope has been blessed and infused with silver thread.”

There werewolf growled back.
“So what! I don’t care who you are, I’ll bite your- Kyah! What are you doing!?”
Her angry barking turned into a bitch’s yelp in response to the human grabbing her soft, furry breast. She struggled to get away, but the silver threads left her powerless to do anything except whine.
He then took out a collar and quickly placed it around her neck before removing the rope and stepping away from her. She felt just as sapped of energy as before, making it clear that the collar was enchanted with silver in the same fashion.

The werewolf struggled on the ground, making growling noises while trying to remove the collar to no effect.
“Grrr… Take this off!”
As if lost for any other options, she let out a loud howl, one normally used to call for help from males of her species. However, there were no others around to come to her aid.

The hunter approached the werewolf again and started to grab her.
“Is that your den over there?” he said in reference to the nearby fortress.
He softly picked up the werewolf’s body and started to carry her away. It seemed he had considerable power in contrast to his small and slender frame. He carried the struggling werewolf into the fortress before tossing her onto what appeared to be simple bedding.

She growled pitifully on the floor.
“I can’t move… By a human child...”
The power of the collar in addition to her struggling had left her limp and heavy. She sulked on the simple mat made of fur and cloth that stunk of wild animal.

“It looks like you live alone… That’s works out great then, given I’ll be staying here for some time. I’ve never gotten such a cute one before.” He said as he started to remove his clothing.
The werewolf questioned him, not yet understanding what was going on.
“Some time? What are you planning? Aren’t you going to kill- Gah!”
The hunter’s crotch became bare, causing his large dick that was ill fit his small frame to spring out. He quickly got on top of her and tore the cloth from her chest, giving him access to her nipples. As his mouth made contact, her fur stood up and she yelped in shock.

“There’s no need for you to worry. I’m not planning on killing you…”
The boy lifted his face up to speak as he used both hands to continue to play with her large tits.
“You know… Werewolves have a hard time getting pregnant. And the period in which female werewolves are in heat is extremely short… That’s why some people thought up a nicer way to take care of our werewolf problem. Just capture the female werewolves and knock them up. Werewolf blood will grow thinner and thinner, and your numbers will continue to drop. Isn’t that so much better than killing them and starting up a cycle of revenge?”
As he spoke, his hard cock pushed up against her crotch.
“That’s why you’re going to have my baby… That’s the contract this time. ...The fur around your pussy feels nice and soft. I’m sure your insides will be even better.”

“Wh- what? I… I don’t want to have a human baby… Ah!”
The werewolf’s nipples stiffened between his fingers. He had caught her while she was right in the middle of her heat. She tried struggle, but lacked the fire to even growl properly at him. On the contrary, her fear at the idea of getting raped only stoked her arousal further, her body betraying her to please her assailant.
“I won’t… By a human… Awoooo….”
She let out a pitiful howl. Her soft pink flesh revealed itself from beneath her fur, letting out the pungent smell of a bitch in heat. His penis kissed her entrance.

“This isn’t normally an exciting job, but a pretty wolf like you makes things different… Shit, I’m so turned on. I might be here a while.”
He pulled her legs apart and ripped the remaining cloth from her hips. He then grabbed his engorged dick and pressed it up against her as if searching for a spot hidden beneath her fur. His movements became more frantic as if the werewolf’s wild smell was putting him into his own heat.
“Where is it…? Ah, right here…”
Finding her wet entrance, he forcibly pushed his way inside.
“Ah… It’s warm… And so tight… This is what wolf pussy feels like.”

“Rrrff! ...Grrruuu!? It’s inside… Awoooo…”
The beautiful werewolf found herself wrapped around the hunter’s thick cock. Her body stiffened as her walls were forced open by a dick that put any werewolf to shame. Her pussy twitched and leaked juices, trying to accommodate the foreign penis. Despite being raped by a male of another species, it was as if they fit perfectly together. Her body become more relaxed as she was left helpless to do anything other than accept him. Her breath growing heavy as her tongue fell from mouth and hung loosely outside her snout.

Even with all he had experienced before, the hunter had never imagined fucking a fluffy woman could feel so good. He shoved himself into her as far as he could, then paused his movements. She held her closer to feel her - the softness of her fur and breasts, the hardness of her muscles, the warmth of her body.

“Amazing… Human women just can’t compare… And is looks like you’re enjoying it too.”
Even her raw breath just turned him on more. He pulled himself back briefly before slamming back into her. He restarted his movements in more violently than before. The wet sound of meat echoes throughout the dark room of the fortress. He felt like he could melt inside her.

The werewolf could only huff and moan. As she looked at the boy and hugged is small body, motherly instincts started rise inside her.
“Inside, it feels so… Rfff…”
His dick was hitting the entrance to her womb over and over. As if stoked by the instinct to have her own child, her pussy squeezed harder. The room became filled with the smell of her heat and the sound of her wolf cunt sucking on his human cock. Between her panting howling she was able to vocalize her feelings.
“More, I want… Hngh! Please, exterminate my race with your dick…”
The feeling of guilt in inviting her own species’ demise mixed with her arousal and sent her closer to the edge. Her pussy clamped down tight enough that one could see a visible outline of his dick.

The hunter could feel they were bound to orgasm soon. He stopped. It would be a waste to end it like this. He pulled himself back and removed his dick from the werewolf’s pussy.
“You’re a wolf aren’t you? So you should be getting fucked on all fours.”
As she could barely move herself, he grabbed her by her hips and flipped her over. He grabbed a hold of her round ass and squished it around in his hands. He could clearly see the wet hole he had just been using underneath her tail. Holding her tight, he rammed his dick back deep inside her.

“It almost seems like a waste to wipe out a race with a woman this good. But I’ll be sure to see it though that all werewolf bloodlines are destroyed, starting with yours.”
He took a hold of her tail with one hand and her breast with the other. He pushed faster and deeper than ever before.
“You understand? Until you’re carrying my baby, we’re going to be doing this… every… single… day…”
The werewolf could only pant and make happy dog noises in response. Her front paws planted themselves into the ground and her tail wagged back and forth. With each thrust her cunt squeezed as if trying to service his cock, her cervix kissed the end as if not wanting to let go.

“Here I come… inside...”
The twitching of his dick made it known that he was approaching his limit. The boy jerked his hips forward one last time, hugging the beautiful werewolf against himself. With that he stopped and started to spurt his warm seed inside her.
“Awoooooooooo!!!”
She reached her own peak as she let out a howl. Her body arched and went stiff. Her womb happy accepted all the cum pouring inside her. An ovum that had originally been there for another wolf was instead there to greet his human sperm, and in little time accepted the interspecies seed to form new life.

After a moment in which it felt time had stopped, the hunter popped his dick free from the werewolf’s pussy. Leftover white fluid overflowed from her open cunt. He moved to the side of her.
“Clean it up.”
He pushed his still hard dick up against the werewolf’s snout. After a short moment to sniff him, her large mouth opened to envelope his penis and sucked on it.

“That’s a good girl. It looks like we’re going to get along well together… By the way, what’s your name?” He asked, gently scratching the werewolf’s head while she sucked his cock.
She looked back with eyes that looked overjoyed. She briefly removed her dick to answer.
“It’s Sara…”
“Sara, huh… That’s a cute name for a cute wolf.”
He continued to feel up the fur all over her body. He could get enough of it. It was cute how she looked like she was enjoying herself.
“My name is Kurz. Nice to meet you.”

Having gotten it clean, Sara removed her mouth from his penis, her tail still wagging.
“I’ve never been called by my name much before… Nice to me you, Kurz…”
With that, she was overcome by exhaustion. She relaxed down on her bed and closed her eyes to sleep.
