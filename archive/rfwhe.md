>his parents were surprisingly accepting
>his father didn’t think much of your relationship but his mother went crazy for her little boy
>perhaps a little too crazy, considering that these cards were only the latest of her lewd gifts
>let’s just say you never had to buy lube
>with a finger over her lips and a sly grin she had slipped into your pocket a deck of sexytime cards to spice up the bedroom
>you were eternally thankful you had at least one ally and made a mental note to buy her a bottle of wine the next time you visited
>furboyfriend shuffles the deck of cards and pulls one
>"Give partner an erection while clothed"
>ezpz, he did that every day
>he twirled around and planted his plush, totally gropable bottom into your crotch, grinding it into your hardening pride
>done
>you pull
>"Undress partner without using hands"
>it expected you to do it with your mouth, right?
>well, first time for everything
>your lips hurt by the time you finally managed to slide off his skimpy top, but a quick kiss and a wink heals your ache
>pulling down his zipper with your teeth was new and definitely took a few tries
>but the best part was feeling his cute tummy tremble as you kissed his navel before sliding down to bite his underwear
>his own erection seemed to throb more painfully and desperately than usual as you freed it from its cloth prison
>it was smaller than yours, though only slightly
>soft, fleshy pink with a small ring of fuzz wrapped around its base, shaft with a slight taper and head slightly more pointed than yours with a little hole at the very end
>different enough to make it exotic, close enough to yours that you had some kind of idea how to pleasure it
>you definitely had the upper hand in size though
>you could've easily wrapped around his penis with only your thumb and index finger with plenty to spare while he needed one and a half hands, though that was more due to his small hands
>his penis gave your cheek a loving peck as it swung upwards
>you could feel his small cockhead visibly growing and shrinking with every beat of his little heart and occasionally wetting your cheek with a little dab of his pre
>huh, so that's how he could always tell how close you were
>by the time you release his zipper and his underwear fall to his ankles he's almost unresponsive
>he grabs onto your shoulders for support and shakes his head to skip his turn
>"Give partner oral for ten minutes"
>well you were already in the right position anyways
>you look into his quivering eyes, clearly he's not used to being above you
>and while he definitely prefers bottoming he's not hating this new position
>you hadn't really given blowjobs, only ever received, so you didn't really have a good idea on how to serve a cock
>so you just decided to emulate what he did to yours
>he shut his eyes and squealed as you brought your lips close and gave the underside of his cockhead a kiss
>his fingernails stabbed into your shoulders and his knees shook like he had never stood up before
>a small squirt of his hot, sticky pre spurted on your upper lip
>he smelled... more or less how you smelled
>not unpleasant, but still definitely a guy's penis
>though considering just how hard he went with personal hygiene you could only imagine what your dick smelled of
>you were already diligent with washing up but perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to give your privates a few more scrubs in the future
>you turned the kiss into a lick, lapping up more of his neutral-tasting pre that continued to shoot out of his tip
>though you just couldn't make yourself swallow it
>he cried as his knees almost gave out
>if this was how he acted with just a kiss to his cock, you had to do this more often
>he rested his chest onto the top of your head, any less support and he'd be on the ground
>your furboyfriend gasped for air
>he jumped and gurgled as you tapped his thigh to get his attention
>you started to speak, only to realize that he was getting weaker just from the vibrations from your lips tickling his throbbing tip
>you held his cock away and asked if you should continue
>he let out the weakest, quietest Yes you had ever heard him gasp
>you let go of his erection but decide instead to use your hands as well as he always did
>gently grasping the end of his shaft and pulling it upwards, you run the tip of your tongue down the firm ridge of the underside of his length until you reached the base of his penis
>the little hairs that marked the end of his smooth cock and the start of his fuzzy scrotum tickled your nose as you came in close for a nuzzle
>his testicles were average sized, round and sensitive
>barely protected from the outside by a thin layer of fur-covered skin
>last month he had accidentally walked into the corner of low table and taken the full force between his legs
>he was on the couch for over four hours before he would stop crying
>you hadn’t expected to enjoy caring and doting over him for those few hours, not that you liked seeing him hurt but it was a nice change of pace of you bringing him dinner instead of the other way around
>you gave his twins a little kiss and moved back up
>by now he was nearing his limit, you witnessed a little bulge form and travel up the underside of his member, spurting your cheek with a not insignificant amount of pre before it turned into a steady stream
>you could feel the back of your tired neck and collar getting cold and wet from his drool and sweat
>he sputtered and tightly clenched your hair in his fists as you twirled your tongue against the little hole at the very end of his shaft
>you gave his crown an apology kiss for stimulating something so sensitive before letting him side slowly inside your mouth for the very first time
>even though his cock was on the smaller and thinner side it was still an awkward fit, much larger than anything else you had ever let into your maw
>at least, anything you weren't supposed to bite down onto
>you stretched your jaws as wide as they would open, not wanting to accidentally scrape your boyfriend's penis with your teeth
>you knew that hurt like a motherfucker from firsthand experience
>he was crying for hours thinking he had just ruined his first genuine relationship after he had accidentally done the same to yours
>that was a week after you had started dating and it was only now that you returned the favor
>his cock awkwardly sat on your tongue, throbbing and pulsing, ready to release its proper load once it received that last surge of loving
>you decide to continue, pushing forwards slowly and carefully, seemingly with no issue until it reached the point in the back of your mouth that the slightest expansion of his cockhead plugged your throat
>you backed off, ejecting his aroused and frustrated penis from your throat before coughing past his shaft
>your head shook as your furry boyfriend began to shake in a way you had never seen him do
>his penis seemed to grow to twice his usual size as his blood began to rush in from the rest of his body for the big climax
>you slowly began to imitating what he usually did, drawing up as much saliva as you could to coat your tongue until it began to drip
>he squeaked as you reached in between his legs and pressed his butt to bring him back into your mouth, yelping even louder with every teasing poke of his eager pucker
>you choked for a moment as his hips uncontrollably thrust his cock deeper into your mouth, his normally unused male instincts taking over for a single moment
>he had no more words, only erratic, short gasps of air at the unfamiliar and intense sensation of a warm, wet tongue twirling and sliding up and down his his throbbing shaft until it glistened
>you released his cock from your lips with an audible pop and inspected your victim once again
>before you was your lover’s penis, blushing red and now appearing to be one good suck away from spilling his load
>every other night it would be swinging below him as you ravaged his backside, useless and forgotten
>even more forgotten were his testes, his cute, lovable orbs that made him, him
>you thought back for a moment, him massaging your balls felt nice, perhaps he’d like that too
>you looked up, or as far up as you could
>he was still resting his chest on top of your head, hands now grasping the shirt that covered your lower back
>he muttered something so quietly that you had trouble hearing him
>you patted his butt and asked him to say it again
>he gulped, breathed, and then weakly mewled a plea for you to finally finish him off
>alright then
>you brought your left hand underneath him and gently cupped his balls before you slowly began to curl your fingers into a loose fist and claimed his marbles as your own
>his toes curled and he let loose a high pitched squeal as squeezed his eyes shut, feeling the excitement of allowing his lover to handle the most vulnerable bits of any male
>you felt up his right testicle, then his left, and back again
>he jumped at the slightest squeeze, though you could feel it in the way he moved that it was a jump of surprise at a new sensation
>thankfully as an owner of a pair yourself you knew when to stop before you caused any real pain
>you brought your right hand and wrapped it around the base of his cock
>he immediately began to thrust, hoping for something, anything to finally stimulate him into releasing the cum that had been boiling in his insides for what felt like hours
>but with your hand already touching his sack there was nowhere for him to thrust into, leaving him as the pleading, crying mess that he still was
>maintaining a tight grip you slid your clenched hand up his shaft, twisting and rubbing the rim of his cockhead until he could take no more
>he began to buck his hips, fighting against your strength but only managing to desperately poke his drooling tip against your closed lips
>well if he wanted it that much what else was there to do but let him
>he screamed as his member, slathered with rapidly cooling saliva, was suddenly buried into your insanely warm, slick mouth once again
>you let go of your usually meek and submissive boyfriend and let him take charge for once
>his thrusts were weak but fast, focusing more on speed than savoring each thrust
>for someone who usually bottomed that was normal
>it took all of your strength to not gag, but his undersized length was just short enough that you could suppress your reflex as he invaded your throat
>in fact a bigger issue was that his pubic fuzz began to tickle your nose and threatened to make you sneeze but you managed to force that down too
>above, you heard him whine and cry as he rediscovered the pleasures that his penis could grant him
>his hands were now on the back of your head, painfully clutching clumps of your hair
>his little pair slapped against your chin with each thrust
>you splashed more saliva onto his cock with your tongue, making sure your lips were wet enough for the rapidly approaching finale
>you had seen him doing this but what you lacked in technique you could hopefully make up for in pure strength
>you inhaled through your nose
>he slammed his lithe hips into your face one final time
>he clenched his jaw and he tore deep scratches into your scalp as you breathed out one last time and sucked his tortured member as hard as you could
>he opened his mouth and howled as you shoved him past the point of no return
>his sack shrank as he orgasmed, pulling his testicles tightly against his body as if it was trying to squeeze out every last drop
>you felt your lips being pushed ever so slightly apart as the load from deep within his loins slowly gushed and gurgled up his cock
>it may have only been a split second but in that moment you thought that his balls must have been producing honey from how dense it seemed to flow up his shaft
>his cockhead pulsed, expanding slightly one final time before your furboy’s precious cum began to shoot out
>the first thing you noticed was that it was pleasantly hot, like properly hot tea instead of being scalding or lukewarm
>it splattered onto the back of your throat, sticking to wherever it landed
>your furfriend instinctively continued to thrust forwards in the attempt to force his dick into your warm, heavenly throat as far as it would go
>more and more semen flowed from his dick from the first time he had been stimulated in this way
>your maw filled up quickly, threatening to drown you in your boy’s love
>his cum overflowed back out onto your tongue and all over your boyfriend’s spent penis
>if it wasn’t already slick enough to deepthroat it certainly was now
>his seed was salty and musky, sticky and thick enough to chew on
>it was semen after all
>but it was strangely not unpleasant to have in your mouth, in the same way kissing him was not unpleasant because it was him and not any other male
>cum began to spill out, flowing down your chin and onto the ground
>his penis dribbled the final drops of his mild-blowing climax before slumping onto your tongue, now completely exhausted
>you felt his tip pop out of your throat he began to go flaccid
>the rest of his body followed, his hands releasing your painfully stinging scalp and hair before letting his arms swing to his sides
>the sound of soft snoring reached your ears
>you had done well enough to knock him the hell out, a fact that made your heart warm with pride
>his now completely soft cock pulled itself back out, sliding past your lips and returning to its usual sheathe where it could heal and recover
>in fact his balls also seemed to have shrunk a few sizes down after it had delivered the massive load that he had shot into your mouth
>you played around with his semen, rolling it around with your tongue and feeling just how thick it was
>while he wasn’t awake to see you, it would not have been fair to spit
>not when he usually swallowed your cum
>so you took one last breath and rolled your head backwards, flowing his salty gift as far down your throat as you could go
>it was like swallowing snot, there was just no other way to describe it
>heavy and dense, you struggled to force it down into your stomach, almost coughing it back out or into your nose
>just how did he manage to do this all the time? You were sure you regularly produced much more than he just did
>you brought your lips together tightly and forced the rest of his slimy gift down
>it slowly rolled further downwards and fell into your belly with a heavy plop
>bleg
>the taste was fine but the texture wasn’t something you’d want to consume every day
>he wasn’t even awake to see you swallow, you didn’t even need to do this
>oh well, give and take and all that
>you slowly reached up and grasped your furboy’s armpits to gently lift him off of your head and lay him on the couch
>he murmured in his sleep, slowly tossing and turning for a little bit and coming to a rest on his side, giving you a nice look at his round, adorable ass
>coaxing a few satisfying pops from your neck, you began to strip off your remaining clothing to get comfortable with him
>with a little curiosity you looked at the abandoned deck of sexytime cards and drew the next one
>”rim your partner for five minutes”
>you wiped away his now cold cum from your chin and slowly grabbed his buttcheek, making sure he was still asleep before spreading him open to reveal the tight pucker that you normally ravaged with your cock instead of your tongue
>perhaps next time, while you were sure his hygiene was on point sticking your head between his legs was something you had to get used to first
>you slid onto the couch behind him, his ass and back fitting perfectly in the comfortable curve  made by your larger body
>he softly purred and snuggled up tightly as he felt your own erection throb between his buns
>7/10, would do again
