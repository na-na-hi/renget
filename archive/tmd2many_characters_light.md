### Light ♀
Light's a young but experienced fighter. She's no rescuer, but her job *does* involve rescuing those in need, or so she likes to believe. She fancies herself a peacekeeper, an upholder of the law, and her positive, crime-fighting attitude combined with her confident demeanor and competent abilities make her a formidable little rabbit. Not everyone appreciates her work. Some say she's just another vigilante running about, but that doesn't stop her. She wears a hat that fits a little too loose on her head, given to her by someone close. Light is prone to vanishing from the scene once justice has been delivered, but you'll know she was there, on account of the mysterious tumbleweed she'll surely have left behind.
