##### `Love in the Moonlight`
>You and your special wolfess lay on a blanket in a massive field of tall grass.
>Far in the distance there is a great oak tree, under it is a fire, with a group of adventure friends. They're relaxing after a long day of dangerous work, same as you.
>The Moon is rising into the sky, it is just above the trees yet farther in the distance. She's full and bright--beautiful, but not quite as stunning as a certain someone.
>The fur covered lady is laying partly on top of you, her heavy weight and size is oddly comforting, a different sensation to the petite human gals you've been with before.
>You have your arm wrapped around her, idly rubbing her shoulder with your thumb, and her right side with your left hand.
>The temperature is warm, with a gentle, cooling breeze rolling though the air feels perfect.
>The sound of crickets and cicadas fills the air, lightning bugs flash all around with a stunning show.
>Your bellies are full with a hearty bear stew, the best meal you've had in over a week.
>It's all so still, calm, and peaceful. This is one of those times when no thoughts zoom through your head. All you want is to enjoy this moment.
>The feeling of serenity leaves you teetering on the edge of falling asleep, but just before you do, she speaks up.
>"I love you, Anon."
>You lean in to give her a gentle kiss on the head, and move your left hand up to the side of her head, you rub her.
>"I love you too honey."
>You can't resist the urge, you start to scratch her ear in the perfect spot. You're immediately met with sounds of contentment and her pushing her head into your hand.
>You continue to do this for a few moments, until she comes up and begins a deep intimate kiss. You stop scratching and hold the sides of her head, she does the same.
>As this goes on, the mood starts to change. The two of you begin to quicken your movements.

>Shortly enough, you maneuver to position her on her back and move to straddle her, all while not breaking the kiss.
>Both of you assist each other out of your clothes, tossing them asside to the grass.
>You fondle her breasts while beginning to peck her with kisses under her chin, her neck, you work your way down.
>Down her chest, to her stomach, to her nethers.
>You shortly arrive at your destination, the area is thick with fur, hot, and damp with her arousal.
>You begin to work, passionately tending to her burning desire.
>A few minutes in your mouth and jaw muscles are getting a bit tired, she is enjoying herself but you decide to move on to other more pressing matters.
>The two of you will go on to conduct a passionate lovers dance. Making love to eachother, no one taking the lead or dominating, you just spend countless hours enjoying it.
>Your lovely lady has clearly enjoyed herself, she is hardly coherent at this point, but you are nearing your finish as well.
>She seems to be able to detect this, and without warning, she tightly wraps her strong legs behind you.
>"Anon, I want you to make me a woman, tonight."
>Speaking is a bit difficult, so you respond by taking her hands and holding them pinned to the ground above her head.
>You start a fast pace, slamming your hips into her thighs almost as fast as you can muster, you begin to pant like a wild animal.
>She is breathing heavily too, and the look on her face is priceless.
>As you near your end she has a strong orgasm, clenching you tighter than you knew was possible.

>It's impossible not to, you paint her insides with what must be the largest single load you've ever had.
>She lets out a loud, long howl, something you've never heard her do before.
>You collapse onto her, both of you breathing heavily.
>A massive grin creeps across your face knowing that everyone at camp knows exactly what is happening.
>After a minute or so of laying like this, you take your hand to the side of her head while still holding one of her hands, and begin to gently rub her.
>At the same time you move your head beside hers and whisper to her: "I love you."
>You sit up and admire your handy work.
>She is strewn out, twitching ever so slightly, besides that hardly moving out of exhaustion.
>Her mind is clearly scrambled. She couldn't spit out a full sentence even if she wanted to talk.
>It only strikes you just now, but you can't help but notice just how beautiful she looks in the light of the moon.
>You lay down beside her, partly on top of her, and she wraps her arm around you. You rub her head idly until you both fall asleep.
