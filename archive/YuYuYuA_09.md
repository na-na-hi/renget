[Sometimes, Yuuna becomes a little sister]

Fuu: Itsuki, what would you like for tonight's dinner?

Itsuki: Hmm, we had curry until last night...

Fuu: Let's go with curry udon, then!

Itsuki: Let's choose something other than curry.

Yuuna: *stare*

Fuu: Let's go with something in season like saury then. Then, it may a bit too early for it to be in season, some stew.

Itsuki: I think I want stew more than fish...

Fuu: Okay, let's go with stew then. I'll go buy some ingredients before going home, so you go on ahead.

Itsuki: Okay.

Yuuna: *stare*

Tougou: What's wrong, Yuuna-chan? You've been staring at Fuu-senpai and Itsuki...

Yuuna: Ah, Tougou-san! I was actually observing both of them.

Fuu: Observing us? Hehe? You wanted to burn the intimacy of Shikoku's number one "girl power sisters" into your eyes?

Karin: "Girl Power Sisters" is something I can't see. Your intimacy is the real deal, though.

Sonoko: Yuyu, did something happen?

Yuuna: Recently, I got a request from the theatre club, and I ended up helping them out...

Tougou: Now that you mention it, they put in a request because they were short on hands.

Yuuna: Yeah. I thought I'd help out with props or scene-shifting, but I ended up with a role...

Tougou: I'll be coming to watch, Yuuna-chan.

Yuuna: Thank you, Tougou-san. So, my part is the protagonist's little sister...

Yuuna: But since I've had never had any siblings or sisters, so I thought I'd observe Fuu-senpai and Itsuki-chan since they're the ones familiar to me.

Sonoko: You're pretty serious about this, Yuyu.

Yuuna: So, Itsuki-chan! How does it feel like to be a little sister?

Itsuki: Ehh... erm... now that you ask me how it feels... I've been born as a little sister so it's pretty difficult to explain.

Karin: Little sister, eh? In the first place, there aren't may siblings or sisters that are close like Fuu and Itsuki.

Yuuna: Oh, you're a little sister too, Karin! Want to share your experience?

Yuuna: *stare*

Karin: S-Stop that!

Tougou: I-I'm not a little sister, so I can't be of any use to you, huh...

Yuuna: That's not true! Besides, you're more like an "older sister", Tougou-san. You give off a very mature aura.

Tougou: I'm Yuuna-chan's "older sister"!

Fuu: Nobody said that, though...

Sonoko: That reminds me: in the past, we had a game where Mino-san was the little sister and Wasshi was the older sister...

Sonoko: An idea! That's right, Yuyu. Rather than just observing, how about "real-life epxerience"? That way, I think you'll be able to understand the little sister role better.

Yuuna: "Real-life experience"?

Sonoko: Yes! From those of us with experience, let's choose who Yuyu will spend her day with as their little sister!

Tougou: Yuuna-chan will...

Karin: become a little sister?

Sonoko: For starters, try calling me "onee-chan". CALL ME "ONEE-CHAN", MY SISTER!

Yuuna: Erm... Sonoko-oneechan.

Sonoko: More, like a spoiled child!

Yuuna: Onee-chan!

Sonoko: Like a naughty, boyish little sister!

Yuuna: Y-Yo, big sis!

Sonoko: Like a diligent little sister!

Yuuna: Um, my dear elder sister, is this acceptable?

Sonoko: YES! Like this, Yuuna-chan will live like a little sister among those who have experience. That way, won't she understand a little sister's feelings?

Tougou: Yuuna-chan will become a little sister...

Yuuna: Mimori-oneechan, Mimori-oneechan!

Tougou: What's wrong, Yuuna?

Yuuna: I saw a scary movie, and now I can't sleep alone... Can we sleep together for tonight?

Tougou: Fufu, you're so easily scared, Yuuna. Sure thing.

Yuuna: Waai! Hooray!

Tougou: That's a great idea...

Karin: Yuuna... will become a little sister...

Karin: Overhead slash! Lower slash! Yaaa!

Yuuna: Karin-oneechan, Karin-oneechan!

Karin: What's wrong, Yuuna? Your older sister is training right now.

Yuuna: Yeah! That's why I thought that we should train together! I want to be the Perfect Hero like you!

Karin: Hm, the path ahead is rough. Will you still tread it?

Yuuna: Yeah! As long as I'm with Onee-chan, I'll do my best no matter what the training!

Karin: Not a bad idea...

Tougou: Ahem. I think that "Yuuna-chan's One-Day Little Sister Plan" is a great idea.

Tougou: But if she's going to act as a little sister, I believe that an older sister is needed. If nobody minds, shall I take the role?

Karin: No no no, I'm fine with that role, too.

Sonoko: Fuumin-senpai gets to be the older sister!

Fuu: Eh, me?!

Sonoko: That's because you're the one and only "Real Onee-san" among the Hero Club. Rather than anyone else, I think it would be better for s natural one to fill the role.

Karin: Muuu... I can't deny that.

Tougou: If it's Fuu-senpai... I have no choice but to withdraw...

Yuuna: So I'll become Fuu-senpai's little sister! Looks like it's going to be fun!

Sonoko: Right, right. Not only at school. Today you'll stay at her house and take your time with your little sister experience.

Fuu: Well, if you think of this as part of club activities, then I have no reason to disagree. I'm fine with it.

Fuu: If you're staying, make sure you tell your parents first, okay?

Yuuna: Okay!

Itsuki: B-But...

Sonoko: Don't worry. Don't worry, Ittsun. It's just for a day. You don't need to worry that your sister will be taken away from you, beacuse Fuumin-senpai's will always hold you as her most important one.

Itsuki: I-It's not like I had those worries...

Sonoko: By the way, if Yuyu is going to spend the night at Fuumin-senpai's, then how about staying at another place for the night, Ittsun?

The next day…

Yuuna: (And so, from this morning to the next, for 24 hours, I will be Fuu-senpai's little sister.)

Yuuna: A little sister's first day starts with going to school together!

Fuu: Yuuna, did you bring everything that you need for today?

Yuuna: I'm all right! ...is not right. If I'm her little sister, I shouldn't use formal language.

Yuuna: I'm okay, Fuu-oneechan! I properly check what I need to bring every morning.

Fuu: I don't think I'll get used to you calling me "Onee-chan", Yuuna.

Yuuna: Ahaha... me, too. But it's kind of refreshing and fun.

Fuu: Oh, Yuuna, move here. A car's coming.

Yuuna: Thank you, Onee-chan.

Fuu: It's dangerous, so make sure you stay on the sidewalk.

Itsuki: (On the other hand, I'll be Karin-san's sister for an entire day.)

Karin: For starters, we should go to school together, right?

Itsuki: Right...

Karin: Erm... also, you don't need to talk to me so formally.

Itsuki: Ah, you're... right, Karin-oneechan.

Karin: I can't get used to it... besides; I was technically a little sister back at home...

Itsuki: You're righ... yep.

Itsuki: Ah!

Karin: What's wrong?

Itsuki: I forgot to bring my English textbook!

Karin: Eh, really?! Can't be helped, let's go back and get it. I'll come along with you.

Itsuki: But if we go back now we might be late for school...

Karin: It’s fine, we'll make it if we run! Come one, let's go!

Itsuki: Okay!

Yuuna: Ah, Fuu-oneechan!

Fuu: Yuuna? What made you come up all the way to the third year classrooms?

Yuuna: Nothing, I was just passing by. By the way, a person from our class has a request for the Hero Club.

Fuu: Okay, make sure to bring it after class.

Yuuna: You got it, Onee-chan!

Yuuna: See you after school!

Fuu: Sure thing.

Girl Student: F-Fuu-chan... What’s with the "onee-chan"?! Since when was Yuuki-san your little sister?!

Fuu: Oh, no, that's not what it means... there's a story behind this, you see...

Girl Student: There's a complicated family situation, eh... All right, I won't ask any further!

Fuu: I think she's misunderstanding this...

After school…

Fuu: Today's Hero Club activities ends here! Take care on your way home, girls.

Yuuna: Okay!

Fuu: Umm, you're staying at my place tonight right, Yuuna?

Yuuna: You're ri... yup, Onee-chan! Because we're sisters.

Fuu: Let's go home together, then. I'm going to buy some things from the supermarket, you coming with? Or do you want to go home?

Yuuna: I'll come with!

Tougou: ...Yuuna-chan... I wonder what this is... it's like a wide hole is opening in my heart...

Sonoko: You'll be going home with me, Wasshi!

Tougou: Sonocchi...

Sonoko: Let's get some gelato along the way.

Tougou: Sure, lets.

Karin: Itsuki will be staying at my place, right? Let's go home?

Itsuki: Sure, Karin-oneechan.

Itsuki: Fufu. I think calling you Onee-chan is pretty fun.

Karin: I think I'm already used to me being called that, too.

Yuuna: Onee-chan, I'll help you prepare dinner.

Fuu: I'm fine, I'm fine. You can go watch some TV.

Yuuna: Ah... sure.

Fuu: By the way, Yuuna. Is there anything you don't like to eat?

Fuu: If there's anything, I'll cook something that doesn't use those.

Yuuna: I wonder if she always treats Itsuki like this? Itsuki is really loved.

Yuuna: Time to eat!

Yuuna: Mmmm... Delicious! Fuu onee-chan, you're really good at cooking!

Fuu: That's because of the King of Girl Power who's personally in charge of the Inubouzaki kitchen!

Fuu: Ah, you won't be able to reach this dish, right? I'll go get it for you.

Yuuna: Thanks, Onee-chan.

Fuu: I'll give you another helping of rice, too.

Yuuna: Mmmm... She’s so perfect... Amazing.

Yuuna: Thanks for the meal!

Yuuna: Onee-chan, let me help you tidy up and wash the dishes.

Fuu: Don't worry about such a thing. Let me do it. You can go rest, Yuuna.

Yuuna: Hmmm... I'll go heat the bath, then.

Fuu: I've already done it, so it's fine. Oh, you go ahead and take yours.

Yuuna: Eh?! You already made dinner and cleaned the dishes. Offering me to go first in the bath is...

Fuu: What are you saying? You're my little sister for today, right? A little sister isn't supposed to mind those small things.

Yuuna: So this is normal between Fuu-senpai and Itsuki-chan... Being Fuu-senpai's little sister is amazing!

Meanwhile, Miyoshi Karin and Inubouzaki Itsuki were...

Itsuki: Geh... Haaa... Fuuu....

Karin: Okay, running and 100 thrusts, done!

Itsuki: W-Why do I need to... haa, haa... take the same training as Karin-oneechan?

Karin: Itsuki. Your training here will surely be useful in the future. Believe in your big sister!

Itsuki: Y-Yeah!

Karin: Your high power output and judgment are really amazing. But since you're not used to exercise, so I think your stamina is lacking.

Karin: Stamina comes through continuous training! Continuation is power.

Itsuki: Haa... Fuu... Yeees.

Itsuki: Being Karin-san's little sister is pretty hard...

Karin: We'll have dinner after training. If you don't get your nutrients, you won't become strong, after all.

Karin: Our dinner is a pork cutlet bento! Dried sardines! Vitamin supplements! Amino acid supplements! Dried sardines!

Itsuki: That does look pretty packed with nutrients...

Yuuna: I'm done with my bath.

Fuu: Yuuna. I've prepared your textbooks and notebooks for tomorrow so you won't forget them.

Yuuna: Eh?! You went that far?!

Fuu: Eh? Isn't that normal?

Fuu: Whenever I leave it up to Itsuki, she always forgets something.

Yuuna: (S-She's too perfect.)

Fuu: Also, I've prepared the bed so you can sleep whenever you want to.

Fuu: She fell asleep in this room once and I had to carry her all the way to her bed.

Yuuna: Something like that happened...

Fuu: Ah, but you're not like that, huh...

Yuuna: (Fuu-senpai looks a little lonely!)

Yuuna: (But... it's so amazing to be her little sister... Even if I don't do anything and sit here, everything gets prepared!)

Yuuna: (It's like a king or nobility!)

Fuu: Hm? What's wrong, Yuuna?

Yuuna: Nah, it's nothing, Onee-chan!

Yuuna: ...Ah.

Fuu: What is it?

Yuuna: Aaaah! I forgot to do today's homework! There's a lot for math, too...

Fuu: It can't be helped. I'll tutor you so work on it here.

Yuuna: Eh, but you need to prepare for your exams...

Fuu: My little sister's studies are more important. Don't be so reserved, you're my little sister.

Fuu: This is around the part where you use systems of equations, eh? The trick behind systems of equations is to write the problem itself as such.

Yuuna: Okay... like this, and this... you're right, it's done!

Fuu: Right? Of course, I'm a third year so I should be able to at least teach second year math.

Yuuna: Ahh... it's amazing. This life where you entrust almost everything to Fuu-senpai...

Yuuna: It makes you want to be her little sister forever... but if I get too used to this, I feel like I won't be able to go back... it scares me a bit.

Yuuna: And this finishes... the last problem... I'm already... sleepy...

Yuuna: zzz... zzz...

Fuu: Ara, she fell asleep, eh? I guess I'll carry her.

Fuu: Hup... she's heavier than Itsuki, but a lot lighter than I expected.

Fuu: She looks like she can handle herself, but she's definitely still a child.

Fuu: Yuuna is very considerate. She always acts lively, but the truth is she observes everything around her and thinks of others more than anyone else.

Fuu: Compared to her body, her heart is very mature.

Yuuna: zzz... Fuu-oneechan... munya... I'll help... mn...

Fuu: Geez, looking out for others even in your dreams, eh? You don't need to worry about that.

Fuu: You can put yourself at ease. You can let other people spoil you, Yuuna.

Yuuna: ...Fuu-oneechan...

Fuu: I don't have to hold her hand much unlike Itsuki, but in her own way, Yuuna looks like she can also be a handful as a little sister.

Yuuna: (The next morning, the One-Day Little Sister Experience was over)

Sonoko: How was it, Yuyu? What were your thoughts on being Fuumin-senpai's little sister?

Yuuna: It was amazing!

Tougou: A-Amazing?! W-What was?!

Yuuna: It felt, really perfect!

Fuu: Really? Isn't that normal?

Itsuki: I have muscle pain today.

Karin: It's fine. Muscle pain is proof that your body is strengthening.

Karin: I'll give you some citric acid supplements. It should help with the muscle pain.

Itsuki: Yes. Thank you very much...

Yuuna: I was almost at the point where I wanted to really be Fuu-senpai's little sister and live together with her.

Fuu: You're welcome anytime, Yuuna.

Both: Eh?!

Itsuki: No, no! Even if it's Yuuna-san, I won't give up my position as Onee-chan's little sister!

Tougou: That's right! Living together is...

Tougou: (I even wanted Yuuna-chan to become my little sister!)

Yuuna: Ahahaha, I was just kidding.

Fuu: True, my hands are already full with Itsuki alone.

Itsuki: Uuuu... I'm not that much of a handful... I think.

Yuuna: That afternoon, I was able to perform the little sister at the play. Thank you, Fuu-oneechan!
