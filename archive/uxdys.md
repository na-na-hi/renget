## Preface

**It is these** Sheets of Parchment being inscribed which, upon me becoming seventeen Years of Age, my gruff Father, Noel A. Kaasaki, Seniorman of the Parliament of the People of Ahgeia, were thrust before my hands in the morning Hours, in the time before my Father's daily Visitation to the Ahgeian Forum.

My Father, always having a boorish Manner of speaking when in conversation with I, said thus: *"You have been granted an Education of reading and writing, yet you do not use it. If you wish to take my onerous Place, in due time, as an esteemed Member of the Parliament, you must write. Do so with these Papers. What you write does not concern me. Go."* With those parting Words, he bid me farewell, and departed for the Forum.

Hithertofore, my inhibited Thoughts and Expressions in regards to my Environment had no Residence besides the confines of my Mind. Henceforth, these Parchments, which I choose to divide into an arbitrary number of Entries, shall contain my profuse Musings and Expoundings of all Things I think of, as well as of my personal Experiences within the City of Ahgeia, a grand City I dub the greatest Centre of the World ever inhabited by Man.

## Entry 1

**A remarkable Gathering** of Foreigners in the City to-day. By the insistent Implorations of my caring Mother, I joined by the side of my Father in an ornate Event at the western Gate of the City, the Occasion of this Event being the Arrival of an Embassador with some status. I did not know whence this Embassador hailed from, but upon my asking to a nearby Companion of my Father, I was uncouthly rebuffed with the Reply that it was not my place to question such Matters.

Although a Crowd which had gathered near the Gate broke into a type of Fervour upon the Sighting of the Embassador, I was stricken by confusion, for the Embassador at first glance possessed no Indicator of any status at all, having only upon himself a rustic white Tunic with blue Stockings, every Article of Clothing stained or blemished in some way.

Behind the Embassador were what I can only describe as a Troupe of hollering Barbarians in much the same Garments with an even worse condition, only later learning that these were in fact his chosen Escorts. Hence at the Gate the two Groups became one in theory, a great Cacophony of uncultured rabble emitting from it, with the Origin of this Disturbance perfectly clear.

As we moved from the Gate to a Pub owned by my Father, the sour Odour of the Embassador and his Entourage became apparent to my Senses, which led me to discreetly recoil from the Centre of the Group. I must herefore commend the Resilience of the Parliamentmen, including my Father, as I have a want of Doubt that their Noses did not smell the alien Stench of the Embassador, yet they pressed on with Business, as an honorable Man ought to do.

The rest of the Event, if in hindsight it can truly be declared one, was a relatively trivial Meeting between them all; having no interest in discussing or overhearing the Matter of Politics with Men of such musky Scent, I quietly excused myself to my Father and left.

It is amusing, so says my Opinion, to treat Peasants as Embassadors, but alas! it is the case here. Later, I was informed that the Embassador and his rowdy Escorts originated from a Confoederation of minor Villages westward of the City, only a Mid-day's walk in Distance. This, perhaps, was a Strike to my metaphorical Cocoon regarding the World, for little could I imagine the state of any Polity where their Diplomats could have nothing more on them but a Tunic, let alone a Polity no less than a Journey the duration of a singular Day away.

All this then further affirms my Belief, that this City is a Beacon of Prosperity, one that all civilized Men strive to imitate, and that all uncivilized Men clamor to obtain, as the Encounter of to-day has so demonstrated.

## Entry 2

**If by the** Flow of Chance one were to, originating from the westerly Side of the Kom-Pher Building, travel northwards upon the paved stonen Bricks of the Mars Way, the unaware Person would soon enter the distinct Confines of the Upper Quarters, where the Aspirations of its indigent Enhabitants are generally even punier than their Domiciles. It is this Flow I must curse, for this very Flow was the Culprit behind giving me a Whim to, with full awareness, enter that Area which no Man of high Class would bother to tread.

Immediately upon my Entrance into the Upper Quarters, I was thereafter beset by many auspicious Glimpses from the Enhabitants, for my proper Appearance was improper to the Surroundings thereof, yet all knew I possessed much Wealth. A Voice, which may have crowed the same Words before my coming, began beseeching me to visit his Brothel House, boasting of its fine Harlots, which I deligently ignored, but perhaps childishly noted its Location.

At an Intersection of two noticeably worn Roads, I was approached by a thin, short Pauper, my first Interaction with any body within the Quarters. The Pauper, a swarthy Nizi, carried with him a Box the width of his Abdomen, painted a light red and fitted with a narrow Slot atop of it, his Intention obvious, believing me to be none the wiser.

"Sir, if you may!" As an Individual with the Virtue of Civility, I was obliged to hear his Plea. "Good sir, good sir, I hate to bother! but, please, would you be a good Man and provide a Donation of silver Coin to this Shrine of Anpetra? The Goddess would be surely pleased..."

This Pauper, surely, disregarding his probable Haeresy, provided much Amusement at his own Expense, reducing his ostensible Deity to a Vessel of Coinage! "Many good Omens and Blessings," the Beggar continued, "will come to you, only if you were to donate!"

I decided to humour the Nizi, making sure to stand tall and enunciate the formal Accent of the original Merchant-Tongue within my Speech of the common devolved vernacular. "Pray tell me, honourable Kannushi, I apologise for my rash Enquiry, but I am not certain where your Shrine may be."

The Expression of the Nizi then soured, his Tone gaining a Quality of Unenthusiasm. "Good sir, it is right here!"

Eyeing the Box, I replied back, making sure to maintain the Courtesy of the Exchange. "Pardon me anew, but I can not discern any Markings on that Box. Was it lost somewhere?" The Nizi, contrary to what I expected of a Beggar, merely looked down onto his Box with an aura of Defeat and Shame. "Looks can be deceiving, sir..."

Hereafter, a well of Pity pierced me, and I could not in good Conscience continue the Japery which had herebefore entertained my Sleight of Wit.

It was at this Instance a grand Idea formulated itself. The Pauper, his Hope bent upon a singular Coin of Silver, reacted with Incredulity upon the Sighting of a golden Coin, an Object with a hundredfold Value, situated upon the Palm of my Hand carelessly. Yet I did not give over the Coin straight away.

"I will indulge your Scheme, dear fellow, but first, you must swear to follow a sole Condition and imprint it within your Heart, never to forget it."

The Nizi, now salivated, nodded his Head with Vigour. "Yes, sir, anything sir!"

There was some Difficulty, I fully admit, to contain a Composure of Neutrality, but if I had ever faltered in this Regard, the Nizi did not seem to observe it, or simply ignored it, raptured by the numerous Pleasantries, all of them doubtlessly base and shameful, my Coin could provide him with.

"My Condition, the Oath I urge you to remember for all your days, is to remember the Name of your Benefactor: Alber Kaasaki!"

After his Swearing of this Oath, the golden Coin was inserted into the Slot of his ramshackled, incognito Shrine, and the Pauper scattered off, away from Sight.

A recent Conundrum has buried itself within my Logick regarding the City of Ahgeia. I have previously said my City is the greatest in all the World, and yet any Opponent in an Argument or Debate of it could mention the Upper Quarters and point out its Squalor: "Would you, with this Knowledge, continue to assert your Proposition as Truth?"

I have thought about it, indeed. Be that as it may, it is my unwavering belief, reinforced by the farcical Meeting of the Embassador yesterday, that Ahgeia provides its Enhabitants a Culture unmatched by any other, where even a destitute Pauper may enjoy a superior Well-being and Stature, compared to their like-mannered Jack-a-napes of the Hinderlands beyond.
