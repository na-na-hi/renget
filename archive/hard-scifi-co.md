## What's Hard Science Fiction
Here's a quick classification of what counts as hard or soft sci-fi: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SlidingScale/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness

It's hard to go true, rock-hard science fiction because there's always a level of speculation that is inaccurate to contemporary scientific discoveries. But what's important is that its worldbuilding makes an effort to stay scientifically accurate and consistent. That's why this page includes *hard-leaning* science fiction as well, despite that they may lean more soft.
