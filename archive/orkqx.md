Korone looked at the man across the table from her. He wasn't normally someone she dated, but he was just too charming...in a number of ways. His muscles bulged under his black skin, and the tribal tatoo on his face glinted under the candlelight of the expensive Italian restaurant. She sighed, smiling. "Ith everything alright, sweetheart?" He asked, genuine concern in his lilting lisping voice. "No, Mike, everything's fine. I'm just, well...so happy." He smiled his gap toothed smile that lit up the room. "I'm happy too, baby!" And Korone was. Korone didn't normally date Americans, especially not African-Americans, but when she met Mike Tyson it was almost like love at first sight. Sure, he was rich from his boxing career and he always bought her nice gifts and expensive dates -and maybe that was part of it- but it was mostly his personality, his resolve, and how down-to-earth he was, and how sweet he was. Who knew a man so powerful could be so gentle? So kind?
