# Pandora's Box


You stand at the end of a long hallway covered in tubes and wires, how did it come to this? You just couldn't take it anymore, the harassment, the laughing of her friends as she knocks you down, the insults while she stands above you, and the purple bruises that match her hair. You should just die like the pathetic worm you are, and soon, you will. You will finally be free from her torture, her bullying, her insults, and pushing you down again when you finally stand up after it all. 

Luckily you had a plan for freedom from all of this. Your dad was taking a tour of the National Ignition Facility and decided to take you on a trip to cheer you up a bit. This gave you an idea, a painless way to go. And now you are here. 

The firing chamber of the facility in front of the most powerful laser humanity has built. You feel the chamber heat up and a loud whirring sound echo down the hall from the machine about 1000 feet away. It sounds like a jet engine and rattles your whole body, but it still feels like nothing to her abuse. 

The men in the control room have probably realized your in here by now with your father scrambling to turn off the machine. It's too late for that now though, he should have acted years ago, all of them should have. But, despite your cries of help, nobody did a thing. Your father refused to act when you said Mari wasn't acting like herself. Your mother supported her decision to dye her hair purple. Aubrey thought it was cool when she started carrying a bat. Kel said scars make you tougher when you showed your bruise. Hero didn't believe you when you said something. Basil was too scared of getting beat himself when you asked him to inform someone of authority. 

Now, you don't care what they think. You hope they realize what they did and what they didn't. They should just die and you hope they do. You imagine the look of misery on Mari's face as an empty casket is lowered into the ground. You imagine Hero pressing her face into a stovetop after he realizes what she did. You imagine your father scrambling to turn off the controls in the room where the on switch lies. You imagine Basil hanging from the tree for his cowardice. You imagine Aubrey getting into a particularly bad fight with her mother. You imagine Kel getting hit by a truck and having all of his dreams of a sports carrier flush down the drain as his legs go numb. 

As the light burns you a smile crosses your face, you are free. 

And with thoughts of nothing but hate and suffering, it all returns to nothing. 

Except, it doesn't. 

You wake up in a dark place on a blanket in front of a laptop. Your skin is completely black but you have a strange white outline like a cartoon. Your stomach feels empty to the point where it hurts to even breathe, sharp pain darts up your body from your ribs poking out through the shin in your chest. You feel around your face and find everything has been replaced with one giant verticle eye but your hair remains the same and you still have your depth perception. 

You try to open the laptop but it is very heavy. You try again and the pain from your ribs makes you let go. You try one last time using all of your strength...

The laptop opens and the screen comes on. You briefly jump back from the sudden influx of light but your eye adjusts quickly. 

On the screen is footage of a pair of brown-colored hands covered in black hair looking at a small pile of sticks and rocks. A smaller screen appears in the top right corner and shows lightning striking a tree and catching on fire. Is this some kind of nature documentary? 

You look to the bottom of the screen and see a black text box with a white flashing line. You press the N key and it appears in the box. This gives you an idea as you see the pair of hands now banging some sticks together. You enter a command and he follows as if he came up with the idea himself. You see him lay one stick down and place another one perpendicular to it and start twisting really hard.  After a few minutes smoke raised from the point of contact and a tine flame appears where it was. You place another command and the man puts a dry leaf on the flame and it expands bigger. he then adds more fuel to the fire to where it gets bigger and bigger just on his own. 

You have taught him to make fire and now he's doing it all on his own. As you see the other ape-men dance around the fire all screaming from excitement another idea enters your head. 

"Touch the Pretty Fire" 

A hand reaches out, a monkey jumps back, and you feel... satiated. The pain in your stomach eases a little bit and you feel like you just ate something for the first time in weeks. 

As the pain dulls just a little bit you realize you seemed to have just started the rise of humanity and now subsist of their suffering. An idea hatches in your mind and you realize the circumstances. You have the ability to implant ideas into the heads of people and push the world in any way you want. You were, are, and will be in the future. By stepping into the Chamber of Guf and being blasted with holy light you have ascended past reality. 

You think back to how you got here, the betrayal, the corruption, the lies, and abuse. 
You decide...
To make them pay.
And over thousands of years, you feed off the suffering you cause. Sometimes they manage to do it themselves but sometimes you like to cause it. You remember your own history and replicate it as much as you can. The apes on screen have unknowingly opened a Pandora's Box and inside it... is you.
