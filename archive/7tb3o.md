!!!note -> 🪶  **List of members streams**  🪶 <-
    With more people asking the question, we'll provide the list of the member contents Mumei has put. Just for the sake of it, we will say that all member streams obviously contain bits of Zatsudan. The current level of production of member streams on a monthly basis is 2, but Mumei has plans to produce more. Even if not mentioned, all Members streams contain more scuff than usual maybe even twice the scuff - but it's cute scuff.
    Credits to member anon to provide the brief descriptions.

!!!info -> *Regarding member zatsus*  <-
    This list exists mainly provide a brief overview over Mumeis members streams, it cannot be a replacement for members content nor is it meant to be a replacement .
    Due to their nature Members Zatsudan often containing topics that might be a little more personal than what ends up in non-Members content. In those cases a closer overview for the streams will for obvious reasons not be provided

####Members streams

|Date|Nature|Link|Notes|Duration|
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|&nbsp;2021-10-07&nbsp;|&nbsp;ASMR&nbsp;| 【ASMR】I Softly Speak and Hum For You! #holoCouncil [![【ASMR】I Softly Speak and Hum For You! #holoCouncil](https://files.catbox.moe/thsf7l.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8lNxA3uzTM)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/Reiny_ENVT/status/1445495011437543426)| Mumeis very first Members stream. Wasn't really sure yet what even to do as Members stream so she made a poll and 'ASMR (soft speaking and singing)' won by a landslide. Should come as no surprise being that close to her first Karaoke. Mumei style ASMR like the three public ones she did. This one is closer to a zatsu than the 'study' streams, making this not only her first ASMR and Members stream but also her first zatsu.(..?) Quiet giggles and laughs throughout, she even brought Friend for moral support. | ~1:40h|
|&nbsp;2021-10-21&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-Along&nbsp;|【WATCH-ALONG】Scream (1996) #holoCouncil [![【WATCH-ALONG】Scream (1996) #holoCouncil](https://files.catbox.moe/bfdts2.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8JEv4z4AlY)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/93496501)  | Halloween themed watch-along. Had a little bit of a comfy 'date' feel to it, as far as that even can be applied to Mumei. It's a watch-along, some like it some don't. Didn't plan to do a lot of commentary, did end up doing a lot of commentary. No-Selling most of it and being a bit of a deadpan-snarker. | ~3:00h |
|&nbsp;2021-11-13&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drawing&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Doubutsu Doodling [![【MEMBERS】Doubutsu Doodling](https://files.catbox.moe/rftoli.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP-bKv0dWys)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/92667955)|Stream was delayed because animal was needy and had to be exercised. (It didn't work, animal was still hyper). Sleepy Meimei drawing stream. Idea was getting promts and drawing the prompt but somehow ended up just drawing Animals. If memory serves, this was also the last stream where her cintiq was still working. One of the first streams where she was off to an Idol meeting but did not change to the loading screen, instead being all smug still on screen. This is also the stream where the Brotan-Incident happened. And some cute messing with your cheeky little sister moments when chat did what chat always does when Brotan get's mentioned (around 1:30h). The whole 2hours are the OG brainrot BGM- Please enjoy.| ~2:00h |
|&nbsp;2021-11-28&nbsp;|&nbsp;Karaoke&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】UNARCHIVED KARAOKE [![【MEMBERS】UNARCHIVED KARAOKE](https://files.catbox.moe/7hlnk8.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BxFkssSt2tI)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/93299355)|  It's Karaoke. Friend was there again. It's unarchived, go find it somewhere else. This Members Karaoke is more goofing around and being silly, not much else to say. | ~1:40h |
|&nbsp;2021-12-09&nbsp;|&nbsp;ASMR&nbsp;|【ASMR】Shhh!! SHH\! \![![【ASMR】Shhh\!\! SHH\! \!](https://files.catbox.moe/c1vvr3.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHLGsuJ664g)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/92487724) | Technical Scuff. A lot of it, even for a Members stream. She got better at her ASMR, but the stream itself suffered a bit for technical reasons. Noise gate on mic set a bit too, high making her cut out lots. Mic not even added as soundsource for the first 4 or so minutes i.e. silly things that could be fixed without too much trouble in a future stream. (bit of personal opinion starting here. This is the weaker of the two members ASMR streams. Not because of what Mumei did or tried to do but because of the tech scuff.) | ~1:10h |
|&nbsp;2021-12-19&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-Along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along [![【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along](https://files.catbox.moe/54lef3.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_9E9F3w2KEI)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/rguhbdroi/status/1434450021139705865)| Watch-along. Another somewhat Sleepymei stream. Slept a lot, still tired. Extra raspy voice. Again, didn't plan to do a lot of commentary but ended up doing a lot. | ~1:30h |
|&nbsp;2022-01-06&nbsp;|&nbsp;Karaoke&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】 Acapella KARAOKE [unarchived] [![【MEMBERS】 Acapella KARAOKE](https://files.catbox.moe/yo2jkl.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5EkQTBaITmI)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/93013684) | Kino, for various reasons. Actually tried acapella in the beginning but got flustered(no BGM means we might hear body noises like breathing or tummy grumbles et al). Flustered Moomer just hits very different.. Ended up doing regular Karaoke. A lot of kino happened. YMCA | ~3:05h |
|&nbsp;2022-01-28&nbsp;|&nbsp;Game&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Let's Play Fall Guys! [![【MEMBERS】Let's Play Fall Guys!](https://files.catbox.moe/xh1mvy.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJuFiOYoKmw)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/NAMIORII/status/1431655670453977091)| She was worried there might not be enough people that want to play with her to fill the lobby .... Needless to say, that was not the case and there have been more than enough players. That said, she's not very good and ended up doing commentary + zatsu light for the most part. Chippermei | ~1:25h |
|&nbsp;2022-01-30&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-Along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along  [![【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along](https://files.catbox.moe/n4l0ql.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PCi9ORKFkQ)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/94537728) | (Last Members before the break in February) NYE Outfit. Zoinked out that day, might have canceled for the day if it would have been anything but a watch-along. Still a watch-along but overall kinda comfy. Had some bits that were a little bit more zatsu/personal near the end of the stream. Originally a zatsu was planned but that eventually became \#12. As written earlier, no stream would have happened if not for watch-along. | ~1:30h|
|&nbsp;2022-03-20&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zatsu&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Let's Talk About Songs to Cover! [![【MEMBERS】Let's Talk About Songs to Cover!](https://files.catbox.moe/pk852t.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUmubap39EM)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/longtailsheep/status/1491010074705158148)| (New Home/NYE/Cup of Coffee) zatsu-light but mostly focused on what songs to commission backing tracks for. Briefly talks about her roommate(Boomei, she's talking about Boomei)| ~1:25h |
|&nbsp;2022-03-23&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-Along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along  [![【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi Watch-Along](https://files.catbox.moe/0g0lc1.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiDCAd6EOT4)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/LilYandereArt/status/1483630759894130690)|3rd part for MnTT watch-along. Complete no-sell for episode9. Nothing else of note comes to mind for this one.|~1:30h|
|&nbsp;2022-04-02&nbsp;|&nbsp;Zatsu&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Let's Talk n Stuff  [![【MEMBERS】Let's Talk n Stuff](https://files.catbox.moe/turb9b.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3NAuElpGbQ)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/92316265)|The postponed zatsu that should have been part of #09(possibly). Was preceded by a members post where she already was little more open than usual. This stream might be a bit of a milestone for her, by far the most open and cutest she's been with us yet. Not going to go into any more details for this one as it did feel a little more personal.|~2:30h|
|&nbsp;2022-04-14&nbsp;|&nbsp;Karaoke&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】POP PUNK ACAPELLA [![【MEMBERS】POP PUNK ACAPELLA](https://files.catbox.moe/njior7.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zq94wRfvz3o)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/97133129)|Unarchived same as every Karaoke. This is the be Mumeis neighbor while she is doing Karaoke/Singing for herself simulation. As there are still no backing tracks for some songs she wanted to sing, this one is another Acapella Karaoke. Stream was a little shorter because she had a little issue with her throat that day and due to a limited number of songs. First half was pop-punk second half was various different songs \(in various states of complete\).|~1:30h|
|&nbsp;2022-04-22&nbsp;|&nbsp;Drawing/Zatsu/Watch-Along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS ONLY】Doodle With Me! [![【MEMBERS ONLY】Doodle With Me!](https://files.catbox.moe/2tzggi.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmikeDho4Rc)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/InabaReito/status/1510113406124425218)|Not a mistake over there in what type of stream, this really went into three directions. Overall a laid back and cozy stream that  never felt like it's just dragging on. During the drawing segment, she was trying out various ways to give other holomem in her Drawing Hololive series options other than her usual cute and totally not cursed drawings. Three variations, two of them ended up discarded. After the drawings were done we did settle in for a bit of zatsu and things just went from there ending up with watching MV and commercials and more or less just hanging out a bit.| Total ~4:00h  - Drawing ~1:50h / Zatsu ~1:00h / Watch-Alongs ~1:15h |
|&nbsp;2022-04-29&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-Along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi FINALE \!\! [![【MEMBERS】Majo no TabiTabi FINALE \!\!](https://files.catbox.moe/v9afrk.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdbMiF06RFE) [Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/96907951) | Last part of the MnTT watch-along. Had some very adorable moments getting excited over cute anime girls. Didn't hurt that Ep10-12 were more on the cutesy side either. Some talk about what the next watch-along could be at the end. | ~2:00h |
|&nbsp;2022-05-10&nbsp;|&nbsp;Guerilla Zatsu&nbsp;|【MEMBERS ONLY】oh hi owl pals and parliament members [![【MEMBERS ONLY】oh hi owl pals and parliament members](https://files.catbox.moe/ud3dv4.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBeSuH5I5M4)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/My0li/status/1518927429623902208) | Up to this point in time Mumei did communicate in advance when members streams would happen. This stream did break out of that pattern as it was the first members stream that happened as a guerilla. As with the zatsu before, this one did touch on a few topics that are a little more personal.  | ~2:05h |
|  |  |  | Membership gifting got enabled for her channel between those two streams. This is just a note for additional context |  |
|&nbsp;2022-06-17&nbsp;|&nbsp;Watch-along&nbsp;|【MEMBERS ONLY】Monty Python and the Holy Grail Watch-Along [![【MEMBERS ONLY】Monty Python and the Holy Grail Watch-Along](https://files.catbox.moe/yy2eut.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sAiLTgKRU0)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/nanashimumei_en/status/1537873494125359105) | Watch-along of a classic. Mumei herself did did watch it a long time ago, as with the watch-alongs before, we got plenty of commentary from Mumei This time however not as much as some other movies had. She liked it, so rather watching than giving commentary | ~02:10 |
|&nbsp;2022-06-28&nbsp;|&nbsp; Online Quizzes &nbsp;| 【MEMBERS ONLY】I Don't Know What We Are Doing Yet But We Will Do Something [![【MEMBERS ONLY】I Don't Know What We Are Doing Yet But We Will Do Something](https://files.catbox.moe/tgdd1q.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RuGxiQzxJc)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/93440155) | Some simple hanging out and doing online quizzes stream (personality type, psychopathy test, etc) | ~02:00h |
| 2022-07-16 | Zatsu + Updates | 【MEMBERS ONLY】oh hi :D [![【MEMBERS ONLY】oh hi :D ](https://files.catbox.moe/2mcb9h.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDxusDp_kx8)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/anouetto/status/1462193470530011147) | Updates, the stream. Giving us some early info about what she is currently working on, what she was up to, who she accidentally ghosted(again) or not ghosted. We also got the name reveal for Hootsie (certainly not just a generic Hootie). Also a story about a certain animal (not the Animal) which is hecking cool.  | ~01:55h |
| 2022-07-25 | Doodling + light Zatsu | 【MEMBERS ONLY】doodles n doodles [![【MEMBERS ONLY】doodles n doodles](https://img.youtube.com/vi/W2rjM7wJrwQ/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2rjM7wJrwQ)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/hololize/status/1520019971187044352) | Starting off with some catching up, civ duties, drawing tablets ~30min. Doodles until creativejuice dried up ~30min. Back to some light Zatsu, mostly talking about her drawing/doodling process, upcoming schedule, petting animal etc... eventually transitioning into SC reading for the rest of the stream. Endingscreen was cute scuff kino. | ~02:30h |
| 2022-08-10 | Karaoke with Guitar + Zatsu  | 【MEMBERS ONLY】Scuffed Guitar n Song Practice [![【MEMBERS ONLY】Scuffed Guitar n Song Practice](https://img.youtube.com/vi/E0lrEQRrSmo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3fxfL2fQ9c)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/98680087) | This was supposed to be Guitar practice Karaoke only but turned into a Zatsu after Mumei was done with the Karaoke part. The Karaoke parts have been cut out and the Zatsu only parts have been Uploaded in a separate vod. Having the guitar with her did wonders for her voice, not being able to stress as much over how she sounds but having to also focus on playing really did make a difference. | ~04:30h |
| 2022-08-10 | Zatsu-only parts  | 【MEMBERS ONLY】Scuffed Guitar n Song Practice [![【MEMBERS ONLY】Scuffed Guitar n Song Practice](https://img.youtube.com/vi/E0lrEQRrSmo/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0lrEQRrSmo)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/98680087) | Just the zatsu parts.

We only watched one Episode(~50minutes) but had a sort of discussion about the Documentary with Mumei afterwards. As expected there also was a bit of Zatsu afterward. There were a lot of aah and oohs during the watch-along to be had as well as some moments of seethe about the style of the Documentary. Don't be fooled by the thumbnail, we did in fact NOT get Bluemei! | ~02:40h |

Did run a little longer than planned and turned a little bit vent-y. | ~04:20h |
| 2022-10-08 | ASMR | 【MEMBERS ONLY】asmr test test test [![【MEMBERS ONLY】asmr test test test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dFQtozYsgY0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFQtozYsgY0)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/InabaReito/status/1521865979755888640) | Trying out her 3Dio, expect some scuff. It's a little closer to her other member asmr than the public ones in addition to trying out some more generic things like ear cleaning, cupping and so on. This stream just so happened to be on the anniversary of her first Members stream. LEEEX (Runtime might not match, she wanted to edit out some unplugging noises) | ~01:15h |

Going in the opposite direction than the last two with extra commentary during the 'movie'. If we chum, they will come.  | ~02:20h |

This one was themed around Theater and Musicals. Thanks to her staying up very late the day before and not really being all that well rested it turned out a little weaker than some of her other Karaoke. As any Hooman should be aware by now, planned Karaoke are pretty much hit or miss. Anyway, despite all that it's still greatly appreciated.  | ~02:25h |
| 2022-12-04 | Watchalong | 【MEMBERS ONLY】Sora Yori Mo Tooi Basho Watch-Along - PART 1 [![【MEMBERS ONLY】Sora Yori Mo Tooi Basho Watch-Along - PART 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lpfVPEWxMqU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpfVPEWxMqU)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/nanart_19/status/1596637458531516416) | Second watchalong of a full series, the first mention of a sorayori watchalong was back during the after-zatsu parts of MnTT... So yea, we've been waiting quite a while on this one. At the start she did mention that she might have to help out with a project for civ duties but after the second Episode she learned that she would need to do a little more than just help out - and only had about half an hour left to do it. We ended up watching another 3 after that stopping after Ep5.  | ~3:10h |
| 2022-12-13 | Watchalong | 【MEMBERS ONLY】A Place Further Than The Universe - PART 2 [![【MEMBERS ONLY】A Place Further Than The Universe - PART 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZoIDVbRj38I/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoIDVbRj38I)[Thumbnail Source](https://twitter.com/gyaheung/status/1599529573636767745)| This one got cut a little short due to time constraints, our Owl was still being all busy but she still managed to squeeze in two Episodes. Would have done more if we had more time available. A certain subplot got exactly the reaction we were expecting. | ~01:30h
| 2022-12-19 | Watchalong | 【MEMBERS ONLY】A Place Further Than The Universe - FINALE [![【MEMBERS ONLY】A Place Further Than The Universe - FINALE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/A8ZKdPK4zjs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ZKdPK4zjs)[Thumbnail Source](https://www.pixiv.net/artworks/103197642) | Instead of a member zatsu before her break we got to finish Sorayori. Both at our request and because she would have finished it on her own during the break(and pretended she didn't finish to watch the rest with us a second time).. so she has been preeetty excited to finish the series. Getting warned about it getting sad didn't do much to soften the impact, neither for us not for Mumei. Some zatsu afterwards to talk about the anime and that scene and a few other anime that had her be a little more emotional | ~03:15h

This stream is the continuation to Sleepy Owltime with about the same amount of brain capacity still being occupied by being all sleepy. Some doodles but no extra cute or slightly cursed creations. Then the news. Comfy stream but the lack of sleep did leave it's mark. | ~03:15h

She had a meeting later that day and thus not a lot of time, it's mostly JP Song practice with the usual vocal warm-ups, commentary and just Mumei being a silly.  | ~01:15h

It's been quite the enjoyable stream, as before Mumei did not really remain on the quiet but gave plenty commentary. We watched Episodes 1-4.  | ~02:30h

This should have been all the remaining Episodes but we only watched 5-8. Stream got cut a little short due to health Issues (This was just before her break)  | ~02:30h

[![【MEMBERS ONLY】ASMR for Owl Pals !! + New Asset ... !!!!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OlCDQXhGfEM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlCDQXhGfEM)[Art Source](https://twitter.com/xdeyuix) | No verbal abuse ASMR today but a dangerously cute caffeinated ranty ASMR Zatsu(forma de Mumei). After showing off the new Asset and trying out a few new things we quickly strayed into zatsu territory. Only wanted to go for about an hour but stayed for almost two and a half. She was working on the negative affirmation script before deciding to just do a zatsu though, so there is still hope..(It will happen, just beriebu!)  | ~2:20h
