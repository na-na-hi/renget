>Magic: Gilded Blade (Goldbrand)
Proof of his exploits during the Oblivion Crisis, taken from the dead hands of a particularly powerful foe. This unnamed blade stands as a symbol of triumph over nearly impossible odds, and those who witness its use in battle will know that the wielder will never bow down to forces that lie beyond.
>Sweat: Well-Armed Guard, Walled Towns
Rubble and ruin is all that remains of the unfortunate ones who couldn't defend themselves from the sudden invasion and the subsequent chaos that followed. That will change under his watch. No more will the settlements of Tamriel be viewed as easy pickings by any being, mortal or otherwise. They'll have to tear the place down brick by brick and meet the valiant guard's steel before they take a step inside.

Someone Really Oughta Do Something About That.
>Honor: None
There is nothing below Dance-With-Waters which would prevent him from taking advantage at every opportunity. Lie, cheat, steal, murder. The weak will be culled and from  the remains will rise a force unstoppable in strength and spirit. This effect can already start to be seen after the Oblivion Crisis, so really he's just refining it further. His words may ring empty, but his actions will always prove true, as the only thing you can trust from him is his endgoal, to unite Tamriel under him.

Orderly Citizen

An Argonian warrior whose feats in during the Oblivion Crisis are widely known throughout the Black Marsh. Argonians across all regions rallied together to storm the Gates, and the among the first of them, ran Dance-With-Rain. His natural prowess for slaughter with the blessings of the Hist gave proof to his name as he tore through the battlefield with peerless grace and left a torrential tide of blood behind. As the Gates closed on the Black Marsh and marked the end of the Oblivion Crisis for the region, so too did the blessings of the Hist take their leave... but a small remnant took root inside Dance-With-Rain. This glimmer of the Hist's blessing gave him mastery over Restorative arts, and to other Argonians marked him as someone chosen for greater causes. As one of the remaining Argonians who first clashed with the Daedric forces on the frontline, and one chosen by the Hist, it only seemed natural to give him a respect similar to those in the rest of Tamriel give their kings. Now, he marches with his army across Tamriel to pick up the pieces caused by the Oblivion Crisis and further wars, and build a united continent stronger then ever before.

He is not a completely selfless and benevolent ruler however. Ultimately he is a Warlord, and the title of Emperor has not crossed his mind as something to take, just a responsibility that eventually he will have to fill. He conquerors in the name of the Hist and Argonian kind, and sees himself as nothing more than a warrior leading an army. His capabilities for maintaining and leading an Empire are both lacking and nothing he cares for, and his view on acceptable laws follow an "Eye-For-An-Eye" policy. Dance-With-Rain is very much a ruler concerned with the short term issues at hand, everything else can be considered a non-issue until all lands are brought up under his banner.

>Strategy: Battle of Subterfuge
There are many powerful players in this land, far more then he could be expected to take on alone... which is why he is not going to fight fair. Simply put, he only chooses to fight battles he thinks he can decisively win. While this is a fantasy for most, it is a strategy that Dance-With-Rain places his trust in. He won't be storming cities to take over capitals, nay, he will be reaping the already broken villages and settlements to slowly expand his influence and build up his forces. His close vicinity to surrounding water leaves very little paths to invade him on land, and is a resource he uses to send out ships armed with Pirate crews and Shadowscales to attack key targets without having to send large armies. He plans to cripple his opponents forces by taking out their heads and whittling them down in spirit and bodies with guerilla tactics if they decide to approach his territory.

If the time comes for direct conflict however, he will be right there on the frontlines to lead the charge, for only his army will fall when he falls.
