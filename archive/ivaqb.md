Iroha was fidgeting around the entrance of her house. She couldn't keep herself calm at all after waiting so long for her delivery to arrive.

>"I-I b-bought it, right? Yes I did, I absolutely did. Why then? Why is taking so long?! I need it now now now!" said Iroha.

She kept walking in circles, her patience running out. The package in question she was waiting for was Koyori's merch, more specifically her tail. Iroha has been imagining ever since she bought the little item if it'd smell like Koyori, the things she'd do with it kept her mind running wild.

>"Ahhhhhhhhh I can't wait anymore, I don't care just take all my money"

Iroha entered the website again and bought the most expensive item available there, delivered as soon as possible. Not even a few moments later a knock could be heard on the door. She ran as quick as she could to get her precious tail. To her surprise, the thing she found after opening the door wasn't her package but rather Koyori herself.

>"Geez I can't believe someone actually bought this, not even most of my gachis would spend so much. I'm impressed" said Koyori.

>"Eh? didn't I buy just another tail?" asked Iroha.

>"Oh nonono, you bought something way more special" Koyori turned around and raised her tail "Here all yours, enjoy it"

>"Ah ah ah C-c-can I???? Thank you thank you!"

Iroha grabbed the pink tail with both of her hands and proceeded to put her face in the fluffy fur. She rubbed her face all over it taking sniffs between breaks. The stench was quite strong, any normal person would be disgusted by the unwashed tail of this coyote girl but not Iroha. The foul aroma was a reward on itself, she could live inside there for all she cared.

>"*Ahem* Ummm Iroha, what are you doing?" asked Koyori with a perplexed expression on her face.

>"Uhhhh I'm enjoying your tail, the thing I bought, r-right?" said Iroha nervously.

>"*pffft* You wish, let me give you the actual thing"

Koyori raised her tail even higher, putting it on top of Iroha's head, she then pulled down her skirt and panties.

>"I drank a potion before coming here, it'll make it quite intense and it'll last for a long time. Say *ahhhhh*"

>"Wait wait, I don't understa--" Iroha got cut short

The coyote girl sat her butt in Iroha's face, making sure Iroha's mouth was covering her entire pussy while her nose was plugged into her ass, both of her thighs locking in place Iroha's head. It wouldn't take long until a warm sensation started pouring into the tongue of the samurai girl. A bunch of pee came rushing down into her throat. it was so hot she felt like she was swallowing boiled water. However this wasn't like water at all, it was bitter, strong and had a quite strong smell.

>"You're doing great! Keep on chugging, this potion allows me to piss for 5 to 10 minutes. Hope you are thirsty!" said Koyori with a evil grin on her face.

She wasn't lying, the torrent of piss wasn't stopping. Iroha didn't want to drown in this yellow river, she kept on swallowing the hot liquid like it was the tastiest thing she ever had the pleasure of drinking. The amount was so much some of it spilled out into her clothes and onto the floor. 5 Minutes in and the living room of the samurai was covered in pee all around the girls. Even after this was over, the smell would remind anyone this was koyori's territory now.

>"Ummmm I think I'm done now, you did great!!" said Koyori

Koyori rubbed all over Iroha's face to clean herself. She then let Iroha free.

>*Cough Cough* I c-can't, no more please...." said Iroha kneeling in a floor covered in piss.

>"hahaha I thought you enjoyed it, you swallowed with so much energy. Come on cheer up have bit more just for free" said Koyori.

Koyori raised one of her legs high, immediately a long stream of piss started to fall in top of Iroha who was still kneeling on the floor. It looked like an animal marking her territory as Koyori poured all her remaining pee in Iroha's quivering body.

>"*phew* I'm all spent, see you next week for a collab. Byeeee"
