A philosophical radicalist, Pulch is an arrogant man with strong feelings about the grander purpose of quirks in the universe. Pulch believes in beauty above all else. That worthy life is beautiful, and life which is not beautiful is unworthy. Evolution is a process to bring us closer to beauty, and the emergence of Quirks is the natural acceleration of this process. This mindset aligns him into a worldview adjacent to his superior, Okane King, who he respects but views as a cracked diamond, almost wonderous, but failed by his own demeanor. 

Haruka is among the more emotionally volatile in the Night Parade, stoking personal grudges over insults to himself and his brand, and using his celebrity connections or simple violence to exact revenge when offended, illustrated best after an unfortunate afternoon with a young lady who failed to take him seriously on the field, and reaped the bitter fruit of victory.
 
One would expect a diva to do poorly in this career, but between the natural culling and his assistant Recino's guidance he's found himself a loyal following, some even adopting his philosophy.

His quirk itself is simple, but elegant. The conjuring and manipulation of flame drawing on sound energy in the air. Stray sound acts as fuel which his own voice ignites, naturally coming under his control after the fact. Because of it's unique origin, the sound of the flame itself often echoes its origin, screaming in pain or humming a piano's melody according to the situation.
