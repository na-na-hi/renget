>⚡️Speech HIGHLIGHTS of the Mujahideen Brigades spox ‘Abu Bilal’

• We bid farewell to a group of heroic martyrs, including leaders, and fighters.

• On the 7th of October, we, along with our brothers in other resistance factions, captured many Zionists.

• Since the start, we targeted 27 military vehicles with anti-armor rockets and explosive devices, which led to their complete or partial destruction and the killing and wounding of those inside them.

• We bombed the Zionist settlements surrounding Gaza with approximately 69 rocket salvos.

• We destroyed military gatherings and concentrations of vehicles and soldiers 49 times.

• We targeted 6 military helicopters, which led to them being directly hit.

• We shot down 3 reconnaissance drones, including the Hermes-900, in a joint operation with the Qassam Brigades.

• We targeted a naval boat off the shores of the Gaza Strip with a Sa'ir missile.

• We targeted entrenched Zionist forces with anti-fortification & anti-personnel shells 9 times, killing and wounding their soldiers.

• We carried out 6 sniping operations against Zionist soldiers.

• We seized many weapons and military equipment.

• We thwarted 2 naval landing operations by Zionist forces on the shores of the Gaza Strip and forced them to retreat, carrying deaths and injuries.

• Together with the Al-Qassam Brigades, we targeted 3 Zionist drones, and we also participated with the Al-Quds Brigades in bombing with rocket bursts and sniping a soldier.

• As for our valiant shores, we carried out many shelling operations against military vehicles, engaged in many clashes with enemy forces, and confronted their repeated incursions.

• We tell the enemy that the alleged claim of your defeated army to control the northern Gaza Strip is nothing but an illusion that you are trying to market. Our victorious forces have carried out a series of air, land and sea defense operations. We have presented evidence that proves the truth of our statement. 

We have shown scenes of part of our operations, and we will show other scenes successively, God willing.

• Let the enemy know that his crimes will only make us more steadfast and adhere to our path until the occupation is wiped out from all of our land.
