# Chance Encounter

Another investigation. Rumors of poltergeist activity litter the streets throughout the 16th ward. Though the city has always been one of the more superstitious regions in the country, evidence has been posted online of mysterious noises happening within the dead of night, shadows forming unnatural shapes of inhuman forms, and blood stains the alleyways of the street leading up to the abandoned building at 4th street. Priestly robes of a Christian flavor were always a rare sight in the country. While there were pockets of believers spread across the land, the distinct crosses were a rare sight in the metro's final train of the day. Not that Yoji could do much about it, it was the standard exorcist uniform, but he wasn't just an exorcist. 

As young as he was, his gaze showed of his experience in the field. Dark brown eyes so deep in thought that it stared past the rhythmic rattle of the cart on the way to his mission. What had he gotten himself into? Ghosts don't bleed. Yet, with the evidence at hand, it could be plenty of other creatures at the site. It might even be one of the glowing monsters he's encountered before. A shiver runs through him, even if the possibility of glowing people was just a mere passing thought. Those once calm eyes now darting from person to person, terrified of the possibility that one of the black ties may be out hunting for him. But the train carts only had drunk salary men and passive onlookers that just wanted to get home after a long day.

From the station and onto the abandoned building was a long walk through a shopping street close to a nearby college. Despite the numerous bars within the area, the place was far enough away from any stragglers to stumble themselves close to the site. Still, he had to remain vigilant. With how the youth are nowadays, all it takes is one inebriated suggestion before a whole pack of thrill seekers start ruining any of the evidence. 

But now, that was the least of his worries. Standing right before him was another individual also dressed in a strange attire. In garbs just as dark, her dress helped her hide in the shadow of the light polluted city. Yet unlike his modest attire, her dress had frills on every inch of its surface. But that wasn't the strangest part. She had an umbrella this late into the night. Not just carrying it with her, but opened up to hide her face under its shade. There was a distinct scent of blood as he noticed a few red splats at the hem of her skirt. 

Yoji squinted for a bit, his eye shining a pale golden glow, and there he saw it. Lines sprouted from all over her form, the most noticeable of which was a crimson line linked to the something at the backstreet of shuttered store and another brighter line connecting to one of the buildings further down the road. Yoji immediately focused on the girl ahead. As long as he could keep his distance, he'd be able to use his psychic abilities to deal with whatever she had, or at the very least read her surface thoughts before she could do something dangerous. With continued focus, everything began to become dark as he peered into her mind.

Away... Haunted... Tonight...

*Blood*... *Fresh*...

*Him*... Why...

**YOU**...

Before Yoji could react, she was already up to his face. Her eyes now visible as a swirling black and red spiral, and all he could remember was those same eyes becoming a blur yet again.

As she explained, this was when Yoji used his telekinesis to fling one of the larger outdoor menu signs right across her frail body and causing her to splat across one of the nearby walls. As extreme as it was, Yoji had at least neutralized the situation as swiftly as possible when he had noticed that she was no monster, far from it. She was a girl maybe one or so years her junior, and, despite her superhuman durability, was a mostly normal girl. Mostly.

"What insolent rube! Is that how you should treat a lady?!" the girl said as you hear one of her bones crack out of place from slumping down to the floor.

Despite her nonchalant attitude to basically be launched at breakneck speeds, Yoji could only equally muster the same sort of indifferent tone as her "It was the quickest solution to the problem."

"You're lucky it was no mere mortal that you had encountered at this fateful night. For it is I, the crimson miasma of the 16th ward tha-"

"Any eye bearer would've survived that blow."

"Would you at least let me finish!"

"No. I have no time to play such games." 

Although his response was dismissive of the situation, he still had his concerns over her well-being. He crouched down to inspect the damage caused. Inflammation of the area with a specific tenderness when pressure is applied. It was more than just bruising, likely a fracture, but nothing that holy light can't heal. Yet when the beam of light shinned over the problem, it only made it worse. Her skin started to sear from just a faint exposure of God's light. She hissed and closed her eyes, squirming just a bit from the extra pain. It was no use forcing the healing process.

"I-is that all you got? Even the power of God is but a mere tickling warmth compared to the might of shadows." Despite her tone, she was clearly relived that he had stopped trying to heal her.

"Why are you rejecting the light?"

"Fool, the form of vampires burn upon His presence, yet only I am strong enough to face his might through no such barrier." 

To Yoji, it was more likely she was using the demon within her to deny the holy night. She would gain no benefit from acting in such a way. What is it with kids these days?

"In spite of this, priest, you clearly do not want me banished from the mortal realm, else you would have done so by now. I take it that you still require something of me?"

"We have to get you some medical attention first before you go doing whatever you were doing recently."

"Hah, I have grown beyond conventional medicine! Witness as this vessel has transcended beyond human limitations!"

Slowly but surely, the swelling of the fracture shrinks until it mostly subsides enough for her to stand, but limping slightly as she walks.

"See? I have no need for such charity when any wound would be but a minor inconvenience when one has mastered the art of blood, though the bone itself may take a bit longer to return to its initial state."

"You're going to make the fracture worse by walking like that."

"And why would such unholy being concern you, priest?"

"I have a name."

"And I have one too. A title, I mean. Before you so graciously-"

"Just tell me your name."

"Ak... A-aome?"

"*Sigh*. Ryōshi, Yoji Ryōshi."

"Ryōshi... Right. What is it you require of me, priest? Does one's concern lie on the abandoned office space nearby?"

"Why- Anyway, tell me more about that place."

"Hm... I cannot recall much of the day-to-day affairs of mortals, yet I do recall that that building had already been abandoned for quite some time. It is only recently that some presence have disturbed the residing entities."

"And you believe it to be the cause of the disturbance?"

"I find the hypothesis plausible. The roguish rift raft seems to only increase in frequency around said building. I had even planned to investigate the area myself after I had finished disciplining the recent offenders."

"I see. It's best if you leave the investigations to me. You're not exactly in a state to fight, Akari."

"H-how? How do you know of my true name?! No, that's not the issue. I must take part in the expedition! It is only proper that I take responsibility, as my negligence has likely caused the phenomenon to begin with."

"Hm, fine. You can come along and watch my back. But if things ever go wrong, run."
