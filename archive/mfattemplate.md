# How to Create a New /mfat/ Thread

## Steps
1. Copy and paste the below template into the new thread message box.
2. Link to the last edition of the thread by first searching Desuarchive [like this](https://desuarchive.org/trash/search/text/mfat/type/op/). The URL will look something like: https://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/49261820/#49261820
3. Copy and paste the last edition's archived URL from Desuarchive on the **Previous Thread** line.
4. Now that you're looking at the last thread, you can now set the OP image. Select fresh content from a resident drawfag, or pick an image that was relevant to in-thread discussion.
5. Set the edition on the **/mfat/ Male Fatfur Thread** line, potentially based on the OP image.
6. (optional) Find a song on YouTube that fits the thread's edition, if possible, for the **Thread Theme** line. 
7. Put an /mfat/-related question on the **TOTT** line.
8. Solve your CAPTCHA and post the thread already!
