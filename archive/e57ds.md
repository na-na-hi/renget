##### `Breakfast in Bed`
How do you spend the anniversary with your waifur, anons? I prefer the old fashioned breakfast in bed.

>starts with slowly worming my way out of bed so as not to wake her. She's a light sleeper, but I have years of experience.
>make my way downstairs and put together the classic pancakes, bacon, and sausage.
>no sooner than those sausages start sizzlin', I here movement from our room. No surprise she's awake. With a strong nose like that, it's almost impossible to surprise her.
>regardless, still go through with breakfast, with some juice to boot. Carry the dishes upstairs, to the sight of the wifey lying upright on her side, smile on her face and tail wagging excitedly.
>despite her knowing about my surprises before I do them, she's always happy to oblige me and my cliches.
>we enjoy breakfast together, with me occasionally feeding her a piece of sausage, much to her delight.
>once it's all said and done, we set the dishes aside and cuddle together, content to be in each other's company.
>"I have to be the luckiest girl in the world, marrying a kind and loving man like you."
>"I have to be the luckiest guy in the world, marrying such a beautiful, strong, and incredible woman like you."
>you give her a kiss on the nose and both your hands intertwine with one another as you both begin to drift off yet again.
>thank God for waifurs, and thank God it's Saturday.
