Watson Industries LLC, est. [xxxxx], is well known, everyone should know the abridged history on a random plaque in god knows where. The boss who owns the title of great and cuter than usual: Ame. She's amazing, brought fires to humans or something, probably invented Vtubing as a concept, gave SOUL to humanity as a whole, which, as everyone you know knows, allows everyone to be happy from day to day. Then suddenly built Watson Industries. Perhaps it might be exaggerated, who knows. Flyers spread overhead in random nations spreading the word of Ame, even if that is violating the airspace of the neighbors. Either way, the one thing for certain is her giving her citizens the many departments for seeking a job. Aviation, logistics, security, human resources, pharmaceutical, assault, and on and on and on. You love it. Company gives you a job, the industry is allied with other nations nearby and has steady trade of certain types of technology, you get to eat your daily bread, listen to Ame on the radio, and then thank Ame you're not an expedition or occult studies member, sick fucking freaks.
Officer K has been eyeing you as of-

Officer K probably knows. It's fine. Either way, you know that's not his real name. He probably forgot it long ago, either by choice or because he never cared to give a shit about his birth name. Maybe he's just happy with being one of the many Ks. He's just like you. However, he probably doesn't care if you see yourself in him. He probably knows what you saw. Those ones that don't exist just yet. A sickly hue to the light they're covered in as they caught a lone defector crossing a outer checkpoint, bawling. A strained voice stating that they already knew about the plans years from now and history must be set on course. K keeps eyeing you. It's fine. The sun is out, the people are working, you are listening to Ame sing something off key, you got a new max PR at the company acclaimed Buffson's gym, and this sandwich is delicious.
You have all the time you need.

I also made a challenge coin I guess for a junior enlisted Watson military boot
