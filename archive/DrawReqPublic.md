!!!info What is this?
This is the public version of the [Draw Request](https://rentry.org/CloverDrawRequest) for the Clover Guild. The idea behind this is that it is a safer method to input ideas from the thread instead of using the main draw request and risking it being vandalized, losing over 100 requests, the completed requests list, and such. By the end of the thread, everything that's unfulfilled on this page will be copied over to the main Draw Request page. The edit code for this page is **DrawReq**

!!! danger Please put newer drawing ideas **relating to the Clover Guild characters** at the top of the list.
