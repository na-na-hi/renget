#Orochi's Questionnaire

>Question one: Do you look up to any Pro Heroes? What about them seems like a shining example of a hero to you? If you find them lacking, what do you think they should do differently?

My own father. He was strong, steadfast and precise when he was still a hero. He was very strong too. He was able to move boulders when rescuing people and make a quick job of most villains that crossed his path.
The problem is mostly with me, I don’t think I can copy his style, I lack the brute strength to do so and I have problems he doesn’t have. How frustrating.

>Question two: You all have somewhat of an idea about your classmates' quirks from seeing them in action, working together, or just speaking. What are some nuances to your quirk you think others should know? The most important part of teaming up with another hero is knowing the strengths and limitations of each other's quirks, so describe yours.

My quirk is rather simple and people already know it. I am like a Hydra, big regeneration, strength and endurance. My bodily fluids are poisonous and I have venom glands in my jaw and in my hydra heads.
I can see and hear, kinda, with my hydra heads, also can take and use them to hold stuff, bite stuff or sneak a glance at a corner. They are very strong, able to hold my body weight. They are like a reptile tail too, sometimes I can just  drop them down without realizing. This has not happened since I was a brat, okay?
Whatever they eat also ends in my tummy too.

>Question three: What role do you find yourself most suited for? Offense and directly fighting or assisting others in fighting villains? Defense and being able to protect civilians while doing battle with a villain? Rescue where you can assist those who have been hurt or trapped and need help getting to a safe location? Support where you mostly just assist other heroes before or after they go into the field? Social work where you work on detaining a villain without resorting to violence and destruction simply talking them down? Recon work where you gather information and scout threats without necessarily wanting to step into the limelight yourself? The generalist who can do it all thanks to their quirks and broad uses?

Frontline offense, no doubt about that. I’m not suited to rescue nor stealth most of the time due to my mutations.
Defense can work if the civilians are far enough from me so I can fight an enemy without worrying about friendly fire.
I think I’m better suited to hold down a problematic villain while my coworkers or partners finish the other villains, so we can all tackle the big bad at once and bring him down more easily.
My quirk surely helps with that.

>Question four: Which of your fellow students do you think you could work together with the best? Who do you want to get to know and havent had the chance to? 

Tanaka, Yui and Edith, mostly. Due to my quirk, anyone near me is in danger of getting caught in the crossfire of my fights. Tanaka can manipulate gravity, thus being able to keep his distance and help with crippling the enemy or holding him for long enough for me to inject my venom in them.
Yui can do the same thing with her bands, but Tanaka is better for fights with multiple enemies, while Yui is better on a 2x1. I’d prefer Yui than Tanaka and Edith, since our dynamics have been fire tested.
Edith, I didn’t fight besides her, but I know the basics of her quirk due to our combat training. I can hold down or throw enemies in her range so she can vanish them to her pocket space. At least this is the theory.

Jugo and Kaylee can also work but on a case by case basis. Since we three are frontline fighters first and foremost, and Jugo has some problems containing his enthusiasm, he may get hit by my blood or other fluids while I fight a villain due to getting too close. Kaylee has the same problem.
However their Ki blasts make them a very good backline artillery to help me fight a group of enemies.

>The final question: What sort of hobbies do you enjoy when you aren't working on school work or training? After all this is the biggest part of developing a social connection to your fellow students. Maybe you'll turn out to have enough people to form a book club, or a anime watch party or other social gathering. What are your favorite things to do? 

I really like arcades so I just go to play them. Maid cafes are also cool. I dislike bringing friends to my home, it just feels too oppressive for most people who are not used to it. So bringing friends to play some games at an arcade and just chill in a maid cafe is the best!
An arcade party would be good too. I should see with my dad and mom to see if I can pull it off and call the class to it.
