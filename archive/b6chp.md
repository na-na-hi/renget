> 13. Noah Abrams/Archangel
	[3. Nice enough.
	6. I want to pinch his cheeks.
	7. Goody two shoes. Probably hiding something.
	10. I feel like he has an inflated opinion of himself.
	11. He's so pleasant it makes my skin crawl.]
> 14. Victor Sigurd/Hydra
	[3. I guess he's a good student.
	6. H-he's strong!
	7. Class 1-D stands for diversity, huh? I'm sure Karaburan thinks she's very funny. Daddy will hear of this.
	10. He smells like fish.
	11. Cool quirk, though I haven't missed how he looks at the better-endowed girls in this class. What a pig.]
> 15. Genma Gō/Goldorado
	[3. Weirdo.
	6. Knows his way around an engine, which is, um, interesting. But it makes sense for boys to know about bikes and stuff like that.
	7. What a stupid name. Alliteration is idiotic.
	10. Once asked me if I wanted to look at his motorbike. Creep.
	11. I'm sure he has a tragic backstory, but I don't really give a shit.]
> 16. Inigo Myoga/Ryu-kishi
	[3. I'm going to kill him if he so much as looks at any of us ever again.
	6. Hate.
	7. Creep. Not worth going to the trouble of ruining his life, though.
	10. Makes my skin crawl.
	11. Disgusting.]
> 17. Christopher Cain/Mirror Devil
	[3. I'm uncomfortably reminded of a few especially annoying boys back in the US.
	6. Cool quirk, I guess?
	7. Irritating.
	10. I like the faces he makes when Rosethorn wakes him up. He looks so stupid.
	11. Looks like he smells. Knows his stuff, though.]
> 18. Ashleigh Katsuragi/Blackout
	[3. Classic wallflower. Well, the rest of us have lives to live.
	6. She's just so shy.
	7. Potential minion.
	10. It's like there's a dark cloud hanging over her head.
	11. Cramps my style just by sitting in my general vicinity.]
> 19. Sora Tanaka/Orbit
	[3. He exists.
	6. I have no idea what he looks like under that hood and that makes me nervous.
	7. He comes to class in that getup, you know.
	10. He's okay, I guess? What do you want me to say?
	11. Powerful quirk, but he's no match for our Edie.]
> 20. Bobby Samson/Sunlight Man
	[3. Um. Next question.
	6. Takeda's friend.
	7. Minnie's too good for him.
	10. A familiar face, though that may just be because white guys all look the same to me.
	11. Quite the fall for the spawn of Sun Man.]
> 21. Soujyuuro Imai/Mahoudeva
	[3. I fill my brain with pink elephants whenever he's within a few feet of me.
	6. Mind-readers are spooky.
	7. Why is he not in Tartarus right now?
	10. I don't like looking at his face. His third eye creeps me out. 
	11. He has a nice ass.]
> 22. Chihiro Mitsurugi/Yako
	[3. My opinion of Karaburan drops with every day that she's allowed to sit in.
	6. Creeps me out.
	7. They put us in the same classroom as a murderer. Daddy will hear of this. I'm not kidding.
	10. She and the mind-reader are perfect together. I hope they get together and stay far, far away from us. 
	11. You know she killed her entire family, right?]
> 23. Shinkan Sen/Crazy Train
	[3. I can smell him from across the room. I'm pretty sure this class has the worst-smelling people in the entire grade.
	6. He's stupid.
	7. His family is almost as wealthy as mine, which just goes to show that there's no accounting for taste when it comes to the Japanese.
	10. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFSwIw-_-as
	11. He has a train for a head. How am I supposed to take him seriously?]
> 24. Hifumi Takeda/Challenger
	[3. May be too soon to tell, but I think he's good for Hailey.
	6. He seems sweet.
	7. Kinda full of shit.
	10. Hailey's too good for him.
	11. I'm going to keep an eye on him.]
