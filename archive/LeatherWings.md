Warm Blood by anonymous

>Human "vital fluids" are uniquely powerful to vampire bats
>Not merely capable of quenching thirst, they can instill a feeling of joy, happiness, and vitality back into their usually unfeeling hearts
>Like being drunk and high on an aphrodisiac at the same time
>All it takes is a single taste for an unsuspecting vampire bat to be hopelessly entranced by the taste of (you)

>Working at upscale restaurant as cook
>In the kitchen doing prep work with bat bro coworker
>Just the two of you in the kitchen this early in the morning
>cutting vegetables while he takes stock of inventory
>he's been a huge help getting you started here since you were hired on a few months ago
>you connected instantly when you found he shared your sense of humor and interest in shlocky horror
>since then you've been inseparable in the workplace
>he's even offered you to come over to his "bat-cave" a few times to watch shitty movies and drink beer
>been too shut-in recently to comfortably hang out but it's becoming a more and more tempting offer
>distracted in your thoughts, the knife you were chopping with edges closer to your fingers...
>you hiss through your teeth in surprise as you leave a decently deep cut on your index finger
>bat bro's ears perk up and he turns around "You okay Anon?"
>You answer back telling him you're fine and put pressure on the bleeding cut with your other hand
>begin to walk for the wall mounted first-aid kit in the back of the kitchen to clean and bandage yourself
>Make it quarter of the way before bat bro starts sniffing the air, a look of puzzlement on his face
>"Hold up Anon, come here you're bleeding" he says. Watching you with arms crossed from across the kitchen
>You respond that you're already on it, without slowing your pace
>Until he moves to cut you off, navigating around the counter in the middle of the kitchen
>Now in between you and the first-aid kit he holds out his hand "C'mon I gotta make sure our second best cook is peak condition for the customers tonight." He says, flashing his fangs in a smug grin
>cocky asshole
>You give a humorless "ha" and present your upturned hand to him, blood now running in a thin line down to the base of your finger
>"Woah Anon this is actually pretty deep..." His eyes widen in moderate surprise as he observes the cut
>He then turns away and becomes pensive
>"Y-you know anthro saliva is good for closing wounds right?" he mutters quietly slowly turning back to you and not quite meeting your eye
>You are fairly certain that does not apply to bats
>It's... kinda strange you tell him, but he rebuffs you after a small pause, seemingly building confidence as he continues on
>"No, really! I swear! I read about it in this medical journal down at the bank! Please just let me help" He presses, while lightly but firmly holding your wrist in his clawed hands.
>Not willing to put off medical attention for your cut anymore, and momentarily confused as to why there would be a medical journal in a bank. You simply nod and tell him to do what he thinks is best
>He once again grins showing off his fangs, now slightly more concerting as he pulls your hand closer to his mouth.
>You resist your natural instinctual urges to pull away. You've built up a good rapport with bat bro, and while odd. You know he'd never do anything malicious towards you.
>...You hope at least
>his lengthy tongue slowly emerges from his mouth and tentatively licks the area around the cut
>He does this for a few moments, breath from his spade shaped nose rolling down you wrist with his every exhale
>Until you feel his breath hitch, he pauses. Tongue pressed flat against the cut
>He stays like this until it starts to get a little uncomfortable
>You start to open your mouth to say something when he wraps nearly the entire length of your finger up with his tongue and pulls it into his mouth.
>You gasp in surprise and attempt to pull back, but his grip on your wrist in incredibly strong
>You grab his arm with your other hand and begin voicing your objections as you continue struggling, you feel the intense suctions of his mouth now encompassing your entire index finger down to the knuckle
>He seems to completely ignore your protests as a content look spreads across his face, it's not until you bonk him on the head maybe a little too roughly that he opens his eyes and, giving a short squeak of surprise, pulls away quickly.
>"I... I'm so sorry Anon, I-I don't know what came over me... I just..." his sentence begins to die out as he looks directly at you again, freezing for a second time and eyes dilating sharply as he observes you as if for the first time
>His gaze gives you chills down your spine, as if he's looking through you.
>You meekly speak up stating you'd just like to get your cut cleaned and dressed
>"R-right" he replies stepping out of your path to the first-aid kit
>After getting yourself patched up you retreated to your duties at the opposite end of the kitchen
>Bat bro had already gone back to taking stock but an awkward tension lingered in the air
>Rest of the shift did not fair much better, even as more coworkers slowly trickled in and the once peacefully silent kitchen became a cacophony of sizzling pans and shouted orders
>The once comforting banter between you and bat bro to break up the monotony of the workday was strangely absent
>Occasionally you'd glance back toward his cooking station to find him looking at you. Only for him to quickly avert his eyes elsewhere
>Oh well, you hope this whole thing is forgotten about tomorrow, tonight was especially rough from how busy you were. And you finish cleaning up as the rest of your coworkers say their goodbyes and clock out after a long shift
>Strangely you notice bat bro is nowhere to be found, he usually hangs back to chat you up about whatever cheesy gore-fest b-movie he saw that weekend or some such
>His work area is clean and car is nowhere to be found in the near deserted parking lot as you pull away
>You figure he must have left early to avoid any further uneasy tension between you
>Once again just hope you have your bro back tomorrow and plan to finally take him up on his offer of a movie night between you two to try and lighten things
>Unbeknownst to you, as you pull out of the parking lot your headlights briefly illuminate the glossy finish of a vehicle hastily moved out of sight.
>Beady eyes watch from their vantage point, unseen, perched in a tree as a familiar car pulls away and accelerates down the road
>Leathery wings stretch to their full length, a few experimental flaps working out the stiffness of a of an exhausting workday
>This predator of the night could be at home, resting in bed alone again, fantasizing about the cute new human coworker he's been trying to seduce for the past few weeks
>But tonight, strange circumstance has ignited a fire within him. A desperate need to once again taste the ambrosia that was so tantalizingly withheld from him earlier that day
>the cold, stale blood bags from the donation center could not have prepared him for the euphoria of warm blood pooling in the mouth, a small furless body pressed against yours as you drink your fill...
>He snaps out of his fantasizing as the car pulls further down the road
>The predator takes to the sky silently and tails his prey. Invisible under the darkness of a new moon
>The hunt has begun.
