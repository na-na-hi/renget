Sentinels and Heroes.
 
Meb: It's good to finally be able to meet in a relaxed manner like this.
 
Kar: You said it. I mean, the last time we met was on top of the wall.
 
Meb: Looks like the trouble with that friend of yours got resolved somehow.
 
Kar: Yeah.
 
Yum: It has been quite a while, Miyoshi Karin-san.
 
Kar: And you haven't changed, Miroku.
 
Suz: Ehehe, thanks for that one time.
 
Kar: You came to our school a while ago, didn't you? To think you'd be a Sentinel...
 
Aya: I'm greatly indebted to Harunobu-san.
 
Kar: Thanks to you, too.
 
Meb: Looks like you have a lot of ties here, Miyoshi Karin.
 
Kar: If things were a little different, I could've been in your position, after all.
 
Meb: Yeah. A little different.
 
Aki: Who to choose as a Hero... The decision back then was correct. Looking at these results, I can say that with confidence.
 
Shi: Uh...
 
Aki: What's  wrong?
 
Shi: ...Welcome back, Aki-sensei.
 
Aki: Thank you... I'm back.
 
Suz: Oh, the rest of the Hero Club is here. Heeey!
 
Shi: Is Nogi there carrying... Bell peppers?
 
Aki: Eeh? Ah...
 
Kar: Right on time. Then let me introduce... my friends.
 
Meb: I'll introduce them too. My friends.
