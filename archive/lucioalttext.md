PFP/Icon ID: A picture of Brazilian Froggy DJ Lúcio Correia dos Santos from Overwatch in a pfp overlay. Lúcio has dark skin, and a visible tattoo on his left arm (our right). The camera is looking slightly up at him, and he himself is leaning towards the left. He is also wearing a bandana that has the Brazilian flag colors. The PFP overlay looks as if it is being eaten, with teeth at the top and bottom, with a bit of distortion so there are lines branching off of it.
This is a screenshot taken directly from the official Overwatch game!!
