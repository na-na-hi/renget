#Beta 1.7.3 Server Setup

####Which launcher should I pick?
The one launcher that I suggest is [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/releases/latest) as they no longer enforce Microsoft's DRM. 
####How do I add beta 1.7.3 to my launcher?
This guide is assuming that you are using PolyMC.
* Open your desired launcher
* Click on "Add Instance"
* Under "Filter" tick the "Beta" box and untick the "Releases" box
* Scroll up and look for the "b1.7.3" version, select that then click "OK"

####How do I add QOL modifications to my b1.7.3 instance?
This guide is also assuming that you are using PolyMC.
* Download your desired modification and open your desired launcher
* Select the instance you want to download the modification to and click "Edit Instance"
* Click on the "Version" tab and then click on "Add to Minecraft.jar" then choose your desired mod file.
