Comment: “Happy, responsible, relaxed, drowsy, sleepy, lethargic, social, curious, determined, if you keep her entertained she’ll listen and enjoy time with you, if you bore her she’ll fall asleep, she doesn’t like to be awaken unless it’s necessary, she loves to discuss weird and abstract things with humans, she loves to feel cozy around people she likes~”
