Extra: ???

Scolded heavily by her teachers, a lonely Hufflepuff girl was forced into the library, arms full of late assignments, on the verge of tears; thankfully the usually bustling repository of ancient knowledge was empty save for a few students.
She explored the room, looking for a secluded spot where she could daydream, she corrected her thoughts, work, on the assignments, the threat of detention with hooligans looming over her.
The chair creaked noisily as she moved it back with her foot, encumbered by the many volumes and scrolls, a nearby student glared at her, unbeknown to her. Finally unencumbered, she slumped down, sighing and cursing her fate.

Her lack of motivation prevented her from making any progress, she spent more time looking through the window longingly or sneaking glances at the young man sitting alone in the back of the room; she had never seen him even though he was a fellow Hufflepuff. He was, of course, fully aware of the glances.
The homework was difficult, the textbooks heavy, and the prose verbose. Holding her head with her hand, she was starting to doze off, bathed in warm sunlight coming from the window, her elbow sliding slowly until it slipped from the table.
Her chin slammed loudly on the table, her pen was sent flying and she yelped, eliciting a glare from the boy she loved looking at. Clicking his tongue, he stood up, picked up the pen and dropped in on her table, without a word. She couldn't help sneaking more glances now that he was closer than ever, blushing heavily. Getting bolder and bolder, she kept looking, until their gaze met, her blue eyes, his hazel eyes, she looked away in shame, missing his frown, as he went back to his seat, diving back into his book.
Her was beating fast and she felt a strong rush through her entire body, shakily, she picked up her pen, turned around and sniffed it shamefully.
Thinking herself hidden, she didn't realize the boy's inexpressive but gentle gaze had turned into a disgusted glare. He packed his things, stood up and took the long way down, not wanting to get closer to the freak.
Her heart was beating fast, imagining her whole life with the young man, various scenarii popping into her mind as she kept daydreaming instead of working on her assignments.

Of course her foolish actions had consequences and after a stern scolding she found herself in detention... With the boy.
Sitting in silence in the cold room the girl resumed her greedy voyeurism, he was writing in a small notebook, his hazel eyes focused on his work, sometimes sneaking a quick glance at her, annoyed.
The silence was interrupted by the door opening loudly and after a stern scolding from the teacher the both of them were sent to the library.

A mountain of books awaited the two of them, putting back misplaced books was kind of a weird first date, she thought, blushing heavily and shaking her head.
The young man worked fast and efficiently, unlike her, who was struggling with her short stature and poor magic skills; she was too focused on him to put proper effort into her work, watching him put back book after book, sometimes by hand, sometimes by wand.
Suddenly turning around, he walked confidently towards her, grabbing her trolley full of books as she fumbled, feeling defenseless and overwhelmed; much of the work was done, he did it all by himself and her useless self had only been gawking at him.
Without a word, he put back the last of the books before approaching her once more.
She hadn't moved an inch, still paralyzed, blushing and trembling, he forcefully grabbed the book still in her hand and put it back high above her head before grabbing his robes on the chair and exiting the library.

Her obsession only grew in intensity from that day on, her dreams, her daydreams, she spent her free time looking for him, trying to sneak many more glances at him, she didn't know what he had done to her but she couldn't stop.

One evening, feeling daring, she followed him around in the dungeons, he walked briskly, a book in his hand, steps echoing through the dark corridors.
Thinking herself invisible, she kept following, unaware he was trying to lose her, they walked and walked and walked, until she lost him.
Breaking into a run, she traversed the corridor, looking around, out of breath, heart heavy we regret.

Ambushing her, he grabbed her by the neck, pushing her against the wall, glaring intensely at her.
She panicked, blushing heavily, trying to catch her breath, legs going wild against the wall as he lifted her to his height "Stop following me." he said, calmly, looking straight into her eyes. Her gaze jumped between his eyes and his hand choking her as her hand grabbed it, trying to make it loose.
Letting go, he turned around as the girl fell. Too weak to get back on her feet, she stumbled into him.
He grabbed her by the collar "Don't touch me, you reek." he said, glaring at her damp underwear on full display, before throwing her against the wall.
Holding back tears, she meekly yelped "W-wait! I'm sorry..!"
The boy turned around, his glare even more intense, projecting pure hatred. "Sorry for what? Gawking at me? Letting me do all the work? Following me around like a dog for WEEKS?!"
He pulled her up by the collar once again, she was hiding her face, now streaming with tears. Wand in hand, her tore up the collar of her shirt, exposing her collarbone. "I'll make sure you properly apologize." he said, the tip of his wand lighting up with intense heat, she yelped and froze in fear.

An impossible heat hit her, she screamed at the top of her lungs, he slapped her hard "SHUT IT!" he yelled "Your voice is grating." he added, calmly, before pushing his wand against her collarbone again, making her scream loudly again.
"You asked for it, Silencio." now robbed of her voice, she was incapable of protesting the torture, and she couldn't even dream to overpower him, his large slender hand firmly grasping her neck as his wand approached ominously once again.
The burning heat was intense, and the glaring boy forcefully pushed her against the wall using the flaming wand, letting her slump down on the floor, breathing heavily, shaking heavily.
"Fantastic, you pissed yourself." he observed, disgusted.
The girl was laying on the floor, a sobbing mess, covered in urine, her shirt torn open, the dark hallway smelled of burned flesh and urine and the moonlight was casting the towering shadow of the young man on her trembling, weak frame.
"What's that, a diary?" he grabbed the book from her pocket, she protested weakly, still unable to speak, and utterly incapable of stopping him.

"I'm keeping this, don't make me use it." he said, leaving the room with a sigh.

It was all her fault, why couldn't she be normal, maybe if she had done things differently she could have been his friend, or maybe even more..?
Wallowing in despair, she laid there for hours, crying loudly, thinking back on her now shattered dreams, convincing herself she deserved all of it.
Worst of all, she somehow felt happy and strange rushes flowed through her entire body as she thought back on what happened.
Dried tears covering her face, she laid against the wall thinking horrible things about herself "I deserve this."
