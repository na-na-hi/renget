#->All Things to Know About Honkai<-
->By: VampyHime#9207 and Zero Blade#5805 (Edited by boba#8849)<-
This is to help you know what are the things that we players do such as converting or why are some things like that such as OW closing, this will be constantly updated if I ever find something I should write that many people would find useful. Read well and remember to use your eyes.

update:
Please keep in mind that I am trying to make it with as little as misinformation here , its still in the works I am planning to get this approved to be putted in the wiki if not discord server. This is going to a long time as updates can render some of this info useless or lacking so yeh lots of updating and refining is needed.

***
### Beginner
>What should be my priority as a beginner?
You should focus on getting **Herrscher of Sentience**(HS/HoS) usually from **expansion banner** if possible and **not** the starter banner. The priorities may change at some point, would recommend asking in the Official Honkai Discord's **#beginner-help** or **#gameplay-help** channels about how you should proceed.

> Tactics Class
The place to learn Honkai Impact's intricacies and practicing rotations if needed. Helps to deepen your understanding of the game's combat mechanics.
!!!info From Main screen or Bridge > attack > event > tactic class.

> In-Game recommendations
In-game recommendations are pretty much trash, period. E.g. Darwin is recommended for basically every lightning Valkyrie as an economic stigma set, but in reality it is not that worth it over Edison, especially how Darwin takes up materials like Phase Shifters that are valuable.
!!!note It is not always wrong but its a hit or miss, would recommend to ask in the Official Honkai Discord.

> How do I gain Experience(XP)
anything that cost stamina gives you experience to level up, other than BP missions found in missions > BP missions.
!!!note Stamina gained = Exp spent without bonuses such as ai-chan care / captain exp chips.


***
### Valks
> Is this valk good?
well many context is needed, but the main one is you should **ask first before pulling** who knows you might have obtained a weak valkyrie,  good one but one that is not worth for you due to your lack of resource, a farmable one or a great one. If its **A rank** it honestly doesn't matter much from a pull since they are **all farmable (with the exception of Blazing Hope/BH)** it just speeds it up, if **S rank some are farmable** like **Fallen Rosemary(FR)** and **Miss Pink Elf♪(MPE)**

> Is X valk better than Y valk
Context is needed heavily, but let's say its **Stygin Nymph(SN)** vs **Swallowtail Phantasm(SP)** its not really a fair comparison as SN's kit revolves around time fracture which is awesome in MA but abyss it doesn't really matter, while SPs most damaging ability is her charged during her ultimate which cost 125sp which is a lot and abyss give 90 starting sp so that's where she is better (and a mobbing valk so it definitely helps when fighting multiple enemies since Nymph is more of a bossing valk but she can mob just fine)
!!!note There are many scenarios this can apply to.

> Is Void Drifter worth investing?
not really unless you are a master camper or you don't have anything to do like **StFu (Striker Fulminata)**, she is an **Memorial Arena** Valkyire; focus on abyss first. 
!!!note Valkyrie Ranger's only use now is being an augment so this goes by extension of it.

> How to obtain fragments and other materials
If you are looking for Fragments or Souls for a valk and how to obtain them you can do this **Bridge > Valkyrja > Select a valk > Get (if unowned); if owned > tab with their Rank and Level > Get**
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985941544093757490/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985941616646844466/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985941713182937158/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985941836902313984/unknown.png)

It can show different methods, on how some only show when their banners are up or if they show up as a 4

> Summoned Entities
These are units that can help you in battle either through passives or effects, they cannot proc stigmatas like newton B, Jin Shengtan 2 set *unless* they are already summoned with added properties like OZ ult.
Some are exceptions like **Fallen Rosemary** as her runes and ult **do not count** as a summoned entity
!!!info From main screen or bridge  > valkyrja > choose a valk > skills >  read them and see if they count it as summoned entities or not to be sure; same can be said to weapons like Jizo mitama is summoned entity while 7 Thunders of Retribution makes Kurikara summoned if weapon active > finisher ult has been done (only if HT is off her and kurikara stays on the field).

> Burst mode 
This is a state where a valkyrie can enter via ult and it changes the valkyrie's atk sequence or changes some properties, I cannot give an exact definition as it is quite vague. The best way to tell if a valkyrie has this icon (🐣) ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/963676576589959188/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961835582370238505/963316867626307584/unknown.png)
!!!info From main screen or bridge > valkyrja > filter tab (left), to check what each valk can do.

> Enhanced form vs form change
Enhanced mode is just another state a valkyrie can enter via ult like **Blazing Hope(BH)** or **Infinite Ouroboros(IO)** can get more damage or a way to make their attacks hit harder and hit longer.
**Fervent Mode** is **exclusively so far to Twilight Paladin and Fervent Tempo** which can be activated via **charged atk or ult**.
**Herrscher mode** is **exclusive to Herrscher battlesuits** which **may be activated** by **Charged/Combo Atk or ult** (note it depends which herrscher since some are locked to getting herrscher mode in a limited way)
**Astral Harness** is **exclusive to Dea Anchora(DA) and Spina Astera(SpA)** via **charged atk**

Form Change is just switching their forms so far only **Stygian Nymph(SN)** and **Platinus Equinox(PE)** can do this by **tapping their ultimate**
one form is entirely not always superior than the other. one form is half of a coin.


> How Herrscher mode is activated
 **Herrscher of Reason (HoR/HR)** is **via charged atk or ult**, **Herrscher of the Void (HoV/HV)** is **via charged atk**, **Herrscher of Thunder(HoT/HT)** is **via combo atk or ult** note: if you have 7T then as long as kurikara is present you have herrscher mode on, **Herrscher of Sentience(HoS/HS)** is via **Ultimate**, **Herrscher of Flamescion(HoFS/HFS)** is via **using hold atk to enter it(does the snap if in air, swing sword if ground) or ult** and **Herrscher of Human: Ego(HoE/HoHE)** is **automatically always in herrscher mode**.
!!!note Every Herrscher that is on HoE or after are always permanently in herrscher mode 



> Switch Skill vs QTE
Switch Skill is something a valk will do automatically when switching to her like for SK switch she will lock on the enemy and drop on them, QTE is a special condition of a switch where it wont do the switch skill and instead uses a different one the conditions can be varied from **impair, weaken, freeze** and such.
Here I will be showing **Sakuno Rando(SR)** where she has 2 skills that has switch in the name, the **top one is the switch skill** while the **bottom is the QTE** as you can see in the description one reads **Switch: Lauches vs QTE: Triggered**
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985000666210644038/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985000666667827210/unknown.png)

Niche categories 
There is another niche that only **Vermillion Knight: Eclipse** has her **Switch Skill and QTE tied to the same skill**
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984654311483133962/985003003448819742/unknown.png)
!!!info QTE's can be turned off, Switch skill cannot

### Weapons/Gears 
> How to obtain resonance
Red - is from salvaging 4★ **Gacha/Bounty Stigmata** or **weekly open world rewards.**
Stigmata Resonance **1000 : 1/6** Exchange Stigmata
Blue - Converting 4★ **Gacha/Bounty Weapons**

> Converting Weapons
This is the process of turning 4★ Gacha/Bounty weapon/s into resonance which can be used for **Exchange Shop** for Weapons or in the **Asterite Shop** to buy **Einstein's Torus**. To start converting first make sure the weapon is not locked and not equipped then head over to the **Asterite Shop** and buy **10x Reson-Converters** which cost **2000 Asterite**, now go to from main screen or bridge **Equipment > Weapons > Salvage >Convert (top right)**.
Weapon Resonance **4000 : 1** Exchange Weapon
Weapon Resonance **1000 : 100** Einstein's torus 


***
### Shop
> Where to get asterite
Your ways to get asterite are **weekly OW rewards**, **weekly quiz** (dailies tab) and **refining materials** (main source).
You get **energy from duty**, energy allows you to **double asterite income** which is very helpful, to start refining go to **equipment > materials > bag with ⚡ (bottom right) > asterite.**  advanced skill materials, twin sakura wills, nano ceramics, spirit jades (once you are done upgrading your divine keys both as a weapon and the divine key room) and SS imaginons (once your g1 and basic stigmatas are done) are ones you can use as they are easily obtainable or ones that won't have much use later ones but don't refine **Phase Shifters**, **AE imaginons** as they are harder to come by or resources that you will **"never have enough"** like honkai cubes.

> How to gain witch orbs
you must own either a SSS version of a valk,, 4★ version of a gacha elf, or one of the easiest method is using Jingwei fragments, if you get it via logistics terminal purchasable with coins get it, the next head over to **equipment > fragments > Valkyrie or ELF > 🧩(bottom right)** then sell the highligted Jingwei frags or whatever frags they have excess of for their SSS valk (don't use blood embrace fragments as you will eventually get her to 4*)

>When does Shop Reset
when purchasing items you can see a limit like daily limit, weekly limit and version limit.

***
### Combat
> No or little damage 
well many reasons can be why you have no damage or very little of it.
gears - what kind of equipment do they have equipped?
comp - what team are they in?
rot - are you applying your **buffs and debuffs** correctly?
resistance - some enemies have varying resistance like **benares has high phys resist**.
immunity - Kallen is **elemental immune**, Herrscher of the Void is **lightning immune** ;she is also **physical immune** if she has **gem of haste activated** and such (you can check either **checking their profiles in abyss or memorial arena**  or **ai chan phone > collection > enemies**)
typing - are you **winning**, **losing** or **neutral** to type counter?
mechanics - some stages and bosses have mechanics that make it easier or harder to kill them (i.e Memorial Benares changes to a element based on your highest damage dealing valk)

> Fu Hua / Fuka ult
Hold b with sufficient sp; with a condition needed for HF
Valkyrie Accipter (VA)- 25 sp
Hawk of the Fog (HF)- 50 sp , must have done either evasion skill then hold b or AAABB (dash kick) hold B 
Shadow Knight (SK)- min 60 sp (drains sp overtime not in 1 go)
Phoenix( PX) / Night Squire (NS) - 100 sp
Azure Empyrea (AE) / Herrscher of Sentience (HoS/HS) -125 sp
!!!info  A is basic atk and B is ult 

> Type counter
Type counter is a 30% multiplier as it is calculated last so you can have **70% (lose typing)  / 100% (neutral)  / 130% (win typing)** of your overall dmg, **mecha > biologic > psychic > mecha, quantum > quantum, imaginary > imaginary, quantum < imaginary (same as vice versa)** . if you are the, **same type unless you are qua or img then its neutral and type counter won't be added**, **mech bio and psy are neutral to both img and qua and vice versa**.
!!!info Note: Type counter weathers increase the effect so its now 50% (losing type) / 100% (neutral) / 150% (winning type).

![type counter wheel by SinsOfSeven#3164](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/961835582370238505/1042066445481283604/TypeCounterWheel2.png)
**Credits to SinsofSeven#3164**

> Type Countered vs Type Countering
2 chips that are in Kolosten (story) has the following description **"valk deals more dmg vs type countering enemies"** and **"valk deals more more vs type countered enemies"**, in this case **type countering enemies means you lose the type counter** while **type countered enemies means you win the type counter**

> Mobbing vs Bossing
Mobbing is when there is multiple enemies(mobs), Bossing is when there is one enemy (usually a boss or mini boss).
!!!info Different valks can do different things, Night Squire (NS) can boss but can't mob, Swallowtail Phantasm (SP) can mob and boss.

> Elemental Bias
Early on you don't need to have an ice or fire dps,, as many options exist such as **Night Squire (NS)** or **Fervent Tempo (FT)**, now if its versus Benares or hell, **Hawk of the Fog (HF)** exists,, some valks like **Haxxor Bunny (HB)** who specialized in supporting ice cannot be used if there is no Ice dps; by this an actual good one , Reverist Calico synergies quite well with Haxxor which is one of the reasons why she is in ice teams

> Status Ailment
as of version 5.6 what we know about it has changed, Valks like **Azure Empyrea(AE)** can still ignite but now most if not all valks can apply their own trauma which is associated with that said element, so **Herrscher of Flamescion(HoFS/HFS/FK)** can apply ignite as a progression meter (cannot fill it in 1 rotation must be 2)
!!!info Fire = ignite, Ice = freeze, lightning = paralyze.		

> Quantum Shield
Quantum enemies have a shield called superposed stacks below their HP bar as indicated by a purple diamond.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/965289484080001024/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/965291751432663080/2022-04-17_11-44-30.png)
 
While in Superposed state (has the "shield") enemies have immunity for a lot of things + have high damage reduction, so its best to destroy it all when you are doing your all in attack, there are ways to temporarily destroy its "shield";only regains it once its collapsed + after some time it regens all the shield it lost all at once.

Collapsible Quantum Attack,, Quantum Valk's Ult, Eye of the Collapse (weapon active) and a mechanic like couatl's orb dropping.

**Collapse Qua Atk Indicator**
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/965294426299699240/unknown.png)
After Dodging you get this above your HP bar(Qua retribution), Atk the enemy and it can removes a layer

***
### Foundry
> Spirit Weapons
these are weaker version of the weapon assuming maxed (bounty weapons) and **always is lvl 50** , it has **more stats than a lvl 35 version** of it but it cannot salvaged or converted instead it turns into fuel, it has **roughly the same stats as lvl 45 but can be more (i.e PoS) or less (i.e Balmung)**, and the finished weapon can converted.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/984649836240453652/unknown.png)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/984649836613758976/unknown.png)

> Where to get time swirl passes
you can get this via mirage store most consistently, there's 90 tickets to be bought for 1 asterite with  limit of 1 (weekly), for time structures it cost 12 with limit of 50 gives 20 tickets(version) and ranger creds with 80 cost and limit of 2 (weekly) and gives 10 tickets;
the crystal one isn't worth it  but the price is 210 with a limit of 4(weekly) and gives 50 tickets.


***
### Co-op
> Tactical Training (outdated, research to update)
its a co-op stage that unlocks at 70 and above, last through **Monday to Friday** one attempt per day it gives rewards of fuel + spirit jades and if you used the UP valk you can get an additional random reward between **8 g1 crystallite, 5 g2 cystallite or 3 fuel**.
!!!info you get to choose this or dkey raid to open, material raid(raid on the 3rd from the left) is always open when it does show up


***
### Open World (OW)
> Changing Open World
to change which OW simply enter the main screen of that OW then find the globe icon in apho2 or select map in other maps.
!!!info Note: Sakura Samsara is locked till level 20,  Apho1 is locked till level 40 , Schicksal HQ is locked till level 50, Apho 2 is locked till you clear Apho 1.

> OW locked 
once your free access is gone (2 weeks after activation) you would need to use a weekly card that unlocks one eventually you will only get 1 ow every week, you can get the card every week reset (monday) when you try to gain access.

> What to pick for Adventure Tasks
The things you usually you wanna get there are Crystals. AE imaginons and Fragments for your Sp valks; though you can pick up SS imag and other materials if you need it like for your Stigmatas like marco polo TM, Glut and such that need to use 
!!!info Xtals tasks are rare, don't go outright looking for it.

> What affects the rewards for adventure tasks?
Your **Adventure level** is the biggest factor as some rewards won't show without you being a certain level, another is the **Task Rank** which is to say like **D, D+, C, C+, B, B+, A, A+, S, S+, SS,SS+,SSS, SSS+ and EX** and finally what OW you enter in samsara increases Sakura/SR frags

> What are adventure tasks and how are the rewards given?
You can pick an assortment of tasks ranging from collecting materials to stealth kills, to pick an adventure tasks **look for a board** , in samsara its an **board that holds Ema**, in Schicksal HQ its a **Big Screen**, in apho1 its a button named **Tasks Quests** and in apho2 its a **holographic screen** in your base.


***
### Others
> Is there an option to breakthrough?
Yes , it appears a lock (🔒) once you reach lvl 80. I would suggest breaking through once you do get it, as exalted has more rewards.
!!!info you can see it in profile.

> How do I skip pull animations
Main Screen or Bridge > Team list > My Team > +Create Team. Now head over to Supply>supply>select the banner choose your pull option (pull singles ideally)
!!!info You don't need to have teammates, all you need to do is create a team only

***
### WIP yet to be sorted
> Uprate vs Offrate
Uprate are the ones in the banner that are shown in the banner with the exception of dorm supply.
Offrate are the ones in the banner that are with the uprate (basically other things you can get there).
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/974556382974054400/unknown.png)
!!!info the highlighted gear is the uprate, while the rest are offrates

> How to Check Weather 
If exalted abyss:
Attack>challenge>superstring dimension>start>look to the right (there will be a stage with different weather vs the other 3)
If Schicksal HQ OW:
Attack>Story>OW>Schicksal HQ>
If Elysian Realm:

> Rank-up System/Constellation
This is a new system for S rank valks that do not have augments this apply to new S ranks from 4.6 and onwards but it can be added to older valks if they met the previous requirements.
each rank whether its sub rank(i.e S1/S2/S3) or rank improvement (SS/SSS) gives them something for the valks for example: 
S1 HoS boost crit damage gained while in herrscher mode (35% S0 to 60% S1) , S2 boost her lead skill

> Time slow vs Time lock vs Time fracture

> How to find rates on supplies
Main Bridge > Supply > Supplies > click a banner > click anywhere on it > scroll down > check supply rates

> Chronicle
unlocks at level 24 

> Chronicle Missions
Some of the missions in chronicles are "Clear 20 Chronicle Story Challenge stages" which is just repeat the stages 
and some are "obtain a total of 20,000 points in Chronicle Story Challenge stages" which is again just repeat the stages.

> Shield Threshold
this mostly applies to Herrscher of RimeStar with the weapon **Salvation of Sakura(SoS)** where level 50 it usually needs stigmatas like Turgenev TB or even equipped on a valk who counters rimestar like **Starlit Astrologos(SA)** 

> Gacha Elfs

> Rank Value on Valks
Farmable valks usually want SS/SSS (if DPS definitely SSS), Gacha valks usually are fine with S0 (older valks would want to more ranks like **Argent Knight: Artemis (AKA)** wants SS rank vs someone like **SilverWing: N-EX(SW)** is fine at S0)
!!!info if you are Free-to-play do not go for ranks on Gacha valks

> What are the Flags on Valkyries
when doing a team you notice flags on them this tells you who are in your team, the golden flag is the team leader.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/974447229903454208/unknown.png)

> Outfit Coupons
this are used to get outfits (not all outfits are found here only some)
There are 2 kinds the basic outfit coupons and the special outfit coupons:
Left is Basic outfit coupon, Right is Special outfit coupon
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/974560782505353226/unknown.png) ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/974560782769590272/unknown.png)
!!!info To use them from Main Screen or Bridge > LTO > Outfit > Basic/Special; you can use special outfit coupons when time capsule shows up

> Why is Rotating your valks important?
Rotating them is the case of applying and reapplying your buffs and debuffs so your dps can get a massive boost of dmg.
for example
a SSS rank HT 4/4 with no supports will lose to a S0 rank HT 4/4 with supports such as PV with waltz + Zhenyi and GD(Golden Diva) with echo + marg.
certain stigs like Jst 2 set piece must be proc by the host's atk such as BD and cannot be proc by summoned entities (i.e HB drone's), there are standby stigs however they usually give lesser buff and make rotations awkward.

> Memorial Scores
There are Uprate Scores and Non uprate scores for SS bosses the highest score possible in non uprate is 31946 and for uprate its 38336;
SSS bosses are only found in Exalted, Left image is for people in exalted, Right image is for Masters, (remove the bottom boss if elites or basics)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/430057371641970708/974448533967093790/unknown.png) ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/901268521181401108/974450651272720485/IMG_2476.png)
!!!info The boss at the top is always 20% score increase
 
> Foundry vs Bounty Weapons
Foundry weapons are the ones that only take Anti-Entronpy Imaginons to make them or ones that use Honkai Pieces
Bounty weapons use crystallites from mirage + AE imag + spirit version of itself (with the exceptions with abyss and fenghuang pinions) and ether fuel. With also the exceptions of abyss and pinions (because they are divine keys to sync with abyss flower and fenghuang down for +10 atk each) you can use them as pri-arm fodders (as long as you unlocked the recipe with the base ver of the pri like Sleepri and its pre-requisite is either Sleeping Beauty or Swan Lake)

> What is Universal Mirage?
It is something that is unlocked at lvl 28, (Attack>challenge>Universal Mirage) that allows you to farm some gears that are usable from early to even all the way to exalted
!!!info Do not upgrade foundry weapons

> Leveling vs Investing on Valkyries

> Pri(Material) Raid vs Blockade
These 2 alternate every 2 weeks 

> How to acquire gears?
You can get them via Foundry, Universal Mirage, Exchange shop and Gacha
!!!info Gears can refer both to Weapons and Stigmatas

> How many Crystals is enough?
There will be never enough crystals(xtals) as there is constant updates with new gears and new valks, Sp valks are big examples of powerful support gears like Paganini / Turgenev and such. that can really enhance your damage output
There is the recommended the more you have the more likely you can full gear them. usually 3 patches is enough to get 4/4 for a new S rank dps (for F2p or a bit less if bp + monthly) but this depends as rng is still present but you can mitigate this with more xtals.

> Foundry Filter
There is a filter for foundry, one is "Sort by Equippers" and the other is filter
the sort by equippers is essentially useless it doesn't give as much info and restricts the items there that have "recommended" stats for them which is usually a hit or miss
the actual filter you want is the funnel with a list button *insert image* as this makes it easier by sorting them into different tiers (mirage) of g1/g2/g3/g4 or even basic stigmata("g0") with different dmg type of fire/lightning/ice/phys.

> Bouncer vs Retainer vs Demote
This refers to abyss, a bouncer is someone who can get to 2 different ranks in abyss consistently like Agony to Red Lotus to Agony; retainer is someone who stays in the same rank agony to agony to agony; demote is when someone goes down a rank like Red Lotus to Agony to Sinful.

> Drift World
This is something you unlock in weekday/weekend material stage starting level 50 (same time as ELF)

> July valk
This is usually a **playable herrscher** that is **released on july based on chinese server** schedule, for the rest of us is august but since china is the origin of the game we usually refer to that instead.

> When is next version update?
Patch day is always Thursday and happens at the last week of Memorial Arena of the current patch
!!!note Thursday has no abyss which is basically the rest day for Honkai Players

> Why can't I farm X valk on new patch?
This kind of question towards Sp valks or any farmable valk that is newly released, if its just day 1 of new patch wait for monday for their fragments to be available such as asterite shop/gold pins and such, however in Open World they are there (if its one of the methods to obtain )but it will not be enough to obtain them 

> Collab vs Crossover
version 4.5 introduced Asuka from the evangelion series being playable and it was a **collab** as she was owned by a different company therefore understandable it will be only on that specific patch where you can get her 
on the other hand version 4.9 introduced Fischl from genshin impact being playable, that was a **crossover** as fischl is owned by Hoyoverse(originally miHoYo) the same company who made Honkai so it wouldn't make sense that she would be only on version 4.9 since they own the rights and copyright.
