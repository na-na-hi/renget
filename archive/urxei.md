### Drekus Visits You

Today, Drekus is stalking little heroes. He has eaten corpse of mutant who had super stealthy teleport quirk. The voice irritates Drekus. He will remove extra quirk when finished.

>Ashleigh & Mio
The father is gone. Two children live in house. One quiet and sad, and one short like unruly stump. Drekus watches them from window. The yellow one mocks the other. Why doesn't the larger one simply eat the tiny one? Drekus leaves them apple pie on doorstep so they can learn to share.

>Hifumi & Hailey
Boy is swinging stick early in morning, who is he fighting? He has eyes closed. Drekus stands next to him and attacks the air too. Poor boy must see visions like Drekus. Sleepy girl arrives by car, bringing boy mermaid coffee full of foam. Drekus hides in trunk of car and listens to conversation. They are not talking much.... They are wrestling? Drekus roars in boredom and frustration! The driver stops the car. Drekus flees.

>Hoge
Hazy girl is walking alone. No one wants her, much like Drekus. She is sad. Bird chirping noise from phone. Now she is not so sad? She must like birds. Drekus see her run across street. Arms behind her, she is pretending to be plane maybe. A fast truck is coming! Drekus stops truck from behind before she loses arms. Be more careful hazy girl!

>Hiro + Genma
Drekus is in garage, hiding behind set of tires. There are two boys, older than the others. One hands the other special liquid in container. They place it in motorbike. Smoking boy rides the bike. Motorbike releasing smoke, not just black, but also red, green, and blue smoke. They clap hands. Why they happy? Engine who smoke like this is useless. Drekus approaches table, he changes formula just a little. They will like new formula. But also maybe bike explodes. Drekus does not stay to see what happens.

>Inigo
Smiling boy is ladling at soup kitchen. Many are sad here. Poor pathetic people but green imp and boy make people laugh and cheery. Drekus is hungry. He gets in line. Smiling boy gives Drekus extra soup, winks at Drekus, shoots him with invisible hand pistol. Drekus growls but is unaffected, so he does not attack. The bullets must be weak. Drekus distrusts the green imp on boy's shoulder. It is witch familiar, boy must make soup in witch cauldron too. Still good soup. Maybe burn them later.

>Bobby 
Drekus is eating bowl of ramen, keeps head low under hood. The grinning sunny boy is working here. He gives Drekus complimentary egg. Drekus pockets the egg. Boy is leaving now. Shift is over. Drekus follows. Boy is at grocery store looking for discounts. He is excited over sale on bread. Then sad, paycheck not enough to buy all the things. Angry cashier makes him put items away. Drekus stuffs cashier into locker and replaces him. "Yes yes, you can have for free? It is free day. You take it! Go!"

>Chihiro & Shion & Walpurgis
Girl is walking to waterfall. She is about to bathe? Drekus should not be here. He will leave. Wait. Girl is dancing instead. Sword dancing waterfall girl. Sparkling. Pretty. Sudden commotion! A large water lady is chasing a laughing thief. Now waterfall girl is chasing too. All three are on the roof now. Drekus thinks people should come here for pretty waterfall. He will tell tour group near sewer lair to come later.

>Owari
Drekus watches unwanted boy get kicked out of unmarked van by agent-man. He is bleeding and dirty. Very very tired. He curls up under tree. It is raining and water drips down on boy's face but he still falls asleep. Drekus fixes leaves so boy has cover, leaves him complimentary egg from pocket. It is good for hard times. Waking up snack for sad boy.

>Junichi
Another sad unwanted boy. This one works in convenience mart. Boy leaves on break. Drekus watches fight training. Bones are coming out of boy's body. This is not the way. Bones should not do that. Drekus approaches boy and offers surgery. This is the way to fix bones. Will be 100% better. Boy says no homeless allowed, break is over, he goes back to work. It is shame he does not believe in Drekus.

>Imai
The tri-clops is buying notebooks at store. He stops by Manga section. He is looking at books with witch girls in magical dresses. He thinks nobody sees this, but Drekus does. Tri-clops boy is smiling, whistling witch girl theme. Group of laughing others walk pass, boy hides away in shame. Why? You must show more pride! Drekus slips witch-girl book in shop bag while he is paying.

>Sally + Christopher
Drekus peeks through windows. Boy is trying to write in journal. Girl from other floor keeps shooting off gun. Big booming noise. Rubber bullets. Many notebooks fall off shelves. Boy stomps on floor. She quiets down. She is arming biggest loudest bullets. Poor boy may not sleep tonight.

>Noah
Feather boy is kneeling in front of altar at church. Many people here. They do not question Drekus. Boy is praying to spread love and kindness to world. It is good prayer, but he should also ask for power. Drekus kneels down and asks for power for boy. Feather Boy sees Drekus. "Noah wishes that peace be with you." "Drekus does the same for you." Drekus likes how feather-boy talks.

>Kaylee + Jugo
The two are confronting each other. Big match or just practice? Drekus brings popcorn and watch. But they are only yelling and charging up. No more popcorn. Drekus leaves. Comes back hours later. They are still at it. Must be filler episode.

>Yui + Orochi
Drekus is hiding inside arcade. There is police car outside. He must not be spotted. Stand in front of machine. Two hero girls walk by. They are excited for new punching game. They point at Drekus. Drekus freeze. First one with ribbons punches Drekus. Drekus dizzy now. Snakey elf girl go next, she does jumping spinning punch. Drekus' jaw broken but it will heal. They use up all coins and go away, mad that no tickets come out of Drekus.

>Minnie + Edie + Max + Faith
Drekus is in nice smelling apartment. Loud party music coming from long hallway. Drekus walks inside empty bedroom. Many pictures of sunny boy here. He hears noise. Four girls are coming. He runs to main room. Hides behind table. Girls are yelling about foul smell. They say it smells bad. Not caused by Drekus. Drekus showers every day in cleanest sewer water. They are looking around. Arguing. More yelling. They are blaming each other now. One is crying. Lots of pointing. Another screams. They are making up. Too much talking! Drekus can stand no more. He flees again.

>Impakt Agency
Drekus appears inside hero building. Two heroes quickly come ready to fight. Hero-Son and Floorman attack Drekus. "Wait, Drekus only here for free tour!" Holds out ticket. Floorman checks it. It is official. Both frustrated. They give tour. Drekus thinks building nice, but too many equipment and colors clash a bit. They go get ramen and karaoke after. After tour, Impakt takes Drekus to jail. "Caught me again... Impakt." Drekus curls up in jail cell to sleep. It is good day.
