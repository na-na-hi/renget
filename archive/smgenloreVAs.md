# -> The Sound of Autism: VA Aside <-

SMITE's got a lot of VAs.
Hundreds of them.
Over 1,000 individual VAs as of writing.
You might have heard their voices somewhere else before *(given SMITE, quite oddly, has an \*absurdly\* good quality English cast in terms of it's scope and budget)* - so I'll quickly clear up what is and is not schizophrenia on your end; you can decide from there on whether you want to take your meds or not. I've not got the time to cover every skin in the game or every role each actor has done, so I'll just be sticking to defaults / classics and lead / main voices you will probably recognise *(over \*Background Character #29665\* from \*Who: The Adventures of What\*) ~~or at the very least, since there's quite a lot of series I'm not into, I'll be basing 'relevence' off of what I've seen via reaction images / lurking the site etc and who seems to be recognisable~~*. You might notice a few repeated names, but preese unnastan - this bit's probably going to be used mostly for people looking up their main and 1-2 others, so I may as well do them all equally and at once.

Major *(major)* dubbing roles that should be immediately recognisable will be in **bold**.
Alphabetically in order of cross-roles within LoRez, then subjectively in what I'd imagine to be an order of recognition to a given Anon, with special inclusions for other mythological names and VA has done in other series. You'll notice many of these are /v/ and /a/ >dubs, but they're VA's, it's the name of the game - I've also gone to the delight of..... 'visualising' some of the series, when they share multiple VA's with SMITE, just to add to the mindfuckery.
**Naturally, major weeb warning ahead.**

*Phew!*
And that's just the default VAs. Oh, and 'sorry' if I missed any major names in some shows in particular ~~but I just don't care enough to care~~.
If I had included skins, it would take forfuckingever to do fully - but you'd also know why your schizosenses can hear Ash Ketchum (Senpai Slayer Serqet + others), ~~Twilight Sparkle~~ Nier 2B (Defiant Bellona + others), Ryu / Gohan (Crystal Colossus Ymir), Krillin / Usopp / Korosensei / Lupin III (Dreadbeard Poseidon), Asuka Langley (Soothsayer Morrigan) and the Re:Zero Cat Tranny (Marvelous Maid Amatersu) in-game. Oh, and basically all the crossover skins are indeed the same (or current) voice actors for the crossover; while there's a few fill-ins, it's usually because the original VA is either dead or retired. It's unironically a star-studded cast... at least in terms of the >dub scene *(hey, the proverbial stars might be made of proverbial plastic, but you can't tell the difference from a distance)*.

As for personal speculation why this is the case, while I'm not too versed in the culture or deeplore of >western >dubbing 'scene', the three factors at popped out at me while writing this up are:
1. American English dubbing seems to have 3 'scenes', where lots of studios / talent acquisition focuses itself - these being 'the LA scene', 'the Texas scene' and 'the New York scene'. While this creates an incestuous industry where amateur talent gets grandfathered in easily *~~(hey, I've heard this one before! it's the problem with all of >westshit dubbing!)~~*, it does allow for scripts to pull a large amount of VA's in quickly and for VA's to semi-easily establish a base of operations / connections. For this example, it appears SMITE generally pulls from the Texas scene. This is also why some shows keep popping up, while other large-scale Voice Acting works you'd expect to see more of are barely mentioned - each pulls mostly from a different scene outside of a few bigger names.
2. Chris Sabat (voice of Zeus) is the VA director of this game - and while I'm not sure how influential that is in the process of getting VAs on board, it probably helps that the lead director is a big name within the industry itself - able to pull from the nebulous concept known as 'networking'. I know for a fact too that some of the community managers / assistants / interns know a lot of names within the industry (as has been stated in some dev interviews), so that's even more for the case of good networking on behalf of Titanforge.
3. The game itself seems to work as established 'stepladder' into the wider / major Voice Acting industry - while lots of the initial / older VAs are the more established VAs, the newer VAs use it as a way to build themselves up a strong portfolio to move into a more 'lead' role elsewhere, while establishing their own connections while working on SMITE. Not to say the more recent names are all newfags and interns, but it anecdotally appears that way for the most part *(the "process" being to do some acting for a skin voice pack, 'earning' your way to a default God VA, and from there having a built up resume to get a bigger role within the wider industry)*


Final words; I *seriously* hope you don't watch >dubs.
~~The best part of all this is... I don't even play with audio, I just listen to music / videos. I'm functionally deaf in-game *lol*. This section literally means nothing to me, it's just *a big aside, for (You)*.~~
