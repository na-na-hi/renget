Today we have an extremely interesting piece about Kazakhs, corruption and russophobia. 

This whole post will be based on the materials of a very worthy blogger from Kazakhstan, who uncovers all sorts of corruption schemes of the Bays and also covers their national movement. 

For those who don't like long articles, there will be a spoiler a couple of lines below. But Anton, based on his material, starts right at the core, starting at the top and working his way down the chain below. I want to take you from the bottom to the top, so that you can first feel the charm of the Central Asian corruption, and then be horrified at where things are headed.

Spoiler alert: https://t.me/GrpatKZ/10182

The first piece of information: the Russian investment company Freedom Finance by Timur Turlov, who became a dollar billionaire after moving to Kazakhstan. There's the classic Cyprus withdrawal scam, and FF itself has already been called ["Kazakhstan's dumbest product since Borat"](https://ffj-online.org/2020/12/14/freedom-holding-corporation-after-borat-the-silliest-kazakh-import-of-the-century) a couple of years ago.

In 2020, Turlov's FF buys out Kassa Nova bank from Bulat Utemuratov, [effectively saving](https://kompromat1.pro/articles/168137-arest_imushchestva_v_5_milliardov_bulat_utemuratov_lishilsja_nazhitogo_nepassivnym_trudom) it and keeping it afloat after the UK seized its assets. Thus, we can say that Turlov was saving Utemuratov's assets.

Let us note: a Russian businessman, who used to work in a high position in a bank which cheated Russian citizens out of 4bn rubles, moved to Kazakhstan, made his fortune in a scam (which he could not have done without close interaction with the elites of this country) and did a favor to a Kazakh oligarch.

Doing a favor to Bulat is actually equivalent to doing a good favor to the Nazarbayev clan, with whom he is closely connected. But here he was able to benefit much more for himself than it may seem at first glance.

Kassa Nova at that time was one of the smallest banks of Kazakhstan, ideally suited for the role of a personal money laundering office of a swindler. 

There is an interesting person in Kazakhstan. Togzhan Kozhaliyeva is an ardent Russophobe (in reality a scam artist, riding a wave of fear of Russia), who from the first days of the war campaigned for Ukraine and even collected money for humanitarian aid. On his channel, Anton posted a screenshot of her posts, where she shows receipts with transfers to her fund, attention, from Turlov. And the money there is a lot of money. 

![Togzhan](https://files.catbox.moe/lezutr.jpg)

Why would he do that? Having an office in Ukraine, he could have taken the money directly there or simply invested in one of the European funds to help hungry piglets, but instead he allegedly invested a huge sum in a Kazakh Russophobe's fund so that trucks with humanitarian aid to hohols could travel an extra couple of thousand kilometers. Yes, in Kazakhstan, as it turns out, some individuals have made very good money on the wave of hysteria and fear of Russians among the masses. Of course, the enterprising Togzhan did not provide any sane proofs of sending help, although the Kazakhs piled into her fund.

The "financial genius" is doing his business, but what does it have to do with the Russians and Russia and how it affects us?

Have patience, there is a lot of information ahead.

Turlov is directly linked to another Kazakh figure - Kairat Kudaibergenov.

![Kudaibergen](https://smi24.kz/userdata/article/2022/article_171759/image.jpg.webp)

This is even more interesting character, who is in custody after January events. An ex-deputy, a corrupt and extremely nasty type, who was sponsored by... Turlov.

According to the Prosecutor's Office of Almaty, during the January events Kudaibergen together with the criminal authority Arman Dzhumageldiev organized a gathering of people in the Almaty Hotel "Kazakhstan" and "participated in mass disturbances".

And even so nobody touched his company. Not at all. Anton, by the way, in a separate video showed the evidence of Kairat's connection with Nazarbayev clan.

Kairat is connected with one more weighty figure in Kazakhstan - Kenes Rakishev. That guy is quite a "billionaire, philanthropist and playboy"
.
![Rakishev](https://www.peoples.ru/undertake/founder/kenes_rakishev/7z5qxA0shMKZj.jpeg)

He makes a lot of money on [corrupt schemes](https://youtu.be/PY8WCKJ3PVY). For example, through his own bank, sponsored by the state fund, which is directly sponsored by taxpayers' money, he gave himself a loan secured by his own land for a future scam on green energy.

Funny thing: he was involved in the development of Ramzan Kadyrov's "palace" in Grozny. As Russian journalists managed to [find out](https://www.agents.media/inoagent-kadyrov/).

In the original publication, the link to which I gave at the very beginning, there is an interesting photo, where from left to right Rakishev, Biden with his son and Karim Masimov - one of the most influential men of Nazarbayev, who is accused of organizing the January events. By the way, there are a lot of materials about connections of Rakishev and Masimov.

And here we come to the point.

Kenes Rakishev is married to the daughter of Imangali Tasmagambetov, a prominent Kazakh statesman and... the new secretary general of the CSTO.

Honestly, I'm freaking out about all of this, and there's a lot that I just don't understand. 

After January, Tokayev seriously cleaned up his opponents from the Nazarbayev clan, but apparently not all of them, and they still have serious influence in the republic. 

But what I've found out for sure is that Russophobia is no more than the instrument of management of their Indians. It is skillfully saddled and exploited so that the Kazakhs see Russia and the Russians as a threat, and not those who tell them stories about their former greatness, which was stolen by the evil white men who came from the north. 

These tales fit perfectly in the heads of not too educated steppe people, showing them where the enemy is. So yes, though there is Russophobia from below, and it is significant, its strengthening comes from above. Readovka already told about the ties of Kazakhstani officials with the figures from the language patrols.

What should Russia do in this situation?

Work with the elites. Either re-buy, or tear down the old ones and nurture the loyal ones. Without an impulse from above, the hatred for the Russians will remain a local phenomenon, which will be crushed by the local security services without any problems.

But if things continue in the same spirit, sooner or later this filth will be strengthened in Kazakhs as it was in hohols. Then we will have to go to a new war, to raze to the ground once Russian cities and literally exterminate the male population of Kazakhstan, as is happening now with Ukraine.
