# Detective Watson and Inspector Anon

-> *A fanfic with chapters (lasting as long as I'm interested)  where you, a remarkably unremarkable Anon has moved to the big city in search of a job but because you're a 4chan lurker (even worse, you browse /vt/), the pickings were slim. Fortunately,  it just so happens that a lovely girl is searching for a new partner at her agency.* <-

❝ Fuck! ❞
You really should have checked the weather app on your phone, listened to the news. The downpour came out of left field, ruining the once wonderful sunny weather and also any exposed parts of your outfit. You were dressed all nicely too for the interview at the bank with your brown dress shoes, khaki jeans, a white dress shirt, ruby red tie and your tan blazer. It was probably the nicest you'd ever been dressed, and you'd die before admitting that it was a hand-me-down from your grandpa. Still, you hoped you'd meet the dress code at the place and make a good impression on them. 

Luckily, your blazer was waterproof and you held it over your head, running down the street to a covered bus stop. Your pants were going to be fucked up for sure, there were splotches all over the light colored fabric and the bottom hems were a mess from stomping through a few puddles. As you made under the cover, you quickly looked over your clothes and your heart began to slowly sink into the depths of your stomach. You were going to look like a damn mess, walking through the front doors of a bank looking like you ran through a car wash.

The rain was incessant with its pounding, sounding like someone had a garden hose pointed right at the bus stop. You grimaced as you watched cars drive right on past. People in their nice warm vehicles, with their heaters and windshield wipers and licenses. Should've gotten your license out in the boonies while you still could have. 

" Terrible fuckin' weather, amiright? "
A feminine voice piped up from next to you.

❝ Yeah, tell me about it. I got an interview at the bank in.. ❞
You pulled out your phone and winced. ❝ Two minutes. I'm not gonna make it. ❞ You said, murmuring the last part softly under your breath as you texted your interviewer saying you'd be a couple of minutes late because of the rain. Glancing over at the other person taking shelter from the deluge, you took in her appearance.

A girl, shorter than you by far. She barely came up to your shoulder, dressed in.. pretty much the same color scheme as you. A white dress shirt, a skirt that reminded you of a cross-section of a coffee cake of sorts, black stockings (hot) and.. were those clogs? Slippers? They looked sort of clunky. You watched as the woefully underdressed female rustled through a messenger back, cursing quietly to herself, digging out a hat and sighing to herself. " The one day I stain my jacket with coffee and it's in the wash, it starts raining.. " 

She was cute, the way her wet shoulder length blonde hair framed her angelic looking face, how she blew her bangs out of her face and stared at the rain with such disdain that you'd think she was about to pick a fight with every single drop of water. " Doesn't look like the rain's gonna let up anytime soon, pal. You should probably get to that interview. " She said, shivering slightly and rubbing her hands together.

❝ Yeah, you're right.. I'm just gonna have to bite the bullet and go. See ya laters, friend. ❞
" Buh-bye. "

And back into the rain you went. You needed that job bad. You couldn't just live off those savings of yours forever. You made it a good twenty feet away before you got a phone call, and the chime was recognizable- you made it just this way so you wouldn't just decline it like every other call. Your interviewer. Fumbling into your pocket, you fished it out and power walked down the street while answering. ❝ Anon speakin- ❞
" Hey Anon, it's Fischer from Northwind Bank. Sorry, but the position was taken by another individual. They were just more qualified and- "
❝ No, it's alright. Thanks for giving me the time of day though. Goodbye. ❞

You hung up and stood there in the rain, closing your eyes and letting the rain run down your face.
And you fucked up your first interview. A sort of cold numbness that had nothing to do with the rain seeped into your body. So what were you supposed to do now? As you turned to start the walk back to your apartment, a stray thought became a bit more appealing than the others. You didn't want to go back to the dark of your room and browse 4chan again, or play all those random games and fill your head with idle junk.

Maybe she was still there?

Jogging back through the rain, you eventually found the bus stop- and her. You shocked her with your approach though, jolting her out of her daydreaming and making her sit up a bit straighter. " You either nailed that interview or you bombed completely. "
A pause.
" Your face tells me everything you need to know. "

❝ Yeah, I almost made it there, I guess. Some other guy took the spot, so I'm outta a job for now though. ❞
Taking a seat on the far side of the bench, there was a few moments of silence before she spoke again. " So uh, why'd you come back? " The blonde asked curiously, staring at you with absolutely dazzlingly bright sky blue eyes. They were electric, filled with determination and vigor and all that good stuff. ❝ I mean, you're an interesting looking person, I guess. ❞ You gestured at your outfit and then hers. ❝ We're kinda matching. ❞
" So we are. That's a pretty neat coincidence! " Raising an eyebrow, she slowly began to smile. " You need a job, right? "
❝ Sure do. ❞
" You like police shows? "
❝ I've watched Live PD and a few true crime documentaries. ❞
" Wanna be my partner at my agency? I run a sorta private eye deal, we help solve crimes and weird happenings around the city- the stuff that police can't usually do. "

Now your turn to raise an eyebrow, you turned to face her and folded your arms across your chest. ❝ Don't you like, need a license for that? ❞ A shake of her head. " Nope. Starting pay's fifteen dollars an hour, you get free coffee an- "

You held up your hand to stop her, then outstretched it.
❝ You had me at fifteen dollars an hour. I'd love to join.. what's your name again? ❞

She took your hand and gave it a firm shake, winking at you.
" Watson. Amelia Watson. "
