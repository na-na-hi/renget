#Yoji Relationship Chart
***
Yoji Ryoshi sat in his 'office'. In the back of the church he cares for, a room has been converted to a stereotypical detective's office. He even has a board on the wall with photos on them. He didn't put up any strings up, though. His eye takes care of that problem.

"So, mister priest... you can help me find my cat?"
"I believe so."

In front of Yoji was a local 9 year old girl, who had taken up his ad to utilize his amateur detective skills.
She had lost her cat. Strangely enough, she also had a Demon Eye. A really crappy one, but she did. Yoji found it quite peculiar that she had one at all.

*"This little girl has a Demon Eye? What the hell! This is outrageous! Should I call child services?"*

"So, I can see sparklies! When funny people use their funny eyes, I see sparklies! And I found sparklies on my cat's bed! I think a funny person took him!"
"I understand."

Yoji's eyes flashed golden, and he saw the connections of the girl.

"Ooh, you're doing the sparkly thing!"

Most of the connections he saw were of the same color: 'really likes', a nice shade of pink. At least, she probably wasn't being abused to have her eye. Seems she's just weird.

*"Hmph, she seems to feel the same way about plenty of things. That's sweet, but incredibly unhelpful."*

"Are you sure the... 'sparklies' weren't from your 'funny eye'?"
"Uhh, yeah! Uh huh!"
"Hmph."

Yoji went to his desk and opened up a drawer, and then took out a small scrapbook.

"Ooh, what's that!"
"A list of people of interest."
"Can I see?"
"Sorry. Some of these people aren't... child friendly."
"Awww."

*"Alright, let's see... which one of you nutcases stole a cat? What nefarious purpose do you have in store for your feline captive?... Probably nothing, because I doubt any of you stole him..."*

Yoji began to look over the entries.

>Mari Aozaki
Reliable and trustworthy. I try not to disappoint her; she's tries to help herself for her mental health. I recommended speech therapy once. I don't think she took kindly to that. Always check up on her after missions in case she doesn't speak up about injuries. I could read her mind for conversations but that's weird. I wish she found a better alternative to sleeping pills; hopefully her current method is safe enough.

>Eiyu Isamu
Doesn't know about the paranormal. Good kid. Try and keep him out of things. Keep an eye on him. I think he wants to pick fights with certain individuals who should not have fights picked with. 
*(It's written in pen so he didn't bother ripping the page out after that poorly worded last sentence.)

>Emilia Shadowsong
No way that's her real name, but I can't find anything different. Good kid. Not many issues, but she should still come see me when her Demon Arm becomes painful. I think she finds me unfun.

>Ikari Michita
I invite him to church whenever I can. I think he needs some light in his life. He doesn't really come, though. I think he needs someone more on his wavelength to help me socialize him. Not many willing. Can't stop trying.

>Naoki Arai
Needs to let things go. Needs to be satisfied for once. Needs to come to me more often because every time I see him he has a new wound from something. And he's sickly for an Eye Bearer. Does not heed warnings to stay away from the Lust-inclined. Sadly for him, it ends up working out in my favor.

>Akari Ichioka
Reliable... sometimes. Stubborn, and very comitted to the role. I notice that she self-harms. Hard to heal her due to her being a "Vampire". Good kid, but I really wish she would let me help her. I invite her to church to help with socializing.

>Lem Amano
Unhealthy lifestyle. In need of charity. I'm trying to start up a homeless shelter project for the church; I hope to give him a place to stay if I can. Maybe then he'll stop filiming those creepy videos. If he begins a certain genre, he requires immediate intervention.

>Hifumi Ishiku
Sezāru's sister. I know almost nothing about her, except from passing mentions from her brother and what I gleamed from her mind on a chance meeting. Also, his passing thoughts. I choose to keep quiet about his peculiarities. I hope she gets better; inviting her to church may be a good idea.

>Hinako Shimeki
*blank until Akarianon finishes that writefag or makes a relationship chart for reference on their meeting; whichever comes first*

>Yoru Heinard
One of the most troubled people I know. I try to help her the best I can; nothing seems to be working. Don't trust her around people she would find attractive. Currently using the steady approach: invite her to church, keeo her from being weird for a short period of time and socialization. 

>Sezāru Ishiku
The reason why no one can read this scrapbook. I gleamed his true thoughts; we have come to an agreement. In order to save him from embarassment and to salvage his reputation, I will speak nothing of his tendencies. He will attempt to tone it down. I try and invite him to church. He loves to bring snacks.

>Kazuki Asahara
Practically a snake oil salesman. Doesn't hang around my church; I think he runs one of those strange big city ones. I can tell he doesn't exactly try to work on his issues; I hope he does someday.

>Amane Shiozaki
I used to find her incredibly normal. Turns out that she is a complete recluse. Inch by inch, I am trying to get her to go to church and socialize more. I am unsure of my progress. Impressive library and knowledge. Reliable for what she does.

>Makoto Nagai
Also one of the most troubled people I know. Incredibly unreliable. I try and get him to go to church, but it's almost impossible to get him to do anything. He's the slimy type. Hopefully, socialization will get him to be less awful.

>Komaru Nishitani
*Criminals Section*
Almost nothing known about her. All that is known is that she is should be dealt with.

>Yoji Ryoshi
If I let you read this book, this is the section I want you to find. Under the desk of this office, a trapdoor leads to the basement. Figure out what to do from there.

>Mithran Kuro
Very troubled. She needs to come to me more often to be healed. Very antisocial, and I can tell that she self-harms. I invite her to church when I can; she doesn't turn up very often. Hopefully, I can socialize her. Too worried about perfection.

>Haruhi Oohara
For once, it isn't much of a hassle to heal her Demon Arm when it becomes painful. On the other, she's a bit off. She isn't obvious with her sin, but I can tell that she has something going on. I think she's just plain vain. Hopefully going to church may help with her issues.

>Yuki Tanaka
He seems to be being torn apart by his own power. I can tell that he may only have 10 years left before he succumbs, and regrettably, there is no way I can help. I invite him to church often; I hope he can find peace.

>Aki Hitoyoshu
He also seems to be being torn apart by his own power like Yuki, but his condition is far worse. Unfortunately, he may only have within 5 years before he succumbs. Incredibly antisocial. I invite him to church often; no matter his peculiarities, I do not wish to ban him from entry. There seems to be little I can do to help.

>Jace Abraxon
Quite bizarre; the use of my Eye reveals a string that abruptly ends in the air, and has a color that I have never seen before. Once, I have seen the string disappear. Overall strange, but I find him to be harmless. He should be good for Aki.

*"...Yeah, none of them stole a cat."*

Suddenly, Yoji got a glimpse of one of the girl's pink strings moving in a peculiar way.

As his eyes followed the string, out of the window, he saw it connected to a cat eating from the bowl of kibble he had put out a couple days ago, after he saw some strays. He got the attention of the girl by clearing his voice, and pointed directly at the pudgy feline.

"Is that him?"
"YAY! KITTY!"

Yoji watched as the girl ran out of his office, and moments later she picked up the cat, disturbing him from his banquet. She turned to look into the window, and waved one hand goodbye as she shouted a farewell, to the cat's detriment.

"THANK YOU MISTER PRIEST FOR FINDING MY KITTY!"

Yoji waved a hand goodbye in turn, and watched as she dashed away. She barely even looked both ways before crossing the street, and Yoji just shook his head.

As he turned to his desk, the 'detective' noticed his payment, left there while he was preoccupied with the book. The girl had left him... two twigs and a pebble.

*"Eh. Good enough."*
