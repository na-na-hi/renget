Alexander Lionheardt, a young man working as a helper in the local Asylum. Truth to be told, he is a little more than a "helper" in the Asylum, being a Dead Man working for the Asylum to help it deal with the supernatural and some "nasty" people around.

As a child he was normal by the standards of Dunwich. Grew in a loving family, with many childhood friends and without any worry in his life. For much of his early life he was hooked on the old weapons of his Grandpa. Many old style rifles, including some very old winchesters.

Despite his parent’s distaste towards it, his grandpa trained him on how to shoot with the old guns, much to the young Alexander’s happiness.

He lived a happy life. Of all his friends, the one closest to him was Mary, a girl around his age, daughter of his mother’s friend. Their homes just a few streets apart from each other, made them close enough to play together lots in his childhood.

This constant continued in their lives, until they had reached middle school. Upon coming back from school, a construction truck had a security failure as its cargo jumped out of it. Many steel rods fell out of the truck upon the people passing by. Mary had been hit like a voodoo doll, being impaled by the metal rods as the other people in the street were pierced too.

Himself “safe” just by a couple of inches, as if Death had deemed that he had to survive and see the carnage unfold. His best friend lying dead like a broken doll, without ever realizing what happened to her.
It hadn’t taken him seconds, nor minutes, even less hours to understand what happened. Just coming with reality weeks after the incident, broken and traumatized by the visage of death he had seen. Many fell by his side, many more beside him, but he survived. He survived. He survived. He survived. He survived. He survived. He survived. HESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVeDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDhESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHEsURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVEDHESURVIVED.

He was inconsolable, not even his parents or grandpa could bring him back out of his own survivor’s guilt. In a last attempt, his Grandpa tried to bring him to the home of God, maybe the touch of the Almighty could help his grandkid. Despite not working at first, it started to take effect on the boy, as he took going to Church as a way to bring him solace. Forget about his guilt, having the heaviness on his shoulder lifted by the warm hands of Christ.

Despite the help of God, the church goers and his family, he couldn’t bring himself to forget it. No, he couldn’t. He couldn’t forget what happened, as the face of his best friend was there, always there, staring him in the eyes with a smile. A divine, angelical appearance but WRONG. She was dead, he knew it, even if he didn’t want to stare at the fact, he knew it deep down. She was dead. Yet an apparison always stood there, staring him in the eye, with a frightening smile.

It was around that time stranger things started to happen. His friends started to grow distant, as if something nebulous lingered around them, driving them away. A feeling of fear around him, something supernatural driving them away, like a haunting. His mind didn’t need to know more about what was driving them away.
THAT THING wearing his best friend's face was the cause. THAT THING was the root of his friends growing distant.

He tried to gloat the thing to go away, annoying it, saying hurtful things until it went away. After weeks of pestering the creature, it vanished. He knew it wouldn’t be for long, feeling as if a red ribbon connected them both. Taking his grandpa's rifles he waited for it. He waited for it. He would kill it. No longer would this haunting stay with him. No longer would he be tied by this beast.

He went to one of the many abandoned subway’s entrance. He knew the creature would beeline its way to him. He was ready. With magazines full of bullets, he would rain fire upon the creature. When he saw it, it knew it was time.

In a few seconds, he depleted all the ammunition inside of the rifle over the creature. It was hit by all bullets in surprise and shock, before noticing him as the cause of its pain. He saw it bleed red. It bled like a person, but was no human being!

With disgust, he reloaded and started to shoot again. This time, the creature wouldn’t take it all dumbfounded. With inhuman speed it advanced on him, despite not being able to avoid all of the bullets, it avoided taking substantial amounts of them on its face.

With alarming speed, it closed the distance between them, to the changrim of Alexander, coming face to face with him. It was the first time it had spoken to him: “Despite all of this, I still love you”.

An overwhelming spite took him over. As if resonating with his disgust, the bullets of his gun started to change, overtaken by supernatural grudge. He didn’t waste this chance. Punching the gun into the creature’s gut, he pressed the trigger once again.

Point Blank shots were delivered as black bullets pierced through the creature’s skin, making the area become sickly black and slimy. Taking this as a sign that things would change, the creature started to morph itself, growing claws and brutal maw.

Like a ragdoll, the creature threw him against a wall, making it crack. He held onto the gun like his life depended on it. How he survived, he didn’t know, all but a mystery to him at the moment. He couldn’t let this thing live any longer! With all of his force, he aimed for a last time, the magazines with bullets spread and some even broke across the ground. He had just a few bullets to shoot the creature.

He would make it count. He would make it count. He shot as the creature advanced its form becoming more bestial and demonic. This time, he knew he was done for. Just as he had accepted defeat, someone appeared.

Blasting the creature with hellish orange flames, he saw a figure. A tall woman stood between him and the beast. How did she get there? He didn’t know. As his energy started to fade, he saw the face of utter peace, as if used to this type of situation. “She messed you up, kid.”

All he could make out of her form was the uniform of an employee of Arkham Asylum. After this event, he awakened on a bed inside of the Arkham Asylum, with the woman of before waiting for him to wake up, alongside those he thought to be of the staff of the Asylum. They wasted no time, explaining to him what had happened, and the nature of himself, and what he fought. 
That THING using his friend’s face was chained in the basement of the Asylum. He had two options, they could “suppress” his memories of the event and let him live a normal life, or he could join them, to deal with creatures like the one haunting him. Just the thought of something like that haunting someone else filled him with distaste. After weeks of thinking about the topic, he chose to go with them, be one of them.

He was placed under the tutelage of the one who saved him, her name Olga. A “Dead Man” like him. The training under her brutal, despite his inaptitude towards physical combat, she insisted on training him on it with slave-driving methods. Which paid off when he got the “Knight serum” of Arkham. 

Training his power, and his “companion” was harder, but he managed with the help of an Old Priest who works on Arkham. Understanding the nature of “curses”, and that of the “flame”, as one embraced by it. “Those who hold true faith, are chosen by mankind's oldest defender, to protect it once more against the Darkness”.

He still does not know what those words fully entail, but he feels that one day he will understand. With the knowledge of how to apply curses and of rituals of the flame. One stray thought came to his mind, “Why not apply it on ammunition”? Going through chemical books, and Alchemy books hidden in Arkham’s library, he started to home make some of them, as well as buying a Lever Action shotgun from the local antique store of the Old Man.

In the span of six years, he had finished his training, while still under the unit of Olya, he was granted some freedom to go and hunt supernaturally alone with his weapon and his “””companion”””.

Through the years, his family started to grow distant from Dunwich, more so with the death of his Grandpa when he was 16 years old, making them move out of Dunwich. Due to his training, and his unwillingness to let Darkness be, he chose to stay in Dunwich, living with the family of his deceased friend, Mary as they offered themselves to house the boy.

He doesn’t hold it against his family, on the contrary, they made the best decision they could’ve made, moving out of this hellhole of a city. He still has work to do, and probably will never leave the city. It is for a good cause.

>Misc info:

Alexander was a bright and extroverted boy up to the death of his best friend, Mary Graham. After this he was devastated, growing introverted and away from his friends. The apparition did not make it easier on him, making his friends go distant with its supernatural presence.
Although he is stable emotionally nowadays, he still feels lonely due to his lack of contact with most people of his age, and specially normal people, since most of his contact with people are with fellow Arkham’s hunters or Dead Men.

He is a well intentioned young man at heart but rough around the edges and blunt due to his past experiences and lack of a good social life through his teenagehood. He may sound whiny sometimes, but he is willingly to push through hell and high water to protect others and kill evil.

His opinion on Dead Man varies wildly depending on how stable and dangerous they are. This does not hold true towards Arkham’s Hunters, he trusts them with his life, as he expects them to do the same for him. 

However he is always stressed or distressed, in great part due to the apparition. With the Knight Serum physical enhancement, he took that to become a chainsmoker, smoking up to four cigarette packs a day to keep his nerves in check and not dwell too much on his shitty social life, the lack of connection with normal people, or the fact that most of his time is spent hunting monsters, or creating ammo to hunt said monsters.

One of his wishes, although he would never voice it, is to spend time with normal people like a normal person, for once.

>Powers:

##The Apparition (Sariel)
Powers: Imaginary Ghost, Artificial Angel, Chrysalis+, Metamorphosis
(Artificial Angel)The thing who haunts him to this day, took the name Sariel for itself. It has the special ability to create ghastly blue flames on its wake, burning to cinders and the spirit of what crosses its path against its flames. It is very strong, as strong as supernatural creatures. It possesses human-like intelligence. However it avoids taking actions, responsibility or anything that needs sharp thinking, preferring to be “a lamb following a shepherd”.

(Chrysalis+): Contrary to many of its kin, its human-like form is not the only form it can possess, being akin to a “non-combat stance”. It assumes its combat form when threatened or when ordered to, growing claws and becoming more animalistic, being suited to rip apart someone.

(Metamorphosis): ITs greatest power is to assume a complete daemonic form, capable of fight and frightening control over its blue flames, having greater strength as well as able to “cut” through space, to make short jumps towards its target or ranged attacks to tear them apart.

A creature drawn towards him. It holds unconditional love towards him, but is not above retaliating against him. Originally it lacked both flames and transformation abilities but developed them through the course of the years. There is no bridge it isn’t unwilling to burn for the sake of its love. Him can run but will never escape her, never again.

##Alexander:
Powers: Embraced by the Flames, Propaganda, Modern Phantom, Enraged, Catharsis, Schadenfreude, Salem, Basque.
Skills: Martial Arts++, Savvy, Parkour, Firearm Training
A young man who had his life almost ruined because of a tragic event and truly ruined because of a supernatural being.

(Embraced by the Flames): He has a strong faith. God helped him in his darkness time, so he wants to help in purging the darkness and keeping the flame of faith alive inside the hearts of the faithful.
Although he knows of exorcisms, he is very good at talisman making, maybe because of his affinity towards curses. He uses his talents to make ammunition against the supernatural, as well as talismans to protect people from them when he cannot shoot it.

(Savvy): More of a self learned skill, he has some knowledge about electronics and metallurgy, but barely. His great focus is at chemistry, making gunpowder and other substances to use on his ammunition, using his knowledge of metallurgy to make casings for bullets, or other usages. Overall he is a lot better at chemistry and making chemicals rather than making electronics or weapons.

(Martial Arts++) Brutal training to make him apt as a hunter. With the Serum, his fighting capacity went through the roof. Although he knows hand to hand combat due to his training, he prefers to mix it with his favorite firearm, having a “gun kata” fighting style. 

(Propaganda) He knows that the world is not as it seems so he takes it with a grain of salt. Due to the protection and backing of Arkham Asylum, his personal information and what he does are protected under seven keys. 

(Fright of the Known) His mind is very sharp, and this is needed for solo agents. The sole reason why is he is allowed to go off alone in his huntings. His mind is very sharp, able to detect and see details that would pass through the sight of normal people, his own determination being commendable, as well as reckless.

(Modern Phantom) More of a skill developed through training and his own guile. By standing still and hitting at the right moment, he can hit something supernatural first, giving the first blow and taking it by surprise. He isn’t as skilled in stealth as he is into ambushes.

(Salem) Although he should have a more “bloodier” supernatural ability, his natural affinity towards curses weighted more towards his own powers. He finds using curses distasteful most of the time, using it at most to make cursed bullets to help in his fight against the supernatural.

(Basque) He developed a great affinity towards curses, making rituals being engraved in special bullets he names “Soul hunters”, auto-aimed bullets capable of spreading a withering curse through its target. His other favorite uses are making “weakening” bullets, as well as stuffed toys he uses as drones for scouting and recon.

He holds a great enmity towards the Apparition, seeing it as nothing but a needed eyesore he cannot get rid off. At best he sees it as a weapon, at worse, as an abomination he cannot kill.
