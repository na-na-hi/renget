A Priestess Martyr.

~*~

Garbage bags crunched like leafs in the autumn, filled with cans of Red bull, of empty instant ramen. Are those cigarette ashes? Ina doesn't smoke. Either way, you cleaned. Her livelihood depended on it. For a grown woman, your girlfriend needed to be cared for like a little girl. Someone knocks on the front door to the apartment. A familiar rhythm, a familiar presence. Only then do you notice how quiet the place was, apart from a shower echoed through the halls, which accompanied your steps as you approached the door. After you unlock it, the shower stops. 

"W-Waaait!" Ina yells from the bathroom. "A-Anon, can you... Can you fetch me a towel?"

"There's someone at the-"

"*Please...?*"

Her insistence coerced you into obeying, you hadn't the heart to say no to that soft voice, to those tender tones. No clean towels on your bedroom, you'll have to fetch one from the drier. While you were busy there, a more impatient knock on the door resounded, urging you be quick. Then, a door opens. Not the front one. The creak sends a shiver down your spine, and you look behind you without turning your head. Through the corner of your eye, you catch a glimpse of a petite body, well defined by the contour of a towel, and a purple river that flows down from atop of it. It's Ina, and she's already covered up. The front door opens, and frozen in time you listen. Dry greetings, energetic like a snail, but endearing like that dork is. 

"... hey." She murmured.

"Heeey." The guy spoke. "Bit risque..."

"Haha..." She chuckled. In your jittery fingers you clutch the tower, down your throat you swallow a bitter feeling of guilt, of shame, of...

"Ahhh..." A soft voice moans, and soon after, a wet pop echoes through the apartment, bristling the hairs on your body. Short, wet pecks, Ina's little mewls of pleasure escaping from from her mouth, escaping from his. 

"A-Ah...!" She meeps. A piece of cloth rustles. "W-Wait, wait!"

And then, mumbling. Steps of two people. One loud by the sole of a pair of shoes, one soft by naked skin.

As if caught red handed, you take out the towel and take a deep breath. The loud steps pass by you, and the soft ones come to a sudden halt.

"A-Anon..." Ina looks at you, her body still covered by her towel. "C-Can you do something for me...?"

Another 12 pack of Red bull. That's what she asked for, although she could've sent you to buy a single piece of candy, a new car, an elephant. 

What she really asked of you, was to leave.

Either to get into it or just to get under your skin, that damned woman knew how to pull your strings. Over and over you took deep breath after deep breath, trying to ground yourself back into reality.

Here's the energy drinks. Displays of Monster, of Bang... Red bulls must be on the other aisle. 

You had *stood* outside her room after she sent you off. There, in the washroom, after you agreed to her request, she gave you a sweet kiss on your cheek, and without a word, off she went. Her door opened, and then closed, and there you were, looking like a castaway watching its ship sail away. Unable to control yourself, you had stood outside her bedroom. A few laughs, one of them very nasal. A piece of cloth rustles, something falls to the floor. Ina's towel. The guy whistles, and tells Ina to come closer. There you are, standing outside their door like a watchdog, waiting for more of those incriminating sounds, waiting for them to take that disgustingly pleasurable rush further, and they weren't ones to disappoint. 

A slap echoes from inside, loud enough for you to hear it, hard enough to prompt a moan from Ina. Gritting your teeth, sucking air through them, you imagine it, you can almost see it. Ina's naked body, in the hands of another, cradled in the arms of him, you can almost see them kiss, you can almost see him running his hands through her body until another loud slap breaks you out of your dream. Accompanying the symphony, the muffled grunts of pleasure of a feminine voice. She sounded like... like her tongue was out, like it was inside his mouth...

The Red bulls. From the walk towards the front door, towards the street, towards the supermarket. The urge to know what was going on behind that door ran like a cluster of spiders, a tingling that echoed with its incessant mockery through your veins. A testament to their effect, a tent in your pants, protruding in obnoxious reminding of your shortcomings. 

You wanted to take your time, to give Ina some time herself to enjoy the moment, but lust demanded its due, and with the box of energy drinks thrown inside a bag, you walked back home, aching for the privacy to touch yourself, to intrude like a spy on Ina's privacy. 

Finally, back home, you opened the door quietly, trying to not disturb the two with your presence. The drinks should've gone on the fridge, but you left them on top of the counter. A different thirst called to your attention- No, it demanded it. It *forced* you to attend it.  Again, you stood outside her door, sticking your ear to it, swallowing your saliva. No, you can't hear it...

Desperate, you rushed for an empty glass just as a muffled shriek escaped from the confines on the bedroom, almost causing you to drop your tool of eavesdropping. 

One of your hands holding the glass, the other holding your heart, you stuck it to the door, then your ear, and your mouth let out a moan as you heard it.

The bed bumping the wall, adorned with rhythmic grunts that must've been muffled into the pillow.  You couldn't help it. Hopeless, you undid your pants, letting out your cock and balls, and with your fingers circling around it, you stroked it while your ear fed you more tiny morsels of fuel.  A loud slap, a begging Ina. The image begins playing in your head. Her fat, milky white ass, with a red imprint from her *owner* marked in all its glory. Ina offering herself on all fours, asking for another, swaying her hips from side to side. 

"You like that?" The man asks, you swallow.

"Mhm..." An affirmative groan replies. 

"You love it?"

"I do- Ah~!"

And the bed bumps the wall faster, and faster. He's so rough! Rough enough for you to hear how Ina's buttocks meet his hips, to how his shaft exerts moans and pants from Ina you can only listen to. Slow, labored pants that must've come from him slowly showing himself the way inside, rearranging Ina's insides to his shape. Long quivering moans accompanied by snarky chuckles as he grinded her. Then, something heavy pounces on the bed. A weight plops down, and soon short wet plashes follow. If your mental image was of any fidelity to the act... He must've been prone boning her.

"Good girl...! Oh baby, I'm close."

And so are you.

"Ha, ha... ha-ha-ha-ha..." Ina moans.

"Take it all inside you slut..." He grunts. *Oh god, he's not going to, he's not-.* "Have my fucking bastards...!"

And suddenly, your semen spurts out from your member. You catch it with your hand as you catch your voice, a moan almost giving away your position. You were done, *but he wasn't.*

His thrusts grow primal, intense. Ina's voice shrieks in its full glory in sync to his rhythm. She wasn't muffling her voice anymore, she wasn't keeping it a secret from anyone that this man had made her feel like a woman, and much less, she wasn't hiding it from you whether she knew you knew or not. 

"Here it comes, here it comes!" He grunts.

"Wait, don't pull my hair- AH-! Ahh~!" Ina grunts. The labored pants of her lover echo through the bedroom while her voice shrills and squirms, and that pushes you to shoot just a few more lines of cum without using your hands. Some of it falls onto the floor, some of it flows down your shaft, towards your crotch. Oh, you made a mess of yourself...

"There, there! Not a drop gone to waste, not a single... One!" He grunts as he pumps his last bit of cum inside your girlfriend, Ina still catching her breath, still recovering from her orgasm. 

"Hoo..." He groans. "Come on, clean it, clean it up."

And as if it couldn't get any worse, his words entice you again. Once more you put the glass to the door, and once more you put your ear next to it, only to be met with the enthusiastic but exhausted pants of Ina as she slurps on a cock.

"Base to tip, all of it. The balls too." He demands, and you don't need any confirmation to know that Ina nodded with his head protruding out of her cheek. More and more wet sounds get you going, the sounds of her slurping the saliva she was drooling, the image of her nibbling on his testicles. "Come on... don't be shy..." He chuckles, and after a surprised meep, you hear it. How Ina gargles and chokes on his member. She holds it. And she holds it.

*... And she holds it.*

And after a few seconds, Ina pulls back and takes a deep breath, and you hear for the aftermath. Friendly chit-chat, praises and snarky teasing. And finally...

"Up for another round?" He asks.

No, you can't, you've literally...

Someone falls on top of the bed, and a cheeky laugh coming from Ina's friend set the stage for what was to come. 

The bed begins bumping the wall again, and you're standing there, listening to it as your cum slips from your hand.
