#Welcome to the Lobster Zone!
->Hey everyone! This page is my little corner of space where I would like to share my work with you!<-
->Here are my bots for you to enjoy!<-
->NOTE: My rentry is still in construction, until Vivienne finishes it! It will be updated slowly!<-
***
Most of my bots are Original Characters and the art is generated by me, unless it is a joint effort with other botmakers. Here you can also find alternative pictures for some characters! Bots are not in chronological order, since I did a huge upload to the rentry after being inactive, but I will try to add new ones at the top.

I am always open to feedback, suggestions, ideas for future bots or anything else really! I'm also open to collaboration and making bots together. You can contact me if you want.
My info is below:
