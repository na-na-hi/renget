#### Graphing Functions and Data
>*“The best is the enemy of the good.”* —Voltaire

*"If you are in any empirical field, you need to graph data. If you are in any field that uses math to model phenomena, you need to graph functions. This chapter discusses basic mechanisms for such graphics. As usual, we show the use of the mechanisms and also discuss their design. The key examples are graphing a function of one argument and displaying values read from a file."*
