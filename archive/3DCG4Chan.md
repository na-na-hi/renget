3DCG Rentry Pastebin V1.2 - 2023
#####-> About 3DCG <-
What TDCG is: 3D Custom Girl, a program for creating a character and posing it. Has a light sex sim.
Using MMD (MikuMikuDance) you can create your own animations as well as simply expand creative potential.
Ever since the death of Hongfire forum, most of the western 3DCG community died with it.
Take this pastebin as one of the last remaining bastions.

#####-> Game Modding <-
99% of the time, the password is: custom

Mods go in the "arcs" folder inside the TDCG game folder. Saves go inside /Documents/TechArts3D/TDCG/. Poses go inside /TDCG/pose/.
When installing mods, it's a good idea to only install one or only a few at a time, and then test.
That makes it easier to remove mods that you don't want (or cause crashes) without having to guess which mod out of a hundred you just installed is the culprit.
