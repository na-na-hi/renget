# AI Voice Cloning

This [repo](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning)/[rentry](https://rentry.org/AI-Voice-Cloning/) aims to serve as both a foolproof guide for setting up AI voice cloning tools for legitimate, local use on Windows/Linux, as well as a stepping stone for anons that genuinely want to play around with [TorToiSe](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts).

Similar to my own findings for Stable Diffusion image generation, this rentry may appear a little disheveled as I note my new findings with TorToiSe. Please keep this in mind if the guide seems to shift a bit or sound confusing.

>\>Ugh... why bother when I can just abuse 11.AI?

You're more than welcome to, but TorToiSe is shaping up to be a very promising tool, especially with finetuning now on the horizon.

This is not endorsed by [neonbjb](https://github.com/neonbjb/). I do not expect this to run into any ethical issues, as it seems (like me), this is mostly for making funny haha vidya characters say funny lines.
