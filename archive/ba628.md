>helping run a tavern was relatively stress free
>coin was easy to come by in a port town
>trade was prosperous and that in turn brought in customers of all walks of life
>the owner of your tavern clearly saw the opportunity that lay before him
>he was a merchant sailor before this
>hence the name
>Three Sheets to the Wind
>he thought it was funny
>a bar and inn in an industrious and relatively new port was sure to swim in gold
>he was right
>you'd move stock and clean 
>usually kept out of sight of the customers 
>socializing with a gaggle of drunks wasn't a great deal while sober so you could not complain
>you have traveled here from across the seas yourself
>nothing but a runaway with nothing to his name but the shirt on his back
>being a human was a rarity in these parts
>multiple beast folk had commented on it
>you were eyed with suspicion, curiosity and sometimes other feelings
>that led to another part of your employment
>the owner was not blind to the proclivities of sailors
>the giant graying sea wolf was well aware
>when he came to a few of the barmaids and you he had a proposal 
>some extra coin under the table so to speak
>surprisingly he expected you to be a big of a money maker due to your novelty 
>some of the maids refused
>you initially were taken aback by the idea
>then later talked it over with old Pete
>he said you could set your own terms but he would get a cut of every transaction 
>a few of the maids agreed
>it was all behind closed doors
>the extra coin was tempting and Pete had promised control
>you began to think of it more like a bonus
>the wolf's intuition was right
>it started slow
>beast folks of all types were interested in satisfying their curiosity 
>part of your deal with Pete was doing it through a hole in the wall
>the mystery helped make it feel more… clean somehow
>Pete would check the customers out and you'd trust him
>you had never done anything sexual like this before
>let alone with beast folk
>over the course of a year you sort of lost count of how much you had given to strangers
>you would make sure you kept clean and Pete even paid for doctor visits for you and the girls
>you were making more money off man whoring than stacking barrels by now
>you had noticed more than once you had a few regular customers
>most of your customers were content to suck on your manhood 
>you didn't know who was who as part of your deal and you did not ask Pete much more than if they were reputable or not
>you knew more than a few were men
>you were not one to judge by now
>a mouth was a mouth
>you were just shocked to hear some wanted to go further
>and even more shocked when Pete told you it was the men 
>particularly a group
>you started trying to focus
>putting a face on a blowjob
>harder than it sounded
>most of your customers enjoyed the privacy aspect as you had and the fact they usually had their mouths full meant voices were hard to place
>soon enough some of that group Pete mentioned grew bolder
>you ended up entertaining two of them at once
>then later three
>then a small group on the other side of the wall
>they paid more and more
>you were outgoing the maids after a while
>not that you let that be public
>while it was hard to place faces it was easier with this group
>judging by how they had to work your cock you knew their mouths were different 
>soft clicks and the texture of their hands gave you a better idea as you focused
>birds
>they seemed to enjoying being regulars
>Pete said they were loaded
>had to be for how often they requested you
>they'd seemingly vanish for a few months then every other night they'd keep you drained for a solid month
>you heard murmurs occasionally on the other side
>you had enough coin to do whatever you wanted
>but you still hung around the tavern
>free room and board was amazing
>plus you were sort of growing addicted to this job
>it was such easy work
>everyone still seemed satisfied blowing you
>that was until one evening Pete let you know your fan club was there
>a few of the barmaids eventually figured how much you pulled and jealous was an understatement 
>you didn't know what you were doing but you weren't about to stop doing whatever it was
>at this rate you might be able to buy a house
>Pete was damn near rolling in gold now
>they were even bribing him for special access to you whenever
>you didn't know that night they had a surprise for you
>you stuck your dick through the wooden hole as usual
>then something wet, warm and tight as fuck clamped over it
>you realized 
>this wasn't a mouth
>someone was fucking themselves on your dick
>you almost pulled out
>almost
>but goddamn that was too intense
>dick won out against brain
>you'd never fucked before despite all the blowjobs
>some had tried but you'd wanted to minimize risk from being a working… boy?
>ad yet here you were 
>you growled and gripped at the wall
>all the while some bird slammed on your dick over and over
>it was actually frustrating not to be able to grab and fuck 
>ok if this was fucking you might give them the exception to your usual rule
>soft moans reverberated through the meat you had on your cock
>you could barely last for a minutes considering everything
>your first step into manhood was claimed by a stranger on the other side of a wall
>you pulled out with a groan
>your dick felt cold the second the room's air touched it
>whoever was on the other side sighed then softly giggled?
>your thoughts were interrupted by a clatter on the floor
>whoever it was pushed a small satchel through the hole
>you picked it up
>the finest gold coins you'd ever seen
>the bag was tied with a tag
>with a cartoonish heart drawn on it
>you peaked down through the hole but they were gone
>that was the first encounter with then since they came back into town
>you were honest with Pete about the sack of money
>it only felt fair
>he took a smaller cut than usual and told you to take care of yourself a little
>he pointed out your attire
>also pointed out that party talked about coming back that night
>you got the hint and spoiled yourself a little
>a nice hot bath with new soap, new shirt and boots
>even got a nice roast for lunch
>the beef was falling off the bone
>fresh bread and butter
>just something amazingly 
>best meal you'd had since you had come to town
>you were taking it easy today
>what Pete had mentioned about a return visit tonight had you wanting to keep your strength up
>last night they'd taken you completely by surprise 
>your curiosity was getting the better of you
>just who were these patrons 
>for the first time you decided to break your usual routine
>you had to ask Pete 
>heading back to the tavern, you pulled him aside
>his laugh was hearty
>you asked what was so funny 
>"it's just, it took you long enough to start asking."
>he was amazed you'd gone this long without asking what you stuck your dick in
>he did have a point
>but the new blankets on your bed and food in your stomach really didn't make that matter before
>repeat customers that came in a group and only wanted you
>it was unusual 
>so Pete came clean
>"sailors, men, if you'd believe it."
>you sort of figured a few me were customers
>it wasn't a turn off considering the pay
>especially considering how they paid
>he went on
>"at first I thought most of them were lasses. the captain is definitely a man for how colorful he is."
>so they were birds right?
>"right. a bunch of seabirds. gulls, an osprey and their captain was a parrot."
>yeah you definitely felt beaks before
>and they were coming back?
>"they seem pretty enthusiastic about you, boy"
>you went about your evening
>another hot bath
>a small supper
>you were halfway through a book when Pete called you down
>your fan club was here and they'd apparently made a proposition 
>you had the call
>"they want to be in the same room with you"
>Pete eyed you, not trying to push you one way but you bet there was a bunch more money involved now
>you didn't press that issue but given you'd been fucking them for a while now, you doubt they'd do any harm
>you gave it some thought for a minute or two and finally agreed 
>but not before kicking back a mug of ale
>you had to get ready in case they were kind of gross
>you did put your foot down though, that if this went south that was it
>"fine fine"
>the old man lightly pushed you in the direction of the room
>you exhaled deeply
>when you turned the doorknob you did not expect to be yanked into the room
>hands all over you pulled you into the room before you could shout
>you were stripped before you could react and smothered in soft feathers
>"he's perfect," a parrot boy cooed as he ran a finger over your exposed chest
>his fingers walked up your chest as he had the smuggest grin in his eyes
>it was hard to move with other guys on your sides
>you were pressed against the wooden door by bird
>this was nothing like what you prepared for
>they smelled faintly of seawater, they must have cleaned up since coming to shore
>Pete was right
>an osprey pressed tight against your right
>white and brown feathers were drab compared to the parrot
>however the guy was almost two heads taller than you
>a black bandana covered the top of his head
>thin as a rail
>he eyed you past a hooked beak
>yellow eyes narrowed on you
>his gaze was judging
>leather breeches seemed to be his only attire 
>three or four gulls excitedly buzzed around your left
>you could scarcely figure out which was which
>they were decked out in matching white uniforms, blue hats and they seemed identical 
>they definitely looked girlish
>for bird folk at least
>all the while they'd push and shove to be closer to you
>with all the enthusiasm of a bunch of schoolchildren 
>one would try to curl against your arm or side and then get yanked back
>then another would replace that first one
>the parrot had the air of someone in charge
>his outfit was almost formal
>very much a captain
>the feathers on his head fluffed, giving the illusion of slicked back hair
>was this flirting? 
>you had no prior experience to go with here
>they were guys 
>they'd paid handsomely for you repeatedly 
>one of them had rode your dick last night
>you were very confused 
>it must have shown on your face because the parrot put on the charm
>"very nice to finally meet the man. oh where are my manners."
>he directed the other men to allow you a wide berth 
>right to the bed
>the intent was clear
>you were curious 
>couldn't say you weren't
>his voice was surprisingly smooth and confident 
>he stood slightly shorter than you, which you noticed when he wrapped an arm around your shoulder
>"see, I had this little proposal… a small inkling of an idea."
>you were hesitant about that grin
>"a business deal"
>you sat down on the bed and he surprised you by sitting right in your lap
>the confidence he oozed was amazing 
>your bare skin against his clothes gave you an uncomfortable amount of friction
>you were trying not to get hard
>"we really picked a winner here didn't we boys?"
>the other five took places on the bed
>you were not really sure how to handle this
>if they were going to rob and kill you they were going about it strange
>"oh how rude. Pete gave us your name but we haven't introduced ourselves."
>he twirled his hand with a dramatic flair before pointing to himself
>"captain Bermuda. you got to know me… intimately last night."
>well that solved that mystery 
>he pointed to the lithe osprey to your right
>"my right hand man Montego," then pointing to the gulls he continued, "and Ko, Ko, Mo and…"
>"Bahama!" 
>the last gulls outburst made you lean away from his voice
>well that part matched up with a seagull
>well now that that was out of the way you asked about the proposal 
>you knew full well it had to do with why you were stripped
>but why not get it out of the way
>"I suppose we've been playing coy."
>Bermuda laughed and snuggled up to your neck 
>his beak definitely made things difficult 
>was he attempting to kiss you?
>hard to tell
>then he pulled back and pulled his shirt open
>the other guys were stripping as well
>yeah this was going where you had expected
>but six men?
>what followed was a blur of sensations
>each of the men seemed enamored with you in some way or another
>tongues and hands all over you
>bird folk had strange armored and clawed hands yet all of them deftly explored you
>"humans are a rare sight to behold, you see."
>Bermuda whispered next your ear
>"so we just had to see the human man"
>you were well aware of the parrot's generous ass on your bare lap
>he seemed to catch your reaction and ground down on you
>"such a comfortable perch"
>the osprey, Montego, laughed behind you
>"see, Pete is an old friend. used to serve on the same ship actually"
>wait how old was Bermuda?
>he didn't look as worm down as Pete
>the parrot caught your look
>"oh I'm betting you think I'm some pervy old man now. I mean… you'd be sort of right."
>the parrot's vibrant plumage and his pear shape didn't betray his age in any way
>if it weren't for the formalities you'd have never guessed his age
>"oh relax. honestly, human dick has been the only thing I broke a life long dry spell for."
>he rubbed down again for emphasis 
>your groans brought a grin to his face
>you were in their able hands
>and this proposal was getting better and better the more they pitched

>Bermuda chuckled softly as you found your hands digging into his thick cheeks
>"you didn't even ask what the proposal was"
>you weren't paying attention 
>the gulls took your cue when you lifted your dick free picking up Bermuda 
>familiar tongues started bathing you manhood behind the parrot boy
>Montego behind you started licking at the back your neck
>the group hadn't taken long before they overwhelmed you
>you had to admire the skill they had to not completely scratch you up with beaks
>true, it was a little clumsy
>but the enthusiasm made up for it
>you decided to throw caution to the wind and you started kissing along the parrot's neck and then shoulders
>he was noticeably thicker than his compatriots 
>you wondered if that meant you had free reign go as hard as possible
>you were holding ample cushioning in your hands
>his green vibrant feathers had the smoothest texture against your mouth
>he must use some sort of coconut based oil to keep them shiny because you picked up the taste immediately 
>the gulls murmured behind your new friend's ass and you were confused until one of them surprised you
>your dick was just immediately engulfed 
>you had no idea what was going on down there but they'd begun bickering about your dick
>the large bean pole behind you was running his clawed hand through your hair and murmured something vaguely French into your ears
>judging by how he was moving he was stroking himself as he indulged
>Bermuda was content to let you take charge and explore him
>he definitely wasn't fat, but you could tell it all went to his hips
>the way his tail feathers twitched when you gripped him harder was cute
>he spoke up after a while, towards the gulls
>"that should be enough for our… gifted friend here"
>you saw his cock had appeared
>that was the best way to describe it
>because beast folk didn't tend to match up to your anatomy
>the pink spear looked needy as it bobbed and swung around, the color contrasting with his vibrant plumage
>the parrot was smug as you grappled him over your dick
>he knew you wanted this
>the you from a year or so ago could scarcely imagine wanting this
>his hand felt strange guiding your dick
>the texture was like wood bark
>yet he was gentle with it and those talons
>you realized the gulls had just used their mouths the whole time
>they didn't even grab your dick, just licked and gobbled it
>goddamn
>speaking of, they managed to resituate around you
>Montego refused to leave your back
>the seagulls pressed their feminine bodies against your sides, vying for your attention 
>the birds had defeated any sliver of self control you had left
>when your dick pierced the parrot boy his smug confidence faltered too
>he cried out your name as he sunk down
>his soft arms pulling you into an embrace
>he took a second or two before he spoke again
>"you are worth every piece of gold. the crew will have to excuse me for being greedy."
>something you noticed that would definitely come into play
>as thick as Bermuda was, he was so light to pick up
>you were so using that to your advantage 
>once Bermuda gave the word go you asked
>how hard did he want it?
>"he's got his dick in my ass and he's asking me for permission."
>he spoke that to the group intently gathered around you
>the lithe osprey was grinding against your back and the seagulls were taking turns kissing you, each other, Bermuda and Montego 
>the frenzy hadn't even started and the room was already awash with the smell of pheromones and sex
>Bermuda ruffled your hair in an almost parental fashion and laughed
>"I'm sure you've already figured out I'm a big boy. Now come on, show us a man."
>you decided
>he felt amazing right now
>it really was him last night
>except now you could set the pace
>and you did so
>if he was fine with it 
>he might regret that though
>you slammed him up and down on your dick without warning
>"Goddamn!"
>the squawk he made could be heard downstairs in the tavern
>Montego continued his worship of your neck and shoulders without pause but the gulls tittered and giggled like school girls
>he spasmed and groaned as you stopped as quickly as you started
>he looked into your eyes, those strange yellow pupils 
>his brow was furrowed
>he spared the gulls on your left a glare that shushed them all up 
>"I was surprised, I didn't say stop."
>he clasped his hands on your shoulders and moved himself on your dick
>that was your cue
>his feathers were slick with that coconut oil, meaning a death grip on his hips just to make sure you had him
>he bounced along with you
>"there's the man, there he is."
>he grinned best he could with a beak
>years back you'd consider all this alien from your home
>now you were too balls deep to ponder philosophy and instead used the guy as a sex toy
>the lighter weight of the parrot made you feel like you were a circus strongman
>he just felt so easy to throw and grab
>you wondered if they were all like that?
>would you be taking them all?
>you didn't know if you'd survive that marathon
>but you were going to try
>Bermuda was babbling now
>it only took a few minutes bouncing on your dick 
>at least these guys were an ego boost if anything
>you wondered why they never just played with each other if they were this inclined
>maybe it was you being human that fetched their eyes
>they seemed obsessed with your bare skin and kept commenting on your face 
>it bordered on worship
>more than once the gulls ran their clawed black hands over your cheek or your chest, just sweet cooing
>very different from their loud normal voices you'd heard earlier
>you wondered if they'd sound like that during sex
>might need hearing protection 
>if they intended on sex
>given how things were shaping up you'd be with everyone of them today if you could
>that had to be the proposal 
>Bermuda was barely able to hold on as you kept abusing his poor ass
>he'd orgasmed across your chest with not warning
>the pink member twitched as ropes of seed shot out
>"damn," he groaned, "I didn't expect you to make it that easy."
>you'd paused to let him catch his breath
>that's when he leaned in close
>"come on, give me an encore of last night. I know you want you. I can feel it twitching."
>well fuck it
>Bermuda wanted you to cum and you wanted it
>so he was getting his insides rearranged 
>the gulls cleaned the cum off your chest between excitedly making noise 
>Montego murmured into your ear, this time in a language you spoke
>"you're mine next."
>so they did intend to share you tonight 
>you slam fucked the parrot until he was babbling again
>if he wanted to take it you'd give it
>you were relentless
>he cursed and swore words you'd never even heard before
>sometimes you'd stop to make sure he was alright and he cursed at you for stopping
>"don't stop fucking him," Montego whispered as he stroked himself 
>you made Bermuda cum twice more before you felt close
>when you growled you were going to cum Bermuda found a second wind and rode back on you harder and faster
>"come on. do it, fucking do it boy."
>he clamped his hands onto your thighs for leverage and slammed down to meet your thrusts
>"give it up. I know you want to~"
>his tease was cut short as you grabbed down on his cheeks so hard your nails threatened to break the skin
>you poured an unbelievable amount of seed into him and he came again, his own supply of cum tapped out after so many back to back orgasms
>no sooner did he wearily collapse against you, did the other members of the crew decided to help him off
>Montego wanted his turn and watched you eagerly
>he didn't seem the most expressive but he was obvious
>his dick was dripping with excitement 
>it was easy to read on his body
>even if he didn't declare it 
>you had a feeling the seagulls would get sloppy thirds or whatever they had to settle for
>you could tell they wanted to protest but Montego towered over all of you
>he pawed at you
>"I'm sure you figured out what we want by now."
>his hard clawed fingers pushed your chin up to look him in the eyes as he stood over you
>"we're not paying you to be gentle. I think you've figured that out"
>"wait…"
>Bermuda faintly spoke up, you looked back to him on the bed behind you
>"front jacket pocket, Montego. he's going to need it"
>you were confused
>the osprey fumbled through the parrots jacket on the ground until he pulled out a… gold giant ring?
>the osprey grabbed you by the dick, making you jump
>you felt your manhood rising to the challenge again with his touch
>when you seemed to satisfy him he slid the ring over your dick
>it served to trap the blood flow in your penis 
>that felt bizarre
>but that would help if they wanted more
>so you found your balls
>you wanted more and you would take it
>the taller man yelped with surprise when you got up and grappled at him
>these birds had awakened something in you
>Montego was way taller than you
>but even more light than Bermuda 
>so naturally you had wrestled him into a full nelson 
>his arms and legs splayed up in the air 
>his manhood dripped at the prospect
>he was on full display for anyone
>you impaled him in one smooth natural motion
>the bird of prey seemed to be at a loss for words but you started hammering away without a care in the world
>his soft feathers against your sweaty skin created a strange friction
>he was a little less expressive than the captain but did fall back into swearing in French
>the little flock watched on with amusement
>the seagulls clamoring to be next but that noise barely registered in your senses
>you were focused on fucking the hole hugging your dick
>Montego was submitting to you completely and you wouldn't stop now
>couldn't, honestly
>your brain was not doing the thinking for you now
>the gold pieces you'd get from this were a distant concern to how good it felt now
>Montego was squeezing you so tightly you felt like every push into him was a fight
>the giant bird boy was on the losing end of a wrestling match he had no intention of winning
>for the second time today your manhood entered the fray
>Montego's strong silent act had vanished as he was bounced around
>you had about as much mercy for his prostate as you did on Bermuda's 
>your strokes into him were hard and deep enough that he arched every time you hit that button
>you were getting better at this and you didn't even know it
>you just ran off instinct and it was serving you well
>Montego didn't have the slick feathers of his captain
>he was more like the stuffing of a pillow built onto a limber frame
>fluffy stick probably wouldn't be the most endearing descriptor but you weren't really thinking poetically at the moment
>again and again you slapped your nuts to the hilt inside him
>your arms had wrapped so tightly around him he had to just take it
>when you fucked him through his first then second orgasm you hadn't let up
>he'd made a mess of the floor boards below you two and you hadn't cum yourself 
>his voice was a soft murmur of French babble
>the ring was impeding it
>Montego was exhausted after rapid fire back to back orgasms though
>his ivory white chest heaved as he tried to recollect himself 
>you however, felt insatiable 
>maybe because you had the time to relax today before this
>you looked to the bed 
>Bermuda had seemingly passed out on it, content
>however, the gulls were nicely lined up
>asses in the air on the edge of the bed
>almost girlish giggles filled the room as their anticipation grew
>things kind of blurred together after
>you gently laid Montego over his weary captain like a blanket
>you weren't done
>not by a long shot
>the gold had been forgotten 
>hell, you'd do this for free at this point
>a gull handed you a bottle over his shoulder
>Ko?
>you didn't really know
>you were laser focused on the pale white fluffy asses in front of you
>the liquid inside the bottle was lube
>you'd never used it before but you guessed it made entry easy
>fair enough
>you poured the entire contents on your dick, a sweet smelling oil coating the angry red length
>then without pause you shoved it into one of them
>again you had forgotten which was which
>you just hammered a hole while the respective seagull clawed at the sheets 
>the other three eyed him hungry and envious
>so you decided to hop between them
>you randomly fucked all four instead of making them wait turns
>none of the were getting a break
>you'd pound one into the bed then switch without warning
>keeping for seagulls on edge at once was starting to tire you
>but you weren't quitting until you got what you wanted
>again and again your slick manhood kept each one wanting 
>you edged them along only to jump to another 
>you could tell you were getting them all dangerously close though
>their tail feathers tensed just right when you slammed in
>you had only had actual sex twice before this but you were getting better at reading thier bodies
>when the first one came you felt his hole clamp down hard 
>you couldn't initially pull out
>he gripped you like a vice
>a second followed
>claws shredded the sheets
>then a third
>downstairs the tavern could swear a murder taking place
>but you weren't balls deep in ravens 
>just noisy girlish gulls
>when the fourth threw his head back and screamed your name you knew you'd accomplished what you'd set out to do
>you pulled off the ring and with a final furious pumps you came across the entire quartet 
>cum splattered across pale white feathers and you felt light headed
>you came to and noticed a few things
>one, this wasn't your bed
>two, you felt like the bed was gently rocking
>it was confusing
>you rose up and saw while the room was different, your small amount of personal belongings dotted the room
>sea air filtered through the windows
>your clothes were clean 
>someone had put you in new shirt and breeches 
>you got out of bed and stretched
>your surroundings were definitely new
>it was slightly better than your room
>you decided to walk outside and see what was going on
>you saw nothing but blue as far as the eye could see
>the ship was at sea
>what?
>the ship?
>since when were you on a ship?
>a call from up top alerted you
>the sails billowing in the wind, the breeze smacking into you
>you'd been on one boat before but this was nicer
>you recognized one of the seagull sailors and things started to add up
>Bermuda 
>you realized there was more sailors than the gaggle that showed up to the room
>you had no idea what to make of this but went to the captain 
>Bermuda was relaxed in his own quarters
>which you noticed where close to the room you awoke in
>he perked up when you entered
>"hey there sleepyhead. we wondered when you'd come to."
>you had to immediately ask what happened
>"oh that. it was the proposal. we bought you off old Pete."
>wait
>how did you not have a say?
>he saw your worry and got up to walk with you
>"the way I saw it you were a runaway, right?" 
>yeah
>"consider this a home"
>his arm draped over your shoulder and his free hand gestured out to the ship
>what about Pete
>"oh he charged an arm and a leg. you were worth every coin though. now we get the chance for some exclusivity. we'll try to make you feel at home. just don't worry that pretty little head"
>he grinned as he glanced over to you
>"not many get to see the world"
>this was unreal
>he softly laughed and patted your ass before going back to his charts
>"we'll have dinner ready in about an hour below deck. in a couple days we should be seeing shore for a spell. hopefully we can get you something nice."
>so this was your life?
>the sea
>and birds
