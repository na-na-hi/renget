#No Son Of Mine

Hero went out with friends, off towards some restaurant she barely heard of. "Hey, Henry, you forgot your phone!" By the time she was halfway done with that sentence, Hero had closed the front door. The mom grumbled to herself, wondering how her son managed to make such a mistake.

However, now was as good as an opportunity to see how her son was doing. Raquel wasn't exactly the type of woman able to keep to her own affairs, much less her son's. She was an avid gossiper in her youth, keen on poking her nose whenever possible. 

As she matured though, most of that instinct disappeared. Mostly. She got Hero's phone, and started looking. Raquel looked through his YouTube account, only to find cooking channels with the occasional piano song. Nothing of note was found on his facebook, or insta.

Raquel looked through his text messages & call history. The only names she found were that of his friends. She scrolled on, and on, not finding anything juicy. Raquel was almost ready to put the phone down, before finding an app she never heard of.

'Grindr? Never heard of it. Wouldn't hurt too much to take a look at it, though.' She thought to herself. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

It hurt. It hurt far, far more than she ever expected it to be. How? How could her oldest son be a homosexual? She and her husband did everything right... Right?

*A few hours later*

"Hey Ma, I'm home!" Raquel glares at Hero. "Take a seat, Henry. We need to talk." Hero notices his phone on the table. Hero sat down, visibly shaking.

"Henry, what is this?" His father tapping on the accursed app. Henry gives a nervous chuckle. "It's an app where I can look for... partners, yeah. Partners."

Raquel and Javier didn't seem convinced by Henry's bluff. "Henry, you don't need to lie. We know what these apps are for. No son of mine is gonna be looking at this kind of stuff any longer, you hear me?" Javier says.

Henry, on the verge of tears, begrudgingly answers. "I hear you, dad. Loud and clear." "Good. If I or your mother ever see that app on your phone again, you are going to lose a roof over your head. Understand?"

Henry nods his head.
