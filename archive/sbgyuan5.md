#Hifumi x Hailey: Chapter 4 - Reaching Out
->**(Hifumi, Hailey, Yui)**<-

Hifumi was leaning on the lockers, waiting for Hailey to change her shoes. The new buddy-X system encouraged students to go home in pairs or bigger groups, and since club activities were also temporarily suspended, the two could leave together.

-"Hay… Why?"

-"'Why' what, Babo?"

-"Why did you try to pick a fight back there? I've seen the work you've been putting in trying to get along with the rest of the class. Why ruin it now?"

-"Ugh, not another lecture. If I knew that's what you wanted, I'd have gone with the others."

-"If that's what you truly wanted, you could still call Natsuo to turn around and get you. I can see it's bothering you. I believe you know me well enough now to trust me with it."

-"There is nothing to be 'entrusted'!"

-"Hay…"

Hailey shut her locker loudly and started to head towards the exit. Hifumi slumped his head. She turned around.

-"You coming or what?"

He raised his head, smiled and went to follow.

They walked slowly, holding hands. On their way, he kept probing her about the subject. She tried to deflect, but it didn't work. Even while she tried to play up her anger at the questioning and mixed in some insults into her refusals to answer, she clung tightly to his hand. It seemed that despite her stance, she needed someone to talk to. Finally, she opened up.

-"I know I've fucked up… It's just that… I've been irritable lately… More than usual…"

Hifumi just nodded. His whole attention directed at her confession.

-"The attacks made me think… What if we get targeted next? They melted Majestic's eyes, for God's sake! What the hell could we do if they came after us?! Me, you, my friends, our classmates - we might all be in danger! I knew that pro-heroes take risks, but we aren't ready for that! I never even really planned to fully commit to this path… Like, I expected to go pro, but then just keep it in the background, focus on PR and shit like that. I just wanted to get a bit out of the reach of my family…"

Tears started to well up in her eyes. Hifumi stopped walking and pulled her to the side of the street, where he wrapped her in a deep hug. They stood like that for a moment, with her quietly sobbing, her face buried in his chest to hide her crying. He gently patted her head until she was ready to continue.

-"And even if it's not us who get attacked, but our senpais or someone from 1E, or whoever else from Shiketsu, my family might just come and take me away. So, what's the point in trying to make friends now if any day, me or them might get killed by those Night Parade bastards, or I might just get transferred out? I'd rather not get attached to them now… Getting separated from you would already be hard enough…"

-"Hay, listen to me. It's gonna be fine. What did I tell you when we first talked back there on the roof?"

-"A lot of bullshit."

She let out a small chuckle at her own joke. Her mouth twisted into a faint smile, but her eyes, reddened from crying, still displayed her inner turmoil.

-"It might be bullshit, but I believe it. But what I meant was: 'you're safe with me'. I might not be able to beat those Night Parade bastards yet, but I can get you to safety at least. Look."

He closed his eyes, and they were transported back to school.

-"See, just like that, you'd be over a kilometre away from the danger."

He opened his eyes, and they returned.

-"Sure, I can't promise no one will get hurt. But that's not something anyone can really promise. Yes, heroes are at a higher risk than civilians, but they are also better prepared to handle those threats. We're still not there, but we're working our way up."

He tilted her chin up.

-"And we have each other, our friends and classmates, our teachers. You remember the news. Majestic was alone, and still he managed to drive them away. His eyes were also fixed by now. In those other agencies, people got hurt, but no one died. Them losing to those Villains certainly was a setback, but it wasn't the end. If there's one thing heroes have, it's the strength to get back up."

He gave her a reassuring smile.

-"And if your parents still have a problem with that, then we'll just have to convince them. And if that fails, we elope, or I go to Korea after you. I love you, Hay, and ya know I'm stubborn. You won't get rid of me this easily."

He pulled out a tissue from his pocket and wiped out away her tears.

-"So, I get that you're scared. Hell, I'm a bit worried too, but 'courage is not the absence of fear'. It's what we do about those fears that matters. Instead of trying to run away and cutting yourself off from others, you should bond with them, and work so that you both get stronger. That way, if anything happens, you can face it together."

She nodded and leaned forward for a short kiss.

-"So, Hay, what are you gonna do about Yui?"

-"Dunno. Apologize I guess."

-"And how will you go about that?"

-"I guess I'll buy her some fancy gift, attach a card saying 'sorry' and be done with it?"

-"Do you think that will cut it?"

-"I hope it will."

-"Do you think you there is some other way that'd have a higher chance of working?"

-"If you have some idea, just tell me. What's up with all the questions?"

-"Ah, sorry. I've read somewhere that when talking with girls, I should speak less and listen more.  My point was that: don't you think that part of the reason people can have a problem with you is that you act snobby, and your response to this problem, which is just throwing money at it, would play right into this image?"

-"I guess so. Do you have some alternative plan then?"

-"I think if I came up with it, then people would just discard it as me apologizing for you again. You've gotta think of it yourself. I'll be there to support you, but the idea's gotta be yours."

-"I guess you're right… I do think a gift is in order… But I guess it should be more about the effort I put into it than just the monetary value… Kind of like when you get something for your parents, right?"

-"Sounds good to me. You've got anything particular in mind?"

-"I'm not gonna give her a handmade card or shit like that. And bigger favours would take too much time, so they are out, I need something I can give her before I manage to piss her off again too hard. So, I think I still have to buy her something, just focused more on finding something that'd fit her so it shows I put thought into it, than just getting something fancy. And I should apologise in person rather than just drop in a 'I'm sorry' note."

-"I know a shopping district where you might find something you'll like."

The next morning at school, Hailey was standing in front of the gate, stifling a yawn and holding a small hand-wrapped package. She was there earlier than usual. The other members of the clique already went inside, but she stood there, clearly waiting for someone. It looked like that person finally arrived.

Yui noticed the Korean standing at the gate. Anger flashed across her face as she spat on the sidewalk in frustration. She sped up, trying to get past her as fast as she could.

-"Yui, may we have a word, I'd like to-"

The older girl didn't answer nor stop, she just shoulder checked the younger girl and continued her way inside.

-"Hey, what the hell?!"

-"Sod off, bitch!"

Yui flipped her off as she disappeared inside the school grounds. Hailey was close to blowing up. Some pebbles around her started to float. Just as she was about to send one in the direction of Yui's back, she felt herself wrapped in familiar arms.

-"Sup, Hay, I see the first attempt was unsuccessful."

-"Have you seen what that freak did?! How dare she?!"

-"Hay, babe, you've really hurt her yesterday. It's understandable she's still angry. You just gotta keep at it and break through that shell."

-"I don't 'have to' do anything. If that is how that criminal wants to act, it's her problem. I'm not her probation officer, it's not my job to rehabilitate her."

Hifumi tried to give her a reassuring smile, but it no longer reached his eyes. Hailey felt a pang of guilt. He reacted by hugging her tighter.

-"I know it's not easy for you. And no, you don't really 'have to' do it. But I think it's worth it, and you realize that yourself. I won't force you, but could you please try again?"

-"Fine, for you."

-"No, don't do it for me. Do it for yourself and for her."

She looked up at him and gave a little nod. The bells announcing the start of the homeroom period rang, and they hurried inside.

During the lunch period, while most were rushing towards the cafeteria, Yui headed towards the bathrooms. Hailey, that was still looking for a chance to talk with her, without the rest of the class listening in, paid notice.

She excused herself from the rest of her friends, asking them to go ahead of her. It took her a moment to refuse their offers to go with her, but finally she succeeded, and was free to follow Yui, the small package once again in her hands.

They bumped into each other near the sinks as Yui was about to leave.

-"You again. Get out of my way, Chang."

-"Listen, I-I wanted to apologize for yesterday…"

Yui raised an eyebrow.

-"What, Takeda forcing you to do it? Did he finally come to his senses? Asked you to cut the bitchy attitude, or he'll dump you? Too tired to apologize for you all the time? Good for him, I'd say."

Hailey turned red.

-"What?! No! What would you even know about relationships? I doubt you ever had a boyfriend. Not like anyone would want someone like you!"

Yui got all up in Hailey's face, pushing her back.

-"I don't need others to fawn over me to know what I'm worth. You should try that sometime. Cut the bitch-act and become someone people would want to be with, instead of just trying to buy them. This shit ain't gonna fly with me."

-"I'm not 'buying' them! And I'm not trying to buy you!"

-"Yeah, then what's that?! You thought you can just go give me something, and that will be it? This 'circus freak that NOBODY wants' doesn't need shit from you, except for you to get out of my way, cause I'm hungry."

Yui slapped the package out of Hailey's hands, shoved her to the side, and left the bathroom.

Hailey walked towards the package that landed near the sinks. As she bent over to pick it up, a couple of her tears joined the splatters on the floor. 

She wiped her eyes with her sleeve and went back to the classroom.  Somehow, each new step seemed to be filled with more confidence and conviction than the last.

Hifumi finished his lunch early and was the only person in the classroom when Hailey got there. She angrily slammed the package on her desk, went over to him and wrapped him in a tight hug.

-"I guess it did not go according to the plan…"

-"The audacity of that cunt. Instead of accepting my apology and the gift, she said I'm only doing this because you said you'd break up with me otherwise."

-"Not a chance. Especially since you did try. It ain't cool of her to deny your apology like that, but you did your best."

-"I'm not giving up yet. 'Third time is the charm' and all that. She came out swinging at what she thought would hurt me, but I can take it. She also said others are with me just because I buy them shit. Sure, hearing that hurt, but I know that you'd still be with me even without it. After how long I had to beg you to let me buy you stuff, I think you might actually be relieved if I went bankrupt."

-"I still don't understand what the big deal about clothing brands is, but if it's a gift from you and seeing me in them gives you joy, I'll wear them."

-"'The things we do for love.' I appreciate your sacrifice."

-"So, you are gonna try again?"

-"I'm gonna befriend this bitch whether she likes it or not!"
		
****


The bell announcing the end of the last class for the day rang, and everyone was getting ready to leave, some would probably already be out of class if not for the unusual event that started unfolding before their eyes.

With the package in her hands, Hailey walked between Faith's and Kaylee's seats and approached Yui for the third time today. Seemingly not caring about the people staring at her, she slammed the package on Yui's desk, and spoke in a loud voice.

-"Sagara, listen now. I apologize for yesterday, and I guess for today a bit too."

-"Just cut it out, Chang…"

-"Nope. You're going to let me finish. I apologize for saying that 'nobody wants you'. I lied. I want you around. I want you to be my friend. Maybe it's just Hifumi rubbing off on me, or the lack of sleep that made me think telling you like this is a good idea, but the feeling behind it is genuine."

Yui looked at her suspiciously. Hailey put on a brave face, but her mask started to crack and show her nervousness. Her makeup seemed stronger than usual, probably to hide the bags under her eyes.

-"Fine. Apology accepted. I'm older, so I shouldn't keep grudges like that anyway. I don't need your bribe, though."

-"It's just a gift. Nothing expensive. If you want, you can pay me back by footing the bill when we go out sometimes. Now that this is done with, I'm gonna go home and sleep. See ya, Yui."

And with that said, Hailey stormed out of the class, the clique and Hifumi trailing behind her. Her friends looked dumbfounded at what just happened, while Hifumi was practically beaming with pride.

Yui looked at the package on her desk. The gift was packed with a lot of care, but it used a normal cheap wrapping paper, not anything fancy. It didn't hold up well getting tossed around all day, so Yui just ripped open the packaging to find a book inside: '100 cute and unusual crocheting patterns for your family, friends and pets'. It looked to be second hand, and it was filled to the brim with little post-it notes. 

'I think you'd look good in this.'

'You're close with, Orochi, right? I think this would fit her without making it uncomfortable for her tails.'

'I don't know if your cat is black, but this would probably look cute on him (or is it a she?) if (s)he is. Check the next five pages for things I think would match if (s)he's another pattern.'

Yui lifted a little drawing of a black cat in the hat that was on that page. The book was full of those little notes and drawings. She fought with all her might against the smile that was trying to establish a foothold on her face, but ultimately lost that battle.
