 [TOC2] 
***
- [**Civitai**](https://civitai.com/articles?view=feed&tags=113937) has a section for guides and I won't be linking those.
- [**Note**](https://note.com/search?q=loRA&context=note&mode=search) is a site with a lot of written down notes It is all in Japanese so if you translate something or see something worth running through chatGPT I will link it here. 
- If you want me to add something to this rentry just post this rentry link with it so it shows up in the archive.
