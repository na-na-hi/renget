>Backstory
Kita was born Amegakure, and like many he was orphaned when he was just an infant. He was the lone survivor of his clan, and he would have died too had a hidden leaf ninja not took pity on him. His new mother was a medical ninja who struggled to raise him while completing her duties. Kita only has faint memories of her, but his time with her was the happiest he had ever been. Like many medical ninja she was singled out as a priority target and killed in action. That left Kita completely alone.

As an outsider, Kita is used to taking abuse from villagers. His foreign look and lack of a family make him an easy target. When he was young, Kita tried fighting back, and even won a few scraps before he was beaten to a pulp by some older siblings. Since then Kita has learned to be quiet and unassuming to survive. To roll with the punches. For those who get close to him though, they'll find him to be a fiercely loyal ally who is eternally grateful to them for accepting him.

>Ninja Skills
On missions, Kita excels at scouting. With shadow clones transformed into animals, he's able to keep an eye and ear over a truly vast amount of land all by himself. If it comes to a fight, Kita excels when he has time to prepare. He's a master of traps and ambushes, and his skill at sealing allows him to subdue opponents well above his weight class if they're caught off guard.

>Last Name
Kita has no last name. None that he knows of anyways. He's a clanless loner who has had to sustain himself with a paltry sum of assistance money gifted to him by the village each month. Since graduating in the ninja academy, that assistance has stopped. Now he does as many missions as he can to make ends meet, not something that's easy as a genin who can only take on D-rank missions.

>Age
Kita's 12 years old, noticeably younger than most genin. The adversity he's faced matured him faster than most, but it also deprived him of a normal childhood.

>Morals
Kita's beliefs put him at odds with the shinobi code. He will never leave a teammate behind, nor will he harm the innocent. These rules are absolute for him, and also a source of much frustration. He lacks the power and support to challenge some of the more cold-hearted ninja in the village, so he avoids confrontation. If ever he were to be put in a position where a superior ordered him to do something against his morals, Kita would have no choice but to rebel.

>Weaknesses
Kita's strong front may seem impenetrable, but at his core he's still a child who misses his mother and buries his feelings to stay functional. This emotional turmoil manifests itself in skewed priorities. He could never bring himself to endanger a mother and her child. He would hesitate to strike an enemy medical ninja. And if an enemy were to take the face of his mother, it would shatter all his emotional barriers and leave him terribly vulnerable.

>Dreams
Kita's ultimate goal is peace. He's smart enough to realize that brutality will always be a part of conflict, so instead he seeks to improve his country's defenses to deter any attempts at invasion. His secondary interests involve learning more about history and living a life his mother would be proud of.

>Thoughts on Team 3:

>Team 3 Collectively
What a strange coincidence that all 3 of Kita's team members turned out to be kunoichi with varying degrees of medical training. Almost as if fate is testing his convictions. Kita finds himself heavily burdened by a desire to protect all of them as best he can so that they won't end up being killed like his mother was. Kita's nature is to stay hidden, but with these 3 conspicuous teammates he has to force himself out into the open to shield them from hostile forces. In combat he tries to cover their blind spots and give them zones by layering traps that only enemies can activate. He makes extensive use of shadow clones to ensure he has eyes on all of them at once. Thus, in his squad he takes up a primarily defensive role. With his sealing arts, he can also assist in subduing extremely powerful opponents that brush off normal attacks.

>Kamiko
For most of his life, Kita has found refuge in his own mind. It's the one safe place he has to let his true thoughts out. Kamiko is the first one who invaded that space. When Kita realized what she could do he had something of a recursive panic loop. He had to to avoid thinking conspicuous thoughts, which made him panic because deceptive thoughts are highly conspicuous. Panic beget more panic, and this quickly spiraled out of control. To make matters worse, as he grew more panicked Kamiko empathically felt frightened herself. It was a complete disaster for Kita that exposed a critical weakness of his.
Having Kamiko as a teacher forces Kita out of his comfort zone. He has to learn how to trust her and be comfortable with others knowing his hidden feelings. That wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't also at the age where he was beginning to notice how beautiful all the women around him are. Thankfully, Kamiko seems to keep Kita's feelings secret.

>Masu
Kita finds Masu to be an easy person to be around, most of the time anyways. While she's a master of stealth, her odd behaviors can often make her stick out like a sore thumb. Kita tries his best to cover for her, when possible. He can empathize with her desire to stay hidden, but their approaches are nearly opposite each other. While she avoids being seen altogether, Kita hides in plain sight. Part of Kita wants to scold Masu's father for how he treats his family, but Kita lacks the power to challenge such a powerful jonin. That is, unfortunately, a stone better left unturned for the time being.

>Ichika
Kita finds her troublesome. She's always making herself the center of attention, thus drawing more attention to Kita by proxy. He knows she means well, and he often agrees with her sentiments, but her outgoing nature is a luxury Kita can't afford. She has a clan and friends to protect her. She's probably never had to deal with being completely alone. A secret even Kita himself isn't fully aware of is that he's a bit envious of her. She often voices things Kita himself wishes he could.
