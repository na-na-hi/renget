Story incoming 

Sister Christina grew up in an orphanage, and growing up the paragon of moral righteousness, she expressed interest in taking over the orphanage, which they happily prepared her for.

Being flung into this world infused with sexual deviancy, Christina held onto one singular thought throughout her childhood: This world was wrong, and it was up to her to correct it.

The orphanage was only the beginning. Christina radicalized the orphans, willingly or not, into the basis of her crusade. A holy order set on eliminating all unnecessary lewd, they would begin spreading their message, overrunning settlements who resist.

Those who comply are welcomed. Those who resist either have their genitals warped and repurposed, or are put to the sword and raised as an eternal servant.
