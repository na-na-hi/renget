Comment: “I won't lie, I love me some tomboats like Miyuki. But her hull's ancient, paper-thin even, one burst from a Bonesaw will tear through it. Might explain what I heard from Central, that she's getting a well-deserved overhaul later in the year.
Some of the boys said something about it, I'm paraphrasing here, "I want to install my DNA pattern into her Kai Ni." As for their sentiment, you be the judge of that.
