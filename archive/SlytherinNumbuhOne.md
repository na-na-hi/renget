#Slytherin's No. 1 Cheerleader

"Alright lads, great practice out there today! We'll snatch the win from those flighty little badgers with ease!" The team captain finally released the team from the locker room, most of them filtering out save for one lone boy, a pretty faced, green eyed lad with pink lips and a shy smile. He had  always dreamed of getting on the Slytherin Quidditch team but  much to his chagrin, he wasn't the best on a broom. He had practiced with all he had but he could never master the kinds of turns and movements needed to be a player up there in the sky so he was stuck on the ground....

He had been delegated to help the some of the girls with cheering the team on, not that he hated the idea. He enjoyed cheering for his team but.... 

"Oh, you're already here..." He heard behind him, his teeth clenching a little from the familiar voice. It was one of the Beaters for Slytherin, he was a 7th year, not just that he was the best on the team as well as a pure blood. A lot of the girls seemed to fawn over him from time to time but if they only knew what he REALLY enjoyed, they'd probably look at him differently. Adrian huffed, turning around. He was in some pretty basic boxers and nothing more as he was hoping to get dressed before he showed and postpone this little meeting, alas he was caught in the worst way. He didn't say a word at first, he simply glared, he hated this and he hated the fact every time he saw that fucking sneer on his face or those dark eyes, his heart thudded a bit in his chest and his cock twitched only slightly. 

"Nice to know you already know you'd need to change into your uniform." He said, pulling his wand from his sleeve and with a quick flick, some clothes conjured themselves. It was a standard cheerleaders uniform with the Slytherin chest stitched into the breast, though it was exactly his size but the skirt seemed to look like it would barely pass his...private area. While all of that was humiliating in some way, nothing prepared him for the last thing that popped up, a dark green thong. 

"Wh-What is this? I didn't....I'm NOT going to wear this." Adrian said, his cheeks already starting to flare up pink as he held his eyes on the small fabric article. The Beater chuckled a little, taking a step closer, his hand slapping against one of the lockers and making Adrian jump a little. He leaned in, eyes boring into the blonde's as he hissed in snake tongue, a language only he and Adrian could really understand. 

"Don't be that way, baby girl...I know you like dressing up all pretty for me...~"

Adrian felt his lips part in a gasp, his face becoming even more red, though his brow furrowed a little, hands reaching out to push against the older boys chest, though he didn't have him to push away. "You...You can't DO that....You..."

-

After what seemed like an eternity, Adrian emerged from the other side of the locker room, wearing the uniform as it was meant to be worn, he hugged his right arm, the floor feeling cold under his bare feet. The Beater let out a low whistle as he had been sitting on a bench, waiting for him to come out. 

"Would you look at you, Slytherin's number one cheerleader!" he teased, making Adrian bite his lip a little. 

"T-That's not..." He didn't get a chance to finish before he felt a bit of magic hit him, it was this warmness blowing against his face, hands and feet and when he opened his eyes, his face felt a bit heavier than before. A small mirror conjured before him and he was frozen in shock, he was...wearing makeup! He went up to touch his face and saw the earthy green nail polish on his hands and he lowered them to look at them. 

"Ah, that's better, now you really look the part." He said, looking the younger wizard over, it was clear he was hard as a broomstick, the indentation pretty clear in his pants, Adrian was somehow hyper aware of it. It was...concerning. He was blushing still, unable to move but still looking at his hand before a sound of tapping made him look up. 

"Well come on, give your player some moral support! Come on, be a good girl~" He hissed out in that blasted tongue again and Adrian felt his heart beat in his chest. Ever reluctant, he took a step forward, and then another, the silence only broke by his footfalls against the cool stone floor. Before he knew it he was standing before the 7th year, still unable to look him in the eyes, though something told him the eyes weren't what he was thinking about. 7th year hands slowly rose up, gingerly sliding along the smooth, buttery skin of the younger wizard, where his fingers left Adrian felt like electric sparks were flying from him, knees pulling together as he raised a finger to his mouth to gently bite it hoping it would restrain the sounds he might make. 

"H-Hgnn...Nhh..." He breathed out, hands sliding around his thighs before swiftly rounding to the rear and gripped his plump ass. Apparently all those maneuvers and workouts the girls had taken him to had paid off in more than just stamina and athleticism. He fit into such a girly uniform because he had basically developed the body of a girl...

He huffed and gasped as the Beater kneaded his wobbling ass cheeks, not giving him a moment of respite. Nails dug in a little, making Adrian move forward and even closer to the older student, back arching a little. "S-Stoooaaahh~" he was hit with another sensation, the thong he had been so hastily forced into was being tugged upward between his supple cheeks, going taught against his tender, soft backdoor. He yelped a bit, pushing up on his painted toes and holding onto the 7th year's shoulders for leverage as he moaned out loud now. He was so sensitive down there, once someone got their hands on him, it usually spelled out his doom. Though was it really if, even through gritted teeth and narrowed scowls, he enjoyed every moment?

The older wizard let him go, Adrian was unable to hold himself up, falling downwards to his knees between the 7th year's legs, he was so in his own world that he hadn't noticed in all of that time he had gotten his stiff, throbbing cock out. It was always such a shock for Adrian to see it. He was always in awe of it's size, the thickness of it... How it stood perfectly upright like a monolith. It silhouetted the right side of his face, his mouth instinctively opening a little as the older wizard reached down and gently took his face in his hand. 

"You know what you have to do, don't you, little cheerleader?" He asked, Adrian looked away a bit, one of his magically manicured hands reaching up to grip that cock at the base and give it a gentle squeeze. The Beater sucked his teeth playfully, shaking his head. 

"Tsk tsk tsk...that won't due, you need to say it. Tell me what you're going to do..."

Adrian was panting at this point, a tent pitched in the skirt and thong he was wearing as he could only stammer out his answer. 

"I-I'm...I'm going to make you cum....~"
