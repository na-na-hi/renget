>you wake up
>why do you have such a killer headache?
>you try to open your eyes and look around, and find the whole world dark
>oh god
>you've gone blind!
>no, wait, it's something else
>there's something covering your eyes
>as a matter of fact, you feel it
>a blindfold tied tightly around your head
>as feeling returns to the rest of you, you find more than just your head hurts
>your whole body aches
>and your wrists and ankles burn, tied to the arms and legs of some hardwood chair
>you groan and tug fruitlessly against your bonds
>not a good idea
>only makes things hurt worse
>and it draws attention to you
>"He's awake."
>a woman's voice, cold and clinical
>and footsteps getting closer
>oddly, it sounds like she's not wearing shoes, just an odd clicking sound with each step
>"Very well then..."
>she rattles off your name, home address, date of birth, and social security number
>"...you will answer every question I ask honestly. You have family and friends you care about."
>that doesn't sound good
>gotta think
>who could this be?
>you don't owe any debts, you don't know anything important, your job is nothing special
>did you fuck up your taxes?
"Wait, hang on, what's going on here? I haven't done anything!"
>something heavy and rough strikes you across the face
>was it furry too?
>did she hit you with a shag rug?
>"Let me be clear. You do not speak unless it is to answer my questions. Cooperate, and this will be over with no further pain. Do you understand?"
>you nod your head fervently
"I understand! I understand! Please, I haven't--"
>you start to argue your case, but get the premonition of another blow about to descend
>so you shut up
>"Good. First, have you had any contact with high-ranking federal employees, such as FBI, CIA, NSA, or DOD?"
>you don't even recognize half of those letters
"No! No, I work for a shipping company. We move boxes all day. And--And my friends are all nerds!"
>the voice hums
>"If you're lying, we'll find out."

>you try to steady yourself with a deep breath
"I promise, I'm not lying. I'm not a liar. I just want to go hom--Oof!"
>you're punched in the gut, hard enough to knock the wind out of you
>gasping, you fail to draw breath
>you're doubled over in pain, trying to force your diaphragm to work
>"You are jeopardizing your health, as well as the health of your family. Follow directions or there will be further consequences."
>you take short, squeaky breaths
>right now you can't speak even if you want to
>not that you want to
>the voice waits for you to recover before asking the next question
>"What is the website four-chan dot org? What is trash and what is ADHG?"
>what the fuck
>have you been arrested over your porn habits?
>your old youth pastor was right all along
"T-trash? It's a porn board. For f-furry porn. Anthro. I dunno, some people distinguish."
>another hum
>you hear that clicking start to circle you
>"And the ADHG?"
>oh god
>why didn't you put a drill bit through your hard drive when you had the chance?
"It means uh, anthros dominating humans general. It's about like, femdom porn where the furry women dominate human guys."
>there's a snarl
>holy shit, is there a wild animal in here?
>are they gonna maul you with dogs for your sins against decency?
>your face is grabbed, squeezing hard
>her nails are sharp
>way too sharp and long to be regular human nails
>pinpricks of pain piercing your skin
>"The truth! You've been spreading encoded messages through the imageboard! Revealing our plans! This is your last chance, tell me how you know of the anthrostate!"
>you twitch
>your brain fizzles
"Fuh..."
>that isn't words
>try again
"Uh...the wha...?"
>FUCK
>squeezing hard
>digging into your cheeks
>make it stop!
>you squirm and jerk, trying to escape
>only after you start to cry out in pain does she release you
>"Very well. We'll simply have to liquidate you. Any confession you make now may shorten the time it takes for you to die."

>holy fuck
>they're going to kill you
>not just kill you
>torture you to death
>what the fuck do you do?
>you thrash
"Wait! Wait please! It's not real! It was made up! It's all just porn! I write the stories because I think they're hot and I want to self-insert as the characters in them!"
>the voice hisses
>"Lies! We know what you've written! You're spreading propaganda against the true ruling party! Seeding dissidence against the future and eternal anthro-state. No one would want to live in the worlds you write about."
>wow
>fucking harsh
>wait
>what did she say?
>the anthro-state is real?
>holy shit
"Hang on, the anthrostate is an actual thing? Like the deep state?"
>the clicking circles around you
>but there's no answer
>holy fuck
>those are claws tapping against the floor
>she hit you with a furry fist!
"You're an anthro! They're real! Oh my god!"
>you wish desperately to see through the blindfold
>you gotta know what she is
"You're a canine, right? With the growling? If I guess German Shepherd would that be cliche cause they're police dogs? Doberman?"
>the clicking stops in front of you
"What if you're a chihuahua! Ha! And then I take off the blindfold and you're only like, three feet tall. You have to show me. Please, before you like, pull my fingernails off, I gotta see what you are!"
>there's still no reply
>you fidget in your chair, holding out hope to see
>you feel her paw--
>her actual paw!
>on your head, turn you to look upward
>"You aren't lying, are you? It really was an accident."
>you try to nod
>but fail due to the paw holding you steady
"Wow! Lucky guess huh? Holy shit, the anthrostate is real. When does it take over?"
>your interrogator sighs, and yanks the blindfold off your head
>you blink and stare at the figure silhouetted against the single bare bulb behind her
>too big to be a chihuahua
>she's a wolf, in the classic g-man get-up
>all she's missing is the shades
>"We already took over decades ago. Just behind the scenes for now."

"Oh. Okay. So uh, what now? Do I get to go home?"
>the she-wolf laughs
>"Oh no. Not at all. Legally, you're already dead. Gas explosion."
>shit, that sucks
>at least it wasn't something embarrassing
>the interrogator starts to undo your bindings, but gives you a stern 'sit' when you move to stand
"So are you going to actually kill me? Or like, throw me in a deep dark hole forever?"
>the wolf stands in front of you, hand on her hips, teeth bared in a knowing grin
>"That all depends on you."
"Me?"
>she leans down so she's at eye level with you
>"Yeah. You free for coffee later? I think I'd like to try out some stuff from your stories."
