>"Yagoo-san, is... is he your friend?" A-chan asks Frank, uncertain about the man in the pink lycra suit
>"Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's an investor shut the fuck up," Frank says, typing away at Yagoo's keyboard. He's looking for the nearest portal out of the Hololive realm. It's inside the Saizeriya next door. mamma mia a pizza
>"Fuck," Frank says. "No way we're getting in there; the Saizeriya gods will kill me..."
>"Yagoo-san, someone needs to see you," A-chan says. "It's Mori-san."
>"Wait, no, tell them I'm doing drugs-"
>"Yagoo-san!" Calliope Mori (Internet Singer, 53 Soundcloud followers, Weeb levels: Irradiated) says with a wave of her hands. "Big ups, my dawg."

>"But Yagoo, I gotta pass this album to Universal-"
>"I don't wanna listen to your fuckin' mixtape, okay?" 
>But before he gets to the door, someone else approaches him - it's Hoshimachi Suisei (Has a star fetish), and she's holding up a brand-new CD of her album, SPECTER
>"嘿,夥計,你知道我實際上不喝蘋果汁,而是喝橙汁嗎?"
>「Yagoo, we just released SPECTER! Can you listen to it?」
>"Listen, Chinawoman, I don't got no time for your mixtape either, okay? Get lost already," he says, before shutting the door behind him.
>Overwhelmed but not beaten, Frank walks to the Cover Corp lobby to find a loser wearing shades. It's PolitikZ with Z (Internet Rapper, Soundcloud followers: 45) because you know z's are cool, and, yeah
>"Aw, shit," Frank says, shaking his head. "The fuck you doing here?"

>"bruh bruh..."

>"Yagoo-san, it's As-"
>"Alexa," Frank says, before pointing at PolitikZ. "Turn him into... whatever the fuck; I don't care, really. Just do it."
>A-chan takes PolitikZ away, and Frank finds himself alone, helpless, in the biggest struggle of his chromosome-filled life so far... 
>Out of the pocket of the jacket of the man he killed, Frank pulls out a stalk of brocolli, which he lights up and smokes with relish. 
>In times like this, a man's only refuge is the devil's cabbage... 
>He throws the brocolli to the ground. "Well that did nothing."
>"Yagoo-san!" A-chan yells in a panic as he runs to her. "Help!" 
>"Huh Alexa what the fuck"
>At his office, A-chan opens the door to reveal Politikz (with a Z) standing with two women who are also wearing hip-hop outfits. It's Mori and Suisei
>"Oh shit he's infected them!" Frank shouts, shocked.
>"サ-サ-サウンドクラウド..." Suisei mutters, trembling. "りんご... りんご..."
>「Sui-chan kawaii desu」
>"Oh hey, what's up Yagoo-san," Mori says, waving her hands. "Big ups on the new talent; he's got bars!" 
>"Hey bruh check out my mixtape, mang!" PolitikZ shouts, before showing a bevy of CDs in both hands. "Check out muh mixtape!" 
>"REAL VTUBER HIP-HOP (PolitikZ ft. Calliope Mori & Hoshimachi Suisei / INoNaKa Music)" is about to play
