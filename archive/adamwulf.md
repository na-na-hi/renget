# Sonic The Hedgehog
->[![Sonic CD Logo. It reads "To live a life of power, you must have faith that what you believe is right, even if others tell you you're wrong. The first thing you must do to live a life of power is to find courage. You must be ready to reach beyond the boundaries of Time itself. And to do that, all you need is the will to take that first step...."

Uhm This is kinda messy right now, but if you want to know where an image comes from you can probably click on them for the source! If you can't click on the image, it's either in the image description or linked down below! I couldn't find a definite source for some of these so that's probably why they aren't linked or credited at all, sorry about that u_u you can see where I found them down below though, if you're still interested

The first two blinkies are from [The Sonic Cafe Tumblr blog](https://the-sonic-cafe.tumblr.com/post/184817823442/some-sonic-blinkies-i-made-for-fun). The art at the top is taken from [Comical Highway](http://www5d.biglobe.ne.jp/~aoi-k/map.html). The stamps at the top were taken from [spacehey](https://blog.spacehey.com/entry?id=605981) and [neocities](https://shishka.neocities.org/shishka/new). Bayonetta is also from the [neocities](https://shishka.neocities.org/shishka/new). Amy Rose sprites were taken from [Sonic News Network](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Amy_Rose/Gallery#Sprites), however some were taken from [Sonichedgeblog](https://sonicartresources.tumblr.com/). Skullgirls sprites from [SG_Sprites](https://twitter.com/SG_Sprites).
