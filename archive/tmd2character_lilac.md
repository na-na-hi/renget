### Lilac ♂ ☆
A rather grizzled looking Delibird never seen without his large backpack of goods, Lilac has traveled to most corners of the world in his years as both a courier and explorer. Now he does so as a merchant in what he calls his retirement years. Always glowering and with an Oran Leaf burning in his beak, Lilac's gravely voice carries wisdom and experience best not left unheeded.
Lilac provides travelers with basic goods, but most of his wealth comes from high-value contracts or special requests made by influential nobles seeking particular items. Although, these days he's busy ensuring a certain group of "nitwits" have enough supplies to make it through their next adventure.
