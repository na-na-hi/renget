# /rrat/'s Guide to Hakos Baelz

## Songs, Covers, and Performances

Bae's singing is amazing, and it shows best in her songs and covers. Although she has her original song "PLAY DICE", her covers tend to be slow, power ballads which showcase her singing really well.

## Games

Bae plays off narrative-based games really well, so some of her best gaming streams are where she's engaged with the story.

* [≪Persona 5 ROYAL≫ zoomer education #1 【SPOILERS】](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcyx-7p3bvU&list=PLcPAszg2ItaGQtbZ7tS8A3IAFuVc_0gUe) : She's really into Persona and it's chuuni-ness

* [≪Sucker for Love: First Date≫ dating....sim??? #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOzkUV6ZkrQ)

Aside from that, here are other stand-out gaming streams:

* [≪OUTLAST≫ pls no. ft. heart-rate monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNRciBu6XSM) : She's really weak with horror games, in a really cute way

* [≪Plants VS Zombies≫ lawn mower who? #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwJw9ACnkWs) : She's generally not good at video games, so funnily enough child video games allow her to relax and interact with chat more

## Karaokes

These karaokes show Bae's singing and range pretty well. She also does unarchived and members-only karaokes.

* [≪INUYASHA KARAOKE≫ The Time Has Come.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbiHGbvt0DI&list=PLcPAszg2ItaH7xrkguOK_MW3IU35R6-d0&index=2)

## Zatsudans

Bae also likes zatsudans a lot, and has a near-weekly chatting stream. These are often much more chill than her usual streams. She's also chatted a lot while playing Powerwash Sim and solo Minecraft.

It's hard to recommend a single zatsu stream since they're very frequent and most relevant to the present, but here are some standout ones:

* [≪XMAS COUNTDOWN≫ not-sick Bae waiting for Santa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4txk8rM3Zw) : Pre-Christmas zatsu where she tags all of HoloEN on a tweet and gets "Thanks Bae" trending (Dec. 2022)
