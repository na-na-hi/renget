>at first the thrill of handholding in public was a little too much for them
>the threat of getting caught still looming in the mind of both
>it wasn't until one day, looking over the window of the second floor of a restaurant, that a most powerful thought hits sunny's mind
>it was a sea of people, of faces that he will never interact with or even know their names
>who will even remember a little boy and his soulmate in such a big city?
>Sunny overlaps his hand with Mari's
>Mari scans the room out of fear of getting caught but soon meets with sunny's eyes
>a warm smile and slightly red cheeks shined on his face
>she can help herself and does the same, her worries melting to such a perfect image
>she grabs Sunny's free hand and intertwines her fingers in both of them
>they stare at each other eyes completely mesmerize, completely at peace
>he didn't fear failure and she didn't worry about being perfect
>just for this moment they will have no worries, that will be the problem of they future selfs
>to be honest, the waiter felt pretty bad for having to cough to get the attention of both but it was his job at he needed they orders
>Mari try to play it cool and ordered like nothing for both but her crimson face didn't make her any favors, Sunny was disappointed at the abrupt ending of such a moment
>after the waiter took his leave, however, Mari took Sunny hand yet again, this time with a more playful smile almost begging for a second round
>Sunny was more than happy to oblige

>the city life wasn't really living up to the hype it seems
>8 hours of work, people didn't care about others or were just plain rude, the public transit
>but Mari didn't really care about the grind and with the weekend just about to start, her mind was thinking about what to do with the sunshine of his life
>for all the city's problems it also has some perks, like a really large park to enjoy her free time
>a picnic was in order and what better occasion that they first mouth living there
>she was worried about missing the sunset but she was confident they will be there in time
>if only she knew
>Sunny was becoming quite the chef in the household but Mari cookies still reign supreme
>by the time Mari was home Sunny was almost finished with preparing the picnic basket
>looks like great mind think alike
>after kissing sunny's forehead she was quick with a hug, thanks to him she only needed a quick change of clothes and they will be in their merry way
>*but not peeking*
>Sunny may as well be Sun for how hot his cheeks felt at that moment and Mari's wouldn't want it any other way!
>with Mari out of sight, Sunny calmed himself before remembering his plan
>he knew this day will be important but also that he will have to walk the walk
>kissing in the house was one thing but kissing in public will a tall order to fulfill, but he was determined to do so
>they lived in fear long enough and it was his time to take the dive, just like Mari took the dive by living in the city with him
>however, he was quickly snapped back to reality by Mari's summer dress
>with his train of thought absolutely derail just a simple phase escaped his lips
>*perfect*

>with so much time to spare neither Mari nor Sunny were in a rush to get to the park
>Mari opting to go hugging sunny's arm while resting her head in his
>Sunny felt like he was on top of the world even allowing himself a wide smile

>this, however, didn't last because soon quite a lot of people were enjoying they Friday there
>playing football, eating in a BBQ, enjoying the time in their inferior's blankets and baskets or so sunny thought
>Sunny was resting his head in Mari's leg while she played with his hair
>talking about their day, simply enjoying their freedom was a nice change of pace
>with sunset fast approaching Sunny asked if they can switch places
>an odd request but not without precedent, she assumed it was her time to rest but Sunny had other plans
>the orange glow of the sun helped mask his blush but a teasing smile was beginning to form and Mari knew that smile all too well
>Sunny's heart was going a mile per hour and Mari was blushing quite hard upon realizing how she walked right into his trap
>this was it! Sunny could even feel her breath of how close they were and them finally contact
>it was meant to be short but sweet or that was Sunny's plan anyways
>but Mari's hand in the nape of his head was going to make it a lot more intimated, but he wasn't going to be outshined by her this time
>they missed the sundown but for them, it was they sunrise
>and they basked in the sunshine of both
