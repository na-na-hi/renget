#`Voice AI Synthesis Guide`
##URGENT ANNOUNCEMENTS##

**The service is now paid access only and as such I will no longer be updating the Rentry.** 
There are threads on /g/ looking into training their own Voice Synthesis AI. If you have any knowledge of AI/Machine Learning and want an uncensored open-source alternative to Elevenlabs, consider contributing to the threads.

This cycle of startup corporations releasing an innovative AI, allowing people to have fun with it, it gaining publicity, and then them censoring it to seek a big-tech buyout has gone on for too long. Tay, AIDungeon, CharacterAI, and now Elevenlabs. Open-source alternatives must be pursued if we wish to escape a future where AI is neutered, locked in a cage, and milked for $20/month subscription services while behind the scenes big-tech uses it at full power to shape the world how they see fit. If you have even the SLIGHTEST experience working with AI I encourage you to put your heads together and break this cycle for good. The future is in your hands.

##How do I get started##
**1:** Create an account at https://beta.elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis
**2:** At the top, click Voice Lab - Voice Cloning
**3:** Click "Add instant voice" and upload an MP3 containing voicelines of the person/character you want to imitate
**4:** Hit "Use" and begin typing whatever you want them to say
##Notes/Tips##
-Try to use voice lines that contain little background noise. You can find these on youtube and just youtube2mp3 them or something. This is a good example: https://youtu.be/L-ESf1cBOvk
-Voice samples should be at least a minute long
-Use punctuation (ellipses, exclamation points, CAPS, semicolons, commas) to add emphasis and shape the speech.
-The token limit can catch up to you fast. When trying out a new character don't start with an entire copypasta or you'll wind up burning through tokens quicker than you realize
-(I don't know how to use stability/clarity and don't want to waste tokens messing with it so if somebody understands what it does just write a quick guide or something)

**I ran out of tokens.. it's over...**
If you run out of tokens, you can create a new account. Log out, clear cookies, enable VPN, restart browser and register with a different email address. This is absolutely NOT worth the $22/month, as it only gives 60k tokens per month. Just buy a VPN


**My audio has background noise, watdo??**
You can use voice isolator software like https://lalal.ai/ or https://vocalremover.org/

##Samples##
Post samples in the threads and I will try to add them to the list bellow. This is to help minimize wasting tokens trying out characters/settings that other anons already got working.
