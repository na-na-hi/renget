@admin Just wanted to give you guys a heads up that we need to make an announcement about this duke.exe game as soon as possible. I've already had a couple of people DM me about "this cool game I should play" and initially ignored them cause I thought it was just people trying to shill their fangame. Later in a call I was telling my friend about this and from him persistently bugging me about the damn game I sent the download link over to him and told him to play it himself. He then instead started pestering me to watch him play the game, at this point I just gave in, and Jesus Christ is it something.

The game itself is deceptively shitty. It's a clone of the original sonic.exe game but instead of "sonic.exe" it's a knuckles clone called "duke.exe." I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that, literally everything plays out the same except the sprites have been changed from "sonic with hyper-realistic blood and red and black eyes" to "knuckles with hyper-realistic blood and red and black eyes." Even the knuckles section, the one part you'd think would be different since you're going against this sonic.exe knuckles clone now, goes the exact same way as the original. 

Besides that there's two other noticeable changes that this game has. The first is that all the music has been replaced with smooth jazz. This was the only good thing about this whole experience but even then it's extremely unfitting when you're trying to outrun some eldritch beast that's hoping to skin you alive while music from composer Duke Ellington plays in the background.

The second thing, and this is something that I'm attributing to just the power of pure sonic.exe autism, is that this game is extremely destructive. I wish I was kidding but as soon as my buddy beat this stupid ass game his computer got fried and his entire neighborhood's power went down. The only reason why I know all of this is because he lives only a few minutes away from me so he was able to bike over to my house and tell me why he suddenly left the call.

I do not know how something like a shitty clone of sonic.exe managed to be the equivalent of a weapon of war but frankly at this point my main goal right now is to warn others of this game. I've already reported and banned everybody who told me to check this game out and if you hear of anybody else that's telling people to play this game then you should do the same as well.
