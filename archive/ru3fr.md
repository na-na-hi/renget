Rumors tell of a lone, sword-wielding drifter in a sharp suit with an equally sharp gaze. There are many claims surrounding this man, wild and outlandish ones about how his skills and his sword; his sword-arm able to outspeed many gunslingers and his blade more so unbelievable that it could reach his opponents forty paces away. And even more unthinkable, he is known to be able to slice through foes and obstacles alike; in one such story of a firefight, the drifter swung his blade at an enemy behind a stone wall, where moments later it and his enemy were cut cleanly... or so the story goes. Though these are just rumors, be warned not to face a drifter in a black suit, it is said he wields death's invisible blade.

"These are the rumors about me? Ahh, how embarrassing... It's not my fault, I got swept up in the moment. How else was I supposed to react when those guys get mad at the smallest things? Not like I could run away at that point, so I just wanted to get it over with... And death's invisible blade? It's not even invisible! Anyone can see it glow in daylight! How could anyone that isn't a child believe this?"

>Weapons
(-55) Multi-Gun + Melee Weapon (Katana) + Plasma Gun [+65 CR]
Plasma Sword - An old and experimental variant of the plasma gun. Instead of the backpack plasma generator being hooked up to a gun, the hose is connected to what appears to be a sword's scabbard. Unsurprisingly, a sword comes with the package, and its handle contains advanced technology which allows the blade, also made from a special alloy, to be charged with plasma when sheathed. When unsheathed, the wielder can activate the blade to coat a layer of plasma over it. The plasma blade can be extended depending on how much charge is left in the sword, which is just above half of a normal plasma gun at 30 yards (~27 meters) at maximum charge. The sword can 'reload' by being sheathed again and it doesn't take long for it to be fully charged. The sword itself is also serviceable as a melee weapon on its own, able to clash with other metal weapons.

"Apparently my old man found it when he went prospecting in a prewar research facility. I thought it was cool then, so I trained to use it. Really wish I listened to him and got into accounting instead, at least I wouldn't have to deal with so many people pestering me to duel or see me cut a cinder block ten meters away."

>Equipment
(-5) Cool Outfit x2 - Suit x2
(-22) Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition [+10 CR]
(-14) Concealment Mechanism [+7 CR] - The plasma generator has been modified to fit into a plain black gun case, along with the hose, scabbard, and sword. While being a gun case can raise some suspicion, it's still far better than the backpack being out in the open. When engaged in combat, there are straps on one side so that Billy can comfortably carry the case on his back, and the sword and scabbard is ejected through a hole at the bottom, where he can put the scabbard to his waist.

"This costed me a fortune and it still gets me odd looks now and then... not as bad as hauling around that bulky, metal backpack at least."
