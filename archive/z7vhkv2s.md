The scene opens to a bustling newsroom, with large screens displaying various news updates and graphics. The camera focuses on the anchor, a woman with vibrant hair styled in a pattern reminiscent of peacock feathers. She sits behind a sleek desk, composed and professional.

"Good evening, heroes and citizens alike. I'm your host, Isabelle Hayes, bringing you the latest updates from the world of heroes and villains."

She gestures to the screen behind her, which displays images of destruction and chaos. 

"Our top story tonight: the ongoing manhunt for the notorious villain identified as Sandatsu Owari, a former student of Japan's Shiketsu High's Hero Course."

The news footage changes, showing a chaotic scene unfolding on the streets of a bustling city. The camera pans to reveal Sandatsu, his figure surrounded by a halo of crackling energy as he faces off against a team of determined heroes. They emerge from swirling portals.

"This is the fourht confrontation againts the villain in the past two days. The heroes, drawn from various agencies across the nation, have joined forces in a desperate attempt to bring him down."

The camera focuses on one of the heroes, a towering figure whose presence commands attention. With a thunderous roar, she grows to an immense size, towering over the surrounding buildings like a colossus.

"And we've been informed that we finally have eyes on the scene, ready for a live broadcast of the event.!"

The live broadcast transitions to a reporter, seated inside a helicopter hovering above the scene of the ongoing battle. Through the helicopter's open door, the chaos below is visible, with flashes of colorful quirks lighting up the darkened city streets.

"This is reporter Rachel Marine, reporting live from above the scene of the intense confrontation between Sandatsu Owari and a team of heroic challengers. As you can see behind me, the situation on the ground has escalated rapidly."

There are barely any heroes left. There are no more portals appearing.

The camera captures the moment when one of the heroes from before, the towering figure,l unges at Sandatsu, her massive hands descending towards him. With a sickening crunch, her palms close around Sandatsu, crushing him.

"It appears that Sandatsu Owari has been incapacitated by Jötunn's devastating attack."

Below, the giant hero's face contorts in agony as Sandatsu's relentless struggle against her grip becomes evident. With a fierce determination, he pushes against her palms, his muscles straining against the pressure.

"Oh, it looks like Sandatsu is still fighting back! He's managed to free one hand and is retaliating against the giant hero's assault!"

He summons forth a cascade of scorching embers, engulfing one of the hero's hands in flames. At the same time, dark tendrils extend from his other hand, piercing through the hero's flesh. Jötunn struggles to keep him contained.

Sandatsu's  channels his power, summoning forth a swirling vortex of energy that crackles with intensity. With a mighty roar, he unleashes the devastating force towards the giant hero.

The energy blast tears through the air like a tempest and severs the hand of the giant hero. The force of the impact sends shockwaves rippling through the surrounding area, causing nearby buildings to tremble and quake as debris rains down upon the streets below.

As the energy blast surges forward, cutting through everything in its path, the helicopter carrying the news crew is forced to hastily retreat to a safer distance. Inside the helicopter, the reporter struggles to maintain her composure amidst the chaos, her voice strained as she narrates the unfolding events to the viewers.

Outside, the scene is one of utter chaos as the energy blast rips through the urban landscape, leaving destruction in its wake. 

 "The situation is rapidly escalating out of control. The hero forces are regrouping, and we've been forced to relocate to a safer distance, but we'll continue to bring you live updates as this harrowing confrontation unfolds."

Sandatsu leaps through the air. His dark tendrils writhe and shift, coiling into the shape of large hooks that he drives into the hero's flesh.

Jötunn attempts to pry Sandatsu away, but to no avail. Sandatsu summons forth a swirling portal, similar to the ones the heroes used to arrive, only more jagged in appearance. The portal materializes, large enough to encompass the hero's massive head.

As the anchor realizes the grim reality of what Sandatsu is about to do, a wave of panic sweeps through the broadcast team.

"Cut the feed, now!"

"But why? We need to show the viewers what's happening! This is our job!" The cameraman argues back, insisting that they should continue filming.

With a final, desperate plea, the anchor implores the cameraman to heed her warning, her voice cracking with emotion as she realizes the gravity of the situation. The exit portal appears a few meters away, up in the sky, with half of Jötunn's head coming out from it.

"Please, for the love of all that's good, cut the feed! We can't let this horror be broadcast to the world!"

And finally, with a reluctant nod, the cameraman complies. The feed is cut, plunging the screen into darkness just as the portal was abruptly closing with half of the hero's head still in it.

The broadcast abruptly transitions back to the host in the studio, her expression that of shock, but her professionalism helps her regain her composure after witnessing those harrowing events. Her voice is steady, but there's a hint of tension as she moves on to the next segment.

"Our hearts go out to all those affected by the violence we just witnessed."

She pauses briefly, gathering her thoughts before delving into the next story. She takes a deep breath before continuing.

"In other news, authorities have confirmed that the girl found at the scene, identified as Mio Katsuragi, has been safely escorted back to Japan. Alongside her was Ookami Shizuka, daughter of the prestigious Shizuka clan, both of whom were reportedly kidnapped by the notorious villain Sandatsu Owari."

The host's gestures are measured and deliberate as she delivers the information, her hands moving gracefully as she emphasizes key points.

"Believed to have been in a relationship with the now notorious villain Sandatsu Owari, Mio Katsuragi has been the subject of much speculation since her sudden reappearance. Initially met with skepticism and even hostility from some quarters, Mio's story has taken a dramatic turn in recent days."

As she speaks, footage of Mio and Ookami Shizuka flashes across the screen, capturing the harrowing escape through the chaotic halls of a building under siege. Mio, bloodied, rides atop Ookami's massive wolf form, dodging gunfire.

"Despite facing considerable adversity, Mio Katsuragi's bravery in the face of danger has garnered widespread admiration. Eyewitness accounts and corroborating evidence have shed new light on her ordeal, painting a picture of courage and resilience in the midst of chaos."

As she speaks, the screen flickers to life with images of interviews conducted with alleged victims of Sandatsu's rampage. Their faces are obscured to protect their identities, but their voices ring clear  as they recount their encounters with the villain and the valiant efforts of the young hero student who
helped them.

"Despite the initial backlash and suspicion surrounding Mio Katsuragi's association with Sandatsu Owari, a remarkable shift in public perception has taken place in recent days. What was once seen as complicity has been reframed as resilience, as countless voices rise in support of Mio's courageous defiance against her captor."

"However, not all reactions to these recent events have been met with the same outpouring of support and unity."

The host shifts gears seamlessly, her expression solemn as she transitions to the next segment.

"In the wake of these tragedies and the resurgence of anti-hero sentiments, a darker undercurrent has emerged—a wave of pro-villain movements."

As she speaks, the backdrop behind her shifts, displaying images of protests and demonstrations, their participants bearing signs and banners adorned with slogans advocating for the rights of villains and the condemnation of heroes. Those with keen eyes would be able to notice that the phrase "The World is Yours" is present in a few signs.

"Across the globe, these movements have gained traction, their ideologies seeping into the mainstream consciousness with alarming speed. What was once relegated to the fringes of online discourse has now taken root in the hearts and minds of countless individuals, fueling a resurgence of quirk-related crimes, which have risen as much as 2% worldwide."

Her expression remains stoic, betraying none of the unease that lingers beneath the surface as she addresses the audience.

With a subtle sweep of her hand, Isabelle gestures towards the screen behind her, where images and footage from various online platforms flicker into view. Secluded online communities, once relegated to the fringes of cyberspace, now emerge into the forefront, their ideologies gaining traction and influence with alarming speed.

"These movements, born from disillusionment and discontent, take various forms. Some condemn heroes as ineffectual despite their overabundance, decrying their inability to stem the tide of crime and chaos that plagues society. Others laud villains for their audacity, hailing them as harbingers of change who wield their quirks without fear."

As the camera transitions to the next segment, the studio set transforms into a roundtable discussion featuring several experts in the field of quirks. The host, Isabelle Hayes, takes her place at the center of the table, flanked by esteemed guests whose expertise in the realm of quirk analysis is well known.

The first expert, Dr. Hiroshi Yamamoto, a distinguished quirk researcher known for his groundbreaking studies on quirk genetics, speaks with authority as he begins the discussion.

"It's important to approach this matter with a discerning eye. While it is exceedingly rare, the phenomenon of quirks possessing the capability to mimic multiple abilities is not entirely unprecedented."

Beside him sits Dr. Lukaz Sovorei, a renowned biometric analyst whose expertise lies in the intricate study of quirk manifestations and their physiological effects.

"However, the biometric data obtained from one of Sandatsu Owari's recent attacks suggests a more complex scenario. Our preliminary analysis indicates the presence of distinct quirk signatures within his DNA, hinting at the possibility of multiple quirks coexisting within his genetic makeup."

Dr. Yamamoto frowns slightly, his expression betraying a hint of skepticism as he considers Dr. Sovorei's assertion.

"We must not jump to conclusions just yet. The data you refer to has yet to undergo thorough scrutiny and analysis. We must exercise prudence in our interpretations until all the facts are laid bare."

Before Dr. Soverei can respond, a third expert, Professor Conrad Collins, interjects with a sense of urgency, leaning forward, eyes alight with fervor.

"With all due respect, esteemed colleagues, the implications of such a discovery cannot be overstated. If indeed Sandatsu Owari possesses multiple quirks, it represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of quirk biology. To dismiss such a possibility out of hand would be a disservice to scientific inquiry."

Dr. Yamamoto responds to his assertion with a furrowed brow and a hint of skepticism in his voice.

"While this hypothesis is intriguing, we cannot ignore the anomalies present in the biometric data. It would be premature to draw conclusions without further investigation. The possibility of flawed data cannot be discounted."

Professor Collins, ever the provocateur, speaks again.

"But what if it isn't flawed, Dr. Soverei? What if Sandatsu Owari truly possesses multiple quirks within him? The implications are staggering."

Dr. Yamamoto scoffs at the notion, shaking his head in disbelief. "Preposterous. The very notion goes against everything we know about quirk biology. It's simply inconceivable. And the other anomalies in the data-."

However, Dr. Soverei seizes the opportunity to interject, his  voice steady and confident as she offers his perspective.

"But consider this, Dr. Yamamoto. What if the biometric data is accurate? It would suggest that Sandatsu Owari is not merely a carrier of multiple quirks, but a manifestation of his own quirk itself—a walking anomaly."

Dr. Yamamoto's skepticism reverberates through the studio as he rebuffs Dr. Nakamura's hypothesis with a shake of his head.

"If we're going to entertain such outlandish theories, we might as well throw logic out the window altogether."

"Perhaps that's precisely what we need, Dr. Yamamoto. Sometimes, in order to make breakthroughs, we must be willing to challenge the very foundations of our understanding." said Collins leaning forward, his tone earnest.

Isabelle, sensing the need to simplify the discussion for the viewers at home, interjects with a request for clarification. "Can you break it down for our viewers? Why would it be such a game-changer if Sandatsu Owari were indeed a walking quirk?"

Dr. Yamamoto spoke with a hint of resignation. "While they share many traits with other parts of our bodies like muscles, the connection between quirks and their users is a bit more complicated. When it comes to quirk development, it's not just the user training their quirk—it's also the quirk training the user..."

"Quirk compulsions" speaks Collins, "There are theories that suggest quirks have a form of compulsion, a subconscious urge to influence their users' behavior in order to elicit the use of their quirk. It's a clumsy method, to be sure, and one that's fraught with inherent flaws. You see, quirks and humans can have a hard time matching their development. Sometimes, quirks can grow too strong, overwhelming their users and causing harm. Other times, users may subconsciously limit their quirk's potential, reducing their power and possibly stunting its growth permanently."

Dr. Soverei took it from there.

"In the hypothetical we're discussing, Sandatsu Owari and his quirk are one and the same. He and his quirk exist both as a single entity and two different elements at the same time. Should he achieve a significant enough breakthrough in his own development, it would trigger a cascade effect—a feedback loop where his personal growth influences his quirk, and vice versa."

Isabelle addressed the panelists. "But what exactly could trigger this so-called breakthrough?"

Collins was the one to answer. He leaned forward, his eyes bright with excitement as he continued to elaborate on his theories. His demeanor stood out among the panelists, radiating an infectious enthusiasm that seemed almost out of place given the gravity of the discussion.

"Well, the nature of this breakthrough could be as varied as quirk themselves. It could stem from the rare phenomenon of quirk awakenings, where an individual's quirk evolves to new heights in response to intense stimuli or dire circumstances." He gestured animatedly as he spoke. "Or it could simply be a result of relentless training and perseverance, as with most quirks."

He paused for a second. "Hell, should he really be absorbing quirk factors, then it isn't a matter of 'if' but of 'when' he will have his breakthrough. We are on the cusp of something monumental. We stand on the brink of a paradigm shift, akin to the advent of the paranormal when quirks first appeared."
