##LMFAO GOT BENT OVER BY GLOWIE HANDLERS

Massive loss. was fun while it lasted frens
went too far when i decided to start spouting off about closed convos with journos and my handlers. I enjoyed it a lot, hope you did too.

see you frens, thanks for 50k interactions and some amazingly sweet interactions. This genuinely meant a lot to me.

p.s- enjoy elodine while you can. she's locked so she couldn't be toggled to private and have her defs cleared, but i'm sure some takedown request is inevitable.
