##### `Wolf Cop`
>Imagine she stares at you for several minutes and then sticks her cold, wet nose in your pants

This reminded me of a thing that made me think of a new thing.

I went to a small public school. Think about 50 kids per graduating class. Senior year our French and Spanish teachers managed to wrangle a sweet deal on a 10 day 9 night trip to Europe. The pertinent part of this story is what happened when we all came back through customs (this was back in 1995, I know, I just outted my age). They had the drug sniffing dog going down the line, doing its job. Generally it's just giving folks a sniff or two and moving on. Then it gets to me. At the time I wasn't very cool with dogs to begin with, they made me nervous (that's changed). And this is a Law Enforcement K-9. That damn dog sniffed my ass from my front. Literally buried it's whole head in my crotch to get a good whiff of me. Scared the hell out of me.

Being reminded of that in the wifwolf thread made me think:
"Wifwolf K-9 units"
Holy shit, you wanna talk about effective drug enforcement; they're it.

Of course, that leads to all kinds of pervert scenarios.
>Pulled over by wifwolf cop.
>She smelled the weed three blocks away.
>Offers you a "deal" to avoid charges because you're "cute"
(Not a fan of this one but I know there are folks into that sort of thing)

Personally I'm more into
>Be dedicated house husband
>Wifwolf cop comes home in the morning after a long night shift.
>You've already got a clean towel laid out in the bathroom by the shower for her.
>Kiss her as she comes in.
>She grunts, but still smiles a little. Hugs you tight for a bit.
>Yup, it was a long shift.
>She showers while you finish cooking dinner (at 7am). Steak, eggs, sausage for her. Steak, potatoes, green beans for you.
>She's quiet while you both eat.
>Must have seen some shit last night, but she never wants to talk about it, and you don't pry; just lend your unending love and support.

>Going to bed a few hours after most people have gotten up and started their day.
>Give her a foot massage to relax her.
>She makes some sounds usually reserved for more intimate activities, but you see the stress dropping out of the lines of her body.
>Black out curtains keep the room dark when you turn off the lights and climg into bed with her.
>She spoons you and in a sleepy contented voice says "I love you so damn much."
>Never ever tell her you're a nocturnal creature like her because you can't sleep when she's working for worry of getting _that_ phone call.
>Worth it for her love.
