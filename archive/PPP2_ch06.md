#### Writing a Program
> *“Programming is understanding.”* – Kristen Nygaard

*"Writing a program involves gradually refining your ideas of what you want to do and how you want to express it. In this chapter and the next, we will develop a program from a first vague idea through stages of analysis, design, implementation, testing, redesign, and re-implementation. Our aim is to give you some idea of the kind of thinking that goes on when you develop a piece of code. In the process, we discuss program organization, user-defined types, and input processing."*
