### ->Untitled traditional tale.<-

There was a time, as any other, when the lands that became /morig/ and /kfp/ were at odds. There was a potential war in the making. Their respective goddesses were meeting in an unknown plane to discuss what events lead to this confrontation. In this endless place, with coal at their feet and burning sky in her heads, they were talking with calm but in an increasingly violent tone while playing a chess game, with red pieces adorned with plumage one side, blacked bone pieces on the other. This game became a custom between them every time they met: a friendship –some would say love– between incompatible beings, death and unending life, allowed to be together at the same time by this mere distraction. The discussion of the conflicts were being tamed by the concentration they gave to each other moves on the table, making the conversation transit a tense calm. What would happen at the end of the game? War it seemed. 

Then someone show up from one side, undefined wherever it was in this abstract space. It was the Warden of Time who slowly advanced dragging a body with her left hand. This called the attention of both who rotated their chair to be in front of the visitor. Kronii stopped at a prudent distance and let the unconscious being fall from her grab. It was Amelia Watson, the pagan goddess from the same pantheon. This startled them.

'Don't worry, she isn't death,' affirmed the Warden. 'And if it was, it would be useless, Amelia can't be stopped, all of her repeats slip through the cracks in time they made, like vermin. I just stopped this dangerous one now, whom unknowingly to you is behind this conflict'. Kiara and Mori then stood up, showing distrust.

'Why you disturb such a delicate, and private, moment. I though correct timing was your thing,' provoked the pink haired one.
'And why you bring such a provocative display in front of us,' with intense fire in her eyes said the unkillable.

Kronii then took from the pocket of her skirt a watch, The Watch, of Amelia Watson. She went to the table where the game was happening and throw it in there, making the pieces fly everywhere. At that time both Mori and Kiara took their weapons that were at the side of the chairs and secured the intrude from each side.

Kronii eyed each side, made a little smile that had some nostalgic feelings trapped on it, and continued talking:

'I'm happy that you found yourselves a new medium to stop your instincts of destruction against each other. A board game, cute.' said with her characteristic sarcastic tone.

Both Kiara's and Mori's face mutate in confusion, but at the same time realization: the Warden knew something they forgotten and they couldn't grasp what it was. Then they sat again and between them made the coal from the ground take form of a chair that then burned with the sky flames to become a solid one piece, now available for Kronii to sit.

'Sit down,' the ripper said.
'Make sense of this trespassing,' added the phoenix.

Then the time goddess began to narrate:

'You are both timeless beings, opposite forces in conflict with each other for balance sake. Unending start and infinite end, you were entangled in an useless schism, trying to cancel each other. This was not an intelligence effort, your pure inverse nature were attracted to destroy each other. This was your destiny, it seemed, even if I, or you, can't understand why. Let me show you what that was like.'

She displayed in the air an animated painting of a titanic sized black skeleton fighting a massive bird of fire, which engulfed each other, and eventually the fire destroyed the bones who became dirt, and the fire extinguished after nothing was left to burn; this was just for a moment because both forces recovered their form and began the process once again.'

'This cycle, while balanced, didn't allow anything to exist. Then from the vast nothing I showed up in form of sound: *tick, tock*,' Kronii started making the sound with her mouth. The other goddesses were paralyzed by the realization: it was Watson's clock sound. 'What does this mean,' they said at the same time.

'I was born, my origin as unknown as yours, to break this cycle and bring a new balance. From sound form then I was molded into this circular device that defined periods, with the three light rays dividing it in seasons. I was thrown in between both of you, whose acknowledgment of something more in existence made you develop an understanding of self. Your forms changed too, into the looks you have now, and realized the that both were more than primal enemy forces. I was the pause in the cycle: now instead of a knot of impulses at war there was the possibility of moments where one come over the other, those interludes which allowed the conception of life, with a start and a end, allowing meaningfulness presence to be achieved, for lower beings and for you'.

'I had to take this previous body of mine from this degenerate copy of Amelia Watson to complete this ritual, when you eventually forget you can coexist and I've to come to stop the return to nothing once more'. She takes the clock from the table and then throw it out over the sleeping body of the Amelia, who intermediately disappear at the touch of it.

Then Kronii rewind the mess made to the board to the original state it was before she arrived. 

The white and blue goddess then smiled and said 'Don't let your people make you lose yourselves in the unending knot again, and if you do, I'm here to stop it, I'll not allow to lose the gift of meaningful life, that's my oath.'

Both goddesses in dispute nodded and Mori said 'mind watching us play for old times sake?' Kronii looked at her and winked playfully, making the tension disperse. Then Kiara grabbed Kronii's hand and told her 'thank you for this gift, oh beautiful lady', and they interchanged looks for a moment before going back to the game.

After the entertainment was over a peace threat was made, then sent though magical means to both lands that were waiting for the directive of war. While their people looked like they were mad with the decision their goddesses made, in true the heart in their chests stopped panicking by the though of imminent combat. Peace was retained. 

Then the three godly beings expressed their goodbyes with amicability and went their own way.

Their destinies will entwine again. Once gifted, the cycle of life must be maintained.
