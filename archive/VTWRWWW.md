###Questions

#####*The fuck is this?*
This is *still* a board-wide fanfiction writing contest hosted by /wg/. Though this time it's more of a friendly competition. This is less about ~~being a blatant attempt to fish for new writers~~ bringing in new writers and more about having a contest for fun. Though don't be afraid to join in if you have an idea for a vtuber fic and find time to write it.

#####*What are the rules?*
1. Stories must have a minimum of 500 words. There is a max word count of 25,000 words; that's about what many of the writers in thread think is the limits of a one-shot fanfic. If your outline has potential to go over that, perhaps consider making your fic into a series and submitting the first few chapters for this contest. Don't worry I'll count it as just one 'fic' so you're not shooting yourself in the foot by submitting multiple chapters. Who knows, maybe it can still win for the categories you're entering in.
2. Your story must star a vTuber in some way or form. Fans, cosplayers, roleplayers, etc. do not count as vTubers. As long as they are a vTuber, you can have them do whatever and act however you like. The chuuba also does not have to be the main character in the story (obviously just don't write a fic full of OCs then only mention them in one sentence).
3. The submission period for stories is one month, starting on **11/25** and ending on **12/31 (23:59 UTC-12 time)**. You can submit a story at any time during this period, and all stories that have been submitted will be available to view in this archive. An additional week will be given after the end date for voters to read some stories and decide on their favourites **(01/01 - 01/07)**. The voting period will last five days **(01/08 - 01/12)** and will be completed via Google Forms.
4. This contest will have its winners be based off of categories with one winner for each category. Author provided tags will be what determine if the submitted fic will take part in that category. The categories will be:
 * NSFW
 * SFW
 * Themed (Christmas/ Winter/ The Holidays)
 * Comedy
 * Drama
 * Tragedy
 * Fluff
 * Action
 * Under 5k (Tag if the fic you're submitting is under 5,000 words; **I will be verifying this via word-counter**, )
5. If you've already published your fic anywhere else prior to the contest period, it is not eligible to enter the contest. *Yes this means something like Tower of Tattle would have been allowed but not say a fic you published in ao3 back in 2020.*

#####*How do I submit my story?*
You should see a */VT/ WRITING RUMBLE STORY ANCHOR* at/near the top of the thread, which you can reply to with a link to your story. Make sure to properly tag your stories, especially to indicate if it is SFW or NSFW as this will determine which category you are entering into. Popular websites for hosting fics include **Google Docs with its publish function** and **Rentry**; if you don't care for being anonymous **AO3** is also an option. More details about tagging and hosting stories can be found in our main archive at https://rentry.co/VTCFFCD. Though for this specific contest do keep in mind that tagging in a category means you're opting in for your story to compete there.

#####*Can I submit multiple stories?*
If you have the drive to write more than one, please be our guest.

#####*Is there a central theme?*
For this contest, **Yes, but it's not mandatory.** You can write any fic you want but if you write a story themed around **Christmas/ Winter/ The Holidays**, you can tag that in when you submit to say that you want the fic you're submitting to compete in the themed category.

#####*Who can vote?*
Anyone can, but if you plan on voting for a category winner, try to read at least a few stories in that category before deciding.

#####*Is this chuuba allowed?*
As long as they are a vTuber, yes.

#####*Do I get a prize?*
Bragging rights? You might get your story translated by the Koreans, too.

###Some pointers for new writers
If you need help with getting started on a story or happen to be void of any ideas, read on.

#####*Tips for getting started*
- We recommend reading some published stories or even fics from our main archive to get an idea of formatting and the type of prose you want to write with, as well as some possible inspiration. Take notes of what you like and what you donâ€™t to craft your own style.
- Try reading your sentences and dialogue out loud to see how they roll off the tongue. Keep a thesaurus handy as well to mix up your vocabulary.
- If youâ€™re short on ideas, start by imagining a scene you want to see played out with a chuuba and building your story around it. What's the setting? How do you get your characters to that scene? What happens after it?
- Ask the thread. We can recommend stories that did particular aspects well, or bounce ideas off of each other and generally assist you in crafting a story.
- The best way to improve is to just start writing and receive some feedback. Donâ€™t be afraid to throw your hat in the ring, we all had to start somewhere. Who knows, you might be better than you think, and good enough to take a shot at the title of champion.
- If you need help with getting a beta reader the thread's writers have their emails listed on a link in the main archive. Check it out, if they're on there they're open to getting emailed for helping you with beta reading.


#####*/wg/'s prompt archive*
If you're still short on ideas for your story, you can check out our prompt archive and see if anything catches your eye (keep in mind a lot of it is quite old).
