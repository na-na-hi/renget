#Physical Education
His footsteps thudded on the concrete as he descended the short staircase. Humming to himself, he followed the crowd of his fellow classmates onto the track outlining the football field. Each student wore a matching pair of blue gym shorts, plain white t-shirt, and a pair of running shoes. Well, except for him. He had no intentions of doing any exercise today or the rest of the week for that matter. The others stepped to the starting line of the track as they began to stretch, before class would began.

"No uniform? Someone looking to get written up?" the teacher growled, standing beside the fence, scanning her eyes over the students as they made their way onto the track.

"Sorry, Ms. Holt. Can't run today. Doctor's orders." he shrugged.

"I'll need to see that in written form. Until then, you can start stretching with the others." she scolds, arms crossed over her chest.

"I have a note." he informs her, pulling out a folded piece of paper from his pocket.

The lynx steps forward and snatches it out of his fingers, before he could hand it over himself. She unfurls the crumpled up letter and gives it back after the signature from the doctor was properly scrutinized by her trained eyes.

"You don't look crippled to me. You walked down here, didn't you?"

"Yes, but I'm not supposed to put any unnecessary stress on my ankle." Bryce defends, pulling up his pant leg and partly removing his shoe to show her the medical brace locked around his ankle.

"Fine. Hope you like 45 minutes of sitting and watching the clouds. I better not catch you with a cell phone in your hands either." Ms. Holt warns, turning away from him to step to the rest of the class.

"Yes, ma'am." he grumbled, walking with an odd limp over to the bleachers.

The gym teacher approaches the others, while they stretched, hands on her hips as she looked over the poor form some of the students displayed.

"For the love of God. This is not yoga. Get up off the ground." the lynx shook her head at the Yorkie who was currently tangled up into a ball.

"But, yoga helps relieve tension in the muscles!" the canine pleads, wincing as she unraveled her limbs and pulled herself up from the ground.

"I believe that position is called the 'Downward Facing Dog'." a well toned human joked to his hyena friend who immediately began cackling.

"Lap! Go!" the teacher barked at the two, glowering at the human in particular.

"Tsk. Man, you always laugh too loud." he frowns, breaking into a light jog down the track with the hyena following close behind.

"The position is actually called 'Gandha Bherundasana'. Damn mouth breathers." the Yorkie rolls her eyes, brushing the dirt off of her clothes.

"Language. Lap." she huffs, pointing down the track.

Daphne whines and sulks into a jog.

"That holistic nonsense has no place on an athletic field. Stretch properly or don't come crying to me when your hammies lock up after two laps." Ms. Holt scoffs at the rest of the class.

"Actually, stretching hasn't been proven to help before exercising. Quite the opposite in fact." a rail thin mouse chimes in.

"That so? Why don't you catch up to those guys and tell them about it?" the feline growls at the rodent.

He sighs and turns around, already out of breath as he starts to jog.

"The rest of you. Go! Two laps each!" Ms. Holt yells, blowing the whistle she had dangling from around her neck.

The mixed class of humans and anthros nod and descend down the track, no one wanting to incur the wrath of the fiery instructor. Bryce simply sat on the bleachers, watching the whole spectacle, happy it wasn't him having to run extra laps for a change.

"God, I hate this generation." Ms. Holt muttered under her breath, walking back to stand in front of the bleachers, facing to the side of the benched human.

He chose to stay silent, instead appreciating how nice of a day it was. The sun was shining, the blue sky was unobscured by a single cloud, birds chirped and tweeted from a tree in the woods just beyond the fenced in football field. The bleachers were pleasantly warm, though still obviously too hard for his liking. He felt he'd be needing to take a break soon and stand up for a bit. For now, he watched the class of jocks, preps, and nerds take their laps. It was nice being in a school that had such diversity of species. The thought of being the only human was an intimidating one. Luckily, there were enough that it didn't make them a constant focus in the eyes of the others as they weren't alien enough to be seen as exotic.

The teacher stood as still a statue, arms crossed over her chest, tail slightly curled up, while she vigilantly watched the class. The wavering breeze blew the bangs of the lynx's short white hair across her silver eyes, a bundled up ponytail resting at just above shoulder height, a seemingly permanent mow over her black dappled muzzle, whiskers twitching in irritation whenever she saw a student misbehaving. Bryce had heard horror stories about her from the upperclassmen when he was still a freshman. They warned of the strictest teacher in the school. One that would dole out cruel and unusual punishments for her own amusement. Forcing students to stay after class to run and run and run, until they were doubled over with cramps, violently puking from being overexerted. He even heard rumors about one human that was singled out and abused. After an extra two hours of sprinting up and down the bleachers, he collapsed and passed out. She thought he was faking and taunted him, kicking him in the ribs. Once she realized it was serious, she alerted the school, who then called an ambulance. By the time it got there, it was too late. Apparently, the guy died from either a heart attack or dehydration. Regardless, he thought the story was a complete crock of horseshit. There was no way the school would let a teacher continue if they were responsible for the death of a student. 

By the time he was finally a senior, he was pleasantly disappointed when he first met the teacher. She could be a bit mean, sure, but it was never unjustified. Ms. Holt was strict, but always fair. Do what she says, show respect, take it seriously, and try your hardest. That's all she asked. He figured the ones that started the rumors were poor students that would always blow off the class and were constantly on her bad side. The lynx was stern and always held an air of authority and stringency. There was one story that did end up being true, however. 

She wasn't a fan of males.  

It wasn't that she treated them worse or the girls better, but she had little patience or tolerance for a cocky, chauvinistic ego. Bryce soon uncovered that she was actually a very skilled athlete and excelled in any physical activity. The few times he had been in her office, he had seen a shelf of trophies, cork board filled with ribbons, and a few medals from winning state championships. Soccer, hockey, softball, cross country, rugby, you name it and she had an award for it. 

There was one day that he happened to be eavesdropping on some teachers during an assembly. One of them was a substitute and aide for gym class and was asking about Ms. Holt, after having noticed her bias and attitude towards the males. Turns out, the lynx was set to receive a job offer for an Ivy League college that was in need of an athletics' director. Just when she was ready to ship off and move across the country, the news broke that her position was already filled. By who? Some washed up football player that had been fired from the league. The college couldn't pass up having a former pro player and celebrity to tout around their halls, milking his fame and charging a hefty price for him to speak at lectures around the state.

Receiving that news was utterly soul crushing to her. 

She already had to put up with years of taunting from the jocks throughout school and college. Never being taken seriously, despite her skills, solely because of her gender. To finally receive a proper reward, a career, a living, for her lifelong dedication to sports and to just be replaced cause some middle aged quarterback was canned, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Ms. Holt reluctantly stayed behind in her hometown and was forced to take a job at the same school she attended as a teenager. Seemed she would never leave.

Bryce felt bad for her. She wasn't a bad person by any stretch. All she wanted was to be taken seriously and to receive the job she was qualified for and deserved. Even now, she was still being bullied in a way with all those rumors and fake stories being spread about her. Every class, he did as she instructed and put up with her comments without a single complaint. He pushed himself as hard as he could if it meant pleasing her and keep himself on her good side. He'd even force himself to answer her questions with "Yes, ma'am" or "No, ma'am". Whatever it took. Unsurprisingly, it worked. What was surprising was that she seemed to like him over time. Like is a strong word, but the most accurate. Since she never needed to punish him and he always showed respect, he received the same. While she criticized nearly every student and told them to try harder, Ms. Holt more often than not would compliment him. Sure, the compliment was usually something small, like "good job" or "you're getting better", but it was something he never heard her say to anyone else.

"So. How did you hurt your ankle?" the feline's voice rumbled, her back facing him.

"Hmm? Oh, that. I was helping my mom with the groceries last 
Friday and the bag started to rip. I held the bottom of it and started to run to the front door to drop it off and then I managed to step into a hole my dog dug. Landed on it really hard and twisted it pretty bad. Was really swollen too, but that went down over the weekend." he sighed, slipping off his shoe that now fit too tightly around his injured joint, since he had to wear a brace. 

The lynx shook her head. Her maw opened slightly, lips parting into what he considered to be a smile. One that was hidden and rarely shown. Her top lip would curl ever so slightly, her sharp canine fang exposed.

"Got to be more careful. If you were my kid, those dug holes would have already been filled. I wouldn't tolerate that kind of laziness." she comments, keeping a watch on the students that went by as they completed their first lap.

"I know. I normally do fill them up, but didn't notice this one."

"Sounds you like you notice it now."

"You could say that."

"A little sprain like that never stopped me. Gotta push yourself past it and keep going forward." she states, glaring at the other human as he passed by with the hyena. 

"I could see that in a competition where others are counting on you, but this situation feels a little different." Bryce shrugs, carefully rolling his ankle to test it, quickly wincing as a sharp pain stabs into his joint.

"That just sounds like an excuse to not give 100%. You should be giving it your all no matter what you're doing. Take pride in what you do." Ms. Holt lectures her student.

Her eyes sweep over the field, falling upon the Yorkie from earlier that had now stopped running to pose for a selfie in front of the football goal posts.

"Even if you really hate it." the teacher growls, taking off in a brisk stride, charging after the canine, while blowing her whistle.

Bryce smirks and watches as Daphne hopelessly attempts to defend her actions, all the while the teacher continued to cut her off with sharp blasts of the whistle. Before she let the dog continue her laps, Ms. Holt extended an open hand, to which the Yorkie unwillingly dropped her phone into. She whined so loudly that Bryce could hear her from clear across the field. Shaking her head, the teacher pocketed the cell phone and started to jog around the track, making sure the rest of the students were behaving. Once the instructor's back was turned, the brooding canine presented her middle finger to the lynx, a pitiful attempt at defiance and a cowardly one at that since no one would dare to such a thing to her face.

"Sheesh. She better pray that she doesn't find out about that." Bryce frowned, already able to imagine the deafening screams of anger created by the lynx.

Ms. Holt made her way around the track, giving each student a brief comment of fair criticism as she passed. The benched human stared at the coach as she ran. Her towering, intimidating frame was remarkably seductive to him. Those thick, muscular thighs that tensed up each time her feet touched the ground as she ran, quietly making her rounds inside of her black running shoes. Her long, furry tail bobbing behind her, dangerously close to brushing over the track with every stride she took. It was hard to not appreciate the care she put into her body, especially when it was in motion, sprinting laps around the indifferent students with seemingly no effort whatsoever. 

After one more lap around the track, earning scowls and eye rolls of the students she passed, Ms. Holt made her way back to the bleachers, pausing for a brief rest. Bryce forced himself to tear his eyes away from her, choosing to instead watch his classmates finishing their first lap. The lynx returned to her original position in front of the bleachers and off to the side of the human. A sudden buzz from a cell phone was heard, the pocket of the teacher vibrating from the confiscated phone. She quickly pulled it out and shut it off, respecting the girl's privacy to not bother checking the message.

"Idiots. Is it so hard to not have a screen glued to your face every waking moment?" she mutters to herself, but loud enough for him to hear.

"I hear that. Everyone has one now. I only got one this year, so I guess I avoided all that nonsense growing up." Bryce chimes in, figuring since he couldn't run, he'd try to converse with the teacher that was apparently impossible to connect with according to the other students.

"I see literal children with smartphones that cost hundreds. Am I missing something? I don't get it." she sighs, dropping the student's phone back into her pocket.

"Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I saved up for awhile to buy one for myself. It's a few models old, but it works and was in my price range. Can't complain. No point spending almost a grand for a phone that will be obsolete by the end of the year." the human nods, scooting down the bleacher to get closer to her.

"If you work for something, that only makes you appreciate it more. You're not going to work and save up money to only waste it on something frivolous. When you spend money you earn, you understand all the work it took to get it. If something won't be of use to you longer than the time it took to earn that money, don't buy it." the lynx advises, turning her head slightly to glance over at him.

"Thanks for the advice, but I've learned that the hard way. Buyer's remorse sucks." he sighs, leaning back on the bleacher.

"Just be more careful next time." Ms. Holt smirks.

Bryce was a bit surprised at her response as he was expecting a scolding or another lesson. 

"Will do. Wonder if she'll be able to last the rest of the day without a phone?" he jokes, letting his eyes wander over to the coach.

"Probably in social media withdrawal already." the lynx rolls her eyes, her big, pointy ear flicking at the blowing wind.

"Never bothered with any of that. No need to broadcast every little thing I'm doing. Don't understand the appeal." Bryce continues, appreciating how the black tracksuit superbly clung to the curvy, toned figure of the teacher. 

"You have to be completely self-absorbed and a narcissist to seriously take pictures of yourself every moment you get a chance and in every situation. Always needing to be the center of attention." she quietly hisses.

Ms. Holt then lets out a breath and shuts her eyes, lifting her hand to pinch the bridge of her nose.

"I'm sorry. I shouldn't be insulting anyone, let alone students, behind their back. Forget I said anything." the lynx exhales, stepping away from the bleachers, before Bryce could reply.

He frowns and watches her leave, waiting by the finish line as the students begin to complete their laps. 

"If only you knew what that bitch does behind your back." he shakes his head. 

-----

The school bus coughs up a diesel-laced plume of exhaust as it pulls away from the stop.

"Thought these things were supposed to go electric?" Bryce coughs from the toxic cloud that threatened to consume his lungs, stepping away from the bus as it made its way up the street.

He then hobbles his way a few feet down the road towards a pulled over sedan. 

"Thanks for picking me up." he says as he opens the passenger side door, climbing into the climate controlled interior of the vehicle. 

"No problem. I told you I could just pick you up from school. It's no big deal." the woman smiles, pulling away from the curb once he puts on his seatbelt.

"No offense, but I don't really want my mom picking me up from school." he replies, shifting back in his seat.

"Oh, please. Nothing to be ashamed of."

"No, but not having a car of my own kinda is."

"Well, once you're ankle is all fixed up, you can go back to work. Me and your dad will help you save up and find a suitable car. Nothing fancy, but something that will help you get around." his mother hums, driving up the road towards a cul-de-sac. 

"I can't wait. A bicycle can only do so much." he chuckles, carefully rolling his stiff ankle.

"Good exercise though." she smiles, passing a "No Outlet" road sign as they enter their neighborhood.

Bryce stares out the window as they approach a modest single story house. Red brick, chimney, well trimmed yard, and a white picket fence. The stereotypical American home. 

"Oh! I almost forgot," his mother exclaims, reaching an arm behind her seat, pulling out a small package. "This came for you in the mail today."

His eyes lit up at the sight of the nondescript cardboard box.

"Nice." he smiles, taking the package, feeling his pulse race.

"Well?" the mother asks, pulling into their driveway.

"Hmm?" he hums, clutching the box.

"What did you get?" she asks in a slightly annoyed tone.

"Oh. Some trading cards off eBay. Got them for a really good price, so I should be able to flip them and get a nice profit." he smiles, clicking his seatbelt off.

"What a little entrepreneur I have." she teases, putting the car in park.

Bryce opens his door and carefully steps out, keeping a tight grip on the box.

"Need any help?" his mother worriedly asks, rolling down the window.

"No, I'm fine. Gotta finish shopping?" Bryce looks over at his mother.

"Yeah. Just need to pick up a few more things for dinner." she nods, shifting back into reverse.

"Cool. See you in a bit." he waves as she backs up, turning to limp up to the porch.

His mother waves goodbye and departs back down the street. Bryce steps up to the front door and pushes it open, stepping inside and shutting the door behind him. He kicks off his shoes and walks down the hallway, trying to put a little more weight on his bad ankle to see how it was healing.

"Goddamn, I can't wait until I'm out of this thing." he groans, shuffling across the carpet, until he reaches his bedroom, walking inside and closing the door.

Unlike most guys his age, his bedroom was organized and spotless. He was very meticulous about keeping his room clean. From the hand-me-down stereo to the small desk holding his computer, not a speck of dust was to be found. The carpet was vacuumed daily and his dirty clothes were always dropped in the family hamper.  

A clutter-less room meant a clutter-less mind.   

The human moves to his desk, pulling open one of the drawers to retrieve a pocket knife. He flicks it open with his thumb and sits down on the bed, picking up the package and moving it to his lap. With a careful swipe of the blade, he sliced through the layers of packaging tape and tugged the lid open, setting the knife aside. After removing a strand of plastic, air-filled packaging pillows and tossing them to the floor, what remained was a bundled up roll of bubble wrap. 

No trading cards to be found.

Excited, Bryce takes out the bundle and swats the cardboard box to the ground. He had all he needed now. Forgetting he had a knife in his eager state, he bites down on a corner of the wrap, tearing through the tape holding it together. He spits the tape that stuck to his teeth and unwraps it to finally reveal a transparent storage bag. Inside, was a pair of thin, black, cotton sweat socks.

Now, there was little reason to get excited over a new pair of socks. 

These, however, were far from new.  

Quite the opposite. 

They were rather used. 

HEAVILY used to be more accurate. 

The bag was sealed shut with little air inside, ensuring the smell of the socks would be properly preserved. With a grin plastered on his face, Bryce excitedly grabbed the zipper sealing the bag shut and slid it open. Once he had broken the seal, the aroma of the used socks immediately leaked from the bag, giving him a tease of what awaited him. He shoved his hand into the bag and quickly yanked his prize free, clutching the soft fabric in his hands. Hiding behind the socks in the bag, was a picture someone had printed themselves. 

It depicted a pair of large, fluffy, furry paws. They proudly faced the camera, crossed at the ankles. As with most anthros, they had four toes, rather than the five the human had. Each thick digit held a bright pink pad, surrounded with plush looking white fur that poked around them, topped with a pearly white claw that looked as dangerous as it did arousing. Much like the toes, a bigger and equally pink pawpad rest beneath them, though they were marked with specks of black, what he presumed to be a birthmark. The white furry soles were adorably fluffy with a short plumage of excess fur poking up at the heels, along with the gaps between the toes. 

God, did he fantasize about how electrifying that sumptuous fur would feel around his cock. 

Quite often, actually, as it was the only thing he could think of when he was on his back, furiously masturbating as he huffed whatever he had purchased from the furry mistress. 

Below the picture, was a handwritten message from the goddess herself. 

"Hope you enjoy this pair. I wore them for a week straight, just for you. Give them a sniff to get that cock nice and hard for me, cause I fully expect you to blow a load inside of them. If only they were still warm for you when you slip your cock inside them. A pity."

"God, she's such a tease." he groans to himself after reading the letter, eyes glued on the pair of paws that were a constant focus of his fantasies. 

He slides off of the bed, kneeling down at the foot of it, already rubbing himself through his jeans. Keeping the socks bundled up in his hands, he squeezed and affectionately caressed the fabric, teasing himself by not yet giving in and smothering his nose with them. For the next few minutes, he flicked his eyes between the socks in his hands and the picture of the gorgeous paws that were held inside of them. He wondered what she did for a living, besides selling used socks and other things, of course. Judging by how each pair he purchased smelled, he could tell she was on her feet most of the day. 

Maybe a waitress? 

A yoga instructor?

With paws like those, he wouldn't be surprised. 

This was maybe the fifth pair he had purchased from the woman. As much as he loved the ones he bought, the scent was something that faded over time. He tried keeping them inside the bags they came with, but that only delayed the inevitable. The excitement he would feel when a new package arrived made him feel like a little kid at Christmas again. He couldn't be more thankful that his dirty little late night sessions hunched over his computer, taking in hours worth of fetish porn, had lead him to a cam-room and the profile page of the socked beauty. He had never seen her face, but had seen plenty of those paws. At first, he just anonymously watched the shows in quiet, but that turned into leaving comments, tipping her so she'd directly tease him. She eventually suggested to Bryce that he purchase her used socks to give him a taste of the real thing. He thought it over, until his hormone drunk mind gave in and had a pair shipped. Needless to say, he quickly became hooked.

Knowing he didn't have much time until his mom came home, he felt he had sufficiently teased himself with the dirty socks. Letting out a breath, he slowly lifted the socks towards his nose, gently taking in a breath, able to already smell them the closer they got, until he finally stuffed them around his nose. At first, he just basked in the softness of her socks, before taking in a long, deep breath, moaning immediately at the familiar, though still exotic, sweaty scent of the girl. He held the lungful of her scent, appreciating all the work she put into making them the way they were, eventually letting it all out. After the first lungful, he started to take rapid sniffs of the sweat socks, exhaling through his mouth, sucking up all the spicy aroma the socks had to offer. If only they were fresh. The thought of the hot, damp sock around his nose was an appealing one.

"Fuck." he panted, lowering the socks down with trembling hands.

Bryce then slips his hand into one of the socks, feeling how wasn't a tight fit, giving him an idea of just how big those sexy paws were.  Wearing the sock like a hand puppet, he brought his hand back to his face, covering his mouth and nose, greedily huffing the musky paw stink, while also muffling his outcries of pleasure. Wrestling with his belt, he hurriedly tugged down the front of his pants, yanking down his underwear to let his swollen manhood fall free. Unable to pull his hand away from his face, the human fumbles with the other sock, eagerly sliding it over his bulging cock, letting out another moan as the silky smooth cotton touches his flesh, squeezing the sock around himself with his free hand. 

"I love you so much." he growls, eyes locked on the pair of paws that teased him in the picture, sniffing and even licking over the sock held to his face.

His hips sprang into action, involuntarily thrusting into the sock turned cock sleeve, bundling it around the base of his cock, so that the tip stabbed the toe of the sock as he bucked. The human's fingertips pressed up against his nostrils, forcing some of the sweat stained fabric to block his nose, ensuring it was the only thing he could smell. He was addicted to it. Growing drunk off of what others would be revolted by. He couldn't help it. He didn't care either. 

"I want you." he groans, gasping as he fucked the tunnel of his hand harder, working his uncut cock inside of the sock that began to heat up from the friction, only adding to the pleasure. 

The human huffed, growing dizzy from a lack of fresh air, still muzzling himself with the sock, feeling his cock leaking watery precum into the other. He was already worked up from the day at school, peeking at the paws and feet of the girls that chose to wear sandals today. As he heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel driveway just outside his window, he knew it was no use holding back. 

"Fuck!" he shouts into the sock, taking some of it into his mouth to suck as he allowed himself to climax.

His shaft throbbed around the sock, pumping his cock as it shot ribbons of thick semen into the thin sock, quickly over-saturating it with his teenage cum. By the time he was finished milking himself dry with the used sock, he was holding a wet lump of cotton. The sock wrapped around his cock had the company logo, a silhouette of a pouncing cheetah, stitched into the left side of the fabric. Bryce made a mental note of which sock was which, so he didn't end up sniffing the wrong one. After all, he wasn't a complete freak. He spat out the sock from his mouth and pulled it off his hand, stuffing both of them back into the storage bag, zipping it closed and shoving it under his bed. 

The human zips his pants back up and stands, wincing as he puts pressure on his bad ankle. He nearly jumps out of his skin at a knocking on his door, realizing he forgot to unlock it.

"Hey, honey. Dinner should be ready in half an hour." his mother states from outside the door.

"Sounds good." he answers, holding his breath, hoping she didn't try to open the door.

He waits for her footsteps to descend back down the hallway, before he unlocks his door, letting out a thankful sigh. Bryce then takes a seat at his desk, shaking his computer mouse to wake up the monitor. Opening up a private window in his browser, his fingers type in the memorized address to a familiar website. As he logs into the cam-room, he switches to the profile of the sock seller, clicking to send her a message.

"Got your socks today. You better believe I did exactly what you wanted. Fucked and flooded one. Didn't take long for how good your paws smell. Did you send your shoes yet? Thanks again!" he types.

He clicks to send the message and opens up another tab in the browser to find some music to listen to and enjoy in his post orgasm high. By the time he settled on a song, he was surprised to hear a chime coming from the other tab. Clicking over, he sees that the woman has already sent a reply. With a smile, he checks his inbox.

"Mmmm good boy. Must have been a real mess. I sent the shoes out and they should be there soon. Hope u enjoy. I know u will :)"

"Hell yeah, I will." he says to himself, before typing out the same.

Bryce sends out the reply and waits around for a minute, disappointed that she seemed to already be offline. After receiving no new messages, he closes the browser and resumes the music, while wondering what kind of shoes he'd be receiving from her. For the cost of $60, he hoped they'd be worth it, though he knew they would. If her socks could smell like that, he could only imagine how the shoes would be. Feeling his cock tremble at the idea, the human turned to eye the bag hiding under his bed. 

Hmm, he had some more time before dinner would be ready.

Why not?

With another grin, he pulls himself from the chair to lock his door once again.

------

Rain pelted the metal roof of the gymnasium, hammering the thick, glass panes of the small, rectangular windows. He knew rain was called for today, but didn't expect it to be such a strong storm. He could hear the wind whistling through the corners of the double metal doors, threatening to burst them open with each increasingly strong gust. A light drizzle never kept class inside, but the risk of a student getting struck by lightning was a strong enough concern during these downpours that even Ms. Holt was unable to get the class outside.

Everyone stood around, congregating with their friends, before class started. Though a week had passed since his injury, Bryce's ankle still had yet to heal to his doctor's satisfaction, meaning he'd continue to be sidelined, but he couldn't say he was very beaten up over that fact. Sitting down on the aging wooden bleachers, he took a look around the gymnasium, which was a place they rarely found themselves in. Light rain, hot, cold, damp, foggy, it didn't matter. Gym class was always an outdoor event. Being inside was a privilege among the students and usually meant playing a round of dodge-ball. Whether or not that would be happening today, wasn't entirely clear.  

He quietly laughed to himself once he noticed how Daphne was cautiously looking over her shoulder each time she pulled her phone out. Seemed she might have actually learned what was and wasn't allowed. Not that it really mattered, since she did it anyway, but was at least not as brazen about it. She let out a squeak of surprise as the gym door was kicked open, the sound reverberating around the barren interior. As the Yorkie scrambled to hide her phone, Ms. Holt marched inside, a sack of dodge-balls hoisted over her shoulder. 

"Yes!" the hyena cheered to himself. 

"Alright. Looks like we get a break today for a change." the more athletically gifted and uninjured human smiled.

Bryce regretted that he was benched for today, since he always enjoyed the scarce games of dodge-ball they'd play during these kind of days.

The lynx let off a shrill call from her whistle to silence the excited chattering of the students.

"Good news. You lot get to play some dodge-ball today. Bad news. You'll be making up this missed day tomorrow, so don't get too excited. Now, two laps around and then we'll line up for teams. Go!" she announced, ending with another toot from her whistle.

"Thank god I'm missing that too." he told himself, a silver lining of not being able to play.

The lynx grabbed the sack and dragged it over the last remaining feet towards the bleachers, standing near the human.

"Still hurt?" she asks, loosening the cord around the bag, pulling it open.

"Yeah. I can put more weight on it, but it usually cracks pretty bad when I do. Progress is progress though." he shrugged.

"You humans don't seem to heal that quick." she comments, pulling out one of the playground balls from the sack.

"Guess not. Could be worse though. At least it wasn't a break." Bryce replies.

"A sprain can be worse than a break. Ligaments and tendons are hard to properly heal, unlike bone." Ms. Holt informs, giving the ball a squeeze to see if it was properly inflated. 

"Huh. Didn't know that."

"You should pay attention to me more. Might learn a thing or two." she jokes, letting her discreet smile break through her rehearsed exterior.

"Did you just make a joke?" he chuckles, caught off guard by a sense of humor she'd never shown.

The lynx quickly regains her professional demeanor, giving the dodge-ball a testing bounce on the ground as her usual stone face reappears.

"You talk too much, Mister Martin." she states in an oddly proper tone, placing the rubber ball on the ground as she pulls out another one to test.

"Fair enough." he smirks, though he was sure he heard some humor in her voice.

By the time she finished testing each of the balls, the students finished their laps, excited to start the game.

"Looks like everyone is ready. Split off into teams. How about guys versus the girls?" Ms. Holt calls out, placing each of the dodge-balls in a line at the middle of the gymnasium. 

Every guy seemed pleased with the suggestion, while most of the females seemed put off by the idea.

"Isn't that a little un-PC?" one of the girls, a sloth, asks the coach.

"Canis canem edit." the lynx replies, turning to walk back towards the bleachers.

"And that means....?"

"Dog eat dog. Survival of the fittest if you want to live in a man's world. Now, line up, Amanda." Ms. Holt barks, returning to her post at the front of the bleachers.

The sloth rolls her eyes and joins the group of girls. The teams join up on either side of the room, standing with their fingertips touching the padded walls, taking a running position. Once Ms. Holt made sure everyone was ready, she let off another blast from her whistle and they all took off into a sprint, clamoring and fighting to get a ball.

"This should hopefully be as much fun to watch as it is to play." Bryce mentions aloud.

"Can be." she quietly answers, vigilantly watching each student, making sure no one was deliberately aiming for the head or groin.

The gym was filled with sounds of yelling, laughter, and grunts of pain and exertion. Every missed ball slammed into the wall with a resounding bang, mixing with the sounds of overhead thunder outside. The mixture of chaotic noises brought the lynx a sense of peace through the combined elements of discord and competition. It was only during these kind of games that the students displayed a genuine effort of sportsmanship and spirit. 

The lynx and human keenly watched each round with a joined sense of enthusiasm at the games. So far, the guys were in the lead at 2-1, but the girls were starting to fight back just as hard.

"Good game so far." Bryce says, hoping to get another conversation started.

"Mhm." she hums, more interested in seeing if the girls were capable of besting the males.

Seeing that she was too preoccupied, Bryce chose to watch the rest of the game quietly, waiting for a better time to talk. 

As the game grew longer, the girls managed to tie them at 3-3 after a few late game comebacks, both ending in a dramatic standoff. It was the last round that was the most heated. One of the girls that was on the softball team had managed to dominate the boys after figuring out their patterns, picking each off with her windmill of an arm, each painful sounding thud causing the teacher to smirk. Sadly, she got too cocky and was eliminated after letting herself get distracted, much to Ms. Holt's disappointment. Only the Yorkie was left on the girl's team, while the boy's had three students left. To their shock, she managed to show some impressive dexterity from her daily yoga courses, gracefully dodging each attack, following up with some weak throws of her own. Most throws went wide, but she soon started to target their legs, managing to close the game, despite being outnumbered. 

Ms. Holt sounds her whistle to call the game, announcing the girls as the victors to the claps and cheers of the females and Bryce.

"Winner!" she yells, walking over to the student with that rare and sneaky smile.

"I did it!" Daphne cheers, happy she finally managed to win something.

"You did very well. I guess yoga isn't a complete waste after all. Good job." the lynx congratulates, giving her a pat on the shoulder.

The canine beamed up at the coach, before walking back to the team, earning more pats on the back. 

"Alright. You can all split off into teams or have a rematch, if you lot want to earn back some pride." she shouts, walking back to the bleachers as everyone returns the balls to the center, quickly reforming teams.

Bryce gave a few last claps once the teacher returned.

"She did good. I'm surprised." he smiles.

"I love being proven wrong about people. I'm sure she'll remember how good that felt. Better than followers or retweets or whatever it is people like that worry about." the lynx says with a pleased sigh.

"As a teacher, I bet." he nods, watching as the next game began.

The two observed the other students, the previous atmosphere of competition now replaced with a jovial playfulness, the teams now mixed up instead of being segregated by gender. Apparently, there was now nothing at stake with the previous game over, so no one was taking it as seriously as before.

"So....have you ever gotten injured before? With all the sports you've played, I'm guessing you've had a few." Bryce tries to continue the topic they were discussing prior to the dodge-ball game.

"Just because I played some sports, you think I'd be sloppy enough to let myself get hurt?" she growls, though there was a sarcastic hint in her tone.

"Well, I mean, yeah? Comes with the territory, you know? You also seemed to not about sprains and breaks." he gulps, unsure if he had somehow offended her.

"I'm a phys-ed teacher, Bryce. It's my job to know about these things. I did need to earn a degree to teach." she points out, her furry tail curling behind her.

"I understand. Sorry for asking a dumb question." he apologizes, sinking down where he sat.

Ms. Holt peers over at him from the corner of her eye with a smirk on her muzzle.

"Relax, I'm just kidding. Of course I've been injured before. Nothing says 'Giving 110%' like winding up in the emergency room." she says with a faint chuckle.

"Can't say I'm very surprised. Probably tried to walk it off too, until they forced you into an ambulance." he jokes, letting out a breath he didn't know he was holding.

"Hard to walk off a broken femur." she huffs, ears perking up at a shrill squeal of one of the students takes a dodge-ball to the groin.

"A femur? Ouch. How did you manage to do that?" he asks, shivering at the thought.

"I was training to be a gymnast when I was in middle school. To get into one of the programs, you had to pass a physical test that involved a trampoline. To make a long story short, I landed towards the end of it and got my leg wedged between the mat and the frame. Normally, that would just mean a really painful groin hit and a big bruise, but I was falling forward when I landed. Snapped instantly. Guess big bones just mean brittle bones." she sighs, ears flattening against her head at the memory.

"Oh god. I'm sorry. I can't imagine how that would have been." Bryce grunts in a mutual discomfort.

"Sounded like someone broke a tree branch. Adrenaline is a funny thing. I didn't feel any pain. Only numbness and a weird burning feeling. Wasn't until I was nearing the hospital that it started to hurt." the lynx exhales through her nostrils.

"That is some really bad luck. Nothing you could have really done either." he frowns.

"Well, good luck and bad luck. Your leg has one of the biggest arteries in your body that runs along the largest bone that is under enormous pressure by some of the thickest muscles. The break was clean. If it was really bad, those razor sharp bone fragments could have sliced through any of that and I could have bled out right there. So, I'm thankful it wasn't that bad with all things considered." she shrugged, giving him another brief glance, before returning her attention to the game.

"Huh. Yeah, when you put it that way. I mean, you seem to be a really good runner, so I'm hoping it didn't leave any permanent damage."

"I never feel any." she nods.

Without taking her eyes off the students, she turns to the side and picks up her left leg, bringing it up to rest on the bleacher step in front of the human. 

"Went into surgery that day and they put a steel rod and some pins in. Guess the break wasn't as clean as they'd have liked, but I'm not exactly a doctor." she states, gesturing with her pointer finger along her thigh.

Bryce's posture stiffened up in his seat once she presented her leg towards him, accepting any invitation to openly stare at her body. HIs eyes drifted along her tall limb, able to see the robust muscles pressing against the thin material of her dark track pants. Moving along, his gaze fell down to her feet, noticing that her usual black running shoes were replaced with a different pair. A sky blue base and highlights of a brilliant yellow that cross the rubber sole and sides in multiple stripes, a contrast to the usual darkened colors of the standard pair of shoes she wore.

"Modern science is amazing. Hey, are you wearing new shoes?" he said at a quickened pace, not having noticed them earlier that week.

"Hmm?" she looked over at him, confused at first, until she glanced down at her paws.

"Oh, yeah. I rotate a few pairs. I experiment and try out different supports, soles, brands, and whatever. Nice to have some already broken in when the need comes to swap out a pair." she nods, looking back over at the game.

"Makes sense." he replies in a distracted voice, after she pulled her leg away.

He only got the beginning of what she said, before he found himself distracted with what was in front of him. With her leg lifted up on the bleacher, her pant leg that would normally hang only an inch above her shoe was now hiked up, revealing the tops of her socks that he had never gotten to see before until now. 

A very familiar pair.

A black pair.

A brand with a logo depicting the outline of a pouncing cheetah stitched in the side.

The very same brand and color as the socks his nameless anthro vixen had been selling to him. 

Bryce felt his palms start to sweat as his breathing grew noticeably more shallow and rapid. It had to be just a coincidence, right? It was one of the most popular and largest athletic brands that was famous around the globe, so it wasn't exactly an odd thing for something to wear. Seeing as she wore a black track suit and running shoes, the choice in color was an obvious choice as well. 

He cleared his throat and wiped his moist palms on his pant legs, shaking his head to clear the thoughts of his lewd conspiracy. As improbable as the idea was, it was certainly a hot fantasy to be frank. One he'd most certainly be using when he got home today.

Ms. Holt checked the clock and slipped the whistle tip against her lips, letting off another screeching blast to call the game. The human gasps in surprise at the noise as he is brought back to reality.

"Time's up, people! Hit the locker room and get changed. I'll see you people tomorrow and I expect sunshine, so I hope you're ready!" she yells, bending down to pick up the sack, holding it open for everyone to deposit the dodge-balls into.

The class lets out a collective whine as they trudged across the polished gym floor, tossing the balls into the bag, sulking out of the gymnasium to switch back into their school clothes.

"Daphne." the lynx snaps at the Yorkie as she walks by.

"Yes?" the canine sighs, looking over at the teacher, expecting her usual earful.

"You did good today. Keep up the good work." Ms. Holt nods at the girl.

"Oh. Thanks!" the girl chuckles with a surprised smile.

"You're welcome. Now get changed." the lynx smirks, tying the dodgeball bag shut.

Daphne skips ahead, catching up with her friends as they file out of the gym.

"I hope that ankle starts feeling better. Don't want you getting spoiled. I think the others are getting jealous." the lynx jokingly chides Bryce.

"We'll see." he chuckles, stealing a glance at her shoes, feeling his cheeks grow the faintest shade of red as the dirty thoughts re-enter his mind.

"Indeed. Now hobble back to the locker room and get out of here." she smirks, lifting the sack over her shoulder, kicking open the door, only to hold it open for him.

Upon seeing the gesture, he hops out of the bleacher, his ankle quickly reminding him of why he was benched in the first place. He hisses in pain and limps over to the door.

"Thanks. See you tomorrow." he pants, giving her an appreciative nod.

"Have a good day. No falling in anymore holes. I don't care how much you hate running." she smiles, only doing so when his back was turned and everyone had already left.

"Don't tempt me!" he fires back, pulling open the door to the men's locker room, stepping inside.

The lynx snorts and drags the bag down the hall towards the equipment room.

Bryce walks over to his locker, fumbling with the combination, until he manages to steady his fingers and unlock it. He was too distracted by the idea of what he had seen. As he pulls out his  backpack and throws it over his shoulder, the only thought he had was getting home and diving under the bed for those socks.

------

The bus lurches to a halt with a hiss from the air brakes. Pulling the strap of his backpack up over his shoulder, Bryce lifts himself up from the bench seat and stumbles his way up the aisles, leaning on the tops of each seat for support. When he reaches the front, he grips the handrail tightly and descends down the five steps, the pain and discomfort from his ankle barking at him with each footfall. 

"Gonna need to ice this up when I get home." he sighs as he steps off the bus, walking alongside it down the sidewalk, seeing his mother parked in her usual spot on the side of the road.

He waves over at her, approaching the idling vehicle and climbing into the passenger seat, shaking the rain off from his jacket. 

"Hi, hon. Still hurting?" his mother asks, switching off the hazard lights, while shifting the car into drive.

"Yeah. Comes and goes. It's getting there though." he nods, pulling on his seatbelt. 

"That's good. I got you another bottle of ibuprofen. It should be on your desk." 

"Good, cause I need it." he huffs, switching on the seat warmers to warm his pants that were still damp from the rainfall. 

He reclines his seat and stretches out his legs, listening to the whirr of the windshield wipers pushing away the rain that continued to steadily fall.

"Another package came for you. Felt heavier than the last one. I left it on your bed." she states to Bryce.

The human tenses up in his seat at the announcement.

"Cool." he casually replies, hiding the excitement in his voice. 

"What was it this time? For someone that isn't able to work, you've been getting a lot of things in the mail. Felt like a shoebox or something." she asks, pulling onto their road.

"Uh, could have been? I bought a lot of cards someone found in their basement. They didn't bother looking through everything, so they just sold them all as is. Could be some good things in there." he lies, hoping he was able to come up with a convincing lie.

"Let's hope you find another winner in there. Don't want you wasting your money." she cautions, entering their driveway.

"Either way, it's a ton of cards for the price." he continues, unlatching his seatbelt, nearly throwing the car door open as he hops out.

"Be home in a bit. You know the routine. Should be an ice pack in the freezer for you too. Gotta go pick your dad up from work. That damn car of his broke down in the parking lot again, so we may be home late." she informs her son, throwing the car in reverse.

"Sounds good. No rush." he quickly replies, power-walking up to the front door, waving goodbye to his mother.

As she pulls out and drives back down out of the neighborhood, Bryce shoves the front door open and hurries inside, slamming it shut behind him. He kicks off his shoes, no longer feeling any pain in his ankle, which was now masked by a burning fire of lust that needed to be satiated. He runs down the hall and bursts into his room, closing and locking the door as he had so many times. 

He turns to see the large rectangular package sitting on his comforter. He didn't even need to see the fake name and address to know what it was or who it was from. Shipping did indeed take a week and was right on time like always. Bryce scrambles to his desk, finding his pocket knife, which he nearly plunges into the cardboard, but forces himself to calm down. Forcing himself to be more cautious, he slices through the translucent tape and rips the packaging open, revealing that it was indeed a shoebox beneath. 

"Fuck yes." he pants, grabbing the lid and flipping it open, his eyes widening as its contents.

No.

Fucking.

Way.

He could feel the blood rumbling in his ear drums, his heart pounding so hard that he felt it'd burst through his chest.

"Holy shit." he exclaims in a wavering tone, falling to his knees, leaning over the box.

There they were. 

Ms. Holt's shoes.

There was no way this was a coincidence too. They were hers. Hands shaking with excitement, Bryce reaches into the box and pulls out one of the shoes. He'd never gotten to see them up close like this before. A black running shoe with a white sole and a reflective grey stripe pattern running across the sides and matching black laces. He flipped the shoe over and noticed the treads of the shoe were worn down and even completely bald at the spots where ones toes and heel would lay. The textured white sides that ran up from the sole was lightly stained with grass from the football field she had ran across during class day after day. It felt heavy in his hands, which made sense from the size of it. Now curious, he tugged the tongue upwards and checked the size. 

"Goddamn." he groans, seeing the size marked as "17".

He guessed that she couldn't find a big enough size in a woman's shoe and had to wear a man's instead. Since he was already looking at the front of it, he pulled the tongue back to peer inside. He felt his already stiff member throb once he saw the insole, getting a partial look at the marks. Yanking at the laces to loosen them, he open the shoe up more to look inside. The insole was heavily marked by the lynx's powerful foot. A perfect imprint was left behind. Grooves and curves followed the outline of her huge paw, dents and trenches from her heel and paw-pad sunk into the fabric. Wherever her paw laid was now marked and stained by dark blotches of sweat and perspiration. Clearly, she'd worn these for quite some time. Bryce dipped his fingers inside, biting his lip as he touched the outline, moving his fingers deeper to feel multiple divots from her big, furry toes towards the front. 

These were already better than any sock she'd sent him. To actually see the wear and damage left behind from wearing them every single day was staggering. He couldn't wait any longer. With his inspection over, he shakily lifted them to his face, able to feel the blanket of musk from the opening tickling his nose. With a quiet groan, he shoved his nose into the opening, which engulfed him, big enough for him to even get his mouth inside. He closed his eyes and took in a heavy inhale of the shoe, rubbing himself with a free hand as the year's worth of sweat and stink penetrated his senses. His head hung backwards, moaning into the shoe as he sniffed, huffing the heavenly aroma of his gym teacher's paw perfume. He ground his nose over the insole, feeling the imprint of her paw, resting his nose into the dent left behind by her pad. 

"Oh, yes, Ms. Holt." he loudly moans, sticking out his tongue to lash it over the insole, releasing the trapped flavor of her pheromone laced sudor. 

His fingers grabbed and squeezed his cock through his pants, his nose snuffling as he attempted to cram it into the toebox, wanting to smell the tang left behind by her thick digits, but was unable to. Like a dirty pig sniffing for truffles, his nose explored the interior of the lynx's running shoe, pressing his nostrils flat to it, inhaling the pungent essence those incredible, beautiful paws had left behind.

After taking his time with the first, he eventually forced himself to pull back, after one last swipe of his tongue across the bedding inside. Placing it back on his bed, he pulled out the other, almost forgetting about the note left behind. Like the others, it was placed inside of a storage bag, along with a picture of her paws. The picture this time depicted those paws side by side, one with the toes scrunched, the sole wrinkled, while the toes of the other paw were curled backwards and fanned apart. God, did she know how to tease. 

He pulled out the bag and  checked the handwritten note.

"These shoes were wrapped around my paws everyday for the last year, sweating inside of them with my socks you know and love, stinking them up for a paw slut like you to enjoy and rut. Enjoy and try not to make too big of a mess."

Bryce let out a breath after he read the note, imaging Ms. Holt wearing those shoes and running in them, now knowing that she planned to just sell them off for some pervert to enjoy. He couldn't believe that someone like her would not only tolerate something like this, but actually encourage it. The thought did nothing but fill the human with pure, unadulterated lust.

Getting an idea, he tore himself away from the shoebox and moved to his computer, rapidly punching the keys with his fingertips, until he reached the site. Reaching the cam-room, he saw that she was online, just like before. It now made sense, seeing as they both left the school at the same time. Bryce didn't just plan on pleasuring himself with her shoes all alone. No, he wanted her to watch. To see how turned on she made him and witness him defile her shoes. Quickly navigating through the site, he contacts her through an instant messenger, rather than sending her a note like he usually would.

==============================================================================

Bryce sent over the payment to her account, not too thrilled about dropping more money, but knew it would be worth it. With that out of the way, he stands up and plugs in his webcam, blowing the dust off of the plastic lens. The computer chimes as the webcam connects, Bryce then moving the shoebox onto his desk. He opens up an application for the camera to make sure there wasn't any way he could accidentally bring his face into frame. Satisfied, he takes a breath and leans over his keyboard. He invites her into a separate cam-room and nervously gulps, unable to believe what was about to happen. As she joins the room, he steps into frame, pulling her shoes out of the box to lay them on the top of his desk, starting to pant as he undoes his belt and drops his pants, leaving him in his boxers. Bryce stares at his monitor, watching his thin frame on the camera.

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 15:24] maneater85: oooooh hello there ;)

[2019-04-16 15:24] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: you like what you see?

[2019-04-16 15:24] maneater85: mmhmm. y dont u show me that cock

 [2019-04-16 15:24] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: mmm you want to see it?

[2019-04-16 15:24] maneater85: yes pls!

==============================================================================

Bryce softly gasps at her request, feeling himself grow harder inside his tight fitting boxers, feeling a surge of arousal coursing through his cock as his gym teacher asks to see it. He turns sideways to the webcam, hooking his fingers into his waistband, slowly tugging it down, his cheeks burning red. The human's manhood pops free, heart pounding in his chest as he exposes himself to Ms. Holt, turning his head to the camera to watch his modest sized member gently bouncing in the open air, hanging just over her shoes. 

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 15:26] maneater85: mmm fuck! sexy cock ;)

[2019-04-16 15:26] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: you like my human dick?

[2019-04-16 15:26] maneater85: yessss. kinda wanna taste it :p

[2019-04-16 15:27] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: bet your muzzle would feel amazing around my cock. id let you suck it all day

[2019-04-16 15:27] maneater85: now howsabout u jerk that fleshy cock and sniff my shoes ;)

==============================================================================

His hand shot to his groin, squeezing and jerking his erection, retracting his foreskin to let a copious amount of pre trickle down over his fingers. Bryce obliges to the lynx's request, picking up her right running shoe, showing it to the camera, while he played with his cock. Leaning closer to his webcam, he lifts the shoe to flash the musky interior, before pressing it to his nose, burying it inside as he takes in a deep sniff, making sure he was loud enough for the microphone to pick up his lewd huffing. The human lets out a genuine moan, not needing to put on an exaggerated show to the vixen. Taking a risk, he inches back from the webcam, the large running shoe being big enough to conceal his face, facing the webcam as he pumps his pre slickened hand over his shaft, never taking his face away from her shoe. Bryce can't help but moan at the situation, sniffing and licking at the stained insole of her running shoe, aiming his member towards the camera as he stroked it, occasionally pausing to pull his hand away, letting the gym teacher watch him throb and dribble his thin pre upon the desk.

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 15:35] maneater85: look at u go lol 

[2019-04-16 15:35] maneater85: mmm ur throbbing too

[2019-04-16 15:35] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: worth every penny

[2019-04-16 15:35] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: you wanna watch your dirty human fuck these?

[2019-04-16 15:35] maneater85: so badly!

[2019-04-16 15:36] PM_ME_YOUR_FEET: im going to breed it. fill it with cum

[2019-04-16 15:36] maneater85: show me

==============================================================================

He keeps the used shoe pressed to his face, inhaling the stink of stale sweat as he grabs the other shoe, gripping the front of it. Bryce rubs his member over the top of it, teasing himself, his pre trickling down to smear over the fabric. He hisses through his teeth, sweeping his glans over her shoelaces.

"Hope you enjoy this as much as I will, Ms. Holt." he quietly purrs into her shoe, knowing she wouldn't be able to hear.

Bryce stands up on his tiptoes, shifting his hips forward, until his tip enters the opening of the shoe, before thrusting forward, jamming his length inside of the smelly footwear. His uncut cock slides over the imprint of her paw, moaning aloud as he grinds his tip into the insole, the texture of it now smooth from being worn for as long as she had it. He didn't hold back. The human drove his manhood in and out of the running shoe in long, deep thrusts as if he was mating with the lynx herself. That cock of his managed to pierce deep enough into the shoe, until his tip ground against her deep toeprints, his scrotum resting where her heel would as he rutted the musky shoe.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================

"Jesus Christ." he groans, watching the chat fill up with the inexcusably obscene messages from his gym teacher.

His only regret so far was not saving himself the few days prior, wanting to deliver her a truly spectacular load, though he felt like this one wasn't going to be anything small either. His pre flowed like a fountain, soaking the already tarnished insole, giving him some sort of lubrication, his cock now violently firing inside of it as he pumped his hips. The shoe around his face had grown hot from his persistent panting and sniffing, freeing some of the peppery paw stink that was infused with the sole, now smelling almost as if she had just slipped it off her massive paw. Bryce soon switched shoes, slipping his pulsating cock into the warm one, loudly groaning, proclaiming his lust for the gym teacher's paws and used shoes. 

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 15:59] maneater85: keep moaning slut

[2019-04-16 15:59] maneater85: moan for me

[2019-04-16 16:00] maneater85: and fill that shoe

[2019-04-16 16:00] maneater85: blow that big creamy load

==============================================================================

"Anything for you, mistress." he huffs, biting his lower lip as he violated the running shoe.

The shivering human rapidly bucks his hips, stabbing his uncut tip against the toe-bed of the shoe, gradually soaking the soft worn insole with his slippery pre that now flowed like a fountain from his tip, feeling his body starting to quake with an impending orgasm. He forced the shoe downwards over the top of his manhood, creating a perfectly snug tunnel for him to penetrate, eventually ceasing his thrusts to instead rock his palm over the running shoe, grinding it downwards over his erection, milking his cock with the smelly, sweat stained fabric. Bryce whined and huffed, his balls heaving in need for a release, feeling his warm precum over his stiff member as it twitched over the paw matted insole. Taking in a deep breath, he doubled his efforts, vigorously mating with the well loved running shoe, no longer restraining himself, but instead pounding his way towards a well needed sloppy climax.

"Fuck yes. I'm going to cum!" he groans aloud, turning to see his gym teacher quickly typing up a message, double checking to make sure his face was still out of frame as well.

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 16:07] maneater85: do it sexy

[2019-04-16 16:07] maneater85: cum in my smelly shoe

[2019-04-16 16:07] maneater85: moan like the slut u r

==============================================================================

Bryce gave into her orders, bellowing out a euphoric outcry as he finally let loose, allowing himself two more thrusts into the shoe, before going still. He could feel the goosebumps rising up his legs and over his back, sending a rush of warmth and endorphins coursing through his body as wave after wave of human seed rocketed from his cock, spilling a torrent of hot cum into the shoe, hearing the faint thud from the impact of each ribbon of semen colliding with the front of the heavily worn piece of footwear, a shrill cry from the human following each release. 

"Oh, yes!" he howls, unable to keep himself from going back to feverishly humping the musky shoe.

He whines and slips his cock through the heavy puddle of warm semen that was slowly seeping into the material of the damp insole, coaxing out a few more ropes of his rich cum to spill from his twitching cockslit. Keeping his manhood inside of the shoe, he shifts back from the table, falling back to his feet, his throbbing erection managing to actually hold the heavy shoe that dangled from his shaft like a lewd hood ornament, presenting his prize to the webcam as he caught his breath.

==============================================================================

[2019-04-16 16:09] maneater85: mmmmmmmm

[2019-04-16 16:10] maneater85: fuck u hav to be so hard

[2019-04-16 16:10] maneater85: didnt think ud be wearing my shoe too :p

==============================================================================

"Mmmm, all for you, gorgeous." he pants, sliding her shoe off of his manhood, exposing his naked cock that was covered with his sticky seed.

He then tilted the shoe to the side, holding it above his desk to pour out the overflow of semen that was unable to stick to the fabric, a hearty pool of the creamy man milk drooling out. After empty out what he could, he lifted it to the camera, showing her the abundant amount of seed clinging to her insole that pooled inside of the smelly imprint left behind by her heavy lynx paw.

[2019-04-16 16:23] maneater85: cya cutie

==============================================================================

Bryce unplugged his webcam and logged off the site.

"See you tomorrow, Ms. Holt." he smirks, walking to his dirty clothes hamper to pull out a towel he used after his morning shower, wiping his cock clean. 

He then took her shoe off of his desk and stuffed the towel inside, stretching out his fingers inside to gather and wipe up the tacky mess he had left inside, cleaning it as best as he could. After he finished, he took a look inside to see a thick, damp streak of leftover semen staining the already battered insole, shrugging at the sight. He at least had the other to smell and worship and planned to just use this one as a fucktoy and cum dumpster anyway. Before it could dry, he cleaned off the pool of semen off of the top of his desk, tossing the towel back into his hamper. He then redressed and flopped down on his bed, stashing her shoes underneath his box spring after giving them one last sniff of her powerful musk. 

"Hmm, tomorrow should be interesting." Bryce says to himself, his post-orgasmic clarity starting to kick in, wondering how he'd function around her with the newly gained knowledge of her indecent secret.

Whatever thoughts he had were soon pushed away as he heard a car pulling into the driveway, letting out a sigh as his parents unlocked the front door and walked inside.

--------

Just as predicted, the day turned out to beautiful, free from clouds and rain, much to the disappointment of the students who weren't looking forward to making up for the previous day off. Bryce limped down the stairs towards the football field, the other students sulking along past him. Descending down the concrete steps, he walked forward to the opened gate of the fence, looking up to see Ms. Holt standing to the side with a clipboard, taking attendance of each pupil that passed her. The lynx checked everyone to make sure they were in accordance with the dress code, when she saw Bryce.

"Still hobbling?" she asks, the sunlight reflecting off of the whistle dangling from her neck, briefly blinding the human.

"U-uh, yeah." he gulps, nervously limping past her to take his usual seat on the bleacher.

"Wonderful." she sighed, checking him off of the attendance sheet. 

The teacher closed the gate after the last student entered, turning to walk over to the class that was already in the process of stretching out.

"Alright, listen up. We're just going to do our usual routine today, plus only two extra laps to make up for yesterday. Not in the mood to give you all the full extra load, but don't you make the mistake of thinking that I'm starting to go easy on you all from now on. Stretch for another five minutes and we'll start." she announces, tossing the whistle in her lips to give out a short toot to quiet down the cheers and sighs of relief.

She then turns back and walks across the track and field to the bleachers, Bryce noticing she was still wearing the new pair of shoes he spotted the previous day, blushing at the sight of the blue and yellow running shoes, wondering who would be the lucky guy to purchase those once she put them up for sale. The idea of her taking advantage of gym class to break in her shoes to sell caused a sudden throb in his manhood, crossing his legs to hide it.

"Now I need to think of how I'm going to get you caught up on your exercise after you heal." she comments, her tone making it hard to tell if she was serious or not.

"Sure you'll think of something." he clears his throat, feeling paranoid that she knew it was him behind that webcam.

"Indeed. Hope you can still handle it." Ms. Holt smirks, taking her post in front the bleachers.

Bryce let his eyes wander over her body again, trailing over that muscular frame, once again landing on her shoes. He was already  thinking of how they'd smell. If they were new or a pair she'd be working on for weeks. The faint wear along the rubber sides of the sole showed they weren't exactly pristine. She probably had to buy new socks every week at the rate she was selling them. Worth every penny though. The more he looked over her and her shoes, the more he wanted to ask about them. Part of him wanted to keep his mouth shut, but the other wanted to see how far he could go into dangerous territory of exposing his secret, mining for some more material to fantasize over, while he rutted with her shoes later on today.

"S-so.......how long have you had those shoes for?" he stutters.

Ms. Holt glances down at them to remind herself of which pair she had on.

"Maybe a month. Why?" she replies in a bored tone.

"Uh, just curious." he coughs, now realizing he should have an actual reason for the question.

Mmm, a month of working out in those shoes. Probably already smelled to high heavens. Bryce ignored the worry he was feeling in his stomach, wanting to know more.

"What size? They look kinda big." Bryce comments, already knowing the answer, but wanting to keep the conversation going.

The lynx turned her head slightly in his direction.

"You saying my feet are too big?"

"......I guess so." he answered, hoping she wouldn't be offended.

"Well, seeing as they're a size seventeen wide, you would be right. Great observation." the lynx says in a dry tone.

"Wow. That's really big." he huffs, growing harder after hearing her say it.

"I've always had big paws. All lynxs do. Having small ones would be odd." she shrugs, watching over the class.

"I can tell. Must be hard finding shoes in your size." Bryce bites at the inside of his cheek.

"There are plenty of sites to find shoes this big. I usually wait for them to go on clearance though and buy a few pairs."

"Saves money."

"Mhm." she nods, checking her watch and blowing her whistle to alert the students to start running.

Bryce watches the others get up from the ground and break off into a light jog. He needed a distraction to occupy his mind. His brain told him to stop talking, but his growing erection said otherwise.

"Do you like being a gym teacher?" Bryce innocently asks, figuring out how he was going to steer the conversation towards a comment he wanted to make.

Ms. Holt pondered the question over in her head, having mixed feelings about being forced to take this job and not the one she deserved. After a moment, she decided on what to say.

"I enjoy pushing students to the best of their ability. Helping them overcome faults and short comings with discipline and exercise. When you're head is filled with negative thoughts, a brisk sprint on a cold morning will clear your mind better than any drug. When you're lungs are burning and muscles are screaming for you to stop, you won't have any room in your head for those kind of thoughts. I wish I was somewhere else though, if I'm being honest. A new environment would be a godsend. Feels like I'm trapped in a bubble when I'm teaching at the same school I went to. That being said, I'm going to do my best and give the students a teacher they deserve. I see people struggling and have to remind myself that I was just like them. To do good, you have to be the person that you needed during your struggles." she eventually answers, shifting her weight onto one of her legs, crossing her arms over her chest, letting out a long sigh once she finished.

Bryce was caught off guard by such a heartfelt answer, suddenly feeling bad for using the whole situation for his own gain. 

"Jeez. I was kinda expecting a 'yes' or 'no'. You're one of my favorite teachers, so I'm glad you're still here though." he smiles.

Ms. Holt sinks her head down and lets herself smile back at the kind words.

"I don't hear that very often. I've already accepted the fact that nearly every student hates me, so thank you for saying that." she exhales.

"No they don't. It's just teenagers begin teenagers." he states.

"Oh, don't lie. I know they can't stand class. They'd rather be with a teacher that actually smiles." the lynx sighs, flicking her bangs out from the front of her eyes.

"Don't sell yourself short. Look at how happy Daphne was when she won the dodgeball game yesterday." he points out, looking over at the Yorkie as she jogged by.

"I didn't forget. She does seem to be actually trying today too. Already finished three laps in the time it normally takes her to do one." she chuckles, nodding at the girl as she jogged by.

"See? I bet tons of students look back on you and realize how much you helped them." Bryce smiles again.

"Some even visit. Alright, you've proved your point." she groans, starting to feel flattered at how one of her students was cheering her up.

"As long as it helped." the human chuckles, watching the students starting on their last lap.

"It did. Being a gym teacher has some perks I guess. No grading homework, no tests, no slaving over lesson plans. Only downside is the weather. Jogging in the rain isn't bad, but it can get irritating." Ms. Holt smirks, looking over the class to see if anyone was slacking.

"All that running each class has to take its toll. I know I hate feeling dirty." he shakes his head.

"You would be right. Have tons of laundry. Gotta keep a bunch of backup clothes in my office, since these track suits can get a bit fragrant after a class in the hot sun." the lynx nods with a grunt.

"Yeah, I bet your shoes get pretty smelly too." he blurts out, caught up in the moment.

Ms. Holt turns to look at him with a perplexed expression across her muzzle.

"Indeed. You seem fixated on shoes for some reason." she rumbles, starting to feel on edge.

"Y-yeah, I-I just like them I guess. Have a thing for shoes." Bryce stammers, feeling his cheeks flush at his slip of the tongue.

"Clearly." she curtly replies.

"N-no, it's not like t-that. You said I'm a good observer. Running all day would make your shoes and socks smelly and sweaty obviously. Just an-nother.....observation." he fumbles through the sentence, trying to play it all off, but only digging the hole deeper.

The lynx stayed silent, growing more and more suspicious of her student, eyelids squinting at him.

"Not that I would know of course!" he clarifies, cheeks burning red.

"Know what?" Ms. Holt growls, pressing the human for what he was trying to cover up.

".....uh, your smelly shoes? I-I didn't mean it like that. They might not even be like that! I know mine don't, but I don't have big furry paws like you do. T-they.....probably...." Bryce's words crawled to a halt.

"Probably what?" she asks, her eyes burning a hole into his own.

".....sweat a lot. Inside of your shoes and socks." he cringes, unable to even move away from the overbearing lynx at this point.

"What are you hiding from me?" she accuses, stepping up on one of the bleachers to lurch herself over him, glaring down at the human whose anxious squirming was giving his intentions away.

"Nothing!" he begs, wishing he could shrink down and disappear. 

"Tell me." she snarls, not caring if the students saw the commotion. 

"Okay....fine. Y-you already know." Bryce whimpers.

"Know what?"

"Y-you know. Your....business? Selling.....modeling..." he swallows a dry lump in his throat, forcing himself to glance up at her face.

Ms. Holt could feel the blood in her face fading as her eyes widened, pupils dilating in shock. The human closed his eyes in fear, waiting for her to pounce at him and tear him to shreds.

"Why don't you go see if your ankle is feeling better." she growls, body shaking in pure rage and horror.

"W-what?"

"Run!" she yells in his face, chest heaving as she failed to catch her breath, watching the human yelp and leap off of the bleachers, taking off in a dead sprint down the track.

Bryce couldn't even feel the pain in his ankle barking at him to stop as he tore down the path, putting as much distance between him and the fiery lynx as possible.

"Damn! Guess he was faking it!"

"No wonder why she's pissed."

He ignored the taunts of his classmates and kept running, pumping his legs and arms, almost in tears after being found out. Bryce screamed at himself in his head, scolding himself for being so stupid and letting such a thing slip. He managed to keep the secret for not even an entire school day! If only he was able to keep his dick in check and stopped letting it get the best of him. He shouldn't have even asked to stream to her. Just jerk off and keep his mouth shut, but no. 

Bryce couldn't even look at the lynx as he rounded the next bend, feeling his heart race as she left her post and started to jog behind him. The adrenaline kicked in and the human started to run as fast as he could, sprinting past the winded classmates. Ms. Holt snarled and doubled her pace, effortlessly catching up to him. He started to cry and pant, still relying on sheer adrenaline to keep himself in front of her, but the short burst of energy was already waning. 

"Don't you dare slow down! You owe me almost two weeks!" she yells at him, the toes of her shoes kicking at his heels as he slowed.

"He is fucked." the hyena laughs as he finished his laps.

"I'm sorry!" he sobs, pushing himself to keep running, starting to now feel the pain creeping up from his injured ankle.

"Not yet, you aren't!" she retorts, now sprinting beside him, jaw clenching from the ferocity of her temper.

Bryce groaned in pain, already rounding the next bend to run another lap. By the time he finished the next one, he heard the school bell ringing.

"Uh, are we done here? Ms. Holt!" one of the students yelled as she passed by.

"Yes! Class dismissed!" she barks, blowing her whistle as she sprinted, before spitting it out to focus on the prey in front of her.

Bryce turned to look behind him, hoping he was free to go as well.

"You aren't finished! You owe me! Now run!" she screams at his back, sweat starting to bead on her forehead.

Bryce cried and knew he was fucked. His side was already starting to seize up from a cramp stabbing his muscles. While his hand cupped his burning ribs, Bryce slowed as he rounded the first bend, his sweaty shirt stuck to his back, his thighs chaffing from his denim jeans. At the next bend, he could see that the class was already gone, leaving him at the mercy of the frenzied instructor.

After another lap, his ankle gave out and he ended up stumbling and falling, collapsing to the ground.

"Get up! We're just getting started." the lynx hisses, coming to a stop beside him.

"Please! My ankle is going to break. I can't do anymore!" he begs, holding his leg to let his ankle rest.

"You think I care?" she sneers, hands on her hips.

"You should be. Making a student run against his doctor's orders." Bryce whines, wondering if he'd be able to even walk back to the locker room.

Ms. Holt snarled at the accusation, but knew he was right. Besides, she'd made her point loud and clear.

"Get your ass up. We'll talk more in my office, since I don't need anyone seeing you keeling over." she growled, walking away from him.

Bryce took a moment to catch his breath, sputtering in pain as his body cried out from overexertion. He turned over onto his knees, dry heaving, before forcing himself to stand. He took one step and felt a searing pain stabbing his ankle. Knowing it was all almost over for now, he took another careful step, eventually limping his way over to the fence, seeing that the lynx was nowhere to be seen and presumably already waiting in her office. The human tightly gripped the handrail and pulled himself up the steps, crossing the short path to step back into the now empty school, limping down the hallway, until he reached her office. The small room was settled between the entrances of both locker rooms, curtains already pulled down over the windows. Fearing the worst, he twisted the knob and stepped inside, seeing her sitting in her office chair, looking up at him as he entered.

"Don't you know how to knock?" she growls from behind her desk.

"I'm sorry." he whines, shutting the door and hobbling over to sit down in the chair in front of her desk.

The lynx sat motionless, hands clutching each other on top of her desk, staring at him with a fiery gaze. Without warning, she shot across the desk, grabbing him by the collar of his t-shirt to jerk him forward, their noses nearly touching.

"You aren't going to speak a fucking WORD to anyone. Do you understand me?" she bellows into his face, shaking and rattling him with every syllable that spat from her maw. 

Bryce whimpered and furiously shook his head in understanding.

"I didn't come this far to lose it all over some fucking paw bitch, you hear me!?" she threatens, jolting her hold upwards, almost lifting him out of his seat.

"Yes! I swear, I won't tell anyone!" he begs, petrified of her.

"Good!" she shoves him back into his chair, causing it to scoot back an inch with a squeal.

The human falls back and quivers in his seat, gulping and waiting for what would happen next.

"I'm sorry." he repeats, wanting to make things better.

"Shut up. You've done enough. I was just hoping you were some pervert student with a thing for paws, but of course not. You had to fuck up everything." she berates him, returning to her seat.

"I didn't mean it." he pleads, looking down at the ground.

"The fuck you didn't. When exactly did you discover it was me? Can't even believe I'm having this conversation." she groans in disgust at herself for having her private life exposed.

"W-when I got your shoes. I saw your socks one day, but didn't know for sure until yesterday." he nervously fidgets in the chair.

"Uh huh. You knew, but still insisted on live streaming, didn't you? And you said you didn't mean it." she bears her teeth to him.

Bryce turns away in embarrassment, staying silent.

"That's what I thought. Fucking slut." she insults, leaning back in her chair.

He closed his eyes in shame. Bryce respected her so much and ruined everything. Even then and in spite of everything that had occurred, he at that moment realized he was sporting a massive erection at her belittling him. As much as he told himself it would never happen again after he nearly broke his ankle from her punishment, he wanted to go further. Everything was already ruined, so was there any harm?

"I wanted to. I wanted to so badly. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and couldn't help myself." he admitted.

He wasn't just trying to flatter her, but indeed told the truth. He may as well spill his guts for her, since there was nothing more to lose.

"And all that mattered was you getting off, right? Didn't think about the harm it could do?" she rolled her eyes, though her tail swayed behind her at the compliment.

"I didn't. I never thought you would find out, but then my mouth wouldn't shut up, cause I'm fucking stupid. I always liked you and think you're the best teacher in this school. I'm not lying about that either. You're amazing. You don't deserve any of the shit you get and I'm truly sorry that I ended up being someone adding to it." he profusely apologized, ashamed of his actions and even more ashamed that he was still aroused.

"Is that all?" the lynx sighs.

If his apology had any effect, she was hiding it well.

"What do you want to hear? The cat's out of the bag, so we may as well get it all out." he exhaled, pleased that she at least seemed to have calmed down.

"If you have something to say, just say it. You're the one that needs to talk, not me. You're doing a good job already, so keep going." the lynx states, drumming her fingers over her desk.

"And I asked what it was you wanted to hear. I'm apologizing as much as I can." he lets out a breath, starting to feel calmer as well.

"Then keep going."

"Fine. I'm an idiot for not leaving it alone and just enjoying the things I've bought from you in private. I shouldn't have asked to stream it. I shouldn't have let myself get caught. I shouldn't have put your career in jeopardy, but I will say that this risk was always there on your part." the human continues, growing more bold.

Ms. Holt looks up at him, slightly irritated at his accusation, regardless of the truthfulness in it.

"Fair enough." she mumbles.

"There were errors in both our parts. Wearing the same shoes and socks you sell to school to name one. I will admit that the chances of one of the people watching you online to be a student was slim, but here we are." he nods, seeing as she didn't snap at him for his last statement.

"And you maybe shouldn't have been talking about them constantly. I've seen you staring at them, but didn't realize why." she fires back, though in a calm voice.

"I agree." he admits.

"Anything else you need to say?" Ms. Holt asks.

Bryce gazes at her from across the desk, feeling that she was prying for him to say something specific.

"Honestly?"

"Yes."

"One more thing."

"And what would that be?" she raises a brow, cupping her chin in her hand.

"I've never came as hard as I did when I was fucking your shoe with you watching. Nothing comes close. That orgasm alone almost, just almost, makes this worth it. And you know what? When I get home, I'm going to smell them and do it all over again. I know that makes me a hypocrite with everything I said, but I'm being honest." he pours it all out, blushing as he tells her his lewd plan.

Ms. Holt barely reacts to what he says at first, until she lets out a quiet snort.

"I could tell that much from what I watched." she sighs, crossing her legs.

"Now I want to hear you talk. Did you like what you watched?" Bryce asks, turning the tables on her.

Ms. Holt rolls her eyes and takes in a breath through her nose.

"Fine. It was a nice performance." the lynx huffs.

"What about all you said in the chat?"

"What about it?"

"What do you mean, 'what about it'? You said some really dirty things to me." he grins, finding that the atmosphere in the room had gotten more relaxed and honest.

"I don't recall." she lies, folding her arms.

"You said you wanted to see my cock and how nice you thought it looked. Said you wanted to suck it too." Bryce hums, smirking at her.

"Yeah, it's easy to get a guy going. Your kind is easy to manipulate." she taunts, crossing her legs.

"Oh, really? You didn't mean anything you said? I find that hard to believe." the human fires back.

"Believe what you want." she snorts.

"So, what, you're not going to tell me anything?"

"Maybe."

"I told you a lot, so give me something to hear."

"Why should I?"

"Cause we're being honest with each other!"

"Fine, shut up." the lynx shushes him from yelling, sitting up in her chair.

"Well?" he asks, waiting for an answer.

"Ugh, you're relentless. Fine. For a human and for someone your age, you kind of do have a nice cock." she grumbles.

"Yeah? Thank you." Bryce grins, laying his hand in his lap, giving his swollen member a discreet squeeze.

"Guys are all the same. Life is a dick measuring contest." the lynx taunts.

"And I just won one." he chuckles.

"What else?"

"How long have you been doing that stuff for?"

"Since college. The money was easy and plentiful. My friend told me about it and gave me the idea."

"Bless her heart. Do you think about your paws?" he asks, curious for the answer.

"Not really."

"Do you think they're nice?"

"I guess? They're just paws."

"They're more than that. They're big, furry, soft looking, and so fuckable." he huffs, visioning the pictures she had sent him.

"Whatever you say."

"Seriously. You should appreciate how sexy they are. Just like the rest of you. Love that muscular figure you have." he groans softly, telling her how he feels.

"Wasn't easy to achieve, but I do like my body."

"As you should. I smelled your socks so much and jerked off to those pictures you'd send in the packages. You're so fucking sexy." he grunts, growing harder in his jeans.

"I know you have. Someone forgetting all the messages they sent me about how they loved my packages?" she reminds.

"Oh yeah. Didn't know if you really read those."

"I do."

"Nice. Cool you actually watched the whole live stream too." he chuckles.

"Mhm. Was a fun watch. Moaning like a slut." she teases, remembering the show vividly.

"You bet I was. So good." he groaned to himself.

"Indeed. Anything else you need to ask?" the lynx huffs.

Bryce pauses and contemplates a particular question he wanted to ask, shifting in his chair.

"Well?"

"Y-yeah, I have a question."

"What?"

"....can I suck your toes?" he bites his lower lip, praying for a yes.

The lynx scoffed and paused for a bit, thinking over his request. Bryce stared at her with a barely audible whine of anticipation, praying for her to say yes. 

"And why should I let you do that?" 

"....um, I-I don't know."

"You really aren't making a good argument for yourself." she growls, lifting her legs and dropping them over her desk, the treaded soles of her running shoes facing him.

Bryce gulps at the new distraction presented in front of him.

"Okay, okay. Because I'm addicted to you. I never thought I'd be so happy to have sprained my ankle with everything it led to. Just being able to talk to you and get to know you. I was always excited to come to class as long as it meant interacting with you. Didn't matter if you were chewing me out or whatever else. There wasn't a single teacher I've ever had a crush on, except for you. Your attitude, aggression, body, voice, everything. I don't care how stupid or cliché this might sound, but you're a goddess to me and I want to worship you proper." the human softly growls, unable to contain himself once he saw her long legs and shoe covered paws dangling in front of him. 

After another moment of the teacher pondering her options, which seemed to last for an eternity, the teacher stood up out of her chair, making the short walk over to her office door, locking her door, before sitting back down.

"You have ten minutes." she states in her gruff tone, turning in her chair, extending her legs out in front of her, resting her heels on the floor.

The human rapidly nodded and threw himself to the floor, scrambling to kneel in front of her, feeling a rush of excitement that he hadn't experienced since he discovered who it was selling him their socks and shoes.

"Thank you! Thank you!" he pants, swiping his finger at her blue shoelaces, tugging them loose.

"Easy." she growls, lightly kicking at his hand.

"Yes, sorry!" Bryce apologizes, attempting to go at a more reserved pace.

He holds her foot by the ankle, lifting it up from the ground, clutching the heel of her running shoe with his free hand, where he then gave it a gentle tug, popping it free from her paw. 
Gulping, he pulls her shoe off of her paw, gazing at the familiar socks he'd been mailed, soon turning his eyes on the footwear in his hand.

"C-c-can....I..."

"It's nothing you haven't smelled before. Why should I let you?" Ms. Holt asks in a stern voice, not willing to let him have it his way without a fight or at least some humiliation.

"B-because...I love huffing your musky stink." he swallows, tightly holding the shoe, able to detect the scent wafting up from the opening of it.

"Only a pathetic shoe slut would do that. Are you a pathetic shoe slut?"

"Yes! Y-yes, I am." he nods, willing to say whatever she wanted to hear.

"Show me."

Bryce instantly throws the shoe to his nose, cramming it inside of the opening, flicking his eyes upwards to stare up at her as he loudly inhales the enslaving stink. The second he does, his eyes roll back with a strained groan as he got to experience them fresh off of her paws, the smell more magnified than he had ever had it. 

"Oh, god....does this please you?" he shivers, before stuffing his mouth into the shoe as well, sealing it around his face, trapping the heat and sweaty musk of her paws against him. 

"To see my student willingly huff my shoes after a day out on the track like the fucked up slut he is? Yes." she sneers, seemingly not affected by the display.

"That I am." he groans, pressing his tongue flat against the insole, his cock throbbing at the slight sting of her sweat tingling over his taste buds.

The lynx looks down at him in disgust, moving her leg over her knee, her socked sole facing towards him.

"Does the slut want my sweaty sock?" she taunts, curling her toes inside of the fabric.

"Yes, please. I want it all." he nods, giving that stuffy running shoe a few more licks and sniffs, sounding as if he was trying to breathe in every particle of the hot, sweaty paw stink held inside of the damp insole.

Bryce pulls his face free of the shoe, setting it to the side, before crawling forward towards the taunting paw. 

"Gimme your hands." she demands, reaching forward to him.

"Huh?" he murmurs, hypnotized by the paw of his dreams held in front of his face.

"Hands. Give me your fucking hands, goddamn it." she quietly snarls, beckoning with her fingers.

Confused, Bryce holds his arms out to her. Before he had a chance to react, the lynx takes his wrists in an iron grip, before kicking her socked foot forward, thrusting it against his face as she knocks him backwards. His surprised shout is muffled by the sole of her socked paw, crying out as the back of his head smacks the tiled floor of the office after he tumbles backwards.

"Quit bitching." the lynx grins, jerking his arms towards herself, while she pushes down harder with her foot.

He groans in pain and pleasure as the sweaty paw is crammed over his nose and mouth, unable to believe the amount of heat being expelled from her overworked foot.

"You want to do this, you do it my way. Now fucking sniff!" she barks, twisting her toes down against his nostrils.

Without a reply, Bryce lewdly inhales the indescribably wonderful and pungent scent, one of her toes pushing down over each nostril that flared with every breath he took. 

"Oh, fuck. I love your smelly paws." he exclaims around her sole that sat over his lips.

"Worship it." she hisses back, giving his arms another yank.

His lips trap a bundle of the sock into his mouth, sucking on the already moist fabric, savoring her flavor, before opening his mouth to thrust his tongue against the sole, dragging it over the smelly sock. Bryce laps against the sock, enjoying the texture of the fabric as it scraped over his tongue, alternating between licking and sucking at the black sock, until he did enough to properly please the lynx.

"Good bitch. I love seeing little fucks like you down on your knees, bowing to your real masters, giving a lady the proper respect she deserves. All those assholes and chauvinistic cocksuckers I have to deal with. Best way to get back at all of them. You all think you're so superior, but everyone of you turns into a slave if it means getting to cum. Fucking pathetic." she belittles the fragile human.  
Bryce blushes and grumbles at the insult, but he at least had some idea as to what she gained, aside from money, doing her naughty side work. Revenge, but one he was happy to be inflicted with. Much to his relief, she finally lets go of his arms that were threatening to be ripped from their sockets. With a grunt of pain, he curled his arms, still licking and sniffing that dirty sock.

"Get my other shoe off. Rub yourself with it." she orders, moving her other foot onto his chest.

"Yes. Anything you need Ms. Holt." he pants, still unable to properly speak with the heavy paw pinned to his face.

Blindly reaching, he pats over her shoe, until he finds the laces, tugging them, before popping off her snug fitting shoe. As per her instructions, he sensually rubs it over the tent raging inside of his jeans, pressing the rubber sole down harder over his concealed length with a moan. Until he heard otherwise, he didn't allow himself to pull his cock free and allow himself to once again rut her sweaty shoe. 

"How's that feel?" she huffs, watching him touch himself.

As he opened his mouth to answer, she curls her thick toes and forces the biggest into his maw, stuffing it full with the sock covered digit.

"On second thought, I think I know already after our last encounter. Now suck." she taunts, wiggling the toe around in his mouth.

Groaning, he opened his mouth further, tilting his head upwards to force more of the toe into his mouth, hungrily sucking on the fabric lined digit, wanting to rip it off to feel her soft fur over his tongue. He squirmed under her, grinding himself upwards against the shoe he clutched in his hands. 

"Let's see that cock again."

Bryce eagerly ripped his belt open, lifting up his hips so that he could throw his jeans down, his erection springing upwards as it was freed. The human lets out another pleasured vocalization once his rigid flesh presses over the discarded shoe he had on his lap.

"What are you going to do with that?" she teases, giving a quick thrust with her foot, her toe grazing at the back of his throat.

"Ack.....I-I want to fuck your shoe." he gags as the tip of her toe bats against his uvula. 

"Again? Fucking slut. Make that cock disappear." Ms. Holt hisses, now pumping her toe in and out of his mouth, dragging the sweat soaked fabric sock over his tongue.

He immediately flips the running shoe over and slides it over his cock, automatically bucking his hips, jamming his cock inside of it. The paw heated interior caresses the human's cock, which was now drooling pre over the insole, staining it, before she could let anyone else have a chance.

"You never want to fuck anything else, do you? You'd take my sweaty shoes over a tight cunt any day, wouldn't you, foot bitch?" the lynx taunts in a condescending voice.

"Nothing will ever feel as good, except for your bare paws." he moans around the smelly paw on his nose, kissing at the sock.

"You still haven't even seen them for real yet." the teacher hisses, finally pulling her paw off of his face.

"Can I? Please? Please, Miss....."

"Miss what?"

"Miss...tress." he gulps, looking up at her.

Caught off guard, the lynx cracked a brief smirk at the submissive human.

"Since you seem to know your place..." she purrs, bending down to grab the toe of her sock.

Bryce bites his lower lip and watches as she begins to slowly pull it up, gradually revealing more and more of the goddess-like foot that he'd been lusting over for ages. After the elastic cuff of the sock was pulled over her heel, the short plumage of extra fur popped free, the inch or two of white fur dangling off of her paw, matted with perspiration. As the sock was lifted higher and higher, he gazed at the alluring broad and muscular sole that was uncovered by the lynx, until it reached the underside of the bubble gum pink paw pad with black speckles. Before she could pull it off, the doorknob to her office jiggled, a silhouette of a someone visible behind the curtains.

"Fuck. Hide. Under there." she quickly instructs in a hushed tone, gesturing under her desk as she stood up.

With his heart pounding in his chest, Bryce slides under her desk, nervously gulping at the idea of getting her caught. He listens to Ms. Holt unlocking and opening the door to her office.

"Yes?" she asked as she pulled open the door, where a middle aged possum waited on the other side.

"Sorry if I'm disturbing ya, but I need to empty out your trash." he clears his throat, brushing his hands on the pant legs of his janitorial jumpsuit.

"Hey, John. No problem." she nods, walking back to sit down at her desk, picking up her trash can to set it down on the desktop.

"Thanks, Riley." the janitor smiles, pulling in a heavy, wheeled, plastic trash can.

Bryce quietly laid under her desk, listening to the conversation. Thankfully, there didn't seem to be any problem that would break up their private fun. The possum sighed and picked up her trash can, dumping out the contents into his, letting out a sigh as he set it back down on the ground.

"Long day?" the lynx asks, rolling her chair back up to her desk.

The human hiding underneath gulped once her now naked paws came back into view. He was already quite familiar with them from how many times he leered over the pictures of them she had sent, but seeing them with his own eyes was something new entirely. She had crossed them over top of one another, displaying her fluffy white soles. Bryce pulled himself up, sitting cross-legged in front of those paws. He cautiously picked the top one up and held it in front of his face, admiring the beauty of her rarely seen feet. Being this close, he could see every single piece of fur making up the tufts that poked up from between her toes and outlined her adorable paw pad. 

"Yeah. Some asshole keeps rewriting the same graffiti every time I scrub it clean in the bathroom. Fucker hit it again today." he huffed, giving his trash can an annoyed kick.

Bryce took his time staring at her paw, brushing his thumbs over the unbelievably soft fur covering her foot, letting out a breath as he trailed the fingers of his other hand over her sole, stopping at her big toes to give them a squeeze.

"Bastards. Guys or girls?" she asks, ignoring her guest that fondled her foot.

His face inched closer and closer to her foot, until he was close enough and could feel the heat radiating off of her enticing foot, now affectionately rubbing his cheek over her sole, holding in a moan as he touched them.

"Girl, actually. Writing about some old boyfriend that gave her some STD. Keeps writing it on the bathroom stall." he growls, pulling a broom out of his cart, starting to sweep up the dirt on her floor that was left behind from the track and field.

Bryce stroked and massaged that beautiful foot for a minute longer, before he was unable to control himself, pulling the foot closer as he dove his nose into her fluffy toes, taking in a long, audible inhale of her sweaty digits, letting out a groan that was mostly muffled by the fluffy soles pressed to his face.

"Fucking kids. High school drama never ends, I guess." the lynx replies, taking a quick glance down at the human.

"No pregnancy scare yet, so I don't know. Seems we're due for at least two girls with one." the possum chuckles, sweeping up around her desk.

Despite the approaching broom sweeping its way towards him, Bryce moves his nose between every gap of her toes, taking long, eager sniffs of the musky paw. For the first time, he was happy he had to run extra laps, seeing as she was running right behind him, her paws now fragrant, hot, and desperate for attention. His human nosed snuffled over her foot, diving it into her fur, moving up and down her sole and toes, pausing at every spot to take in a deep sniff of her fragrant foot, finishing each one off with a muffled groan, the scent being even more potent fresh from her paw. With one last sniff, he finally gave into his need and desire, biting his lip in hesitation, before he did as he asked earlier and thrust his head forward, sliding her big toe into his mouth, clamping his lips down around the digit, giving it a slow, loving suck, moaning around it, the furry toe muffling his moan.

"You'd think they'd be smarter after sex ed, but I guess not." Ms. Holt tries to casually reply, attempting to discreetly pull her foot away from the human.

Bryce kept a firm grip on her ankle, refusing to let his coach pull her foot away from him, finally able to indulge himself in her feet. His tongue firmly pressed to her toe, rhythmically rolling over the leathery pad, smearing the faint hint of sweat over his taste buds, shivering at the flavor, his cock throbbing with lust. He relished in the stinging tang of her fragrant taste, coiling his tongue around the glamorous toe, dipping between it to lap at the musky, sweaty fur trapped in the gap, suppressing another moan. Ms. Holt casually shifted in her seat, trying to yank her foot back, but couldn't with the small amount of strength she could use without gaining attention from the janitor, leaving her to the will of the horny human.

"I also have some brats that think it's cute to leave lipstick kisses on the mirrors in the bathroom. Assholes have no respect for who has to clean up their mess." he adds in a gruff tone, sweeping up a small pile of dust and petty litter, grabbing a dustpan off of his cart.

"Y-yeah, tell me about it. Try teaching a class full of them." the lynx chuckles, caught off guard by the almost ticklish licking and sucking the human gave her deceptively sensitive paw, still trying to tug it away from him, even kicking at him at times.

The human can't stop himself, keeping a tight grip on her foot, now using both hands, slowly dragging his tongue over her sole, pausing to suck on the excess fur dangling from her heels, feverishly worshiping the focus of his pent up arousal. 

"I remember an old story about a janitor that gathers up all the girls and shows them how he cleans up the mirrors, by dunking his rag in toilet water and wiping up the kiss marks. Scares them straight pretty quick." she chuckles, quickly glaring down at the human who was now stuffing his mouth full of her toes, popping each one individually into his maw, intensely suckling on her smelly digits.

"Huh. I might have to try that then!" he laughs, gathering the debris into his dustpan, disposing of it in the trash can.

Bryce dropped her saliva coated paw, picking up the other one, despite the silent protests by the lynx, stuffing it to his face, huffing the fresh, potent paw stench of her tired, aching feet. The human took her first two toes into his mouth, filling the entirety of it, drooling over them, while he sucked, digging his thumbs into her tense sole to massage it as he sucked his teacher's toes. A pair of feet like these, deserved all the worship in the world.

"Give it a try. Sounds like they could use a scare. No one appreciates the kind of work you guys do. You keep this school running and you deserve the faculty's thanks." she compliments, feeling the pain he went through, focusing on that, rather than the horny student that was nursing on her furry toes like a newborn.

The human gripped his meaty cock by its base, slapping his length over her sole after he spit her toes out of his mouth, hanging his head backwards in a silent cry as he finally felt that silken fur against his flesh. He panted, pulling back his foreskin, while he swept the sensitive tip of his cock along her foot, like a perverted paintbrush, leaving a faint trail of watery pre behind to soak into her fur. Bryce cradled her ankle in his hand, eyes locked on her sole, mouth agape as he dragged his cock over that beautiful, furry foot, pressing his tip into her fluffy toes, biting his lip with a hiss as the fur tickled his glans, before burying himself between those toes, carefully thrusting into them.

"Yup. Nice to hear someone say something like that for a change. You staying late?" he asks, soon noticing her discarded shoes beside her desk.

"Mhm. Just working out a lesson plan around the crappy weather we're supposed to get hit with next week." she lies, grabbing a binder on her desk, flipping it open to appear busy after doing nothing since he had entered her office.

"Looks like you're staying for a while. Kicking your shoes off, before you even get home." he jokes, grabbing a mop and spray bottle, spurting the cleaning solution onto the tiled floor.

Bryce gulped at the observation, as did the lynx.

"Yeah. Might as well relax a bit at the office. Almost done though. Probably going to order some takeout and relax. Usual Friday stuff." she clears her throat, mindlessly scribbling inside of her binder.

"Ah, my kind of night." the possum laughs as he mops the small office.

The human leans back against the side of her desk, holding her foot with both hands, bucking his hips into her toes that squeezed around his manhood, fucking the saliva coated digits, panting as he struggled to contain his moans.

"When you work like we do, a lazy night around the house is well earned." she chuckles back, lifting her other foot, laying it over the human's face, which was either going to silence his barely audible moans or make them louder instead.

The end result was both. Bryce moaned into her sole, placing his nose between her musky digits, his tongue lolled out to lick over her pad and arch, thrusting his cock against her other foot, leaking pre, which trickled down over the top of her foot.

"Yup. Might stop and get a six pack. Have a few brews and sleep in tomorrow." the janitor smirks, spritzing more of the bottle, mopping up the last corner of her office.

Bryce was in heaven. His godlike, dazzling, stunning teacher smothering his face with her potently scented foot, while she allowed him to fuck the other, making love to the fuzzy toes that gripped his cock. There was no way he could last longer. He thought back on all the times he rutted with her smelly socks and even her shoes, but nothing could compare to this. The way the fur covering her feet kissed his member, to how they smelled, strong, yet pleasant to the nose, and even how aggressive she was with how she trampled his face and abused him. Everything came together to make him wonder how he hadn't shot a load of cum the second she kicked him to the floor.

"I think I have half a bottle of wine left. Might pitch it and make a stop on the way home." she yawns, feigning exhaustion, though the dirty action occurring under her desk had her full attention.

"Good plan. Well, I have about fifty more rooms left to clean, so I won't bother you anymore." he chuckles, placing his mop back into his cart, pushing it out of the office.

"You're never a bother. Nice talking to you." she smiled at the possum, the lynx showing how she normally behaved when the students weren't around.

"You as well. Thanks for the laughs." he smiled back, closing the door.

The lynx listened to his footsteps descending down the hall, the smile on her face quickly devolving into a snarl.

"Having fun under there?" she hisses, giving his thigh a strong kick, looking under the desk.

"Ow! I'm sorry, I couldn't help it!" Bryce whines, the kick sending a wad of pre spitting from his cock and onto her toes.

"I couldn't help it! I couldn't help it! Gimme a fucking break!" she growls, shoving her paw forward, pinning his head to the side of her desk.

"Oh, god, yes. Kick me all you want. I won't regret anything I've done with you." he groans in pain and pleasure, now roughly thrusting into the toes of her other foot.

"You sicken me." she sneers, never letting him in on how he pleased her.

"Let me sicken you every day. After class, I'll worship these feet. Suck your toes. Massage them. Make them feel amazing." he pleads, loudly sniffing at the paw pinned to his face, sending more pre over her foot, staining her fur.

"You'd like that, wouldn't you? Hurry up and cum. I need to get home." she huffs, secretly onboard with his idea.

"Please, Ms. Holt. Use your immaculate, magnificent feet on me. Play with my cock. I want to paint your paws with my cum." he begs, attacking the paw on his face with his tongue.

Smirking, the lynx pulled her foot back, violently slamming her sole around his cock, sending a rush of sudden ache and satisfaction through his swollen manhood, desperate for a release.

"Yes!" he moans, picking up her shoe, shoving it back to his face, noisily sucking up all the stink and musk through his nostrils, going limp against her desk, completely to her will.

The lynx growls and starts to pump her feet over his cock, her heels thumping against his scrotum, her soles effortlessly covering his erection, smothering it with her hot, soft feet. She gripped his tip between her toes, violently squeezing it, while grinding the pawpad of her other foot up and down his shaft, feeling the pre bubbling from his cockslit to spill out between her digits.

Bryce's mouth hung open, heaving and almost weeping with pleasure, the lynx wiggling and shuffling her toes around his exposed glans during the breaks in between her nearly painfully tight squeezes of the overly sensitive mound of nerves. Bountiful amounts of his thin pre poured from his cockslit, saturating her thick, furry digits in the slippery fluid, earning another wave each time she squeezed his cock that threatened to burst. Her tail swept across the floor behind her, eagerly twitching as she glared at him with a malicious grin, imitating his moans in mockingly high pitched falsetto.

"Oh, yes. I'm a fucked up little foot bitch. I could ruin my teacher's career, but I don't care. Doesn't matter, as long as I get to cum. My limp, little human dick is going to make a mess all over her floor." she jeered at him, bouncing her leg, relentlessly jerking the slippery tip of his erection, while her other foot kneads and milks his shaft.

"I'm sorry, please! Please! I need it!" he prays, unable to even thrust into her angelic paws, now weakly huddled up against her desk, watching those delectable toes extorting him for his human seed.

"Oh? Do you need it? Jerking off with my socks and fucking my shoes isn't enough?" she growls, gripping his cockhead in a vice-like grip between her shockingly muscular toes, sealing his urethra shut.

"I said I was sorry! Oww! Please!" he yelps, whining in pain as her toes curled and jabbed at the underside of his tip with her claws.

"And? Does that mean you deserve to cum with my paws?" the lynx hisses, her foot doubling its speed, furiously stroking his shaft, feeling the blood rushing through his pulsating veins.

"Fuck! I'll do whatever you want! Any! Thing! I'll never speak to you again! I'll change schools! Anything! Just please, let me cum! You can fucking stomp me to death right here, I don't care! I'll die happy knowing I got to play with you like this." he cries out, now feebly kicking at her desk, scuffing the wood with the heels of his shoes.

Ms. Holt grinned at his words, taken back by how desperate the flailing human was acting. Wordlessly, she released her grip on his tip, opening his urethra and the floodgates from which his seed would instantly explode from. It was like she had uncorked a bottle of champagne for the amount of pressure and sheer volume that he ejaculated. With all of his energy spent on trying to keep his sanity in spite of the overwhelming and crippling pleasure that shook him to the core. Bryce could only manage a faint whimper as he began to tremble with his orgasm taking hold. Once her toes let go of his tip, a thick geyser of his semen spray from his cock, splattering against the human's right cheek, splashing off of his skin and sending droplets over his neck. The lynx kept his member held between her toes, the other foot violently grinding and stroking his shaft, keeping in tandem with the intensity of his climax. His erection shook and quaked in her grip, before releasing another hot cumshot that rocketed upwards and impacted against the underside of her desk with a splat, clinging to the wood. 

"God." he gasped, knees buckling with each climax, black spots littering his vision.

The strength of his creamy bursts started to weaken, replaced with weaker, yet, rapid waves of his semen, drowning her toes in his seed, which pooled off of her digits to leak over his shaft, until they reached her other paw, staining that one as well. The leftover dribbled down to leak into his underwear and pants, not that he was concerned. Those luscious furry feet caressed and teased his member, switching from her aggressive and dominating movements to a more gentle and affectionate stroking as his orgasm lessened, much to his surprise. Bryce bit down on his lip, hard enough to taste the metallic tang of his blood as he broke the skin, feeling a second wind that ended up with one last impressive outburst of his sticky load that flew into the air, before heavily dropping over the lynx's paws, managing to hit her ankle as well.

"Th.....th-thank you. Thank you so much, Ms. Holt." he gasped, sliding down the inner wall of her desk, until he was a crumpled up ball at her feet.

She moved her chair back, examining the aftermath of his release on her fluffy paws, seeing the rich white seed lashed across the smoky grey tops of her feet, flexing her toes to feel the heated cum sticking to her fur. The lynx held her feet up above the ground to avoid contact as she wheeled back in her chair to pick up a roll of paper towels she kept in a cabinet behind her, usually used to clean the windows and picture frames she had in her office. Tearing off a sheet, she leaned down to wipe off what she could off of her paws.

"Wait." Bryce panted, stopping her before she had the chance.

She looked up at him with a confused expression. The human crawled out from under her desk, his flaccid and shrunken member dangling from his opened fly. Kneeling in front of them, he pulled out his smartphone and opened up the camera, glancing up at her as if he was looking for her permission. Rolling her eyes, she nodded with a sigh. Smiling, he held the phone in front of her paws, snapping a quick series of pictures at different angles, capturing the memory of her entrancing, divine feet that were now decorated with his fresh, pent up semen. 

"Happy now?" the lynx rumbled, splaying her toes, letting him take a picture of the human milk clinging between her digits.

"Mmmm." he smiles with a dreaming look in his eyes, snapping one last picture of the lynx's stained toes.

"Good." she curtly replies, before wiping off the mess from her paws with the paper towel.

Bryce stood back up and brushed off his pants, rubbing in the globs of cum that accidently landed on his jeans. While she was wiping up her feet, the human awkwardly stood there, not sure of what to do, only the remnants of his euphoric climax tingling his nerves.

"What?" she asked, not bothering to look up at him.

After their spontaneous and aggressively risqué quickie finished, all that remained was the same tension and shaky uncertainty of their futures the two had been feeling before. 

"Uh.....what now?" he replies, staring at those paws as she cleaned them up.

"Leave." the lynx shrugged, tossing the balled up paper towel into her waste bin, before tearing off another sheet from the roll.    

"Just like that?" Bryce asked, fidgeting as he stood there.

"Yup." she nods, flossing between her toes with the paper towel, making sure there wasn't a trace of his semen on her.

"What about tomorrow? I mean, where do we go from here?"

"Tomorrow isn't any different from today. This never happened and if I find those pictures online, I'll hurt you in a way that will make you useless to a woman. Understand me?" she threatens, snapping her gaze back up at him.

"Of course! This will stay a secret between us, I swear. I'm not that stupid." he holds up his hands in innocence.

"Good. With this out of the way, I'm assuming you'll be able to act normal around me again?" she huffs, slipping her shoes back on, not bothering to pull her socks back on.

"I believe so. This....really helped. This was one of the best moments of my life." he chuckles, pulling out his phone to check the pictures he had taken.

"Quit being sappy. I can't stand it. Go back to fearing and respecting me." she groaned in annoyance, tossing another wadded up ball of paper towel into the trashcan, standing back up.

"Aww, shit!" Bryce grunts, staring at his phone.

As he went back to double check the photos, he saw a series of missed calls and texts from his mother.

"Problems?" the lynx asks, unlocking the door to her office.

"Yeah. We've been in here for an hour and my mom is parked outside!" he panics, starting to dial her back.

"Don't bother." Ms. Holt interjects, slapping his hand away from his phone. 

"But-"

"No buts. Get your shit and get out." she orders, pointing to his backpack, opening up the door to her office.

Bryce nods and grabs his bag, slipping it over his arm, stepping out with her following behind. The duo walks in silence through the deserted halls, luckily the janitor wasn't anywhere to be found as well. Ms. Holt didn't show any emotion nor hostility as she walked in front of him, her tail motionless aside from the bobs from every step she took. 

"I hope my ankle gets better soon. Damn thing is still killing me." he clears his throat, breaking the silence.

"Enough talk." she rudely silences him.

Bryce blushed, his heart sinking a bit at her behavior, but he nods, not like she could see it anyway. After two more minutes of agonizing silence, they reached the front entrance of the school.

"There she is." he worriedly sighs, seeing his mom's car parked out front.

Ms. Holt says nothing, but pushes open the doors, holding them open for him. 

"Thanks." he sheepishly nods, receiving a blank look and silence in return from her.

As he walks out, the mother takes notice and starts the engine, driving the short gap across the parking lot, stopping in front of the steps leading to the entrance. Bryce hobbles forward, almost jumping from his skin when the lynx steps beside him, putting an arm around his waist and his arm over her shoulder as he reached the steps.

"Carefully, now." she instructs, loud enough for his mother to hear through the open driver's side window.

"U-uh, thanks?" he nods, leaning against her for support as they both walk down the steps together.

"Sure thing." Ms. Holt replies with a smirk, letting go of him, but staying close as they step off of the steps.

Bryce limps to the car with the teacher following closely behind, his mother rolling down the window of the passenger side, looking over at the two.

"Where have you been? I was worried sick!" the mother asks, scared he may have been hurt.

"Uh..." Bryce starts to speak as he pulls the car door open.

"Hi there. You must be Bryce's mother? I'm his gym teacher, Ms. Holt." the lynx introduces herself with a smile, helping the human crawl into the car, grabbing his backpack and zipping up an open pocket that went unnoticed.

"Um, hello. Nice to meet you." the mother waves, glaring at Bryce.

"I'm sorry for the worry. It was my fault he was late. He came to me after class to ask for help about dealing his injury. I was teaching him about how to stretch it out, ice it, wrap it, and things like that. I've been around the block a few times and I'm no stranger to those kind of sprains. I didn't realize how late it had gotten. I make my students silence their phones, so he didn't know you were calling. Again, I apologize." the lynx frowns, shutting the door and standing in front of the open window.

"Oh. I suppose that's alright then, but I was still worried sick. I thought he may have gotten hurt or the bus broke down and he had to walk home." the mother lets out a breath, patting him on the leg.

"Again, I'm very sorry for any trouble. I was going to offer him a ride home, until he saw that you called." Ms. Holt nods, resting her arms on the door.

"It's okay. Just happy that everything is okay. Didn't want another trip to the ER." the mother jokes, the car rumbling as it idled.

"We wouldn't want that. That's why I'm trying to help out Bryce. He needs to make sure he exercises his ankle, even when it's like this. Otherwise, his range-of-motion and strength is going to be deteriorated when his ankle heals. Five times a day should be fine. There's plenty of guides online too. Just be sure to ice up afterwards." she instructs, looking over to Bryce.

"U-uh huh. Thank you for your help." he swallows, briefly making eye contact with her.

"I appreciate you helping him out like this. He's been really down in the dumps since he got hurt. Hasn't been able to work either. Been spending most of his time on the computer, watching TV, or going through boxes of trading cards he's been getting in the mail." the mother smiles at the teacher she'd never met until now.

Bryce freezes and feels his cheeks flush at his mother's words. The lynx smirks and turns to face him, seeing his cheeks reddened.

"Cards, huh?" Ms. Holt asks, tilting her head slightly.

"Mhm. Real nice ones." he gulps, forcing himself to meet her gaze.

"I bet." the lynx grins, returning to look across to his mother.

"You've raised a wonderful son. Bryce is one of my favorite students. Always respectful and tries his hardest every class. The others could learn a lot from him." she smiles, reaching over him towards the mother for a handshake.

"Really? Well, thank you very much. His father will happy to hear it too." the mother smiles back, giving the furry hand a shake and squeeze.

"Well, I won't keep him any longer. Apologies again, ma'am. Have a safe day and don't forget to stretch out your ankle, Bryce." Ms. Holt states, stepping back from the car.

"Enjoy the rest of your day too. Nice meeting you." the mother waves, shifting back into drive.

The lynx waves back, walking backwards back onto the sidewalk, watching them depart. Bryce looks over to see the smile melting from her muzzle. She returns to her usual stern expression, locking eyes with him, glaring at him as she raised her finger in front of her lips, reminding him to keep his mouth shut. He nods, just before the car pulls away. 

"She seems nice." the mother comments, rolling their windows back up.

"She is after you get to know her. Can be a bit of a hard ass too."

"Bryce!"

--------------

The car crawls to a stop as they pull into the driveway, the human staring out the window the entire ride over, contemplating the events that transpired today.

"Daydreaming?" the mother asks, shutting off the engine, unlatching her seatbelt.

"Something like that." he muttered, pulling off the seatbelt and popping open the door.

She gets out and locks the car up, seeing as she didn't need to go back out for groceries today. The mother walks up to the porch and unlocks the door, turning back to see her son grabbing his backpack and walking up behind her, not limping as much as he had a week earlier.

"You do seem to be getting better. Just do what your teacher said." she says, opening the front door.

"Yup." he nods, walking in with her, carefully pulling his shoes off.

Bryce walks down the hallway, backpack slung over his shoulder.

"Gotta type up an essay." he announces, shuffling into his room.

"Alright. Dinner will be ready in an hour or so." the mother states, pulling open the refrigerator to pull out a bag of chicken she had marinating overnight. 

Shutting the door behind him, Bryce walks over to his desk and collapses into his chair with a long exhale, closing his eyes. He thought over everything that just happened with him and the lynx. Did she hate him? Was everything just a way to bribe him into keeping his mouth shut? Is that the only reason she let him do all of that to her? He didn't know. She seemed to have some sort of enjoyment out of how she tormented him under her desk. The way she edged him and tortured his cock. Was that just her getting revenge on him for the situation he put her into? The more he mulled over it, the more questions he had. She did cover for him and put on a show for his mother, but again, that was probably just to cover her own ass without a care for his.

He groaned and opened his eyes, staring up at the ceiling, rubbing his palms into his sockets to clear his mind. Shaking his head, he shook his computer mouse, waking up the desktop and clearing the screensaver. Though he only wanted some alone time, he did indeed have an essay to work on. Maybe it'll at least take his mind off of things. After finding a suitable background song to listen to, he picked up his backpack and set it down on his desk, unzipping one of the compartments to pull out his school folder. He fished out the assignment guidelines for the paper he needed to write and realized he needed his English textbook as well. Pulling down the zipper for the other compartment, he pulled it open to grab his book, but found something else inside as well. 

"What the fuck." he said aloud.

Shocked, he reached inside his backpack and pulled out the same pair of socks Ms. Holt wore today, nestled against his books, still warm even after she took them off in her office over an hour earlier. He didn't even notice her shoving them inside of his bag.

"That sneaky feline." he chuckles, shaking his head in disbelief.

Glancing over at his door, he listened to hear his mother still in the kitchen, pots and pans banging. Bryce smirked and lifted one of those sweat socks to his nose, taking in the familiar, but still intoxicating scent of those paws with a soft moan. 

Maybe she didn't hate him after all.

"The essay can wait." he groaned, standing back up to lock his door once again.
