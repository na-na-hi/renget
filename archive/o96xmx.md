Summarized for (You) into:
>Type (Damage, QoL, Team Damage for amps) - Value (Low, Moderate, High), If it gives more damage than qol it's damage>qol
>Does it change the characters playstyle? How?
>Does it change the characters role?
>Priority? Based on cost opportunity, ideally you'd drop $4k per patch and S+ everyone anyways
>For unreleased characters in global: I'm adding a sort of tldr of the character kit or how you play it, to give you an idea of what the rankups affect and how.
> Notes if applicable
Modifier values kept to a minimum to avoid even more clutter, if you need specifics feel free to visit [GRAY RAVENS](https://grayravens.com/wiki/GRAY_RAVENS), whose chibis I'm hotlinking too lmao

!!! note Notes:
	
The toolkit descriptions marked affect "Annihilation Leap"
The Oodachi slam is actually divided into 2 parts:
- the part where she jumps (Annihilation Leap)
- then the dunk itself (Fulmination Strike) 

Since you can't cancel out of the jump in any instance, any increases to the jump part are pretty much an increase to the dunk as a whole.
Why is it divided if you can't even do just the jump? No idea, but the motherfucker who had the brilliant idea to divide it should be hamstrung and forced to experience /bag/'s scatposter for a year.



#->No.21: Feral Scent<-
->![schizowomanletdogthingSEXNOWLICKLICKLICKLICK](https://i.imgur.com/OxvLMPD.png)<-

As a disclaimer, No.21 is pretty fucking strong as main dps, but not as strong as alpha would be.

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
>[3 Ping > Ping orbs during The first orb animation once, refreshes on ult > Press atk at a certain point in her orb animation] > {3-Ping > Press atk at a certain point in her orb animation} > (Hold atk to schizo slash, this gives stacks up to 100) > Ult (Uses stacks for damage) >Back to step 1
I'll refer to the shit in square brackets [] as "Core 1", the shit in curly brackets {} as "Core 2" and the hold atk schizo slashing as "Core 3" for clarity's sake... I hope.
So basically
> Core 1 > Core 2 > Core 3 > Ult >Back to step 1
It's worth noting that any damage modifiers to Core 2 also affect Core 1 but not the other way around, this is because Core 1 is actually a field effect separate from the Signal Orb and Core 2 animations. I hope that made sense.

Why is this character so fucking complicated in paper when it's the most gorilla shit in practice, I hate it.

#->~~Cecilie and her hitbox~~<-
#->Alisa: Echo<-
->![Canon bugs you during work meetings](https://i.imgur.com/IHy8yIs.png)<-

As a disclaimer, Alisa is pretty strong as as a damage dealer, but nowhere near Bianca.

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
>Hold atk > Ping the special orbs > Enter Core Zone > Ping orbs to fill Core Gauge > Full Core Gauge: Ping a single orb matching color with a special orb (Combo Atk 1) > Ult (this gives a mark) > If still on Core Zone, ping a single orb to Combo Atk 2 > Back to step 1 (you'll most likely switch out though, fucking orb hungry bitch)

When you ping special orbs they get put on top of the normal ones, like Bianca's. These orbs are used by Cecilie (the stand) to attack, and are used for both Combo Atks.
Cecilie also stays behind if you had special orbs left over when switching out of Alisa, and she'll attack shit, one of her attacks heals the fielded character.

Remember you can use BP toilet paper for Alisa shards.

#->Lamia: Lost Lullaby<-
->![SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX Thanks for Killing Coco](https://i.imgur.com/CLSxRp5.png)<-

Oh boy another essay character that's gorilla in practice, let's break down her kit.
So lamia has:
- 2 forms: "Legs" and "Tail", I'll refer to them as such for the rest of the section
- Core stacks (a little number above your gauge): This is used when in Tail
- A Core Gauge: Divided into 2 sections when Legs, 3 sections when in Tail
- FIVE fucking special orbs: 2 in Legs, 3 in Tail
- Two field effects: Both in Legs

You fill the Core gauge by pinging orbs, and get a special orb whenever a section is filled, if you didn't use the special orb and fill another section, it becomes the next special orb, therefore
>Legs: Half the gauge gives you "Orb 1", The other half converts it to "Orb 2" (QTE fills this gauge and gives her special orbs accordingly)
>Tail: 1/3 gauge gives you "Orb 3", 2/3 gauge gives you "Orb 4", 3/3 gives you "Orb 5"
You can't convert special orbs to the next one if the gauge is full, you gotta use that orb and it will deplete the gauge.

The field effects are Downpour and Tempest, and their only real purpose is to do shit for Lamia when she uses her Ult to change forms and give a bonus on SSS. Anyways "Downpour" gives lamia a 3 ping when changing forms and "Tempest" gives her 2 instead.
You activate "Downpour" when pinging [Orb 1], and "Tempest" when pinging either two [Orb 1]s or one [Orb 2]

The core stacks get filled by every orb you ping, normal (only 3 pings) or special, and are consumed when tapping normal attack after pinging orbs in Tail or when holding attack in Tail (this one does more damage based on stacks and has iframes)

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
> Do 2 fucking 3 pings > Ping the Orb 2 to get "Tempest" > Ult > Ping the shit out of your orbs to get to Orb 5 asap > Use Orb 5 > Hold atk > Ult > back to step 1 or switch out
Don't switch out during Tail, lamia will go back to Legs when you swap back in.
Again, emasculate the piece of shit that made the tooltips

Can tank, can dps they barely held back on giving him amplifier passives and heals and the patch still sold like shit... uncle...

His kit is relatively simple and the rank ups are as well, the details we need are that:
- Ult mode can only use reds, all blue/yellow are converted on ult use
- Has 2 types of red orbs (Normal and "Blaze"), both parry
- Blaze Orb maxes at 3, excess converted to normal reds or other color
- Blaze Orbs give stacks that increase Ult Finisher damage
- 3-Pings and Matrix trigger give him bullets (has a max of 3)
- Bullets get used up on normal attack and give him a Blaze orb per bullet used (if Blaze orbs are maxed bullets don't get used up)
- His QTE/Entry gives a bullet, but not Blaze orbs (QTE/Entry is yellow orb)
- Proccing his QTE multiple times only gives a bullet and energy once, it refreshes when you swap into him. Shares lockout with Entry in 3-Ping.
- Has a charge atk in ult that uses 3 bullets

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
> Enter Ult Mode > 3-Ping for bullets > Use bullets to get Blaze Orbs > Spam Blaze orbs > Use your Ult Finisher > Repeat
It's better to switch into or proc his QTE than start the fight with him, as these give enough energy to enter first ult instantly
Because of energy and orb constraints you don't get to use the charge attack much at base S, SS and Signature lets you actually use it without bombing your flow.

SSS+ | Blaze Orb damage increased | Damage - Moderate | No | No | Poor Opportunity Cost

!!! note Notes: 
On SS
- Wata's Ults cost 15 and 100 energy each to use
- You run cottie on him which lowers them to 12 and 80
- The energy gain increase from cottie will result in around 14 energy per 3-Ping/QTE/Blaze Orb and 5 Per bullet used
- Going through three 3-Pings for bullets, 3 bullets for Blaze orbs and 3 Blaze orbs results in a total of 99 energy. 85 if we triggered matrix and got a "free" Blaze orb.
Based on this the SS upgrade won't make your first ult faster, instead it lets you do a second rotation before running out of juice, granted that you have the Signature weapon, otherwise you'll be fully out juice by the time you're done with the first rotation (even with ultima awaken).

FINALLY

Essay to gorilla:

- When she enters Matrix she has a special state for 4 seconds (移晷) , there's no visual indicator of this. Since it's used in her kit we refer to it as Shift Time (if there's a better wording let me know PLEASE)
![Core](https://i.imgur.com/WE29vt6.png)
- You enter Core Mode by Pinging any additional orbs during a 3 Ping, and it gives you a feather
- The sword meter drains when you enter Core Mode 
- 3-Pings give Feathers (max 3), if you basic atk after a 3-Ping Qu does an Empowered Basic Atk.
- Holding Atk without 3 feathers does a special attack (gonna call this Combo 1), this has increased damage the first time you use it per core mode
- 3 Feathers get used on Hold Attack (Combo 2) or Hold Dodge and become Diamonds
- Hold Dodge gives her 2 Ult stacks per 3-Ping during stairs instead of 1 (Can only be used during Shift Time)
- Hold Atk doubles the damage increase to Chair per stack you get during stairs
- These two don't stack normally
- Ult has 2 parts
- First part is when she climbs the stairs, all diamonds become 3-Pings, 3 Pings become stacks, Max 4. (Referring to it as Ult 1)
- The 2nd part is when she sits on the chair, all stacks gained increase its base damage (can be cast as soon as she starts climbing the stairs). This will be Ult 2

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
> 3-Ping > Ping another orb (any number works) to enter Core Mode > Hold Atk for Combo 1 > Weave 3-Ping and Basic Atk until 3 Feathers > Hold Atk for Combo 2 > Ult > 3 Ping on stairs > Repeat

If you have the Signature weapon, you can weave Hold Atk and Combo 2 and essentially never run low on orbs, even better with deadline timing.

- 3 forms (Base, "Main sequence" and "Final Sequence")
- Only yellows on base form
- Blues and Reds during Main and Final
- Orbs and hold atk build up number stack
- tap ult enters main sequence and hold ult enters final
- 3 different hold atks (one exclusive to Base form, 2 during both ult forms, referring to them as hold 2 and hold 3)
- Tap ult (Main Sequence) keeps orbs and gauge 1, when it fills you do Hold 2 to swap into Gauge 2 and fill it to do Hold 3 (some chinks call this rasengan for some reason), then it swaps back and you can repeat. Ult dmg scales on number stacks.
- Hold ult (Final Sequence) eats all your orbs and gives number stacks based on orbs consumed, puts you in Gauge 2 immediately and Hold 3 damage scales on number stacks, can only use Hold 3 once, gets 1 special orb per basic atk.
- If you would get hit when holding atk luna will dodge automatically, consumes dodgebar

![Core](https://i.imgur.com/GixBVu5.png) Gauge 2 (exclusive for Hold 3)

!!! info Normal Playstyle:
> 3-Ping/Hold Atk until core passive gauge is full and release > Ult when you can >
> If Main Sequence (tap) then: build up gauge with orbs/atk/hold 2 > Hold 2 to change to Gauge 2 > build up gauge with orbs/atks/hold atk > Hold 3 > Ult finisher
> If Final Sequence (hold) then: Hold 3 > use orbs or some shit if you want but you might as well ult asap then go back to step 1
Final sequence damage is frontloaded into it's activation cast and hold 3, good for burst, Main Sequence damage is technically spread more evenly and is more orb friendly (backloaded to ult finisher)
