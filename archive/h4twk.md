The pot simmered cheerfully over the low heat, the delightful smell of pork broth wafting through the room. On the table, already set, were plates overflowing with fried rice, tempura shrimp, and vegetable fritters.

Kanata leaned over the ramen, blinking away the steam as she stirred the noodles. "Is this done, Neko-chan?" she asked hesitantly. "I think it's done..."

Mikeneko stood from her seat at the table and walked up to the stove, standing close to Kanata as she took a look. The blue-haired girl blushed a faint pink as their shoulders brushed close. "Yep! It's done, Kanata!" Mikeneko's voice still had the same cheerful, high-pitched affectation Kanata once remembered - even after all that happened, and after a whole year of organized crime. "I don't know why you say you're bad at cooking, you followed my instructions to the letter here..."

"Yeah... your instructions," Kanata stressed as Mikeneko turned off the stove.

"Your hands did the work. That counts." Neko replied. She turned to Kanata, her eyes lingering tenderly on the scar on her left cheek - a reminder of the brush with death that had started this whole saga. "I bet Anon's going to love this, even with how much he complains about Japanese food, the jerk."

Kanata felt a knot form in her throat. She stepped forward, clasping Neko's hands with her own, smiling as she blinked away a tear. "I'm glad you're with us, Ru- I mean, Neko-chan."

Mikeneko bit her lower lip, trembling. If Kanata had to fight back some emotion, then all of a sudden it looked like Neko was bending the entirety of her will to avoid bursting into tears. "I'm glad you and Coco could stay with us too, Kanata... hey, we're winning, you now? We're killing everybody who ever wronged us, and we're going to kill the rest too, OK? Then we're going to be rich again, and you and Coco-san can buy that house you wanted, and Anon and I can get our own place too, and we can visit each other every day and-"

The sharp ring of a doorbell cut through Mikeneko's utopic waxing about their future, halting her mid-sentence as the temperature in the room dropped by a couple degrees.

"Anon wouldn't ring the doorbell," Kanata said, letting go of Neko's hands.

"No. Let... let me go check. You're carrying, right? I am too."

Kanata nodded, her expression grim as Mikeneko strode forward and checked through the peephole. Just a year ago merely thinking of the level of danger they were in might have made her sick - now it was routine, no, unimportant after all their triumphs.

"It's... it's Mori," Mikeneko murmured. "What's she doing here?"

"Calliope-san?" Kanata exhaled in relief. "Um, now she's an informant, Coco-chan told her to drop off her files here. She could have just left them in the mailbox though..."

"No, I think it's better this way. Less chance something might go wrong or get lost. Um, coming!" Mikeneko fumbled with the locks for a bit and then slid them back. The door swung open, and Calliope Mori, clearly more than a bit drunk, stumbled into the safehouse, holding a crumpled brown folder full of stained pages. She walked by both Neko and Kanata, ignoring them until she collapsed on top of a chair.

"Yooooo. It's ya boy, Calliope Mori, bitcheeesss... long time no see, Rushia." Her eyes were rather unfocused, darting back and forth across the room, lingering only on the food and drink arrayed on the table. She completely missed the expression of sheer rage that briefly crossed Mikeneko's face. Kanata slipping and calling her that was one thing - she could call her much worse after all she'd done for Neko. But this fat cunt? She struggled to tamp down her emotions.

Kanata on the other hand did notice, and rushed to take the spotlight off of Neko by drawing Mori's attention away from her. "Calliope-san... hello! It's uh, it's been a long time. Did you bring the files?"

Mori blinked in confusion, leering at her for a bit before her eyes widened as she caught on. "Holy shit, Kanata-senpai! I didn't know you'd be here... been a long time... oh shit, oh fuck!" She leaned forward, looking at the scar under Kanata's left eye like she was gazing at a zoo animal. "Oh fuck, you got fucking mutilated!"

All the air left the room. Kanata drew back as though she'd been punched in the face. "It... it's not that bad," she whispered, trembling.

Now behind Mori, Mikeneko's hands balled up into fists, her knuckles clenched chalk white. "Just drop off the files and leave, Mori," she hissed.

Mori turned to look at her, slapping the stained folder down on a plate of fried rice with a greasy plop. "Whoa hey, Rushia, watch your mouth. Just because I'm giving you valuable information doesn't mean I'm your bitch, dog. Coco promised me I could have Hololive's music rights once she got rid of the other bitches, she didn't say anything about having to suck her crew's dicks. Uh, cunts. So you two better have some respect, or I might just uh, I might just change my mind and rat you guys out, OK?"

"What the fuck did you just say?" Kanata's voice was ice-cold, her trembling uncertainty gone in an instant, her eyes as dead and sharp as when she whacked Suisei.

Mori raised her hands. "Hey, peace. I'm just breaking balls, come on."

"We don't joke around with that shit, Mori," Neko growled. "Just leave the fucking folder on the table and get out."

"Alright, alright, sure bitch, don't get uppity with ya boy, I'm leaving now!" Mori made to stand up, but then stopped. Her expression wavered, her eyes hazy as her better judgment briefly fought and lost one final war against whatever drug she'd taken. Then she gave the other two girls a cruel, drunken grin. "Although... I wonder what they'd give me if I handed in Coco's cunt... or that Anon guy you two are always with... think they'd cut Kanata up a bit more so her right side would mat-"

"YOU FUCKING CUNT!"

Drunk and stupid, Mori had no time to react as Mikeneko grabbed a bowl of fried rice and smashed it on top of her head. Shards of glass flew everywhere, mixed with grains of rice, chopped vegetables and bits of blood and hair. Mori stumbled out of her chair, bleeding from her forehead. Her eyes bulging with adrenaline, she lunged towards the first person she saw, roaring obscenities at Kanata. Neko sprung into action, holding on to Mori from behind, her hands clasping at the taller woman's neck and leaving a bloody trail with her nails.

"KILL HER KANATA! KILL THIS CUNT! GUT HER FAT ASS!"

Mori's backbone disappeared as Neko screamed this and her expression turned to terror as Kanata grabbed the butcher's knife she'd used to chop up the pork for the ramen. "Ack... K-Kanata, no- AUUUGH!"

Maybe in a past life Kanata may have showed Mori mercy, but in this awful present her eyes were wide with demonic fervor, her blood boiling in rage and sorrow at even the thought that Anon, Neko, or Coco could be sold out by this bitch. She held tightly onto the knife and rammed it once, twice, thrice into Mori's fat gut.

"AUUGH! AUUGH!" Each stab of the knife drew from Mori a whooping, almost cartoonish scream of pain. She tried to say something but only blood and spit came out of her mouth. Her arms flailed, and in one last burst of adrenaline she shook Mikeneko off her back, the catgirl landing painfully on her butt.

"Kanata!" Neko screamed past a grimace of pain. "Don't let her get away!"

She didn't. Kanata lunged forward mustering all the strength her tiny body could handle and tackled Mori, driving the huge knife into her gut again. The impact sent Mori reeling, and she fell on her back onto the dinner table with Kanata on top of her, plates of food flying everywhere. Kanata wasted no time as Neko rushed to her feet and pinned Mori's arms to the table. Lifting up the knife, she brought it down on her victim again and again, stabbing into Mori's gut, ribcage, even her fat tits, until her torso looked like a piece of ground meat.

"AUUGH! AUUGH! AUHGHhghghghghghghg..."

"She's... she's dead, Kanata," Neko murmured, letting go of Mori's arms. "You can... you can stop now."

Kanata nodded in agreement, but just in case she stabbed her knife three more times into Mori's left tit, until she was satisfied she wouldn't get a response. "Fuck... fuck... fuck... Neko-chan... sorry for swearing back there... dinner is ruined..."

She looked around, breathing heavily. The room looked like an abattoir, both she and Mikeneko were covered in Mori's blood and gore.

"Dinner..." Neko whispered. "Yeah, yeah she ruined our dinner. The dinner you cooked for us, Kanata-chan... fuck..." She took a step back from Mori's body.

"We killed her," Kanata murmured.

"Yeah, we did..."

"We probably shouldn't have..."

"No, we shouldn't have... Coco-san and Anon are going to lose it when they find out..."

"Worth... worth it." Kanata looked at Mikeneko and grinned. Her bloodstained hands were trembling, but her expression was that of a young girl smiling at her sister after they both got away with a prank. Neko returned the smile, and before long Kanata had dropped the knife and the two were giggling away, pale hands intertwined in a moment of tender bonding as Mori's brutalized body cooled on the table next to them.
