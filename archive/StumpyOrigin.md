Stumpy never knew his mother or his father, both of whom were Brelooms. His mother died while birthing and nurturing him and his father had run off like any young and irresponsible father would, leaving a wise old lady Breloom named Cybil to take care of him. Cybil herself isn't related to Stumpy, but she always called him by his real name, and Stumpy always called her his gran. Cybil is the reason he speaks in such an unusual English dialect, which came from Cybil's trainer who passed away long before Stumpy was born. Cybil and Stumpy shared many cherished moments and cared deeply for each other. Stumpy was close to his gran till the day she passed away, and he stayed by her until her final moments, which he took extremely hard. No one loved Cybil more than Stumpy did, and all the other Pokémon in the forests that knew them knew it. The other Breloom took to giving her a proper burial and escorted Stumpy back home, and he was willed her lovely blue scarf that he now wears on his head. 

Stumpy, as his name suggests, was a runt among his fellow Shroomish, so the usual sorts of things would happen to him, and the nickname "Stumpy" stuck to the point that no one called him by his real name, though he eventually came around to liking it and wearing it on his imaginary sleeve. With no one left to guide him, in a depressed slump, and while other Pokémon had become more and more hostile around his home, he fled, becoming little more than a heavy-accented wanderer as he traveled to the coast and, eventually, a settlement called Capim Town. 

In Capim Town, he learned about the ways of explorers, rescuers, expeditioners, and the like, but didn't think much of it. He took a real liking to life by the sea, and eventually found himself working in a brewery that was outside of Capim Town (it's part of Capim Town today) when Capim remained "dry" and free of alcohol, where he quickly crafted a well-known mushroom beer known as Little Andrew's, (Andy's for short). He makes a modest amount of royalties from its sale to this day given his real name and his likeness is on every jar. Despite his successes, he grew bored of the job and stepped down from his position in the company four years later, looking for a thrill while still on the payroll as a salesman. 

He would find one as a seafarer, traveling to the Sand Continent and back. While there, he was shocked by how many Pokémon knew him. It turned out that Little Andrew's was extremely popular in the small oasis resort of Sahra Town, and he would help build a small brewery house there that makes Little Andrew's before heading back home to Capim Town. He still keeps in touch with friends there, especially the Golurk that made building the brewery possible. Stumpy himself said those days were among the best days of his life, and takes vacations to Sahra Town to keep up appearances with the natives and resort goers.

Eventually, his seafaring life would take him to the Clover Guild, where he had confused the place for a pub. Overhearing the talks of exploring and adventures, he's stayed put and has more or less become an unofficial official member of the guild, if for no other reason than Totodile wanting another drinking buddy and Cyndaquil wanting another wingman.

Stumpy has a morbid fear of dying and of large, dangerous things that could kill him easily. Such things include the teeth, mouths, claws, and feet of larger Pokémon, and it also includes a fear of fire and ice. Stumpy is a naturally timid and worried Pokémon who has a deep sense of self-doubt, but his selflessness can overcome his fears. Stumpy prefers to stay in the back and provide support to his teammates, and with Spore, Stun Spore, and Leech Seed, can be a tough mushroom to trample.
