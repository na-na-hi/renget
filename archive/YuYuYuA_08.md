[The Hero Club heads to the Depths of the Earth]
 
or
 
[The Hero Club goes Underground]
 
Yuuna: The six of us from the Hero Club came deep into the mountains looking for a lost cat.
 
Sonoko: But... nobody thought it would turn out like this!
 
Fuu: Nothing's even happened! Stop saying scary things!
 
Karin: But there have been a lot of requests to look for lost animals recently, hasn't there?
 
Itsuki: I wonder if they're sensing something? It seems that they're running away...
 
Fuu: Hey, hey, Itsuki stop saying scary things, too.
 
Tougou: An analysis of eyewitness reports and others indicate that this area is suspicious. What should we do senpai?
 
Fuu: Inside the mountains, huh...
 
Fuu: Hmmm... It’s too dangerous if we go deeper...
 
Tougou: Indeed. There are evil things in the mountain, too...
 
Fuu: Daaa! I already told you to stop doing that!
 
Yuuna: How about we go and look, but return before sunset?
 
Fuu: Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. We've already come this far anyway, so let's do what we can.
 
Sonoko: And so, we headed deeper and deeper...
 
...
 
Itsuki: We've gone in pretty deep, huh...
 
Karin: I'm still getting signal here.
 
Yuuna: Hm? I think I heard a sound...
 
Yuuna: Arere? There's a cave here?!
 
Fuu: You're right. It's a pretty big cave...
 
Sonoko: There's nothing on the map about that, though...
 
Fuu: ...Oh no, my feet are shaking.
 
Tougou: There is evidence that the cat has been in the area.
 
Fuu: Oh dear. Did it go in the cave, I wonder?
 
Itsuki: Let's try calling it from here. Pudding-chan!
 
Yuuna: Come out, Pudding-chan!
 
Karin: We have a lot of dried sardines here, Pudding!
 
Yuuna: ...Uuuu, there's no answer.
 
Fuu: Kuuu... we have no choice, then.
 
Fuu: Want to go look in for a bit? I-I'm not that scared, yeah.
 
Sonoko: ...
 
Fuu: Nogi? Do you have a bad feeling about this? If that's the case, let's not go in.
 
Tougou: Indeed. I believe it's best to follow Sonocchi's hunch.
 
Sonoko: Hmmm... It’s not a bad feeling... more like a strange one?
 
Karin: Let's go in carefully and take a look, then.
 
Karin: Don't force yourself too hard, Fuu.
 
Fuu: I'm totally not forcing myself!
 
Yuuna: Going into a cave, how very Hero-like! But...
 
Tougou: Let's keep our high spirits, but proceed with caution.
 
Yuuna: Oooh, it's pretty big inside...
 
Fuu: Rather, this is has "man-made" written all over it! Give me back my fright!
 
Itsuki: The place is even lit...
 
Sonoko: There's even fallen pipes around... What is this, I wonder? A tunnel’s construction site?
 
Karin: In some ways, this feels creepier than a natural cave. Just what is in here?
 
Yuuna: Pudding-chan!
 
Yuuna: Hmmm... Maybe she's not here?
 
Tougou: My curiosity is urging me to continue, but senpai, it's already time...
 
Fuu: Yeah, I'm worried about the cat... but we need to take care of ourselves too, so let's head back.
 
Yuuna: Okay.
 
The entire group decided to go back and turned around...
 
...but something mysterious stood before them.
 
Yuuna: Uwaaaaa?!
 
Karin immediately went to the front.
 
Karin: Just what are you?!
 
Fuu: T-This presence... it's... not a Vertex, is it?
 
Itsuki: From its presence, it's more like a... fairy?
 
Fuu: Now that you mention it...
 
Yuuna: Y-Yeah, it feels that way.
 
Tougou: If it's a fairy, then it's also an ally... right?
 
Yuuna: Hello, can you hear me? I'm Yuuki Yuuna.
 
Yuuna: I'm... not enemy. Friend, friend.
 
Grotesque shape: ...
 
Yuuna: In English that would be... FRIEND, FRIEND.
 
Grotesque shape: ...
 
Without a word, the gortesque shape suddenly attacked.
 
Yuuna: W-Wha—?!
 
Karin: Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
 
The grotesque shape collapsed from Karin's sharp kick.
 
Karin: A-ara? I didn't mean to go that far...
 
The grotesque shape's body floated and vanished.
 
Tougou: An aggregation of small lights?
 
Soon, the light scattered around.
 
Tougou: It's definitely a spiritual being.
 
Fuu: But since it's a fairy and not a ghost, I'm fine.
 
Sonoko: A man-made cave. And now spiritual beings. This isn't a "criminal's hideout" setting, but a "something-by-the-Taisha" one.
 
Fuu: I hate the second one more, to be honest. Anyway, let's head for the exit first...
 
Itsuki: T-The exit's blocked by a door, Onee-chan!
 
Fuu: What?! Just when did...
 
Karin: My terminal's signal is... kh, totally useless. I can't connect.
 
Tougou: Maybe my modded one can... or...
 
Tougou: It can barely get any connection. It's no use, huh?
 
Karin: Let me borrow it, Tougou. If yours has a higher chance of connecting, then I'll keep trying there.
 
Karin: If the Tasiha is involved with this, I've got one relative I can contact.
 
Tougou: Understood. I leave it to you.
 
Sonoko: This cave is mysteries all the way down, eh?
 
Yuuna: W-Who are you talking to, Sono-chan?
 
Sonoko: Eh? Who, you ask? I'm talking to Wasshi.
 
Tougou: I'm over here, though.
 
Sonoko: Uhmmm...
 
Sonoko: Waa! It appeared again!
 
Fuu: Hey, aren't you a fairy? We don't have any intention of fight—
 
Interrupting Fuu, the grotesque shape attacked again.
 
Fuu: I-It's faster than before?!
 
Sonoko: Seya!
 
With a metal pipe, Sonoko destroyed the grotesque shape.
 
Again, the grotesque shape disappeared.
 
Fuu: T-Thanks, Nogi.
 
Sonoko: Hmmm... It didn't even resist.
 
Sonoko: And unlike a Vertex attack, I didn't feel any bloodthirst. It did attack, of course...
 
Tougou: It does disperse, but the scattered light doesn't go back to the heavens like the Vertex.
 
Karin: Just what are these things...?
 
Fuu: For now, let's just find another way out.
 
Karin: You're right. That door isn't something we can destroy with brute force.
 
Yuuna: That's weird. I'm supposed to be scared, but I'm somehow calm.
 
Fuu: Well, we've already seen Vertex... Hm?
 
Itsuki: There are two of them this time?!
 
Yuuna: Anyway, let the persuasion begin!
 
Yuuna: Hey, hey! We want to talk for a bit so we can become closer—
 
Yuuna: Waaa?!
 
Sonoko: It's attacking again, huh...
 
Karin: Don't worry, I've got this.
 
Karin: Seei!
 
Sonoko: Taa!
 
Sonoko and Karin each destroyed a grotesque shape.
 
Karin: Getting only these things that don’t know mutual understanding is a pain.
 
Karin: Kh, we got another one...!
 
Suddenly, it shot a round of light.
 
Karin: It shot something?!
 
Karin narrowly avoided the shot.
 
The round of light bounced off the wall and disappeared.
 
Karin: ...It doesn't look painful, though...
 
Tougou: If that's a long range type, then I'll... hmmph!
 
Tougou immediately threw stones.
 
Multiple shots hit and pulverized the grotesque shape.
 
Itsuki: Ah, it vanished again.
 
Fuu: Wait, when they reappear, how do I put this, aren't they escalating?
 
Tougou: Yes. Put bluntly, they get stronger.
 
Sonoko: Ah! I think I understand it.
 
Sonoko: Maybe these fairies are used for training?
 
Fuu: Eh? Do such things even exist?
 
Sonoko: Well, it looks like the difficulty is increasing, much like a game, right?
 
Sonoko: If that's the case, they will attack us, but it won't hurt since they're in training mode.
 
Karin: Ah, I finally got through to my brother! Here's his answer.
 
Karin: "I'll give the details later, but for now defeat all the grotesque shapes. That should open the door." He says.
 
Karin: He also said that they get a bit excited when defeated, so it's fine if we go all out.
 
Sonoko: So the Taisha is connected, after all.
 
Fuu: I'm grateful knowing that we can fight at full strength.
 
Karin: Ha! Looks like a lot of them have decided to come out.
 
Sonoko: All right, let's do this!
 
Yuuna: Yuuki Yuuna will also do her best!
 
Yuuna: I'm a Hero in flesh and blood, after all!
 
Yuuna: Here I go! Hero Punch!
 
Itsuki: I-If its support, then I can...
 
Fuu: That's the spirit, Itsuki! I'll go help, too!
 
Yuuna: With the martial arts I learned from my dad, eeeeiya!
 
Yuuna: Hero High Kick!
 
Tougou: My training in the past isn't just for show!
 
Tougou: I can fight even if it's against dolls!
 
Fuu: Aim for the weaklings...
 
Fuu: Take this! Girl Power Tackle!
 
The grotesque shape fell down with a thud.
 
Karin: That's pretty powerful, Fuu!
 
Itsuki: A-At the very least, I shouldn't be a hindrance...
 
The grotesque shape shot a round of light.
 
Itsuki dodged it completely.
 
Itsuki: Even I was chosen as a Hero!
 
Tougou: Well done, Itsuki-chan. You observed its movements and dodged well.
 
Yuuna: With that chance... Hero Hook!
 
Karin: Not having a wooden sword is just a handicap for me!
 
Karin: I can handle the likes of you with my bare hands!
 
Sonoko: My body remembers my training, eh? These moves are pretty good, if I say so myself!
 
Sonoko: All right! I'm fired up!
 
The heroes fought hard against the grotesque shapes.
 
Fuu: Haa, haa, haa, we finally got out...
 
Itsuki: The door... really did open... when we defeated all of them...
 
Yuuna: Phew... hm?
 
Yuuna: Aaa! I found Pudding-chan! Hooray! Come here, come here!
 
Fuu: Is this what they call "a blessing in disguise"? Let's head back, girls!
 
Tougou: I don't think they'll pursue us, but pay attention to the rear!
 
Fuu: Ah, geez, this is the usual horror experience!
 
The next day, the Taisha told Sonoko the truth behind the incident.
 
Fuu: So that really was a Taisha secret training facility?!
 
Sonoko: Yup, seems so. One of the sealed ones.
 
Sonoko: Apparently it was used by a clan called Akamine more than 200 years ago.
 
Karin: "Akamine". That's a pretty famous name within the Taisha.
 
Sonoko: Those moving things were a kind of fairy.
 
Yuuna: So they were fairies!
 
Itsuki: Still, it sounds pretty disturbing.
 
Sonoko: Apparently, the entrance was tightly sealed, but
 
Sonoko: It reacted to the Heroes' power and we ended up there.
 
Itsuki: Phew... so normal people couldn't enter in the first place?
 
Tougou: Thank goodness there was no damage.
 
Fuu: But what kind of people are they? The Akamine clan which trained in the cave.
 
Sonoko: It looks like their duty was upholding public order.
 
Karin: Preparing a training facility like that must have been a pretty big deal.
 
Yuuna: It was a really mysterious place...
 
Sonoko: In any case, the place has already been sealed, so it probably wasn't needed.
 
Yuuna: It was... already sealed, eh?
 
Yuuna: Yet those fairies were in there for that long... I feel bad for them...
 
Sonoko: They were supposed to have been collected in the first place. But this time, it looks like they discovered some remaining ones.
 
Sonoko: It sounds like they're proper dealing with it.
 
Yuuna: I see! Thank goodness!
 
Tougou: Upholing public order, huh. There are a lot of duties, it seems.
 
Sonoko: Right, right. The Taisha told us to keep this matter a secret.
 
Fuu: Yeah, yeah. It's the same thing again, huh.
 
Karin: Well, I think it's fine if we keep this matter a secret.
 
Sonoko: In any way, they've upped the security and sealed the area, so nobody should be able to enter.
 
Yuuna: And like this, our great adventure came to an end.
 
Yuuna: But I wonder why? I felt very comfortable in that place.
 
Yuuna: "There are many mysterious things in this world," I thought to myself. (Period)
