#Aozaki Mari’s notes on those she interacts often in the club, and some other people…

##Wrath:
>Eiyu Isamu:
“Someone unaware of the curse we all bear… I hope it continues that way. The wrath… a life like this is miserable. I don’t want to see someone lose to this curse again.”
 - Not aware.
 - Low potential for combat
 - Better leave things that way
 - Don’t feel like interacting with him
 - Looks kinda cute?

>Emilia
“My kouhai and I hope, my future replacement once my time to go is right. She is bright and only bears the curse of the demon arm. I hope she can grow beyond this curse and become stronger than me. Someone without the same plague as mine is better fit to guide the other cursed ones.”
 - Kouhai
 - Little sister
 - Good potential
 - Quick growth
 - Take her to the KFC on our way back home
 - I hope nothing bad happens to her.

>Ikari
“A mad dog waiting to be put down. In a way, we are the same in that regard. Our lives will end we both of us are put down like the rabid dogs we are.”
 - Dangerous
 - Out of control
 - Dangerous levels of mental corruption
 - Operation “DRAGON-KILLER” team waiting to be assembled
 - The talks with Setsuko about “DRAGON-KILLER” are no longer just hypotheticals

>Lucifer
“Dummy, idiot. Should not have entered this life! Why does he try too hard to join us being a weak human! Idiot! IDIOT! IDIOT! IDIOT! ***YOU DAMNED IDIOT! YOUR DELUSIONS WILL GET YOU KILLED***
 - Not my fault
 - Not his fault
 - I feel unwell
  -   Pills, pills… I need my pilsl

##Greed
>Naoki Arai:
“I haven’t interacted with him for long. I guess he is alright. He tries too hard to get laid, but he is not as bad as some of the people I had to deal with.”
 - Keep an eye on him
 - He may have his head stuck in the gutter but he can be saved.
 He has a future, I guess.

##Gluttony:
>Akari:
“Surprisingly stable for a gluttony. She is not as bad as some of us, and is certainly better than your average Gluttony Cursed One.”
 - A good company to Emilia.
 - I am too old and too tall to work in her cafe
 - It is kinda sad, honestly.
 - Do vampires eat KFC?

##Lust:
>Hinako:
“The quintessential Lust user, the one who embodies all of their worst traits and personality. She is a danger to herself and everyone around her, but she has not had critical mass yet. I do not agree with Setsuko that she can be saved.”
 - Operation “DOLLHOUSE” denied.
 - She is dangerous and I can see her going out of control
 - I hope for Setsuko to be right so that other cursed ones can save her from herself and set her on the right path.
 - Her eyes and abilities make her a menace to others, no one with that much control and unhinged tendencies can be trusted with reasonable use of her eyes.
 - Has an interest in Yoru.

>Yoru:
“I like her, she is like almost all lust users but without the undesirable parts and can roll with the punches without becoming deadly obsessive and crazy. The only bad thing about her is that she cannot commit to a single partner, making me work hard.”

>Sezaru Ishiki:
“One of our youngest members. From what I heard from Yoji… one of the most disgusting too.”
 - Gross

>Kazuki:
“An insane maniac with a God complex, a nasty thorn on our side for a while now. Since most of his followers are all normal humans, I can’t barge into his base and do what I should. Sadly, we lack the means to properly deal with him. He will live, for now.”
 - Betrayer Level Target
 - Cult growing out of control
 - Blatant evil usage of his eyes
 - I don’t think we can do anything to him without cleaving through a wave of cultists
 - Any action against him will end in a bloodbath
 - Any combat encounter against him and his cult is out of the question for all affiliated demon hunters, for now.

#Sloth:
>Amane:
“One of our most reliable members, because of her impulses she is easy to deal with and get what we want in our mutual cooperation. As is true about all with pocket dimensions, she is unreliable at best, and a distant ally at worst. Our members should stop relying on her, or get forbidden books from her library. It can only end in disaster.”
 - Powerful ally
 - Useful Library
 - Dozens of forbidden books in her possession
 - In case of emergency, evacuate all available Demon Hunters into her library in case of an “OVERLORD BIRTH CLAUSULE” or a destruction scenario of class A, in case of a destruction scenario of class C where there is no other hunter higher in the hierarchy, the role of president shall be given to Amane.

>Makoto
“Another contender for Yoru. What a hassle. He is kind of cute although… should I take a page of Yoru’s playbook or stick to mine…?”
 - Kind of cute
 - He is a money digger although…
 -  Should I say I am going to enter into my family’s business as a lawyer?

>Komaru
“Unhinged but she is crazy in a nondemonic way. Not may problem. it is a problem for Yoji’s.”
 - Too crazy to interfere. Let the holy spirit deal with her insanity.

##Pride:
>Yoji:
“Reliable and a good man. Hell, we need more people like him if we want to prevent more cursed ones from going insane or evil.”
 - Friend
 - I should at least take him to KFC after what I did to him
 - He couldn’t walk straight for a week
 - I still feel kinda bad
 - I thought he could handle more…

>Kuro:
“My habitual partner in missions for some time now. There is no recent memory I have without her… in missions, of course. In missions. I care about her sleeping issues. Kuro should look after herself more. She is a good gal, but tries too much and pushes her body too far… I hope she can lead a better life outside of the cursed hell we are stuck in.”
 - Friend
 - Near zero chances of going out of control
 - One of the strongest Hunters of our age
 - She has the potential to live a normal life one day. I hope she can.

>Haruhi:
“I like her but her ego is a pain in the ass to deal with. Sometimes I just want to pin her on a wall and let her there for a week. She is helpful but can she be silent for five minutes and not talk about her greatness OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? It gets on my nerves.
 - Key member in case operation “DRAGON-KILLER” goes off.
 - Another good company for Emilia, but she should learn how to shut her mouth off.
 - Sometimes she comes and helps me with the archives.
- In case of destruction of class A and C, safeguarding Haruhi’s safety is an all-time priority for any surviving hunters. 

##Envy:
>Aki:
“A good boy who is walking to his inevitable demise. I wish there was more I could do to help him, but… I should learn and cope with those I cannot help. it never gets easy.
 - A good boy who won’t live to see his thirties, and he gets worse by the day.
 - It is sad that instead of a new collection of cards, his next birthday gift is going to be a casket.
