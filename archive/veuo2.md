Good morning, I'm in tears.
I must have fallen asleep before I knew it.
The cake I had laid out on my computer desk was crushed on the floor.
The grease from the bag of chicken is soaking into the desk, and the cold fat has turned white and hardened.
My cheeks are twitching from lying on my desk when I fell asleep, probably from the bird fat.
The holodule shows no increase in Pekora's stream.
I guess there haven't been any guerrillas since I fell asleep.
I'm going to clean up the shortcake on the floor and throw it away now.
I'm hungry, so maybe I'll just eat the chicken in the crockpot.
But I'm having a mixture of cool emotions that I'm not sure about, like, "That's not so disgusting, I should just throw it away.
Let's clean up quickly, take a shower, and look for another Christmas cake we can get our hands on now, I say to myself.
The cake I had Pekochan illustrate for me is smashed on the floor, but a cake from a convenience store or supermarket would be fine, right?
As long as I can blow out the candles while giggling and saying "Merry Christmas" with the chief, that's fine, right?
Oh no, no, no...that's all I wanted.
I just wanted to say one word, "Merry Christmas" to Pecochan at night.
Was that too much to hope for? Was it too much for my stature?
Every time the chief talked about Christmas in his delivery, I thought it would be a normal night, so I made my boss stamp a request for pay, saying I'd take the night off even if I had to.
I heard that his coworkers around him laughed at him behind his back, saying, "You don't have a girlfriend, do you? I would order a cake ahead of time, knowing that my co-workers would laugh at me behind my back, but I would still take the day off to be proud of myself.
I put ornaments around my desk and decorated my desk-top tree with Chou's ackee and made Chou my desktop wallpaper so I could post it on Twitter later.
And then the "NINJIN" sounded, and the "Peco Rap" played, and I thought to myself, "What the hell are you Pekoants doing on Christmas Day?
But I'm glad you opened Christmas for us, Peco! Fah-fah-fah!
She smiles at me, blowing away my worries and making me smile, even while acting a little uncomfortable.
I wanted to spend Christmas Eve with Pekora like that, even if it was only for an hour.
That's all I wanted.

No use, I can only feel regret even though I'm writing in a rambling manner.
I can't even dry my tears.
I'm going to clean the floor and take a bath.
Sorry for the long post.
