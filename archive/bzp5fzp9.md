#Kaylee's Classroom Contemplations
Relationships:
>Damian Jackson
I respect him. He knows what it is to be poor and outcast, and he’s clearly a skilled fighter, especially with that whip. That power of his is incredible for exams as well. It wouldn’t surprise me if he sold that service to the wealthier students. Outside of that, he seems decent enough so long as parents don’t come up in the conversation.
> Soujyuuro Imai
For being so small, he’s amazingly strong. The third eye is weird, but I’m hardly able to ostracise based on appearance. I have to admit that I’m uncomfortable with his quirk though; even though it just reads surface thoughts, the thought of having someone poke around inside my head puts me on edge.

>Christopher Cain
I have never met anyone as smart as Chris. He seems to know everything, and on the two times I have seen him stumped, both times he made sure to let everyone know he had patched that hole in his knowledge later the same day. His quirk, or quirks should I say, are utterly unpredictable. Almost everyone has a quirk, and he can copy any of them! Doesn’t seem to work on me though, though he can copy my techniques.

>Noah Abrams
Noah is impossible to hate and counts everyone as his friend no matter what. He’s been helpful beyond words both in teaching me Japanese and just being a friend. Even if he insists otherwise, I owe him. For his quirk, even though he burns out quite quickly, he’s surprisingly capable at fighting in that time, particularly for how tiny he is. Soft wings too.

> Yui Sagara
She tries to portray herself as this hardened criminal, but I’ve been around those types all my life, and she’s just a product of her circumstances. I’ve been where she’s been, and she’s not a bad person no matter how hard she tries to convince everyone. Truthfully, I feel a sense of kinship with her; we both need to graduate this school if we are to improve our lives. She’s really mastered her quirk as well, she’s one of the hardest to fight against with how in sync she is with her threads.

> Sora Tanaka
Sora’s got potential. While he doesn’t seem to care much about fighting or much beyond goofing around, after being on the receiving end of his quirk, it’ll become incredible once the effort’s put in. I should try and push him to improve. I wonder how much more effective training under 10 or even 100 times normal gravity would be. In any case, he’s great at parkour, and racing him is fun.

> Chihiro Mitsurugi
She’s gone through a lot. She apparently killed her parents, and now dedicates herself to her blade. That makes her sound way edgier than she really is, she’s always apologising for things that aren’t her fault, and has no self esteem whatsoever. It’s a shame really, she’s incredible at fighting, and one of the few who can really push me. Maybe her mental health will improve if I spar with her more?

> Sandatsu Owari
Something of a weirdo. Doesn’t let anyone near him, seems to be in a special program. Tough as nails though. Stares off into the distance a lot. Not keen to talk about his quirk, seems to just have some basic physical buffs.

>Son Jugo
Jugo is pretty much my best friend. We train almost every day, and while I’m much stronger, he’s way better with his quirk, and also actually knows some martial arts. Doesn’t help him much when I grab him, but it’s still impressive that he can do what he can when he’s so much weaker. Still, he improves me, and I improve him, and isn’t that what friendship is supposed to be about?

> Victor Sigurd
I like sharks, especially great white sharks, so I like Victor. He’s a chill guy, and the best swimmer in the school (though having gills is a cheat!). He’s always down to quirk train as well, but it’s strange, I never feel much stronger (physically at least) after he uses his quirk’s secondary ability to heal us up. Weird. Anyway, I’ve learnt how to beat him. It’s all about getting him to use up his water.

> Shinkan Sen
Reminds me of Thomas the Tank Engine, even though his personality is entirely different. A rich tosser, but not too bad as far as they go. He’s a regular in the gym, and his fighting style is certainly…unique. Always seems to have coal on hand, apparently a good snack. I’ll take his word for it. 

> Ashleigh Katsuragi
She reminds me of one of those tiny dogs that seem to be popular over here, since she’s a tiny ball of anxiety. Shame really, as on the few times she’s come out of her shell she’s seemed pleasant. Her quirk is freaky though, as it feels like you’ve jumped forwards in time by a few moments. Don’t care for her necklace.

>Edith Lee
One of the clique, hate them all. Teleports things into a private space, must be where she hides the stuff she nicks. I know it’s those bitches, just need to prove it.

> Faith Kang
Another bitch. Makes metal servants, fitting for those pampered sows. I would wonder how she compensates those who’s property she damages, but it wouldn’t surprise me if they bail each other out.
> Genma Gō
No lie, I thought he was a girl first time I met him. It’s not my fault, what kind of guy has pierced ears, eyeliner, and an affinity for roses? Apparently, it’s called “bishonen”. Anyway, he’s got a real chip on his shoulder, apparently from his twin, who’s a villain with some wanted group. Another teleporter, but he’s better than the bitch one, as he can teleport himself. Interesting to fight that ability.

> Inigo Myoga
Inigo’s a creep who thinks he’s God’s gift to women. He’s a sleazeball who’s going to become one of those creepy old guys who apparently molest girls on the trains in this country (WTF?). Still, while’s he’s a creep, his dragon construct is actually not too bad. Gigan will often apologise for its master’s sleaze, and since it’s a part of him, there’s got to be that good in Inigo as well.

> Maxine Nguyen
3rd bitch. At least she’s far away. Still, she’s the only one that can actually fight even a little, so I guess she’s the least worst of the batch. Kinda freaky how those arms burst from her back though.

> Hailey Chang
H.A.T.E. H.E.R. its as though everything that could be bad in a person was distilled and poured it into a flat mold. Constantly showing off presents from Mama and Papa, she’s more spoiled than a fruit bowl left out in the sun for a month, and twice as rotten. Telekinetic, fitting for how lazy she is.

> Minerva Kim
I swear she’s responsible for draining the battery on anything I’m using, she’s the only one with the quirk for it in class, and she’s right behind me! Apparently, that’s not enough proof though, but I’ll get some somehow. Manipulates electricity around her for her quirk.

> Hifumi Takeda
Hifumi’s pretty cool. He’s a tough fighter, but in all honesty, he’s trying to fight head on against those of us with super strength and it’s just not going to work. Looking at his quirk though, once he gets a full grip on it (as well as focusing on the technical over the brute aspect of fighting) he’s going to be one to watch. Wants to be the Number One Hero, so at least he’s always up for a fight.

> Bobby Samson
One of the only other foreigners here who isn’t Japanese to some extent. His dad was a big hero on the other side of the pond (does that saying still apply here?), but he’s not stuck up about it or anything. If anything, he seems to get embarrassed about the subject. Anyway, he’s a good fighter when in the daylight, but useless after dark. Feels like a joke could be made there, but I like him, so I shall refrain. 

> Kyoda Hiro
Kyoda may be a genius to rival Chris, but he’s also creepy enough to rival Inigo. I’ve heard rumors about why he was held back, that he did something with his drugs to a girl, but I overheard that from the bitches, so it’s probably not true. Can make almost any drug, from alcohol to steroids. A bookworm over a fighter.

> Atsushi Orochi
Atsushi is one hell of a fighter. While she’s not my match physically, those tail-heads are a menace in close-quarters, and she knows how to incorporate them. The venom doesn’t bother me much, but I’ve seen it lay out full grown men in moments, so it’s clearly potent. Grappling her causes itches, so wear gloves.

> Nyoro Hoge
Who? Had to double check to confirm she(?) is actually a student here. Until the debacle around Class Rep, most of the class didn’t know she(?) was even here. A thinker more than fighter, she apparently gets perfect academic scores in all our exams. Apparently, it’s her quirk; it makes her really hard to notice. I can see how that could be really useful as a hero, but it’s going to make it hard for her to be a class rep if everyone can’t help but ignore her.

> Aiko Ami
Our beloved sensei. A high ranked pro-hero, she’s seen actual combat, making her a great instructor. Manages to command the classroom even with the more colourful members of the class, but considering how most of the class are boys, that shouldn’t be surprising considering she’s pretty. Her quirk is all about boosting others, two at a time, though she’s a powerhouse in her own right as well. No wonder she’s a top-rated hero. I like her.
