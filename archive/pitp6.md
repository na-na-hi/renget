#Summoner!#
##Anon wizardry finally pays off!##
==A short green to vent some desires==
>"It'll only hurt for a second. I promise~"
>You scrabbled away from the crude pentagram you had drawn on the floor. In the process you kicked your laptop away, the screen still showing the familiar image-board you took these instructions from.
>It worked.
>It really worked!
>Before you stood a demon in all of her terrible glory, slender body straddling the remains of your summoning altar while her amber eyes pierced through the veil of perpetual shadow that cloaked her.
>Eventually you ran out of floor, and your back met the wall behind you.
>She cleared the distance in two strides of her hooved legs, and bent down to take your throat in her grip.
>She lifted you like you were made of paper, and threw you to the bed like a pillow.
>While you recovered from the room spinning, you found yourself pressed further into the bed and harder into the headboard by her weight settling atop you.
>Before you could even plan an escape, she was already there.
>"What was your name again? Anon, right?"
>She waited for your answer, which you gave with a dumb nod. Her clawed fingers caressed your chin and brought your gaze up to meet hers.
>"Tell me anon: are do you like pain?"
>You try to shake your head, but find it held fast in her grip.
>You tried again, much to her amusement, but your face was fixed to the spot.
>With dread creeping up your back, you tried to nod. The movement came freely and fluidly.
>Oh no...
>"Oh GOOD! I was hoping you were just my type. A foolish man who summons someone they can't quite handle, but..."
>A single finger of her free hand traced down your chest, and the shirt that covered it came free from where her claws cut it.
>Following such, a stinging line of red bloomed along your chest from where she scratched you.
>"You're a big guy, right? I'm sure you can...learn to like it."
>You really wanted to deny her, but your mouth stayed shut. Whether through fear or something else, you lacked the will to defy her.
>She took your silence as a prompt to continue.
>"Oh don't worry, dear Anon. I won't do anything too severe this time. Training works by increments, and while I'd like to simply throw you into the deep end..."
>She eyed the pentacle behind her, and you understood her intentions more clearly than you wished to.
>"I'll simply settle for giving you a taste of what our Pact entails. So..."
>Three more lines appeared on your chest, each one bringing a new sensation of pain with them.
>Akin to a cut with salt rubbed into it, they stung and made themselves known.
>However, true to her word, it wasn't the worst feeling. It hurt, but if this was the worst, you'd survive.
>As if sensing your thoughts, she leered at you. "See, Anon? I'd never lie to you. Just a little for now. And with this pain..."
>She leaned down, bringing more tongue than you expected that caprine muzzle to contain flowed out.
>Nearly a foot, if not more, oozed out before setting near the cuts' ending points.
>Then slowly, so very slowly and with such a deliberate attention that it threatened to become vulgar, she ran that devilish length up each one.
>Blood you didn't know you bled was cleaned up, as your captor made your chest as clean as she could.
>Each run up the cuts brought a new stinging sensation, but this time something new was added.
>"...pleasure is given."
>She ran a claw down your arms, drawing fresh lines of red that you recoiled from. These were deeper, and your lifesblood flowed freely from the throbbing marks.
>"More pain..."
>That tongue ran across each gash, practically tasting you as the tapered tip dove into the space created.
>Again, you winced from it. Wanted to pull away from the sensation she forced on you.
>And, again, it was soon replaced by a feeling of warmth and relief. As if a balm was poured onto the worst of the fire blooming in your flesh.
>"...brings more pleasure."
>"Do you understand, Anon?"
>Her hand left your jaw, giving your much-needed freedom.
>Giving you the choice to answer as you really wanted.
>You though about it: you were in pain, but she seemed to wick away the worst of it soon after she inflicted it.
>And, much to your surprise, the feeling wasn't all that bad.
>You'd even...possibly consider it pleasant.
>You watched her carefully, looking to your demon as she watched you in kind.
>Her cruel smile was still there, but you could tell she was waiting.
>You felt like this was an absolutely bad idea.
>Slowly, against your better judgement, you nodded.
>If her eyes were shining before, they were practically flames as the stared into yours.
>"Oh, Anon. Such a brave man!"
>She was practically giddy, taking your head in both hands.
>"Then, Anon my dear summoner, let us make this official!"
>Goat-like lips sealed around yours as that mercurial tongue explored your mouth.
>Then, pain bloomed as something pierced your tongue.
>You yelped, feeling a hint of true agony for the first time as your mouth filled with blood.
>Her claws dug into you as they held you still.
>You tried to pull away, but to no avail.
>But, as that devilish appendage roamed around your innards, the pain ebbed away.
>A pleasure bordering on the carnal replaced it, and you found yourself moaning into her embrace.
>Your head felt...fuzzy, as new feelings were placed inside.
>New thoughts flooded your head.
>And something hard was attached to your tongue.
>"Now, my partner. Let this onyx ring seal our pact. And when you awake, you'll know how to summon me again~"
>She pulled away, a line of drool connecting you two.
>And then darkness took you.
>You awoke in your bed, drenched in a cold sweat.
>The pentacle, the demon, and the scars were gone.
>but something remained.
>Your tongue was pierced with a simple silver ring, and a single thought filled your head.
>"See you tonight, Summoner~"
