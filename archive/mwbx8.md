Wrestler Anon by bara/hmoma writefrien

>It's Anon's first primetime match where he's scheduled to job to one of the main heels
>Heel plays up humiliating the "weak newbie human" your debut is supposed to be a redemption story where you fight your way to revenge
>Crowd's going insane as you trade blows and acrobatics debuting with a style unique to humans
>Get brutally choke-slammed by the "villain", it really did take the wind out of you, but the show must go on
>He stomps you back down when you try to recover, taking the mic and berating you to get the crowd going.
>Deciding to play into it, you let yourself look as crestfallen as possible as the countdown begins, "struggling" to pick yourself back up and shedding a tear for the camera (thank you acting school!)
>You expected some sympathy among the cheers, but knew the heel was the star of the night.
>The crowd was actually deathly silent, watching the last five seconds wide eyed, you were pretty sure some of them were wiping their eyes.
>As the referee called out "FIVE!" A voice rang out from the upper stands, some kid tearfully shot up out of his seat "GET UP ANON!"
>"FOUR!" More voices joined in begging you to recover, they refused to let it end like this
>"THREE!" More people join in, getting desperate, you look to the manager, who looks back to you, just as bewildered by the support as you are.
>"TWO" Deciding that it was time for some improv, you did your best to make it seem like the cheers of the crowd helped you recover as you fought your way back to a standing position just in time.
>Battered and bruised, you were supposed to be knocked out by now, but instead you dramatically snatched the mic, summoning your best look of fiery determination.
>Pointing to the heel in the most heroic pose you could think of, you boldly claim that it would take more than that to crush the fire of the human spirit
>You cringed at your own words, but the crowd lapped it up as the match raged on, screaming your name
>Heel looks dumbfounded, even his own diehard fans are on your side as you shakily pick yourself up and get into a fighting pose
>You're not sure if it's him staying in character or getting genuinely upset with you, but he snarls before rushing to take you down again
>The two of you clash in the middle of the stage "what the hell do you think you're doing new guy?! Go down already!" He seems pretty pissed that you're still fighting
>You simply reply with "improvising" as you drop low, tackling him under you, he's not much bigger than you and goes down easily, with the wind knocked out of him it's not too hard to get him into position for your signature move
>The move had a name, but nobody's actually seen it yet, so this'll be a good debut. You quickly wrap the arm and head of the heel in your thighs, stopping him from being able to pick himself back up (pic related)
>You pull his legs apart, stopping him from being able to kick himself free or get any purchase against you as you keep him pinned for the countdown.
>Your thighs flexed, crushing him as he writhed fruitlessly under you, the crowd loved it, you could hear the announcers screaming in excitement, hyping up the crowd further
>"THERE IT IS JERRY! THE CONSTRICTOR! CAN HE ESCAPE?!"
>It seemed like the heel really was trying to buck himself free, but not because he wanted to win.
>You became painfully aware in the last 5 seconds of the countdown that there was a noticeable tent forming in his trunks next to you.
>He seemed to be enjoying getting wrapped in your thighs like this a little too much, his tail was also wagging slightly, speeding up when you pushed his legs further apart to help hide the boner.
>As you got down to the last second, you saw the embarrassment and something else clearly on his flushed face as he went limp under you, pretending to be out cold
>The crowd went wild as you secured your first ever win in the big leagues with your own signature move.
>Seeing you dominate the crowd and take down a fan favourite like that got you some mixed reactions backstage.
>The suits of course absolutely loved it, you had brought in more than one event's cash in sales and subscriptions with your charming hero act.
>The other wrestlers were eyeing you up oddly as you stripped out of your gear, some looking curiously at you to see how you looked without a mask on and some sizing you up.
>Wolfbane A.K.A "The heartstopper" A.K.A the guy who was face deep in your thighs twenty minutes ago was trying to burn a hole in your head with his gaze
>The stares and glares were getting to be a little too much, and you decided to finish stripping in the showers alone.
>The second your mask was off and the refreshing spray from the shower was washing the sweat away, you heard two new sets of footsteps and the hiss of the two showers flanking you turn on.
>Rinsing the shampoo from your hair, you saw that you currently had two large, naked, spotted hyenas smiling at you and they eyed you up and down, not even trying to pretend they were just showering casually.
>They were "Razzamatazz" and "Fang Viscious" a legendary pair of twins and rivals that specialized in tag-team matches and the occasional dramatic brother vs brother showdown
>They were nearly identical out of costume, the color of their natural yeen mohawks helped you to tell them apart.
>"Good job with wolfbane tonight newbie" Razz began
>"Yeah! He was sooo pissed! It was hilarious!" Fang continued
>"You might have caught *him* off guard"
>"But we've all got our eyes on you now"
>"Wolfbane's gonna want revenge"
>"And we're looking forward to seeing how good you *really* are"
>"See you in the ring anon~"
>"We promise to be gentle~"
>The twins cackled as they left you to finish your shower alone, you really did only get by on dumb luck didn't you?
>You resolved to train harder, and give those two a run for their money when they finally took you on.

>Your next match was a revenge one, the regularly scheduled Friday night "rage in the cage"
>Your opponent was Wolfbane, he simply glared at you with fire in his eyes as his entrance theme played
>You had been told he wasn't going to hold back tonight and you could really feel it in the air.
>There was something about his odd silence and the way he met your eyes so coldly.
>You weren't just in the ring with a professional anymore, this guy was an apex predator, you felt tonight was going to go down to the wire.
>As the cage was sealed, he didn't hesitate, breaking into a sprint right towards you with frightening speed.
>You only barely managed to defend yourself as his clawed hands interlocked with yours, he snarled as he began to bend your fingers backwards
>You didn't understand, you thought you handled him pretty well last time, why were your knees buckling as he pressed further into you?
>"Tonight it's YOU going down!"
>You did the best thing you could think of, throwing yourself backwards! It managed to catch the wolf off guard as he fell with you
>You quickly maneuvered a leg to the wolf's abs, pushing in with all your strength, you saw his lupine eyes flash with surprise as he careened through the air, flipping over you
>You felt him thudding against the map near you as he presumably landed flat on his back, good, your chance was here!
>Once you felt his claws release their grip, you rolled away, putting some distance between yourself and the wolf.
>When you shot up, you checked to see how your opponent was doing, if he was winded you cou-
>Wait, where the hell was he?! He should be right in front of you!
>That second of confusion was all wolfbane needed as a python like arm wrapped around your neck from behind
>"Too slow, weakling, you're mine!"
>You could see the announcers hopping out of their seats as the corner of your vision began to lose color 
>You managed to grit out a "How?!" before the wolf tightened his grip, making you see stars as the oxygen left your body
>A low growl rumbled into your back as he pressed himself closer "You got lucky you insignificant FUCK"
>You didn't have the strength to wriggle away as he lifted you with terrifying strength, you clawed desperately at the arm around your neck but nothing could stop his over the shoulder throw
>There was a whoosh and a thud that made your ears ring as you were flipped and slammed into the mat.
>Shit, that hurt! You needed to pick yourself up!
>Your legs and arms were slow to respond, no matter how much you tried to summon the strength, you couldn't feel that same fire as before
>The crowd was bustling with canine superfans of wolfbane tonight, they booed and jeered you as you shakily picked yourself up
>The heel was prancing around you, hyping up the crowd and making a total clown out of you.
>That motherfucker!
>You grit your teeth and steeled yourself as you charged him, coming in low to tackle his waist, he had his back turned so there was no way he cou-
>The wolf was like a black blur as you swung your arms to catch him, you understood how he got behind you like that now.
>As he vaulted over your low charge gracefully, you managed to barely stop yourself from eating a mouthful of cage, you realized he was actually scarily agile for a guy so big
>Maybe if you took it into account you could think of something to beat him, but you quickly ran out of stamina and ideas as he toyed with you
>He smirked as he saw your laboured breathing, and went on the offence
>You could barely keep up as he wore you down attacks coming from insanely low angles followed by ones that forced you to look into the blinding stage lights overhead to see
>He finally wore you down enough to leave you a heaving mess as the crowd chanted his name. The last attack was telegraphed to all hell as he simply rushed you with that same inhuman quickness
>You should have been able to do something, but your exhausted body wasn't reacting anymore, every guard and dodge felt like hell, and you couldn't summon the strength to swing back
>You managed to lift your arms just in time to catch the meaty bicep of the wolf, but he already had a clawed hand around your throat as he hooked a leg behind one of yours
>The last thing you saw you hit the mat was the evil smirk on his face and the world rushing around your peripheral vision as he threw you into a brutal chokeslam that emptied the last of the air from your lungs
>Your heaved with ringing ears, you expected to see a referee counting you down, but there were just the overhead lights and a dark shape being lowered from the ceiling, a microphone?
>A boot pressed into your stomach, causing you to sputter to life as he twisted his heel into one of your bruises.
>You looked up to see the wolf, ringed by stagelight looking down at you with disdain, he held the mic in his hands as he began to speak
>"You thought you were special didn't you 'hero'?"
>"Last time was a lucky break, and I'm never gonna let it happen again"
>"I'm gonna show you and your fans who the real top dog is here you WEAKLING!!!"
>All of the lights died in the stadium for a moment before a single spotlight illuminated the two of you.
>Wolfbane's theme picked up over the speakers, and you were paralyzed when you realized what he was going for.
>The mic was quickly discarded as he clambered up the wall of the cage, positioning himself right above you on the edge.
>He bent his knees as if going for a dive, before launching himself into the air over you in his signature move, the midnight moonsault
>His backflip levelled out, and you felt the heat and weight of his body crushing you before everything went dark
>When you came to you were in your private dressing room, your manager was fidgeting over you as the medical team checked your vitals
>Everything hurt, but you were okay, no concussions or fractures but you needed a few days in bed to fully recover.
>You still had your mask on, apparently you had only been out for just long enough for them to get you scooped up and out of public view
>Your manager chided you for pissing off one of the big leaguers like that but he seemed relived that you were okay, and had booked you some time off.
>You wanted that match to go toe to toe so badly, but you had been chewed up and spit out like it was nothing.
>Your manager noticed you were a little too crestfallen looking to take interviews or get roasted by the others in the lockers and pointed you to the private bathroom.
>The hot shower did help you feel better, you decided that the best time to head out would be now before the crowd started going home.
>You slipped out in a casual looking jeans and a hoodie combo, your mask obscured a lot of your face, so people didn't seem to notice you like this, thank god.
>It was pretty funny having security eyeballing you angrily before seeing you had a wrestler's backstage lanyard, causing them panic, get off their phones and pretend to be busy in front of one of the stars.
>You were incognito enough to take your own car home, but you really really needed some fucking comfort food first, tonight's events justified it right?
>A quick google search showed a 50's style diner nearby. Apparently it was a hidden gem that served some mean pancakes and milkshakes.
>That was all the convincing you needed as you made a quick detour to this "Full moon family diner"
>The place was pretty cute honestly, there was a jukebox, a tired looking waitress named "Pam" and the smell of syrup and sugar in the air
>You opted in for the "cake and shake combo", eagerly awaiting the sugar rush that'd help you forget tonight's bitter events
>As you sat scrolling through your account, you were relived to see you weren't a total laughing stock to the fans now
>A lot of them were voicing concern and wanted to know if you were okay, you figured your manager could handle that mess and you could do some social media stuff on your break
>You were snapped out of your thoughts by the sound of rumbling, you actually patted your stomach to make sure it wasn't you before realizing there was a huge muscle car pulling up outside
>You swore you had seen it before somewhere, that black and red design pattern looked strangely familiar.
>You felt your heart leap into your throat when you saw a certain lupine figure exiting from the driver's seat.
>Was that fucking WOLFBANE?!
>He was clad in a leather jacket, ripped jeans and boots, but it was definitely him, the build, the eyes and the shit-eating grin on his muzzle were all 100% matches.
>The wolf barged in through the door, whistling happily and greeting the waitress like an old friend, judging by the way she brightened up for him, he was totally a regular.
>The guy who had just publicly humiliated you in front of a screaming crowd was now chatting happily, tail swaying as he plopped down into a seat to get the same thing as you. 
>He didn't seem to notice you instead playing with his phone and sharing banter with the staff
>"What has you in such a good mood tonight anyway?"
>"Let's just say I had a really good day at work today" the wolf replied, laughing.
>You felt your cheeks flush as you tried to push the embarrassment down, why'd you have to stumble into this dude's hangout on tonight of all fucking nights?!
>Maybe you could eat without him seeing you, or even cancel your order and slip out, but just when you were about to get up, Pam strutted out with your meal
>The wolf perked up, tail wagging as he waited to be served, only for Pam to swerve around him and promptly serve you instead, and of course his eyes naturally fell on you
>Well shit.
>You were expecting something from him, a glare, a sneer, a dismissive look, but instead when the two of you locked eyes he seemed to jump a little before quickly looking away doing anything he could to look casual, weird...
>You decided it was best to focus on the pancakes, the faster you ate them then the faster you could get the fuck out of there. When you took your first mouthful you really weren't expecting them to be so good.
>In fact, the sweet, fluffy syrupy goodness was so pleasant that you couldn't help but forget your awkward predicament as you hummed happily over your food.
>"They're great, right?" You looked up to see the wolf smiling sheepishly over at you, tail wagging slightly as you slowly nodded a "yes" with a mouthful of pancake.
>For a heel who was known for being pretty brutal, he was acting super different around you right now compared to less than two hours ago.
>Maybe his tough guy thing was really just some kind of method acting, and this was his olive branch to you?
>You should probably try and assume the best here, stewing in negativity was only gonna make you feel worse, so you decided to extend an olive branch back.
>Swallowing the delicate remains of your pride you smiled warmly at him"You did really well in the match tonight, I could barely keep up!"
>The wolf looked shocked for some reason, quickly patting himself down before checking his own face "Oh crap I didn't wear my mask out of work again did I?!"
>Confirming that wasn't the case, he eyed you suspiciously "Hey, how were you able to tell?"
>You could only shoot him a confused look, what the hell was wrong with this guy?
>He promptly sat himself down at your booth, leaning in and whispering "How could you tell I'm wolfbane?!" He said his own title like it was a curse word.
>Then it clicked, holy shit, he didn't recognize you! He thought you were just some dude!
>You could just tell him who you were, you even had your pass to back it up
>But that little part of your psyche that urges you to do the wrong thing won out
>You decided to mess with him, just a little bit, worst case he'd tell you to go fuck yourself anyway right?
>You smiled brightly at the wolf "Well, how could I not recognize you? The look, the swagger, that build! It's obviously you"
>The canine looked surprised, and you heard his tail thumping against his seat before he recovered and shot you that big shit-eating grin
>"heheh It's always nice to meet a dedicated fan such as yourself!" He puffed his chest out in pride.
>You don't recall saying you were a fan, but he was lapping the imagined praise up, so you kept the charade going
>"I was soo stoked when you pulled off the midnight moonsault tonight, also how the heck are you so crazy fast!?"
>The wolf's tail was in full swing now, you weren't sure why he thought getting praise from you was so important when he had like eight hundred more guys that'd tell him the exact same thing tonight.
>He started talking about how it really was just years of practice that got him to that level, nothing you could really use to your advantage, damn...
>You nodded and smiled, it was interesting to see this side of him, so you kept it up.
>But as the two of you finished up your meals, he did something you really weren't expecting
>Standing up, he moved over to your side and sat right next to you, draping an arm over your shoulder
>What was he-"Hey, can I confess something?"
>You nodded sheepishly, was this going to be some scandalous confession? Trade secrets? Drugs?
>He leaned in, his voice was a low rumble in your ear "You're exactly my type, and I really wanna take you home tonight"
>Your mind went blank, you felt a clawed hand caressing your shoulder as he continued "After a win like tonight, all I want is a sweet thing like yourself in my bed, just say the word and I'll take care of you"
>You were such an idiot
>This was bad, really really bad.
>You should have come clean, let him be upset and had the whole awkward ordeal put behind you forever.
>Instead you stupidly placed your hand on his warm thigh, giving it an appreciative squeeze before smirking up at him.
>He let out a low rumbling chuckle as he he leaned in to kiss you "I'll take that as a 'yes'".
>The meal was his treat, and the two of you were all over each other once the bill was paid.
>You tried to rationalize your behavior as the wolf pinned you between him and his car, kissing you hard and deep
>This was just for research purposes! Know thy enemy! Holy crap he was a good kisser!
>The drive to his place was slow, and the wolf spent it with one hand on the wheel and the other gleefully playing with you in the passenger seat.
>His paw would reach up into your hoodie to appreciatively feel you up, you saw him licking his lips as his hands roamed over your abs.
>He seemed to be loving the feeling of your skin as his pawpads massaged you, when he noticed the sizable bulge forming in your jeans he actually whistled in appreciation before plunging his greedy hands downward to squeeze your cock.
>You let him have his way with you, might as well enjoy the ride right? It was flattering that you managed to get him this hot and bothered
>He didn't stop as the two of you made your way up into his apartment, cupping your butt in his hands and guiding you to his place.
>The moment of truth came as he pulled you into the bedroom and pulled your hoodie over your head putting your body on display
>His eyes widened when he saw you covered in bruises and claw marks, you had to think fast!
>"You don't mind a guy who likes it a little rough right?" You blurted out the first thing that came to mind.
>The wolf traced his thumb over the bruise on your neck "God, that's so fucking hot" he dove in and began running his tongue over the injury
>You guessed working as a heel required some sadism...
>He took your excuse as a signal to turn things up a notch, stripping himself down while he kissed and worshipped your bruised body, you helped him get naked and slowly unbuttoned your jeans.
>Once the two of you were down to nothing, the wolf let out a low growl of appreciation at your body, before pulling you into a rough kiss and throwing you onto his bed
>It felt uncomfortably familiar having him pin you like this, but now instead of a cheering crowd and a ringing in your ears there was just the sound of your own moans and his dirty talk
>"You're so hot man, I really need you right now"
>You could feel the wolf's erection against your stomach, his heartbeat was racing as he pressed into you.
>"H-hey uh could you do me a huge favour?"
>You looked at him curiously
>"Could you call be by my stage name during?"
>Welp, you were already in pretty deep now, so why not?
>You did your best to look as seductive as possible while you delivered the line: "Come show me who the top dog is, Wolfbane~"
>euggh, that felt really embarrassing to say
>The wolf clearly disagreed, crashing his mouth into yours "Fuck yeah, keep talking like that!"
>He gripped both of your cocks, pressing them together before roughly pumping them up and down.
>You kept it up, calling his name, encouraging him to keep going between kisses as the two of you became a mess of pre and sweat
>You both got close to the edge a couple times, but he always slowed it down to keep the fun going, eventually he couldn't resist anymore and reached over to the nightstand
>"Usually I'd wanna suck you off a little or something, but I need to get inside you right now!"
>He produced condoms and a bottle of lube, the rubber barely fit over his throbbing, knotted cock as he hastily suited up
>A dollop of cool lube was applied to his member as he dove down to quickly eat you out, he lapped at your hole eagerly to prep you
>You moaned and writhed as the wolf lapped at your hole, looking down to see those piercing eyes of his clouded with lust.
>He finally finished up, and you could feel his tip pressing against your hole as he looked down on you
>He ran his tongue across his pointed teeth, "Say my name, say you need this cock" egotistical bastard...
>You obliged, trying to look as sultry as your battered body would let you offered yourself to him "I need you inside me, wolfbane"
>If you ever had to give up wrestling you could always be an escort based on how the wolf was literally drooling over you right now
>You took a deep breath as you felt the heat of his cock press into you, trying to relax as much as possible.
>"Don't worry babe, I got you" The wolf flashed that same toothy grin as he did his best to be careful guiding himself in
>You couldn't help but laugh a little, he was a surprisingly tender lover, and this was actually some pretty great sex so far
>curling your arms into the thick fur of his neck, you pulled him into a gentle kiss, you swore this was just to help you relax
>Before you knew it he was all the way inside except for his knot, his pulsing member felt white hot as he leaned into you more
>The wolf pumped in and out slowly, gauging how you felt, you let out small sighs and moans, egging him on whenever you felt right and making sure to include his name
>He was surprisingly obedient at the start, but before long he was pumping harder and faster on his own accord, and it didn't take long to prove he did indeed like being rough
>He wrapped his fingers around the bruise on your throat, taking care to not actually squeeze, he just wanted the visual of a human on the end of his cock looking like this
>When you lifted your chin and bared your neck in submission, he was quick to establish dominance, leaning in and resting his open mouth over your neck
>It felt amazing, but you had your own plan in mind
>His claws dug further into you as he went harder, and you couldn't help but moan, there was a satisfied rumble from him as he marred you with hickeys and nibbled whatever skin wasn't bruised by him already
>"nnnrgh so soft~ You're just like him~" interesting
>You were too focused on keeping the wolf rutting you while you snaked a hand into the pocket of your discarded jeans, this wouldn't end well, but you didn't care anymore.
>You made sure to keep him close to your chest, only releasing the grip on his back to let him kiss you while you moaned his stage name like a whore.
>"*nngh* Go harder! Pretend I'm *oof* that guy you fought tonight!" You could tell by the picking up in his pace that really did it for him
>The wolf moaned and raised his hips high before slamming them into you "You little slut! You have such a hot hole~"
>You had to bite your tongue to stop yourself from having a mind-melting orgasm as he propped himself up to get even deeper into you
>"f-fuuuck I'm gonna bust soon" perfect, you were getting there too, he was really good
>You could see his eyes screwing shut and his claws tearing into the fabric of the bed as he gritted that out, now was your time to shine.
>You wrapped your legs around his back, turning it into a full mating press before constricting your thighs as hard as possible.
>The wolf snapped out of the fucking in sudden alarm "W-wait my knot! I'm gonna-"
>As he opened his eyes he saw you, smirking up at him with a familiar looking lanyard in your hand
>It read: "ANON A.K.A "[STAGE NAME]" ALL ACCESS PASS"
>With a satisfying pop, the wolf's knot was buried firmly inside of you
>The wolf's was contorted in pleasure as the orgasm he had boiling over finally erupted
>"FUUUUUCK!" he howled in defeat as he started blowing his load inside of you like the horny dog he was
>You threw your own head back as you shot rope after rope of hot cum between your chests. Keeping him firmly locked in place with your legs.
>The wolf was helpless now, he looked like he wanted to kill you but every movement tugged at his knot and turned him into a quivering mess on top of you
>"Y-you son of a bitch!" You wiggled your hips, and for a second you swore the wolf had hearts for pupils, his eyes rolled back as another orgasm rocked him and he spasmed helplessly
>You couldn't help but laugh at the predicament, the two of you were gonna be stuck like this for a while, so you might as well make the most of it
>You relaxed around him, letting your legs fall into a more comfortable position as you cradled his head in your shoulder, tracing circles in the back of his neck
>"So uh, I know how this looks"
>You received a low snarl in response
>"B-but I swear I wasn't trying to mess with you! We just ran into each other and you didn't recognize me"
>He gave a skeptical click of his tongue
>"Also I mean, do you really think I'd go through all of this just to fuck with you?" oof, bad wording choice there
>"You got close to me just as I was about to let you know who I was, and uh, I ended up thinking with my dick"
>The wolf was totally silent now, face buried in your chest
>"So uhh, sorry for lying to you but um...I had a great time tonight"
>The wolf finally opened his eyes, there was an unusual tenderness about how he was looking at you right now
>It was hard to say this part with him looking at you like that "Also you *did* seem to enjoy pretending it was me so..."
>He shot up, trying to get away before realising that he was still knotted, and he once again came flopping back down onto you.
>"N-NO I WAS *ungh* THINKING OF SOMEONE ELSE SHUT UP!" He was blushing furiously, what a terrible liar
>You smirked, "Honestly I'm quite flattered!"
>The wolf had his head in his hands now, cute.
>The wolf was all red now, he gritted his teeth before finally speaking, it was a barely audible "..ematch"
>"What was that?"
>"I WANNA REMATCH!" what the hell was this guy yelling about?
>You cocked your head in confusion "You...won tonight's match though?"
>"NO! I CAME FIRST! You did your crazy strong leg shit again and I busted the fattest nut of my entire life!"
>oh...
>He continued to rant saying how it was unfair because he thought you were just some handsome human, and that he had a thing for smooth skin and a bunch of other compliments hidden in a petulant tantrum
>You did the "crazy leg shit" again, and the wolf choked out a groan as he melted into you once more, too bad you couldn't use this on him in the ring...
>The two of you lay there for a moment, you noticed he didn't mind you petting his fur, and you certainly didn't mind how he snuggled into you despite the grouchy look on his face
>You realized this would require some more of that charm you seemed to possess to resolve.
>You started with a scritch behind his ear and a "Hey", once he looked up at you, he was pulled into a tender kiss, nothing as raunchy as what was happening moments before, just a peck on the front of his snout.
>Flashing him the warmest smile you could, you simply said "truce?"
>There was a flash of *something* in his eyes before he buried his head back into your neck with a "...'kay"
>You gave him more appreciative pets for cooperating with you, he really was just a big grouchy pup.
>"You gotta show me how you moved like that today, I was being honest when I said I could barely keep up you know"
>He snorted derisively "and why would I go sharing my secrets with you? Don't push your luck human!"
>You were prepared for that answer, "Next time I'll let you really give it to me and wear my costume during"
>"N-next time?!"
>"Weren't you *just* demanding a rematch? Or is the great wolfbane all talk?"
>Another growl, "W-WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN THE TRAINING GYM! I'LL SHOW YOU!"

>You had managed to get some intense training sessions in with wolfbane, and you made sure to keep your promise of "paying him back" each and every time.
>You felt stronger and faster than ever, and your new coach with benefits also helped to keep you limber and get your stamina way up. (Not to mention you had gotten way good at blowjobs)
>You were feeling eager to test yourself again, wanting a challenge. You wanted to fight your way to the championship belt and it seemed like the suits were ready to get you in another primetime event.
>The main one on offer right now was a tag team event against the Hyena twins, you felt like you could take one on, but both at once? That sounded like a test of endurance you weren't ready for.
>Who could you partner up with though? Wolfbane was scheduled to do front end publicity events this week, and signed up teams got preference for going up against them if the skill brackets looked even.
>You stood in the locker room, pacing at the sign up sheet, when your prayers were suddenly answered, a pair of sandy paws closed around the front of your mask, snatching wherever they could to try and get it to lift off of your head.
>With practiced movements, you instinctually gripped the attacker's wrists like a vise, pulling off a reversal that left your assailant in a headlock, wriggling desperately. Upon seeing who it was, you immediately began giving him a rough noogy for scaring you like that.
>"oy oy OY OY OY SORRY SORRY SORRYYY" The kangaroo tapped your arm, signaling for mercy, you let him go (eventually)
>"Jeez, what has you in such a foul fuckin' mood today mate?!" Larrikin stared at you, irritated by you once again foiling his plans
>"I don't know, maybe there's some dumb asshole who keeps trying to take my mask off!" You growled in reply
>Larrikin or "Larry" as he preferred, snickered as he rubbed the sore spot on his head "Don't worry babes, I'll keep you safe from him, for reals though, why you pacing around?"
>"I need a second to take Razz and Fang on this Sunday but nobody's available. I'd need to start training today with a partner if I want to stand a chance"
>The Roo looked thoughtful before a smirk creeped up his face, an ill omen if you ever saw one. "Fuck it, I'll be your partner!" Just as you were about to get excited and thank him, he held a single finger up to your face "BUT!"
>"For carrying you, I'm going to need something in return, and I'm not telling you what until after we've kicked their spotted arses, deal?" The Roo held out his hand.
>Idiot, you already knew he just wanted you to see your face, and you could easily convince him to let that happen in private. You confidently took the handshake "deal!"
>The two of you signed in as a team before you immediately started jogging to the gym, you'd need all the training and research possible to fight the twins
>The roo patted the area around him before facepalming dramatically "Ah shit, left me water bottle in the locker, you go on ahead anon! I'll catch up" you nodded, running off.
>Unbeknownst to you, the roo was biting his lip, thinking of cold thoughts and grandma as he fought back the boner inducing thoughts of what he had in store for you.
>You threw yourself into the training with gusto, feeling fired up as you spent your mornings keeping in shape before practicing moves and coordination training with Larry
>He was actually a pretty hard worker when he wasn't goofing off or trying to mess with you, he seemed pretty serious! Though you could tell from his well defined body and quick learning that he wasn't all talk
>It seemed hard to believe that he was going this crazy just to get to see you without your mask on, you'd seen him commit to some pretty high-effort shenanigans, but this one didn't seem that worth it.
>Though, you could just be acting presumptuous, maybe he really wanted to climb the ranks and turn himself into a wrestling legend!
>The thought of that motivated you to try a little harder yourself, you gave your all into the stretching techniques designed to help you feel light on your feet to work, beginning with a horizontal split.
>As you got about halfway down, you looked over to see how your partner was doing on his end. And of course, he was just staring at you.
>Well so much for him having a winner's mindset...
>You shot a disapproving glare his way without letting him interrupt your split, letting yourself dip deeper.
>W-was he seriously just going to keep staring back at you? Asshole...
>You snapped your fingers at him "Focus! We haven't got time to mess around!"
>He jolted back to reality, looking embarrassed for just a moment before puffing his chest out defiantly "Focus on yourself mate, I'm not the one with his shoelaces untied!"
>Dumbass that you were, you actually glanced over, to your foot, giving him the split second his tail needed to poke into your back, sending you face down into the mat with your legs wide apart.
>As much as you wanted to knock him out for that one, you couldn't help but laugh along, training too hard would burn you out anyway, that being said, you'd need to get him back for that one later.

>The hyena twins posed on the stage, calling out anyone who dared to try take them on. Fang, the heel of the two, specifically naming you and Larrikin as examples of people they'd never lose to
>Once the crowd's uproar died down, it was time for you two to shine beginning with you answering the call "WHY DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO MY FACE, FANG!"
>The spotlight illuminated the debut of your first ever team outfit, changing the color palette to match the roo's while also providing a set of high cut lycra trunks and thigh-high padded boots to match his normal look.
>Your new mask scintillated as you dramatically charged into the ring, Razz took his cue to slide out of the way as you barreled into his brother, bringing the yeen crashing down with you as the crowd went buck wild at anon's "rage"
>The free yeen positioned himself to elbow drop you as you locked hands with his brother, only for another, newly dressed blur to slide tackle him away.
>You rolled, throwing Fang to his brothers side as they recovered from the shock and picked themselves back up, both barely hiding their smirks as you impressed them with your showmanship and clean technique.
>Another spotlight came to life, showcasing the roo in your gold and white, with long lycra pants, knee high gold boots and a shiny new bandit mask.
>The novelty of you two outfit swapping, but keeping anon's face a mystery delighted the crowd, you had to hold back a smile to keep your serious facade.
>Looking at the twins didn't help, considering they both seemed to be enjoying the Zettai ryōiki you were giving a little too much. You swallowed back the welling embarrassment of their leering and casually fistbumped the roo as he took his place at your side.
>The usual wrestling banter went back and fourth, Fang and Larry would provoke and prod the crowd into a frenzy while you and Razz acted like honorable knights before a duel, you four had everyone sucked into the kayfabe
>The posturing was set to reach a climax with you. Your manager had given you the line minutes before, and your inner anime loving teenager had to be channeled to get you through it without dying of embarrassment.
>"You won't win tonight, fiends! You'll be swallowed in the flames of our burning passion! Justice will be served!"
>Dear lord, that hurt to say, but despite you wanting to wring your manager's neck for not running that past you earlier, the crowd seemed to enjoy your speeches without a shred of irony.
>The other three were going to roast you hard for that one in the locker room...
>Thankfully, the bell rang, heavy metal picked up over the speakers, and focusing on ducking under the incoming roundhouse kick took precedence.
>The twins were fast, and coordinated their attacks well, you'd feel confident in getting a grapple on one of them, only for the other to swoop in and pull the rug from underneath you. Luckily your training with wolfbane paid off and you were like lightning as you swerved around their tricky attacks.
>Their mixture of combined speed and strength meant you had to gamble on splitting them up and taking them both out in quick succession. Meaning it was time for the combo attack the two of you had spent a week perfecting.
>Getting Fang into a grapple was easy for the kangaroo, what was even easier was falling back onto his muscular tail and using it in tandem with his tree trunk legs to send the hyena flying into the ropes as they kicked out explosively
>Razz was helpless to stop your follow up as you gripped the scruff of his neck and tripped him over your leg. He fell right into his brother's path as he rebounded off of the ropes.
>The hyenas collided with a sickening thud before collapsing into a pile of limbs, the Canberra cannonball combo was a rousing success as the announcers went crazy.
>Victory came as the grounded and stunned yeens were helpless to escape the python-like thighs of you and Larry
>Cheers, confetti, and the announcers screaming your name marked your first ever tag team win as you and Larry basked in victory. A quick glance to the "crestfallen and defeated" yeens. Razz flashed a wink and a grin to you silently saying "no hard feelings"
>The warmth of his recognition of you was a little dampened by his brother glaring at you while Razz dragged him away, you wondered if all the heels took it personally by nature or if wolfbane was setting a bad example.
>Your thoughts were interrupted by the kangaroo giving you a playful hip-check, a familiar smirk on his lips as he told the interviewer he couldn't have done it without you.
>A few minutes of playing up your classic hero character and you were free for the night, the second you were out of the view of the cameras, the happy go lucky roo's boisterous attitude mellowed out into a tense calm again.
>He was like a totally different person as you made small talk on the stroll to your room, you were weirded out by how little banter you received. At least he seemed less outright afraid now.
>When you reached the door to your room, he let out a shaky breath and a nervous laugh "hehe~ Hoooly shit, can't believe you're going through with it mate, even after figuring me out"
>Okay, he definitely expected more than a face reveal right? You weren't stupid. Lacking in common sense after repeated knockouts and blows to the head? Maybe, but even you could see by the way he avoided eye contact and was blushing softly that there was something more.
>You certainly weren't opposed to something like that though...
>But if "something" was gonna happen, you wanted him to feel comfortable, he was a friend after all. You placed a hand on his shoulder, and shot him a reassuring smile as you opened the door.
>It seemed to do the trick as he met your eyes for a moment, smirking through the rosy tint in his cheeks.
>Larry sat on the couch, pulling his mask off and letting out a satisfied sigh, "Good work out there, you really have gotten a lot better"
>You smiled as you popped the button securing your own mask to your face open. A smooth movement that you totally hadn't practiced in the mirror peeled the mask away while slicking your messy hair back.
>You did your best to look charming as you casually revealed yourself "Couldn't have done it without you, but you already knew that~"
>"Yeah but you- woah..." The kangaroo stopped dead in his tracks when his eyes looked up and met yours, uncovered for the first time
>For once in his life, Larry didn't have a smart comment to make, instead he just let the first thing that came to mind spill out, "You're a fuckin' beaut..."
>He caught himself too late, looking scandalized at his own words as you provoked him "Ohh~? Falling in love already are we~?"
>The muscular marsupial went red as you took a step closer "L-love?! Y-you wish mate!"
>Another step, he backed away a little in response "You're so cute when you try to deny things"
>His tail slapped against the ground indignantly at your insinuation "I ain't denying fuck all mate!"
>"Then why are you pitching a tent in your trunks?"
>The roo looked mortified as he saw that he did indeed have an obscene bulge in his pants, the stretchy lycra doing nothing to hide this arousal.
>He backed off some more, scrambling to readjust himself, but he only found a solid wall at his back. You slammed your hands to either side of him, stopping any chance of escape.
>There was just the sound of his breathing as he looked at you, biting his lip as he weighed his options.
>As if you'd give him a choice, you dipped your head in for a kiss, and he let you. 
>The first was a chaste peck, followed by a longer one that made him hum in happiness, followed by him putting his shaky hands to your hips as your tongues began exploring each others mouths.
>Your hands cupped that amazing butt of his
>You took tactical breaks, releasing the fastenings on eachother's costumes until you couldn't take it anymore, roughly gripping the already straining fabric around his butt and tearing it apart.
>You didn't care about his protests as you tore your way downward, immediately sinking your teeth into those beautiful legs and kneading his perky butt with your greedy hands.
>He quickly shut up as he felt you leaving hickeys across his adonis belt while pumping his stiff cock, squeezing out a bead of sticky pre and making him shudder.
>Your oral assault travelled upwards, abs, pecs, nipples, the crook of his neck, the underside of his jaw. Nothing went unexplored as he shivered and moaned at you taking it all from him.
>You peeled him off of the wall, "shower. now." you commanded. He silently obeyed, taking the lead and delighting in the feeling of your hand slipping under his tail.
>Hot water sprayed the sweat and dirt from today's match away as he kneeled in front of you, engulfing your cock in his maw. It felt amazing, gripping the back of his head and letting him gag himself on you.
>You let him suckle and hum contentedly for a while, petting his head in approval.
>You needed more though, specifically you needed to give him a little servicing too before the main event.
>A bottle of waterproof lube came in handy as you picked him up and spread a healthy dollop across your digits before sinking them in between his cheeks, working his needy hole open.
>He moaned like a whore as you dropped down now, propping his tail on your shoulder and burying your face into his bubble butt.
>You were like a machine, one hand kept his dripping cock throbbing and hard, while the other took turns with your mouth at lubing up his perfect pink hole.
>His dexterous tail wrapped around you, trying to pull you up as he begged "f-fuckin give it to me anon, I need it!"
>Naturally, you obliged
>More lube and a little bit of knuckle deep fingering made extra sure he was ready, you were painfully hard, his ass was like a furnace, but wonderfully moist and needy.
>Sinking in, inch by inch, he backed it up for you, tight pucker giving way slowly until you had hilted yourself in you new bitch. He turned his head over his shoulder to pull you in for a kiss, hole clenching as you made out rough and hard.
>You pulled almost all the way out, before returning to the welcoming heat, again and again, faster and faster. Until he had fallen into a comfortable rhythm.
>He looked absolutely beautiful, rippling back under the shower of water, trickling down his back and between a pair of meaty globe-like cheeks, which bounced and jiggled as your hips slammed home into them.
>His tail was propped up on your shoulder, like a third arm it seemed to pull you in to the greedy roo as he rode you like a champ. The handsome marsupial could only pant with his tongue out, blissed out completely
>"A-a-a-anon~<3" His voice was husky and desperate, it made you just want to ruin him, you gripped his wide hips and bucked forward, a loud wet clapping filled the room as you gave up the slow rhythmic fucking to take what was yours.
>Your cock slammed into his prostate at just the right angle now, any sense of pride or rivalry or mutual respect left the roo's mind, he needed you to keep the pleasure coming.
>Your bucking became ragged, and you could feel yourself ready to bust as the roo quivered, getting close himself. You were quickly reaching the boiling point.
>You pulled him up a little, keeping the sex going but wrapping your arm around his neck and letting him know how thoroughly he belonged to you in this moment. "I'm gonna fucking breed you, you fucking slut, get ready, you're not gonna be satisfied by another man ever again~"
>"Fuck, I-nnnnngh!" Whatever dirty talk he had in response was cut off as made sure you weren't cumming alone as you gripped his cock and pumped.
>You filled the roo with a week's worth of cum, almost slipping in the wet shower as you got dizzy from the pleasure. The roo was quick to follow, feeling your hot seed spilling into him had him painting the tiles in front of him with his own cum.
>Every time a rope shot out of his throbbing cock, his hole would clench, milking your sensitive dick for all it had, it was at times like this you wish you had a knot.
>But you were relived you didn't when you both finally calmed down enough to separate, kissing tenderly as the spray washed you clean.
>It had been an intense week of work and you two needed that badly, the roo looked at you curiously as you plugged the drain, changed the knob from shower to bath and poured some liquid soap into the rising water.
>Laying down, you held your arms out for Larry to join you, the both of you simply enjoying the feeling of each other in the afterglow as the bath filled
>You absentmindedly stroked the roo's long ears, making him blush and lean into you more as you two finally exchanged some sleepy words.
>"You know, you're way too cute to be so nervous during sex"
>"I'm nervous cus of all the pervy humans out there tearing me good drawers apart"
>"Oh..S-sorry haha, it's kind of your fault for having such a great ass in the first place though, don't you think?"
>He blushed, hiding himself in your pecs with a huff "That's victim blaming, also why'd you stop rubbin' me ears?"
>You returned to gently caressing his ears with your thumb and index finger, and he sighed contentedly as the hot water enveloped the two of you.
