##### `Bioengineered Wifwolves`
>Be brilliant, mad scientist anon
>Specializing in Biology
>Try to help the world, get rejected, work gets purged
>Set up shop in remote manor/compound, building a lab and gathering resources
>Decide to get back at the world by conqeuring it with an army of super soldiers
>Don't want them to be human, that'd be cliche
>Decide to make an army of wolfmen/true werewolves
>A few weeks later, having gathered, bought or stolen all the resources you need, you stand before the large glass capsule containing the first of your army, the pack leader who would wage war on your behalf
>In order to make them more compliant with your orders, you made them female, while the males would certainly be stronger, you want an army you can actually command.
>As the green nutrient-rich fluid drains away, you smirk, admiring your work
>Standing well over 7 feet tall, with a sculpted body and muscles that would make an amazon jealous, and fur as black as the night, you know instantly that she's the one that will lead your army to victory.
>Her eyes open for the first time, allowing you to see their brilliant amber color, like fine honey
>Her mouth twitches as she tries to speak, and her body shudders as she begins to pull herself out of the opened capsule, her fur damp and shining with the solution.
>Her eyes lock with yours, and her eyes widen, as you continue to smirk, her brain should be recognizing you as her creator, telling her to obey your every orde-
>"m-Master!" she says, her words dripping with obvious lust.
>...
>Wut
>The last thing you see before everything goes dark is 300 pounds of wet fur and muscle embracing you in her surprisingly soft, large breasts.

>A few hours later, you awoke on the bed you kept in the corner of the lab for those real late nights you spent down here, tirelessly working
>As soon as your eyes open, a large, hot wet tongue drags itself across your face, going from your chin to your forehead in only a second, leaving behind a trail of sticky saliva in its wake
>You splutter and wipe away the offending substance, only then feeling a heavy weight on your groin, and look up
>Sitting on you, in all her naked glory, is your alpha
>Her amber eyes wide as she stares into your own, ears twitching this way and that, panting as her tongue drips saliva onto your soaked shirt, and though you cant see it, you feel her tail wagging as it repeatedly hits your legs with muffled thumps.

>Finding yourself in such a vulnerable position, you freeze, unsure of how to proceed
>Your Alpha has other plans though
>She begins to move herself over your body, rubbing your lower half with your own
>Your confusion dissipates as soon as you feel the moist flesh of her pussy glide along your groin
>It's hot, almost feverish in temperature
>She's in heat
>...
>oh shit
>You'd done the research before starting this kind of project, and of course, a few, quite a few in fact, of the books and tomes you had read had mentioned the heat that drove so many werewolves or wolfmen to furiously mate with anything that moved
>You had to stop this
>Not for a lack of not wanting to do it, mind you, but if unprepared, much like as you were now, she could easily grind you into the mattress
>...
>...and of course now you were hard
>dammit
>Shaking your head, and trying to focus, becoming incredibly hard to do so with the Alphas scent growing stronger the longer she ground her dripping sex on your covered length, you spoke to her
>"a-Alpha?", you said, voice barely above a whisper
>With her heightened sense, she easily heard you, turning her head to look at you, the haze of lust in her eyes lifting for a second, awaiting orders
>"C-can you get o-ff-f of me p-Please?", you said, voice beginning to tremble as the pleasure mounted
>For a split second, she didnt respond, and for a second you'd thought she'd disobey, but with a small, heart-wrenching whimper, she lifted herself off of you, and shifted position to stand by the foot of the bed, fidgeting and awaiting your next order
>Trembling with the residual pleasure, and legs half-asleep from the weight that was so recently on them, you sit up, taking notice of the large wet stain on your pants, the thick clear fluid of your Alpha's arousal clinging to the fabric, the scent of it making your head spin for a second as you breathed it in.

>You slap yourself, shaking your head to ward off the addictive scent
>You have work to do
>But, there's something you have to address first, turning to your Alpha
>The whole time, she's standing there, watching you
>It's obvious from her expression that theres a battle between her instincts and the intelligence you gave her going on in her head, brows furrowed and eyes looking into your own even as her large, clawed hands shake and her body trembles, liquid arousal still dripping from her sex in the process
>You move to stand in front of her, looking up into her eyes as she towers over you, while her own golden eyes look down to gaze into yours
>"Alpha" you say, having regained some of your composure
>Your Alpha freezes, awaiting your command
>"Kneel", you say, your smirk from earlier slowly returning to your face
>Instantly she does so, dropping to her knees with a *Thwump* that your certain shifts the bed from the slight reverberation
>Now she's on your level, her head roughly up to your neck, her eyes now looking up into your own
>As you look into her eyes, you see a hint of worry in her features
>She probably thinks your mad at her or something
>You have no choice but to correct that assumption of course
>And you embrace her
>Your Alpha freezes as you cradle her head in your arms, her face pressed to your neck
>As you begin to rub and scratch the midnight black fur covering her head and neck though, she relaxes, leaning into your affections with closed eyes and a happy whine
>"Good girl", you say, whispering into one of her ears, never pausing in your gentle motions
>Her amber eyes, pressed against your chest, snap open at your words
>The only indication to you however, looking down her toned back, is when her thick, furry tail springs to life, wagging back and forth at incredible speed
>You chuckle at the sight, giving the top of her head a kiss, both of her ears twitching against your cheeks as you do so
>This is going to be interesting

>A few days later
>You once again find yourself standing before the large the glass capsule, watching the green nutrient fluid drain away, revealing the furred form within
>Having refined the process, it now takes days to fully grow, whereas before it had taken weeks beforehand
>Positive developments aside, World conquest stops for no one!
>...you think
>The capsule fully opens at that point, drawing your focus away from potential plans, to the white-furred form within, just as heavily muscled as Alpha, if a hair shorter
>Every pack needs a good Beta, right?
>Much as before, her body trembles as she pulls herself out of the capsule, her eyes twitching before opening, revealing a very familiar amber color
>Her eyes widen as they lock onto you
>"Ma-aster!", your new Beta says, moving towards you
>You brace for impact, closing your eyes
>After a minute, you take a peek
>In front of you, restraining your Beta, is your Alpha
>Clawed hands intertwined, noses and breasts pressed against the other, their mouths open, revealing their large, sharp teeth as they look at each other in a silent snarl
>The contrast in the colors of their fur are something to behold, you think to yourself, as you continue to watch
>After a few moments though, the snarl disappears off your Alpha's face, and she begins taking deep sniffs of the air
>A familiar scent reaches your nose as your Beta closes her eyes and whines, her legs twitching
>Much like your Alpha was, she's in heat
>Both your Alpha and Beta turn to look at you, their amber eyes intense
>You sign as they both rush you, soon surrounded by their fur, their tounges lapping at your cheeks
>Maybe world domination can come later, after all.
