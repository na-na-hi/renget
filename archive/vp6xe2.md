#Third Base

>Sunny was at the lakeside hangout spot. Well, some sort of bizarre version of it, anyway. The purple sky made it immediately obvious that he was dreaming.
>He blinked, and suddenly there was someone standing in front of him. Aubrey, specifically.
>”…hello.” he said, surprised but not unhappy to see her.
>”Hey.” Aubrey said simply, stripping out of her jacket and striding towards him.
>Sunny was tackled to the ground (which, thankfully, was soft like a bed). Aubrey loomed over him for a moment before leaning down and pressing her lips into his.
>Oh, so it was going to be one of *those* dreams. He was fine with this.
>Aubrey’s tongue soon invaded his mouth, dancing against his own with a strange sort of aggression. Sunny brought his hand up to squeeze her butt through her denim skirt, drawing a noise of surprise from the girl.
>She took her mouth off of his and gave him a sultry look. ”Feeling handsy, huh Sunny?” Without waiting for a response, she resumed her kiss.
>Aubrey pressed her body into him further, letting Sunny feel her modest chest against his own, and her bulge pressing against his— wait a minute.
>Sunny detached from Aubrey like her skin had burned him. ”WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.”
>”Don’t tell me you’ve never seen a dick before, Suzuki.” Aubrey scoffed and unbuttoned her skirt, revealing what was definitely, irrefutably (heh) a penis
>”Well? You gonna return the favor or what?” She grabbed his hand and guided it to her dick. It was hard, strangely warm, and bigger than his, if only by about an inch. For a brief few moments, Sunny sat there, unmoving.
>’…fuck it, why not?’ he eventually thought to himself. If his dream decided it wanted him to give Aubrey a handjob, then he might as well. What was the harm?
>So, tentatively, he began stroking it. The motion was familiar, though doing it to somebody that wasn’t him was strange, and doing it to a girl was downright surreal.
>At the very least, Aubrey seemed to be enjoying it. She sighed and grunted and bucked her hips forward as if to fuck his hand
>Spurred on by her reactions, Sunny put a bit more effort in, using his other hand to play with her balls (oh, yeah, she also had balls. it… probably would’ve been weirder if she didn’t). He was rewarded with more even moans from Aubrey
>”Fuck, Sunny…” her muttered swear and shaft throbbing in his hand were Sunny’s only warnings before she blew her load, coating his hand and her own dick in… pink. Her cum was pink. Dream bullshit, just roll with it.
>Sunny brought his hand closer to his face to examine it. It was a lighter shade than Aubrey’s hair, more like bubblegum pink than hot pink. It smelled… strangely good?
>’Might as well.’ He plunged a finger into his mouth, tasting the oddly-colored fluid. It was… good. Like, weirdly good. Sweet like candy. He greedily licked the rest of it off his hand, while Aubrey watched with a bemused look on her face
>”Enjoying yourself, Sunny?” He blushed, suddenly self-conscious about how eagerly he had just eaten her cum. “Clean me up too while you’re at it, will ya?”
>Oh, alright, now he was gonna put his mouth on her dick. There wasn’t really any hesitation at this point.
>It tasted… about how you would expect a dick to taste. Fleshy? Sure, why not.
>Dutifully, Sunny ran his tongue along her length, licking up all the sweet pink stuff that covered it. He felt Aubrey’s hand settle on his head and run through his hair. It felt… right. Really nice. It made him feel like he was doing a good job.
>”I think you got it all, Sunny…” Oh. He had gotten so caught up in the headpats that he hadn’t realized Aubrey’s shaft was already all clean. That was a little embarrassing.
>”Alright, ready for the main event?” Aubrey grinned devilishly, and Sunny barely had time to consider what ‘main event” was supposed to mean before he was forcefully flipped around on his stomach. His pants and underwear were removed, and he felt Aubrey’s tip press against his-- NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE
>Sunny attempted to spring to his feet to get away, but only succeeded in squirming ineffectually. His body had been inexplicably sapped of strength, like he had sleep paralysis, but while he was awake (but still technically asleep)
>”Wait wait wait, don’t—“
>”Hey, don’t chicken out on me now, alright? It’s a dream, so it’s not like it’s even unsanitary.”
>Well, this was it. He was getting fucked in the ass and there was no way out. The boy braced himself as he felt Aubrey’s cock enter his—

>Sunny woke up with a start. He felt out of breath for some reason.
>Mari, who was in her own bed and reading a book, glanced over at him.
>”Nightmare?” she asked.
>”Uh. Yeah… something like that.”
