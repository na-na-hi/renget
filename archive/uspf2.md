>Well, it's official
>We've gotten married
>For our honeymoon, we decided to travel the South Pacific
>My experiences are wonderful
>But then I start to worry
>It's subconscious at first
>Then a nightmare brings it to the forefront
>I catch him cheating on me with an American girl
>He admits he doesn't love me anymore
>Tells me he wants a divorce
>I wake up in a cold sweat
>Feel like crying
>I tell myself it was just a bad dream
>But I can't help but worry that it might come true
>Will we fall out of love?
>Will he stop loving me?
>Sure, we seem to be healthy now
>But there's no guarantee we'll stay that way
>They call it a "honeymoon phase" for a reason
>What will I do if he does?
>He's made my life worth living these last few years
>If he leaves, he might destroy me
>I can't go back to a life without him
>It's not long before he realizes something's wrong
>"What's the matter, honey?"
>Reluctantly, I tell him my fears
>He wraps me in a warm, tight embrace, almost knocking the flower out of my hair
>"I'd never, ever do that to you."
>"I love you too much and the thought of losing you is too painful."
>"When I said I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you, I meant it with all my heart."
>"You're the lighthouse in the storm."
>I look into his eyes and can see that he means every word
>Now I feel guilty I ever doubted him
>The dam bursts
>I start crying and apologizing profusely
>He strokes my back and murmurs comforting words in my ear
>Eventually, I cry myself out
>"You don't need to apologize. It's okay to worry. Just know that I'll always be here for you."
>Kami, how does he always know exactly how to make me feel better?
>He picks me up, princess-style, which cheers me up
>The way he makes me feel small and cute will never get old
>"Now, let's try to enjoy the rest of our honeymoon. We're more than halfway done with it, and I want to make most of the time we have left."
>I smile
>"Yes. Let's."
