### -> Roleplay Profile <-
##### EOH Name
Emily

##### One line description
Ordinary and Mundane Marionette Maid who's main interest is having a front-row seat to interesting events without dirtying her own hands with said events.

##### Personality
Unfailingly polite and obedient while on duty. Sharp-tongued and occasionally rude when she knows it won't hurt her, which is her primary form of stress relief. Dislikes Nekos.

#####  Backstory
The full backstory is flexible and gets in-character rewritten every few decades due to [Here We Go Again] and [Convenient Backstory] allowing for that. Born into service and made for the job are consistent themes, with the primary variation being who she serves and where she lives. Emily chooses maid work as a way to have an in with interesting and powerful people while not standing out.

For roleplay purposes, the details tend to be in a state of undefined flux and/or just have Emily currently attached to Selene depending on who I'm talking to and the details of the scene.

##### Goals
See the world, see interesting events, avoid stressful and dangerous things to the extent she can while prioritizing the first two. Likes seeing people succeed with big goals and grand designs, regardless of good or evil.

##### Violence Comfort Level
Out of character ok with pretty much anything here, but Emily is primarily a non-combatant (And is relatively low-power when she does fight), and I am uninterested in breaking that aspect of her character to put her in situations where this answer matters.

##### Lewd Okay?
Yes, but expect an apathetic in-character partner and a mediocre writer.

##### Kinks, Specifics (optional)
The usual set of things such as guro, scat, and ntr/cuckolding are off limits. Other than that, I can at least attempt to roll with most things.
