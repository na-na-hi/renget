>the mall hired you on as a technician
>you knew how to hold a wrench and that pretty much qualified you
>the place was dying and desperate for new hands
>especially ones that would work for minimum wage
>so you were a wagie
>needed to pay the bills somehow
>as it turned out Fazbears whatever was still clinging to life
>how many lawsuits and shady shit they got into
>this time they'd branched out into leasing out the face of their properties 
>merchandise and shit
>cheaper than having a physical attraction
>just slap t shirts or shitty vinyl figures out there
>or just mass produce the robots
>that's where you came in
>see Roxanne the character had a following
>just enough to create demand
>sure she wasn't out Freddie's level of popularity 
>but she was more popular than the rabbit currently
>so your mall had purchased a robot
>plastered in a mass produced shell
>top of the line
>one small issue about your mall's Roxanne...

>with a mass production, faults sometimes pop up
>really it was impressive that the robots were as capable as they were
>and the technology was used for an entertainment industry
>a pizza chain, a fucking pizza chain, turned science fiction into reality
>wasn't too long ago you'd seen footage of robots that could barely count as bipedal
>to say nothing of what advances in AI you saw
>you weren't exactly some engineer or computer whiz
>you could maybe put together a PC if pressed to do it
>all your mechanical knowledge came from cars and what experience you could scrape together to bluff through here
>the AI was the really impressive thing
>no idea why a pizza mascot needed it but Roxanne was impressive 
>sometimes you almost felt like the robot was just a coworker
>one you had to diagnose like the kiddy rides and the occasional soda machine
>Fazbear industries was at least not too worried after they sold off merchandise 
>for better or worse
>made repairs comparable to fixing a tank out in the field
>a lot of improvising 
>there was a sort of quirk with this particular model
>this AI really did function like people and over time people also develop personalities and the like
>while it was impressive, it also meant you had a wolf robot done up like a female glam rock star who insisted he was a guy
>no idea how to handle that, you didn't like the idea of "correcting" the AI
>not that you knew how
>so your mall's Roxanne was a guy
>just a quirk
>you'd heard of other robots getting weird
>granted, the robot's chassis wasn't like what you'd seen elsewhere
>didn't have the stock female body the other's seemed to have
>his body wasn't built like a fridge like some of the older models, even had a sleeker edge about him
>while he still towered over some, there was a leaner shape to him that took away a little of the intimidation factor 
>also had a few other things you quite hadn't seen before with a robot
>maybe Fazbear had more intimate entertainment in mind for some models
>his body had male genitalia and a backdoor hidden under a metal pelvic plate
>you felt like it was above your pay grade and never had an inclination to ask
>you didn't dare ask Roxanne either
>sometimes it felt like a patient/doctor relationship and it felt easier with time to start thinking of Roxy as less an it and more a he

>Roxy over time had become less unsettling to be around
>your initial shock at his size and weight had faded fairly quickly
>then you'd started thinking of him as just a machine
>but that was undone when you saw how like he could be
>maybe you watched too much Robocop 
>you could swear there was a spark there
>he still freaked out a few of your coworkers
>security guards wouldn't last night shifts because the robot gave them the creeps 
>your indifference around Roxy was noticed and more than once they asked you to cover a shift
>money was decent so why not
>boss basically gave you a flashlight and you'd pull double duty
>the mall wasn't particularly impressive or vast but it was in a shittier neighborhood that had seen better days
>never did replace the department store that shut down on one wing
>the place was decaying and Roxy and a few other purchases were meant to breath a little life into the place
>the shifts also helped because you'd be around at night more than a few times with repairs to the mall's
>you didn't know how to fix toilets before this 
>well you sure as hell knew now
>keeping the stage that Roxy used in working order was a point of pride for you though
>Roxy weighed a bit over 300 lbs and to have that robot dancing and jumping on stage like Van Halen, it needed to be tough
>this was dirty work but you'd made a difference 
>Roxy actually thanked you when he remembered to
>you saw how giddy he was with crowds 
>was it all programed or did he learn to enjoy entertaining 
>you had little idea how he worked there
>he even overcame his little insecurities out on stage
>and woo boy did the robot have baggage
>sometimes you really felt like a doctor here
>even if he only performed for like 3 kids he was content
>it was clear as daylight the place was on its last legs and all this was a gamble
>hopefully it would pay off
>at least the money was decent
>there was usually plenty to keep you occupied during the day shift as super/mechanic
>something gone wrong here and there
>you were pretty sure you shouldn't be handling the wiring but the mall didn't want to hire someone "official"
>every day felt like some new challenge thrown in your lap 
>and you managed
>for someone that essentially bluffed through your resume you did end up having a knack for it
>there was some touch and go here and there
>Roxy nearly falling over on you while in sleep mode, nearly flying yourself with the jewelry store lighting, the escalator incident in the old department store
>all isolated incidents you didn't need to report to higher ups
>you sort of got along with your coworkers 
>you eventually started to include a wolf into that circle
>it was hard to just dismiss him as a machine 
>you weren't one for philosophy 
>but you wagered Roxanne was something
>not just just some robot performing a task
>he was too complex for that
>more than once on night shifts he'd want to accompany you on the security rounds
>just to have someone to talk to
>maybe you were nuts and assigning humanity to something that imitated it
>but you weren't here for such contemplation 
>you were paid to fix shit and make sure no one broke in overnight
>why the guards were more scared of Roxy than the mall at night you didn't know
>in fact you welcomed the company
>his eyes glowing in the dark were a good sign to you
>it meant you weren't alone in here
>in a good way of course
>there were issues 
>mostly Roxy didn't understand personal space in off hours
>he was professional with an audience 
>his solo stage show usually didn't have the stage swarmed but he was good with kids after the meet and greet
>you wanted to beat the hell out of snotty teenager that thought spray painting the robot was a good idea
>you were buffing and shining Roxy's chest for hours
>but Roxanne treated the vandalism in stride
>at night he seemed to be on free roam
>like the time he thought it was appropriate to burst into the bathroom with you at the urinal 
>nothing like a goddamn jumpscare while trying to take a piss
>very convenient 
>you had to lay out that the bathroom was a no go zone
>he agreed but looked like a chastised puppy
>after washing your hands and escorting him out you explained it was just polite
>the mall might take issue
>"it's not fair though"
>you weren't prepared for that line
>what did he mean?
>"you've seen mine and I haven't seen yours."
>yours?
>the eyes glanced down to your pants
>oh no
>so you had to lay out personal space that night
>you had seen "his" because you needed to repair and maintain him
>how did he know you saw "his" anyways?
>was his sleep mode not an actual sleep mode?
>you didn't really have anyone to turn to with this
>Fazbear's just essentially dropped him off at the mall after they got their money
>you wondered just how quirky this AI could be
>another busy day had you going over Roxy's diagnostics 
>weekly maintenance 
>after that incident with the bathroom you figured what was the point with flipping him off
>you reasoned maybe it was unfair to operate on him without his consent 
>if you had to see "his" it didn't feel right shutting him down for it
>you would be uncomfortable if someone touched your body while you were unconscious 
>besides, maybe talking through the work might make it fun for him
>you had unlatched his chest to work on his internals 
>he watched you with curiosity 
>his face was narrower than the base Roxy model
>that was a thing you noticed studying him over the course of your work
>it was less like a goofy robot face
>hard to describe 
>maybe… friendlier?
>softer?
>maybe because you were working closer with him over the months
>he was already very different than the floor model
>you had realized how much more organic he looked compared to the stock models you'd seen elsewhere 
>maybe it was all tied to his special equipment 
>you didn't have a lot to go by and you didn't feel it was appropriate to ask
>he was a coworker
>you didn't ask a coworker about his dick
>his metal chest piece clamped back on easy enough
>everything under the hood seemed in working order
>you dusted off the fur on his shoulders
>despite the metal and plastic shell, he had fur where there wasn't access panels
>it was fake of course
>but meant you weren't constantly touching cool metal or plastic
>sort of like a sleeve over the chassis, or maybe part of it?
>you had little experience with it
>not like people had fuzzy cars or washing machines
>it was difficult to clean but you managed, you wanted him presentable 
>cleaning him was part of repairs after all
>even down to brushing that giant mop of hair
>whatever Fazbear made him out of was a miracle
>sometimes you remarked on that and you'd never seen someone so giddy about praise 
>any sort of praise from you seemed to make him brighten up
>after the maintenance you wanted rest
>having learned from past experience, you ended up bringing a sleeping bag 
>you could get away with a nap on your night shifts and sometimes you took it
>no cameras on the inside meant camping out wherever you liked
>usually by the fountain that only worked occasionally 
>the running water was pleasant to fall asleep to
>you had excused yourself to go rest when Roxy spoke up
>"you could sleep here," the robot gestured to the stage 
>an odd proposal 
>why? 
>he patted the spot next to him on the stage
>well it was weird but you felt it would be rude to turn down the offer
>perhaps you'd worked with Roxanne so much you'd begun to sympathize 
>anthropomorphize him
>it was hard to just write him off as a machine
>not after being around his company
>hell you'd even referred to him as him and not it for what felt like ages now
>maybe due to your close proximity to him
>your coworkers didn't seem to share your opinion on the matter
>but you didn't mind them much
>so it was difficult to ignore his request you nap on stage
>why not
>about as comfortable as the floor anyways
>you'd do rounds after an hour or so of shut eye
>Roxy sat on the stage, his legs dangling off it and gently kicking at the air as he observed you
>it was hard to get an idea of what he was thinking
>you understood he thought, felt
>but the whole machine thing was a barrier 
>while you'd warmed up to him better than your coworkers you still felt he was a mystery
>when he offered his lap as a pillow you politely declined
>the offer was appreciated but you felt it was inappropriate 
>there was the personal space thing again
>besides you had doubts his thigh would be all that comfortable for your neck
>you compromised and laid next to him
>he tried to give you a disappointed puppy look and goddamn it worked
>at least he was satisfied with your head next to his hip
>you bundled up in your sleeping bag
>at least you'd have some rest
>pressure on your chest made you crack one eye open
>a paw rested on you and Roxy made no effort to move it
>the lean arm still had enough strength to trap you in that spot if he wanted
>but he didn't want that
>”get some rest,” his normally energetic voice was lower, softer
>he was normally a firecracker when he was performing and sometimes off stage
>this was a side no one really got to see but you 
>either they didn't bother or Roxy spooked them
>he hummed some quiet tune down to you while patting you through the sleeping bag 
>was he trying to comfort you?
>lull you sleep?
>he was good with kids
>did that care extend that easily to you?
>maybe because you took care of him?
>he was just supposed to be a coworker
>personal boundaries 
>but this was actually sort of nice
>you pondered it a little but you decided to take his advice
>one little indulgence couldn't hurt
>running around for 16 hrs on no energy was a bad idea
>with Roxy plugged into the mall power for recharging he couldn't go anywhere either
>he gently rocked you to sleep 
>when you awoke you felt fucking amazing 
>”I let you sleep an extra hour. don't be mad, ok?”
>but your phone alarm?
>he put it on your chest as you wiped the crust from your eyes
>his cocky energy came back
>”what did I tell you about sleeping here? I was right, right? of course I was.”
>you scoffed a little
>so it was better than tile floor
>not much of a high bar 
>he hadn't moved from that spot
>”come on, let's go.”
>he seemed excited to tour the exact same mall you both saw the night before
>it's like being excited to see your bedroom for the thousandth time
>not that you saw your bed much nowadays 
>oh well
>”wait,” he remarked
>you had gotten up and your turned to look at him
>”how's my hair?”
>he fluffed at it with his paws, trying to get a feel for the ridiculous volume of it
>he looked fine
>at least as far as you could see
>was he trying to smile?
>he looked earnest 
>his hands moved down to his lap after he fluffed his hair up enough to satisfy himself
>if you didn't know any better you could swear he was trying to pose
>so fine, his hair looked good
>”just good?”
>fine, it looked… amazing?
>”that's better.”
>he hopped off the stage, absolutely beaming
>at least as far as you could see
>definitely liked praise
>you followed suit and hopped off the stage as well
>he pointed to his back
>”can you do me?”
>you did a double take before you realized he referred to his power cable
>it was connected to a socket right above his tail
>you removed it and slapped the latch back over the socket
>you had both needed the recharge it seemed
>well, you decided it was time to patrol
>the soft hiss of pistons and clink of metal on tile followed you down the darkened mall walkway 
>stores on both sides of you two sometimes played tricks with the shadows
>the empty stores were the worst though
>because technically they counted as part of your little jurisdiction 
>they had a be sweeped to any squatters 
>at least the robot taller than you provided comfort and a sense of security 
>he did make good company for this stuff
>the little noises his body consoled you as you went from each dark empty storefront and backroom
>occasionally he wanted to talk
>no idea why he was always hung up on asking if you thought he was pretty that day
>well, night
>but he made decent company regardless
>occasionally he'd bump into you as you checked out a room or turned a corner
>he was like a puppy tonight
>occasionally he'd want to look through stores 
>you'd take tours in some of them, given you had the keys
>normally you wouldn't be curious but outside of interactions with you he was mostly confined to that stage
>so you'd indulge him onyour walks sometimes
>you came across one of those novelty shops
>one of those places that sells bongs, fake faded Fazbear t shirts and tacky jewelry 
>none of the shirts would fit him but alright
>you'd seen the shit all the time
>but again, you reasoned he really hadn't 
>he seemed interested, it was more fascinating than the pretzel shop
>you flicked the lights on and let him explore
>big mistake
>the store was decent size
>about 30 feet wide and 60 feet set back
>the didn't need much stock room space
>usually the stuff sat on shelves for ages
>a key detail you forgot was the sex toys shoved into the back of the store next to the black lights and bongs
>this wasn't a kids store after al
>this was a very big mistake
>so of course Roxy came back holding a dildo 
>of course that had to be the first thing he saw and grabbed in here
>you weren't about to have a talking to from management about the children's entertained asking about fake dicks
>you snatched it from his paws and set it back
>he picked up a fleshlight and looked through it like a telescope
>this time he played keep away >given that he was taller than you it was an easier task
>”what are these for?” 
>this was not coworker discussion 
>you gave up trying to swipe the sex toy out of his hand after trying to jump for it felt humiliating
>or so he thought
>the second he let his guard down you climbed up him and grabbed it
>then you realized one small issue
>getting down after you scampered up him like a monkey
>paws grabbed your shirt and he set you down
>you were relieved he was approaching this calmly
>then he snatched the fleshlight back and ended up getting his claws in it like a Chinese finger trap
>you facepalmed as he grinned at you, proud of his attempt at prop comedy
>or maybe he legitimately didn't know what this stuff was
>hard to say
>you weren't in a hurry to clarify for him though
>again, management would probably have your ass 
>when you finally nabbed it back and set it back on a shelf you hoped that was the end of it
>he pointed to another fake penis 
>”is yours like that?”
>nope
>not doing this
>trying to lead someone bigger than you away from the section was easier said than done
>you had a feeling he knew what he was doing
>trying to get a rise out of you
>though he was probably still a little innocent
>not like his career let him have much experience in this field
>an obvious joke about groupies aside
>you finally enticed him by finding a Roxanne wolf novelty shirt
>sure she wasn't him, but he appreciated the attention 
>enough to finally drag him away from the allure of the sexy toy section
>the shirt was basic, one of those graphic tees
>a close up of a cartoon version Roxanne’s face with “let's rock” under it
>he looked a little perplexed 
>even between the shirt and him there were differences 
>he stroked his chin looking at you holding it up
>well at least he forgot about the naughty stuff for a moment
>you weren't paid enough to go over the birds and the bees with anyone
>”not exactly perfect but close enough,” he commented to himself mostly
>”so are you putting it on?”
>what
>you didn't have that intent
>it was just a distraction
>not that you said that aloud
>he looked down at you expectantly 
>fine 
>you'd wear the shirt
>but only for tonight
>you pulled your shirt off and could have sworn you caught him looking you over
>the Roxanne shirt on, he seemed satisfied 
>”see now the shirt looks better already”
>you decided to take your leave from the novelty store and Roxy followed
>he was chipper, more than usual
>the rest of the night went well
>shitty neighborhood or not, Roxy was welcome company
>you didn't know if he could actually make good on his height and strength but it would be a good deterrent 
>no more detours after the sex toy incident 
>you took another nap up on stage
>the second time he pleaded just enough you said fine to using his lap as a pillow
>you'd indulge him just this once
>maybe you were both touch starved enough to think it would be fine
>your head was wedged between his thighs and you passed out with him quietly watching over you
>sun cracked through the doors and you checked your phone first thing when you woke up
>your shift was almost done 
>glancing up, it seemed like Roxy put himself into sleep mode too
>when you got up he noticed immediately 
>you took off the Roxanne shirt with the intention of returning it but Roxy requested it instead
>you didn't need to hear about stolen merchandise 
>so fine, but you'd pay the store for it later
>make up some lie about needing a new shirt 
>he would just have to hide it under the stage or something until tonight 
>you stretched and then slapped on your old shirt
>the staff would trickle in slowly and that meant customers eventually
>Roxy would no doubt have a few shows
>you would be back late in the afternoon and explained as much
>”see you then,” his voice made it sound like a request
>you didn't imagine that
>yes you'd see him then
>he pulled you into a hug that threatened your ribs

>next shift you paid for the shirt, told your lie
>no one batted an eye
>Roxy was seen as a prop by most of the staff
>hell most didn't even know how weird he got
>usually you were front row and center for that
>thank God management never picked up any quirks
>you had occasionally sat down with Roxy and laid out rules to protect him
>tonight might be a discussion on borrowing 
>the store staff almost didn't buy the lie
>in fact, you almost got in trouble for possible theft
>trying to do the honest thing got you in more hot water than if you had just ignored it
>oh well
>the mall didn't have too many mechanic/custodian/night guards so you were a valuable commodity 
>after putting out various fires across the mall in the evening you took a small break
>Roxanne was doing a show for all of like three kids
>but he seemed happy
>you'd have to help him tune the guitar a little tonight
>it sounded off
>amazing to think a pizza chain built a robot dexterous enough to play guitar
>then just kept that technology to themselves
>thankfully the labor force wasn't flooded with Fazbear robots
>he really was a technical marvel
>but you wouldn't want to praise him too much
>at least openly
>one time he ended up wanting you to pat his head
>you had to give him the headpat the one time
>but you refused to say he was a “good boy” 
>thank God this place never had interior cameras
>still, you took a moment to savor the job
>as shitty as the neighborhood around it had become
>as emptied out as the place seemed
>for every crack that seemed to pop up when you sealed another
>it was peaceful
>half decent money
>and experience 
>last one sounded sort of like a boomer thing but you legitimately had to learn plumbing on the fly like a medic wrist deep in a chest cavity 
>multiple showers later you could proudly admit you did that
>you could understand why pride was a big thing to Roxy
>he really did like being the best 
>sometimes got a little too competitive about it but not the worst hang up
>you still wondered about his build
>watching him on stage from next to the pretzel stand, he just moved so differently than you'd imagine
>he was just so limber
>despite his weight and height he could move like a dancer 
>and there was another mid air split that rattled the stage
>you'd have to slip down there tonight and inspect the bolts
>you made small talk with the pretzel stand lady as you ate
>your dinner was a small box of nuggets and cheese
>with a lemonade to wash it down
>not the wisest choice for a meal but it was there and fast
>otherwise you'd sit down at the Chinese buffet for an hour
>then it would be worth the money
>but you didn't want to just be openly spending an hour doing nothing at this job
>management was lax but not that lax
>pretzel lady, Carol, was a bit older
>friendly sort all things considered, she'd been at the mall for a decade or so 
>retail day in and out wasn't for you
>people could be tiring 
>Carol sometimes could come off at too friendly though
>you could swear when she playfully ruffled your hair that Roxanne’s head instantly snapped to look over to you
>you didn't know how to react to that but Carol went back to gossip and Roxanne seemed to soften back up
>you were the only one that seemed to catch that
>when you started it was hard to imagine a robot could emote like a human 
>but that was definitely a look
>no idea why
>it felt defensive
>maybe you read too much into it
>he did end up finishing his set and the mall was close to closing for the night
>part of the reason you took break around this tine was because it was last call for food
>you got the cord ready to charge up Roxy and he sat down next to you on the edge of the stage
>”so who was that?”
>who was who?
>”the woman that touched you?”
>so you hasn't imagined that earlier
>well Carol was just a coworker
>she ran the pretzel stand
>she worked around him all the time 
>”oh OK. I don't usually pay attention to your coworkers.”
>he just decided now he needed to mess with your hair 
>you checked around to make sure you weren't getting stares before letting him though
>”she really shouldn't do that.”
>clawed dexterous fingers went about fixing your hair
>at least until he was satisfied 
>you didn't feel much different
>he released your head and once you were sure everything around was closed down, you pulled a thick blanket from under the stage
>you went across the stage and grabbed his electric guitar 
>you'd tune it back up and then you'd grab a nap while Roxanne recharged
>he approved and went into sleep mode to charge faster
>your phone went off and you stretched
>you realized Roxanne wasn't where he went to sleep mode and you grew a little concerned
>how do you lose a giant robot that slept next to you
>you got up and looked around 
>scanning the stage, you saw nothing
>you folded the blanket and threw it back under the stage
>you called out with no response
>well that was concerning 
>you called out again
>he was probably doing something mischievous 
>but you worried about possibly a malfunction 
>there still was stuff you felt you didn't know about his machinery 
>so you started checking the obvious spots
>then when that turned up nothing you checked the less obvious spots
>it's not like he'd have a reason to walk into the bathroom or a kitchen area
>you eventually found him near the theater
>he looked spooked that he found him
>like he was trying to hide something
>you weren't really great at security because you just decided to write it off
>what trouble could he get up to?
>so the next evening Carol was asking if you'd known who went through her locker in the back of the pretzel place
>she said stuff was not where she placed it the night before
>everything looked like it had been rummaged through
>you asked if anything had been stolen and thankfully no
>you'd keep an eye out tonight and swore it wouldn't happen again
>you tried not to make it obvious you were staring daggers at the robot wolf on stage
>after hours you confronted him
>it didn't take a detective to realize what happened
>there were only two of you in the mall last night and you had passed out for a while
>Roxy was a bit taken aback
>he looked a little defeated
>he mumbled something down at the ground and you insisted he speak up
>this wasn't something that could be brushed over
>if something like this happened again you'd maybe be fired
>that made him shoot back up
>”fired?”
>yeah, as in no job here
>he pulled you into a hug and started frantically apologizing 
>you felt like a teddy bear held by an upset child
>you'd swear he was acting like you would be executed 
>when he finally regained his composure he set you back down
>was he… crying?
>what the hell was Fazbear building over there?
>you had to be firm though
>no more nonsense like that or your job was on the line
>you could be easily replaced
>”you aren't replaceable.”
>you were unaccustomed to him like this 
>he had leaned forward and now poked your chest with one finger
>”you aren't expendable, got it?”
>he'd gone from looking guilty to the closest thing to anger you'd ever seen
>it was your turn to shrink back a little
>you'd never seen that glare before
>ok fine fine you weren't replaceable 
>but if he kept rummaging like that you'd probably get kicked to the curb either for the security breach or because he was acting quirky
>it would come down on your head
>that calmed him down and he apologized 
>you did have to ask again just what he was doing with Carol's locker?
>he'd never done that before
>he finally replied clearly this time
>”I just wanted to make sure she wouldn't hurt you.”
>hurt you?
>your backbone returned after the dress down
>you didn't have to speak so much as he read the intent on your face
>”you know.”
>no
>no you didn't know
>he wasn't helping his case
>finally he dismissed everything with a wave of his hand
>”fine, I promise not to rummage through Carol's locker again. now come on, don't you want to sleep with me?”
>the wolf plopped down on the edge of the stage and tried giving a smile
>well this didn't answer things but he wasn't being forthcoming
>pressing him now probably wouldn't get much more
>so you'd play along
>however, you couldn't rest 
>he looked disappointed, even pouted to the best of his ability
>why did he know how to pout
>”why not?”
>the lobby lighting in the theater needed to be fixed
>management actually splurged and you had to replace a bunch of bulbs
>you figured tonight would be a good time for it since the place would be empty and you didn't have to worry about your ladder being in the way
>he could rest
>”nope. let's go change lightbulbs.”
>you figured that would be the response you'd get
>you wouldn't push the subject
>he would tag along regardless 
>at least he promised no more weird shit
>your job was secure
>hopefully Carol would drop the locker thing
>if not you'd have to think up a convincing lie
>but you really didn't have one
>maybe a kid snuck into the mall?
>she could easily check that
>as far as she knew you were the only suspect
>most people didn't bother spending much 1 on 1 time with Roxanne as you did
>blaming another staff member would be shitty
>you didn't like everyone here but the last thing you wanted was anyone fired
>spooky ghost?
>possible
>for now you just hoped she dropped it
>you'd grabbed the bulbs and the ladder
>with any luck this would be done quickly 
>Roxanne set up the ladder at the first sign with burnt out bulbs
>you climbed and started going to work
>occasionally you'd have him flick the lights to see what flashed on
>you were able to work pretty fast
>within 20 minutes you had done 4 signs completely
>on the 5th you got all the way up and lost your footing
>falling backward, you tried and failed to reach out for anything
>instead of smashing your spine on the floor, you realized you'd been scooped up
>Roxanne looked down at you nonchalant, like he didn't just save your back
>he set you back on the ladder and let you go back to work
>that gesture was appreciated 
>you probably wouldn't be completely crippled but damn that would have at least hurt
>he just held you up like nothing
>well, you'd never be hearing the end of it about working alone now
>he kept watch from below and he'd hand up spare bulbs as you went
>within an hour the theater signs looked pristine 
>they needed cleaning but that was more on some hapless employee not manning the popcorn machine
>so now you could rest a little
>he insisted on carrying the ladder and got excited when you decided to nap
>God he was strange
>well whatever
>while you took his word you were still a little suspicious 
>you'd use his leg as a pillow
>it wasn't the most comfortable position but he wouldn't get up to mischief without waking you
>when you suggested it he turned into a stammering mess briefly before regaining his composure 
>the stage experience probably helped 
>it wasn't exactly professional behavior between coworkers but again, you really needed to make sure he didn't do anything he and you would regret
>you grabbed your blanket and plugged him in and you both got some rest 
>your ploy worked and he didn't move thankfully
>he didn't immediately turn back on but the second you tried to rise an arm shot forward and held you by your chest to his thigh 
>he didn't even open his eyes
>must have felt the pressure 
>but was he still resting?
>you had no idea 
>he didn't let go
>well whatever
>you relaxed and stayed where you were
>the rest of your shift was spent pressed to Roxanne’s lap
>he didn't seem to want to move
>well, he didn't get into trouble
>the mall was safe
>it was a win at least
>he only really relaxed around sun up
>his leg was not the worst pillow
>surprisingly soft thanks to the fur
>you still didn't understand his construction 
>but it did feel good on your neck
>you didn't know why he was so insistent you stayed there
>so you asked
>he finally opened his eyes
>”you needed rest and I wanted to make sure you got it.”
>but work?
>”aren't you here to make sure I'm working as intended?”
>what did that have to do with this?
>”well a rockstar can't have his groupie too tired to work”
>the word he was looking for was roadie
>roadies were support staff
>”groupie”

>Roxy was insistent on the groupie nickname
>why, you didn't know
>but eventually you dropped it
>he took that as a sign to start calling you that
>thank God he confined it to off the clock hours from then on
>a new issue had arose in the mall the next day or so
>more like opportunity 
>the mall couldn't get a Santa for an affordable rate
>you had no idea if the Santa's unionized or whatever
>might be the mall being cheap again
>your janitorial/maintenence shifts during December would be instead be dedicated to being the mall Santa
>every mall had to have one
>they even just handed you some sort of slap dash red felt dress for the elf
>you held up the giant dress and asked who the elf was, Andre the Giant
>but you knew
>they knew
>cheap as ever
>well, at least Roxanne was good with kids
>you'd need the help 
>you were shocked they even went through the effort of a dress
>granted, it was red basic fabric with a white collar around the whole thing
>Roxy eyed it suspiciously 
>afraid it would hurt his cool image
>if you were dressing as Santa he was putting on the dress
>when he rolled his eyes you knew you'd won
>”fine… but I'm not an elf.”
>he was much too tall for that 
>as long as he put on the outfit he could call himself Jesus for all you cared
>”I'm going as Mrs. Claus.”
>ok the kids were going to wonder why Mrs. Claus was a giant wolf
>”they'd wonder why Santa had a giant wolf elf.”
>ok
>it was petty but he had as much a point
>he poked your chest
>”plus I wasn't going to let Santa have top billing. this is a co-production”
>you pondered if it was too late to pluck some manlet up for elf duty
>Danny at the Foot Locker was small enough
>just pick him up and then you'd have a helper 
>it could be that easy
>Roxanne interrupted the kidnapping plan
>”also a consideration, my pointy ears are in the wrong place to be an elf. yeah, Mrs. Claus is just a better idea.”
>he rested his hands on his hips awaiting your concession
>this was only going to end if you bestowed Mrs. Claus on him
>kidnapping looked better than dealing with his smug grin
>the alternative was he'd pull the puppy dog routine
>it was rarer
>but he'd pull it
>you'd seen it just once when you wouldn't brush his hair out
>why was he even ok with wearing a dress?
>he insisted he was a he whenever possible
>”well, you asked. bit different than just saying I'm Roxanne”
>but 
>he waved a clawed hand
>”you know what I mean. Roxanne might be the best but I'm the best Roxanne.”
>well whatever that meant
>”I'm doing you a favor and the least you can do is say I co-own this north pole.”
>his thumb gestured behind him to the small snowy display tree and fake reindeer 
>fine
>if that's what it took
>he could be Mrs. Claus
>”see, I knew you could do it,” he grinned
>yep, you knew that would happen
>got what he wanted
>so he took the dress and slid it over 
>it was a simple strapless affair
>after all it was a budget thing
>he realized it was super tight at the hips
>how?
>he was a guy
>guy robot
>it went down to the middle of his thigh
>he struggled for a second then used a single claw on each side of the dress to open a vertical slit that allowed his legs to breath a little
>you weren't going to lecture him on mall property 
>as long as it got results 
>the first day the mall set up for Christmas felt like any other
>you'd helped hang up giant snowflakes and the radio was tuned to Christmas music 24/7 but otherwise there wasn't a dramatic shift at the place
>your shift as Santa began fairly early
>uneventful 
>the Mrs. Claus bit was seen through quickly enough
>they were kids, not blind
>Roxy was still good to them though
>the Mrs. Claus act wasn't helped by the addition of an electric guitar 
>though his instrumental versions of some Christmas music were appreciated over hearing jingle bells again
>he sat down near the tree, cross legged and focusing on the instrument and then to whatever kid scrambled up to you
>then back to a quiet rendition of Little Drummer Boy or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer 
>he even played it softer than usual, a feat you didn't realize he was capable of
>Roxy usually didn't do things softer
>he loved the crowds and would try to get them energetic 
>but here he understood the atmosphere and played accordingly
>your heart wasn't completely in this at first but some of the kids were actually making you feel optimistic 
>sure there were a few brats
>but the vibe was… actually cheerful
>a more cynical sort might chalk the children's cheer up to wanting gifts
>but maybe they were just happy for the season
>you'd bought candy out of pocket for them and it just felt… right
>you hadn't felt nostalgic for Christmas before but the whole situation made you look back fondly
>a lot of upheaval in your life
>but here it sort of clicked
>it felt correct
>not that you weren't needed around here but this was different than scrubbing toilets
>after the day and your shift you allowed yourself to pull the beard and fake glasses off
>you didn't bring a spare set of clothes so you'd do the security shift as Santa
>everyone left and soon enough it was Roxy and you again tonight
>you had to admit the new chair by the tree was comfortable 
>you might nap in it
>Roxanne had other plans and your lap and the chair were threatened by what felt like a ton of wolf robot
>”oh come on, they got to sit in your lap and ask you for stuff,” he protested as you tried to push him off
>he relented but not without you shoving him back
>you really had to put your weight behind it
>explaining the physical difference between little Timmy and a robot you had to look up to would fall on deaf ears
>what mattered was he wasn't getting what someone else had and he felt it was an injustice in this world
>he even did a little mock sniveling
>you knew that was fake
>all a trick to garner sympathy 
>you got up and made sure nothing was broken on you or the chair
>he'd gone from dejected to pouty within seconds
>you had to point out the chair was not as sturdy as the stage and that was your mistake
>he picked you up by the sides and moved you to sit on the stage and sat down on your lap, trapping you
>he seemed to exert more control to not just crush you outright
>”now where were we~”
>he glanced over his shoulder to make sure you were alive and continued
>”well I could use a new amp…”
>that was frankly shocking
>it was simple and straightforward 
>”but I'm not all that greedy. why ask for things?”
>his tail wagged 
>beating you in the face a few times 
>he raised a hand and you wondered just where he found mistletoe?
>how the hell did he know about mistletoe?
>he released your legs and stood up, dangling the green decoration above your head
>his grin was triumphant 
>surely this was victory
>Roxanne had planned this
>it was brilliant
>the amp request to catch you off guard then he suckered punched you with this festive obligation 
>”I really am the best,” he congratulated himself
>he was busy patting himself on the back when you chimed in and remarked you were both guys
>”and I'm clearly in a dress so it's fine right?”
>when you handed him the dress you didn't expect it to be weaponized against you
>”aren't we husband and wife? aren't we supposed to kiss? come on, you know you want to”
>he was either confused on how stage personas worked or-
>no, he wasn't confused
>he leaned in close, leading you to lean back in response
>the smile hadn't left his face because he felt victorious 
>you tried to counter with office decorum
>coworkers shouldn't do this
>”you gonna tell HR?”
>the other hand not holding the mistletoe lifted your chin up with one finger
>”you look better without the beard”
>you were trying to work out how to get out of this
>you were pretty sure he could just take a kiss 
>but he was wanting you to make the move
>fine
>you went to give him a peck on the cheek when his hand stopped your chin
>”c'mon rock stars don't get kissed like grandma do they?”
>his eyes were focused on yours
>you had a feeling he wouldn't take no
>well he might
>but you felt strongly discouraged 
>the claws helped
>he grinned 
>teeth
>your eyes darted there
>finally, you caved
>you really were an enabler 
>you gave him a kiss and he leaned into it
>no tongue, he wasn't that forceful 
>but he seemed to savor it
>you relaxed a little and kept the kiss going 
>maybe after this he would be satisfied 
>at least this wasn't bad
>but this was only a one time thing only
>you'd have to put your foot down
>he pushed you back onto the stage and the mistletoe was tossed aside
>the kiss kept going
>your resistance was waning
>eventually you ended up admitting defeat by planting an arm around Roxy's shoulder
>you could hear his tail wagging
>his tongue slipped past your lips and he locked fingers with your free hand
>this was wrong but you couldn't help yourself 
>fuck it
>this was a Christmas bonus
>you'd just have to keep this to yourself 
>but this was a one time thing
>as nice as it was it could get you in trouble
>Roxanne liked the attention at least
>when your hand softly pet the back of his head he shivered and pinned you to the stage
>that was what made him break the kiss
>”sorry, I got a little excited there for a second”
>his eyes were half lidded
>you kissed him on the snout 
>you'd give him this for Christmas 
>at least
>he enjoyed the company and maybe you did too
>you didn't know if this would make things more awkward 
>probably would 
>he released you and pulled back
>you regained your breath and sat up
>so maybe this Christmas could be good
>Roxanne was on cloud nine 
>you were conflicted
>but he did look happy and you didn't want to spoil things tonight
>eventually you'd have to set your foot down
>you two couldn't just make out in the mall like teenagers 
>”not bad for a guy right?”
>he wanted permission, a reward
>his eyes were no longer cloudy but bright and expectant
>as much as it pained you you had to let him down gently
>you did like it but…
>he planted a clawed finger over your lips
>”unless the next words out of your mouth are how I'm the best you've ever had we aren't spoiling the moment.”
>he wasn't taking no 
>you hoped this wouldn't be an issue
>it would be but you hoped it wouldn't be
>you were optimistic 
>the mall didn't need to know you got an erection 
>Roxanne was fighting the urge to jump you
>you'd given him an erection and he was less concerned with the mall finding out
>but he was content with being the best kiss you'd ever had
>for now
>he allowed you up off the stage, satisfied with himself 
>he'd won in his mind
>and maybe you just sort of allowed that
>you probably should be more assertive with him but he'd been pleasant to be around
>so you had a soft spot for him
>it was just hard to reconcile with all the strangeness of the situation 
>he allowed you space but followed you around
>he was absolutely beaming
>you tried not to guess why
>you knew
>he was practically gloating 
>there was no way you weren't hearing the end of this
>so you got an erection
>you'd never hear the goddamn end of this
>hopefully Roxanne didn't notice that
>Roxy had noticed it
>if he looked triumphant on the exterior, he was giddy as a school girl
>he'd gotten the reaction he'd dreamed of
>ever since you'd started working around the mall he'd been excited at all the attention you'd given him
>he was crushing on your for awhile
>after all you thought he was the best
>you'd said so
>he went over that memory 
>this was worth wearing the dress and stealing that plant for
>his masterful plan had all come together
>he was busy patting himself on the back while walking the mall 
>there was that little hiccup that was the pretzel homewrecker
>but that didn't derail his plans 
>you went about your business and relaxed without the sexual tension 
>that was about the most action you'd gotten in ages 
>if he'd kept going you might have done something stupid
>thankfully, he seemed content with a kiss
>Roxy wasn't 
>but he was patient 
>eventually he'd get you
>Roxy wasn't even paying attention to what you were doing
>he was on autopilot as he dwelled on the kiss
>he'd never kissed before
>kissing was amazing
>he wanted more kissing
>among other things
>there was some stuff he was aware of
>the horny thing
>he was aware you made him want something
>but didn't have a grasp of it
>in a person that would be chalked up to instincts outpacing his knowledge 
>there was the urge
>burning hot in his core
>he just needed to know more
>he knew you felt something similar based off how hard you'd felt under your costume earlier
>so he figures he'd just ask
>”why did kissing make me hot?”
>he was aware couples kissed but not the next step
>he knew there were steps but he was a musical robot expected to interact with kids
>sex ed wasn't high up on his programming
>he had the equipment for it but not why
>you were hoping to avoid the question
>in Roxanne’s mind this was vital
>he needed the next step
>he'd be the best at it but he just needed to know what it was
>surely there'd be more
>Roxy felt the next step involved how hot he felt then
>he was legitimately curious
>you wanted to avoid the question
>distracting yourself with work was only going so far
>he looked to you eagerly
>of course he didn't know
>but how'd he know about kissing?
>"I saw couples doing it."
>right
>not like people were fucking in the mall
>this circled back to you not wanting to be the one to teach the mall attraction the birds and the bees
>he wouldn't buy the stork lie
>so you tried deflecting
>why did he even want to know?
>he snatched you up and had his arms hooked under your armpits
>"now if you want down you'll have to tell me"
>fine
>you knew he could out last you
>so fine
>sex
>you'd have sex
>he flipped you around in his grip and eyed you suspiciously
>"explain"
>no
>"I'm putting you on the tree then"
>this was ridiculous
>you tried wiggling out of his arms but he kept you tight in his grip
>he was walking over to the mall tree and you finally gave up
>you'd explain sex
>he needed to set you down though
>"no funny business."
>you tried bolting the second he set you down and he grabbed your collar
