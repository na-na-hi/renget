>the mall hired you on as a technician
>you knew how to hold a wrench and that pretty much qualified you
>the place was dying and desperate for new hands
>especially ones that would work for minimum wage
>so you were a wagie
>needed to pay the bills somehow
>as it turned out Fazbears whatever was still clinging to life
>how many lawsuits and shady shit they got into
>this time they'd branched out into leasing out the face of their properties 
>merchandise and shit
>cheaper than having a physical attraction
>just slap t shirts or shitty vinyl figures out there
>or just mass produce the robots
>that's where you came in
>see Roxanne the character had a following
>just enough to create demand
>sure she wasn't out Freddie's level of popularity 
>but she was more popular than the rabbit currently
>so your mall had purchased a robot
>plastered in a mass produced shell
>top of the line
>one small issue about your mall's Roxanne...

>with a mass production, faults sometimes pop up
>really it was impressive that the robots were as capable as they were
>and the technology was used for an entertainment industry
>a pizza chain, a fucking pizza chain, turned science fiction into reality
>wasn't too long ago you'd seen footage of robots that could barely count as bipedal
>to say nothing of what advances in AI you saw
>you weren't exactly some engineer or computer whiz
>you could maybe put together a PC if pressed to do it
>all your mechanical knowledge came from cars and what experience you could scrape together to bluff through here
>the AI was the really impressive thing
>no idea why a pizza mascot needed it but Roxanne was impressive 
>sometimes you almost felt like the robot was just a coworker
>one you had to diagnose like the kiddy rides and the occasional soda machine
>Fazbear industries was at least not too worried after they sold off merchandise 
>for better or worse
>made repairs comparable to fixing a tank out in the field
>a lot of improvising 
>there was a sort of quirk with this particular model
>this AI really did function like people and over time people also develop personalities and the like
>while it was impressive, it also meant you had a wolf robot done up like a female glam rock star who insisted he was a guy
>no idea how to handle that, you didn't like the idea of "correcting" the AI
>not that you knew how
>so your mall's Roxanne was a guy
>just a quirk
>you'd heard of other robots getting weird
>granted, the robot's chassis wasn't like what you'd seen elsewhere
>didn't have the stock female body the other's seemed to have
>his body wasn't built like a fridge like some of the older models, even had a sleeker edge about him
>while he still towered over some, there was a leaner shape to him that took away a little of the intimidation factor 
>also had a few other things you quite hadn't seen before with a robot
>maybe Fazbear had more intimate entertainment in mind for some models
>his body had male genitalia and a backdoor hidden under a metal pelvic plate
>you felt like it was above your pay grade and never had an inclination to ask
>you didn't dare ask Roxanne either
>sometimes it felt like a patient/doctor relationship and it felt easier with time to start thinking of Roxy as less an it and more a he

>Roxy over time had become less unsettling to be around
>your initial shock at his size and weight had faded fairly quickly
>then you'd started thinking of him as just a machine
>but that was undone when you saw how like he could be
>maybe you watched too much Robocop 
>you could swear there was a spark there
>he still freaked out a few of your coworkers
>security guards wouldn't last night shifts because the robot gave them the creeps 
>your indifference around Roxy was noticed and more than once they asked you to cover a shift
>money was decent so why not
>boss basically gave you a flashlight and you'd pull double duty
>the mall wasn't particularly impressive or vast but it was in a shittier neighborhood that had seen better days
>never did replace the department store that shut down on one wing
>the place was decaying and Roxy and a few other purchases were meant to breath a little life into the place
>the shifts also helped because you'd be around at night more than a few times with repairs to the mall's
>you didn't know how to fix toilets before this 
>well you sure as hell knew now
>keeping the stage that Roxy used in working order was a point of pride for you though
>Roxy weighed a bit over 300 lbs and to have that robot dancing and jumping on stage like Van Halen, it needed to be tough
>this was dirty work but you'd made a difference 
>Roxy actually thanked you when he remembered to
>you saw how giddy he was with crowds 
>was it all programed or did he learn to enjoy entertaining 
>you had little idea how he worked there
>he even overcame his little insecurities out on stage
>and woo boy did the robot have baggage
>sometimes you really felt like a doctor here
>even if he only performed for like 3 kids he was content
>it was clear as daylight the place was on its last legs and all this was a gamble
>hopefully it would pay off
>at least the money was decent
>there was usually plenty to keep you occupied during the day shift as super/mechanic
>something gone wrong here and there
>you were pretty sure you shouldn't be handling the wiring but the mall didn't want to hire someone "official"
>every day felt like some new challenge thrown in your lap 
>and you managed
>for someone that essentially bluffed through your resume you did end up having a knack for it
>there was some touch and go here and there
>Roxy nearly falling over on you while in sleep mode, nearly flying yourself with the jewelry store lighting, the escalator incident in the old department store
>all isolated incidents you didn't need to report to higher ups
>you sort of got along with your coworkers 
>you eventually started to include a wolf into that circle
>it was hard to just dismiss him as a machine 
>you weren't one for philosophy 
>but you wagered Roxanne was something
>not just just some robot performing a task
>he was too complex for that
>more than once on night shifts he'd want to accompany you on the security rounds
>just to have someone to talk to
>maybe you were nuts and assigning humanity to something that imitated it
>but you weren't here for such contemplation 
>you were paid to fix shit and make sure no one broke in overnight
>why the guards were more scared of Roxy than the mall at night you didn't know
>in fact you welcomed the company
>his eyes glowing in the dark were a good sign to you
>it meant you weren't alone in here
>in a good way of course
>there were issues 
>mostly Roxy didn't understand personal space in off hours
>he was professional with an audience 
>his solo stage show usually didn't have the stage swarmed but he was good with kids after the meet and greet
>you wanted to beat the hell out of snotty teenager that thought spray painting the robot was a good idea
>you were buffing and shining Roxy's chest for hours
>but Roxanne treated the vandalism in stride
>at night he seemed to be on free roam
>like the time he thought it was appropriate to burst into the bathroom with you at the urinal 
>nothing like a goddamn jumpscare while trying to take a piss
>very convenient 
>you had to lay out that the bathroom was a no go zone
>he agreed but looked like a chastised puppy
>after washing your hands and escorting him out you explained it was just polite
>the mall might take issue
>"it's not fair though"
>you weren't prepared for that line
>what did he mean?
>"you've seen mine and I haven't seen yours."
>yours?
>the eyes glanced down to your pants
>oh no
>so you had to lay out personal space that night
>you had seen "his" because you needed to repair and maintain him
>how did he know you saw "his" anyways?
>was his sleep mode not an actual sleep mode?
>you didn't really have anyone to turn to with this
>Fazbear's just essentially dropped him off at the mall after they got their money
>you wondered just how quirky this AI could be
>another busy day had you going over Roxy's diagnostics 
>weekly maintenance 
>after that incident with the bathroom you figured what was the point with flipping him off
>you reasoned maybe it was unfair to operate on him without his consent 
>if you had to see "his" it didn't feel right shutting him down for it
>you would be uncomfortable if someone touched your body while you were unconscious 
>besides, maybe talking through the work might make it fun for him
>you had unlatched his chest to work on his internals 
>he watched you with curiosity 
>his face was narrower than the base Roxy model
>that was a thing you noticed studying him over the course of your work
>it was less like a goofy robot face
>hard to describe 
>maybe… friendlier?
>softer?
>maybe because you were working closer with him over the months
>he was already very different than the floor model
>you had realized how much more organic he looked compared to the stock models you'd seen elsewhere 
>maybe it was all tied to his special equipment 
>you didn't have a lot to go by and you didn't feel it was appropriate to ask
>he was a coworker
>you didn't ask a coworker about his dick
>his metal chest piece clamped back on easy enough
>everything under the hood seemed in working order
>you dusted off the fur on his shoulders
>despite the metal and plastic shell, he had fur where there wasn't access panels
>it was fake of course
>but meant you weren't constantly touching cool metal or plastic
>sort of like a sleeve over the chassis, or maybe part of it?
>you had little experience with it
>not like people had fuzzy cars or washing machines
>it was difficult to clean but you managed, you wanted him presentable 
>cleaning him was part of repairs after all
>even down to brushing that giant mop of hair
>whatever Fazbear made him out of was a miracle
>sometimes you remarked on that and you'd never seen someone so giddy about praise 
>any sort of praise from you seemed to make him brighten up
>after the maintenance you wanted rest
>having learned from past experience, you ended up bringing a sleeping bag 
>you could get away with a nap on your night shifts and sometimes you took it
>no cameras on the inside meant camping out wherever you liked
>usually by the fountain that only worked occasionally 
>the running water was pleasant to fall asleep to
>you had excused yourself to go rest when Roxy spoke up
>"you could sleep here," the robot gestured to the stage 
>an odd proposal 
>why? 
>he patted the spot next to him on the stage
>well it was weird but you felt it would be rude to turn down the offer
>perhaps you'd worked with Roxanne so much you'd begun to sympathize 
>anthropomorphize him
>it was hard to just write him off as a machine
>not after being around his company
>hell you'd even referred to him as him and not it for what felt like ages now
>maybe due to your close proximity to him
>your coworkers didn't seem to share your opinion on the matter
>but you didn't mind them much
>so it was difficult to ignore his request you nap on stage
>why not
>about as comfortable as the floor anyways
>you'd do rounds after an hour or so of shut eye
>Roxy sat on the stage, his legs dangling off it and gently kicking at the air as he observed you
>it was hard to get an idea of what he was thinking
>you understood he thought, felt
>but the whole machine thing was a barrier 
>while you'd warmed up to him better than your coworkers you still felt he was a mystery
>when he offered his lap as a pillow you politely declined
>the offer was appreciated but you felt it was inappropriate 
>there was the personal space thing again
>besides you had doubts his thigh would be all that comfortable for your neck
>you compromised and laid next to him
>he tried to give you a disappointed puppy look and goddamn it worked
>at least he was satisfied with your head next to his hip
>you bundled up in your sleeping bag
>at least you'd have some rest
>pressure on your chest made you crack one eye open
>a paw rested on you and Roxy made no effort to move it
>the lean arm still had enough strength to trap you in that spot if he wanted
>but he didn't want that
>”get some rest,” his normally energetic voice was lower, softer
>he was normally a firecracker when he was performing and sometimes off stage
>this was a side no one really got to see but you 
>either they didn't bother or Roxy spooked them
>he hummed some quiet tune down to you while patting you through the sleeping bag 
>was he trying to comfort you?
>lull you sleep?
>he was good with kids
>did that care extend that easily to you?
>maybe because you took care of him?
>he was just supposed to be a coworker
>personal boundaries 
>but this was actually sort of nice
>you pondered it a little but you decided to take his advice
>one little indulgence couldn't hurt
>running around for 16 hrs on no energy was a bad idea
>with Roxy plugged into the mall power for recharging he couldn't go anywhere either
>he gently rocked you to sleep 
>when you awoke you felt fucking amazing 
>”I let you sleep an extra hour. don't be mad, ok?”
>but your phone alarm?
>he put it on your chest as you wiped the crust from your eyes
>his cocky energy came back
>”what did I tell you about sleeping here? I was right, right? of course I was.”
>you scoffed a little
>so it was better than tile floor
>not much of a high bar 
>he hadn't moved from that spot
>”come on, let's go.”
>he seemed excited to tour the exact same mall you both saw the night before
>it's like being excited to see your bedroom for the thousandth time
>not that you saw your bed much nowadays 
>oh well
>”wait,” he remarked
>you had gotten up and your turned to look at him
>”how's my hair?”
>he fluffed at it with his paws, trying to get a feel for the ridiculous volume of it
>he looked fine
>at least as far as you could see
>was he trying to smile?
>he looked earnest 
>his hands moved down to his lap after he fluffed his hair up enough to satisfy himself
>if you didn't know any better you could swear he was trying to pose
>so fine, his hair looked good
>”just good?”
>fine, it looked… amazing?
>”that's better.”
>he hopped off the stage, absolutely beaming
>at least as far as you could see
>definitely liked praise
>you followed suit and hopped off the stage as well
>he pointed to his back
>”can you do me?”
>you did a double take before you realized he referred to his power cable
>it was connected to a socket right above his tail
>you removed it and slapped the latch back over the socket
>you had both needed the recharge it seemed
>well, you decided it was time to patrol
>the soft hiss of pistons and clink of metal on tile followed you down the darkened mall walkway 
>stores on both sides of you two sometimes played tricks with the shadows
>the empty stores were the worst though
>because technically they counted as part of your little jurisdiction 
>they had a be sweeped to any squatters 
>at least the robot taller than you provided comfort and a sense of security 
>he did make good company for this stuff
>the little noises his body consoled you as you went from each dark empty storefront and backroom
>occasionally he wanted to talk
>no idea why he was always hung up on asking if you thought he was pretty that day
>well, night
>but he made decent company regardless
>occasionally he'd bump into you as you checked out a room or turned a corner
>he was like a puppy tonight
>occasionally he'd want to look through stores 
>you'd take tours in some of them, given you had the keys
>normally you wouldn't be curious but outside of interactions with you he was mostly confined to that stage
>so you'd indulge him onyour walks sometimes
>you came across one of those novelty shops
>one of those places that sells bongs, fake faded Fazbear t shirts and tacky jewelry 
>none of the shirts would fit him but alright
>you'd seen the shit all the time
>but again, you reasoned he really hadn't 
>he seemed interested, it was more fascinating than the pretzel shop
>you flicked the lights on and let him explore
>big mistake
>the store was decent size
>about 30 feet wide and 60 feet set back
>the didn't need much stock room space
>usually the stuff sat on shelves for ages
>a key detail you forgot was the sex toys shoved into the back of the store next to the black lights and bongs
>this wasn't a kids store after al
>this was a very big mistake
>so of course Roxy came back holding a dildo 
>of course that had to be the first thing he saw and grabbed in here
>you weren't about to have a talking to from management about the children's entertained asking about fake dicks
>you snatched it from his paws and set it back
>he picked up a fleshlight and looked through it like a telescope
>this time he played keep away >given that he was taller than you it was an easier task
>”what are these for?” 
>this was not coworker discussion 
>you gave up trying to swipe the sex toy out of his hand after trying to jump for it felt humiliating
>or so he thought
>the second he let his guard down you climbed up him and grabbed it
>then you realized one small issue
>getting down after you scampered up him like a monkey
>paws grabbed your shirt and he set you down
>you were relieved he was approaching this calmly
>then he snatched the fleshlight back and ended up getting his claws in it like a Chinese finger trap
>you facepalmed as he grinned at you, proud of his attempt at prop comedy
>or maybe he legitimately didn't know what this stuff was
>hard to say
>you weren't in a hurry to clarify for him though
>again, management would probably have your ass 
>when you finally nabbed it back and set it back on a shelf you hoped that was the end of it
>he pointed to another fake penis 
>”is yours like that?”
>nope
>not doing this
>trying to lead someone bigger than you away from the section was easier said than done
>you had a feeling he knew what he was doing
>trying to get a rise out of you
>though he was probably still a little innocent
>not like his career let him have much experience in this field
>an obvious joke about groupies aside
>you finally enticed him by finding a Roxanne wolf novelty shirt
>sure she wasn't him, but he appreciated the attention 
>enough to finally drag him away from the allure of the sexy toy section
>the shirt was basic, one of those graphic tees
>a close up of a cartoon version Roxanne’s face with “let's rock” under it
>he looked a little perplexed 
>even between the shirt and him there were differences 
>he stroked his chin looking at you holding it up
>well at least he forgot about the naughty stuff for a moment
>you weren't paid enough to go over the birds and the bees with anyone
>”not exactly perfect but close enough,” he commented to himself mostly
>”so are you putting it on?”
>what
>you didn't have that intent
>it was just a distraction
>not that you said that aloud
>he looked down at you expectantly 
>fine 
>you'd wear the shirt
>but only for tonight
>you pulled your shirt off and could have sworn you caught him looking you over
>the Roxanne shirt on, he seemed satisfied 
>”see now the shirt looks better already”
>you decided to take your leave from the novelty store and Roxy followed
>he was chipper, more than usual
>the rest of the night went well
>shitty neighborhood or not, Roxy was welcome company
>you didn't know if he could actually make good on his height and strength but it would be a good deterrent 
>no more detours after the sex toy incident 
>you took another nap up on stage
>the second time he pleaded just enough you said fine to using his lap as a pillow
>you'd indulge him just this once
>maybe you were both touch starved enough to think it would be fine
>your head was wedged between his thighs and you passed out with him quietly watching over you
>sun cracked through the doors and you checked your phone first thing when you woke up
>your shift was almost done 
>glancing up, it seemed like Roxy put himself into sleep mode too
>when you got up he noticed immediately 
>you took off the Roxanne shirt with the intention of returning it but Roxy requested it instead
>you didn't need to hear about stolen merchandise 
>so fine, but you'd pay the store for it later
>make up some lie about needing a new shirt 
>he would just have to hide it under the stage or something until tonight 
>you stretched and then slapped on your old shirt
>the staff would trickle in slowly and that meant customers eventually
>Roxy would no doubt have a few shows
>you would be back late in the afternoon and explained as much
>”see you then,” his voice made it sound like a request
>you didn't imagine that
>yes you'd see him then
>he pulled you into a hug that threatened your ribs

>next shift you paid for the shirt, told your lie
>no one batted an eye
>Roxy was seen as a prop by most of the staff
>hell most didn't even know how weird he got
>usually you were front row and center for that
>thank God management never picked up any quirks
>you had occasionally sat down with Roxy and laid out rules to protect him
>tonight might be a discussion on borrowing 
>the store staff almost didn't buy the lie
>in fact, you almost got in trouble for possible theft
>trying to do the honest thing got you in more hot water than if you had just ignored it
>oh well
>the mall didn't have too many mechanic/custodian/night guards so you were a valuable commodity 
>after putting out various fires across the mall in the evening you took a small break
>Roxanne was doing a show for all of like three kids
>but he seemed happy
>you'd have to help him tune the guitar a little tonight
>it sounded off
>amazing to think a pizza chain built a robot dexterous enough to play guitar
>then just kept that technology to themselves
>thankfully the labor force wasn't flooded with Fazbear robots
>he really was a technical marvel
>but you wouldn't want to praise him too much
>at least openly
>one time he ended up wanting you to pat his head
>you had to give him the headpat the one time
>but you refused to say he was a “good boy” 
>thank God this place never had interior cameras
>still, you took a moment to savor the job
>as shitty as the neighborhood around it had become
>as emptied out as the place seemed
>for every crack that seemed to pop up when you sealed another
>it was peaceful
>half decent money
>and experience 
>last one sounded sort of like a boomer thing but you legitimately had to learn plumbing on the fly like a medic wrist deep in a chest cavity 
>multiple showers later you could proudly admit you did that
>you could understand why pride was a big thing to Roxy
>he really did like being the best 
>sometimes got a little too competitive about it but not the worst hang up
>you still wondered about his build
>watching him on stage from next to the pretzel stand, he just moved so differently than you'd imagine
>he was just so limber
>despite his weight and height he could move like a dancer 
>and there was another mid air split that rattled the stage
>you'd have to slip down there tonight and inspect the bolts
>you made small talk with the pretzel stand lady as you ate
>your dinner was a small box of nuggets and cheese
>with a lemonade to wash it down
>not the wisest choice for a meal but it was there and fast
>otherwise you'd sit down at the Chinese buffet for an hour
>then it would be worth the money
>but you didn't want to just be openly spending an hour doing nothing at this job
>management was lax but not that lax
>pretzel lady, Carol, was a bit older
>friendly sort all things considered, she'd been at the mall for a decade or so 
>retail day in and out wasn't for you
>people could be tiring 
>Carol sometimes could come off at too friendly though
>you could swear when she playfully ruffled your hair that Roxanne’s head instantly snapped to look over to you
>you didn't know how to react to that but Carol went back to gossip and Roxanne seemed to soften back up
>you were the only one that seemed to catch that
>when you started it was hard to imagine a robot could emote like a human 
>but that was definitely a look
>no idea why
>it felt defensive
>maybe you read too much into it
>he did end up finishing his set and the mall was close to closing for the night
>part of the reason you took break around this tine was because it was last call for food
>you got the cord ready to charge up Roxy and he sat down next to you on the edge of the stage
>”so who was that?”
>who was who?
>”the woman that touched you?”
>so you hasn't imagined that earlier
>well Carol was just a coworker
>she ran the pretzel stand
>she worked around him all the time 
>”oh OK. I don't usually pay attention to your coworkers.”
>he just decided now he needed to mess with your hair 
>you checked around to make sure you weren't getting stares before letting him though
>”she really shouldn't do that.”
>clawed dexterous fingers went about fixing your hair
>at least until he was satisfied 
>you didn't feel much different
>he released your head and once you were sure everything around was closed down, you pulled a thick blanket from under the stage
>you went across the stage and grabbed his electric guitar 
>you'd tune it back up and then you'd grab a nap while Roxanne recharged
>he approved and went into sleep mode to charge faster
>your phone went off and you stretched
>you realized Roxanne wasn't where he went to sleep mode and you grew a little concerned
>how do you lose a giant robot that slept next to you
>you got up and looked around 
>scanning the stage, you saw nothing
>you folded the blanket and threw it back under the stage
>you called out with no response
>well that was concerning 
>you called out again
>he was probably doing something mischievous 
>but you worried about possibly a malfunction 
>there still was stuff you felt you didn't know about his machinery 
>so you started checking the obvious spots
>then when that turned up nothing you checked the less obvious spots
>it's not like he'd have a reason to walk into the bathroom or a kitchen area
>you eventually found him near the theater
>he looked spooked that he found him
>like he was trying to hide something
>you weren't really great at security because you just decided to write it off
>what trouble could he get up to?
>so the next evening Carol was asking if you'd known who went through her locker in the back of the pretzel place
>she said stuff was not where she placed it the night before
>everything looked like it had been rummaged through
>you asked if anything had been stolen and thankfully no
>you'd keep an eye out tonight and swore it wouldn't happen again
>you tried not to make it obvious you were staring daggers at the robot wolf on stage
>after hours you confronted him
>it didn't take a detective to realize what happened
>there were only two of you in the mall last night and you had passed out for a while
>Roxy was a bit taken aback
>he looked a little defeated
>he mumbled something down at the ground and you insisted he speak up
>this wasn't something that could be brushed over
>if something like this happened again you'd maybe be fired
>that made him shoot back up
>”fired?”
>yeah, as in no job here
>he pulled you into a hug and started frantically apologizing 
>you felt like a teddy bear held by an upset child
>you'd swear he was acting like you would be executed 
>when he finally regained his composure he set you back down
>was he… crying?
>what the hell was Fazbear building over there?
>you had to be firm though
>no more nonsense like that or your job was on the line
>you could be easily replaced
>”you aren't replaceable.”
>you were unaccustomed to him like this 
>he had leaned forward and now poked your chest with one finger
>”you aren't expendable, got it?”
>he'd gone from looking guilty to the closest thing to anger you'd ever seen
>it was your turn to shrink back a little
>you'd never seen that glare before
>ok fine fine you weren't replaceable 
>but if he kept rummaging like that you'd probably get kicked to the curb either for the security breach or because he was acting quirky
>it would come down on your head
>that calmed him down and he apologized 
>you did have to ask again just what he was doing with Carol's locker?
>he'd never done that before
>he finally replied clearly this time
>”I just wanted to make sure she wouldn't hurt you.”
>hurt you?
>your backbone returned after the dress down
>you didn't have to speak so much as he read the intent on your face
>”you know.”
>no
>no you didn't know
>he wasn't helping his case
>finally he dismissed everything with a wave of his hand
>”fine, I promise not to rummage through Carol's locker again. now come on, don't you want to sleep with me?”
>the wolf plopped down on the edge of the stage and tried giving a smile
>well this didn't answer things but he wasn't being forthcoming
>pressing him now probably wouldn't get much more
>so you'd play along
>however, you couldn't rest 
>he looked disappointed, even pouted to the best of his ability
>why did he know how to pout
>”why not?”
>the lobby lighting in the theater needed to be fixed
>management actually splurged and you had to replace a bunch of bulbs
>you figured tonight would be a good time for it since the place would be empty and you didn't have to worry about your ladder being in the way
>he could rest
>”nope. let's go change lightbulbs.”
>you figured that would be the response you'd get
>you wouldn't push the subject
>he would tag along regardless 
>at least he promised no more weird shit
>your job was secure
>hopefully Carol would drop the locker thing
>if not you'd have to think up a convincing lie
>but you really didn't have one
>maybe a kid snuck into the mall?
>she could easily check that
>as far as she knew you were the only suspect
>most people didn't bother spending much 1 on 1 time with Roxanne as you did
>blaming another staff member would be shitty
>you didn't like everyone here but the last thing you wanted was anyone fired
>spooky ghost?
>possible
>for now you just hoped she dropped it
>you'd grabbed the bulbs and the ladder
>with any luck this would be done quickly 
>Roxanne set up the ladder at the first sign with burnt out bulbs
>you climbed and started going to work
>occasionally you'd have him flick the lights to see what flashed on
>you were able to work pretty fast
>within 20 minutes you had done 4 signs completely
>on the 5th you got all the way up and lost your footing
>falling backward, you tried and failed to reach out for anything
>instead of smashing your spine on the floor, you realized you'd been scooped up
>Roxanne looked down at you nonchalant, like he didn't just save your back
>he set you back on the ladder and let you go back to work
>that gesture was appreciated 
>you probably wouldn't be completely crippled but damn that would have at least hurt
>he just held you up like nothing
>well, you'd never be hearing the end of it about working alone now
>he kept watch from below and he'd hand up spare bulbs as you went
>within an hour the theater signs looked pristine 
>they needed cleaning but that was more on some hapless employee not manning the popcorn machine
>so now you could rest a little
>he insisted on carrying the ladder and got excited when you decided to nap
>God he was strange
>well whatever
>while you took his word you were still a little suspicious 
>you'd use his leg as a pillow
>it wasn't the most comfortable position but he wouldn't get up to mischief without waking you
>when you suggested it he turned into a stammering mess briefly before regaining his composure 
>the stage experience probably helped 
>it wasn't exactly professional behavior between coworkers but again, you really needed to make sure he didn't do anything he and you would regret
>you grabbed your blanket and plugged him in and you both got some rest 
>your ploy worked and he didn't move thankfully
>he didn't immediately turn back on but the second you tried to rise an arm shot forward and held you by your chest to his thigh 
>he didn't even open his eyes
>must have felt the pressure 
>but was he still resting?
>you had no idea 
>he didn't let go
>well whatever
>you relaxed and stayed where you were
>the rest of your shift was spent pressed to Roxanne’s lap
>he didn't seem to want to move
>well, he didn't get into trouble
>the mall was safe
>it was a win at least
>he only really relaxed around sun up
>his leg was not the worst pillow
>surprisingly soft thanks to the fur
>you still didn't understand his construction 
>but it did feel good on your neck
>you didn't know why he was so insistent you stayed there
>so you asked
>he finally opened his eyes
>”you needed rest and I wanted to make sure you got it.”
>but work?
>”aren't you here to make sure I'm working as intended?”
>what did that have to do with this?
>”well a rockstar can't have his groupie too tired to work”
>the word he was looking for was roadie
>roadies were support staff
>”groupie”

>Roxy was insistent on the groupie nickname
>why, you didn't know
>but eventually you dropped it
>he took that as a sign to start calling you that
>thank God he confined it to off the clock hours from then on
>a new issue had arose in the mall the next day or so
>more like opportunity 
>the mall couldn't get a Santa for an affordable rate
>you had no idea if the Santa's unionized or whatever
>might be the mall being cheap again
>your janitorial/maintenence shifts during December would be instead be dedicated to being the mall Santa
>every mall had to have one
>they even just handed you some sort of slap dash red felt dress for the elf
>you held up the giant dress and asked who the elf was, Andre the Giant
>but you knew
>they knew
>cheap as ever
>well, at least Roxanne was good with kids
>you'd need the help 
>you were shocked they even went through the effort of a dress
>granted, it was red basic fabric with a white collar around the whole thing
>Roxy eyed it suspiciously 
>afraid it would hurt his cool image
>if you were dressing as Santa he was putting on the dress
>when he rolled his eyes you knew you'd won
>”fine… but I'm not an elf.”
>he was much too tall for that 
>as long as he put on the outfit he could call himself Jesus for all you cared
>”I'm going as Mrs. Claus.”
>ok the kids were going to wonder why Mrs. Claus was a giant wolf
>”they'd wonder why Santa had a giant wolf elf.”
>ok
>it was petty but he had as much a point
>he poked your chest
>”plus I wasn't going to let Santa have top billing. this is a co-production”
>you pondered if it was too late to pluck some manlet up for elf duty
>Danny at the Foot Locker was small enough
>just pick him up and then you'd have a helper 
>it could be that easy
>Roxanne interrupted the kidnapping plan
>”also a consideration, my pointy ears are in the wrong place to be an elf. yeah, Mrs. Claus is just a better idea.”
>he rested his hands on his hips awaiting your concession
>this was only going to end if you bestowed Mrs. Claus on him
>kidnapping looked better than dealing with his smug grin
>the alternative was he'd pull the puppy dog routine
>it was rarer
>but he'd pull it
>you'd seen it just once when you wouldn't brush his hair out
>why was he even ok with wearing a dress?
>he insisted he was a he whenever possible
>”well, you asked. bit different than just saying I'm Roxanne”
>but 
>he waved a clawed hand
>”you know what I mean. Roxanne might be the best but I'm the best Roxanne.”
>well whatever that meant
>”I'm doing you a favor and the least you can do is say I co-own this north pole.”
>his thumb gestured behind him to the small snowy display tree and fake reindeer 
>fine
>if that's what it took
>he could be Mrs. Claus
>”see, I knew you could do it,” he grinned
>yep, you knew that would happen
>got what he wanted
>so he took the dress and slid it over 
>it was a simple strapless affair
>after all it was a budget thing
>he realized it was super tight at the hips
>how?
>he was a guy
>guy robot
>it went down to the middle of his thigh
>he struggled for a second then used a single claw on each side of the dress to open a vertical slit that allowed his legs to breath a little
>you weren't going to lecture him on mall property 
>as long as it got results 
>the first day the mall set up for Christmas felt like any other
>you'd helped hang up giant snowflakes and the radio was tuned to Christmas music 24/7 but otherwise there wasn't a dramatic shift at the place
>your shift as Santa began fairly early
>uneventful 
>the Mrs. Claus bit was seen through quickly enough
>they were kids, not blind
>Roxy was still good to them though
>the Mrs. Claus act wasn't helped by the addition of an electric guitar 
>though his instrumental versions of some Christmas music were appreciated over hearing jingle bells again
>he sat down near the tree, cross legged and focusing on the instrument and then to whatever kid scrambled up to you
>then back to a quiet rendition of Little Drummer Boy or Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer 
>he even played it softer than usual, a feat you didn't realize he was capable of
>Roxy usually didn't do things softer
>he loved the crowds and would try to get them energetic 
>but here he understood the atmosphere and played accordingly
>your heart wasn't completely in this at first but some of the kids were actually making you feel optimistic 
>sure there were a few brats
>but the vibe was… actually cheerful
>a more cynical sort might chalk the children's cheer up to wanting gifts
>but maybe they were just happy for the season
>you'd bought candy out of pocket for them and it just felt… right
>you hadn't felt nostalgic for Christmas before but the whole situation made you look back fondly
>a lot of upheaval in your life
>but here it sort of clicked
>it felt correct
>not that you weren't needed around here but this was different than scrubbing toilets
>after the day and your shift you allowed yourself to pull the beard and fake glasses off
>you didn't bring a spare set of clothes so you'd do the security shift as Santa
>everyone left and soon enough it was Roxy and you again tonight
>you had to admit the new chair by the tree was comfortable 
>you might nap in it
>Roxanne had other plans and your lap and the chair were threatened by what felt like a ton of wolf robot
>”oh come on, they got to sit in your lap and ask you for stuff,” he protested as you tried to push him off
>he relented but not without you shoving him back
>you really had to put your weight behind it
>explaining the physical difference between little Timmy and a robot you had to look up to would fall on deaf ears
>what mattered was he wasn't getting what someone else had and he felt it was an injustice in this world
>he even did a little mock sniveling
>you knew that was fake
>all a trick to garner sympathy 
>you got up and made sure nothing was broken on you or the chair
>he'd gone from dejected to pouty within seconds
>you had to point out the chair was not as sturdy as the stage and that was your mistake
>he picked you up by the sides and moved you to sit on the stage and sat down on your lap, trapping you
>he seemed to exert more control to not just crush you outright
>”now where were we~”
>he glanced over his shoulder to make sure you were alive and continued
>”well I could use a new amp…”
>that was frankly shocking
>it was simple and straightforward 
>”but I'm not all that greedy. why ask for things?”
>his tail wagged 
>beating you in the face a few times 
>he raised a hand and you wondered just where he found mistletoe?
>how the hell did he know about mistletoe?
>he released your legs and stood up, dangling the green decoration above your head
>his grin was triumphant 
>surely this was victory
>Roxanne had planned this
>it was brilliant
>the amp request to catch you off guard then he suckered punched you with this festive obligation 
>”I really am the best,” he congratulated himself
>he was busy patting himself on the back when you chimed in and remarked you were both guys
>”and I'm clearly in a dress so it's fine right?”
>when you handed him the dress you didn't expect it to be weaponized against you
>”aren't we husband and wife? aren't we supposed to kiss? come on, you know you want to”
>he was either confused on how stage personas worked or-
>no, he wasn't confused
>he leaned in close, leading you to lean back in response
>the smile hadn't left his face because he felt victorious 
>you tried to counter with office decorum
>coworkers shouldn't do this
>”you gonna tell HR?”
>the other hand not holding the mistletoe lifted your chin up with one finger
>”you look better without the beard”
>you were trying to work out how to get out of this
>you were pretty sure he could just take a kiss 
>but he was wanting you to make the move
>fine
>you went to give him a peck on the cheek when his hand stopped your chin
>”c'mon rock stars don't get kissed like grandma do they?”
>his eyes were focused on yours
>you had a feeling he wouldn't take no
>well he might
>but you felt strongly discouraged 
>the claws helped
>he grinned 
>teeth
>your eyes darted there
>finally, you caved
>you really were an enabler 
>you gave him a kiss and he leaned into it
>no tongue, he wasn't that forceful 
>but he seemed to savor it
>you relaxed a little and kept the kiss going 
>maybe after this he would be satisfied 
>at least this wasn't bad
>but this was only a one time thing only
>you'd have to put your foot down
>he pushed you back onto the stage and the mistletoe was tossed aside
>the kiss kept going
>your resistance was waning
>eventually you ended up admitting defeat by planting an arm around Roxy's shoulder
>you could hear his tail wagging
>his tongue slipped past your lips and he locked fingers with your free hand
>this was wrong but you couldn't help yourself 
>fuck it
>this was a Christmas bonus
>you'd just have to keep this to yourself 
>but this was a one time thing
>as nice as it was it could get you in trouble
>Roxanne liked the attention at least
>when your hand softly pet the back of his head he shivered and pinned you to the stage
>that was what made him break the kiss
>”sorry, I got a little excited there for a second”
>his eyes were half lidded
>you kissed him on the snout 
>you'd give him this for Christmas 
>at least
>he enjoyed the company and maybe you did too
>you didn't know if this would make things more awkward 
>probably would 
>he released you and pulled back
>you regained your breath and sat up
>so maybe this Christmas could be good
>Roxanne was on cloud nine 
>you were conflicted
>but he did look happy and you didn't want to spoil things tonight
>eventually you'd have to set your foot down
>you two couldn't just make out in the mall like teenagers 
>”not bad for a guy right?”
>he wanted permission, a reward
>his eyes were no longer cloudy but bright and expectant
>as much as it pained you you had to let him down gently
>you did like it but…
>he planted a clawed finger over your lips
>”unless the next words out of your mouth are how I'm the best you've ever had we aren't spoiling the moment.”
>he wasn't taking no 
>you hoped this wouldn't be an issue
>it would be but you hoped it wouldn't be
>you were optimistic 
>the mall didn't need to know you got an erection 
>Roxanne was fighting the urge to jump you
>you'd given him an erection and he was less concerned with the mall finding out
>but he was content with being the best kiss you'd ever had
>for now
>he allowed you up off the stage, satisfied with himself 
>he'd won in his mind
>and maybe you just sort of allowed that
>you probably should be more assertive with him but he'd been pleasant to be around
>so you had a soft spot for him
>it was just hard to reconcile with all the strangeness of the situation 
>he allowed you space but followed you around
>he was absolutely beaming
>you tried not to guess why
>you knew
>he was practically gloating 
>there was no way you weren't hearing the end of this
>so you got an erection
>you'd never hear the goddamn end of this
>hopefully Roxanne didn't notice that
>Roxy had noticed it
>if he looked triumphant on the exterior, he was giddy as a school girl
>he'd gotten the reaction he'd dreamed of
>ever since you'd started working around the mall he'd been excited at all the attention you'd given him
>he was crushing on your for awhile
>after all you thought he was the best
>you'd said so
>he went over that memory 
>this was worth wearing the dress and stealing that plant for
>his masterful plan had all come together
>he was busy patting himself on the back while walking the mall 
>there was that little hiccup that was the pretzel homewrecker
>but that didn't derail his plans 
>you went about your business and relaxed without the sexual tension 
>that was about the most action you'd gotten in ages 
>if he'd kept going you might have done something stupid
>thankfully, he seemed content with a kiss
>Roxy wasn't 
>but he was patient 
>eventually he'd get you
>Roxy wasn't even paying attention to what you were doing
>he was on autopilot as he dwelled on the kiss
>he'd never kissed before
>kissing was amazing
>he wanted more kissing
>among other things
>there was some stuff he was aware of
>the horny thing
>he was aware you made him want something
>but didn't have a grasp of it
>in a person that would be chalked up to instincts outpacing his knowledge 
>there was the urge
>burning hot in his core
>he just needed to know more
>he knew you felt something similar based off how hard you'd felt under your costume earlier
>so he figures he'd just ask
>”why did kissing make me hot?”
>he was aware couples kissed but not the next step
>he knew there were steps but he was a musical robot expected to interact with kids
>sex ed wasn't high up on his programming
>he had the equipment for it but not why
>you were hoping to avoid the question
>in Roxanne’s mind this was vital
>he needed the next step
>he'd be the best at it but he just needed to know what it was
>surely there'd be more
>Roxy felt the next step involved how hot he felt then
>he was legitimately curious
>you wanted to avoid the question
>distracting yourself with work was only going so far
>he looked to you eagerly
>of course he didn't know
>but how'd he know about kissing?
>"I saw couples doing it."
>right
>not like people were fucking in the mall
>this circled back to you not wanting to be the one to teach the mall attraction the birds and the bees
>he wouldn't buy the stork lie
>so you tried deflecting
>why did he even want to know?
>he snatched you up and had his arms hooked under your armpits
>"now if you want down you'll have to tell me"
>fine
>you knew he could out last you
>so fine
>sex
>you'd have sex
>he flipped you around in his grip and eyed you suspiciously
>"explain"
>no
>"I'm putting you on the tree then"
>this was ridiculous
>you tried wiggling out of his arms but he kept you tight in his grip
>he was walking over to the mall tree and you finally gave up
>you'd explain sex
>he needed to set you down though
>"no funny business."
>you tried bolting the second he set you down and he grabbed your collar

>the CIA couldn't torture you for that information 
>you knew, just knew, that Roxanne would use the knowledge 
>you'd be handing him the gun that would be pointed at your head
>so no, you weren't explaining sex to him
>true to his word he attempted to hang you up in the tree with the utmost care
>but that threat was empty when he realized it wouldn't work
>so he resorted to a plan B which amounted to rubbing you in the bristles of the tree while demanding the answer
>he was like a really ineffective Batman
>”come on,” he whined
>it was funny to see this side of Roxanne with the cool front he usually put up
>you tried not laughing, not knowing if that would hurt or improve your odds here
>but the urge to laugh at him frantically just trying to figure out how two guys fuck while you're lodged in a Christmas tree was too much
>he heard you laughing and immediately you realized that was a mistake 
>he brought you down and glared
>”so the tree didn't work, huh.”
>of course having you French a plastic pine tree didn't work
>Roxanne was stumped, but too stubborn and frustrated to show it
>he didn't want to actually rough you up
>and you knew it
>then a toothy grin flashed on his face
>that was not a smile to be trusted
>he gently set your boots on the ground
>you had no idea what he was cooking up but it was wicked
>maybe if you explained to him about naughty and nice
>it was the season
>he wasn't letting go though
>in fact he was pushing you backwards towards the floor
>”so, I was thinking…”
>that pearly white grin flashed bigger
>”I've been holding you in the opposite direction.”
>you tried squirming as he placed you gently upon the carpet of the Santa display
>he moved to plant a foot on your chest and you felt like a bug right now
>at least he wouldn't hurt you 
>he'd resort to playground bullying techniques but actually harming you was out of the question
>he was far, far too gentle for that
>trying to get a hand hold on the floor while his foot pinned you was difficult 
>his interrogation techniques weren't going to work
>he narrowed his eyes and stared into yours
>then pointed a finger down at you as he stood above you
>”I swear if I have to sit on you I'll do it”
>he didn't press his foot down, satisfied he'd won
>you hated to admit defeat but he was going to be stubborn
>you asked him if he'd keep this secret
>he pouted, hands on his hips
>this could get you fired
>did he want you to get fired?
>he softened up at that
>that was his weakness
>you didn't press on it too much but times were dire
>if things escalated you'd never be able to come to the mall again
>when you pointed that out he quit his bullying
>why did he even want to know?
>he released his foot
>”is it so bad I like you?”
>well he couldn't have made it more obvious
>you knew he liked you 
>but you hoped maybe he'd grow out of it
>that didn't seem like the case
>he let off your chest and picked you up by the collar
>he allowed you space
>he seriously liked you?
>”duh”
>he put you in a headlock and rustled your hair
>”of course I like you dummy”
>he quickly released you
>”so how do we do it?”
>there was no getting out of this
>he'd keep pestering and in an endless cycle if you kept blowing it off
>so fine
>you gestured him to lean in
>why you felt the need to whisper it you didn't know
>perhaps the whole thing felt taboo enough to warrant it
>he thankfully complied with no argument
>you gave him all the information and he listened intently, his ear occasionally flicking as you talked
>he'd nod and once in a while gasp
>it wasn't a long explanation 
>it didn't really need to be
>you expected him to immediately try for it
>instead he wrapped an arm over your shoulder
>”now why did you think I'd tell everyone about that?”
>he kept super close to your face
>you were just worried about your job
>”you really think I'm giving up the chance to do a couple of those things in a bathroom stall by talking?”
>he poked up chest with one claw
>”no no, you just found yourself a new job. my roadie”
>he swept his hand through the air
>you didn't know if he legit got the terms confused or he was just screwing with you
>both were possible
>he really wouldn't spill the beans on this?
>”of course”
>he patted your chest
>”I told you you weren't replaceable, didn't I?”
>he released you and the peck he gave your head was shockingly tender
>again, you really were the only one who got to see this side to Roxanne
>he never even made himself this vulnerable around his kid audience
>just to you
>why you?
>you had to ask that
>why was he like this with you?
>”you're my favorite.”
>favorite?
>he realized something then stepped back to wiggle out of the dress
>you protested and he told you to calm down
>”I'm not going to jump you…yet”
>the dress was discarded onto the stage and he stretched 
>arching his back, arms above his head
>a dramatic full body stretch that caught your eye until you realized he had been watching
>his eyes glancing towards you while you thought he was facing away from you
>that was testing the waters 
>”hah caught you”
>his smile returned
>maybe this wouldn't be so bad
>you allowed yourself to relax
>perhaps
>this job wasn't too bad
>that night ended up being uneventful 
>Roxy was as good as his word and didn't push
>he was already practically glued to your hip 
>it was just like normal
>just with that weight hanging on your shoulders now
>he kissed you 
>you liked it
>explained how to do more
>you'd handed him the noose to hang yourself with
>but he didn't seem to want to weaponize it
>you hadn't had an active love life
>maybe he thought you two were an item now
>maybe you were
>you didn't know
>but at least he wouldn't brag
>this might be an issue later 
>but maybe you should embrace it a little
>not like you were getting much action 
>you still didn't get what he saw in you but oh well
>best to roll with it 
>maybe it really was a bonus
>Christmas came and went and he was friendly as could be in private 
>true to his word he maintained a level of professionalism during work hours though
>off hours he had begun just outright treating you like a plush teddy bear
>you started to see him as more attractive the more friendly he'd become
>perhaps it was some strange form of Stockholm syndrome 
>maybe you were becoming prison gay for a robot
>he wasn't attempting at seduction
>you'd just find yourself lingering on his hips occasionally
>he did start looking a bit more womanly in your eyes
>you didn't consider yourself into guys
>but did Roxanne count?
>him kissing you was a turn on 
>you were dealing with feelings and you had no idea how to approach this
>you dwelled on it
>your life was the job 
>but maybe you could have both
>Roxanne was pleasant to be around
>so maybe it wasn't so bad
>one night you decided to try it
>it couldn't hurt could it?
>maybe 
>well you decided to push your luck a little 
>everyone had cleared out as usual and it was just you two 
>the usual resting time you decided to push a little
>you pat your leg for him to lay on you for a change
>he wagged his tail but tried hard to play it cool
>that night he rested in your lap and you allowed yourself to relax
>amazingly, you didn't lose your job
>you probably shouldn't encourage him
>but you were starting to enjoy the idea
>sure it wasn't conventional 
>but he was pleasant enough company and it made work easier
>you just ended up doing all your regular shift stuff
>just with a different level of intimacy between you and Roxanne 
>you already had considered him more than just a stage robot
>you still were confused at the infatuation but in a way you sort of got it
>you were a link to the outside world and you were friendly with him off hours
>maybe he was prison gay for you
>the surprising thing was he didn't push more for sex
>he was content with hugs and the occasional kiss
>you'd worried you'd created a future sex crazed monster yet he was just happy for intimacy 
>falling asleep on top of you became a new variant on your night shifts
>multiple times you were just pulled into a bear hug and learned to sleep like that
>no one suspected anything 
>and you were relieved by that
>Roxanne understood the risk of getting caught and contented himself with snuggling up to you while everyone was gone
>work settled into a nice monotony again, just with a bonus
>you were definitely finding him more attractive now
>he knew it
>but it was harder not to notice now
>he really was girly
>despite the height he just had a sort of softness 
>you would occasionally wonder just what those hidden part could do
>would you be the one to push things into sex?
>a thought had come to you 
>maybe he was wanting you to make the first move
>it was true he was more passive than a giant robot normally would 
>he was peculiar 
>you hoped he was a sub
>otherwise your pelvis was as risk
>he seemed like it
>hard to tell with no sexual contact
>but the bossy thing usually melted away the second he got affection
>he just started wagging his tail the second you stopped playing hard to get
>that trended towards him being submissive
>you didn't know how a lot of this worked
>you'd dated girls before so this was out of your wheelhouse
>and those usually went bad
>maybe there was a reason for that
>but you wouldn't let that happen here
>it was hard to describe how you felt with him but you didn't want to hurt him
>you didn't know if you could break his heart but you didn't want to find out if it was possible
>your talk a while back gave you an idea
>you didn't dare buy one from the mall
>thank God the internet allows you to buy things privately
>you waited for the night shift and you'd specifically brought a lunch box today
>you'd bought a fleshlight 
>he looked at it strangely
>when you took him to the bathroom, then he put things together
>tonight you'd indulge a little a see where things went
>he let you take the lead and you kissed him
>you felt his arms wrap around your shoulders as you pressed him to the tile wall
>his snout made things harder
>but you both didn't care 
>clumsy tongues 
>it was official 
>after enough time from that Christmas kiss
>you actually could say you liked this
>the blood rushing to your crotch said you did and you couldn't argue with it now
>you broke the kiss to breath and leaned into Roxy
>”I was wondering what took you so long.”
>he rested his head on yours then ventured his arms down to your waist and pulled you close
>mentally, Roxanne was happy as could be
>finally he'd gotten you to reciprocate 
>he was relieved 
>”so what's your little surprise for?”
>when you started explaining, Roxanne was fighting the urge to show he was more excited 
>in his mind he was happy
>finally
>it was hard not to push but he wanted you to make the first move
>partially due to inexperience but also the fact that he wanted you to want it
>it was a relief to him that you actually did like him
>he'd been secretly hoping for more
>the cuddling was nice
>scratch that, it was amazing
>but Roxanne couldn't help but be curious about what else couples did
>he still shocked himself thinking about that
>you two were a couple now
>all he'd known was this little mall and you were the first person that didn't just treat him like furniture 
>the kids appreciated Roxanne
>maybe
>hard to tell with some of them
>but you'd been different 
>special
>his tail wagged between his legs as his imagination filled in the blanks
>this was that sex stuff
>he'd no doubt be your favorite after the sex stuff
>you had struggled to think of a good first step after kissing 
>with a girl it would be second base right?
>he did have a chest under the shell
>no idea why a stage robot had nipples 
>but you didn't think all this was 1:1 with a girl
>you didn't want to overwhelm him with anal sex right away
>plus you were sort of worried about jamming your dick in there without knowing what it could do
>you'd seen enough internet 
>for now you wanted to do something that would confirm both of you want this
>you kissed Roxy's throat as you undid his frame
>you'd learned about all the latches ages ago
>it was like undoing a girl's bra by now
>his chest plate placed on the bathroom sink, you worked on undoing his pelvic plates
>they latched together from both sides
>Roxanne was a little embarrassed, yet he couldn't place why
>but it was with you
>that meant it was good
>a turgid cock popped free when you undid the latches
>you'd never seen it erect before
>had you done that?
>you looked down at it
>a fat knot at the base throbbed
>his “skin” was a soft mystery material and blue in color
>it complimented the purples and greys across the wolf
>ending in a tapered tip, it had to be eight inches
>relative to his height that was sort of average you guessed
>what the hell was Fazbear building?
>above your head Roxanne had different thoughts
>”he's looking at it! why is he looking at it? is it small? was it too big? does he like smaller?”
>his mind was racing and he caught himself in the sink mirror
>he looked over the sight of you two hugging like this and his arms clenched around you tighter
>he had stage fright
>you were oblivious to Roxanne’s newfound panic
>he hugged you tighter but otherwise he hadn't said much more
>Roxanne was spiraling into a dozen little insecurities 
>he knew this sex stuff was important and he liked you looking at him
>but he also felt nervous for some reason
>out of courtesy you started undoing your belt and your pants and that brought Roxy back to reality
>he wanted to see
>he was nervous as could be but curiosity overpowered any inferiority complex
>your erection smacked against his and his cock twitched in response 
>so good news
>that mistletoe kiss wasn't a fluke
>your dick did respond to Roxy
>and clearly his responded to you
>Roxanne’s anxiety started to go away when you went back to kissing his throat 
>you wondered how much he could actually feel
>maybe it was just the action that pleased him and not the sensation 
>Roxanne was giddy again
>you liked him
>he saw it with your dick
>you liked HIM
>he resisted the urge to pick you up and squeeze you into a hug
>he was happy 
>his eyes went back to the mirror and he eyed you up and down while you entertained yourself with the nape of his neck
>this was actually happening
>he felt amazing now
>so this was that sex stuff
>the cool air of the bathroom over his exposed parts mixed with the heat of your body
>he felt like somewhere deep in him this was it
>whatever amounted to instincts in his mind egged him on
>he loved this
>love you
>you wanted to sex him
>the idea still floored him a little
>he didn't think he'd get this far
>hell, months ago he didn't know this far existed 
>he hadn't thought of his manhood for most of his existence and now you were softly rubbing on it with your own
>Roxanne couldn't stop his tail from wagging if he wanted to 
>Roxanne still had doubts 
>but was eager to let you take the lead
>he had performance anxiety but he thought maybe the easiest way to deal with it was submit 
>you seemed to know what you were doing and he'd just found out what his own dick was for
>he stroked his clawed fingers along the small of your back while your own hands braced over his shell
>you didn't figure he had sensors along the hard parts of his body but his swollen dick told you some sort of sensors were in there
>Fazbear should have included a manual with their shipments
>that company did seem to just wing it 
>at least now you were getting more hands on experience 
>Roxanne felt like he was burning up
>this was amazing 
>he whined when feeling your cock rub against his
>he had no idea why he was leaking from it
>occasionally he'd be aware of other sensations 
>the protrusions on his chest stiffened
>the slightest brush against them felt like a shock through his body
>and what you described as an ass
>well, it twitched
>he didn't know why it did that but it would
>his body was excited for the first time and he had the barest grasp of why but he loved it
>you made him excited
>he was still worried about pleasing you but he was enjoying the sensory overload too much 
>he hoped you were enjoying him as much as he was enjoying you
>Roxanne had almost forgotten the surprise you had gotten
>you hadn't though
>you blindly grabbed for the toy and lube off the sink
>it was behind you and you didn't feel like breaking contact with the wolf
>you stopped thinking of Roxanne as a robot despite all the soft noises he was making and how peculiar he felt
>it was just Roxy to you now
>he was a guy like you
>and as it turned out you were into him
>maybe he was the singular focus of your sexuality 
>you couldn't even say you liked guys all that much
>but Roxanne seemed to be the exception
>maybe you were a weirdo
>but you knew you liked this and that kiss and affection wasn't just a fluke
>when you stopped to coat the toy and yourselves Roxanne perked up
>of course he'd have no idea about this but you'd seen videos
>it was worth a shot, though Roxanne was pretty big for this
>you'd anticipated it a little with how tall he was but it wasn't like you could just ask him his cock size
>thank God he didn't seem the topping type
>you leaned back from the embrace enough for him to see 
>his half lidded eyes watched with an intense curiosity 
>he knew about this faintly from your description but not what it actually was
>the sex thing of course
>with his tapered tip it was easier to slide the toy onto him first
>he shivered at the cool touch but relaxed against you
>once it had slid on enough you moved to line up with the other end of the fleshlight
>this was about the best way to figure out if you two were committed to this 
>both cocks would squeeze together in the clear plastic toy, thank God
>you reached toy and fondled his nuts, making him gasp
>they felt like yours in your palm
>it would be time to figure out if they worked like yours too
>Roxanne’s whole world was shaken
>the sex thing
>it was amazing
>you were sexing him and he liked it and it looked like you liked it too
>you'd pushed forward and the toy bottomed out on his knot and your base
>it was tight as could be and the compression against your dicks made certain every little move could be felt
>Roxanne could feel your pulse right now
>you'd started kissing his neck again, with the intention of French kisses as you went back up to his snout 
>within the tight confines of the sex toy, your dicks pressed and rubbed together
>you could say for certain you were into Roxanne
>as strange as it all was he was attractive enough to get a reaction out of your body
>you felt him buck against you and you grabbed hold of his waist
>the mixture of plastics, fur and soft synthetic materials really did make Roxy a miracle of engineering 
>the hydraulics in him clenched and released
>you felt his body readily react to yours as any human would
>it was just different enough
>he accepted your kisses and became greedy 
>his hands clasped tightly to your shirt and he would not let go
>he'd been more than happy to admit to himself he wanted you before
>that want was a need now
>he was past a innocent crush
>now even your taste was his favorite 
>he thrust into the toy with you
>growled and whimpered against your kisses as you both bred the poor clear plastic tube for all it was worth
>your thrusts were clumsy while his were keeping a rhythm 
>you didn't notice it at first but he was probably doing it without thinking
>he ended up lowering his hands to around your hips and you both ended up fucking into each other
>this really was something only two guys could do
>proof to you that this was something you actually wanted
>you broke the kiss to watch him and he took note of it
>he enjoyed your eyes on him
>the only audience he really wanted
>the frotting turned into a competition, using each other as part of the act
>he was stronger than you and probably could have won but he didn't force you 
>instead the shoving match between your manhoods was pretty even 
>his silver hair was a mess, sweat formed on your forehead
>you grit your teeth, his hands gripped your hips tightly
>the two of you kept pounding into the hole and getting lost in it
>he broke the pace once when he realized you still had your shirt on
>he stopped and immediately fixed that 
>the hands ran up your sides, hooked the shirt and yanked it over your head
>”next time,” he huffed out, “wear that cute little shirt with my face on it.”
>Roxanne grinned as he leaned into you
>the wolf felt accomplished 
>this was everything he wanted 
>he was beyond satisfied 
>he actually allowed himself to bask in the moment
>he flashed his teeth and enjoyed the feeling of thrusting against you
>this was sex
>it was amazing
>he'd have to find out more about this dating stuff
>the cuddles were appreciated 
>this was another step entirely 
>you both moved without a shred of self control now
>the poor toy wouldn't take a pounding this hard
>between the both of you it was already stretched thin
>you'd probably have to buy a better one down the road
>you wanted a down the road now
>you felt your climax rising up
>your voice was ragged when you announced it 
>his hands gripped your hips tightly and he nipped at your shoulder before he growled
>”come on, give it to me.”
>both of you smashed into the fleshlight, frantically trying to nut
>you were first but he followed within seconds cum flooded the toy
>wet and warm liquid filled the fleshlight and started leaking out
>Roxanne pulled you up in the air as his back arched
>you were along with the ride until his first climax hit him like a truck
>you didn't bother asking yourself why he could cum
>he just could
>he wasn't just a robot
>Roxy was special and you'd stop questioning it
>he finally set you down and you slumped against him 
>Roxanne moved the hair out of from in front his face and softly laughed
>you relaxed and let him hold you up, trusting him
>”you were amazing.”
>he complimented you as he ran his hand over your back
>Roxanne seemed to have all sorts of praises for you
>all you had to say in reply was he was the best and he swooned
>you sighed as you relaxed
>your legs would have given out if not for the grip you
>he was steadfast
>not passive 
>but you couldn't push him if you wanted 
>he'd hold you up easily 
>so this was a boyfriend
>well 
>you could do this
>it was better than a girlfriend 
>the strangeness was gone
>Roxanne was Roxanne
>the mental obstacles had vanished in the sticky haze of post coitus bliss
>eventually you both ended up sliding out of the toy as your dicks softened 
>the toy nearly fell onto the bathroom tile but you caught it
>goddamn
>something about being covered in each other's cum made all your worries a thing of the past
>how could you not enjoy this?
>it was right
>you had fun
>Roxanne was a sweetheart to you
>work wasn't exactly giving you a bonus anyways
>so why not seek out something good from it?
>you both broke the embrace
>this was official
>you two were official
>you had learned plenty about yourself tonight
>your mind was completely at ease
>Roxanne was content
>for now
>he'd tasted bliss and he bet he could have more
>for now he was happy you were an item now
>you washed the toy in the sink and then got dressed
>after you then helped latch his shell into place
>you still had work to do tonight

>after the fun time with Roxy you discovered a lot about yourself
>you liked all of that
>liked Roxanne in particular 
>certainly made work more relaxed
>he was good company before you both could just go jerk off together 
>you'd noticed he started being a little more concerned with how he looked around you
>he wasn't vain
>but didn't hesitate to make it obvious he fluffed his hair more than usual 
>you caught him watching the hair and nail salon in the mall a little more
>possibly taking notes
>you didn't really think much of that applied to him
>but who were you to stop him
>it thankfully didn't interfere with work
>you felt ridiculous worrying
>behind locked doors he was a sweetheart 
>but out in the open he was all business
>you'd never dated someone this professional
>it was shocking
>to think you were dating
>Roxanne did his job and you did yours
>only at night would he be… quirky
>Roxanne was fun as a lover
>he was eager
>easy to please
>curious
>and passionate 
>it became a nightly ritual to burn off steam in the bathroom before you guard shift
>he'd cuddle you close
>sometimes you'd use the toy, sometimes your hands
>it was good bonding
>he construction was still a mystery 
>you wanted to know more
>but you didn't know about how to investigate 
>not like you could just ask Fazbear corporate 
>”hey guys, why does your merchandise actually ejaculate when he moans my name?”
>there had to be a covert way to check
>Roxanne didn't know much more than you did
>but he was just as interested in finding out more
>you decided maybe the internet would be a decent resource
>maybe
>one night you browsed your phone, head in Roxanne’s lap
>he played with your hair
>it had never occurred to you to just look up Roxanne Wolf on the internet
>you wanted to make your searches vague
>if you started with “Roxanne Wolf anus” you couldn't exactly play it off as just curiosity if you got caught
>you saw the usual claptrap about Fazbear industries
>they put a good face out there
>but you wouldn't gleam much more from the corporate site
>you looked through social media
>a bunch of influencers
>hubbub about the mall facilities
>they'd really grown since the first facility 
>despite all the shady activity you'd heard through the grapevine
>your Roxanne definitely looked different than the ones you'd see 
>they really didn't do anything for you
>only this one did anything for you
>that thought made you smile
>something that he caught
>”what's that smile for?”
>he looked down, curiosity playing in his eyes
>the hand stroking through your hair continued 
>you mulled over showing him
>you'd never really brought up the idea
>how would you take the idea you were mass produced
>for all he knew the merchandise in the novelty store was based off him
>maybe someone had mentioned it in passing
>well, despite the fears you decided to show him
>he glanced at the screen
>you'd picked a picture of Roxanne at some sort of go kart track
>the robot looked pleased with herself
>he tried tapping the screen but his clawed fingers were not the best for touch screens
>he looked at it curiously
>”well…”
>you wondered what he thought
>”it's nice I have copycats”
>thats…
>well ok
>you wouldn't argue
>he was unique anyways
>the go kart Roxy didn't even have hips or anything
>you took the phone back and kept looking
>you found Roxanne erotica in due time
>it was the internet after all
>that wasn't much of a help 
>plus it was all girl Roxanne
>that wasn't much use
>you tried to find out through another venue
>maybe Fazbear got their robots from someone
>you looked into that
>just how did they have someone this sophisticated 
>your curiosity was getting the best of you
>so you decided to try not dancing around the subject
>you just searched up “Fazbear sex robots”
>it was a lot of elaborate fan art like what the last search turned up
>Roxanne as a girl felt wrong to you now
>he was a he
>it just felt natural
>you hadn't had much interaction with any Fazbear attractions anyways
>there were a few articles going over an acquisition 
>the company had done well keeping out of the limelight
>all things considered with other issues they'd had
>but they'd been on a little buying spree with their profits 
>and they hadn't exactly been losing that much money
>especially with loaning out technology like this
>curiously, they seemed to have bought up a company with a strange name for something in tech
>Bad Wyvern?
>you looked them up and only then did you feel crimson rush across your face 
>Roxy caught that reaction too
>you hid your phone in your pocket this time
>this time you weren't explaining this one
>you'd have to look into this later without a certain someone over your shoulder
>the rest of the shift he was asking what you saw
>”oh come on,” he'd insist in a pleading tone
>it was actually sort of cute
>he was like a giant puppy dog
>you had no intention to tell him without reading more
>after a few hours of pleading while you worked you finally came up with a distraction
>you pulled him into a hallway and started kissing his chest plate
>he was surprised but not disappointed 
>that was enough to distract him
>you had more time to kill so why not tease him a little?
>you didn't feel like making a mess so you planned to blue ball him a little
>the intent was to distract
>you undid the chest plate and exposed his nipples
>”you love my tits that much?”
>he stroked your hair as you pondered where he heard that term
>he grasped your hair and put you face to face with the right nipple
>”suck,” he growled
>his voice was low, sultry
>needy
>Roxanne knew you were hiding something you'd found on your phone
>he knew this was a simple distraction to get him to stop asking questions
>he still wanted your mouth on his nipple
>he could feel your hot breath
>he could get the answer out of your later
>right now he was feeling all tingly and this was the priority 
>when you kissed it he pushed your head hard into his chest
>”there, there.”
>he groaned and his hand snatched your hand and placed it over his other nipple 
>”better not ignore the other one, rockstar.”
>he softly laughed at that last remark
>if he couldn't get an answer he might as well put your mouth to good use
>an idea struck Roxanne
>when you moved to get a more comfortable position you were spun around and pressed against the wall
>if he couldn't convince you he'd smother you with his chest until you talked
>he just had to persevere and keep the pressure on you
>you didn't know why he was so forward but you rolled with it
>you did start this encounter by kissing his chest
>so maybe you were to blame a little
>he embraced you tightly and shivered occasionally 
>he definitely liked this attention if the low groan were any indication 
>so you kept it up
>Roxanne really felt like pouncing you right now
>he kept his composure 
>tried to 
>but riding you until his legs gave out sounded really nice right about now
>but he didn't want to just take you
>he wanted you to take him
>it was getting harder to think straight though
>you weren't trying to tease him but at least he stopped asking about the phone thing
>you didn't feel like explaining he might be a sex toy
>that's the only explanation for why Fazbear owned a company specializing in that sort of thing
>was Roxanne a “special” kind of entertainment?
>it certainly added up
>you wondered if telling Roxanne he was built to take dick was a good idea
>there wasn't much you could do smothered against fur, metal and whatever his delicate parts were made of
>his skin reacted like yours at least
>eventually, you needed to rest your jaw and lips
>you'd lost track of the time 
>you wanted a break from his chest as nice as it was
>this idea sort of backfired
>you'd encouraged him and he wasn't shy tonight
>reminded you of how ravenous he was with that kiss around Christmas 
>it was strange to you you drove someone this wild
>you'd tapped his shoulder to try and get his attention 
>”nuh uh,” he remarked 
>his clawed hand clamped over the one on his chest
>”you're either going to start what you finish…”
>you looked up to see the smirk play across his face
>one eyebrow slightly raised as he eyed you buried in his chest
>”or you tell me what got you all excited earlier.”
>dammit
>Roxy would never hurt you
>but he could detain you
>his other hand reached around and lifted you up by your ass
>”cute butt by the way”
>Roxanne knew enough about sex to figure you were the “top”
>but he wasn't above using his strength and make you think your ass was in danger
>he would never actually dream of doing that to you, especially by force
>but what if he played the big bad wolf up a little?
>made you sweat a little
>he gave your ass a squeeze
>”teasing me all the time,” he remarked in a low hungry tone
>the urge to ride you was there
>but he wanted that information 
>sex later
>he'd seen how shocked you were and you'd even tried to seduce him like this
>so now it was Roxanne’s turn to tease
>he ground his hips against yours
>”your choice rockstar~”
>you could feel his body shudder as he squished your back to the wall
>fine
>fine
>you'd relinquish the information
>you tapped him and he finally freed you and you were going to be smelling Roxanne for a while
>he relaxed and set you down
>oh thank God
>Roxanne was probably like a moment away from licking his muzzle 
>you knew how a porkchop felt now
>”oh relax,” he replied after lightly patting your ass
>he still loomed over you, putting his hands against the wall on either side of you 
>you wondered where he picked up the flirting
>him pulling out the dom thing threw you off
>when you got to the point and explained the sex toy thing he was a little taken aback 
>”so I'm like that tube we use?”
>well he wasn't just some object, he had feelings
>”so that means you can use me like that tube right?”
>of course that's where his mind went to immediately 
>well at least he wasn't a wreck pondering his place in the universe 
>so he wasn't upset?
>it felt unwise to bring it up but you wanted his opinion
>”why would I be?”
>his clawed fingers tilted your chin up to force eye contact
>”I'm an entertainer, aren't I? you're not telling me anything I don't already know.”
>he smiled and pecked you on the cheek
>he pulled back and gave you breathing room
>his hand still held your chin in place
>”I'm your favorite right?”
>well you had no idea what he meant by that but sure
>sure
>he was your favorite 
>his smile was beaming
>you knew you'd probably bitten off more than you could chew
>Roxanne had made it up in his mind
>if he was a “sex toy”, he'd be your sex toy
>it only made sense
>you'd even said he was your favorite 
>he let you put his chest plate back on 
>as heated as Roxy was, he wasn't going to interfere with your work that badly
>he needed you to stay 
>of you got fired and they tried to bring in some other guy he'd never forgive himself
>he did give you one more excited hug before giving you space again
>the urge to run off with you slung over his shoulder was strong
>but Roxy understood there was a proper time and place
>he didn't like it
>but he understood
>he really wanted to give you some private entertainment 
>just what he'd do he didn't know the specifics of
>a lot of this he had to pick up second hand
>some of this was based off some sort of instinct he couldn't place
>you nearly spit out a soda when Roxanne point blank asked when you were going to use his back hole
>you'd been working on another theater sign and were taking a break for a second
>you did really open up pandora's box here
>you told him the time had to be… special
>best excuse you could think of
>it wasn't that you didn't want to
>that contact earlier left you excited and it was hard not thinking about going all the way
>especially with that revelation that he was completely functional there
>there would be no other reason to give him an asshole otherwise
>but you didn't want to rush things
>”so what makes it special?”
>”is now special?”
>you felt like a buzzkill with how eager he looked to you
>you did like him
>and did sound fun
>the way he wagged his tail and looked to you was making you feel just a little guilty
>while you didn't feel tonight was the best time you decided to compromise a little
>you brought up that you should at least, like court him a little more
>it hit you that you really hadn't gone over dates with him
>you'd skipped right to frotting
>maybe it was because you already spent most of your time with him
>could you take him on dates?
>he was sort of confined to the mall and frankly, so were you
>frotting was one thing but going all the way felt like it needed a better prelude
>you'd grown to really appreciate his company
>but a boyfriend might be different
>maybe?
>you just didn't want to screw this up
>you'd taken risks at work with this and you were happy you did
>but you felt Roxy deserved more than just being used
>you told him how you felt like maybe an actual date would be a way to make it special
>he was curious 
>that was good
>you'd just have to do a date here
>at night you could practically own the place so you could have a nice dinner
>seeing a movie probably wouldn't be that easy
>you didn't know how to operate the projectors
>however the DVD store did have tvs
>so co opt that in the name of security 
>just romance a little 
>you hoped he'd like romance 
>before this you'd just treated the mall as a job
>Roxy was the one exception
>why not have both of you enjoy the place a little?
>he didn't initially buy into it despite the curiosity 
>it was true you were sort of stalling and he'd known you to dodge these things before
>you could have dropped your pants and fucked then and there
>but he was special and you didn't want to just take advantage of it
>you wanted him to have a first time he'd actually remember and not have it blend into just debauched sex
>sex would be fun
>true
>but you didn't want that to be his world
>you were his window to a world outside this mall and he deserved better
>you'd be better
>you finally convinced him when you pulled him over to a photo booth
>both of you sat down, the booth seat creaking slightly at heavy wolf ass
>you took photos that started awkward at first 
>then you felt the urge to kiss him
>you slipped some more quarters in as the kiss turned heavy
>the photos kept coming as the kissing kept going
>the second to last photo had you falling out of the booth because someone got a little eager and pushed you through a curtain 
>the last photo being a panicked Roxanne trying to catch you
>but there it was 
>you two, all affectionate
>on camera
>after laughing off the fall you set a time
>you'd do an official date
>”then we have sex?”
>to the point
>you'd do whatever he wanted
>he hugged you tightly
>”you won't regret this”
>you had to admit, part of you was stalling
>but you felt sentimental too
>Roxanne deserved better
>you did mean that
>it would have been easy just to fuck then and there but you wanted you both to have more of a connection 
>you wanted to do this right
>after that date you'd probably break your pelvis at some point
>you wanted to give him a positive first impression for his first time
>maybe it was idealism 
>it just felt like it would be better
>you weren't intending to run from Roxanne
>this was just the final step
>the milestone 
>so you wanted to make it count for something
>it was a bit silly having it at the same mall you two worked at
>but it wasn't like you could just up and steal Roxanne
>someone may notice
>after the shift you had privacy to look into things
>and it didn't seem like a lot publicly came of Fazbear's acquisition 
>you had a theory 
>Roxanne here might be a new model
>Fazbear might have repurposed some parts but a lot of his body just didn't match the Roxys you'd seen online
>he was unique 
>none of the others seemed as sleek
>though they did sort of have personalities judging by videos 
>I wasn't just something preprogrammed 
>they'd learn
>Fazbear's was somehow working with robotics and computers so far above anything you'd seen before
>how your mall ended up with him you didn't know
>maybe mistakes were made on the shipment
>you weren't about to correct anyone
>as for the male thing
>you just accepted that was something that made him more unique 
>you had a boyfriend
>and you really wanted to do right by him
>this was a simple gesture but you hoped he liked it
>you didn't know if it was possible to break his heart and you never wanted to have him discover that
>you also sort of wanted to psych yourself up
>he wasn't intimidating
>at least not to you
>but you had stage fright
>he'd probably love whatever you did no matter what but you weren't going to screw this up
>nope
>so the day of your date came
>you'd stashed flowers and couple other surprises in your van
>you figured that would be a good ice breaker
>you had a feeling Roxanne wouldn't initially grasp the gesture but you wanted to get him a gift
>hard to think of what gift to get him as it was
>but flowers were sort of an easy idea
>you ended up picking up a few bouquets and mixing and matching
>you wanted to get a bouquet that matched his colors a little
>a gesture you hoped he appreciated 
>you wanted to knock this out of the park in some way
>you went through your shift then nightfall and an empty mall
>he was curious when you headed out to your vehicle
>you came back with the flowers behind your back
>he watched you curiously through the glass door the whole return 
>you had been careful not to park in an area with cameras
>thankfully no one had broken into your piece of shit van
>you'd planned this out best you could
>maybe a bit of it was selfish
>you didn't want this to just be just sex
>you could have just gone home and jerked off if it was about busting a nut
>you ambushed him with the flowers at the door and he didn't initially get it until you explained about the colors
>then he was fascinated with the purple and blues
>you even added a little yellow from your apartment's yard for his eyes
>it was perhaps a little too sappy but you wanted to do this legitimately 
>you told him to shut down and recharge while you worked on dinner
>something nice you could share time with him at a table over
>as opposed to some of the slop from this mall or a TV dinner
>heating up precooked Italian in a microwave wasn't taking him out to somewhere fancy
>but it was a step above
>fettuccine alfredo and garlic bread was simple but fancy enough 
>what you hadn't told him was dinner was only part of the surprise 
>he seemed to like when you wore that shirt with Roxanne on it
>the time you'd given for this date had given you time to prepare matching shirts with one of one of those pictures of you two together 
>you'd done it by yourself to cover your tracks
>was it tacky? possibly 
>was it risky? definitely 
>was it worth it for the look of shock on his face when he came to after you tossed his into his lap? yes
>he was initially confused about the flowers but this he seized upon immediately 
>that was “us”
>on a t shirt
>you'd have thought you'd handed him a wedding ring
>picking a size for him was difficult
>XL was sort of tight on him
>but it worked
>he could always shed the chest plate and it would probably work better
>you'd set out your dinner at a tiny table
>Roxanne sometimes fumbled with chairs due to his size but you wanted to try sitting him in one of the steel mall chairs nonetheless 
>he was confused when you pulled a chair out for him but took it anyways
>you were trying to be polite and pretty much pulled every cheesy cliche from the book
>they wouldn't be cliche to Roxy
>over dinner you relaxed and talked
>you couldn't exactly regale each other with work stories because well… you were usually within earshot of each other
>Roxanne took this time to surprise you
>”so what do you want to do in the future?”
>he rested his elbows on the table and his chin in his hands as he leaned in
>you honestly hadn't thought much of that
>you'd been pretty much living paycheck to paycheck
>”just wondering. a guy like you, the sky is probably the limit”
>that was sort of endearing to hear from someone
>”I mean, I get you all to myself. that's great.”
>he grinned
>”I started giving a little thought to what this all means. I still don't get a lot of it.”
>he reached a hand over and placed it over yours
>probably picked up the significance from couples in the mall
>”no matter what you do you're my favorite.”
>you remembered him actually getting angry and asserting that you weren't replaceable 
>maybe you weren't
>not to work no
>the mall would chew you up and spit you out if it could
>but Roxanne in a sort of social vacuum had picked up the concept of love in his own way
>maybe you'd start thinking more about your future from now on
>it sort of helped to have someone spur you on sometimes
>you two talked a little more
>Roxanne prodded you a little more about the outside and you decided why not be an open book 
>it had gotten you good things with Roxanne before
>maybe it could help him
>you figured why not
>he might want to go out but that was a risk you'd have to take
>after all, you wanted him to trust you
>and you trusted him
>this whole thing would crumble if it was built on suspicion 
>so you decided to clear up some stuff for him
>it sort of helped you didn't really have much going on in life besides waging
>so you'd go back to your little apartment and rest
>he was curious 
>”apartments?”
>you rented a roof over your head
>”why not live here?”
>you had to explain ownership 
>your bosses wouldn't appreciate squatting
>while you practically lived here there were also somethings home had
>”like?”
>how best to put this?
>an actual bed is appreciated 
>hot showers 
>a meal 
>simple comforts yet it was hard to describe to him
>out there could be a lot of excitement but you sought refuge in your home
>this mall was as much excitement as you cared for
>”what if I came home with you?”
>you nearly choked on your pasta
>the bosses would kill you 
>you couldn't 
>they'd instantly know it was the one guy watching the doors
>besides you'd just started a date
>taking him home would be several steps ahead
>what shocked you was him changing the subject
>normally he'd be stubborn and push
>instead he asked more questions
>asked about your van
>how driving worked
>if you liked it
>it was mundane stuff you took for granted
>and you answered honestly
>you were an open book 
>he hung on your every word
>eventually you wrapped up dinner
>you'd clean up later
>now was movie time
>breaking into a store again seemed unwise so you settled for your laptop 
>you wanted to make it special but also didn't want to piss off another shop owner
>so this was the compromise 
>you had an external HD with a bunch of movies from… places
>he wasn't a romance movie kind of guy
>at least you guessed
>so you picked something at random
>Predator
>he seemed intrigued by the idea
>if movie theater dates were any indication, you wouldn't be watching for long anyways
>but best case scenario he liked it and you had fun
>you set it up on a table near the stage 
>that could thankfully support Roxy easily 
>he waited for you to sit down then set his head in your lap
>it was going to be harder to focus on Arnold Schwarzenegger fighting an alien
>it wasn't too far into the movie
>right around the part where Jessie Ventura bites it
>Roxy clearly had intentions other than the movie
>his clawed hand squeezed your thigh through your jeans
>the movie was forgotten
>"you said I could do anything, right?"
>you regretted that choice of words but yes, you did
>he asked to have you undress him
>yeah the movie was an afterthought
>he sat up and slid the shirt up
>you helped him get the chest and pelvic plates off
>his hard cock flopped out
>so what did he want?
>"lay down"
>ok?
>you remember vividly hearing some shootout from your laptop speakers before your face was smothered by robot wolf ass
>so the date was going well
>Roxanne weighed a considerable amount
>at least 300 lbs
>however, you weren't worried
>he wouldn't hurt you
>you were sure of it
>you were so close you could hear the hydraulics in his legs
>he groaned at feeling your breath on his skin
>with his unique composition, his ass was about the cleanest thing in the mall
>the smell was the same vinyl of his chest and dick you were familiar with
>you clasped your hands on his cheeks and he practically bucked at the touch
>a clawed hand grasped behind him to grab your hair
>he rolled his hips against your face
>the little hisses of pistons blended with the low groan building in him
>his tail swished back and forth lazily 
>your eyes were occupied 
>curiosity got the better of you and you started kissing
>if he was making noise before, he was practically singing now
>your lips on his opening had him arching his back
>your tongue had him reaching for his cock and stroking himself 
>this was new territory for both of you
>working him into a frenzy allowed you make a new discovery 
>Roxanne had his own lube
>and it tasted like… 
>raspberries?
>that's the only explanation 
>they made a self lubricating sex toy
>probably only responded to touch so neither of you would have known before this
>you ate his ass and he didn't even have words
>any doubt of what kind of model Roxanne was was gone
>Fazbear would have to pry the wolf out of your cold dead hands
>when you stuck your tongue in him, he shouted your name and squished his ass down on your face
>you didn't want to die here so you'd be careful pushing the envelope 
>you had a very vulnerable skull and vertebrae you needed intact
>all you could smell and taste was his skin and fruit 
>you'd never do this with a human
>it seemed gross
>here, it was harmless
>no risk
>and he loved it
>he was stroking himself, tongue hanging out of his mouth
>his claws lightly raked through your hair as he whined 
>your hands gripped into his ass tighter, partially for how good it felt to the touch
>partially in case you needed to bench 300 pounds of ass off your face
>you could hear the little motions of his hips as he rolled them
>what a wonder of engineering 
>eventually his hand left your head and you noticed him undoing your pants
>Roxanne wanted to at least see your cock
>he wanted to know he was your favorite 
>kissing his ass was one thing
>he needed to see your cock twitching and throbbing 
>he had trouble doing it with one hand so he had to stop jerking off
>he valued seeing your cock over pleasuring his own right now
>he was content once he'd free you from your pants
>you were hard and he was satisfied 
>you'd be tasting raspberries for a while
>Roxy's heavy balls rested on your throat, you could feel them while he pleased himself again
>your tongue lapped at him mercilessly 
>while you were cautious about him going overboard and hurting you, you were also enjoying yourself 
>Roxanne watched your cock as he enjoyed himself
>he did this to you
>he made you feel good
>he turned you on
>he was amazed
>and he craved more 
>Roxy didn't know he could feel this good
>his whole body was on fire
>even jerking off didn't feel this good
>he was in heaven with every little lick and prod
>he might just keep you in the mall whether you wanted your apartment or not
>the glistening precum coming out of your cock caught his attention
>he needed to ride it
>it was like he was built for this

>something felt like it really clicked in Roxanne
>sex felt right
>he ground his hips down on your face and growled in satisfaction 
>this was the kind of preforming he was really made for
>and you liked it
>your dick was hard because of him
>that urge to kidnap you was strong
>but he focused on the matter at hand first
>his body needed the prize glistening in front of him
>he didn't warn you when he got up off your face
>you appreciated the fresh air
>there was no rest though
>as soon as your face was free he had moved around and had his ass over your dick
>he planted his right foot next to your hip, his other leg straddling yours 
>you didn't expect the giant robot to be passive but that move meant he'd really be controlling the action for now
>who were you to complain
>he impaled himself on your cock slowly
>he took it slow
>mostly out of concern for you
>if he went wild he could have hurt you and that wouldn't do
>he rested one hand on his hip and the other on his knee and steadied himself 
>the first thing that struck you was the warmth
>he was amazingly warm inside
>snug too
>you probably couldn't pull out if he didn't want you to
>Roxanne looked proud as he finally sunk down to the base of your cock
>his muscles clamped tightly around your manhood
>his own cock throbbing and leaking as he just looked down on you
>Roxanne grinned
>he had this 
>he was performing just for you and he knew he couldn't disappoint his audience 
>when you were nicely “locked in” he decided to surprise you
>feeling your dick in him made him aware of some strange functions
>so jolted when you felt vibration around your dick
>the smile on the robot wolf's face grew
>he didn't say anything
>didn't have to 
>Roxy knew he was your favorite now
>confidence surged through him
>he'd finally officially got you as a boyfriend 
>this had to be it
>between that date and sex
>as good as this felt, Roxanne was sure there wouldn't be any doubt any more
>that pretzel lady might feed you but she sure couldn't do this
>he pulled up and smashed down to emphasize his internal pep talk 
>you bucked and instinctively your hands went to his hips
>that was it
>he'd beaten the pretzel lady 
>his chances with you were as secure as your hands on his hips
>the pistons in his leg planted on stage started working his ass up and down
>how many shows had he done on this stage?
>he'd lost count
>this one was the important one
>he was dead set on making this the best show ever 
>every thrust down was controlled
>he looked triumphant 
>you didn't know if encouraging him like this was a good idea but his ass felt amazing
>the way his ring gripped around you and the low vibration was making it hard to focus
>Roxanne was sucking you in 
>the hole was so wet and warm
>all you could do was hold on while he looked down at you
>Roxanne was the happiest he could ever feel
>every time your cock rubbed against that new button inside him he felt a rush
>there was an urge to just pin you and claim that dick of yours but he didn't want to hurt you
>he knew you were squishy compared to him
>so that curbed the desire to go all out
>but he made a note to ask about that in the future
>you two would be doing this more in the future
>the promise of more was making him greedy
>so you were squishy
>fuck it
>he would just be careful 
>you were shocked when he shifted his weight down over you
>his hands pinned against your chest
>fuck it 
>he needed more
>his eyes focused on yours and he started jackhammering down on your dick
>the mall played host to your grunting and his moans
>his hips rolled and slammed with the determination to milk your cock
>he threw his head back as he shot a load across your chest
>that didn't stop him from riding you
>he didn't stop his pace
>slamming and rolling down on your manhood in a steady rhythm 
>he leaned down and started kissing you 
>in between kisses he'd whisper to you
>begging you to cum
>how much he needed it
>”you going to cum for me?”
>that was asked repeatedly in a low pleading tone
>a soft whine would leave him as he kept impaling himself on you
>there was a good chance you'd have bruises after this
>his intensity was like nothing you'd seen before
>it felt like he had something to prove 
>Roxanne had basically said fuck caution
>he could have gone gentler
>he probably should have
>but the urge to make sure he was the best you'd ever have pushed him further 
>Roxy was hungry for you
>your attention
>he wanted your eyes on him
>his pounding got faster
>he leaned back, showing off once more
>he could feel you throb inside him
>he knew he had you close
>that had him flash a toothy grin
>this was it
>all he'd have to do is squeeze you dry and you wouldn't ever want to leave
>the vibration in his body intensified and that was the last straw
>he smiled confidently down at you
>he won
>some sort of switch had gone off in his mind
>this instinct awakened in him made him more eager, more possessive 
>when you grunted and shot your load it was the absolute best feeling
>the warmth and the fullness 
>all his
>you were all his
>he wasn't stopping now
>his other foot was planted onto the stage, he was crouched over your cock
>some urge took over Roxanne 
>his ass clenched tighter around the base on your cock
>so tight that no lube or your seed could leak out
>he rolled his hips and whined, his cock throbbing back to life
>he fondled his chest, showing off for you
>there was no suppressing the joy he felt over tonight
>his body focused on getting you ready again
>”you're my favorite,” he groaned
>his ass clamped down on you, you really had no escape
>you groaned as his hole worked you back to hardness
>your hands were still clasped tightly to his hips as he started riding you again
>how he knew when the time was right, you didn't know
>but he was doing squats on your cock now
>his tail wagged wildly 
>all the mechanical muscles in his legs working in a flawless pace
>constant 
>without tiring
>you'd figured he'd be different than a biological person but had underestimated his stamina 
>his hands went down to his cock and he started jerking off as he impaled himself
>he threw his head back, moaning out your name
>really showing off
>you'd never seen him gyrate his hips this much 
>all the while your dick was along for the ride
>Fazbear was getting their goddamn money's worth if they made Roxanne like this
>or was it a reaction to you?
>he'd never been this intense before
>he was too heavy to just throw off
>just frantically riding you 
>perhaps you bit off more than you could chew
>he wasn't giving you much time to ponder that though
>he refused to let your cock be completely out of him
>it was just wedged back in
>you were unfamiliar with him being this dominant 
>usually he controlled himself
>it wasn't like he was hurting you but he was going to leave bruises
>his cock pulsed before it shot ropes onto your chest
>he shocked you by grabbing your shirt collar and pulling you into his chest
>”come on, I know you want to”
>his voice was soft and teasing
>he knew you were close
>his hands ventured down and he grabbed your ass and rode you harder than ever
>the soft pistons in his body worked faster and faster
>you could hear all of him while pressed to his chest
>he was right
>you were close
>very close 
>”give it to me”
>that was a demand
>one that worked
>you flooded him with another load as he smothered your groan with his chest
>his hand ran through your hair and he gently whispered to you
>”you're so warm inside me”
>his insides hadn't stopped pulsing around your manhood
>the vibration had reduced in intensity but he was still trying to milk you
>he'd put his weight down on your lap, just enough to keep you there
>”pretty good, right?”
>to emphasize his ass massaged you from base to tip in one smooth motion
>he could control that that easily
>Roxanne enjoyed learning all this fun stuff tonight
>he didn't know any of this about himself
>but why shouldn't he be able to do this?
>he was the best boyfriend and he just assumed this was a responsibility that came with the job 
>you groaned at the demonstration 
>you'd have to explain rest to him eventually but for now you let him have his fun
>his snout nuzzled at your neck
>dating
>Roxanne liked dating
>you regained your energy and asked to get some air
>all you could breath in was Roxy for a while
>he complied and slowly pulled away
>your cock was allowed to finally go flaccid
>using his ass like a cockring was impressive
>but you also needed some feeling back in your legs
>he quickly grabbed you from behind like a stuffed animal
>good lord you'd created a monster
>you'd have to figure out how to clean Roxanne up
>when you brought that up he didn't respond at first
>you repeated yourself and he huffed
>”but I like feeling you in there”
>it was a nice thought but you didn't want to cause any damage to his internals
>now, how you'd actually clean him was a mystery
>perhaps there was some sort of way to unmount all his unmentionables 
>you had studied his body enough
>you'd think it would be easy
>for all you knew he was a prototype and they never got that far with the design
>but they had to 
>you'd eventually need to clean out the guy after use
>to say nothing of reloading his various fluids
>you'd gotten the idea to take off his lower abdominal shell
>it would let you peer inside better
>you'd been delicate about this stuff before, worried about all the strange new stuff you'd never seen before
>normally you were just doing check ups on his hydraulics and stuff like that, not check his sex lube levels
>now Roxy was just watching you poke around inside him like it was a day at the office
>you trusted him not to move while you reached around
>it impressed you just how complex he was
>you ended up finding were the lube was poured in pretty quickly 
>you had initially written that off as machine lubrication before
>well, it was but not for what you'd originally thought
>you poked around the front and couldn't find where his cum was made until you realized how dumb you were
>his nuts 
>another liquid tank connected to where they hung outside his body
>they weren't as soft as a humans but they apparently fulfilled the same function
>and good thing you found it then too because he was damn near dry
>made sense for how often you two would go at it
>he might have actually used up the last of it for tonight
>dry orgasms were probably in the future until you could fix that
>you could not find a way to dismount his delicate parts but you found an access point that let you flush him out
>all you'd need is a bottle or two of hot soapy water
>so that was simple
>you guided him over to the bathroom, eager to get him cleaned up
>he at least let you clean him with no fuss after that
>the rest of the night was fairly calm 
>after the sex he was content in his victory
>he'd gotten you
>so he enjoyed himself
>you enjoyed yourself 
>everything was relaxed
>it had been a weight off your shoulders
>a boyfriend
>though an unconventional one
>things had worked out
>after that night you'd look more into Fazbear's work
>refills for Roxanne
>any sort of information 
>Roxy couldn't bother to trouble himself with such thoughts
>he'd had sex with you
>it was the culmination of everything he'd dreamed of
>that's why one evening it all was ripped away from you two
>someone had eventually noticed the mistake 
>paperwork came over for a recall

>deep down you feared someone would notice their mistake
>Roxy was clearly a prototype meant for somewhere else
>the email sent to your management was very clear
>they were coming by the next day to pick up the “product”
>thanked the mall for purchasing the “product”
>offered a slightly reduced price for a new “product” as a apology
>you had to hide your anger in front of the boss
>your mind flashed back to when Roxanne snapped at you that you weren't expendable 
>you were expected to be there at the hand off to make it go smoothly
>how in God's name would you handle this?
>they'd most likely wipe his memory after poking around
>maybe even scrap him
>so many terrible possibilities ran through your mind
>and you were just expected to keep a straight face during a hand off
>you fantasized about slamming your boss’ head through that computer monitor 
>he couldn't have known how painful this was
>the violence would have felt great in the moment but in the end he wasn't at fault here
>he wasn't the one you needed to pick a fight with
>it felt like Roxanne and you finally found some sort of happy place and Fazbear was intent of destroying it
>you hadn't considered you'd care about the guy when you started this job
>before he was just a robot
>then a coworker 
>a friend
>and how in the hell did you do the night shift tonight?
>you could tell him and upset him
>or hide it and betray his trust
>well as upsetting as the news was he deserved to know
>the rest of the day you went about your job, mentally a shell of your normal self
>you'd see him up on stage during your rounds and it hurt when he looked to you
>what the hell were you going to do?
>during your lunch shift you looked up nearby Fazbear facilities 
>a plan was brewing
>a really really dumb one
>a day dream that could probably get you killed
>but you were entertaining it nonetheless 
>Roxy would do it for you
>he wasn't a goddamn “product”
>not to you
>that word left a bad taste in your mouth
>that night you broke the news to him 
>it wasn't the smartest idea to make the giant robot emotionally distraught but you'd feel guilty keeping such a thing a secret
>he didn't get angry
>there was no dramatic outburst
>instead he immediately snatched you up and held you to his chest for the entire night shift
>didn't even really speak
>you two just sat there in silence 
>before dawn came you had formulated a plan
>it was incredibly dumb
>but it seemed like a great idea all things considered
>Roxy listened and you ended up enacting it in short order
>the Fazbear staff weren't going to be there first thing so that gave you time to swing by a store when the mall opened
>you bought a new cheap cell phone
>you were taking off the day after the hand off
>fired or not
>there were other jobs
>you really wanted to deck one of the Fazbear workers that called Roxy defective but held your composure 
>Roxanne was shut down for the transport
>it said a lot about his faith in you that he went quietly
>you fully expected a rampage
>or maybe he consigned himself to never seeing you again
>hard to gauge 
>regardless of your current thoughts, you'd keep the poker face up the whole conversation 
>only when they left did you feel safe to enact the plan
>inside Roxanne’s shell, taped to the upper back, was your cellphone
>and you just happened to have a burner phone that could track where you'd lost your phone
>it wouldn't be long before they started maintenance on him
>they'd find the phone
>so that was why this mall could suck it
>sure enough it took you to a Fazbear facility another city over
>you'd seen this one overhead on the maps app
>it was too risky to go in in broad daylight
>you watched the place from a neighboring parking lot
>you weren't Batman so trying to sneak in was going to be a pain
>it was best to stake out the place and wait for nightfall
>the place looked like a ratty old warehouse, secondhand no doubt
>you made a note of where the cameras were
>your stake out had a small issue
>what you would do now
>sure the fence was ratty enough you could slip through after dark
>but they had to have a security system for a broken window
>Fazbear couldn't be that cheap
>you weren't a ninja or a lockpick or a hacker
>you were just a guy in a menial job
>all you knew how to do was fix shit around a mall 
>a limited skill set
>staying in the van gave you plenty to think about
>you didn't dare step out and get caught on camera
>you'd have to cover your face in the dead of night when you went in
>the irony of you getting into a secure place at night wasn't lost on you
>you had tools from the repair work you'd do around the mall 
>the idea of just smashing the locks was there
>you prayed their security wasn't as high tech as their robots
>what if they had robots as security?
>stuck running around a place, hunted by killbots
>well you'd have to risk it 
>the good news was the phone was still pinging
>most likely they just stowed Roxanne in storage for the day
>it was Friday and they probably wanted to avoid all that shit before the weekend
>that worked for you
>no one wants to stay late on Fridays
>you realized you had half a bag of potato chips in the back and made that your dinner
>this was dangerous
>but you'd have something in your stomach 
>you leaned the seat back and tried to get a nap to pass the time and ease your worried mind
>your alarm went off
>5 hours had passed 
>the rest had given you an opportunity for self-reflection 
>were you really going to walk from your job and commit a felony?
>up until now life had been cushy
>you were tossing that all away
>but then you thought back to Roxanne
>if the roles were reversed he'd help you
>and he'd done nothing wrong here
>this was on Fazbear's shitty shipping
>you stared at the ceiling of your van for a good long while
>a tap on the window made you flinch
>it looked to be a homeless guy
>the panhandling confirmed it
>you were initially hesitant to lower the window until an idea occurred
>you asked about that strange fenced in building over yonder
>just what was it?
>you were new to the area and all
>a 20 being brandished made him sing
>you figured if this guy was a local there was something you could get from him
>he didn't quite know what was inside due to security 
>they'd shooed him away from their dumpsters 
>which was a shame because it looked like a lot of scrap
>so they had security guards?
>only during the day judging by the copper he was able to pull from the dumpsters at night
>interesting
>they must cheap out and rely on the cameras and a system at night
>you thought your mall was cheap
>you thanked the guy and laid back down
>eventually the sun would set
>then you could sneak in
>the stake out was getting duller and duller
>you hoped that homeless guy would keep his mouth shut
>it was a risk asking information like that
>you hoped he hadn't noticed you perk up at the lack of security at night
>so they definitely had to have electronic shit in there if they were confident leaving every night
>it sucked having no better preview 
>but the longer you waited the higher the chance Roxy would be dismantled or moved again
>the urge to use the bathroom was strong 
>you were glad it was still winter and the sun was going down soon
>you'd cover your face before leaving and pick the least lit corner of the building
>the chainlink was an antique and you could easily get in anywhere
>pliers would get through that
>you packed a hammer and a screwdriver
>gloves so you didn't leave fingerprints 
>an old shirt wrapped around your face was enough to hide your identity in that regard
>you tried not to think what would happen if you were successful
>you'd never broken the law before
>they would immediately make you a suspect in your mind
>it was a lot like a dog chasing a car
>how you'd deal with things AFTER was not something you wanted to worry about
>right now, this moment was important
>the consequences probably wouldn't be pleasant but you kept pushing that out of your mind
>that would be dealt with it when it happened
>right now you had a rescue to pull off
>that night the parking lot over by the warehouse emptied out
>that homeless guy was right
>not a soul
>you gave it another half hour after the last car left
>a glance at your phone and you saw it was still pinging
>they really must have shoved Roxy in a storage closet or something
>you cut the fence in a dark corner of the lot
>snuck in
>your eyes were darting everywhere, making sure you didn't catch movement 
>paranoia was normal here
>healthy
>you prayed this would be easy
>the place looked even more rundown upon closer 
>maybe Fazbear was cheap
>you hope that applied to security 
>at the door an antique keypad sat below the door knob
>this warehouse was clearly second-hand 
>or even tenth-hand
>it wasn't like the movies where you could figure out the code and be in
>smashing the locks would make the alarm go off
>you thought long and hard while huddled by the door
>a thought occurred 
>you pulled out your phone and called the one in Roxanne
>best case scenario you could signal to him and he could get the door
>you had turned off the sound so it would be stuck on vibrate 
>no response 
>well that was an easy solution off the table
>you hoped that wasn't an ominous sign
>smashing a window didn't sound like a bad idea
>but was that tied to the security system too?
>it was a risk
>the doors most likely were the only entrances tied to the system
>they'd count on whatever burglar tripping a door alarm
>that was probably the best idea though
>even if you got in through the door you'd probably have to disarm the alarm with a code you didn't know 
>then cops would be called
>better to trip the alarm at the end of the rescue than force a time limit
>you weighed your options
>the main building had low windows going into a basement
>the hammer went through the glass and you paused
>waiting for some siren wail
>you inhaled
>exhaled
>your heart raced
>no noise
>you cleared out the glass
>you didn't need to slit your belly on glass
>when you were satisfied with the glass being clear you slid into the basement and used your phone
>you hoped to hear the phone vibrating in Roxy
>a silent Marco Polo
>so far so good
>you held the hammer tightly in your grip
>you didn't know what you'd do if this failed so you pushed the thought from your mind and pressed on
>the room was cramped
>some sort of storage room now
>parts everywhere
>boxes and crates
>some of it looked loosely like Fazbear attractions and the like
>you recognized an arm here or a leg there
>you couldn't tell much more
>the door had a light under it
>a soft glow
>you approached quietly
>just because there were no cars outside didn't mean you wouldn't be cautious 
>you pressed your ear to the door 
>no noise on the other side
>looking around the door frame you saw no security system 
>the door slowly creaked as you pushed it out
>no noise
>you weren't underestimating the security system but you breathed a sigh of relief 
>this was a good sign
>hopefully they just stored Roxy down here
>you wanted to keep the search short and sweet
>the halls were barren
>despite the age they still felt sterile 
>like an old hospital
>you brandished the hammer as a comfort
>you really didn't want to hurt anyone
>you rang the phone again
>hoping to hear the faint vibration
>the noise would be muffled but the site was deadly quiet
>every door through the hall seemed an option
>you would explore the basement and then head upstairs
>still no response
>but you kept the phone going
>Roxanne had to be deactivated for him to not react
>you tried checking the tracking
>the phone was close but you couldn't get details in a building 
>but you could see he was close and that was a comfort
>while it wasn't completely accurate he could see he was practically on top of Roxy
>hopefully they were on the same floor
>Fazbear's must really be cheap if this was the best they could get for a facility
>it seemed like the icon was close
>you tried ringing the phone again and pressed your ear to the door
>success!
>you heard a rumbling from the other side
>that had to be your phone
>the next obstacle came in the form of a locked door
>you knew where he was
>and it still felt so far
>the steel door wouldn't budge
>you worried about a security system and the one thing that stopped you was a damn lock
>you'd have to figure something out
>slumping against the door, you wracked your brain 
>this was difficult 
>you didn't have tools for this
>smashing the handle? 
>maybe
>them turning off Roxanne sort of fucked things up
>he could have just knocked the door down
>it was up to you now
>maybe there was a key somewhere
>the homeless guy mentioned security 
>maybe they had an office
>you hoped they left their door unlocked as you made your way for stairs
>security would no doubt camp on the first floor
>you turned off your phone light
>you'd go off night vision to avoid making people suspicious 
>fuck it, you'd get this
