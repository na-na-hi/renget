>the mall hired you on as a technician
>you knew how to hold a wrench and that pretty much qualified you
>the place was dying and desperate for new hands
>especially ones that would work for minimum wage
>so you were a wagie
>needed to pay the bills somehow
>as it turned out Fazbears whatever was still clinging to life
>how many lawsuits and shady shit they got into
>this time they'd branched out into leasing out the face of their properties 
>merchandise and shit
>cheaper than having a physical attraction
>just slap t shirts or shitty vinyl figures out there
>or just mass produce the robots
>that's where you came in
>see Roxanne the character had a following
>just enough to create demand
>sure she wasn't out Freddie's level of popularity 
>but she was more popular than the rabbit currently
>so your mall had purchased a robot
>plastered in a mass produced shell
>top of the line
>one small issue about your mall's Roxanne...

>with a mass production, faults sometimes pop up
>really it was impressive that the robots were as capable as they were
>and the technology was used for an entertainment industry
>a pizza chain, a fucking pizza chain, turned science fiction into reality
>wasn't too long ago you'd seen footage of robots that could barely count as bipedal
>to say nothing of what advances in AI you saw
>you weren't exactly some engineer or computer whiz
>you could maybe put together a PC if pressed to do it
>all your mechanical knowledge came from cars and what experience you could scrape together to bluff through here
>the AI was the really impressive thing
>no idea why a pizza mascot needed it but Roxanne was impressive 
>sometimes you almost felt like the robot was just a coworker
>one you had to diagnose like the kiddy rides and the occasional soda machine
>Fazbear industries was at least not too worried after they sold off merchandise 
>for better or worse
>made repairs comparable to fixing a tank out in the field
>a lot of improvising 
>there was a sort of quirk with this particular model
>this AI really did function like people and over time people also develop personalities and the like
>while it was impressive, it also meant you had a wolf robot done up like a female glam rock star who insisted he was a guy
>no idea how to handle that, you didn't like the idea of "correcting" the AI
>not that you knew how
>so your mall's Roxanne was a guy
>just a quirk
>you'd heard of other robots getting weird
>granted, the robot's chassis wasn't like what you'd seen elsewhere
>didn't have the stock female body the other's seemed to have
>his body wasn't built like a fridge like some of the older models, even had a sleeker edge about him
>while he still towered over some, there was a leaner shape to him that took away a little of the intimidation factor 
>also had a few other things you quite hadn't seen before with a robot
>maybe Fazbear had more intimate entertainment in mind for some models
>his body had male genitalia and a backdoor hidden under a metal pelvic plate
>you felt like it was above your pay grade and never had an inclination to ask
>you didn't dare ask Roxanne either
>sometimes it felt like a patient/doctor relationship and it felt easier with time to start thinking of Roxy as less an it and more a he

>Roxy over time had become less unsettling to be around
>your initial shock at his size and weight had faded fairly quickly
>then you'd started thinking of him as just a machine
>but that was undone when you saw how like he could be
>maybe you watched too much Robocop 
>you could swear there was a spark there
>he still freaked out a few of your coworkers
>security guards wouldn't last night shifts because the robot gave them the creeps 
>your indifference around Roxy was noticed and more than once they asked you to cover a shift
>money was decent so why not
>boss basically gave you a flashlight and you'd pull double duty
>the mall wasn't particularly impressive or vast but it was in a shittier neighborhood that had seen better days
>never did replace the department store that shut down on one wing
>the place was decaying and Roxy and a few other purchases were meant to breath a little life into the place
>the shifts also helped because you'd be around at night more than a few times with repairs to the mall's
>you didn't know how to fix toilets before this 
>well you sure as hell knew now
>keeping the stage that Roxy used in working order was a point of pride for you though
>Roxy weighed a bit over 300 lbs and to have that robot dancing and jumping on stage like Van Halen, it needed to be tough
>this was dirty work but you'd made a difference 
>Roxy actually thanked you when he remembered to
>you saw how giddy he was with crowds 
>was it all programed or did he learn to enjoy entertaining 
>you had little idea how he worked there
>he even overcame his little insecurities out on stage
>and woo boy did the robot have baggage
>sometimes you really felt like a doctor here
>even if he only performed for like 3 kids he was content
>it was clear as daylight the place was on its last legs and all this was a gamble
>hopefully it would pay off
>at least the money was decent
>there was usually plenty to keep you occupied during the day shift as super/mechanic
>something gone wrong here and there
>you were pretty sure you shouldn't be handling the wiring but the mall didn't want to hire someone "official"
>every day felt like some new challenge thrown in your lap 
>and you managed
>for someone that essentially bluffed through your resume you did end up having a knack for it
>there was some touch and go here and there
>Roxy nearly falling over on you while in sleep mode, nearly flying yourself with the jewelry store lighting, the escalator incident in the old department store
>all isolated incidents you didn't need to report to higher ups
>you sort of got along with your coworkers 
>you eventually started to include a wolf into that circle
>it was hard to just dismiss him as a machine 
>you weren't one for philosophy 
>but you wagered Roxanne was something
>not just just some robot performing a task
>he was too complex for that
>more than once on night shifts he'd want to accompany you on the security rounds
>just to have someone to talk to
>maybe you were nuts and assigning humanity to something that imitated it
>but you weren't here for such contemplation 
>you were paid to fix shit and make sure no one broke in overnight
>why the guards were more scared of Roxy than the mall at night you didn't know
>in fact you welcomed the company
>his eyes glowing in the dark were a good sign to you
>it meant you weren't alone in here
>in a good way of course
>there were issues 
>mostly Roxy didn't understand personal space in off hours
>he was professional with an audience 
>his solo stage show usually didn't have the stage swarmed but he was good with kids after the meet and greet
>you wanted to beat the hell out of snotty teenager that thought spray painting the robot was a good idea
>you were buffing and shining Roxy's chest for hours
>but Roxanne treated the vandalism in stride
>at night he seemed to be on free roam
>like the time he thought it was appropriate to burst into the bathroom with you at the urinal 
>nothing like a goddamn jumpscare while trying to take a piss
>very convenient 
>you had to lay out that the bathroom was a no go zone
>he agreed but looked like a chastised puppy
>after washing your hands and escorting him out you explained it was just polite
>the mall might take issue
>"it's not fair though"
>you weren't prepared for that line
>what did he mean?
>"you've seen mine and I haven't seen yours."
>yours?
>the eyes glanced down to your pants
>oh no
>so you had to lay out personal space that night
>you had seen "his" because you needed to repair and maintain him
>how did he know you saw "his" anyways?
>was his sleep mode not an actual sleep mode?
>you didn't really have anyone to turn to with this
>Fazbear's just essentially dropped him off at the mall after they got their money
>you wondered just how quirky this AI could be
>another busy day had you going over Roxy's diagnostics 
>weekly maintenance 
>after that incident with the bathroom you figured what was the point with flipping him off
>you reasoned maybe it was unfair to operate on him without his consent 
>if you had to see "his" it didn't feel right shutting him down for it
>you would be uncomfortable if someone touched your body while you were unconscious 
>besides, maybe talking through the work might make it fun for him
>you had unlatched his chest to work on his internals 
>he watched you with curiosity 
>his face was narrower than the base Roxy model
>that was a thing you noticed studying him over the course of your work
>it was less like a goofy robot face
>hard to describe 
>maybe… friendlier?
>softer?
>maybe because you were working closer with him over the months
>he was already very different than the floor model
>you had realized how much more organic he looked compared to the stock models you'd seen elsewhere 
>maybe it was all tied to his special equipment 
>you didn't have a lot to go by and you didn't feel it was appropriate to ask
>he was a coworker
>you didn't ask a coworker about his dick
>his metal chest piece clamped back on easy enough
>everything under the hood seemed in working order
>you dusted off the fur on his shoulders
>despite the metal and plastic shell, he had fur where there wasn't access panels
>it was fake of course
>but meant you weren't constantly touching cool metal or plastic
>sort of like a sleeve over the chassis, or maybe part of it?
>you had little experience with it
>not like people had fuzzy cars or washing machines
>it was difficult to clean but you managed, you wanted him presentable 
>cleaning him was part of repairs after all
>even down to brushing that giant mop of hair
>whatever Fazbear made him out of was a miracle
>sometimes you remarked on that and you'd never seen someone so giddy about praise 
>any sort of praise from you seemed to make him brighten up
>after the maintenance you wanted rest
>having learned from past experience, you ended up bringing a sleeping bag 
>you could get away with a nap on your night shifts and sometimes you took it
>no cameras on the inside meant camping out wherever you liked
>usually by the fountain that only worked occasionally 
>the running water was pleasant to fall asleep to
>you had excused yourself to go rest when Roxy spoke up
>"you could sleep here," the robot gestured to the stage 
>an odd proposal 
>why? 
>he patted the spot next to him on the stage
>well it was weird but you felt it would be rude to turn down the offer
>perhaps you'd worked with Roxanne so much you'd begun to sympathize 
>anthropomorphize him
>it was hard to just write him off as a machine
>not after being around his company
>hell you'd even referred to him as him and not it for what felt like ages now
>maybe due to your close proximity to him
>your coworkers didn't seem to share your opinion on the matter
>but you didn't mind them much
>so it was difficult to ignore his request you nap on stage
>why not
>about as comfortable as the floor anyways
>you'd do rounds after an hour or so of shut eye
>Roxy sat on the stage, his legs dangling off it and gently kicking at the air as he observed you
>it was hard to get an idea of what he was thinking
>you understood he thought, felt
>but the whole machine thing was a barrier 
>while you'd warmed up to him better than your coworkers you still felt he was a mystery
>when he offered his lap as a pillow you politely declined
>the offer was appreciated but you felt it was inappropriate 
>there was the personal space thing again
>besides you had doubts his thigh would be all that comfortable for your neck
>you compromised and laid next to him
>he tried to give you a disappointed puppy look and goddamn it worked
>at least he was satisfied with your head next to his hip
>you bundled up in your sleeping bag
>at least you'd have some rest
>pressure on your chest made you crack one eye open
>a paw rested on you and Roxy made no effort to move it
>the lean arm still had enough strength to trap you in that spot if he wanted
>but he didn't want that
>”get some rest,” his normally energetic voice was lower, softer
>he was normally a firecracker when he was performing and sometimes off stage
>this was a side no one really got to see but you 
>either they didn't bother or Roxy spooked them
>he hummed some quiet tune down to you while patting you through the sleeping bag 
>was he trying to comfort you?
>lull you sleep?
>he was good with kids
>did that care extend that easily to you?
>maybe because you took care of him?
>he was just supposed to be a coworker
>personal boundaries 
>but this was actually sort of nice
>you pondered it a little but you decided to take his advice
>one little indulgence couldn't hurt
>running around for 16 hrs on no energy was a bad idea
>with Roxy plugged into the mall power for recharging he couldn't go anywhere either
>he gently rocked you to sleep 
>when you awoke you felt fucking amazing 
>”I let you sleep an extra hour. don't be mad, ok?”
>but your phone alarm?
>he put it on your chest as you wiped the crust from your eyes
>his cocky energy came back
>”what did I tell you about sleeping here? I was right, right? of course I was.”
>you scoffed a little
>so it was better than tile floor
>not much of a high bar 
>he hadn't moved from that spot
>”come on, let's go.”
>he seemed excited to tour the exact same mall you both saw the night before
>it's like being excited to see your bedroom for the thousandth time
>not that you saw your bed much nowadays 
>oh well
>”wait,” he remarked
>you had gotten up and your turned to look at him
>”how's my hair?”
>he fluffed at it with his paws, trying to get a feel for the ridiculous volume of it
>he looked fine
>at least as far as you could see
>was he trying to smile?
>he looked earnest 
>his hands moved down to his lap after he fluffed his hair up enough to satisfy himself
>if you didn't know any better you could swear he was trying to pose
>so fine, his hair looked good
>”just good?”
>fine, it looked… amazing?
>”that's better.”
>he hopped off the stage, absolutely beaming
>at least as far as you could see
>definitely liked praise
>you followed suit and hopped off the stage as well
>he pointed to his back
>”can you do me?”
>you did a double take before you realized he referred to his power cable
>it was connected to a socket right above his tail
>you removed it and slapped the latch back over the socket
>you had both needed the recharge it seemed
>well, you decided it was time to patrol
>the soft hiss of pistons and clink of metal on tile followed you down the darkened mall walkway 
>stores on both sides of you two sometimes played tricks with the shadows
>the empty stores were the worst though
>because technically they counted as part of your little jurisdiction 
>they had a be sweeped to any squatters 
>at least the robot taller than you provided comfort and a sense of security 
>he did make good company for this stuff
>the little noises his body consoled you as you went from each dark empty storefront and backroom
>occasionally he wanted to talk
>no idea why he was always hung up on asking if you thought he was pretty that day
>well, night
>but he made decent company regardless
>occasionally he'd bump into you as you checked out a room or turned a corner
>he was like a puppy tonight
>occasionally he'd want to look through stores 
>you'd take tours in some of them, given you had the keys
>normally you wouldn't be curious but outside of interactions with you he was mostly confined to that stage
>so you'd indulge him onyour walks sometimes
>you came across one of those novelty shops
>one of those places that sells bongs, fake faded Fazbear t shirts and tacky jewelry 
>none of the shirts would fit him but alright
>you'd seen the shit all the time
>but again, you reasoned he really hadn't 
>he seemed interested, it was more fascinating than the pretzel shop
>you flicked the lights on and let him explore
>big mistake
>the store was decent size
>about 30 feet wide and 60 feet set back
>the didn't need much stock room space
>usually the stuff sat on shelves for ages
>a key detail you forgot was the sex toys shoved into the back of the store next to the black lights and bongs
>this wasn't a kids store after al
>this was a very big mistake
>so of course Roxy came back holding a dildo 
>of course that had to be the first thing he saw and grabbed in here
>you weren't about to have a talking to from management about the children's entertained asking about fake dicks
>you snatched it from his paws and set it back
>he picked up a fleshlight and looked through it like a telescope
>this time he played keep away >given that he was taller than you it was an easier task
>”what are these for?” 
>this was not coworker discussion 
>you gave up trying to swipe the sex toy out of his hand after trying to jump for it felt humiliating
>or so he thought
>the second he let his guard down you climbed up him and grabbed it
>then you realized one small issue
>getting down after you scampered up him like a monkey
>paws grabbed your shirt and he set you down
>you were relieved he was approaching this calmly
>then he snatched the fleshlight back and ended up getting his claws in it like a Chinese finger trap
>you facepalmed as he grinned at you, proud of his attempt at prop comedy
>or maybe he legitimately didn't know what this stuff was
>hard to say
>you weren't in a hurry to clarify for him though
>again, management would probably have your ass 
>when you finally nabbed it back and set it back on a shelf you hoped that was the end of it
>he pointed to another fake penis 
>”is yours like that?”
>nope
>not doing this
>trying to lead someone bigger than you away from the section was easier said than done
>you had a feeling he knew what he was doing
>trying to get a rise out of you
>though he was probably still a little innocent
>not like his career let him have much experience in this field
>an obvious joke about groupies aside
>you finally enticed him by finding a Roxanne wolf novelty shirt
>sure she wasn't him, but he appreciated the attention 
>enough to finally drag him away from the allure of the sexy toy section
>the shirt was basic, one of those graphic tees
>a close up of a cartoon version Roxanne’s face with “let's rock” under it
>he looked a little perplexed 
>even between the shirt and him there were differences 
>he stroked his chin looking at you holding it up
>well at least he forgot about the naughty stuff for a moment
>you weren't paid enough to go over the birds and the bees with anyone
>”not exactly perfect but close enough,” he commented to himself mostly
>”so are you putting it on?”
>what
>you didn't have that intent
>it was just a distraction
>not that you said that aloud
>he looked down at you expectantly 
>fine 
>you'd wear the shirt
>but only for tonight
>you pulled your shirt off and could have sworn you caught him looking you over
>the Roxanne shirt on, he seemed satisfied 
>”see now the shirt looks better already”
>you decided to take your leave from the novelty store and Roxy followed
>he was chipper, more than usual
>the rest of the night went well
>shitty neighborhood or not, Roxy was welcome company
>you didn't know if he could actually make good on his height and strength but it would be a good deterrent 
>no more detours after the sex toy incident 
>you took another nap up on stage
>the second time he pleaded just enough you said fine to using his lap as a pillow
>you'd indulge him just this once
>maybe you were both touch starved enough to think it would be fine
>your head was wedged between his thighs and you passed out with him quietly watching over you
>sun cracked through the doors and you checked your phone first thing when you woke up
>your shift was almost done 
>glancing up, it seemed like Roxy put himself into sleep mode too
>when you got up he noticed immediately 
>you took off the Roxanne shirt with the intention of returning it but Roxy requested it instead
>you didn't need to hear about stolen merchandise 
>so fine, but you'd pay the store for it later
>make up some lie about needing a new shirt 
>he would just have to hide it under the stage or something until tonight 
>you stretched and then slapped on your old shirt
>the staff would trickle in slowly and that meant customers eventually
>Roxy would no doubt have a few shows
>you would be back late in the afternoon and explained as much
>”see you then,” his voice made it sound like a request
>you didn't imagine that
>yes you'd see him then
>he pulled you into a hug that threatened your ribs
