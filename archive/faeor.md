>the mall hired you on as a technician
>you knew how to hold a wrench and that pretty much qualified you
>the place was dying and desperate for new hands
>especially ones that would work for minimum wage
>so you were a wagie
>needed to pay the bills somehow
>as it turned out Fazbears whatever was still clinging to life
>how many lawsuits and shady shit they got into
>this time they'd branched out into leasing out the face of their properties 
>merchandise and shit
>cheaper than having a physical attraction
>just slap t shirts or shitty vinyl figures out there
>or just mass produce the robots
>that's where you came in
>see Roxanne the character had a following
>just enough to create demand
>sure she wasn't out Freddie's level of popularity 
>but she was more popular than the rabbit currently
>so your mall had purchased a robot
>plastered in a mass produced shell
>top of the line
>one small issue about your mall's Roxanne...

>with a mass production, faults sometimes pop up
>really it was impressive that the robots were as capable as they were
>and the technology was used for an entertainment industry
>a pizza chain, a fucking pizza chain, turned science fiction into reality
>wasn't too long ago you'd seen footage of robots that could barely count as bipedal
>to say nothing of what advances in AI you saw
>you weren't exactly some engineer or computer whiz
>you could maybe put together a PC if pressed to do it
>all your mechanical knowledge came from cars and what experience you could scrape together to bluff through here
>the AI was the really impressive thing
>no idea why a pizza mascot needed it but Roxanne was impressive 
>sometimes you almost felt like the robot was just a coworker
>one you had to diagnose like the kiddy rides and the occasional soda machine
>Fazbear industries was at least not too worried after they sold off merchandise 
>for better or worse
>made repairs comparable to fixing a tank out in the field
>a lot of improvising 
>there was a sort of quirk with this particular model
>this AI really did function like people and over time people also develop personalities and the like
>while it was impressive, it also meant you had a wolf robot done up like a female glam rock star who insisted he was a guy
>no idea how to handle that, you didn't like the idea of "correcting" the AI
>not that you knew how
>so your mall's Roxanne was a guy
>just a quirk
>you'd heard of other robots getting weird
>granted, the robot's chassis wasn't like what you'd seen elsewhere
>didn't have the stock female body the other's seemed to have
>his body wasn't built like a fridge like some of the older models, even had a sleeker edge about him
>while he still towered over some, there was a leaner shape to him that took away a little of the intimidation factor 
>also had a few other things you quite hadn't seen before with a robot
>maybe Fazbear had more intimate entertainment in mind for some models
>his body had male genitalia and a backdoor hidden under a metal pelvic plate
>you felt like it was above your pay grade and never had an inclination to ask
>you didn't dare ask Roxanne either
>sometimes it felt like a patient/doctor relationship and it felt easier with time to start thinking of Roxy as less an it and more a he
