#Name: Lan Jìngměi (蘭 静美)
Orchid / Elegant Peace: A name that could be considered a prayer that she be elegant and peaceful. Their wishes went unfulfilled, as Jingmei was neither elegant nor peaceful- she was a friendly, fearless, and terribly active child. That nature has maintained to this day, yet Jingmei has seen the wisdom in that prayer. While she isn't an elegant or peaceful woman, she does seek out a nice, quiet life- one away from all the bloodshed and schemes. Perhaps such yearnings are genetic?

##Tao: Object (Saber)
>Taoist Philosophy: Mortal
>Tao Heart: Heart Force (-10)
Countless cultivators use a saber, but few truly practice the Tao of the Saber. The way of the saber is to place all of one's trust into the saber, believing that practitioner and blade together are all that is needed to reach the peak of martial arts. Such Taoists believe that all schemes and tricks can be broken with a single strike, so long as man and blade can achieve true unity. Jingmei is somewhat of an outlier in that sense, as her Saber Tao is founded on speed rather than strength- the essence of overcoming profundity with simplicity remains however, so this Saber Tao can still be considered orthodox.

Specifically, Jingmei's Saber Tao is one of gentleness and freedom- a blade that cuts down those that should be cut down, but no others. A blade not bound by the cruelty of this era, the tyranny of the heavens, or the schemes hidden in the dark. Her Saber Tao is one that will carve open a future where everyone can live happily and enjoy a good meal together.

##Generation: Elder
>Qi Cultivation: Grade 6
>>Exotic Mortal Grade Spirit Root (-25)
>Body Cultivation: Grade 6
>>Common Mortal Grade Bloodline
>Soul Cultivation: Grade 6
>>Common Mortal Grade Mind Sea
Jingmei's bloodline and mind sea are as ordinary as ordinary can be- she's capable of cultivating, but that's all. Even her spirit root is of the lowest grade. However, she cannot be called talentless in that regard, as her spirit root possesses two rare attributes- Yin and Saber. An odd pairing, as saber techniques tend to be overbearing and forceful, unlike the delicate and conceding Yin. This pair of attributes has led her to take an unusual approach to the Saber Tao. Rather than brute force and valor, she relies on speed and precision.

##Taoist Roots: Martial Empire
>Circumstances: Bounty, Steep Decline (+20)
Although Jingmei has long since left her homeland, it nonetheless remains the root of her Tao. The New Moon Empire was a small martial empire near the border of the unknown expanse. It was founded by an immortal at the beginning of the current era in the hopes of slowly gathering resources for his practice away in the outskirts of society- in other words, he wished to be a big fish in a small pond. The son of that immortal became the first emperor of the New Moon Empire, and the title passed on from there. Said immortal hasn't appeared in nearly a thousand years however, and in his absence the already small empire has lost many soldiers and much land to the surrounding dynasties.

As a result, a genius of Lan Jingmei's caliber was cause for celebration. The military hoped she would avenge their lost brothers. The nobility hoped she would reclaim their lost land. Some even hoped she would attain immortality and once again assert the New Moon Empire as a local powerhouse. When she fled her homeland and became a loose cultivator, the disappointment cut deep. The imperial family even called in what little favors they had to issue a rather large bounty on her head.

>Comprehension: Divine Grade (-70)
##Techniques: (-50)
*Note: The first entry of each technique is the technique itself. Additional entries are examples of variations created with the technique innovation and second style advantages.

###Grade 6 Qi Gathering, New Moon Meditation (-10)
>New Moon Meditation:
The core legacy of the New Moon Empire, normally reserved for the royal family. This technique was acquired by the nation's founder in an old ruin in the Immortal Alliance Catacombs. Many traditions hold that the moon is the strongest on a full moon and the weakest on a new moon, but this technique claims the opposite- the moon is Yin in nature, and such brightness runs opposite to the nature of Yin. Instead, it is when the moon is fully hidden that it's true strength is made manifest. User's of the New Moon Meditation technique naturally cultivate using Yin Qi. The effects at their best during a new moon, or otherwise better in dimly lit environments than brightly lit ones.

For Jingmei, whose spirit root was already Yin attribute, this technique was naturally a good match (although she would have preferred a saber attribute technique instead.) However, Jingmei's version is incomplete. There was talk of giving her the complete version if she married into the empire's royal family... but clearly that never happened.

###Grade 6 Body Tempering, Blade of the Banquet (Free)
>Blade of the Banquet:
A rare body refining technique with a saber attribute. This particular technique is of Jingmei's own creation. The technique is as simple as such things can be- it places emphasis on living freely, fighting freely, and eating freely. For the best results, a balance of all three must be struck. Of note is the fact that 'fighting freely' doesn't need to mean 'fighting to the death'- as long as the user is being challenged in some way, then it suffices.

In some regard, it can truly be considered the culmination of Jingmei's gentle yet lively Saber Tao.

###Grade 6 Soul Refining, Ascension of Chang'e (-10)
>Ascension of Chang'e:
Widely regarded as the best soul refining technique in the New Moon Empire, in large part due to the fact that the empire views the moon as it's totem. This cultivation technique is based on the story of Hou Yi and his wife, the moon goddess Chang'e. In the legends, Chang'e ascended to the moon, leaving the loving couple forever destined to be apart. In order to cultivate, the user focuses on feelings of loneliness and longing. Similarly, the user can harness such emotions from others for their cultivation. Curiously, sometimes on a moonlit night the user can feel a distant but overwhelming longing, as if the moon itself was radiating lament.

If the postscript of the technique is to be believed, the copy that Jingmei has is incomplete- the true technique allegedly can be traced back to the true Chang'e of ancient times.

###Grade 6 Attack, Lunar Frost Blade (Free)
>Lunar Frost Blade:
An incomplete Yin Attribute saber technique focused on the deathly chill of Yin. The technique itself originates from the Crescent Moon Immortal Empire, a powerful ally of the New Moon Empire and the homeland of its founder. According to the technique's introduction section, it was created by the Frost Blade Immortal Lord, an ancestor of the Crescent Moon Immortal Empire. The technique is simple enough- a powerful slash of dense, frigid Yin Qi. Those struck by the attack will find the wound frozen over, rapidly draining the heat from their body. In theory, even an immortal could die to the harsh cold of this attack.

>Preserving Frost Blade:
A variation of the Lunar Frost Blade that has toned down the lethality of its frost in exchange for a higher overall output of Yin Qi. The result is a technique that almost acts like a weak sealing technique in how it freezes the target over without truly harming them. Although it's a handy tool for taking someone alive, the actual purpose of the technique (as implied by its name) is to preserve cooking ingredients via the cold.

###Grade 6 Barrage, Fading Silk Bladework (Free)
>Fading Silk Bladework:
A Yin Attribute saber technique that hides sharpness within softness. Each and every slash seems to blend together, and the wounds dealt are fine and subtle. Most opponents can't tell the afterimages from the real slashes, only realizing they've been cut after their body is riddled with wounds. Jingmei acquired this technique from a ruin inside the New Moon Empire. Apparently it was created by an assassin from an ancient empire who had slipped into the emperor's harem. On the assassin's suggestion, the emperor requested she perform a sword dance, never realizing that the performance he enjoyed had cost him his life.

>Dismantling Bladework:
"When dealing with large amounts of meat, it's vital slice it into smaller chunks, otherwise you can't heat it evenly when cooking. To avoid mangling the meat, one cannot use too much force! Swiftly and accurately divide the meat by cutting along its weak points, always using the perfect amount of force... What? Using this against people? No, that'd be weird. Butchering a person into steaks would just be creepy." (Jingmei mainly uses this variation of the Fading Silk Bladework to kill beasts and dismantle the corpses without damaging the soon to be ingredients.)

>Lunar Frost Blade & Fading Silk Bladework = Fading Frost Bladework:
While not as strong as the Lunar Frost Blade in terms of outright damage, Fading Frost Bladework is a debilitating technique that is truly difficult to fight against. It possesses the icy, frost-like Yin Qi combined with a seamless and subtle barrage of blows. The victims of this combination technique will quickly find their meridians, veins, and mind sea frozen over.

###Grade 6 Trump Card, The Calamity Cutting Saber (Free)
>Calamity Cutting Saber:
Lan Jingmei's ultimate move, and a technique of her own creation. This one slash composes all of her different strengths and focuses them into the edge of her blade- Qi, Body, Soul, and Heart. As a result, this technique can also be decomposed into four individual moves. The Immortal Cutting Saber, which rends magic, The Mortal Cutting Saber, which rends the body, The Soul Cutting Saber, which rends the soul, and The Heart Cutting Saber, which rends the heart. If one's only goal is killing, there is no reason to use these lesser versions of the technique. They exist instead to avoid cutting certain things- for example, the Immortal Cutting Saber can be used to sever a curse without claiming the life of the victim, and the Heart Cutting Saber can cut down one's despair itself. Most who knew of this technique believed Jingmei was obsessed with completely destroying her enemies, not leaving any form of their life behind. They never realized her goal was so naïve- a saber that severs misfortune itself.

>Hunger Cutting Saber:
A strange and bizarre transformation of the Calamity Cutting Saber. Taking the essence of cutting misfortune and adding in the sensibilities of an immortal chef, what was left was a harmless joke of a technique. This saber move cannot do any real damage, for what it cuts is hunger itself! Those struck by the edge of the user's blade feel overwhelmed by a sudden feeling of joy and satisfaction, as if they had just experience a full course meal of the world's greatest delicacies. Of course, this technique doesn't actually fill anyone's stomach, so after using it she usually starts cooking an actual meal for when the effects wear off.

>Fading Silk Bladework & Calamity Cutting Saber = Silken Calamity Saber:
Normally, the Calamity Cutting Saber's might is quite obvious to any observer, but with the addition of the subtle yin nature of Fading Silk Bladework, the aura of the technique is hidden deeply, like a knife quietly slipped among silk. To an outside observer, this slash is only the most ordinary and basic of movements.

>Lunar Frost Blade & Calamity Cutting Saber = Calamitous Frost Blade:
If the Calamity Cutting Saber is a technique that hides mercy beneath ruthlessness, then the Calamitous Frost Blade is a truly ruthless technique. Those struck will find their Qi, Body, Soul, and Heart each frozen over in an instant, leading to a quiet and sudden death. Jingmei herself doesn't care for this particular move, but it still stands that this combination of techniques is her deadliest attack short of activating her immortal armament.

###Grade 6 Reversal, Reverse Scale Saber (-10)
>Reverse Scale Saber:
An unorthodox saber technique focused on defense first and foremost. All dragons have a single scale that faces the wrong direction, and an attack landed upon it inflicts such pain that the dragon enters a murderous rage- or so goes the legend. The creator of the technique was a self-professed dragon hunter that observed the rage of his prey. The effects of the technique are simple enough- the user blocks any incoming attacks and after accumulating a certain amount of damage, the return it all in one overwhelming strike. Although it has the advantage of being able to reverse multiple attacks at the with a single use of the technique, it also bears a significant disadvantage- the counter-attack cannot be triggered early. If the enemy stops attacking before the counter-attack erupts, then the user can only let all the accumulated energy go to waste.

>Twice Fried Saber:
An even more unorthodox variation of the Reverse Scale Saber, the Twice Fried Saber is a purely defensive technique. Rather than accumulating energy to fuel a sudden and overwhelming counter attack, it disperses the energy into the air where the user can absorb it to replenish their own energy.

###Grade 6 Footwork, Myraid Shadow Steps (Free)
>Myriad Shadow Steps:
A common footwork technique widely used throughout all the world- odds are that any sect with an immortal level ancestor has this technique in its library. It excels in fast, flexible bursts of movement that leave behind after images of the user. This particular technique is truly ancient- who knows how many eras it's been around for?

>Myriad Kitchen Steps:
A curious transformation of the Myriad Shadow Steps. This variant pushes the after image ability of the myriad shadow steps to the extreme, allowing the user to truly act as if they're in multiple places at once. However, the focus and energy required to do so is more than any normal movement technique, making use in combat difficult. The main use of this technique is to cook dozens of different recipes at the exact same time, giving the illusion of a kitchen full of identical chefs. Sometimes she will even play the part of waitress as well.

###Grade 6 Profession (Cooking), Tao Tie's Cooking Manual (-10)
>Tao Tie's Cooking Manual:
A theory of cooking based on the legends of the Tao Tie. The famed evil beast could (and would) devour anything in the world, including the moon, sun, and stars. Carrying on in this way, the cooking manual has a focus on being able to cook any kind of ingredients. It even has recipes for cooking trees, mountains, and fire itself! However, in its pursuit of novelty it lost focus of gourmet meals in a conventional sense, leaving the meals produced unable to rival those made with more orthodox methods. The technique's original creator reached a bottleneck in its development as a result, leaving it unable to surpass the 6th grade. Hoping to find a solution, the technique was spread far and wide, and can be considered a very common technique- one used for novelty more than anything else. However, for Jingmei, this novelty technique was a perfect fit for her needs.

###Grade 6 Detection, Corporeal Soul (-10)
>Corporeal Soul, Formless Lungs:
A detection technique meant for those that practice both Soul Refining and Body Tempering. By mixing the senses of the soul and the senses of the body together, the two can achieve greater heights than they would alone. However, this process also means that the senses mixed together cannot function in a traditional manner. As a result, this technique specifically relies on sense of smell- allowing the user to 'smell' hidden dangers.

The technique itself is founded on the theory that the soul is divided into 5 parts, among which is the Po soul, which corresponds to the lungs and embodies the more animalistic aspects of the mind. This 'Po Soul' is used as a bridge to bring the body and soul into greater unity, sharpening the user's sense of smell to the extreme. The technique manual did not include an introduction to the creator's identity, but the methodology and insights found within seem to imply the techniques creator was a practitioner of medical tao that studied the relationship between the body and soul.

>Scents and Tastes of a Worldly Road:
A transformation of the 'Corporeal Soul, Formless Lungs' technique, which refines the more combat oriented technique into one more suited for an immortal chef. Rather than deepening ones sense of danger by unifying one's sixth sense and sense of smell, this technique unifies one's senses of smell and taste. This is primarily used to scout for rare cooking ingredients, but can also be used to detect poisonous substances.

##Advantages: (-35)
>Overflowing Charisma
For quite a while, Jingmei was the leader of an entire nations younger generation. That kind of lifestyle breeds confidence, and a certain amount of charisma. She's actually been trying to fix this, as it makes the wandering loose cultivator lifestyle rather difficult...

>Perfect Efficiency, Technique Innovation, Second Style
Even without her spirit root, Jingmei would still be a savant with a saber, if only for the fact that her understanding of techniques is far too deep.

##Treasures:
###Immortal Armament, The Xuanwu Overlord Wok
>Type: Other (Wok)
>Forging Method: Perfect Quality
>Material Quality: Like Divine Steel
>Spirituality: Treasure Spirit
>Talisman Inscription: Tao Treasure
>Miscellaneous Functions: Spirit Stone Slot, Inheritance Treasure, Life-Bound Treasure (Body)
A rather mysterious item, to say the least. At her lowest point, she purchased a turtle shell wok from a mortal market, intended to force some food into her stomach. Little did she expect that the result was simply delicious! Her ingredients were sub-par, and she herself was no immortal cook, so the quality of the meal she made surprised her... And at the same time it warmed her heart- never before had she known just how much good a tasty meal did for a weary heart.

As a godly tool for cooking, the wok brings out the best of every single ingredient. It's true nature is that of a Xuanwu's shell, refined into a cooking implement. The amnesiac soul of that same Xuanwu has become the treasure's spirit. It doesn't care to talk much, but it will silently make off with a portion of every meal the wok cooks- clearly the spirit has a love of food. In combat, the wok can theoretically be used to block attacks- it's more than sturdy enough to withstand any incoming attacks. However, the true threat of this treasure lies in its ability to cook! Once the talisman inscriptions are fueled, the wok produces an immense devouring force, as if a mouth the size of the world were breathing in with all its might! Anyone and anything absorbed by the wok is trapped within, slowly refined into cooking ingredients. Under this effect, even immaterial things like qi and ghosts can be cooked and served up. In fact, Jingmei once dared to cook up her own tribulation lighting! (Tribulation Lighting Steak ranks 2nd on her list of 'foods I most want to try again', and this is currently her strongest motivation to break through to the 7th realm.)


###Grade 6 Custom Treasure, the Little Willow Saber (Xiaoliu Dao) (-5)
>Type: Weapon (Saber)
>Forging Method: High Quality
>Material Quality: Like Divine Steel
>Spirituality: Low Spirituality
>Talisman Inscription: Mundane Treasure
>Misc. Functions: Life-Bound Treasure
Originally a mere Grade 1 saber. From the moment Jingmei first stepped foot into the world of cultivation, long before she had any kind of fame, she picked up this humble blade from a small, eccentric item refining business. The blade itself is only a foot long, and thin like a sword. Naturally, as it was originally the most basic of weapons, it lacks any kind of talisman inscriptions. It's current strength is purely a result of JIngmei's single-minded nurturing. While she acknowledges the might of her wok, this saber is her most precious possession.

##Auxiliary Treasures
Storage Treasure
>A ring filled with food of her own creation. Apparently it maintains freshness, yet she swears newly cooked meals are better, so these are merely her emergency rations.

#Trials and Tribulations
***

##Fatal Flaws:
None! I was originally going to grab Ruthless Warrior, but then I realized she'd never use her cooking variants of her techniques, and I couldn't have that.

##Background Information:
A few centuries ago, Jingmei was the rising star of her homeland. She couldn't be considered unrivaled in all the world, but in the small backwater region her New Moon Empire was nestled, she was truly the overlord of the younger generation. However, the higher she rose up the stronger the disconnect she felt with her homeland. Every day was an endless cycle- cultivation, warfare, political schemes, repeat. Was that really the immortality she sought as a little girl? Was there even any value in glory and influence? Her doubts piled higher and higher by the day.

She found her breaking point during a small ruin exploration. In the depths of the tomb, she found herself surrounded by her own allies and trapped in a formation- clearly they had arranged this beforehand, indicating that the nobles that arranged the expedition were conspirators. Yet none of that mattered, as such revelations were a common affair. What mattered was that among her turncoat allies was one of her few friends. They had known each other long before joining the empire's forces, and frankly she wasn't a bad person. Jingmei walked out of that ruin alone. Her former allies were mocked as small-minded and cruel, the nobles wormed their way out of any punishment, and she was 'placated' with consolation prizes for her survival... and yet she knew- that girl wasn't small-minded and cruel. She was diligent and kind... but she changed- or rather she was changed by her environment. The constant cutthroat scheming had worn her down until she lost her heart...

...would that be her fate too someday...?

As she pondered her fate, she passed through the local bazaar. Seeing the food stands in particular, she wondered when the last time she had a proper meal was. For years, she had avoided it after being poisoned at a local restaurant. Going a bit further in, she found some stalls offering various trinkets and antiques. Among which, she spotted a turtle shell wok. She purchased the wok on a whim, along with some ingredients on her way back out. Perhaps she could win back a bit of her life through learning to cook? Her menu was as simple as could be- fried rice and stir fry, both made with the most basic, mortal ingredients... and yet it was delicious. So much so that it brought her to tears. It was such a small thing, and yet it brought her more comfort than a decade of hard work.

And so Jingmei steeled her heart. She cashed in some of her contributions for an cultivator cooking manual, payed back what few benefactors she had, and visited her parents grave for one last time. She would leave behind her homeland and never turn back. Dealing with the bounty was difficult at first, especially without any backing, but she managed to walk her way out of every fight. She gradually realized the wonders of her wok during this time. Without it, she would have perished on several occasions when the older generation stepped forward for her bounty.

In spite of the difficulty, she felt no regret. The blatantly unfair battles tempered her bladework like nothing had before, while each and every meal she cooked filled her heart with satisfaction. The journey itself proved enjoyable as well- meeting new people, doing good deeds, sharing meals with new friends, expanding her horizons, and tasting new ingredients. Each and every one were moments she cherished far more than her memories of the empire.

A few centuries later, Jingmei has found herself strong enough to topple her homeland all on her own, but still has no intention of returning. Instead, she's found a new goal for herself- to taste every delicacy the world has to offer, each and every one cooked by her own hand! All the better if she can find a few friends to share it all with.

In terms of personality, Jingmei was originally quite cheery and optimistic- her time on the road brought that back to the surface. As a result, she tends to wear her heart on her sleeve. Whether she's happy, sad, or frustrated, it's always quite easy to tell- she only hides her thoughts when dealing with enemies or similar serious business. At the same time, she's fairly nosy and fearless- a combination far more threatening to her wellbeing than her bounty has ever been. Towards the villains that toy with the lives of others, she firmly draws her blade and challenges them. Towards the sick, despairing, and downtrodden, she happily offers a free meal and lends a patient ear. Whenever possible, she'll pursue and ending where everyone can be happy (including the villains if they aren't entirely irredeemable).
