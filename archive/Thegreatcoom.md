# Thegreatcoom's bots
Hello there dear anon, please come in and pursue my wares, I’m sure there will be something that tickles your fancy….

In all seriousness though, hello! I make bots since I enjoy the creative aspect of it as well as seeing them in action, so if you have any interesting logs feel free to post them.
I'm currently focusing on my studies which means that I won't have time for making that many bots, but if you want to contact me you can do so at - Thegreatcoom@proton.me
I've also written a rentry on bot-creativity, if you feel like checking that out - https://rentry.org/TGCsCreativityGuide
And my bots can be found here - https://www.chub.ai/users/thegreatcoom
