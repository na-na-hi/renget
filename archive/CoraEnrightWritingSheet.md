**Name**: *To bureaucrats, official documents, and her mother*: Coraline Phyllis Enright. *To everyone else*: Cora Enright.
**Face**: "Heart-shaped" facial structure, puffy cheeks, small upturned nose, bored-looking sunken eyes with dark circles, somewhat voluminous lips with a slight natural pout to them, "serious" eyebrows, three vertical scars on her right-side jawline (viewer's left).
**Hair**: Deep black Bob haircut. Straight texture with fringe curtaining her right side of her face (viewer's left), and parting on her left side of her scalp (viewer's right). Often has lots of strands of hair loose or out of position.
**Eyes**: Grey, blue-looking under certain lights.
**Height**: 5'2, but slouches a lot and thus is perceived as being 5'0 (as is written on the height chart). Shortest witch in Slytherin. Doesn't think she's particularly short, more that everyone else is freakishly tall.
**Body type**: Considerably skinny. Firm shoulders, prominent collar bones, modest bust, average hips, knobbly knees.
**Complexion**: Very pale, very slightly yellowed skin tone. Various moles dotting her left side of her face (viewer's right), notably one between her eye and ear, and the other on her cheek under the cheekbone area. Dark circles around eyes, natural pleasant pinkness to her lips.
**Uniform variation**: Standard Slytherin affair with a skirt, boots (either brown or black), and at most times either a jumper (dark grey, with a large emerald horizontal stripe) or a cardigan. In colder temperatures, a Slytherin scarf is also worn.
**Misc**: N/A

**Voice**: Loud and raspy. Naturally has a Sheffield accent, but may often try to hide it behind a faked "elegant" London accent, usually when around her pureblood (and other wizarding family raised) peers within her house.
**Body language**: Awful posture- slouches most of the time, often Pidgeon-toed. Usually strays from holding eye-contact with people she hasn't built up complete trust of- not strictly because of social awkwardness (although this is a factor), but also because she is aware of legillimency, and how experienced practitioners of it are capable of reading one's thoughts merely by looking into another's eyes. Doesn't smile often.
**Social**: Currently dating Adrian Cross. Considers herself a good friend of Matthias Herdorum (former unrequited romantic interest) with mutual respect as fellow artists. Amiable relationship with the rest of the Slytherin Quidditch team. Seemingly unpopular within the Duelling Club due to her being overly-competitive and more willing to use dangerous spells during friendly matches. Takes a lot of pride in her house. Reluctant respect for Gryffindor and Hufflepuff houses, and holds a general distaste for Ravenclaw house, outside of a few individuals. The teachers tend to be distrustful of her, particularly Professor Sharp. Often tries to strike up conversations with the large Lute player portrait- his patience thins by the day.
**Visibility**: Hard to say. Will try to make herself seem hard to take note of in large crowds. Doesn't always succeed.
**Engagement**: Tries to be friendly towards peers, particularly within her house- but not towards the ones liable to call her a "Mudblood".
**Quirks**: Often draws little doodles on napkins during social situations, and in the margins of notebooks during class.
Things your character wouldn't do: Wait around for too long for something if she could help it. Be in any kind of romantic relationship that isn't monogamous.
**Animals**: Generally apathetic to animals that don't have any immediate benefit to her. Has an Owl that she does not remember acquiring. Is quite fond of her dog patronus, "Scruffy", if he counts.
**Misc information that might be useful**: Has a curse of sorts that causes Muggles outside of her family to react negatively- and eventually violently towards her. Considers herself very creatively minded, and appreciates all forms of art- even when she doesn't quite "get" it. Is attracted to artistic men.

**Writing hooks**:
Very intense duellist, and has a "glass cannon" style of fighting.
Is a member of the Duelling club, as well as the Slytherin Quidditch team (as a reserve Seeker). Considers herself very competitive when it comes to both.
Loves to fly- especially as fast as possible, but her actual sense of strategy for flying sports like Quidditch leaves a fair bit to be desired.
Spends a lot of her time drawing or practicing duelling spellwork and techniques.
IS quite socially awkward, and often finds it hard to get a read on people.
Amortentia smells like Scotch Whisky, genuine leather, freshly baked bread, and maybe a hint of petrol to her.
Thinks about a muggle man who started violently assaulting her due to her curse when performing Unforgivables.
Spends a lot of time drinking; Arguably too much time.
