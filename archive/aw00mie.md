Cocky Wolf Roommate by anonymous

>anthro roommate is a cocky wolf
>constantly spouts homophobic and canine-supremacist "jokes"
>insists he's 100% straight and goes on about hooking up with bitches
>but never brings any home
>instead he keeps coming home drunk
>crawling into bed with you, ignoring any protests
>smothering you with cuddles and barely-coherent sweet-talk
>desperately riding your dick until he blows his load everywhere
>and finally passing out on top of you
>next day, he always acts like he has no memory of the sex
>defensively jokes that he was just using you as a body pillow
>refuses to acknowledge that you're covered with his dried cum
>or that he's got your own load up his ass
>just plays off all your implications as no-homo banter, as if you're joking around
>after putting up with your wolf roommate's shenanigans for several weeks, you start to figure out his hangups
>under his cocky surface, he's deeply insecure and self-loathing about his masculinity and his sexuality
>but he can handle an almost unlimited amount of homoeroticism so long as he can pretend like it's just ironic no-homo banter or horseplay
>this means that jokingly teasing him about being a fag makes him more comfortable about accepting physical intimacy
>over time, you're able to train him to accept hugs, belly rubs, and other casual cuddles using less and less irony to cushion the interactions
>he still needs alcohol before he's willing to cross the line to sex
>but you find that he doesn't actually need to be truly drunk for it
>it's just a coping mechanism, just like the ironic banter
>so you gradually wean him off the dependence, until having just one beer or a cider is enough for him to open up and fool around with you
>he's much better in bed when he's not drunk, very sweet and intimate
>still needy as fuck, but in a cute way
>after a while, you finally have a breakthrough
>instead of literally pretending like the sex isn't happening, he finally switches gears to "wow I can't believe we got carried away like that last night, but uh thanks for helping me out, haha no homo"
>around others, your wolf roommate/fuckbuddy continues posturing as macho alpha male
>but in private, he continues growing more and more relaxed and submissive towards you
>doesn't take long before he's not even using his bed anymore, instead coming to sleep with you as a matter of course
>usually after you "help him wind down" by pounding his prostate until he's a whimpering mess
>sometimes you bottom for him, but even when he's knotting you, you're still unmistakably the one calling the shots in bed
>eventually, even his public persona starts to mellow out a bit
>he's no longer going out to bars, getting in fights or putting on a fake show of trying to pick up girls
>instead, you're taking him out on dates... though of course the two of you don't call them that, it's just "hanging out" or "boys night" or whatever
>but no matter what he calls it, the two of you are acting like de facto boyfriends
>in a rare moment of honesty and vulnerability, one night he opens up about his feelings
>admits that he's never actually hooked up with a girl
>which he used to chalk up to performance anxiety, but now """jokingly""" accuses you of getting him hooked on "doing faggy shit"
>admits that he hates always having to act all macho and alpha just cause he's a big, masculine, tough-looking wolf
>confesses that it feels good to just let his guard down with you and let you "take over"
>you reach into a nightstand drawer
>he freezes when as you gently fasten a collar around his neck
>"d-dude, I can't-- I'm not supposed to-- t-this is too embarrassing, I'm not--"
>he's rock hard, and whimpers as you start toying with his erection
>you firmly explain that he's a good boy, he should just relax and let this happen
>he does
