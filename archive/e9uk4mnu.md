# Making Friends

Akari had awoken to yet another blip from her intricate, black data slate. Just another in what is possibly hundreds of messages from just the night prior. While still in the haze of the recent dream, a brave hand traverses out of the warm comfort of the protective duvet to retrieve the device that had disturbed her long journey through wonderland. One would think that the superior speed of a hunter of the night would also translate to dexterity capable of imputing a smartphone passcode, yet not even the powers of the demon within her would prevent her from fumbling a few times and having it fall onto her face once. Like the laughter of a mocking imp, several new messages had popped up while she was unlocking her phone. One after another, single lines of text transmitted over waves and wires continued to pelt her ears, preventing her from returning to that ever sweet slumber that was so rare to her.

"Okay, what the *fuck* is so important this time?!"

The phone had finally allowed her access to investigate the barrage of text, all of which were apparently sent by a single person. The icon was unfamiliar to her. In the small circle accompanied by the red bubble was a prim and proper white haired girl cropped to the bust from what was clearly a family portrait. 

Right.

The name made it obvious enough. After the altercation at 4th street, Akari had agreed to become “companions” with Hinako Shimeki. Ms. Shimeki was truly an unusual person, even by demon hunter standards. Her plan was to lure in all sorts of people to the abandoned building, and those uncooperative were simply turned into doll parts. The agony she had caused over the course of her plan was capable of producing multiple unruly spirits, as well as disturbing the territories of several different entity groups. So embroiled in her delusions that she could not see the pain she had caused to those close to her and around her. Luckily, Akari was only slightly less delusional, and she and Yoji were able to recognize the insanity of the situation. Unluckily for them, they were both at a disadvantage when confronting her scheme. That is to say that they got their shit kicked in during the fight. Eventually a deal was made and Akari agreed to some sort of play date this coming Saturday. 

The thought confused Akari. Saturday? Wasn't there something important during that day? And by some stroke of fate, there had. Right there in the calendar app was a special event she was not supposed to miss. A book signing event. Not necessarily for her, but for someone else. Old friendships are not broken so easily, yet hers did. Almost like she dropped off the face of the earth, Akari has only periodically seen her since she split off, but hopefully a signed copy would be the perfect welcoming gift to return to the now distant normalcy they once had. Of course, the problem with that was it would be impossible to reschedule with the pestering host as today *was* Saturday. Her perfect plans were foiled by imperfect judgments, and there was no way someone willing to text approximately two hundred messages and stickers the night prior would be willing to take a rain check on the day of the event. She probably had the place arranged by her servants just for the occasion, and even then, such unscrupulous behavior would be a diplomatic faux pas when the point of the agreement was to deescalate her behavior. No matter. If she was capable of handling herself amongst cultists and werewolves, she'd be capable of handling the mortal conundrum of schedules, hopefully. For now, all she had to do was prepare for the day ahead.

Akari was surprised by the address texted to her after scrolling for so long. Her place was in one of the blocks uptown that was close to a few high-end fashion malls that the youth, such as herself, would usually flock to. It's not something she'd expect a prim and proper lady to reside by, nor the emotional mess of a blob she had negotiated with earlier. Not only that, but she'd had resided on one of the highest floors of this grand beast of an apartment complex. There were barely any doors here, each property must've occupied a small house onto itself. With a careful push of the doorbell, she heard barely a whisper in the thoroughly soundproofed walls. The door was opened near instantly by a familiar looking maid, as though she were waiting by the door this whole time.

Ushered in by a force unbeknownst to her, the door closed instantly behind her. Distinct clicks had confirmed that, but it'd be rude to check, no, especially when so many servants had surrounded her at the entrance. The room before her was similarly as baffling as her address. Sleek black and white patterns in simple geometric shapes, signs of high class taste while still keeping a non-intrusive look for its residents. But there was something off about it. It was dark. The only lights came from specific spotlights dispersing a warm glow onto frameless glass displays. And the other was the sudden music that started to play as soon as she entered. Plucked strings on a harpsichord played in layered tunes as the host had finally revealed herself.

"Uuu... G-greetings?"

Such grand entrance, such a proud stance. Yet the tone of her voice and constant off-balance sway told Akari everything she needed to know. Right, the plan. If she could get her to at least move venues, she could handle both tasks at the same time, or as most common folk say, kill two birds with one stone.

"My, what wonderful establishment you seem to have here, Ms... A-anyway, It's such a wonderful day, wouldn't it be a waste to spend our time here at your place?"

Hinako visibly shuddered at the question. A reaction so visceral that she either had a strict plan for this event, or disliked leaving the apartment for some reason. Regardless, this may affect the strategy moving forward.

"Wait! I-I have something for you!" And without warning, all the servants started to push both into the dining area. In perfect unison, like a factory assembly line, each one did their part to set the candle-lit table before them. Complete with a sloppy chocolate cake straight from the fridge. Portions already pre-sliced and paired with fresh tea. The music similarly seeming to change octave to match the tone.

"Oh, cake... What a wonderful surprise." Though clearly hand baked, at least it was Akari's favorite flavor. 

"I-I knew you'd like it." Hinako said while beaming an awkward smile at someone appreciating her hard work.

The conversation went on and on, mostly with Akari prompting Hinako to elaborate further and push the dialogue solely through her own stories. While it did burn away the very precious minutes she had, right now it was more important to play into her hand so that she could play into Akari's.

"A-ah, my, how wonderful... Could you elaborate how hair is chosen for such purpose?"

While Hinako went on about the process of wig making, Akari carefully snuck her phone out to check the minutes left. 2 hours, plenty of time to make it to the station to-

"W-what are you doing?"

Akari almost jumped back from the question. You could almost hear the record scratch at that moment. For one reason or another she had found out, yet none of the maids were anywhere close to her for them to notice either.

"I... I-I was checking a few messages."

"Oh." Hinako's eye started to glow a hazy pink, like a fresh mist of blood one would see from splatter flick. "Keep your attention on me, please."

"O-of course! Why would one not heed every beck and call of a fine craftsman such as yourself?"

"Right, Now where was I?" The glow from her eye started to subside as she went back to her musings. "Ah, yes. I was wondering if you'd like to take a tour of my collection?"

Before Akari could say a word to protest, she nodded to the question.

"Of course you would, I always know what my friends want."

Hinako put both hands together and smiled to Akari accepting the offer. Without a single word, servants had appeared behind each other's chair to stand them from the table. Before long, they were going from shelf to shelf as Hinako explained the history of each doll in their case. The maids themselves were not too far behind each and every step. Through the droning speech about the history of each creation, there was at least respite in how interesting they were visually. One of the dolls that caught Akari's attention was a masked doll with long, black hair. While its design was a bit unconventional compared to the other dolls wrapped up in the finest silks, what was most noticeable was that the doll did not have a case of its own. Rather, it was alone on its stand atop a pedestal, open to the air around it. It even had a bit of dust on one of its-

"Don't touch that!"

Akari's hand was suddenly yanked away from the display by an unknown force. She was pulled so forcefully in fact, that she fell over backwards on one of the servants following closely. It was embarrassing enough to fall over, but the servant didn't even try to resist... 

her... 

Just as she was pushing away at the body that caught her fall, she felt something. It was hard, no, her whole body was hard. As cold and as hard as the same dolls that lay stuck in their glass prisons. The maid stood up like a puppet on a string, bringing Akari along with her. But all she could think of right now were the many fake eyes that gazed upon her folly. She could feel her own heart race. How that stranger's blood flowed all around her body, even to her flushed cheeks. But she could not sense the blood of the hundred other paired eyes that stared blankly back at her. She was alone with the monster. One that could pull vampires apart limb from limb with her strings, and the face that greeted her was not exactly happy with how she had almost sullied her creations.

"..." 

Silence stung the air, and she stood above the rest. Only she would have the final say on what goes on in this apartment, and all Akari could do was try to ease the situation again.

"C-could you show me how one creates the dolls, as y-you've told?"

The now faint harpsichord grew louder from one of the unopened rooms, though a happy melody, it was still layered in discordant notes.

"Ah, it's so nice of you to take an interest in how I make these!" Hinako said, using the same clapping mannerisms she had used before. Except now, it didn't feel as performative as the first.

"Right this way." The door to the harpsichord room opened. And now, Hinako's eye glowed in a dark purple.

Akari had that same force push her along. She was still reluctant after her discovery. This demon eye bearer could potentially hold an eye that could weaponize any object around her. Who knows what other dolls lie in wait at the workshop? She had to at the very least minimize the other's involvement should a fight break out.  

"W-wait!" Everything pushing her towards the workshop stopped in their tracks.

"W-would it not be preferred for only I to marvel solely at your skill? I perceive that other beings may h-hinder a more intimate appreciation of your work."

Hinako considered it only briefly, yet unexpectedly accepted the proposal. Without a word, all the servants slid their way back into one of the far off doors away from the entrance. Her face hidden away as they took on the final phase of their now private tour for the afternoon. At least she was back to rambling on about dolls again. Or so she thought.

As Akari tried to check the time again, hoping that there would be less prying eyes than before, another thing was waiting beyond the screen. Hinako's piercing glare that dug towards her very soul. 

"Didn't I already tell you? Who could be so important right now that you won't even listen to me?"

Though Akari's life was flashing before her eyes, that was the least of her worries as she took a step back.

"I thought you wanted to know more? You said you wanted to know more."

It seems selfish at the moment, but Akari really did *not* have the time for this. Even accounting for the walk from the station to the store, it she would only have maybe forty five minutes left as she took two steps back.

"Why don't you like me? Why can't you love me like you always do?"

"L-look Ms. Sh- Sha... I-I..." What was her name again?

Before Akari could find the right words to say, she bumped towards one of the closets behind her, enough to cause whatever was inside to fall. It was another doll just as big as her. It even had similar hair, similar clothes... By god, it was her. All her features captured in near perfect polymer form.

"I, I can explain!"

Akari knew that something was up. There was going to be some sort of trap somehow. She should've seen this earlier! How could she not realize that she had some sort of mind-altering powers? Subliminally suggesting her to ask about the workshop so that she would be replaced! What folly! Only a mere mortal would make that mistake! Akari made no hesitation. With box cutter in hand, she ran out the room and quickly shoulder checked the main entrance door and tumbling her way out to the hall. No point waiting for the elevator. Akari then proceeded to the nearest flight of stairs, broke all the lights with her blood, then rode the shadow all the way back down the lobby.

Her favorite outfit was torn, she had cuts and bruises all over, but at least she made it out. Hinako tried to stop her from leaving the apartment using a binding aura, but Akari was willing to risk severed limbs just to get away. She didn't have the time to change out, nor would she make it to get that gift either way. Her diplomatic attempts were likely a failure, and it's near impossible that they would ever be in good terms ever again. So all she could do was rest for the work ahead of her.
