####Japan, 14th of February

*Ah, Valentine's Day. Though certainly not as popular in the land of the rising sun, it continues to be a day of romance as young women give special chocolates to the men they deem special, and parks and fairs put out special items and offers dedicated to the couples of the clientelle. It is in one of such fairs that our story begins, in a pier at the edge of the sea, as an disheveled delinquent, dressed rather lightly for the cold of winter, stands alone, tapping his right foot in disgruntlement, weirding out the passersby as he aggressively wanders about, thinking to himself.*

***%red%Where the hell's that trash?! I've been waiting in this shitty fuckin' fair for far too long! I'm tired of staring at all this sugary bullshit!%%***

It was **Michita Ikari** - known also by his title within the Demon Hunting Club, the Mad Screamer. A fellow of a foul mouth and even fouler attitude. Though his near-constant bouts of anger had become all but expected a long time ago by his fellow students, his mood seemed to be particularly bitter today. And although not the source of it, his sudden assignment to a mission to hunt down a possible Rogue Entity apprently said to be hiding within this fair had by no means improved it - an odd event, by itself, for Ikari certainly did not usually dislike a chance to spend his considerable rage in a manner that would not get him hunted down by his own club members.  Today, however, this did not seem to be the case. 

%blue%"Michita-Kun!"%%

For a certain reason. 

The schoolboy turned his head, and saw the recent arrival - his classmate and fellow club member, **Kuro Mithran**, also known as the Undefeated Knight, wearing what seemed to be a rather conspicuous winter longcoat. In her hands, she carried a sizeable 'phone', known better by those within the Hunting Circles as a *data slate.* She motioned to the delinquent, her expression a mix of calm and slight worry, as if expecting him to detonate like a bomb the moment he had seen her. 

%blue%"My apologies for being a little late, I had some things to do..."%%
%red%"You fuckin' better apologize, trash! I've been waiting here for way too long! Do it again and i'll make you regret it!" %% he answered, angrily.
%blue%"Sure, Michita-Kun...are you ready to start hunting this Entity?"%% she replied back.

He huffed in frustration, crosssing his arm as he responded with an noncomittal 'sure'. In truth, there were not many who could have offered such a reply without invoking the wrath of the Screamer. Amongst the exceptions, Mithran Kuro was one of them - though just barely, and due to the same reason why this woman had been the very same to cause his foul mood - for Machita Ikari possessed a considerable **crush** on her. From an outside perspective, one might have very well thought such a feeling to be impossible for the likes of him, but despite all his rage, Ikari is but a teenage boy, and the bodysuit wearing knight had hit every single aspect of his preferred type. Though he certainly denies it to himself - it is a feeling that has taken root in the highly pressurized valve of his heart. And when he did not receive even the customary  *obligation chocolate* that some of the girls within the Demon Hunter club, her included, had given to its male members in that very same day, that pressure had begun to build up.

*%red% Hmph! It's not as though i care about her shitty chocolate anyway...but no one gets to insult me like that! Damn trash...%%*

Mumbling to himself, he continued following her as Mithran explained the situation, sporting a calm look. %blue%"It's been predicted that sometime soon, a Demonic Rogue Entity will be taking form in this pier and going on a rampage. It is our duty to put it down and save the civilians. We must keep our watch until then. Though it shouldn't be much of a challenge for the both of us..." %%

They passed through booths and trailers selling every manner of sweets and knicknacks, and even some games, such as a ball throwing tent offering a number of large creature plushies as prizes. Ikari, stomping forward as he let loose chain after chain of angry complaints over almost random subjects, suddenly saw something in the corner of his eye that catches his attention. He slowly stopped, before retracing his steps, and looking at it. In the depths of the Shateki Shooting Gallery, he found it! It was a box of sweets - but not any sweets, a box of expensive, high-end mochi! From his favourite shop, that you had to stand in a line for an hour to get! There were two of them, available to those who had managed to achieve the highest possible amount of points. Immediately, his mouth curved into a devilish grin. Mithran, seeing he had, stopped, turned to face him.

%blue%"What is it, Michita-kun? Have you seen something?"%%
%red%"Yeah, i've seen something! Something real good! It's a box of expensive-ass mochi! And i'm getting it. " %%
Mithran sighed.
%blue%"We're in the middle of a mission, you know. We can't stop just becau-"%%
%red%"If you don't want it then keep going ahead, woman! I don't give a **shit** about your stupid mission. " %%

The knight pinched her nose, halfway between anger and acceptance, knowing very well how irredeemably stubborn the delinquent could be. Knowing  she would certainly be stuck waiting, her often unseen gluttonous side began to surface. She, too, would have enjoyed a box of sweets. %blue%*It's not like there's any danger...the entity might not even appear, riight?* "%% She pressed her fingers together.
%blue%"Fine, but i'll participate too."%%
%red%"Wasn't askin' you for permission, trash." %%

And the two walked over to the booth, where a bored man read a magazine. As they approached the counter and stated their intent to play, he explained the rules - a 2000Â¥ entry free, ten balls, and ten moving targets - each two hits got you a new tier of prizes, no carry-overs. Forking over the money, the two received their ammo, and Kuro was the first to play. Her eyes narrow, and she lets out an almost automatic burst of fire! As if possessed by the spirit of a veteran marksman, she hits shot after shot after shot! She does not misss a single time. Her experience in handling weapons during demon hunting has proven perfect. Immediately, she asks for the box, and the incredulous carnie complies, giving her the selection of sweets. Ikari, scoffing, pushes his way in, and prepares to shoot!
.
.
.
%red%**"NOT A SINGLE HIT?!?!!"** %% 

He screams, almost crushing the bearing ball gun within his grip. He looked at the targets before him, every single one of them standing upright as if to mock him. He had not managed to hit a single shot. Breathing heavily, his anger flared again, and bloodveins popped up in his head! Holding her box, Mithran stepped back, knowing what come next. The employee swallowed dryly.   %red%**"THIS IS FUCKIN' BULLLLLLLLLLLLSHIIIT!"**   %% He screamed, and threw the gun.

Onlookers around immediately turned their heads as a loud CRACK sounded in the barrack. The weapon had imbedded itself within the wall, like a javelin or dart...and right besides the tent worker! He looked back and forth, as if not believing what had happened, before collapsing to the ground, having fainted from the shock. Ikari crossed his arms.
%red%"Damn. I missed again." %%

After a two minutes of running from the scene, the two teenagers finally came to a stop, and set on a bench, taking a minute to regain their breath. he morning  was peaceful, with a light breeze coming from the seas and the chatter of visitors filling the air around them. Mithran, holding her box tightly, looked at it with desire. Undoing the wrap, she gently opened the lid, looking at the selection of sugary spheres laid out beneath her. Daifuku, Sakura, Hishi...and  *Sour Citrus.* - the flavor of choice of the spiky-haired delinquent standing right beside her. Kuro looked to her side, watching Ikari stare at her box with a distinct eye of jealousy.  She stared at the box. And then back to him. At the box. Then back to him. She fought a mental battle for a moment...and then relented
%blue%"Hey, Ikari-kun...ya wanna...split this box?"%%
Immediately, the delinquent's faced gained a deep blush, and he began to stutter. %red%"Sp-sp-spspsplit?"%%

Mithran suddenly realized the meaning of her words in that certain day, and her face became like a beet. %blue%"W-wait, i dont mean it like *that!* I'm just offering you some since it's your favorite!"%% She waved her hands around in denial. Ikari, for no particular reason finding himself more displeased by that comment than by his lack of sweets, replied angrily, his face still with a rose-colored tone. %red%"O-of course I knew that, trash! Like I'd ever accept a chocolate from you! Damn trash!"%% Yet feeling awkward still, he lunged forth, plucking a sweet from the box before crunching on it mercilessly, chewing the sweet angrily in an attempt to avoid the discussion. 

The topic momentarily avoided, the two teenagers ate the box of expensive candy together, and then went back to the mission they had been sent to accomplish in the first place.

Yet after ten minutes of silent walking, Ikari seemed to be less than pleased. %red%"Where the fuck's this damn demon? I came here to pulverize something, not to walk around!" %%
%blue%"You're right, something should have popped up by now...I know!" %% she decided, pointing her finger at a nearby structure.  %blue%"We'll go on that ferris wheel!" %%
%red% "Huh?!" %% he exclaimed, a faint red color rushing up yet again at the mention of the ride
%blue%"The Dataslate might be able to read any energy readings around the area if we're high enough. %%
%red% "F-fine then. I'll follow your shitty plan. But if nothing happens i'm going to tear this shitty pier apart to make that demon appear." %%  he replied, despite not needing to go together in the wheel with her for such a plan. Walking up to the giant contraption, they bought their tickets, though not before Ikari almost broke the conductor's spine for suggesting they were a couple. As they took their seats and their box began to move, Ikari's unusual behaviour continued even more, as his usual state of seething anger was seemingly neutralized. Mithran held the data-slate within her lap.

 The ride was a silent and tense one, as the two teenagers seemed to stare at anything but each other, realizing perhaps the connotations of their current 'scenario'. When they were just about to reach the top, the box stopped, as it often did, and Kuro put her data-slate away. She turned to the delinquent, and prepared to speak. %blue%"Ikari-Kun, I..."%%

A sudden shadow covered them both, and time slowed down to a crawl. Outside the box, floating right beside them, a darkened creature suddenly appeared, and before the two of them could blink, Ikari and Mithran were sent flying - They zipped through the air, spinning and turning.  It had been sudden attack! Thrown into the ground, they fell at full force against the fair's building, tearing through them like a wrecking ball. Stopping roughly several hundred meters away from the source of the attack, Ikari almost immediately burst from the mess of tents and rubble burying them, ripping his tattered shirt apart with his bare hands as his rage reignited.
**%red%"WHICH FUCKING SOON TO BE CORPSE DID THIS?!"%%** he roared, demonic energy surging as  blood-red scales encased his arm. It was his cursed arm!  In the distance, the being responsible for this stood - and he was not alone. A myriad of demonic beings, many of them over two stories tall, had begun rampaging in the pier, civilians running and screaming in chaos from the attack. Yet most peculiar was their shape - for these beings resembled plushy toys! Twisted and corrupted beyond all comprehension, they were now hideous beasts with horns and claws as if they had come straight from a modern horror game!
%blue% **"It's the damn rogue entities they were warning us about...that's way more than a simple demon! That was an second level aura, at the least!"** %%

Immediately turning to the voice, the delinquent saw Mithran, dusting herself off from the wreckage. Yet where once was that calm, knightly demeanor, was only tension! Mithran had allowed her aggressive side to come forth. %blue% "And just when i don't have my Multitool Blade...In that case, all that's left to do is..." %% Inbetween her hands, an golden glow began to take form as she summoned forth an bastard sword. She casts off her winter coat, revealing the armoured bodysuit beneath. %blue%**"To purge them all with my own hands!"**%%

Ikari's heart skips a beat.

In that time, the sudden surge of energy from the two had alerted the warband of entities at last. Turning to their new foes, the pack of beasts begins walking, then sprinting! They break off in pursuit of them at full speed! The two teenagers, simmering with anger and aura, share a look. They begin slowly walking towards the approaching horde, stepping over the rubble.
%blue%"Let's see if those muscles are more than show, Screamer."%%
%red%"Don't underestimate me, you stupid fuckin' trash. I'll break you in two."%%
%blue%"I'll be happy to let you try ~ think you can take out half of them first? "%%
%red%"I'll pound them into pulp before you can draw your shitty sword."%%
%blue%"Is that a challenge? Fine..."%%
%red%**"First to fi**%%%blue%**nish wins!"**%%

And with that, they began their attack!

Immediately, the two teenagers disappeared into a blur of movement, surprising the wooly beasts with their superior speed. Suddenly, one amongst their own was split cleanly in half! A mere second later, another is impacted by an explosive force, obliterating it's upper torso and showering the pier below with blood-soaked cotton! It was the two hunters, and Mithran had started with an advantage! The horde was upon them! The entities, powerful beings of their own rights, attacked in frenzy, attempting to hit their diminutive foes! Yet it was to no avail! Mithran flew past them, cutting beast after beast like an woodsman upon a tree! Ikari jumped through them, each strike like a siege cannon fired at point blank! Their scores were matched! 

But a mere five minutes had begun since the start of their fight, and already their killcount was in the dozens! The horde had been whittled down to but one enemy left! Falling to the ground after having defeated another two beasts, the hunters found themselves back to back! They stared at their last enemy - the one who had first attacked them during the ferris wheel, who possessed a level two aura! With the visage of a blue tiger, it let out it's demonic roar! The deciding point! With a wide grin on their faces, they began to run, run towards the beast! Arriving first, Ikari launched a jumping uppercut into its jaw - yet unlike it's compatriots, it did not go down! But a second later, Mithran arrived with a slash - to the same result! His durability was indeed strong - yet the two had only begun to have their fun! They launched attack after attack, never letting th entity a moment of rest as one chained the other! They attacked in perfect sync! It was a true dual combo! 

Injured, the beast slammed the ground, almost bringing the pier to the sea with a shockwave that sent the both of them back into the ground! They shared a look - and knew what to do! Entering a stance, Ikari extended his hand - and Kuro grabbed it, one-handing her sword! Fingers interlocked, he began to spin, spin, spin, until their form was a blur - and then threw her! She zipped through the air, faster than any bullet, and within the blink of an eye, the demon's left arm was cleft from it's socket, destroying the summoned sword with it! It screamed in pain, and the duo now found themselves on opposite sides of the blue tiger! It was time for the last attack! They charged, faster than ever before! Through the rubble and gore! Yet the demon could do nothing but watch! They jumped, and focusing all their auras within their cursed arms, delivered a synchronized piercing punch, exploding the demon from both sides in a shower of gore! 

**DRAW!**

The game had ended with a draw! And as the last monster was toppled, falling off the pier into the beach below, Mithran and Ikari fell to the ground, landing at last! Although their kill points were individually matched, they had as a team of hunters achieved a resounding victory! As their demonic arms returned to normal, Machita beat his chest in a show of victory! %red% "**Fuck** yeah! Die, you miserable bastards! I'll keep ripping you apart, one by one!" %% 
he turned to Mithran, who had by now begun to settle down in her rage, suppressing her bloodthirsty persona.
%red%"You wanna fight me next trash? We got the same killcount! The game ain't over yet! Let's settle this!" %%
She sighed.
%blue%"Always so angry, huh, Ikari-kun? I don't feel like fighting anymore." %% replied Mithran, approaching Ikari. Her mouth began to form up into a small smile.
%blue%**"Though, It does seem a shame to end on a draw..."**%% she continued, the two now dangerously close. Ikari stutttered - %red%"H-huh?"%%, as his cheeks began to take a crimson tone, and Mithran's face became ever closer. Yet as he began to ask what she was about to do, he was stopped as Mithran pulled him into...a kiss! Yes, as you've read it -a kiss! Immediately the delinquent froze up like a cat grabbed by its scruff, shocked into a state of non-action as the two shared a moment of passion. After what felt like minutes, Mithran pulled back, a string of saliva connecting them as the only reminder of their act. Ikari's face, usually reddened with anger, now found itself with a new shade of red - the red of blushing! Silent still, he was unable to utter a single word. Mithran turned around, walking several steps away before slowing to a stop. She began to speak...
%blue%"Hey, Ikari-kun...%%
She turned around, revealing a face even redder than his!
%blue%"D-don't forget to visit me in the club later alright? I  st-still haven't given you your chocolate! %%
She uttered, and ran away with her face between her hands.

*Valentine's Day... Though certainly not as popular in the land of the rising sun, it continues to be a day of romance as young women give special chocolates to the men they deem special. Young love, awkward as it is, begins to sprout it's first petals. And with that, this sugary story between two students comes to a close. Mithran Kuro, blushing like a schoolgirl, ran to her home without stopping a single second, the red tint in her face standing at great contrast with her blood-soaked clothing. And Ikari Michita...well, he continued frozen in shock, until the police had arrived to the scene, and he was almost arrested! And though he would later return to his aggressive demeanor, for the rest of the week, when he believed himself to be alone, his face turned into an genuine smile.*
