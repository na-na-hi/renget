>Soujyuuro Imai HN "Mahoudeva"
"Noah will be cheering for Imai!"
While acting out of spite is not exactly something Noah would endorse, he understands it is as much of a powerful motivator as faith is for himself and fully supports Imai's drive to become a hero; far better than that spite being driven towards evil at least. Noah would have absolutely zero mistrust or suspicion towards Imai regardless if he knows or didn't know the true nature behind Mindbreaker.

>Christopher Cain HN "Mirror Devil"
"Noah should have listened to him more during the battle... everybody else too, of course, but Chris is the smartest in the class, he must have had good insight."
Noah is amazed at how good Chris' grades are despite not participating often in class and takes care to heed his trivia, eagerly listening to him when he rambles about whatever he wanted to talk about. Also as his desk neighbour, Noah points out any customs and behaviour Chris doesn't remember or didn't follow.

>Sandatsu Owari HN "Reaper"
"He seems quite lonely..."
Despite being seated next to him, Noah doesn't really know Sandatsu very well, his attempts at interacting with his desk neighbour have only lead to being shut down. That won't stop Noah from continuing to try though.

>Son Jugo HN "Aspara"
"Jugo has been the most receptive to reading the scripture with Noah, though his interpretations and connections are... worrying. Noah can only hope he does not take an extreme approach in the future."
Noah has a higher opinion of Jugo beyond the simple martial-minded fighter most people make him out to be, mostly because of his willingness to read the bible. Though Noah is worried about the radical mentality Jugo is taking from it, he is torn between pushing his own views onto Jugo's interpretation, or letting him be with his own understanding and whatever consequences that may come with it (also because he sees merit in what Jugo said).

>Yui Sagara HN "Capture Cloth"
"How wonderful! Even if not by her own will, to face the darkness in one's own heart is something to be admired and should never be shamed. I pray with all my heart that she stay her course, and should she ever waver, I am always there to help her on her way."
"Noah should also apologize to her about that wafer..."
Yui is a great source of inspiration to Noah, someone seeking to atone for their past villainy being something he is enthusiastic about and drives him forward in his impossible dream. He believes she has a real desire to atone despite being given an ultimatum, even if for no other reason than the fact that she hasn't chosen to run away from her responsibilities.

>Chihiro Mitsurugi HN "Ascetic Sword Hero: Yako"
"What a strong girl. I truly hope she finds the redemption she seeks... but she should know that she does not need to bear that burden alone. Anyone can stumble on that road, and anyone can stand back up, but there are times when your legs are too weary and another hand is just what you need."
While Yui and Chihiro are similar in their journey for redemption, Noah acknowledges their stories and personalities differ, as such he is much more restrained towards Chihiro due to not wanting to come off as patronizing. He still offers his sympathies and would gladly help her out, but he takes care not to be overbearing about it. He thinks if he goes too far, it would just cause her self-esteem to go lower.

>Ashleigh Katsuragi HN "Blackout"
"She is a good friend. Noah hopes she can be more outgoing in the future."
Like with Imai, Noah has a supportive attitude towards Ashleigh and hopes talking with her more often will help break her out of her shell to be more outgoing. He also believes she can become a highly sought out hero assitant because of how useful her quirk is and how hard working she is. Noah does wish she doesn't feel so embarrased when they talk, but at least she's learning to ignore that feeling.

>Victor Sigurd HN "HYDRA"
"Noah respects his ability to separate work and play, but Noah hopes he learns his value is not just the strength of his quirk."
"... because of me he got hurt, badly. I need to make it up to him somehow."
Noah has briefly seen the lax side of Victor in the boy's locker room and respects how easily he switches between being a disciplined student to a rowdy frat bro. Noah didn't really have a good reason to interact with him often until after the training battle, where of all the things Noah regrets, letting Victor get severely hurt under his leadership became number one on his mind.

>Spherethirst Girls
"Noah was taught if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all. Noah will just hope they learn to be kinder..."
Simply put, the girls are the types of people Noah has the most difficulty dealing with. He doesn't dislike them, but he doesn't like them either, which is still saying a lot. It is a bit odd that out of the class, they're the only ones that rub him the wrong way; the reason being Noah likes taking people at their word, but he has rarely felt any sincerity from them unless they were being vitriolic. He would never admit this, of course, and still tolerates them enough to help if they asked or has to tell them to be nicer. He does have better opinion of Minerva and Hailey though, mostly because of Bobby and Hifumi drawing the sincerity out.

>Kaylee Suzuki HN "Flying Force"
"Noah is proud to be Kaylee's language teacher, she has been a very good student. She seems to feel indebted towards Noah though... maybe Noah can learn some martial arts from her?"
Noah considers Kaylee to be one of his best friends in the class. He frequently hangs out with her and his presence is a natural repellent for the Spherethirst clique. He also has great respect for how strong she is and is considering to ask her about teaching him how to fight better, half because he wants her fto stop feeling like she owes him, and the other half because he really does want to learn how to fight better after letting her down in training.

>Shinkan Sen HN "Crazy Train"
"He is a bit... hardheaded (haha) when he gets emotional, but Noah knows he means well."
Noah has friendly interaction with Shinkan, thinking nothing of his appearance or his proclivities of eating coal... although Noah does want to know what it would feel like to sit on Shinkan's shoulder while he ran at full speed. The smoke might be a problem though.

>Sora Tanaka HN "Orbit"
"He was very strong in the training battle."
Noah has no strong opinion about Sora. Like with Imai, he has a similar opinion about Sora's reason for being a hero, that it is not something he would praise, but better Sora be driven to heroics than the opposite. Noah does have high opinion of Sora's quirk and his control over it though.

>Genma Gō HN "Kinji"
"Conflict between family is always a tragedy, Noah hopes they can reconcile somehow."
Brother turning against brother is a tale as old as time, but it is nonetheless disheartening for Noah to see and hear about. He is glad that Genma has held onto becoming a hero despite his experiences, and hopes he remains on that path.

>Hifumi Takeda HN "Challenger"
"Noah feels inspired to do 110% whenever Hifumi is around."
Noah admires Hifumi's uncompromising confidence and eagerly tries to match up to his enthusiasm. With his cool demeanor, Noah recognizes Hifumi as a sort of 'older brother' figure. 

>Bobby Samson HN "Sunlight Man"
"Waow~! Father has told Noah stories about Sun Man, to think his son would be Noah's classmate. Hmm... he seemed to have a bitter look when Noah brought his father up though..."
As superficial as it is, Noah has a natural affinity towards Bobby as a fellow sun enjoyer, also recognizing him as another 'older brother' with Hifumi. If they got close enough where Bobby felt comfortable sharing about his issues being in his dad's shadow, Noah would be willing to listen to Bobby vent about it and maybe lift some of those burdens.

>Inigo Myoga HN "Ryu-kishi"
"He's been asking Noah about a sister or someone with a similar mutation, but Noah doesn't have a sister or know anyone with wings. Noah would like to meet this winged girl though, she seemed lovely from what he has told Noah."
Noah is clueless as to why or how Inigo became his friend, not that he minds, he welcomes the company. Inigo's indecent and lecherous behaviour isn't a big problem for Noah, at least since most of it is harmless and hasn't entered complete creep territory (as far as he's heard). Should Inigo ever cross that line though, Noah is ready to give him an earful, but Noah trusts him (and Gigan most of all) to not do that.

>Kyoda Hiro HN "Overdose"
"He is good person, he checked on Noah and Jugo to make sure we were okay when we were unconscious."
Noah doesn't interact much with Hiro, but the brief ones they had have left a positive impression on Noah.

>Atsushi Orochi HN "Hard to Destroy Lizard Hero - Yamata"
"Umm... she is heroic..."
Although Noah knows that she is a good person and their values about heroism are very similar, he is still somewhat apprehensive around her. He doesn't want to admit it, but he can't help but compare her hydra heads to snakes, which he has an instinctual fear of. He does his best not to show it though.

>Nyoro Hoge HN "Maru"
"Hmm... Sorry, Noah is unsure who this is... Ohh, the class rep, Imai told Noah about her... Umm, Noah still doesn't know that much."
Another anomaly to Noah. He would like to get to know her, but her quirk basically prevents him from trying.

>Aiko Ami HN "Rosethorn, The Motivational Hero"
"A hero Noah aspires to be."
Rosethorn is one of the heroes that Noah really looks up to; a hero that encourages others and become a symbol of hope. Her supportive attitude is also a plus on his books. While the way she dealt with those two students during the first test left a bad taste in his mouth, it was not enough to sour her image, since that stricter hand might be needed for the class.


>Some opinions on things
Delinquency: Noah doesn't like to judge people based on their appearance, so looking like a delinquent isn't an issue for him. When it comes to rule-breaking, he understands the difference between what is "lawful" and what is "moral," sometimes they coincide, sometimes they don't, so Noah tries to judge based on his own heart even if it is based on his own biases. It also helps that the class are (mostly) a bunch of softies despite what their appearances suggest.

Training Battle: Noah takes that loss and what Majestic said very seriously. His decision to underestimate his opponents is proof of his lack of diligence, and that lack of diligence lead to one of his teammates being gravely injured while he was giving orders. Although he won't admit it, being on the villain's side does make him upset.
