#A NEW IRYS

Bae couldnt believe it, her eyes full of tears, as she watched the smoking crater, right next to her, Calli was holding onto her cap, just as surprised
Could it be? Were the restless nights and prayers worth it? Was Irys among the mortals once more?
As the smoke cleared, Irys emerged

No

That sadistic glimmer, that smug expression... Both of the girls understood that this wasnt Irys

This was... DemonIrys. AS she emerged, the air swirled, the skies darkned... the power of hell accumulating into her being
And thus she spoke

*''I AM COMPLEEEEEEEETE''*

Bae and Mori could only answer in return

**´´FUUUUUUUUUUUU-UUUUUCK''**

Devil Irys started levitating, as the earth trembled
*YES YOU ARE FUCKED!*
*SHIT OUT OF LUCK!* *NOW IM COMPLETE AND MY CUNT YOU WILL SUCK!*
*THIS WORLD WILL BE MINE! AND YOU ARE FIRST IN LINE*
*YOU BOUGHT ME THE RIG AND NOW YOU SHALL BOTH DIE!*

Mori whistled, and suddenly a skeleton with a spanish guitar and a poncho materialized. He strung the guitar a few times, since neither her or Bae could  play guitar. Bae, not wanting to leave everything to her sister, snapped her fingers, and a bunch of rats came, filling a glass full of tequila Jose Cuervo so the skeleton could play
''WAAAAIT.. WAAAAITT'' sang Mori
''WAAAIT YOU CHILDFUCKEEER''
''WE CHALLENGE YOUU TO A ROCK-OFF!'' Bae nodded alongside her, as the skeleton performed a spanish tune, despite being clearly mexican
''GIVE US ONE CHANCE TO ROCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!'' both of the sisters armonized

Devil Irys screamed in anger, and threw a despair bolt to the skeleton, the boney fan who just happenned to be called Juan Carlos Aguascacas de el santo corazon de Jesus romero Enrique Gomez, instantly vaporized
*FUCK*
She turned around and threw another bolt. This time all of the small rats perished but no one cared since they would have died in like 2 years
*FUCK*
She then turned around, where Towa-sama and Choco, who were dressed as referees, were reading a comically large book titled ''DA RULEZ''. Towa shook her head, while Choco said something alongside the lines of ''There are no rules that say a dog cant play baseball''
*FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!* both of them teleported away before Irys's attack could hit them
*THE DEMON'S CODE PREVENTS MEEEE, FROM DECLINING A ROCK-OFF CHALLENGEEE* she sang, frustration in her voice
*WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS? WHATS THE CAAASHH?*
Mori licked her lips, thinking as she invoked another skeleton. This one was spanish, but he was also a gypsi so he had gold rings, which did help in making another spanish guitar riff
''IF WE WIIIN! YOU MUST TAKE YOUR SOOORRYY ASSS BACK TO HEEELLL''
Bae, who had gone to the nearest pet store, unleashed two rats and a confused Hamster, the three rodents taking the guitar of the first skeleton and playing it too, before she turned around and added
''AND ALSO YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY OUR DEEEBTSS''
Bae flashed her credit card recepit, full of Valorant skins, and Mori flashed a bunch of liquor store receipts

D.Irys chuckled in the sky, before crossing her arms
*AND WHAT IF **I** WIN?*
Mori grabbed her sister, pulled her closer and groped her ass, getting away with sexual harassment thanks to the song
''YOU CANT TAKE BAE BACK TO HELL!'' Bae blinked, confused, while Mori kept groping her
''WHAT!?''
''Trust me Bae, is the only way'' Mori's dead-serious tone clashing with her incessant molesting
''what the fudge are you talking about? Mori just rolled her eyes, taking a underskirt pic of Bae with her phone, before locking eyes with Irys
''TO BE YOUR LITTLEEEEEEEEEE BITCH!'' the last word was followed with a small smack in the rat rear

D.Irys grinned diabolically, her Aura growing stronger and larger
**FINE**
**LET THE ROCK-OFF...BEGIN!** her diabolical laughter was followed with multiple SmugIRys pngs floating, trapping our heroes
D.Irys teleported inside, her smugness blinding everyone
**IM THE DEVIL I LOVE METAL**
She then snapped her fingers and a car appeared, in the driver seat there was The Driver (2011) AKA Ryan Gosling, D.Irys getting into the car, pointed her finger at them
**CHECK THIS DRIFT IS FUCKING TASTY**
As a sick guitar solo played, The Driver (2011) Drove (2011) around a small setpiece, everyone amazed at how good he was at Driving (2011).
The car dissapeared in a puff of smoke, as Irys walked down a stage
**IM THE DEVIL I CAN DO WHAT I WANT**
**WHATEVER I'VE GOT IM GONNA FLAUNT** she then showed off her legs, which made everyone in the circle howl like wolves and the skeleton to tell her something way too sexist in Romani
**THERE'S NEVER BEEN A ROCK-OFF  THAT I'VE EVER LOST!**
She then snapped her fingers, a table full of dildos, lingerie and pictures of criying emojis materialized, Bae just gulped at the sight of it
**I CANT WAIT TO TAKE BAE BACK TO HELL! IM GONNA FILL HER WITH MY HOT DEMON GEL!** Just to make a point out of it, she pressed a bottle of gel with the heel of her high-heels, the hamster saying ''GIWTWM''
**IM GONNA MAKE HER SCREAM LIKE A FILIPINOOO INCEL**
Mori, watching as everything was going south, took a step forward
´´NOOOOOOO'' Irys reeled back in surprise, as her ilusions banished. Mori turned to Bae
''Cmon Bae! Lets bring the thunda!''
But Bae, with her spirit broken, could only respond
''There's just no way we can win.. That was a masterpiece..''
''Listen to me!'' Mori tried to lift her spirits, while Irys readjusted the headband i mean the horns in her head
''She rocks too hard because she's not a mortal hooman''
Mori slapped her, maybe a bit too hard since she could hear a muted ''oww'' before she spoke
''GOD DAMMIT BAE! SHE'S GONNA MAKE YOU HER SEX SLAVE! YOU ARE GONNA GARGLE SODA-FLAVORED MAYONNAISE''
''Nooo''
''Unless we bust a massive monster mama jamm!''
Bae, with a red slap mark across her face, smiled
''Bruh...we've been through so much shit''
Mori smiled back
''Deactivated Antis with my clips!''
They both turned to D.Irys, as the guitar tune intensified
**NOW IT TIME TO BLOW THIS FUCKER DOOOWN!**

The skeleton and the rats started busting it down sexual style (goated with the sauce) as the two girls elevated their idol energy
*Come on, Bae Now it's time to blow doors down''
''I hear you Mori Now it's time to blow doors down''
''Light up the stage 'Cause it's time for a showdown''
''We'll bend you over Then we'll take you to brown town''
''Now we've got to blow this fucker down!''
''She's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down''*
They both started dancing, as Irys took a step back

*''Come on Bae 'Cause it's time to blow doors down!''
''Oooh, we'll piledrive ya It's time for the smackdown!''
''Hey Antichrister..Beelzeboss''
''We know your weakness!''
''Our Rocket Sauce!''*

*''We rock the Casbah And blow your mind''* Bae just nodded,since she was way too zoomer to understand the refence,before singing too
*''We will defeat you For all mankind''
''You hold the scepter We hold the key''
You are the Devil We are C-D!''*

Their bodies emitted light, as they sang
**''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´
''WE ARE C-D´´**

D.Irys, annoyed at the lenght of their segment, stopped them
**YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING LAME! COME ON BAE, YOU ARE COMING WITH MEE!**
Since she was being kind of an asshole, she channeled power into the tip of her finger
**TAKE MY LIGHTINING, FUCKER!** Mori screamed as she dove, triying to protect Bae
**NOOOOOO** However, since this wasnt splatoon, D.Irys missed miserably, hitting the solid gold rings of the skelton, the beam ricochetting back to her, hitting her in the headband
**AH FUCK! MY FUCKING HORNS!** Bae however, since she saw a shot fired and something dropped, inmediatly assumed she was in apex and dove for the item
**OH NO!** Irys screamed, as the rat realized she could conveniently end this
**FROM WHENCE YOU CAME...YOU SHALL REMAIN...UNTIL YOU ARE... COMPLETE AGAIN!** 
Irys, terrified, watched as a rift opened, Ayame and Gura pulling her back to the rest zone, before both gave up because their back and throat hort. However, the damage was done, and Irys could feel her Vocal cords hort
**NOOOOOOOOOOO** She screamed as she was succd by the hole
**FUCK YOU BAE! AND FUCK YOU MORI! IIIILL GET YOU YOU DAMN C-D'SSSSSS** The rift closed, the rats died, the skeleton was assaulting an old woman.
Everything was back to normal
From the supermarket across the street, Irys walked out, a bunch of sodas in a bag
''oh hi guys, you wont believe how many people where in line''
Bae rubbed her eyes
''Why are your clothes different?''
''Oh! I spilled soda on my old clothes and these were in discount''
''Ok but what about your horns?'' Mori added ''They are smaller''
IRys looked at the camera ''Well dont worry, im just as horny as before!'' The laugh track played as the credits rolled
