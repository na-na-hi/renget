>Late Saturday afternoon, you and Conner are sweating your asses off inside of your apartament
>Conner lays on the bed, whilst you sit next to a fan, that doesn't really do anything outside of circulating the hot air in the room
>The AC went out hours ago, and now that the sun is finally starting to set, you find some strenght to get up
>7:26 PM on the clock, the day went by before you two even noticed it
>"We... did absolutely nothing today, huh"- you say while wiping your face in your tee
>Conner, all sweaty slowly lifts his head up
>You see his thousand yard stare, which is set in the direction of the fridge
>That gives you an idea
>"Ice cream?" - Conner's ears suddenly prick up, tired eyes widen
>"Alright, lemme see if there's any left" - you say, as Conner slowly slides off the bed
>After careful inspection, it turns out that there's nothing but a few empty boxes, frozen corndogs and a half finished bag of frozen dumplings
>Conner stumbles into the kitchen looking a little dazed
>"Please tell me we at least got some popsicles or something.." - as he begins to yawn, putting his arms behind his head
>In less than a split-second, you take one of the frozen corn dogs and put it in Conner's maw
>An awkward silence erupts
>Conner sucks on the corn dog for a moment and breaks the silence;
>"That's not what I think it is, right?" - he takes the corn dog out of his maw
>You start to smile seeing Conner's disappointed facial expression
>"If it wasn't for the fact that actually cooled me down, I'd be pretty mad, you know?" - he says, handing back the corn dog
>"Yeah yeah, sorry" - TOO DRUNK TO FINISH THIS, SORRY
