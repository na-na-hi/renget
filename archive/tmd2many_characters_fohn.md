### Fourth Of H░░ Name, of House Esper
![Psychic-Type](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f8/PsychicIC.png/70px-PsychicIC.png)

Meowstic, Fourth Of H░░ Name. This cat comes from a line of Psychic noble bloods who all held some niche share of power in the Ava-Lu Empire. Fourth rarely leaves h░░ quarters or the confines of the city towers; ░'s seldom felt grass beneath h░░ feet or wind on h░░ carefully-groomed fur, though some part of h░░ longs to see how the common mon lives outside the floating capital boundaries. ░ made a vow of secrecy, never to tell anyone of the misfortune the previous ruler, Prince of Ava-Lu, met at sea, believing wholeheartedly that it was a tragic accident, and accepting the Princess as the rightful ruler. The faith ░ has in Ava-Lu leadership is strong, but perhaps ░'s been given a reason to doubt it.

Important Info | Description
---- | ----
Source of Wealth/Standing | The family fortune of House Esper and its previous three generations of Meowstic has come into Fourth's possession, allowing h░░ a life of leisure with little need for physical work. ░ isn't respected for who ░ is, only out of of obligation for *what* ░ is. Fourth works as an archivist, logging everything from the nation's history to their transactions and trade with other nations. 
Family History | As h░░ rather arrogant name would imply, Fourth is the fourth of h░░ name, being the most recent Meowstic of h░░ bloodline. A family history of only four lifetimes may not seem like much, but h░░ predecessors, while not the *most* successful Pokemon in known history, have been present for most of the Ava-Lu Empire's recent rise, each appointed to positions of varying importance. Although they came into fortune through a mix of hard work and luck, and expectations of h░░ remain high, the seeds they've sewn before h░░ have allowed Fourth to be born into greatness, independent of the need to *be* great.
Place of Residence | Fourth Of H░░ Name lives in the safest, strongest walls in the capital, towering high above even the Flying-Types who soar far above the city streets. ░ seldom leaves h░░ quarters in the palace, and has never felt the push ░ yearns for, needed to stray from h░░ secure life as a noblemon.
