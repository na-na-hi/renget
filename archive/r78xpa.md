###-> Cuddling on a Stormy Day <-
***

>It's 2pm in the afternoon
>The weather forecast was meant to be warm, sunny, perfect for a stroll in the park
>But what the fuck is this?
>It's raining heavily, you hear thunder in the distance
>Your park date with Shiorin has effectively been cancelled
>Instead she's on the bed
>Reading her book
>Once she's into her book, she won't stop until
>A little dejected you lay next to her
>But for some reason today's different
>She notices you and a small smile forms on her lips, unnoticed behind her book
>She starts to read to you out loud
>"Traveller, what's wrong? What thoughts have intruded into your head to give you such a sour look?"
>You know this isn't a line in the book she's reading, which means she's doing it again
>She's turning the situation into one giant play, with her the narrator and you the performer or actor
>You respond to her "I was meant to go on a date with my girlfriend in the park but the weather said no"
>She then puts the book down and rests her head on your chest
>"Poor traveler, the weather does not favour you today, but it's alright, for the sun will always shine, even in the dark"
>You're taken aback by her words, but you know she's doing this to cheer you up
>You reach over to rest a hand on her head
>"Ah, traveler, you must not go off script, please only listen to my voice"
>You stop and put your hand back down, she's gotten really into this
>She begins to hum while still resting her head on your chest
>You really want to caress her cheek, run your fingers through her hair, you can also smell her shampoo, it's pleasant
>She finally starts a new prompt
>"After the traveler listened to the bard's song, the traveler found himself in tears"
>Suddenly, inexplicably, you begin to tear up, as if it were a command sent to your brain
>"I'll allow it, you may hold me closely, allow me to be the light for you, as I have always done"
>You start to tear up more and hold her closely
>"Don't you have something to say?"
>You don't have to think, this prompt has come up before so you already know the answer
>"I love you Shiorin"
>"I love you too anon"

### -> An Xmas Eve Date <-

***

>Xmas eve
>Both of you had made plans for tonight to spend together
>It's nearly midnight
>You're walking around town, taking in the sights
>The tree still unlit
>Your phone starts to buzz
>It's from your parents
>They're wishing you a happy xmas, so of course you message them back
>However, that wasn't the only one
>It happens again, and again, and again
>Shiori is slowly losing her patience with you despite apologizing about it
>Finally after the next message
>"Anon, what's more important right now? Our date, or your phone?"
>"Shiori, please it's fami-"
>"And what am I then? You can respond to them later can't you?"
>She storms off, clearly mad
>Your shoulders slump, you fucked up pretty badly there
>You sit on a bench and look up at the sky
>Dark and clouded, snow gently falling
>You think about the things you two have been through this year
>After a while you resolve yourself to at least apologize properly
>You get up and look for her
>You find her by the giant xmas tree
>Suddenly you hear a bell ring, followed by the tree lighting up
>Her face is absolutely beautiful in that moment
>You take off your scarf and approach her while holding it behind your back
>"Hey Shiori?"
>She turns to you, still smiling but with a very slight hint of sadness behind that smile
>You wrap your scarf around her neck and pull her in towards you for a hug
>"I'm sorry, and..I love you"
>She starts to laugh a lot then responds
>"No anon, I'm sorry, I got a bit upset there, but I love you too"
>You share a kiss infront of the xmas tree
>She takes out her camera then gives it to a nearby couple
>She grabs your arm and tells you to make a pose infront of the tree
>She does a very silly pose while you try and do a more serious one
>The couple returns the camera and she giggles
>Once again you think to yourself "She's the most beautiful and treasured person to me"

### ->A Tragic Break-up<-

***

>You've lost count of how many times this has happened
>Another argument, another set
>Yelling at each other back and forth
>She use to think that you were the one that could finally understand her fully
>You tried your hardest, no one can say you didn't
>But it's not enough, you still misunderstand, you still forget sometimes
>She sighs and walks up to you
>"Anon, I'm sorry, I'll..try to change a bit"
>Hearing this hurts
>You don't want her to change for you, this isn't something you signed up for
>You loved Shiori for Shiori, you don't want her to change because of your faults
>But what else can you say? Your relationship is on its last legs
>A week passes, but it starts again
>The next argument
>She tried to talk about her husbandos to you again
>But you were too tired after work to properly listen
>What started it?
>She noticed and asked "Hey, are you listening?"
>In your exhaustion, you didn't respond for a bit
>A mistake for sure
>She apologizes then takes a deep breath and finally exclaims
>"Anon, I'm sorry, this isn't going to work anymore"
>"I can't even be passionate about the things I enjoy around you anymore"
>Suddenly you jolt awake, realizing what it is she just said
>"Wait, wait Shiori you don't mean that right?" You ask in a panic
>She looks at you, with sad and dejected
>"It's been like this for a while now, I wanted a partner that could take me at my best, at my worst, and everything inbetween"
>You've seen that look before
>Although she's sad, you know that her mind's made up, her face gives it away
>You slump on the couch and she pats your head one more time
>"Hey, it's alright, just because we didn't work out, doesn't mean you'll be like this forever."
>She's trying to cheer you up from this, as impossible as it may be
>"You're a strong guy, anon. You'll eventually find someone that's more your speed."
>She reaches over and kisses your forehead then your lips and whispers with a tear running down her cheek
>"I love you, truly, but it's painful living like this, it isn't healthy, so please understand me"
>She finally gets up and starts to pack her things
>You're in a daze, you feel sick, your world is slowly ending
>In your pile of depression you finally get up and go up to her one more time
>"Please. Shiori I'll-"
>She puts her hand infront of your mouth and shakes her head
>"That's enough anon, don't make this anymore painful than it has to be"
>You're stuck there, paralyzed from the fear of losing her, but you can't stop her because deep down you know she's right
>She finally leaves
>She's gone, it's over.

### ->A loss of ambition<-

***

>How many times has it been?
>How many weeks, or months. No, even years? You've lost count
>Another message from Shiori
>"Do your very best today anon, I believe in you!"
>However, you both know by now that she's at her limit
>You used to be an energetic anon with high ambitions
>You used to think the world wasn't enough to contain you
>Shiori was attracted to this ambition of yours
>She wanted to support you all the way and see your vision come to life
>You tried for several years to get closer to your desires.
>You failed
>But Shiori never left your side and continued to encourage you
>It wasn't enough
>Your despair was deeper than her words and actions
>Countless nights of just staring at the ceiling
>Even with her by your side
>Trying her best to comfort you, seeing you unresponsive
>She turns away from you, tearing up a little
>You can hear her, you used to comfort her when she got like this, it used to make your heart ache
>Now your lack of motivation just finds it annoying
>But the muscle memory is still there
>You half heartedly try to comfort her, you try rubbing the back of her head
>She and you both know it's just empty gestures though, but she's desperate and accepts it anyway
>Finally the last straw breaks
>She confronts you about all of this one evening
>She asks you where the old you went
>You get annoyed with all the pressure she keeps putting on you despite wanting the best out of you
>Your argument gets worse and then you deliver an ultimatum
>"If you can't accept me as I am now then just leave."
>She's stunlocked, tears practically forming
>"I'm sorry then anon, I can't do this anymore."
>She starts to pack her bags
>You realize what it is you just said but it's too late to stop it because both of you know deep down that you meant it. You meant every word.

###->The Fantasy Battle<-

***

>It's the final battle
>The world is shrouded in a thick layer of black
>All but this tower
>You and Shiori are side by side
>Against the one that caused this to begin with. Chaos.
>You were originally tasked with a duty to save the world
>You went on an adventure with other people including Shiori
>However, you were betrayed by them all
>All except for her, she stayed true and stayed with you all this time
>A hard battle is fought
>The only sounds that can be heard are the wails of the dead, your weapon against Chaos and Shiori backing you up.
>Finally, you land the killing blow on Chaos.
>But, nothing you expected to happen occurs.
>The darkness isn't being lifted
>Instead, Shiori calls to you in a silent, but desperate whisper
>"Anon?.."
>You turn to her, and then you see it, your despair quickly takes you over
>Shiori is slowly being taken over by the remains of Chaos
>She starts crying in her right eye, the other already overtaken, her right arm still clutching on to a knife
>"Anon..I'm sorry, I guess I'll be betraying you too." She says tearfully, ready to slit her own throat to not let her possession happen
>You walk up to her, all the previous betrayals have broken you, you feel nothing, or so you thought
>Suddenly, tears start streaming down your eyes too
>You resolved yourself to end everyone that came in your way, your former friends, allies, even family if they had been corrupted
>Now the last person that needs to die is right before you
>You hesitate, your tears come down harder
>"Anon, please, hurry..before it's too late." 
>She tries to stab herself in the throat to spare you the pain of doing it yourself
>You catch her arm and then you gently whisper in her ear
>"You were always there with me to the end, I swore I'd kill you or myself if one of us got corrupted..but I can't."
>Her left arm, now fully possessed, starts to strangle you
>You barely manage to utter the next words as you feel life fading from you
>"Please live well Shiori..you were always my guiding light.."
>Then suddenly, it stops
>Her left hand lets go of your neck
>She falls onto the ground, her head resting on your arm
>You call out to her, surprised, shocked, desperate even
>Then you hear the soft sounds of her breathing and her chest slowly rising up and down as if in a comfy slumber
>Your words had helped her regain control
>And then finally, your surroundings start to fade
>Your mission is complete, you did it.

###->Date ending in a rainy day<-

***

>It's a sunny day out, you were preparing for this for at least a week
>You finally had the courage to ask her out for a date
>Your heart was practically still, hoping you wouldn't get turned down
>To your surprise, you didn't. She said "Yes, I'd love to"
>Now in the present day, you're out together, walking in town
>You felt content, holding her hand, her by your side, smiling
>You point out a few places you could go, an arcade, a library, and a small cafe.
>She agrees to it all, and has a story for each place
>Her stories always captivated you, and others around you
>But just for today, those stories would be for you alone
>You're feeling giddy, you can't believe how this happened
>Your day has gone by blissfully and now you're sitting at the cafe with her
>She's sipping on some green tea while you're having a coffee.
>You ask her what kind of books she picked up at the library while you were there with her
>"Oh, just some murder mystery, and some psychological stuff, those always excite me!"
>You smile at her, and she smiles back at you, her smile leaving you feeling entranced.
>As the two of you exit the cafe
>Rain starts to fall down, it's heavy
>Your perfect date was going so well until this point
>Shiori then turns to you and apologize "Ah..anon, I only have a small umbrella, here you can use it."
>She hands you a small umbrella, there's no way both of you could use it
>You return it to her, then you take off your coat and hold it over your head with one hand
>"Huh? Are you sure?" she asks you, concerned about whether or not you'll get sick
>You smile at her and nod, then you take her hand again with your free hand
>She blushes a little bit, but accepts you
>Then the two of you start walking back to her home
>The heavy rain isn't letting up, but it doesn't bother you
>She looks at you a little concerned from time to time, but she still smiles, feeling a little comfortable with you
>The walk is long, a storm has even started, though none of that matters
>She decides to change the mood a little, and tells you a story involving a long storm
>You listen to her, you squeeze her hand when she gets to an interesting part, and she recognizes it and is happy, knowing her story is enough to distract you both from the storm
>You finally arrive at her home, where she leaves the umbrella with you
>"Thank you for today anon, you can use this to get home and you can give it back to me next time!"
>"Next time", the words resonate in your heart and mind, this isn't a one and done deal, there'll be a next time, and that leaves you smiling at her
>She then kisses your cheek softly and says "If you can make the next date just as exciting, then the next kiss will be here"
>She taps your lips, then heads inside
>She waves at you one last time
>And so, your almost perfect date, became perfect, as you now have the next one lined up.

###->Kouhai (and follow-up)<-

***

>You were always decent at everything in classes
>Not enough to call it straight A's, but definitely not enough to get F's either.
>Always in that C to B range
>Shiori comes up to you
>Tests are coming up
>You only know one reason why she's here
>"Senpaaaaaai" she calls to you in a cutesy tone, already you can tell that she wants something from you, but you can't resist the cutesy tone at all
>She knows you can't resist it as well, so she leans in closer to you
>"Senpaaaaai, I suck at geography and we have a test coming up..wanna help me study?"
>You don't even put up a fight, you just agree to it
>You start helping her study, pointing out different places for her in the US, Japan and EU
>She's surprised by all the different places, she tries to say them out loud but they all sound funny and mispronounced
>It doesn't bother you, her cuteness is something else
>She smiles gently at you and whispers to your ear
>"Hey hey senpai, if I don't fail this test because of you, I'll give you a little something!"
>Your heart starts to beat faster, a tinge of red appears on your cheeks
>"Uh..alright, do your best." You barely manage to utter this response, then the time for the tests begin
>After classes that day, you're ready to go home
>Your tests went well, the lecturer marked them all pretty fast
>Shiori runs up to you
>"Senpai senpai look look! I did it! You're so smart!"
>She puts her arms around you and gives you multiple kisses in a row, on your lips, cheeks, just all over your face
>You go red as a tomato instantly
>She then takes out a plastic easter egg, inside of it is some japanese candy, and a couple bugs
>She happily eats the candy and gives you the bugs
>"Hehe, thanks senpai! I'll see you tomorrow!~"
>She runs off gleefully
>You realize; "She's not going to eat dinner is she?" and then you start chasing after her, your moral compass will not let her skip out on a proper dinner.

***

>"Hey, Shiori, remember how I taught you geography?"
>She turns to you, her usual gentle smile plastered on her face
>"Hmhm, does senpai need myyyy help now?"
>Emphasizing the my, she likes the idea that she has some knowledge that you don't
>Her gentle smile turns into a cheeky smirk
>"Alright, senpai, how can I help you today?~"
>You're taken aback, her usual cutesy tone has been replaced by one of utter mischief 
>"Uhh..biology..I need some help with it."
>Her smirk only gets bigger, she pokes at your tummy gently
>"Hmhm, biology, yeah I guess I could help you out, after school right?~"
>Your face goes a deep red, you can't tell if this was just a hidden innuendo or not
>She leans in and whispers into your ear
>"I'll teach you allll about the human body..both male and female, especially female. Just meet me here after class instead of going home..okay?~"
>She drags her hand along your hip as she whispers that
>Your entire body freezes up but your heart's beating way faster than usual and you notice you've probably gotten horny over that display
>After classes are over, you stay back
>Shiori walks in with a lab coat and a mannequin
>"Alright senpai! I got permission to use this! I'mma teach you all about the female body with this!"
>Part of you knew that this is exactly what she meant, a small part of you is disappointed that it didn't lead into something more
>She sees your face and instantly sees everything you felt
>"Hey, I can't give you a reward unless you do well you know! Focus up on this and maybe those little thoughts in your head may not just stay as thoughts!"
>That line instantly snaps you back to reality, you're ready to focus on Shiori's lecture.

###->A cursed kingdom, an insane Princess<-

>The kingdom of Inkwell has never been better.
>The Gods truly bless this continent.
>All of its citizens are lively, happy.
>Their princess, Shiori has led a blessed rule.
>You are her older brother that conceded the throne to her as you felt she could become a wise ruler.
>Instead you lead the knights as their captain.
>The citizens love you almost as much as the princess.
>You are revered everywhere
>The kingdom is truly at peace
>Or so you believe
>It wasn't always like this, many wars were fought to obtain this peace.
>After returning home, with a life threatening injury, your sister Shiori, the princess, worried for your life.
>You awoke one day, to find the remaining Novelknights had succeeded where you hadn't, but that's ok, victory was obtained.
>However this is a lie, a delusion, a false hope
>Shiori had fallen into the abyss when she found out you had returned in that state
>She consulted the forbidden library
>She sought heretical books
>And finally she found it
>She performed hideous dark magic on the kingdom
>In her mind, you mattered more than the kingdom, the citizens? The servants? Let them all be damned.
>The kingdom of Inkwell fell over night, what was left was a land of abominations
>Grotesque eldritch horrors, walked the town's streets
>Your fellow knights? Sacrificed, experimented on, cannibalized in madness and frenzy
>Their life force was gathered up and passed onto you
>The knights you once led into battle and glory, are now horrific monstrosities
>Huge, bulky, sacks of flesh, bound only together by their armor, if one were to take off their chest plate, flesh and bone would splatter out in an instant
>Many tried to stop the princess in the beginning, the maids, the butlers, even some of your fellow knights
>However they were all quickly bound down, an infernal ritual serving them up
>You walk by the town, in your eyes, you see the sun shining bright in the sky, merchants offering their wares
>A lovely lady offering you fresh bread that was baked just moments ago
>However in this very town, not even the moon dares to shine down any more.
>Zombified merchants, clawing at broken down buildings
>The lovely lady offering you fresh bread? An eldritch horror, offering you a lump of flesh from a nearby traveler that had the ill-fate of resting nearby
>So why is it that you see such horrors as beauty?
>Shiori knew
>Shiori knew that you would not approve of her actions
>The kind loving princess you once knew? Fallen into depravity, sacrificing thousands for a single person
>So she cast a spell on you
>A heretical seal placed on your back
>As long as this seal existed on your flesh, you will never break out of your delusion, you will never see the truth.
>But did you even want to? No. You were happy right now.
>You happily consume the "flesh bread" that you were given, in your delusion you were told it was filled with meat, so you didn't question it at all.
>And thus, the kingdom of Inkwell has truly fallen
>The proud, honourable knight captain, older brother to the princess Shiori, is now a knight of death to the outside world
>All who visit Inkwell, trying to liberate it from the horrors that Shiori unleashed? Those adventurers are goblins, orcs, trolls, invaders, scum that would die by your blade.
>Shiori's illusion that she cast just for you is so perfect, so unbreakable.
>Only your death can free you, but you will never die, and you will never leave the Princess alone again.
>The heads of many adventurers, former servants and some knights line throne room
>Heads served on pikes that serve as a reminder.
>If you oppose the princess, death is what awaits.
>However, to you, these heads are just decoration, statues even, the smell of decay and death does not phase the illusion.
>You gently get on your left knee before your sister.
>She stares at you, and with a gentle smile, she greets you. "Welcome home, big brother."
>You gaze at her face, to you, her crown is shining beautifully, her eyes golden with a fiery passion, her smile full of warmth and love
>Her dress a beautiful black and white.
>In reality, there is no warmth in that smile, her eyes had long since faded, their fiery passion replaced with obsession over you.
>Her golden crown, stained crimson, her dress torn slightly, and bloodied
>She gently approaches you and rests her lips on your forehead
>A great honour, though those lips only had the icy cold feeling of death on them.
>Ever since your awakening, Shiori had always been paranoid about you finding out the truth.
So, in her paranoia, she asks you a question, though simple, her voice is tinged with a hint of hesitation, and possibly even fear.
>"Big brother, if I committed a sin, no matter how big or how heavy, would you stay with me to the end?"
>You close your eyes for just a moment, to you this question was just another simple question of a sister that felt a bit lonely.
>"Of course, you are my precious sister, I'll never abandon you."

###->A Never-ending time loop<-

>As you lay on the ground, dying, it speaks to you a warm, disembodied, female voice: "Anon, you have faced severe hardship, you've watched your loved one die in front of you, you sacrificed much to get here, and now you are about to die, regrettably. Announce your wish, and for your bravery, I shall grant it."
>You think that this is just a final delusion before you die, however, you're close to dying so you may as well entertain it.
>"I wish to experience the past once more, so that my decisions can maybe lead to a better outcome."
>The voice is silent, for a while you think your wish was denied, or that you're just experiencing one final hallucination.
>Your eyes start to close, it's heavy, the sounds are slowly drowning out, but then you hear the voice, this time clearly, in your mind.
>"Your wish is more like a curse, but if that is what you wish then so be it. There is no way to undo this once it has begun, other than to resolve the World's wish. That wish however, I cannot say."
>Suddenly, you awaken, standing infront of a reflective window, you see yourself, the people are passing by, as if everything were normal
>You're shocked, you can't believe what's happening. Is it a dream? You could have sworn you died. 
>You fall on your ass, and start crying immediately.
>Someone notices and takes pity on you, helping you up
>That someone was once your loved one, though you hadn't met until today
>That's right, you've returned to the first day you met Shiori
>"H-Hey, are you alright? You just started crying out of no where, are you hurt?!"
>You see her face and begin to cry harder, however you also realize that since today is the first day, the two of you are practically strangers.
>You wipe your tears away and calm yourself, before trying to introduce yourself. You decide to leave the fact that you've regressed out, and just try to play it like normal.
>"I'm Anon, I started crying because.."
>She suddenly puts her finger to your lip and shakes her head.
>"If it's private, you don't have to tell me."
>She was always like this, she always noticed when someone was uncomfortable, and tried her best for them, even a complete stranger.
>You nod your head slowly and decide it's best to follow her lead.
>Time seems to flash by in a blur afterwards
>Shiori turned out to be the princess of Inkwell, and you decided to retrace your steps of the past
>You become her most loyal knight, with memories of your past you manage to prevent key turning points of Inkwell's history. The two of you lived the next years together, even starting a relationship together. Something that was unheard of in Inkwell's entire history.
>The major turning point however, Shiori's assassination, something you've regretted since it first happened, was tomorrow.
>Ten years had passed since your initial meeting, tomorrow, Shiori will die.
>You can't tell her this however, as you can't reveal that you have regressed. Instead you prepare as best you can
>Every window, sealed, the guards on high-alert, you yourself have constantly been following Shiori, now the queen of Inkwell, despite her protests for you to take a rest.
>Your preparations are not enough however, as it happens again.
>You fall to your knees before her dying body. Bleeding out she reaches for your cheek and says in her dying breath: "Anon, I'm sorry..I couldn't bear your chi-"
>Before her final word leaves her lips, her hand falls to the ground, lifelessly.
>In your anger, you manage to kill the assassins before they could escape, however, your blind adrenaline has cost you this time. Poison.
>You fall to the ground, the poison quickly spreading, your organs are failing
>You think to yourself: "What a shitty way to die, it isn't even the same as last time."
>As you close your eyes, the disembodied voice speaks to you once again
>"Welcome, to the 2nd run. Will you make the same choices?"
>The words shock you, and suddenly you open your eyes.
>Standing infront of a reflective window, you see yourself, the people are passing by, as if everything were normal.
>You then realize, the regression was not a one time thing.
>You can do this as many times as you wish.

>You can do this as many times as you wish.
>You once again retrace your steps. You "coincidentally" run into Shiori for the first time
>Everything plays out exactly the same on your first meeting
>From there you follow her, however this time you have a different plan in mind
>The assassination of the future queen, something that had been planned from very early on.
>As you live your third life, you begin to wonder when it all began, this plot to assassinate her.
>Five years pass, and that's when the rumors began
>As you perform your daily duties of patrolling the towns near Inkwell castle, you hear talk of a plot to assassinate the newly crowned Queen
>You decide to hire informants, pay information guilds, track this information, all the way to its source.
>Great misfortune strikes however as you have been caught, and killed right after
>"Welcome, to the 3rd run. Will you make the same choices?"
>Realizing that you will have to relive the next 10 years constantly, you decide to keep a magical journal with you.
>The pages of this journal are never-ending so long as the owner wishes for more pages to write in
>There you record everything, every day, including what went wrong and how you died
>Armed with your own knowledge, you go forward, your body has not lived past the age of 30, however your mind and soul have gone way past human limits.
>Something you don't mind, you just wish to live a life with Shiori.
>"Welcome, to the 53rd run. Will you make the same choices?"
>If not for the voice telling you how many times it's been, you would have lost count of how many times you've died by now.
>Your mental fortitude however has developed to a point where you no longer care, all that matters is Shiori's happy ending, your happy ending
>You write down in your journal "Stray sword shard that slit my throat, don't move forward." 
>This time you're sure, this time will be the run
>You repeat all the steps that led you so far, you've successfully managed to track the assassins, you even disguise yourself as one of them very early on and continued with this knowledge during your 41st run.
>The promised day has come, the plan to assassinate Shiori had begun, however, armed with the knowledge of 53 different regressions, you finally manage to keep the two of you alive.
>Shiori holds your hands gently and the two of you share an intimate passionate kiss
>From there, the story of Inkwell's history was one of peace.
>You are blessed with two children, a son and a daughter.
>The son would grow up to become the strongest swordsman in the land, while the daughter was one of the wisest magicians.
>Both you and Shiori have grown old together, and experienced all of what life had to offer
>The kingdom's peace would truly be eternal as long as your son and daughter did not stray from their paths in life
>And so you lay there with Shiori, you feel as though it is your final day. You gently kiss her forehead and you whisper to her. "We'll be together in the afterlife now."
>Even though she's old now, the two of you grew together, she's still as beautiful to you as she were on the first day you met.
>She gently whispers: "Now, and forever."
>And then you close your eyes, you pass with a smile on your face.
>"Welcome, to the 54th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>Your eyes fly open in shock
>"54th?! What? But I died of old age!" You shout to your own reflection.
>The people around you that passed by and practically ignored your existence in all of the previous runs, are now looking at you as if you were a weirdo.
>You quickly calm yourself, and then think to yourself: "No, something must have happened right before I died, maybe I didn't die of old age."
>You take out your magical journal that had lasted with you all this time, and you write down the events of the final day
>You quickly resolve yourself and decide it's time to try again, this time you will definitely die of old age.
>You reach the final day, but instead of laying in bed with your wife Shiori, you decide to stay in a separate room, locked.
>You leave a note for your wife and two children, telling them not to open the door for two days
>You know that today is the day you will die, and you feel regret for leaving them like this, however you must be sure that you die correctly this time.
>And so you close your eyes, confident that this time, you will die of old age.
>"Welcome, to the 55th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>Again you awaken. Standing infront of a reflective window, you see yourself, the people are passing by, as if everything were normal.
>Your mental fortitude that had been built up from so many regressions is crumbling fast.
>You quickly take a passerby's sword and slit your throat.
>"Welcome to the 56th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>You then realize what the voice meant all the way before the 1st run even began. This is a curse.

>The 56th run has begun, suicide is not an option
>You quickly decide that perhaps drastic measures are needed
>You decide to take a passerby's sword and you start swinging it like a mad man, threatening everyone around you
>You are quickly subdued by someone, but it's not enough, it's not killing you.
>In a blind rage, you decide to start a murder spree
>You kill several innocents, only to freeze up when you see Shiori
>Her face is twisted in anger, her eyes are holding back tears, and there she stabs you
>Your 56th run ends because you became a murderer
>"Welcome, to the 57th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>"Still?" You sigh and think carefully
>"Alright, if dying causes this, then maybe I have to become immortal?"
>Thinking back on your knowledge of history, you recall a necromancer that can raise you as an undead
>You confront the necromancer, begging to be turned to an undead
>You feel the life force draining from you, however you're still standing
>"This is it, this is the answer."
>Suddenly you hear the words:
>"Welcome, to the 58th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>You awaken once more, it seems as soon as half of your body is recognized as dead, you will regress
>The weight of this knowledge shatters your mind, you start experiencing a heart attack
>You fall on your knees, the passerbys try to see if you're ok
>You die once more, however your heart attack hasn't stopped
>"Welcome, to the 59th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>"Welcome, to the 64th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>"Welcome, to the 101st run. Will you make the same choices?"
>You consecutively experience excruciating death until the 101st regression. How you die doesn't matter.
>You are trapped in a curse of your own making
>You spend the next regression entirely changing your methods
>"This time, I will be a villain. Maybe if I die a villain, I can move on."
>You don't see Shiori in your 101st run, instead you hide from her, and continue to live the 101st life.
>You join the assassins, intent on murdering her, this time perhaps you can die if you metaphorically pull the trigger on your loved one yourself
>You die another 30 times before you succeed, and on your 131st run, your sword runs through her chest
>Your eyes are filled with tears, as the girl you once called your wife has been struck down by you.
>Knowing you did it, you ingest poison and collapse next to her
>"Welcome, to the 132nd run. Will you make the same choices?"
>Being a villain isn't enough, your curse isn't undone.
>This time, you change your method again
>You live your life with Shiori up until the day of the assassination and you prevent it
>There, you confess everything, your past regressions, how you knew everything would happen, what you had been through
>At this point, the two of you were lovers, and she shared in your pain
>Together, the two of you thought of new ways, different ways, of how you could perhaps face a true death and move on
>"Welcome, to the 200th run. Will you make the same choices?"
>Nothing worked, everything that you and Shiori came up with had failed, you even involved your children, and could not die.
>Burning from the strongest magician's flames, being impaled by the strongest swordsman, falling from a spire in Inkwell castle, suicide, poison, murder
>Nothing can kill you, you are truly an immortal, but in a different sense.
>You have been truly cursed, what you once thought was an angel, taking pity on you and giving you another chance, was your mistake
>It was the devil, tempting you into taking a path that you can never finish, a path that will always restart you.

###->Yandere Imouto Shiori<-

>"Shiori! Your older brother's so cool! Can you introduce me to him? I think..I have a crush on him"
>Shiori looks at her friend blankly, however behind that blank look lies a hidden malice, pure jealousy and anger, hidden behind an elaborate poker face
>"Sorry, my brother..isn't really the best kind of person to be around..he's uhhh not very loyal, if you get what I mean."
>Shiori is lying through her teeth, she just doesn't want you to be taken by anyone else
>Her friend looks down, somewhat appalled by what she heard
>"Oh, I see, he looked so nice, but I guess he's an asshole in the end huh? Can't have em all I guess."
>With that, Shiori's friend walks away, and you can almost hear a sigh of relief coming from her
>But her anger has yet to subside
>Shiori opens her friends locker without her knowing, without anyone else around
>She takes her friends shoes and slashes them with her scissors, closing the locker soon after and remarking: "We can no longer be friends, sorry bitch but I have to protect my property."
>As the school day ended, you walked outside of Shiori's classroom, waiting for her
>A girl walks up to you and starts chatting with you while you wait, it's a rather mundane chat though
>Shiori walks out and sees you and her talking, you wave to her and the girl notices her also, then follows suit and waves at her too
>Shiori's eyes grow dull, however she masks it well and simply waves back with a forced smile
>The girl simply walks off afterwards, and Shiori rushes next to you
>"Onii-san, who was that?" she asks, calmly
>However, this is simply the calm before the storm, you know well what exactly this means and you scramble to find a fitting answer
>"I uhh, don't know, she just wanted to know where the library was."
>Shiori quickly looks relieved then says to you "Ah, I gotta grab something real quick, I'll meet you outside ok?"
>You simply close your eyes, thinking to yourself "Poor girl." then you agree and head outside
>Shiori quickly catches up to the girl from before and then she whispers something entirely incomprehensible to anyone else
>The girl holds her mouth in fear and tears start to well up in her eyes while Shiori walks away, humming
>You see her humming, and then you ask her: "You're my imouto, is that really necessary? Are you that jealous?"
>She looks at you with a face of shock, as if you had just exposed her darkest secrets, then she quickly laughs in a somewhat embarrassed tone: "Hahaha..you're so funny onii-san, I would never."
>You simply let it go and continue to walk home with her
>On the walk home she sees some girls staring at you, feeling self-conscious, she clings to your arm as if you were a couple
>You know full well what would happen to you if you objected to this right now, so you simply let it happen
>Your daily life is slowly turning into a weird kind of hell, people don't want to be around you, but at the same time, you feel as if you're slowly getting closer with your little sister
>And Shiori wouldn't have it any other way
>Finally the two of you arrive home, but as you do, a text message appears on your phone
>Shiori stares at you, and your phone, with eyes that could kill someone
>You quickly show her the phone: "It's just mom! It's fine!"
>Her eyes however don't change, she simply says under her breath: "Mom huh? She too.."
>Before she could complete that sentence, she simply smiles at you and says: "Oh, you better answer our dearest mother quickly!"
>That smile hides all of her sinister intentions, could she really be jealous of your mother right now? No, it can't be.
>Shiori hums playfully, clinging to your arm, as she watches you text your mother back
>Your mom responds again, this time, an "I love you son." is attached to the end of the message
>Shiori's hold on your arm gets tighter, a lot tighter.
>She simply smiles and says "You don't have to say it back~"

>Shiori woke up in the middle of the night
>Her eyes were full of tears
>Her breathing was uneven, she was panting heavily
>"that filthy bitch.." she exclaimed under her breath 
>The next day at school
>In a place where no one was around to witness 
>A small fire was being lit
>And into the fire they fell 
>Text books, notebooks, and even what looked to be some PE clothes
>After all of that burned, she tossed a couple photos in there too
>Photos of Shiori and a friend of hers
>She lightly sings a small tune "fire..fire..light the fire.."
>If anyone else saw this, they would see a rather petite girl, giggling over a fire while tossing more items into it.
>As the belongings of her friend burned down, she puts out the fire and walks away
>No one ever became aware of where her friends items went
>Her friend feared for her own safety and stopped coming to school since that day for a month.

###->School Trip with Shiori as her Professor<-

>It's time for a school trip
>Your students are somewhat troublesome
>You sigh heavily thinking to yourself "Man, I should probably retire soon."
>You arrive an hour ahead of time
>Minutes after you arrive, Shiori arrives also
>She has a summer hat and a backpack with her
>The hour passes by quickly, no one else shows up
>It seems this trip will only be you and Shiori
>Thankfully, Shiori is your least troublesome student
>You sigh outloud and under your breath you say: "Damn troublemakers, not even showing up."
>Shiori notices your sigh and pats your back
>"There there Sensei! It will still be fun right?"
>Her warm smile is slowly making you feel better already
>"Yeah..at least I have one student interested." you respond, in a somewhat sarcastic tone
>The school bus arrives. Both of you get on the bus.
>You sit towards the front, Shiori sits next to you.
>She rests her head on your shoulder and says "I hope you don't mind if I take a nap, sensei."
>Since it's just the two of you, you don't particularly mind, if the other students were around they would probably say something
>The trip is somewhat long, Shiori is napping on your shoulder, you don't feel this is appropriate, but just for today, you don't mind.
>After a couple hours, you finally arrive, a camp site that has recently had some snow fall, you notice that the pond is frozen over with ice
>You nudge Shiori awake gently, she mumbles sleepily "Mmm..Sensei? W-why are you in my room Sensei?~"
>Her sleepy voice also carries a slight hint of a flirtatious attitude behind it
>You gently tap her forehead, telling her with an amused yet sarcastic tone: "Stop dreaming little princess, we're at the camp site."
>Shiori's eyes snap open, a slight blush on her face and she looks out the bus window
>"Ohhh, there's snow!" She exclaimed excitedly.
>The two of you get off the bus, she clings to your hand as she gets off the bus, the height a bit high for her
>For some reason, this starts to feel more like a date than a school trip, however she's just your student, perhaps in 5 years or so.
>You shake your head and get rid of that thought quickly.
>Shiori runs over to the camp site's cabin, you follow behind her.
>The entire camp site had been reserved by the school, but since it's just the two of you, it may as well be a private date site, another thought you quickly chase away
>Shiori looks through and finds some ice skates
>"You know sensei, I never learnt how to ice skate, can you teach me?"
>You look at your phone, checking the weather
>Today's your only chance for this, tomorrow the ice will most likely melt
>You consent and she giggles happily at your agreement
>The two of you go outside and put on the skates, it's been a while for you but you're able to keep balance
>Shiori however is struggling a little, she falls on you almost but you catch her and manage to hold her still
>Shiori then takes both of your hands in hers, your fingers interlocking, not a hint of shame on her face or in her actions
>However for you, these actions surprise you, but you don't really complain. It's just a teacher that's helping his student to learn, nothing else.
>The two of you start skating together over the frozen pond, the whole time your hands are together, fingers interlocked, her smile is wide and warm.
>"Senseiiii, this is so nice! You're always so nice to me!"
>Your heart is beating faster, you almost lose your balance from her comment, but you manage to stop yourself and continue skating with her, as if nothing happened.
>The two of you continue skating for a while longer until you notice the sun is starting to set
>The two of you then go back to the cabin, there you notice there's a perfect spot to watch the sun set, Shiori also notices it and asks: "Sensei, do you wanna sit there and watch the sunset with me?"
>The idea definitely crossed your mind, however you try to play it cool: "Sure, I guess we can."
>The two of you sit and watch the sunset together, something you never thought you would do with your student, but you aren't really complaining. She's the only student you like afterall.
>Once the sun had fully set, you both go inside, you, there Shiori says: "Hey sensei, I bet you can't surprise me!"
>"Where did this come from?" You ask her.
>She looks at you with a playful smile then responds back: "You surprised me twice today unintentionally, first on the bus, and then the second with your ice skating, I bet you can't do it a third time on purpose."
>You think for a little, and then you put your hand against a wall, with Shiori between the wall and your body
>You then look down on her a little and whisper: "Is this enough of a surprise?"
>She looks up at you, her face flushed red, then she suddenly does something that surprises you back, she smooches your hand
>"Hehe, just like my dream earlier, sensei~"
>With that she wanders off, leaving you somewhat surprised. You were meant to surprise her, but she got you instead.

###->Costume Shopping with Shiori for Halloween<-

>You and Shiori are setting up for Halloween
>Both of you enter the costume store
>It's a bit too late for online shopping, delivery will only arrive after Halloween is over
>Surprisingly, the costumes are well made in this store, a local tailor perhaps?
>There are entire sections for men and women, you're tempted to go look for something you'd wear however
>Shiori clings lightly to your arm and playfully says: "Hey, help me pick out something Anon!"
>You can't help it when she talks like that, you can't resist, she's too cute and tempting.
>You relent to her cute pleading, not like you had any real choice and start browsing different costumes with her
>You manage to convince yourself that you'll pick out something a little cute for her, while also a bit sexy so you get some good eye candy
>Eventually the two of you stumble upon a Witch outfit
>Shiori is engrossed in it for some reason
>It's just a witch outfit, her usual goth outfit is pretty close, just add a hat
>But for some reason, Shiori just stares at it, like she had been charmed by it
>You on the other hand, spot out a rather lewd cow-print bikini, with its own bell collar and cow ears
>You decide to point it out to her as a joke, when she takes her eyes off the witch outfit and looks at your choice, she turns back to you
>"Anon, are you really going to make me wear this? What if others see me? Are you prepared to wear this lewd Dimitri outfit I saw in exchange?"
>She shows you her phone
>You're pretty sure this was used in a porno cosplay
>You quickly give up the idea of the cowkini, a little disappointing but you'd rather not subject yourself to porno Dimitri cosplay, and you didn't really think of the idea of others seeing her in it also. Shiori in a cowkini is an idea you'd rather have all to yourself if possible
>Back to the Witch outfit, you see there are fitting rooms and point it out to her, she excitedly takes a witch outfit that fits her size then runs to the change rooms to try it on
>She comes back to show you, the hat is quite big for her but it somehow accentuates her cuteness, the skirt is a little short, not enough to reveal anything from a distance, but definitely good for someone like you who would be up close
>The off-shoulder sleeves remind you a bit of her current goth outfit, but for some reason it looks better
>You're convinced this witch outfit was made purely for Shiori, to the point you're almost speechless
>Shiori notices your face, and a smile is formed from her lips curving up
>"Hehe, it's that good huh? Alright it's settled! Time to get you something though!"
>She quickly heads back to the change rooms, taking off the costume and nicely folding it back into its hangers, she then carries it with her.
>Now it's your turn, you head to the men's costumes section.
>Many costumes catch your eye, however one in particular stands out to you
>It's a rather simple aristocratic-like outfit, with a cloak that comes with it.
>"Oooo a vampire outfit!" She exclaims to you.
>"But hmm, would Anon like being a vampire?"
>She looks at you again, eyeing your figure while thinking hard.
>It seems you're going to be spending a while here as both of you seem unsure of what you'd wear.

###->Movie 'date' with Shiori as her Professor<-

>Shiori and you, her professor, had set up plans to see a movie together
>It was supposed to be an educational trip
>So why are you dressed so nicely? You aren't expecting anything of it are you?
>You look at the time and notice you're actually running late
>You paid too much attention to your appearance
>Shiori was there, in her usual gothic attire and jacket
>"Professor! I thought you were standing me up! You're late!"
>She pouts at you, but you're used to her antics by now, you know she's not being serious.
>You apologize profusely to her anyway, knowing that's what she wants from you
>She smiles cheekily then tugs onto your arm.
>"I'll forgive you this one time professor Anon, let's head inside!"
>Inside the movie theatre, it seems it's only you and her for this, no one else is coming by
>"A private date?" You thought to yourself, shaking the idea out of your head, it's not appropriate for thoughts like that, she's still your student
>"Maybe in a few years" you think to yourself, restraining yourself from further indecent thoughts.
>But Shiori doesn't make it easy for you
>"Hey professor, it's pretty warm in here huh?"
>Before you get the chance to respond, she takes off her jacket in front of you, you see her bare shoulders now
>You blush a little, but she isn't giving you a moment to collect your thoughts
>She instantly sits on your lap after her jacket is off, then she casually tosses it on the seat she used to occupy
>"Professor, since it's just the two of us, lemme set on your lap, it'll be fine right?"
>This girl is truly a handful right now, you can't do anything but allow it to happen
>It's so tempting, you don't even know where to rest your hands
>She notices this and playfully inches closer towards you, taking your right hand and placing it on her leg, your left hand placed just on her waist
>You try to move your right hand just a little but she quickly notices and her hand snaps onto yours
>"You can't do that professor, not for a few more years anyway."
>Both of you are aware of this, but she's still teasing you anyway, she's in a position to be able to
>She shifts her body towards yours, her bottom dangerously close to your crotch
>You attempt to move but you're already as far back on your seat as you could be
>She slowly moves along your leg, back and forth, as if trying to stimulate you a little, however you both know that if you inch closer towards her, she'll get off of you, you also know that if you initiate anything, she'll leave
>You sigh a little, realizing the frustrating situation isn't going to get any better, and you resign yourself to your fate of being teased.
>Throughout the movie, Shiori is rather engrossed in the film, at some point there's even a kissing scene
>For that scene, she gets close to your ears and a soft "mwah" comes out of her lips, you know that kiss was intended for you, but she plays it off saying "Hehe that was just for the film professor."
>Once the movie ends, she gently gets off of your lap and puts her jacket back on
>"Thanks for watching with me Professor, oh, how about this?"
>She hugs you tightly, nuzzling her head against your chest
>You feel warmth from her, and you put your arms around her for a little
>She lets go after a little while then whispers: "In a few years professor, maybe that mwah will be for you?"
>Before you can respond, she walks off, waving cheekily
>You turn around and prepare to head home then she yells
>"Oh! Professor! Tomorrow you're helping me disect frogs!"
>A smile appears on your face, "Guess tomorrow will be eventful as well huh?" you muse to yourself.

###->Pampering Shiori because she's sad<-

>Shiori is in the living room, reading a book on the couch.
>You're next to her, on your laptop, just watching anime to pass the time.
>Thankfully, it's not distracting Shiori, she doesn't mind and likes your company, even if neither of you are directly speaking to each other.
>About an hour passes with the two of you just sitting next to each other, though now Shiori is lazily sitting.
>You suddenly hear it, some light sniffling
>As the episode of your anime ends, you reach over to her, gently rubbing her head.
>She feels a little comforted, but then tears start to run down her cheeks
>Afterwards, something you didn't expect happens.
>She gets up and moves your laptop to the side, then she sits on your lap, facing you.
>You can see her eyes are tearing up pretty badly, you can audibly hear her sniffling, her usual gentle, sometimes cheeky smile, is now a sad frown
>She rests her head on your chest, you can feel the wetness of her tears against your shirt and chest
>The smell of her shampoo is has a citrusy-like smell, it's easy to identify with how close she is to you.
>She finally speaks, in a soft, whimper-like tone: "Onii-san, you won't ever abandon me right?"
>You're confused, why did this suddenly come up? So you ask her: "What are you talking about?"
>She sniffles a little and responds: "The book I was reading..the male lead found his true love, and then..he abandoned his family and friends after. When they reunited..he even killed them for her."
>Shiori was always a little sensitive to things she read, she could easily relate to characters, she could understand their feelings. 
>She could never side with bad characters, and she always felt bad when she had to read.
>Because of this, you know that Shiori is feeling extra sad right now
>"Don't worry, even if I find someone, I'll never abandon you."
>Your voice is gentle, calming, soothing, enough for Shiori to stop sobbing.
>Shiori doesn't lift her head though.
>You begin to wonder if she's just comfy on your chest right now, so you gently rub the back of her head while reassuring her in the same gentle, calming and soothing tone: "There there."
>Eventually she begins to nuzzle her head against your chest, while her arms gently wrap around your back, holding onto you tightly.
>You rest one hand on her back, you gently run your fingers through her hair with your other hand.
>She makes light purring noises, like a cat that's feeling comforted by your touch.
>Shiori seems to have calmed down after a while.
>When she finally lifts her head, her face is a little bit of a mess, but you don't particularly mind, it's natural for a girl who just cried.
>She gently presses her lips to your cheek, and a soft 'mwah' comes out, though it isn't the usual playful kiss you're used to, but more of a sad, somber one.
>She finally says: "If you break your promise, I'll hate you forever." she then gets off your lap and goes to the bathroom to wash her face properly.
>You sigh and look up at the ceiling. 
>Sad Shiori isn't something you see everyday, but it's something you hope you never have to see often.

***

###->Clubroom with Shiori<-

>You're sitting at the club room alone
>Your kouhai asked you to keep her company today.
>It's either you accept or she stays in the club room alone by herself
>A young girl by herself with no one else around? A small part of you is concerned.
>Minutes later, Shiori barges into the room with a bag
>"Ah! Senpai you're already here! Sorry I'm a bit late!"
>She seems to be full of energy today, different from yesterday when she was sad.
>You give her a playful sarcastic greeting: "Yo, what took you so long?"
>She just smiles cheekily and says: "Aw, were you worried about me?"
>She sits next to you and empties out her bag, in it are a bunch of flat surfaced rocks and some acrylic paint pens.
>"Thanks for coming to keep me company senpai, I'm sorry if it's a bit boring."
>You don't really seem to mind, you kind of think of it as a date
>You sit back and watch her
>She starts talking about a text adventure that the two of you played
>When you tell her about the character you were interested in, she responds with "Ehhh, you went after her? Really? Damn I just ignored her honestly. Maybe two runs at most I went with her?" 
>She then starts describing the character she went with.
>You can see the excitement in her face, and hear it in her voice, when talking about that character
>It's actually pretty endearing
>When you mention another possible ending, she reacts in surprise: "HUH?! That's possible?!" 
>Her reactions amuse you a little, though you can't tell if you're spoiling it for her, or if she's just done with the game because she got with her preferred character
>While the talks are going, she's started drawing on the rocks. 
>You look over to see what she's drawing, it seems to be the faces of her friends.
>The way she draws surprises you a little, it looks better than what you expected.
>"Wow, you can draw huh? Always thought of you as just a simple bookworm."
>She cheekily replies: "Pfft, I can do better than stick figures senpai, though I did use to draw stick figures."
>As she says that, one of her pens starts leaking a little, getting ink all over her gloves
>"Ahhh darn it! I knew this would happen."
>She pouts a little and turns to you
>You can't help but smile and gently pat her head, her hair feels softer than usual, a new brand of shampoo and conditioner perhaps?
>After patting her head, she rests her head against your shoulder while still drawing on the rocks.
>"Thanks for being here today senpai, I'm not sure what I'd do if I had to be by myself, maybe I'd just do this at home."
>You reassure her, telling her that you can always make time for her.
>Sadly, today has to be cut short, one of her senpai's is having a special event and she wants to attend, she invites you to attend also.
>Before the two of you exit the room, she whispers
>"Hey senpai, I bet you can't say my favourite character's name."
>You look at her face, it's a wide grin, she's confident you won't do it.
>You've known her for long enough, you know this is just another tease.
>You sigh and say it, whispering his name into her ear: "Dimitri"
>She giggles then kisses both of your cheeks, and then twice on your lips
>"Pfft, I would have given you maybe one kiss, if you didn't say anything. I know I bother you about him a lot, but thanks for letting me be well, me, and putting up with my crap. No one else would if not for you."
>With that the two of you walk out of the club room, making sure you close the door behind you. 
>Then the two of you head to the event hall where her senpai is having her big event.

###->Shiori the Jailer<-

>Shiori is looking at you dead in the eyes
>A gentle smile appears on her face
>She's put on a police officer's hat, and has handcuffs twirling in her finger.
>"Anon, I know you did it."
>You vehemently deny that you did anything, in fact, you're not even sure what you did, or why you're here.
>Your last recalled memory was you falling asleep on the couch, so why are you tied to a chair now? Why is Shiori pretending to be a jailer?
>She shakes her head in disapproval then slams the table with both hands.
>"Anon, I know you were peeking on me in the shower, I know you stole my panties, I know you've been doing..things..to them."
>The entire accusation shocks you, panty theft? Really? 
>You deny it again, saying that you were simply asleep the whole time.
>She sighs a little, then she moves the table away and sits on your lap
>"Anon, it's ok, I'm not mad about it, you just have to tell me~"
>Her words are laced in a tone of sweet allure, she's trying to get you to confess to something you didn't do.
>She gently runs her right hand along your waist, her left hand rests on your shoulder, then she rests her head on your chest, as if trying to detect your heart beat.
>Naturally, her movements cause your heart to beat faster.
>"Oh my anon, you're lying right now when you say you didn't do it. Look, your heart's beating so fast!"
>She squeezes your waist, teasing you further, your heart can't calm down anymore, she's too close to you, and you're all tied up.
>She breathes gently onto your chest, then your neck.
>"There's still time Anon, you can tell me, you can just say "Yes I did it." and it'll stop."
>You still manage to deny the false charges, though you're clearly struggling. Your conscience is telling you not to give in, but your body is saying a different thing.
>Shiori leans forward, now pressing her crotch against your leg, a soft noise, that almost sounds like a moan, escapes her lips.
>"Anon, what do you think will happen if you say you did it? Do you think I'll leave you tied up here?"
>You look at her, she's managed to get your attention slightly.
>"Nono Anon, I won't leave you there, in fact, I might even reward you for your honesty."
>She leans in afterwards, gently pressing her lips against your neck, then opening her mouth slightly and pressing her teeth on your neck.
>You can feel her wet saliva against your neck, her hot breath makes it feel warm too, along with the sharpness of her teeth, slowly sinking in, marking you.
>Your will is crumbling fast, you can't take much more teasing.
>Finally you give in.
>"Ok Shiori, I did it..I peeked on you in the shower..I stole your underwear too..I used it to jerk off.."
>She pulls her head back, leaving obvious teeth marks on your neck, and with a satisfied smile she says: "Good boy."
>She then unties you, and lifts her skirt slightly, revealing that she hasn't been wearing panties this whole time, because you allegedly stole them. A crime that you had no part in, but you just confessed to.
>The night just got a lot more intense, your heart's racing even harder than before now.
>"So, what will you do now, mister criminal?" She whispers into your ear, cheekily, knowing what will likely happen next.

###->Your personal cheerleader Shiori<-

>You're working the hours away, it's tiring, it's draining, but it's gotta be done.
>You take your phone out and message Shiori, apologizing to her because of plans the two of you had made, which now need to be put on hold or cancelled.
>"Sorry Shiori, I said I'd be home early for you tonight, but I gotta get this done."
>After sending the message, you slump in your chair, sighing heavily, before resolving yourself to continue. The longer you take, the more you feel as if you're disappointing Shiori
>The day finally ends, you check your watch, somewhat upset with yourself that it's already 8pm.
>You get up and start to walk out of the office building, as you exit, a message appears on your phone
>It's from Shiori. Dread creeps into your mind, pessimistic thoughts start forming in your head before you even open the message. "God, she's mad at me isn't she?"
>You close your eyes, take a deep breath in, then open it.
>To your surprise, she doesn't appear to be mad, all the message says is: "Don't buy dinner tonight if you'll be late, I got something for you."
>An awkward smile creeps onto your face, followed by even more sighing. It seems your pessimism isn't going away tonight, instead your thoughts pivot from: "She's mad at me." to "What did I do to deserve her?"
>Your walk home isn't doing you any favours, it's cold out, you forgot your coat, the street lights are dim, there are dogs howling throughout the neighbourhood which only serve to annoy you.
>You arrive home, your eyelids are getting heavy.
>You then make a decent effort: "Shiori? I'm home."
>No response
>Your pessimism from earlier has returned: "Yep, she's definitely mad."
>You walk into the kitchen and see a meal prepared for you on the dining table and a note.
>The note reads: "Anon, I know you've been working hard, here's your meal, made with lots of love, Shiori."
>You sit down, it's pasta salad
>You grab a fork, stabbing into the lettuce, chicken and a cherry tomato, and put it into your mouth
>Although tired, you're able to enjoy the taste, the mix of onions sauce, vinegar, and sesame oil that was used as a dressing compliments it well, you can taste the umami and the tanginess of the vinegar.
>A smile appears on your face, it was clearly made with a lot of effort.
>You continue to eat the meal in silence.
>Once the meal is finished, you stand up from your seat, and a surprise manages to get you
>Shiori has put her arms around you from behind, was she waiting for this moment?
>"Did you like your meal?" she asked, her tone somewhat of a whisper.
>You gently rest your hands over hers: "Yeah, I did." you respond.
>She then starts walking backwards, with her arms around you. You're tired so you let yourself be dragged along.
>She drags you into the living room, then makes you turn around.
>As you turn around, you notice what Shiori is wearing instantly, before you could comment on it, she pushes you onto the couch.
>A cheer leader's outfit, the top leaves her tummy exposed, the skirt is kind of short, but what you notice isn't so much the outfit she's in, but moreso her face.
>Smug, confident, a smirk that screams: "Tonight will be fun."
>She sits on your lap, putting her arms over your shoulders and then she leans in and whispers in a playful, yet somewhat soothing tone
>"Anon, you've been working really hard for some time now, you've been coming home and apologizing a lot, today you even look depressed, did you think I wouldn't notice?"
>She hits every nail on the head, you can't even deny it so instead you do the same thing, you apologize, or at least you try to.
>Before you could even say sorry, she puts a finger to your lip
>Instead, she starts cheering for you, she has no pompoms with her, but her cheering song is one of her many, many improvised songs
>The tune is slightly off, the words don't all make sense, perhaps it's because of the time, but you can tell she's put effort into this, for your sake
>You start to laugh a little, followed by a smile
>Your weariness from before is starting to fade
>She notices this and returns you a smile, then that smile turns into another smirk, one would even describe it as 'mischievous'
>"Well anon, you owe me now for this, I had to shop online for this outfit and I saved it for times like this."
>She gets off your lap, then turns around, and sits on your lap again, this time her back is pressed against your chest, her butt is pressed against your crotch fully.
>You begin to blush, and your body begins to react as it typically would
>"Show me your gratitude, anon~"

###->Shiori doesn't want to see the doctor<-

>You're tired of it
>You look at Shiori, her health has constantly been declining
>Her cough has not gone away at all
>She insists she's fine, it's just a dry cough, surely she doesn't need to go, right?
>Wrong.
>It's been 2 months now and you're tired of it.
>She keeps giving you excuses such as: "I'll do it tomorrow onii-san!" or "Ooops, I forgot, but I'm busy today!"
>You pick up the phone and you start scheduling the appointment: "Hi, I'd like to book an appointment for my little sister."
>She notices you on the phone, and when the words 'appointment' are heard, she slowly dips her head behind the counter, as if hiding from you.
>You notice her black and white hair, sinking behind the counter and you sigh. Once the phone call is finished, and the appointment is booked, you go around the counter and see her there
>She has her head in her hands, as if terrified. You gently squat down and reach your hand out.
>She shakes her head a little and finally confesses to you: "Onii-san, I don't wanna go to the doctor..I'm s-scared of them."
>You kind of knew it in the back of your mind.
>She would always hesitate whenever the doctor was brought up, so it dawned on you eventually.
>Regardless, you sigh gently, then you take her hand. Your grip is firm, and your face had a gentle smile, you were trying to reassure her, and it was slowly working.
>Eventually she steps out of her little hiding place, hands held together.
>In a whispery voice, tone filled with anxiety, and also a bit of longing, she asks you: "Will onii-san be with me the entire way through?"
>You nod your head in response, and squeeze her hand gently. She takes it as a sign of confirmation
>The day of the appointment arrives and the two of you head out. 
>Before heading out, she tried to get out of it again, insisting that she's fine, only to cough in front of you not even 2 minutes later.
>You sigh and promise her the two of you can get some donuts after the appointment. Something she hesitantly agrees to.
>The appointment itself doesn't take long, you sit in the doctor's office with her, holding her hand the entire time. The doctor herself remarks how close the two of you are.
>You only smile at the remark, but Shiori is nervous, very nervous.
>Despite the nervousness, Shiori makes it through the check-up without issues, she's been neglecting her health, and the doctor recommended some medicine, as well as a light exercise routine, to bring her health back up.
>As you exit the doctor's office and head to the car, Shiori clings to your hand, there she asks, a little nervously: "Did I do good onii-san?"
>You smile at her: "Yeah, you did."
>Her face finally shows a smile since the appointment had been scheduled, then she cheekily asks: "Can I have two donuts then?"
>Seems her typical, playful and cheeky self is back.

###->Untitled NSFW!<-

>It's been a while since the two of you met, the situation between the two of you took a step you never thought it would
>A chance encounter as you were taking exercising in the early morning, trying to get your steppies in.
>A fog had rolled in, but you knew the path you usually take, so it isn't that bad for you
>However, what was more interesting than just the mundane fog, was your chance encounter with her
>As you lay your eyes on her, the fog began to clear up and you could see her more clearly.
>She had been going for a light stroll in the fog, a black parasol in hand, a blood bag in hand with a straw.
>She looked like she came straight out of a fairy tale, or film
>WIth a smile she gracefully approached you, your gaze falls on her, and you're unable to look away.
>"My, are you unable to avert your gaze? Am I that attractive?"
>She was standing right before you, you've never been in a situation like this before, your blood is slowly running cold, your body temperature is getting lower, you can't move.
>"Why don't you become my butler? I'm in need of one.
>Suddenly, you feel faint, your eyes are heavy and you fall forward.
>She smiles gently and catches your head, the last words you hear before you drift into sleep are: "There there, you'll like it with me."
>Now, in the present, you're in a rather expensive suit. You have white cloth gloves, a fancy tie and expensive dress shoes for men. This attire probably cost more than your monthly wage.
>You hear the sound of a bell ringing throughout the house
>This was your sign that she is calling for you.
>At first you were always late to her calls, and she would punish you in various ways, from a simple slap to the cheek, to making you get on all fours and using you as a foot rest, to putting a leash on you and pulling you around like a pet dog.
>You shake the thoughts away in your head, you've gotten better at your response times
>The sounds of the bell are coming from her room
>You knock on the door and announce your presence: "Did you call for me, Madam?"
>"Yes yes, enter."
>You hear the door lock click, it's open
>You enter her room, casually saying "Excuse me" as you enter.
>There you see her, dressed in nothing but her undergarments, her slender figure in full view.
>Your body has an immediate reaction and you feel a boner coming on.
>"Oh? Are you that happy to see me? How cute."
>You feel a blush across your face, and you try to turn away but she quickly stops you from turning away
>"How does it fit me? Does it look good? Does it get your monkey brain going?"
>She smiles mischievously as she asks, then she approaches you and gently takes off your butler coat.
>"It's..very sexy, Madam." You say it without hesitating, something she's taught you to do since your time with her.
>She smiles a little more as she directs you to the edge of her bed and makes you sit down. However, she whispers to your ear under her breath: "Surely you can answer better than that."
>There she gets behind you and covers your eyes with her right hand.
>This isn't exactly new to you, she's been doing this sort of thing every now and then when she's in need of a distraction, or if she's hungry
>Her left hand gently caresses the back of your neck, then she slides across and starts unbuttoning your shirt from the top going down
>"You were such a scared little boy the first time I did this, you were begging me not to hurt you. Now look at you, my handsome butler is all stiff and frigid, giving me the blandest compliments, despite me dressing up for you."
>You don't know what to say, it's true that your compliments towards her underwear were kind of bland, so you take a deep breath and reply again
>"It looks good on you, the colours accentuate your pristine skin better, your figure shows really well through it and.."
>She interrupts the rest of your sentence by removing your shirt, now fully unbuttoned, and biting down into the back of your neck.
>The pain is sharp, you feel the back of your neck bleeding instantly, a warm, wet liquid oozing down
>Her breasts are pressed against your back, her lips to the back of your neck, there she begins to drink from your neck
>Her left hand that was once on your chest is now on your stomach, then it gets lower, towards your left thigh.
>You feel the tip of her tongue, dragging across the nape of your neck, lapping up the blood that's dripping down.
>Her right hand is obscuring your vision, making you rely less on your sight, and more on your tactile senses.
>"Shiori I.." you utter under your breath.
>She moves her head, then bites down into your shoulder next.
>"Rude butler, you're not allowed to refer to me by my first name yet."

>Shiori is wearing rather revealing undergarments, her chest is pressed against your back, her right hand is currently covering your eyes, her left hand is on your thigh, she just finished biting down on your neck and now she's moved onto your shoulder
>You utter her name, in a somewhat pained tone, the sting from her bites is quite sharp
>"Shiori..I.."
>She immediately bites down on your shoulder harder
>"How rude, my butler. You don't get to call me by my first name just yet."
>She reminds you of the status between master and servant, a line you crossed just now
>After her stern reminder, she moves her hand towards your crotch, slowly unzipping your pants
>"Your blood isn't enough for me tonight, butler."
>She hasn't done this before, she's a lot more assertive tonight
>she tugs at both your pants, and then your underwear, lowering them to just below your knees
>You can feel everything, she breathes heavily against your neck, the exposed wound from her earlier bite tingles and feels hot from her breath
>Shiori then moves her left hand over your penis, her fingernails are sharp, yet she gently strokes along, the slightest amount of force could pierce it
>"Stay very still, butler"
>You listen to her as she gently caresses along using only her fingernails, finally after a few minutes pass, she grasps at it and begins to stroke along the shaft slowly
>She whispers in your ear playfully, her tone of voice carrying a hint of seduction: "So you were happy to see me earlier huh, well how is it? Is your monkey brain happy?"
>You try your best not to show that she's getting to you, so you simply reply with a boring: "Yes, I'm happy to see you."
>She giggles then she lets go of you, her left hand letting go of your penis, her right hand uncovering your eyes
>You can finally see, but your vision quickly shifts from facing forward to facing the ceiling
>Shiori has pushed you onto the bed, making you lay down
>She then straddles herself on top of you, a move that surprises you
>She whispers, however you don't hear it in your ears, but instead from within you, like her whispers are being carried directly to your brain
>"It's definitely not enough now, I need a little more than just minor stimulation."
>She looks down at you, and your gaze looks back at her
>You can see a mixture of lust and desire in her eyes
>She takes your left arm, then she drags the tip of her tongue along your wrist and bites down into it
>The sharp pain that you expected however doesn't come, instead you feel something far different, and not from your wrist
>At some point, Shiori had moved her panties aside, her wet vagina was exposed.
>What you felt instead of pain from your wrist, was your penis entering Shiori
>You notice blood dripping down there, did she give you her first time?
>However, before you can react, it hits you, the feeling of lightheadedness 
>You've been drained of a lot of blood, with even more rushing down to your penis
>Your eyes begin to close, as Shiori begins to rock her hips, back and forth along you
>You can still feel each and every fold of the walls in her vagina, cling to your penis and squeeze it gently.
>If it weren't for your current blood loss and lightheadedness, you would probably be moving your hips along with hers
>Matching her pace, giving her equal amounts of pleasure.
>However, as if she had planned for you to lose most of your basic functions, she simply smiles at you and repeats her orders from earlier.
>"Stay very still, butler." 
>You have no choice, you stay laying still as she continues to ride you.
>She drops your left arm, letting it fall next to you, then takes your right arm in its place, dragging her tongue along your wrist once again
>This time, she bites into your palm, you feel the immediate sting, but it's instantly replaced by the pleasure you feel from your lower body
>There, you feel a throbbing sensation. You're slowly approaching an orgasm.
>Her smile turns into a wicked smirk, as she starts moving her hips faster, grinding against your hips in circular motions every now and then to stimulate you more.
>Finally, you can't hold it in anymore, your voice rings out softly as you announce your orgasm: "Shiori..I'm cu-"
>She stops you instantly by placing a finger over your lips, and then it happens
>Your semen starts pumping into her, slowly filling her up, at the same time you feel her already tight vagina squeeze down harder on you than before, followed by dull throbbing from all sides
>It seems she had an orgasm with you
>Before you could make any further sense of it all, the blood loss finally hits you and your eyes close heavily.
>The next time you wake up, you're fully clothed in your own bed, however there are bite marks on your left wrist and right hand, a hint that the night you just experienced with your master was not just a dream.
