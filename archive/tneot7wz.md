#Sen Yamamoto Relationship Chart

####Team 1
**Natsuo Uchiha - Hidden Leaf Jonin**
"I've heard stories of the Uchiha, everyone has - bloodthirsty barbarians masquerading as nobles who only care about pride, honour and cold-blooded murder. This one though, there's something odd about him - he's too calm, too cool and too lazy to be a Jonin, let alone one of them. I know how to put up a mask too, Uchiha, you don't fool me - it doesn't matter how much you pretend, I know you'd kill me with a glance from those crimson eyes of yours if I made the wrong move. Your whole clan unnerves me, but you? You're quiet, unknown, you're terrifying."

**D - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"Kid's got some energy, I'll give him that. I never really cared about being the best - I used to just be happy being me. I get it, though, the fear of failing, the terror of not being able to beat everything and everyone that gets in your way. I also know how easy it is to pretend, to protect yourself from your flaws with bravado and laughter, but be careful that doesn't become arrogance, or it'll get you killed before you become the man you want to be."

**Himari Miko - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"She's funny, she's clever, she's cute and she's a fantastic liar -  keep away from this one Junki, she'll eat you alive! For real though, it took me a while to realize how uncomfortable she was in her own skin. Like a bird in a golden cage, she revels in the attention but hates being behind the bars and she's looking for something to fill the days. Tell you what, if you want to go and do something stupid, I'll tag along for a while, you're more interesting than I think you realize."

####Team 2
**Osamu - Hidden Leaf Jonin**
"There's learning, there's research, there's science - and then there's whatever that puppetmaster is up to. I don't know what he thinks he's doing, but I don't buy the whole 'pragmatic scholar,' face he's putting on. I've known plenty of puppetmasters and it's always the same - they're either missing someone in their lives, or they're unhappy with people. Which are you, oh magnanimous master maker of monsters? It doesn't matter, he's more clever than he lets on and he's too dangerous to approach. I'll keep my distance, but if he comes after Ghidorah, I'm burning his laboratory down."

**Shimabukuro - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"He has to become a Chunin, he just has to. I don't know how a man can fail so many times and have that much strength, but it doesn't matter - if he loses that spark, I don't know if I'll be able to live with it. There's a wisdom in that man that nobody here can match and I'm excited to see it put into action. Whatever you do, grandpa, just don't give up, you've only got a little bit left until the finish line, and I'll help you get there if I have to."

**Kichōna - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"I thought this was a puppet at first, creepy enough already to make a doll of a person, but I recently learned just how much worse it was. There's a person in there, or at least part of one - so you were missing someone after all, Osamu. Whatever that creature is though, it's not Human, at least not yet. The stare of its vacant eyes and the way it moves are unsettling, but the moments it does something that only a living being could do are harrowing. Is it trapped in there? Does it know what it is?"

**Nodao-Douji - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"I don't know too much about ogres, but I know enough that they weren't really shinobi material until they helped found Konoha. The red ones in particular, - dumb, aggressive demons that want nothing more than to drink and fight by most scholarly accounts. Looking at Nadao, I don't know if that's entirely true. She's conflicted about something and she's here trying to become a shinobi, things can't be normal back home. Maybe she'll learn to put down the sake without picking up the club one day, I hope she's trying."

####Team 3
**Kamiko Karatachi - Hidden Mist Jonin**
"She's sad, that's the worst part. I've only talked to her once and she saw right through me - I've heard of people who can see other's chakra, even their souls, but I wasn't sure if they were real until I met her. After all those years of seeing everyone's hurts, their failures, their anxieties as if they were right in front of her and she still tries to love. She's even taken to mentoring a few Genin that wandered their way here without teams. I won't bother her any more, there's more important people for her to help and I can't be a distraction."

**Masukuda Rarime - Hidden Cloud Genin**
"She scared me at first - the kind of person that gets that good at hiding is one of two things, a coward or a predator. Unfortunately, she seems to be a bit of both, and it's not her fault, something has broken that girl harder than I've seen most of the war veterans. She's scared of me more than I am of her, but she's trying her best to make friends, I can admire that. She might not be ready for the Chunin exams, most everyone here is looking for out for their teams first and will try to take advantage of her scars - I don't think I could bring myself to."

**Ichika Chinoike - Hidden Steam Genin**
"She's trapped by her own ambition. She wants to help everyone - noble, very noble - but she's walking down the path of self destruction to do it. I can't fault her heart, but she'll need to learn that if you only give from yourself you'll burn up. Believe me, I know how easy it is to decide someone else's life is worth more than yours, but you've got a lot of energy left and can do a lot more good by conserving some of that for yourself. I don't think she's noticed who I really am yet, I'd rather she didn't."

**Kita - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"Another orphan of the Great War, another story we've all seen a thousand times. It'd be easy to overlook them, but every person matters, this boy's story matters. He's found family and lost it - that'd be enough to break any man, but he's still here, he's still fighting and he's still looking for people to fight for. It hurts, I know it does, but just go a little bit further, and a little bit after that, soon you'll be running like you never have before."

####Team 4
**Kiko Inuzuka - Hidden Leaf Jonin**
"She's still fighting the war. I don't know what the Uzumaki did to her, but I know she never got over it. She's killed more than most people here combined, plenty of them probably didn't deserve it. I don't care what you've been through, revenge taken too far is an insatiable fire with no purpose. The fact that Konoha has let her teach Genin is disgusting - it's like the Hokage doesn't want the cycle of hatred to end. The Jonin of the village are cursed and the sooner her and the Uchiha put down their swords forever the sooner we can start healing."

**Remilia Orochimaru - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"The Hidden Leaf has a lot of medical-nin, don't they? It makes sense, where there's warriors, there's those that enable the killing. That's unfair, this girl isn't old enough to know what her tutors did, she's too cheerful for that. From what I hear she wants to become the best medic ever even though she doesn't know what that means - I think she should be encouraged, the last thing we need is another healer giving up, maybe she can help mend this broken world when she grows up. As an aside, I always thought snakes were kind of cool, we never got them in Shimogakure, maybe I'll ask her about them sometime."

####Team 5
**Ezaki Tuto - Hidden Leaf Jonin**

**Jin Hyuga - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"These Hyuga take themselves seriously - the Leaf Village is full of clans that compete with each other to be the best, but I hear the Hyuga are the harshest on their own kids that don't make the cut. This one's no exception, they drilled some taijutsu into him that some Jonin I've known couldn't keep up with. Imagine my surprise when I actually get to talk to him and he doesn't take himself that seriously at all. If more fighters were like him, we'd be in a better place. There's something angry beneath that mask though, I don't know what it is, but with that family it has to be something back at home."

**Shinrō Kamotai - Hidden Leaf Genin**
"I wish you weren't here, for your own sake, monks should be doing better things than learning how to fight and kill. Still, you seem like a good enough sort, maybe all the prayers and meditation really does mellow you out? Either way, I'll be rooting for you, but there's something you can do for me as well. Ghidorah has a lot of powers that we don't think are natural - Tsugumi and I are trying to figure out what was done to him and you're the only one we've met that knows ink style, if you can check in on him there we might have one more piece of the puzzle.

**Yuma Kouda - Hidden Star Genin**
"I don't know how a girl your age got those eyes, you're not even an Uchiha. You want my advice? Get rid of them - all that power doesn't matter if it drags you into hell like everyone else who gets those crimson eyes. I get it, you think you need it, but relying on it is only making you worse. Please, just go back to the academy, I know you can get stronger, you need to beat that cursed thing some monster put in your head before it beats you."

####Team 6
**Tsugumi - Hidden Frost Jonin**
"I've known her longer than anyone else. When I was young, my mother would force me into her lectures at the Grand Library and now I have to listen to them again. Don't misunderstand me, she's a brilliant teacher and helped me become what I am today. The problem is she doesn't want me to be what I am, she wants me to be like mother - I just can't get her to understand that my place is out here, not back home. Her books are really good, by the way, I've been sneaking them to the other Genin."

**Ghidorah - Hidden Mist Genin**
"Poor Ghidorah, he's been through more than me and Junki combined and he's still got a heart underneath all that. Nobody that young should have to carry that much burden, and every time someone calls him a monster I get more than a little defensive. He's not a monster, he's a boy - a sweet, brilliant, caring boy, and I'll let myself fall a thousand times before I let someone make him doubt himself. I'm sorry that I couldn't save your friend."

**Junki Takenaga - Hidden Mist Genin**
"Junki, I've only known you for a year and you've already shown me so much. I can't replace the ones you lost, just like you can't replace mine, but I think we both know deep down that they're not coming back. That you can look into the future with so much determination and so little hatred - I don't care if you're younger than me, or if you know less, you've got what it takes to be a leader and I'll follow you as far as I can. Forgive me."

**Sen Yamamoto - Hidden Frost Genin**
"Sen? Don't worry about Sen, they're just a nobody on their way out. People like that don't deserve the attention."

####Team 7
**Fujiwara Nobutake - Iron Samurai Aonisaibushi**
"A samurai, here? They'd be right at home in the Hidden Leaf - half the shinobi here think they're supposed to be warriors anyway. I'll be honest, I don't like your kind, you're killers to the core, but at least your code is built for it unlike ours. If you're here to escape the violence, you came to the wrong place, after the War we're all the same. But who knows, maybe you'll do something that upsets all these Jonin and maybe I can help with that. If you ever need some advice on how things work around here, I'll gladly give."

####Other
**Kiyjo-Douji - Hokage**
"I'd heard an oni was the current Hokage but I have to admit I didn't fully believe it until now. Sure enough, she's an oni, and she's got the appetite for drink to prove it. She's proven me wrong about the Douji, good, I'd hoped all the stories were just that. Still, she's been put in charge because she's the best at fighting - do we really want a world where the strongest are making the decisions, rather than the smartest, or the kindest? She's got a good heart, or so I hear, but she'd do a lot more good as the right hand of someone a little less chaotic."

**Engetsu Bōfū, Raikage**
"Our blood's on your hands, old man. Everyone else tries to forget the war, even these Leaf Village ninja, we all know how bad it was. But you, you don't want to let it go, you found it fun, you never cared how many people died because you were too busy living your best life. I promised I'd never kill, but for you, I'd make an exception if I could. Fortunately, it seems like I don't need to - you can't hide that you're slowing down and sooner or later it's going to kill you."
