The Broken Heartlock. Ch.1.

*”Gooood morning everyone! It’s a beautiful day outside and I have some great new to start off it off with…!”*

God, morning shows are so awful. You’ve never liked them, sure, but shit. These people live one of the most plastic existences for a camera. The laugh tracks and the sound effects are getting under your skin. You take a sip of your coffee.

…

It’s awful. It’s as if you’re drinking liquid dirt. A cookie to go with it, in hopes of sweetening up your day. The cookie tastes like sawdust. They tasted fine until yesterday.

*slurp*

“Eat quietly, please.” You though. You wished to remain as silent as possible.

The TV kept it’s ruckus in the background while you tried your best to enjoy your breakfast, after last night, it sure as fuck wasn’t easy. 

Marine began making herself some toast, she bent herself over the table and tried to reach for the butter, slightly out of her reach. Her fingers are barely grazing the plate, but she isn’t going to pick it up anytime soon. You pushed the butter towards her.

“Thanks!” She said with a plastic smile. You remained silent.

She’s applying the butter to her toast now. You can hear the knife scrape the burnt parts. 

It’s getting on your nerves. Don’t be dramatic, you told yourself. You’ll have to talk it out once more, so you’re avoiding making things worse before then.

“So, Anon…” 

Oh God, please not now. It’s too early for this.

“Did’ya sleep on it?”

“Marine, I’m eating.”

Marine sighed and kept putting butter on her toast.

“It’s for the both of us, you know?”

You snapped while looking onto your most recent bite on the sawdusty cookie, crumbs falling onto your dirt-coffee.

“For the both of us.” You replied in a blunt, sarcastic tone.

Marine tried to smile. She wasn’t getting through your silent, grumpy face.

“Anon, please.”

“Marine, I’m not going to become a fucking cuck.”

“I don’t want you to!” 

“Then why the fuck did you ask me for an open relationship?!”

“Because we’ve been together since forever!”

“And I like it that way!”

“Anon, I’m the only woman you’ve ever been with. Don’t you want to try having sex with someone else?”

“Holy shit, no!” You yelled. “I have never fucking cheated on you!”

“I didn’t say anything about cheating, aren’t you bored of me?”

“No, not ever, not once in our entire time together.”

“It’s been so long, I want to try new things!”

You tilted your head and your eyes widened. “New things? Like getting fucked by randoms every night?”

“I’m not just going to fuck everyone I see, why don’t you trust me?”

“I used to trust until you asked me if you could cheat.”

“There’s that word again, it’s not like that!”

The exchange went on until your cups went cold. An endless back and forth of pleas and anger. Marine kept trying to find a way to make you understand she didn’t want to cheat on you, and that’s why she asked you beforehand. Tears were streaming down her face. As much you managed your language, you couldn’t manage your tone of indignance. Marine got up and went for the bathroom, slamming the door shut and sitting on top of the toilet. 

And she began sobbing. You didn’t hear it, but you knew.

God fucking dammit. You dumped your coffee down the sink and watched it flow as your willpower grew weaker by the second. You stood before the door and heard Marine quietly sobbing onto her sleeves. You’ve never been able to handle seeing her cry, not even now.

You remained outside until she stopped. 

“Marine, you’re going to miss your stream.”

She replied after a few seconds. 

“Right.”

She opened the door and you let her through. At first she didn’t look at you, but after a few seconds she dug herself in your arms you couldn’t refuse her.

“I’m sorry for yelling at you.” You said.

She remained silent. 

“What if…” She spoke.

“I think it’s been enough for today.”

“What if I let you do it with one of my coworkers first, would you change your stance on the open relationship?”

“Marine, please.”

“Would you?”

“No.”

“Why?”

“Because I love you, Marine, I don’t want to do it with anyone else.”

“But would you do it for me?”

“I don’t see how those are related.”

“Think about it. You’ll get to do it first.”

“Marine. It’s been enough for today.”

She quietly left for her PC and began streaming while you made yourself a second breakfast. You made her some too. And after that, you went for a walk to clean your mind.

~*~

The horrible buzzing of LED lights penetrated your ears while they shone over you and your drink. Roberu, the bartender, kept giving you pats on the back while he accompanied you with a beer himself. There are certain benefits to having a drink on a random weekday. 

“So you’re sure that if you say no she’ll just do it anyway?”

“I don’t know…”

“You gotta know, man.”

“I’ve known Marine for ages, I’ve always believed she was faithful to me. I chose to believe.”

“Come on Anon, you’re not stupid. You would know if she was fucking someone else.”

“Would I really? At this point I’m not sure.”

“Well, marrying a woman like her does make you paranoid she’ll fuck anyone if she gets bored, knowing anyone would be trying to get in her panties.”

“You’re not helping, Roberu.”

“I’m getting there.” He talked over you. “So, you know that your wife would get anyone she wanted, and yet she chose you. If she wanted to cheat, she could, yet she told you first.”

“And?”

“It means she means well.”

“God…”

“You probably knew it would happen, man.”

Roberu had been running in circles for the past hour. He knew of no way to comfort his friend, alcohol, for the first time, wasn’t helping him. He sighed, pondering his options until he picked the one he had been avoiding all this time.

“Alright man, I say fuck it. Do it.”

“What?”

“Hey, you’re the one who came to me for advice, it’s not my fault if you don’t like the answer.”

“Roberu, I don’t want to-“

“But what other option is there? There’s no going back to normal after this, and I know you know that.”

You remained silent. Bullseye. 
 
“Listen man, you can do what she says, have a one night stand with whoever you want, and then after that, well...”

“I don’t want to leave Marine…”

“So you’re either going to bottle up your feelings.” Roberu pointed at you with his beer. “No pun intended, and grow more bitter by the day thinking she’s out getting gangbanged, or you can just do it. At least you won’t get the absolute worst part of the deal.”

“How is that not the worst part of it?”

“Because you’ll have closure. Either she does it behind your back, or she does it in front of you. I think living in denial would be worse.”

You sulked on top of your arms, your eyes blinking lethargically. 

“Either way, you’re going to regret it.” He said.

You sighed and downed your beer. 

“I fucking hate this brand.”

“I know you do.” He said. “Up for another?”

You drank in silence while Roberu worked, serving other customers. It sucks so much when he's right. What other option is there? Perhaps another gulp will help you find the answer.

~*~

The same buzzing lights welcomed you back a few days later. 

“So…” You spoke. “I gave her my answer.”

“How did it go?” Asked Roberu.

“Her enthusiasm made me want to die.”

“Ouch.”

“She told me she could set me up with girls like Choco-senpai or Aki-senpai, but I figured they’re…”

“They’re?”

You sighed.

“The same kind of woman that would do such things as Marine, I don't think I fit between those options.”

Now Roberu sighed. 

“Well, they are hot pieces of ass. A night with them might ruin your relationship with your wife.”

“That’s not the point. All of this, it was so sudden…”

“Marine’s always been extremely sexual, right? When we we’re back in school I remember catching you two in the middle of a blowjob in my bathroom.”

“Yes, shit, but we were way, way younger back then. The things you can do in your 20’s aren’t the same you do when you’re older.” 

“Maybe that’s right, but that wasn’t the only one of your little escapades, was it?”

“Shut up…”

“Yeah, like the time you two sneaked off a party, whose house was it again? Chris’?”

“No, no, it was a girl’s, uhh, Hana’s?”

“Right! So, you two looked for the first empty room you found and got into Hana’s little brother’s room.” Roberu was containing his laughter.

“And we…” You muffled your laugh.

“And you left the condom between the sheets, and Hana’s mother found it the next day.”

Roberu laughed heartily. The memory was cringey, but even that makes you look back fondly on the past.

“God…” You said. Silence stood between you two once more. “Roberu… I don’t want what we have, what Marine and I have to just…”

He remained silent as you spoke.

“I mean, the thought of her enjoying herself with someone is just… ugh.” 

"You were always paranoid about it until you got married, weren't you?"

"Yeah..."

Roberu tapped your shoulder and lifted his hand in signal for pausing the conversation.

“Hold on, gotta take care of the other customers too. I’ll be back in a second.”

Roberu’s bar felt homely during the week, small but not cramped, comfy. Only a handful of patrons ever come to it, but those who did kept the place alive because of the host. Roberu was a great conversationalist in general. Many people come to drown their sorrows. He’s cheaper than a therapist, at least. 

Roberu came back with a beer in hand and stretched it out to you.

“You don’t have to pity me so much to gift me alcohol.”

“It’s from the lady across the bar.” He pointed to the side with his thumb.

Your eyes involuntarily looked across and saw a pink haired girl, with wings on her head, dressed in a typical office getup. She swirled a bit of wine in a glass, sneaking glances at you.

“Isn’t she cute?” Roberu asked you in a sly tone. “What’cha waiting for?”

“Should I?” You looked at the can.

“It’s up to you.” Roberu began cleaning some glasses, you knew he wouldn’t entertain your sadness until you gave it a shot.

You took a deep breath and got up from your seat. She pretended not to look at you as you got closer. She had some beautiful, sky-blue eyes and some meaty hips you pretended not to look at. Those pants are way too small for those thighs.

You raised the can to her, she gave you a sweet smile.

“Thanks.”

“No problem.”

Nervously she fidgeted with her fingers, her eyes jumped all over the place.

“My name’s Anon, pleased to meet you.”

“I-I’m Lui, but everyone calls me Lui-nee, eh, I mean, you can just call me Lui.”

You smiled.

You sat beside her and gave short sips to your beer, trying to make it last until a conversation happened, but not much was happening.

“You come here often?” You asked her.

“Not really, I’ve, eh, recently started to come here, I guess.”

“Oh.”

Well, this isn’t going anywhere. The problem of being with a single woman your entire life is that you have no idea how to handle a conversation with another. Lui seemed anxious. 

“Agh, I hate small talk.” You said. 

"Me too" Lui giggled. 

"Thanks for the beer."

She smiled.

And so, you two shared each other's company in silence, until Roberu's TV accidentally showed an episode of the Idolmaster anime.

You heard a distant "Fuck!" and swiftly, he changed it back to the regular streaming of music.

You laughed heartily as his little slip. Same old Roberu, some things never change, he's still burying his otaku self.

"Idolmaster..." You muttered. "Man, it's been ages."

"You play idolmaster?" Lui asked.

“Used to, I guess. I don't really have time for stuff like that anymore.”

“Oh..." 

"You play anything?"

Lui's face lit up with a curios smile.

The conversation became cheery, you almost mentioned your wife was a mangaka. Both geeked out for a bit until Lui’s unease faded away. She asked Roberu for a refill, you asked him for another beer. His sly smile made itself present as he poured Lui another glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. He tapped your shoulder and winked, his sign to tell you to just get up and leave, he’ll check the tab with you later.

You swallowed. Now what? Lui seems to be enjoying herself, would it ruin the moment to ask her something like “Wanna get out of here?” You spun your half-empty beer can in your hand while Lui spoke about how Light was right in Death Note.

“Hey, Lui.” You spurted out.

“Yeah?”

No going back.

“Your place or my place?”

Lui’s face became red like a tomato, her hand shivered as it swirled the wine.

“I mean, uh…” She fumbled once more. “How about, my place?”

“Sure, lead the way.”

Lui was going to reach for her purse as you took out some cash and left it on the counter, you took Lui’s hand in yours and got up.

“B-But, I was going to pay.” Lui said.

“It’s alright.”

Roberu saw the money and glared at you, then smiled. You gave him an ok hand sign as you left with Lui.

~*~

Lui went to her bathroom while you waited in her bed. 

“Well, here we are.” You thought. Now that you were sitting down in an unknown apartment, a torrent of feelings began raining on you. Marine had left your mind after Lui bought you the first drink, but now she was all you could think about. This scenario feels oddly familiar, but it's missing her.

By now she’d come out of the shower, dry and naked and sit her gigantic ass beside you. You’d slap it playfully and she’d turn to face you with her lustful eyes. She’d turn off the lights and turn on the bedside lamp and cuddle you. Sometimes you’d give her a kiss on her forehead and let her sleep, sometimes she’d bite your beck, pleading for your touch. Other times she’d try out new stuff, and come out of the bathroom with a blindfold on her hand and some rope in the other.

“Rock, paper, scissors!” She’d say. The loser had to wear the blindfold and get tied. Marine tried to lose on purpose. You’d fuck her nice and rough, just how she likes it, but always making sure nothing hurts her for real. You’d slap her ass so it could be heard all over the room, mixed with her pleas for more. When you were the blinded and bounded one, she’d rode you while holding your wrists with her hand, and lowered herself down to your ear to whisper sweet things onto it.

“I love you so much, Anon.” And she’d give you a sweet kiss. “Back to business!” She would bite your shoulder and start slamming your pelvis with her buttocks, making the bed squeal. After those kinds of nights, you’d check the bed frame, finding little cracks in the wooden planks.

Everything was so nice until she asked you that stupid fucking question, and now you’re here. A little oppression in your chest wouldn’t let up. Perhaps if you leave before Lui comes out, you can still go back to Marine. You can still talk this out with her and have everything be the same as it was.

Your phone rang. It was her.

“Ahoy, honey!” She greeted you with her cheerful idol voice.

“Hey babe.”

“Are you coming home yet?”

“Uh, actually, I went out.”

“Eh? Really?” She seemed more surprised than anything. You had stopped hanging out with your friends as much after you two got married. “Well, tell Roberu to bring you home safe!”

“I-I’m, not coming home tonight.”

Marine went silent.

“Are you…?” She knew. You could hear it in her voice

“Yeah…”

“O-Oh, that’s… very nice! Alright, tell me all about it in the morning, alright?”

“… Ok…”

“Have fun!” 

And with that she hung up.

“She’s still so… enthusiastic about it…” You almost cried. There’s nothing to go back to now. Roberu’s advice came back to chew you out. “Either way I’m gonna regret it, right?”

Lui finally came out of the bathroom after what felt like ages. She was wearing nothing but her underwear.

“Sorry for the wait, I was, uh…” She couldn’t find an excuse.

You lied in bed and waited for her to approach you, not taking the hint. You tapped the bed.

Lui seemed nervous once more. She lied on the spot beside you, her eyes looking everywhere but to you.

You gave her an awkward kiss. She didn’t refuse your lips, yet they seemed furtive. Her body shivered as your hand began caressing her, from her breast to her hips. You noticed her hand trying to reach for your wrist to stop you, but she wouldn’t, instead, her arm twitched and her fist clenched.

You broke the kiss and turned back to your side of the bed.

“You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to, you know.”

“I-It’s alright…” Lui muttered.

“It’s not fun if only one of us wants to do it.” You said, not realizing the irony of your own words.

“I’m sorry for being such a tease, Anon…”

“It’s ok.”

Lui sobbed. At the first hearing of such a sound, your boyfriend instincts kicked in. You prompted yourself up and watched her wipe a tear off her eye.

“I.. I’m sorry for being so selfish, I just… I wanted someone to comfort me…”

“Comfort you?”

“I, I just felt lonely, I guess.” Lui sniffled.

“Ah…”

“I didn’t think something like this would happen, I’m sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.”

You looked into the distance, unable to say anything.

“I’ll get you a cab so you can go home, I’m sorry.”

You didn’t want to go back to Marine, not now. Much less, you didn’t leave Lui by herself. Something feels awfully familiar about this scenario, it's as if you've been here before.

“I mean, we could just, chill?” You spoke.

“Eh?”

“I have a Netflix account, how about it?”

Lui was taken aback. Her sobs became quieter.

“S-Sure, but, uh…” She looked at her body.

You smiled and nodded. She went back into the bathroom and came out a wife beater, then reached for some underpants in one of her drawers.

Lui turned her TV on and searched for something to watch with you. Then she asked if you’d like something to eat or drink. 

Lui fell asleep first. Netflix's "Are you still watching?" message showed up. You didn’t know how to proceed with the situation, so you thought you’d show yourself the way out.

Lui woke up by the sudden shift in weight on the bed, then she heard her door being opened.

“Anon…”

“Yeah?”

“I… uh…” She muttered. “I have a guest room, if you want.”

You fumbled with your answer.

“Sure.”
