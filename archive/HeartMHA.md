Armored 
~ A containment suit for the heat created by his quirk with a few other additions such as the ability to integrate his gadgets, check his heart rate at all times as well as directing blasts of steam for offense or mobility. 
>General Modifiers
Martial Arts
Sharpshooting 3x
~ Katsumi got into hunting as a means to pratice breathing control, typically uses pressurized blood projectiles or the steam created by his quirk to shoot at targets. 

Gadget: Doki-Doki Device 
~ Katsumi's quirk can create audible heartbeat sounds as it revs up but they're nothing more than noise polution, but this sthetoscope inspired device can amplify them into powerful shockwaves or debilitating noises. It's usually set on his chest, but it can set on other places. 

Gadget: Left/Right Vent
~ A pair of gauntlets made with the goal of further improving the ability to fire blood bullets by spinning blood like a vortex before shooting it. While it was made mainly for range attacks, it can still improve close quarters attacks in a similar manner

Athletics (Endurance) 
~ Training meant to increase his quirk's maximum capacity but as the quirk also boosts his physical ability it also means that he's able to keep up with a lot of exertion before raising his heart rate. 

Survival 
~ Trips into the wilderness are quite the relaxing experience,  Katsumi's experience is mainly about cold regions as those were the ones least risky with his quirk. 
>Quirk: Heartstopper (Body Manipulation / Mutant)
>Target: Self 
>Location: Cardiovascular system 
>Duration: Permanent
>Function: Quantity , Quality,  Shape 
Mutant type quirk that grants its user a remodeled cardiovascular system whose efficiency increases the higher their heart rate is, as  the boost increases so does the temperature and pressure of the blood flowing in their veins, which in turn radiates heat intense enough to be used as a weapon against anything that approaches.  The quirk is able to build up power up to the point their heart is not able to keep with the strain causing a heat attack alongside a powerful thermal explosion resulting in the loss of most of the built up energy, however as their entire body is able to pump blood to some degree, it's still possible to move until the main heart restarts.

>Info

Born with an abnormal quirk, Katsumi's life could be summarized in two sentences: Hospitals and self imposed isolation. Due to the nature of his mutation he was forced to constantly visit doctors to evaluate his condition and confirm if his heart wouldn't give up due to the stress of his quirk and after confirming its limitations Katsumi spent most of his life avoiding risking causing an accident with his quirk, refining his control over his heartbeat so he could go out without worries. As such he didn't do many outdoors activities that involved interacting with people, mostly staying at home or going into the wilds. Due to his routine, Katsumi is very skilled with domestic chores, drawing and has even tried releasing a few songs using a vocaloid progamn as a hobby.

He's usually very relaxed as a consequence of his quirk, enjoys the small things in life with an endless sense of wonder, and is shameless enough to enjoy shoujo mangas and visual novels.
