Grounded Flight



You see him sitting alone. It doesn’t bother you…at least you think it doesn’t. He has his life, you have yours. And you’ve been doing pretty well lately. You just transferred to the College of Anthromorphic Media Studies and you were watching the first ever recorded interaction between a human and beast diplomat. Since then, the world had only globalized and now every country had degrees of crossover between the different races. Hell, most of your friends were beastmen, you didn’t think you discriminated.

The professor dismissed the class and everyone packed their bags, except for the white griffin. He had the body of an anthromorphic lion beast, but the lonely head of a bird and light blue eyes, white feathers bleeding into white fur. He wore a black tank top and jeans. You noticed his lean muscles, something that you think would give him confidence, but didn’t. You were going to leave the class, meetup with your friends for lunch…but you noticed the griffin hadn’t moved an inch, his hand still resting on his chin. You paused and took a breath before approaching him.

“Is everything alright?” You remember his name from the roll. “It’s Alistair, right?” 

He looked back over his shoulder. “Yes, human. I’m surprised you remember my name. No one else does.”

You sit in the chair next to him. “You seem kind of upset. What’s wrong?” You prod, noticing that when you are up close his features become hauntingly beautiful. His features evoke imagery of a winter prince. 

“Well, I don’t think you would understand. But I was thinking of the movie we watched. It bothered me.” He looks over at you with his blue eyes. “But I don’t expect you to care, you’re probably just taking this class for an easy A.” 

He may be beautiful, but his cockiness is starting to piss you off. “Man…you think that lowly of me? I used to read human-beast legislature for fun. In grade school.” You grab your bags and prepare to leave, but feel a feathered hand touch yours.

“Sorry. I was being rude. I’ve just been out of sorts lately. Please don’t think poorly of me, human. It’s just, do you think it was really wise for humans and beasts to do that?”

You feel a flash of heat as his hand leaves yours. You knew some of your fluffier friends were a bit more touchy-feely than humans, but you didn’t expect him to be as well. Finally you respond to his question.

“How could it have been a bad thing? My philosophy is that as different as humans and beasts are, our collaborations benefit both of our societies more than any issues that have arised from cohabitating. I have a few books I can recommend to you on relationship theory when it comes to beasts and humans.”

The griffin looked stunned. His demeanor had changed completely. “I…come off as rude, I’m deeply sorry. I had no idea you were so educated on the topic. Not to be—dismissive.”

You breathe out a sigh and open up to him in return. “ I think it would be great if we shared notes and…you aren’t rude. You just seem to be going through a lot.” Maybe there was a connection here. “I’m a great listener though, seriously.”

He stares at you, transfixed. You look back, his eye contact doesn’t break. He reaches for your hand again…a handshake? What an awkward and charming griffin. You trade numbers and smiles.

You find out he’s auditing the class because of health issues. You try to find out what they are but his way of texting is cryptic and unemotional. He won’t open up to you through text so you ask him to meet up with him. He asks if you can meet him at his house off-campus. You agree to meet Friday afternoon when neither of you have class. He floods your messages with happy emojiis. 

You drive to his place, not sure what to expect. It’s up in the hills of town in a nicer neighborhood - A two story house painted blue. You pull into the empty driveway. He comes out, wearing pink shorts and a light blue t-shirt. 

“You actually came, human!” He waves you over with a wide grin. To your surprise, he pulls you in tightly for an embrace. You nearly die of shock seeing how different he is at his home. You find out he lives at his parents house, but they are almost never home because both work in the medical profession. 

He takes you upstairs. His room is cozy. He likes the texture of wool, and…the stoic bird prince has a bed full of plushies. This makes you gush internally. You take the books you reccomended him out of your bag and get into a long discussion on the philosophy of humans and beasts. Then you can see a strange look flash across his face. 

Suddenly he starts seizing. He’s shaking violently and you wished you had taken that EMT class back in high school. You feel helpless as he twitches, then lays unconscious. You know you aren’t supposed to touch him, but you want to comfort him. You find some water on his desk and help him up when he starts regaining consciousness.

“Easy…You had a seizure. Here, drink this.” You offer him the water. He knocks it out of your hand. He tells you about his onset epilepsy, his severe depression, his suicide attempt last year. He begins crying. “Sorry…I’m sorry, I didn’t want you to know. When people get involved I just scare them off…I don’t think I can live a normal life.” He says, sobbing. The afternoon sun begins setting and the red glows through his breezy bedroom window. You’ve never wanted to take care of your other friends like you wanted to take care of this fragile white bird sitting next to you.

“I know it’s hard…” You begin to say…and before you can finish the griffin has leapt onto you and is pressing his face into your shirt. You hold him. Eventually, through the sound of his cries, you stroke his soft arms, then face. You didn’t notice, but at some point you had started crying too. 

The soft blue of the night cast a shadow over the both of you. The room is still. Eventually he pulls himself off and takes his medication. He takes you downstairs and heats up taquitos and pulls out leftovers. You eat while he profusely apologizes. You have to keep insisting that he shouldn’t feel embarassed. You love him and his vulnerabilities.

Your other friends in class stare at you as you spend all your time with him. They become more distant as you dig deeper into your new friend. He reads the books with you. He talks about them with you. He talks about his abusive childhood and you open up about all the problems your parents gave you. The semester is coming to an end and he looks glum again. 

The two of you sneak off to the forested part of the campus. You sit against the closest tree and he sits beside you. “Can I ask you something?” He stares at you awkwardly. You smile and nod. “I’m a bit obtuse when it comes to human rituals…but I know we are close now…so I thought to ask..” He pauses and you respond, “What is it?” You laugh. 

“Are you interested in….” He loses his trail of thought and you worry about a seizure. But instead he looks down dejected. But you knew what he was going to ask.

“I am interested in you. Actually, I was waiting for you to ask me.” You say to him. If his white feathers could turn red they would have and he looks at you, waiting. You move closer, putting your arms around him and show him how to kiss. 

He’s awkward and clearly hasn’t done it a lot, but manages to follow along and makes a delightful gasp for air afterwards. This makes you laugh and you hug him for a long time. You watch the griffin’s chest rise and fall with his breathing. It makes you relaxed. 

“I want to do that again!” He begs you and you oblige. Some people are walking around the park now but you don’t care. To pleasure the once gloomy young man produces a euphoric feeling in you. Watching him discover how much you care is like a drug to you. You find yourself deeply aroused. You want to share everything with him. But there are too many people here and there are eyes on both of you now, making sure you two don’t break the unspoken rules of society. 

You walk with him to your car. Since becoming friends you’ve been driving him to classes and back home. Sometimes the two of you will stop at a drive-through. Today you just get in the car and carry on where you left off. He initiates this time and presses his tongue against yours, even with the beak, you two manage to figure it out. 

You’re feeling up his perfect, feathery slim body. You trace your fingers under his tank top and play with his nipples. Then you are kissing past his neck, up near his face. He’s trying not to moan. The car is getting warm. You think you see someone look in the window and you two sit up quickly. 

“Can you take us back to my place? My parents aren’t coming home until late tonight. We’ll have plenty of time to ourselves.”

You start the car, eager to reach his house. He looks at you and smiles…but it changes to a frown. You know that look. It appears when he is having doubts. 

“What’s wrong, cutie?” You ask him. 

“I’ve never done anything like this…and I don’t know if or how to. I want to take it slow and…” He stops. You didn’t think he could be any cuter and you wonder if maybe he’s playing it up a little. You put a hand on his neck.

“We’ll go slow. I’m only going to do what you want to do and nothing else.” You say. 

He smiles.

When you reach his bedroom the doubt on his face is replaced with something else. He seems flushed. He thinks he may have another seizure but it goes away. He collapses on his bed. 

“This is what you would have to deal with if we dated.” He says.

“It’s worth it. And you aren’t baggage to me at all. I used to wonder if I was good enough for you. I mean, you’re a genius.” You tell him. 

It’s no use arguing. Both of you have insecurities and both of you know that being together is enough to make you forget most of them. He kisses you and both of you pull off your shirts and pants. He is wearing orange boxer-briefs. You are in light blue striped boxers. He says he likes them and this makes you aroused. You explore his body and all of its sensitive areas. You have him lay on his stomach and massage his back with the shea-scented lotion he uses.

Pressing your hands firmly against his snowy shoulder-blades, you want to hug him again but refrain. He keeps sighing in relief.

“That feels so fucking good.” He says. 

You lean close to him and nibble on his floppy, lion-ear. 

“What else can I do for you?.” you ask. 

He laughs. A sound you’ve only heard a few times, but every time it gives you goosebumps. 

“You’ve saved me from being suicidal and depressed. I would hate to think where I would be if you didn’t stop to talk to me in class. Honestly, you’ve done too much for me.” He purrs. Even though you two both ended up in your underwear, you feel comfortable just cuddling with him on the queen-sized bed while he talks about his plans. He’s the big spoon and you like the way he’s absent-mindedly kneading your abdomen. Now he’s feeling the fabric of your boxers. He puts a hand on your leg. 

“I always planned on dropping out after this semester. I’m still going to…but I will miss being in your class.” He says. “My parents know how much you’ve helped me, they’re really impressed with you. They wanted me to ask you if you’d consider moving into the guest room and being my helper. Basic stuff like being around when I’m…” He trails off. This prompts you to hug tighter.

You had planned on living in student accommodation for the second year, but this option was infinitely better. You told Alistair you would love to take their offer. He was happy with your response. He kisses you and gently places a feathered hand over your boxers. You slowly thrust into his hand. He doesn’t know he is teasing you, but he is. You are training him in these arts and should expect some delays, so it doesn’t bother you. 

“Can I jerk you off?” You ask him. He nods shyly. 

You lay back against his headboard and hold him close to you. You put a generous amount of his lotion on your palm. You stick a hand down his boxer-briefs, feeling for his balls. Instead you find that his shaft is begging to be let out. He pulls his underwear down and lets out his hungry cock. You decide to tease him by lightly stirring two of your fingers against the head of it. He purrs loudly. Then you grip around the base and slide your hand up and down. He moves his hips forward.

You don’t let him escape his base pleasures, jerking him off at a stronger pace, all the way to his head and back. He’s making a chirping noise. You wrap your legs around him and feel his fluffy abdomen with one hand, stroking and edging him with the other. His juicy precum is leaking all over his own cock and your fingers. You whisper in one of his floppy ears: “How are you feeling?” 

“Please.” He begs. “Keep going.” He pauses in between each syllable. You go back to handling his cock, this time pumping closer to his head. You can’t help yourself and begin kissing his neck, breathing heavily yourself. You are leaking a mess of precum into your loose boxers, grinding against the griffin’s back. You want Alistair’s cock inside of you. You want to fuck him, too. Both of you are panting and sweating as you enter a deeper arousal. 

He shifts around. He wants to touch yours and the feeling of his delicate fingers sends a welcome jolt up your cock. You take off the boxers and throw them to the side. Both of your cocks are erect and twitching. What if you?... It’s like he is reading your mind. He slowly slides his up to yours, the electric feelings touch and produce sparks.

There isn’t much time to play now, cum is leaking out from both cocks. You firmly grasp the two together and lean in to kiss. He can’t quiet the noises that come out of his beak. “FUCK!” He grunts. That does it. You grind your orgasm against his. Cum is spurting on both of your abdomens. It keeps coming and coming. Then it is dribbling out. He leans back letting out a tremendous sigh. You collapse on top of him, pressing your sticky crotches together. Your desire to kiss him hasn’t left. He obliges.

“I could have had a seizure. But, I felt far away from that place with you. I wasn’t even worried about it.” He tells you. You look over to your sensitive boyfriend sitting on the edge of the bed. He’s cleaning himself off with a towel. 

“I’m always here if it happens. I’ll make sure you’re safe.” It sounds cheesy, but after the mind-blowing sex you’re pretty sure you can say whatever you want. Maybe because it was genuine, that made it not cheesy? You can’t wait to bury your face in his soft feathers again. The griffin laughs. 

“You know, I’m only taking one class this summer. I’m not working either.” You say. He looks back at you with his royal eyes.

“That means you’ll have time to teach me everything.” He says warmly. Immediately, the arousal floods back into you. You wonder if he will be up for another round soon. Then you realize good things can wait and stuff like basic necessities matter too. To you, his needs are a basic necessity. He puts on your boxers and T-shirt. You put on his boxer-briefs. You can’t stay soft for one minute. 

That night you go out to a beast-cuisine joint. He’s looking at you the whole time. You get the food to go. Each of you can barely eat half your food because hormones are already flooding back. He’s shivering from them. You need to comfort him in every way you can. He grabs your arm and leads you upstairs. There is no pretext as clothes come off again. You drink his scent in.
