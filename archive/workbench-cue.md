**Workbench.CUE:**
https://files.catbox.moe/691tl1.png
Copies of *Sonic CD* with oddities related to the Round *"Wacky Workbench."*

The existence of this copy was first reported in July 2007 on a forum, with video footage alongside it.
Later on, another user posted about their own copy, and with some help, it was dumped in October of the same year.
That forum went down shortly after (apparently around 3 months/January 2008), and the ROM became lost media.
It managed to resurface around a month ago (July of 2022) since a former user of that forum posted it to Twitter. Apparently they remembered it out of nowhere and thought that others might want to experience it, god knows why.

**Anomalies:**
When the player enters Wacky Workbench, the game occasionally randomly causes Sonic to time-travel to the Past, where he finds himself in a room full of the angel statues from the secret area. The game will then freak out, the palettes cycling in a sorta strobe effect that could give some unlucky fuck a seizure or something, then crash the emulator/console it's running on. Once the game is started again, it enters an infinitely looping Wacky Workbench Zone 2 in the present, with Sonic's palette warped into a vomit-like mix of purples, blues, and yellows, similar to those of the Round itself.

Oddly, the people reproducing this glitch have stated that the level layout starts to warp with each loop, getting more difficult to pass through, with unfair enemy placements, hazards where there weren't any previously, all that shit. The level's tiles also seem to occasionally break, displaying the wrong graphics, most notably with the angel statue randomly appearing, replacing the floor or walls. Odd. The level's palette also occasionally swaps to different colors before reverting within a few seconds. Time Warp signs also do not appear. It is impossible to time travel, as using Debug Mode to place a sign and using it to warp just causes the game to crash.

It has also been reported that the game speaks, in the form of insults, usually when the player idles for a long enough time, or gets hurt/dies.

I've personally been able to confirm the first part with the level warping, but I haven't personally experienced the speech, I'm not sure HOW it manages this, but video recordings of it happening DO exist...I mean they could be edited, but I can't confirm.

The game no longer time overs the player, but it tends to crash the emulator it's running on within roughly 10 minutes of the glitch's activation. 
(Naturally, some speed-runners have taken this as a challenge, trying to progress as far as possible before that happens. Crazy.)

Once the glitch is activated, the game can **never** be returned to normal, it will always start up in this semi-warped Wacky Workbench Zone 2 and always crash after roughly 10 minutes. Not even deleting the save data fixes this.
It also seems to break other copies of Sonic CD on the user's computer, essentially making more copies of Workbench.CUE. Which is a boring name, but it's what the original poster of the ROM called it, so it just stuck.
(Excluding the PC ports and 2011 Whitehead version for more than obvious reasons.)
It is completely unknown how it does this, but I've been able to confirm it on my own computer, so I guess it's true?

Those copies are completely broken, just to be clear. I checked by moving them onto a virtual machine and running them.
Luckily, this breakage only happens when the glitch is activated in the fucked copy, and only once, so new copies can be safely downloaded and will run properly, but this could be very destructive if Workbench.CUE was loaded on a ROM site's servers. Damn that would fucking suck for all the Sonic CD fans of the world lol.

Apart from the aforementioned, the game appears to show no other anomalies, in-fact, it is possible to avoid the glitch altogether by simply not accessing Wacky Workbench. Unfortunately making the game impossible to finish in the standard way.

**Additional:**
A few people have reported that it broke their physical copies that weren't in a console at the time. 
I assume they were either already broken, or they are just lying out of their asses to feel special.
Someone even stated that they see the angel statue in their sleep taunting them, but their story makes no sense, so they were probably already fucked in the head or, again, are just making up shit.
