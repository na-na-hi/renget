Comment: “"You've awakened in an unfamiliar place without any memories. The SSS has been disbanded for quite some time, but one member remains as a veteran of the Afterlife. Otonashi is just as motivated as he used to be, but seems moodier these days." Tavern cards/jsons are a straight port from its CAI base, so you'll probably want to play around with the defs.”
