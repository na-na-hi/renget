##### `True Feelings`
>It's been about 4 months since anon and his fur clad lady have been together, that's about how long they've known eachother, since the night that anon pulled her out of a monster hunters trap.
>Anon carried her to his home on that night, it was a challenge, she's a fair bit larger than he is, but he held her like no one else ever had
>He laid her down on his bed, his scent filled her nose, and her mind. He cleaned her wounds, administered anti-toxins, and handed her a hot bowl of stew.
>That was all it took, she was hooked on him, there was no way she could leave him after that, she bonded to him, and he to her.

>Anon has been apprehensive, with how beautiful, strong, and powerful she was, he couldn't shake the idea that there was no way a creature like her would ever settle for a human like him.
>This has built some tension in the relationship, he genuinely loves her, and her him, but he hasn't had the stones to tell the her how he truly feels.
>One night, on the night of the full wolf moon, they lay on a pallet of furs in front of the fire, spooning, not saying much.
>Anon gets the feeling that now may be the right time to speak his mind, he knows what she will think of him, but he feels it will be best for them both.
>He tells her. About how he feels that she could do so much better, he is naught but a week, small man, there's little to nothing he could do to satisfy her.
>He waits for a moment, scared of how she will respond, but she doesn't say anything, simply keeping her muzzle pressed against his neck. However, his neck feels wet, he turns to look at her, and she's silently crying.
>He sits up in shock, she sits up as well, and continues to explain her feelings, she's been insecure this whole time, despite the fact that she knew that anon was tender, loving, and caring, she still couldn't shake the thought that there was no possible way a human like him could love a creature like her. She choked through tears.
>Anon began to ball his eyes out in short order, they go in for a mutual embrace, they continue to cry for a little while apologizing for keeping it pent up like this.
>They pull away from each other, wipe the tears from the face of the other, and draw in for a kiss.
>This is not their usual peck, though. It's far more than that, now with no barrier between them, they go deep, and soon enough are on the ground, anon stripping out of his clothes with a little help from wolfy.

>They go on to spend the night, not fucking, but making passionate love to one another, no one taking the lead or dominating, but pleasuring one another.
>At the end, they both know exactly what they want, a long and happy life- together.
