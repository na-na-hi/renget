Extra : Saving Penthesilia Parley

"PENTHESILIA PARLEY IS DEAD" Flyers were plastered all over the school and in the House boards. The perpetrator, Amelia Tilmann, had proudly distributed pictures of her holding the Prefect Election winner's severed head the night before and the entire school was in turmoil; nobody could find the two girls and the school staff wouldn't give any answers when asked.

A group of students simply wouldn't have it, they were going to find Penthesilia, even if they had to bring her back from the dead.
Sitting in the Hog's Head, the group was having a heated conversation; bringing up things the late Prefect told them; looking for clues; throwing hypotheses.
Behind the counter, the barmaid was offering Tyrkish Peber vodka to a black and white picture of the girl, she was soon joined by another Slytherin student who offered Saltlakrits, the young man had lost the election, but Penthesilia had vowed to follow his program, the two of them had hoped to form a formidable pair, a dream taken from them by Amelia and a quite atrocious group of anonymous ballot-stuffing students.

The mood was gloomy around the Hog's Head, walking back towards the table, the young man slammed his fist on it, making his comrades jump in surprise, he exclaimed "We HAVE to bring her back! I don't care if we have to turn her into a vampire!"
"She wouldn't have wanted that! I'm sure we can find a way to bring her back, Amelia brought back Ava, I'm sure there's a way!" exclaimed the hopeful Bluebird
"Don't speak her name!" yelled the young man.
Spotting Margaret handing a bottle to the barmaid, the group waved wildly at her, the quiet girl walked towards the group, bowing a silent "Hello"
Known as The Detective she was sure to be of help, thought the group, they asked her opinion, beckoning her to sit down with them.

They sat in silence for a very long awkward minute, the Hog's Head was silent once more thanks to an enchanted apple, a note was stuck next to the head asking Niamh not to eat the fruit again.
The girl finally spoke up "Well...What is it?"
The whole group sighed in unisson, they thought she was thinking but she was waiting for them. Taking turns, the students explained the situation; Margaret then asked each of them their thoughts and ideas, quickly wiggling her fingers at the brown rat in James' pocket, offering it a bowl of nuts before nodding "I see..."
The white haired girl thought for a second before adding "I would recommend each of you to do what you think is best, in the meantime I will try my luck with the Unicorn Wand idea." she thought again "Could you bring me the flyers and the picture later? Let's meet again in the evening."

Loudly standing up, the whole group split in different directions, only Margaret and the rat were left in the now quiet tavern.
Walking back in the backroom with the rodent in her hand, the Gryffindor entered the storage area, allowing the rat to turn back into a Hufflepuff student.
Walking back into the room with a bottle of sake, Margaret spoke up "I thought about what they said, maybe a Unicorn will offer us its horn if we let it drink this."
In the meantime, followed by his faithful squire Adrian, James was running around the graveyard with a shovel, plastic fangs in his mouth and a large bag full of occult items sold to him by Alice; they were joined by Matthias, dramatically swishing his cape around and waving a shovel as he challenged them to a graverobbing competition, promising another Dark Arts lesson if they managed to beat him.
Evalyn Wong was flying towards the sun, reading a crudely drawn map sold to her by Alice, too, looking for the Heavens. She felt Penthesilia speaking to her, she asked for carrots and she was scared.
The merchant was sitting in the Room of Requirement, a large glass of Strawberry Smoothie sitting on Deek's head; her feet on the table as she counted bills, a large smile on her face, smoking a large cigar and laughing.

The (obviously) unsuccessful group met once again in the Hog's Head at night: James and Adrian covered in dirt, the two blushing boys looked like they weren't going to talk about what they had just done; Evalyn was badly sunburnt, looking like a clown with the white shape of her goggles on her face; For some reason, Margaret was wearing a hat, a scarf, mittens and a sweater, all handknitted, and My was holding a Unicorn horn with a price-tag still attached, the two of them smelled like sake and moss.

The group stood in silence, looking at each other, stifling a laugh while disappointed at the same time.
Behind them, singing loudly at the Karaoke Board was a masked blonde man, slightly inebriated, yelling at the top of his lungs "WOW BREAKING ZE LAW!", an enthusiastic Aumellia was clapping, waiting for her turn.
Gathering her courage, Margaret cleared her throat "How did it go?" her schoolmates were chuckling at her sight, she looked massive with the amount of clothes she was wearing.
Evalyn spoke up "I flew all day, high above the clouds but I couldn't find anything, I had to sell my shoes to buy this map!" she looked at the new Hufflepuff sitting next to her "I even asked Niamh to help me look." the obviously hungover Beater spoke up "I thought I saw her but then... Poof..." "Poof..." added Evalyn, "Poof..." added the other Evalyn, much to everyone's surprise, as they all thought she was Euphemia all along.
Margaret quietly whispered a joke to the girl next to her "Evalyn looks like a Chinese Fireball with that red nose...Oooooh.", taken by surprise, My spat her drink before running to the backroom, embarrassed.
"What about you, Margaret?" asked Adrian, the young boy looking like a raccoon with all the dirt covering his face.
The pale girl looked at the backroom, waiting for the Hufflepuff to come back; spotting the rat skittering back towards the group she spoke up "I remembered something I heard from her once, about Unicorns and Sake." she held out her hand the help the rat climb on the seat "The unicorn drank all of it but it didn't give us its horn, so we went to J. Pippins." she pointed at the horn on the table "I brought a feather from my parent's phoenix, too, but Mr. Ollivander told us it wouldn't work."
The group stared, mouth agape; James spoke up "...She said...For my sake, not sake." the inexpressive girl stared ahead "Oh."

"What about you, James?" asked Niamh, pointing at the dirty boys "Looks like you've been digging all day."
"Well, actually, that's none of your business, Niamh." answered James, bluntly. "No... we were looking for her tombstone and it was muddy... I tripped and grabbed James and..." Adrian waved towards the two of them before quickly glancing at Cora at the bar, remembering how she wiped his face clean while calling him a "reverse raccoon"; he blushed as she waved at him with a wide smile on her face, but quickly looked away when Matthias stared at him while raising his glass.
The door slammed loudly, Gloria entered the room in a hurry "Did you find anything?! I just heard about it!" James quickly gave a disapproving slap in the back of Adrian's head while everyone's attention was focused on the huffing and puffing Hufflepuff.

Standing up quietly, Margaret pointed at the menu, asking silently if anyone wanted a drink before leaving for the backroom. She came back out a few seconds later, still wearing the mass of knitted clothes, carefully moving, trying not to bump into anything or anyone, she approached Heather.
The barmaid chuckled at her sight "Here, the pictures and the flyers." she handed the paper to the large wooly shape in front of her, encumbered with bottles.
Drinks served and papers laid down on the table, the much larger group was now thinking and sipping, looking at the pictures, stifling laughter.
Even the two singers had joined them, it was sight straight from a classical painting. Only a sight; having spotted the free Karaoke Board, the drunk Ioni had left her dear friends Florana and Wine Bottle to sing loudly, her thick drunken accent amplified by her wand she almost screamed "ZE WIND IS POOSHING MEEEEEE!"
The beautiful, dramatic scene was interrupted by yet another loud entrance: Penthesilia Parley herself.

The entire Hog's Head fell silent, Euphemia held James tight, babbling about ghosts; the new Prefect spoke up "What are you all doing here? Why are you looking at me like that?" She approached the table full of staring, dumbfounded students "AH the flyers! I spent all morning tearing these down! I'm not dead! That's a fake picture! The tongue and the eyes are clearly drawn in!"
"YOU'RE ALIVE?!" yelled the whole group simultaneously, in surprise.
Behind the counter, a sneaky little merchant added a pair of badges to the "For Sale" display on the bar, cackling evilly as she caressed Mr Piggy.
The large group of students stared in silence before erupting in laughter.
