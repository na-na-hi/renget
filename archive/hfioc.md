**For three turns/encounter, if below half HP or *Enraged!* following taking a hit that deals up to 25% of your HP in a single turn, enter *Draco Trance* by letting the dragon within take the reigns, working together with your other half in a blitz of controlled fury. Skills listed will be rolled randomly.**

*Passive* - ***Combo Crazy!*** - Anon will both attack and use a skill once per turn. ***Skills used before and in DT will have their cooldown refreshed for use again by the time DT ends. Protracted engagements can use a single skill up to three times - once before DT, once during DT, once after DT.***
*Passive* - ***Blood Battery*** - Spell/Skill costs are reduced to half and take HP instead of MP to cast.
*Passive/Skill* - ***Scaled Surcoat*** - Gain 5DR during DT's duration. For 10HP, gain an additional 5DR that persists beyond DT's end.
*Passive* - ***Blazing Blade*** - The Soul Sealer does 1D30DMG instead of 1D20. The strange blue flames burn a bright orange instead.
*Passive* - ***Trance Heart*** - Regenerate a minimum of 5HP and MP/turn passively. Roll 1D5 to determine how much more, up to 10 a turn. 
*Passive* - ***Opportunist*** - If an opponent is *Stunned!*, get a free additional move per that turn. Flip a coin to determine if it's a 'Skill' or a regular attack. *Add one turn to DT's duration*. *Your heart pounds. The intoxicating adrenaline, the feeling of raw power...it's too much to let slip just yet.*
*Passive* - ***Limit Shatter*** - Landing a *Critical!* will automatically transition the attack into a **Virtuous Strike!!** at *six times damage*. Roll an additional effect naturally. *Show your foe just what you're made of.*
*Passive* - ***Trance Buster*** - Instead of entering Draco Trance or staying in Draco Trance, you may opt to end the ability early and deal 4D20 for every turn remaining and burst healing for 40HP/MAX MP. This leads to a maximum of 12D20 DMG if opting to avoid DT altogether in exchange for increased regeneration gains whilst still doing a good amount of damage. Enemy will be *Stunned!* guaranteed and also suffer *Burning!*, taking 10DMG/turn for the next three turns. Damage done by *TB* and *Burning!* both ignore DR. Bursting and passing over DT entirely will also allow you to immediately land a **Virtuous Strike!!** 
*Skill* - ***Round Trip*** - Upgraded form of *Round Raid*; Strike for 2D20 DMG twice by catching the sword and using its momentum to send it right back a second time.
*Skill* - ***Double Cross*** - Upgraded *Delta Cross.* Follow the cross slash with a 'plus' on top of it for 4 hits total. 4D15DMG.
*Skill* - ***Phantasm Overdrive*** - Upgraded *Mirage Dance*. Call forth two Draconic Reflections. In tandem, unleash a horrific attack upon the opponent, dealing 6D20 damage. **Does not render the broach dormant!** High chance to render the opponent *Stunned!* (60%)
*Skill* - ***Steelplate Surge*** - Upgraded *Barrier Raid*. Any attacks blocked will be reflected for *full damage!* Does not take additional MP/HP to block effectively.
*Skill* - ***Fatal Frame*** - Upgraded *Finalis Arcana*. Become as the wind beneath the dragon's wings. In the blink of an eye, deal 23D5 damage before making your opponent aware of the fact they were even attacked at all with a final blow dealing 1D25. High chance to render the opponent *Stunned!* (75%)
*Skill* - ***Ripper Claw*** - Claw attack. Rip an opponent's body, dealing 2D20DMG. Reduce target's DR by 5 permanently.
*Skill* - ***Mountain Breaker*** - Fist attack. Slam an opponent across the face with enough strength to crack a mountain in two. Deal 3D20DMG and render the opponent *Stunned!* (100%)
*Spell* - ***Blue Breath*** - An attack worthy of a dragon. Ranged attack - deal 2D20DMG and render a target *Burning!*. 10HP cost.
*Spell* - ***Beryl Burst*** - Upgraded *Summoned Swords*. Roll 2D20. The result will be manifested as full-sized long swords as opposed to short swords. The opponent will need to dodge using rolls to match the amount of swords rolled in a 1D10 v 1D10 system. Every sword that connects deals 10DMG. If more than five connect, render the opponent *Stunned!* (100%)
*Spell* - ***Eschaton*** - Upgraded *Mana Crash*. Bring yourself to the very brink of death to smite an opponent utterly. Drop HP and MP to 1. For every point of each deducted, add 20DMG flat to a 4D20 Roll. Rolling a *Critical!* will increase the damage to 30/point+4D20. If the target survives, somehow, they will be *Stunned!* for two turns and suffer *Soul Burn*. Cannot be overchanneled, and can only be used if knocked below half health while in DT.
