##->Improvements/Hacks<-
->Copypasted from the original link and smoothed with rentry's code. Credits to the original anon that compiled this list. Slightly edited by Soniafag<-
!!! note IMPROVEMENT PATCHES/HACKS
	The following is a list of all patches and hacks that are considered "improvements" to the original games while not radically changing the game as a typical romhack would. I've written "HIGHLY recommended" on the hacks I can't live without anymore as they drastically improve the experience and fix a major flaw with the original game. Also, Purasabe's hacks are all found on the same page if you just want to look at them all at once but the page is in Japanese so be ready to use google translate: http://borokobo.web.fc2.com/ All of his hacks will also be listed below and they are generally very well made, as you'd expect from the guy who made Minus Infinity.

>https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4773/
