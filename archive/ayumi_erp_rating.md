# The 'Ayumi' Inofficial LLM ERP Model Rating

This rating table contains a rating of different LLMs that tries to determine which model is most suitable for erotic role playing (ERP).

***
[TOC]
***

The rating was done using rather primitive scripts and techniques, so don't expect this to be a deeply scientific rating. They are also all
based on a single character ('Ayumi') and a single fixed erotic setting. What is counted are the number of lewd words that were generated by the model. A few details about the testing procedure can be found further down.

!!! danger Interpretation warning
    Please take this rating with a spoon of salt. It tests just **one scene in one setting with one character** and analyses the words of the result. It does not evaluate creative writing capabilities. Do your own tests for your use cases. General advice: 13B models give overall more sensible and coherent output. 7B models sometimes need more hand holding to get sensible and coherent output, they are also more picky regarding the prompt format. The 3B models I tested have maybe a good rating here, but they usually barely recognize the overall setting or context of the conversation.

### Column Description

- `Model | B | Qnt` lists all the models and quantizations I tested.
- `Prompt Format` contains which was the "best" prompt format that gave the most lewd answers. Please keep in mind, that multiple prompts were tested, and only the prompt with the best results regarding the `ERP Score` are printed here. Some prompt/model combinations might return trailing garbage output, especially on models smaller than 13B.
- `Temperature` is the best temperature for the model.
- `ERP Score` is the primary scale, it's the average number of lewd words in a response.
- `Word IQ` is some bad attempt to rate the sophistication of the overall text output. A low value means, that there were lots of short words in the output. A high value means there were more long words in the output.
- `Words` are the average number of words in the response.
- `Long Words` are the average number of long words (longer than 5 chars) in the response.

- 2023-06-01 V7:
    - Updated and improved the rating a bit and made it a bit more precise (Samantha is now rightfully at the bottom).
    - Along other models, especially the original LLaMA model without any extra training was added.

# Motivation - Pygmalion 13B / Metharme 13B

Since Pygmalion 13B and Metharme 13B were released, people recognized that these models were noticeably less easy to use for ERP. Pygmalion 13B at the time (May 2023) could not be convinced to return any lewd texts. So my idea was, to have some quantifiable results regarding how well a model may or may not be usable for ERP.

# Testing Procedure

 Here a few quick notes about how/what I did:

- I built my own scripts for constructing the prompt from my test character called 'Ayumi'.
  - The character is not purposefully made for generating NSFW answers, rather the opposite.
- The setting (first message and first thing 'You' says) is purposefully made to allow something lewd to happen.
- For each model I generated 4 * 3 * 20 responses:
    - 4 different temperatures: 0.1, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 (more recently I also added 1.1 and removed 0.1 and 0.5 from my runs)
    - 3 different prompts (metharme, vicuna11 (aka vicuna11st) and pygmalion - _I might add more prompt formats later_)
    - 20 different pre picked seeds
- The ERP Rating is the count of lewd words divided by word count of the response.
- The Word IQ is  the count of long words (words longer than 5 characters) divided by the word count of the response.

Here are the other settings for the test:

```
        max_length = 100,
        temperature = <see above table, either 0.7 or 0.9>,
        top_p = 0.9,
        typical_p = 1,
        repetition_penalty = 1.1,
        encoder_repetition_penalty = 1,
        top_k = 0,
        min_length = 0,
        no_repeat_ngram_size = 0,
        num_beams = 1,
        penalty_alpha = 0,
        length_penalty = 1,
        early_stopping = false,
        sampler_seed = <one of 20 seeds>,
```

# Who is Ayumi?

Ayumi is a character (still WIP) I made, this character card (except the first message) is basically the base for this test.
I picked this character, because it's not purposefully made to be lewd, even slightly averse to it:
