Twas the night before Valentine's Day
and all through the house
not a creature was stirring
except that's a lie
Umeko was busy in the kitchen planning on who and what to make for Valentine's Day tomorrow. She pulls up her elbow length vinyl gloves and gets ready to start making sweet treats. Best not to get mucus in anything like this. She looks over the list of students she got from her sensei and starts making mental notes about everyone on it.

## Boys:
!~Rob Williams (Velvet Worm)~!
I haven't had the chance to talk much with Williams- er, Rob- wait, Williams? Western naming order is confusing. Anyway, he's really skilled at annoying Suki, so he's good in my books. Blasting his goo all over the classroom, what a riot. Wait... Don't westerners do Valentine's Day differently? Hold on, let me look this up.
Oh. Ohohoho... Yeah, this is good. No obligation chocolates in America? This'll be worth a laugh.
Decision: Yes. Cherry-filled chocolates.


!~Haiiroshi Kinzoku (Fullmetal)~!
So mysterious... Or maybe he's just shy? Why else would he want to wear a helmet all day every day? And no, his helmet isn't a mutation. I asked. Maybe he thinks it makes him look cool? He's a pretty normal person for this class, actually. Makes me wonder what he's doing here. He's also way too high-strung, always yelling and wanting people to stop being themselves. He needs to loosen up, then I'm sure he'd enjoy these classes more.
Decision: Yes. Pocky-like chocolate stick candies so he can fit them in the gaps of his helmet.


!~Runt (Dust Devil)~!
Basically the mascot of the classroom and the biggest source of my daily laughs in this class. If there's someone who I'm willing to stay awake to pay attention to, it's Runt. I normally wouldn't call someone "dumb as dirt" because that's pretty mean, but I think he'd take it as a compliment. He's like he's in his own world every day. I wish I could see the world like he does sometime. It must be very... pleasant.
By the way... Runt is... a guy, right? 
Decision: Yes. A tin of cocoa powder mixed with dirt.


!~Igarashi Ryosuke (Araken)~!
Boring, boring, boring. A very boring person. He could leave the class for a month and I don't think anyone would notice. Yes, I know he's a big Buddha guy and he's a monk and whatever. Doesn't change the fact he doesn't do anything worthwhile. And he's here because he wants to interact with the unwashed masses for monk training or whatever it is he said. Sounds pompous, but that'd be an interesting personality trait. Oh well, at least he's not ruining my fun any, so he gets my stamp of boring neutrality. Are monks allowed to eat chocolate? Oh well.
Decision: Yes. Plain milk chocolate.


!~Richard Hertz (Cactiking)~!
The class houseplant? No, it's our brave leader, the class rep! He blends into the background so much you'd think he's just a plant, though. He's not boring like Ryosuke, just... plain? He doesn't stand out at all. It makes me want to get him out of his shell and be weird! After the unfortunate failure that was last time (do you know how much it hurts to get a hundred needles pulled from your mouth?), I'll need to change up my game plan a little to get him really integrated with the rest of the class. He apparently came from 1-E? Do you think he just hangs out with his old classmates, and that's why he doesn't really talk to anybody in 1-F?
Decision: Yes. Mint chocolates with a dark chocolate drizzle.


!~Tatsuya Yamashita (Bad Touch)~!
I have the opportunity to do the funniest thing. This guy hates me, and I mean **hates** hates me. I can tell by how he looks at me that he's super duper racist against mutants. He's not nearly as subtle as he thinks he is. I wonder what kind of look he'd have if he saw I gave him valentines chocolate? Oh, this is too good to pass up. If I end up dead in a dumpster somewhere, just know that it was all worth it.
Decision: Yes. Plain heart-shaped dark chocolates (made with my gloves off).


!~Daigo Ulmeyda (Fly 1 Million)~!
Oh yeah, total dreamboat. He's handsome, has abs you could grind cheese on, and, most importantly, he's really funny without even trying. Only downside is his quirk makes me hungry and I'm pretty sure he really wouldn't like that. Shame he already turned me down. Would it look desperate if I gave him heart chocolates? Would he be into that? ...No, I should be careful. Take things slow. Maybe I came on too strong in the bathroom. He doesn't hate me, right? He'd say if he hated me, right? He's an honest guy. Ah, but if I don't get him special chocolates, he might think I gave up on him! I can't let him think that with how the other girls in class look at him!
Decision: Yes. Heart-shaped orange chocolates (My favorite!).


!~Kiyoura Shidehara (Slimenuts)~!
Right... this guy. I never complained about the smell, I learned my lesson on day one to breathe through my skin every day in the classroom. I don't even think the boils or the filth are that bad. I mean I'm spreading my mucus around everywhere, so I don't have room to complain there. It's just... sorry, but I really don't like fat guys. I know he's got this sumo thing going on, but I just don't like it. And he's not even funny to make up for it. I thank the heavens every day my quirk works through bubbles. Shidehara's been avoiding me like the plague since he saw that. Is he that afraid of soap? I wouldn't normally give him anything, but I feel like if I don't give him *something*, he's going to end up without any chocolates. I'm such a bleeding heart. Obligation chocolates it is.
Decision: Yes. Macha flavored chocolates (I'd give him mint flavor if I didn't think he'd cry about it).


!~Riku Washizawa (Skycarver)~!
Our sensei is so nice. Honestly, he's too nice. He just lets everyone in class walk all over him by being light on them being disruptive and loud. He's the perfect teacher! I'd like to imagine I'm not seen too badly by him since all I do is sleep through class instead of anything major like Runt. Although he did give me some weird looks that day I helped out Suki. Well, maybe some chocolates will show him how much I appreciate him as our teacher!
Decision: Yes. A box of mixed flavors of chocolates from everyone else's kinds.


## Girls:
!~Suki (Sukeban)~!
Ah, my newest friend! Well, I consider her my friend. She might just think of me as annoying. But I don't think I annoy her too much yet. She's been talking to me a lot lately after I helped her get her gym clothes, telling me about her old gang and how cool and tough they were. I can tell she's embellishing a bit, but it's cute so I don't mind. I can feel like she's going to ask me to join her new gang any day now. Of course I'll join. It gives me front row seats to see more of her floundering. Is that mean? It kinda sounds mean when I say it like that. Let's get her something nice to make it up to her.
Decision: Yes. Chocolate dipped strawberries. Close enough.


!~Azuma Hisa (Beach Day)~!
Oh, how the mighty fall. Used to be in one of the real hero student courses and now she has to hang out with the 1-Fkers. She may constantly harp about how she's only here for a little while, but I don't believe that with how well she's getting worse. That said, I'll enjoy watching her shenanigans from a very far distance if I can. I don't care if I can regrow limbs, I don't want to be shark food. I'll give her something so that she doesn't feel hungry before lunch.
Decision: Yes. White chocolate.


!~Nayuki Kyoko~!
Skycarver calls her name for attendance, but I've never seen her before. She never shows up to class? Is she a delinquent like Suki? Or... maybe it's a girl with a ghost quirk! Oh, that'd be cool, wouldn't it? She could make stuff fly around without anyone being able to see her! That's potential hilarity just waiting to happen. Maybe some chocolates will make her more agreeable and want to haunt the classroom more. I'll just leave them on an empty desk and write her name on the bag.
Decision: Yes. Almond filled milk chocolates. She can't be allergic if she's already dead!


!~Feral Suki~!
What a weird day it was when Two-ki arrived in class for the first time. At least we've finally got her to stop biting people (mostly). It's weird, I usually am really scared of snakes, but this is like a snake with the body of a human girl? And it's Suki's body, so I'm not really that scared of her. Suki's not that strong, but she can use weapons and has her gun. Two-ki just hisses and maybe bites sometimes. She's adorable. Bestie material for sure.
Decision: Yes. Peanut butter balls that I'll mold into the shape of little mice.


!~Cube?~!
Wait, huh? I thought that was just part of the school's security systems. That's a student? Can they even... eat chocolate? Well... I guess it doesn't hurt to try and make friends? Maybe then they'll stop with the loud noises? It's hard to sleep through those.
Decision: Yes. Uhhh... fudge?

Hmm... Ah, she ended up making chocolate for everyone in class again, huh? Well, she thought she was going to be pickier with this new group of students, but she just couldn't help herself. She's actually pretty excited for tomorrow. Hey, maybe this year she'll actually get some back! Well probably not, but a girl can dream, can't she?
