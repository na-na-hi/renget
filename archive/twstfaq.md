##- FAQ

**1. What is this game?**
Twisted-Wonderland is a Japanese mobile game created by Aniplex and Walt Disney Japan. The character designs, scenario, and concept were designed by Black Butler creator Yana Toboso, focusing on depictions of villains from various Disney franchises. The game was released on Android and iOS in Japan on March 18, 2020. 

**2. Is there a global release?**
No. JP-only as of now.

**3. How do I download the game?**
Google search "Qooapp" and install Qooapp from its site. Once installed, search for the game's name in the app and install it from there. Alternatively, just google the apk.

**4. Does the game work on Emulators?**
Yes, but only on Nox. 

**5. Can I still play this game even with little to no knowledge of japanese?**
Yes, absolutely. There's translations and guides for everything this game has to offer, new events get translated pretty fast as well. The ingame UI also has english on its menus, which makes it very easy to traverse the game.

**6. Is this a casual or hardcore game?**
It's a rather casual card collecting game, it isn't a grind heavy game but does need a little bit of time investment if you want to get anywhere. The game also has auto-battle and loop-auto for lessons which you can just leave on while you do other things. 

**7. Is rerolling easy? Who do I reroll for?**
The tutorial 10 roll lets you reroll as many times as you'd like until you get the SSR unit of your choice, be noted that the SSR pool for the tutorial 10 roll is fixed and you can only roll SSR units of Heartslabyul and Savanaclaw characters. 
Reroll for whoever you like best, but if you still would rather aim for good SSRs or a good comp then refer to the Beginner Startup Card link from the Translations & Guides section.

**8. Who should I pick from the initial free SR?**
Again, whoever you like best.

**9. I'm playing the game but I don't know what to do!**
- Advance in Main Story as much as you can
- If gated, spam History lessons (they give raw EXP and EXP items to level your units) 
- Once you get a team at decent levels, grind Alchemy lessons (for Magic Lvl mats, Magic lvls are arguably more important than Unit Level for overall progression) 
. Do your daily Tests, any difficulty is fine. 
For more information and guidance, refer to the Game Guidebook under the Translations & Guides section.

**10. What about the gacha currency?**
You get free gems by logging in, clearing battles/rhythm games on main story and doing missions. You can also get "keys" which are the equivalent of a single pull ticket.
When rolling the gacha, F2P and Paid gems are not separate and combine to complete the roll. The gems given by the monthly pass are counted as F2P. 
For more information and tips on the average gain, refer to the Average Gem Gain pastebin under the Translations & Guides section.

**11. Should I play this game?**
/shrugs
If you want an okay time waster with pretty boys in it.
