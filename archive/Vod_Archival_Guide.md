##About this Guide
The main reason i made this guide was to help people out that wanted to archive Vtuber vods but didnt know how to do so and there was no easily understanble guide for Twitch so i took it into my own hads and made it myself, be aware this guide is longer then it needs to be, but i tried to include everything i could think of into it and tried to keep it as simple as possible so anyone could understand it even without any knowledge about this stuff or knowing the proper terms for things. I teached myself everything by asking google about stuff, but that took a while so i thought something like this would be helpfull to anyone wanted to get into Vod Archival/wanted to archive vods by themselves.
