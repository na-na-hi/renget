##About this Guide
The goal of this guide used to be to help people who wanted to archive VoDs but didn't know how. It's lengthy, but I tried to include all the information that I could think of to make it as comprehensive and easy-to-understand as possible. The goal was to make something that anyone, even those with no knowledge about video archiving or the proper terms, could understand. I learned everything myself through Google, but I thought this guide would be helpful to anyone who wanted to archive VoDs.
