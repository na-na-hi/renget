##About this Guide
The main reason i made this guide was to help people out that wanted to archive Vtuber vods but didnt know how to do so and there was no easily understanble guide for Twitch so i took it into my own hads and made it myself, be aware this guide is longer then it needs to be, but i tried to include everything i could think of into it and tried to keep it as simple as possible so anyone could understand it even without any knowledge about this stuff or knowing the proper terms for things. I teached myself everything by asking google about stuff, but that took a while so i thought something like this would be helpfull to anyone wanted to get into Vod Archival/wanted to archive vods by themselves.

#How to recover .m3u8 Links
If you want to know how to recover m3u8 links yourself check the ["Twitch Recover"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MR48duo8FmpUIVGPvDRzBd3y5HnalrF1wmiS9fO99N4/edit#heading=h.1qvahu8r217s) and ["Vod Recovery"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MR48duo8FmpUIVGPvDRzBd3y5HnalrF1wmiS9fO99N4/edit#heading=h.fe5nra9ntjhd) Sections in the Vod Archival Guide linked above.

##How to recover .m3u8 links using a website

Alternatively you can use [vodvod.top](https://vodvod.top) to recover the m3u8 link to unlisted vods (its obviously cant recover deleted vods). Example of the website here: ![Screenshot](https://files.catbox.moe/gifxie.jpg)
Simply type in the channels name and click on the link, if its grayed out, it means either the vod got deleted or the stream is still online.
