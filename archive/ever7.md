The alarm on Paul's phone went off. He raised up a hand to blindly grab it and managed on the third try. It was seven-thirty a.m. on a Friday morning. His werewolf boyfriend, Luke, was just starting to wake up next to him. Paul sat up and raised a hand to block the light coming from his window. Luke sat up and turned to face him with his eyes closed and his ears perked up. He gave him a weak smile and rubbed a massive paw over his face, and slid under the covers. Paul put the alarm on snooze, then closed his eyes again, not ready to get out of bed.

Paul felt him sliding down his boxers and before he could even protest, Luke growled. He looked over at his phone again. Ten minutes passed, he still had time to get to work if he rushed, he wiggled his hips to try and get up but that only made Luke press down on him more. More aroused than scared, he spoke up, "Hey, I really need to-" he stopped when he felt Luke partially lay down on him and start sniffing his dick. 

He was trapped. 

He lifted up the covers and saw Luke's massive yellow eyes looking back at him while he kept sniffing his dick. Wanting to persuade him to let him go, he maintained eye contact. He tried to throw the covers back down but it was too late. In his drowsy state, Paul forgot that making eye contact with Luke when he got like this was always a bad idea. Over the months Paul took to get to know Luke, he learned quite a few things about the six foot five tall werewolf. Prolonged eye contact from strangers made him defensive and caused his anger flare up in ways he still didn't understand. 

Sometimes, eye contact made him angry.
Sometimes, it calmed him down.
But when Luke was sexually frustrated, he saw it as a challenge. Like he was being denied something, and Paul just made a dangerous amount of eye-contact.  

He watched a grin spread across Luke's face. Rows of sharp teeth filled his mouth. His ears folded back  and his nostrils flared, drowning his senses in his Human's scent while his mind went blank, and what little restraint he had vanished. 

Paul tried to move, and was pushed back down. Luke glared at him from underneath the sheets, and started licking his dick. He used long, slow strokes as if he was making a point, and then sped up, getting as much spit on Paul's dick as possible. He used this as a moment to show off his tongue skills. His wide, flat tongue was surprisingly dextrous. The werewolf somehow managed to slobber on Paul's balls, drag his tongue up, and then deepthroat him effortlessly with his tongue out. Paul didn't even know it was possible to be deepthroated and have his balls licked at the same time, but he certainly was going to make the werewolf do this again in the future. Luke slowed down his pace, slurping and kissing Paul's dick with barely contained restraint. By the time he was finished, Luke's spit was dripping down his thighs and pooling underneath him. 

Luke pushed himself up and looked down at Paul again, drooling. He wiped some spit away from his mouth and sat up fully. The brown coat of fur did almost nothing to hide the powerful veins running up the werewolf's arms or defined muscles. The almost black fur running down his midsection coated his entire belly and some of his chest. The muscles in his neck strained slightly when he tilted his head. If Paul wasn't pinned down, he would have reached up and started fondling Luke's firm pecs. He would have traced his fingers all over his chest and abs before seeing how much nipple play he could take before he started fidgeting and blushing.  

Paul noticed Luke's eyes widen while he sat up and repositioned himself so he was straddling Paul. Luke's heavy balls rested lightly on his stomach, he saw them twitch slightly while precum shot out the tip of Luke's red dick. His powerful thighs rested on both sides of the human underneath him, while his tail slammed into the bed underneath him, eager to continue. He took a few deep breaths to try and calm himself but only made himself look more cock-hungry when he started panting to catch his breath. 

Remembering the eye contact from earlier, Paul forced himself to look away and saw his cell phone. Only ten minutes had passed. If he skipped breakfast and had a quick shower, there was still a chance he could get to work on time-

Luke leaned forward, pushing more of his weight on Paul. He put both of his hands on either side of Paul, looming over him. He gently used one claw to turn Paul's face back to him, forcing him to make eye contact again. Paul opened his mouth to protest, and stopped when Luke bent forward and jammed his tongue in. He started struggling under Luke, which only got him more aroused. Half of his wrist-thick dick slid out of his sheathe and Paul was instantly grateful that Luke was a bottom. It pulsed and throbbed while he bucked his hips on top of Paul, he even felt the warmth from it on his lower stomach. 

More precum shot out of Luke's now flared tip. A vein throbbed while he grit his teeth and grunted, this time landing on the pillow underneath his human. He instinctively raised his arms and put his hands behind his back, flexing and showing off at the same time. Paul couldn't help but look up at him this time. Luke looked down at him, licked his lips and winked.   

Paul's cell phone rang. With Paul still pinned down, Luke grabbed it and held it between three fingers. 

Luke got real close to Paul's face, then spoke up, "Tell your boss you're not coming to work today", and answered the phone call.

Paul reached up and tapped the speaker icon. 

A voice on the other line spoke up, "Hey, Paul, Hello?".
Paul froze. He didn't know what to say. Luke grabbed Paul's dick, slid it between his ass cheeks, and arched his back. 

Luke smirked down at him, and started bucking his hips. Five inches of his dick slapped against Paul's stomach, loudly. 

Paul gasped, then blurted out, "Hey I don't feel so good, I-I can't make it in today"
A few seconds passed, then he pretended to cough.

The voice spoke up again, with a little concern, "Yeah uh, that's okay, just try to get some rest or something, alright? See you next week". 

The call ended. 

Luke leaned forward and whispered, "Good boy".
He sat back up, and angled Paul's dick inside him. The first half went in with no effort, so Luke waited a few seconds, then sat on the rest of it, then looked down at Paul with his arms folded across his chest. He wiggled his hips for good measure, and found just the right angle. 

Paul looked up at him, blushing madly at the fact that he got straddled by his bf while on the phone just moments ago. So risky, but so hot. His thoughts were jolted away from him when he felt Luke start bouncing on his dick. Luke kept at that pace for a while. Sometimes stopping entirely to keep Paul from busting too early. He let his dick slide out with a small pop, then looked down at his own member and gave it a few strokes, coaxing it out entirely and letting more precum drip on Paul's stomach. 

Paul started to buck his hips in desperation, only for Luke to take a moment and tease him by rubbing more precum out of his fat, knotted cock and shoving a precum soaked finger in his mouth. Paul sucked on it eagerly for a few moments, then Luke sat on his dick again, forcing both of them to grunt. Sweat was starting to drip off Luke's body. He sat on Paul's dick fully and paused for a moment  to remind himself to force Luke to lick it off him later, then continued. Luke's fat cock loudly slapped on Paul's stomach as he continued, pulling up fat strings of precum with every bounce. 

Luke started grunting louder. He started putting more and more weight on Paul every time he sat on his dick. He finally got adjusted to Paul's size and felt more comfortable speeding up. He kept going, slamming down harder and harder, making sure not to actually Hurt Paul in the process. His tail curled up while he got off Paul's dick and squatted above it, dangerously close to his own orgasm. His fat cock was starting to turn into a darker shade of red, his soft-ball sized knot was almost swollen to it's full size, more sensitive than ever. Luke paused to try and collect himself. He was panting and drenched in sweat, surprised at how pent up he was. He partially stood up, then sat on Paul's dick in a squatting motion, gasping when it angled towards his prostate and forced precum to pour out of him for a few seconds. 

He repeated the motion, partially squatting on Paul's dick as fast as he could for another minute before sitting down on it entirely and grinding his ass into Paul's hips, forcing himself to cum hands free. He clenched down on Paul's dick hard while he came, shooting four massive ropes of cum that landed in Paul's hair while the rest drenched his face, neck, and chest. The intensity caused Luke to move his hands away from Paul for just a second, so Paul reached up and squeezed his knot, forcing him to whimper and tense up again while he shot out another three ropes of jizz that pooled up on Paul's stomach and dripped onto the bed. 

Watching Luke cum that hard was enough to send Paul over the edge and cum inside the sweaty, exhausted werewolf. He bucked his hips uselessly while Luke clenched down on him, milking his dick for every last drop before letting it slide out with a loud, wet pop. He scooped some of his own load off of Paul's stomach and made him lick it off his fingers, something he knew Paul couldn't resist. 

He licked his lips, then got off of Paul and sat on the bed, and grinned at Paul before speaking up, "I'm glad I talked you out of going into work, Paul", he paused to adjust himself, then continued, "Because now I can have my way with you all day." 

Luke pulled Paul into a messy kiss and hugged him, thrilled that he could spend the rest of the day with him. Paul broke off the kiss and nuzzled Luke's neck before tapping him on the back to get out. He took a quick shower, then went to the kitchen only to find Luke had started making a pot of coffee and was getting ready to cook both of them breakfast. Paul walked up to him and hugged him from behind, then slapped his ass. Luke turned around to look at him, growled, winked at Paul, then continued cooking.

"You're gonna pay for that later" he said while pouring some coffee into two mugs.
Paul laughed, then responded with "Good" before grabbing one of the mugs and sipping on his coffee.
