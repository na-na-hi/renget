#Team Moonshine: Troubled Sleep 2
Team Moonshine set up camp shortly before arriving at the Power Plant. The plan was to have everyone rested up before entering the dungeon so they would all be at peak performance, as they had no idea what kind of pokemon they’d be fighting beyond “robots”. Vileplume woke up in the afternoon much earlier than everyone else, so he started cooking a cheri berry curry for breakfast. As he was finishing up the stew, Enny and Bellossom woke up.
“What’s the good smell?” Enny yawned.

“Ooh! Breakfast!” Bellossom chimed.

“I figured cheri berries would help prevent any severe paralysis we might get,” Vileplume said while pouring out the stew into bowls.

Enny picked up a bowl and licked up a mouthful of the stew before spitting it out instantly. “HOLY FUCK, THAT’S SPICY!” He exclaimed.

“Oh, calm down, it’s not that spicy,” Bellossom said as she started eating the stew.

“I HATE spicy food!” Enny complained.

“Well, Cheri berries are naturally spicy,” Vileplume noted, grabbing his own bowl. “If you don’t want any, you can grab one of the apples. Just make sure you don’t get paralyzed in the dungeon, or we’ll have to force a cheri berry down your throat.”

“If I get paralyzed, just leave me behind!” Enny proclaimed in a high-pitched voice.

“Alright, man. Whatever you say,” Vileplume chuckled. “You wanna trade me your berries for my seeds then?”

“Definitely! I don’t want any of these nasty berries near me!” Enny said while pulling an apple out of his satchel. He used another ribbon to toss his bag of berries towards Vileplume’s satchel. He then took a seat and started eating his apple.

The group ate silently for a while until Bellossom finished her bowl. She looked over at Adrian. He was the only one who hadn’t woken up, still sleeping by the pine tree he laid by the night prior. He was starting to stir and mumble, as he’d been doing at the guild lately, catching her attention.

“Guys, he’s doing it again,” Bellossom whispered.

Vileplume and Enny looked over to watch Adrian. Everyone had stopped eating, not really sure what to do until Enny got an idea. He got closer to him, wrapped one of his ribbons around Adrian’s foreleg, and closed his eyes. Enny had heard that sylveons could read people’s emotions through their ribbons, but he’d never actually done it before.

“He’s feeling… negative,” Enny muttered.

“What does that mean?” Vileplume asked quietly.

“I don’t know. I’m not very good at this!” Enny whispered sharply. He wrapped another ribbon around Adrian’s leg, tightening his grip slightly. “It’s definitely not anger, which is kind of surprising… It feels bad, though.”

“He must be having a nightmare,” Bellossom whispered back.

Enny closed his eyes tighter, really trying to focus on reading the emotions. “I’m… not really sure what it is exactly. It feels kind of… purple?”

“Okay, now what does that mean?” Vileplume asked.

“It’s just the feeling I’m getting. This stuff is weird,” Enny said. “Wait, it’s changing! It’s getting redder!”

“E-Enny…” Bellossom stuttered.

“I think he’s getting angry, but I’m not sure why,” Enny explained.

Enny started to hear the sound of growling, causing his ears to twitch.

“Yeah, he’s definitely pissed off right now,” Enny said.

“You don’t need your ribbons to figure that out,” Vileplume said, no longer whispering.

Enny, confused by what he meant, opened his eyes. Right in front of him was Adrian’s face, eyes wide open and shooting daggers into him. 

“Oh… good morning, Adrian!” Enny giggled nervously while gently unwrapping his ribbons.

“You do this shit again, and I’ll tear your ribbons off,” Adrian snarled.

Enny backed up slowly as Adrian slowly picked himself up. His eyelids were low, and he had visible bags under his eyes. He slowly walked towards the last bowl of curry, picking it up with Psychic and scarfing it down.

“Um… Adrian?” Bellossom asked as she approached him.

“What?” Adrian snapped suddenly.

“Ah,” She recoiled. “A-are you feeling okay?”

“Swear to fucking god, I keep telling you! I’m fine! I have no idea what you guys are so goddamn scared of!” Adrian roared.

Bellossom backed away, tears building up in her eyes. Vileplume grabbed his sister and looked at Adrian. “Dude, you’re not fine,” he stated bluntly. “You’re starting fights at the guild, you’re talking in your sleep, and you’re yelling at us.”

“Yeah, I don’t like you guys prying into my life and asking how I’m feeling,” Adrian sneered.

“Well, forgive us, but we kind of have to!” Vileplume shouted, causing his sister to cry and grip him tightly. “You’re our leader, and if you have a psychotic breakdown in the middle of a job, we’re kind of on our own!”

“You’re treating me like I’m fucking crazy,” Adrian argued.

“Well, you kind of have been lately! You’ve assaulted two people in the guild already!”

“Those freaks need to learn a thing or two about boundaries,” Adrian said. “Besides, the first faggot clearly enjoyed it. His face was red as a fucking tomato.”

“Dammit, Adrian, can you not see how messed up that reasoning is?” Vileplume asked.

“Everything I’m doing, I at least have a reason behind it. I don’t see any issue with that,” Adrian answered.

Vileplume fumed with anger. He stepped away from his sister and over to his cooking supplies. The group started packing up their stuff without saying a word to each other. When they set off towards the dungeon, Vileplume let Bellossom go ahead of him, not wanting to be near Adrian after their fight.

Team Moonshine quickly arrived at the Power Plant. The building before them was surrounded by a massive wall of concrete and overgrown shrubbery. A tall spire could be seen behind the walls, along with a turbine of some kind. The group entered the building before them, being led by the weary umbreon.

As they stepped inside, Vileplume and Bellossom marveled at the interior. It appeared to them as a mass of powerful technology with unseen potential. They could only dream of what purposes all the devices served for this building. To Adrian and Enny, however, it was nothing more than a mess of crossed wires and devices haphazardly slammed together and twisted by the essence of the dungeon. Whatever purpose these machines had served was clearly ruined.

The group delved deeper and deeper into the Power Plant. The electronics grew more rusted and the walls grew stained, with chunks occasionally opening up, revealing the support beams underneath. They would occasionally be ambushed by feral pokemon of the dungeon. Thankfully, the only person among them with a weakness to the locals was Enny with the steel types. 

Vileplume and Bellossom were actually resistant to the electric types, so they attempted to draw most of the attention onto themselves. Adrian, however, wasn’t helping them with this plan. Any time he saw a wild pokemon, he would rush them at with little regard for his own safety. This only made Bellossom more worried, and Vileplume more annoyed.

“Adrian, you need to quit doing this! You’re just getting yourself hurt!” Vileplume complained as he stepped over a destroyed magneton and towards a wounded Adrian.

“I don’t care about the damage. I can take it,” Adrian growled. 

“Well, you’re burning through your oran berries. How many do you have left?” Vileplume asked.

“Just this one,” Adrian said as he lifted his last oran berry out of his pouch with Psychic.

“Are you serious?!” Vileplume yelled. “You used most of our cheri berries, and you’re out of oran berries? Adrian, what the actual fuck are you doing?”

“It’s not that bad, calm the fuck down!” Adrian yelled back. “The gang of robots can’t be that far from us at this point.”

“How do you figure that?” Vileplume asked rhetorically. “We’ve been walking around the same corridors with all this human technology, and we’ve found nothing!”

“I fucking feel it. We’ve been here for a long time, we gotta be getting-”

“Guys, look out!” Enny shouted suddenly.

While the two were arguing, an electivire had snuck up on them. It shot off a bolt of electricity towards Vileplume. Adrian quickly shoved him out of the way and took the attack. He muscles stiffened, and he fell to the floor, paralyzed. The oran berry he was holding dropped beside him.

“Goddammit, Adrian!” Vileplume yelled before he started to fight.

Bellossom joined her brother as he battled the feral pokemon. Enny dug through his satchel for anything that could be helpful. Vileplume had given him that bag of seeds. Maybe one of them was a heal seed? That would certainly do the trick.

Bellossom and Vileplume fought the wild electivire, beating back and knocking it out with a combined sleep powder. When they turned around, they saw Enny standing alone and panicking, while Adrian was nowhere in sight.

“Woah, hold up. Where did Adrian go?” Vileplume asked.

“I… I dunno!” Enny stuttered. “I just gave him a heal seed, and he disappeared!”

“He what?” Vileplume reeled back from the explanation.

“I dunno! I’ve never seen anything like that happen!” Enny said.

“Enny, what did the seed look like?” Bellossom asked.

“Uh, it was blue, and it had a green vine around it,” Enny described.

Bellossom and Vileplume’s faces went pale as they realized what happened.

“What’s wrong? That’s what a heal seed looks like, right?”

“Enny, that’s a warp seed you idiot!” Vileplume yelled. “You just teleported him to a random part of the dungeon! He could be anywhere!”

“OH MY GOD! I’M SO SORRY!” Enny cried. “I haven’t had to use my seeds before! I had no idea!”

Vileplume continued to berate Enny while Bellossom stood there. Her thoughts were more focused on Adrian. He was alone in a random part of the dungeon, wounded and paralyzed. She had no idea what would become of him. He hadn't been the nicest to her, but she still worried about him.

Eventually, Vileplume stopped his yelling and he stepped up to lead the group. He had no idea where Adrian could be, so he decided it was best to continue forward in the dungeon. They traveled through the endless hallways of the Power Plant, hoping to find the gang of outlaws so they could finish their job and return home. Hopefully, everyone would make it out alright.
