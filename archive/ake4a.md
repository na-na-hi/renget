##### `Arranged Marriage`
>Be human prince
>Your parents wed you to a far off maiden through an arranged marriage
>Deep down you know they're trying to get you out of their hair so your older brother can take the throne uncontested, royal politics are no joke
>After a long and arduous journey you arrive at your maidens castle
>Waiting on the steps are the royal guard and all the castles servants
>And in the center, flanked by her mother and father, is her
>You didn't think she'd be so furry
