Here's the most optimal guide to farming and grinding the most effectively at Limbus Company.

## %green% Spending Lunacy %%

If your max Enkephalin is above 100+, 3 refills per day is your maximum goal. Otherwise, stick to only 2 refills. That way, you'll make the most of your Lunacy. A single Mirror Dungeon run costs 5 Modules, or 100 Enkephalin, so you're guaranteed a run which each refill. You will save up as much Lunacy for Walpurgisnacht, which has exclusive IDs/EGO that are overpowered as fuck. Walpurgisnacht is a special event that only comes once every 3 months, and the only way to get those IDs are through pulls.

With 750 Lunacy from the weekly Mirror Dungeon bosses, 300 Lunacy from the weekly updates, you'll still have a net loss of 42 Lunacy, or around 500 Lunacy per season, assuming the season lasts 3 months. However, don't let that discourage you. As a new player, you have so many different ways to gain free Lunacy. If you uptie any ID to tier 3, you'll get 40 Lunacy. If you finish any story node, battle or just cutscenes, that's another 40 Lunacy. The Battlepass also has a lot of Lunacy, same with the Battlepass of the side Cantos (the X.5 chapters). Not to mention, with every new content, the game is bound to break, not always, but most of the times. Be it a new ID release, a new Mirror Dungeon, a new Railway Refraction, or even a new Canto. Depending on how severe it is, emergency updates will commence, rewarding you with Lunacy once the update is completed.

## %green% Pulls %%

Never, and I mean NEVER, do pulls. It's a scam, even if Limbus Company has the most generous rates in the sea of predatory Gacha games.

But if you do any pulls, the only time you should ever do pulls, is when a new banner is released. Never go for old banners. A lot of the older IDs are either useless, require a niche setup, or are under-powered. The new IDs will always be more powerful than the old ones, and a single 10 pull should at least guarantee the new 00 ID, and MAYBE the 000 ID. You will do a SINGLE 10-pull, and stop there. As tempting as it’ll be, you NEED to stop at a single 10 pull.

And I’ll sound like a broken record, but NEVER do EGO banner pulls. It’s less than a 2% chance, and you’re better off saving your Lunacy.

## %green% Runs %%

You need to do ONE Thread Luxcavation and ONE Ticket Luxcavation. You’ll do the run and never skip it. Do one run of each tier, since it'll give you 40 Lunacy the first time you complete it, afterward, stick with the latest tier. The rest of your Modules will go toward Mirror Dungeon runs. The Luxcavation runs will progress your daily checkmarks, which will give you 3 shard boxes, each containing 1-3 shards/thread.

Every week, you’ll get Mirror Dungeon bonuses, which will get you a total of 66 boxes and 750 Lunacy. The most optimal way to get everything, at the least Module cost, is to do a single Mirror Dungeon Hard run. That way, you can collect all the rewards without needing to do three Normal runs. Mirror Dungeon Hard is much more difficult than the Normal version, so you might not be able to complete it when you’re in the early stages of the game

3 refills per day, plus the 240 naturally generated Enkephalin, will give you about 5–6 (assuming you level up your account), which is around 45 shard boxes. By the end of the day, you’ll have 48 boxes, which should give you ~100 shards/thread. Assuming you follow the guide, that’ll give you enough boxes to shard 2.5 000 IDs from the dispenser, without doing any pulls.

Note: Opening more boxes is always better than opening them one at a time in to get the most shards.

## %green%  IDs %%

Let’s talk about the bread and butter of Limbus, the characters. Here are the best IDs for each of the sinners. That way, you’ll have one for each of the sinners. I'll also give a brief description in case you're looking for something specific

Note: some of these IDs might not be available to you, which is why I gave some alternatives until they become available, usually by the next season or if you're lucky with the pulls

Don't bother
%#325339% Outis: %%
%gold%  000 %%
Molar (Discard, high damage and clash numbers) / Magic Bullet (A bit tricky to use, but if the fight takes too long, she can nuke with 7 bullets)
%gold%  00 %%
Cinq (She has one of the better Evade skill in the game. If the 000 IDs aren't available to dispense, she makes a good alternative if you really want an Outis ID)
%#69350b% Gregor: %%
%gold%  000 %%
Twinhook (His damage and clash numbers only increase the more the fight goes on)
%gold%  00 %%
Don't bother

Note: All of these IDs stink at Uptie 1. At the very least, you should always Uptie them to Tier 3. Uptying your IDs is more important than leveling them up. At Uptie 3, you unlock their skill 3 and passives, while Uptie 4 gives them more stuff to do. In Mirror Dungeon Normal, where you'll be spending most of your time, your IDs will always be at max level. But their Uptie Tier carries over. So even if they're at level 1 outside Mirror Dungeon, they'll be max level in the dungeon. But if they're at Uptie 1, they'll remain at Uptie 1.

## %green% EGOs %%

EGOs aren’t really necessary for 99% of the time. If you finished Canto 3, your base EGOs are more than enough. You mainly use EGOs to apply debuffs, win big clash numbers, and do AoE damage; they aren’t meant for pure high damage. There are 1.5 EGOs that are worth sharding however.

Fluid Sac Heals both HP and SP for all IDs. It's your go to for team heals and a must pick if you're really, REALLY, struggling with maintaining your health and sanity. Rime Shank is powerful, a boss killer sometimes, but only at Threadspin 4; otherwise, it’s mediocre. Investing into Rime Shank early will eat up all of your resources, and it’s not worth it if you have nothing.

## %green% Mirror Dungeon Starlights %%

To gain the most starlight in the fastest way possible, you need to run individual IDs every run, for six straight runs. I have managed to narrow it down and optimize the best team to farm Starlights. These IDs MOSTLY benefit from each other, including support IDs as well. Sinking, at the moment, isn’t complete due to the lack of IDs, but you’re free to add them if you lack IDs for the most optimal Starlight grind. You don't need to Uptie the support IDs to Uptie 4, you just want to Uptie them to Uptie 3 to unlock their passive skills.

This is what I found to be the most optimal, so you might be able to come up with a better combination.

Note: Bleed Team is going to be your MDH team thanks to Bloody Mist, so it might be wise to invest in it first.

## %green% Spending Real Money %%

If you’re a casual player, and don’t really care about the side content, Refracted Railway, or emptying the dispenser, then you can ignore the next section. But if you don’t mind spending money, these are what you should aim for. Listed from the most beneficial, to the least.

Note: Except for the Limbus Pass, none of the packs are required for the grind guide. It's only if you don't mind spending money or if you need more resources. I'm not encouraging you, or advocating for you, to spend real money on the game.

## %green%  Limbus Pass %%

The pass will make your grind much easier and will give you more unlocks as you progress. This is the bare minimum when it comes to spending money and you're more than fine grinding with the Limbus Pass alone.

Now, season 4 changed the purchase method of the Limbus Pass. Now, instead of directly paying for it, you need to buy a 1300 Paid Lunacy pack, for the same price of $11. Now, this does open a new opportunity for players who are willing to stick around and continue playing the game, as in, purchasing a higher tier Lunacy pack gives you more Paid Lunacy to buy the Limbus Pass at a cheaper price. If you purchase a pack for the first time, you get double the amount of Paid Lunacy. But don't worry, because Project Moon loves the game and its fans, that first time bonus purchase reset every year on the anniversary. Meaning, if you were to buy, for example, the $24 Lunacy Crate, which gives you 4292 Paid Lunacy, you will be saving around $9 than if you were to buy 3 Limbus Passes on three separate occasions on top of having 392 extra remaining Paid Lunacy.

Now, of course, this deal is a double edged sword. Not only are you paying upfront, but you're also paying for future content at a cheaper price. Whether you stick around until then, the game ending its servers or whatnot, are all on the table. I'm not going to tell which one you should buy since circumstances differ from person to person. Here are two different graphs, to let you know of your options and what you're paying for.

## %green% Paid Lunacy %%

Now, once you picked the right Lunacy package, whether it's only for the current season or future seasons, you can forget about them. Those Paid Lunacy are for Limbus Pass and Limbus Pass only. Don't let greed get in your head.

However, if you still want more Lunacy and willing to pay for it, then the ‘Monthly Lunacy Supply’ and ‘Monthly Lunacy Batch’ are the ones you should be looking at. For $10, you get around 4k Lunacy, 800 of them being Paid Lunacy over the course of a month.

With Paid Lunacy, you can spend 13 of them on a cheap single pull per day, or save them for the next Limbus Pass. If you decide to use them on banner, you will only spend the Paid Lunacy on the limited banners. Spending Lunacy on the Limited Banners gives you [Ideality]. Once the banner ends, which will be in 2 weeks, you’ll get the [Ideality] back as Threads. So basically, 14 Threads and 3 shard/threads, assuming you only get 0 ID duplicates, so a total of 56. But you won't be pulling 0 ID duplicates all the time. Every 10th pull is a guarantee 00 ID, or 000 at a higher chance, so you'll make the most out of your Paid Luancy.

Standard Extractions don’t have [Ideality] so there’s no point in even looking at it.

## %green% Misc %%

Those two are your two best choices when it comes to spending real money on the game, not counting the Paid Lunacy for the Limbus Pass because we already forgot about it *wink* *wink*. Don’t go beyond that. BUT, if you still want to spend money (not sure why, but to each their own), ‘Weekly Enkephalin Pack’ and ‘Monthly Extraction Pack’ are the only two packs that are worth taking. The other packs might sound tempting, thinking that it'll give you a headstart, but trust me, each of those packs can be achieved with one week of grinding. The Enkephalin is the best one if you want to take the grind to overclock. Going beyond 3 refills per day is not worth it, since you’ll end up in the red really fast. The Extraction Pack gives you 650 Paid Lunacy, for your single pulls or saving them for future Limbus Pass, and a 10 pull ticket, which I don’t need to tell you, but you’ll save it only for new banners or Walpurgis Night

Happy grinding Limbabs. May your dispenser be empty quick. Signed R.N.O.F.S (Ryoshu’s number one foot slave)
