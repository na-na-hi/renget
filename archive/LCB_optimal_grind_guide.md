Here's the most optimal guide to farming and grinding the most effectively at Limbus Company.

>Spending Lunacy

If your max Enkephalin is above 100+, 3 refills per day is your maximum goal. Otherwise, stick to only 2 refills. That way, you'll make the most of your Lunacy. You will save up as much Lunacy for Walpurgis Night, which has exclusive IDs/EGO that are overpowered as fuck. Walpurgis Night only comes once every 3 months, and the only way to get those IDs are through pulls.

>Pulls

Never, and I mean NEVER, do pulls. It's a scam, even if Limbus Company has the most generous rates in the sea of predatory Gacha games.

The only time you should ever do pulls, is when a new banner is released. Never go for old banners. A lot of the older IDs are either useless, require a niche setup, or are underpowered. The new IDs will always be more powerful than the old ones, and a single 10 pull should at least guarantee the new 00 ID, and MAYBE the 000 ID. You will do a SINGLE 10-pull, and stop there. As tempting as it’ll be, you NEED to stop at a single 10 pull.

And I’ll sound like a broken record, but NEVER do EGO banner pulls. It’s less than a 2% chance, and you’re better off saving your Lunacy.

>Runs

You need to do ONE Thread Luxcavation and ONE Ticket Luxcavation. You’ll do the run and never skip it. Do one run of each tier, since it'll give you 40 Lunacy the first time you complete it. The rest of your Modules will go toward Mirror Dungeon runs. The Luxcavation runs will progress your daily checkmarks, which will give you 3 shard boxes, each containing 1-3 shards/thread.

Every week, you’ll get Mirror Dungeon bonuses, which will get you a total of 66 boxes and 750 Lunacy. The most optimal way to get everything, at the least Module cost, is to do a single Mirror Dungeon Hard run. That way, you can collect all the rewards without needing to do three Normal runs. Mirror Dungeon Hard is much more difficult than the Normal version, so you might not be able to complete it when you’re in the early stages of the game

3 refills per day, plus the 240 naturally generated Enkephalin, will give you about 5–6 (assuming you level up your account), which is around 45 shard boxes. By the end of the day, you’ll have 48 boxes, which should give you ~100 shards/thread. Assuming you follow the guide, that’ll give you enough box to shard 2.5 000 IDs from the dispenser, without doing any pulls.

Note: Opening more boxes is always better than opening them one at a time in to get the most shards.

>IDs

Let’s talk about the bread and butter of Limbus, the characters. Here are the best IDs for each of the sinners. That way, you’ll have one for each of the sinners.

Spicebush Yi Sang. The One Who Grips/Seven Faust (Debuffs and the other is for damage and clashing). W Don. W Ryoshu. Rhino Mersault. K Corp/Ting Tang/Dieci Hong Lu (Immortal/tank, damage/support passive, pure damage/discard). Rabbit/QQ Heathcliff (A must-pick and the other shreds in Bleed teams). All of Ishmaels 000 IDs are good, but my favorite is Reindeer (note: This guide is before Ahabmael). Dieci Rodion. N Corp/Cinq (first is a boss killer, and the other is good for longer fights). Unless you have Molar Outis in your dispenser, don’t bother sharding any of her IDs. Pirate Gregor

Note: A lot of these IDs stink at Uptie 1. At the very least, you should always Uptie them to Tier 3. Uptying your IDs is more important than leveling them up. At Uptie 3, you unlock their skill 3 and passives, while Uptie 4 gives them more stuff to do. In Mirror Dungeon Normal, where you'll be spending most of your time, your IDs will always be at max level. But their Uptie Tier carries over.

>EGOs

EGOs aren’t really necessary for 99% of the time. If you finished Canto 3, your base EGOs are more than enough. You mainly use EGOs to apply debuffs, win big clash numbers, and do AoE damage; they aren’t meant for pure high damage. There are 1.5 EGOs that are worth sharding

Fluid Sac Heals both HP and SP for all IDs. Rime Shank is powerful, but only at Threadspin 4; otherwise, it’s mediocre. Investing into Rime Shank early will eat up all of your resources, and it’s not worth it if you have nothing.

>Mirror Dungeon Startlight

To gain the most starlight in the fastest way possible, you need to run individual IDs every run, for six straight runs. I have managed to narrow it down and optimize the best team to farm Starlights. These IDs MOSTLY benefit from each other, including support IDs as well. Sinking, at the moment, isn’t complete due to the lack of IDs, but you’re free to add them if you lack IDs for the most optimal Starlight grind. 

Bleed Team is going to be your MDH team thanks to Bloody Mist, so it might be wise to invest in it first.

>Spending real money

If you’re a casual player, and don’t really care about the side content, Refracted Railway, or emptying the dispenser, then you can ignore the next section. But if you don’t mind spending money, these are what you should aim for. Listed from the most beneficial, to the least.

Note: Except for the Limbus Pass, none of the packs are required. It's only if you don't mind spending money or if you need more resources. I'm not encouraging you, or advocating for you, to spend real money on the game.

>Limbus Pass

The pass will make your grind much easier and will give you more unlocks as you progress. This is the bare minimum when it comes to spending money and you're more than fine grinding with the Limbus Pass alone.

>Paid Lunacy

There are so many Lunacy packs, but don’t even bother looking at them. They’re all a scam. If you want more Lunacy, there are only two packs you should look at. ‘Monthly Lunacy Supply’ and ‘Monthly Lunacy Batch’. For $10, you get around 4k Lunacy, 800 of them being Paid Lunacy over the course of a month.

With Paid Lunacy, you can spend 13 of them on a cheap single pull per day. You will only spend the Paid Lunacy on the limited banners. Spending Lunacy on the Limited Banners gives you [Ideality]. Once the banner ends, which will be in 2 weeks, you’ll get the [Ideality] back as Threads. So basically, 14 Threads. Standard Extractions don’t have [Ideality] so there’s no point in even looking at it.

>Misc.

Those two are your two best choices when it comes to spending real money on the game. Don’t go beyond that. BUT, if you still want to spend money (not sure why, but to each their own), ‘Weekly Enkephalin Pack’ and ‘Monthly Extraction Pack’ are the only two packs that are worth taking. The Enkephalin is the best one if you still want to grind. Going beyond 4 refills per day is not worth it, since you’ll end up in the red really fast. The extraction pack gives you 650 Paid Lunacy, for your single pulls, and a 10 pull ticket, which I don’t need to tell you, but you’ll save it only for new banners or Walpurgis Night

Happy grinding Limbabs. May your dispenser be empty quick. Signed R.N.O.F.S (Ryoshu’s number one foot slave)
