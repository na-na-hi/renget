# Potion Pete's Big Day

In the far north mountains, there existed ornate, great halls. The nomadic people who lived in these mountains knew not speak of these halls, as those people mysteriously dissappeared. These mountains were the domain of the Assasin brotherhood, Okda Jabbar. Ten figures, cast in darkness, were discussing what to do about their missing eleventh.

"Brother Pherkad, has Brother Rasalased's killer been located?"
"Yes, High Master. Our spies have tracked his killer to the swamp, west of here. There is a large base in the center. We believe he has massive amounts of people with him. No small amount of workers could build it the few days we believe it to be built."
"A massive amount, huh? Very well then. All ten of us shall go. We'll be finished before tomorrow's dinner."

"Laaa dee de da dee dee da da da~!"
Potion Pete was working on adding bizarre stone features to a hideous fish creature.
"Oh, Psbilimlzak? Pass me the boiling oil."
Psbilimlzak was a hideous creature, himself. About the size of a child, green, and hairy, it was assisting Pete in his horrid creations, helping to assemble and grow it's "siblings".
"Which one, boss? Da one boiling cuz of da electricity, or da one boiling cuz of da fire?"
"The one boiling from the acid."
"Ah! I missed dat one."
Psbilimlzak carried the large cauldron, roughly five times his size, and places it next to the fish monstrosity, which was even larger.
"What will ya name this one, boss?"
"I'm feeling Lipidgut the Emetic."
"Good name, boss."
As Psbilimlzak started pouring the acidic oil into the mouth of the newly created being, a pig-like Homonculus, the size of a house, crashed through the wall.
"Visitors, and they already killed Wicklongla. Annoying. Get Lipidgut the Emetic ready. I might be a while."
"On it, Boss!"

-------------------------------------------------------

High Master Sadalbari was known for many things. To his pupils, they knew him as an assassin that had always killed his target, and without anyone knowing the target was dead until at least a day had passed.
To the nomads, it was known that anyone who whispered his name would be found dead at most one week away. To Brother Pherkad, he was now known as a pile of mush that had been in the way of a humanoid abomination covered in fleshy growths and wielding a tree trunk. He would've commented on the situation, but he was unfortunately being choked by a smaller snake-like creature that was wrapped around his neck.

Through considerable effort, he cut the snake-thing from his neck with his dagger, and looked upon the abomination with fear.

*"High Master... is dead?"*
*"That can't be right. This can't be happening!"*

The abomination finished smashing the tree trunk in the bloody mush on the ground, and turned to face the terrified assassin.

"Pher... Pher... Pher... Kad... Brother..."

These gargled mumblings from the creature had terrified Pherkad even more, but what made him almost faint was seeing the face of the creature. Sure enough, it was most certaintly the face of Brother Rasalased. Er, *former* brother Rasalased. Although being dead likely caused him to lose his Okda Jabbar membership, crushing his mentor most certaintly did.

"Rasalased!? I thought you were dead! I saw your corps-ACK!!"

The abomination had wrapped its considerably large hands around Pherkad's considerably smaller neck. Rasalased was normally not very large, but the tumors covering his body were likely proof of injections of a substance that caused his growth.

"Pher... Kad..."

As the life was leaving the assassin's eyes, he saw a figure in a blue coat enter the room, which was filled with the corpses of bizarre amphibians, weird reptiles, and Okda Jabbar assassins.

"Like him? I named him Jimmy."

Rasalased- uh, *Jimmy*, apparently, had pinned down Pherkad at the wave of the blue coated man's hand.

"Alright, you're the last one. Any others I should know about? ...Any special abilities?"
"Aggh... go... to... Mung..."
"Guess not. I still wanna check, though."

With another wave of his hand, the blue coated man brought in large mosquito-like beings, each the size of a horse. They flew down to each Okda Jabbar assassin's remains, if any remained at all due to elemental breaths spewed by giant toads, and started sucking. They gorged themselves on their blood, and one gorged itself on Pherkad.

"AHHHHHHHH!"
"Geez! You're still alive? W-we don't **torture** people, Jimmy! Give him some mercy!"
"Pher... Kad..."

With one swift movement, which was honestly surprising, coming from a creature that looked like it could barely move, Pherkad's neck was crushed.


-------------------------------------------------------

"Laaa dee de da dee dee da da da~!"
Potion Pete walked back into his workshop, and waved at a bunch of Maggot Homunculi writhing past him. He also waved at the Mosquito Homunculi, who were depositing the contents of their stomachs in large vats.

"Good work, boys! Make sure there isn't a body left in there!"
"Aye-aye, boss!"

Potion Pete gazed upon his new creation, Lipidgut the Emetic. He was made from a bass. Potion Pete put his hands on Psbilimizak's shoulders, who was staring at the creation as well.

"He's coming along great. Now, it's time for Weapon Testing!"
"Who you gonna use, boss?"
"Oh, Jimmy~!"

The lumbering abomination stumbled forth.

"Sorry Jimmy, but I think you're defective. Also, you have the strongest body here! Brace for impact!"
"Okda..."
"Give him a load of acid, Lipidgut!"

The horrible fish monster, laying flat on the table it was born on, flopped it's body at a blistering speed, and launched a glob of oil right at Jimmy. It melted him, so it was a success.

"Alright! Now that those assassins are out of the way, it's back to cooking up more victories! Make sure to tell me when the Homonculi are back from raiding Okda Jabbar's library, Psbilimizak."
"Got it, boss."

Potion Pete is not a well adjusted man.
