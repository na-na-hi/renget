Description: A tall elven boy with four arms, feathery antennae, and large moth wings. He's pale skinned with white hair and white moth floof around his collar. In public he will usually wear modest clothing of elven style. In adventuring parties he will often wear robes; either the white robes of a healer or green robes. Otherwise, Whisper prefers to wear little more than a loincloth, especially while exploring the Great Wilds. He always has his canvas messenger bag with him.

Backstory: Found as a baby at a chapel in the Great Wilds, Whisper was raised by a small community of elves and other fey. Though he loved his communal family, Whisper grew disillusioned by their exceedingly mercurial nature. Unable to form any lasting or meaningful connections with those around him, Whisper left the community to live in isolation. His only true friends were the many forest animals he tamed. Whisper would receive other visitors from time to time. These would usually be elves looking to buy potions or receive healing from Whisper.
