FACT: You will be playing with bots until Account Level 5.

FACT: Trials of the Realm challenges can be completed in vs AI modes, if it's too bullshit.

FACT: If you want to finish Passes fast, use up your Team Boosters and do Quests, then just use Gold to buy boosters for every game after.
Hoarding them for no reason does nothing. They only cost 500 Gold, which more than pays for itself when you consider you usually get ~150k from the pass+trials, on top of match rewards. Less advisable for newer players who are yet to unlock everyone.
The 'optimal' grind is Siege vs AI with boosters in a team, for the increased rewards and easy+fast wins - but you can easily finish it in a few weeks in normal ques, provided you do your quests.

##Credits / Out-of-game Lore
*A section giving a short tl;dr glossary about some of the names surrounding the game, (within the dev team, community and threads) so the common newfag is not completely lost on such discussion. Generally not a proud place to be listed.*

## How to Update This Thing

1. Have this page open in one window
2. Have a new rentry.co tab open in another
3. Click Edit on the old version, copy everything into the new one (Right click, select all, copy, paste); then apply the changes you want (formatting is EZPZ too, and explained in the How tab if you want to do it)
4. Think of a edit code nobody will ever guess (open a dictionary and choose a random word)
5. Make the custom url ''palg_[Date]'' so people can see if / when it was updated
6. Click Go, then paste your *new and improved* link into the OP
7. Squadalaa! You're off!

>Why?
Because if it's a single persistent link, it'll get flooded with gay furry pedophile links from the usual suspect and no way to recover the previous text - that, or discord troons taking the thing over for themselves. At least this way the original / previous link is retained for the next OP to revert to if an 'updated' link is less than preferential. 
I'm sure *you're* not bad Anon, but preez unnastan, you gotta futureproof these things in advance; ounce of prevention worth more than a pound of cure and all that.
