Penny and Heather in Silent Hill

>>I left the Room of Requirement late one night rolling my shoulders. I had been working my way through a heavy tome on the practice of 'Mnemonic Gesture' - the art of adding extra flourishes to a spell's wand movement to alter the effects of a spell in the same way a verbal spell modifier could - and had only noticed the time when I was distracted by two of my Hopping Pots crashing into each other from the potions lab I had set up nearby.

>>It was nearly curfew, moonbeams casting shadows in the gloomy halls of Hogwarts, and I was trying to make it back to the Ravenclaw Common Room before Professor Weasley or a Prefect caught me out.

>>I was just passing a restroom though, when I heard a strange sound, like the whistling of the Hogwarts Express pulling into Kings Cross, only it was deeper and pulsing out in even intervals - spaced as it was with an eerie silence. I stopped where I was, looking around cautiously, suspecting that I had just walked into the latest bit of inanity from Peeves, but then I noticed something... disconcerting. The stone floors and marbled walls were somehow peeling away, cinders filling the air around me, as though a fire was burning with in them and somehow reducing them to ash, though the ambient temperature hadn't changed, but that wasn't possible, right? Even in a world of magic.

An illusion?

>>I murmured, drawing my wand, fourteen inches of rowan wood and dragon-heartstring sending tingles of power through my arm into my core. I slashed my wand down sharply though the air, incanting,

Finite Incantatum!

>>There was a pulse of magic released, but the illusion remained. I swallowed nervously, perhaps this wasn't an illusion after all and something stranger was afoot. The walls had almost entirely burnt away by now, and the lights (already soft and low) dimmed further. I looked down and realized that the stone floors were now made from rotting planks of wood that had me taking a step back automatically, letting out a yelp of surprise. I looked up and my eyes widened behind silver half-moon spectacles.

>>Hogwarts was gone...

What the hell?

>>I took a step forward, glancing up and down, left and right, even turning around, but all around me was darkness. In the distance I could hear the whistle of steam escaping confinement mixed with the strange siren that had initiated this change and I reached down and pinched myself hard on the thigh.

Oww!

>>Rubbing where I pinched to sooth it, a look of consternation on my face, I whipped my wand up and angrily mumbled,

Lumos Maxima!

>>and a pale orb of light sprung free from the tip of my wand to orbit my head like the earth's moon, casting its rays out.

>>I saw that I was in some sort of boiler room, surrounded by thick iron pipes joined together by rivets, through which leaked jets of steam. I couldn't see much else though. I swallowed nervously and unwrapped my scarf from my neck, as I was suddenly struck by how humid it was in this place, before storing it away in my cap (enchanted with an Undetectable Extension Charm). That done, I held my wand in my teeth while I took off my jacket and wrapped it around my waist, leaving just the leather vest and white blouse. Much more comfortable, I took my wand back and licked suddenly dry lips.

Now where the Hell am I?

>The cool autumn wind felt refreshing on my flushed face, red from one too many firewhiskey and butterbeer bombs. I was just out celebrating another Slytherin quidditch victory with my new friends in Hogsmeade, as any good Hogwarts student would do. But before the real festivities could happen, I ended up leaving early due to the sudden onset of head splitting pain... Most of my life I would experience episodes of this kind of horrible headache, where it felt like something was in my mind, desparately trying to claw its way out. Tonight was an especially awful episode, so I quickly started making my way down the country road back towards the castle. But before I made it to the gates, a mysterious and black robed figure suddently apparated right in front of me, nearly knocking me to the ground.

>At first I thought it was a professor, ready to dole out a punishment to another foolhardy student, so I started to awkwardly spit out an excuse for my breaking curfew

Uh... Professor! I, uh, couldn't sleep and-

>But I was suddenly cut off - a loud ringing sound reverberated through my head, intensyfing the pain my head was already in, bringing me to my knees. The figure started speaking as well, but I couldn't catch a word being in so much pain, apart from "Remember who you are".

>At this point I was doubled over, holding my eyes closed and clutching my nauseated stomache as I screamed in pain, hoping for everything to just END. Somehow though, as quickly as it all befell me, the pain ceased and I cautiously began to open my eyes and stand. It struck me that it was suddenly far darker now than it was only a few moments ago

Lumos!

>I shouted the incantation for light and what greeted my sight was beyond my comprhension. I was no longer in front of the castle - in fact, I was fairly certain I wasn't even on Earth at all anymore. All around me, replacing the open nature of the Scottish Highlands, was a claustrophobic and twisting reality of decaying and rusted metal, so badly worn and red that appeared to be "bleeding". I gasped in shock and horror, not only at what I was seeing, but also at the fact some part, deep within me, recognized this on some level. I took a few deep breaths, brushed back my dyed blonde hair from my face, fixed my robes and sweater, and began to take a few tentative steps forward. As I did, I heard another voice, a female, yell out "Now where the hell am I?" Realizing I might not be alone in this nightmare, I yelled out a response:

Hello!? Can you hear me? Where are you?

0

>>I looked up when I heard a female voice relatively close by, turning my head to try and pinpoint the direction, and when I was relatively sure I had a lock on it, I started moving, my orbiting light providing me with just enough clearance that I was able to duck under a low pipe and then weave around another that ran vertically from the ground up into the shadows above me where I couldn't see. Squeezing between two more, I came to a slight clearing in the boiler room where I saw a beaten up old shop bench scattered with muggle hand-tools. They were all covered in rust and I tried my best to ignore what looked like dried blood splatted on the head of a mallet.

>>Moving on, I squinted my eyes, peering through the oppressive darkness to see a dim red light nearby.

Hello!? Are you close!? I'm Penelope Warwick - from Hogwarts! I don't know where I am!

>>Screwing up my courage, I walked closer to the red light and I nearly stumbled when I saw what looked like a ring of runic symbols burnt into a brick wall, a large hole inside it that dripped ichor and other unknown fluids.

What the hell... This is...

>>I knelt closer to the hole, peering at the symbols. They weren't any alphabet I had studied in my Ancient Runes class, but I could feel a steady thrum of energy running through them...

>>Standing again, I yelled,

Where are you!?

0

>Penelope Warwick - the name of the other girl trapped in... wherever this was, with me. In an attempt to distract myself momentarily from this horrid situation, I tried to remember her face. All I could recall was that she was a very adventurous person, always going into the next crypt or tomb to satisfy that deep, Ravenclaw obsession for knowledge. I realized then we had charms class together, and that gave me the presence of mind needed to focus on getting the hell out of... hell.

Penelope! It's me, Heather Mason, from charms class! I'm not... exactly sure where I am, but I'm going to make my way towards your voice!

>As I said that, I started slowly but determinedly taking steps toward where I thought she might be. The environment around me began to take a more cohesive shape, appearing as a dilapidated and macabre warehouse of some kind. There were pipes and tools haphazardly scattered throughout this maze of rooms and hallways. It appeared almost like one of those new types of muggle "industrial" buildings I saw back in America. As I neared where I thought she was, I noticed a huge red brick wall with some, mysterious hole leaking unknown fluids... All around it were symbols of some sort, but one, in particular, drew my gaze - it was a circle with runic and esoteric symbols written along the inner circumference, and then another circle within that one that contained 3 more circles in a triangle-like pattern... I did not consciously know what that symbol was or meant, but EVERY part of my being screamed in fear and awe from some understanding of it. I was overwhelmed again by an agonizing pain and was brought to my knees, screaming out

Aaah - AAAAaaaaaaAAAhhhh…

0

>>Heather mason. Blonde. Slytherin. She could be a bit of a trouble-maker if I remember correctly - swiping drink, I think. Still, I was more than happy to not be alone in this strange place.

>>I could hear her voice getting closer until it sounded like it was just on the other side of this strange hol-

>>Aaah - AAAAaaaaaaAAAhhhh...

Heather!?

>>I grit my teeth and sucked in a deep breath. I didn't want to, but Heather needed me, so I touched the wall, ducking down and crawling into the hole. It was like a tunnel dug through brick and dark, so dark that I could barely see, even with my orb of light, and the walls were slick with what I could only describe as viscera. It stunk too, like a slaughtered animal. I felt like the walls were pressing down on me, a yoke around my shoulders, and just as I was starting to wonder how thick this seemingly brick wall was, I was out the other end where I saw Heather crying out, and I was at her side in a flash, throwing her arm over my shoulder, ignoring the reddish goop left behind on my formerly pure white shirt, even as trousers stuck to my knees from where I had crawled through the hole.

Heather! Heather wake up!

>I hugged her to my side, rocking her like she was a frightened child, but without knowing what was wrong I couldn't really help her beyond trying to comfort her.

0

>As I fell to the floor in pain, my mind blanked out and I lost all sense of consciousness. All I can remember after that is just swirling heat and hellish and debauched imagery filling my mind - images of Hogwarts, but twisted, ruined and burned, filled with monstrosities that no magic tomes had ever mentioned. These abominations were... having their way with what poor students remained... Seared into my mind in that moment were scenes of girls being violated by these ceaseless horrors... their gangly and inhuman appendages thrusting into the girls' vulnerable womanhood... others being pressed upon by multiple humanoid figures, their otherworldly cocks filling every hole of their unwilling victims... Screams of pleaure and pain mixed with some kind of ringing sound bounced through my skull until finally the cries of Penelope woke me.

AHHH

>I cried in abject shock... I took several deep gulps of breath, and through teary eyes, stared at the gentle girl now cradling me in her arms.
Oh Penelope, thank Merlin... I found you safe and sound

>I tried to weakly joke with her, if to at least calm myself. With her assisstance, I began to stand. I wiped the tears from my eyes, brushed my hair and tried to focus.

I'm- I'm not sure where we are... do you know?

0

I swallowed and let out a breath in relief, still holding Heather close.

I-I'm not sure. I was in Hogwarts. Going back to Ravenclaw tower - I had lost track of time while studying, but then I heard this siren or horn... The stone hallways began to burn and flake away into ash and I found myself in a boiler room. That's when I heard you.

>>I looked back at the Hole... only it wasn't a Hole any more. The sigils and runes were still there, as were the stains of viscera dripping from where the Hole had been, but no way through it that I could see.

>>I closed my eyes and tried to calm my thundering heart before I opened them and stood, bringing Heather with me.

>>I twisted my wand like a key in a lock, a Mnemonic gesture I had just read about that allowed me to increase the power to my orb of light without verbalizing or re-casting the spell. The orb grew in brightness, though it barely fought back the darkness surrounding us.

All I know, Heather, is that is isn't Hogwarts - not anymore.

0

>Those words, though I expected them, disheartened me ever so slightly. Even after I woke, I was left with uncanny feeling of "unrealness", where I just wasn't me. Or that something in me was trying to bubble to the surface. But, with Penny still holding me, and with my years of experience surviving with my father, I shook off that feeling as best I could and steeled myself, for both of us.

>I cast my own light spell to augment Penny's and with that, was able to study the wall more closely. The hole was gone, but still, a nagging feeling in the back of my mind made me thing there was something more there.
I have a feeling there's more to this wall than what's here... REVELIO!

>Before me on the wall was that same symbol from earlier, yet this time it encapsulated the entire wall and was glowing with sickly, red light. But instead of causing me pain, it drew me in - I reached out with my right hand, and the wall began to split apart, right where the hole of viscera used to be. Before Penelope and I, a wide door sized opening emerged, leaking viscera and other fluids in front of us. "Living" flesh lined parts of the door and what little of the area beyond we could see - it pulsated rhytmically, as if a heart was beating just under the "skin". I gulped at this sight, and at what I was about to say next

Penny - I don't know exactly how I know this, but this is the way forward.

0

>>Watching the pulsating, fleshy wall writhe was strangely hypnotic in a nauseating way, and the smell of sickness, rot, and dead animal was stronger than it had been when there was just a Hole.

Bloody Merlin... That's... the way forward?

>>I looked around but couldn't see much else around us. It seemed as if we'd have to go back the way I came by sheer process of elimination - a thought I wasn't looking forward to.

Well... The Hat almost put me in Gryffindor.

>>I joked weakly, the humor falling flat. Just because it was technically 'backtracking' doesn't meant that this door led back to the boiler room - we did live in a world of magic. Hell Hogwarts had at least a dozen secret passages that led to different locations depending on the time of day. It was probable that this Door would take us somewhere else... Whether that was a 'good' place remained to be seen, however.

Right.

>>I joined Heather at the door, wrinkling my nose at the grotesque thing. There were limbs, faces, organs, even genitalia - like the door was a construct of several bodies transfigured into a building.

Fucking Dark magic - whomever built this was depraved. I've seen bridges built out of bones, and enchanted skulls that worked like sentries guarding tombs and forgotten hidey holes of Dark magic, but this is...

>>I glanced at Heather and with a silent flick of my wand my orb of light sped into the opening, lighting the way just a bit.

Wands at the ready, I should think? How's your dueling and defensive magic?

0

>Even with the unimaginable sights ahead of us, I finally managed to regain some actual composure for the first time since Hogsmeade... Taking a deep breath, I dramatically swished my wand around, stopping it so it pointed directly ahead of me.

Defense against the Dark Arts is both my favorite and best class, so, I can handle myself.

>I try to smirk a bit, but the sights of twisted human like appendages and flesh flailing about and oozing liquids quickly wiped it from my face. Still I was never one to back down from a fight, so I was ready to take this new "challenge" head on.

Who knows why Gryffindor gets credited with bravery... we'll be full of it if we make it through whatever the hell this is!

>I tried to run with her joke to bring some levity and keep us both in good spirits. My dad was always adamant that giving into fear is what gets you killed, so anything to stymie that was good.

...Here goes nothing.

>And with that, I took a step through that threshold. Immediately I felt a significant temperature drop, and my nose was assaulted by a strange scent of rust and blood, mixed with something sweet and saccharine that replaced the smell of rot from earlier. But it's what I saw that shook me to my core - it opened into a hallway that was lined with iron grates and metal sheets. And from the same flesh that lined the door before, but in more grotesque "fullness". Arms, torsos, faces, genetalia - all of it mashed together desperately trying to reach out and escape its hellish prison. Looking closely, I noticed that some of the faces resembled people I knew - students, wizards and witches, their faces contorted in pain... and pleasure? They looked like the students in my nightmare, all being used by those monsters! The hallway had no clear end in sight from where we were, but it was the only way.

Penny, we have to move forward, and fast. Something is very wro-

>Before I could finish, a loud CLANG emanated out from behind us. In the darkness, a shadow of a towering figure emerged - it was hard to make out details, but it was shaped like a huge muscular man. It was wearing some kind mask or helmet, but was otherwise seemingly bare. And it began to lumber toward us.

MOVE!

0

>>I had followed half-a step behind Heather and was just as taken aback by the horrid mixture of scents and visual assault from the environment, but before and I had also seen that hulking figure. The moment I heard Heather yell, I was running, tossing an,

ARESTO MOMENTUM!

over my shoulder, but not looking to see if it hit or even effected that thing.

C'mon! Fuck!

>>I grunted, panting. Iron grates and fleshy bits blurred past us as as we went, but I still recognized a few faces - Professors Sharp and Weasley, and even Garreth - the young Gryffindor man I had lost my virginity to a few months ago…

0

>Hoping that Penny's quick thinking bought us even a few moments, I ran as fast as I could, faster than any other time in my life. As we moved though, the flesh on the walls began to react directly to our presense, and reached out towards us. Arms and hands, faces and tongues, and even disembodied cocks attempted to touch or grab us, to impede our progress.

DIFFINDO! DIFFINDO! DIFFINDOOO!

>I cried out the severing charm multiple times to clear the path that was slowly closing in on us. Blood started pooling down around us as this happened, and I was struck by piercing pain in my forehead. I felt that... 'person' in my mind again, this time overwhelmingly so. I stopped and dropped to my knees and was quickly grabbed by the wall itself. The arms started to pull me "into" it, ripping at my robes and my clothes as it did so. I was too weak though to put up any real resistance, so I did the only thing I could - I screamed

AAAAAHHHHH

>As I did, the hall began to warp around us, changing into some kind of open room. The flesh relented its grip slightly enough for me to open my eyes and take in our new surroundings - it was almost like a... muggle church of some kind. Except the walls and floor were lined with that same mixture of rusted metal and flesh, and the pulpit area changed into a cross between a metallic operating table and sacrificial alter. From the walls, figures started coming out - the same ones from my nightmares. I tried to reach for my wand, but the flesh wall still held me tight, groping me and ripping at the rest of my uniform.

PENNY! RUN!

>I yelled out in desperation.

0

>>My head spun from the forceful translocation, and I wanted to get to Heather, but I wouldn't have time to free her before these... things... were upon us.

>>"PENNY! RUN!"

Fuck that!

>>I spat, turning to the mob of advancing horrors, their gangly limbs writhing and their bodies undulating grotesquely. I brought my wand to bear and scowled, incanting,

Bombarda Maxima!

>>My wand almost bucked with the force of my spell, fueled as it was by anger, fear, and desperation, and the jet of energy it produced slammed into one of those -things- like a meteor, splattering it into gory chunks while the shockwave blew three more back as though I had hit them with a Banishing Charm. Pivoting, I slashed my wand and struck out with a Severing Charm, the bright sickle of energy slicing one horizontally. It shambled forward half a step and then fell into two parts. I heard a wet, raspy gurgle and I ducked just in time to avoid a swipe from a clawed appendage that seemed made of multiple different hands only for that creature to turn sharply, it's overly long cock whipping me across the cheek and leaving a trail of... something... that dripped passed my parted lips. I growled and punched out, physically knocking it back and then lit it on fire with a shouted,

CONFRINGO!

>>Spitting whatever -that- was out, I pulled two more creatures close with a Summoning Charm and then slammed them into the ground with a Descendo. Turning sharply, I slashed out and blocked another attack with a Shield Charm that pulsed outwards with the impact, producing a shockwave that blew it, and the two Things on the ground away.

>>Ducking forward, I dispersed into white mist and dashed closer to a group of shambling Things and fired a point-blank Banishing Charm into the dead-center of the group, throwing them back with bone-breaking force into a nearby wall.

>>It seemed, however, that the more of them I killed them, the more came. Instead of their numbers decreasing the opposite was happening and I grimaced.

>>I was, however, not particularly close to one at the moment, my dash putting me at an advantageous position and I transfigured the nearest Thing into a barrel of black powder which I Banished into a group of creatures that were moving towards Heather…

0

>Penny's excellent combat skills and quick thinking blew away part of the mass of flesh holding me back. I had enough purchase to grab my wand and could finally throw out a few spells of my own.

Diffindo!

INCENDIO!!!

>I casted the fire making spell all around me - buring up the abominations around me in righteous flame.

CONFRINGO!

>I followed up with a blasting curse of my own to clear the path to Penny, and I ran to her to regroup. We were surrounded by these Things, but we had bought ourselves some breathing room finally. I took this chance to assess myself for any damage I might have sustained. My robe was gone. My sweater and shirt were ripped to shreds to the point that my bare breasts were starting to show. My skirt was torn and my tights were entirely ripped off. And on top of this, I was covered in various types of... liquid. Aside from that though, I was more or less unharmed, even if completely shaken. My fear quickly turned to anger at what I just experienced, and at being stuck in this hellish situation at all. I focused that anger into my spellcasting

BOMBARDA!

>I wildly began casting spell after spell, curse after curse, even as more poured in. Suddenly though, from the back of the "church", the doors burst open and the towering "man" chasing us before reappeared. In the light of that room, I could see that his head was covered by a large, pyramid shaped metallic helmet. The rest of him though, was completely laid bare before us - his body, at least 7-8 feet tale, was pale and overly muscular and taut. But the thing that stood out the most, besides his hat fashion sense, was his penis. Even limp it had to be almost as big as my forearm. This pyramid man lifted his right hand at me and pointed - I once again dropped to my knees, but this time in excess pleasure and not pain.
Ahh.. Ahhhhh... AHHHHH

>I moaned out like a little whore, my emotions and lust running haywire. In that moment, the knowledge of who I was and what was meant for me filled my mind. I was the reincarnation of the powerful witch Alessa, the one my father tried to save all those years ago in Silent Hill. She, and now me, was to be the "mother" for some eldritch being... a vessel used to birth a 'god' for a cult of dark wizards. And now that I was here, I was to inseminated with this evil seed, so that the visions I saw in my nightmare could come to pass. Penny and I were to suffer every sexual humilation and degredation imaginable... and in my current state, I could not wait for it.

0

>>I grinned with such a savagery when Heather managed to free herself that my etiquette teachers back home in London would've had a fit, but that joy was short lived, even as we worked together to kill these fucking abominations, because that 'man' was here. Just as I was bringing my wand to bear on him - this time to cast magic far more harmful than a simple Slowing Charm, Heather cried out again, but something was subtly different here.

>>I knew what this scream was - I had made very similar screams before and I was unsurprised to see her hips jerking sporadically.

>>Was Heather really cumming right now?

The distraction caused my wand to falter, my focus to shift just enough that I didn't notice the Thing running up behind me before it jumped on my back and bore me to the floor with a heavy, painful crash.

>>My wand skittered out of my hand and rolled a few feet away, just out of reach, but the Thing didn't give me any chance to reach for it when two hands grabbed my wrists and held them down to the floor on either side of me. Then a second thing was there grabbing the back of my head and mushing my face down, rubbing my cheek into the disgusting fleshy surface.

Tendrils gripped at my shirt and vest and ripped at them and then my trousers followed, leaving me in my undergarments.

FUCK

>>I cried, trying to buck the Thing off me, but it was far heavier than it looked and it snarled wordlessly and the one holding my head squeezed painfully in warning.

>>I was pinned.

0

Ahhhhh... fuck.... ahhhhhhhh

>I continued to moan out in deep longing for pleasure... whatever magic the 'man' put on me was, it was both making me lose control of my conscious mind while still allowing me to "observe" it as it happened, as if to further my torment and shame.

Pen- pen... Penny...

>That was all I could choke out in my current state. I was on my hands and knees at this point, with tears streaming down my face mixing with the drool flowing freely from my mouth. The rest of my body was in no better shape - my pussy was quivering heavily, soaking the remains of my tattered Slytherin branded panties and my surprisingly large chest, normally hidden behind one of usual sweaters, was heaving heavily with my nipples fully erect. In simple terms, I was in heat. All my mind could focus on was that I needed to be filled, and fast. Just then, a few of the humanoid creatures reached out with their mishapen hands to grab my arms and legs. They pinned me down, though I wouldn't have fought anyways, while another creature, one that looked like two pairs of legs conjoined at the torso, moved behind me. It grew two large appendages shaped like cocks, one above the other, and started to push them into both my willing and waiting holes.

Oohhh... AHhhhhh

0

>>With the way my face was pressed into the ground, my head was facing the wrong way for me to actually see Heather, but I've been around enough to know that a wet pussy sounds like when it's being penetrated and the realization left me horrified both because I felt sorry for Heather, but also because of my preference for crotchless underwear meant that the Thing bending itself over my ass didn't even need to remove them.

>>I felt something meaty and hot smack into my ass cheek, leaving a wet splatter behind due to whatever fluids it was coated in, before it slid into my crack, rubbing and prodding alternatively at my pussy and arse before it seemingly decided on which it preferred when it speared itself into my back-door in one sharp thrust, sinking deep, and I was unable to even scream as I felt the air leave my lungs at the suddenness of the penetration.

>>The Creature wasted no time on any 'pleasantries' just simply starting to pound away at me for a few moments, ripping howls of pain from my lips, but then the Thing holding my head down let go and I was suddenly flipped up and over as the Thing sodomizing me rolled onto what passed for its own back, holding my legs open, pussy parting slightly, and it didn't take long for a second thing to rush in, getting between my legs and sliding it's own unnatural cock through my opening, gouging out my dry and unprepared passage, drawing still more screams from my throat.

>From the sounds next to me, I could tell that Penny was likely having a worse time than I was, but only just. Behind me, the 4 legged creature violently thrust both its cocks into my pussy and ass at the same time, causing me to match Penny's screams. My pussy may have been well lubricated and ready to be pounded, but my asshole was still very dry and tight... I had only a few times before in my life tried playing with my ass, sticking a finger or two inside during lonely nights under my sheets in my dorm room. But this was way beyond that, and I screamed in pain as it pushed in and out of my twitching sphincter. Both its cocks were animalistically grinding away at my insides, its curved heads scraping away at my fleshy walls... The mix of pain, pleasure, and dark magic was awakening in me a masochistic streak that was causing me to fall further into lust.

>As I was losing myself, another creature wrapped a long, fleshy tentacle like appendage around my throat, yanking me up from the ground nearly choking me out. It tightened its grip on my neck, forcing my head up, my mouth open and my eyes to tear up even more. But before I could scream, the end of the tentacle forcefully made its way down my throat in one motion, causing me to gag immediately. It began to rhythmically pull in and out of my throat all while I choked, gagged and coughed...

>During all this, the pyramid man, stood on impassively, the only thing changing about him was his cock - slowly, it was growing erect…

0

>>Restrained as I was I couldn't do much beyond thrash weakly and sob, even as it felt like the... appendage... destroying my ass was growing bigger. There was some sort of fluid starting to seep from the The thing's cock, or at least that could be presumed, since asses didn't lubricate themselves and despite its increased girth the movement was getting slightly easier. My pussy too, was getting wet - though it wasn't my juices, but instead more of that seeping fluid, and though I hated this with a passion, I was grateful for the existence of that fluid at least for it was lessening the pain of the double-penetration somewhat - enough to try to think of a way out of this...

>>Or at least that's what I would've liked.

>>The creature sodomizing me stretched its neck up nearly five feet, rearing back like a great big snake, and what passed for its head split where its face should be like the petals of a flower revealing a fleshy hole. I tried again to struggle, but the neck moved too quickly, swallowing my head and neck down to my shoulders which were thankfully too wide.

>>I panicked, unable to breathe, and opened my mouth to scream, swallowing some of what it had for saliva before from the depths of the neck came a tongue almost as thick as the things in my pussy and arse, striking with lightning quickness while my mouth was open, singing in a single surge passed my lips, battering down my gag-reflex, and then fucking itself down my throat.

>>And still I couldn't breathe.

>>Was this how I die - fucked by monsters in some pit? I mean... I've had some experiences in the Wizarding World with weird creatures and plants and magical relics, but I never thought it'd actually -Kill- me...

>>But right now, I couldn't see a way out of this and the realization made the tears fall harder, not that they were noticeable, as the almost immediately mixed with the Thing's saliva…

>As all my open holes were being violated and abused, I could do nothing but curse the dark magic binding me with internal lucidity. If It had destroyed my mind completely, at least I wouldn't be aware of what was happening to me. Instead, I was forced to watch and feel the massive appendages abusing my freshly deflowered holes like I was some cheap piece of fuck meat.

>Even worse, I was forced to watch as my body eagerly went for more - my ass, freshly filled with some strange viscous fluid likely from the creature's cock, began to grind and bounce up and down of its own accord. My hands, meanwhile, blindly reached out until they each found free dicks attached to deformed manniquin looking creatures - both of them so enthusiastically jerking off the creatures it was as if I was dying of thirst and only those cocks could provide water.

>Tears flowed freely down my face as my mouth contorted into a twisted smile, all while the tentacle continued to ram down my throat. Just as I was beginning to resign myself to this... fate, a sudden stream of hot liquid burst forth from all the flesh currently filling my insides. My pussy and asshole filled wildly with what I could only think was semen, but it was my throat I was most worried about. The tentacle retracted out of my throat, exploading load after load as it did so, eventually leaving its mark all over my face, as I swallowed most of the semen, gagging all the way.

>I fell to the floor again, trying to catch my breath, but was cut short by a hand of some kind roughly shoving my face down into the pile of semen that had fallen from my filled cunt and ass. My body, acting on its own under the magic, began to lick and eat that spilled seed up, as if I wasn't allowed to waste any during this profane ritual. Slowly my tongue began to scrape that filthy cum into my mouth and onto my face, swishing it around to really savor the flavors. I wanted to die, but my body craved more, so as I was face down in seed, I lifted my ass up and spread my cheeks, waiting for the next thing to fill me.

>I saw behind me a creature like the one devouring poor Penny's head come to my ass - it opened into that infernal flesh flower and wrapped its mouth around my ass. I could feel its wriggly insides all over my thighs and ass. Suddenly, it shot two tongue like protrusions into both my now gaping holes. I could feel both tongues scrape around my insides, pushing the semen in. In my pussy, I even felt the tip of the tongue poke against my cervix - it suddenly pushed its way through, piercing my uterus, pushing all that liquid in as deep as it could go. I screamed in ecstasy as this sensation overwhelmed my only until recently virignal mind.

>Only one clear thought passed through my mind at the time - my body had to be made ready to receive the unholy cock…

>>My eyes rolled up into the back of my head as my vision started to tunnel. The lack of air was starting to get to me, but then before I could be given the gift of passing out and remaining unconscious or instead simply dying, the thing retracted its tongue from my mouth and then released my head. Copper hair, hair that had been tied back into its customary plait, was so matted down and filthy that it looked almost black, and the glazed look in my eyes faded as I took in a massive breath, filling my lungs with that decay and rot-filled air.

>>It might've smelt bad, but at least it allowed me to live.

>>The sudden influx of oxygen boosted my awareness and chief amongst that was pain from my sore jaw and nearly destroyed arse and pussy, but as I sat in the Thing's lap, my body shaking and moving from the violence of the thrusts, I spied my wand about 4 feet away.

>>My wrists were still being held captive, but I had done something like this before. I had been suspended in the crypt of Edraine the Egregious by his Special devil's snare. My wand had been just out of reach but I had managed to summon it to my hand and make my escape.

>>Pure desperation had enabled that magical feat - but if there was ever a time for desperation plays now was it. Sebastien had put it best when he said 'Magic requires intent and talent' and I had them both in spades. Doing my best to ignore the Things wrecking my lower body was hard, as was the knowledge that something hinky was happening to Heather to make her -enjoy- this but I just barely managed. I closed my eyes and grimaced, bringing up my magical energies and literally pushing them from my hand. It's said that a special connection exists between a wixen and their wand and that was proven true when I felt warm wood slap into my open palm at the exact same moment I felt thick goop fill both my arse and pussy simultaneously. I scowled and flicked my wrist, yelling,

Relashio!

There was a burst of bright light that I could see through my eyelids but I heard the creatures howl in anger, but their grip loosened enough for me to roll to the side, both cocks sliding from my bottom passages with a thick deluge of off-white monster-spunk that splattered on the ground in a gushing puddle.

>>Not waiting for them to react, I turned my roll into a wand movement and as I rolled to my knees I whipped my wand downwards and blasted out a Banishing charm that blew the one who had been sodomizing my gaped arse away. Fortunately the other two were close enough that they too caught the blast and were flung to the floor.

>>On the other side of the room, that strange giant of a man started walking towards me, his large blade being dragged behind him with a rusty scrape, so I swirled my wand and transfigured one of the downed Things near me into a second barrel of black powder, Banishing it towards the Tall Man who was engulfed in flames.

>>A Severing Charm decapitated the final Thing in my vicinity and I Dashed forward towards Heather, streams of white mist trailing behind me like the tail of a comet, and I hit with the force of one too, arriving with my wand already blazing with a brilliant white light that pulsed outwards, blowing all but the one tongue-fucking Heather's pussy and arse.

>>That one I Levitated and Banished towards the direction of the Tall Man, tossing a Bombarda along with him.

Heather!

>I could only stare with amazement as Penny managed to free herself and blow away the creatures violating us. When she magically threw the monstrosity eating away at my ass, both of its tongues were ripped out violently from both my holes, causing me to cum uncontrollably one last time. My hips bucked and spasmed violently and my eyes rolled to the back of my head as I sprawled out on the floor one last time.

>After a moment of this, the dark magic holding my mind finally seemed to fade, and I regained proper control of my body. I stood up as quickly as my wobbly legs would let me, and then once again brushed my now cum covered blonde hair out of my eye. As I looked around me, all the pain, shame, anger, and hatred that had been building during this whole ordeal finally bubbled over, and I managed to somehow summon my wand to my hand, only to begin casting curses wildly around me.

>My focus then drew towards the pyramid man, now set ablaze by Penny. Even fully engulfed in flames, the eldritch being was undeterred from his path and moved once again towards us, this time armed with an oversized sword. Digging in deep, tapping that overwhelming darkness now consuming the edges of my soul, I pointed my wand at the creature and uttered a phrase I wish I never had

AVADA KEDAVRA!

>With that, a massive green light burst forth from my wand, striking the creature in an impressive show of light and force, before finally causing it to crumple over. As it did, it began to dissipate into a foggy shroud, evaporating into the air around us. And as if on queue, the entire edifice around us began to contort and change on last time, before suddenly and violently ripping away, revealing an all too familiar surrounding…

>We were back at Hogwarts! Or more specifically, the clocktower courtyard. Both of us had little time to celebrate or even just take in what just happened - we were both stark naked and dawn was fast approaching, meaning students and professors would be out. I pulled Penny to the side and quickly cast the disillusionment charm on myself.

Penny... please don't tell anyone about what happened here, ok? I promise I'll tell you everything in time, if you want...
