![Charlotte](https://static.zerochan.net/Suigintou.full.2499109.png)
##Where do you live?
The Central City of Dunwich
##Cause of Death
Intentional Death+Stained Hands+Additional Trauma
>Charlotte was supposed to be invincible. Her parents would never allow anything or anyone to harm her, so how did HE get so close? Thankfully she doesn't remember much about that night anymore. Just being led away from her birthday party by someone with the most beautiful red eyes, the fluttering in her heart that still comes whenever she thinks of him, *something* being taken from her and leaving her too weak to stand and shooting him right between the eyes. The fact it all happened where she should be safest doesn't help the sting go away.
##Shadow Threshold
45: Abnormal
##Ship of Theseus
**Rage(Main Type)**
Enraged, Schadenfreude, Salem+, Basque
>She emerged from the experience stronger than ever before, with the power to take it out on everyone else. Able to call upon an aura of misfortune to drain the life of those around her and lay terrible curses on those who draw her ire.
**Paranoia**:
Propaganda+, Fright of the Known+, Imaginary Ghost+, Artificial Angel, Their Crafted Lies, No One+, Modern Phantom
>Unsafe, Watched, Weak. All things Charlotte was forced to learn she was. Fortunately the world is not entirely unforgiving to weak little girls, something noticed her and chose to watch over her. A Banshee from a long ago age, why is it here? And why would such an evil creature care about Charlotte of all people.
**Fear**:
Phobia, Hurt, Vampirism+
>A little gift to her from her attempted murderer, at least it helps her power her curses and any spells she successfully modifies.
(22 Trauma, 105 Shadow, 70 LS)
##Life Skills
Allowance, Parkour, Spider's Web, Social Butterfly, Firearm Training, Outdoors Survival, Beholder
>Echoes of the person Charlotte used to be. Even now she can call on that past to pretend she hasn't changed at all. Joining the innate traits she has the survival training her Grandfather forced her and her siblings into getting, she should probably remember to thank him for the gun.
##Possessions
Light Vehicle-Motorcycle
Light Firearm- 9mm pistol
Safe House+Consecrated Silver+Armory
>An old property her grandfather used to own and gave to her after she returned. Seems to be warded against the supernatural and came with a large supply of silver for some reason.
##OLD MANâ€™S DEATH SHOP
Strange Book
>An odd collection of pages~~*(it really can't be called a book)*~~ focusing on ectoplasmic creatures~~*(just call them ghosts)*~~. Includes information on how to summon, banish or destroy them. 
##Life Events
**Psychological Help**
>With parents lacking neither money nor concern for their daughter it shouldn't be a surprise that Charlotte received psychiatric help. ~~*(Seems they found a miracle worker)*~~
**Old Money+Deep Dive**
>The Cross Family, as expected of a family as old and venerated as theirs, holds a great deal of Influence and wealth. It's said(~~*by them*~~) that they were one of the families to arrange the second settling of Dunwich.~~*Why anyone would be proud of that is for someone else to answer)*~~.
**Summer Vacation**
>With her parents being the travelling type Charlotte never spent much time in Dunwich until her 'incident'. Oddly they always insisted on returning to that shit hole at least once every 3 months, even when they didn't intend to stay long. Charlotte was always happy to not have had to grow up here, even if she did enjoy spending time with Grandpa.
