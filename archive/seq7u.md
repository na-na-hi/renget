#->The Sky Man<-
##->By Writer Number Six<-
>It was a calm night, in just a week I would be moving to California for a position at a tech company in silicon valley. I was enjoying the final days I would spend in this small town, the roads that had long needed repaving, the old buildings turned into stores used by families that had lived here forever. I was excited, a way to get away here, to be out, to have am actual dating pool. I felt a slight sense of nostalgia for this place, not just the two room house I rented from my parents, but the town, even though I knew I shouldn't. Even if I was saying sorrowful goodbyes to people who would hate my guts if they knew i was gay. all this passed through my mind as I put my pictures and wall hangings in a cardboard box, haphazardly kicking it across the floor to the wall. Maybe it was good to leave this place? But why did I also want to stay?
>"welp, that's it for today" I sighed, the house felt empty, despite the fact had only packed one box, what difference did it make, I'd be lonely here no matter what, but I was still dreading how the house would echo when everything was taken out, I knew deep down that why I didn't want to leave, but I couldn't admit it.
>"I'll just be glad when I left this honkey ass town," I told myself.
>"won't that be just splendid?" a soft male voice said into my kitchen window.
>What the fuck? this didn't sound like anyone form town, my instincts kicked in and i grabbed a kitchen knife, real handy right? Especially in a rural area where there are more guns than people, I decided to try an defend myself with a knife.
>"Who's there!?" I didn't get a response, the thing was huge, it crawled through the small window opening, grunting and heaving, a carved and lean muscled body, expansive wings. When it landed on the floor it stood, the air stank of unwashed animal, wet fertile soil, and dead leaves
>"Greetings human." he said to me.
>I froze, the smell was awful, that's what I noticed first. he had the head of a bird, with feathered wings, but the body of a bat. I had fallen backward to the ground, dazed at the sight of an all black feathered and furred adonis, naked, piercing me with large beady red eyes. 
>"St- stay back! I have a knife!" 
>He squated down.
>"If I really had the inclination," he began, "I could with little difficulty," He brandished his claws, his beak getting close to my face, he almost brushed me with his thick neck fluff.
>"...Cut you to shreds with my ten knives to your measley one" he backed up, sitting cross legged.
>"I have been watching you for a few months now, i know you'll be gone soon so I was wondering if I could ask you something?"
>"First!" I said angrily, "you've been watching me for months??! And second, you break into my house smelling like garbage, get dirt everywhere, scare me and threaten me, and now you just want to have a conversation with me?!"
>He stammered, "W-well when you put it like that..."
>I examined him again and tuned him out, not too shabby, and his cock had to be at least a foot, hooded and a thick, was I desperate (and horny) enough to let tolerate him a little longer? 
>"You're lucky you're hot, what you question?" I told him apprehensively, interrupting what ever lame excuse he was giving, still holding the knife.
>"You find me h-?"
>"Ask you question already!"
>"Well, I was wondering..." Hmm.
>"If you could..." He's definitely gonna ask for a blowjob or something isn't he?
>"Show me how to bathe?"
>"What?" I didn't expect this at all?
>"You see, I've seen other animals bathe themselves in rivers and streams before but I have never been able to do it right myself, I don't understand how I'm suppose to just immerse myself into the water and come out clean? but you humans look like you don't have any visible dirt on you most of the time? Especially you, I've seen you do it before, a few times actually"
>"Wait, seriously?" dirty chimera breaks into my house, admits to stalking me and watching me shower, and only wants bath? I don't buy it
>"If you've seen me do it can't you do it yourself?"
>"Well, I..." he sighed, exasperated "Can you just please help me human?" huh, I knew there was a second motive here, can't say I mind though. I laughed
>"Well if you insist, I'd love to help you out, but I need to ask *you* a question."
>He looked relived "I am grateful human, what's your question?"
>"Are you... Mothman?"
>"That's what you humans call me." he winked at me, "but you can call me... hmm I haven't conversed with anyone in ages what is my name?" I felt kinda bad for him, unwashed, forgetting his name, down bad enough to break into my house to "shower" with me or something.
>"Here, we can worry about that later, shall we?" 

>I got up and gestured towards my bathroom. 
>I guided him to the large tub in my bathroom, it had once had a shower bench for the old biddy that lived here before, so there was room for him, I turned on the water and made sure it was warm enough.
>"Here, get in, it's nice and warm for you," I smiled at him 
>He hesitated before saying "There isn't anyway you couldn't get in with me to help me? I mean, we have seen each other in the nude before, so it won't be to strange, right?" I mean this was already strange but, hey, I couldn't say no to a good time.
>"I guess it wouldn't be weird, sure why not?" 
>He got in and immediately dirt started to wash off,  turning the water a sickening black that gluged down the drain. I disrobed, I would have had a massive boner raging under my clothes if he didn't smell like dumpster racoon. He however, was rather "excited" by having my naked body within reach, very passionately excited as I could tell by the python standing at attention from between his legs. 
>"I've always been fascinated by my spices and human's shared genital structure!" He said. He definitely hadn't been up to date on the modern American English dialect for a long time.
>I sat in front of him he stared at me longingly, I poured a ton of shampoo into my hands and pressed it into his chest. He winced
>"So cold..." Is all he said, I moved my hands in circular motions, using my fingertips and a bit of pressure. I was scrubbing off what had to be years, if not *decades* of stuck on dirt, and still some of it wasn't coming off, I used the removable shower head and washed off the suds.
>"Here, hold on, we need something more heavy duty"
>"Heavy... duty?" The drenched bird bat queried.
>"Oh, I mean I need something with more cleaning power." I got out of the tub, leaving small puddles with slurries of dirt along the way, retrieving the dish soap for the kitchen.
>"Here, this is what we need."
>"Is it as chilling the other liquid stuff?"
>"No, I don't think so, you'll be fine!" I smiled at him.
>"Ok then..." He said hesitantly.
>I put considerably less into my palms as the shampoo, rubbing more sensually too, letting the soft oily soap rub over his muscled chest, feeling his pectorals and nipples. He seemed to really like this, letting out soft mmm's, so quiet as to almost hum, before I gradually sped back up to my old pace, deciding to stop indulging and properly clean him. His chest looked bleached compared to the rest of his body, being a crisp off white, still stained from all the years of dirt. His nipples, and the color of his skin more generally, was pink, though, as I moved the fur back I saw his skin to be a softer shade, compared to the more intense pink of his nipples.
>"Oh my! Isn't that just peculiar? I haven't seen my fur like this in ages!" He said looking down at his chest.
>"I know right! Now for this next part I need you to close your eyes ok?"
>Starting with his chest may have been unwise, seeing as I would have to watch higher parts of his body and the filth would just trickle down. I washed his head and explained to him, no, dish soap can't clean your eyes actually, so keep them closed please?
>By now the drain was getting clogged from clumps of matted hair and loose feathers, so I had to start bagging all of it, along with all the other stuff that would fit down the drain, suck as small rocks, sticks, and leaves.
>I knew my hands would be dry by next morning from using this soap but it would definitely help him out a ton. So I continued, washing the fluffy neck, this is where most of the matted clumps came form. His arms were easy, the wings were fine, just in need of a finer touch than the rest of the body, his talons were naturally black, and was surprised to find out his hands were fleshy, with pink skin underneath, and slightly more padded hands compared to humans. I thoroughly enjoyed cleaning his abs, muscled perfection in my book.
>"Hey, is it ok for me to wash your dick or...?"
>"M-my phallus?"
>I sighed "Yes."
>"Wash everywhere you see necessary human, no where is off limits," he stared at me again, those wide eyes, lustful, but having last seen humans in a more prudent era he didn't out right state how horny he was. He placed his hand on my shoulder, nudging me a little closer to him, he was ready.
     
>I wrapped my hands around the 10 pounder in front of me. I put my forehead on his chest, using his cleaning as almost a meditation as i stared down at his dick. He was very sensitive too, squirming and spurting as I exposed the vibrant pink head that faded into his natural tone as went down to his shaft. My head being right on his chest I felt every little breath he let out, he put his arms around me, resting them on my back. while lathering his balls, also not covered in fur he, let out an unexpectedly loud moan, which startled both of us
>"Sorry," he said, "I haven't been with any like this in... a while."
>"It's fine," I have a little peck on his beak 
>"Oh my, th-thank you human!" He managed to get out, flustered even more.
>"You're very welcome"
>finished with his inner thighs and rinsed him off. I knew I was going to have even more fun with this next part.
>"Can you turn around? On your knees or all fours, what ever is comfortable for you." He complied, getting on his hands and knees. I cleared the drain of more stuff before continuing. I lathered and scrubbed his back as usual, then I took extra care kneeding and massaging his fat muscled ass, he let out hums of comfort. I rubbed his hole with deep strokes and was soft on his taint, he squirmed and squealed. he finally said, after being rinsed:
>"Human,your intentions are beyond clear! I cannot wait until this bath is over, please make love to me!"
>I wasted no time getting some lubricant from my room. I came back, he was mostly clean, I was worked up by this point, and was already lubing my cock by the time I got back in the tub. I warmed him up my riming him, which he didn't expect.
>"Oh!" He arched, clinging to the wall like he wanted to get away, but his butt kept pushing onto my tongue anyway. He could control his vocal chords as I started to stick my tongue inside, before taking it out with a satisfying pop.I was ready to enter.
>I turned off the water, I out my hands on his waist, I was worried his wet fur would begin to get cold, but I was proven wrong when heat started to emanate from his body. he was warm and comforting to hold. before I slipped I hugged him from behind, feeling him up as I got closer.
>"I'm glad you enjoy my figure human..."
>I pushed in, he definitely had some experience with dick before, but he was still tight, he only got super excited when I started pushing on his prostate, slow fucking him as he arched again, I wanted to be in that moment forever, sharing this sensual loving moment with the only person I've liked enough to be with in my life. I had dreamed of something like this, but being deep in his guts listening to him try sputter out words and only hearing noises of bliss was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. Eventually my pleasure began to ferment into lust, I started to fuck him harder, aiming right for his prostate, I grabbed his dick with two hands, his pre enough to lube him up, he threw his head back, unable to control his face as he sank deeper into the act. He came with force, his dick spasming in uneven pulses, he was too pent up not to end up painting the shower wall, I tried to keep going but the squeezing he was capable of with his muscled glutes sent me over the edge, I came inside him, he milked me half to death and I enjoyed every second of it.

>After we both caught our breath, a stopped panting i turned the water back on, washing his legs should have been one of the faster parts, but we kept stopping to kiss on each other and nuzzle and hug each other. After I got him mostly dry and cleaned everything up, I laid towels on my bed to absorb the rest of the water, I clung to him and woke up in the morning in the arms of a slightly damp but comforting man.
>"I'll help you pack," he said "it's the least I can do for you, after you generous care and hospitality, you don't seem to be an antiquarian, so it should easy."
>"What's a..? Nevermind, uh," I paused "that's right, we haven't introduced ourselves, I'm James, and you can be..." The now white creature pulled a spoon out of a drawer
>"What's this James?" He said
>"It's a spoon," I said
>"Strange, could that be my name?" He said, excited.
>"I guess if you want it to?" I said with a mix of confusion and laughter
>*Did I still want to leave?*

##Epilogue
     
>I get home from work, the house is clean, and Spoon is wearing an apron and nothing else sleeping on the couch, something he made is in the crock pot, the walls of our apartment decorated with things he finds on night flights, just a few so far. I was so glad he was living with me now, after that night he stayed by my side.
>"Oh, I didn't mean to wake you," I said, seeing him stir away as I entered the house.
>"Oh no it's fine, I'm glad to see you, did you enjoy your electric box bard job today?" He asks a bit groggy
>"Yeah, and honey, It's called a computer programmer, I can't believe it's been a month here and you still don't remember?"
>"Well, I'm still perplexed by your new human society, so sometimes I forget"
>"And we have a big bed so you don't have to squeeze onto that little couch? Did you forget about that too?" I said jokingly
>"I'm embarrassed to say that I did actually, would you like for me and you to go there? Maybe... 'fool around' as you say, before dinner?"
>"Yes please!" We both made our way to our bedroom, I was tired but knew we both needed this, as he lost tore off my clothes I knew this was more than I could have every wanted out of life, I loved him.
