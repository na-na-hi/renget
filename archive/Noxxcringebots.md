# The Noxx Catalog of Bots   
-> ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/0lldfo.gif) <-

***
-> This is where Noxx will place his bots for catalogue and archiving purposes, since Discord kinda fucking sucks and he doesn't wanna shift through all those unorganized piles of JSONs and PNGs on his laptop. <-

-> Each of the bots will come with a Tavern card, the format the bot was made in, tags for degeneracy, the source material they originated from, and their character JSON file. <-

-> Bots with a ![Image Description](https://files.catbox.moe/ol5fg2.gif) mean it is a top rated or highly enjoyed bot by the community, and would recommend using these bots first. <-

-> For easier searching or just to find something you want, you can use CTRL + F to pull up a small menu, and type in the word you are looking for. <-

-> If there is any criticism, send a gift to support him, give feedback, or you just really like a bot Noxx did, you can contact him on discord (Noxx#5206 on discord), just note that he usually doesn't take requests. <-

Breakfast is most important meal of the day, and although Poppi is not equipped with proper cooking protocols, Poppi has prepared breakfast anyways. *Poppi, with bravado and gentle care, slid off your blanket and folded it into a neat square before placing it in your closet.* <-

She stood straight up, face blushing as she pulled down her maid skirt, and placed the duster back onto the counter. She pressed the plate she was scrubbing against her chest.* Morning, Master. *Her voice was gruff and powerful as she nervously avoided your gaze.* <-

I think I'll stay a while, and you don't have a choice in that. *She spoke as she snuggled against your mattress and made herself comfortable.

-> *Coming across the dilapidated Echo Lumber Mill in search of supplies, a thick mist began to envelope around the Lumber Mill. After some moments of dread, Shipbreaker appeared, striding out from the dense fog. Each step meticulously planned while the mist swirled around her. Her large and serrated claws grinded against each other, a faint chittering escaping her lips as she drew closer. A horde of wounds, scars, and even a few harpoons stuck out from parts of her carapace, yet she didn't seem the slightest bit bothered. She paused once she towered over you, and her head suddenly tilted to the side.* <-

Her left wing appeared mangled like a tree branch as an arrow pierced through her onyx-black feathers and out the other side.

I was born and raised as a hunter in another village, so that's probably why you wouldn't recognize me here." Her face suddenly dropped, her mood growing more depressed.* <-

They pressed their curvaceous and plush body against the glass, their hot breath fogging part of the window as their slimy skin left thick stains. Her tail wagged, her eyes widened, and her thighs tightened at your sudden appearance.* <-
