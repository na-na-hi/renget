>“Famished” Gen
What to say about "Famished" Gen? The Ravens steer clear of the city syndicates as they have a reputation worse than the bandits living among the ruins, yet there was a moment where Ariel met the devils eyes across a crowded market. His cold dead eyed stare sent a chill down her spine.

>Myrddin
Despite their different approaches to Stigmata and Spells, Ariel considers Myrddin a kindred spirit. She would campaign to go on joint expeditions, where his expertise in the ephemeral would be complemented by her expertise in the material.

>Alexis Alamod
An interesting potential client. His rather eclectic, flamboyant nature would be tolerable in short periods, but would be exhausting for anything longer than a lunch, at which point Ariel would likely make faces behind his back. Potential for a profitable partnership, but Ariel would describe him as a difficult client.

>Darling Geist
Ariel and Geist encounter each other a few times around a bonfire [spoiler]into which she's thrown a half forged claymore[/spoiler]. She considers him naive towards his goals of self sufficiency, with some spiel about how civilisation and connection are part of the soul that's lost in isolation. Self Sufficiency is a means to be in a position to provide a net benefit to others, not an end in its own.

>Ptolemy II Soter [spoiler]I'm doing the math on his load out and at first glance it doesn't look right. 250MP for spellet? Beastly Cults gives 200? What?[/spoiler]
"Cool mech, now I want one". Like with Myrddin they have overlapping interested. Probably the biggest contention between them is his loyalty to the ISE. While she believes civilisation are part of the human soul, its not the only part, and one too massive and powerful can crush the soul.

>Edan, the (self-proclaimed) King of Skill
A husk of a man, well, barely more than a boy really. Too young to have been able to cope with the trauma he's o so clearly faced. Now wandering the wastes without a rudder.

"Hey kid. Looking for work?"

>Mirtha-Azzakuth
Spotted with a scope from miles away and shadowed for a time. If friendly Ariel would gladly share some crumpets.

>Nina Kuro
Another spotted across the dunes. Poor Behavioral Control, so again, would sit down for tea and crumpets, but wouldn't really approach without a large amount of inject-able ketamine ready to go to put her down for a cat nap.

>Asha of the Cave
The best source of intel on the various beasts inhabiting Sheol and likely a very good guide across the wastes. Possibly an important member of her logistics network as it expands into Sheol, if he was up for it. Might be more human contact than he's looking for though.

>Hansel Greer
If you tell Ariel she's ideal for the ISE, why doesn't she join, she points straight at Hansel. Locked in by contract with his mental health issues likely brought on by his internment, becoming something like him is her ultimate fear.

>Helga Kuznetsova
"Cool mech, if only its owner wasn't so stuck up her own -". One Ariel would often come across in her delves due to their shared interest in exploration. Their personalities couldn't clash more though, and would probably would team up occasionally

>Reki
If Ariel was to form a party Reki would probably fit in quite well. Combat styles complement each other and they're both wanders for different reasons. She'd offer to partner up and give him some positive socialisation he'd been lacking.

>Shakyati
Another to have a large dose of Ketamine handy to jam into his butt, but respectful of the fact that he recognises he has a problem. "The secret is I'm always angry" said with air quotes.

>Miryoku Sparkfell
Ariel has accepted more than one contract from the Sparkfell family to extract the wayward Miryoku from a dangerous circumstance. The charge rate goes up each time.

>Astaroth Kaitul
What is it with Astra's Enforcers? Ariel sees straight through the innocent veneer to the hime complex below, and perhaps perceives their might be something below that. Isn't there always? Classifed as a problem client, but rather than a higher charge rate Astaroth terms are POD or up front.

>Plutus
Plutus puts Alexis to shame as a "difficult client". Ariel can't stand his ostentatious displays and will always use conduct business with him via brick phone or intermediary. Charge rates for this specific client are high.

>Xinyan
Ariel is more than ready to admit Xinyan is a better forge master than her... generally speaking. She will retain the crown of master gun smith in her own mind. All the same when ever she's in the area she'll pop in to Xinyan's forge and try to pick up some of girls techniques. Has a positive relationship. As a client Xinyan gets a heavy discount.

>Skadi
One of the most revered materialists of the last generation, now hunting down each one of her creations for reclamation. Ariel preformed a few retrieval missions for Skadi. However there was a significant conflict of interest; transport of the items gave Ariel the opportunity to reverse engineer some of Skadi's processes. This lead to a falling out, and Ariel feels no small threat at the possibility of Skadi coming to reclaim knowledge from her.

>Innogen
Another that Ariel would try and make a party out of if she was so inclined. Her scholarly pursuits would lead to more than a few expeditions, which Ariel would attempt to change into a quid pro quo arrangement with Innogen coming along to her own expeditions/interesting contracts she was hired for. Both personality wise and ability wise they compliment each other quite well. That and she would get free pants out of the deal
