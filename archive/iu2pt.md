What feels like hours later—though when you glance at the time on your phone’s screen, you see it’s been about fifteen minutes at most—you hang up with a long, heavy sigh. Your head falls back against the back of the couch, and you stare up at the apartment ceiling. That could have gone a lot worse, all things considered; Aldrich was eager to hear how you’ve helped Eleazar adjust to the human side, and seemed to greatly approve of the way you’ve been treating him. However, a few of the things he said still gnaw at the back of your mind.

You feel the couch shift as Eleazar sits down next to you. “Anon?” He sets a hand on your shoulder, and you break out of the swirling tempest of your thoughts to look over at him. You can see the concern in the low-burning sparks of his eyes, and give him a reassuring smile. “Who was that, if I may ask?” 

You tell him you were just reporting on how he was settling in to Aldrich.

“Aldrich?” The magus seems to consider for a moment, and then his eye-lights spark in remembrance. “Ah, yes, the other human accompanying you when you purchased me.”

Well really, he was the one to purchase Eleazar. And it was less ‘purchasing’ and more ‘getting him out of slavery’. You quickly continue on, clearing your throat. Aldrich actually wanted to set up a meeting with you and Eleazar; apparently, he has some business with the magus that he didn’t want to discuss over the phone. You watch Eleazar’s expression as you tell him that, but the magus’ skeletal face remains blank.

“I see. I wonder if…” He trails off, his amber eye-lights darting away from a moment, and then the magus shakes his head as if jerking himself out of his own maelstrom of thoughts. “’Tis no matter, at least at the moment. When did he wish to meet?”

Well, you tell him, he’s apparently busy all the rest of the day, and you need to head back to work tomorrow—the magus’ eyes flicker at the implication that you’ll need to leave him to his own devices while you do so—so the earliest time you could set an appointment for would be the upcoming Friday evening. In five—no, six—days, you tell him, when he continues to stare at you blankly. 

“Ah, I see. Then we shall have nearly half a fortnight to ourselves before then.” 

Yeah, you reply.

Silence falls between the two of you, the only sound in the room the noise from the TV. You know what Eleazar is waiting for; his words from earlier still resound in your mind, and set your heart pounding when you recall them. He deserves an answer, but you don’t know how to tell him what you’re feeling. Every combination of words you try to think up falls into a meaningless jumble. 

But if words aren’t enough, then maybe actions are.

Finally, you turn to face him. After calling his name and getting his attention back after it wandered off to the show playing on TV, you move to set both of your hands on his shoulders and turn him to face you as well.

“Anon?”

You hush him and, as your cheeks burn, you finally push forward to press your lips against the tip of his bony snout.

Eleazar freezes under your touch, and you feel his skull shift when his jaw falls open a bit and he takes in a sharp gasp. Finally, you pull away to give the magus a shy gaze as your hands stroke up and down from his shoulders to the base of his skull. Eleazar’s eyes are flickering in their sockets, like candle flames caught in a strong wind. When they finally steady, he lets out his held breath and his gaze locks with yours. “What… what was that?” 

A kiss, you tell him. It’s a way for humans to show affection. It’s one of the ways that couples show that they love each other. The heat in your cheeks flares as you stammer out that you aren’t completely sure if what you’re feeling for him is love, but you want to give things a shot and see how they go.  

“Love…” The amber lights in Eleazar’s eye sockets flicker out completely at the word. He stays silent for a long moment, as if in deep consideration, and then he nods. You jump as the bony tip of the magus’ snout presses against your hot cheek. Then he pulls back to stare at you once again. “Like that?” 

You nod, and tell him that was good. But there’s a way to kiss that’s more intimate, if he wants to try it with you.

Eleazar’s answer is immediate. “Yes, Anon, I do.”

Alright, then. You bite your lips and gulp. Then you tell him to open his jaw and put his tongue in your mouth. You know how weird it probably sounds to the magus, but he just nods and obeys. You watch as his jaw opens, and his pale tongue pushes out to hang in front of you; you never realized how long, strong, and dexterous it looks, and your mind sinks into perverse fantasy for a moment at all the things Eleazar could do to you with that tongue. 

Then your lips meet his teeth as the wet, wriggling muscle pushes into your mouth.

The kiss is awkward, to say the least. The shapes of your mouths are too different to fit together easily, and your own inexperience with this is readily apparent. However, as your hands stroke his shoulders, and his move to hold your sides, your eyes slip shut and you let out a low moan. He answers with a soft rumble as his tongue moves to explore the inside of your mouth like a timid guest. The tip brushes over your teeth and gums, and finally presses against your own tongue.

Then his tongue pushes further, lapping against the opening of your throat, and your breath hitches.

Eleazar quickly pulls away with concern burning is his flaring eye-lights. “Are you alright, Master? I didn’t hurt you, did I? Was it difficult for you to breathe?” 

You put a hand against his chest, stroking through the thin line of fur between his firm pectorals, and tell him you’re fine. Better than fine. You look downward, and his eyes follow your gaze to the damp tent you’ve pitched in your underwear. You really enjoyed that, you finally stammer out. 

A soft rumble of relieved laughter comes from the magus as he sets a hand on your thigh. “I am glad, Master.” His voice is throaty, husky, like it was the night before when he groped you while drunk. But this time, as his hand moves to cup your crotch, feeling the heat and pulse of your erection through the thin fabric of your underwear, you spread your legs to give him full access. “As both your servant and your companion in marriage, it is my duty to please you in any way that you enjoy.” Again, you could almost swear that his skeletal grin is a little wider than normal as he stares right into your eyes while lifting his free arm up. As in your dream, your face is drawn into the musky pit underneath like a magnet, and you press your nose into the sweat-damp tuft of fur while huffing his scent. 

You moan his name, your own voice weak and trembling with lust as you fill your lungs with the rich aroma of his body. Before you showered with him on that first morning together, his scent had been rank and stale, evidence of his time languishing in Mellegch’s slaveholding pens. But now, after cleaning up and spending a day and night sweating, his musk is strong, and pungent, but mostly clean. It tingles in your nose and makes you groan into his armpit as your hands finally begin to explore the magus. They rub at his chest and shoulders, taking a moment to caress his neck while his bony snout presses to your temple, and then down his sides to his hips. Your fingers clench in the fabric of his loincloth, and you finally pull your face away from him to meet his gaze while pushing your fingertips under the hem of it.

You don’t even need to say anything. He knows what you want. 

He rises up off the couch, and moves to stand between your spread legs as you sit up. His smooth stomach and loincloth-clad crotch are right in front of you, and you can’t help dipping forward to give the bulge in the cloth a long, deep sniff.

“Oh, Master Anon…” Eleazar’s own breath hitches, and his hands move to your shoulders. You look up to meet his gaze. He’s staring down at you, tongue lolling from his open jaw as he pants. His eye-lights are flickering. “Do with me as you will. Anything. Huff my scent as you please, and then use my body to pleasure yourself.” 

You shake your head and shush him. You’re a couple now, right? And couples pleasure each other when they have sex. You press a kiss to the cool skin of his belly, and then finally unwind the cloth from around his hips and let it fall to the floor. 

You’ve seen what the magus is packing numerous times over the past couple of days—how could you not, with how much he seems to like going around completely nude? But those were only quick, shy glances and peeks, giving mere impressions of Eleazar’s package. Now his bare crotch is right before your eyes, and he’s stroking your shoulders and murmuring encouragingly to explore him as you please. 

Well, if he insists. 

The first thing you stare at, open and lustful, are his balls. The orbs look massive in their loose, leathery sack as they hang low and heavy between his legs. Above his testicles, as you noticed before, is a long, taut-lipped slit. The thin line of wispy fur that runs down his front side is interrupted by the length of the opening, breaking off at its upper corner and then continuing down into a cute little tuft that mirrors the ones in his armpits at the bottom of his ballsack. The exotic scent of the magus’s sweat and musk curls into your nose from his crotch and sends your erection throbbing and pulsing in your underwear; the smell grows stronger, and gains a sharp, acrid, sour-sweet edge as you gently pry his slit lips apart with your thumbs. You glance up at Eleazar, watching him shudder and gasp, and then push your nose into the musky opening to take a deep hit of his aroma straight from the source.

“Master…” You feel Eleazar’s clawed hands cradling your head, holding you in place as your breathe in his musk and press your lips to the sweaty flesh of his ballsack. “Do you like my scent?” 

The husky, panting echo of his drunken, horny words from the night before makes your cock jump and soak your underwear even more thoroughly with your precum, and you nod into his crotch. You love his scent. If you could, you’d spend all day buried in his crotch. But there’s one more place you need to ‘examine’ on your ‘servant’. You suppress a grin as the magus lets out a soft whimper at those words; your suspicions are starting to be confirmed. Leaving those thoughts aside for now, however, you pull away from his crotch and look up at Eleazar, telling him to turn around and lift his tail.

“You wish to sample my scent even from there? Such an odd, perverse master I have…” His skeletal grin is definitely somehow teasing as he turns around for you. His tail hikes up, the tip going over his shoulder as he leans forward a bit. His ass, the firm globes that have tantalized you since your first morning together, are finally right before you. “Like this, Master?” 

You gulp, struggling to not blow your load right then and there. Just like that, you tell him, and you finally reach out to set your hands on his flanks. You rub over the curves of his ass, squeezing and groping the compact musculature under the giving flesh. Before, you would have only fantasized about doing something like this with Eleazar; but now that it’s happening, you can’t resist running your nose up and down his dank cleft, from the pungent pit behind his balls up to the equally-musky base of his tail. Finally, you peel his asscheeks apart to reveal the puckered entrance hidden within. 

His hole looks tight and pristine, and when you prod at the edges of his rim with your thumbs Eleazar trembles and lets out a soft whimper. “Anon, I’ve never… back there.” 

Wait, he’s a virgin? You thought he said the people of his home were really open about stuff like this. 

His voice drops into a shameful murmur, so different from his earlier bravado. “Indeed I did, but between masters and servants, it is the master who… gives, and the servant who receives.” He pauses, struggling to order his thoughts. “Though I’ve… learned to pleasure a companion with my mouth as an apprentice, my standing has kept me from fully taking on the receiving role.”  

Huh. You grow lost in your own thoughts for a moment. It’s embarrassing to admit, but you don’t really have much experience in that department either; you’ve fantasized plenty, and seen more than your fare share of porn, but that’s different from actually doing the deed with someone. Finally, you give his rump a tender pat and admit to him that you’re the same. But you can learn how to pleasure each other together; that’s what couples do, after all. 

It’s admittedly pretty cheesy, but the words have the desired effect on Eleazar. He relaxes and lets out a wistful sigh. “Oh, Anon… I truly don’t deserve a master as gracious as you—“ He takes in an abrupt, hissing breath as you press your nose right against his rim and take a deep sniff. “And so earnest, too.”

You moan in agreement, and finally bring your tongue to bear; it laps over his taint and up to swirl over his pucker as your nose presses against the base of his tail. The taste, like the scent, is strong and spicy, and tingles on your tongue as the damp muscle presses against his ring. Eleazar’s hole feels tight, too tight to let you push through, and so you content yourself with licking at the magus’ pulsing entrance.

Eleazar groans, his shaking legs finally collapse, and the magus grunts while falling to the floor in a boneless heap. 

You immediately jump up to kneel beside the magus, asking if he’s alright. He moans out an answer while pushing himself back up to his knees, and turns to look to you. “I’ve never felt anything like that, Anon.” Eleazar hesitates, and then surges forward to wrap you in a tight embrace. “If that is what receiving feels like, then I shall gladly play the role for you.” You start to tell him that he doesn’t need to feel obligated to do that, but Eleazar shushes you while pressing the tip of his snout to your cheek and then into the crook of your neck. “As your servant, it is my duty to pleasure you in any way I can. But as your companion…” He pauses, and then his tongue flicks against your throat and makes you jump in the magus’ embrace. The magus huffs out a soft, tender laugh, and does it again while stroking your back. “I want to please you. I want to have sex with you, Anon. I want your body, just as much as you want mine.” 

Well then, what are you waiting for? You smile and take the magus’ hand in your own, then stand and move to lead him to the bedroom. However, he stays kneeling on the floor, and a tug from his surprisingly-strong arm stops you in your tracks and brings you back to him. You ask the magus what’s wrong; Eleazar just smiles up to you as he grips your hips and dips down to press the tip of his snout to the base of the tent in your underwear.

“A moment, Master. It is not proper for your servant to leave you clothed when you are prepared to take him.” He tugs your underwear down while you watch, your hands going to the crown of his head. Your cock finally bobs free, hard and throbbing. Eleazar stares for a long moment, seeming to examine every inch of your human package, and then finally presses his bony snout against it to take in your scent. His jaw open, and a shiver runs up your spine at the admittedly-intimidating sight of so many sharp teeth so close to such a sensitive area. Then his tongue caresses your shaft, runs along it from base to tip and wraps around it, and whatever worries you had fade away. Your fingertips massage the base of his horns and your head falls back in pleasure as a long, low moan escapes your lips. He certainly does feel experienced by the way his tongue swirls around you, lapping over the tip and teasing under the ridge of your glans. You let out a surprised gasp when his tongue tugs you forward into his humid maw, and the head of your cock sinks into the tight opening of his throat. He looks up at you, giving your balls the same treatment he gave your shaft; lapping and licking and caressing them with his tongue. 

You whine his name and have to push him away by the shoulders to free your pulsing cock.

“Apologies, Anon. Was that unpleasant?” No, you tell him, it was very pleasant. Too pleasant. Feeling your cheeks burn, you admit to him that you almost came from that. He laughs, soft and gentle, and begins to rise up to his feet. “We cannot have that, can we? It is improper for you to plant the first seed of our union anywhere but within me.” 

As he stands, his hands grip the hem of your shirt and lift it up. You raise your arms to let him pull it off, leaving you completely nude before the magus, but when you move to lower them back down he stops you. Eleazar drops your shirt on the floor and dips down to press his bony snout into your armpit. You can hear the magus sniffing slowly and deeply, and your cock throbs as you ask if he likes how you smell.

Eleazar hums in thought, and takes a few more considering sniffs. “It is odd. But not unpleasant.” He looks up at you, one flaring eye-light meeting your own gaze. “Never before have I considered the… scent… of my fellow magi’s bodies, but your scent, master… I like it.” He pushes his snout into your other armpit, nuzzling into the musky, hairy flesh and sighing as you stroke his skull. “May I huff your pits when it pleases me to do so, Master? No… Anon?” 

He can huff wherever he likes, you answer with a tender smile. Your heart pounds and your cheeks burn, and it takes a moment to get your next sentence out. If his body is yours, then your body is his.

“Anon…” Eleazar finally rises up completely, and moves his snout down to your face, his jaws open. You can smell your own sweat and musk on the bone, and your lips part as his tongue pushes into your mouth. You both taste each other in a long, slow kiss, gradually growing more comfortable with the way you have to turn your heads to fit together. 

Finally, you take the magus’ hand in your own and lead him into the bedroom. He follows eagerly, eyes flaring and flickering as his gaze remains on you; even as he moves to crawl onto the bed—the entire space shifts and expands to accommodate his bulk—he continues to look at you adoringly. He positions himself on his hands and knees, tail hiked up and settled over his shoulder; it would be nice to take him on his back so you can see his face, but you quickly realize that his long, curving horns would make the position uncomfortable for the magus. 

That’s probably why Eleazar always sleeps on his stomach, now that you think of it. 

You move up behind him on the bed, and the firm globes of his ass twitch as you grasp them and give them an appreciative squeeze. He pushes his chest down and his hips up higher, presenting himself to you. You could spend forever gazing at the sight before you—the tightly puckered hole twitching between Eleazar’s spread cheeks, and the heavy ballsack swinging and swaying between his thighs—and you’re tempted to bury your face in the magus’ ass once more. But at the same time, you don’t want to drag this out any longer; you’re both ready, and willing, and wanting. 

But as your cocktip presses against his entrance, ready to sink inside, you realize you’re forgetting something.

With an embarrassed blush, you tell Eleazar that you don’t have any lube—you’ve never really needed it, since you’ve only fantasized about having sex like this so far. He answers with a quiet chuckle, and cranes his neck to look at you with one eye-light. “Worry not, Master. Your servant is prepared to take you. Do not hesitate.” He rocks back against you. “Push into me. Claim me.”

The heat in his voice spurs you on, and you push forward. You gasp as your cockhead finally breaks past his tight ring, and then your shaft sinks into his hot, clinging, moist depths.

Wait, moist?

You look down at your cock as you pull it free from Eleazar’s hole, a little afraid of what you’re going to see. Your shaft looks like it’s coated in a thick, slick, gel-like substance; the scent rising up from it is pungent, like his musk, but clean. Again, Eleazar chuckles, and you look back to the magus’ grinning face. “I told you, Anon, we magi have bodies made of magic itself. As such, we are able to manipulate our forms, at least to some extent.”

So he’s self-lubing. That’s kinda hot.

He nods, and then rocks backwards again, impatient. With your confidence restored, you push back in to hilt inside of the magus’ tight passage. His inner walls, slick with that lubricating substance, engulf and massage your cock, and the magus grunts and groans as he squeezes down around you. You remember that it’s Eleazar’s first time, and so you stay still within the magus to let him adjust to the feeling of having you inside of him. You lay yourself atop him, you chest on his back, and press delicate kisses to Eleazar’s shoulders and the nape of his neck—his breath hitches and he clamps down on your cock when you touch him there—while wrapping your arms around him. You caress his chest, following the trail of fur down his stomach with your fingertips, and finally come to the lips of the magus’ slit. You rub over it, tease it, let your fingertips sink inside, and Eleazar whimpers. 

“Master, stop…” You freeze, and look to the magus. He’s panting, tongue lolling out, but there’s an almost-desperate look in his flaring eye. “It is… improper for a servant to show his genitals while he’s pleasuring his master…” 

Again with that. You press another kiss to Eleazar’s shoulder, and continue letting your fingers reach into the hot, wet depths of the magus’ slit. He isn’t just a servant, remember? He’s your companion. Your friend. Your lover—your blush grows hotter at that. And you want to feel him—to pleasure him—while you make love to him.   

“Lover…” Eleazar takes a deep, shuddering breath and lets it out in a heavy sigh along with a quiet mewl of your name. You finally feel what you’re searching for; the tip of something firm begins to push out from his slit, forcing your fingers out as it slides free of its hiding place. You grasp the thing—Eleazar’s cock—and feel it throb in your grip as the magus trembles and moans. You want to see it, to finally look at what Eleazar has, but doing so in this position would be really awkward to pull off; so, you settle for feeling over the magus’ erection while you begin rocking your own in and out of him in slow, shallow thrusts. Eleazar’s cock feels as large as the rest of him, thick and girthy and inhuman; you can feel odd bumps and ridges along the shaft, which leads to a sharply-tapered tip. “Do you like it, Anon?”

His voice is trembling, apprehensive, and you reassure him with a heated kiss to the nape of his neck—and are rewarded with his inner walls clamping down around your pulsing cock again. You love his cock, you tell the magus. You love all of him. You want to make love to him, fill his ass with your seed and suck his cock afterwards. If he wants, you think you could try bottoming for him, you say with a husky moan. Eleazar listens to your lustful ramblings, adding his own rumbling and crooning to the chorus of your voice as you settle into an easy rhythm. You push forward into Eleazar’s hole, and he presses back against you. You pull back, drawing yourself free of the magus’ passage, and his inner walls clench around you while he thrusts his cock into your own squeezing grip. Again and again this repeats, the magus submitting himself to your pace as your words trail off into huffs and moans of pleasure. 

You’ve fantasized, but never realized just how good sex could actually feel. The tight heat engulfing your cock, caressing and milking it with every movement of your hips. The feeling of another’s body beneath you, warm and panting as you pleasure him. The sound of Eleazar’s whimpering and groaning and passionate sighs. The rich aroma rising from your bodies, sweat and masculine musk and sex, filling your lungs and fogging your mind. 

You begin to go faster. Harder. Spurred on by Eleazar’s cries of pleasure as you pump his cock in time with your thrusting. “M-Master! If you don’t stop, I will… I will…” He’ll cum? Good, you tell him; you want him to cum. You want Eleazar to moan out your name while you push him over the edge. You feel your own orgasm building up, the heat and pressure in your balls and crotch winding tight like a spring that’s ready to snap.

The magus cries out your name, and you feel his cock throb and something thick and sticky splash against your hand as you squeeze his tip. His inner walls clamp down around you, strong and vice-like, trying to hold you in the magus’ depths. You thrust a few more times into that tight embrace, gritting your teeth, and the spring finally snaps. You orgasm as well, your seed erupting deep into Eleazar.

You fall, together, over the edge of bliss.

When your swirling mind finally pulls itself together, rising up from the abyss to float on the warm tides of afterglow, you find yourself collapsed on top of Eleazar. The magus is lying on his stomach beneath you, trapping your arm against his still-pulsing length and cum-slickened belly. He moans and coos out your name, his eye-lights extinguished and his jaw slack as he pants. Slowly, reluctantly, you pull your own softening cock free of his passage, which clutches weakly at your shaft as if trying to keep it inside. Then you carefully crawl up Eleazar’s body, pulling your arm free from beneath him and stroking his sides as you press a kiss to his cheekbone. Amber light flickers to life in his eye socket, and he lets out a breathy moan while craning his neck to look at you. “Amazing.” Eleazar shifts underneath you, one hand moving to find yours, and you entwine your fingers with the magus’. “You are amazing, Anon.” 

So is he, you reply as you rest your chin on his shoulder. So, this makes it official; you’re a couple now. 

He nods, weak and tired after the earth-shaking orgasm you just gave him. “Indeed. We are companions. Lovers.” His eyes flicker and he hums softly, but you catch his attention again with another kiss. “Mas- Anon. I wish to pledge myself to you. Body and soul. Like you said earlier.”

What, like a marriage?

“Indeed.”

You blush at that, and kiss the nape of his neck—again he grunts, moans, and his eye-light wavers. You’ll have plenty of time to talk about where your relationship is going to go. You have an entire week together, after all; just you and him.

Eleazar hums in assent, and his eye-lights flicker out. When he speaks next, his voice is soft and quiet, shy once more. “May we stay like this for a while yet, Anon?” 

Sure, you don’t have any problem with that, you answer while you stroke and pet between his horns with your free hand. Eleazar rumbles with bliss, and you settle atop him to listen to the slow breathing and pleased murmuring of the magus. Your magus. Eleazar, your lover.
