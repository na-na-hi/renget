Ah, a hole in the wall that serves good drink. Hel's favorite. Her service with SSS was already paying out in dividends, both literally and figuratively. She'd arranged to meet for drinks here with a couple colleagues from the Matryoshka to celebrate their paychecks, and had arrived a bit early. Nice guy named "John" had recommended the place. Being the first one to arrive, she naturally decided that it couldn't hurt to pregame just a little bit. Just a teensy-tiny bit...

>->[Hours Later]<-

"Huuh... they're running kinda late..."
Hel sat with her head down at the bar with an almost comically large (and nearly empty) mug of alcohol, lazily eyeing some kind of sports match playing on the wall of the bar to her left. She had no idea what the rules were, but it looked like quite an entertaining game. These big ol' dudes in lightweight power armor would knock around a giant ball with these huge hammers, until they'd score on the other team's goal. Or hoop. Or something. Whenever it cut to announcers or ads, a big flashy "HAMMERJACK" logo would cross the screen, so she figured that had to be the name of the sport.
"Huuuuhh... I bet I'd make a damn good hammerjack player... hm, hm..."

The bartender stood out of her peripheral vision pretending to wipe down a mug. He was staring at Hel with worried eyes and morbid curiosity, his eyes continuously darting between her and her enormous mug. 
"You alright there, li'l lady? I think you might'a had more'n enough-"
She suddenly comes to life upon hearing his words, snatching her mug off the counter.
"No! I hav'n e'en finish' my drink! Lea'me 'lone!"
Hel sucked her teeth in exasperation and leaned away from the bartender, holding her drink close to her chest as if she expected him to jump the bar and yank it out of her hands. He deflated, accepting defeat and returning to whatever menial work was left for him behind the counter. Not that there was much, considering the bar was mostly empty. John had done a pretty good job of finding such a hidden gem out here, Hel thought to herself. Only other people in the bar was five rough-lookin' dudes huddled around a pool table in the corner, and they weren't doing much but taking the piss out of each other whenever they fucked up an easy shot or sunk the cueball. They eyeballed her all weird every now and then, but she figured that was just because they couldn't tell if she was eyeballin' them from behind her visor. She didn't really know why she insisted on wearing her visor so much, even without the rest of her suit; something about it just kinda felt "right" to her. Also hides the scars, so that's another plus.

Maybe in a way, the bartender was right. It'd been quite a while at this point; maybe it'd be best for her to finish her drink and head out. Could be that her co-workers got saddled with work last minute, or somethin' else. Could've been anything, really, the way Freyj was sometimes. Oh well. Either way, no point in staying any longer than she already had. She threw her head back and chugged the last bit of what was left in her mug, swaying in circles as drips of alcohol made their way down her chin; turned out there was a little bit more than she'd expected in there, oops. She slammed the mug down on the bar, letting out a triumphant sigh before jumping up from the bar stool and making her way to the bathroom.

"Might'az well piss 'fore I head out..."

The chunky metal door to the woman's restroom closes loudly behind her as she went and attended to her business...

"Yo. I know y'all see what I'm seein'. Whaddya think?"
"I dunno man. I'm down for anything. I don't care, y'know? We could do... whatever with her."
"Aw, man, don't be fuckin' weird. I'm sayin', y'all think we should run her pockets?"
"Yeah, could be a good move. She certainly drinks like she's fuckin' loaded."
"Sure does. Probably won't put up a fight either, not in that state..."
"Easy mark, right? I'm sayin', man. So, what, we get her when she come out the bathroom?"
"Yeah, fuck it. Bartender won't do shit. I'll make sure."

>->[A Few Minutes Later]<-

Hel stumbled out of the restroom, not looking where she was going. She ended up faceplanting right into the chest of one of the thugs, who immediately and unceremoniously shoves her straight back against the thick metal door she just came out of, nearly knocking her over. She steadies herself against the door and stands up straight, turning to take stock of her assailants. The one on the far right stood with his back to her, facing the bar. The other four huddled closely together to form a human wall that she couldn't walk past. All five of them were pretty big dudes wearing tacky-looking jackets covered in emblems and iconography she'd never seen before. The one watching the bar was by far the biggest, and had huge, scary-looking prosthetic arms. Probably some local gangsters or something, she thought to herself.  
"Huuh? What's yer problem, assholes?!" she slurred at them. "Lemme pay my damn bill!"

The rightmost thug not facing the bar spoke up.
"Forget about that, sweetheart. We got it. Just hand over your credchip and we'll take care of the rest, ya dig? Go ahead, get it out."

Hel looked at the thug like he had three heads, and stiffened up noticeably. "I'm not givin' you my damn creds. Now get outta my way, 'fore I..."

The middlemost thug stepped forward. "Look, bitch, quit fuckin' around. Give us the damn creds and..." he reached out to grab her by her jacket. It was the last mistake he'd remember making that night.

In one swift motion, Hel grabbed the man's wrist and pulled him down towards her. As he stumbled forward, she launched an absolute warcrime of an uppercut into the man's chin. The force was enough for his feet to leave the ground briefly, and he was out before anyone knew what happened. She kicked him in the gut as he fell for good measure, sending his weight rolling into the legs of his two comrades who were standing to his right, Hel's left. They fell back onto their asses with disbelief, stunned at what they'd just witnessed. The other two standing opposite of them were just as gobsmacked. Hel calmly stepped over the man's body and made her way back to her stool to pay off her tab. She slapped her credchip on the bar and slid it over to the man on the other side, whose expression had grown even more worried since the last time she'd looked at him.

"H-Hey! You fuckin' bitch, you can't just walk away from us!" one of the thugs on the floor yelled, scrambling to his feet. His right hand searched frantically for something tucked along his waistband, eventually producing a large black handgun. It shook violently in his hand; Hel was more afraid of the guy possibly taking out the bartender on accident than she was of him shooting her. She leaned lazily against the bar, wrapping her left hand around the handle of the big empty mug she'd left on the counter. "You want my creds? They're over here, bucko... com'n'gettem." Hel slapped the bar a few times, as if to make herself understood.

The gun-wielding thug looked to the two of his comrades who were standing by the bar, using a couple quick head nods to order one of them to go grab the chip. One of them obliges.

Hel leans forward and faux-whispers to the bartender. "This'ns gonna be on me, too..."
Then, she turns right to face the thug approaching her.

The gun-wielding thug pipes up, believing she means to take on his comrade. "Don't fuck around with us, bitch! I swear, I'll fuckin'-"
His words are interrupted by Hel's empty mug sailing directly into his jaw. A loud, dull "ping" is heard as the thick and heavy glass implement bounces off the man's skull. A second later, the sound of glass shattering can be heard in tandem with the sound of a body collapsing onto the floor. The approaching thug freezes before Hel, who now sits cross-legged with an elbow up on the bar. 

"Well? Y'still wanna try?"

He looks to the other one of his comrades who'd fallen on his ass, with a look in his eyes that told him to grab the gun their friend had dropped. 

"Oh, 'n don't reach for 'nymore guns. Y' do, I'll kill ya."

It was a bluff. Hel was out of easily-available things to throw, and wasn't packing any iron herself tonight. Still, the threat seemed to work well enough.

The closest standing thug almost says something, but is cut off as the metal arm of his compatriot shoves him aside.
"I'm gettin' real tired of this bullshit! Come here, motherfucker! You think you can fuck with us, bitch?!"
He bangs his fists together and begins to jog forward at Hel, winding up a mammoth left-hook. He swings his heavy prosthetic arm with enough force to puncture steel, but it's for naught. Hel swiftly leans back on her bar stool, and the momentum carries the thug's arm straight into the bar, burying it deep. She uses this opening to hit him with a demoralizing backhand as he struggles to yank himself free. "Sorry, big guy! Y'only get one shot."
As her palm comes back around, she slams the man's head into the bar with enough force to dent whatever metal it's made out of, and he's the next one out. His body hangs limply against the bar, his left arm still stuck in up to the tricep.

"So. How's 'bout it, you two? Feel'n lucky?"

The last standing thug says nothing, his hands raised in front of his chest in a defensive posture. The one on the ground stays where he is, not wanting to make any sudden moves.

The bartender slides the credchip back to Hel. She quickly snatches it off the bar and slides it into her pocket, hopping off her stool and quickly stumbling her way out of the bar. Drunk, on equal parts adrenaline and alcohol.

All is quiet for a moment before the one thug left on the ground picks himself up and hobbles over to his only other conscious compatriot. 

"Woah, man... that was.. that was fuckin' intense," he spoke. He brought his voice to a whisper and leaned in. "...is it just me, or was that kinda hot? I mean, she... she really-"

"Man if you don't-" he shoves him back, "-get yo' ass the *fuck* up out my face with that shit?! Call the boys, and then help me get this big motherfucker up out the damn bar! And not another fuckin' word till they get here, got it?!"

They were gonna need help carrying their friends out of the bar, and didn't know if any security forces were on the way. They had to move fast. The deviant thug nodded at his friend's orders, preparing to make the call for help. Still very hunched over for some reason, despite not having been hurt.
