#Owned Items and loot
##General
- The Phoenix spear: Crafted by Aurelia with titanium that does not transfer heat or cold. A phoenix feather was placed inside the blade with a small switch to open ports to allow the eternal mystic flame to burst forth. The artificial demoncore of Urizen was also absorbed into the spear. Allowing the wielder to use the weapons arka to cast with, and duel cast. As well as greatly increasing the strength of Elemental and Spatial magic used with it. This tier V artifact, is one of the great treasures of Cadenza.
- Silver coins: Magical tools created by Adalinda. When used by herself they create spherical barriers that sustain themselves for a day. Blocking physical, magical, and spiritual passage. Used by another who cannot support the level of spatial magic, the time is reduced to a few minutes before the coin shatters. These coins are strictly controlled and given out to individuals whom possess the skills and morals that would benefit Cadenza if they chose to live there.
- The Sorceress Crown: Rarely removed from her head. This crown has been one of the largest symbols of her rule since the country was founded. A tier III artifact that blocks the wearer from being affected by minor status effects. Additionally it creates a censoring effect over the wearers nudity. Altering perception in a variety of ways to impede the viewing anything lewd. (I am seeking to upgrade this item in some way)
- Shellphone: A literal seashell that has been enchanted with spatial magic by Domitian. Can connect with one or more other users for verbal communication.
##Onsen
- Rubber Ducky: Squeeze it to remove mind altering effects from yourself
- Reminisce Bomb: Put in water and bathe to see memories of the past
- Passion Bomb: Put in water to add a light aphrodisiac effect
##Fishing trip
- "The Righteous": An ornate noble's fishing rod that improves your affinity with aquatic races and has a chance to fish up random loot (Special effects only work for followers of Uzza)
- Cecaeliuma: Remy a 30ft squid girl, and 12 of her 10ft sisters whom now live in the gulf of Cadenza.
##Weasel Island
- A scroll of 'Anti-Magic Field': Creates a 10ft bubble around the caster where no magic can exist. Last 1 hour or if the caster stops.
- A purple berry and its seeds. Eating it causes one month of hair and scale growth.
- 3 Miniature dragons. Named Gawain, Gwenivere, and Percival.
- A Golden oak tree that grows in the middle of the capital park and the squirrel knight of RedOak who protects it. The mini-dragons have been trained as mounts for these small knights.
- Captain Claw: A 10ft lobster monster that now lives in the gulf of Cadenza with the Cecaeliuma
- A large amount of titanium scrap metal alchemically altered to not transfer temperature of any degree. (used in spear)
- Alphonese: An undead badger alchemist who centuries ago used to be a man. Is now the head of alchemical research in Cadenza free to research projects that will increase the well being of people all across harahel.
- A phoenix feather that forever emits unbearable flames that burn without fuel (used in spear)
- Artificial Demoncore fragments (4): Can be stabbed into a person or creature to remove their soul, or place a soul into something else.
- 12 fist sized Diamonds.
- The diary of the phoenix woman (on loan from Cassandra until one of us remembers)
- A Metal Safe: Completely immune to magic and absorbs away all arka touching it. The lock is also of the highest quality.
- Several books and tablets along with special fertilizers that give knowledge on how to grow crops in any terrain.
##Hellgate
- Demonic Dynamo (Urizen): A manufactured demoncore imprinted with a fake soul. This particular core contains the fictitious Demon Architect, Urizen, A wise and flattering personality. It also greatly increases the strength of Elemental and Spatial magic used with it. (used in spear)
- A great many person size shards of crystal that retains elemental magic and radiates strong heat for long periods of time.
