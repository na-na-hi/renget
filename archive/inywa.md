#Look At What You've Done!

Sunny lay in bed, not quite asleep, not quite awake, he supposed that was a good way to describe his life now. The darkness of the room was a small comfort in a way though, soon he'd drift away and escape this all, he knew his friends were waiting for him just beyond that white room, any second now...

Knock knock knock

His eyes shot open. It was strange, the knocking was close, not the front door as usual, but his bedroom door. He stared at the boor with a sense of unease, hoping it'd been his imagination.

Knock knock knock

It wasn't his imagination, someone... Or something... Was pounding on his bedroom door. It was IN the house this time. 

Knock knock knock

"Sunny! You locked the door again silly! Come let me in."

It was certainly the voice of Mari, but there was a problem. Not with her voice, she sounded as he always remembered her, but there was just one small issue, Mari died. Sunny simply lay there, this had to be just some sort of nightmare, he ignored the knocking, Mari asking him to let her in. It grew steadily, knocking became banging and shaking, asking became screaming and demanding. He just closed his eyes and lay still, willing himself to end this dream. 

And then something brushed his face.

He opened his eyes and saw Mari standing on the ceiling, her hair falling over his face. 

"WHY DIDN'T YOU LET ME IN!" Mari demanded

Sunny sprang out of bed and towards the door, but the lock wouldn't nudge. He struggled with it, frantically shaking and pulling the knob with all his might, fully aware that "Mari" was slowly approaching him, walking on the ceiling, her hair like moving tendrils ready to grab him when he was close enough. Just when it seemed all hope was lost and Mari would catch him the lock finally turned and the door flung open. Sunny sprinted as fast as he could, down the hall to the stairs, but just as he was about to descend he felt something grab his ankle just enough for him to lose his balance and went tumbling down.

He brought his arms up to protect his neck as he fell, the sharp corners of the steps striking him hard all over. His shoulders, his back, his knees and shins, his hips, it seemed the stairs went on forever, giving ample opportunity to strike Sunny just about everywhere. Finally he slammed down on the bottom. For a brief moment Mari was forgotten, he simple lay there panting, in pain, but it didn't feel like anything broke. He tried moving, but soon discovered that wasn't possible.

His entire body had become tangled up in something that bit into his skin like ropes, he tried to move his arms, then his legs, but every attempt just yielded a feeling of some strands digging into him. He look down at himself, and found that he was indeed completely restrained, in long, black hair. His eyes followed the strands to its source. Laying directly next to him was Mari, her long black hair strewn about everywhere and a single black eye poking out from her pale, dead face.

"See Sunny? Look at what you've done!" The dead face said.

Mari's limbs began to twitch and twist, her arms and legs stretching out of her night shirt, truly stretching, with a cracking crunching sound her arms and legs snapped into horrible dislocated positions and elongated to unnatural lengths. Finally one of her hands, now attached to an arm twice as long as it should have been, pressed against the ground; quickly after one of her legs snapped into a physically impossible position and pressed her foot on the ground, her knee backwards and jutting into the air. One by one her limbs contorted and twisted until her hands and feet were on the ground and she could lift herself.

Horrible as all this was though, it was watching her face that truly caused Sunny to begin screaming. As her hideously long limbs rose her off the ground her head stayed in place right beside the boy. Her neck cracked and crunched and groaned as foot after foot of it poured out over her shirt collar, she came off her hands and began straightening herself out and finally her two meter long neck stopped stretching. Her head began to lift as she rose further upright, and soon Sunny felt his own body being pulled up. Slowly the thing kept rising, until finally it had rose to its full height. Even with her broken, hideous neck with it's jutting vertebrae hanging almost loosely off her shoulders Sunny had been pulled off the floor completely, Mari must have been at least three meters tall just to her shoulders.

Sunny struggled against his bonds, screaming for help and crying as he simply bobbed and twisted in the air. Mari just ignored him and began to walk back upstairs towards their bedroom. Sunny saw his parents bedroom door open as the thing reached the top and screamed out for his parents to come help him. He saw his mother walk out and Sunny stopped struggling, absolutely frozen with horror, her eyes and mouth were just three black holes.

"This is what you deserve Sunny," she groaned out as Mari bent through their door.

Finally all at once the hair around Sunny seemed to untangle and he fell to the floor. Immediately he began to crawl backward until his back hit a wall, and then he just sat there. He didn't know what else to do, he couldn't even think, he was absolutely paralyzed in fear staring at his sister. He shoulders nearly reached the ceiling, her head hung down to her stomach, her upside down face was nothing more than two black holes and one gaping maw, and all her horribly long limbs looked broken and twisted.

"SSSssssuuUUUUunnyyYYY" the thing groaned out.

Oh god, oh god her voice! Like she was trying to speak through a crushed windpipe, through a mouth full of bile and blood, it sounded gurgled, pained, breathless. He closed his eyes to try to stop her freely falling tears and to try to stop himself from seeing this.

"I LOOOooooVVeeeEEE YYYyooooooooOUU!"

He felt a cold hand wrap around his ankle, and with a swift, powerful move pulled him from the wall. Quickly another hand grabbed his shoulder and pushed him flat against the ground. Against his better judgement Sunny opened his eyes again and came face to face with those hideous black holes, he swore he saw something moving inside them. Mari was kneeling over him, her twisted mockery of pianist fingers holding him in place. Sunny just stared, too scared to move, but then the real horror began.

Mari's night shirt simply seemed to decay within seconds before Sunny, leaving the thing now completely naked. Ribs jutted every which way, her shoulders seemed completely dislocated, and the shared turns in her spine cause her whole torso to look lopsided. To Sunny's horror, he noticed the creature had breasts, thought they hung at such a strange angle from her twisted torso they appeared strangely misshapen.

The things mouth began to open even wider, and wider, a gaping maw became just a giant hole, and now its head moved towards Sunny again. Sunny soon realized what it was doing and began to struggle, but it was pointless, and soon the creature had it's jaws around Sunny's face. Slowly it sucked him in further and further, and Sunny's entire head was inside its mouth. Sunny kept his eyes shut the whole time, he didn't want to see down this things throat, see his death.

"Sunny... Don't be scared, I'm here."

It was Mari's voice, her real voice.

Against all judgement Sunny opened his eyes and saw there was no throat. Instead, all he saw was what seemed like an endless of black hair stretching in every direction, his head was even poking out of some of the hair, and he could still feel the demons hands on his own back in his bedroom. He stared out into the black silky tangle and noticed something moving. A single pale face emerged from the hair.

"Hi Sunny! Glad you finally decided to join me!" It was Mari!... Kinda.

Her face was deathly pale, her eyes glassy, but compared to the monster before it was a welcome sight. Before Sunny could ask where he was though a pale hand rose out of the hair, much further from Mari's face, the hand grabbed some hair, and yet another Mari, just as pale and dead eyed as the first pulled her naked upper body out of the hair. The other Mari also rose further up, onto to her shoulders like the other, and Sunny soon realized that their own hair was connect to the mass, likely a part of it.

"I've been waiting so long for you." They both said in unison.

Sunny felt two hands grab the the top of his head and pull on him a bit, he felt his shoulders get pulled into the monsters maw and into this strange hair sea. Sunny looked up to see the face and arms of yet another Mari smiling down at him.

"It's been so lonely without you, but now we can finally be a family again!"

Another Mari emerged from the hair directly in front of him, he averted his gaze when this one pulled herself out of the hair just a little more, revealing her breasts.

"And Sunny..." She said. "I love you!" They all said in unison.

Before Sunny knew it the Mari in front of him grabbed his cheeks and pulled him into a kiss. Her lips were ice cold, he mouth smelled like wet soil, and Sunny quickly realized she was trying to stick her tongue in his mouth. His clenched his jaw to keep her from doing so. His eyes widened in horror when he felt her mouth open a little wider and fingers brush against his lips, his eyes darted in every direction, seeing many more Mari's emerging, but not a single hand near his other than the ones on his cheeking. These fingers were coming from INSIDE Mari's mouth.

With ease the fingers pried Sunny's mouth open, and an impossibly long tongue that tasted sickly sweet and sour poured into Sunny's mouth, coiling around his tongue, twisting itself into knots in his cheeks.

The true horror to Sunny was not just this event, but the undeniable fact that he was getting hard from it. More and more Mari's emerged near him, massaging him kissing his face and neck, wrapping their seemingly endless tongues around him like tentacles. Before he knew it Sunny was hard as a rock, and his body began to register that things were happening in his bedroom. 

The long crocked fingers of the demon hooked onto his belt and pulled his shorts down, he felt those cold fingers take a hold of him, felt it's thighs lowering. He expect a feeling of rotten putrid flesh of surround him, blood and bile to slobber over him, but all he really flesh was a tight ring move down and stop at his base. He noticed many of the Mari's in the distance turn their attention from him and to something that had emerged from the hair, Sunny quickly realized that thing was his own penis.

Quickly one of the Mari's in the distance descended on it, sucking it into her mouth, her tongue completely wrapping around it inside of her mouth, forming a tight, soft, slimy ice cold hold on it. One the entire thing was surrounded, once her tongue had stretched into the hair and into the bedroom to wrap around his balls and hold them tight, she began to bob her head up and down.

Despite everything, Sunny let out a moan into the mouth of the Mari continually kissing him.

"Does that feel good Sunny?" One of the Mari's whispered into his ear before she bit down on his earlobe gently. "Isn't it nice to have your sister back?" Asked another on his other side.

Sunny could only moan in response, he barely even noticed that his body was now elbows deep inside this hair sea. Many Mari's greedily lapped at him now, dozens of tongues coiling around him like snakes, around his arms, around his chest, his neck, where there wasn't a tongue in the way was a Mari, kissing his warm flesh with her cold lips. 

Tears of fear were tears of pleasure now.

"Sunny! Don't cry! I'm here now!"

One of the Mari's kissed the corner of his eye, and her tongue began to come out to lick away the tears. Sunny quickly realized that tongue had more intrusive ideas than he was comfortable with and shut his eye as hard as he could, but another Mari's hand came up from behind him and pulled his lids open. The feeling of Mari's cold slimy tongue again his eye was an equally unpleasant and bizarrely arousing one. She moved her tongue from one corner to another, in circles, in some instances even under his eyelid a little. She giggled a bit, she seemed to find it a bit amusing that Sunny was trying to track the movement of her tongue with his eye. Finally she pulled away, tongue still sticking out of her mouth like a taunt.

It was too much for Sunny to bare any longer, he felt his body shivering at the pleasure, and soon the pressure in his groin began to grow. With a few more bobs of Mari's head he let out a moan and came.

As he coated Mari's coiled tongue with his cum a hundred seemed to descend on him, hugging and kissing him, engulfing his entire body from the waist up in their cold, pale, but tender flesh. They held him tight as he shot more and more semen into them, and finally when he was completely spent they just held him, a mattress of bodies for him to pant and recover on. He felt the demon lift itself off him.

The Mari's finally dispersed a bit, staring at him lovingly. A few of them began to pull him. A dozen cold hands tenderly held him and moved him forward into more waiting hands, plenty of the Mari's giving him a quick kiss on his face as he was passed down among them. But finally something dawned on Sunny...

Only his knees down were inside the hair sea now.

"Don't worry Sunny!" One of the Mari's said...

And then her neck cracked completely sideways as her smile went from loving to deranged, literally stretching from ear to ear.

"Now we can finally be together again!..."

Sunny began to panic and struggle as more of the Mari's necks broke and their smiles became insane. He tried to break free of their hold but there were just too many, he could see more and more of his calf until his feet finally broke free from the hair and he was completely absorbed into the world. Immediately ropes of hair began to tangle around him and several broken necked variants of Mari grabbed him. Another Mari with a long, broken neck rose in front of him, her skin began to bleed and he mouth stretched down into her throat vertically like it'd been torn open, her eyes rolled back and fell into her head leaving only two black pits.

"FOREVER!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunny jumped off the sofa, and when he did Aubrey, who was passed out on top of him, was practically thrown onto the coffee table, knocking down the many bottles of pumpkin flavored beer and rum onto the ground. 

"Ow! Sunny, what the hell!" She yelled, not actually getting off the table.

"I!... What!... Where?..."

Sunny looked around his dark living room, the only thing giving off light was his TV with a "this stream has ended" message and the first hints of sunrise on the corners of the black out blinds. He collapsed back on the sofa as Aubrey, wearing nothing a tank top and some of "his" boxers that she'd decided were hers now, began to groan about her head.

He always hated her insistence on horror movie marathons and alcohol on Halloween.
