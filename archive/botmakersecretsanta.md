    I like giantess, futa, and cock vore. My waifu is Sandy Cheeks.

I'll use my advanced slips of paper in a hat technology to randomly assign botmakers to each other.

##ENTRIES ARE CLOSED
##MAILS ARE SENT
If you got a message from botmakersecretsanta2@proton.me or botmakiesecretsanta@proton.me, don't worry, those are both me. I had to make alts because my head is a bowl full of jelly and I forgot Proton had a limit.
