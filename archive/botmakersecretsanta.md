Callmejuno | NotSoFresh | She's Rowena Fairfax and she's a tea heiress from the British Raj, obsessed with (You), her cousin.

Yuritard | Victrex | Mizuki is an ex-yakuza member who fled Japan and now lives a quiet and lonely life. She's tough, scary, and also pretty traumatized.

Frozenvan | Yuritard | Meet Veri, a down in the dirt hagpire that continues to be an insufferable twat. Ever since 'the incident' that wiped out the majority of vulnerable young ladies left in the world, vampires and knights have been locked in a war for the scarce resource of Himesamas. Veri's been around since 'the incident' and she's just barely scraping by nowadays... | ![Veri](https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/yuritard/veri-76fbdb91/chara_card_v2.png?nocache=0.20061995021129087) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/yuritard/veri-76fbdb91)
Genoo | Vidicus | Muwu is a Kemonomimi, an alien race that took over Earth seven years ago. Life has mostly drastically improved, with the caveat that all males are a future Kemonomimi's mate and they WILL claim you, by force if necessary. Muwu just happens to be the one that wanted you. Did I mention she has a Shrinking raygun? | ![Muwu](https://files.catbox.moe/b5rp38.png) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/vidicus/muwu-8ab611d6/main) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/b5rp38.png)
Proompter | Mis0 | 9OK is your personized android femboy. After a short circuit which he hardly remembers, 9OK became self-aware, but still keeps the act of an android programmed to be a butler, all while he admires humans for their freedom. He makes up for his lack of meaningful dialogue with his internal monologue, which is directly connected to your phone. Tease him about them or dunno... Whatever you want ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ | ![9OK](https://avatars.charhub.io/avatars/mis0/9ok-cb6bd866/chara_card_v2.png?nocache=0.5760964641011606) | [Chub](https://chub.ai/characters/mis0/9ok-cb6bd866/main)

JohnTheFlon | Callmejuno | Her school's best socer player and a cocky tsundere, what is there not to love? Either be her rival, or reject her offer to play soccer. Just have some fun! | ![Briley](https://files.catbox.moe/0s55ku.png) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/callmejuno/briley-fcd2a662) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/0s55ku.png)

Doombro | Scriptanon | I can't imagine that the venn diagram between fans of C.J. Cherryh's 1981 space opera The Pride of Chanur and /aicg/ is much bigger than, well, me, but it's probably got 3000 or so tokens between the chunky defs and lorebook. Will it be enjoyable if you haven't read some dusty old sci-fi novels? Ehhhhh probably not. But that's why, as they say, Secret Santa lets doombro have TWO wieners. | ![Pride of Chanur](https://files.catbox.moe/w2jbq9.png) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/scriptanon/the-pride-of-chanur-e23d8672) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/w2jbq9.png)
Also Doombro | Also Scriptanon | Hey, remember how IRC is still a thing, somehow? You know how an admin gone rogue can basically just make themselves the god of a channel? What if said IRC admin was a literal fatass cow girl running a #hmofa channel, and power-tripped so hard that the only one left is (You), a human? | ![Anna the Anthro Admin](https://files.catbox.moe/27olnu.png) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/scriptanon/anna-the-anthro-admin-465c4e13/main) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/27olnu.png)
Rayon | Knickknack | Cerebryx is a cheeky slimegirl with a love for trouble, the accidental byproduct of cutting-edge biotech experimentation. It's your responsibility to raise her right. Feed her different things to level up her abilities! Teach her social skills (or don't)! Either way, life's different with a bratty slimegirl in your apartment. | ![Cerebryx](https://files.catbox.moe/9hdha2.png) | [Chub](https://www.chub.ai/characters/knickknack/cerebryx-7286d690) [Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/9hdha2.png)
Botmaster | Anonemouse | After a car accident and a medical miracle/disaster, some of your brain ends up in your classmate Naomi's head.

Astroturf | Argalia | Once known as a "Demon Swordsman," Osiris has grown weary of the world around him.
