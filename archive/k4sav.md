QRD: DoD (pentagon) funded biolabs doing research on pathogens in ukraine. the lab personnel have diplomatic immunity, USAF was collecting russian RNA, U.S GOV (jews) tried to deny their existence, now they are concerned about russia gaining control of the lab and using chemical / biological weapons...
also look into other DoD funded biolabs in georgia, kazakhstan etc.

Assistant Secretary at the US Department of Health denied the existence of an American bio-weapons program at a seminar on the threat of biological and chemical weapons. The event was organized by the European Parliament on 7th March in Brussels. Asked why the information about the US military bio-laboratories in 25 countries bordering on Russia, China and Iran (the Pentagon’s main rivals) is classified, Kadlec responded: “They are not classified, they are openly available to anyone who wants to look"

Black & Veatch, CH2M Hill, Battelle, lugar, and Metabiota articles:
private contractors that perform biological research for the CIA and various other government agencies. linked to EcoHealth Alliance

Hunter Biden's Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners (RSTP) was a lead financial backer of Metabiota, a pandemic tracking and response firm that partnered with Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Among the companies listed on archived versions of the firm’s portfolio is Metabiota, a San Francisco-based company that purports to detect, track, and analyze emerging infectious diseases, according to The National Pulse. Financial reports reveal that RSTP led the company’s first round of funding, which amounted to $30 million. Former Managing Director and co-founder of RSTP Neil Callahan – a name that appears many times on Hunter Biden’s hard drive – also sits on Metabiota’s Board of Advisors. Pilot Growth Management is currently the #1 investor in Metabiota. Neil Callahan is the co-founder. Hunter Biden was the director of the burisma board 2014-2019, other members included;

Mykola Zlochevsky - Ukrainian oil and natural gas businessman, politician and a Ukrainian oligarch. founder of burisma. multiple investigations of money laundering, channelling gov contracts to his business when he was ecology minister 2010-2012
Igor kolomoisky - Jewish billionaire and the former Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. spent $10 million to create the Dnipro Battalion, also funded the neo-nazi azov battalion.
Aleksander Kwaśniewski - former Polish President. WEF/Global Leaders for Tomorrow/1994, Let the CIA run a secret prison on Polish territory following 9/11 but claimed he was unaware of the torture of suspects
Joseph Cofer Black - former director of the Counterterrorism Center at the CIA (1999–2002)
Devon Archer - a former senior adviser to the John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign.

Metabiota Inc. was awarded $18.4 million federal contracts under the Pentagon’s DTRA program in Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia and for scientific and technical consulting services.
Metabiota services include global field-based biological threat research, pathogen discovery, outbreak response and clinical trials.
Since 2014, Metabiota has been a partner of Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute of Virology as part of the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) “PREDICT” project, which seeks to “predict and prevent global emerging disease threats.” As part of this effort, researchers from Metabiota, EcoHealth Alliance, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology collaborated on a study relating to bat infectious diseases in China. “Sensitive and broadly reactive RT-PCR assays were performed at Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences,” the paper notes. Among the researchers listed is Shi Zhengli, the Wuhan lab director. Peter Daszak is also listed as an author. In April 2020 Daszak before his role in funding gain od function research at the WIV was widely appreciated, he appeared on multiple occasions to promote the zoonotic theory of COVID-19, at least once with Bill Gates. After the NIH cut his funding, CBS named him "a scientist whose work is helping in the search for a COVID-19 cure" was "being undercut by pandemic politics." He stated on Democracy Now! that "The idea that this virus escaped from a lab is just pure baloney

Metabiota Inc. had been contracted by the Pentagon to perform work for DTRA before and during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and was awarded $3.1 million (2012-2015) for work in Sierra Leone – one of the countries at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Metabiota has also been embroiled in controversy for “bungling” America’s response to Ebola. Munich Reinsurance Company, the largest global reinsurer... and In-Q-Tel, Inc. (IQT), the strategic investor that accelerates the development of technologies to support the U.S. intelligence community, have signed strategic agreements with Metabiota. In April 2021, Joe Biden’s USAID announced a new initiative spearheaded by EcoHealth Alliance to track emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential. Also collaborating on the taxpayer-funded venture is Metabiota, whose researchers have been listed as authors on papers from June 2021 relating to coronavirus surveillance in Africa.

Nathan wolfe (pictured with Ghizzy) is the Founder & Chair of Metabiota.
