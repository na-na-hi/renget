##### Guidance for v4.8 update

Here: [https://rentry.co/hi3bounty2](https://rentry.co/hi3bounty2)


##### Only buy Event Bounties and never regular Bounties

The UP rate feature (choose a target for drop rate increase) has been removed. The rewards of Event Bounties are far better than regular Bounties.

Only buy Event Bounties and use your weekly assists in Event Bounties.


##### Terms

- BS: Bounty Silver
- TS: Time Swirl Pass
- Fuel: Ether Fuel
- Greens: Stigma Ghosts
- Blues: Stigma Shades
- Purple Lens: Spatial Lens, G2 forging material
- Red Lens: Spatial Convectron, G3 forging material
- Red Reso: Stigma Resonance


##### Transmute Option

Pick **500 Red Reso**, unless you are swimming in Red Reso.

You can later purchase 50 Red Lens using 500 Red Reso if needed.

However, if you already have already set 4000 Red Reso aside to purchase 400 Red Lens every month, then you should pick Red Lens, as there is a monthly limit of 8 purchases of 50 Red Lens using 500 Red Reso.


##### Ghost Option

Pick **450 Fuel**, unless you are swimming in Fuel.

If you are farming one of the G2s or G3s, it is much more worth it to obtain their Greens using BS. Buying Fuel using BS is not good (and should only be done if desperately short on Fuel).

If you are indeed swimming in Fuel, pick the G2 or G3 Greens you need.

**Explanation.** 450 Fuel is worth way more than either 25 G2 Greens or 20 G3 Greens.
450 Fuel costs 9000 BS
25 G2 Greens costs 6250 BS
20 G3 Greens costs 6000 BS
1 G2 Green converts to 10 Fuel if salvaging G2 Greens
1 G2 Green converts to 12.5 Fuel if buying G2 Greens using BS
450 Fuel is almost enough to buy 25 G2 Greens if spending Fuel (the inefficient way) to buy Greens!


##### Bounty Boost Option

If you are farming a G2 and have insufficient Purple Lens, pick Purple Lens.

If you are farming a G2 and have enough Purple Lens, pick Time Swirl Pass.

Otherwise, pick Time Swirl Pass.

Note that one can purchase 40 in v4.2 and 40 in v4.3 (i.e. 80 total in v4.2 and v4.3). However, Mihoyo says that the above two (Transmute Option and Ghost Option) are one-time only.


##### Farming Purple Lens from Open World

Usually less efficient than farming AE Imaginon from Open World and then buying Purple Lens using AE Imaginon. Unless you already have plans to max out your purchases of Purple Lens using AE Imaginon, it is better to pick AE Imaginon tasks from Open World.


##### How should I spend my Bounty Silver?

If you are farming Stigmata and insufficient Purple Lens, buy Purple Lens. Note that you can also buy Purple Lens using other resources, which may be preferred.

If you are farming Stigmata and sufficient Purple Lens, buy Greens.

Otherwise, buy Fuel.


##### What equipment should I make and when?

Note 1. SS-rank are the only bounties that drop G3 Greens and can only drop G3 Greens. Thus, buy them if and only if you want to make a G3 stigma.

Note 2. There is no UP rate for farming, so there's no such thing as farming something first. There is only when you decide to make something, and it is always better to make something as late as possible, so that you can collect more Greens from bounty drops rather than buy them using Bounty Silver.

Note 3. That said, you can accelerate your schedule for a particular stigma by requesting its Greens from Armada.

G1 equipment - cheap; Greens from S-, A-, B-rank bounties only
- **Lier B** - Everybody should make eventually, possibly more than one. Make when you need a good phys dmg B stigma.
- **Briareus Pri** - Everybody should make eventually. Make upon reaching lv 81.
- **MagStorm** - Don't bother, unless you know exactly what you're doing.
- **Demonblade - Florid Sakura** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you need to use SS FS as DPS or upon lv 81.
- **Siegfried Kaslana M** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you know you need this stigma. (Use Origins M until then.)
- **Shakespeare TMB** - Optional. Almost always, these will have better substitutes. However, they're often decent transitional choices. Fairly cheap.
- **Fuxi TM** - Don't bother, unless you know exactly what you're doing (e.g. mobbing with HF, or HT SN strats).
- **Cleopatra B** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you have your SSS KM ready for MA Doom.
- **Shennong T** - You may want to use this when you have SSS FT and a lot of gear.

G2 equipment - expensive; Greens from S-, A-, B-rank bounties only
- **Tesla Band M** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you need a M lightning support stigma, such as to go with Irene Adler TB or Margrave TB.
- **Tesla Band T** - Optional. Make when you have passively collected enough Greens from bounty drops.
- **Thales M** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you need a good TDM M stig or fire M stig.
- **Thales T Fuxi B** - Make if you don't plan to pull Leeuwenhoek TB. Make when you need to gear a fire DPS.
- **Robert Peary TMB** - See Ana Schariac TMB.
- **Monet T** - Optional. Make when you have passively collected enough Monet T Greens from bounty drops.
- **Michelangelo TB** - Make if you do not have Dickens TMB. This is useful for using FT in Abyss, and it performs better in Abyss than Kafka TM, Children TM, Jingwei Marco Lier.
- **Fenghuang Pinions** - Everybody should make eventually. Make when you get Fenghuang Down.

G3 equipment - expensive; Greens from SS-rank bounties only
- **Ana Schariac TMB** - Everybody should make eventually, unless already have Welt TMB. Start buying SS-rank bounties as soon as you have freed up materials to buy more TS, possibly around lv 70.
- **Dirac MB** - Everybody should make eventually. Start buying SS-rank bounties as soon as you have freed up materials to buy more TS, possibly around lv 70.
- **Dirac T** - Should probably also make this eventually, but Dirac T is more for Swallowtail Phantasm and Night Squire, rather than the Herrscher of Sentience.


##### What rank Event Bounties should I buy?

If goal is G3 and don't have G2, prefer **SS > A > B > S**. Use BS to buy G2 Greens.

If goal is G3 and have G2, prefer **SS > A > B > S**. Use BS to buy G3 Greens.

If don't want G3 (either because you have it or aren't interested) and goal is G2, prefer **A > B > S > SS**. Use BS to buy G2 Greens.

If don't want G3 and don't want G2, prefer **A > B > SS > S**. Use BS to buy G1 Greens or Fuel.

**Explanation.** We can calculate the worth of Event Bounties in terms of Fuel per TS used. For example, SS drops mostly G3 Greens but has a lower chance of dropping G2 Greens. If farming G3s, G3 Greens are worth their purchasing price, 30 Fuel, but if not, then G3s are worth their salvage price, 12 Fuel. We also consider the value of BS this way: if 300 BS is used to buy a G3 Green, then those 300 BS were worth 30 Fuel.


##### G1 equipment have no UP rate. Should I still farm G1 equipment? How do I farm G1 equipment?

Yes. In spite the lack of UP rate, the cost of crafting G1 in terms of TS has gone down, thanks to Event Bounties having significantly better drops and Fuel being significantly more abundant. Use BS to buy the specific G1 Greens you're missing.

Do not craft if you're missing materials to be able to forge in one go. Use the following steps to check your materials.

1. 120 SS Imaginon (some G1s are 90)
2. 80 Honkai Pieces (some G1s are 60)
3. 2 random G1 Blues as sacrifice
  - If you have these handy, nice!
  - If not, forge them from your highest quantity useless G1 Greens. Need 3 G1 Greens and 50 Fuel each. Buy G1 Greens using Bounty Silver if desperate.
4. 600 Fuel (in addition to any Fuel needed in step 3), broken down as 50 + 50 for two Blues + 200 for Purple + 300 for Stigma
  - If desperate, buy Fuel using Bounty Silver or salvage useless Greens, but you really shouldn't. Just do more bounties.
5. 6 G1 Greens
  - Feel free to buy using Bounty Silver.


##### What rank regular Bounties should I buy?

As aforesaid, **during the event, only buy Event Bounties and never regular Bounties**. The following advice is for non-event times.

If you are only lacking Fuel, prefer B-rank. Salvage unneeded Greens into Fuel.

If you are lacking Blues, prefer A-rank.

If you have a huge excess of TS, prefer S-rank, where there's a small chance of getting Spirits. Note that this is extremely unlikely, especially if you want to get a G2 or G3. In fact, even if you do not currently have a G2 or G3 to farm, you should save your TS for future Event Bounties.


##### Should I farm and forge G2 Stigma Box or G2 Stigma via G1 Stigma?

G2 Stigma Box (directly farming G2) is better.

G2 Stigma Box = 40 G2 Greens + 160 Purple Lens + 900 Fuel
G2 Stigma via G1 Stigma = 25 G2 Greens + 110 Purple Lens + 550 Fuel + 1000 Red Reso (that you could've gotten by converting G1 Stigma)

Even if you have the G1 Stigma already, you may still consider forging G2 Stigma Box directly, as you can convert the G1 Stigma to Red Reso.

If you had planned to forge G1s for the purpose of converting them into Red Reso (discussed below), forging G2 Stigma Box and converting the G1 Stigma into Red Reso is better than forging G2 via G1 and then forging another G1 to convert into Red Reso.

Finally, if you had G1 Blues but not the G1 Stigma, it is still in most cases better to forge G2 Stigma Box and either leave the G1 Blues or to forge the G1 Stigma and then convert it to Red Reso.


##### How to farm G3

Prefer farming TMB simultaneously and forging only when you are ready to forge all three pieces at once. If you have an excess of, say, the T piece but are missing the B piece, trade pieces with others in your Armada. A consumed G3 Ghost is worth 30 Fuel, but a salvaged one is worth only 12 Fuel.

Prefer forging G3 as late as possible, but before the end of the event.

Here is how to determine whether you are ready to forge all three pieces at once:
1. Make sure you have enough Red Lens (450 total).
2. Make sure you have enough Purple Lens (480 if no G1, 330 if G1).
  a. If not enough Purple Lens, open Bounty Boost Option (you get 40 in v4.2 and 40 in v4.3) and pick Purple Lens.
  b. If still not enough Purple Lens, buy using BS or other resources.
3. If excess G3 Greens (need 35 per piece), salvage them into Fuel (12 Fuel per Green).
4. If excess G2 Greens (need 40 per piece if no G1, 25 if G1), salvage them into Fuel (10 Fuel per Green).
5. Make sure you have enough Fuel (need 1800 per piece if no G1, 1950 if G1), G3 Greens, and G2 Greens.
  a. If not enough G3 Greens, buy G3 Greens using BS.
  b. If not enough G2 Greens, buy G2 Greens using BS.
  c. If not enough Fuel, buy Fuel using BS.
  d. If excess Fuel, buy G2 or G3 Greens using Fuel.


##### Need more Time Swirl Passes

From the Bounty Shop, buying TS (Time Swirl Passes) using Asterite, Gold Pins, Time Structures, and Ranger Creds are all good.

From the Task Shop, buying TS using Time Structures is good.

Other than the Time Structures route, the amount of TS you can obtain per patch is limited, and you are likely to hit the limit for the patch if you have any farming goals. If you still need more TS, you can buy 20 Time Structures for 3700 Asterite from the Asterite Shop, but this has much lower value.


##### Farming Red Reso using Event Bounties

Prefer forging G1 Stigma (i.e. Shennong, Siegfried Kaslana) that only cost 90 SS Imaginon.

Assuming enough Fuel and are buying all Greens from 0 using BS,
1000 Red Reso = 700 Fuel + 4800 BS + 80 Honkai Pieces + 90 SS Imaginon


##### I want to go deeper. Give me more numbers.

SS-rank Event Bounty
180 TS = 40 Fuel + 500 BS + 2 G3 Greens + (2 or 3 G3 Greens or a small chance of 600 BS)

S-rank Event Bounty
150 TS = 33 Fuel + 430 BS + 2 G2 Greens + (2 G2 Greens or 3 G1 Greens)

A-rank Event Bounty
50 TS = 10 Fuel + 150 BS + (1 or 2 G2 Greens or 2 to 6 G1 Greens)

B-rank Event Bounty
25 TS = 5 Fuel + 70 BS + (1 G2 Green or 1 G1 Green)

Thus, we can work out the expectation of each Event Bounty in terms of TS.

For 150 TS (assuming that the randomly chosen rewards are equally likely),
Rank | Fuel | BS | G3 | G2 | G1
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
SS | 33.33 | 416.67 | 3.75 | 0 | 0
S | 33 | 430 | 0 | 3 | 1.5
A | 30 | 450 | 0 | 2.25 | 6
B | 30 | 420 | 0 | 3 | 3

It is clear that, if not farming G3, A-rank is the clear winner, with 6 G1 Greens. G1 Greens can be exchanged for Fuel or sacrificed for the any Green requirement in forging G1 Blues.

And it is clear that, if farming G3, SS-rank is necessary. It is the only one that yields G3 Greens.


##### Recognizing Event Bounties for weekly assists

As mentioned at the top of this guide, prefer Event Bounties for weekly assists as regular Bounties do not drop BS.

Certainly Event Bounties:
- _All SS-rank Bounties are Event Bounties_
- Hellmaru, S
- Legatus, S
- Fu Hua, S
- Raven, A
- Seele Vollerei, A
- Crimson Web, A
- Jizo Mitama, B
- Parvati, B

Certainly regular Bounties:
- Fire of Naraka (a Hellmaru)
- Warrior Legend (a Shadow Knight)
- Benares, S
- Kallen
- Quantum Entanglement, S
- Rampant Drone, S (a Heimdall)
- Titan Legion, A
- Zombie Elite, A
- Tundra Beast, A
- Honkai Tide, B
- Poem of the Wind, B (a Wendy)
- Dark Wolf, B (a Bronya)

I don't think these are regular Bounties, but they don't drop BS:
- Assaka, A
- Son of Darkness, B
- Son of Dawn, B
- Frost Emperor, B
- Flame Emperor, B

Unsure:
- Ganesha, B

This list is incomplete.
