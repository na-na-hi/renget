“No! Let take me back in! Let me absolve myself in the vulnerabilities of the flesh!”.

A light rain cascades the world around you, picking your skin with sharp coldness, dampening the soil beneath your feet as a familiar sight looms overhead in the downtrodden abbey you call home Pale moonlight emboldens the sign hanging in front of the building, shadows from a darkening sky filling in the cracks and crevices of the rotting sign. “Last Hope”, it reads as The Estate Holder drags you through the chilling rain and into the dilapidated tavern. Darkness gives way to a dull, flickering orange, painting a picture of an empty rustic tavern, the combination of stale beer and sweat filling your nostrils as you’re dragged across the floorboards and into an uncomfortable barstool. The weary bartender glances down at you, then to the Estate Holder, and then sighs.

“What happened this time?” He opens, smirking slightly as he pours a drink, ready to hear another story to add to his collection.

The Estate Holder looks up, holding you steady as he grimaces. “Cultists, Poor guy didn’t even get a chance to react before they filled his mind with.... visions.”

“~Only through pain will you find truth!~”, the thought bursts across your mind like cracks across ice, quickly powering through your current train of thought, and forcing your minds eye to a vision of hooded figures giving lashes to a tied-up prisoner.

CLINK. Suddenly a full mug appears in front of you dragging you away from the thought and drowning out the conversation between the bartender and Estate Holder, replacing it with the sudden need to get wasted. The dryness in your thought and the blood in your mouth potentiate this feeling, as you quickly grasp the frothy mug with both hands. “Ah yes!” you croak interrupting the two, “Poison of the mind will clean the poison from my body!”. You lift the glass and take a couple mouthfuls of much-needed gulps from the bitter brew. Coldness washes down your throat and eases just a little of the days many stresses.

“...Yeah, needless to say, his first embarkment left him more than a little masochistic, but hey, that’s what we pay you for!” The Estate Holder remarks, dropping a small stack of gold on the bar next to the drink. “You know the drill, make them doubles, and keep them coming, I don’t think our friend here is too worried about the hangover. I just need him to not be so.... painful.”

The bartender smiles, taking the bag and setting it behind the bar. “He should count himself lucky that he still CAN get hungover.” The bartender laughs as he starts to pour another beer.

“Yea no kidding, just take care of him tonight, and hopefully he’ll feel better tomorrow, we have a scouting mission into the Warrens and I need him to get some experience.” 

With that, the Estate Holder turns and steps out of the tavern into the night, quickly blending into the darkness, leaving you alone in a broken bar, with your drink and your troubles.
	You’ve got a lot of gold to spend, and a lot of drinks to imbibe. One quickly turns to two, two into three, and three into...? You kind of lose track, all the drinks you get just turn into empty glasses, and the glasses all look the same.
	After what seems like an innumerable amount of beers and cocktails, the tavern door screams open, causing your heart to jump, and spilling your drink all over your pants and onto the floor.  You gasp in horror, turning to the bartender “Oh!! Baaaartender! It seemsh that life does not hahve anything but sadness for me! I’m going to need some more in order for thish night to be saved!”

To your dismay, the bartender is completely ignoring you, not even looking at you, but rather through you, to whoever came through that door. Reluctantly you take your eyes away from the drink and move them towards whoever had the audacity to ruin your night of drinking.
	Standing in the doorway is an imposing figure, somebody who you haven’t seen before, but based on the bartenders face he must be somebody who frequents here often. They stand tall at the door, their imposing figure silhouetted against the dark and stormy night. You have to squint with wobbling vison, but you can start to focus on who exactly is at the door.
	A tall, bare-chested and barefooted, rain-slicked man stands in the doorway, face shadowed by the moonlight as he looks down. A large ‘A’ seems to be carved into the left side of his head, and the other side is draped with matted unkempt hair that sticks to his head like cobwebs on a statue. His chest and stomach are wrapped with a sinister chain that starts at one wrist, goes over the shoulder, around the neck and stomach, ending in a shackle at the other hand. You can’t really discern, but it almost looks like his left hand is infected with something, red and swollen, veins bulging with a sickly green tint. His body is marred with scars and welts, owing to a long history of battle and hardship, and clearly, victory. 
	He walks over to the bartender and puts his hands on the table, giving you a closer look, you aren’t just drunk, the veins along his red, monstrous hand are DEFINITELY green.
	The bartender doesn’t look nearly as impressed as you are. “Damn it Corbon, what the hell do you want now? Shouldn’t you be out where you belong? In the dark depths of some damnable hellhole, far away from here?”

The man scowls and puts his hands up. “Aw, come on Sheamus... That’s no way to greet an old friend...” His scowl twists into a smile “Especially one with coin as good as mine....”

His voice.... It slithers out of his mouth and seeps into your ears. It’s cold, calculating, and there’s something wrong with it. It almost sounds like there are two people.... No, one person and one thing speaking at the same time, it’s unnatural and sends a chill down your spine.

“Old friend my ass! You single-handedly caused half of my brothel staff to quit! you demon! Every man or woman you go to a room with, ends up quitting the next day! You’re driving me out of business! There’s only so many whores in this town!”

The scarred man starts to frown “Is that really my fault? Or are you just not paying them enough? Hell for all you know maybe they’ve left this dump to hole up with me, I give them something that they could never get… here” He motions towards you, you open your mouth to defend your pride, but the bartender acts more swiftly

The bartender stands up abruptly and points at the door, arm quivering, “You get the hell out of my bar right now or I’ll throw you out!” He shrieks, startling you and causing Corbons eyebrows to raise.
	
Corbon amused, shakes his head no and sits down at the bar next to you. “Shaemus we both know that isn’t going to happen, if I really wanted to, I could paint this tavern red with you and whoever this poor sap is desperate enough to drink here.” He gestures to Shaemus’ arm, pointing out how much it shakes.

Sheamus drags his hand across his face, muttering to himself “Oh gods, first a masochistic drunk and now-”

Corbon starts to rummage around his pack, “Besides, I’m not here to fight, you know what I’m here for.” He pulls out a fat sack from his pack and drops it on the bar. Emeralds and Rubies spill out from the top, falling into spilt beer, swimming in the amber. You can’t help but stare with your mouth agape, you’ve never seen that much wealth before, there’s at least 12,000 coins worth of gold sitting right before you.

“Last trek ended up going pretty well for us, and I wanted to share some of this with you, I felt that a little celebration is in order... “He crosses his arms behind his head, demonstrating the rippling muscle that holds up the sickening chain. “Now come on Shaemus, I know that a couple coins is worth more to you than some used up harlot, there’s got to be somebody here who doesn’t know about my.... reputation”.

Corbon leans back in the barstool, crossing his legs, looking up at Shaemus expectantly. Shaemus himself staring at the wealth on the bar, brow furrowed in thought. Suddenly, his eyes light up.
	
He suddenly turns and puts his arm around you. “Well, it just so happens that I got a new whore tonight, right... uhhh?” He looks at you with a pleading look on his face.

“Anon.”

“Ah yes Anon, just so happens that he has just the right inclination for your.... needs, and, you can have him for the night! Right anon? Do a good job and I’ll give you 1000 gold, AND all the bottles you can carry with you tomorrow!
1000 coins! That’s enough to get some better armor and weaponry down at the smithy! Plus, as many bottles as you can carry! All you have to do is have sex? Maybe it’s the booze, maybe it’s the fact that you already swing for the other team, but it sounds like a pretty good deal!

“Uhhhh, sure?”

“Great!” Shaemus stands up, looking relieved, forcing himself to take his eyes off of the fortune in front of him. “Corbon you know the drill, upstairs, room in the far far farrrr back, try to keep quiet, and don’t kill the man! I cleaned up the mess you left last time, should be just the way you like it!”

“Wait”, you think to yourself, “Don’t kill the man….?”. What have you gotten yourself into?

He practically jumps with joy as he grabs the key and tosses it to Corbon. “By the way, this little slut likes it rough!”

“Rough?!” you think to yourself before being grabbed by the shirt and hauled up the stairs by Corbon. “Maybe rough is better though...” The cultists visions sweep back into your mind. Filling it with lustful visions of the man dragging you up the stairs, you can almost hear them whisper. “~Give penance through your body, for whatever means necessary.~”

Corbon kicks open the door and shoves you inside onto the bed. You fall face first onto a large queen, well used, and stained with god knows what. Pillows, soft and silky, caress your skin, faux romance to prepare for the nights undertaking
“Get up and undress” He hisses, arms crossed across his chest. You stand up from the bed and begin to undo your shirt, before faulting for a minute. Is this really what you want to do?
	
Instantly your mind is filled with voices from afar “~Give to him what he needs, let him take from you what he owns~”. A quick flash overwhelms your vision, and you now see a group of excited cultists gathered, looking at YOU. You notice one male reaching down, starting to undo his robes, as you notice another lean in to whisper in another’s ear. Even though you’re miles away, you can hear it as clear as day… “it's Corbon!”. Soon the thought is ripped away and the man returns to your vision, staring expectantly at you. “~Yes, this is what you NEED to do~”.

Your shirt and pants come off quickly, followed by your drawers. You soon stand naked in front of him, vulnerable, and on full display. You shyly put your hands in front of yourself.

“NO!” Corbon barks, making you jump. “YOU don’t hide anything from me. Tonight YOU belong to ME, if I don’t tell you to do something, you DON’T do it. Remove your arms, meat, let me see what I get to take.”

You quickly follow the orders of the high-leveled hero, raising your arms above your head, exposing your entire body to the drafty room and Corbon’s piercing gaze.

“Good boy, At least you know your place... Now, turn around, meat.”

You slowly turn around, giving Corbon everything he asks for. You feel his gaze wander over every intimate part of your body, feeling him devour you with his eyes, like a butcher sizing up a cut of pork.
You eventually reach full circle and meet his gaze again, arms still above your head. He smiles at you with a sinister look in his eyes

“Now, I want you to watch what happens, and don’t scream, screaming isn’t going to change anything.”

Corbon looks up to the ceiling and closes his eyes. You feel the musty air around you become significantly heavier, and you swear you could feel the amount of light in the room drop significantly. Soon Corbons body begins to change. His facial features elongate and contort painfully, a snout begins to protrude from his face, horns begin to split from his skull. Your mouth falls open as it slowly dawns on you what is happening, your pulse picks up the pace until you hear it beating against your ears, you involuntarily draw a breath and hold it, mesmerized by the demonic transformation taking place before you.
Corbon’s chest and stomach begin to expand, toned flesh giving way to muscled hair, pushing forward against the chains until they fall off his growing body. His arms ripple and contort, muscles shifting painfully across the new frame building beneath them, the sickly veins visibly pumping blood down to the hands as they elongate and sharpen into thick claws. His feet stretch and scratch the floorboards until they resemble a dog’s hind legs, with the legs themselves splitting open his tattered shorts until the man that was once in front of you is gone, replaced with this demonic hellhound.
You gulp, and let out the breath you’ve been holding, sucking fresh air in when the stench hits you. The musty air of a cheap brothel room being replaced with a powerful bestial musk. It’s like nothing you’ve ever smelled before, like brimstone mixed in with fur, blended with the unmistakable scent of pure masculinity and sex. Before you can pinpoint where the smell is coming from, you notice that the shorts that he was once wearing are now nothing more than strips of cloth by his feet.
Your gaze slowly travels up his leg to where his pride is, eyes lustfully taking in the view of his sheathed cock, a bright red cock-tip peeking out, drooling a pale green fluid that runs down the length of his sheath before gliding over a hairless, plump, low-hanging sack.

Corbon takes a step forward towards you.

“Do you like what you see anon?” As with body, is with voice. The smooth, silky layered voice he once had is now gone, completely replaced with a bestial guttural that comes from no man. He quickly makes his way over, towering over you and lets you take in a good look at his new body.

Soon your own body gives in to the starkness of its environment. Whether it be a dry spell, the smell of sex, or the visions, soon it begins to stir under these new circumstances. The beating in your ears synchronizing with a pulsing of your loins, and soon you find yourself at full attention and starkness in front your hungry bedmate.
	
“Your own body betrays you, boy…” He coos, reach down with a clawed hand and grasping your manhood tightly “In the presence of real power you want it more than I do”

The feeling of his rough hands grasping your pride sends shivers down your spine, why can’t you resist this? A dark voice returns “~Let him tear into your body, you want nothing more than to be a rut.~”

You consciously resist but the words start seeping from your mouth “Please… take me, beast… Show me what a real hero feels like.” You can’t even stop the words from dripping with lust and wanting as your dick’s lifeblood pumps under the monster’s grip.
The beast grabs you roughly by your hair, forcing you down on your knees in front of him, his pride freely hanging in front of you, 
	
“Savor the taste and smell, wench, If you want to know what a real hero feels like, you have to start with the basics.”

“~You were born for this, give him what he needs.~” Cultists now giddy with anticipation, in various states of undress and pleasure quickly dance across your mind.

Without hesitation you begin to satisfy the demon’s lust. You open your mouth, letting your tongue roll out, placing it at the bottom of his sack. The musk is overpowering your nose as his sheath sits inches from your nostrils, the smell of sweat, and seed overpower your body. Your engorged cock bounces below, fully erect.
You drag your tongue on and around his jewels, coating every inch with a slick sheen of saliva, savoring every centimeter of grimy, sweaty skin. You hear him sigh above you, his hand rubbing the back of your head, pushing you forward, deeper into his crotch

“You may be a foul hero, but you will make for a great fuck. I’ve never seen somebody so quick to give in to their desire.” You notice his clawed hand droop down over your ravenous suckling, pointing down at your own cock. “Even your body knows that you were born to relieve, not born to breed.”

His words cause your mouth to work even more quickly, eager to please the hulking demon, the thought of cleaning off his sweaty body sends you into a lustful frenzy. The hand moves closer and grasps your neck, he squeezes it slightly, dragging you away from his sack and up towards his opening. The tip now fully out revealing a tapered, inhuman head, freely oozing precum. You don’t even need his guidance as you quickly push forward, thrusting your tongue into his sheath as far as it can go, fully cementing the bottom of his manhood onto your tongue. The taste…

“~Savor the moment, some have a calling towards repentance, some are born to satisfy.~”.

The full taste of this monster’s genitals completely envelops your mouth. Salt and Reproductive fluid coat your tongue as it hugs the bottom of his dick, the heat of his member warming up the muscle. Your breathing gets quicker as you eagerly lap up the slime coating the bottom of his cock, desperately beckoning it out of its shell. Precum begins to drip onto your nose and face, intoxicating you with his seed and marking you as his bitch. The sex in the air and in your mouth causes your head to swim with lust, as you bring one hand up fondle his sack, directing the other one down below to massage your own throbbing need.
As you begin to lose yourself in your own desires, you hear the beast hiss and feel the hand on your neck tighten as he drags you away from his dick, leaving your tongue out, lopsided as you stare at his slowly emerging dick, eager to feel it again in your mouth. You feel a hot smack on your face as he spits on you, forcing your face to look up at him from underneath his length before he growls “You’re here to service ME. Do you understand? Everything you have WILL be given to me, I don’t care if you get to finish or not. I don’t care if it’s enjoyable. The only time you’re allowed release is if I fuck it out of you. Is this clear?”.

You quickly realize your mistake moving your hand off your dick onto his, rubbing it idly as you quickly nod your head, whether out of fear, or out of desire to see where this liaison goes, your lust-addled brain can’t decide.

“Good, enough of this, you’ve clearly proven that you understand what you’re here for.”

He quickly stands you up and ushers you back towards the pillow-bed, pushing you down face first, bending you over and spreading your legs apart. The rubbing of the sheets against your aching prick causes shivers to run from your dick to your stomach, staining the dirty sheets with more evidence of a bitch well-bedded.

“Now, for the main course” You hear as you feel a finger trace up from your thigh to your entrance. Soon both hands lay on your backside, spreading it open and exposing it to the cold air, and to the beast. Soon cold air is replaced by warm breath as you sense him kneeling behind you, warm breath being replaced by a hot intruder, wiggling its way deep inside you.
You don’t even bother to stifle your moans as the creature behind you prods deep inside of you with his bestial tongue. It’s much longer than it has a right to be, and scratches all the right places. A rough smack on your left buttock juxtaposes a sharp sting with the pleasures of his tongue, really hammering home who the one in power is.
Soon you feel your insides coated slick with saliva as he removes his face from your bottom, you begin to whimper already missing the feeling of a piece of him deep inside you, but he doesn’t leave you waiting long. Soon you feel a hit tip pressing against the door, eager to be let inside.

“Nice and tight, I’m really going to enjoy loosening you up a bit, isn’t that what you want?”

His claws grasp the hair on the back of your head, pulling back harshly forcing you to look at him, smugly, expectantly.

“Oh gods, please…” You groan, grinding your hips forth into the bed, and backwards against his hot, pulsing member

“~Let him show you what your worth really is~” they cultists now are in a frenzy, some already in the deep states of bodily pleasure, others still clothed and standing, waiting.

The words almost seem forced from your mouth, but you start to feel that this is something you really want. “Please take from me what you want. I want it, I need it…”

You see the quick glimmer of a sharp-toothed grin before he shoves your face back into the mattress, other hand grabbing your arm and pulling it behind your back. He roughly pushes quickly into you, quickly stuffing you with the first four inches of his fiery warmth.
It quickly scrapes against your prostate as you feel your legs go weak against the floor. You lay heavy on the mattress, with him slightly supporting you by the arm. He gives you a little time to adjust to the first four inches, before pulling out slightly, and pushing back deeper another inch. You feel rough nubs pop one after another into your body as his alien cock pushes deep inside you in the most intimate way you can give.
You hear his breathing quicken as he starts to pant and thrust, building up a rhythm as he coats your most intimate insides with his hellish pre. It slowly coats every inch of your backside, slowly spilling out and rolling down your own sack, giving constant heat to both your backside and your ballsack.
Soon you start to feel your own cock begin to leak as his constant thrusting pushes the alien tip over your prostate again and again, slowly massaging and milking it, pulses of pleasure that radiate out from within, causing you to involuntarily contract on the foreign body making itself at home inside of you.
You hear the beast moan as he pushes himself deeply into you, warmth spreading through your bottom. You feel yourself involuntarily pushing back, wanting to feel every inch of his manhood scrape against your willing and open hole. Expecting to feel completion in the rough hair on his stomach pressing against your backside, instead you feel yourself begin to stretch against a new, large, section of himself.
	
“I’m beginning you think that we don’t even have you pay you for this…” The beast groans, pulling himself from inside you with a wet pop. You whimper involuntarily as the warmness of being stuffed is replaced with the cold stuffy air of the cheap room. You reach down between your needy cock and push your fingers inside of yourself, feeling the fluids now coating your inside. His hand quickly grabs your and tosses you off the bed with a quick flick of his arm, demonstrating his strength with a small flick of his arm.
	
You quickly scramble off the floor and onto your knees, looking up to see him sitting on the bed, muscled body and fur matted with sweat, legs spread far apart, and head cocked, giving you your first good look of the monster invading your insides. His cock stands at about 7 and a half inches, curving upward, perked and pulsing after being inside you, his heavy balls hang of the edge of the bed, distended and packed with virility. His manhood is completely inhuman, the base far larger than the rest of it, beginning with a large knot before thinning to a long, red shaft. Small spheres dot the bottom and top of his member, and his tip itself flaring outward from the end of his cock and tapering into a point, like an arrowhead, constantly drooling a stream of pale green fluid. The beast notices you staring at him and drags his finger along the bottom of his pride, ending a couple inches above his tip. His mouth hangs open, tongue extended out, it seems that you can tame the beast somewhat after all.
	
“~Only the pain of the knot will fill you to completion!~”
	
You instantly crawl on all fours down between his legs, the musk and sweat being more pronounced then ever before. You cup that back of his weighty sack, giving each orb a kiss, before slowly dragging your lips up the bottom of his engorged manhood, before settling around the tip, suckling the hellish seed from the source.
The demon groans breathily as your tongue flicks over the sensitive head, giving your mouth a few spurts of encouraging pre, telling you that he is really enjoying this.
	
“I think it’s time to finish what you started...” He whines, dick clearly tired of not being buried into a warm inviting hole.
	
You quickly straddle his lap, his hot meat pressed between your cheeks as you bury yourself in his furred chest. Reaching down, you grab his length and lift yourself up slightly, pushing the tip against your waiting entrance, slowly stroking the bestial member eliciting soft moans from the beast. You feel his hand trace up your neck, before reaching past you to the back of your head, cradling you into his chest. You hear him panting at your ear. hot breath breathing against your neck, warming you against the draftiness of the room you share. Head pressed against his chest, you feel and hear the heartbeat of the demon, pulsing in time with his manhood. For the first time that night, you feel like you’re in charge. His hand rubbing the back of your head, groaning into your ear as you cup in your hand the single most important thing he has. Both of you want this, and now he waits for you.
The moment doesn’t last long as lust overpowers love. You Slowly sink down against his meat again, the warmness returns, and serotonin floods your system as you rest against the base of his knot. You’re in control of the pace as you lift yourself up back to the tip, and returning to the base, working a steady rhythm. Your cock begins to rub against the navel of the shuddering monster, sending sparks of pleasure radiating out from the tip, and staining his fur with the evidence of your pleasure. You start to lose yourself in your job, alternating the pace, grinding his length against every inch of your inside, trying to coat every inch of you in his sexual fluids, you don’t want to miss a single drop, and you sure as hell don’t want this night to end.
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, as your ride his cock, you find yourself moving quicker and quicker, eager to let the beast unload himself into you, wanting to feel the completeness of bringing this creature to hid orgasm. You look up at your monstrous lover. Pleased to see that he has completely lost himself in sex, eyes closed, mouth open and tongue lolling out, panting heavily as he lets you work his cock. You smile as you lift yourself up and down, enjoying the power of bringing this hulking creature to lustful docility, before taking a hand up, rubbing against his face. He doesn’t even open his eyes as you bring the inhuman face down to meet your own, taking his tongue into your mouth as you press your lips against the end of his snout.
You feel the beast chuckle as he quickly agrees to your actions. Hand gently grabbing your hair and pulling your head backwards, as he pushes his tongue deep into your mouth. You were expecting some horrific taste, maybe blood, or worse…, but it’s quite neutral and pleasant. You expected kissing a monster to be much less, romantic, but even in this form the monster can have a bit of delicacy
You feel yourself getting close as the upward curve and position strokes your prostate with every descent on the creature, and you know that before he cums you need to take ALL of him.
You reach down your arm, feeling around the bottom for the beast’s knot, eager to feel it press inside you. As you find it you grip the base of his sheath and tug slightly upward you feel him whimper into your mouth, thrusting slightly, desperate to tie you and cum.
You feel the cultists watching, hearing them invade your mind again “~It’s going to hurt… Repent!! Completion comes with pain, but pleasure!~”
	
Massaging and tugging his knot, you time yourself to descent right as the beast pushes himself up inside of you. Stars fill your vision as you push down quickly on his bulbous knot, and pain shoots up your spine as it forces itself deep within you, tying itself against the back, locking in the fluids spurting from the creatures member as you feel it perk up inside of you, happy to be buried deep within a willing hole.
	You tug your face away from the creature’s mouth as you yelp in pain. The beast himself looking stunned with pleasure as his knot grinds deep within you, fulfilling a deep, primal, demonic urge to tie and breed.  He closes his eyes and lets out a long deep grumbling moan as you feel his hot, hellish cum paint your insides. You close your eyes tightly and press deep into his chest, gripping his fur against the searing pain of biting off a bit more than you can chew.
	You feel a rough hand on your ass as a green light begins to illuminate from behind you. A sharp coldness radiates down from your skin to the entrance around his bulb, and pain is soon replaced with shooting pleasure as something soothes your insides, giving them elasticity as they wrap tightly around the entirety of his cock. Quickly all the pain subsides, and you can move from worrying about your backside, to massaging his front side. Soon you can’t help but grind your ass lustfully against the monster’s hips as you feel his bulb slowly engorge inside of you, still releasing hot seed into your deepest crevices. The thought alone of having a monster of this size using you as a condom is normally enough to make you stand at attention, but having it actually happen, is enough to send you over the edge, hands-free. Pleasure ruptures down your cock and across your entire body as you release onto the beast’s stomach. Spurt after spurt as every deep grind against his body sends another wave of pleasure across yours, painting his furred stomach white with your own release.
	You slowly sink your head into the demon’s taut chest as you listen to his breathing heave in and out, moaning as his orgasm begins to subside, knot acting like a cork keeping all the fluids deep inside you. You start to notice yourself moving as the beast wraps his arms around your back and falls sideways onto the mattress, still tied deep within you. You can still feel his member pulsing deep within you, the seed inside of you beating against your walls.
	
“That was…. Amazing.” He sighs, rubbing his arms up and down your back as the warmth of his body spreads against yours, claws scratching lightly against your skin, causing goosebumps along your back and arms. You feel a soft tongue lick your face as he continues “I’ve never had somebody that was so willing and wanting of me before, most people just see me and gape in horror, but you…” You feel him kiss your forehead as you nuzzle into his chest. ”You can enjoy me for who I really am.” Minutes feel like hours as the two of you lie together on the bed, physically linked together, reveling in post-orgasm afterglow.
	
You feel another thought begin to penetrate your mind, but strangely enough this one comes with no command. Instead you see the aftermath of the cultists revel, sexual fluids a plenty, and most of them either asleep, or resting after the show you gave them. The beasts, now soothing voice, takes you away from the scene.

“I hope you’re comfortable, anon, try to get some sleep, it might take a while before I’m free.”
		Not that you minded of course, being the little spoon always made you feel more comfortable. You lie your head against his chest, the beating of his heart slowly lulling you into the deep confines of sleep. Before long you hear the beasts, breath draw in long and deep, as he falls asleep inside of you. You wiggle and twist a little bit to get more comfortable, taking care not to injure the sensitive organ throbbing deep inside of you, and soon find yourself drifting off, fully sinking your naked chest into the sleeping furball that chose you as his mate….
	
Sunlight pierces the foggy windows and splays warmly across your face. You slowly reach forward to feel for Corbon, but instead feel cold sheets against your hand. You bolt up quickly and open your eyes, scanning the room for a sign of the beastman, but you share the room with no one. As the blood pools from your head to the rest of your body, you begin to feel the dull ache of a headache creeping on, but the invasive visions of cultists gone.
	“Oh gods, how much did I drink last night?” You think to yourself as you get up from the bed, stark naked. Suddenly the weight of misadventure crashes over your body, as you start to drag your muscles awake from their stiffness. You can’t even remember, but you felt like you’ve ran a marathon as you search for your clothes. You reach down to behind yourself, feeling for any evidence of last nights sweaty encounter, but it’s almost like you’ve been licked clean.
	You reach for your shirt and drawers, hastily thrown on the floor, dragging them over your messy hair as you try to remember what exactly happened last night. Was it all just a dream? Is Corbon even real? It had to have happened, you remember it so vividly. The beating of his heart, the taste of his tongue, the feeling of his seed…. You stop yourself before you get worked up again.
	Yet it had to have been just a dream, you don’t have a drop of sex on you, hell it feels like you just showered, and besides, people like that don’t exist, it isn’t possible. You slowly drag yourself over to the door kind of saddened at this revelation, when a green glint catches your eye.
“I didn’t take that in here, did I?” you think out loud to yourself as you pick up a ring off the end table. It glows orange, radiating in the sunlight, curving around delicately with excellent craftsmanship, building the base for a gemstone nestled precisely into the tip.
