->*"Th-the sky is falling! The sky is falling!"*<-

That was the prediction Kris had received early that morning. He'd nearly woken the entire guild up with his frantic raving as he ran outside in a panic, almost tripping over himself as he made a beeline for the hammock that his partner usually slept in. 

As the Absol started blabbering about something-or-other at a hundred miles per minute, Kaiji rose groggily from his hammock and rubbed his temple, accepting that he wouldn't be getting any more sleep today. As if he'd been through this many times before, he calmly waited for the fox to run out of breath before even attempting to say anything in response.

"One word at a time, please..." Kaiji shook his head, already more than familiar with his partner's manic episodes. Kris tended to get worked up like this whenever he got one of his absurd premonitions, and there was never any chance of convincing him he was wrong, no matter how insane his ramblings sounded.

"*Th-the, i-it's up in, c-crashing down, and-!*" The fox panted, still winded from sprinting nonstop straight after waking up.

Kaiji let out a sigh. "Please, from the beginning..." He spoke in a shyer, softer voice than he usually did... It wasn't unusual for him to drastically change his tone of voice and manner of speaking during missions depending on who he was trying to manipulate, or to stick to his phony Brooklyn accent when he was dealing with customers (or feeling particularly annoyed).  This early in the morning, however, he couldn't even summon the energy to keep up the calm stoicism of his "neutral" voice, which was just as much a sham as any other accent he ever put on - but nobody needed to know that. He'd much rather leave behind the meeker disposition he had as a human, and his soft-spoken voice was another relic of the old Kaiji he'd prefer to cast away.

After a minute, Kris had finally calmed down enough to form a coherent (the term is used loosely here) sentence. "Th-the sky is falling!" he insisted, his eyes wide with fear as he looked down at his Meowth partner.

Kaiji rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, wanting to be sure he'd heard that correctly. "The... sky is falling?"

Kris nodded frantically "We- We need to warn everyone! We'll have to hide in the basement, and, and-" Kris turned his head, looking up at the sky above them. The first beams of sunlight started to peek over the horizon, and the sight only served to increase Kris' level of distress. "H-how are we supposed to build a new sky, Kaiji?! W-what are we supposed to do..?" the fox cried out, genuine despair audible in his voice.

Kaiji didn't know how to respond - not just to his partner's question, but to anything he'd said at all. He'd heard all sorts of crazy claims of supposed impending calamities from his partner, from fearful warnings of monsters made of playing cards, to crazed ramblings of the entire world ending - the only thing consistent about his ability to sense oncoming danger seemed to be that he never quite got it right. But a direct quote from a fairy tale written specifically to poke fun at paranoid delusions? This crossed the line from bizarre to surreal.

Kaiji assumed that being woken up by his partner's single most ridiculous prediction yet would be the craziest thing to happen to him all day. If only he'd known what the rest of the day had waiting in store...

It had happened just after Kaiji had finally managed to calm Kris down from his outburst earlier that morning. 

An Alakazam claiming to be from the "Guild Federation" had suddenly burst into the guild hall, threatening to shut down their entire organization and have them evicted unless the guild paid him handsomely for the privilege of doing dangerous physical labor for the Federation under strict time constraints. Several of the guild's teams were sent out to close dangerous spatial rifts inside of Mystery Dungeons, with various barely-explained dangerous effects on the dungeons that they were left largely unprepared to deal with. Kaiji's team was sent to seal one such rift on the southeastern side of Northern Desert, and only managed to get there within the day thanks to Kaiji striking a deal with a customer of his who could teleport them there - he'd have to supply their team's next big dungeon run in exchange, but the financial hit was something he could live with.

And so, the team found themselves making the arduous trudge through the blistering heat of the desert, with little description of the dungeon they were looking for beyond a landmark to find it by and the remarkably undescriptive name of "GL-07". Kaiji wiped the sweat from his brow as he looked up from his map, scanning the desert landscape around him and taking careful note of the rocky hills and stone pillars jutting out from the ocean of sand surrounding them. He glanced back down at the map in his hands... the landmarks matched the details charted around the destination, so they were definitely in the right place.  

He looked back up at the stretch of sand in front of him. then again back down at the map he was holding. He'd been stuck in this loop for the past few minutes, constantly comparing the area around them to the map he was given and then double-checking his work every time it seemed to match up. Everything was correct, except for one important detail: the *"massive stone monolith that towers into the sky"*, the one supposedly housing the dungeon, which had been marked on the map as being right in front of where they stood, was nowhere to be seen. Kaiji looked back up one last time as he put the map back in his bag, turning his gaze to the barren patch of sand that purportedly contained this giant tower of rock. There was nothing there.

Kaiji groaned. "Alright, they're definitely screwin' with us. We already *knew* they were screwin' with us from the start, but this is just blatant." He shook his head, once again speaking in his trademark Brooklyn accent. He had a tendency to slip into it whenever he was angry or annoyed, and he'd been feeling plenty of both ever since their visit from Alakazam that morning.

Kris whimpered as he reappeared from behind a large mound of rock, panting heavily and stumbling back over to where Kaiji was standing. "Th-there was no sign of it past that hill, either..." he whined, his thick coat of fur drenched in sweat. It was already bad enough living in a tropical town on the coast when his species was more adapted to snowy mountaintops; assigning him to make the trek through the scorching desert and search fruitlessly under the beating sun for something that not even the *map* could correctly locate was setting him up for failure.

Kris fought the urge to collapse, his tongue lolled out of his mouth in a futile attempt to lower his body temperature. "I-I don't think it's anywhere, Kaiji... th-they probably just saw a mirage. L-let's just turn back..."

Kaiji shook his head. "If we give up, there's nothin' to go *back* to. We've gotta put up with this bullshit for now, 'cause otherwise-"

Kris cut him off, staring into the empty space above him as if he was talking to someone taller. "W-Weston, I'm serious... th-the prediction I got this morning might've been hazy, but I've never been more sure that we're in danger! W-we should *really* turn back..." The Absol squinted, looking around as if searching for something. "W-where did Chansani go off to? We could really use a Rain Dance right now..."

Kaiji stared back at his partner with concern, electing not to ask what any of that was about once it became clear he was delirious from the heat. Kaiji quickly dug through his bag, taking out his half-empty flask of water and pressing it to Kris' lips. "Geez, d-drink up before you pass out!" He could hear his accent wavering, but it was a bit harder focusing on keeping up the character when he was practically melting under the desert sun himself.

Kris drank the water desperately, and the two of them sat there quietly as they both took turns sharing the last of his supply. Kris looking down solemnly as he started regaining lucidity, and Kaiji didn't dare broach the subject of whatever his partner had been talking about earlier - he could already tell how uncomfortable he was just thinking about it.

Their silence was soon interrupted by an all-too-familiar squeaky voice. "GUU**UU**UUU**UU**UUUYS! I FOOOOO**OOOUU**UUUUND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIITT!"

Kaiji groaned loudly, turning his head towards the source of the yelling. Some ways away from them, Ronnie stood in front of a totally barren patch of sand, gesturing excitedly at absolutely nothing.

Kaiji stood up, returning the now-empty flask to his bag as he made his way towards Ronnie. "THE HELL DID YOU FIND? YOUR MISSING BRAINCELLS?" he yelled back, feeling the anger return to him as his ears were disgraced with the Numel's grating voice. It was only by obligation that they'd even brought him along on the mission; a certain amount of teams were required to successfully seal a rift in order for the guild to be allowed to exist, and Alakazam insisted that Ronnie counted as an explorer because he'd previously joined them on one of their expeditions. Kaiji was absolutely certain that the rule had been made up on the spot just to cause them extra grief, but he had little choice other than to roll with the punches.

Despite Kaiji's immediate hostility, Ronnie repeated himself. "NO, IT'S REALLY HERE, M**A**N! YOU JUST GOTTA COME CL**OS**ER TO SEE IT!"

Kaiji bared his claws, ready to beat some sense into the Fire-type. "Oh, I'll be coming over there alright..." the Meowth muttered, his patience for Ronnie already past its end. Due to his typing, Ronnie was much better suited to the arid climate they found themselves in, and with the newfound energy from the bright sun and high temperatures, he'd been talking nonstop for the entire journey over... much to the dismay of his two teammates. 

However, as Kaiji finally got within a few meters of Ronnie, the landscape around him shifted. A massive pillar of stone materialized out of thin air before them, towering into the sky farther than they could see - it was impossible that they could've missed spotting something of its height and size under normal circumstances. The desert around them suddenly became engulfed in a swirling whirlwind of sand, stopping only a few meters from the tower - about the same distance Kaiji had to approach before he could see it.

Kaiji's amazement at the stone tower's sudden appearance and shifting scenery was eclipsed by only one other miracle."...Ha! You were actually *right* about something for once. You should savor it!" he snickered, giving Ronnie a patronizing pat on the head before calling his partner over with a shout. "HEY KRIS! THE DUNGEON'S OVER HERE, YOU JUST CAN'T SEE IT FROM OUTSIDE!"

Kris joined them a minute later, emerging from the illusory sandstorm around them. His sullen mood quickly faded as he began to marvel at the unusual scenery around the dungeon, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Wow... I didn't know there were dungeons that could be hidden like this! At least... not something this big." He tilted his head up and stepped back as he tried to see to the top of the tower, only giving up on the endeavor after inadvertently backing out of its range of visibility. "Does... it even have an end?"

Kaiji shrugged. "We're gonna hafta find out the hard way. We don't have any time to waste, and it's clearly gonna take us a while to get to the end of that thing, so let's jus' find the entrance and get in there." Kaiji started walking along the edge of the pillar, motioning for the other two to follow. It only took a little over a minute of walking before they'd circled about halfway around and came upon an opening in the otherwise solid rock. It was about 7 feet tall and equally wide, rounded at the top, and straddled the line between natural roughness and deliberate design in it shape well enough that it was hard to tell if it was natural or monmade in origin. From where they stood, the inside appeared pitch-black, even where sunlight should be able to seep in near the entrance... making it impossible to judge the contents of the interior.

Kaiji took a moment to think about their situation. They'd been told nothing useful about the dungeon, and even from right outside, they weren't able to gleam any more information about it. They'd be heading into dangerous territory, scarcely-prepared and entirely unaware of what lied ahead... but waiting out here wasn't going to help anything, and they didn't have time to sit around and twiddle their thumbs. It was clear they had no option but to head inside, and Kaiji was the first to do so, not seeing any point in delaying it. "C'mon, we're gonna be unprepared whether we go in now or later. Might as well get outta the damn sun..."

Knowing they'd have to go in no matter what if they wanted to save the guild, and that they'd only be getting hotter out here, Kris and Ronnie followed closely behind him, and the three of them crossed the threshold into the dungeon proper.
