#Time Together

Christopher sighed as he studied the no walk-in sign hanging from the restaurant’s front door. At his side, Faith was struggling not to laugh. This was the fifth place they’d tried.

Thanks-A-Latte’s proprietress had been absent.

The restaurant they’d eaten at for their first date had a no walk-in sign.

Faith had vetoed WcDonald’s.

Hifumi’s favorite ramen place had a sign that read ‘with the Mrs..’

And now, the random family restaurant with below-average reviews was filled to capacity. If Christopher had known what a big deal White Day was, he’d have tried to make a reservation earlier in the year. Maybe if he’d started looking around Valentine’s Day they could’ve found a table.

“There’s a maid cafe down the street.” Faith offered helpfully.

“Singles only,” Christopher grumbled. He’d looked that place up in desperation this morning.

“Oh.”

Christopher glanced down the street. His eyes fell upon a squat brick building with a neon sign shaped like a pizza. There was no sign and no line! The date was saved!

“Isn’t that a--” He couldn’t even finish his sentence before a familiar monkey girl dragged a sign out of the restaurant’s front door and propped it at the entrance before heading back in. Christopher didn’t have to read the sign to know it’d tell him much the same as every other restaurant’s sign had. It was closed to new business.

“We could just go for a walk,” Faith offered. “See what’s open?”

“I guess it’s down to that or my place.” Christopher acknowledged before grabbing Faith’s hand and walking down the street towards downtown. There’d have to be SOMETHING downtown. Faith’s hands felt like they were on fire. He looked behind and noticed Faith’s eyes were as wide as saucers and her face was a bright crimson.

“You okay?” Christopher asked concerned. “Do you have a fever?”

“N-no,” Faith muttered hurriedly. “I-I’m fine, let’s just walk.”

Christopher didn’t accept that. He looked around quickly. His eyes alighted on an unoccupied bench at the side of the road. He pulled Faith towards the bench.

“Seriously Chris I’m fine!”

“Humor me.” Christopher requested as he sat her down on the bench. He joined her and put an arm around her. She was burning.

“Fuck Faith if you weren’t feeling well why didn’t you say something?”

Faith sighed and buried her face in his chest. “You’re an idiot.” She mumbled.

“Hrm?”

“Nothing. Just give me a minute.”

So they sat, wrapped in each other’s arms for an indeterminate amount of time. One wondered if he should try to salvage this date, or get his date home so she can rest. The other wondered how dense a motherfucker can be.

“You know,” Faith finally broke the silence. She’d made a decision. She lifted her face from Christopher’s chest and looked him in the eye. “You’re supposed to give the girl three times what she gave you on Valentine’s Day.”

“I know,” Christopher said proudly. He’d done his research. “I’ve got three handmade chocolate hearts in my bag.”

“…” Faith closed her eyes.

“What?”

“Put a pin in the homemade chocolate.”

“Okay?”

“But chocolate’s not all I gave you.”

“… Uh.” Christopher tried to remember what else she’d given him. Losing patience, Faith grabbed his collar and pulled him in for a kiss. She held him there for a long moment before releasing him, breathless.

“Oh.” Christopher breathed. He cradled Faith’s cheek with his large hand. They had shared… quite a few kisses on Valentine’s Day. “You want me to triple the number or time?”

Faith smiled devishily. “How about I tell you when you’re done?”

Christopher leaned in close, his breath growing hot, “Yes ma’am.”
