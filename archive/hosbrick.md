INTRO
- The weapon and stigma will be in the same banner. Has 30 pull guarantee counter (max 120 pulls for full set)
- Brick can be tuned and synced to give global +10 ATK
- Weapon Lore: The magical weapon created by the Herrscher of Sentience using her own power has no physical entity like its creator, so it has been nicknamed "not a physical object". It has no substance, that is, it is ever-changing, and one is equivalent to a thousand. It is said that according to the needs of actual combat, "Ignorance of Current Affairs" can instantly change into the appearance of any weapon.
