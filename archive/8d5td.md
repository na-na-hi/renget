>I recently was sent to Tokyo to help with a marketing campaign my company was starting there. Life was unfulfilling as I wasn't able to integrate well or make friends easily so I retreated into hobbies like watching vtubers. It wasn't long before I realized I had a real bonified vtuber living next to me, a sweet young angel called Mr. Towa. I never really had a chance to say hello after always being burnt out from work and retreating into my apartment to relax. Not only was Mr Towa respected as a vtuber she was known around town as an all around swell person. 
>One day after a late day at work I decided to have a few drinks to unwind. And when I say a few, I mean a little bit more than that. Admittedly I got a little sloppy and after finally finding my way to my door I struggled to locate my keys eventually realizing I no longer had them as it began to rain.
>There I was panicking at my door, a stranger in a foreign harsh land, I saw her. Mr Towa looked so striking in the moonlight, her emerald eyes and purple hair were seemingly glowing as she stared at me with her umbrella. 
>She walked closer and said: "Is everything alright?" 
>Embarrassed with myself I stumbled with my words: "I-I-I'm so sorry to have disturbed you Mr Towa. You see I've lost my keys and I'm a little drunk so I guess I made more of a racket than I first thought. Gomen..." 
>Mr Towa seemed like she was struggling to think of how to respond and then eventually started walking towards me. 
>As a fan I was in awe and shocked by the situation as she closed in to shelter me with her umbrella.
>There I was trapped between her and my door. Her emerald eyes still glowing in the moonlight...her face so close to mine. I couldn't hold back and blushed while quickly darting my eyes away. 
>I eventually mustered the courage to gaze back at her shyly brushing my bangs behind my ear. 
>She broke the silence: "Do you need a place to stay or would you like to come up to my place to figure things out?" 
>A little shaken up I reluctantly agreed as she led me inside. 
>She sat me in her living room, went to the bathroom to get me a towel which she threw over and started making tea. 
>As I awkwardly sat in her living room I went to gaze at the safety of my phone as an escape, realizing that it had become to saturated with water, or maybe it had run out of power and needed to be charged.

>"I'm so sorry to ask for more Mr Towa, but it seems my phone isn't working..."
>"Your phone isn't working?"
>I paused thinking maybe was lost in translation as what appeared to be a devilish grin came across her face.
>"I'm sorry, I mean to say that my cellphone isn't working as I pointed to it?"
>She responded "Tea's ready! Do you take milk with yours?"
>"Yes, please..." I responded, watching the same devilish grin come across her face again as she ran back into the kitchen and began rummaging around.
>Moments later she came back and handed me my cup of tea.
>"This is delicious Mr Towa! What kind of tea is this?"
>"Oh it's just a local blend which I added some spice and love to." she responded.
>A blush came across my face again, "It's actually pretty wild that I ran into you tonight Mr Towa...I'm actually a fan...I watched your stream last night...you're so cool..."
>"Oh, that's so sweet thank you for watching, I never would have expected you to be a fan...how do you feel right now?"
>"Much better than earlier in the day. Work was rough...it's been difficult not knowing anyone around here..."
>"Oh you don't know anyone around here, that's so fortunate."
>"Wait what?..."
>"Oh I'm sorry, my english isn't so great."
>"Haha it's no problem, I realize my nihongo isn't that jouzu myself"
>"Keep telling me about your day as you finish your tea to warm up."
>"heh, well after work I went to burger kind to get a Tokyo teriyaki tower burger"
>Mr Towa interrupted..."You what?...borgor..." as the devilish grin left her face. 
>"Oh...uh...sorry, I forgot about the meme...I didn't mean any offense..."
>"It's no problem anon, you can't help these things. Please continue."
>"So anyway, after that I just felt so bad about everything I tried to drink my misery away at the bar and well...I think you know the rest..."
>Mr Towa seemed a little distracted by something looking at her clock on the wall.
>"I guess I just also wanted to really thank you Mr Towa, aside from being one of my favorites, you were so kind to me tonight...this may sound a little strange...but for a moment there when I first saw you standing outside...you looked a little like an angel in the moonlight..."
>Mr Towa abruptly slammed her hand against the coffee table. 
>"Towa is deviru! Not angel!"
>"I...I'm so sorry Mr Towa. I think maybe I've worn out my welcome...I should leave...I can find a cab and I should find a hotel too..."
>I started walking towards the door as Mr Towa pursued me closely.
>I struggled to try and open her several locks to leave. "heh I guess you need the extra protecting what with security concerns and all"
>There I found myself closely pinned against a door with Mr Towa. Her enchanting green eyes hypnotizing me. Her arms were now at either side of me keeping me in place. 
>"Mr Towa...you're scaring me..."
>It was at that point I felt a little off. My vision began turning white and I felt my face become flushed.
>"How queer Mr Towa, I don't feel quite right...what kind of tea was that again?"
>My strength left me and I collapsed into Mr Towa's arms. She had that grin again...
>Slightly rocking back and fourth I thought "Maybe Mr Towa is trying to wake me up, I still feel so strange..."
>I quickly realized I was no longer wearing any clothing...maybe Mr Towa didn't want me staying in wet clothes...after all I could catch a cold?
>I gazed down to find myself strapped into a harness, nipple clamps and Mr Towa propping my right leg up. She was thrusting herself into me.
>Completely baffled my mouth became agape in shock.
>Internally I knew I should feel so scared but was the best pleasure I could have ever imagined. 
>As she noticed me coming to she responded "Oh good, you're awake...keep your mouth open, I need to clean up."
>She quickly pulled her massive erect cock out of my ass leaving every orifice of mine agape in me in awe.
>She walked along the bed side grabbed by my hair and inserted herself into my mouth and throat, just as quickly ejaculating inside me.
>"That taste...so familiar" I thought to myself.
>Towa seeing my confusion smiled again at me and said "What, I thought you said my milk was delicious..."
>I couldn't lie or hold myself back...it was. I began working my mouth around her shaft to try and squeeze out ever drop, slowly working my way down her shaft sucking her balls and trying to get my finger into her ass to milk a little more from her prostate. 
>She quickly pulled away slapping me, pinning me down and choking me. "You got a little too greedy there anon...."
>"I'm so sorry Mr. Towa."
>"That's better...now let's clean you up."
>She led me to her bathroom with the collar and leash she had placed around my neck. Took me to her shower, quickly inserting an enema nozzle into my ass to wash me out. After she was done with that she squirted some dish washing fluid on me and hosed me down. Afterward she led me back to her bed to dry me off. 
>"uh...Mr Towa...what time is it...I think I need to go to work."
>"Anon...what if I told you I have a job for you, here in my apartment. There's no need to leave ever actually...and I have all of the food you need here" indicating for me to look down at her cock which was now erect gain
>"Mr Towa I love you but..."
>"The only butt here is yours anon." She said as she inserted herself once more into me but now more gently and lovingly as she spread my legs to the side and began to kiss my neck.
>"Mr Towa..." was all I was able to mutter as I began to enter back into a state of ecstasy.
>Now I live with Mr Towa as her servant and have never had a more nourishing diet of cum in my life...no more Tokyo Teriyaki Tower burgers for me...I have the real deal. My angel...
