    **CoT (Chain-of-Thought)**

[TOC4]

!!! info preamble
    CoT is not a panacea and not a wonderful magic button to make your RP/stories better in one click
	it is an idea - prompt paradigm - one of dozens; a mere tool that you must be aware of, but not shoehorn it pedantically everywhere


#### RELEVANCY AND REASONING PROBLEM
imagine a dumb ==LLM== (*LLM = Large Language Model, like Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral...*) with no understanding of what "the sky" means, what is considered "the good," and what is "creativity". the only thing LLM can do is obey simple [natural language commands](https://www.deeplearning.ai/resources/natural-language-processing/) like *text-classification, summarization, translation...* based on the datasets (corpus) it has been trained on

now imagine you give that LLM a huge story worth of 20,000 tokens and order LLM to complete a story under arbitrary rules like "develop the story slowly", "apply complex and varied sentence structures", "include exaggerated ~~ahh ahh mistress~~, onomatopoeia"...

>**relevancy issue**
now the questions:
- which of those 20,000 tokens LLM shall take into consideration when generating a new piece of text?
- should it take data from 2,000 tokens ago?
- or from 5,000 tokens ago?
- that story seems to be having 200 messages and like 10 story arcs: which are relevant?
- what **IS** relevant anyway? is the state of weather relevant? what about clothes on characters? maybe some detail from loredump?

what LLMs will do? they most likely will read *the start of prompt* for instructions, and read *the last few paragraphs* and continue from them. that's their default state

why?

LLMs are trained on the idea that usually the most relevant information comes **at the end**; for examples, books are designed this way: each next sentence continues the previous one. in addition LLMs know that usually the most important information goes **at the start**: like the current task, stats, examples (*shots*). [whatever happens in the middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) is a harsh mystery

**remember**, LLMs *have no memory and cannot plan ahead* - `they generate one token at the time: right here, right now`; totally unaware of what they will create at the end. they have *no* notion of relevancy because cannot plan relevancy. unless they are provided with specific instructions what to output (*like OOC command*), LLMs will have no idea what to give you back - and will produce **statistically average responses**, coupled with [inhered biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13947)

***
>**reasoning issue**
another issue is that LLMs have insufficient reasoning because they *cannot comprehend and remember* which facts to carry on:
- do characters stand in front of each other?
- what clothes do they wear?
- how affectionate are they?
- what tragic story each of them be having?

for you, all characters may be the distinct individuals, but for LLMs they are just tokens. the pony "Rainbow Dash" and her relationship with pony "Applejack" makes sense to you, but in artificial eyes of LLM they are just noise that need to be averaged based on probabilities:
- Applejack wears Stetson hat not because LLM remembers it from 20,000 tokens ago - but because statistically in text Applejack wears it
- Pinkie Pie doesn't fly not because LLM understands intrinsic differences between pegasi, earthponies and unicorns - but because in text Pinkie Pie doesn't fly (unless on balloons on something...)
- Twilight Sparkle is portrayed with wings not because LLM favors season 4 onwards - but because the majority of texts describe her as alicorn with wings, with only a small fraction of text show her as a pure unicorn
- Rarity says "darling" not because LLM understands her verbal tick - but because story writers write her that way, and LLM figured a statistical correlation between "Rarity" and "darling"
- Rainbow Dash acts as abrasive flamboyant not because LLM *gets her*  - but because Rainbow Dash is listed as a [classic tomboy archetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tomboys_in_fiction) all over Internet, and LLM applies various tomboy-related quirks and tropes to her
- Fluttershy quickly falls down to submissive role in any NSFW not because LLM prefers to dominate over nervous shy horse - but because people in fanfics show her as deeply submissive in any relationships
- tired of pony examples? LLM writes that all dicks are huge not because it checked them all, - but because erotic fiction authors ALWAYS write that male characters sport the huge dicks and LLM learned that. for the same reason vaginas are "tight as vice", and the common random event is "knock at the door"

LLMs are dumb auto-complete machines that `predict the next token based on what they have learned`. they know that statistically after the verb "take off" goes the noun "clothes" and hence writes that characters took off their clothes... but LLM does not consider the fact that both characters are *already naked* from 2,000 tokens ago. users say that LLM is **hallucinating** but it does not know any better: it operates on stats not on reason 

#### WHAT IS COT AND AUTO-REGRESSION?
==CoT (Chain-of-Thought)== attempts to solve those issues

!!! info 
	**CoT provides an outline/map** of how the LLM should respond, allowing:
	* better reuse of existing tokens during generation (**boosting in-context relevance**)
	* retrieve information stored in LLMs' intrinsic corpus  (**boosting parametric memory**)
 	* articulate how it should complete the generation in the best possible way (**boosting reasoning**)

CoT's core idea is to **force LLM to write a detailed plan/reasoning on how to complete the task and then execute it**. by giving LLM a space to explain its thinking we can achieve better responses. it's important to note that *you are not providing the plan* for LLM; LLM *itself* writes its own ideas 

==CoT== was originally [coined by Google in January 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903). the scientists provided significant evidence that LLMs would accomplish tasks better if initially **fed with exemplar plan** on how to solve similar tasks. LLMs learn how explanation works, and then re-use it for other queries and tasks. notice how on the image below LLM is given a pattern: `Question 1 -> Answer with explanation -> Question 2 -> ?` and then LLM provides *its own reasoning how to solve second question*
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1186425305699733635/20231218_203843_SumatraPDF_42830.png)
 
 
about four months later, [Japanese scientists alongside with Google employees concluded](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) that **LLMs don't need an example at all** - they can fill in all the blanks themselves. scientists have introduced ==Zero-shot-CoT== (or *example-less CoT*), which asks LLM to `Let's think step by step`. these magic words cause LLM to write its own plan and then utilize it for a detailed answer
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1186426620752441434/20231218_203958_SumatraPDF_17172.png)
 
 
the current [CoT meta by Google themselves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409) is (unironically) `Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step`. yes, Google is recommending to tell our LLMs *to take a deep breath* before describing plap-plap in vivid details
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199805020019884042/20240124_225441_SumatraPDF_01774.png)
 
 
ever heard of ==give model time to think==? well, that's CoT, just in Layman's terms. CoT is universal prompt paradigm, applied and actively encouraged by all major LLM developers: Anthropic's [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/ask-claude-to-think-step-by-step), OpenAI's [GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/give-the-model-time-to-think), Meta's [Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/get-started/#prompting), Google's [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/text_quickstart), you name it
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199803879739641947/time_to_think.png)
 
 
we may call CoT **a buffer zone** that first grabs all relevant tokens from the current prompt and general knowledge (corpus), and then provides an actual output based on whatever tokens it stored 
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187093306543460432/how_cot_works.png)

***
>**why the buck it works?**
**one word - ==auto-regression==**
all current LLMs are based on the [Transformers architecture, developed by Google](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), which was built with auto-regression in mind. auto-regression allows (or forces) LLM to take into consideration *ALL tokens* when generating the next token, **including the tokens generated by LLM itself**. which means that the outline and steps created during CoT will influence the following token generation
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1186446069400358912/20231219_011423_SumatraPDF_14886.png)

***
>**what does it mean in practice?**
1) LLM reads a prompt:
```
Rarity loves
```
it has two words: "Rarity" and "loves". LLM checks its corpus (parametric memory): who is Rarity? what does she may love? and concludes that it might be a character from MLP and she loves... ` fashion`
2) LLM reads again:
```
Rarity loves fashion
```
now LLM has three words to work with. what LLM can do next? it does look like a complete sentence, and LLM can put a dot and stop, but it re-checks and concludes that nothing stops it from generating more words, right? there were no instructions to be concise, and it doesn't look like LLM was queried a question, so it decides to continue further with ` and`
3) LLM reads again:
```
Rarity loves fashion and
```
now it has four words and it certainly cannot be a complete sentence, because statistically sentences don't end with 'and', LLM must continue. it checks the corpus for tokens probability again and picks next best option

...after a few more steps LLM finally finishes the sentence: `Rarity loves fashion and`~~` bend over`~~`be a drama queen.` at every step LLM reads ALL tokens including the newly generated ones. all together they influence the next picked token.

#### COT-BASED PROMPT DESIGNS (SELF-ASK, MULTI AGENTS, TOT, SC)
now stop and think about it. if we are tasking LLM to do *the same thing* across multiple calls, then shouldn't we start observing common questions-answers patterns in LLM's reasoning?
for example, we give LLM a huge RP and tell to continue it with CoT. we quickly notice that LLM in about 70% asks itself: 
>"what is characters' motivations and relationships?"
knowing that, can we cut off the chase and deliberately query LLM:
>"when continuing RP please ask yourself what is characters' motivations and relationships"
and furthermore, can we dissect more of such common questions? and maybe form in a list?

yes, indeed we can!  [it is called](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350) ==Self-Ask== (*or Self-Ask CoT, or Self-Circuit*). with such CoT we firsthand **craft a specific set of questions** for LLM to answer before continuing with response itself. CoT will emulate thinking and reasoning under our guidance

even better - by providing LLM logical steps in form of questions, it can simulate that query on different set of task, notice the example on image below:
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199833791565414431/20240125_002154_SumatraPDF_20524.png)
 
 
now another thing
what if instead of giving LLM the questions, we task LLM to collaborate with itself? like take a problem and solve it step by step **from different angles**, then improve the answer via *self-critizing*?
[that's an option too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05300) and is called ==Multi Agent Self-Collaboration== (*or MA CoT, or Train of Thought*)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199852851506196480/20240125_020450_SumatraPDF_10028.png)
 
 
a very based hands-on demonstration of that design is [Big Niggas](https://www.chub.ai/characters/petrus4/de345010-dd38-4d69-916b-5e3101e568f8) card - LLM takes role of *three street-wise homies* and reason with itself on given theme
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199871702251868260/big_niggas.png)
 
 
another idea!
what if instead of self-reasoning with itself like above, LLM *re-reads its thoughts via separate prompts* and decides whether its previous reasoning was correct; then will either move one step further into solving problem, or move one step back and try another approach if it was wrong?
yes, [that's possible too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) and is called ==Tree of Thoughts== (*or ToT*)
the core idea behind ToT that **each step is a separate prompt**, which gives LLM ability to *reflect on the task and current steps* and see whether the problem is solved correctly
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199851737696178227/20240125_020027_SumatraPDF_12056.png)
 
 
==Multi Agent Rounds== (*or MA Debates*) is [similar to ToT concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325): we provide LLM a task, which LLM solves a few times (samples). then those samples are **analyzed by LLM itself via fabricated experts** in a few rounds until all experts *agree on one correct sample*
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199854849861353553/20240125_021007_SumatraPDF_52344.png)
 
 
Multi Agent approach is [very close to](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171) ==Self-Consistency== (*or SA*) design where we tell LLM to solve a task multiple times (samples) and then we pick the sample **that appears the most often** (assuming if certain answer appeared the most, then it is *most likely right*)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1199850705058529291/20240125_015620_SumatraPDF_27235.png)
 
 
but that's just a tip of the iceberg - the quest for the best CoT never ends. [open ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/advanced?advanced=&terms-0-operator=AND&terms-0-term=Chain+of+Thought&terms-0-field=all&classification-computer_science=y&classification-physics_archives=all&classification-include_cross_list=exclude&date-year=&date-filter_by=date_range&date-from_date=2022-01-01&date-to_date=&date-date_type=submitted_date_first&abstracts=show&size=50&order=-announced_date_first) and you will see *hundreds of papers* discussing CoT prompt ideas, benchmarking, issues, biases, etc

#### HOW TO DO COT? PROMPT AND SNIPPETS
>**basic idea and overview**
for our needs we will be using **Self-Ask CoT** but with a *twist*: instead of providing questions for LLM to answer, **we will provide PLACEHOLDERS  for LLM to fill**

an example of a working CoT is below 
(check JB on the left, then CoT in the middle, then response on right):
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1186759790031015956/CoT_example.png)
 
 
>**structure**
the general steps are:
1) think of **items to include into CoT**. it can be anything, see examples below for inspiration
2) put those items into **XML tag**. historically /aicg/ uses `<thinking>` tag and thus calls that technique `thinking prompt`
3) surround XML tag with \`\`\` **codeblock** \`\`\` (read below why)
4) **place <thinking> anywhere in prompt**, usually anons put it at the end of JB, but you can also place it at stay of Main 
!!! danger don't put CoT into Prefill! 
	remember, Prefill is the words that Claude says verbatim - and you need for LLM to process CoT and fill the placeholders, not to cite them!
5) add an instruction to **start the response with <thinking>** (preferably before CoT or in prefill)
6) add an instruction to **follow <thinking> template and fill placeholders** (preferably before CoT or inside CoT)
7) and an instruction to **continue the response further with <thinking> in mind** (preferably after CoT or inside CoT)
8) after you have received the response, **you should [delete CoT](#regex-to-deletehide-cot)** (unless you know what you are doing)

***
>**prompt example**
utilize the following *boilerplate* to create your own Self-Ask CoT:
```` typoscript
Start response with <thinking> box, strictly following this template. Fill placeholders:
```
<thinking>
* I am {{char}}
* My body is XYZ
* {{user}} did X so I will do Y then Z
//...add your own items here

I will use that plan to continue the story further.
</thinking>
```

Here is the next roleplay response, following the format. Start with <thinking> box:
//...for Claude - you can put that line ^ into Prefill
````
experiment with wording to see what works the best for you

***
>**usage with other JB?**
it *depends* how specific JB is structured but overall, **yes** CoT can be used with any JB
CoT typically goes *at the end of JB*, so nothing is stopping you from using CoT with any JB, but things *may* break
mind there are plenty of JBs with already pre-built CoT so check them first

***
>**CoT content**
what to include into CoT? anything you want! experiment and see what works for you. here is an *approximate list* what to include into CoT (to inspire you)

***
>**why XML tags?**
you may wonder why we use <thinking> XML tags at all, can't we just write "read that CoT and complete it"?
indeed *we cannot*, for the reason that we have not 100% certainty LLMs themselves know what "CoT" and "Chain of Thought" and "Self-Ask" stand for. instead of relying on random chance of LLM picking up on our lingo, we **shoehorn everything into XML tags** (which are universally understood by any LLM)

***
> **why codeblock and why placeholders?**
filling placeholders is *the most basic NLR operation*, also known as [fill-mask](https://huggingface.co/tasks/fill-mask). all LLMs can naturally understand that `XYZ` are *the blank gap to be filled*. smart models can understand it without additional instruction, while models with fewer parameters may need a simple nudge like `Fill placeholders` or `Complete the gaps`

three backticks ( \`\`\` ) is a Markdown / Commonmark syntax for [any code indication](https://commonmark.org/help/). Reddit [uses](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043033952-Formatting-Guide) three backticks for code, Stackoverflow [uses](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help) them for code, Discord [uses](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617) them, even Rentry - everyone uses three backticks for code. it is **a universal code-indication in digital form**. LLMs have read Internet and know that content between three backticks is *usually* a piece of code, or some important information. and the trained to consider that content **LITERALLY**

accent on the word "*literally*". consider an example below.
1) we want LLM to fill the gaps, which it is doing perfectly
2) ...but we want LLM to *follow our initial format precisely 1:1*. so our first initial idea is asking LLM `to follow format`, which is somewhat fine but still with derivatives
3) ...but if we put an initial template `into a codeblock` then LLM will follow it precisely, because for LLM anything between three backticks shall be taken literally and followed as close as possible (*that's also the reason why we put various stats-trackers into a codeblock*)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187250995479183381/pet_cat.png)

the combination of two factors: a) codeblocks leading to more precise following, and b) placeholder XYZ can be filled by LLM freely - allow us to **create CoT with placeholder**

#### REGEX TO DELETE/HIDE COT
one thing that many anons don't consider or miss completely: **you MUST delete CoT once it is done** 
>**why?**
1) it is *dummy data* anyway. it is a subproduct (or noise) needed to generate a better response. once you get your response, CoT has completed its purpose and is irrelevant. it is just **a waste of tokens** now
2) if CoT is still present in the prompt, it may (and will) influence further generation, leading to **biases, self-copy, and repetition**

>**how to delete?**
you can always delete CoT manually, but if you want to optimize the process, you should use Regex

**Regex is located in** ***EXTENSION*** **->** ***REGEX***
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187084589815038064/regex_location.png)

==option (A) - **HIDE** and **DELETE**==
- that preset will hide and delete CoT: you will not see CoT being generated in real time, and will see only the actual response itself. CoT will be auto-deleted (so you will never see it)

#### CONSIDERATIONS PITFALLS FAQ
> **CoT may take a HUGE amount of tokens**
depending on LLM and content of CoT, it may take a HUGE amount of tokens on generation, **easily surpassing 800 tokens and beyond**
- check your proxy's `maxOutputTokensOpenAI` and `maxOutputTokensAnthropic` to ensure you don't hit the limit (and daily limits if applicable)
- if you are paypigging (API, OpenRouter, etc...) then a bigger output may lead to a fatter bill at the end

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187084605023596604/max_context.png)

***
> **content generated with CoT is influential**
because of auto-regression and because of their location - the tokens generated by CoT will affect the further generation very much, possibly steering story into unexpected direction or making character to act OOC, if you don't control what you been having in CoT. so **pay attention on what you are requesting here** and think how it may influence the possible generation

***
> **JB incompatibilities**
depending on your current JB - CoT (or JB itself) may break. it is especially true for JB that utilize Claude's prefill excessively. in case of issues first try to proceed with empty JB to eliminate all possible interference

***
> **scenarios incompatibilities**
CoT, like many other JBs, *may* have trouble with **cards offering multiple characters or scenarios**. because usually `{{char}}` is considered to be a singular entity (a person), not some abstract concept (an adventure, a scene, a quest...). you will probably need to create a specific CoT for those cards


#### COT PROMPT DESIGN
some ideas and notes on what to include in CoT
> **I am {{char}}**
by starting your CoT with `I am {{char}}`, you will *significantly boost* the general quality of next steps because:
a) LLM *will adopt {{char}} persona early* and drop being "AI Assistant"
b) will make the next steps *more introspective from the character's POV*, unlike the abstract narrator

mind that - it *may* influence your response *to become from a first-person view*, if you don't need that then throw `write the story in the third-person view` somewhere in JB

***
> **plot summary**
including a story summary is a good idea to boost plot visibility for LLM to reuse it later

for need of plot retelling, the term `extract` might be better suited than `summarize`, since `summary` usually means "*tell as short as possible*" while `extract` forces to "*proceed data as close as possible*". `review` usually has a connotation of "*add your own opinion into the piece and retell in your words*" which might suit you better depending on what you need

* and don't be afraid to make separate story queries into small chunks: `How exactly my library was destroyed?`, `I met {{user}} and X Y Z happened?`, `What happened after I returned home? First X then Y then Z`,
* or to ask {{char}}'s relationship with plot-devices: `What do I think about {{user}}'s magical amulet?`
* or with other characters `What do I think about the princesses?`


***
> **retrieving {{char}}'s definitions**
telling LLM to list special *characteristics, traits, body, mind, and other attributes* will help to reinforce them. if {{char}} has some **special quirks** like it is a size-difference RP then include instructions like `I am much bigger than {{user}} so I will X Y Z`. it is important when {{char}} has non-standard anatomy like *equine, furry, monster-girls, tentacles* - force LLM to acknowledge those features and proceed from there

if {{char}} has special writing or speech patterns then forcing LLM to recite them in generation can help in getting more aesthetic responses. it is ESPECIALLY important for **shy or mute characters** who don't talk a lot: allowing them to express their feelings via CoT will aid with better personalization while they keep their traits further

body position and limb position is the HUGE issue for LLM. you may try to rectify that problem to some degree with CoT but don't fret if LLM still writes impossible sex positions or able to communicate through the walls. just accept it as a fact

***
> **{{char}}'s agenda**
remember that **LLM are passive by default** and just complete the sentences. forcing *a certain goal / agenda / task into {{char}}'s mind* can improve the general experience and steer LLM into more nuanced writing. usually it can be done with simple acknowledgment of {{char}}'s desires like `I want X`, `my instincts are X`

in some cases you may reinforce it further with instructions like `I will aggressively seek my goal X Y Z`, `If my goal cannot be completed I will force it with X Y Z` - instructions like this are *good in grimdark / dom situations* when you see that LLM are sugarcoating or shying away from pushing thry

***
> **cause-effect relationship and plan ahead**

force LLM to think in a step-by-step way - `X happened so I will Y`, `{{user}} did X. Based on Y I shall do Z`, `How should I react to X? I will do Y then Z`. LLM have trouble logically continuing what it writes and falls into tropes and repetition. if it sees a **step-by-step plan** LLM will follow it and contribute to *more coherent writing*

while doing so also ask {{char}} to consider probabilities and unknown factors. {{char}} is not omnipotent: it can be misguided, biased, assume things incorrectly, be victims of aberrations, etc. by throwing items like `I might be wrong about X Y Z` or `I don't know X so will not do Y instead do Z`, you may strike a **more nuanced and less predictable generation**

also query your {{char}}: *what do they like? how do they feel? what do they need to?* - those little questions may influence future actions and allow LLM to re-utilize that information into writing

but most importantly - **allow LLM to criticize / argue with its own thinking**. LLM are dumb and can produce the wrong results. yet, they are capable to catch up the obvious errors in their own thinking if the wrong answer is fed back to them
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187132449772273694/crtitize.png)
a typical pattern here goes like that:

* ask LLM to create a plan
* tell it to criticize its own plan
* ask LLM to create a better plan (preferably step-by-step)

you can also add querying the "unknown factors" in between the draft and final plan to provoke LLM to consider alternatives: `draft -> what I don't know? -> critique -> final plan`

however be careful and **do not overdo it**: being too precise about the plan and forcing {{char}} to criticize it a lot *may produce a distilled / stale plan* since you are over-reviewing items. striking a good balance between thoughtfulness and meticulousness can be tricky

***
> **X Y Z and other placeholders**
shall you use `X Y Z` or simple `X`? honestly from my testing they do *the same things for all big-brain models*. in theory, they should lead to various answers (single `X` for a single element and three `X Y Z` for more writing/text), but I never witnessed a true correlation. however **using `X Y Z` is still more preferable** since it can help low-brain local models

aside from `X Y Z` you can also utilize other placeholder patterns:
* `X then Y then Z` to create a step-by-step template
* `do X, maybe Y, never Z` / `do X, maybe Y, preferably Z` to create a short-circuit self-criticizing
* simple `yes/no` for example `Is this scene NSFW? yes/no? If yes then...`

***
> **general instructions**
you are not limited to introspective instructions and can safely **apply the general rules** too, for example `I will write very verbosely, describing events in rich details` or `instead of telling how {{char}} feels I will express emotions via actions (ex "she is sad" => "she puffed the cheeks in indignation")` or `I will write in direct language suited for a mature audience`

because of CoT, those instructions will appear in the generation itself, influencing the following tokens. you can also use the general `I must do...` and `I must avoid...`

***
> **{{random}}**
utilize {{random}} macro to create **variable items** in CoT, for example `{{random: I fear X Y Z, I hope for X Y Z, I require X Y Z, my body wants X Y Z, my mind wants X Y Z}}` - this way your CoT will vary the generation aiding in different results

another example: `I will avoid {{random: interruptions, ending in open-ended way, being brief, pontificating, purple prose, repetition}}`
or: `{{random: I take inspiration from stories X Y Z, I will emulate writing style of well-known authors X Y Z, I will add the esthetic and mood into story: X Y Z}}`

***
> **per-character CoT**
with a bit of fiddling you may create a general all-purpose CoT with an option to pass additional per-character rules
1) first, split your CoT into two parts. keep opening tags and some rules into native JB, and move the closing tags and the other half of the rules into the next custom prompt template. example:
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1175955538882859038/1187177273535766539/cot_break_2.png)

Jailbreak:
```` typoscript
Start response with <thinking> box, strictly following this template. Fill placeholders:
```
<thinking>
* I am {{char}}
* My body is X Y Z
* {{user}} is X
* My special traits are X
* My body placement is X
* Me and {{user}} are X
````
Jailbreak - end
```` typoscript
* My plan: X
* Known factors: X Y
* Unknown factors: X Y
* I might be wrong about: X
* Plan criticism: X
* Better step by step plan: X Y Z
* I will use that plan to continue story further with slow pacing
</thinking>
```
````
2) open *Character's card -\> Advanced Definitions -\> Prompt Overrides -\> Jailbreak*
3) put there

```` typoscript
{{original}}
* //...your custom rules 
````
...this way you will be able to create special per-character rules that will be auto-inserted between two halves of CoT

***
> **table-based CoT**
not recommended since it will use too many tokens without showing much of improvement. however just as a proof of concept, you may create a table-based CoT, allowing LLM to iterate through variables and comment on them. the general prompt goes like this:

````
Start response with <thinking> box, strictly following this template. Fill placeholders:
```
<thinking>
| Keys | Values |
| -- | -- |
| My name | {{char}} |

Keys: {My name, Body, Mind, Important aspects, Personality, Current body position, Props, Characters in the scene, {{user}} is, Me and {{user}} are, Story so far in relevant details, I want, I don't know, I know, Current agenda, My story plan, Critique of my plan, Actions critique, Final step by step plan, Writing critique}
</thinking>
```
Then continue story further using created template as the writing instruction.
````

#### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
!!! info 
	a huge thanks to **[Hmage](https://dumb.one/gpt/)** who introduced me to CoT back in LGAcord in summer of 2023. his passion to AI, dedication and knowledge are *remarkable*, as well as patience to my stupidity. that rentry is essentially a decapsulation, review and meta-analysis of everything I have learned from him and studied on my own. if not for him - that rentry would have never existed 🐎🐔
