!!! danger TL:DR
	# /vAI/ and all other voice AI related threads are dormant for now.
	# Quit shitting up /vtai/ and /wAIfu/ by asking for voice AI generations, threads, or guides.

This rentry aims to answer some questions regarding /vAI/ and the state of voice AI threads on /vt/. There's a lot of misinformation being spread about the current state of voice AI, especially from the people of /vtai/ who have to regularly chase voice AI enthusiasts out of their threads. If anyone asks from now on, direct them to this Rentry and tell them to leave the thread.

### "Did /vAI/ get banned?"
**No.**
This can be easily proven through the trashcan icons on [Palanq.win](https://archive.palanq.win/vt/search/subject/vai/). Of every /vAI/ thread that has existed in /vt/'s history, there is exactly *one* thread that has been actually removed by jannies (for spam), and every other one have properly been archived off of the board. For comparison, take a look at the trashcan icons for threads like [/ag/](https://archive.palanq.win/vt/search/subject/ag/), [/meat/](https://archive.palanq.win/vt/search/subject/meat/), and [/ringo/](https://archive.palanq.win/vt/search/subject/ringo/), where there's a lot more obvious janny interference than /vAI/.

### "If you guys aren't banned, then where are your threads?"
Dormant.
At the moment, ***there are no good FOSS voice AI solutions.*** Most all of them are either inefficient, inaccurate, locked behind paywalls, or don't allow for voice cloning because of "muh ethics". As such, **we can't make generations since there's no tools to make them.**
Of all the Skynet /vt/ threads, /vAI/ is currently the only thread that has this issue. /vtai/ has Stable Diffusion, /wAIfu/ has Pygmalion and OpenAI proxies, and /swarm/ is basically no different from any other specified VTuber general. */vAI/ effectively has nothing.*
There have been some wonderful strides behind the scenes, however nothing is concrete at the moment. As such, /vAI/ will stay dormant indefinitely.

### "What about all the deletions that were happening during /vAI/'s heyday?"
That whole situation was more about people posting NSFW in a blue board rather than the jannies going after voice AI specifically for any sort of legal/ethical reason. The situation that happened there is no different than the vacations that happen whenever someone posts porn in /vtai/ or ERP caps in /wAIfu/.

### "Where can I find old /vAI/ generations?"
Reps.

### "But the Pastebin got deleted..."
We're not going to spoonfeed you. Do your goddamned reps.

### "What can I use until /vAI/ comes back?"
[Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion](https://rentry.co/rvc101).
This is the AI program that all those kids on YouTube ([and the Shiori threads](https://rentry.co/yoo4r)) are using to make AI covers of pop songs. There's also [a Google sheet of VTuber models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvZSggOsZGAPjbMrWOAAaoJJFpJuQlwUEQCf5x1ssO8) that some unrelated dickswordfags spun up recently. Download whichever models interest you off of that, and RTFM to get started.

### "If RVC works, why haven't you guys made /vAI/ threads using that?"
**Because RVC is not a complete solution.**
RVC works by adapting existing speech or singing into the voice of the model in question. As such, unless you're good at VA or can find close enough source audio of the voice in question, it will never be accurate.
What we truly need for /vAI/ to come back is a good neural TTS that can replicate speech mannerisms and emotional context of a speaker, which at the moment doesn't exist. We've got a close eye on the ever-changing AI scene though, so you'll know when it's time for /vAI/ to come back.

### "Horse?"
No one likes you people. Go back to /vtsg/ or get the fuck off this website.
