To simplify things, there are two types of items in gameplay, regular and special. 
 
You can carry two regular items at a time, use them up, or drop them. Only one item can be active at a time, the currently active item will be held on your hands, while the stored item will be on your back. If you're carrying two items already, upon picking up the next one, you'll drop the currently active one. 
Regular items include rocket launchers, cooldown drinks, vegeta gloves, shield recovery device, scouter, and senzu beans. In addition, if the raider is Vegeta, an additional item may appear, Yajirobe's Sword. With the exception of senzu beans, you drop your regular items upon being downed.
 
Special items are everything else that doesn't follow these rules. With the exception of Dragon Balls, these will generally stick with you the whole match, serving as a powerup. This includes change power, radars, zeni, capsule cases, Power Keys and Dragon Balls.

Regular items
 
Rocket Launcher:
A shoulder fired bazooka. Deals minor damage and drains about half of the raider's knockback gauge. If it drains the gauge, it will knock the raider back, and make them drop their dragon balls. Has a large explosion radius and will automatically explode when near raider, making it a very reliable tool.
Found in: boxes, vending machines (base price: 1000 Zeni)
 
Super Rocket Launcher:
A gold plated version of the regular rocket launcher. The only difference is that it has 3 shots instead of 1, and is rarer.
Found in: boxes
 
Vegeta's Gloves:
Gloves that give you a power to fire off a galick gun. Deals about a third of bar of damage to the raider, and makes them flinch. It's harder to hit than a rocket, but the ability to knock the raider back in one shot and accumulate chip damage has be
Found in: boxes
 
Scouter:
Scanning device that can locate civillians and the raider through walls at a distance almost as large as the range of lvl 2 radar. However if you point it at a raider for more than a few short seconds, it will explode. In addition, you come to a dead stop when using it.
Found in: boxes
 
Barrier Recovery Device:
At the start of the match, you possess a barrier that will allow you to survive a single hit from the raider or their summons. Once you're out of barrier (which can be seen by the glowing red circle around you), you can be downed with the next hit. This item will recharge that barrier. Takes around 5 seconds to activate, during which you can move and jump, but will be cancelled by other actions.
Found in: boxes, supply drops
 
Senzu Beans:
The ever famous beans that can bring you back from the brink of death. When choosing to revive someone while you're holding onto them (don't need to keep them active), you will feed them the bean and revive them immediately. Unique in that you don't drop them when you are downed, instead if you have been downed, but wasn't finished off by the raider, you have an option to eat the bean yourself. Be careful however, since because you have already been downed once, if the raider downs you again and finishes you off, they will immediately kill you.
Found in: boxes
 
Cooldown Drink:
Soda can that restires your D-Change cooldown after you've transformed. Can also be drank while transformed to preemptively decrease the timer. The amount restored depends on your Dragon Change level, more powerful transformations require more to come back.
Amount restored:
Level 1 - 80%
Level 2 - 45%
Level 3 - 40%
Found in: boxes, supply drops, vending machines (base price: 4000 Zeni; of note is that unlike the other vending machines that allow you to get two of their sold items, you can only get one cooldown drink per machine)
 
Super Cooldown Drink:
A stronger variant of the cooldown drink. Same rules apply, but it restores more power.
Amount restored:
Level 1 - 90%
Level 2 - 75%
Level 3- 70%
Found in: boxes, supply drops

Yajirobe's Sword:
A special item that spawns only if playing against Vegeta. When used, you will fly forwards (or towards the raider if locked on) and perform a melee hit. It deals low damage against most stages, but it gets a buff against Great Ape Vegeta, when used against his tail it will deal a whole bar damage, provided you manage to land it. Can also be used to interrupt the raider.

Special items 
 
Zeni:
Money that can be spent to buy items at vending machines. Of note is that it appears that any Zeni found is immediately given to all players, however everyone has their own pool of money to spend on things. In other words, if player A find 1000 Zeni, every player on the team gets 1000 Zeni. When player B uses 1000 Zeni to buy a rocket launcher, he's back to 0, but everyone else is still at 1000.
Zeni is found in 2 forms, as an item that has to be picked up, found in boxes and destructible items, with value of 500, or in random destructible items, with a value of 50, visible as a fountain of coins.
 
Change Power S:
A glowing orange cube. Grants a small amount of dragon change power.
Found in: destructible items, boxes, supply drops, dropped by civillians when rescued (3 cubes)
Required cubes to power up:
0-\>1: 5 cubes
1-\>2: 10 cubes
2-\>3: 13 cubes
 
Change Power M:
Appears to give twice as much power as Change Power S. Found exclusively in vending machines.
Base price: 2000 Zeni
Required cubes to power up:
0-\>1: 3 purchases
1-\>2: 5 purchases
2-\>3: 7 purchaes
 
Change Power L:
Appears to give four times as much power as Change Power S.
Found in: boxes, supply drops, destructible items (rarely)
Required cubes to power up:
0-\>1: 2 cubes
1-\>2: 3 cubes
2-\>3: 4 cubes
 
Keep in mind you can mix and match these, a single power S with power L will fully charge your first level, and any combination that totals 10 (assuming S is 1, M is 2 and L is 4) will likewise raise it to 2.
 
Power Key:
The key to activate the Super Time Machine. Each of the surrounding areas (A to E) has one in a random box decided at the start of the game. Once picked up, any player can place it, so if you have a power key radar, it may be wise to start searching for the next one instead of sticking around to place it yourself. Keep in mind that the power key appears as a bonus alongside another item that can be located in boxes. While the raider can open a box with a power key, the survivors still have to approach it to claim it.
 
Radars:
Devices that can be used to locate other useful items, depending on the variant. Civilian Radar will locate civilians, Power Key Radar will locate power keys and so on. 
You can pick up multiple radars of different types, combining their functionalities, provided you don't already have them.
Once picked up, the radar cannot be dropped, and it will be lost if you are downed and killed.
Dragon Ball radar has 3 tiers, which increase your detection range. If you possess one, you can pick up another, provided it's of higher level.
Interestingly, the increased range also applies to civillians and power keys if you possess those as well, meaning that if you have a lvl 3 dragon radar and a power key radar, you can detect power keys from further away than if you just had the latter. Keep that in mind before you go on your own little adventure to gather all the dragon balls.
Uniquely, the radar can be used while on a vehicle, making it a good pair with Expert Driver to make quick searches.
Finally, keep in mind that the raider is capable of picking up and using the radars as well, if you can't pick up a radar, make sure to ping your team, so that hopefully someone else gets it.
Found in: boxes, destructible items.
 
Capsule Case:
When activated, they will open, revealing another item. This can include Rocket Launchers, Senzu Beans, vending machines, vehicles (which use your equipped vehicle skin) and even the Saiyan Pod if it's on open terrain. There could be more, these are just what I got from memory and quick tests.
Found in: boxes, destructible items
 
Dragon Balls:
When you gather all 7 of them, you can make a wish to turn the tide of battle. Unlike other items in this category, they can be dropped, however they occupy their own slot separate from regular items, and a separate input to drop them. A neat thing is that you're able to drop them while on a vehicle, letting Bulma Bike users serve delivery to whoever will be doing the wish.
Much like radars, they can be picked up and used by the raider.
Besides using the dedicated input, survivors will drop their dragon balls if they are downed. Raiders on the other hand will drop them just by getting knocked back, allowing the possibility of stealing the balls back.
The wish has to be performed at one of the dedicated altars, with there being one per area, for a six total.
Once the dragon balls are placed at an altar, they're stuck there until the wish is complete, or the area is destroyed, and they send off a giant beam of light to the sky. In order to get your wish, you have to perform a summoning ritual at the altar for around 12 uninterrupted seconds. One change that was made in Season 2, is that if an area with an active altar is being destroyed, the person attempting to make the wish will pick all of the dragon balls up from the altar, allowing them to run away and immediately make the wish elsewhere, so area destruction will now only momentarily delay the summon against most teams.
Survivors get access to two wishes: I want to get stronger and Give my allies power
- **I want to get stronger** will give you a level 4 transformation, and is generally considered to be the only right option. At lvl 4, you will always be capable of melee combat with the raider, whereas lower levels would get swatted away, and uniquely, the transformation does not have a time limit, nor does it spend energy on its super attack or ki blasts. That means the only way for the raider to stop it, is to whittle down their gauge with damage. Once you run out of charge, the transformation ends, and you revert to the level of power you had before activating the wish.
- **Give my allies power** will give everyone on your team enough energy to raise them to the next level, no matter how close or far they are to it. If you're already level 3, it doesn't do anything. If you're 1 small cube away from the next level, that's as much as you'll get from it. It will also not restore your D-change cooldown. For these and many other reasons it's considered a meme option.
 
Cell and Buu get these two options:
- Give me even greater power: increases evolution level by one
- Heal my wounds: restores HP
Either option is fine depending on the circumstance, the most important thing is to deny the wish to the survivors
 
Freeza in addition gets:
- Make me immortal: stops you from taking damage altogether, although it doesn't stop flinching. This effectively means that the only win condition survivors have is the time machine. Now, it might seem redundant to have this wish in addition to the healing wish, however Freeza recieves evolution energy from being damaged, an ability which he loses should he gain immortality. And in all fairness, could the survivors really finish you off from full health after that point? On the other hand, being forced to evolve during STM phase will give survivors precious seconds to work the machine.

For Nappa and the Ginyu force, Give me greater power is replaced by "Show me an ideal future". It functions effectively the same, bringing them to the next stage, only with the stipulation that the previous stage character survived: i.e. it's as if they've filled their evolution gauge rather than if they died.
Vegeta instead gets "Show me a full moon", which also raises him to next stage, but it also restores a bit of his health and changes the sky.
 
Once a wish is made, dragon balls will vanish, and it will not be possible to regather them in the match. Also, if dragon balls are present in an area when it is destroyed, they will be scattered outside it, much like survivors.

Dragon Balls can either be found in boxes, when playing against Cell/Buu/Vegeta/Ginyu, or on Namekian civilians when playing against Freeza.
