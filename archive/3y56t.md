!!! info 
	Nijisanji EN members have been added. Please note that this work was done by another kind anon and I have not double checked it with my normal test methods but judging by the test images he posted, they seem like good tags. Also note that his prompts were done with a 3.1 mix and will likely not work on base hll1. I will be updating this rentry with a 3.1 mix relevant section soon.

#hll
Might give it one more pass but this should be good.
##Notes:
!!! note
	All basic appearance tags were tested on model "hll-epoch-00015" at Sampling Steps 28, Method Euler A, Width 512, Height 768, and CFG Scale 11 on seed 847181942, second test on seed 2263102481 and confirmed.
!!! note
	The basic prompts included the positives "masterpiece, best quality," and the negatives "lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name, monochrome, censored,"
!!! note
	The secondary test prompts included the positives "masterpiece, best quality, indoors, red dress, wide hips, thick thighs, medium breasts, underboob, sweat, arms behind head, armpits, seductive smile, standing, 1girl, solo, steam," and the same negatives as before.

Listed below are only the minimal tags necessary to reproduce the character consistently with no consideration given to their outfit. 

The hll model is very good at chuuba recognition so most of these will be pretty short but I will be going into further detail on a few other models as well (eventually tm).

If a member is not listed, I couldn't get her to work. This list will only include my personal favorite appearance a character has had.
Tags are written as intended and are NOT mistakes. If a tag is not recognized by danbooru, such as "irys," I am aware and used a "fake" tag on purpose.

Some seemingly unnecessary negative tags are included, such as "colored inner hair" for Miko despite her having no inner hair to color, for if you choose to give them a different hair style. However, using these negatives even when they are unnecessary will NOT negatively impact the prompt.
hll is obsessed with ears.

###JP:
####0th Gen:
#####Sora
	tokino sora, hololive, blue eyes, brown hair, long hair, red hair bow, gold star hairclip,
Negatives:	red hair, colored inner hair, blue hair, purple hair,
!!! note Note
	It will sometimes put her hair ornaments on the wrong sides or just duplicate the filled in star.

#####Miko
	sakura miko, hololive, green eyes, long hair, red hair, low twintails, ahoge, jingle bell hair ribbon,
Negatives: colored inner hair, ponytail, short hair, braided ponytail,
!!! note Note
	The AI's understanding of "low twintails," changes in a few ways depending on pose but this should generally work. 

#####Suisei
	hoshimachi suisei, hololive, blue hair, blue eyes, beret, mini crown, plaid headwear, grey headwear, (side ponytail),
Negatives: red headwear,
!!! note Notes:
	* It may try to generate a collar to put a star on, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie," to negatives to get rid of it.
	* Her ponytail being on the correct side is RNG.

#####AZKi
	azki, hololive, (dark brown hair), (pink colored inner hair), multicolored hair, pink hair bow, purple eyes,
Negatives: light brown hair, purple hair, purple colored inner hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* Her colored inner hair is very temperamental but this emphasis should keep it mostly controlled.
	* Her hair bow shape coming out correctly is RNG.

#####Roboco-san
!!! warning RIP

-------------------------------------

####1st Gen:
#####Mel
	yozora mel, hololive, ahoge, bat hair ornament,
Negatives: head wings, bat wings, colored inner hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* Sometimes she has multiple hair ornaments. Adding "short hair," seems to fix this but will often lose the unique shape of her hair.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Matsuri
	natsuiro matsuri, hololive, ahoge, aqua eyes, gradient eyes, side ponytail,
Negatives: multicolored hair, 
!!! note Notes:
	* Her ribbon is baked in and goes crazy sometimes, you can try to manually prompt a ribbon but results were shaky at best.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Haato
	akai haato, hololive, one side up, long hair,
Negatives: red hair, colored inner hair, brown hair, side ponytail,
!!! note Notes:
	* I couldn't replicate her weird fake twintails.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie," to negatives to get rid of it.
	* For Haachama beggars, simply change "one side up," to "two side up," and optionally add "eyepatch," Adding "haachama," may or may not add her hair ornaments, tests inconclusive.

#####Aki Rosenthal
!!! warning RIP
	You can kind of make her without her twintails but on most seeds it doesn't even give her the ~~head things~~ _pata pata_. "aki rosenthal, hololive, purple eyes, blue eyes, gradient eyes," if you really want to try.

Funny fox is in gaymers.

--------------------------------------

####2nd Gen:
#####Aqua
	minato aqua, hololive, pink eyes, maid headdress, anchor print, pink hair, blue colored inner hair, multicolored hair, twintails, long hair,
Negatives: beret, gradient hair, short hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* Her twintail hair color is all fucked and I found no truely consistent way to get it correct, this is just what worked on these particular seeds. You will have to go back and forth between "colored inner hair," and "multicolored hair," until it gets it or just fish for a new seed.
	* Fan artists are obsessed with putting her together with other beret wearing members, thus the negative.

#####Shion
	murasaki shion, hololive, grey hair, brown eyes, gradient eyes, (double bun), long hair,
Negatives: colored inner hair, purple hair,
!!! note Note
	I don't know a truly consistent way to get rid of her weird bun ties but sometimes they look fine. You can try adding "hair ornaments," and "green hair," to negatives though which sometimes works.

#####Ayame
	nakiri ayame, hololive, oni horns, red eyes, gradient hair, silver hair, red hair, twintails,
!!! note Note
	Her hair being red or pink seems RNG but if you add "pink hair," to negatives you will get neither.

#####Subaru
	oozora subaru, hololive, gradient eyes, 
Negatives: braid,
!!! note Note
	Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

	yuzuki choco, hololive, demon horns, black horns, demon wings, demon girl, demon tail, swept bangs, blonde hair, blue eyes, gradient eyes, green eyes, 
!!! warning `We have Choco at home.`
	This is just her NAI prompt and still has all the same problems the NAI one had. Probably just get an embed anyway.

----------------------------------------

	nekomata okayu, hololive, ahoge, cat ears,
Negatives: multicolored hair,

#####Korone
	inugami korone, hololive, brown eyes, twin braids, dog ears, dog bone hairclip,
!!! note Note:
	Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie," to negatives to get rid of it.

---------------------------------------

####3rd Gen:

	usada pekora, hololive, rabbit ears, twintails, orange eyes,
!!! warning `We have Pekora at home.`
	[`carrot hair ornaments,`](https://files.catbox.moe/b8wel4.ogg) is one of the base follies of man, resist it.

#####Flare
	shiranui flare, hololive, dark-skinned female, tan, ponytail, long hair, pointy ears,
Negatives: tanlines,
!!! note Notes:
	* Sometimes "dark-skinned female," isn't dark enough by itself, but you can try removing "tan," from positives and "tanlines," from negatives if you want.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Noel
	shirogane noel, hololive, red glasses, crown braid, blue hair ribbons, grey hair,
Negatives: headband, blue hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* You may want to add "belts," to negatives in some cases.
	* You may also want to add "blush," to negatives in some cases, I think the overtuning is because of the glasses being red.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Marine
	houshou marine, hololive, red eyes, yellow eyes, heterochromia, (twintails), long hair,

#####Rushia
	uruha rushia, hololive,
Negatives: cape, veil,
!!! note Notes:

----------------------------------------

####4th Gen:
#####Kanata
	amane kanata, hololive, gold star halo, purple eyes,
!!! note Notes:
	* Sometimes the center of her star halo deletes part of her head. You can add "grey hair" to fix this but it may fuck with the rest of her hair colors.
	* Her halo shape being actually correct is RNG.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

	himemori luna, hololive, purple eyes, green eyes, heterochromia, crown,

	kiryu coco, hololive, dragon horns, pointy ears, purple eyes, long hair, 
Negatives: purple hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* Her side braid is somewhat RNG. You can try adding "single side braid," but it might just make it worse.

#####Polka
	omaru polka, hololive, fennec fox ears, purple eyes, single side braid,
Negatives: colored inner hair,
!!! warning `We have Polka at home.`

#####Koyori
	hakui koyori, hololive, wolf ears, pink eyes, ahoge, crown braid, 
!!! note Note
	* Her hair ornament is baked in pretty hard and you are better off not trying to prompt for it. Her double buns as well, though sometimes you may have to prompt those.

#####Chloe
	sakamata chloe, hololive, 
!!! note Notes:
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace," to negatives to get rid of it.
	* Chloe seems to be the strongest name on this model.

#####Iroha

	* Her headband is baked in pretty hard, you shouldn't have to prompt for it.

----------------------------------------

###EN:
####1st Gen:
#####Gura
	gawr gura, hololive, long hair, two side up, 
Negatives: purple hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* Technically this is enough, however you are most likely going to end up wanting to put "shark, stuffed toy, holding object, pillow," or a combination of those tags in your negatives as necessary.
	* Even just her name by itself has a weird effect on any clothing item, you may need to add any number of things to the negatives to fix the myriad of problems she can cause.

!!! note Note
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace," to negatives to get rid of it.

	ninomae ina'nis, hololive, long hair, dark purple hair,
Negatives: colored inner hair, blue hair, light purple hair,
!!! note Note
	* I have no idea how to fix her well demon hair, it seems to just happen at random,

#####Kiara
	takanashi kiara, hololive, purple eyes, long hair, orange hair, gradient hair, green hair, 
!!! note Notes:
	* Her hair is significantly better on this model than most but it still gets messed up sometimes depending on seed.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Mori
	mori calliope, hololive, pink hair, long hair, pink eyes, tiara,
Negatives: colored inner hair,
!!! note Notes:
	* If you don't prompt for pink eyes it will give her red eyes by default, neither are correct.
	* Mori's outfit is baked in way too hard and it would take too long to list every possible thing you may need to add to negatives, just use your brain where necessary.

---------------------------------------

####Project Cope:
#####IRyS
	irys, hololive, purple eyes, blue eyes, heterochromia, horns,
!!! note Notes:
	* Her horns are baked in super hard, to the point where it will try to give her six of them sometimes, you can't really do anything about this.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace," to negatives to get rid of it.
	* I have no idea why she is so zoomed in on every seed. If you don't include "horns," it will even crop them out too. Including something about her legs should give you a better body shot.
	* Her old model is better.

--------------------------------------

####2nd Gen:
#####Fauna
	ceres fauna, hololive, yellow eyes,
!!! note Notes:
	* It seems to give her a really defined hair bun in place of her little tuft thing most of the time. You can add "hair bun" to negatives to get rid of it if you want but I've never seen anybody complain about it. 
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace," to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Mumei
	nanashi mumei, hololive, brown hair, brown eyes, ponytail, hair feathers, feather hair ornament, 
!!! note Notes:
	* Just "nanashi mumei, hololive, ponytail," is enough but it will regularly make images of her black and white unless you specify the colors as posted. I don't know why.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add `collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie, necklace,` to negatives to get rid of it.

#####Sana
	tsukumo sana, hololive, yellow eyes, dark-skinned female, tan, twintails,

	* Similar to Flare, sometimes "dark-skinned female," isn't dark enough by itself, but you can try removing "tan," from positives and "tanlines," from negatives if you want.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

--------------------------------------

####1st Gen:
#####Risu
	ayunda risu, hololive, squirrel ears, squirrel tail, green eyes, pink beret, brown hair, short hair, 
Negatives: ponytail,

Negatives: purple eyes,
!!! note Notes:
	* Sometimes it will try to make her yellow eye green. You can add "green eyes" to negatives to get rid of this but that will get rid of the green spot in her red eye and also sometimes switch her heterochromia around for no reason.
	* The bow on her chest from her outfit will sometimes just try to appear places but if you try to add bow to the negatives it will sometimes remove the one on her head as well.
	* The level of detail in her stiched skin is RNG.

#####Anya
	anya melfissa, hololive, purple eyes, brown hair, two side up,

#####Reine
	pavolia reine, hololive, silver hair, aqua eyes, high side ponytail, blue feather hair ornament, earrings, french braid,
!!! note Notes:
	* Reine is very seed dependant. Her face shape, amount of zoom and even art style just changes at random.
	* Has a collar problem similar to Suisei, you can add "collar, brooch, necktie, bowtie," to negatives to get rid of it.

---------------------------------------

	kaela kovalskia, hololive, red eyes, red hairband, blonde hair, gradient hair, red hair, red sunglasses on head, eyewear on head,
