#I Love Maids

Just a list of all the TavernAI cards I made
[TOC]
I heard some anons said that W++ is meme format. I already made them all in W++ but I also made the non W++ version for anons who believes W++ is meme. In my experience, the format doesn't affect the character much but the smaller tokens might be useful if you want to save token usage in OAI. But all future cards will be made in non W++ format since checking if all the weird bracket is in place is tiring. 

Remember that all the card shown here does not represent the real person and any action the bots take must not be mistaken for their actual personality. 
It is all fiction and just for fun.

All Cards made with W++ is tested using TavernAI + Pygmalion 6B. 
Haven't tested all the non W++ version on pyg but it should also work just fine on pyg as well from what I have already tested. 
I also included the numbers of Token for the non W++ for those who don't want to waste their OAI usage quota on cards with large amount of tokens.

###Before you ask, read the following:
**1. Why are they all PNGs, where is the json?**

Tavern cards has all the text bits embedded in the png file, you just need to import them into Tavern. 
Look for import button in TavernAI Characters selection UI and browse the PNGs you just dowloaded.

**2. Multi character card doesn't work properly?**

Multi character only works properly on OAI/GPT 3.5. If you use Pyg then I am afraid that it is not possible to make it work properly since it is the current limitation on pyg. You can try, but the quality wouldn't be that good.

**3. All the character keep barging into the conversation when I use the multi character card.**

Happens a lot when you want to be alone with one character or want to exclude a certain character in the conversation. Just type in the scenario on the character advanced edit page: "You and X and Y and etc... are the only one in the room." Doesn't work 100% of the time, but will save you a lot of tokens from having to keep regenerating messages constantly from everyone barging in the conversations.

**4. Help! The bots keep puppeteering me and putting words in my mouth!**

I noticed this happens very rarely with GPT 3.5 and more occasionally with the Multi-character cards. It just my own assumption, but the bots might have mistaken "You" as another character instead of well... (You). Though this is just baseless assumption and should be taken with a grain of salt. ~~The best advice I can give (You) is to edit out the "You" part the bot generate. It's a lot more cheaper than regenerating the message.~~
If you use Silly Tavern or other frontend that lets you edit the system prompt, try to add "Do not write {{user}} dialogue into the story" or some other variations into the main prompt. And if still doesn't work put it into your Jailbreak Prompt like the example bellow:
==[System Note: Do not write {{user}} dialogue into the story]==
Try to change the wording if it still doesn't work or maybe add "you" character into the prompt above if it keep generating You dialogue.
