I also propose that after someone is verified for a voting doc, that they do not need to repeat this process of editing a lore doc. It's pointless.
1. Approve land assignment confirmation for /hag/ as per picrel. Y/N/Abstain 
I would like to formally request the land as in the pic for nation of Lanudohagulovinugo (/hag/).
The reasoning for it being:
    - It had been the initial land given to /hag/
    - I have setup basic lore under the assumption that this was the land i was allowed to work with.
    - The conditions of the land like climate are suitable for my needs.

>Yes. /hag/ writer has shown tremendous energy towards their thread and per [this:](https://rentry.org/Provinces#im-a-new-rep-and-my-nation-has-been-provinced-but-i-liked-my-old-borders)
>>"If you are legitimately a new rep, or thinking about becoming a new rep, and want your old borders restored then not to worry. We will respect your wishes and restore them on the condition that you actually write for the thread that you represent."
>They should be honored. Furthermore, as to not repeat myself. I believe that the whole province doc needs to be put into a new document that clarifies the rules better as personally I see no reason for nations that were provinced claiming their original lands to have to get the approval of the thread via voting.

2. Approve land assignment confirmation for /tsunX/.(In the place of /tsun/) as per picrel. Y/N/Abstain
The reasoning for it being:
    - Their lore is tied to their land.
    -  That is their original spot and per the province system they can take it.
     - Their lore was posted when the system was being made which caused their provincing.
***
>Yes. /tsunX/ came in around the time that the system was being made, and I thinking before they were even formalized, which in that case it was just a mistake. Same reasoning as above, and I furthermore call on all reps to vote both of them in and consider my proposal
