+50: Well, they're still just a bunch of greenhorns.

## Helm
> Tried-and-true tactics or improvisation?
+100: **Tried-and-true tactics.**
+50: Improvisation.

> Octopus-flavored Splendamin. Halibut-flavored Splendamin. 

Things like that...
+100: **Not really.**
+50: I like it.

> Just so you know, I'm not a massive fan of any of them.
+100: **Spicy.**
+50: Salty.

> the surface will be reclaimed one day?
+100: **Yes, I believe it will happen.**
+50: ... I'm not sure.

> how do you intend to spend it?
+100: **I'll invest in the Admire.**
+50: Did you receive more donations than usual?

> It's been ages since I last got in touch with her, so I'd like to give her a gift. So what do you think I should give her?
+100: **A fancy tea set.**
+50: A fancy handkerchief.

> I'm trying to get her to kick the habit, but I'm not sure how to go about it.
+100: **I'll toss out all the starfish in Anchor's locker.**
+50: You can try tossing out all the starfish in Anchor's locker.

> Argh, I can't memorize all this!
+100: **Would it help if I listened to you reciting the speech?**
+50: Would it help if we recite the speech together?

+100: **Place a card containing small amounts of credit in the box.**
+50: Place one of Anchor's starfish in the box.

> I'm only asking, just in case.
+100: **I'm extremely good at it.**
+50: I sink like a stone.

> I haven't made any major blunders yet, but I'm worried it'll happen one of these days.
+100: **Don't forget who you're representing.**
+50: It's normal to flub a line or two.

> So the question now is, what is the first thing you should do?
+100: **There's no way you'd ever fall into the water.**
+50: I'd give you a kiss first.

> Don't ask me why, but all it ever does is float in a swimming pool.
+100: **I mean, people become dirty too if they don't clean themselves up.**
+50: Perhaps, that's the reason?

> It's not a st-starfish, is it?
+100: **That's a living, breathing starfish, all right.**
+50: Calm down. It's only a toy.

> or a strong but slow ship?
+100: **A strong but slow ship.**
+50: A lightweight but fast ship.

> What will you do, Subordinate?
+100: **It'd be meaningless if I didn't accomplish it myself.**
+50: I'd accept it with pleasure.

> For example, let's say... drinking on the job or throwing starfish.
+100: **I'd join them.**
+50: I don't have any subordinates like that, so I can't say.

> I can't just leave it behind, though. So I don't know what to do.
+100: **It's not like you can explain the situation to each and every single person you meet.**
+50: How about stabbing all passers-by?

> I don't mind people using the pool, but they should clean up after themselves.
+100: **I'll make sure it's cleaned from here on out.**
+50: ... Wasn't everyone out on an mission last night?

> or something we should beseech everyone to do, regardless?
+100: **Fighting for a just cause should be respected, no matter what form it takes.**
+50: If a cause is bound to fail, then it is meaningless.

## Noah
> Hehe...
+100: **Why are you laughing?**
+50: Laugh with her.

> What can I do to make myself even worse than them?
+100: **Just keep doing what you're doing.**
+50: What an oddball question.

> A real Commander stands strong, even in the face of Raptures.
+100: **It's not necessarily the commander's duty to be strong.**
+50: It all comes down to having different equipment.

> Why do they not simply leave them behind?
+100: **The weak also have roles to play.**
+50: The strong have a duty to protect the weak.

> Why is it like that? It's enough to make my stomach churn.
+100: **Because of food shortages.**
+50: Surprisingly, it's highly nutritious.

> Isabel found out I used to bully you.
+100: **Best of luck to you.**
+50: So what?

> What is an Ark Ranger?
+100: **It's a story of 5 masked heroes who vow to crush the Raptures.**
+50: It's a hit show that plays inside the Ark.

> Why do you take care of me even though I bully you all the time?
+100: **You're like a little sister to me. I can't hate you.**
+50: Cause I love... to hate you.

> Hyyaaah!
+100: **What the heck are you doing?**
+50: Hey, that hurts.

> Do you think I can touch it?
+100: **Are you talking about Poli?**
+50: ??

> If you think I'm actually gonna sit down and talk to you, you've got another thing coming.
+100: **... We can talk another day then.**
+50: Stand up to her.

> Take a guess what this is.
+100: **Harran's perfume?**
+50: Perfume?

> Do you think there's a limit to how strong someone can get?
+100: **I don't think so.**
+50: I believe so.

> Can you guess why?
+100: **Because they're as strong as you are.**
+50: Because all of you work well together.

> ... If I use my shield, do you think I can do the same?
+100: **You can learn from her.**
+50: I will just get you a skateboard.

> You can order me to do anything, and I'll do it.
+100: **You have to meow at the end of every sentence.**
+50: Transform into your final form.

> When have humans ever done anything for us?
+100: **As long as you continue walking your own path, you'll be fine.**
+50: True belief is greater than petty things like personal gain.

> Have you ever dozed off during a battle?
+100: **You mean you have before?**
+50: How is that even possible?

> Guess what we use them for. If you get it right, I won't bug you anymore today.
+100: **They're just for decoration.**
+50: They're used as a high-tech communication device.

> Have you ever thought about swapping it for a mechanical body?
+100: **I'm not opposed to the idea.**
+50: I want to become strong while remaining a human.

## Liter
> Hey, Greenhorn. Do you think my advice is useless, too?
+100: **Don't you remember what it's like to be young?**
+50: Advice is the greatest gift that the old can give the young.

> Would you clean it up, or just leave it?
+100: **I would still clean it up.**
+50: It wouldn't be so bad to leave it, right? Just once?

> But what do you think, Greenhorn?
+100: **It's about their safety, not their freedom.**
+50: Dogs deserve their freedom.

> Should I change my ways?
+100: **Being strict is a matter of safety.**
+50: I think a change might do you good.

> But, I'm worried that she might become too dependent.
+100: **Centi is not a kid.**
+50: It's okay. She has you to watch out for her.

> But every time I think about life without work, I get frustrated.
+100: **When that day comes, you'll find something else to do.**
+50: You should prepare for your retirement.

> ... Could she be lying about her age?
+100: **Maybe it's because of her high quality of life.**
+50: ... Maybe it's because you're less mature than you thought?

> I can only clean up after her for so long!
+100: **It's a bit of a secret, but Anis actually has a medical condition with her feet...**
+50: From now on, if you see her socks lying around, just come and tell me.

> Maybe I'm getting old... Or maybe I'm just tired...
+100: **Maybe it's because you don't find the work interesting anymore?**
+50: You just need a good rest.

> No one lives as comfortably as she does.
+100: **Bolt also has her own troubles.**
+50: I'm envious.

> I'm at a loss. What do I do?
+100: **Give him a piece of your mind.**
+50: Let it slide so your relationship can remain intact.

> But, aren't I a bit too old for that sort of thing?
+100: **Age doesn't matter when it comes to hobbies.**
+50: If you injure yourself at your age, you'll have a harder time recovering.

> If I get him a little brother to play with, he might not be as lonely.
+100: **Then you'll just end up with two lonely dogs instead of one.**
+50: How about bringing two more dogs?

> If you had to choose, who would you side with?
+100: **I can't choose. I see both sides.**
+50: I don't want any part in it.

> So, how old would you like to be?
+100: **I wanna become an old geezer.**
+50: I'd like to live as a hot charming middle-aged guy.

> What can I do to change things up?
+100: **I'll pack your lunch.**
+50: I'll ask Emma if she can pack you a lunch.

> What about you, Greenhorn? Is there any way you'd prefer to leave this world?
+100: **Surrounded by beautiful women.**
+50: Dying peacefully in my sleep.

> And for Anis...
+100: **Socks all strewn about?**
+50: Soda cans lying everywhere?

> Try guessing what food I like.
+100: **... Porridge?**
+50: Dog treats?

> So I just...
+100: **Did you sell it for a premium?**
+50: You didn't poke her in the eye, did you?

## Anis
> I want an honest answer.
+100: **Her face.**
+50: Her heart.

> I didn't go outside today.
+100: **Then shower twice!**
+50: Then you don't need a shower at all.

> Commander, what do you think I should do?
+100: **Not everyone finds joy in their work, and that's okay.**
+50: You can try to find joy in your work.

> So what if I leave my dirty socks lying around?
+100: **Socks? Where?**
+50: Because she's the one who does the cleaning.

> She's a firepower maniac.
+100: **That's why she excels at what she does.**
+50: You shouldn't say that about your teammate.

> So, which one is better in the end?
+100: **Chocolate-flavored Splendamin.**
+50: Chocolate.

> Sometimes I just can't figure out why we were put in the same squad.
+100: **Your differences are what make you work well together.**
+50: You have many strengths as well.

> ... Should I ask Mary for medical treatment?
+100: **Seems like you've been under a lot of pressure recently.**
+50: Did you apologize to Neon?

> But I don't think there is anything wrong with it.
+100: **Maybe because your shoulder is too heavy.**
+50: ... Anis, there's a person on your shoulder.

> Do you think it's a little bit...
+100: **You look gorgeous in it.**
+50: Bizarre? Kind of.

> No real reason, I'm just curious, that's all.
+100: **I would literally die without them.**
+50: I don't have much interest in them.

> How about you, Commander? Do you help others, or ignore them?
+100: **You should solve your own problems.**
+50: I can't ignore someone that is in trouble.

> They don't serve any purpose, and it seems like they'd be uncomfortable.
+100: **Don't you ever put down her glasses!**
+50: I'm not so sure myself.

> It might be better if it had a more mouth-watering name.
+100: **Juicy Perfecto.**
+50: Ultra Splendamin.

> If we were to show them our true colors, would they be averse to it?
+100: **You can't please everyone. Haters gonna hate.**
+50: If you're gonna put on a mask, might as well wear a cool Ark Rangers mask.

> I can't believe I'm saying this, but I may be a warmonger of some kind.
+100: **Your body is tricking your brain in order to survive.**
+50: What's so surprising about that?

> Having a girl shower in your room must make you a bit uneasy, right?
+100: **Uh...**
+50: It really doesn't affect me that much.

> If you're going through a rough patch, just let me know. I can help.
+100: **I'll try to figure it out myself.**
+50: She can be a bit... fastidious.

> It was the first time I had ever seen that dog, yet it made a beeline straight for me...
+100: **You must have felt uncomfortable.**
+50: You must have been happy.

> what would you want to do?
+100: **I would just sit back and do nothing.**
+50: I would complete my bucket list.

## Mary
> Or do you prefer it salty?
+100: **Both.**
+50: Neither.

> ... or be just a little sick for a long time?
+100: **Option 1.**
+50: Option 2.

> Even the bad ones?
+100: **No.**
+50: Yes.

> What should I do?
+100: **Give them a painful shot.**
+50: Sorry. From now on, I'll do whatever you say.

> Every time I see Pepper, I just get so excited!
+100: **Let me guess. You've found something to tease her about.**
+50: Does Pepper owe you money or something?

> How should I respond to that?
+100: **Tell her to keep her eyes half-closed all the time.**
+50: Tell her to be more of a buzzkill.

> Why are they all avoiding coming to the hospital?
+100: **They're scared of the hospital.**
+50: They're scared of you.

> But, Commander... don't you ever want other people to listen to what's on your mind?
+100: **I do.**
+50: I don't.

> I'm not a good person. Not really.
+100: **That's for Pepper to decide.**
+50: In my eyes, you're good enough.

> If I wasn't a doctor, what would I be doing instead?
+100: **A nurse?**
+50: Jabbing people with needles for free?

> If you have any good ideas, feel free to share.
+100: **How about we place some flowers?**
+50: Let's put in a video game system.

> Feeling compassion for their patients, or distancing themselves from the patients?
+100: **Distancing themselves from the patients.**
+50: Compassion for the patients.

> How on earth am I supposed to administer a shot to these people?
+100: **Distract them by talking about something else, then give them a stealthy jab.**
+50: Flash them a big smile.

> What do you think the patients would get a bigger kick out of?
+100: **Cosplay.**
+50: Concert.

> By the way, are you sure you're not forgetting something?
+100: **A checkup?**
+50: I don't think so...

> And the reasons are varied, such as because the manufacture is different, or the relationship was not good when they were human...
+100: **Anything I can do to help?**
+50: Even when you're around?

> Commander, how do you feel about white lies?
+100: **I think they can be a good thing.**
+50: I'm completely against it.

> why I still work as a doctor when I'm a Nikke.
+100: **This is your calling. You don't owe anyone an explanation.**
+50: And? Why do you think that is?

> They all ate the same food and ended up collapsing.
+100: **Do you have any suspects?**
+50: What kind of food was it?

> On that note, what traits do you look for in a person, Commander?
+100: **Being down-to-earth.**
+50: Selflessness

## Volume
> should I turn it up or down?
+100: **Up.**
+50: Down.

> Do You Love Me?
+100: **Is this the title of your new song?**
+50: Yes.

> When I look up, all I see is a ceiling instead of the actual sky.
+100: **Let's use music to blast a hole through it!**
+50: Let's drill a hole through it!

> I'm famished.
+100: **Bring her some water.**
+50: Bring her some Splendamin.

> But there's a saying that stars should always be ready to be photographed.
+100: **You mean you have to be ready at all times?**
+50: If you went through life like that, you'd constantly be on pins and needles.

> My body is in bad shape, too.
+100: **Why don't you take the day off?**
+50: Your voice does seem out of tune today.

> I'm not in the mood to talk. Please leave.
+100: **Play some peaceful music.**
+50: Ask her if she wants anything.

> what do you think it would be like?
+100: **A raging hip-hop party under the heavy rain.**
+50: A hot and heavy hip-hop blowout with fun under the sun.

> Is there anything you want? Name it, and it's yours.
+100: **A Romdady S supercar.**
+50: Buy me dinner sometime.

> Aria and I are radically different in style, so she's out of the equation.
+100: **You, of course.**
+50: Noise.

> Do you have anyone in mind?
+100: **I could do it.**
+50: I'll find someone.

> I ask myself that question sometimes.
+100: **I can't imagine you doing anything but rapping.**
+50: Probably some menial job at the police station.

> What do you think is the most important thing for a rapper to have?
+100: **Swag**
+50: Superb rapping skills.

> That guy getting the boot.
+100: **Everyone makes mistakes.**
+50: It was a one-time thing. Go easy on him.

> hip-hop or pop music?
+100: **Hip-hop.**
+50: Pop.

> what should I do?
+100: **Take 'em to school so they know not to mess with you again.**
+50: Just ignore them.

> What do you think of people who make their love life public?
+100: **I think it'll be good.**
+50: I think they'll end up regretting the attention they'll get from the public.

> I am planning to make a custom mic. Which color should I pick?
+100: **Black.**
+50: Yellow.

> Her operas are so crushingly dull, how can she play them so well without being bored to tears?
+100: **I think you could pull it off as well.**
+50: Everyone has their own specialties.

> What would you recommend?
+100: **Film some ads.**
+50: Go on a TV show.

## Pepper
> What can I do to change the atmosphere?
+100: **Change your gloomy hospital lights for brighter ones.**
+50: You should dance to cheer them up.

> Do you think that's true?
+100: **No, of course not.**
+50: You've dated before?

> Commander, where do you like to take your dates?
+100: **The movie theatre.**
+50: The library.

> Why do you think that is?
+100: **So they could see Mary.**
+50: May because they want to see you, Pepper.

> So, what do you think I should study?
+100: **How to cure a patient's fake illness?**
+50: How to kill someone with a smile?

> So, why do people hate coming to the hospital?
+100: **Because getting a shot is scary.**
+50: Because Mary is scary.

> I hope they suffer more than everyone they've hurt!
+100: **... I agree.**
+50: Calm down.

> What should we do?
+100: **Let's go on a date.**
+50: Clean the hospital.

> Commander, please tell me your definition of a real doctor!
+100: **Someone who works for the patient.**
+50: Someone with the skill to heal all kinds of patients.

> which one do you think can give you more energy?
+100: **Something refreshing.**
+50: Something sweet.

> I take it that means you're feeling well?
+100: **Fit as a fiddle.**
+50: Actually, I'm not feeling too hot.

> What do you make of that?
+100: **I find it all very romantic.**
+50: Doctors should treat their patients as just that: a patient.

> If I smile like this, do I look like her?
+100: **Your smile also comforts those around you.**
+50: Your eyes should be more moon-shaped.

> Is there any way to make it easier?
+100: **Give them some candy, like a lollipop.**
+50: You should use anesthesia.

> If you were in a private room, what kind of music would you like to hear?
+100: **Something light and hopeful.**

+50: Sad ending.

> Commander... what kind of scent do you prefer?
+100: **You smell good even without perfume.**
+50: That great hospital smell.

> Will there ever come a time when there are no injured or sick?
+100: **I'm sure that day will come eventually.**
+50: Um...

> When you look at me, what's the first phrase that pops into your head?
+100: **A doctor who makes people happy.**
+50: A highly-skilled medical professional.

## Drake
> Why?
Don't they understand I am a far superior being?
+100: **If you salute first, they will salute back.**
+50: Teach these stupid people how to act.

> Ha! Hahaha!
+100: **Hahahaha!**
+50: Hee hee...

> Haha! I'm pretty awesome, right?
+100: **... Do you want me to order it for you?**
+50: You are pretty awesome!

> So, I used my own strength!
I picked him right up!
+100: **How admirable of you.**
+50: You should've let him get up on his own.

> They're doomed for sure!
+100: **You have to save them, Drake.**
+50: You're right. These stupid humans are beyond help!

> There's no way she can win battles by relying so much on equipment!
+100: **Since Maxwell made them, they must be very effective, right?**
+50: They are just decoration.

> They're so annoying.
+100: **How many did you give them?**
+50: I know, it's annoying.

> So, buy me some Nutrium!
Right! Now!
+100: **Not before you finish your vegetables.**
+50: I don't have any money.

> Do you know what I'm afraid of?
+100: **Becoming too powerful.**
+50: Losing your life.

> But meat is limited, so we can't waste it on experimentation.
+100: **How about eating and cooking at the same time?**
+50: Challenging your taste is always fascinating.

> Can you handle watching horror movies on your own?
+100: **Horror movies are child's plays to me.**
+50: I can't stand horror movies.

> I hope we reclaim the surface soon so I can immerse myself in nature once again.
+100: **Summer is a perfect fit for you.**
+50: I'd have thought winter would be a better fit for you.

> In order to accomplish that, I'll go to the police station and...
+100: **have them put you behind bars.**
+50: free all of the criminals who are locked up.

> Can you believe that?! Me! An angel!
+100: **Tell them that you're no angel, but instead the ultimate villain.**
+50: Just block that person's account

> Do you know what a villain should do on a roller coaster?
+100: **Never close their eyes?**
+50: Not wear their seat belt?

> One of the employees must have screwed up.
+100: **Fried chicken is great even with the sauce.**
+50: File a complaint and send that employee packing!

> but I can't decide what I'd like to do.
+100: **Take up a high-energy sport.**
+50: Horticulture can be very therapeutic...

> If you could turn invisible, what's the first thing you would do?
+100: **Annihilate every last Rapture.**
+50: Rob a bank.

> When my time is up, what do you think I should have written on my headstone?
+100: **What?! You'll never die!**
+50: Here lies the ultimate supervillain.

> but she wants it super spicy!
+100: **Spicy fried chicken can be good, as long as it's mild.**
+50: Spicy chicken is the best!

## Diesel
> Are you bored or something?
+100: **Yes.**
+50: Nope.

> What should I do?
+100: **Give her some better strawberry candy.**
+50: No more candy for her.

> What can I do to cheer her up?
+100: **Ask Soline to stay away from Brid for a while.**
+50: Help Brid with some of her work.

> Commander, do you like soft flavors or strong flavors?
+100: **Strong.**
+50: Soft.

> AZX is coming through! Ding dong!
+100: **She's out of tune, but just let her sing.**
+50: She's out of tune, so tell her to stop.

> Commander, did you like Ark Rangers when you were a kid?
+100: **I was a huge fan.**
+50: I never got into them.

> What should I do?
+100: **The AZX is already perfect. No need to decorate.**
+50: Make it the same color as strawberry candy.

> what would you do, Commander?
+100: **Practice my singing.**

Why?!

> I don't like waiting to go up and down to and from the surface.
+100: **You could always spend that time waiting with someone you like.**
+50: You could cut the elevator cables.

> Don't you think that's unfair?
+100: **I would say so.**
+50: What are the two of you doing in someone else's room?

> Where do you think I can find the fabled blacksmith of legend, who can craft a legendary firearm for me?
+100: **This so-called "legendary blacksmith" is simply the fire and brimstone in your heart.**

+100: **Sweet.**
+50: Spicy.
