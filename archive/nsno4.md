#Legal Villainy

**BANG**

The sound of a gun shot slammed into Christopher’s chest. Through his goggles, through the camera Hitomi wore, he saw Ryusei make short work of the gunman. He saw the other robbers begin to respond. He saw the hostages stampede.

Christopher hesitated. He didn’t know what to prioritize. He could send Hitomi after the gunmen and neutralize the threat, or he could see to the evacuation of civilians. He could--

**BANG**

The decision was taken out of his hands as soon as one of the gunmen, a man that looked like an ant, fired his shotgun at the ceiling. He drove the civilians into a deeper frenzy. Angered that they didn’t immediately drop everything and listen at the fresh reminder of the peril behind them, the ant-man pointed his shotgun at the mass of human flesh jammed in the Bank’s doors. 

!>’Shit!’

Hitomi dove between the gunman and the crowd. She formed into a brick wall, shielding the civilians.

‘Civilians first then.’ Christopher decided. His mind raced as Hitomi, without urging, turned the camera  so that he could see the civilians’ situation. They were in a log jam. No-one was able to so much as open the door because the people at the back were pressing the people up front into it. To make matters worse, one of the robbers was in among the crowd, gasping for air.

The robber wasn’t the only one struggling to breath. Even Christopher could see that there were three other people suffocating in that press of bodies. He was amazed at how much was happening in a crowd of less than two dozen people.

Christopher shook away his amazement, it didn’t serve anyone right now, and tried to think of a way to get the civilians out the door while detaining the lone trapped gunman. An image formed in his mind. The image was of Hitomi spread out in a dozen tentacles dragging people back towards the floor just enough that she could open the door with another tendril and push them out into the waiting arms of the--

POLICE!!

Christopher unclipped the radio Hirito had given him from his belt and thumbed the mute button.

“—THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THERE?!” Hirito thundered.

“This is Mirror Devil. Situation--” **sortof** “--under control. Civilians will be coming out--” 

Hitomi formed a wiggling mass of tentacles out of her wall. She reached for the civilians. She wrapped them one-by-one in a firm grip. The civilians howled in terror but they were powerless to resist her. After she’d secured the last person she pulled the mob apart, giving those struggling to breath the space to gulp in air. It was perfect. It was like she’d come up with it. Christopher pushed down the thought. 

“–the front door. Hold your fire.”

“Roger that Mirror Devil.”

Christopher felt Hitomi strain as she pulled 22 shocked and struggling people a little away from the door. He felt her nearly break as she formed one last tendril and strained to wrap it around the door’s handle. She floundered. She nearly dropped her form. Christopher closed his eyes, he concentrated. He imagined her strain carrying all those people. He visualized her pushing through that strain and opening that door! With a trembling gasp she yanked the door open and pushed the first civilian out into the street. 

One after another Hitomi pushed the civilians out. Each one released into the arms of the authorities reduced her incredible strain. Until at last, there was only the robber left. The robber had passed out before Hitomi could get to him. Just as well. 

Christopher heaving from Hitomi’s and his shared exertion thumbed the radio on again.

“This last one’s one of the robbers. Please see that he’s detained.”

“Roger.”

Hitomi pushed that last robber out and her wall form collapsed into an exhausted, but triumphant, little black dragon.

‘Hitomi.’ Christopher whispered. He felt guilty for what he was about to ask, for not giving her any rest. He felt every bit of strain she did. Moving almost two dozen people like that while keeping her wall form? That had been an absurd task and he was about to ask her for more. ‘You have to lift your head at least. I need to see if Ryusei needs help.’

Christopher felt Hitomi huff in exhaustion. With no small amount of strain, the little dragon obeyed.

Ryusei was standing over the last robber, a woman, her finger severed. The woman who’d started the shooting with her acid quirk was staring up at him trembling. The man she’d scarred was on the ground screaming.

‘H—‘ Christopher didn’t even start the thought before Hitomi dragged her self over to the man. She pulled herself onto his chest and looked at his face.

Christopher swallowed bile as he beheld the man’s half-melted face. White bone peeked through skin. Liquefied eyelids flowed into pupil-less eyes. Steam continued to rise. Was that heat from a chemical reaction?

!>’Looks like Acid.’

‘Acid.’ Christopher diagnosed/ hoped. ‘Hitomi we need to get him some water to stop the damage.’

Hitomi turned towards the bathroom. 

‘That’ll work!’ Christopher agreed. He felt Hitomi stretch her tail under the bathroom door. She transformed her insides into a pipe, hooked her tail to the… sink? That didn’t feel like a sink. It felt like some sort of tank--

Before Christopher could question Hitomi’s water source, she grabbed the man’s face with her claws. Ignoring his protests she spit clear water into the man’s face. She’d have to keep that up for the next ten-twenty minutes, but it looked like the man realized she was helping. He’d stopped fighting her anyway. … Or maybe he’d finally passed out.

Christopher deflated. The stress of the last few minutes evaporated in a puff of smoke. There had been so many lives on the line, it’d seemed like too much to even hope no civilians would die. Ryu—Smokin’ Sexy had defied those expectations.

“Mirror Devil come in!” Hirito’s voice cut through Christopher brief episode of admiration. He raised his radio.

“Go ahead.”

“Smokin’ Sexy isn’t answering his radio, what’s the situation on the floor?”

Christopher blinked. ‘Why wouldn’t he-- Hitomi, I know you’re stretched right now, but can you--’ in answer the camera swiveled. Christopher saw Ryusei, laying face down on the ground. The blonde woman was gently shaking his shoulder, she looked like she was about to turn him ov--

>”Remember kids!” Loca Loca’s voice rang in his head, she was giving one of her mandatory rescue seminars. “Don’t turn an unconscious person over without securing their neck or it might--”

‘SHIT!’

Christopher shot down the staircase like a cannon ball. He slammed himself into the bank floor’s door causing it to swing open with a cacophonous BANG!

“Don’t touch him!” Christopher screamed at the blonde as he dashed for his mentor.

The blonde jumped away from Ryusei with a yelp. Christopher slid next to Ryusei. “Did you turn him?!”

“No!” The woman protested.

Christopher checked Ryusei’s pulse. He couldn’t tell you if the pulse was weak or strong, he wasn’t in the rescue hero class, but there was a pulse. He could feel the man breathing. Thank God! She hadn’t accidentally broken his neck. Though… he didn’t know what to do from here.

“Mirror Devil? Come in.”

Christopher raised his radio sheepishly, he didn’t have to do anything did he? He wasn’t alone. He answered. “Sorry, we need some EMTs, Smokin’ Sexy’s passed out, but still breathing. We have--” Christopher looked around counting. “--4 injured, one has…” Christopher looked back at the man with melted face.

Hitomi had ignored Christopher’s recent antics. She continued her ministrations, showering the now whimpering man’s face with water.

Christopher glanced back at the woman. She avoided his gaze. They both knew she was at least going to court for what had happened today. She might get off on the grounds that her life was in danger but, Christopher didn’t know Japan’s law as well as his dad did, she might just as easily go to jail for attempted murder. 

“...severe acid burns.” Christopher reported gravely. The woman shuddered. 

Christopher was conflicted. Someone had given him a break not too long ago. But… she’d had enough control to give him a break. 

Christopher had no such control. Between the victim’s injuries needing treated properly, the two dozen witnesses, and the records on his goggles which would need to be turned over… he couldn’t protect her. Maybe he shouldn’t. Maybe, given what he’d seen today, Rosethorn shouldn’t have protected him.

Maybe not, but she had in the end hadn’t she? Why? Because she didn’t want a stupid night to ruin his life? Christopher didn’t know if that was the reason, but he agreed with the sentiment.

“There’s a traumatized civilian that needs looked after too.” Christopher added. The woman shook her head, “I’m f--”

Christopher shot her a meaningful look. “She needs evaluation ASAP.”

The woman blinked, she wasn’t following, but she kept her peace now. Some part of her understood Christopher was trying to help her out of the stupid mess she’d been thrust into.

“Understood.” Hirito answered.

“T-thanks,” the woman whispered.

Christopher shook his head sharply. He didn’t deserve thanks, he wasn’t even lying for her. “Don’t thank me, you had a fucking gun to your head, you need to get looked at.”

Shakily, the woman nodded. The door to the front of the bank flew open and a team of police officers followed by four EMTs. Two of whom went for the acid victim. The other two came towards Christopher and Ryusei.

One of the EMTs was a small green man with a beaked face and what looked to be a pool of water in the crown of his head. 

‘A kappa man?’ Christopher thought. 

The other EMT was a massive woman, a mutant surely, but she looked like she could toss Kaylee over one shoulder and Maddox over the other. 

The officers spread out to confirm the room was secure, but the two EMTs slid next to Christopher.

“What do we have here?” The big woman rumbled.

“Impact trauma.” Christopher reported, backing away from his mentor. “Sternum, I think.”

The giant grunted an acknowledgment. With one hand, she secured Ryusei’s neck and with the other grabbed his leg and turned him on his back. She looked at the kappa. “Jun?”

“Hrm.” Jun mumbled as he gently rubbed Ryusei’s chest. Slick green suckers stuck to Ryusei’s skin. 

“What happened when he collapsed?” The giant asked the blonde, the woman Ryusei’d rescued.

“He, uh, just saved me and then--” The woman stammered.

“Collapsed lung!” Jun reported.

“What?!” Christopher squeaked. He was still breathing! “He’s still breath--”

“Hold this!” The giant shoved her bag into Christopher’s hands. She unzipped it before Christopher could speak. Before his mind could follow her actions she pulled out an empty syringe, almost comically tiny in her hands. She yanked out the plunger leaving a hollow barrel.

“Mark the ribs.” The woman commanded.

Jun put two fingers spread only centimeters apart. “Here.” Without hesitation the woman shoved the needle between the Kappa’s fingers. Air rushed out in a great torrent. Ryusei began to breath easier almost immediately.

“Anything else?” The giant asked.

The Kappa slid his hand over Ryusei’s torso, then touched Ryusei’s skull. The Kappa nodded. “No, I think that’s it.” Without another word, the kappa moved over to the female robber, the one missing a finger. The giant looked at Christopher.

“The woman? Kid?”

Christopher’s eyes were locked on the syringe as it rose and fell with Ryusei’s breath. The man had had a collapsed lung and Christopher hadn’t even noti--

“Kid!” The giant snapped. Christopher slammed back to reality. The Kappa was already bandaging the woman’s finger. 

“What’s wrong with the wom--”

“Her finger was cut off!”

“I can see that, but is that all?”

“Yeah, I--” Christopher looked at the blonde for confirmation. She nodded. “That’s all.”

“Do you know where her finger went?”

Christopher shook his head.

“Help me find it then.”

The giant rose with an astounding alacrity. Christopher followed. As he stood his eyes wandered towards Hitomi. She was still spraying the acid victim with water but the EMTs with her were spreading purple powder over the victim’s face. What were they doing?

“Today please!” The woman growled.

Christopher obeyed with a start. The blonde looked around, confused. Should she help find the finger too? The Giant hadn’t so much as looked at her during this exchange.

“Should I--” The blonde began before she was interrupted by a stern, familiar voice.

“Her?” Inspector Hirito asked. Christopher looked up. He was walking towards Christopher and the group of EMTs. He was flanked by a cringing young man dressed in a cheap suit and a pair of officers with riot helmets on, their visors lowered.

“Y-yeah.”

Hirito nodded gruffly and motioned his men forward.

One of the officers reached for his handcuffs. “Ma’am you’re under arr--”

“H-hold on!” The blonde protested. She stood. She raised her hands. The officers immediately reached for their pistols. They must’ve gotten a description of her quirk.

“Lower your hands.” Inspector Hirito ordered, his tone carved from granite.

 “I didn’t do anything wrong!” The woman screamed. The officers tensed. Metal scraped nylon. Muzzle left holster.

Christopher shoved himself between the officers and the blonde. The officers hesitated just a hair. They hesitated enough that they didn’t shoot. Christopher grabbed the blonde’s, admittedly petite hands, with one of his own and held his other towards the officers palm down, urging the officers to lower their weapons.

“Lower your guns, please. She’s no danger.” Christopher managed evenly.

Christopher’s heart pounded at the sight of drawn guns being point at his chest, but his body didn’t let him freeze. He was terrified. He wanted nothing more than to just stand to the side and let the scene play out, but something wouldn’t let him. He felt Hitomi look up.

Hirito’s brow furrowed. “Mirror Dev--”

“Don’t resist.” Christopher addressed the blonde. She looked at him in horror. “Just keep your hands down and no-one gets hurt alright?” He was shocked his voice wasn’t quavering.

“But—”

“You’ll get to tell your story, I promise.” Mirror Devil assured her, as if he could guarantee that right.

The blonde lowered her hands. Christopher stepped out of the way. The officers approached, one kept his pistol drawn, but it stayed pointed towards the ground. The other put her in handcuffs. She looked at Mirror Devil one last time. Like she was looking for some assurance that she wasn’t about to go to jail.

“Get a lawyer.” Christopher advised. She nodded. He felt sick.

Hirito stared at Mirror Devil coolly as his officers led the woman away. Christopher didn’t know what to feel under that gaze. He certainly didn’t feel guilty… just stupid. He could’ve easily gotten the woman and him both shot for the sudden movement.

“Next time.” Hirito began. Christopher’s stomach fell, he couldn’t identify the man’s tone. “Restrain her, rather than stepping in a firing line alright? No-one needs a dead kid on their conscience.”

Christopher thought for a moment. “...oh.” That was absurdly obvious.

Hirito shook his head tiredly, a ghost of a smile played at his lips. He turned his attention to the young man in the cheap suit. “If you’ll follow me sir, we’ll get you checked out.” The cringing young man in a cheap suit followed Hirito out, he looked Christopher like one would a mad man.

‘Maybe I am.’ Christopher realized, but there was something freeing about being mad.

“Sir!” Christopher called after Hirito. “She’s the one I called about whe—”

“Yes, I know Mirror Devil.” Hirito interrupted. “Don’t worry about her. She’ll get a fair shake.”

Hirito walked away, the young man close behind.

“...thanks.” Christopher whispered. It was a weird thing, thanking a person for doing his job, but Christopher did it regardless.

***Ahem*** The Giant cleared her throat.

Without further prompting, Christopher returned to looking for a finger.

***

Ryusei’s eyes fluttered open. Sitting on his chest was Cain’s black dragon. She stared into his eyes. Ryusei stared back.

“… hey?”

The dragon cooed in response and leapt off of Ryusei’s chest. 

Ryusei sat up and looked around. He was in a Hospital room again. The, by now, familiar wires and machinery festooned his cramped room. In the corner was Cain slumped in one of those shitty Hospital chairs. Hitomi leapt on Cain’s lap and curled up.

“Cain?”

Christopher stirred at the sound of his voice. Hitomi glared at Ryusei reproachfully. He ignored her for the moment, he had to make sure Cain had taken care of Anko.

“Ryusei?” Christopher answered blearily, wiping sleep out of his eyes. Ryusei flinched. He still wasn’t used to Cain calling him by his first name unprompted, but supposedly that wasn’t a big deal in the States.

“Did you feed Anko?”

Christopher yawned. “Fed and walked. He was a pain in the ass about me leaving.”

Ryusei relaxed. “Good.” He shook his head. He felt he’d had a weird dream. Something about a shadow? A woman maybe?

***

Hitomi watched him out of the corner of her eye. 

***

Ryusei dismissed the thought, it was probably nothing.

***

Hitomi huffed and curled into a tighter ball.

***

“So, what’s wrong with me?” Ryusei asked. 

Christopher stroked Hitomi on his lap, it was weird how attached he’d gotten to her. “You had a collapsed lung.”

“No shit?”

“Apparently, you were still breathing so I didn’t even think about that…. You’re lucky the paramedics were there.”

“Yeah, so were the bad guys I think.”

Christopher shrugged at that.

“What about the girl? The blonde?”

“… under arrest.”

“Try to sound a little less happy about it.” Ryusei joked.

“...”

“You feeling guilty?”

“Aren’t you?”

“Maybe a little,” Ryusei admitted, “if someone better had been there, maybe they’d have been able to move in faster. Maybe she wouldn’t’ve been put in that situation, but they weren’t there. I was.”

Christopher shook his head. “You weren’t the only one there. Hitomi was right there, I could’ve intervened before she--”

“Maybe, and if Hitomi goes in does ‘mr. collapsed my lung,’ shoot the poor woman instead of getting a face full of acid from her?”

“… I don’t know.”

“No-one does. You did what you could in the moment and it wasn’t half fucking bad either.”

“I hesitated I--”

Ryusei laughed. “Kid, just ask yourself this, did anyone die?”

“Huh?”

“Did anybody die?”

“… no.”

“Out of what? Two dozen hostages? You and I went in and took down 5 armed assailants and no-one’s in the morgue? The worst we can say about today is a woman panicked and scarred her assailant?”

“I’ve had worse days.”

Christopher averted his eyes. He didn’t quite believe Ryusei, there were a dozen different actions he felt like he could’ve taken with the benefit of hindsight, but… Ryusei was right. Christopher could see the results of his actions 3 or 4 down the line, but it was hazy after that. He wasn’t as smart as Hoge. He couldn’t tell if any of his actions would’ve spared the blonde her current predicament AND not resulted in any deaths. Maybe what he’d done really was the best he could’ve? He didn’t know, but he’d like to think so.

“… thanks.”

***

“Don’t thank me, I ain’t lying.” Ryusei shifted uncomfortably. His fingers were itching, he needed some nicotine and stat! “By the way, did you bring me any smokes?”

“This is a Hospital.”

“So?”

Christopher sighed. “There weren’t any left at the dojo and I’m still 15.”

“Dammit.”

Cain frowned as if he’d forgotten something and wasn’t quite sure what he just remembered was the thing he’d forgotten. “Oh. The press was at the bank.”

“Thank God I was unconscious.” Ryusei smiled. “How’d that pack of hyenas treat you?”

“Okay? They didn’t ask me anything weird.”

“Really? That’s good.”

Cain shrugged. “Rosethorn’s mock interviews were tougher than the real thing honestly.”

Ryusei nodded. “Probably would be, she’s probably trying to make sure you’re ready for when the Journalists make you a target.”

“Like what happened with Popsy?”

Ryusei raised an eyebrow.

***

“Inigo told me about it,” Christopher admitted. His interest in the Japanese hero scene was a bit after Popsy’s downfall, even he didn’t know the details in full.

“Popsy’s… a good example of what I’m talking about. The press are jackals Cain. If you want to make some real money doing this hero shit you have to deal with them, but never get it twisted, you’re a product. If reporting your triumphs makes them money? Great! If your fall would make them more though…”

“They won’t hesitate. Rosethorn said the same thing.”

***

“I’m sure she did.” It was around the time the press turned on Akagi that Aiko passed her up in the rankings. … Aiko never felt right about that.

Hitomi suddenly, without prompting, wrapped around Cain’s neck and shifted into a necklace. Christopher ignored her, like he usually did. She did weird shit sometimes.

“Anyway! Congrats on your first interview and your first legal hero work! I’d offer you a drink to celebrate but--”

Christopher smiled bashfully. “Still 15. But thank you.”

“Don’t mention it kid.”

“I’m sorry to interrupt.” Cain leapt out of his chair. Ryusei looked lazily over at the door to see Aiko standing there. The woman better known as Rosethorn.

Aiko smiled tightly at Cain’s reaction. “I’m glad you’re just visiting for once Cain-kun.” 

***

“Yes ma’am.” Christopher averted his eyes, embarrassed. Hitomi gave a small huff in her necklace form as if to say ‘you’re lucky I was paying attention.’

Rosethorn looked at Ryusei. “How’re you Ryusei?”

“Fine. Guess the Doctor got to me already?”

“He did, though he wants you to stay over night for observation.”

“Shit.” Christopher mumbled. He knew he’d forgotten something!

“I’ll visit properly later, but I need to borrow Cain-kun for a moment.”

“Anything serious?”

“Not for him.” Rosethorn reported gravely. Christopher’s brow furrowed at her tone, he couldn’t place that tone. It was… guilty?

Ryusei waved a hand. “Knock yourself out. I ain’t going anywhere apparently.”

“Come with me Cain-kun.” Rosethorn motioned for him to follow behind and left the room. Christopher spared one last look at Ryusei, who was already trying to find the remote for the TV suspended from the ceiling, and followed his teacher silently. 

The halls were desolate. What few nurses were still on duty were out of sight. Christopher felt awkward. He still didn’t know how to talk to Rosethorn after she didn’t invite him for an internship. It didn’t hurt as much as it used to, but it still made him question her perception of him. If she didn’t trust him to be her intern why had she pro--

“I saw your interview.” Rosethorn broke the silence.

“You did?” Christopher flushed. People he knew were going to see him on TV?! Oh God, he thought the incident minor enough that he wouldn’t make the nightly news! Shit, how badly had he flubbed the interview?!

“You were superb.” Rosethorn said simply.

Christopher stopped for a moment. She didn’t really mean that did she? He saw her reflection in a glass pane she walked past. She was smiling. It was a genuine smile. She meant it. Christopher beamed.

***

Rosethorn brought Christopher to small cramped ward with five patients. They were the bank robbers from this morning. They were sedated. In between the beds was a short fat man with a waxed mustache and dark sunglasses. He twirled his mustache impatiently.

“I’ve brought him.” Rosethorn reported. Her face was kept carefully neutral, but she kept herself between the man and Christopher. 

“Hrm? Ah! You’re the Cain boy yes? Oh I’m sorry! Mirror Devil!”

“Yes.” Christopher answered. “Wh—”

“I saw your interview earlier my boy, splendidly done! Your mother would’ve been proud!” A chill ran up Christopher’s spine at those words. Rosethorn took an involuntary step forward. “Doctor…” she warned.

“Ah! Yes, yes, quite, I apologize, I get excitable in my old age you see! I’m very sorry young man, truly!”

“… it’s alright, you knew my mom?”

“Hrm, quite well, quite well.” The man mumbled as if he’d abruptly lost interest in this conversation. “Now…” he looked at Rosethorn. “Why’d you bring him again?”

“You asked me too.” Rosethorn replied carefully.

“I did?” The man blinked. “Why?” He hummed to himself as he tried to piece together the series of events that led to this horrible predicament of having someone he didn’t know he needed in his room! It was quite vexing!

Rosethorn sighed. Christopher looked back at his teacher, his eyes screamed ‘why have you brought me to see this crazy person?’ Rosethorn hesitated a moment before answering.

“He’s with the Hero Association. Specifically the Quirk Records Service. His name is--”

“Records you say? AH that’s it!” The man snapped his fingers. “Cain my boy!” He danced around Rosethorn before she could react and wrapped his arm around Christopher’s shoulders. Rosethorn tensed but did nothing. Christopher was too flabbergasted at how quickly the man just moved to resist. The man, completely oblivious to the abject horror those around him felt, guided Christopher over to a hospital bed. The one that bore the leader of the bankrobbery.

“I’m told by your teacher that you have quite the rare gift! A mimicry quirk! Such a marvel… well formerly remarkable. It’s rather distressing how many of those we’ve seen recently! Almost makes me think my colleague-- wait, no, where was I? AH YES! Young man could you copy this gentleman’s quirk for me?”

Christopher, swept along by the man’s rambling enthusiasm, could only muster a faint, “Huh?”

“This one.” The fat man pointed at the leader. “Please copy his quirk.”

Christopher looked at the man. He was fortunate he didn’t have another quirk loaded right now. He mentally held up a mirror and he felt the man’s quirk take hold.

White text appeared above the man’s head. Christopher blinked.

!!!info
	Quirk: Search Eye
	The user can see a person’s essential information. Including quirk descriptions

“What?” Christopher whispered dumbfounded. Was this how the robber had known about the blonde’s acid quirk?

“Quite a wonderful quirk isn’t it!” The fat man thrummed with energy. “You can have that one free of charge for however long you wish!” Christopher briefly wondered how the man intended to charge him before the man dragged him towards another bed. 

The bed was occupied by a small woman. Her finger was whole again, but bandaged. Christopher blinked as he read the text.

!!!info
	Quirk: 0
	User can set any single value to 0.

“What the FUCK?” Christopher breathed. She’d had THIS quirk?! How the Hell was Ryusei alive?

“Is the quirk’s name 0?” The fat man asked.

Christopher could only nod.

“Hrm. Please don’t copy that one.” The man was suddenly solemn. “It’s an exceptionally dangerous quirk.”

“I can imagine.” Christopher whispered in awe. There didn’t seem to be any definition or limit to what she could set to 0… had she ever tried to set an atom’s mass to--

“Well my boy that’s all I really needed you for! Do feel free to call me any time! I’d love to reminisce about your mother’s proclivities when she was your age!” He guided Christopher back towards Rosethorn. His hand cradled the back of Christopher’s neck.

“I—”

“You see, this criminal you so graciously identified, somehow managed to change her own DNA! She even acid dipped her finger tips, the poor fool.”

“Why would she--”

“We had no way of confirming precisely who she was! Until I thought to call Rosethorn-san here! Why it’s a miracle I recalled your quirk, the old thinker isn’t what it used to be! But now! It’s all settled, we can take her back home and everything can return the way it was.” The man concluded satisfied with himself.

Christopher’s skin crawled at the man’s words. What had he just condemned this woman to? It couldn’t fit the crime of robbing a bank. He looked at Rosethorn. She must’ve seen him ask for a rescue with his eyes. She didn’t hesitate. She grabbed Christopher’s shoulder and tore him away from the man.

“If there’s nothing else Saraki-sensei.”

Christopher’s heart dropped at that name.

Saraki smiled pleasantly. “Not at all! Again young man, call me any time! I’ll see that my number gets to you!”

Rosethorn rushed Christopher out. Christopher was lost in a memory. The memory of when he’d woken up from his second encounter with Desolator, of when he first spoke to Smokin’ Sexy.

>“The drugs are making you foggy kid. You were alert when they brought you in. They said you were asking for a ‘Saraki…’”
