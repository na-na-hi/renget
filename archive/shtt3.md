##The Reward

The last rays of the afternoon sun bathed the classroom in a honey-shade warm light. 
Silence hung over this part of the Defense against the Dark Arts tower, as the last period ended an hour ago.
Yet this classroom wasn't empty. 

Away from the other students, who were now heading to their common rooms and the library,
two paramours had found, perhaps, the right time and place to *enjoy* eachother's company.
"Now we have some peace and quiet, shall we?" Miranda asked.
Sat beside her on the wooden bench by the wall-side of the classroom, her partner nodded --
barely able to respond with words as shy kisses found eager lips. His hands instinctively felt through and under her robe,
caressing her back as they drew closer. In turn Miranda's left hand found its way up to stroke his hair.

His warmth and their closeness made it seem as though the world around her stood still.
She savoured this moment and felt relief... away from exhilarating but exhausting studies, away from goblins and dark wizards.
They parted with a low moan. Inflamed by the moment, Miranda lifted her right hand to rub his cheek and softly muttered into his ear.

"You held yourself so well when we were up against those poachers the other day... 
and I heard Professor Weasley was impressed with the written assignment you turned in."
"I think that deserves a *reward*", she cooed. "Just a moment. And please...", Miranda sat up straight again after they withdrew,
then stood up and gestured for him to do the same before drawing her wand.

"Solatium Sedis."

A flick of her wand pointed to the floor at the bench made a quartet of soft velvet pillows appear on the spot.
«Brilliant, this should make things comfortable.» she thought and took one of the pillows aside before settling down on it.
When she did, Miranda noticed her lover's growing excitement as it was striking her eye level.
"Why don't you come down here, hm?" she says invitingly, eyes looking up at him and patting the remaining pillows.

After he settled down onto the pillows, well-cushioned against the hard bench, he leaned in to kiss her.
This time deeper than those before and flushing red to their cheeks in passion. It gave brief pause to Miranda,
before she slid her robe off and shifted closer to him, the positions now reversed as he now looked up to her.

With a surge of confidence she felt up the bulge contained by breeches, running fingers along their now jolting fabric mound.
Her rubbing continued for a moment while she didn't break eye contact with him. 
Miranda felt a pleasant heat travelling through her chest and deeper down through her abdomen, 
making her lift her sweater above her chest in a hurried fashion with a huff, before her hands began tending, once more, to his need.

Deciding it was cruel to keep it contained any longer, she unraveled the cloth restraining his hardening member.
It flicked out into her hand as though conjured with the Summoning Charm, its veiny length and girth resting on her palm.
He gave off a pleased gasp and noticed her attention had broken off from him to concentrate on his erection, gently stroking the tip.
Desire overtook him and he sought to place a kiss on her neck. "Ah-ah!", Miranda denied and whispered, chiding him playfully,
"This is for *you*, not me.", her grip tightened a little around the shaft and her strokes went further, revealing the glans completely from its sheath.

Up and down, up and down in a slow steady rythm.

Clear pre-cum streamed out from his tip and covered her fingers, going on to provide a slick wetness to the rest of his throbbing member.
"...but I know how I can keep you from getting distracted.", she murmured. 
Her free hand loosened the Ravenclaw-striped tie and undid some of the buttons of her shirt, working to expose her bosom to him.

"I believe you'll like this."

Her lover let out another moan, both at the sight of her exposed chest and at the increasing intensity she jerked him with.
Any more positively indecent sounds coming from him were quenched by her free hand now resting at the back of his head again,
stroking his hair -- and pulling him closer to her chest, urging him to latch onto one of her now hard, pink nipples.
He obliged, taking his prior "defeat" with stride. Miranda couldn't help but gasp excitedly the moment he did, before finding the focus to say,

"Good. There, there."

As the sloppy sounds of her handiwork joined with his sucking on her breast, she realized that the heat running through her body 
formed a dampness in her depths. The lust and arousal hanging thick in the air somehow fueled Miranda's desire to remain in control,
rather than give in. That, and her lover's occasional ecstatic whimpers, definitely helped.

She felt a pulse go through his shaft, throbbing even harder. «He must be close.», Miranda thought and applied a tighter, 
but still pleasant pressure to his erection, swiftly jerking down to the base. "It's alright. You can let go.", she whispered to him.
Suddenly he groaned and his whole body stiffened, his mouth desperately and firmly sucking on her breast.

Jets of warm sticky cum shot out, the first reaching so far as to cover Miranda's glasses, provoking another gasp from her. 
The second found her chest after he withdrew; his head tilted and eyes rolled back. And the last few came dribbling down to coat her fingers.

"*Good boy.*", the words slipped past her lips and she kissed him on the cheek.

After the glow of the moment subsided, Miranda took her wand in her left hand and circled it around over her head incanting "Evanesco.",
vanishing the evidence. She sat back up with a smile, straightening her displaced uniform and fixing stray hairs.
"If you keep it up, maybe I'll let you return the favor next time."
