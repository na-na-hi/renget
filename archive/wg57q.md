Auntie’s little secret. Ch. 3.

~*~

“Today I had my second session with my new therapist. I’m cutting him off before next week.”

“It is not because I found him to be an incapable professional, it’s just that I can already tell this is going nowhere, just like it did with the others. Sadly, this is entirely my fault.”

“As much as I beg of myself to be upfront and cooperative, I still gave him a mixed bag of lies and truths. The truths remain the same with all the people I’ve gone to, the lies vary.”

“The truths I told him were these: The house I grew up in wasn’t precisely a happy place. I was exposed to pornography early. I spent a good amount of my childhood masturbating by rubbing my crotch. Once I knew how to do it properly, I did it a minimum of two or three times a day.”

“The lies I told him were these: When I was in the bathroom with my auntie, my towel fell and she looked away as I put it back on. I told him I got molested at my school by an older, fat girl who gave me a blowjob….”

What’s the point of writing down lies? Might as well just go to sleep and take them to your pillow, you’ll forget them as soon as your eyes doze off to sleep.

You closed the notebook and turned off the lamp. Without getting up from your chair, you let the darkness of the room seep into you. Your chest feels constrained, as if being bound by threads as fine and sharp as pieces of glass.

You’re missing something.

Those shapes you could see in your dreams are materializing themselves in the dark. It's just your imagination, but it's lively enough for you to believe you're there.

The shapes are becoming clearer. Now you can see bubbles. Bubbles...?

All of those memories are encapsulated in bubbles, they play as the reflections on the little soapy friend. 

This one has the image of a rooster. But why?

Your old house. You were still so little, so much so you couldn't reach the upper drawer from your furniture. So little, that you had no memories of auntie Fubuki, other than seeing her casually walking inside your house while you played with your LEGO.

Your old house, the one you lived in before you knew the names of most things, the one in which you took your first steps. The place doesn't precisely welcome you back. It's as if you've showed up unannounced and it can barely muster the energy to greet you. Things are just as they were, with it's reeking stink of ash and smoke, a dirty, full ashtray in the middle of a table, peeled wallpapers, and behind the couch, a crushed can of orange soda you had hidden for some reason. Why are you back here? Why, of all places, are you back here again? Focus, focus. Search for the meaning of it...

*Kokekokko.*

Mom had kicked dad out, again. She told you every time that he would never come back because he hated you two. At first you missed him, and then learned he'd pop up again a few days after. During these days, you ate whatever the delivery man brought, and made sure to make it last a few days with your mom. Chinese was the best. You didn't feel sick after eating so much of it.

Mom had invited a man you didn't know and you didn't see them after they went to her room. You were hungry. You banged on your mom's door to ask her to get you the cornflakes from the upper pantry, but she didn't respond.

You had locked yourself in your room blowing bubbles, seeing their pristine shine and fleeting beauty before they popped. Sometimes you ate them to calm your rumbling tummy, but stopped doing it when you got the taste of soap on your mouth and couldn't rinse it off.

You waited and waited. You were a patient boy, at least. 

Finally you heard mom's door open, but you stayed in your room. After a while, she opened your door and told you to get in the bath. 

You were going to see your uncle Kenji for Christmas.

Christmas... Oh, that's right! 

Roosters go kokekokko.

~*~

She popped the box open and went to the bathroom. The instructions said to wait for a couple of minutes.

One stripe.

"Dammit..." She sulked.  "Maybe it takes longer than expected? Yeah, that must be it." 

She left the little plastic device on her bed and walked around the house to pass the time. She walked for three hours in just five minutes.

Still one stripe.

"Maybe this one's faulty..." She told herself, keeping her tears inside.

Pop open the box. Bathroom. Wait a few minutes.

One stripe.

Fubuki physically felt herself crumble while holding the little plastic stick in her hand. She calmly sat down on her bed and clenched her fist. She took a deep breath, then another, and yet another. There was no way to hold back the tears.

"Dammit!" She threw the box at the window and cried. Kenji heard his wife's distress, and quickly ran over to comfort her.

"Fubuki?" He banged on the door. "Fubuki! Are you okay?"

Fubuki was a crying mess, unable to respond. All of her words turned into sniffles, all of her thoughts were being eradicated by that single line. Kenji let himself into the room and quickly hugged his wife.

"Come on, Fubu-chan, don't cry, please..."

"Kenji... Kenji..." Her arms clutched onto her husband's shirt.

He already knew. He knew the results before she took the pregnancy tests. But how could he shoot down her enthusiasm? He was the one who brought it up in the first place, now Fubuki had been blissfully deluding herself into thinking that a tummy ache she felt meant that she had finally gotten pregnant.

There he held his wife, unable to say anything. What he managed to say, only made the situation worse.

"Maybe we need to try harder... Let's just... I'll do those womb massages again, I-I'll buy those medicines from those chinese girls-"

But Fubuki didn't respond. Not that her silence was an acknowledgement. It was rather as if she had turned deaf for a brief moment. She didn't want to hear him. Not him, not anyone, not anything. There were no words in any language capable of comforting her. Shirakami Fubuki, alone in the middle of the universe.

After all of her feelings had spilled out of her eyes, Fubuki spoke solemnly.

"I think it's about time we give it up, honey."

Fubuki told herself it was for the best. She can't have a kid, and that had two meanings. One, she physically couldn't, two, she shouldn't.

Lady luck had planned out something different however. She would receive her gift on Christmas eve in a way that she wouldn't have thought possible; through her husband's sister.

~*~

A couple of days after that, Fubuki and Kenji were getting ready in the bathroom. She dried her body while he brushed his teeth.

"Kenji." 

"Hmm?"

"Are you sure?"

"Oh for the love of... Yes. Please, I know you and Hana don't get along that well, but she's going through a tough time."

"If she begins making a clown of herself..."

"I won't let her drink that much."

"Why is it that we have to keep her on a leash every time?"

"Come on, Shirakami, don't be so cynical. She's bringing the little rascal too. I'm sure she'll behave if her kid's present."

"Ugh..."

"Hey, whatever you think about her, she's still my sister."

When she heard her ring the bell, Fubuki felt stressed. Her eyes closed involuntarily, and she mentally prepared herself to deal with the hassle that was her Sister-in-law and her son.

She had only seen Anon once or twice, and always, that kid wouldn't stop looking at her with those strange, porcelain eyes. Now, his gaze was stuck to her again. Please, just go somewhere else... The entire compromise she made was that she'd avoid him, and he was to avoid her.

"W-Why..." He spoke softly.

"Hmm?"

He said nothing.

"You need something?"

"Why..."

"Why what?"

"Why are your eyes... blue-green?"

"Eh? Well, it's common.... for foxes of... my kind?"

"Fox...?"

"Mhm, fox."

"Huh."

Fubuki cooked in silence while Hana and Kenji spoke in the living room. Anon still wouldn't separate from her.

"Fox..." He repeated.

"Mhm."

"And..."

"Yes?"

"Why is your tail so fluffy?"

"M-My tail..?" Fubuki blushed.

With that, question after question, Fubuki was entertained by her nephew's curiosity. The boy was learning a lot of new words with her. Perhaps her preempted disgust was unwarranted. He doesn't look like he took anything after Hana other than her physical features.

Eventually, he asked something that would forever change the course of her life. That day, Fubuki's shell would crack, and someone she kept hidden would slowly begin to come out.

"What's a keromomimi?" Asked the boy.

"Ke-mo-no-mi-mi." She emphasized the 'mo' and the 'no'.

He seemed dumbfounded.

"Here, I'll write it out for you."

Grabbing a pencil and some paper, Fubuki wrote the word kemonomimi character after character.

"Ke-mo-no." She said. "Not 'Ke-ro-mo."

He stared at the paper blankly, unable to comprehend the shapes laid in front of him.

"Come on, you know these characters, right?"

"Umm..." The boy clutched his pants with his fingers.

"Oh, Anon... do you..."

Something changed inside of Fubuki. Before, she had told herself she couldn't be trusted around a kid, and now, he seemed so lonely, so infinitely fragile that she knew she'd never forgive herself if she didn't hold his hand. 

"Do you not know how to read?" She asked.

Her nephew looked down at the floor, and shook his head.

At his age! How could he not know how to read? Hana and Yuuto must be doing a horrible job. That also explains why Yuuto isn't here today. She wanted to stay away from her husband's family drama, but now she felt for the kid that had to directly live it.

"Okay, see here. This one is 'ke'."

"'Ke'" He repeated.

"Mhm." Fubuki spoke. "And these are ka, ki, ku, keee." She stressed the repeated character more than the others. "And the last one is ko."

"K-Ka, ki, ku..."

Time went flying showing her nephew the first few lines of hiragana, she even drew a rooster that went 'kokekokko' with a speech bubble so he'd learn faster.

"F-Fubu-chan! Need help around the kitchen?" Hana struck her out of her senses.

"Eh?" 

"I-I mean..." 

Oh, that's right, dinner. Fubuki had become so engrossed in teaching her nephew that she had forgotten she was cooking. In fact, she had forgotten about the presence, the mere existence of Hana in her house.

"O-Oh!" She panicked.

Her nephew's eyes jumped to his mom. He lifted up the paper and showed Hana the first few attempts he had made to write the characters 'ke' and 'ko'. Hana didn't pay attention to him.

"I-I'll get to it! Could you make the salads, Hana-chan?" Fubuki spoke.

"Sure."

A frantic afternoon of cooking ensued. To Fubuki's surprise, Hana didn't mess up as much as she expected her to. She was the kind of woman that could burn a salad.

Seeing both his mom and the white haired woman run around, Anon wanted to help. He tugged on Fubuki's dress to catch her attention. So, Fubuki asked him to bring the plates to the table.

He did so dutifully, one after the other, salads, bottles of juice, plates of chicken, and so on. As he carried a plate of potato salad, he accidentally tripped with his own foot. The salad went flying through the air, after he had spilled its contents over himself and onto the floor. The loud cracking of the plate came to Fubuki's ear, and her first thought was "Anon!"

Hana and Fubuki ran over to where they heard the sound. There he was on the floor, on his knees, breathing quickly and heavily. He grabbed handfuls of the potato salad and tried to put back on top of the broken pieces of plate, when he noticed his mother's presence, he visibly shook. Hana fumed, her eye twitching.

"You..." She walked over to Anon and raised her hand. Anon covered his face.

Fubuki saw Hana lift her hand in slow motion, as if lighting was about to shoot down a delicate flower, a flower that was unable to move, bound by its roots to the ground below, merely accepting its destiny, merely accepting that someone wanted it to die. No, no, no!

"Stop!" She got a hold of Hana's wrist before it came down and struck her nephew. Hana turned to Fubuki with a glare. She was to discipline her kid, why does she have to interfere? It's her son, not hers.

"It's okay." Fubuki said. "Let's just clean up."

After Hana's anger had calmed down, she went to get a broom and apologized to Fubuki, while the white haired fox stared at the boy on the floor.

"Anon, are you hurt?" She asked him in a compassionate tone.

He wasn't crying, he was oddly quiet. A piece of broken plate had scrapped his leg, and little drops of blood came out.

~*~

In the bathroom, Fubuki tried to get to Anon's cut. A superficial injury, but still one. He refused her over and over again.

"Come on, Anon, I just want to see."

Yet he kept hiding away the cut, Fubuki sighed, and quickly thought of something to distract him.

"Anon! What sound do roosters make?"

"K-Kokeko..."

"Bawk bawk bawk!" Said Fubuki.

Anon giggled.

"Bawk!" He repeated.

Anon kept making chicken sounds. Now Fubuki could lift up his pants to his knee and see the injury, dried out, but dirty. Fubuki grabbed a bottle of rubbing alcohol and clean gauze.

"This might hurt, honey." The nickname slipped out of her mouth. Anon whimpered when he felt the burning sensation of the alcohol, but still kept quiet as possible.

"There, we're done." She said, and then put a bandage on top of it. Anon stared dumbfounded at his aunt. Fubuki smiled at his starstruck stare, and without thinking, she gave him a kiss on the forehead. 

Anon didn't understand. He was feeling strange emotions, previously unknown to him.

He was crying. Two lonely tears, each sprouting from each of his eyes became present. Dry sniffles escaped from his nose, drawing in shallow, short breaths. Fubuki's vision blurred once she understood. What's happening, why can't she see what's in front of her?

Oh, it's just a couple of tears, hindering her eyesight.

Anon's eyes had a strange, lively color in them. He dug himself into his aunt's chest, and wet it with his tears.

Fubuki held him there, unable to process what just happened. Her heart's beating like she's running a marathon. She has a little boy in her arms, how, when, why? Why does she feel like she's about to cry?

"No..." She thought, holding back tears. "I, I can't, I shouldn't..."

But those thoughts went away, and thus she was split between two people. She had become auntie Fubuki.

She was Fubuki while she was by herself, and she was auntie Fubuki when she was with him. Sometimes Fubuki came out while auntie was with him, and sometimes auntie thought dearly of her nephew while Fubuki was alone with her fantasies. 

For years, she pampered him with the love for the child she never had, and Anon sought shelter from everything in his auntie. 

What he didn't know, what the other face that his auntie had.

~*~

Your auntie was the most beautiful woman in the entire world. She didn't do anything wrong. You kept telling yourself that. Everything that happened was because you initiated it.

*You wanted it.*

~*~

“Fuck, I just got back…!” 

Hana sat in bed and sulked. Another business trip. Pinching between her eyes, she took deep breaths and began organizing her thoughts one by one. Her sleep schedule, her husband lazing around in the couch, her son, the trip. 

The money’s worth it, she kept telling herself. Just a little more and I’ll be up for the promotion I need, she used as a mantra. She just has to endure it for a bit more. A bit, just a bit. Just a little more of being a full time office monkey. She’ll pay off the house, the car, everything.

She brought out her phone and sighed, calling one the people she despised the most.

Shirakami.

On her end, Fubuki was just coming out of the shower and giving herself a good look on the mirror. She felt sexy, her nicer curves seemed more pronounced than before, her ass looked firmer, making it jump up and down with her hands delighted her. She put on a robe to cover her luscious body, and slowly opened it in the middle to let her nipple barely poke out, teasing her own reflection, she brought one her hands down her stomach and down her womanhood, just as her phone rang from the other room.

She sighed. Who and why is bothering her during her moment of self-love? She takes a few guesses; A-chan, her manager, or most likely, Hana.

Her third guess was correct.

“Evening!”

“Hey Shirakami, I need to ask you for a favor again..." She stopped talking. "Sorry, sorry, I mean, hey, how are you?”

“You can drop the formalism, Hana. Just tell me what you need.” She blurred out.

“Oh thank god. I need someone to take care of Anon for a couple of days.”

A sly smile drew on Fubuki’s face. Bingo, just what she needed.

“Will you drop him off, or should I go pick him up?”

~*~

Such a chance! It's like the universe itself wanted her to fuck her nephew. She had the entire day planned out. She'd bring him to the mall, she'd eat something with him, she'd bring him home and '"teach him the ropes" in her room. No running, no hiding. No masks, no judgement.

*No running, no hiding.*

And that wasn't the best part. Hana's going to be away for days. She'd spend them wisely. No one knows what might happen tomorrow, so she's going to cherish these few days and enjoy them to the fullest.

Except, she didn't get to. 

Fubuki's plans saw an abrupt shift after picking up Anon and seeing a text from her husband.

"I'll be home early today. I took up a vacation I had saved up." He said.

"I would've lost it." He continued.

"Ok." Replied Fubuki. 

Damn it. So close, yet so far.

She could still take Anon out, but knowing her husband would be home later and ruin her plans crushed her spirits. She moped around the house while you followed her with worry.

"Auntie, what's wrong?"

She wouldn't respond. Her nephew understood once he heard a car park outside.

Now she'll have both her men in the house. Hopefully, Kenji won't notice something off about her nephew, and Anon won't try anything funny while her husband watches.

Her heart pounded like a hammer, praying in silence that nothing would go wrong, but some things did.

Kenji came back barely past twelve. Anon was in the living room watching cartoons. Fubuki greeted her husband, while Anon glared at him with confusion.

"Evening, honey!" He said, taking Fubuki into his arms and kissing her repeatedly. 

"Babe, h-hold on. Anon's watching."

"Bah, you don't think your prince is gonna get jealous, right?" He laughed. Fubuki forced out a few giggles.

"That is precisely why!" Fubuki thought, panicking inside. She sneaked glances at you while her husband's arm was wrapped around her waist. She prayed that you wouldn't spill the beans by saying something no one should hear.

To Anon's dismay, Fubuki's husband was feeling extra touchy today, happy to have a couple of days away from his job, to be around his wife, to spend time at home, and maybe even play a couple of video games with his nephew. He didn't know however, that you were feeling resentful of his presence. 

~*~

Kenji spent most of his day watching a show on TV. Fubuki never complained when her husband chose to laze around, she knows he works hard, and after all, her job at Cover provides for both. This would've been an uneventful day had Anon not been present, keenly eyeing Fubuki, peeking at her and Kenji from a distance.

His eyes were fixed on his aunt, as if his gaze was stuck to her with glue. He wanted to ask her for something, but he couldn't find the words, much less, the opportunity. He knew no one could watch, he knew her husband meant problems, how exactly he knew was a mystery, but when he did those dirty things with his aunt, it was best kept a secret. Even in the car, were no one could have heard you, you still spoke in murmurs, and that told him everything he needed to know.

An old war movie played in the living room's television, Kenji was sipping a beer while his body sunk into the couch and his eyelids repeatedly closed. Fubuki chopped up carrots and you sat on a chair watching her. The alcohol, tiredness, and a boring section of dialogues in the movie put Kenji under a spell. Soon enough, he feel asleep, his brain shutting off mid film so he could rest. He snored loudly, and now Fubuki's nephew saw his chance.

He wanted to reclaim Fubuki, so to speak.

"Auntie." He spoke.

"Yes dear?" She spoke with some difficulty.

"Can you lift your skirt?"

Fubuki was shook. At first she pretended she didn't hear those words, but she couldn't hide the fact her body was acting up almost immediately. She gazed her at husband sleeping on the couch and pondered her options. The thrill of the situation is taking over her, adrenaline is running through her body, the high is reaching obscene levels, but there's no telling where this will go. Then again, she wanted to make it up to him for everything he had to see today, and well, he had been very well behaved in Kenji's presence, so what's wrong with a little reward? Just a bit is okay, just a bit, she told herself.

"Ok, but just for a little while, alright dear?~"

Putting down the veggies and the knife, Fubuki pinched the sides of her skirt. She turned her face to look at him with her mischievous eyes, and slowly began revealing her legs, while he stared awestruck. She remembered that she was the first woman to expose herself to him. His eyes belong to her. His lust begins and ends with her...

Kenji shifted on the couch and let out loud grunts while he did so, which caused Fubuki to panic and drop the skirt back down. After she heard him snore again, she gasped in relief. Turning back to her nephew, she saw he was still waiting to see her butt. She swallowed and grabbed the skirt once more.

Anon took loud deep breaths, waiting for his prize. Fubuki swayed her hips from side to side to entice him, to keep him entertained just as she revealed more of her legs right before her panties showed.

"That's all, right Anon?~" She spoke with a muttered voice.

Anon gulped. 

"A-A bit more?" He spoke.

"Hmm?"

"Please?"

"Hmhm!"

Fubuki slowly brought the cloth over her butt, and let it rest atop of it. Her sky blue panties were right before his eyes. Why does a woman of her age feel so indecent at something so simple? Oh, taboo is one hell of an aphrodisiac. Her underwear covered her plumpy ass. Her meaty behind always seemed too big for anything she wore, her figure accentuated by her clothes, and now, it seemed as if her buttcheeks were constrained by her garment.

"Ohhh...."  He gasped.

"You like what you see, Anon?~"

"Y-Y-Yeah"

Fubuki licked her lips and gazed at her husband once more. No, it's too risky. She's not going to be able to contain herself. 

But then again, this is the only chance she's getting today. She juggled her options. It's not the time or the place, but she wants a little rush for herself as well.

"Touch it."

"Huh?"

"Go ahead, touch it!"

"Y-Yes..."

With slow steps, Anon walked towards his aunt's behind and stretched out his hands. The butt he had seen in secret so many times before, now laid almost bare before his eyes. He got a shy, gentle hold of it which made Fubuki's legs tingle. The shape is so nicely round.

His hands squished her buttcheeks with gusto, juggling them to his hearts desire. A wet stain made itself present between Fubuki's legs, which her nephew touched with his fingers, causing Fubuki to shriek in surprise.

"Hey!" She muttered.

"S-Sorry!" He let go.

Fubuki was panting.

"Just my ass, okay? Not my parts."

"O-Okay."

So he continued, moving those buttcheeks from side to side, feeling the soft fabric of the panties, the even softer texture of his auntie's behind.

How good it felt to slid fingers in between.

Fubuki's leg jumped up and down.

"Oh, pull them down already, just fuck me!" She thought. Her body's overheating.

A loud gunshot coming from the TV almost made her cut herself.

Her husband is still there. His presence grounded Fubuki back into reality, and causing her to panic. 

"Alright, Anon, that's enough."

He didn't listen, and squished her butt more.

"Anon, stop." She said bluntly.

"B-But-" You pouted.

"Anon." Fubuki repeated in a firm tone.

"Yes..." He sulked, and went to the living room to sit next to his uncle to watch the movie that was playing.

"Hopefully he won't take it the wrong way, I hope he can understand." Fubuki thought.

~*~

And to a degree you did understand. You knew the game you were playing with your aunt was dangerous, which is why you wanted time for you two only. The only thing that stood between you two was the man sitting on the couch next to you.

Kenji.

You envied him. Even before you and your aunt had begun your little escapades, you had envied him. You loved Fubuki. You loved everything about your aunt. If you had been him, you wouldn't have left her alone for a split second, and yet he did when he worked. You didn't know Fubuki had a job too, since she worked from home, most of the time, or you hadn't been in her care when she left the house.

Kenji, that bastard. There was something about that hurt you the most, something that made you feel impotent and powerless, and it was that he did "that" with your auntie when they were alone. He got to kiss her in view of everyone, and no one looked at them strangely, he grabbed her ass and Fubuki gave him embarrassed stares, he would make love to her at night, he'd do all the things that your parents, and the people in your dad's CDs did. You knew. Why does he get to have everything you want?

After your auntie had taken your first blowjob in her car and the initial shock had washed off, you thought of yourself as a man. You were Fubuki's man now. And now you'll need a job just like your mom, and you'll come back home tired to Fubuki and taste her cooking and bring her to bed to caress her until next morning. All of those happy thoughts however, were nothing but fairy tales. A few days after turned you into her man, your mother had come to pick you up again, she told you to wave goodbye to Fubuki and pulled on your hand to get to you walk with her. Why are you getting in the car? Why are you going back with this woman? You had incredulously asked her if you had to live with your auntie now, to which your mother said "Shit, no." 

Why, why? Why did she still live with Kenji if she had you? Why does he touch your aunt when she's supposed to be yours? Why can't you love your aunt like he can?

Your body, naturally, was small. Kenji had strong arms, Kenji could drive a car. You couldn't carry groceries like he could, you couldn't make love to your aunt like he could. You were nothing next to him.

And that took its toll on you. You wanted to be him, you wanted him out, yet you couldn't hate him. Hate is a powerful emotion. You wouldn't learn it's true meaning until years later. Kenji played with you, he cheered you on when you did, he let you win. He wasn't a bad guy, but he's the one thing standing between you and your auntie, you thought.

That night, you wanted to make Fubuki yours, even if he was there. You didn't know yet how sex worked, but you had an idea that you had practiced on your pillow.

You sneaked onto your auntie's room. Kenji snored like a wild animal, while your auntie let out quiet breaths.

You assessed the situation before climbing onto bed. One false move means death. You searched for your auntie in the dark room with your hands, first getting a hold of Kenji's hairy leg. You turned your attention to the other side and found Fubuki's smooth, firm calves.

You heard her soft, feminine breathing in contrast to her husband's snores. Here she is. Your auntie, your lover, your woman.

You sat between her legs and pushed forth with your hips to make some space. Fubuki felt you, and slowly awoke from her slumber.

"K-Kenji... could you wait until... the morning...?" But she soon realized her husband was sleeping next to her. The form of whoever was in bed was much smaller in size, and soon realized it was you.

Fubuki's eyes jolted in place, her body froze as to not ruin the moment. Pretending she wasn't turned on from the situation would've been a lie. The best course of action right then, according to her, was to pretend to sleep. 

You caressed your auntie's belly. So soft and pudgy. 

Fubuki almost giggled from the tickling she felt from your hands, so she bit her finger to shut herself up.

"Anon..." She thought. "I'm sorry our special day was cut short. He must be so mad..." 

And that you were. You remembered something you heard from one of the girls in your class. 

"When two people love each other, the woman's belly grows. And then they have a kid!"

Does that mean that Kenji doesn't love his wife? That doesn't matter. You loved her, you would make it happen.

Fubuki's leg laid straight on top of the bed. She thought of bringing them up, but realized that would give away the fact she was awake. Fearing you'd lose your courage if you noticed, she imply spread them a bit apart to give you enough space to fit in between her thighs.

All Fubuki was wearing was the same panties she had shown you, and an oversized tee for a pajama replacement. You straightened your legs and lined your crotch with your auntie's. And now, you trusted, slowly, calmly. Neither must wake up. You wondered if your auntie would be mad that you were doing this, but figured she was doing it with you in her dreams.

And right now, Fubuki was dreaming wide awake.

Her body tingled with each time she felt you rubbing against her. In short, quiet breaths, she muffled her moans.

"Oh god..." She thought.  "Anon...!"

You brought your hips up and slammed them down onto Fubuki's crotch, then soon enough, you noticed it felt better if you just rubbed them like you did before. It's hard to do so when your body's so stiffly straight, however. You tried to get some room by spreading your knees out a bit, just enough so you could move more comfortably. Fubuki notied your efforts, as you were tightly stuffed between her thighs.

Slightly, slowly, Fubuki lifted her thighs from the bed until you could fit your knees under them. Now you could thrust a lot easier.

And so, you did. Meanwhile, Fubuki's hand rand quietly under her shirt and pinched her nipples. She bit down on her free hand to shut herself up.

"Oh fuck!" She thought. She could feel your little cock rubbing on her flower, and she was about to burst like a busted pipe. Whether you knew you were rubbing her clit or not, Fubuki felt it. Electric shocks were being shot thorough her body in short spasms. She's sleeping, she told herself. Keep quiet, keep still. 

Keep still...

Keep...

A loud gasp escaped her mouth, which caused you to halt your movements and wait for a sign to retreat. Clutching her bedsheets in a panic, Fubuki imitated her sleeping sounds as best she could. Soft, quiet breaths and a few more exalted ones. She didn't want you to go, not now. What if she just grabbed you with her legs? But Kenji could wake up. Her mind's a mess, and it's your fault. She spread her legs a bit more to lure you back in, just as she turned to face her snoring husband. 

"Sorry, Kenji..." She thought. Faithful until now. Not his friends, not her coworkers, none of them could swoop her off her feet, instead, it was the little boy that he treated so fondly, that he had helped bring up even. Fubuki felt a violent stream of emotions inside her, all paling in contrast to her desire. All of this while she stood completely still.

You bought her act, and hunched yourself forward and over her body. You hugged your beloved auntie by her sides, clutching her love handles and digging your face onto her tits and resumed your thrusting. As soon as she felt you rub up against her again, she let out a satisfied, but quiet gasp.

You're getting that funny feeling in your crotch again, it's feeling warmer and warmer. You feel a dirty pleasure, you felt *so good*. Your auntie is lying under your body, and you're going to engrave your name into her heart.

Now the bed's creaking. The sound, the thrill of being caught is working up the both of you. The bed frame is lightly tapping on the wall with the rhythm of your thrusts. Kenji stops snoring for a split second before turning on his side, facing Fubuki.

"Oh fuck, fuck!" Fubuki thought. Her hand massaged her tits while she sucked her two own fingers with her mouth.

You were closing in on your limit. You felt the same sensation you had done before, and Fubuki taught you not to run from it. You're feeling your crotch tingle. Here it comes, here it comes.

"Oh no!" Fubuki sucked air through her teeth as quietly as she could. "I'm going to cum, I'm gonna cum from getting dry humped! I'm cumming, I'm cumming!"

You felt your body shake just like it did in the car while Fubuki's legs vibrated around you. You gasped for air. Fubuki bit her hand violently, denting it with her teeth to shut off the sounds she was holding in.

Is she awake?

...

She's giving no signs of life, other a deep breath she just took.

It's time to get out. You separated your hips from your auntie's and realized that your underwear was wet. But why? Did your auntie have an accident...?

Best to keep those thoughts away for now. Carefully, you got up from the bed and left with nimble steps towards the guest room you were sleeping in.

Fubuki waited to hear you close the door, and then she quickly got up and locked herself in the bathroom. Turning the lights on, the first thing she noticed was the mess that was her underwear, as if she had squished a water balloon between her legs. The next, a permanent smile drawn on her face. Now that she has some privacy, she began to process the situation. 

That was the greatest orgasm she had had yet in her life.

*She wants more*

~*~

The next morning, your auntie made pancakes. She gave you the big, extra fluffy ones. 

Kenji went to the backyard to work on a personal carpentry project. You heard his machines cut the wood and the hammer slam the nails into it. Fubuki approached you with nimble steps.

"Anon." She called your attention.

Oh no, are you in trouble? Did she wake up yesterday and wait to scold you today?

Fubuki knelt into the ground, you swallowed as you waited for her reproach, but you weren't ready for what came next as she placed her lips on top of yours. At first it was a normal kiss, and then it turned into one you didn't know.

Fubuki's tongue shamelessly let itself into your mouth. The difference in size between hers and yours was greatly pronounced. You didn't understand what she was doing, but you didn't refuse her. Instead, you tried to find a spot in her mouth as well, even thought your tongue couldn't reach inside as easily. The sounds your mouths are making, the feeling of her slimy tongue brushing yours... it's addictive. More, more, you never wanted this to end.

"Anon! Come check this out!" Kenji yelled from the backyard. Fubuki didn't break her kiss. Her hands locked around your shoulders to keep you in place. Not until she's had her fill. 

"Anon!"

Now Fubuki stopped, and as she pulled back, a bridge of saliva connected your lips. 

"C-Coming!" You yelled towards Kenji.

"That." Fubuki spoke. "Was a grown up kiss." She wiped the saliva from your mouth. "You're only supposed to do them with someone you love."

Your eyes lit up. That means...!

Fubuki gave you a short kiss on your forehead. Then she winked with her left eye and brought her index finger to her lips in a "shh" gesture.

You understood.

"Now, run along, and remember." She said. "This, is our secret. Okay?"

You nodded.
