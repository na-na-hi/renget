### Howl Cloaked in Tundra ♂
A young and controversial figure, Howl Cloaked in Tundra is the proud bastard child of a wealthy noble and infamous warlord who has forced his way into the world of Rantrum's politics.

Unknown to the world until a few years ago, his lineage is twofold. His mother is the wealthy and beautiful Song Draped in Silk, matron of the Linen Tribe, well known for it's fine textiles. Although presumed to have been hatched many seasons ago, she did not announce his existence until he inherited her position in court.

In court he represents the interests of the Linen Tribe and acts as the sole method of diplomacy between the Rantrum Kingdom and Roaring Thunder, a roaming warlord who commands armies of both ferals and wilders. With these warriors, he pillages both villages and trade routes, holding onto plentiful fruit patches and hunting grounds, as well as posing a threat to the stability of the kingdom.

While Howl Cloaked in Tundra's legitimacy as a noble is often come into question, removing him from his position invites instability. Many see this compramise as appeasement to a hostile force.
