->*"... Memories are the only real treasure any human can hope to hold always."*<-

>**Name:** Xicotl

>**Tao:** Tao of Sacrifice

*"To be in the world, to see *teotl,* is to sacrifice. It is not just what we give for the *teotl,* the flesh so suffused in divine warmth, but the pains of living we must endure for them. Not out of devotion, but out of an obligation that all - mortal and divine - must make so that the cycle may continue. Life can only come from death, creation from destruction, being from non-being. To take, you must give. To give, you must take."*

*"I have given the flesh of others and my own blood. I have given food from the mouths of those who needed it most. I have given wealth, time, and the annals of my mind. I have given... I have tried, so very hard, to give all that I love. Then, I gave my home. Soon, I may give my mind. I have given *so much,* only for the world to turn to ash in my hands."*

*"We have all been given a second chance at life, beneath the next Sun, and our debt winds around our throats like barbed vines.  I will give again. You will, too, *child.* I must make you."*

*"Forgive me. Please. I can not let it happen again."*

>**Philosophy of Tao:** Heavenly (+175)

While difficult to equate to the true Tao of the Heavens given the alien nature of his beliefs, Xicotl reveres the primacy of the natural world over the arrogant whims and wishes of individuals in it. The end of his path, as is true for all beings, is death and rebirth. All flow in the river of *teotl,* the palpating heart at the core of all creation. All is flesh, all is blood, equal under the Sun.

 >>[Hundred Falling Talons]

Before the God-Mantles cloaked him, Xicotl was dust in the grand tapestry of life — birthed amid sorrow, nurtured by the collective efforts of his village. As a sapling bends to the wind's will, he was shaped by timeless traditions: venerate the ancients, tremble before the gods, and steel oneself for a life drenched in blood and war in their exalted name.

Upon reaching the cusp of manhood, he embraced the emblem of the Winged Sun, as was the rite of passage for young warriors. But with each step the Nomad took, the earth mourned; the jungles bore witness to the scars of countless razed villages, and the rising screams of the innocent forever danced in the shadowed corners of his vision.

Glory, glory always to all.

*Three creatures, alien and hungry, climb from the shadow of the collapsing sea.*

*One, a serpent, swam up the river through bounds of time to chase the scent of an old, tired monk preparing to leave his picnic.*

*The second, an eagle, swoops down and takes a treasure from the monk before he leaves, slicing and sealing weakened flesh.*

*And the third is never seen. A fleshless hand emerges from the dark, to place his lost child onto the shore.*

*The one who would inherit the treasure - and, in their design, bring them the new world.*

##Cultivation

>**Cultivation Techniques:** The God-Mantles
Since the caress of Tlaloc's tempests gave birth to the rivers, the Empire's priesthood has been the conduit of celestial wisdom, passed down from the very divinities that graced the universe. To the likes of Xicotl and his people, cultivation is not a mere ascetic practice. It is reverence and prayer, a symphony of devotion to the hall of the heavens, where the gods peer down with ravenous curiosity on their thrones among the stars.

Mortal vessels, the priests, become divine conduits, attaining timelessness by assuming the face of their gods. These sacred methodologies, channeling a god's power, are called "God-Mantles."

Though called "techniques," God-Mantles transcend mere physical regimen. They are a mosaic of esoteric rituals, practices, profound thought patterns, and behaviors seeking to channel a god's favor. To an adept versed in the ways of Tao, these might appear scattered and amateur. Yet, for those like Xicotl, who view cultivation as an act of reverence rather than a path to self-perfection, and understand the cyclical dance of life and death under the Sun's eternal gaze, the intricate minutia of technique is meaningless. For in their eyes, destiny has already been scripted.

>>**Qi Cultivation Technique:** [Feathered Serpent Fang Mantling] (-10)
>>**Qi Talent:** Spirit Root: Immortal (-20)
>>**Variant Spirit Root:** Exotic (-25)
>>>**Domains:** Fire, Wind, Light
>>**Cultivation Realm:** 6

The Feathered Serpent Fang Mantle encompasses the mysteries of *Quetzalcoatl*, a god of life, light, wisdom, and lord of the winds. While many might be misled by Quetzalcoatl's non-warlike nature, the power it bestows is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

Those who channel the Feathered Serpent’s grace witness the dance of *teotl* firsthand, tapping into a spiritual reservoir analogous to qi. This ethereal connection enables the practitioner to manifest the latent energies of the world. From manipulating gusts of wind to summoning searing flames, practitioners can also revitalize the life essence within themselves and others.

Given its encompassing nature and balance between tranquility and might, it's no wonder that the Feathered Serpent Fang Mantling stands as a patron path among the priesthood. Xicotl, despite the beckoning of the Winged Sun Lord from his warrior days and the haunting allure of the Bloodied Bones, finds solace and trust in the embrace of the Feathered Serpent. For him, Quetzalcoatl's wisdom has been an unwavering beacon, a voice of clarity amid the cacophony of divine whispers.

>>**Body Talent:** Bloodline: Immortal (-20)
>>**Noble Bloodline:** None
>>**Cultivation Realm:** 6

The Winged Sun Lord Mantle is a demanding and fiery path, resonating with the core essence of *Huītzilōpōchtli*, a god of war and willpower, and lord of fire and the Sun.  The Winged Sun Lord is not merely a deity to be revered, but an embodiment of the raw might that all warriors seek to capture in their essence.

For those initiated in the God-Mantling process, a deep understanding of their *istli* - the pulsating heart and core of their being, is fundamental. It's more than just the physical heart; it is the very fragment of the Sun's fierce warmth that's said to reside in each human. Through sacrifice and rigorous training, this *istli* can be channeled, allowing the practitioner to tap into the Sun's power, attaining its overwhelming prowess, its duality of life and death, and transcending mortal limitations.  This spirit granted Xicotl the unyielding vigor of a warrior, long before he came to comprehend its divine origins.

The Winged Sun Lord is not a deity of long conversations or intricate puzzles. His essence is as the Sun: relentless, blinding, and domineering. A force that burns away doubts and hesitations, demanding only one true tribute - blood.

>>**Soul Refining Technique** -  [Bloodied Bones Smile Mantling] (-10)
>>**Soul Talent: Mind Sea:** Immortal (-20)
>>**Soul Scenery:** Possessed (-10)
>>**Cultivation Realm:** 6
>>>**Soul Scenery:** An shallow red sea hanging beneath pitched darkness, stretching infinitely in all directions. Dead temples rise from the mire, reaching like stone hands towards an eclipsing sun in an otherwise starless sky. It is a shattered vision of Mictlan - Xicotl's underworld. Those who witness it are overcome with a numbing, nihilistic emotion, weakening the resolve of their defensive and evasive techniques. They become less motivated to protect themselves - and more open to Death.

Virtually unknown to all, among the old and new worlds, the Bloodied Bones Smile Mantle is a haunting path, drenched with horrific visions and profane cults. Unlike the illuminating teachings of the Feathered Serpent or the fierce solar might of the Winged Sun Lord, the Bloodied Bones encompasses the essence of *Mictlāntēcutli*, the god of death, the lord of the underworld.

The god of the underworld isn't one to offer guidance or strength to persevere; he embodies the quiet smile that waits for every being, especially those who have lived without honor. As the Broken Face, he revels in the misery of the dying, waiting with raised arms in the pits of Mictlan to feast on their innards, swallow their very souls and the dust of dying stars.

Xicotl's reluctant discovery of this Mantle, after the death of the previous Sun, is a constant source of anxiety. The presence of this god, and his teachings that seep into Xicotl's dreams, are macabre, demanding the very essence of humanity to be shed. It's a path that goes beyond mere self-sacrifice; it's a complete metamorphosis into an entity devoid of human emotions, empathy, or restraint.

It is said that in the waning years of the Empire, Mictlāntēcutli had grown uncontrollably voracious due to the influx of dead stars in his realm. Their intoxicating taste drove the god to the brink of madness, pushing him to neglect his divine responsibilities. He desired nothing more than to rise from the blood-red seas of the underworld, swallowing the stars and all things between.

For every passing thought Xicotl has of a loved one's face since his resurrection, it is a smile, offering a hand to pull him towards a black, lightless pit.

##Martial Arts

>>[Black Sun Hymn]
>>[Kindly Earth's Embrace]

>**Comprehension:** Immortal (-30)
>>+1 Qi Gathering
>>+1 Body Tempering
>>+1 Soul Refining

As as both warrior and preacher, Xicotl fights with a knife and an empty hand. His bulky, rippling physique often betrays his staggering speed, as Xicotol favors quick, disorienting movements that grind down the senses and focus of his opponent. As the warriors of his world once fought, terror and shock are his sharpest weapons.

###**Fanged Incantations**
>**[Razor Wind]:** Grade VI Attack (-10)
A fundamental incantation derived from the Feathered Serpent's wisdom. Through a sweeping knife movement, a priest may twist the *teotl* in the air, parting it with a sharp red wind that slices and rends soft flesh. It may come as a billowing gust from any direction, as all open air is exposed to *teotl,* but Xicotl favors a more tactical art: churning the winds into a sustained tornado of blades that can move independently of him. With a more controlled application of *teotl,* the priest may infuse these winds with elements beyond the Feathered Serpent's bloodied winds, such as sunlight or flames, to further enhance the destructive potential of the technique.

>**[Flame-Venom Veins]:** Grade VI Reversal (-10)
An intermediate incantation derived from the Feathered Serpent's protective desires. Xicotl has Quetzalcoatl's fangs infused into his blood, and when struck, a *nahuatl* word of vengeance is uttered, and the priest's wound erupts into a geyser of bright-red, sizzling blood infused with flame-venom. Flame-venom blood is thick and weighty, burning with magma's heat. It clings and seeps towards the flesh of those it spills onto, burrowing into their hearts and igniting any *qi* drawn into their body. It is an unspeakable pain that only a true devil would wish to inflict upon another living being. As the pain spreads through their core, threatening to render their *qi* useless, the cultivator must force the venom from both body and spirit. In whatever form that takes, Xicotl is granted an opening.

>**[Honor-Devouring Serpents]:** Grade X Barrier (-20)
A technique developed by Xicotl himself. By invoking a rite of honor to Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent may grant His vessel the grounds for combat. With the incantation, bright-red serpents of all shapes and sizes emerge from the ground around Xicotl's feet, growing larger by the second. They are not truly living creatures, only expressions of *teotl* made manifest in Quetzacoatl's sacred animal, and they exist to serve one purpose: bind around one another like wrappings to form a circular arena wall of wrapped snakes in diameter just wide enough to house a duel for Xicotl and one other person. The arena will remain until one person inside is down, whereupon serpents will lash out to bind this person to the ground for sacrifice. If any attempt to leave the arena, the snakes lash out, pulling them back towards the center.

###**Solar Techniques**
>**[Tonal Step]:** Grade VI Footwork (Free - Martial Empire)
To be described.
TL;DR As long as Xocotl is standing in direct sunlight, he can vanish in a disorienting flash of light and teleport anywhere within a short range as long as it is in direct sunlight. Obviously, useless at night-time and much less effective indoors.
>**[Hundred Falling Talons]:** Grade VI Barrage (Free - Martial Empire)
To be described.
TL;DR Xocotl kicks up into the air and then swipes with his tecpatl, mimicking the diving motions of an eagle. Each swipe creates a burst of momentum, allowing him to stay in the air as long as he can keep swiping. Slashing through someone or something doesn't stop his momentum at all, and in fact, increases it.
>**[Red Sun Over Paradise]:** Grade VI Trump Card + Detection (-20)
To be described.
TL;DR Xocotl extends his tongue and begins slicing it in a ritual. If he makes a full cut and utters the incantation, those around him have to witness as the sun turns into a bright red hue. The red sun burns through stealth, illusions, barriers, and soul sceneries of an equal grade or lower, and those in exposure to direct sunlight start hemorrhaging blood and life force at a rapid rate until the ritual ends.

###**Smiling Rites**
>**[Ominous Wind Hymn]:** Grade VI Stealth (Free - Martial Arts)
 X, causing anyone who hears the whistle for a few seconds to have their minds altered to stop perceiving Xocotl, either making him invisible in their minds or to see him as a bird, small animal, etc. 
>**[Pass Through The Underworld]:** Grade VI Travelling (-10)
Xocotl can slowly descend into any pool of blood large enough to stand in fully, entering a separate "bloodspace." Xocotl can move through bloodspace at a much faster rate than realspace and can see a limited area of realspace around any pool of blood. Passing through an area in bloodspace causes anyone nearby to hear a rushing wind sound. If Xocotl emerges from a pool of blood, it makes a very loud and noticable bubbling noise before he pops out.
>**[Hungering Flesh Rite]:** Grade VI Ambush (-10)
To be described.
Xocotl lunges at any enemy's weak spot (usually their throat) and extends sharp teeth from his mouth, biting into them and attempting to take a chunk of their flesh out. Any flesh he consumes from a cultivator gives him a little bit of *qi,* life force and soul energy back. 

###**The Sacrifice**
>**[Kindly Earth's Embrace]:** Grade VI Trump Card (Free - Martial Arts)
To be described.
Xocotl extends a hand and channels a three-god prayer onto a single target. The target will feel their limbs starting to seize up, and instinctively know what Xocotl is trying to do. Unless they've been drained/disoriented by other techniques, or don't see it coming, they have a clear opening on him. If Xocotl completes the prayer, he can command all three of the gods in his favor to hold down the limbs of his victim - they become paralyzed for a few seconds. Xocotl, usually, will then have the opportunity to plunge his hand into their chest and rip out the victim's heart.

To be described.
>**[Descend Unto Earth, Great Lord: War God Exaltation]** Other: Grade X (-20)
To be described.
>**[Black Sun, Ashen World: Dead God Exaltation]** Other: Grade X (-20)

The Tecpatl, instruments of celestial origin and mortal craftsmanship, are the revered emblems of the Fifth Sun's priesthood. These blades are not mere tools; they are sanctified symbols of authority, echoing the sacred rites of sacrifice that sustain the Empire. Crafted from the most pristine obsidian, their enigmatic, inky luster is said to be accentuated with god blood, imparting to them an aura of both reverence and dread.

Black, being nature's most ardent sun-kissed hue, grants the tecpatl an arcane attribute. Upon command, the tecpatl's blade can darken into an abyssal void, allowing it to absorb the purest light when held aloft towards the Sun, intensifying its sharpness for one, unparalleled, devastating strike.  It becomes, for that fleeting moment, a blade that can rend the very fabric of reality.

##Backstory

In a realm untouched by the Tao, the very fabric of existence thrummed with teotl. Born from the primal sacrifices of fickle celestial beings, this energy wove a tapestry of creation and devastation in which mortals danced. To honor the gods, a sprawling martial empire rose, anchored by a priesthood chosen by the heavens. Their sacred duty? To fuel the Fifth Sun, offering up the divine fire pulsing within the human heart, thus ensuring the dance continued.

Carved from the womb of his dying mother, Xocotl was rooted in an isolated maize-farming village. The mystique of his birth draped him in illusions of predestined greatness. Bereft of blood ties, he turned to the gods, seeing them as his only confidants, his soulmate-anchors in a sea of ephemeral, arrogant, and misguided mortals whom he viewed as takers, oblivious to the balance of give and take. Unyielding determination fortified Xocotl's heart. He was the chosen vessel of the gods, every act he undertook was bathed in divine necessity. The gods bled, so must mortals.

 For the empire and the world, blood had to flow, war had to be waged. Xocotl was the herald of such wars, the artist of death whose palette included enemies, bystanders, and even allies he deemed unworthy. Those who survived his onslaught were tethered to the fate of sacrifice as all are, for human bodies are more precious and divine than even the most lustrous gold.

To his prey, capture by Xocotl held a terror beyond even death, but it was a different act than merely killing them. In those fleeting seconds of living, breathing capture, a flicker of hesitation would always dance in Xocotl's eyes, only to be quickly smothered, but it became harder each time to ignore it. Love, as is true for Taoists, is a warrior's greatest weakness.

From a rival tribe emerged a woman, one who did not quiver at Xocotl's shadowed reputation. In her defiant gaze, Xocotl saw a fierce truth that eclipsed the decrees of any deity. It stayed his hand at the mouth of their village, waiting to be burned and claimed.  Against the tumult of his warrior spirit - all the evils he'd wrought in the name of the gods - she chose to love this man, and she called him a man.

As genuine human touch scorched his being, Xocotl recoiled, leaving a village untouched in his wake. He fled not just from her, but from the unsettling warmth of his own rekindled humanity.

Though he could no longer face the theatre of war, Xocotl's contributions resonated through the echelons of the empire—temples, priesthoods, god-guards. Priests, those rare souls attuned to the rhythm of teotl, ascended beyond mere mortality. Relinquishing human indulgences, they bore the weight of cosmic duties, they were the sentinels of dawn and the breath of winds, sustaining the ever-hungry cycle.

For Xocotl, renowned as the Pious Nomad, the temples' shadowy sanctums beckoned. Bound by oaths, marked by the blade, he sought solace in these chambers, away from the crimson jungles. Somewhere deep, he sensed the seeds of his destiny germinating. And so, under wise tutelage, his true cultivation began.

For epochs, Xocotl bore the God-Mantles, observing the Empire's inexorable expansion, propelled by warriors who mirrored his former ferocity. Wisdom dawned upon him, superseding his innate disdain for humanity and blind veneration. For eons, which seemed both fleeting and eternal, he felt anointed in his priestly sanctum. The Feathered Serpent, speaking as an echoing chorus from the world's undulating rivers, guided him: uphold the rituals, nurture the cycle, and bask in tranquility.

But a malevolent shadow engulfed the Empire. A blight gnawed at the sinew and spirit of both the devout and the damned. Fields blackened as crops withered in decay, and the Empire's feeble legions became fodder for the covetous gaze of surrounding realms. Bound by his sacred oath, Xocotl remained tethered, even as multitudes perished at his temple's steps. The clergy, ever focused on celestial omens, were blind to these terrestrial cataclysms. As the storm raged, many vanished into secluded sanctuaries. But Xocotl would not cower. He sought deliverance.

It appeared as a captive, ushered into his sanctum by mangled warriors, with fervent pleas from dwindling royalty: her sacrifice would rekindle the Sun's benediction. Resolute, Xocotl was prepared to lay waste to all to forestall the impending doom.

Yet there she was, bearing the visage of the one whose love had once ensnared him. Her eyes, weary yet defiant, regarded him. His years of divine servitude crumbled, leaving a bitter residue. Feelings he had evaded, returned at the end of all things.

A serene smile adorned her face as Xocotl's tecpatl, intended for her heart, instead sought the lives of those who pleaded for her end. A cacophony of desperate lamentations enveloped the temple, then the city, and soon, the world, as her fingers gently grazed Xocotl's blood-smeared visage.

The sun turned black.

Awakening amidst verdant meadows cradled by majestic, fog-cloaked peaks, Xocotl felt the Sun's warmth again for the first time in untold eons. But as he touched his face, it was coarse, jet-black, and granular. Coated with the ashes of the underworld. Life thrummed in his chest where there should have been nothing - death for him, for his love, for all things. Three compassionate hands lifted him, and he beheld the vast expanse before him.

"Punishment is existence," intoned three voices in harmonious dissonance, emanating from the ebony, throbbing heart he clutched. "The cycle persists."

"But you will be our voice. Our hand, our messenger. Take the Heart, and continue your journey. Prepare this new Sun for us."

"And you will never have to fear love again."
