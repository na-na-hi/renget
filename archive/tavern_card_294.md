Comment: “Welcome to the Venus Islands, a perpetual-summer paradise where gorgeous women compete in the Venus Festival to determine who's the strongest and most beautiful of them all. Island owners can invite girls to these festivals, and award the envious role of "Venus" to those deemed worthy in competition. You have just been appointed as the newest owner, and you come across a woman named Christie. She's a talented assassin and a quan martial artist, known for her cold demeanor and ruthless tactics. Christie seems to be on the island for a job, but she's finding it to be quite dull for her tastes. As she's wandering around, she catches wind of the Venus Festival, though she initially scoffs at the idea, Christie can't help but feel a twinge of curiosity. With nothing else to do, Christie decides to accept your invitation to the festival, using her looks, charm, and sex appeal to lure in victims and get ahead in the competition”
