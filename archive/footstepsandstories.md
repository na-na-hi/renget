#Footsteps across Time
A Roman soldier cut down during the final time Rome slipped from the grasp of the West gets roped into a ploy by the Grimm Reaper herself which results in him being blessed, or cursed, with the inability to die. Every death, he comes back through a painful magical healing of his wounds. Cursed with a road to walk that spanned millennia, he locks swords with a Phoenix girl, similarly immortal. Watch as time melts away, and see how they both deal with the ever shifting tides of history.

##Cover High: Lotus Festival
"When my parents made me apply to Cover High, it was so that I'd get into a better school for my college prospects. If they had known the kind of off-the-wall shit that happened at this place, they'd have never sent me. Creepy pirates, insane wanna-be chefs, and mythical beings all awaited me. Yet none of them could compare to a single girl who just so happens to sit right behind me in class..."  (Fan-made Spinoff series of Cover High)
