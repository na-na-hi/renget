###Introduction
Yggdrasil has come to an end, but some see this as a new beginning.
What was your character?
 
While the game's servers still ran, you earned several Levels and Attribute Points
Choose your Character's Level:
 
Standard Mode: 100 Levels & 110 Attribute Points
Seedy Mode: 80 Level & 100 Attribute Points
Sample Mode: 30 Levels & 75 Attribute Points
Starter Mode: 1 Level & 60 Attribute Points
 
Starters can only assign Attributes and pick a Race (or Job if Humanoid), but then must skip to the Scenarios
 For other Levels, do (Level/2 + 60) to calculate your Attribute Points, round down
 
####Info: Attributes
The DMMO-RPG Yggdrasil imposed engine limitations on the ability to manipulate a character's actions.
These limitations take the form of Attribute Values.
Attribute Values have a fixed limit of 40, which represents 400% of an average human's capabilities
As an immersive VR MMO, this allowed some users to live an inhuman experience
 
Physical Scores:
STR: Determines Carry Weight Limit and ability to apply Grapple, Knock Out, and Stagger
DEX: Determines Physical Action Speed
CON: Determines Vitality Regeneration and Damage-over-Time Resistance
 
Mental Scores:
INT: Determines Supernatural Action Speed
WIS: Determines the ability to Detect Hostiles Targets and Accuracy
CHA: Determines ability to apply and resist Mental Status Effects
 
Each Attribute Starts at 0, but leaving them there is Fatal. It is generally wise to have at least 10 in each Attribute, with a higher Value going towards build-specific Attributes. Having not maxed an Attribute at 40 is also wise as it allows Attribute buffs to not be wasted.
 
Spellcasters only need 20 in their casting Attribute to cast 10th-tier spells provided they have enough mana and high enough caster level to qualify.
 
Attributes also determine your Skill potential, so keep that in mind.

 ####Info: Levels
Character Levels:
As a game heavily influenced by RPGs of the past,
Yggdrasil boasted a plethora of fantastical creatures, arcane spells, and martial techniques.
It was best known for its system of Racial and Job Classes.
Which allowed users to tailor their characters in any way they chose.
 
There is an overall Level Cap of 100
 
Users were offered a variety of Humanoid, Demi-Humanoid, or Heteromorphic Races.
 
Humanoids:
  The vanilla option, having little to no innate Physical or Supernatural abilities
  They had no Level cost, giving more levels to Job Classes and ensuring their popularity
 
Demi-Humanoids:
  Human-like creatures that possessed simple Physical Abilities
  Their Racial Class required an investment of 10 Levels
 
Heteromorphs:
  Inhuman creatures possessing a number of natural Physical and Supernatural abilities
  Their base Racial Class required an investment of 15 Levels,
    but they also came with prestige Racial Classes, giving more options to character creation
    at additional Level cost
 
Racial and Job Classes grant the users a Martial Level, a Caster Level and Vitality points
This is a metric that determines the strength of a Character's abilities
Martial Level empowers Physical Abilities, such as the use of Martial Weapons,
  determines your Stamina and how many Martial Skills you know 
Caster Level empowers Supernatural Abilities, such as the casting of Spells,
  determines your Mana Pool and how many Spells you know
Vitality determines how much damage a character can take before dying or being knocked out
 
IE: These are shown as [ML +5/CL +5/V +7]
 
The Energy Types
Heat/Cold/Acid/Sonic/Electric/Light/Dark
 
Many Races either have Positive% Resistances or a Negative% weakness
IE: These are shown as [H 25%/C -25%/A 25%/S 25%/E -25%/L 25%/D -25%]
Neutral Resistances are not shown
Having 100% Resistance means you're Immune, but only if it's gotten from Classes not equipment
Having -100% Resistance means you take double damage and are susceptible to additional effects
more easily from that Energy type.
 
All Races are considered as Creatures, but
Creatures may refer to Beasts or other non-playable Races
Living races are every other race except Constructs and Undead
Constructs are Automatons and Golems
Faefolk are Fairies and Nymphs
 
Positive Energy heals Living and harms Undead
Negative Energy heals Undead and harms Living
Neither Positive nor Negative Energy heals or harms Constructs,
But Transmutation Arcane Spells can heal them
 
 
####Info: Spells
Yggdrasil featured well over 6000 "Unique" spells split between its various spellcasting classes
They were grouped into Arcane, Divine, and Nature Magical Traditions

!!! info
	Perform an Action (physical) tends to have a meaning related to the specifics of the ability. For example, a Hunter would be able to look around, smell the air, listen intently, or feel for vibrations in the ground to activate their ability to determine a Target's location.
 
	Perform an attack Action means that you can attack in any way that you normally would to apply the effect of the ability, but some Weapon types will restrict which attack Actions can apply the Effect. For example, while wielding a Spear you can only apply a Sunder Effect with a Thrust attack, but while wielding an Axe you can apply it with a slash attack. No mention of a duration means it has a short cooldown.
	
	Perform an Action (magic) means that you can recite a chant or mantra, make a gesture or series of gestures with your hands or limbs, or utilize a casting focus. There are certain other actions that can qualify, but these are odd exceptions. They cost no mana.
 
	Perform means to use one of your Performance Skills. For example, playing an Instrument or Singing.
	
	Custom spells/abilities do not have an XP cost or Mana Cost, their cost is only a long casting time and/or a very long cooldown

Every build is capable of Unarmed Strikes, but only non-lethal (causes Knocked Out Status Effect when Vitality reaches 0).
Having an Attribute 20+, Caster Proficiency 70+ and Mana Pool 25+ you're capable of casting one 10th tier spell.
(You'd also require a Caster Spell List size of 190+ to unlock a 10th tier spell or a Tome of Spellcraft)
 
Martial/Caster Proficiency has diminishing returns after a score of 100. Only damage/healing increases; no increases in duration, range, chance to inflict, etc.
 
Regen Speed is determined by Ki Control and Mana Control, plus any bonuses from abilities or equipment.
  Stamina Regenerates naturally way faster than Mana and has way shorter delay before starting to recharge,
so much so that it's expected Casters having no Mana Regen when starting combat.
  Vitality Regeneration is dependent on Constitution Attribute score
 
Anyone with Arcane(INT) can learn new Arcane spells through Spellcraft, for Free
  Learning took many in-game hours, however. It was an incredibly boring minigame
 
Can Recalculate Stamina, Mana Pool, Martial and Caster Proficiency with Equipment Bonuses.
Don't recalculate Physical Action Commands Size, Physical Resistance, Caster Spellbook Size and Supernatural Resistance with Equipment Bonuses.


###Character Skills
 
Now that you have your Attributes and Classes
You can understand what your Character is capable of
 
All Skills have a Maximum Score of 100, and a Minimum Score of 0.
All Skill have a base score derived from your Attributes.
Some Skills require conditions to be fully unlocked, they're Soft Capped at a certain score.
 
A Score of   0 represents lacking the Concept.
A Score of   1 represents recognizing the existence of it, but nothing else.
A Score of   5 represents having a white/black Understanding.
A Score of  10 represents the average of a Commoner from the Medieval ages.
A Score of  30 represents having Competence to be Referred to.
A Score of  50 represents being an Expert in the Field.
A Score of  80 represents Mastery.
A Score of 100 represents Incapability of Failing.
________________________________________________________________________
You have [((STR+DEX+CON+INT+WIS+CHA)-60)*8] Free Skill Points to distribute how you want
For Level  30, that's 120 points.
For Level  80, that's 320 points.
For Level 100, that's 400 points.
For Nephilim, add an additional +128 points.
 
Don't forget to meet your Class requirements!
DO NOT recalculate your Skills from ability/equipment Attribute bonuses.
 
If the base score of a skill is less than 10, use [multiplied Attribute-1]
(IE: If [STR+CON*2-20]/[CON*3-20] is 1, use [CON-1] for base score)

#####Equipment - The Art of Artifice
In Yggdrasil, Equipment was ranked based on its Capacity for Data Crystals
 
The rankings were:
Low(+1), Medium(+3), High(+5), Top Class(+7), Legacy(+9), Relic(+11), Legendary(+13), Divine(+15)
  (For the purposes of the CYOA, they have been assigned a linear Data Level)
 
Each Data Level represents one Spell Tier to be embedded in an object
  (IE: Low-rank Equipment will have a permanent Tier 1 Spell imbued)
 
Every in-game material possessed an inherent Data Level, with rarer materials possessing more
  Artificers were able to prime a Crafted Object using In-game Currency
    This "unlocked" a Data Level based on the Object's material
  They could then imbue a Spell and more currency into the object, creating Equipment
 
Creating Equipment through Artifice required a sizeable amount of In-game Currency
  As such, Data Crystals were the preferred method
 
Data Crystals were dropped from monsters, bosses, loot chests, etc.
  They possessed a random magic effect chosen from Yggdrasil's thousands of spells
  Using one allowed non-Artificers to turn Crafted Objects directly into Equipment
    As increasing a Crafting Skill cost no Levels, nearly all players had at least one
  Objects still had an inherent Data Level, but using a Data Crystal was Free
    You just needed to find suitable materials to make an Object
 
TL;DR Only Artificer Class can permanently imbue spells into weapons and armor
      Anyone with a craft Skill can permanently imbue Data Crystals into weapons and armor
      Data Crystals are one time Spells in Loot form

Guild Creation Scroll
A System-level scroll that allows you to start a Guild and become its Guildmaster.
Being in a Guild or having additional scrolls can increase your value as a Guild member.
  You are considered a +1 active member for every additional scroll. 
  Depending on Guild's scenario it has different value. For more details check scenarios.
 
Accessory Slot
Allows you to wear an additional accessory

  Both options grant World-Class Immunity, a.k.a. World Protection

  NPC has World Protection.
 
Fallen Leaf of Yggdrasil
Allows you to create a World-Class Item: an Object containing vast power. 
Create your WCI as a SAC, without being limited by Racial and Evolution Classes for pre-existing abilities.
The only limitation is abilities can only be in effect if the Item is equipped or being used in some capacity. 
  Pre-existing abilities can't take 'create a custom spell/special ability' abilities.
It also has a 20 Data Crystal capacity. 
  SAC-like abilities and Crystals don't have to be thematically cohesive. Don't require Data Crystals to fill.
Having a WCI in possession grants the user World Protection.
Alternatively, make a 40 Data Crystal stat stick.

###Guilds
 
While the Yggdrasil servers still ran,
Players would often "Party up" to Level, compare Builds, and collect Data Crystals together
Sometimes, they would form a Guild
 
If you have a Guild Creation Scroll or Wished (upon a star) to be a Guildmaster, you can form a Guild!
Decide on your Guild Name, Guild Goal/Purpose and Requirements to join
Choose an Emblem or Color Scheme if you so desire
________________________________________________________________________
#####Guild Base
 
Guilds start with an Exterior Floor and 1 Extradimensional Floor.
The Exterior Floor can be any structure you desire
A Castle! An Asylum! A Colosseum! A Bakery! 22nd Century Neo-Tokyo! Anything!
 
The Extradimensional Floors can be almost anything!
The Terrain, Structures, Environment, and Aesthetics are up to you
 
The Exterior must have an entrance to the Extradimensional Space
Intruders must be able to access the Guild Weapon!
 
Can spend AoE Data Crystals to permanently enhance a specific area of an Extradimensional floor.
 
You get 1 more Floor for every 2 additional members
You can have a maximum of 10 Extradimensional Floors (and 1 Exterior Floor)
________________________________________________________________________
#####Guild Weapon
 
A Guild Weapon is special equipment, that represents a Guild.
If it breaks, the Guild is considered destroyed, all dead NPCs are forever gone.
Would require another Guild Scroll to regain your Guild and start anew. 
 
A Guild Weapon has an inherent ability to Edit Guild NPC Combat settings.
Guild Weapons are Divine-Class; have +15 Data Levels.
It's Primed and ready, it just needs Data Crystals!
Recommended to have at least [Mending (1)] on Guild Weapon, don't want it to naturally get destroyed from neglect!
 
You can fit +1 Data Crystal (of any Data Level) or quest Accessory on Guild Weapon for every 4 additional members
Your Guild Weapon can go up to +7 Data Crystals or quest Accessories
________________________________________________________________________
#####Guild Jewelry
 
Guilds starts with 5 pieces of Guild Jewelry.
These are Free +11 Relic-Class Equipment, they don't take up an item slot!
These can be given to Guild NPCs.
 
Decide amongst yourselves what these +11 Data Level contain!
[Arcane Mark (Tier 1)] is Required, so decide on the other +10!
 
You get 5 more pieces for every 2 additional members
________________________________________________________________________
#####Guild NPCs
 
A starting Guild gets 200 Levels to allocate to Unique NPCs.
Decide amongst yourselves!
 
NPCs each get 1 Crafted Weapon and 1 Crafted Armor
They have a Potential Data Level based on the NPC's Level!
Potential Data Level = 5 + (Level/10), round down.
They just need Data Crystals!
 
You get +100 more Levels for every 2 additional members
You can have a maximum of 2600 Levels allocated to Unique NPCs
 
Guilds also allow spawning of non-unique Level 15 NPCs to defend the base.
Can have as much variety in non-unique NPCs as you want, but they'll cost extra in-game currency for upkeep.
Can't assign their levels.
 
 
Play Nice
________________________________________________________________________
***Guild scenarios***
All Guild scenarios can only be chosen by a Guildmaster,
and require either a [Guild Creation Scroll] or [Wish] to be a [Guildmaster] to be used for the creation of a Guild.
 
 
[Turning off the Lights - A Lonely Guild] (Req. not more than 3 active members)
Yggdrasil is coming to an end, but it arrived early for your guild.
You exchange some lonely words with the stragglers, a remnant of this once wondrous legacy.
It saddens you that so few are present. Someone has to turn off the lights.
The lights don't go off.
• For every active guild member you have, add 15 inactive members.
In the New World there are... complications. Your NPCs, being so long abandoned, don't have loyalty in their hearts anymore;
you'll need to earn it back. Or perhaps the only way they could have managed was to become fanatically devoted and desperate to
their last master(s). No matter what, it is clear that the greatest obstacle to your guild's survival may be found within.
Their scrutiny may be your death sentence.
 
 
[The Last Banquet - A Fragmented Guild] (Req. 3 active members)
Yggdrasil is coming to an end. The invite was sent out and a few responded.
You have a good time with old friends, but the missing parts stand out. Friends who have since quit.
A longtime inactive pops back in. You all rejoice. So does an NPC. Wait, what?
• For every active guild member you have, add 3 inactive members.
The New World marks a new chapter in your guild's long history. Your NPCs are loyal to the cause, but those with missing creators
notice what is gone. Pangs of longing, perhaps even jealousy, wrack their hearts. Will you heal them before they find themselves in
trouble? What if a missing member shows up centuries down the line?
 
 
[One Final Hurrah - A Tightknit Guild]
Yggdrasil is coming to an end. You all are ending this on a high note.
The guild hall is vibrant. Members file back in from the last big guild event. Not a single soul is missing.
There is a closeness that you feel to your comrades, one that you're sure will continue beyond the game.
Someone points out the clock.
• No inactive members, but Guild Scrolls used here add an effective value of +2 members instead of +1.
Your guild is small, perhaps young, but it had the endgame economy to abuse and the activity to take advantage.
Your NPCs are extremely well geared. The New World is going to get one hell of a surprise.
• All NPCs have two additional Crafted Items. Can be weapons, armors, or accessories.
They are scaled to level as normal. They still require Data Crystals!
 
 
Definitions:
• Active member - Someone who played the CYOA and joined the guild. Additional Guild Scrolls give +1 value to you as a member.
• Inactive member - Can't be someone who played the CYOA, they're just backstory. Inactive members didn't log on and aren't with you.
                      They scale up your guild though.
If an active member stops being active in the thread, they still take up active slots.
________________________________________________________________________
!!!danger
	**==[Banned]==** *(Req. Possessing 2 World-Class Items) **(Must be taken if you meet the requirements)***
		Due to unexpected high rate of World Class Items, the Yggdrasil automated system has been suspending accounts on the grounds of cheating. Due to the game closing, the devs can't or won't help get users their accounts back. Best to give it to an NPC, trade it away or let it all end one day earlier.
________________________________________________________________________
***Singleplayer Scenarios***
Yggdrasil has ended, what comes next?
 
[Awaken in the New World] (Req. Level 80 or Level 100)
  As Yggdrasil comes to an end, your vision slowly dims only to be filled with blinding light
    you slowly come to your senses, finding yourself lying in at the edge of a deciduous forest
  You notice a small farming village in the distance, surrounded by a simple wooden fence
  You have been transmigrated somewhere in the New World
 
 
[Babby in Nazarick] (Req. Level 1)
  You awaken to find yourself born to one of Demiurge's breeding experiments
  You are accepted into Nazarick's ranks as a peon, and must prove your worth to your superiors
    You have a Level cap of 60 to work towards. Get to it, peon!
    As you grow, you'll come to discover your innate talent as a New Worlder
      This is a random, at-will magic effect, usually between Tier 1 and Tier 3
      It'll probably be trash, like 50% faster basket-weaving
  They'll never let you get close to Ainz-sama, but you might become subordinate to a guardian
    if you ever reveal your nature, expect to get deleted by Albedo's kill squad
 
 
[A Green Start] (Req. Level 30 or 80 Goblin)
  You are a member of the Goblin army summoned to defend warlord Enri
    Your name: Goblin <Profession>!
   Are you green enough dude to defend the village?
  If you're Level 30, you're a high-ranking foot soldier
    You're probably a Paladin-Knight or Artillery
  If you're Level 80, you're in Goblin high command
    You work directly with the warlord and oversee all 5000 goblin troops
      You're stronger than Lupusregina, so the 13 redcaps all defer to you
  You're too valuable to let die, Nazarick is watching you
 
 
[The 42nd Supreme Being] (Req. Heteromorph and forfeiting an extra Accessory Slot)
  The frontier village you awaken near is Carne Village.
    It's a veritable fortress, staffed by over 5000 Goblins under warlord Enri
    Should you introduce yourself to the villagers, Lupusregina Beta will report this directly to Ainz-sama
    Albedo seems distrustful, but Ainz-sama recognized your name. How? Well, it all began with being lucky...
  If you won a Guild Creation Scroll through Gacha, Carne Village qualifies as a suitable Guild Base.
________________________________________________________________________
####Data Crystals
Spells in crystallized form
 
Depending on Crafted Object you can fit a certain amount of Data Levels
For example a Divine-Class has 15 Data Levels, it can fit any combination of 15 Levels worth of Data.
Data Level is displayed near the Data Crystal's name.
 
You can only gain the benefits of a Data Crystal once. Having 2+ of the same doesn't give additive benefits.
Lesser/Greater Data Crystals count as the same. (IE: [Mage Armor] and [Greater Mage Armor] are considered the same)
Those marked with an asterisk* can stack, but only if the benefits are different, and subsequent Data Crystals cost 1 Data Level less.

###QnA
 
Q: Do I have to divide my Caster Proficiency?
A: Maybe, See examples:
    Arcane (INT) and Arcane (INT)                     - No
    Arcane (INT) and Arcane (CON)                     - No
    Arcane (INT) and Divine (CON)                     - Yes
    Arcane (INT) and Divine (INT)                     - Yes
    Arcane (INT), Divine (INT), Theurge               - No
    Arcane (INT), Divine (INT), Divine (CON), Theurge - Yes
 
Q: Can I pick <Overpowered Class>?
A: Yes, if you make it one of your Secret Advanced Classes
     You can get 2, and they are 5 Level each
       They grant TWO custom abilities or ONE custom and TWO pre-existing Class abilities
     Try to make it something possible in a game engine
 
Q: Can have World Item? Caloric Stone? What are they?
A: Try to win Gacha or pick one item for FREE. Their effects are defined in Cash Shop
 
Q: Can be little girl? Can be babby? Can be pretty?
A: Zuranon didn't say you couldn't. Prettiness is somewhat limited by race.
    For example, Nephilim can be aesthetically ugly or horrendously ugly.
 
Q: Attribute increases/decreases? Attribute doubling?
A: Attribute increases/decreases are +/-
   They still follow a cap of 40, so getting a +4 at 38 STR gives you 40 STR
   Nephilim +8 to two Attributes is an outright change
     Apply the change as Permanent and recalculate Skills
   "Considered 2x" is an effect that can scale an Attribute over 40
     This is applied after all other +/- Changes.
     Do not recalculate your Skills, Skill Cap, or any final calculations.
   Multiple "Considered 2x" go up by 1
     For example two/three/four "Strength is considered 2x higher" will get you 3x/4x/5x
   "Considered 2x" only affects the determined effects of Attributes mentioned in the beginning
     STR: Carry Weight Limit and ability to apply Grapple, Knock Out, and Stagger
	 CON: Vitality Regeneration and Resistance to DoT, etc.
 
Q: Character size?
A: The more "Strength is considered 2x higher", the bigger you should be
     If you don't want to, don't be. It's just expected.
 
Q: Why can I be big and lift anything, but deal no extra damage? Why can't I do thing that I should?
A: Video game logic. Everything goes out the window once you get isekai'd into the New World.
 
Q: What's the difference between Physical Resistance and Armor?
A: One gives flat(-) damage reduction, the other percentage(%) damage reduction.
 
Q: Where the metamagic at?
A: "Channel mana for additional effect" is your metamagic. All spellcasting in Yggdrasil are silent,
   player's only announce their spell out of courtesy for their teammates. 
     You can consider Immunity to Silence to be silent casting, if you want.
 
Q: How do you expect us to make ~50 Commands or ~300 Spells?
A: I don't. Those numbers indicate your builds versatility. You don't have to write every command/spell you can use.
 
Q: Why is Supernatural action speed doubling so OP?
A: It isn't. It affects start-up frames and recovery frames, but not active frames.
     If it affected active frames then you could do double damage from concentration spells.
     The same with Physical action speed and automatic firearms. You can aim faster, reload faster, but the bullets don't come out faster.
 
Q: Elemental Immunity? 100% Resistance?
A: Elemental Immunity is 100% Resistance and 100% Resistance is Immunity. Anything that lowers Resistance lowers even Immunity. Anything that pierces Immunity makes both Immunity and Resistance set to 0%.

###Terminology
Afflicted - the one suffering from the Status Effect
Afflicter - the one who put the Status Effect
Another - not Afflicted (3rd party or Afflicter)
If it's not mentioned to be Permanent, it has a duration.
"Another's basic action" could be a slap or a shout, just a general "interact with", no skill required.
"Cannot be removed by Afflicted" doesn't mean "Cannot be prevented by Afflicted"
There are positive Status Effects, but they're not named in the CYOA.
(If it matters, I'd make Immunity to Mental Status Effects from equipment ignore positive Mental Status Effects as well, but I don't feel like making buffs)
________________________________________________________________________
