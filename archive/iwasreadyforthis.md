**Question Post**

Posting JRPG Traitor questions:


1. What is Lyceus's power level? Isn't he a max level Hero regardless of 7th generation branding? I would think that you don't lose your powers or brand even if your generation's Overlord is defeated or a new generation comes along, but I could be wrong.



2. Why was Reed's family targetted by the Malgold Trading Company? Does it have to do with the death of Aelinore's mother?



3. Can we get a reveal on Eve Viloro's origins and how they relate to her being the Hero? Is she an artificial soul made through DAEMON? Is she the soul of a previous Hero brought back through CANOPE? Is she the gimped soul of Auspice Eternity itself? I mean, it's obvious that she's some sort of artificial being, but what's the source of her affinity to being a Hero?



4. What was Amarant Allochthon's supposed sin? Does it have to do with reviving Mazdayasna?



5. How does Albano Audamar's status as hero work out if Drusilla becomes Overlord and Augustus is dead?



6. Is it weird that I'm suspicious of Queen Clymnestra given that all of the Reyanes princesses have different colored hair and eyes? I mean, I guess they're still within range of what's possible, but it's still suspicious. On the other hand, both Ildefonso and Aelinore share Prospero's white hair so that's oddly consistent.



7. Is my assumption that a brandless Mushari Kamin would join the Heroes on their quest make sense? I mean, even if she's busy being a Paladin, dealing with an Overlord seems exactly the kind of thing that the Paladin ought to do anyways. It only makes even more sense that Sidith would give her the job for the more volatile or inexperienced Hero candidates like Sasiana or Reed. 


**Answer Post**

1)Most powerful character of all the Hero sections, the others might be able to match him in time, but having control of Death makes Lyceus incredibly lethal. The brand grant no powers on its own is more like an identifier than anything else. It does fade after the Overlord in question is dead.

2) Merchant family that were getting a little too snappy. To be honest, it is pretty dull, so feel free to manipulate his origin story as you see fit.

3)Another cutoff plotline from when Loyalty Missions were more important, she was Prospero's prototype of messing with Truths most of all ESS;(SCR).

4) Your suspicions in 3) were right, only about Amarant and not Eve. She's the incarnated soul of Auspice Eternity, which her name references. Amarant is and alternate spelling of Amaranth, a flower that never wilts representing Eternity, Allo- is a prefix which means displaced and Chthon refers to the underground, to Earth, the element over which Eternity has control.

5) He'll be conflicted about it, but his loyalties were to Augustus, not Drusilla, and he made it clear what needed to be done to Overlords.

6) She was and is loyal, to the eternal chagrin of Ethelgytha.

7) It's a nice addition, anon, and it makes sense. You have my blessing.

And with this, I'm out for the day. Also, if any of you wish to contact me, even if it's just to call me a nigger here's an email so I can't avoid your questions: [JRPGTraitorAnon@protonmail.com](mailto:JRPGTraitorAnon@protonmail.com)

The truth is that I got rangebanned, and have no means of posting. I'm doing this from a friend's PC

OK, I'm up. Time to answer questions
>>67625211
Desire fits the most, but as long as you only get three advanced tokens out of your Reason, feel free to bend the limits a bit.
>>67625247
Yes. Everytime you see "x token of your choice" you can select from all colors of babby and big boy tokens
>>67625370
Because the other options give other things over sheer power, and having a harem, or 5 bros watching your back had to cost some tokens.
>>67625661
Overlords that don't exist if not picked: Alis (Not Isekai'd), Athanas(Not ressurrected), Revysia(Not born)
What the rest do if not picked: Tagus is still slumbering in Yun-Ilara, Harosa doesn't return, Malgold faces his oncoming death with more dignity and threat other people a bit better, Belya'al never finds Nakbé and is just a warlord, Drusilla's husbando doesn't die, Mazdayasna isn't ressurected, and Yazata decides to wait a bit more to see if the Auspices fix themselves.
>>67626049
That's not even a bad idea.
>>67626514
Overlords can be used for Life events (yes, this means you can romance the Overlord without doing their Loyalty Mission this way), otherwise, Evil Word, Evil Deeds is the only way to get friendly with them.
>>67626526
Yes. The Auspices seem to have really bad aim picking people this time around.
>>67626591
As mentioned above, you can have a relationship with them via Life events, but they won't have time for quirky side adventures unless they loyalty mission is done.
>>67626743
>>67627402
If the textbox doesn't have "REQUIRES:" and power names below that, it's fluff and be bough with no requeriments
>>67628077
Mostly pixiv/gelbooru, some artstation. Also, fuck image hunting.
>>67628116
Correct
>>67628442
Like the alchemical sign of Sulphur, pic related.
>>67628602
Not necessarily, that range was given for all races. If you're human or beastman, you can be an adult at 20 years, or even less, if you're demihuman.
>>67628656
Yes.

The only point of criticism is that the Magisters are not human beings, nor have been replaced since the creation of Sabii. They are the creations of the Fourth Overlord, and related to the Dream Element. The ones that there have been multiple generations of are the Ministers.


Well, google translate is not conveying much of that first sentence. If you mean that Yazata is a loner or an outsider, then yes. She's been alive for so long that things like lenguage and culture have shifted around her, and she feels the generation gap deeply. If you mean that when she's Overlord she would be too suspicious, then maybe? The Auspices have never failed, so if they're branding Heroes without an Overlord, the easiest answer would be that someone with power over the Auspices is hiding the Overlord's brand. And, if you mean that she would be immediatly suspicious of the player character, then that's on me. One setting detail that I forgot to include/should have remarked more on is that the number of Heroes has varied through time and only settled on five after the third Overlord. Yazata was the only Hero against the first Overlord, and there where only three Heroes for the Second.

That's another thing I should have remarked upon more. All Heroes grow in power through the journey, not to the level of the player character but enough to give them a though time five-on-one. The only indication of that in the CYOA itself is the unleash familiar power, which is too little. Lyceus is the strongest at the start, but since he's so strong, he doesn't grow much.


[And question no.2. Alice seems to have moved on from Earth to the world of betrayal, so is Alice immune to things like death, emptiness, and silence because she is not made up of mana? And who was the person who gave her the power and sent her to the world of betrayal?
No, she's not immune. She has access to broken OP stuff thanks to being the Gamer, but it would be better to say she's part of mana with the memories of something that isn't. As for what transported her, it's part of yet another unfinished plotline: the New Dreamers were to be more important, as they did stuff like ressurrect Athanas, transport Aliss, and Revysia is the manifestation of one of them. There really are a lot of things that are unfinished in JRPG, now that I think of it.

Oof, that's a deep question. Essentially, truths are bonds among Mana, that change the properties of it beyond elemental aspectation, the lore justification for spirits and concept bullshit. In the lore MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI is a  philosophical Monad, everything (with some small exceptions) and nothing all at once,  when you pick the will of Mana, you are turned into a bubble within that not-so-Monad, making you ignore one of the big rules of the setting: everything ends in THE END FOREVER.  So you are turned into a kind of mini-Monad aping the rules of Mana, which defiance is a part of, going against big M, who is probably going to turn itself into another setting with completely different rules the moment this one ends.

I guess thats the best for my intentions, I wanted to make a serious story-wise build, and a meme jrpg build with the isekai girl. She said that Auspices could be considered secret bosses but they felt like normal final bosses after reading the CYOA. MANA felt like the strongest thing and the closest to a "true" god, so fighting him with essence of defiance would be very troope-y. Also, it would serve as justification for me min-maxing the other aspects of the meme jrpg build.

I didn't put anything to that effect in the CYOA, but I like to think about different FFs as something like succesive transformation in a boss battle. So i'd say the passive effects stack, but the big fuck off transformation must be one at a time.

I see. My next questions are more focused on lore than mechanics. It is said that the truth of love is unknown to the gods, is this valid only to the small gods, or even the big ones, like Sish, or perhpas even MANA?

Tongueless
:
Mana knows love, because in the end all is part of him, but the rest of the gods, from the big 3 to the smallest of small gods (before becoming demons after trying to get clever with the big 3), don't feel love.

Also, I don't have any problem in particular with this, but Drusilla for instance is only suppose to be romanceable with reroll. What is suppose to happen if you try to romance her with some extremely powerful magics and similar of love and charm?

I have two more questions for now, for when you come back, if you can answer. The first is a lore question that I asked in the thread, for a possible third build, the other one is a mechanic question that I had forgotten to ask:

1) If I waifu Adelina and she stays by my side, will she enjoy if we were to hunt her middle sister and rape her together?

2) Does YOOD blue advanced power dos anything? If so, what? It feels more like an event than an ability. And related to it, if I get the The will of MANA, can I use the not-mana creation for anything?

I have more questions.
First, can I fuse elements together to create new ones? Same with truths.
And in particular, could I make fusions to make elements opposite of some of the originals? Like create some Truth of Hate to be opposed to Truth of Love.
I was particulary interested in making an element of "Reality" or something similar to oppose "Dream". Maybe Dream + Mung? (That is, the "death" of the 'dream').

For elements, the ones in the CYOA are all the ones that are stable enough to exist for more than a few seconds, any others that you make are the equivalent of nukes that will explode very soon. As for truths, there are more than those in the CYOA, and if you want you could homebrew a few, they should cost one Advanced Red token. There's already an "element" of Reality, it's called Mana

Second, how strong Ood really is? It’s my understanding that he wants to awaken MANA and bring the end of the world. So I also assume that his powers come from MANA. It is also heavily implied that his powers goes way beyond what he shows to the party. Also, there are characters potentially stronger than the Overlords as companions, like Ningen, who was one Overlord in the WIP. And normally we don’t get to fight Ood, since he betrays the party to go with us.
I was thinking of making him the possible final enemy for the story of my main build.
Something like him coming to this world that has less interference from the Auspices to organize him praying to awaken MANA and bring The END. And/Or knowing that the traitor character would eventually meet MANA when he get The will of MANA, and use this opportunity to awaken MANA and bring the END.
I was thinking about the sketch of the story:
The traitor would be an elder demon that fought in some old demon war when was young (Maybe the one from Athanas?) and was imprisoned since then.
After some long time he gets the mark and is freed to help the heroes deal with Harosa. But he thinks it’s weird that the Auspices want to call a crusade one a woman that just walks abounds saying silly things and sometimes even helping people, so there might be some truth it what she says and he decides to investigate, betraying the party for it.
Later he works with her and discover that she is right about the END, and tries to find a way to avoid it unlike her, but this goes completely against the objectives of Ood who wants to awaken MANA, and then at last Ood betrays him and shows how powerful he is demonstrating that he was the true JRPG Traitor™   all along.
[
8:33 PM
]
Tongueless
:
Ood is, like the character he was named after, the prophet of Mana, so he's got a version of FF:Magi on steroids, so he's pretty stronk. I didn't writte him with the goal of awakening big M in mind, but reading his entry again, it's a pretty good theory. The only problem with your plan is that it would be easier to awaken Musahn, and get to the end that way, rather than expect someone to get FF:SHUSAI and exploit the meeting to wake up MANA. Other than that, good plan, it will be interesting to read.

[
8:42 PM
]
Tongueless
:
Top of my head, the list of situations which trigger the end are: Musahn being born, Mung killing Sish, Mana waking up, and the Drummer picking up his shit and leaving. Any one of those happening should trigger the rest and make the end happen

Ood has a shot solo against most Overlords, because Void is OP, but if you want to suitably power him up ust have the fight occur in Imrana, because as the prophet of Mana ha can pull fucktons of the same, and Imrana has no limits to ambient mana like the worlds do.

Ell
:
Is Alis the potential strongest overlord? I was thiking in picking her in the my second, meme, build.
Also, for my third traditional villain build, Adelina would enjoy to rape her sister again, but would she be fine with her husband also raping her sister?


I guess these are all my questions for now, other than... what are the best forms to contact you about the CYOA? I feel like I need to read the books and think more about the options before making builds, and writting about them itself would take time. I may have other questions in the future, and I would like to show you the complete "work"

And you don't need to read the books, they are a strong inspiration, but my setting has only a bit more in common with them than Final Fantasy and the mythologies whose names they use.

I feel like reading them would help understanding some names and references all the same, even if it's not the same thing.

Ell
:
(and can you answer the first two questions related to my other builds?)
[
9:17 PM

Tongueless
:
She's the potential strongest, but as someone juiced by the dreamers, she can't get ESS;(KIB), ELE;(SISH), ELE;(SLID), or STA;(MUNG), and any of the powers that derive from them, because the gods are giving her a middle finger for being an outside context problem. If you raping Aurea give her a stockholm syndrome for Adelina, she will be grateful for it, otherwise she will just think of it as "discipline" for her waywards sister.

If Alis is juiced by the dreamers does that mean she can eventually survive past The End by herself without something like ANIMA from the player anon?

Related to the question of Linux, since Dream is a different monad from mana, (and mana is suppose to be all that exists), does this mean that Dream is outside the scope of Big M?

I was wondering in particular if I could get some pseudo-truth/element of "Hope" by melding Dream with Defiance, in particular because Ood fights with Void and wants to bring The END, and I always adored this scene from sandman: <https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/96890-choronzon-i-am-a-dire-wolf-prey-stalking-lethal-prowler-morpheus>

I also wanted to play with the idea of Hope because it's the main thing that would differentiate the traitor from Harosa, since she got completely (or almost) nihilisc when she learned the truth
[

Ell
:
(And talking about similirities with Harosa, can you give a bit of backstory of her before she learned the truth?)
[
8:39 AM

Tongueless
:
That scene is the good shit. And I think I already mentioned that you can homebrew truths, if you want to, Hope should work well as one. As for Harosa, she was part of the priest caste of Nakbé, whose main job was to give offering to the gods so that they don't destroy them again.

Seems like you missed my questions, so I'll repost it again if that's ok:

If Alis is juiced by Dream power (which is fundamentally seperate from Mana and will exist after The End) does that mean she could eventually survive the End under her own power? 

Question 2: I feel like an idiot but I cannot see a functional difference between (Adv. Green powers) REANIMATE and AGGREGATE. They both let you grow undead beasties together. Is it that AGGREGATE makes creatures that are more powerful?

Question 3: Is FF:SHUSAI the only power that lets you survive past The End? It seems like suitably powerful control over Dream and/or becoming an Archon with FF:RULER could be possible alternatives?
[
9:42 AM
]
Tongueless
:
Yeah, I missed them, give me a couple minutest to answer
[
9:44 AM
]
Tongueless
:
1)While Alis is empowered by the dreamers she's not one of them, so when Imrana overflows she's gonna go with the rest of everything, if she survives until that point, of course.
[
9:48 AM
]
Tongueless
:
2) Aggregate is reanimate's advanced version,  and while reanimate lets you make bigger undead, aggregate lets you fuck with the laws of life and make the biggest undead short of a lich. I didn't explicitly state it, but anything killed by a monster made with aggregate will rise as an undead with no need for a necromancer to interfere.
[
9:49 AM
]
Tongueless
:
3)Archons are going to go with the End, but control over dream and making a place that ignores the rules of Mana (like The Sea That Never Was) might let you escape the End.

First Lore pastebin, powerlevels and timeline before the Auspices in rough detail: <https://pastebin.com/HgMCfare>

### PASTEBIN (tongueless = JRPGT Anon

>JRPG Traitor Lore
Rough Power Levels:

1. MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, New Dreamers (who's stronger depends within which of them you are inside, as you're inside Mana for the CYOA, he's stronger.)
2. Power Gap
3. It's a big Power Gap
4. The Great Gods of Pegana: Kib, Sish, and Mung (Gods of Life, Light/Time, and Death, respectibly)
5. The Drummer, the Godmourner, and the Dreamseeker are weaker than the big 3, but will survive whole and healthy past THE END FOREVER. (You) after the end, if you have FF:SUSHAI
6. Imrana and Musahn
7. Slid, Roon, Limpang-Tung, Yaoharneth-Lahai, other big gods that are invited to Pegana, but don't reside there.
8. Most builds (You) can have.
9. Archons, aka the gods that weren't strong enough to demand residence in Pegana, but could still make their own planes and rule there. 
10. The Auspices
11. The Beasts of any of the gods mentioned above.
12. Power Gap 2: Electric Bogaloo
13. The small gods of the worlds, before they abandoned their godhood and became demons.
14. Most Overlords
15. The Magisters of Sabii
16. Most Heroes at the end of the Journey
17. Most Villains
18. The small gods that became the spirits of the land.
19. Most Heroes at the beginning of the Journey
20. Most Innocents, and common warriors and mages are here
21. Normal people who don't know how to fight.

 
Quick and dirty timeline of events before the Auspices.

1. MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI, The Drummer, the Godmourner, and the Dreamseeker roll into Nothingness, and make existence start.
2. Imrana is born
3. Pegana is made and all the gods are born
4. The gods tire of the Silence, and sing the moon and the worlds into being, wounding Imrana for the first time. Small gods move to the worlds, where their domains exist and are active.
5. Kib, seeing that the worlds are barren, decides to spread himself upon them, giving rise to life. This is when the worlds start teeming with different lifeforms, some of them sapient, but none have lasted until today.
6. The Sea, Slid, steals a great deal of power from Imrana, and invades the worlds, submerging most of them within himself.
7. The rest of the gods, seeing that Slid could best Kib, Sish, and Mung once, try to rise up and demand a place in the highest point of Pegana, close to the Drummer and Mana, from the three.
8. Kib, Sish, and Mung get buttmad and fuck the lesser gods up so much that the weakest of them become braindead, the ones of middling strength forsake their domains and become demons to escape the torture, while the ones powerful enough to make their own planes bunker up in them until the great gods calm the fuck down. Slid helps in fucking the lesser gods up, earning a place for the Sea in all the worlds.
9. A long time passes and demons have built their own civilization, incredibly pious, even if they don't remember what happened eons age, the fear of the gods practically genetic in them.
10. The gods of Pegana think: “Hey, maybe we went too far fucking up our little brothers up, let's give them another chance.” They give back a demon who was the descendant/reincarnation of a god of the sun his domain, and a book detailing how demons can go back to being gods while pleasing them. It's seems things are going well, and demon civilization reachs level of power and happiness never seen before under their immortal sun king.
11. Athanas gets killed. Gods get buttmad again, destroy civilization and bind the demons into never making another home for themselves for six thousand years at the very least. If the fucking brats won't behave, they deserve to stay mortal and get fucked as mortals.
12. Five hundred years later, the Beastmen come into being by sundering themselves from their mother, Imrana. They are everything that the gods want in a mortal worshipper, except a bit needy, and not their creations. Still, they rekindle hope for mortal civilization within Kib.
13. After a thousand years, Kib makes the first humans, and they quickly earn the blessings of Sish and Mung with their beautiful voices. For the first time since the Beginning, the gods are truly pleased with their creations, bestowing all sorts of blessings and gifts upon them.
14. Five hundred years later, human population has grown enough to build cities, their ability to speak with the mindbroken gods of the land letting them make wonders. Around this point, the Saigoths write down the Dosa Oracles before dissappearing from the face of the universe.
15. During the following millennia, many cities of mankind are built, Man displacing or destroying the beastmen tribes and demons that are in their way. The greatest of the two, Aradec and Ilara, are built in this period.
16. The following 500 years are a golden age that outmatches even the one brought by Athanas. The gods are even proud of what they have made, like boomers loking at freshly mowed grass. And then Ilara rebels against them. Aradec is still pious, so they decide to simply send a few calamities against Ilara and hope the men there learn their lesson.
17. Surviving the calamities, Yun, prophet of Ilara, mocks the gods about their fate when THE END happens. The gods have an autistic meltdown, retire all their blessings from mankind, and Slid creates Tagus to sink Ilara.
18. The next 500 years are chaotic, mankind is still strong enough without their blessings to survive, but most of their great cities, requiring the power of the gods to be sustained, start breaking down, prompting an emigration towards safer places. It's at the end of this period that Sidith goes from a small fishing village to a fortified city.
19. The next thousand are an stable period, marked by monsters coming into preeminence in the zones that humans had to abandon, and civilization becoming points of light. It ends when the Sorcerer-Kings of Sidith creating the Auspices, and destroy most of the relics and records of what came before. Elves are also created at this of this period, their lives meant to be fuel for the Auspices.
