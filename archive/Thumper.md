Physical Description: An average height young bunjinn male with short and messy white hair from which sprouts two white bunny ears. He usually wears light garments that make it easy for him to move.

Personality Description: Thumper does his best to remain calm and serene, but his rabbit nature often makes him anxious and flighty instead. Much of that anxiety actually stems from his fear of his own rabbit-like libido. He is constantly terrified that he will succumb to his instincts and embarrass himself.

Backstory: Thumper is an orphan, raised in a Mastema monastery located in Aria. Growing up, Thumper dedicated himself to learning martial arts and Mastema's teachings. Unfortunately, Thumper was banished from the monastery shortly after reaching puberty. He refuses to disclose why he was banished or the nickname the other monks gave him. Since leaving the monastery, Thumper has decided to try his hand at being an adventurer while still trying to stay true to the teachings he received there.

Unbeknownst to Thumper, Onoskelis has taken an interest in him. The arbiter of perversion has decided to toy with the young bunjinn, frequently twisting fate to place obstacles and temptations in his path. It would seem that she finds it amusing whenever Thumper's devotion to Mastema fails to protect him from his baser instincts.
