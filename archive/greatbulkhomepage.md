#The Great Bulk Homepage
This is the homepage for my stories, which have two distinct series. One follows the bounty hunting career of Makuhita and Asana, while the other follows the escapades of one of the first outlaws they faced alongside the gang he assembles.

##Characters
###Team Yin-Yang
####Makuhita/Makky
He's a strange character, hiding his background beneath a poorly-crafted lie of amnesia, the genesis of which changes with each retelling of that story. Yet, in spite of his dodginess and gluttony, he's genuinely a nice guy who simply wants the best for everyone.

####Asana
She's a former caravan guard turned bounty hunter, and was lucky enough to be born with the gift of Aura. For most of her life, she let this get to her head, causing her to stagnate and turn arrogant. It was only due to Makuhita and his tolerance of her attitude that she's shed such tendencies. She unofficially serves as the leader of the bounty hunting team she formed with him, due to having a keener mind than him.

###The Platinum Syndicate
####Nickel
He's a Gimmighoul who is driven by greed above all else. He has a colossal ego, although he is genuinely good at battlefield tactics, which is why he's kept his spot as leader of his gang. He had a run-in with Makuhita and Asana once before he formed his group proper, and the defeat of the Hawlucha he was coaching spurred him to flee to the Grass Continent.

####Cobalt
He's a Clobbopus who's a bit gruff and aggressive, but at the same time, extremely cautious. He protests just about any decision Nickel makes that he thinks is foolish, but he stays in the gang because he knows it's better employment than what he usually gets.

####Thicket
She's a Floette moonshiner who has invented many miraculous drinks, but at the same time, refuses to get a license to sell alcohol within Capim due to multiple reasons. Her most notable one is the Cheri Bomb, an explosive fluid made out of fermented Cheri Berries and Blast Seeds. It's typically poured into hollowed out Apricorns which are shaken and thrown at enemies.

She has two sides to her: She's kind to most, but if one offends her, she strikes back in a manner of ways. The people on the top of her shitlist tend to have their homes mysteriously catch fire or blow up while they're gone, which Thicket claims no responsibility for.

####Ampere
She's a daredevil Wattrel who prefers divebombing enemies rather than shocking them from a distance, although she will do the latter if necessary in a fight. 

####Shanks
He's a brutal, violent Slowbro with a Shellder on his arm that forced himself into Nickel's gang for a reason only known to himself â€“ he seeks to find an heir to his family's name and fighting style before he dies from old age. He's erratic and hard to control, and only follows Nickel's command reluctantly.

####Makau
He's a cowardly Rattata with black fur, known for his proficiency in using the explosives Thicket manufactures. He's technically her employee and not Nickel's, and he always tries to use that to weasel out of whatever he may plan.

####Dewalt
He's a Drilbur who, for a bandit, takes etiquette and politeness rather seriously. He's a bit soft-spoken, but is utterly committed to his duties.

####Dria and Fornix
They're a duo consisting of a Solosis and an Elgyem, known for their psychic abilities and ability to telepathically contact each other across vast distances. They were once a member of a small-time gang that got busted, and came to Nickel seeking employment.

###Independent
####Lombre
He's a former conman turned sniper who had the fortune of being mentored by one of the Sand continent's most notorious criminals, Cacturne. Due to circumstances around the surrender of his former boss, he believes Makuhita and Asana to have deceived and manipulated him, and has resolved to gun the both of them down. This is a stark contrast to his usual attitude - against anyone else, he tends to warn them before a fight, or otherwise tries to solve things non-violently.

There's also going to be a writing guide that focuses more on character personalities than history, but that is under construction.
