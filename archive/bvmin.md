>Dawn was doing her homework in her room as usual, but this time the homework was winning
>” Who even used this crap?!? ugh!!” Dawn threw her hands in the air, the monsters know as arithmetic claimed another youngster soul
>Or so it seems at first glance
>Bargeing in her room, Sunny knew that such fault mouth was characteristic of her, however, his father's duties have to be fulfilled ”language!”
>Dad! i.. i am sorry" scratching the back of her head she continues "but this homework is sh--
>Raising an eyebrow, Sunny stares at the soon to be reprimanded potty mouther
>"-hhhhhhhhhtincks... yeah, that right! this homework stinks" Sunny's expression softened as her daughter reaped the rewards of her quick thinking
>She didn't let go, however, and ended up saying what she was supposed to think
>with a rapscallion smile that made his way to her face she snapped her fingers in a self-congratulatory manner "fuking nail it"
>"Are you testing your luck young lady?" Sunny crossed his arms
>"No, no, no, I meant aaaaaa... I got nothing, I frick up..." putting her palms together she pleaded "can you help me up, pretty please?"
>"Alright, but on one condition" he extended his pinky finger "no more profanities"
>Accepting the pinky promise Dawn said "i promise not to said any more profanities.... for today!"

>"Is a start" a playfully smile beamed from his face " what giving you problems buccaneer?" Sunny sat next to her
>"These multiplications are harder than the ones we usually do" lamented Dawn while circling 2 math problems
>Watching his daughter work her father quickly pointed out the problem "are you still adding up in multiplications? no wonders you are getting mad, you need to visualize it in your mind and used some tricks"
>"Hmm, like what?"
>Sunny got up and moved to the center of the room, kneeling in the spot "hop in general"
>Dawn accustomed to her father imaginary tomfoolery hopped right into her trusted steed
>"from the mountains, the evil gigants are attacking owr villages they are 7 monsters wide and 3 monsters deep, how many heroes we shall send to them aid?"
>Dawn rested her head in her father's scalp with her eyes close "mmm.... 21?"
>"atta girl!, you have won the battle but not the war" grabbing the homework Sunny read one of the circled problems
>"from the east, the nomadic horde approches! 15 groups of 20 horsearchers each"
>this piqued the girl curiosity "horses can used bows?"
>"nope, they have huge ballistas in they back like medieval tanks and flaming eyes"
>"COOL!!!" she started to think again "15x20......eeeeeee.....15+15....
>"15x20 is easy if you know that you can steal the zero without a problem" with his index finger he covered the 0 in the sheet "try to do in it now"
>"is 30, but that can't be it, can it?"
>"Right, but you see we can't just steal things you know? that pretty rude, so we just get the 0 back to the result and it gives us..."
>"300? let me check" pulling the calculator out of her pocket she quickly witnesses the power of experience "Woah, it totally works!!"

>Dawn mind was open to mathematical experimentation
>"So if 12x32 = to 10x32 + 2x32 then... 384!"
>"Okay, who the hell.." Sunny tries to cover his mouth but the damage was already done
>"Father! language!" Dawn mocking tone was only surpassed by her smug grin
>"D-don't tell your mother of I am not going to hear the end ofit in my lifetime"
>"Well, Well, Well, i am getting a new PC earlier it seems" her ego was already throwing a party in her honor but she clearly underestimated her dad
>Frowning his brow, Sunny used his trump card "i telling her that you dropped the F-bomb"
>"What! wait! if she grounds me I am going to miss my softball practices" racing against the clock she relented "geez,i get it! i am not telling... if you don't tell..."
>This time she was extending her pinky finger to him
>"I am not sure..." Sunny playful response was short lived as the sight of her daughter's puppy eyes pretty much force his hand "kidding, kidding! is a promise"
>"Fiu!... thank papa" she kissed the back of his head before Lolling in a half hug
>"Anytime sunbeam!" said with a proud smile
>in the window, the family man noticed how a car was parking in his garage
>"Looks like Mari is back from work..."
>"Yay, what are we waiting for? go horse go" she gently tapped her father side with her foot
>Sunny put both of his hands in his waist while looking up to his daughter with a amused exprecion
>"hehe... please?"
>"Much better" like a super low budge movie he started to make horse ride sound effect while leaving the room
>Mari was eventually delight to the dorky sight of the two of them
