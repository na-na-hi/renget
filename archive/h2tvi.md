## Macro Werewolf gf green

>have the sweetest gf
>tiny, slim little thing
>you prefer bigger girls, but she's your perfect match otherwise
>she's always in your corner, always has sage advice
>is pretty intense in the sack too
>she punches above her weight and loves it rough in bed, despite being ultra-sweet elsewhere
>conversely, she's had body image issues for a long time
>you've comforted her, telling her she's perfect the way she is
>life's great
>even up and through marriage
>a few months of marital bliss later, though, something changes
>your gf was attacked one night walking home from work
>bite marks on her shoulder from some sort of dog
>it's a city park, and while the cops concede the bite was clearly from an animal (and a big one at that) no sight or trace has been found since
>she makes a... staggeringly quick recovery
>within days, there's not even a scar
>other quirks come up too
>her sense of smell quickly becomes amazing
>and she's able to practically see in the dark
>you don't think much of it, but one night when you return to work, she's not around
>none of her colleagues have seen her since she left her workplace
>and you naturally panic
>especially when the next day, reports of a giant wolf litter the headlines
>but you're massively relieved when your wife returns home
>oddly she's wearing clothes you don't recognize
>and, again, the cops have evidence of this beast, but can't find it
>this goes on for a few months
>and you notice your wife becomes increasingly twitchy and panicky around... well, the same time each month
>it must be fear of being attacked
>she refuses to take time out of work though
>but after the last time, where one car was literally crushed by whatever this monster is, and another was thrown to block a street when cops caught the trail, you're adamant
>she's staying home on the full moon, and you've okayed it with her boss
>she's still panicked
>you're not sure why
>she bounces from manic energy to fits of feeling claustrophobic
>you hear a sound outside and open the curtain to look
>your wife pleads not to, but it's too late
>you witness a really big full moon
>and that's when you hear her grunt in pain
>you look at her as she clutches her body
>her normally brown eyes... they're yellow
>she runs off and hides in the bedroom
>you're still worried and manage to jam your foot in the door as she closes it
>you may have been ignorant up to this point, but there's no denying it now
>your wife yelps as her tits swell over a dozen sizes in seconds
>and her auburn hair hades to grey as it spreads down her neck
>her ears point up and move up to higher on her head
>her feet burst through her socks, nails turning to claws
>she seems to resign herself to her transformation into a werewolf, and everything accelerates
>her muzzle grows out, her teeth becoming sharp
>her thin body thickens out with both fur, fat and even some well padded muscle
>but the most shocking part is when she grows all over so fast, her head hits the ceiling and cracks it
>she falls onto her ass
>the whole room shakes
>but not as much as her absolutely gigantic rack
>a huge, fluffy tail shoots from above her spine as her body is now thoroughly covered in silky grey and white fur
>and her head hits the ceiling a second time
>as your wife pants from the change into a 25ft tall, ultra-curvy wolf girl
>she's beside herself with worry
>pleading not to panic
>and as you reassure her that you know it's still her, her pleading turns to embarrassment
>she's worried you'll hate how fat she feels
>or how huge she is
>regardless whether or not you have a fetish for wolf girls, it's your wife
>and that overrides everything
>you just lean a little harder on your love of bigger girls
>because she's the biggest one of all as you bury your head in her cavernous cleavage
>and you tell her it'll be just fine
