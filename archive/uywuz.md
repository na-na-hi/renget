Far from the sound of the surf, on the sandy fringes of an overcrowded parking lot, Suisei sat within her rental car wrapped in anxiety. The engine had been turned off for a while, leaving the air uncomfortable and stifling. Her hand curled tightly over the passenger door handle as she waited for a group of excited tourists to walk by.

“Whenever you’re ready,” Marine teased from the backseat.

Suisei took one last look around the lot, then swung open the door and stepped onto the blacktop. The heat sizzled against her bare soles. Three quick strides carried her off the parking lot and onto the sand, her arms crossed indignantly over her chest.

“Don’t forget the ice!” Marine called from the car with a wink. In her left hand was a curious little remote, hot pink and ovoid-shaped. Suisei still had no idea what that was for or why Marine kept hovering her finger over its button.

Suisei nodded stiffly and turned about to once again face the beach. The weather was as perfect as advertised– bright blue skies with only a buzzing biplane miles above cutting a thin white trail across the sky. The midday sun was strong but perfectly manageable if you could duck into the shade every now and then. Swarms of leisure seekers from all walks of life played volleyball, splashed in the surf, and lounged about on endless rows of colorful beach towels. Suisei hoped that everyone there would remain fully enraptured in their own small worlds until she got back to the car.

Suisei took a deep breath and forced herself to drop her arms. The ocean breeze brushed teasingly over her pale, flat, naked chest. Her nipples, soft and pink, sat fully exposed to the elements and the eyes of the world.

She tried to placate her quickening heartbeat. No matter how she framed it, the scenario was as absurd as it was humiliating; here she was, standing defiantly on the outskirts of a bustling public beach (in the city she lived in, no less) wearing nothing but a dark blue pair of boy’s swimming trunks. The swimwear came down to a little over her knees and was noticeably strained around the waistband where her impressive hips and meaty buttocks fought to burst free.

The shoddy disguise could obfuscate her sex from a distance, but from up close? When ordering the drinks? She shuddered at the inevitable confrontation, already visualizing the leering, the looks of disbelief and confusion. But there was no point standing there stewing in dread– and nowhere to go but forward.

With a dream-like quality, she swung her legs in front of each other and let her feet sink into the warm sand. Her gorgeous blue hair fluttered over her shoulders as she walked. Every movement of her body was examined under extreme internal scrutiny. *Act natural,* she thought to herself. *No one’s looking at you. You’re just another student looking to enjoy their day off.* 

But her mind and every rational instinct disagreed. She started second guessing her gait. Was it too short? Too long? Her pace in general was awkward, right? Her hands clenched and relaxed restlessly. Sweat ran down her neck and back. Suisei suddenly became very aware of the panicked breaths that had been spilling from her mouth. It was so loud in her ears, like someone else was breathing down her neck.

A volleyball slammed into the ground not two feet away and scattered sand onto her feet. Suisei’s heart nearly leapt to her throat.

“Hey! Sorry about that!” A young man waved at her from further down the beach where a pick-up game had been in its opening minutes. He caught up to her in seconds. “My friend sucks at serving, so–”

He awkwardly severed his apology and simply stared at Suisei’s body, as though she was some kind of optical illusion needing the right angle of light to figure out. For a moment he forgot how to speak, unconsciously tilting his head as he ran up and down Suisei’s curves, spending most of his time on the mosquito bites atop her tiny, brazenly exposed breasts. “Um…so yeah, c-can I have that back?” He pointed at the ball.

Through a plastic smile, Suisei nodded and tossed it over. Before she could escape, he stepped in front of her. His eyes were wide and curious. “Do I know you from somewhere?”

Her face grew hotter and she fought desperately not to cover her chest, knowing that would only further raise suspicion. “No, sorry. I’m visiting from out of town,” Suisei said curtly. She turned her eyes down and quickly strode away, feeling the boy’s eyes linger on her rear and back.

That horrid interaction confirmed what should have been obvious the moment she stepped out of her car; her body wasn’t fooling anyone. Anyone within speaking distance could see how her perfectly flat chest led to a slender waist, then flared out into overwhelmingly feminine hips. Anyone with eyes could watch her sizable ass bounce beneath those ill-fitted swim trunks as she strutted across the sand. In the naïve depths of her heart, she had hoped that the ruse could give onlookers a second thought, maybe enough of doubt for her to speed through the conversation, but feeling the boy’s unbroken stares drilling into her meaty thighs and ass dismissed that as pure delusional optimism.

A sudden strange pulse warmed her from the inside. Suisei briefly staggered, then caught herself. Another wave of throbbing pleasure slammed into her and forced a funny feeling between her thighs. Confused, Suisei’s mind flashed back to Marine, sitting in their car with that suspicious remote in her hand. *Of course.* A wireless vibrator. Suisei remembered seeing such a thing on Marine's laptop in the past (next to a bunch of other unsavory tabs), and that perverted pirate must have somehow…inserted it…last night while they were sharing a room. But out in public there was no way to tactfully remove it, so Suisei would have to carry on.

With the increased sensitivity simmering over her skin, every breeze across Suisei’s chest and legs drew a small whine. Even worse, to her immense embarrassment, she felt her nipples getting hard! She tried to discreetly press them down with her fingers, as though brushing a bit of sand off her chest, but the mere act of touching that area sent another twinge of degenerate, unwanted pleasure through her body.

A weathered face appeared at her side, close enough to feel their body heat. The intruder was a short, heavyset man with thinning hair. He looked at her quizzically. “You alright, miss?”

“Just…need to get out of the sun for a bit,” Suisei managed. Another moan threatened to leave her throat, so she clapped a hand over her mouth and hurried away. 

There was still much of the beach to travel and new faces kept pouring in. In her periphery, a group of college kids slowed their sprint to the ocean and turned their heads. One of them blatantly pointed to her chest. They were staring, nudging one another. They seemed to be smiling. Two more groups on her right. A couple with tanned skin and flashy bathing suits. A group of children enraptured by her appearance like they were watching an escaped zoo animal. Suisei focused only on what was ahead of her and blocked out the eyes, the whispers, the palpable judgment.

She desperately scanned the horizon, passing over the increasingly numerous beachgoers, until she happened across The Oasis. The squat white shack featured a single row of five wooden stools in front of the counter, the furthest of which was occupied by an older gentleman finishing a tall glass of rum and coke. Sprawled in front of the bar, a larger seating area with three long tables sat shaded beneath blue and yellow umbrellas that danced in the faint breeze.

Every one of those tables was fully occupied.

Twenty feet to the bar. She was so close! The density of the crowd grew to a near solid mass. People were closing in on all sides, stray arms and shoulders and hands brushed against her uncovered flesh. The general din of conversation grew louder as Suisei closed in on the shack.

After an eternity of swimming through the crowd, Suisei’s feet found the gritty wooden floorboards of the bar. The sudden hush washing over the patrons on her arrival was undeniable and the once boisterous bar fell into cryptic whispers. Suisei swore she heard her name amongst the chatter.

Her anxieties were well considered. Among the bar’s patrons was a woman who, as of last night, finished her fifth rewatch of Suisei’s latest performance. Suisei’s accomplishments had been an inspiration since highschool, and she had made up her mind to seriously pursue a musical career as a result. A table across from her seated one of the most dedicated Hoshiyomi in the city, boasting every piece of available merchandise and a stalwart watcher that had been with her from the very beginning. Both of them mulled over the impossible scenario playing out not ten feet away, and felt their high regard for their number one idol shatter noiselessly.

Suisei ignored the scalding judgment bearing down on her person and approached the counter. It was presided by an immense, barrel-chested slab of a man with a heavy bronze to his skin. His eyes were dark and beady and made no effort to hide their travels across the new customer's body. They found Suisei’s face, momentarily lost in her features, then traced down her swan-like neck and stared brashly at her exposed chest, watching her hardened nipples and A-cup breasts rise and fall as she struggled to manage her breath. His searching eyes dropped lower still and swept along her stomach and hips, noting the shallow bumps of her wide set hip bones peeking from over the waistband. 

Suisei felt all of this with almost tactical sensation, as though he had physically reached over the counter and roughly palmed her breasts.

“What can I get ya?” he said without moving his eyes. One hand rested on the counter and tapped idly.

Suisei’s first words were a choked gasp. She tried again, playing it off like she was clearing her throat and felt a stinging bead of sweat fall into her eye. Why was it so much hotter in the shade? “Can…can I get two-”

A warm flash of electricity forced a small mewl from Suisei’s throat. She instantly covered her mouth and once again pretended to cough into her hand. A useless gesture. The sensation returned, stronger this time, and Suisei unconsciously dove her hands to her crotch and rubbed her thick thighs together, as though she could simply smother out the sensation violating her body.

Back at the parking lot, Marine held up her binoculars and unleashed a devious smile as she turned the remote's dial towards the higher ranges. Her plump pussy lips were basically flossing with the front of her slingshot bikini as she worked her fingers inside. She panted and continued twisting the knob upwards, fantasizing that it was her own hand bringing the indomitable diva to her knees.

Suisei could no longer speak. She could barely *stand.* The sensations vibrating through her sex made her knees weak and she leaned against the counter to keep herself upright. Her hips pushed back and gave the silent onlookers an even better look at the incredible curves hidden beneath her swimsuit; the large, supple shape of her ass and breedable hips. A noticeable wet spot darkened the space between her thighs and something thin and clear seemed to drip down her right thigh. Her cheeks were red hot and burning in shame, rivers of sweat streaking down her face.

“Is there a problem?” the bartender asked with no genuine concern.

Suisei swallowed and managed to finish her request, “C-can I get…two lemonades, please?” She dropped 400 yen on the counter.

The man stared at her, watched her squirm, then snatched the coins. He turned around and got to work, the sound of the lemon machine mixing and juicing offered a quick reprieve to the deadly silence cast over the shack. Suisei tried to stand up straight with some resemblance of confidence. She shifted from one foot to the other, feeling the eyes behind her dancing across her svelte shoulder and back. Every male in a thirty foot radius was staring at her thick ass and trying to visualize how much she was truly packing behind that absurd getup.

Did it always take this long to juice lemons, Suisei thought. Was the bartender just trying to drag this out? Hurry up! *Hurry up!*

Finally the machine died down with a stuttering whirl. The man set both drinks down on the counter– tall glasses dripping with condensation. The ice cubes clinked together as the beverage settled and a ring of moisture already circled the base of the glasses.

“Th-thank…you…” Trembling, Suisei took both glasses in her hands and managed a half-bow as she turned away. Somehow, miraculously, she did it!

Marine turned the dial to max.

Suisei’s eyes went wide. A body wide surge of mind-melting pleasure detonated in her core. Her brilliant sapphire eyes went half-lidded and she grit her teeth in an obscene, perverted smile. 

“*Mmm…annnhh~!*”

In the middle of the bar, with dozens of patrons offering their unbroken attention, Suisei experienced the most violent climax of her life. The diva’s long-teased pussy gushed out a thick stream of clear love juices, instantly soaking the bottom of her trunks and cascading down the shapely pillars of her inner thighs. The obscene torrents of girlcum splashed audibly onto the floorboards and pooled around her feet, darkening the wood as it settled.

Her hands remained white-knuckled around the two glasses, unable to drop them as she released every social inhibition, surrendering however briefly to the intoxicating feeling between her thighs. Her mind was lost somewhere in a hazy warm bath of pure sexual gratification and another powerful orgasm rocked her body. Suisei’s legs shuddered as a waterfall of juices poured from her overworked cunt, messing the floorboards like an untrained bitch.

The crowd was stunned. No one spoke nor did they move. All anyone could hear was Suisei’s panting and the waves lapping softly at the beach.

With her body’s needs extinguished, reality came racing back with horrible clarity. Her mind a whirlwind of burning shame, Suisei piloted her shaky frame towards the parking lot and *ran*. Her legs felt weak and heavy. More than once she nearly tumbled into the earth when her strength completely ebbed out of her lower body. Behind her, a spattered trail of leaking girlcum marked the sand. No one stopped her on the way back, and most everyone she encountered gave her a much wider berth. There were whispers at her back. The word “slut” pierced her ears more than once.

Exhausted, she stumbled back of the parking lot.

“Yay! Good job!” Marine said as Suisei ripped open the car door and dove inside. She angrily shoved both glasses of lemonade into the cupholder.

Suisei curled up into the passenger seat, noting the incredible dampness between her thighs and slumped her burning forehead on the window. She could still clearly see the faces of everyone she sprinted past, their chastising words chasing her like hounds on the heel of a bleeding rabbit.

Marine giggled. “Oi, Suisei? Looks like you *really* enjoyed yourself out there!”

Choking back tears, Suisei glared behind her, “That was cruel of you, Marine. I followed through on my promise. Going out dressed like that was already awful…but to use such a thing,” She pointed at Marine’s remote, “just wasn’t fair. How…how was I supposed to control myself?”

“Eh..?” Marine said, cocking her eyebrow. She pulled aside her skimpy bikini and casually spread her pussy, retrieving the matching pink colored egg vibrator from her slit. It was still glistening with senchou’s juices. “What are you talking about? This was for me.”
