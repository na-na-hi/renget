##Part 1 - Sen Yamamoto
It was two weeks before the rest of Team Tsugumi would arrive - four weeks since Sen had begun scoping Konoha and the other Genin teams that would be participating in the Chūnin exams. It was a warm night, especially for someone from Shimogakure, the moon was out and the sky was an almost pitch blue. Konoha was asleep - as much as a shinobi village can be - the only sounds the chirping of nocturnal birds, heartfelt drunken goodbyes on the street below or barely audible rushes of air as night watchmen leaped into position across the tiled rooftops.

Sen carefully finished the calligraphy about the scroll - she wasn't any good with seals or rituals, but it was enough - the brush's motions were slow an deliberate, she couldn't afford even the slightest slip for this to work. Her desk was a mess of discarded scrolls and other trash - three earlier, failed attempts at creating the seal, a half-finished, cold box of ramen from the village, an ashtray containing a still-lit cigarette, a single kunai, a black/white mask and an unmarked, half-full container of small white pills.

Finally satisfied with the seal, the kunoichi placed the brush back into the inkwell and took the cigarette from its housing. Taking in a deep draw and exhaling, she added more to the fine layer of bitter smoke that hazed throughout the small hotel room she had been staying at, not even bothering to waft the acrid grey mist through the half-open window in front of her. She was in thought - the small poisonous stick in her mouth helped. After a moment of contemplation, she decided what would, and what wouldn't be needed in the scroll.

A quick string of signs followed - snake, rat, dragon, dog, tiger, bird - then she pressed her right fingers into the centre of the seal on the scroll. Her chakra flared and her brain races as literal thoughts channelled down her spine, into her arms, her hands, her fingers and eventually the paper. It was a relatively long but well-considered amount of information gathered on one of the Genin, Takeru Suzuki. She'd had trouble pinning the boy down - he was too fast and too spontaneous to track - and most of the memories flowing though her fingers were anecdotes taken from others as well as one awkwardly fast conversation with the boy from two days prior. The jutsu lasted a minute, longer than it needed to but the delicacy of the information meant she needed to be sure it was done absolutely correctly. She rolled up the scroll, sealed it with a coded mark and put it on the pile beneath her desk with the others - each bearing a different name.

The next was Takeru's teammate, Humari Miko - a medical genius that had, unfortunately, decided to be a ninja instead of a doctor. She'd considered pleading with the girl to change her avenue of employment, but hadn't - they were the same, in a sense, Sen should've been a librarian or a scholar, Lady Tsugumi and her mother had persistently reminded her as much, yet here she was, a Genin participating in this ridiculous competition to become a Chūnin.

%white% "She's going to be a problem,'" %% a familiar voice appeared from behind her - it was the voice of a younger girl, not entirely unlike Sen's.

The konuichi didn't break her stride as she dragged the last of her cigarette, putting it out in the ashtray as if to accentuate her response. %pink% "She's a child," %% another, final blow of smoke, %pink% "and besides, she's a healer, not a fighter." %% 

%white% "You're being too nice, you're always too nice," %% the other voice came gently closer, but without the sound of footsteps - its reflection was barely visible in the window's glass thanks to the haze. %white% "She's a Genin, a shinobi - worse, she's from Konoha - you think she hasn't been taught how to fight? What the best points are on a body to slow, to paralyze, to hurt... To kill?" %%

%pink% "You've seen how she acts, she's not a killer, not yet, maybe never." %%

%white% "Maybe not," %% another silent step, the reflection remains ghostly save for the feint outline of its white silhouette, rounded, hooded and cloaked, %white% "but she has all the answers to Ghidorah's poisons - you don't want him to feel useless, do you? After you and Junki spent so much time trying to give him self-worth, this girl could take it all way without even realizing. Without even knowing what he is..." %%

%pink% "A boy." %%

%white% "A monster." %%

%pink% "A boy!" %%

%white% "Will she see it that way? If he never gets a chance to prove it, she'll never care." %%

A moment of silence, Sen looks down the desk - the mask is missing, as expected, but the canister is there. She reaches for the canister and the pills inside. Her hand is stopped by a chilly grasp. The voice has moved in front of her now, perching on the desk with legs bent at the knees. Its form is hidden by the long, thick, white cloak - its face a black and white mask of porcelain texture. Two hollow eyeslits stare down at the konuichi.

%white% "We don't need to go there just yet, hear me out? I promise I'm trying to help this time." %% The figure doesn't move, doesn't even breathe as it speaks, but its voice is very real.

%pink% "If you think about hurting her-" %%

%white% "Not at all!" %% the young, girlish voice is far to sweet, far too innocent for the creature that still grasps at Sen's wrist. The stareoff lasts nearly a minute before she retracts her arm away from the medicine - the creature, sensing her response, withdraws its own gnarled, frostbidden limb back beneath the snow white cloak.

%white% "We both know where she lives - I've seen you mapping the house, the guards, their shifts, their faces. All I'm saying is we should go and take a look at her family's scrolls - they're bound to have something on that medicine of theirs locked up there. Nobody gets hurt, and you can give Ghidorah a way to prove himself without-" %%

%pink% "I can't, I'll be caught - if something happens to me they might take Junki and Ghidorah out of the exams, I can't do that to them." %%

%white% "You lack confidence - that's fine, like I said, I'm here to help. Just let me take care of it." %% The creature's gaze somehow feels warm, innocent, even helpful. It reaches up to the porcelain mask and slowly draws it away from the robe.

##Part 2 - The Snowclad Watcher
The Miko houses slept as they always did. Most of the family members had retreated to their rooms, the feint light of candles disappearing from behind paper walls one by one. Now the night was the domain of the black, held in check only by the dull light of the moon and the candles held by the shinobi and night-time servants that patrolled the walkways and inner corridors. Like any shinobi village, it was well-watched at night - watchmen, automatic seals, strategically placed alarm bells and even watchful bonded beasts were commonplace in the shinobi world - as a family of some renown, the Miko residences were watched even closer.

The masked, robed thing was an expert sneak, but even it knew that it couldn't slip past the dozens of eyes, jutsu and traps on that skill alone. Instead, it had conferred with Sen and had mapped out the place over days. The investigation was cautious, but thorough, and every day it got closer to the houses by mapping every face to every time-shift, every wall, every door, every bell, every seal, every animal. The investigation was far from complete - it'd take an Anbu a month to discover every secret passageway, hidden weapon and shrouded watchtower - but The Snowclad Watcher didn't need to know everything, just enough to get to the scroll room.

The creature pressed itself tightly against a stone wall as it listened - its other senses calming until it could hear its own heartbeat, then the heartbeat of those around the corner. Two Chūnin - not from the Miko Clan but often volunteering as night watchmen to fill in the empty nights - their shift was changing about now and, as usual, they were leaving early. The Watcher had three minutes before their replacements turned up, it reckoned, though such couldn't be guaranteed - it didn't have any mystical powers of foresight, it was just clever enough to guess.

A dash beneath a nest of watchful birds, a long climb over a wall to avoid a small pond of croaking frogs and a tight squeeze between raised floor foundations and a difficult climb up a wooden tower later and the thing found itself in the room it was looking for. This wasn't where the Miko kept their most secretive information, that place even Sen hadn't discovered - but it was an accessible repository - Sen had seen a young child and her elderly mentor collect a small stack of mundane-looking scrolls when she was last talking with Himari and had shared this information with The Watcher.

No candles were lit as the Watcher weaved the handsign of the bird - the dark parted to a monotone grey beneath its gaze, enough to distinguish detail but not colour and with little enough chakra to hopefully avoid the watch of any sensors in the area. Not a second went by before it began pilfering everything it could - most of the containers were sealed with physical lock or tag and it had neither the skill nor confidence to tackle them without adequate preparation. The loose scrolls would do. It took them, one at a time, opened them carefully to avoid any surprises and read them head to end in moments - it didn't need to think about the contents, it would remember. As expected, basics and minutia, not enough to even remotely guess at the secrets of the Miko clan, but it was a start.

%white% "Antidotes, antitoxins, anatomical charts, poison theory, extraction techniques..." %% the creature's breathless voice beamed as if through grinned lips, %white%"I told you Sen, Ghidorah doesn't stand a chance." %%

##Part 3 - Natsuo Uchiha
Natsuo was late, as usual - he expected another scolding from the other Jonin - calling him lazy, airheaded, telling him he couldn't tell the time from a clock. He knew they were joking, of course, just like they knew he'd never be late to anything really important. This time it was Sambu's turn to deal the cards, he didn't get to join in on the Jonin's gettogethers often - one of his Genin, Tomoki Tanaka, was allegedly quite a handful and had even tried to sneak into the game last month - at least he wouldn't know the tricks they'd figured out last time. 

Of course, last time nearly turned into a fight when they realized Kiko could *smell* the differences in the cards - Ezaki nearly blew a gasket on that one. The Uchiha smiled to himself as he plotted his next move, even as he walked down the cold night street - Genjutsu was forbidden and they'd caught him counting cards with the Sharingan ages ago, but he was pretty sure they'd all forgotten him in favour of the newly promoted Jonin they'd be hosting tonight - a Hyūga of all things, who even lets someone with a Byakugan into a card game?

That was until he saw it - what 'it,' even was he couldn't tell - but the Sharingan noticed the blur of white just enough to catch it. Whatever it was, it was moving too carefully to be a guard, was too big to be a bird and didn't have the normal colours of Konoha. %red% "Could be an Abnu. They've been busy since the other villages elected Konoha for the Chūnin exams."" %% the Uchiha stopped to consider his actions, the rat-at-at-at of his foot against the floor as he contemplated out loud. %red% "Besides, I've got to see what the new guy does at the game or else I'm going to fall behind again." %%

A shrug and a step, cool and uncaring - followed by a dejected sigh. %red% "If it is Anbu, they'll get mad at me for blowing their cover again. If it isn't..." %% the Jonin pressed his hands together and in a flash disappeared from all sight - much to the shocked, judgemental scoff of an elderly lady and the silent amazement of her grandson enjoying a walk in the night air. %blue% "Someday I want to be as cool as that guy, obaasan! %%

---

Another scroll, another read - take, memorize, put back in its place, take, memorize, put back in its place. %white% "Useless, useless, useless. At this rate I'll never live up to my promise, and you'll never live up to yours, Sen." %%

The creature stops and turns, a sudden feeling of being watched rushing up its spine. With one hand, it slips a kunai free from its holster, hidden beneath its cloak - with another, it forms a one-handed bird sign as chakra visibly flares into its eyes, the dark thin sockets beginning to burn with a feint blue. It scans the room and the rooms beyond, searching for chakra like a hunter looking for a small animal - fearless in all but anticipation. Gentle signatures returned from the scrolls and their seals, but nothing else. Satisfied, it turns back to the scrolls as the blue fire in its eyes extinguish - keeping the kunai in its hand, just in case.

%white% "You could always pull that girl in a little closer, make her hesitate when the time comes." %% the thing grins - more than a metaphor this time, the mask splits with a porcelain crack into a wide, welcoming smile. Sen's thoughts lance into its head with the force of a slap.

%pink% "Be quiet." %%

The thing's mask smiles wider, the gentle chipping rising to a loud rumbling crack like the splitting of a tree under tension. %white% "It's not like it wouldn't be the first time. Remember that other girl?." %%

%pink% "Be quiet!" %%

%white% "You told her she was safe, she needed to hear that. Anything to make her afraid of turning you in to those Kumogakure assassins. You were the only one left - well, you, Tsugumi and those children. But I distinctly remember that wasn't enough, you know what I remember..." %%

%pink% "Shut up!" %%

%white% "I remember that I tried to protect us. You were too nice, you wanted to let her go. We nearly got caught because you stopped me! You know how stupid that was!" %%

%pink% "..." %%

%white% "Nothing to say? Remember, Sen, I'm the one keeping you alive. You think I enjoy this? You think I enjoy remembering every night what we did, what we failed to do? If it weren't for me you'd be cowering in some library or rotting in some ditch. If it weren't-" %%

Too late, too distracted, the thing's arm was bound behind its back and a kunai pressed through the stark white robes into the spine. Not nearly deep enough to kill, but deep enough to hurt, deep enough to stain just a little of the cloth crimson.

%red% "You know, I don't often catch spies talking to themselves. I also don't usually find them raiding scrolls for children. Are you sure you're in the right place?" %%

Silence. Tension. Fear. The creature trembles a little in the Uchiha's hands as he scans the room with the Sharingan. No traps or seals - at least that shouldn't be there. The chakra level of the ninja he'd pinned wasn't very high, but she could be hiding it, his eyes were good but he wasn't a Hyūga or an Uzumaki, he was an Uchiha - and like any Uchiha his first thought was weapons and other immediate threats. She had a kunai, now dropped to the floor, that was one thing at least.

%white% "P-please help me-" %% a young girl's voice, trembling with terror came from the creature - far too young for the ninja he was holding. She was shorter than him, but she wasn't a child. He held his grip as his crimson orbs continued to dance, if this was a trick he wasn't going to fall for something so simple.

%white% "Th-that man, th-that Osamu. H-he has me in a Genjutsu, I-I c-can't stop or else I'll-" %% Natuso wasn't born yesterday, he'd seen comrades die to these sorts of traps before. Even if they were telling the truth - a thought that stopped him from finishing the job - he couldn't risk being caught out. Still, that Osamu was a shady character.

Natsuo thought on it for a moment, but a moment was enough. In trying to take everything in and watching unseen angles, he didn't register the one-handed sign fast enough to respond. The puff of smoke forced him on the back foot, immediately adopting a defensive stance and diving out of the room towards pre-checked cover, ready for whatever trap was sprung. The loud thud of a log hitting the floor told him everything he needed to know and - with a quick check from the Sharingan for Genjutsu or transformation - he ignored the clumsy substitution in favour of the environment. There were two exits from the household he'd mapped as he approached, the fast one and the quiet one - fortunately, he was fast enough to cover both.

%white% "You saw his eyes - Uchiha, Uchiha!" %% the thing silently shrieked in its own head, anticipation now fully turned to fear. %white% "Monster, monster! He'll kill us, he'll kill us!" %% The voice of Sen didn't respond. %white% "Abandoning me now? Now of all times!? If I get caught we're all dead - me, you, Junki, Ghidorah, we're all-" %%

Another interruption as a knee struck the Watcher's chest. Another prepared kunai knocked from the hand and an arm pinned against the wall. This time Natuso made sure there'd be no surprise jutsu, he took both of the thing's hands and, fingers interlocked, pressed them against the wall above her. If she could weave signs like that, it'd be the first time he'd heard of such. A knee to the side proved his hypothesis - like an animal cornered, the white-robed spy resorted to whatever taijutsu it had now that its hands were disabled. The knee struck a few times, it hurt a little through the reinforced jacket, but it wouldn't be any more than a bruise at worst.

%red% "Do that again and you won't like what happens next," %% the Uchiha's eyes bored into the slits of the mask, three tomoe became a single, patterned circle. He didn't need Genjutsu, not yet - if his suspicions were correct, this girl knew what those eyes meant, or at least enough to make the threat implicit. Her kicking stopped and her body slumped from the exertion - she spent a lot of her reserves on a mad dash away and evidently wasn't very good at it. %red% "Well, you seem to know me, or at least seem to know when you're beaten. Why don't you tell me what you were doing?" %%

%white% "U-Uchiha... Monster..." %%

He frowned as he pondered. Along the alleyway other shinobi were already stirring - flicking from the trees and rooftops to watch the commotion and, seeing their superior, leaping down to check the alleyways. %purple% "Natsuo Uchiha, sir! We've didn't notice the intruder - do you need any help? Are there others?" %% a Chūnin, one of three that made the first responders - fifty-six seconds, he thought, not as fast as he'd like but at least they're improving. It wouldn't be long before the Mika Jonin would arrive, he could already hear them sounding the alarm as they scrambled from their beds.

%red% "I don't think so. Form a perimeter, tell Lord Mika I caught an intruder on his grounds and am taking them for interrogation. Send a message to Ezaki Tuto - he'll be pissed, but he I'd rather have him checking the barriers, he's better at it than I am." %%

The thing thrashed in the Uchiha's grip at the word 'interrogation.'

%purple% "Yes sir! Do you want someone else to take the prisoner?" %%

%red% "No, I'll handle this." %% the Jonin's eyes turned back to the creature. Like avoiding an ambush on instinct alone it desperately tried to look away, but only took a single flash of eye contact. Second by second, the white-robed spy lost their strength and fell into a deep sleep.

##Part 4 - Kamiko Karatachi
The harsh electric white light was the only source of colour in the otherwise dull grey stone room. Sen Yamamoto had awoken in an uncomfortable chair, staring across a featureless wooden table towards a steel-clad door. The pain in her back and chest was the first thing she noticed, followed by the total lack of sound save the feint buzz of the bulb. She knew where she was, or at least she had an idea - despite the panic that gripped her she immediately fell back on her modus operandi. She moved her arms, they weren't chained.  She flexed her fingers, they weren't broken.

Bird - dragon - dog - rat - monkey - serpent - bird - release. She had little chakra left, she hadn't noticed until the last dregs of it started moving. It felt sluggish, slow, suppressed, like she'd expected - not enough of a barrier to stop all chakra flow just in case the interrogators needed to use jutsu, but enough to stop anyone from bringing the walls down. The walls were silent - no chakra escaped from them, she couldn't sense anyone or *anything* beyond the pale grey stone. They were sealed too, especially against Yin, all the better to neuter Sensor Types and stop them calling for help. A bead of sweat and a long gulp followed, but it was made worse once she noticed she wasn't in the room alone - he wasn't hidden very well, but she wasn't thinking very clearly either.

%red% "Already? You think fast." %% the Uchiha was invisible in the shadows beyond the feint glitter of two piercing orbs - the menace of the Sharingan had left them, but they pierced just as coldly. %red% "Yeah, the room's sealed. Even I can't do much in here, but in your case I think it's worse." %% He lifts himself from the wall and strolls into the light, bending downwards so the harsh glow of the bulb highlights his features. Sen recognized the face, Natsuo Uchiha, a Jonin of the Hidden Leaf with a storied history and - she presumed - an even longer hidden one.

%red% "Acting tough is a drag, so I'll do us both a favour and settle those questions you're thinking." %% pulling a seat with his leg, the Jonin sits opposite of Sen. He's in a vulnerable position this way, he knows as much, and he suspects she knows as well. %red% "You've been asleep for about six hours. We took the liberty of checking the hotels you were staying at. We found your papers, your hidden kit and..." %%

He reaches to his back and draws some items from a pouch, placing them on the table. An unadorned black and white porcelain mask and an equally mundane-looking scroll - though the gibberish seal atop is unmistakably one of hers. The Jonin looks far too relaxed as she eyes them, leaning back in his chair as nearly all seriousness leaves his posture - nearly all. %red% "I'll be honest, we weren't able to decipher the secret messages - yet - but we know these things burn up if you give the wrong key. The thing is..." %% the Uchina leans forward again, almost slumping on the table as he lets out a yawn, %red%"all the Chūnin I've rounded up so far? They're no good with that stuff - kids, you know? I do know a few who could crack those scrolls open no sweat in Anbu though, so I'll make you a deal. You tell me what you were doing and maybe I don't have to call those assholes to talk to you." %%

%white% "He's going to kill you himself." %% the signature snapping sound of the mask's maw opening into a grin resounds through the room, it smiles at Sen even from the table. Natsuo doesn't seem to notice - after all, how could he?

%white% "You could already be in his little playworld. Think about it, you know what those eyes can do. You've got us in deep now, Sen, what are you going to do about it?" %%

%pink% "Kamiko Karatachi." %%

The Uchiha raises a brow.

%pink% "I... I'd like to speak to Kamiko Karatachi. I'll admit everything to her." %%

%white% "What are you playing? He'll never fall for it." %%

%red% "You know she's not one of ours, right?" %%

%pink% "Kirigakure, yes. She has the best sensing in the village right now - she can tell if I'm lying better than you can and I trust her." %%

%red% "You trust her? I'm sorry if I hit you too hard but you're our prisoner, y'know? This isn't bonding time." %%

%white% "See? He wants you all to himself." %%

%pink% "You trust her too." %%

Silence reigns for half a minute. The Genin sits meekly - tired and afraid. Confusion then contemplation plays across Natsuo's face, until another dejected sigh leaves the Jonin.

%red% "Alright. You admit everything to Kamiko and tell her what you're up to and maybe I can see about telling Anbu it's all been handled." %%

---
%white% "You failed us again." %% Sen is alone with the mask now, the Watcher taunts her from its wooden pedestal on the table, its grin gently cracking along the face. This time, the smile isn't smooth, it's a jagged ugly thing. %white% "What's going to happen when Kamiko drags your confession out of you? You know she will, you know she can. She can see *everything*." %%

%pink% "She'll let us go." %%

%white% "Let you go!? After what you did!? You'll be lucky to be alive after this!" %%

%pink% "We didn't do anything wrong, we didn't-" %%

%white% "It's not like back home, idiot! Curiosity kills the cat out here! You learn one little thing about these barbarians' precious little clan secrets and they'll skin you alive!" %%

%pink% "They're not-" %%

%white% "And they'll not stop at you either! Tsugumi, maybe she's safe, but Ghidorah? Junki? They're *accomplices*. The Hokage will want their heads for this as repayment. Congratulations, oh great Sensor Type, you've got everyone killed! Again!" %%

%pink% "..." %%

%white% "Saying that, there is one way we can all get out of this happy. You want that, don't you? You want those two kids to become Chūnin, right? Well then they can't find them, they can't know, and they won't know if they can't ask you." %%

%pink% "What do you want?" %%

%white% "I want the same thing as you. I want to stop remembering every single mistake we've ever made. I want to stop waking up every night thinking about the times we've gotten friends killed. I want to get out. I want to get out! I want it to end!" %% the mask's face splits as it talks, the mouth transforming into a jagged maw of teeth as it rises from the table and stares into Sen's soul, cackling and shrieking as its mouth expands and contracts in a wicked gnash.

%white% "I want it to end!" %%

The kunoichi grasps her hair as she slams her head on the table, helpless tears staining the wood. It feels like it'll last forever until it suddenly stops. The voice disappears as the door steel door groans open. Through the portal a concerned-looking woman emerges. Kamiko Karatachi, Jonin of Kirigakure.
