    This is a list of collabs, complementary POVs and cameos done by Nerissa in the other Holomems channels. This will also include the 'Easter Eggs' like drawing streams. Any relatively brief mentions on streams (ie. less than 10 seconds) without any particular footage or appearance or even any appearance in a holomem chatroom without any interaction is not counted. Breakdowns or aftermaths of previous streams like offcollabs that she took part of will be counted. Any missing collab or cameo or any suggestions are also welcome, just let it be known in the thread as an answer to the OP and downright as a post in /ope/.

According to an anon in the general, that mention started when she apparently read chat after asking them to cheer her up and got into a comment that reads 'Nerissa likes you' - which is by itself a bit of aftermath to their interactions after Nerissa's debut. There's also a small aftermath with Suisei's reaction."

According to an anon in the general: "She says they have a lot in common when it comes to their tastes, and would like to Collab/sing with her. She didn't catch what she said about her beyond the fact that she has an IOSYS song, but was happy when chat told her that she likes her. Senchou really loves being loved, kek. Any member telling her she's her oshi will instantly become Senchou's pet. She also missed her reply on Twitter, so she didn't read Nerissa telling her that she loves her in there, so it was news to her."
