- KawaiSprite made a song specifically for the Kickstarter trailer, but PA rejected it and used Klaskii Romper instead
- Some of Kawai's original music is getting reused in Funkin', spefically for places where PA doesn't feel like waiting for new music. At least one known instance is the re-use of the instrumental for "GAY" by Kawai for an unspecific area (potentially a cutscene). GAY also might get a small extended version for Funkin'
- PA has a "plan" for announcing the new release date for the Darnell update
- PA wants the story of Funkin' to be riveting to "some degree"
- Barring any unreleased animations, PA's favorite poses and sprites are Tankman's "Heh, pretty good!" and the Week 7 game over screen with BF and GF
- Funkin' is planned to have reocurring musical motifs
- The open source license on what is and isn't allowed to be sold commercially will be much more explicit and clear
- There is a "logic" to how BF, GF and Pico sound outside of gameplay
- The animation of Pico shooting the cardboard cut-outs is not an in-game sprite
- Dave Strider was originally envisioned for Funkin', but is no longer considered due to the vision of the game changing
- The first thing PA did when coming to Canada was draw BF and GF fucking
- Funkin' is all but guaranteed to get an M-rating, mostly due to Tankman saying "cunt"
