- Dave is drawing animated icons for DD and MM but hasn't specified what they are exactly for.
Later in the stream, he draws an icon for Pico, Skid and Pump, Senpai, Tankman, Monster, Spirit and Darnell.

- Dave reiterates that Funkin' will be around the ~$20 price range when the FAG releases.
- The Kickstarter Portal made by Shingi was mostly created due to Kickstarter not having the infastructure/not caring enough to create surveys for the merch.
- Dave reiterates that the blog is for the team's thoughts and documentation on developing Funkin', not necessarily for sharing game assests.
- Dave knows what he wants Funkin' to be, but states that some of the choices made in Funkin' later down the line are inspired by mods and fan creations.
- Dave had the idea for ERECTS before B-Sides.
- Dave believes that Funkin' is not sinking into feature creep. He believes that the idea that the team wants to put in the game are realistic and reasonable. If anything, he believes that the only thing holding the team back is trying to understand how companies operate and trying to get it to all run smoothly.
- Dave doesn't know anything about community drama because he doesn't pay any attention to it, but he also wishes that people were just nicer to each other.
- The next update will apparently reveal where BF lives canonically in the Funkin' universe, but not explicitly (among the lines of a blink and you'll miss it type of easter egg).
- Dave states that when compared to back then when the update was supposed to release, the update is not "super different", but it is larger.
- Dave thinks that none of the 2020-2021 sprites have aged well, but he's going to fight the urge to re-do them for now.
He also states that after the update comes out, he'll re-examine them, but whether or not he'll ever potentially re-do the sprites is up in the air.
- The skin color of demons works like how it does in real life, and that they don't get to choose it.
- Dave states that if he ever made a Friday Night Funkin' movie, it would be about Boyfriend getting his foreskin back.
- Dave shows "Panty and Stocking" to the art team to direct them on how to draw Funkin'.
- Pico, Nene, and Darnell were sent to confirm Boyfriend's death during Week 7.
Dave still plans on finishing the comic for this.
- Dave stated that he'll change his profile picture on Twitter when the update is about to come out as a little "hint" towards its release.
- Dave states that he eventually wants Funkin' to end, and for him to move on from it when all is said and done, meaning no sequels, etc.
- Dave reiterates that Monster having a lemon head was just a thing that happened and wasn't mean to reference anything.

- KawaiSprite made a song specifically for the Kickstarter trailer, but PA rejected it and used Klaskii Romper instead
- Some of Kawai's original music is getting reused in Funkin', spefically for places where PA doesn't feel like waiting for new music. At least one known instance is the re-use of the instrumental for "GAY" by Kawai for an unspecific area (potentially a cutscene). GAY also might get a small extended version for Funkin'
- PA has a "plan" for announcing the new release date for the Darnell update
- PA wants the story of Funkin' to be riveting to "some degree"
- Barring any unreleased animations, PA's favorite poses and sprites are Tankman's "Heh, pretty good!" and the Week 7 game over screen with BF and GF
- Funkin' is planned to have reocurring musical motifs
- The open source license on what is and isn't allowed to be sold commercially will be much more explicit and clear
- There is a "logic" to how BF, GF and Pico sound outside of gameplay
- The animation of Pico shooting the cardboard cut-outs is not an in-game sprite
- Dave Strider was originally envisioned for Funkin', but is no longer considered due to the vision of the game changing
- The first thing PA did when coming to Canada was draw BF and GF fucking
- Funkin' is all but guaranteed to get an M-rating, mostly due to Tankman saying "cunt"
