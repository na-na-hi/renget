\>Couple of months ago all hell broke loose
\>Literally
\>Exploding skulls, towering beasts, floating mages and tech infused skeletons roamed Mars
\>You were minding your own business making sure the machines stayed on during a sandstorm when the commotion happened
\>You knew they were experimenting with some new type of energy that produced a ton of power
\>but you were an engineer
\>Not a researcher, guard or even a test subject
\>All of these guys knew what spooky shit happened behind closed doors 
\>Most of your colleagues were happy just building whatever tool or blueprint came to R&D
\>You were a bit too curious but no matter how much you flirted with the guards, pleaded to the scientist or sneaked trough the vents you never got any closer to finding what thet did
\>Surprisingly it came to you when a "short distance transportation device" you and the boys worked on created a portal to another dimension
\>The official story is that the device was tampered with, pouring soda on the motherboard or someones pet moth fried inside it
\>Real sci-fi stuff
\>But you think that it worked as intended
\>You have a friend that used to work as a researcher and he told you the safety measures they take before an experiment
\>That coupled with the confusing specifications when building it made it seem someone wanted this to happen
\>Doesn't matter now
\>You were scared out of your mind when a pack of slender demons came out of from a red light
\>They were as panicked as you were and started chucking fireballs around, scorching the equipment
\>One of them grazed your hand and you felt the heat radiating off it
\>Like a nice bonfire, cozy at a distance but that distance had to be respected
\>Still, a surprised yelp escaped you and you gained the entire packs attention
\>You said your last prayers and closed your eyes
\>As stated that was some months back but here you still stand, or sit if you're honest
\>That day is refered to as the Mars Rapture
\>Now what have this "Rapture" left for humanity
\>A fully functional settlement on mars built by its workers and the demons that invaded us
\>That's a harsh way to describe it
\>What they told us is that they felt an abundance of energy and, poof, they were here
\>If you had a gun in hand and suddenly were in an alien place you're sure you would also fire away
\>That's enough boring back story
\>What matters is the now you live in
\>And in that now you are working as a masseur
\>To be honest you are a part of the Integration and Trust staff as the physical trust expert
\>Wierd name but in essence you're a masseur
\>Not the most obvious promotion but you did say you had magic fingers to a ton of people
\>Guess you have to prove it now
\>The first client of the day is a relatively new arrival, an "Imp" that came here a month ago
\>You're not sure who started naming the demons but they stuck and the fact that the planet hasn't blown up yet proves the demons don't mind either
\>The Imp is sitting in one of the chairs in the waiting room, shaking uncontrollably and burying himself in the blue scarf around his neck
\>Imps and Hell Knights are the only demons that wear any clothing, owing to the fact that they fit
\>You can't see a Pinky or Baron having a t-shirt on
\>But they only wear one article of clothing so the rest of them lays bare for the world to see
\>maybe it's a cultural thing
\>After pondering the meaning of clothes for beings that arrived here naked you walk out to welcome your client
"Hello! I'm Anon and I will be your masseur for today"
\>You think you're the only one with how many they send to you
\>The imp hastily get's out of the chair and pulls down his scarf to speak
\>"Hi,IhopeIwon'tbetoomuchtroubleseeingasthisismyfirsttimeandallpleasetellmeifI'mdoingsomethignwrongIwouldhateittomessupyourjobbecouseIdidsomethingdumband..."
\>You lose track of what he his saying but you think you get the gist of it
\>As he continues his rambling you drag him into your office and ask him to hang his scarf on somewhere else
\>Slowly he takes off his scarf and looks around for somewhere to put it
\>He decides to hang it over your chair, a nice little decoration against the cheap, standardized office chair you have
\>The moment he lets go he covers his groin with his hands
\>You guess that even if he openly displayed his shame earlier he didn't feel as naked as he does now
"Good. If you're ready to start, please lay down on the table. Your head should face down against the floor"
\>He carefully walks over to the table, hands still obscuring his crotch, and sits down
\>With great hesitation he lays down and shows his back
\>But his arms are still under him
\>You tap his back and he flinches at the touch
\>You have his full attention at least
"Could you move your hands to the side of the table? I can't work if you have a wierd posture"
\>He follows your orders and gingerly removes his hands, letting them drop against the table's sides
\>Been a while since you've had a client this... jumpy you guess you can call it
\>You decide to start of simple with a back rub
\>As expected, the Imp tenses up once your hands land on his smooth back
\>You move then up and down his spine barely putting any pressure in it
\>He is as stiff as a rock
\>A distraction is at hand
\>While you continue to rub his back you ask him a question
"How do you like it here on mars?"
\>You stop your hands and let him think for a moment
\>Well, not really
\>You press your thumbs lightly into his shoulder blades and spin them in circles
\>"I'm not sure yet" he says grunting as you push a little harder
\>"There is a ton of new fun things here like... a guy showed me some cards with some cool monsters and dragons, said they were for a game of sorts, and he gave me some!"
\>You hum in approval as you move up to his shoulders, avoiding the spikes, and grab them softly
\>"A card game he called it! You buy them pla-ah-astic bags and, hng, the cards come in them"
\>You stifle a laugh as the Imp tries to explain what a TCG is but gets interrupted by his own grunts and moans
\>He is more relaxed now so you can get a proper feel for what lies under the skin
\>The muscles underneath are firm and small, well-trained but more fitting a swimmer than a bodybuilder
\>You can feel them bend to your fingers no problem as you untie any knots you find
\>Eventually you move your hands to his neck and circle the base of it
\>"You, mhm, seee! There, fuck, are several types of spells also" 
\>You had almost forgot the Imps explanation but with your focus back on it you realize it's not as detailed anymore
\>"Shinies mean nothing but they're cool" the Imp quickly finishes with a sigh
\>Feeling done with the neck and shoulders you move down to his back and try, once more, to push up and down his spine
\>No resistance
\>Lucky
\>You hear a sharp breath of air followed by a groan as the imp now is fully relaxed
\>You do your usual back routine but not as hard as you're used to
\>Your fingers practically dance over the knots and any you unknot makes you hear a mixture of a pleasurable cry, deep groan and a mild shriek
\>With the Imp now being as clay in your hands you decide to really dig deep
\>The muscles are not as firm down here
\>Maybe it's just that you're so good but you think he has just not jumped around as much as he should have
\>His lower back and sides holds a mild amount of fat, a little more than the usual imp but nothing unhealthy
\>You accidentally grace his ribs and the Imp giggles groggily, sensitive there
\>Pushing harder into them the demon lets out a throaty groan as you feel every one of his ribs
\>You press down on the base of his spine and do make arches with your hands
\>This is supposed to stretch out the muscles after you've bunched them up and it's a very "soft" move
\>You can't help but to smile as a happy humming reaches your ears and when you reach his spikes you swear you could hear a "oh yeah"
\>With that finished your hands moves down his sides and hits what you call the "hip handlebars"
\>Here the purple skin shifts over to the harder, more durable, brownish skin
\>And just underneath that is the "gluteus maximus"
\>Even if this demons has gained a little weight, the butt remained firm and round
\>Just for a moment you placed your hands on them, one hand for each cheek, and let them rest there
\>The Imp yelped at the touch and tensed up, letting you feel the globes tighten in your hands
"Ah sorry, I usually do the entire back for my clients. Would you rather I skip this part?"
\>He whimpered at the soft touch of your hands and debated himself if he should do it
\>Feeling you don't have the time this, you release the ass begrudgingly
\>Your hands trails down to his right tigh and you grab a hold of it
\>Feeling you had to put some power into this one, you started to knead the thigh, reaching deep inside the explosive muscle
\>The Imp seems happy with your choice as he loudly groans into the floor
\>If you could see his face you're sure he would have his tongue lolled out
\>You could tell since he became more vocal but it sounded like something hindered his speech
\>The thighs might not have been the biggest around, hell even a pinky has bigger ones, but the raw power that rested in them was something to be admired
\>You had seen imps scale a ten-story buildings like it was nothing and trusted these bad boys to land safely
\>You accidentally slapped the thigh when you thought about "bad boys" but luckily the imp doesn't seem to mind if the needy moan is to be trusted
\>You have heard a lot of wierd noises come from these creatures but that one had to be the cutest in a long time
\>Once the other thigh was done you patted him on the back and told him it was over
\>He barely pulled himself up
\>You think for a second that maybe you've overdone it but once you see the satisfied smile and calm, almost tired, eyes your doubts disappear
"That's your mandatory session over but feel free to book another time if you want one" you repeat surely for the thousandth time
\>The imp jumps down from the table and tries to say something but is distracted by something rigid dangling between his legs
\>As you both look down you see that the imps cock have hardened and is pointing almost straight up, it has a slight slant to the left
\>From the journal you got about demon muscle groups you could tell this one was on the bigger side of things, maybe a little thin compared to the length
\>You had no idea why it contains details about demon dick but you summed it up to scientist being scientists
\>For some reason most of demonkind had a penis similar to the human one
\>Made interspecies couples easier to manage but some deviate from the norm
\>The skin beneath his eyes became a deep purple and his mouth hanged open in shock
\>You quickly tried to calm him down
"Don't worry about that. It's a common side effect seeing as the blood flows stronger and I touched some sensitive areas"
\>As you finished the sentence you realized that the was Imp nowhere in sight
\>The sound of the automatic door closing itself says it all
\>You sigh and turn around, spotting the blue scarf on the chair
\>You think to yourself that whether he wants to or not the Imp has to see you again to get his scarf back
\>With that out of your mind you sit down, sign in that the first client was here, and look up who your next client is
