In this log, you'll see how the girls act when they want your spunk and what happens when you inevitable take action

>FWMC enters into heat every 6 months
>aggressive sniffing and play-biting, specially from Fuwawa who is constantly drooling and nibbling at your fingers for the slightest bit of possible sexual attention or huffing your crotch alongside her sister
>They are barely holding on, and commands with a firm voice create a stimulus. Stronger stimulus might even short-circuit their brains. Mococo wets herself and cant focus after a kiss
>Very fertile during heat. low rate outside of it
>Once mating starts, the twin that's left out will split her time in-between masturbating, biting, humping you while begging or servicing their twin.
>expect to end the session bleeding from scratches and bite marks. nothing serious. The twins will lick you from top to bottom. Yes. From Top To bottom, during and after.
>the two litters (2 from Fuwawa, 3 from Mococo) will constantly swarm you during playtime and require your attention. During feed time, only the one you will feed with the bottle will actually care about you
>The twins calm down during and after the pregnancy, but heat cycles need to be managed

>Shiori doesn't enter into heat. she can mate all year round
>Surprisingly active during her ovulation. Will let you know and actively seek sex
>surprisingly flexible, prefers long sessions to build up more chances.
>while sporting a lower egg count than her genmates, she compensates having good chances all year long
>Into pregnant sex
>will probably give birth to five children across six years
>very motherly, but next to no authority with her children and 0 housewife power. You are the only thing keeping the house from falling into total anarchy

>Nerissa lays eggs
>obscenely fertile, to the point that condoms are a must to avoid impregnation
>strong libido+ very receptive+ a complete bottom with no resistance= mating with her whenever, wherever.
>Gets extremely horny during egg-laying. Able to mate all year round
>Into breeding and degradation play, specially when her "weak pathetic eggs" are involved
>half a dozen eggs are the standard, fertilized or not.
>surprisingly great at being a mother and keeping order, but needy in private

>Bijou can go into a forced state of estrus due to excess of lust
>near 0% chances of conception outside of estrus. Guaranteed chance of conception while on heat
>excessive lust from her genmates starts storing into her gem, specially those that you neglect for a while. This includes herself
>will rather lock herself and masturbate than ask for help
>completely submissive during estrus
>Will probably give birth to three kids across five years. Very hard for her, but nothing risky
>great mother, despite her childish attitudes
