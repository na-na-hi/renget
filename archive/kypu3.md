>get lost in the forest and accidentally interrupt some primal ritual
What happens next?

***

>Walking in the forest for hours
>Can't find trail you were walking
>Feet hurt
>Clothes dirty
>Phone dead
>Sun setting
>Getting cold
>Thinking to yourself that you're going to die out there and nobody will ever find you
>It's pitch black out now, with the only light being the inconsistent glow of the full moon as it's periodically revealed and obscured by clouds
>Surrounded by the subtle cacophony of unseen nocturnal fauna
>Hear noise off in the distance
>Dancing and drums, the sounds of revelry
>Go to noise, as you approach you see orange light flicker through the treeline
>Peering through the branches into a clearing, you see what appears to be a group of wolf people dancing around a fire in some sort of pagan ritual
>Suddenly one turns her head to look at you, and the rest almost immediately follow
>An crowd of reflective predatory eyes silently staring you down
>If you had any doubts about dying tonight before, now you were sure

>"Interrupted? No, you're the guest of honor!"
>"The gods foretold of the arrival of a furless one, guided by the light of the moon and stars to us... an outsider who is to be celebrated and allowed to join our pack."
>"You are free to choose one of our women to join with your spirit as a lifemate, and to consummate your bond with her here, in the glow of the blessed moon and our revelry."
Umm... wwyd?

>Lost in the woods.
>No gear. No phone. No nothing.
>Don't even know how you got here.
>Moving because no gear, no phone, no nothing and it's getting colder than you're dressed for.
>Only real hope is to find rescue.
>Fortunate enough that there is a full moon to see by tonight.
>Walking for who knows how long now, haven't even seen an indication of high ground to get to in order to find bearings of some sort.
>Catch sight of odd light up ahead.
>Seems like a good thing, lights in the woods tend to mean people.
>Foliage and undergrowth get denser as you approach the light, almost as if the plants want to keep you away.
>Break through the green wall into a clearing.
>You see something you've never seen before, and the lizard brain releases a flood of fear that threatens to turn your legs into water.

>Dancing amber and green light illuminate the creature in the center of the clearing.
>She's at least seven feet tall, maybe eight.
>Why on Earth are you noticing the breasts? Especially when there are flaming antlers with eyes?
>You're really really hoping the markings are ocher.
>Even if your watery legs weren't keeping you from running her piercing gaze would have you pinned to the spot.
>Not like running would matter. You're sure of that.
>She's in the middle of something. There's something that looks ceremonial and half finished drawn on a slab of exposed rock.
>Instinct is enough to tell you this is important and you're interrupting.
>Your rational mind manages to wrangle your lizard brain and your next choices are made by a thinking mind, even though the fear is still screaming just underneath.
>Without sudden movement you sit down.
>You look away, close your eyes, going as far as to cover them with your hands to show you did not mean to spy.
>You crane your head to the side, exposing the entire length of your neck in a sign of submission that you hope will be interpreted as meaning you want/mean no trouble.

>Pregnant silence draws out long and sharp like the blade of a knife hanging in the air.
>Then there's an explosion of sound, and before you can possibly react there's the feeling of teeth at your neck and hot breath on your skin.
>If you'd had even a moment you'd have probably pissed yourself, at the very least.
>The fear finds new claws and tries to tear through your reason, to make you get up and run.
>Reason points out it's too late and if she wanted you dead she'd just close her jaws.
>You should have flinched, would have flinched, but she was on top of you so fast you didn't get the chance to do even that.
>Reason keeps you still even as that hot breath is drawn in and out of inhuman lungs and over your neck.
>She growls.
>Yet you remain still, your only response an involuntary whimper.
>Then the teeth are gone.
>And a voice is in your head.
>No, not a voice. It is a presense communicating meaning simply by being there.
> |You do not belong here|
>"I know. I'm sorry. I don't even know how I got here. I just want to go home."
> |You do not know?|
> "No. Please, I have no idea what's going on. I don't even remember where I was before this or how I could have gotten here."
> |Then go home|
> You feel a sharp point on your forehead, and then you're falling a thousand feet.
> Only to spasm awake in your bed, sheets soaked in sweat.
> It takes a minute for your breathing to calm and your heart to stop trying to escape your chest.
> Bundle up the bed linens, trying to figure out what THAT was all about.
> Throw linens in the wash.
> Go to bathroom to piss.
> Catch sight of yourself in the mirror.
> There's a dot of ocher in the center of your forehead.
