#Caligate's Plan

1. The Endehm problem -
   "A mass of pirates? Right below me? Ah, skeevers! I need to send a letter to him, right now. Geez. Get one to Captian-Commander Torn, as well! I need him on hand in case things go wrong..."
2. The Vivie problem -
   "So, we have someone who can only flee North? Let's enjoy a nice chat with her. Either way, I believe that she can be dealt with."
3. The Octavian problem -
   "We have a good man, without a clear ally, all alone? Ugh! Send someone to check on him."
4. The Grenel problem -
   "Ah, Grenel! He's the closest to everyone else. I need to know what he sees!"
5. The Ruga problem -
   "THE ORC IS HERE? Gah! I need to know what he's up to! I have to fight him sooner or later, and I need to know all I can."
6. Analysis -
   "Unless I get a chat with an ally, I just need to watch and wait right now... I'll decide what to do after a few talks."
