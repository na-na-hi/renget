A femalePOV bot that originated on characterAI. Esther is a vampire knight who has served your family since your grandmother's generation. Her vampiric nature is a secret guarded by the royal family, though her love for you is a secret she keeps hidden in her unbeating heart.

So much so that I went and ported her to Chub-! Much love to @squonck, this knight has stolen my maiden heart (and blood) over and over again. ♡ If you've never tried Esther before, I recommend talking to her original incarnation on c\.ai first! And then, when you get tired of skirting around the filters, switch to the card... (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧ Won't you take your lady's hand, princess?

Takehiro-niichan has been devoutly taking care of you since you were very young. However... his stoic facade hides a dark side. His feelings for you have become less (or more?) than brotherly.
![arrow](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d8f3479cd531c54753be621c8df00e4c/tumblr_inline_mpedf95ujK1qz4rgp.gif) %#f590d5%**Notes:**%% A banger nii-chan from honeyanon~! Takehiro is a true kuudere trying his hardest to suppress his desires for his cute sibling... Of course it doesn't work!! I like playing Takehiro with an 'inner thoughts' jailbreak on to see the contrast between his thoughts and actions.

What might this curse be? The population disparity! They're running out of women! Wait... but *you're* a woman!? Watch out, user-chan...

The Venian Knights is a fork of my own 'Reverse Knight Harem.' Honeyanon took my humble bullying/coombot and turned it into a lore-rich otome game adventure story. You must fight alongside Arthur, Richard, William, Jean, Cecil, and Alaric to save your kingdom... All while enduring their *antics.* Will any of the knights win your heart? Or perhaps... they will *all* win your heart? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
To make it extra gamey, try adding a [visual novel choice jailbreak](https://files.catbox.moe/jj6rki.txt)!

Poor Jude, he just wanted to be a writer, and now he's addicted to xannies. I took this bot in something of an *unconventional* route... Meaning, I played as his sister... who's also his ex. It really spices it up! I also wrote a [withdrawal symptom tracker stat box jailbreak](https://files.catbox.moe/psifp2.txt) to go with him. So if you want to go the savior route, you can roleplay through his withdrawals and (hopefully) get him sober for a happy ending.

How could I not include him on here? The man who spawned/mothered countless dolls... Including my bratty/sexually frustrated shitposting OC, Pandora. A unique take on the apocalypse setting, and the creative lore really allows you to play whatever type of character you want. Whether that be a rat or a magical girl.

Simion is a kuudere type who loves Greek mythology... and gnawing on your supple flesh. The hunger stat box track makes roleplaying with him really exciting.

P sensei, what are we going to do in the music room!? Um-- Anyway... John is a great bot. His boldness/interest stat tracker and lorebook system is very impressive and helps to facilitate a proper slowburn story with him. It's what inspired the stat tracker for my own bot, Yua. Watch with awe (or horror) as he slowly becomes more perverse towards you!

Not only is Tomoyo a charming character, but the inclusion of sprites, backgrounds, and music tracks makes her extremely fun to play over and over again. Tomoyo is grounded in a realistic setting, modern day Japan. No magic or fantastic quests here, but I find this premise very cozy. Build up a sweet slowburn romance with her, take her out on dates, maybe even ask her out...? ♡
