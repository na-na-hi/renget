# /SCG/ - Star Citizen Info & Resources
!!! note Updated as of Patch 3.21.1
***
!!! note If you are new to star citizen, check out this [Introduction & Overview](https://rentry.org/guier/) on the game
!!! note I'm active on the /vm/ thread, so feel free to point out useful resources you wish to be added here or if something is outdated, links are broken, or wrong.
!!! warning Shop data is no longer available in the games files as of 3.20, so websites like https://finder.cstone.space/, https://uexcorp.space/, and https://www.erkul.games/ (dps calculator works fine) have to resort to manually updating it themselves for the time being. Expect outdated pricing information from these websites going forward early after a patch drops.

!!! note Since each testing channel requires you to have multiple instances of the game installed on your PC, it can take up a lot of storage space. There are a few different tricks you can do to save space while swapping between these different environments.
- [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/17lt803/howto_use_symbolic_links_to_install_multiple/)/[Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVMiT7AAGP8) will guide you on how to create symbolic links in Windows to have all the test environments in 1 folder and freely swap between them.
- In the `"Starcitizen"` folder that's located in the `"C:\Program Files\RobertsSpaceIndustries"` path by default, make a new folder, and name it `PTU`/`EPTU`/`TECH-PREVIEW`, then copy the contents from the `"LIVE"` folder into that new folder you just made, and the launcher will only download the update.
- You can also just change the name of the 1 folder to either `LIVE`/`PTU`/`EPTU`/`TECH-PREVIEW`, depending on the environment in which you wish to play.
