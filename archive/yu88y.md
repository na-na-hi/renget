A Bond of Blood and Sin. Ch. 1.

~*~

The man Omaru Polka loved the most had always been her older brother. The strongest, the most handsome man, the kindest of them all! Always coming to her rescue, always giving her uppies when she wanted to, buying her candy, tucking her in bed, scolding her bullies…

Oh, she loved him so much, *so, so much.*

And her brother loved her too! Anon always offered himself to bathe his little sister, he gave her funny kisses that made her feel strangely good...

There isn’t another man like him in the entire world, not another one for her either. She was set on it, she would marry her brother when she was old enough! She'd have a dozen kids with him, too. 

As of late, he's been awfully secretive. Mama said that Anon spent time in his room doing ‘boy stuff’ and that she shouldn’t bother him while he did so.

But as rebellious as kids are, mama’s advice fell on deaf ears, and she'd spy on him with a glass stuck to her wall, hearing his labored pants and moans that sowed an impossible curiosity on the little fennec. Was he working out? 

~*~

Today, as she played with her barbies in her room, her mother went out shopping.

“Poru! Anon!” Her mom yells from the entrance. “I’m going to buy something for lunch, I’ll be back in a minute!”

“Kay!” Polka yells back. 

Now she gets some time alone with her beloved brother! And oh, she knows what that means. She a glass of juice from her nightstand, she downs in it one go, letting out a satisfied puff, and then sticks it to the wall to hear Anon.

*thump thump thump*

Now that mom isn't here to scold her, she can finally see for herself what it was that her brother did every day.

In her tippy toes, she sneaks through the hallway and stands before his door, her fluffy fennec ears hear for any signs of life. Anon’s bed is creaking, and Polka feels herself get worked up. The thrill, the mystery! 

And she barges in! Anon pulls his pants up in a flash and throws something in the space between the bed and the wall. 

“Polka! You’re supposed to knock!” He yells.

Polka grins as she enters the room, closing the door behind her, Anon is visibly miffed for her intrusion. 

“What you need?” He asks sternly.

“Mom’s out.” Polka says bluntly.

“So?”

Polka's face turns red with a bright blush.

“Kissies!” Stretching her arms out to him, Polka smiles.

Anon’s eyes close in pain, and then he lets out a tired, shameful sigh. He seemed lost in thought for a second before he picks up his sister brings her on top of the bed.

“Anon! Do the slide again!”

“Okay…” He says as he places the giggling fennec on top of his knee, then lifts it in the air as Polka slides down to his pelvis.

“Hehehe~!” Polka smirks. Her brother didn’t know it, but Polka liked it when his thigh rubbed against her…

And Anon does it again, causing Polka to moan.

“Sorry! That hurt?” He spurts out.

“Nnoo…!” Polka smiles as she lines her head with her brother’s, and plants a little peck on his lips. Polka gives Anon a bright smile that shines in contrast to his dreadful eyes.

“Okay, there’s your kissy.” Anon grunts, his hands try to pick up Polka and get her down, but Polka fights back.

“No! I said kissies!”

“Poru…”

“Please?” Her ears droop down. Dammit, she’s impossible to resist. And she knows it, too.

“Okay…”

Polka grins.

“Mwah, mwah, mwah!” She kisses her brother, uncaring for the noise. No one's around to interrupt them, after all.

Anon reciprocated his sister’s kisses as dully as possible, what once was meant to be kissing practice for when he got a proper girlfriend, turned into a game that Polka always wanted to play when their parents were out. As his lips mindlessly kissed his sister’s, Polka sensually biter his lower lip, causing Anon’s hair’s to stand up in shock.

“Poru?!” 

Polka lets go of his lip as she smugly smirks, her tiny purple eyes giving Anon a look of superiority.

“Where did you learn to do that?” He asks her in a panic.

“Mama does it to papa.”

“Ha…” Well, better to learn it that way than from a pervert…

A pervert…

A tent is pitched in Anon’s pants. His crotch was still sensitive, and ever so horny since before Polka barged in. It doesn't help that Polka's hips are rubbing on him too. He sucks air through his teeth, causing Polka to look at his strange expression with curiosity in her eyes. 

"Anon?" She says as she brings herself up and sits on top of his penis. Her soft butt rubs him out of his senses. His hands get a hold of Polka's thighs, and she jumps as his touch. Ever so slightly, he rocks her in place...

A horrible idea crosses his mind, flashing him with all of its obscenity and derangement. A pubescent boy is a festering mess of horniness, and anything that feeds it corrupts him… 

Before he could stop himself, his thumb digs into Polka’s pants.

“A-Anon…?” Polka squirms, but does nothing to remove his hand from her pants.

Mom’s going to be back in any second, this is a terrible idea in a million different senses…

“P-Poru…” Anon says.

*“Want to play a more ‘grown up’ game?”*

~*~

You feel something pulling on you gently, then it gets a bit rougher, your half-asleep body barely musters enough energy to care. Whatever it is it can wait... you're... you're about to fight some bad guys in your dream...

“Anon! Psst! Anon!” Someone mutters.

“Hnngng…” You grunt.

“Anon!”

You ignore the voice of whoever it was. It’s Saturday tomorrow- Eh, today, no one has the right to wake you up for school…

You hear a sigh, and then a deep breath.

“Anon Anon Anon Anon Anon Anon Anon Ano-!” 

“Guh…. what?!” You finally turn around.

“Shh!” 

It’s Polka, your little sister, you can tell because of her familiar presence, and her tiny soft hands grabbing your arm. 

“Poru? W-What time is it…?” 

Whatever it was, it was dark as pitch, and not a sound could be heard in the house other than the clocks in the hallways. Fall’s cold climate makes its move on your body as soon as your back is lifted from the covers. Her presence on the room had terrible implications. In hope, you wished she woke you up for something mundane, like being too scared to go to the bathroom. But you knew.

You knew.

“Anon.”

“What? A bad dream? You feel sick?” A brotherly tone spoke in defiance, feigning innocence in the face of a kid.

“No, no, no, no. I wanna do it.”

“Huh?”

“You know, the game we play…!”

Oh, so it was that...

“Nah, I can’t.” You spoke and turned around, hoping to fall asleep there and then to get out of this situation. Despite your head feeling heavy, you know that you aren't going to be able to sleep tonight.

“Why…?” Polka pouts.

“It’s… it’s too late.” You cover yourself with you blankets, hoping to hide away.

“Anon, pretty please? I-I’ll let you use my bike if you play with me!”

“No, I don’t want your bike, go back to bed.”

“Pleeeease? My legs are tingly again...”

“Do it yourself, then.”

“Nu-uh! I want you to do it.”

God dammit, she won’t let you live it down. Why does she insist on doing it so much?!

Despite the feeling of guilt crawling inside of your skin like spiders, Polka was as energetic as ever, and eager as she always was to play with you. The sharpest dagger driven inside of you, was her innocence. To her, it was a mere game. Just a game between siblings. 

“Okay, okay, but this is the last time.” You succumb to her pleas, lest she would tell your mother about it.

“Yay!” She celebrates quietly, with the pure joy of a kid.

God, please at least let you forget that she was barely in first grade.

Polka joined you in your bed and you sat atop your shins, feeling your sister’s body align itself with yours, seeing your own sin before your eyes in complete darkness.

You sigh. The sooner you get this over with, the sooner you’ll… you’ll what? Whatever your plan was, it sure as fuck counted on Polka getting a sudden case of amnesia regarding everything that had happened.

Polka lifts her legs up in the air. You get a feel of her clothes and notice little flairs at the bottom of her shirt. You know this shirt, it’s her strawberry pajamas, you bought it for her with your allowance.

Just get it over with.

Slipping your fingers inside her pants, you pull them up slowly.

“My undies too.” Polka whispers into the night.

“R-Right.”

In a second motion, you pull them up too. In a little flash of car light passing by your window, you notice a string of Polka’s love juice still connected to her underwear before it fades again into the darkness. You lick your lips, and mentally slap yourself.

After her bottom clothing was gone, Polka lifted her butt up in the air and reached your face with her feet, which then rested on top of your shoulders. She’s thin, thin like a twig, and her legs feel as smooth as the rest of her body.

With that, you lower yourself towards her crotch, and you begin giving her kisses on her stomach, right above her honeypot. Polka lets her waist fall atop of the bed, and you feel her legs shifting in expectation. But you’re staying here, kissing her tummy. Hopefully with this, she’ll-

“Lower, lower.” She commands as her tiny hand touches your head and points towards her groin.

“Hnng…”

“It’s the bestest place there!”

After a deep breath, you give her kisses right on her tiny cunny. Polka squirms around you and her legs twitch on top of your back. Her feet tap on it up and down.

“Ehehehe!” She giggles as quietly as she can.

Please…

“Anon.” She whispers. “Lick it too, please.”

“No.”

“Why?”

“Because you’re stinky.” You spurt out, hoping to discourage her.

“I’m not stinky! I bathe!” She says as she lifts her bottom off the bed and sticks her crotch in your face. 

“See?” She mutters. “It’s clean!”

Whatever…

Using your thumbs you spread her apart and your tongue digs itself into your little sister’s pussy. It’s so smooth, so impossibly smooth and gross for the soul. 

“Ehahaha…!” Polka giggles again.

You suck on her clit as well. You’ve gone this far already, so…

“Mmmng!” Polka groans, her hands pull on your hair.

“Sorry, too rough?”

“No, no, keep going.”

And so, as you lower your head again, Polka squishes you with her legs, both her thighs and her shins around your head.

“What?” You ask her.

“Wait, I want you to feel good too.”

“I don’t need to.”

“Come on, you didn’t get to last time.”

“I don’t want to…” You lie. You can’t pretend your pajamas weren’t stained, you just don’t want to give in anymore…

You sigh. Polka locks your head in place with her legs.

“I can’t get up if you hold me like that.” You tell her.

And she lets go.

You admire the nightmare that lay in front of you. Your sister, your little Polka, why did it come to this? You’re a monster, a fucking monster.

And after that, you bring your pants just under your testicles. Are those… Are you feeling pubes in your crotch? That helps distract you from the fact that you’re about to masturbate with your sister…

Time to get this over with.

You line your cock’s head with Polka’s garden, and rub it on top of her clit as her lips kiss it sideways.

“Put it in.” Polka commands.

“No.”

“Why not?!” She fumes.

“Because it’s too big, I’ll hurt you.”

“I don’t care if it hurts.”

“But I do.”

“Hmpf…!” She pouts.

“Poru, don’t give me that.”

Oh good, your dick is starting to feel really, really good. Polka’s cunny has lubed up surprisingly…

“Ah…” You moan, flesh on flesh feels so good.

“Anon.”

“No.”

“But…”

“Another but.” You cut her off. “And you go back to your room.” Your hips thrust faster.

“Hm…” She whimpers.

“Gah…” Dammit, those sounds she makes… This isn’t a little girl, it’s a devil that knows exactly how to pull your heartstrings!

“Listen.” You speak as you rub faster and faster.

“Y-Yeah?” Polka speaks between pants.

“When you grow up, we’ll go all the way, alright?”

“Really?!” She gasps.

“Shh!” You reproach her. Polka brings both of her hands to her mouth. “Yeah, yeah, but only when you grow up.”

“To what age?”

“Older.”

“But which one?”

“I’ll tell you when… when you’re ready.”

Your dick is being covered in her love juice, your thumb feels its sticky goodness.

“Huf…” You groan. “Lift your shirt, Poru.”

“Hehe, are you gonna shoot it on my tummy?”

“God… yeah, I’m gonna cum…! Ahh!” You grunt as quietly as possible as your semen flies from your dick across Polka’s body, landing on her stomach, her chest, and some of it on her cheek.

“Ehh!” Polka giggles.

“Okay, okay… Don’t yelp..” You ask of her while you finish cumming.

“It’s hot~!” Polka murmurs.

“Hold on.”

You reach for your bedside drawer and frantically search for your wipes, but groping around from this distance doesn’t precisely help you. 

“Ugh, bitter.” Polka groans.

After a sigh, you get up and turn on your lamp. The wipes were there, just in the very back of the drawer.

And then, you turn around and see Polka sucking her finger while she looks at you with cum on her face, her tits, her pink pajamas, and her stomach, glistening under the lamp's light, and giving you a genuine smile of satisfaction.

Post-nut clarity sets in gently, if gently was the whap of a steel bat right into your cranium.

This can’t go on... You mustn't let it go on. 

“Stay still, I don’t want it to drip.” You tell Polka as you clean her body. She obediently stays still as your hands wipe away your cum, and yet, you can’t shake off the feeling of filth.

“Anon.”

“Yeah?”

“Can I sleep in your bed tonight?”

No, absolutely not.

“...okay.” You say.

The years went by.

Polka’s pen wrote in her diary.

*My brother hated me after that night. He was mean, he refused me, he wouldn’t even look at me. But why? Didn’t he love me? That’s why he did those things with me, right?*

*I tried to get his attention, I stood outside his room as he loitered in bed, pestering him with my presence, I sat beside him in bed and tried to catch his attention to no avail. He would walk home from school with me in silence, he wouldn’t play with me…*

*I tried craftier methods to get to him. Anything for my brother.*

*I wore no panties around him and would stick close to him when no one else was around. I would pull on his clothes and after I had his attention, I’d tell him to follow me to an empty room, and I knew he liked it, or else he would’ve refused.*

*I’d make sure he could see *everything* as I pulled my dresses up, or my pants down. I bent over, I spread my buttocks apart, I would ambush him on the halls with my shirt pulled above my breasts, but after that, he would just walk away in a haste and lock himself in his room, and I got so sad, so sad thinking I had gone too far and that he was mad at me. I’d stand before his door and knock multiple times, ‘Anon? Anon? I’m sorry…’ I’d beckon him to no avail. After a while, he’d open the door and kneel in front of me with tears in his eyes, saying that he was sorry, that he was a terrible brother…*

*I kind of liked seeing him like that, so weak and vulnerable. It was one of the times he paid attention to me, but it still hurt to see my brother cry, so I’d hug him, I’d kiss him and brush away his tears, I told him that it was okay, that he didn’t do anything wrong.*

*But that didn’t sate my thirst, no, I needed him. Not once did I bring up the fact that he made it a promise to me to fuck me, but I couldn’t live on fantasy alone.*

*I humped my plushies thinking of him. I used the corner of one of my table to relieve myself, I stood outside his door at night, hoping to hear his bed bump on the wall while he jacked off just to get a glimpse of him. I think I spent all of school just masturbating.*

*Time went on, our parents divorced, and now he lives with our da-*

“Polka!” Her mother beckoned her outside her room.

“Ugh… yes mom?” She yells back, as her hands quickly slides outside of her crotch, wet with her love juice.

“I have great news! Guess what!” Her mom speaks.

“What…?” Polka sulks, unable to feign enthusiasm.

“Your brother’s coming to visit for the weekend!”

And suddenly, upon hearing those words, Polka’s world regained color, and everything seemed to be a pretty and bubbly pink and blue. Her brother, her beloved brother’s coming back! Anon’s coming back! Oh god, please have him stay here *forever*.

She has to shower! She has to make his room! She has to do so many things!

And one of them in particular, she *has* to take him for herself. She’s waited her whole life for Anon to make her his woman!

In a haste, she went to get a broom and began cleaning Anon’s room. He’s going to be so happy, he’s going to praise her when he learns what a diligent little girl she is!

In 10 minutes, she left everything absolutely spotless. With that, she left for her room and sat in bed. She kicks her legs up in the air and she hums to herself.

...

Agh! Time moves too slowly! She wants her brother now!

The fateful day of his arrival, her spirits were shot through the sky, she kept pestering her mom asking her when was Anon supposed to arrive to the point her mother stopped answering. Upon hearing the first ring of the bell, Polka sprinted towards the door at full throttle dressed in her best clothes and an obnoxious amount of hairpins.

She fidgeted with the keys, and even got them wrong twice before finally unlocking the door, and seeing her brother…!

Standing next to a girl.
