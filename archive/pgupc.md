##Personal Eden
>You were absolutely against the current situation.
>Tall, lanky, with milk-white scales and blood-red eyes, the snake woman peered down at you from the doorway. 
>Her eyes looked past you to your one-bedroom apartment while you read the letter handed to you for the umpteenth time in the last five minutes.
>*"Anon. I'm sending over a co-worker to stay with you for a couple of days. She's been relocated to your city, but her apartment has an infestation and is being fumigated. Letting her borrow your couch is cheaper than a hotel, so please show some kindness. ---Dad"*
>*"P.S. I know how you feel about anthros, but try to man up and put up with it."*
>You really hated when he did shit like this...
>*"Sso, as you can see, your father has given me the okay. I promise: I won't be a bother."*
>You wanted to close the door and wash your hands of this, but you already knew you'd be getting an earful from the old man if you did.
>Also, you guess, it'd be kind of a dick move.
>Crumpling the note and tossing it in the bin, you stepped aside and let the beanpole into your home.
>*"You won't regret this."* she said as she ducked under the doorframe, dragging a train of bags behind her.
>The rest of the afternoon was fairly uneventful. 
>You gave your sudden roommate the tour of the place, let her know about your early wakeup times, and told her about what foods not to touch in the fridge.
>To her credit, she seemed to absorb everything, nodding along with your explanations and respecting the boundaries you were setting up.
>When all was said and done, you settled back down and resumed your zombified state of movie watching.
>At some point you heard the shower start, and felt satisfied that she was doing her own thing.
>Nearly an hour later she...was still in the shower.
>You would be concerned, but you could hear her off-key singing from where you sat.
>Fuck it, you needed sleep and no amount of weird snake lady singing would stop you!
>You gave one last look towards the bathroom door, then retired for the night.
>That night, your dreams took on a strange tone.
>You were being dragged off to some pyramid by guards and mummified.
>All the while some cat they worshiped danced in the background to the music a camel was playing past the smoke of his cigarette?
>You were going to die. You could feel it!
>You were so cold...
>You woke up, but a scaly hand covered your mouth and scream.
>*"Sssh."* hissed a voice in your ear, making your skin prickle.
>Something tightened around your legs, and moved up your waist.
>*"Just let me sleep here. Where it's warm."*
>Who the hell...oh.
>Oh God, it's the snake!
>Your eyes finally adjusted to the darkness, and a white form could be seen moving around your body.
>And sure enough, the ruby orb of her eye watched you from the side as something wrapped around you.
>You would have guessed that it's HER, but that amount of flexibility wasn't normal, right?
>Every breath brought her body closer to yours, pressed her form closer to yours and stopped your struggling a little bit more.
>You wanted to shout, to tell her to fuck off, but that hand stayed tight over your mouth.
>You couldn't pry it off: she was WAY stronger than that wiry frame of hers implied.
>*"Just relax. I won't bite." she paused, before adding, "Not unless you want me to."*
>Maybe it had been tone of her voice, maybe it was the way she pressed against you. 
>Maybe it was even that the adrenaline went to the entirely WRONG part of your body!
>But the one part of you that wasn't being constricted sprung free from your boxers in defiance.
>You hoped that she didn't notice during her ongoing molestation, but her chuckles told you otherwise.
>A cold finger grazed against that part of you, stealing away the heat but doing nothing to remove its rigidity.
>More followed, coiling further around you.
>Your cheeks burned in shame, only for that heat to be wicked away by her other hand.
>She turned your head to face hers, to look her in the eyes as she spoke.
>*"Your father warned me that you were...opposed, to non-humans. That you'd slam the door in my face."*
>Her neck coiled around and behind yours, head resting on your other shoulder.
>*"Perhaps he was wrong."*
>You looked down to your traitorous erection.
>She did as well, touching you more as your arousal leaked out.
>Slow and nimble fingers spread it around, gliding further and further down as they slicked the scales and skin.
>Your breath came out in a shudder, and you could feel her laugh vibrate through you
>*"Should I keep going?"*
>NO! She should absolutely not! She should let you go and go back to the couch before she gets kicked out and has to return to that gas chamber of an apartment!
>Is what you wanted to say. Instead you nodded, much to your own surprise.
>That devilish tongue flicked your ear, sending a jolt up your back.
>By then, you'd been completely lubed up from the fluids of your own making.
>The hand gripped your tip with just enough pressure to be felt without being painful.
>Then it descended at a tortuously slow pace.
>You couldn't control your breathing, each breath coming out just shy of a moan.
>All the while, she watched your reaction from her perch on your shoulder.
>You had to bite your lip to keep from groaning from so much attention.
>Through it all, she whispered things into your ears.
>Terrible things and vulgar praises in equal measure seeped into your mind.
>Each second felt like an hour as she claimed your manhood for herself.
>At some point her fingers started to constrict, milking you in steady waves.
>By the time her palm finally made contact with your groin, your hips were moving to meet the motion.
>You hated to admit that you were shamefully clo-
>*"Let me stay for the month."*
>What?
>*"You can have more of this, if you do."*
>Was she REALLY-
>Her fingers reached down to massage your too full testes.
>This time you couldn't suppress it, groaning in defeat.
>*"You could feel so much better."*
>The milking intensified.
>*"You could indulge more in this...SHAMEFUL act."*
>...
>*"I know how you feel. It doesn't count if you've been forced, right?"*
>...you guess...
>*"This whole situation is out of your control, right?"*
>....yeah. Yeah, you were just overwhelmed..."
>*"So you should let me stay. So that I can't blackmail you with this."*
>...guess you don't have a choice...
>She chuckled again.
>*"Good boy. Forbidden fruit is so sweet, isn't it?"*
>You weren't...entirely sure about what exactly happened past that point.
>Only vague sensations surfaced in your memories.
>You remembered claws in your shoulders and legs around your waist, as you tried to push against something impossibly tight and heavy.
>You recalled sibilant whispers in your ears that promised all sorts of terribly wonderful and wonderfully terrible things.
>You kind of remembered the feelings of fangs in your neck, mind reeling with the idea of someone seeing your "mark" as you went about your day.
>You could still feel the shape of a forked tongue against yours, while your moans were muffled by infinite white.
>The visage of two red orbs bobbing above your crotch, and two white hands holding yours down was especially clear.
>But most of all, the thing that you couldn't forget if you tried, was the morning after.
>You awoke alone, drenched in sweat, and half hanging out of your bed.
>Your entire body ached, and your swore you could taste something weirdly familiar at the back of your throat.
>As you stumbled into the living room, your roommate seemed to be snoring peacefully on the couch.
>Your memory from last night came flooding back and was summarily pushed back down.
>You needed coffee. Strong coffee, and lots of it.
>*"Make me a cup too."* hissed a voice from behind.
>You didn't even hear her move, but the feeling of her head on your shoulder was a bit too familiar.
>*"You look like hell."* she observed, *"Have a rough night?"*
>Of course you did. She-
>*"I slept great, in case your were wondering. Your couch is surprisingly comfortable."*
>Wait...
>*"You seemed to be talking in your sleep, though."*
>Hang on...
>*"Whatever you were DREAMING about, it must have been intense."*
>You pause mid-pour and made eye contact with your new roommate.
>*"By the way...I might need to stay here a bit longer. Maybe a month, maybe more."*
>A scaled hand rest on your other shoulder, thumb tracing over a particularly tender spot
>*"You don't mind, right?"*
