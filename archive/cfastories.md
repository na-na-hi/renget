Well, I wrote some fox smut. https://rentry.org/dk52w
Sultry retro fox milf art in >>58201442 was part of the inspiration.

##57340982 Dergman: Lemonade Sky snippet 2
Dergman Sat 17 Jun 2023 17:49:46 No.57340982
Hey guys. I'm still working on the requests because I had a little motivation drain lately, maybe I'll try to draw them with a greater focus on the expression rather than the detail so they get done.
In the meantime, I'm still developing the focks story outline. Its got me motivated to revive the other hmofa projects I've had stashed away for a while.
Also, I've also been on a reading binge. Recently I delved into Assignment Risk, Hair of the Dog, and HYSA. I've finally purchased a Bible too so I'll begin reading that today.
I'd say more about the stuff above but I don't want to go too off-topic, so here's something for you guys: another Lemonade Sky snippet.
This was an attempt to flesh out the characters a bit more, but I might have veered off of that. Still, progress is progress.

>A lonely Anon walks into a Chick-Fil-A.
>He walks up to the cash register, where a fox girl is standing on the other side of the counter.
>"Welcome to Chick-Fil-A," she says, "so what can I get for you?"
>Anon orders a chicken sandwich with large waffle fries, but is stopped when he reaches for his wallet.
>"Before you pay, would you like to know about today's special offer?" She asks.
>Hoping it'll give him a discount, Anon nods and asks to hear more.
>"If you add another chicken sandwich to your order, you get to enter in a drawing to get smothered by my melons!"
>There's a good ten seconds of awkward silence as Anon's mind processes her outrageous response.
>Looking down at her chest, there's not much to call them melons, let alone oranges.
>And right here, in a Chick-Fil-A?
>Nonetheless, if all it takes to bury his face into a fox girl's chest (washboard or badongas) is an extra three bucks, it's definitely worth it.
>There will never be another opportunity like this. 
>Another item added to his total and a receipt later, Anon receives a ticket with a number on it.
>"In a few minutes, we'll pick a number from a jar. If its your number that is called, then you win!"
>Anon fidgets in place as he waits at the pickup counter. 

>About five minutes pass and a chime echoes throughout the restaurant.
>The fox girl cups her paws over her mouth and makes an announcement.
>"Attention customers! Today's lucky winner for the drawing is...number 46!"
>A quick glance at the ticket and he has...9h? 
>Anon flips it over, rereads the number, and then skips towards the fox girl.
>She takes the ticket from his hand and smiles.
>"Congratulations, you're the lucky winner! Now for your reward~"
>The fox girl reaches for her chest, sliding a hand under her shirt.
>Her hand fidgets beneath the fabric before pulling out.
>Held by the tips of her index finger and her thumb is a large, copper key.
>Eyebrows raised, Anon asks what the key is for.
>She replies with a mischievous giggle, served with a side of smug across her snout.
>The gekkering continues as she pushes the key into a slot on the register.
>"Brace yourself."
>Her hand turns the key, and the ceiling above Anon slides open.
>Forty-six melons pour over Anon's head, smothering him with their cold, hard embraces.
>All plummeting down on him at once.
>Thirty seconds after the last melon bounces off of the pile, the fox girl withdraws to the kitchen.
>She returns with Anon's order and sets it on the counter.
>"Will that be for here, or to go?"

You guys might enjoy this story.
It's about a kid who goes to visit his dad for the summer, only to find out he's got a new vixen girlfriend. She's nice and cool, but also somewhat mischievous. Her mission is to foxpill him so hard he never looks at a human woman again, and comes to live with his dad and her in the country.
I really enjoyed writing it, and I want to do more fox stories at some point. Vixens are my favorite.

"Uh oh, here come the dykes"
>there were three of them.
>vixens.
>vixens with unnaturally colored hair. 
>red, blue and green. 
>"razors" (because she cuts herself, always wearing long sleeves)
>"braces" (Because she had braces. Still.) 
>and "glasses" (because her father is the town's only opthamologist and yet people would rather go to the next town over.) 
>(Yes, she wears glasses.)
>the loudest lesbians on this campus. 
>gay flag pins, annoying catchphrase patches on backpacks, anime sweatshirts. 
>flamboyant speech, annoying laughter, judgemental looks. 
>so I bully them. 
>Sitting atop the stone wall lining the plaza, I assault their ears. 
"Dykes."
>A frog in my throat makes me mumble so I say it again, louder.
"DYKES"
>That stops them in their tracks. 
>And starts a shitflinging contest.

>"Are you seriously doing this shit again you fucking homophobe?" screeches Razors. 
>Glasses tries to be more thoughtful, brushing aside her bangs as she speaks. 
> "Why don't you take your small cock and mess with someone your own size." 
"Is that all you can think of, glasses?" I retort. "Try to make up for your father talking about all that dick."
>"MY NAME IS GRETCHIN."
>Thats really when the shitflinging starts. 
>and the screaming
>Glasses likes the stop her legs while Razors flails like a child. 
>And Braces, after huffing and puffing, prefers to throw books at me, or slap things out of my hand. 
>But Braces isnt doing her usual stick. 
>In fact its when she gets going the other two stop and push her toward class. 
>Right now they're just screaming until their face goes red through their fur. 
>Having argued about abortion for five minutes with the other two broads, I set my targets on Braces. 
"Speaking of dead babes, why havent you said a word?"

>Braces, I think her names Bedelia, doesn't say a word. 
> In fact she doesn't even seem like she's really there. 
"Earth to braces, you gonna pipe in or are you gonna leave them in your mouth?"
>That barely made sense but that didn't matter, Braces didn't seem bothered. 
>In fact her face was neutral, her eyes wide. 
>They seemed glazed over, and baggy. 
>Her silence got the other two quiet. 
>"Bedelia, are you alright?" Said Razors, rubbing her sleeve covered arm. 
>"Yeah! Bedelia, help me out." 
>"huh?" Braces seemed to slowly come to her senses. "Oh, yeah. Ugh." 
>With a groan, she put her hands on her friends shoulders and gave them a shove towards the chemistry building. 
>"Go on to class without me guys."
>"Bedelia, are you coming?"
>She waved them off. "Run ahead, I'm gonna deal with him."
>Glasses bowl haircut got frazzled as she responded. "Bedelia..?"
>They exchanged some kind of invisible girl signal, and then the green and red haired harpies walked off. 
>Leaving me, alone with the blue haired of the vixen trio.

>The wind blew and the leaves of the university plaza sycamores rustled overhead.
>Bedelia took a seat next to me on the brick wall and coughed.
>Her actual tail, like any other foxes' tail, though with the white tip dyed blue, brushed against me back and forth. 
>She spoke while looking away, so It was like a blue ponytail was speaking to me. 
>"What will it take for you to stop bullying my friends?"
>My mind froze. 
>Fuck, I didnt think this would ever happen. 
>I just figured they would graduate or campus police would one day be called and arrest me. 
>Ah fuck I need an answer. 
"Blowjob."
>Ah fuck I'm getting arrested for sexual harassment.
>Bedelia's ears seem to perk up.
>The tail thwapping stops. 
>She turns to face me.
>Bedelia's got nice eyes, half brown, half green, split down the center on both eyes. 
>"...What number your Dorm?" 
>What. 
"Uh… Y65"
> I cough and repeat the phrase. 
>"Alright, see you after class."
>And so she gets up and walks into the chemistry building, leaving me speechless. 
>Then she runs back out the door.
>Gets up in my face. 
>And kisses me. 
>her lips feel like heaven. 
>I dont think I ever felt so much passion in such a short peck. 
>I'm left staring after she pulls away and heads back towards the chemistry building. 
>I brush my knuckle against my lip.
>Her turquoise gloss smudges against my hand. 
>Fuck, is that going to be on my dick. 
>Wait. 
"Wait, you mean after chemistry? AFTER WHICH CLASS?"
>I get no answer as I watch her running, tail swishing. 
>I guess I'll wait in my dorm all day today.

CONTINUING DYKE VIXEN STORY.
"Its about time."
>She was on the other side of the door.
>Bedelia.
>The vixen.
>With pink braces.
>and dyed hair.
>Dark blue bangs tied up in a ponytail.
>It actually matched the orange color of her fur pretty well.
>Which also went well with her Half green, half brown eyes.
>Eyes that were lit up as she stood on the otherside of the doorway, happy.
>Happiest she's ever been in my presence.
"Uh…come on in, I guess."
>I step out of the doorway and let her pass me.
>She comes just up to my chin, her tail brushing against my knee as she walked in.
>"Sorry for the wait. Chemistry class."
"No its fine. I get it."
>It had been six hours.
>In the time that passed there was a room organized, bed made, shower taken, homework finished, studying occured, week planned, and several life goals written to paper and committed to memory.
>the desperate need to make time fly for the nookie necessitated creativity.
>In the time that had passed I had forgotten my bully facade.
>With her in my room now though, old habits came to the forefront of my mind.
>I leaned against my wall and crossed my arms.
"So, uh, are you embarrassed being a dyke and having to suck dick?"
>I was totally unprepared for being tackled by Bedelia.

>I hit my head against the teak ground, just short of the door. 
>Bedelia, climbing on me until her breasts were in my face, pushed the door closed. 
>"Alright, now that we have some privacy." 
"I was going to shut it." I say.
>"Will you shut your mouth?"
>The audacity of this bitch. 
>The vixen scooted back until she was in my face, and placed her hands on my shoulders. 
"What-"
>Before I could finish, her lips were against mine
>A repeat of that loveliness thst transposed earlier.
>Only now more intense, her sand-paper like tongue snaking its way into my mouth. 
>Meanwhile my tongue entered heres and tasted the metal and rubber of her braces. 
>For five minutes it was like I was fighting to breathe, her cold nose freezing my own.
>When she finally pulled back I gasped. 
"Bedelia…"
>"I'm calling your bluff, you."
>What?
>"You've been a thorn in our side since we were freshmen. You really think I'd believe one blow job would make you fuck off?"
"UH YEAH? ARE YOU AWARE OF HOW TOUCH STARVED I AM?"
>My spout of anger earns me another round of tongue wrestling from the vixen.
>Bedelia pulls back quickly, a string of spit from my mouth trailing off her canines. 
>Now she was the one gasping, cupping a hand to my cheek as she regained control of her breath. 
>"I… am giving you a new offer."
>I raise an eyebrow. 
>"You can never see us again. And I mean all three of us vixens. NEVER EVER see us again. I WILL convince those other two to come with me to another university to finish our degree." 
>That means spending the rest of junior and senior years entirely devoid of the dyke vixens on campus. 
>but then I feel the claws of her left hand against my junk.
>"OR, you fuck me, right here, right now, for 24 hours. Just you and me, condoms excluded."

"Is that it?" I retorted.
>She nods a "yes."
>That doesn't seem that bad of an offer.
>Hell the no condoms thing sounds nice. 
>She's a college vixen.
>She probably has an IUD, those things prevent periods.
>I think.
>and she can't possibly mean 24 hours straight sex.
>Just alone with her, naked, for 24 hours, probably sex and naps.
>I mean, sure I could take the other option.
>But as she pulls me into a hug and presses her C-cup breasts against my chest, I don't think I want that.
>Instead I should think of this as the ultimate win.
>I bullied a dyke into becoming straight to shut me up.
>Just wait until the guys hear about this!
>I push her away and give her a stern look.
"Alright, I would rather have sex with you than see you leave, as much as that would bring me joy."
>Bedelia's pink braces shine as she gives a wide grin.
>Without a word her hands are back on my shoulders, using them to stand herself back up.
>Turning away from me to face my bed, her tail brushes under my nose.
>Then with grace she kneels on the mattress.
>Her paws hook her denim shorts and pull down, revealing lace-lined blue panties.

"I'm really, really happy you picked this option."
>Bedelia said, grinning over her shoulder.
>Her tail was raised.
>Her blue panties were visibly soaked.
>And she was aware of it.
>Proud even.
>Hooking her thumbs in her panties, she pulled them down.
>Slowly.
>Painfully slow.
>So slow it took me a second to process.
>Between her legs, under her ass.
>A Pink.
>Puffy.
>Pyramid.
>On its face a concave Y shape.
>A sliver of girl cum connecting it to her panties.
>"Well, anon?"
>Well.
>I never thought anthros were that different.
>but, then again…
>Bedelia coughs.
>Her ears are folded down, a worried look on her face.
>"Y-you weren't expecting that..?"
>Her tail goes down, covering her alien pussy.
"Uh yeah but I…"
>The vixen collapses forward on your bed.
>She grabs the nearest pillow and pulls it to her face and screams
>Kicking her paws against the mattress
>The motion moving her tail enough for glimpses of her pussy to be seen.

>I grab a chair and pull it beside her. 
"Uh… you good?"
>Remembering something out of a movie, I reach for Bedelia's hand. 
>She snatches my wrist. 
>She looks up from the pillow.
>Mascara is running down her face.
>A look of pain and anger was on it. 
>"I know. Don't give me any of your pity. If you think I'm too ugly to fuck then just say it."
"What."
>Her grip tightens around my wrist. 
>I wince. 
>She bares her teeth
>"My pussy. Looks. Ugly. And you're no longer interested."
>I wretch my hand from her grasp and rub my wrist. 
>I seethe a bit before I reply.
"Alright broad I don't know who hurt you but this is totally not what I signed up for."
>"For a diagusting spade? FOR A GIRL HAVING EMOTIONS?"
>Her yelling takes me back. 
>I take a breath and try not to mumble my reply. 
"For a bit of mutual pleasure without pain."
>"Well, thats not possible?"
>I raise an eyebrow. 
"What? Why?"
>"Because you were gonna have to hurt me breaking my hymen!"
"Okay. Not what I meant, but alright."
>"WELL WHAT DID YOU MEAN?"

>She was screaming in my face, and now I was really afraid the neighbors might hear her. 
>I take a breath and look out the window. 
"To have sex without strings. Those stupid strings. Get wrapped up in them, and then when you thought they meant something, they choke you. And it keeps happening. Why? Because I'm a shit judge of character."
> I point towards myself. 
"Knowing all of our interactions up until now. The kicking and scratching. The name calling and arguing. Do you really think we'd make a functional couple? I mean for fucks sake I thought you were a lesbian."
>She coughs.
>"I mean, I'm just bi."
>I roll my eyes and wave my hand towards her. 
"And yet, despite all the shit I've put you through and everything I dislike about you, I want to fuck the everlasting dogshit out of you. I want to feel so close to you that it's like we're becoming whole or some shit. I want to spend 24 hours in your grasp so much because I figure it will be the last time I ever have sex and quite honestly I'm glad it'd be with you."
>When I finished, the Vixen was face to face with me. 
>While the torrent of words had flowed, Bedelia had got on her hands and knees and sat up. 
>Her face was now a mixture of sadness and happiness, a tear forming on her face. 
>"Really?"
"Yes. Really."
>I scratch the back of my head. 
"It's retarded. I'm retarded. I said I wanted no strings and I'm pouring my heart out. I don't want this to turn into me explaining myself. I don't think I'm wrong, I don'f want to fight-"
>"Then lets not!"
>My speil is interrupted by Bedelia.
>Once again her tongue is down my throat. 
>Then she pulls away. 
>"Your little speech got me hot and bothered, anon. Now fuck me before you find a way to turn me off!"

"Your funeral."
>I put my hands on Bedelia's shoulder and push her onto the bed
>She gasps as I do so, not expecting my agression. 
>Her legs spread as I lay atop her, feeling the warmth wetness of her crotch through my pants. 
>I kiss her neck, covering her fluffy neck and inhaling her scent. 
>Blueberry shampoo. 
>She giggles, once more her legs kicking out from under me and wrapping themselves in the small of my neck. 
>"Lose the pants loser!"
>I wipe the spittle off my lips. 
"Not yet."
>Putting my hands on her knees, I break free of her fullbody grip and make my way downwards. 
>Passing her still covered breasts, I lift her shirt to reveal a laced blue bra, built to provide support while lacking enough fabric for her nipples to be out. 
>"Oh i forgot I wore thaAAAH!"
>Her excuses are drowned out in ecstacy as her nipples receive their own kiss. 
>Then I continue south, kissing the fluff of her tummy before finally reaching her-
>What did she call it?
>'Disgusting spade?'

>It wasn't disgusting. 
>It was… hot. 
>The air around it was warm as hell. 
>The pink skin itself, moist and soft. 
>And it smelt nice.
>Clean. 
>Tangy. 
>But.
>Did it taste nice? 
>"Y-you don't have to-GAAAah!"
>Yes. 
>It tasted great. 
>I dug my tongue into Bedelia's pussy, my nose rubbing against the fur. 
>The Vixen's fingers dug into my hair while her tail whipped against my mattress. 
>Her moans became screeches.
>And then as my tongue circled around her clit.
>Gekkers. 
>My scalp was burning. 
>My mouth was drowning. 
>My nose was choking.
>And my ears were ringing.
>It was blissful. 
>Until finally, Bedelia's thighs envelloped my head.
>I heard her scream.
>I tasted a hot liquid, like sticky sea water, pouring into my mouth. 
>Finally she pushed my head out from under her person. 
>I landed on my ass, gazing up to see Bedelia sprawled on my bed, gasping as her pussy pulsed as every little orgasm sent girl cum skyward to land on my carpet.

>Getting up, I undid my pants and pulled down my underwear. 
>I was hard. 
>Bedelia was still gasping, her eyes closed and a shit eating grin plastered on her muzzle.
>When I took my position back on top of her, her eyes went wide. 
>Almost startled, The vixe pushed against me, peering down to see my junk. 
>"Anon… do you want me t-"
"No."
>I plant a kiss on Bedelia's forehead, and scratch behind her ears. 
"Are you ready?"
>She gazes up at me with those beautiful green and brown eyes. 
>She whispers something.
>But I can't even hear it. 
"Hmmm?"
>She nods. 
>"Yes."
>I give her one last kiss on the nose. 
>For goodluck
>Then I line myself up.
>Her gooey sex still leaking excitement. 
>And thrust ever carefully forward.
>Bedelia hisses between her teeth
>I feel enveloped in warmth as my tip enters her. 
>Then I stop.
>Not out of my own volition.
>But my dick wont go further.

>Bedelia is moaning as I go back and forth. 
>But it's literally just the tip of my dick being inside of her. 
>It wont go on further. 
>What the fuck. 
>I hump her again, a little harder, a little faster. 
>"Anon?"
"MY COCK WONT FIT."
>"A-Anon, you should-"
>With all my might I pull out of her and with one swift motion I thrust into her, feeling the resistance one more time before finally-
>"ANON!"
>Bedelia gasps.
>Her legs go straight. 
>and I go deeper. 
>The vixen squeals as slowly bottoms out in jer, until finally I feel her spade pressing against my stomach. 
>The vixen relaxes, her legs bending around the small of my back while her hands grip my shoulder. 
>I feel her nose against my neck as she takes a deep inhale. 
>"Asshole." 
"Sorry."
>"Oh, you're sorry?" 
>She cusps her fuzzy palm under my chin and curves my chin down.
>Her face comes up to mine.
>In her eyes, a fury I've only seen before she threw books at me. 
>"Anon."
"Bedelia."
>She moves her muzzle up to my ear.

>"Put a baby in me."

>It ellucitated a moan but made humping kind of difficult. 
>So I just grabbed her face again and shoved my tongue down her throat. 
>Now the tables have turned.
>Once I was satisfied, I put my hands on her hips and focused on pounding her. 
>My thighs were chaffing against the edge of the bed. 
>My hips burning. 
>At least Bedelia was tight and slick, driving me closer and closer. 
>She started to yowl again. 
>I couldnt even muster the breath to tell her to shut up. 
>I just closed my eyes and focused on humping her. 
>"yes…Yes…YES!"
>Bedelia's hands gripped the bed sheets and lifted them uo. 
>Her claws ripping into the cover of the bed.
>"CUM INSIDE ME DAMMIT."
>And with one hard thrust into her, smashing against her cervix, I came inside the vixen, before finally collapsing on top of her. 
>My face in her neck fluff, I took a deep breath of Bedelia's scent. 
>Did I… smell like her?

>There we were, basking in the afterglow. 
>Bedelia's finger played with my hair, hers ruffled and filled with cowlicks from all the sweat and fun. 
>I still haven't left the crook of her neck, staring out at the window for several minutes, when I heard her speak. 
>"Anon…nonny."
>I turned to face her, accidentally booping her muzzle with my nose.
>She rubbed her muzzle and giggled. 
>It was a beautiful noise. 
>God, I was bullying this beautiful creature? 
>Our eyes met.
>Her brown and green eyes seemed to capture the sunlight perfectly. 
>Her mouth was left open, and her braces looked cute and even beautiful, like shining gems, as weird as it sounds. 
>"Anon… I love you." 
>Hearing those words, I was at a loss. 
>This vixen, who not 24 hours ago was an annoyance to this campus, such a nuisance to my existence that I bullied her to the point of causing physical harm to myzelf. 
>This vixen was now in my room, on my bed, in my arms.
>And quite possibly in my heart. 
>possibly? 
>In her eyes was a glimmer. 
>why not definately? 
"I love you, Bedelia."

>Her ears went down. 
>Tears started to stream from the vixen's eyes. 
>"Oh… anon!"
>suddenly, her arms wrapped around my neck and I was pulled into a hug I couldn't escape. 
>A hug I couldnt breath in, either. 
"B-Beddy…"
>She let me go and I gasped. 
>"Sorry."
>On her face was a goofy smiled, her braces out for the world to see.
>"I'm just so happy. I love you." 
"I love you too bedelia."
>"duooah, heheheheh."
>Her cheeks went redder than normal. 
>She put her hands to her muzzle and defaulted to a muffled gekkering. 
>When that subsided, she was back staring in my eyes with a frown. 
>"So…"
"Yes?"
>Her black furred hand tapped on my chest, still covered by my sweat-soaked t-shirt. 
>"Round two?"
>I gave the vixen a shit eating grin.
>As we dived into the bed, entangled in one another's limbs as our tongues met, I heard a knocking at the door. 
"FUCK."
>Bedelka's hands were on my cheek. 
>"Oh don't be so fussy."
>The knocking sounded again. 
>And then came a familiar shrill voice, which made Bedelia's ears perk up. 
>"ANON! WHERE IS BEDELIA?"

>"Ooh! I got this."
>Out from under me Bedelia scampered, getting off the bed in an undressed state as she headed for the door. 
>"ANON! OPEN THIS DOOR!"
>Bedelia grabbed the door and swung it open just wide enough for her head to peek through. 
>"Hi Gretchin."
>"Bedelia! Where is anon? And why are you naked?"
>I started to pull my pants on, but seeing my partner in a similar state of undress, I remained naked, instead getting off the bed and approaching the unsuspecting Bedelia. 
>Her ass was perked up, her tail leaning over the side of her body, revealing a white heart shape on her ass with her pussy being the heart's tip. 
>Her pussy, still leaking cum onto the carpet. 
>"Don't worry about it, Gretchin. Me and Anon were just… working out our difficulties. In a peaceful manner."
>"Okay. Well. Wait, did you fuck him?"
>I came up on Bedelia without her noticing, as she seemed entirely focused on dealing with Gretchin based off that smug look on her face.
>"Why, yes. I did in fact fuck anon. And it was great."
>"What? Why? Did you get off your heat blockers again?"
>"Why yes, yes I did."
>"Girl, you totally fucked with your brain chemistry! If you were taking your pills you wouldny be doing this!"
>"So what? Maybe I'm not the same vixen on the pills that you deal with. Maybe I'm the real Bedelia, and maybe I like getting my brains railed out by anons nice fat human cock!"
>As if that were the command, I grabbed Bedelia by her tail and pulled her ass against me, hilting her right in front of Gretchin.

>"GASP. Oh… OH." Where all that Bedelia could say. 
>"Oh my god you are crazy" Gretchin said, taking a step back from the doorway. 
>I pounded Bedelia right there, her slowly regaining some self control to speak to Gretchin. 
>"No, G-guh Gretchin! I-ah am finally s-ah sane. Ah. T-This is who-ah I aaaamm. I am in uh love with anon. I ah am going to have his kids. Ah. And you ca-ah can accept it -uh. Or ggghuoh."
>On the other side of the door, Gretchin just stood there. 
>Finger to her chin and mouth in an 'O' shape, like she were a curious monkey at a zoo, trying to come up with a reaction. 
>Bedelia meanwhile was trying to keep her moans in check. 
>It was at this point, fucking my vixen from behind, I noticed her asshole.
>In a single motion, I stuck a finger in it, causing Bedelia to yelp. 
>"Ooohh ok no more doggy style for you." Bedelia said in a surprising act of clarity. 
>In one move she was turned around, standing on the tips of her paws as I fucked her. 
>I turned to place her against the wall, picking her up in the process and facilitating a gasp. 
>Fuckimg her back against the wall all while Gretchin looked. 
>As we shagged, Gretchin said "Can I…"
>To which Bedelia responded very loudly "NO!" 
>And with that Bedelia pushed the door closed on the green haired Gretchin. 
>"Now…" Bedelia said, a look of evil in her eye. 
"Now…" I repeated, stopping my assault on her womb.
>"Lets finish round 2, then I want to discuss baby names. And dinner."
>As I continued into Round 2 of fucking Bedelia, my blue haired vixen GF and probably future vixen wife, part of me was worried for what the future held. 
>Babies were big talk for someone with still a year to graduate college. 
>But those were worries, no, problems to solve tomorrow. 
>Today, I will give all my focus to Bedelia. 
>As my climax approaches, I think of something witty to say. 
>Something for old times sake. 
"Uh oh, I'm coming inside my dyke."

The End.

>When I was a young boy we would often visit the cabin my family owned.
>I was too young to know what recreational real estate was, but I knew exactly what to do with the surrounding forest
>I could never remember how many roles I had acted out, but one always stuck out
>I had gone on a journey through a magical forest to save the princess
>I found her there, her head only a few inches shorter than mine, but her ears making me wonder if she thought she was taller than me
>I would never know though, for she spoke no words
>Instead, she made an impressive collection of high pitched barks and screams; I would learn were called gekkers
>I learned it from my father and mother, that very night over trout with mashed potatoes and peas
>They complimented my imaginary friend, even when I told them a hundred times that she was real
>A fox girl who walked on two legs and had poofy hands, who I had to give a name since she never gave one
>And so began three days of me telling myself I needed to show her to them so they would believe me
>Yet, somehow, we always got distracted and I never managed to show her to them.
>Proving that my parents were right, in a way.
>She simply hadn't been real.
>I had never found a magical fox princess to save.
>Or befriend to play with in the fall leaves during my families chilly autumn vacations.
>That's right, that's what the name I'd given her was.
>Autumn.
>I remember those trips fondly, after all.
>Fondly enough to come back here after so much time, to check on the old cabin.
>It's dusty inside, and smells of being an animals home in the time I've been away.
>I foresaw this, and brought cleaning supplies galore.
>Scooping away the sheets of dust and exposing the old polished wood countertop.
>Trying to sit on the couch with it's Indian blanket to break a foot.
>This place has surely grown as much I have.
>It was when I made myself dinner, and went to sleep that the world grew strange once more.
>I was awoken in the night, by a yelp of sorts.

>Curious and fearful at the same time, I found myself at the window.
>Another yelp.
>A sound that brought tragedy to mind, conjuring the feeling of loss rather than impending doom.
>I opened the door, and gazed outside.
>Only silence there, and nothing more.
>With ease washing over me, I returned to bed, and didn't wake back up until morning.
>It was the morning, over a dingy wooden stove with ever warming meat and eggs, that I heard a sound once more.
>This one more familiar, perhaps because I was more awake.
>The sound my father had told me was a gekker; a noise like a traumatized beast wishing to escape imprisonment.
>Ironically enough, the sound of a happy fox.
>Something lurched within me, sending me out the door once again.
>In a flash of dark red-oirange something was gone from my sight.
>And I stood for a moment more, trying to recall the name again.
>"Autumn?" I call, a foolish twenty-something man, attempting to speak to the trees.
>The nearest neighbor almost ten miles away, I felt now shame in calling twice more.
>And as I gave up, reminding myself an imaginary friend goes away when the child in us does; there was yet another sound.
>A bolder noise, not made by some tricky woodland bottle-nosed dog.
>But a footstep.
>And with it, from behind a tree, I found a pair of bright blue eyes staring back at me.
>Frozen like I'd seen Medusa I hold perfectly still, save for my mouth slowly opening.
>Perhaps she was five feet tall, and made of red blankets and white socks.
>She stepped out fully from the tree, and I thought there might be a whole nother fox behind her.
>But in another moment I realized this was a massive tail following behind her as one does.
>With a short puff of her chest, and a flap of her mouth, a short but familiar bark came forth.
>"Autumn... You're real?!" My mouth still agape, it was a miracle I had mustered the words at all.
>"Real!" she cried, in a high-pitched voice, and I rejoiced.

>I chased her wildly through the woods, stirring up leaves and laughing like a maniac.
>I followed her bushy tail and aquamarine eyes whenever I saw them.
>I headed to the sound of her primal calls, yapping and screeching.
>I remembered my childhood in a powerful and warm flash of reds and greens and blues.
>The reds of the leaves, the white like the clouds, and blue like the river and lake nearby.
>Autumn was as real as all of the things that had been used as her color palette.
>Huffing and puffing I found myself back near the cabin.
>I stood tall and spun in a circle until I saw her there.
>She approached slowly, ears straight up, and with her hands outstretched.
>She reached me, where I held still for her, as her hands pushed against my arms and chest.
>And smushed my cheeks.
>"Real..." She barked again, as though She had been convinced I was the figment of your imagination all along.
>"Some hairless boy, speaking words?!" Her parents would jeer, "What a funny imaginary friend you've come up with!"
>I reached out and touched her in turn.
>My hands grasped her arms, and my fingers ran through her fur.
>She might have been made of fire, how warm she felt to the touch.
>And I watched her nose wiggle for a moment, her ears twitch back and forth.
>It was then I smelled it too.
>My breakfast was about to burn down the whole damn cabin.
>With speed like lightning I circled around to the front door of the cabin and through myself into the main room.
>Wielding some found towel like num-chucks I assaulted the burning things in the pan.
>An act that in retrospect put out the fire, but could have sent the burning things flying all over the room.
>Starting an even larger fire.
>When it was out, I turned to find Autumn standing in the doorway looking torn.
>Had she wanted to rush in and help, but feared the fire?
>Or did she simply not understand?
>I had so many questions, and yet it didn't seem like she remembered many of the words I'd taught her as a child.

>Will I have to re-teach her every bit of speech I once did?
>How much did I teach her?
>Can I even communicate with my childhood friend...?
>"Safe?" She questioned, bringing back a fond memory of leading the princess through the haunted part of the magical woods.
>"Yeah, it's fine." I reach out a hand, in a fashion like I might shake hers.
>Her head went on a journey, swiveling around to peek inside the cabin, but never entering.
>When her eyes had their fill, she stared to him.
>Slowly she brought one leg into the cabin, with a small foot landing silently on the wooden floor.
>Inwards into my cabin she came, and I felt almost bad for her as she was lured into this alien structure.
>She had never visited the cabin when they were young, always having been afraid of it.
>Perhaps she'd been afraid of his parents instead of the structure, making it okay since it was only the two of them there.
>I chuckled a bit, as she finally got her whole body into the cabin.
>It would be breakfast for two I suppose.
>And good Lord had running around made me hungry.
>Stove was still hot from the fire in its belly, so I cracked more eggs into the skillet, and retrieved the bacon from the one of the coolers in the corner.
>It sounded better than more sausage anyways.
>And, in some time I was greeted by a new sight, instead of a familiar one.
>Autumn feasting.
>She scooped the freshly cooked items into her maw in a fashion like it was a race.
>Once the hopper had been prepared, she began the process of lowering her bottom jaw and rapidly snapping it back up.
>Chewing like a dog.
>It was primal, un-ladylike, and looked like she was loving every second of doing it with her eggs and bacey.
>I finished mine in a more conservative manner, despite her standing up from the table she had just learned to sit at, and hopping back and forth.
>Once my plate had emptied, she grasped my arm tightly and dragged me towards the door.

>We played and played, even though I got a stitch from running after eating.
>It must have been past noon when we were rolling around in the leaves, laughing loudly into the woods.
>We tumbled down a short stretch of forest floor, and landed at the base of a tree.
>We laughed there too, for a moment, until we finally stopped.
>We were close there.
>Staring into each other’s eyes.
>Dead leaves and wet earth pierced my nose.
>My hands wandered from where I held her.
>Up and down her side.
>Upon her back.
>Until my wrist was caught by her hand.
>She pulled it off her arm, and moved it to her chest.
>My fingers slid into the fur, and cupped themselves gently around her small breast.
>A million things rose inside me
>Fear. Doubt. Lewd thoughts. Fear again. Worry that she'd been hurt or used. Anger that she'd been hurt or used.
>Fear again.
>And then confusion.
>She stared into my eyes like she wanted me to understand something.
>And I think I did.
>I felt her heart, beating there.
>The thing I had been meant to feel all along, instead of a white-furred breast.
>I felt almost silly.
>I released her and rolled back to lift up my shirt.
>With a free hand I reached out and stroked her ear, before tapping on my chest.
>She understood, even with a confused face, and abided.
>Her body returned to mine, almost burning me as the soft fur lay along my bare stomach and, her ear flicking around, tickling me.
>I gave her time, and enjoyed the presence of the physical touch.
>She didn't wiggle, listening intently.
>Suddenly jolted up in excitement, holding herself high with her pawed hands still upon my chest.
>"Magic!" She announced.
>And I was so happy. She may have remembered one of the most important words I ever taught her.
>I could see in her eyes that she didn't thinking I was running on some magical thumping device.
>This moment, was indeed, quite magical.
>And we lay there a bit longer, until we rose clumsily, still trying to hug.

>Back inside the comfort of the cabin, I re-lit the fire inside the potbelly stove in the center.
>This would heat the cabin instead of food, and had a much lower chance of burning the place down.
>Autumn got herself onto the couch, but couldn't quite figure it out.
>In a moment I realized she knew how the item was used, but that her tail prevented her from doing so the "right" way.
>I went to her, and with some awkward guidance, showed her she could simply lay down upon the thing.
>She looked contempt like that, almost smug.
>As though the sofa had become her castle.
>I smiled at her, and she beamed at me.
>Her teeth had once startled me as a kid, but despite the time gone, she looked... Normal somehow.
>I cracked open my bag, and began searching, only to realize I'd forgotten to pack any books.
>Instead, I made my way to the back of the cabins main room.
>In the corner were some old theater trunks.
>Popping the top one open, I found what I wanted.
>A book. Any book would do, but this one was perfect.
>Peter Rabbit, the complete collection, by Beatrice Potter.
>I returned to Autumn, smiling still.
>I pulled up the arm chair and sat down, cracking open the book.
>With it came a hundred simple words, complete with pictures.
>I don't remember when I fell asleep, but for some long and uncountable time I read to her.
>I would point to a word, say it, and point to the item in the well-illustrated pictures.
>In some time, she began to stare in wonder, repeating so many words.
>When I woke, however, there was a concerned fox looming over me.
>She held the book aloft, and pointed with a clawed finger to the old farmer from teh story.
>The hand moved away from the book and landed open palmed on my chest.
>She wanted to know what I was.
>"I'm human." I said. I pointed to me. I pointed to the farmer. I even turned the pages and found the old lady to call her human too.
>Autumn held her hand to her chest. "Not human?"
>I told her she wasn't, which conjured sadness.

>I had to comfort her for a spell.
>Petting her and telling her being a fox was okay.
>She never cried. Only gave a single whimper which was enough to bring me to her side.
>In some time I found she'd laid back down upon the couch.
>I said goodnight to her, contemplating tossing a blanket over her, but realizing she might overheat underneath it.
>Into the master bedroom I wandered, finding myself flopping down onto the mattress, and passing out almost immediately.
>My sleep ended almost as immediately as well.
>I awoke burning up, and thought first to move the sheets off my body.
>But I found none.
>I found something heavy and fluffy.
>Autumn had somehow crept into my room, and lay atop me, where she now snoozed peacefully.
>I however, could no longer sleep.
>It was fall outside, and summer in the bedroom.
>I lay still, but became conscious of every fiber of her fur poking me at once.
>What was worse, my own body had something poking out.
>In a futile attempt to adjust, I awoke the beast from her slumber.
>She turned and peered at me, our faces only inches apart
>Maybe not even that far.
>And as though I had no control, my face moved forward, and collided our lips together.
>I retracted after the short contact, her dark black lower lip wet and trembling, her upper still a fluffy mass.
>Her face showed no signs of shock, only confusion.
>How could she understand such a gesture, after all?
>There wasn't some other fox running around to teach her.
>She lonely. 
>To try anything would be taking advantage of her, in a sense.
>I'd have to stop now, so as to not do so.
>But the she returned it. A brief pressing of faces, her lips pushing into mine, though not pursing properly.
>I can see a smoldering in her eyes.
>She might not know what kissing is, but she certainly knows that it's an intimate behavior.
>And she wants more of it. Another kiss came.
>Then another.
>A rapid fire succession of warm wet fox kisses.
>Pushing our mouths together, then separating.

>The fact that she was no longer a child dawned on me
>There in the moonlight, the small fox I once played tag with without ever speaking the rules of the game, sat atop me.
>Her body rose and fell as I pushed.
>Her fur bounced in rhythm with the riding motions.
>I moaned and groaned from the sensations of fur upon my bare body.
>She yipped yapped and even yiffed, trailing her hands over my body, then up along hers.
>A gesture that showed there was nothing alien about our bodies joining and melding.
>I sat up and joined her in the moonlight from the window, which didn't reach the bed itself.
>Her legs wrapped around me in a flash, a silent acknowledgment we were both joined, and that neither of us was letting go.
>Her claws dug into my back, and my arms squeezed her tight enough I was certain her back popped.
>And we fell back down onto the bed, on our sides.
>Gasping and convulsing.
>Her tail bouncing up and down and she panted, lapping at my neck.
>I clutched Autumn tightly, and deeply inhaled her fur.
>Earthy and warm, with a hint of tree bark.
>My fire-furred goddess.
>I remember those days with some fogginess to my memory, as I gaze out to watch two small foxes playing by the lake.
>My children.
>I abandoned society long ago.
>My obligations, my job, everything.
>Just to be here.
>A warm tail wraps around me. And I regret nothing.
>Though I will say, buying bacon is easier than hunting pigs.
>"Papaaa!" cries a voice, and I see my son holding a fish high above his head.
>Those however, have become much easier to get as time goes on.
>I'm still very proud of him though.
