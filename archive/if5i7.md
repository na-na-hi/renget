Nasus climbed the Shuriman palace’s central staircase, his god-like footsteps echoing out in a pattering thunder. To a normal human, these stairs may have seemed insurmountable, but these golden sandstone walls had been built for the Ascended demi-gods of old – and so the herculean, eleven-foot-fuck-off tall beast that was Nasus had little trouble, aside from the occasional straining of the muscle-bulging tree trunks he called his thighs. He was carrying a dark, cloth bag that occasionally squirmed or leaked some foul, green substance. He paid it no mind.

The enormous doors of the throne room chamber opened with the rumbling of stone, their meticulously crafted engravings depicting various scenes of war, heroics, and debauchery. The chamber was excessively large, lined with row upon row of glorious, thick pillars and little else – a tactic employed to intimidate the envoys and semi-loyal vassals of Shurima, according to Azir. The emperor’s throne sat at the very far end, raised upon a many-staired dais that loomed over any who would approach.

Instead of the Azir, the Emperor-King himself, another figure sat upon the throne instead, much to Nasus’ annoyance. His brother, Renekton, the crocodilian counterpart to his own jackal-like Ascended form, was lounging about on the oversized throne, picking lazily at his teeth with one of his wicked claws. His weapon, the mighty crescent axe, rested against the stone, not far from his reach.
“Brother, what are you doing on the throne? You sully its glory with your base presence.”

Renekton took his time to respond, pretending to be so focused on his grooming that he did not notice his brother’s entrance. The crocodile’s crossed legs, almost as thick around as Nasus’, bounced lazily off the edge of the throne. At last Renekton deigned to acknowledge the other man’s presence.

“Ah, the dog has returned from his game of fetch. Pray tell, Nasus, what filth-ridden stick have you dragged home today?” The crocodile’s smile was terrifying – or would have been to anyone but Nasus, who knew it for what it really was - infuriating and insolent. 

“An intruder from another land, Renekton. I found him scurrying around the sewers, stealing things, making a mess, and otherwise being an all-around nuisance. Where is Azir?”

Renekton looked at the slimy bag with complete disgust.

“Why not merely execute the criminal and be done with it? You dare waste the emperor’s time with such trivial matters?”

At the mention of execution, the bag began to wriggle all the more, emitting a series of disturbed squeaks. Nasus gave the bag a good whack with his cane, silencing it.

“Well this one came in a… different form than what one might have expected. I think the emperor should wish to look upon it, first. So, where shall I find him?”

Renekton perked up at his brother’s words, leaning slightly forward to get a better look at his brother’s prize. He might have asked to see this criminal, but he dared not give Nasus the satisfaction. No, he would simply wait, and find out the juicy details later. Renekton grinned.

“In his chambers,” he said, repositioning his legs. With his groin now exposed, Nasus could clearly see the sexual fluids that were drooling down his thighs. He rubbed thumb and middle finger against his temples, knowing full well what such a display implied. Azir was going to be in a difficult mood.

“Ugh. Very well then, I shall find him myself.” Nasus walked around the throne, trying his best to ignore as his brother suggestively flicked his tongue through a V-shaped finger gesture. “And get off that throne!” The only response he received was Renekton’s raucous laughter.

***

Nasus steeled himself, and even his sack had become unusually quiet.

“No dawn comes without darkness.”

He parted the various silk curtains that led to Azir’s private chambers. The closer he got, the more he could hear the sounds of flesh against flesh – loud, wet slaps that could only be the result of one thing.

“Give yourselves… to Shurima!” The emperor’s words clearly pierced the vail of curtains, interspersed with animalistic grunts and panting moans. Nasus emerged from the shadows just in time to witness as the emperor’s elite guards culminated their lust-driven session. 

His avian emperor lay on an immense bed, taloned feet held skyward by the ankles. One of the muscled, nude men hilted into Azir’s divine backside, letting out a wordless groan as he erupted. The other man, who was squatting on the bed above Azir’s face, pulled back and blasted his seed over the emperor’s golden beak, assisted by a vigorous royal hand job of his thickly foreskinned meat.
Though approaching sexual exhaustion, each guard quickly withdrew, standing at attention by Azir’s bed. Their sweat-glistening, hirsute bodies, bred and trained to peak physical perfection, heaved with each panting breath. The emperor lay still for a few moments, his freshly-seeded hole winking and drooling into his feathers. He slipped two fingers past his rim, pushing globs of hot cum further into his ass. At last he sat up, and clapped.

“Nasus!” He said, taking a moment to lick his fingers clean. “My most faithful of servants has returned. It is good to see you, my friend. I’ve been thinking of your co-“ It was only now that he saw the jackal’s cargo, and his eyes widened. “What is this thing you have brought your emperor? A gift, perhaps? Have you been thinking of me?”

“Not a gift, your radiance.” Nasus kneeled, dropping the sack in the process.

“Hey! Watch it!” Said the sack, but Nasus powered forward.

“My apologies. It is an intruder I found, messing about in the Shuriman sewers and stealing from the larder. I dare not waste your time with such trifling matters, but this intruder is more creature than man. He is similar in some ways to you and I – the ascended – but, much… uhh, less.”

Azir frowned. He gestured for his guards to leave, and though they shared a reserved look they could do nothing but obey. Now alone, Azir crossed his arms, still sitting on the edge of the bed.

“Very well, then. Let us see this creature.”

Nasus nodded. He lifted the sack, grabbed the bottom, and tipped out its contents.

From out of the sack tumbled a frazzled, grey rat-man. It was as Nasus said; the creature hybrid animal and human features were very reminiscent of an ascended being, but his slimy, matted fur, skittish demeanour and all-around diminutive size was decidedly not ascended-like at all. The rat’s hunched posture placed him somewhere between four or five foot tall – a fair difference to the mighty beasts that towered over him. Little about him inspired awe – in fact, Azir found the thing almost pitiable.

“You, thief. How are you named, and what have you been doing in my sewers?”

Azir’s voice was utterly commanding, leaving no room for the rat to disobey.

“Uhh, Twitch.” He said, glancing around nervously. “And I’ve no particularly reason for being in these sewers, other than I happened to be in them! All sewers are connected in some way, from Piltover to Noxus and, I suppose, even to here. So if you don’t mind, I’ll just be on my wa-“

Twitch yelped as Nasus grabbed him by the throat, forcing his whiskered snout to the bare stone before the curious emperor’s feet. Azir rubbed his beak, giving Twitch a complete once over.

“You stink, little man. Are you perhaps the product of a failed ascension? I feel I would have known of such a thing.”

“You stink!” Twitch tried to raise his head but Nasus forced it back down, giving him a rap around his big ears for his insolence. Twitch grumbled, but remained silent.

“What would your radiance have me do with this… Twitch thing?” Nasus’ contempt for his captive was apparent in the delicate two-finger grip he had on the rat’s head. He had no wish to handle him any longer than was needed.

“Hmm. Well, I suppose he should be executed…” Twitch squeaked, going deathly still. “But I am in a generous mood today. He is still in need of punishment, and as you were the one to capture him, my faithful servant, you shall be the one to dole it out.”

“Very well, my emperor. What would you have me do?”

“Fuck his ass.”

Nasus groaned. This is exactly what he had been fearing.

“Please reconsider, my king. He is… filthy.”

“Oh, don’t be such a prude, Nasus. I’ve seen that weapon of yours. Indeed, I will make use of it myself, shortly. But I do understand your concerns… Strip him.”

Azir gestured for Nasus to lift the confused, shivering rat. He obeyed, and promptly used a battle-sharpened claw to tear the rat’s meagre clothing into tattered strips, which were easily discarded. Twitch shook, standing completely nude, his furry sheath on full display.

“Twitch thinks this isn’t such a good idea…” He said, spying the enormous, hanging ballsac and bulging sheath that was poorly hidden by his loincloth at this particular angle. He was too focused on the jackal’s immense package that he didn’t immediately notice the sand that began snaking around his ankle.

“Twitch will think of nothing more than Nasus’ divine cock destroying his inferior backside before long. Now be quiet, this may sting.” Azir waved his hand and the sand that was floating around Twitch’s foot suddenly clung tightly to the flesh. Twitch yelped, but was held still by Nasus’ iron grip on his shoulder. The sand curled further up his leg, grinding into his skin. It stung, but it was not unbearable, as if he had fallen into a bush of itchy-fungus.

The magic sand quickly ensnared his entire body, and wherever it peeled away from, the flesh and fur were left scrubbed free of all filth. By the time Azir was done, Twitch was about as clean as he had ever been. The rat was horrified.

“What have you DONE! I’m so… so, disgustingly clean! I hate this!” Twitch stamped his tiny foot, tail lashing around wildly. His fidgeting fist flailed and was stopped in its tracks by painfully hard surface. Twitch opened his furious eyes and followed the length of his arm to where his fist was planted against dark-furred flesh. He continued looking up, and up, and up, and his jaw dropped, and his eyes almost popped out.

The ascended demi-god Nasus stood completely nude, a veritable mountain of rippling, terrifying muscle mass, all packed into one intimidating, compassionless beast. His gaze followed that tree-trunk of a leg up to the man’s groin, where Azir was playing with those enormous, furred testicles. The emperor-king cooed appreciatively, coaxing Nasus’ behemoth male hood out by massaging his sheathe.
It didn’t take long. Azir’s attention quickly exposed the tip of the jackal’s red, canine member from within his fat sheathe. That huge, glorious cock inched its way out, growing larger and longer and thicker by the second. It continued coming out, inch after inch after soul-destroying inch until that horrifying, physics-defying bitch-breaker was out in all its glorious length, swollen knot and all. Twitch squeaked, and Azir drooled.

“Excellent! Now fuck this thing. For your Emperor, Nasus!” Commanded Azir, lying back on the bed with his legs back in the air, furiously jerking on his own impressive, turgid length.

Nasus sighed. He grabbed an open vial of lubricating oil off the nearby bedside counter in one hand, and lifted Twitch by waist with the other. He poured some of the cold liquid down between the rat’s furry, grey cheeks, whilst he emptied the rest of the vial in its entirety over his throbbing member.

Twitch looked around everywhere, squirming uselessly in Nasus’ iron grip. Nothing stood out to him, other than the bird-thing that had begun to finger himself as his eagerness intensified. For the first time in a long while, Twitch felt completely, and utterly helpless.
Nasus, having dropped the now-empty bottle, grabbed his captive with both hands, his thumb and forefingers wrapping almost entirely around the rat’s waist. He raised Twitch higher, positioning him so that his immensity was poking at the rat’s slick entrance. He slowly, but surely, and without mercy, lowered his captive onto his hot, red pillar of flesh. 

Twitch’s world faded, his consciousness drifting in a sea of anal oblivion. Nasus cock filled him to his absolute limits, utterly dominating his relatively untouched ass. He dared not gasp nor even breathe, for each angry, throbbing inch that filled him edged closer to piercing his guts and he worried that any slight disturbance might have ruined him. The jackal’s length could be clearly seen pressing out on his lower abdomen, forming a cock-shaped length that bulged out above his own mysteriously erect rathood.

“Yes. YES! Deliver unto this thief the justice of Shurima. Impart on him the virile strength and potency of the truly Ascended! Ruin him to the penetrations of any mortal length but your own. That is the punishment of the sands!”

Nasus nodded at his emperor’s encouragement. He more securely grabbed hold of the rat, and began to force him up and down his length. In truth, only one third of his enormity could fit inside the man, and so to avoid injury he refrained from thrusting, instead using Twitch as one might a masturbatory aid. Not that the cross-eyed, tongue-lolling, whimpering idiot could have noticed his kindness.

“Guh… nffg… eegh!”

Twitch was being fucked stupid. The utterly relentless, crushing pressure against his prostate elicited numerous, uncontrollable orgasms. Each one merged seamlessly into the other, an endless, pathetic dribbling of cum that coated his balls. Twitch didn’t even notice until he chanced to glance down, that Azir had been sucking his cock that entire time.

“Beautiful, Nasus! You are destroying him so expertly. Lower him to me,” he said, grabbing Twitch by the scruff of his neck and bringing it down. Twitch’s face was pressed right into the emperor’s godly asshole, but he couldn’t even find the strength to flinch.
 
“Partake of the flesh of your emperor! Taste the nectar of the gods, and despair, for you shall never compare.”

Azir ran Twitch’s face up and down his feathered rump, forcing him to lap at his loose, well-fucked entrance, still oozing warm cum. In all that time, Nasus never let up, and neither did his endless, ruined orgasm.

“How does it feel? You have been blessed, rat-thing. You will consider this the best day of your life.”

“Nnfgh…” Twitch’s response was delayed, and stupid.

Nasus groaned, and slightly slowed the pace at which he plunged Twitch’s depths.

“Your Radiance, I thought you may wish to know I am approaching climax.”

Azir clapped his hands excitedly.

“Yes! Knot the thief! Ruin him beyond all compare. Prove once and for all your superiority over such a lesser being.” The lamplight shone in Azir’s wild eyes, achieving a fiery intensity. The enormous ascended warrior stilled his brutalization of Twitch’s insides, giving him a moment of clarity to consider his impending demise. Nasus coughed.

“Your will is my command, Emperor. However… I can guarantee that doing so would surely kill this man. He is struggling enough as it is already. Do you still wish me to proceed with the knotting?”

Azir considered Nasus’ words, idly stroking his length.

“Hmm, I suppose you are right. I do not wish to dirty my chambers with his blood, and yet it would be a shame to waste such glorious equipment…” The bird scratched at his beak, letting Twitch’s free from devouring his ass at last. “In that case, you shall breed your emperor instead. You shall slam your knot into my divine backside and show this fool what true pleasure looks like. Come, Shurima will once again stretch to the horizon!”

Nasus and Twitch both gave relieved sighs. The jackal grabbed Twitch by the armpits, holding him still as he slowly pulled out of his ass. The rat whimpered as that monstrously large cock slipped out of his abused hole. As Nasus pulled himself free, Twitch’s rim bulged outward in a vulgar display, threatening to eject his insides out along with it. The warrior finally pulled out with a loud, wet squelch, followed by a small flood of lubricating oil. Twitch’s insides thankfully stayed where they belonged, not that he would have noticed much either way with his brain blanking as it was.

For the third time this day, Twitch was dropped unceremoniously to the floor. He landed at the base of the emperor’s bed, trapped by the sky-high, insanely muscled legs of Nasus. Twitch couldn’t have moved even if he wanted to, he’d been so well fucked that he had become temporarily paralysed from the waist down. He felt so empty, so hollow, that he almost wished to have his ass full once more. Almost…

“Yes! FUCK the lord of Shurima with that fat, glorious cock.”

“For grace, I go.”

Nasus collapsed upon Azir, hooking his elbows under the bird’s knees as he effortlessly slid into that well-worn cunt. This clearly wasn’t the first time Azir had taken someone as big as he. Whereas his guards before had fucked like animals, Azir and Nasus fucked like gods. They immediately settled into an intense, powerful rutting, the likes of which few mortals would ever witness.

Unfortunately for Twitch, he could do nothing but witness. He was caught in a precarious position, stuck between Nasus and the bed. Each time the jackal thrust into his lord; his immense, sweaty boulders swung down to smack Twitch in the face. For five minutes he endured this abuse, slapped around by canine testicles to the point of near concussion, coated by frequent spurting gouts of lube and cum, until at last the strength in his legs returned.

The rat finally found an opening, dragging himself between Nasus’ legs. At first, he had to pull himself along the floor, timing his attempts at freedom with the frantic, rhythmic howling of his captor’s lust. Scraping across the floor left a trail of liquid in his wake, making him glad the stupid beast had decided against seeding him.

Now far enough away, Twitch tested his footing. His legs shook, but he forced himself to a crouching position. One step came, and then another, each one wobbling and frail, but they did come. Finally, having found what meagre strength remained, Twitch chanced one last look behind him. All he could see was Nasus enormous, finely toned ass, with Azir’s legs wrapped high around his hips.

“Do not slow, Nasus. Together we will breed a new legacy. Forge ever onwards, and thrust towards the sun. Towards destiny!”

Twitch rolled his eyes. He considered shoving Nasus’ massive cane where it didn’t belong, but the hollowness in his poor rump convinced him otherwise. He scurried out of the palace, bow-legged with his tail tucked between his legs. No one ever noticed he was gone.

“I wonder,” he mused, “if this is how yordles feel when I find them in my sewers…”
