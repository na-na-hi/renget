!!! danger ➜ Uncertainty 
    - Any links that are **not included in the entire Megathread** have either not been approved by the moderators or the community, or have been deleted at some point. In other words, use extra caution anytime you sail in uncharted waters. 
    - That said, as times change, so do the currents. What is seen as a safe route to great treasures now may soon be a shell of its former self or even be riddled with the black plague. Always exercise caution and if you notice problems with any of the sites in our Megathread, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Piracy).
