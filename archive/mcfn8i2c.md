Big news, everyone! After many positive responses from our focus group tests, we have decided to go forward and buy the commercial rights of all of the 1-F students at Shiketsu High School from their principal, Karaburan!

All of the students had signed contracts ahead of time and didn't read them. I don't really know how many of them can read, to be fair. Anyway, we'll be using their image to launch our latest line of Valentine's Day cards! We approached all of the students with comments or ideas for what their card should say, but almost all of the responses given were not found to be very romantic and did not fit in well with the image we are trying to show our intended audiences. As such, our team of writers has come up with lines for each of the 1-F students for them!

Here are the test images, soon to hit store shelves just in time for customers to purchase for that special someone!

There was one more student among the group, but we have found that they are not a very suitable fit for the Valentine's Day imagery we are trying to produce.

I hope you have enjoyed our miniature showcase!
