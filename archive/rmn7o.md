Sad, genuine smile: Kanata's birthday gift extended.

Deep into the night, you were awakened by a huge thirst. Too much beer, too little water, your mouth felt like if you had eaten a handful of sand and the effects of the alcohol had for the most part subsided. You stretched your arm out to turn your lamp on and prompted yourself up, as you saw your door opening and Kanata’s face lit up by the light.

You almost yelled her name as she brought her index finger to her lips and made a “shh” gesture, slowly closing and locking the door behind her. She came closer to you and sat on the edge of your bed. Under the lamp’s light, you saw her in better detail, she was wearing a pink shirt with a cupcake drawing and some purple underpants with hearts. Towa must’ve lent them to her. 

“K-Kanatan, why are you here?” You whispered, incredulous to your question that you already knew the answer to.

Kanata gave you a sarcastic stare. “To you give your birthday gift, dummy.”

Your heart began pumping like it was running a marathon. Sitting next to Kanata, she brushed her hair off her face and you gave each other a kiss. After so long, the taste of her soft lips felt like a marshmallow, except Kanata was sweeter. Your dry lips soon wettened as Kanata slowly slid her tongue inside your mouth, which you received with much anticipation. Almost unconsciously, both of you embraced each other with your arms, Kanata placed her hands on your abdomen, slowly bringing them up over your shoulders and interlacing them behind your head. You did the same, except you dragged them down from the sides of her torso down to her hips where you met with her legs.

You pulled on Kanata’s tongue with a little force, letting go after a few seconds that were too short. You reached for your lamp once more to turn off the lights, but Kanata stopped your arm midway.

“Huh?”

“Don’t…”

Kanata and you usually had sex in the dark, the only light being the sun peeking through the blinds into your love nest.

“I want us to… see each other.” Kanata blushed tremendously, something about seeing her cute, soft cheeks redden made your heart skip a beat, and so, the lights remained on as you continued to devour each other in love and lust.

Once again you mouths met, needy as ever, both of you felt as if your tongues would start to melt. A little saliva escaped your mouths, short after a string of it would be connecting them. You swallowed, Kanata didn’t drink, so instead you were met with the taste of apple juice. Heading for her neck, you bit Kanata gently as she almost let out a soft moan, biting her finger to avoid it. You ran your hands under your girlfriend’s Pajamas, first rubbing over her small breasts, before picking it up and stripping Kanata from her upper clothes. You continued your assault on her neck, slowly reaching lower and lower, reaching her right breast which you sucked gently, licking her nipple. Kanata used her free hand to massage her left, gently pinching and twisting her nipple. You changed targets and gently bit her hardened nipple, once again moving lower and lower. Kanata slowly left herself fall on her back as the bed creaked.

Both of you received a sudden rush of adrenaline. You remembered you weren’t at her house, and so, you grabbed a pillow and put it between the head of the bed and the wall. You swayed your hips to check if it still creaked or hit the wall for that matter, nothing that could be audible from the adjacent room was heard.

Kanata and you let out relieved sighs, and with that out of the way, there was no one to stop you.

You launched yourself at Kanata’s tummy, she giggled to herself a bit as you nibbled it and licked it, slowly lowering your aim to her inner thighs. First you slid a finger under Kanata’s underwear, teasing her as you scrapped it across her hips. You looked up at Kanata’s eyes, begging you to continue in bated breaths. 

You took off Kanata’s underpants, and looked with delight at her smooth, shaven pussy, you thought you drooled as Kanata giggled once more.

“I sh…” Kanata was too embarrassed to finish her sentence.

“Shaved?” You helped her.

She nodded. “Just for you.” She added, letting the tip of her tongue peek through her lips.

Not wasting any time, you ran your tongue across her slit, which was already dripping like a leaking pipe.

“W-Wait, Anon.” Kanata told you.

She slid her right hand down to her pussy and with two fingers sticked her clitoris out to you, like a meaty flower.

“S-Suck on…” Kanata once more couldn’t finish her own lewd sentences, but you took the hint.

You gave it a gentle kiss before sucking it, letting your tongue give it little kisses with its tip, you let your fingers inside of Kanata, reaching for the spots you knew made her happy.

Seeing her expression shift depending on your actions was a prize in itself, never before were you so turned on just by seeing her make the faces she made, sucking air through her teeth or biting her lips.

Kanata’s moans were dying at her throat, giving it her best to not let a single sound that would compromise the situation out. You took off the shirt Towa had given you for your birthday and let Kanata use it a muzzle.

You kept eating Kanata out, who ran her fingers across your head, pulling your hair in pleasure at times. The taste of her slit lingering in your tongue, mixing it with your saliva, swallowing it alongside her love nectar.

Kanata turned over and stuck her butt out to you, spreading her pussy open with two fingers, she showed you a smile to invite you in.

The view sent you into overdrive, almost ripping your underwear off.

Still you teased Kanata for a bit, while also engraving her naked body into your mind.

Her legs and butt were nowhere as toned as Towa’s, instead they were plumper and softer, but retained a distinct perkiness that before you only knew by the feel they had in your hand. As you pushed them together, they held their shape nicely, giving her a playful slap, her butt cheeks marveled you with their jiggle while Kanata let out a soft “Hm~!”, still biting your shirt and giving you an annoyed but delighted stare.

You slapped your cock on her butt with increasing speed, the sound it made burning into both of your ears.

Kanata stopped biting your shirt only to give you a demand in a quiet but anxious tone.

“*Put it in, Anon, please put in it already!*”

You obeyed, sucking air through your teeth as you felt the tip entering Kanata’s wet insides slowly, Kanata panted to herself for every inch that she felt, melting under your touch. In synch, you pushed forward and she pushed back quickly, making a delightful sound of flesh slapping flesh.

“Ah~!” You covered your mouth.

“*Hmm~!*! Kanata lowered her tone.

You both looked at each other and let out air through your noses to stifle your laughs. And so, you began giving your love to Kanata.

Her creamy insides welcomed you with closed walls, her tightening her grip on you as if she never wanted to let you out, greedily taking you in as you thrusted. You felt something wet on your leg and realized Kanata’s nectar was dripping down her left leg, brushing yours as you moved, the lamp’s glow gave it a beautiful shine. Kanata’s cheeks also jiggled beautifully as your pelvis hit her. You fucked her until you tired yourself out, as Kanata began moving herself, swaying her hips from side to side, brushing you against her fleshy walls.

Kanata moved forward and disconnected from you before turning over, laying on her back, as you caught your breath, she spread her legs wide open and stuck her arms out to you, letting out pants in between breaths. You pounced her without a second thought.

Your shirt had fallen off the bed, so you kept each other shut by kissing, soft moans only escaping among the sounds of sucking and slurping.

Kanata dug her nails into your back, probably leaving scratch marks. You speed up as the sound of Kanata’s cheeks became music to your ears.

“Kanatan…” You whispered into her ear. “…I’m about to…I’m gonna cum.”

You expected Kanata’s usual signal to pull out, but instead, you found yourself trapped by her smooth legs, locking behind your back.

You were more than surprised at the gesture, Kanata lowered your head closer to her mouth and whispered into your ear: “Do it. I want you do cum inside today.”

For a second the world stopped. All you heard was your heartbeat, very slowly. Your vision became blurry, you saw a woman with purple hair and green eyes before regaining focus once more, showing the image of a girl that begged for your love under your body and welcomed you with an open heart. 

You let out grunts in between breaths, completely overtaken by primal instincts. As your hips moved back, you felt Kanata’s soft legs brush on your hips, her fingernails scratching you with force as she approached orgasm, she said “Anon, Anon, Anon!” in a excited voice right next to your ear, the bed creaked loudly, the pillow had fallen off and hit the floor but you didn’t care, none of you did, all that you wanted to do was give the girl before you all of your love, and Kanata too, wanted to feel your warm cum filling her up.

You hands had intertwined fingers unconsciously and you pushed them down onto the bed.

With one final thrust, you shoved your dick all the way inside and let out your hardest nut deep inside of Kanata, she tightened her grip on you like the first time she rode you, causing you to squirm and her to lose control, letting out one single pleasureful moan before biting her hand to keep herself quiet.

Not a single drop wasted, you fell to Kanata’s breathing heavily in synch with her. She gave you a satisfied look.

“H-Ha…” Kanata was still catching her breath from the thrill. “Ha…Happy birthday, Anon…”

“T-Thanks…” 

You both shut up and became alert once more, listening for a sign of Towa waking up. You stuck your ear to the wall, hearing only her snores, she was fast asleep, you were sure of it. 

Letting out a tired, pleased sigh, you looked at Kanata, still laying on her back.

Under the light, her body sweat gave her a shine, your cum was slowly oozing out of her pussy. You lied next to her and gave her a soft kiss.

“I love you, Kanatan.” You said with your heart in hand.

Kanata’s eyes lit up in awe, and soon after became watery, accompanied by a happy smile.

“I-I love you too, Anon.”

Kanata hugged you and let out a few sniffles in your shoulder. You gave her a soft kiss on her forehead.

“I love you so much, Anon.”
