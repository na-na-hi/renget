One more time, we gonna celebrate. Aw yeah. Dont stop the dancin

>watching his hips bounce and sway was almost enough to take my eyes off the screen. 
>ya know, for all the times we laughed and sang along to "gay Greg likes men, hairy men" during class it was hard not to feel a strange way about Matt 
>Matt, the cat dancing and swaying to an animated music video we both somehow managed to stay awake enough to watch
>his casual nature towards...everything just kind of put me at ease. Even when he was bopping around in his boxer briefs. I couldn't help but chuckle as he finally collapsed in a purring heap next to me, our hips rubbing with that wild tail of his twitching 

>all and all, it had been a pretty stellar birthday for me. Me, who had really shitty luck with both friends and birthdays all throughout my life.
>a group of guys who I can call actual friends
>said group actually agreeing and showing up for a "party"
>and party being a trip to a rather small but chill waterpark on a hot day.
>I was stoked just having a day that made me feel...special, not some weirdo. Though arguably my friends were kind of weirdos themselves.
>Greg, Matt, Kevin, me. All squashed together in the backseat on the ride there
>I couldn't really pay attention to anything, too busy laughing and having fun
>the day was a blur
>besides lunch...
>I remember eating those stupid snack boxes
>offering the last one of those cracker sandwiches to Matt
>Matt the cat, who was the first to tease someone for being remotely homo...
>I remember his crystal blue eyes as he stared at me
>the leaned down and the bare brush of his tongue and lips against my fingers as he took it from me
>the double shock and the electric tingle passing from my brain down my spine to my cock as he took it
>we didn't talk about it afterwards
>but I was left fluttering for hours, staring at the golden cat in a slightly different way

>now he surprised me again, feeling his tail tickling my spine
>I couldnt help snorting and twitching, clawing at the tingling brush
>Matt giggled at my squirming before casually and oh so gently using his claws to scratch my back slowly...heavenly
>I couldnt help but groan as he lightly tapped my head with his soft fist "sshh!" He huffed
>I completely held my breath, not wanting to ruin...whatever this was?
>then legs
>his legs sliding over my hips
>the signature weight of his body resting against mine
>he weighed so little, I dont doubt I could've bucked him into the wall...
>but every inch of my skin was electric at that moment, I wouldnt do anything to stop it
>soft, warm pads pressing and rubbing along my back to my shoulders
>I felt his thighs squeeze my waist
>I dared to look up at him
>"Matt?"
>he just tapped my head again "shush, look another one is starting!" With his eyes glued to the large TV screen.
>the feeling of his purring was hypnotic passing through his body into mine...
>I swear I was trembling
>at one point I swear he leaned down to sniff my head...
>but before too long, I felt him shift and yawn
>"i cant...stay awake" he groaned, maybe I was reading into it but he sounded disappointed.
>then he slipped into his sleeping bag and I was left a shivering mess
>I can't tell you how much I wanted to pounce on that blonde ball of fluff...but I didn't
>instead the adrenaline mixed with the light sunburn finally caught up with me and I passed out
