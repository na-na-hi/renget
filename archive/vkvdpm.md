!!! An excerpt from my original "Anchorage" story draft. This may be rewritten for the final draft of the story. - Ribombee-anon 5/29/23

The following text was discovered on a set of stone tablets recovered from a makeshift field laboratory outside a dungeon...

*Log 1: I shall begin recording the basics of my experiences and studies now. I believe I have traveled far enough to evade pursuit, and I have discovered a suitable place to inhabit. The nearby forest is a pleasant place to gather food and resources, and there is a dungeon deeper within this cavern. I will live here and continue my research, unhindered by the others and their ceaseless reprimands. The new field laboratory is almost complete, my faithful Golett stands ready, and my precious anchor prototype is nearly complete. It cannot fail. I will not fail. The dungeon will be stabilized.*

*Log 2: The laboratory is complete. My research begins in earnest. I have been delving into the dungeon and gathering samples of its materials. Golett and I have additionally apprehended multiple feral beasts for future experiments. They are stored in cages in the laboratory. Their baleful noises would ordinarily keep me awake at night, but my work is so exhausting, I could sleep through a hurricane now. I will spend some more days gathering materials and test subjects, then begin the experiments.*

*Log 3: I have begun utilizing my alchemical apparatuses to analyze and study the dungeon matter. It displays unique properties unlike those of standard matter in the outside world. The inherent structure is altered at a fundamental level. But the exact nature of the change is difficult to discern, as if it is actively blocking my attempts to comprehend it. Is it psychically active? Could it be... sentient? Surely not.*

*Log 4: I have been attempting to transmute and modify my collected dungeon matter for the last several weeks. Early attempts failed, but I am making progress. Studying the ferals has been particularly useful. Their physical structure is similar to standard matter, but retains the same ethereal nature of the dungeon matter. Curiously, while killing a feral makes it fade into smoke, severed body parts will persist—but these rapidly shift to become identical to standard matter. Perhaps they are absorbing information from their surroundings and changing to blend in? Whatever the reason, feral matter is clearly able to alter itself. If I could comprehend this mechanism, I might be able to apply the same concepts to the dungeon matter and force it to change into a more stable form. Could this be the key to my anchor?*

*Log 5: Success! When I left Dragon Gate so many weeks ago, I absconded with a prototype anchor, with the intent to complete it on my own. With what I have learned from this cavern and its dungeon, it is now complete. I have situated the anchor at a site I have determined to be the core of the dungeon. Upon activation, the device stabilized the dungeon perfectly! It exceeds my expectations. Feral Pokemon no longer spawn, the dungeon no longer shifts, and all distortions have faded. The dungeon is now no more mysterious than an ordinary cavern. I shall continue to observe it. I trust it shall remain stabilized indefinitely, for the anchor draws power from the dungeon itself, and the source of its energy remains—it is simply less volatile now.*

*Log 6: Disaster! The anchor has failed and the dungeon has undergone an enormous shift that shows no sign of stopping. Perhaps the transforming power of the dungeon was only partially suppressed, and it continued to increase until reaching catastrophic levels and bursting forth all at once. I should desert this place, but I refuse to abandon my anchor within the depths. It is the crux of my research, and one of a kind. I am embarking inside with my faithful Golett to retrieve the device. If any adventurers discover this note, know that I have likely perished in the endeavor. But if the gods decide I am to die, so be it. We will lock the door behind us, but there is a second key in the black jar on the desk. If you wish to bear witness to my failure, use it to access the dungeon. If by some miracle you dive deep enough to locate my device or my body, I only ask that you respect them both. And I ask that you remember my name and my desires.
Farewell,
Cyclamen of Dragon Gate Village*
