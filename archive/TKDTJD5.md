This is what I have already announced.

The purpose of cutting funding to UNRWA is to forcibly evict Gaza and carry out ethnic cleansing.

Gaza is currently destroyed and flattened. People don't have food, they don't have medicine, they don't have arable land, they don't have anything, and they can't survive without humanitarian aid and it will be like that for years.

The goal of Israel and the West is to starve the population of Gaza, to the point where they start accepting asylum in Europe offered by Israel.

What Israeli politicians and war criminals publicly declared that Europe would accept the refugees from Gaza, they are now on their way to do it.

"There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the court. This is one of those cases, the US district court in the northern district of California ruled.
