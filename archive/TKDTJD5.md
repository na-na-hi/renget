>Israeli Politician Daniella Weiss suggests depriving the Palestinians in Gaza of humanitarian aid "so the countries of the world will have pity on them and take them."
This is what I have already announced.

The purpose of cutting funding to UNRWA is to forcibly evict Gaza and carry out ethnic cleansing.

Gaza is currently destroyed and flattened. People don't have food, they don't have medicine, they don't have arable land, they don't have anything, and they can't survive without humanitarian aid and it will be like that for years.

The goal of Israel and the West is to starve the population of Gaza, to the point where they start accepting asylum in Europe offered by Israel.

What Israeli politicians and war criminals publicly declared that Europe would accept the refugees from Gaza, they are now on their way to do it.
