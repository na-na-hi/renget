This is what I have already announced.

The purpose of cutting funding to UNRWA is to forcibly evict Gaza and carry out ethnic cleansing.

Gaza is currently destroyed and flattened. People don't have food, they don't have medicine, they don't have arable land, they don't have anything, and they can't survive without humanitarian aid and it will be like that for years.

The goal of Israel and the West is to starve the population of Gaza, to the point where they start accepting asylum in Europe offered by Israel.

What Israeli politicians and war criminals publicly declared that Europe would accept the refugees from Gaza, they are now on their way to do it.

"There are rare cases in which the preferred outcome is inaccessible to the court. This is one of those cases, the US district court in the northern district of California ruled.

All of the strikes are aimed at Iraqi national forces associated with the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMU/Hashd al Shaabi), an official government entity. 

These strikes have no negative impact on the resistance factions, but rather on the Iraqi people, who hold the Popular Mobilization Forces in high regard. Drone attacks against US bases continue, and US airstrikes are ineffective at deterring

>BREAKING:

 🇵🇸🇮🇱 Hamas delegation rejects truce project with Israel

Representatives of the Palestinian Hamas movement refused to accept the terms of a ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip, which was proposed at peace talks in Paris.

The draft truce does not correspond to the position of Hamas and does not restrict Israel from carrying out military operations, Al-Mayadeen reports.

“The agreement in Paris provided for the exchange of prisoners, but completely ignored the ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops from Gaza, while the resistance forces consider these issues to be key,” the journalists note.

The text of the agreement does not restrict Israel from carrying out airstrikes on Palestinian territories and does not provide for the withdrawal of Israeli troops.

It is expected that a new truce project will soon be discussed in Cairo by representatives of Hamas and Israel with the participation of international mediators.

Netanyahu said yesterday that he will not accept "anything" for the release of the Israeli hostages, practically indicating that he may sacrifice the hostages.

Nearly 350 school shooting incidents occurred across the U.S. in 2023, data shows.

Despite that, money will be allocated only for "Jewish schools". The US government will work only on their protection.

In addition to this, NY Governor Kathy Hochul announces a whopping $183 million in compensation to Jewish descendants of Holocaust victims, despite the fact that the Holocaust ended 80 years ago, 80% of whom were non-Jews, and the United States then had nothing to do with the Holocaust.

The Jews in the USA are now like a superior race. Not even Americans themselves enjoy the privileges they enjoy.

Despite all that, for the second time in 3 months, Israel will receive a $17.6 billion gift from US taxpayers.

• The Islamic resistance in Iraq is highly prepared and closely monitors the realities of Iraq, the regional scene, and the international stage to the extent that the American occupier is afraid of the reactions of the Islamic resistance.

• There is coordination between the resistance in Yemen and the resistance in Iraq through attacks on Americans in the region.

• All of America's interests in the region are the target of the Islamic resistance in Iraq, and the resistance possesses extensive information about undisclosed American interests.
