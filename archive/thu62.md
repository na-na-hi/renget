In the warm summer sun, a younger Sterling stands at the edge of the large pool that sits in the middle of a back yard. His small hands grip the side, his father wades into the water, motioning for him to join. Sterling hesitates, his eyes reflecting a mix of fear and uncertainty.

"Dad, I don't like the water. It's scary," Sterling confesses, his voice carrying a note of vulnerability.

His father, with a reassuring smile, extends his arms. "I used to feel the same way when I was your age. Water can be intimidating, but sometimes we need to face our fears to discover something amazing."

Sterling reluctantly steps into the pool, the cool water reaching his ankles. 

"You know, I was a competitive swimmer back in college. But I didn't start that way. It took time and effort to get comfortable in the water. Learning new things is tough, Sterling. It's never easy, but it's how we grow."

His father guides him through the basics of swimming, offering both support and encouragement. Sterling, in his father's arms, begins to feel a sense of safety despite the initial fear. As the session progresses, Sterling's resistance lessens, replaced by a growing sense of accomplishment.

Later, as they sit by the pool, towels wrapped around them, Sterling's father looks at him with a sparkle of excitement in his eyes. "You did great today. Maybe this summer, you and your sister can visit the beach. It's a different kind of water, but it might help you see that the ocean isn't as scary as it seems."

Sterling looks back and smiles at his father. “Yeah! That sounds fun. Maybe you can show me more on how to swim so I can show off to Mom!” Sterling’s smile extends as both him and his father begin laughing and hugging one another…

The forest enveloped us in a verdant embrace as we ventured deeper along the path outside of the village. The rustling leaves and the distant hum of Pokémon created a symphony of nature around us. My shell felt heavier than usual as I scuttled across the grounds, not just from the dense underbrush but also from the weight of the decision to embark on this journey. We left a bit ago to track down the Mankey and Primeape once and for all.

*"I wouldn't usually do something like this,"* I thought to myself, a mix of uncertainty and eagerness in my eyes. *"But maybe it's time to start growing up and facing the challenges in front of me."*

Happiny's whimpers cut through my contemplation. His body hung downwards, his numbs for hands flailing around alongside his steps. He was struggling with the reality of our mission, his courage flickering like a fragile flame. "Let's go back home. We aren't cut out for thiiiiiiis," he pleaded, his voice a mixture of fear and doubt.

Sentret shot him a puzzled look. "What? You were the one who stood up to Scrafty and pushed us to do this in the first place," she retorted, her tone a blend of surprise and reproach.

Happiny hung his head, admitting, "I knowwwwwwwwwww, but that was just a flash of determination, not the real thing!" He whimpers more about to fall onto the ground.

I sighed, realizing that Happiny's wavering resolve mirrored my own inner struggles a bit ago. "Don’t we have to face new challenges to grow and get better at this," I said, trying to reassure him. I turned to Sentret, seeking affirmation. "Isn't that right?"

Sentret smiled, her eyes reflecting both experience and optimism. "Absolutely. Growth comes from facing the unknown." She places her nubs for hands on her sides raising herself up with her tail to seem larger than life.

Encouraged, Happiny nodded, attempting to steel himself. With newfound determination, he sprinted ahead of us, positioning himself proudly in front, almost tripping in the process. "That’s right guys! We're an exploration team, and nothing can stop us! Undefeatable, Undeniable! Unstoppa-"

However, the universe had other plans. In an instant, a Seviper burst forth from the underbrush, its sinister presence unmistakable. It slammed into Happiny with a force that sent both of them careening into the forest to the east. "Happiny!" Sentret and I exclaimed simultaneously, our voices echoing through the trees.
