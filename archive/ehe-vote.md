1.See if the overall concept presented is accepted.
2.If it is, put what is written in there into a trial period where we can see it work in practice.
3.As things go alone, various kinks and wording shall be worked on until a polish final version shall be made.

3. (Blank), not voting on something someone might think I am personally invested in based on friendship.
4. Yes, the trial is what pushed me over to agreeing to this. honestly, don't give a shit either way. I do think that if anyone expects that this will solve the threads problems magically, that's fucking stupid overall, but alas, i would rather see something tried out to fix the problems then to sit around and think its just fine because it is not just fine, the drama and accusations have made me not very enthusiastic about the project myself. Let's all do better, yes?
