#Ribombee-anon's Homepage

I’m Ribombee-anon, and I’m making this page to compile the work I’ve done for the Clover Guild collaborative fiction project. Hope you enjoy checking out my stuff!

To learn more about the project, see our main page at https://cloverguild.com/

##Characters

My main characters in the Clover Guild are Team Brave (Booker the human-turned Ribombee and a native Sneasel), but I also have a secondary team, Team Buckler (Cooper the human-turned-Torchic and Testa the native Squirtle).

###Team Brave

One of the founding teams of the Clover Guild, Team Brave consists of the shy human-turned-Ribombee Booker and his tomboyish partner Sneasel. Despite being opposites in almost every way, the two of them have completed many missions and gradually developed a deep affection for each other.

####Booker

Booker was once a human (like many members of the guild), and became a Ribombee upon entering the Pokemon world. He is tiny and timid, but also polite and intelligent. While initially unable to fly or use moves, he has been training to acquire these skills. He plays a support role in dungeons, riding in his partner’s bag and providing items and advice.

####Sneasel

Sneasel is a native Pokemon who hails from a tribe on a distant frigid island. A headstrong and mischievous tomboy, she is one of the best fighters in the guild, though she is also not the sharpest tool in the shed. She sometimes struggles with feelings of self-doubt, but she will fight with all her strength to protect her newfound friends in the guild.

###Team Buckler

A skilled and experienced Platinum Rank rescue team from Pokemon Square on the Air Continent. They arrived on the Grass Continent via a dungeon shift, and decided to join the Clover Guild until finding a way home. Cooper and Testa are devoted to their work, and primarily take rescue jobs, but will perform other duties as well. They are very close and care deeply for each other, and they cooperate well and cover each other’s weaknesses, making them a formidable team in combat. The team slogan is “the shield that saves those in need”, which Testa invented. Cooper isn’t a fan of it.

####Cooper

A human-turned-Torchic who arrived on the Air Continent two years ago and formed a rescue team with Testa. At one point, they were betrayed and falsely accused of a horrible crime, which caused a lynch mob to chase him and Testa through many hazardous places across the land. As a result, Cooper developed PTSD and began suffering from crippling trust issues. With Testa’s help, he’s been trying to overcome this. He still tends to act wary, cagey, blunt, and aloof, but has a good heart and tries to do the right thing. In combat, he takes the role of a glass cannon: frail, but also swift, agile, and powerful.

####Testa

A friendly and playful native Squirtle who lived on the Air Continent and formed a rescue team with Cooper. She recovered from the pain and shock of their betrayal much quicker than Cooper, and has been trying to help him recover as well. She always tries to help those in need, even if it requires breaking the rules. She is optimistic and supportive, though she also has a mischievous streak. In combat, she acts as a tank, frequently using her remarkably sturdy shell to block attacks and protect her allies.

##Artwork

The Clover Guild inspired me to learn how to draw digitally with a mouse, and get more serious about my art (though I’m still an amateur (for now)). My artwork can be found on our booru here: https://cloverguild.com/booru/posts/query=ribombee-anon

##Stories

This is a list of all my stories. They’re listed by chronological order instead of release date, but each story’s publishing date is also provided. Although the guild project’s timeline is not particularly concrete, I tried organizing the stories in a way that made sense.

Also note that I have a sort of anthology called “Booker’s Journal; or, My Time at Capim” (https://rentry.org/RibombeeJournal), which was my attempt at making one single page to hold a bunch of slice-of-life stories. I may cancel that idea and split the included stories up into individual pages, but for now, I'll keep it as is. The journal stories are included individually in this list.
