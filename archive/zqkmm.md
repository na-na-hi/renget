Rough times.

Late at night, a light made it's presence in a pitch dark, empty living room, a TV playing some old comedy from the 70's at a barely perceptible volume.
Down the hallway, a rhythmic sound reververated across the house. 

The bed creaked every second Amelia rode you, slamming itself against the wall, chirping away little bits of paint over time. You felt how Amelia's breath  came closer to your face, before a short kiss signed you to open your mouth. Amelia wasted no time before playing with your tongue, sucking it wrestling it with hers, you let your tied hands fall behind her head and kept her there for a bit more, but Amelia took your wrists in her hand and freed herself. She kept assaulting you, licking your neck, sucking your chest hard enough to leave a hickey, she shoved one of her fingers into your mouth and you stuck your tongue out instictively.

"Good boy!" Said Amelia before spitting her saliva in your mouth. 

"Now swallow."

You did as you were told. Amelia grinned, biting her lower lip, marveled at your submission. She leaned down closer to you again and gave you another passionate kiss, grinding her hips on your dick in a rotating motion. You were losing it, Amelia untied your hands and wrapped herself around you, trying to turn you over. You let her do it because she wasn't able to with her small frame, but she seemed satisfied nonetheless. Amelia pulled you in with a leglock and ran her nails across your chest. Without a second thought you started humping her wet, creamy hole. She digged her nails onto your back, scratching with great force as you could feel your skin begin to burn with every little stroke she made.

"Do it you little fuck, fucking cum inside me!" 

Her voice sent you over the edge, and you let out your load inside of your girlfriend, who gladly watched you moan in pleasure as your cum entered her. Amelia kept thrusting your hips using her legs until you fell on top on her. Both of you heard your breaths right next to your ears. Amelia caressed your back and bit your ear playfully.

"I love you, Anon."

"I love you too, Ame."

..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

You clutched Amelia's pudgy belly in your hand as she turned her head away from the TV and gave you a pouty look.

"Don't be so mean, Anon."

"I like it, you know."

"Still..."

Lying on the sofa, you let the cute girl bury her face in your chest, with her arms behind your head. She turned her head to the show you were watching, or at least had tried to watch, now all of your attention was focused on the cutie laying on top of you, and she too, was happy just to spend time with you.

Amelia had just gotten back home from her collab with Myth and Council, and all she wanted for a rest was to feel you again, your gentle hands on her body, your smell, the food you made, playing videogames with you...

You couldn't resist cuddling Amelia, and she didn't protest either.

"It feels nice to finally be home." She said.

"Same."

Ame looked puzzled for a bit.

"What do you mean? You were here all the time!"

"Doesn't feel like it if you're not here."

Even in the twilight of the TV, you knew Amelia's face became beet red. Mission accomplished.

"...Dumbass." Muttered Amelia.

She fidgeted with your hair for a bit before coming up to your face and giving you a kiss. Amelia's soft lips brought you to heaven, there she is, your blonde marshmallow. All of these little moments you share are a treasure to you both, and neither would change them, not for all of the gold in the world. You came down from your cloud as your soul slammed itself back onto your body resting on the sofa, Amelia was running her hand under your pajamas.

"You say you missed me, but I bet you missed something else, right?"

Amelia stroked your cock gently, slowly growing into a full erection. Half of her face was illuminated by the TV, and you could see half of her lustful smile. She lowered your pajamas and and grinned back at you as she rubbed your cock in her cheek. Amelia opened her mouth wide and slapped your member on her tongue a few times, before jerking it and sucking the head, working her way lower and lower to the base of your cock using her tongue. You placed both of your hands on her head and gently pat her, in between breaths, Amelia whispered.

"Come on anon, ah.... please.... nngh.... rough me up how I like it."

Amelia watched in delight how you shifted your hands to the sides of her head and opened wide for what was about to come. With primal force, you started to fuck Amelia's cute face, holding her in place with both hands, giving her only small windows to catch her breath. As you shoved your dick inside her mouth, her tongue rubbed itself back and forth on your dick. 

Amelia gave you a dirty look, asking for more, and so you shoved your dick deeper in, letting your head down her throat. Yet, you were trying to be gentle, if Amelia seemed as if it was too much for her, you pushed back, only for her to swallow you whole once more. 

Calmly, she tapped on your belly and you stopped. Amelia got up and turned around, sticking her ass out to you and spreading her pussy open with two fingers. 

"Don't keep me waiting, please"

Just as Amelia finished her sentence, you dick was already at her entrance, and just as quickly, you made yourself home inside her. Loud moans were escaping Amelia, as her love juices dripped onto the couch with a slight shine coming from the TV's light. You fucked her nice and hard, relishing on the wet sounds combined with the slapping of her buttchecks on your pelvis. Ame lightly tapped her right buttcheek, and you took the hint.

A loud slap that made Amelia moan in an extremely high pitch sent her into overdrive.

"Fuck! More, please, hit me more!"

One slap, two slaps, three consecutive slaps and a nice firm grope of Amelia's plump butt, she was already losing it by the time she felt something sliding across her back, reaching for her hair and pulling her head back in a violent, yet gentle manner.

"Oh fuck yeah, take it, you whore!"

"Yes, YES! I love it, I love being your little whore! I am Anon's little fucktoy!"

Amelia's moans were getting out of control, until she started yelling in pain and twitching. You inmediatedly pulled away and gave her room to breathe, growing increasingly worried as your girl fell on the sofa.

"Fuck! Was I too rough? Ame?! Are you okay?! AME!"

Amelia signaled you to calm down with her hand and stood up with some effort, letting out some grumps and stepping hard on the floor with her right foot. 

"Sorry, I-I got a cramp." She said, turning back to you.

You sighed in absolute relief. Sitting on the sofa, while catching your breath, Ame sat next to you and she leaned in, resting her head on your shoulder.

"I-I'm sorry, I killed the mood." She said with a sad, guilty voice.

Your boner was gone, seeing Amelia like that had scared you to your core. But you were happy it was just that.

"Don't worry, it's not your fault, Ame."

Amelia looked to you for comfort and you embraced her with your arms. She always beats herself up way too much about these things.

"This sofa sure is uncomfortable, isn't it?" You said trying to ease her tension a bit.

"Yeah, I guess" Said Amelia with a faint smile.

You placed your hand on her chin and raised it up for a kiss.

"Let's take this somewhere else, shall we?"

"Okay, but this time, I want to be the dom." Said Amelia.

"Feeling creative I see."

"Yup! I even brought something for the ocassion!"
