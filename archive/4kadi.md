>Hero woke up in the hangout spot on a foggy day but everything had a tint of white
>looking around he spotted two pianos, side by side one of them being play by a most familiar figure, the other free for the taking
>"it beats the usual dream" hero added while making his way to the piano already waiting for disaster to strike
>"the usual you say? you always were a man of routines but having the same dream sounds like a bit much"
>"hmm.. is not like one chooses what he dreams or when he has nightmares, brains are just dumb like that"
>"true but when we are sleeping our brains lets out everything, is only natural if we hold negatives thoughts they will manifest sooner rather than later"
>she stopped playing for a moment
>"you have been holding this one for a while now haven't you?"
>"is weird... now that i know the dream is a complete lie, it should hurt me yet is hard to move past it"
>"is hard to move past things that you carry around everywhere"
>playing the piano again she continued "why don't let other people carrier that weight with you? is not as hard of you think it is"
>with a deep breath hero said "we are having a picnic and is just.. perfect" a small smile take over him "i have a neckless i wanted to gift to you hiding in the picnic basket, when the time is right i show it to you, you look so happy and... i feel at peace like I am complete..."
>"but after that... when i put the neckless on you... you are not touching the ground anymore....swinging in the wind"
>"henry.."
>"in the worst days, you start to talk, telling me all the horrible things that i did to you, how i failed you, how i didn't listen to you... h-how" hero can't continue as he begging to tear up
>however, Mari wasn't going to let him spiral again, not this time



>"you always were so hard on yourself and, to be frank, your memory isn't the best"
>"w-what"
>"in that situation, i will be asking you for a ladder or scissors not talking you down with lies! that not like me at all"
>"back them i didn't--"
>"even them henry... even then you should have known it wasn't your fault..."

>"do you remember the first time we hold hands together?
>*snif* like I could forget I was going to prove I was better than you in math"
>"so we did a little bet.."
>"loser does whatever the winner wants" the fondness of the memory warmed his heart" I was so done when we both got a perfect score"
>"so we decided that whoever does one math problem the fastes will be the winner"
>" in hindsight asking kel for a math problem was a bad idea"
>"i don't think so, the bad idea was getting confused at how simple it was instead of just screaming the answer like I did"
>"IT WAS 2+2!!!"
>"4 , see is not that hard hehe"
>"and you asked for-"
>"holding your hand for the rest of the day, you were crimson for the rest of the day, hehe, even Kel was worry about you, you know?"
>"no one believed me that we weren't actually dating after that..."
>"worked like a charm"
>"that was your plan?!?"
>"i have to secure the monopoly before anyone else"
>"you could... just ask me out"
>I wanted to one-up you just to be sure you were a good loser and you were! better than me at least..
>mari smile disappeared for a moment
>"mari... I am sure Sunny feel terrible about it"
>"what is done is done, besides i know for a fact Sunny had it hard this last 4 years, he need you and everyone else"
>"i be there this time, i not so sure about Basil"
>"henry"
>"I am not a psychologist, where did i even begin with him?
>"just be there as a friend, trust me it will be more than enough"

>hero quick glance was meet with his favorite,a smug smile
>"you know what I mean! to be just myself instead of the prodigy that everyone looks up to.... but never at eye level..."
>"what about Kel? he genuinely cares about you"
>"i don't want to hurt him... not again"
>"being honest with your brother isn't going to hurt him hero, he is better at keeping secrets than you think"
>"I am don't know about that one"
>"you never knew the whole math problem was rigged from the start"
>"no way! i know when he is lying"
>"did you ever ask him?"
>"i-i don't think so..."
>"hiding in plain sight, no something that you associate with Kel but is true!"
>"but why?"
>"when i told him what i was going to ask you, he was more than happy to help me out"
>"huh... he really is street smart after all..."
>"tell me something, have you being seeing anyone?"
>"OF COURSE NOT!"
>"henry... you need to move on, you know?"
>"after how it ended last time.. i didn't feel ready, and no one in colleague grabbed my attention as you did anyway"
>this piqued Mari's curiosity "so someone did outside of colleague?"
>"i would go THAT far, i just meet her and i just think she is interesting that all"

>instinctively he rushed to hug her "no, not again, please"
>"i glad I could say my goodbyes to everyone, I knew if a visited you first I was never going to want to leave"
>"i beg you... please"
>"do me a favor"
>"ANYTHING"
