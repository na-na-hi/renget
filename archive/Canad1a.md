Northern Town by anonymous & Mastermind

>Ywn move to a far northern company town
>Everybody is either a miner, a lumberjack, or an amenities worker with the same, single company
>The surrounding nature is beautiful, but the temperatures are low, the days are long with the hours of sunlight short, and the work is hard
>It's also a couple hundred miles away from almost any other form of civilization, deep in the boreal forest
>It's mostly species that can weather the intense cold and isolation with grace, with reindeer, different types of bears, arctic foxes, the occasional snow leopard, and a smattering of other thick-furred species
>Everybody there worries and dotes over making sure that the only human there is warm, often taking off their jackets to give to you even though you're fine
>Perhaps they just they're just doing it because they enjoy taking their clothes off around you
>The long, cold nights and isolation have a way of making all of the workers a bit... desperate for intimacy, after all
>And you know what they say about lumberjacks

>quarrels about who gets to keep the human warm that night break out almost every evening
>human is urged to share bed with the winner
>even though most of the anthros are pent up from not having sex for way too long, none of them has the balls to actually start anything with you aside from intense sniffing, cuddling and licking your bare skin while you're caught in a tight embrace
>feeling hot, throbbing anthro cock press against your back when they're asleep and dreaming doesn't make you get much sleep yourself
>looks like you need to make the first move

>Big tough lumberjacks starting actual barfights to get in bed with you
>And then being too much of a loveshy softie once they've actually got you in their bed to actually start anything

>Incessant arguing and the occasional brawl over whose fur is the nicest, warmest, fluffiest, nicest smelling, etc etc
>So naturally, now that there's a human in town, they're going to get you, the one without fur, to settle it
>You can't walk 10 feet throughout town without some anthro attempting to bear hug you, glue themselves to you, or otherwise trying to get you to pet them
