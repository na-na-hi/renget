>Party games with monsters!

%darkgreen%\>In the middle of the festivities with the other anons and their monster partners, you feel a small tug at your pant leg

\>its slightly burned and and crumpled but its binding is held in place by some kind of shiny silver scale?
\>excusing yourself from the larger group you take a short walk while gently cutting open the bindings on the envelope with your knife
\>more red dust shakes free from the letter as it folds down, it has an overwhelming scent of something familiar mixed with charcoal
\>dusting it free you look it up and down as you barely manage to make out the chicken scratch of whatever someone wrote for you

\>"you have about 10 minutes to find somewhere to hide before i grab you for snuggles"
\>"there are no limits to hiding places inside or outside, it wont stop me.."
\>"Forever your lovable Argent Comet -Val"
\>you feel your heart sink as you realize whats about to happen, the anxiety in the air could almost be cut by a knife.

>So what are the ecological benefits to fucking the monsters?

As shared in [this](https://rentry.org/2f8so/#jaggia) travelogue, fucked monsters are largely docile, resulting in an alternative method to calm a rampaging beast. Sometimes, all a Lucent Nargacuga needs is an outlet for her sexual frustrations! That same log also points out a hidden benefit to fucking monsters: it is a fast and easy way to gather monster materials on the fly, such as shed scales and "monster fluid".
Of course, any licensed Monster Fucker is obligated to check in with their local Guild office before hand! A village needs to be able to handle fending off a clingy Elder Dragon, or even a long-term residence from such a beast if our Monster Fucker decides to settle down for a married lifeâ€”an all-too-common occurrence between Monster Fuckers!
Now, does anyone else from the class have a question, before we return to our lesson on the history of Monster Fucking in the Hunter's Guild?

>Oh me, me! I-I have a few questions...
>How does one get started in this "monster fucking"? What are the recommended monsters to practice this activity? Does The Guild offer some service? How do we know if a monster would accept us as their... uh, companion?

We'll be having a "101" course on that branch of the guild soon enough. We do have a moment however... I'll answer your questions briefly, in order: on-boarding for Monster Fucking comes only after your earn your Hunter's License. Once you graduate you can sign on for extra courses here at the academy. There's extra coursework for any vocation here; I'd recommend them for all Hunters! There's no recommended monster for "fucking" in much the same way that we have no recommended monster for "hunting"! Your local guild office will judge which jobs you can and cannot handle, just like a regular Hunt. What was your next question...? Ah, yes... If you want to know whether a Monster is accepting of your advances, I suppose you'd better attend those post-graduate lessons, and see if you can earn a Monster Fucker's License! Reading a Monster's body language is not a small task, and a subject I could not possibly describe sufficiently in a short summary. If you really want to learn more, hit the Canteen and see if you can catch someone willing to regale you with some of their more...uh, shall we say, "carnal" conquests.
All right class, it's time to continue our lessons in "Esoteric Arrow Coatings"! Please turn your attention to the plials that were passed out by my lovely assistant while I was answering Anon's questions. Feel free to crack it open; take a whiff! Quite unpleasant, yes? That phial contains a "Dung Coating", the purpose of which I will be explaining to you shortly... Oh, and do try to remember that the chemistry of a coating only becomes fully active when struck with violent force... Try not to drop your phials if you value your good social standing here at the Academy, yes...?

>So is there a reason I SHOULDN'T fuck the monsters?

I must say, you are one of the most persistent students I've had in years! Since class is over for the day, I should have time for a few more of your questions. I'll start by saying you shouldn't start a fuck you can't finish! Across the years, many humans have started a relationship with a monster that ended poorly for their locale. For that reason, only the Guild can approve a "Monsters Fucking" quest, or monster fucking activities. If a non-hunter wants to start a relationship or is already in one, they should get approval from the Guild to continue. Too many times across history has a jealous Dragon razed a village to the ground, or a hungry lover eaten her neighbors out of house and home! Er, where was I...? Yes, there are other reasons NOT to fuck monsters! You need an unusual tolerance for punishment, and a LOT of endurance. Monster lovers aren't easy to endure, unless they have a lot of practice at being gentle. You also need a VERY keen eye for which monsters want a good fucking to begin with, and you need great skill to to understand a monster's body language, as well as to communicate your own. Many fuckable monsters will also simply be beyond your level of skill. Many monster fuckers will struggle with a simple Jaggia... Found the next day fucked halfway to death in a pile of Jaggi and Jaggia! (Oh, to be young again...)
Basically, your local Guild office will keep tabs on which listed Quests may have a fuckable monster, and you'll need a Monster Fucker License before the Guild will divulge any of that information. Then, you can accept the Quest just like any other...your very own Monster Fucker Quest!
