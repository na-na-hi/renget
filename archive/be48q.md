>The Spinda sat motionless for hours with a simple pink bow gently wrapped around the left ear
>Keeping her composure
>The young man who calls her friend sat nearby
>She was trained specifically for this
>To never move and just be a toy
>It came with a life of luxury when everyone was asleep
>But the role must not be broken during the day
>Despite the horror stories, she was very well treated
>Always the favorite
>Taken on car trips and vacations
>So many wonderful years
>But that time was fading
>The young boy is slowly becoming a young man
>Less time for toys these days
>It was a little lonely but expected
>Someday her role would be finished
>What would happen after that is unknown
>Best not to think about it now
>However, one thing has changed in the routine
>He has started taking her back to bed to cuddle
>Like all those years ago
>Oh well, once he falls asleep it is still freedom
>What is waiting a couple more hours

>The behaviour carried over night after night
>Taken to bed
>Be held
>Wait for the young man to sleep
>Clock out for the night
>But lately, his dreams have been restless
>His body jumps and shakes slightly
>And the grip would tighten more and more until he just...
>Let go
>Some kind of nightmare maybe?
>Once the dream was over he was guaranteed to be out cold
>Always slipped out of his arms and had the night alone
>It was a little worrisome, but nothing time won't fix
>But as more of these nights carried on, his behaviour changed suite
>Becoming a little more distant from family
>More frequent showers and extended bathroom breaks
>And something on his phone completely enamoured him from time to time
>Gradually, this strange shift in his demeanour and personality became more prominent
>And she was soon to learn why
>One day, the family left the young man alone at home
>Laying in his bed, he was back to staring intently at his phone
>The heavy breathing came back
>He twisted his hips from side to side
>To relieve some of the discomfort
>His mind was running back and forth
>Making him lean up and scan the room
>It was then, the twos eyes met
>Still sitting as pretty as ever, the Spinda sat perfectly on the shelf.
>The small and supple form was cleanly traced by some yearning eyes
>A decision was being made
>He shook with the thoughts
>Before succumbing to the desires
>Standing up, he walks over to her and gently picks her up above his head.
>She kept that warm smile he always found such comfort in
>And those lovely little swirls paired swimmingly with the scattered spots on the little face
>He smiled, before pulling her close for a deep embrace
>It was heard she could hear his rapid heartbeat
>And the breathing matched the pace
>He spun around and carried her back to bed
>A little early for a nap, but maybe he needs it
>She was then gently placed on his chest
>Before the phone was pulled out again

>A silence, before his hand slowly rose and started tracing her hips
>Sensually and softly
>She almost twitched from the sudden shift in intimacy
>But she must keep that composure
>His fingers traveled up and down her soft back, before dropping down and giving her little rear a squeeze
>If he wasn't glued to his screen those little swirls widening in shock would have been far too noticeable
>Her heart was now picking up pace
>She had never touched like this before
>Despite her best efforts, the more he played with her body the shakier her breaths got
>The young man licked his lips before taking his hand off of her
>Leaning up, he repositioned her to sit firmly on the sheets between his legs
>Another quick swipe of the hand down, and she could hear him unzipping his pants
>Before exposing himself to her
>With some force, he grabbed her back and slammed her soft stomach and chest onto the side of his erection
>He did not hesitate
>The wonderfully soft fur gently tickled the tip as he grinded himself against her
>The phone at this point was locked and tossed aside
>His eyes sat closed as he pictured something with intensity
>Those hips of his began to thrust
>Bits of precum loosened themselves from the tip and stuck to the bottom of her chin
>Faster and faster
>The young man could keep himself calm any more
>He looked down and saw the familiar smile he always knew
>Never changing
>Always there for him
>He let go of her back, allowing her to fall daintily backwards
>His grip returned to her legs, squeezing them tightly together while making sure to keep his dick in between them
>The ribbon was pulled off from her ear and used to bind them together
>He tried thrusting a little more, but the fur was still a little too dry
>So he lightly spits onto his fingers and massaged the Spinda's inner thighs
>At this point her body and mind were fighting every signal
>Should she stop him?
>No, she made a promise

>She let his hands take control
>From here, he happily pounded against her
>Loving watching his throbbing and aching cock push back and forth
>That little ticklish feeling paired wonderfully with the waves of pleasure
>He gave a warm smile back while gently massaging her ears
>Within minutes, he cried out as he finally reached his climax
>The pent frustrations poured onto his friend
>Covering her face completely
>Some of it even slowly started rolling down into her eyes
>Realizing it, he took off his shirt and quickly wiped her down
>After making sure she was clean enough, he untied the bow and put it back in its rightful place
>Picked her up and softly thanked her
>Before falling backwards and going to sleep
>She sat motionless until she was sure it was safe
>Then quickly ran to the bathroom to clean up proper
>Making sure to put herself back to the same level of cleanliness from before
>She double-checked and made sure everything was in order
>Before running back to the room and climbing back up on the shelf
>Some hours passed and the family came home
>The young man awoke from his name being called
>His eyes looked around the room
>Once again, the eyes meet
>He gave another warm smile before leaving the room
>He was happy, and as long as that was the fact...
>So was she

>days pass
>The young man had not attempted anything since then
>In fact, he would look over at her and feel a bit of shame
>She had not left her spot on the shelf
>every now and again he would get the urge
>but would go back to using the bathroom and shower
>the spinda would never admit it to herself, but this saddened her
>she wanted him to keep playing with her like that
>using her to make himself feel good
>easing those tensions
>nothing would make her happier
>more days pass
>she watched as he became more irritable
>trying everything he could to reach the same nirvana
>but nothing could ever match it
>his desperation for that release grew ever more
>however, he just couldnt bring himself to do it again
>very slowly, the spinda grew tired of watching him struggle
>so a plan was put into action
>during family dinner she hopped off the shelf
>to do her usual routine of stretching from being stiff all day
>then very quietly jumped onto his bed and slid under the sheets
>took a second to find a way to hide her long ears
>and waited until eventually the young man decided to sleep for the night
>in no time, he was cleaned and ready for bed
>didnt even bother turning the light on
>and slid underneath the comfort of the familiar blanket
>minutes pass
>a bit of tossing and turning
>mind racing
>those feeling were coming back
>in his more erratic movements, he bumps into something soft
>and warm
>this makes him jump a bit before reaching down to feel what it was
>that wonderful and soft fur is gently rubbed
>he shakes a bit, before peeling back the blankets
>a little bit of moonlight illuminates the room
>the faint shape of his dear doll lay beside him
>double checking, the shelf was indeed empty

>the flustered man tries to piece together in his mind how
>did he put her there?
>she has never done anything like this before
>taking a finger he traces down her back
>starting from the shoulder
>the fur had little struggle lightly separating and moving aside
>small but supple curves makes his finger rise and fall as he approached the hip
>eventually stopping partway down the leg
>the spinda was trying her best
>little tickles like this makes it hard
>must keep composure for as long as possible
>but she noticed something
>his breathing slowed
>the gentle finger slowly rised back up
>whatever was keeping him from going any further with her was disintegrating
>a pause, before he picked her up
>hands underneath the arms
>suspending her in the air
>the room was still to dark to see any real detail
>but he new where every inch of her was
>and he was going to take it
>starting by kissing her gently on the right cheek
>the sliding over to kiss those small lips
>being this close, he can feel her tiny and subdued breaths
>but she would not kiss back
>he sighs
>then gets a small grin
>if she wants to still be a toy
>then its time to be played with however he likes
>he placed her back down
>on her back with head on pillow
>he waits a moment, before placing his thumb in her chin
>and starts pulling it down
>making her mouth open
>wider and wider
>before leaning down onto her and kissing her again
>he did hesitate in sliding his tongue into her
>happily using his to toss hers around
>those hands slide down again
>feeling every inch of her chest
>the spinda's heart had starting pumping into overdrive
>she thought it be like before
>just grinding against her
>she wasn't sure what to do as his hands left her chest
>he breaks away from the kiss
>then closes her mouth
>he waits again, before grabbing her legs
>pulling them apart
>for the first time, he hears her
>she gives a small gasp from the sudden overtaking
>such a cute noise
>he wonders if he could be blessed with more
>using his middle finger he starts feeling up the inner thigh
>getting closer and closer to her cute slit
>until he gently places his finger in between her folds
>he listens
>no sound
>must be trying her best not to make a peep
>that same finger now starts sliding up and down
>making sure to apply even pressure and circle her clit
>despite her best efforts
>those legs slowly start twitching

>this makes him bite his bottom lip
>if he keeps going like this, he can break her
>and he wants to
>overtime he felt his finger getting wetter and wetter
>he pulls it back
>taking in her smells
>and giving it a gentle lick
>she taste...
>good
>REALLY good
>his heavy breathing slowly returns
>he wants more of this unique flavor
>so he takes his hands and grabs her small legs
>holding them firmly apart as he brings his head down
>his warmth breath can be felt on her now wet folds
>making her twitch just a little more
>before diving in
>making sure to lap up every little bit he could get
>generous and slow lick overtake her sensitve nerves
>making another gasp try and escape
>he couldnt see it, but she raised her arms to cover her mouth
>trying to muffle her moans
> however, this only let him hear her exhale from the nose
>showing he was doing wonders
>the slow movements picked up
>making her breathing harder and faster
>she had given up on her legs at this point to try and put full focus on the noises she was making
>giving way and shaking to the waves of pleasure
>seeing an opportunity he lets go of one leg and brings that middle finger back
>and during his tongue dance he happily slid his finger insider her
>she squeezes her face, but to no avail
>audible little squeaks erupt
>he brings his face back up
>so he can watch the figure in the shadows squirm
>he continuiosly drives his finger into her
>at this point her consciousness was turning into a haze
>its all happened so fast
>she couldn't think
>he just kept going and going
>until finally, she couldn't fight it
>reflexively, everything in her body tightens
>before bursting into an orgasm
>she screams into her hands
>loud enough for him to hear
>her legs instinctively squeeze together
>sliding from his grip
>he quickly pulls out his finger
>and lets her feel it out
>constant twitching and heavy breathing

>he wants her to feel as good about it as possible
>so he starts gently messaging one of her long ears
>the ribbon lightly taps against his wrist as he assures her
>and in no time, her muscles let go
>finally letting her collapse from the powerful orgasm
>she couldnt keep her grip anymore
>as those little hands fall beside her
>her breath shakes
>the young man is pleased with what he hears
>now, its his turn
>he doesnt want anything getting in the way
>so he quickly drops his pants and tosses them aside
>the spinda was still lost to even realize what was happening
>he feels the precum already dripping from himself
>taking a bit off of the top with a finger, he gently places it in her mouth
>letting her taste him too
>before placing himself right on top
>for a moment, he grinds the tip in between her sensitive pussy lips
>she was still rather sensitive
>making her quickly raise the arms back up
>but this time he notices
>so he grabs them and slams them up
>she squirms to try and break free
>but to no avail
>knowing how good she feels on his tip, he could only imagine what being inside must feel like
>with a little more positioning, he lines himself up
>a strong silence overtakes the room
>before he drives himself inside her
>this was too much
>she cries out
>her back arches
>he slides deeper and deeper before bottoming her out
>the pressure was intense
>the young man knew such a small body would be a tight fit
>but this was far more than even he thought
>more and more noises escape her
>cries, moans, small bouts of shaking fear
>all so wonderful to hear erupt from the little panda
>it was difficult, but he tried moving
>but the sensation was incredibly potent
>making him join her in the sounds
>in due time her sounds became more and more erotic
>she continues fighting his grip, but it was a losing battle from the start
>back and forth his hips move
>picking up pace
>until he was pounding into her
>sounds of skin slapping against the wet fur echoed the room

>no more holding back for the both of them
>their voices blended, melding into every other sound
>making music, music of love
>he keeps driving and driving
>until...
>he just couldnt keep together
>giving one final thrust before completely dumping his load into her
>she screams
>the feeling of the pressure change was apparent
>and the cum harshly dumped itself filling her
>he coudnt stand the tightness any longer
>pulling out
>the young man falls back
>trying to recover himself now
>the spinda felt his seed leak out of her
>mixing into her fur
>another few minute pass
>her sounds slowly dissipate
>eventually returning to the familiar quiet
>with a slight jump, the now drained man turns on the lamp sitting next to his bed
>her face was as it always was
>that gentle smile sat firmly
>but tear stains are visible on the fur
>and another glance down shows how much he made a mess of her
>the wave of guilt returns
>he quickly picks her up and takes her to the bathroom
>where he spends a long time cleaning her up
>making sure to restore her to full beauty
>after doing everything he could
>she is taken back to bed
>where he holds her close
>and gently kisses her ear
>thanking her for everything she has done for him
>before finally falling asleep
>the spinda at this point can no longer put together everything that just happened
>all that matters now

>is that he is happy again
