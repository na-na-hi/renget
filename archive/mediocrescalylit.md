**Dragon's Curse: Elixir Quest** (2012) by Sean Walton 
Historical Fiction (TF/xenofiction)
Part 1 of a three book series and also a prequel series to the author's main work.
This novel would be worth putting on the main page if not for the bad pacing and medieval prose. If you try really, really hard maybe you might be able to mentally gloss over it. Should be noted that the main protag gets cucked by his human wife but ends up settling with a nice, strong-willed dragoness.

**Lazy Scales** (2020) by DM Gilmore 
Urban Fantasy (TF)
The last dragon on Earth seeks to propagate his species. An ordinary high school student has a very ~~lucky~~ unlucky day. Part of a series of 9 novellas. To be honest, the plot and prose are mediocre and things only really start to get interesting by books 5 and 7. Although the story tries to be dramatic at points, the world is very hard to take seriously when the author "subtly" inserts their fetishes into the story (holy shit there's no legal repercussions to vore).

**My Name is Simon: I, Dragon** (2016) by Nathan Roden

**Becoming the Dragon: A Fantasy Saga** (2017) by Alex Sapegin
Fantasy (isekai/reincarnation)
Couldn't finish this because the prose was giving me a migraine. I apologize for not giving the author a chance but this reads like they put Russian directly into google translate.

**Tesser: A Dragon Among Us: A Reemergence Novel** (2014) by Chris Philbrook 
Urban Fantasy
A dragon wakes up in the modern world. He goes around on a power trip having sex with human women. I'm sure some people would enjoy this but he's mentally closer to a feral human who acts like your standard ubermensch hollywood protagonist and spends like 99% of the novel in his human form and being crass the moment he learns about human expletives.
