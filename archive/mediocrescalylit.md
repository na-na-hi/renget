**Dragon's Curse: Elixir Quest** (2012) by Sean Walton 
Historical Fiction (TF/xenofiction)
Part 1 of a three book series and also a prequel series to the author's main work.
This novel would be worth putting on the main page if not for the bad pacing and medieval prose. If you try really, really hard maybe you might be able to mentally gloss over it. Should be noted that the main protag gets cucked by his human wife but ends up settling with a nice, strong-willed dragoness.

**Dragons of Etra** (2021-2022) by Chester Young
Fantasy (xenofiction)
A Wings of Fire-esque novel that hits all of the standard cliches of a typical rogue/assassin fantasy and the series as a whole seems to be attempting to achieve a world record of cramming as many dragon tropes as possible in the entirety of 2 books. As a side note, the author does has a passion for rider (bonding) and dragon pov stories, and even keeps his own list of dragon literature on his website.
**Dragons of Etra Book 1: The Forgotten Element**
*no ISBN, e-book only*
> **DC 4.75/5**
> ~~Humans are basically treated as mythological creatures that don't exist.~~ They do in the second book. 3.75/5
> **CA 5/5**
> See above. Wyvern-riding and mental bonding exists in the second novel, however.
> **PS 2/5**
> Sort of does run into the same pitfalls as Wings of Fire where dragons seem to have almost the same socioeconomic issues and societies as humans.

**Fire of the Phoenix** (2021) by Azariah Jade
Fantasy (xenofiction)
A coming of age story that begins when a terrible calamity falls upon a hatchling's clan, forcing him into exile with the burden of a horrible curse. This would be in the main page if not for the pacing of the latter half of the novel.
**ISBN-13** 979-8452680505
> **DC 3.75/5**
> This product may contain humans.
> **CA 4/5**
> **PS 3/5**
> The "curse" and its source acts as the main antagonist of the story, with humans playing a relatively minor role. More focus is given to the different customs between dragon clans and their way of life.
