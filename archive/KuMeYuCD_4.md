Miko's wish.
 
Aya: It's morning! Time to wake up! Let's do our best at our duties today!
 
Suz: Mmm... Wonderful, Ayaya. I'm feeling healed already.
 
Meb: What are you doing in my room?
 
Yum: Heh. Recording　Kokudo-san's voice to the terminal, of course.
 
Meb: Yeah, but why in my room?
 
Suz: Being woken up by Ayaya's voice will let me trudge through the harsh days! Or that's the idea.
 
Aya: I'm happy I can be useful, at least like this.
 
Suz: Alright, now give me a "good night" voice.
 
Aya: Okay. Thanks for your hard work today. Let's say our thanks to Shinju-sama and have nice dreams.
 
Suz:　Fantastic... Perfect score there, Ayaya~!
 
Yum: Should I provide a sample of my voice, as well? *cough* I wish you most pleasant dreams~.
 
Suz: Cut it out, you dropped the score to 80.
 
Yum: Now excuse me, why did it drop?
 
Meb: I still don't understand why you have to be doing this in my room.
 
Yum: We simply end up gathering here unconsciously.
 
Shi: It's easy to relax here.
 
Suz: Shizuku, you were here?
 
Shi: I'm here pretty often.
 
Aya: A great leader is someone people admire. This is the result of your personal qualities, Mebuki-senpai.
 
Shi: This.
 
Suz:　We gather together, talk about pointless things and deepen our friendship... Isn't that alright, Mebu?
 
Shi: Maybe I'll bring some of my stuff here.
 
Suz: I'll　stock up on sweets and stuff then.
 
Meb: Alright, you bunch, don't go deciding things without me. We have to get up early tomorrow. Shoo, shoo.
 
Suz: The recording session isn't over yet! I want several versions of Ayaya's wakeup call!
 
Meb: I'll pitch in as well then. SUZUME! WAKE UP!
 
Suz: Mebu, don't record your growling!
 
Aya: Suzume-senpai, do you maybe want me to come wake you up in person?
 
Suz: Eh? Will you?
 
Aya: Yeah! Kokudo Aya will do her best!
 
Suz: Uuuu... You're such a good girl...
 
Meb:　Suzume. I understand you, but you're being too indulgent.
 
Suz: If you understand me, you could just ask her too, Mebu.
 
Meb: Hmmm?..
 
Suz: My bad, I said too much!
 
Aya: I could wake you up too, Mebuki-senpai.
 
Meb: Eh?
 
Aya: How about it?
 
Meb: Then... Please do.
 
Aya: Okay! I'll do my best!
 
Shi: It's unusual for Kusunoki to act like this.
 
Yum: Kokudo-san has something about her that softens you up. Similar to my broad-mindedness... Motherliness!
 
Shi: Uh-huh.
 
Yum: Just like me, Kokudo-san has that inborn nature!
 
Shi: Sure thing.
 
Yum: As her senpai, were I to lead Kokudo-san!
 
Shi: I so know what you mean.
 
Yum: Heh. Shizuku-san, I see that you have grown to understand me.
 
Suz: I'm pretty sure she's just answering at random... Anyway, I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning! La-la-la!
 
Aya: Next morning...
 
Meb: This is... Miyoshi Karin!
 
Kar: What are you so surprised about?
 
Meb: I see, so this must be a dream. But even if it's a dream, I don't plan on losing. Miyoshi Karin! Let's fight!
 
Kar: I'll take you up on that!
 
Aki: The battle will be fought in the form of a variety show.
 
Meb/Kar: Why!?
 
Meb: ...Why comedy?
 
Aya: Wake up please. Mebuki-senpai. Senpai!
 
Meb: Aya-chan?
 
Aya: That's right!
 
Meb: I'm still sleeping then. Aya-chan, you go to sleep too.
 
Aya: Wah! Mebuki-senpai! You're not sleeping!
 
Meb: Huh? Aya-chan!? Oh right, I asked you to wake me up.
 
Aya: Good morning, Mebuki-senpai.
 
Meb: Thanks. Good morning, Aya-chan. Sorry, I was still half asleep just now. I'll go wash up.
 
Aya: Don't worry. I came a little early, so there's still time.
 
Meb: I see.
 
Aya: I'll make some tea.
 
Meb: It's nice to be able to do morning preparations without rushing.
 
Aya: Lets you start off the day pleasantly, doesn't it?
 
Meb: Aya-chan, would you mind waking me up like this occasionally?
 
Aya: Of course! I'm glad to be useful like this, since all a Miko can usually do is pray.
 
Meb: Thanks. But don't you need to go and wake Suzume up now?
 
Aya: Actually...
 
Aki: Shouldn't you wake up already? You're being slovenly.
 
Suz: Ayaya, five more minutes...
 
Aki: There is no Ayaya here.
 
Suz: Eh? Who are you then? Mebu?
 
Aki: Refrain from touching me all over.
 
Suz: Aaagh!?
 
Aki: Looks like you're awake.
 
Suz: W-What are you doing here, Sensei!?
 
Aki: I saw Kokudo-san on this floor and heard about this from her.
 
Suz: Egh...
 
Aki: You're putting too much pressure on the Miko.
 
Suz: ...I'm sorry.
 
Aki: But you've been performing quite well as of late. In respect of that...
 
Suz: Huh?
 
Aki: I'll be waking you up from now on.
 
Suz: Eek! No, thank you!
 
Aki: Please begin getting ready now.
 
Suz: If this is a dream, I wanna wake up...
 
Aki: I can hear you.
 
Suz: Aaa, I'm sorry, I'll get ready now!
 
Aki: You have five minutes. 300, 299, 298...
 
Suz: Aaaaagh! Save me, Mebu!
 
Aki: 295...
