*I watched blindly as the verdant scenery passed me by on the wagon. Has it really been almost 15 years since I arrived, since everything happened? Time sure flies when you're sleeping in ditches and alleyways...*

I remember it like it was yesterday, because the world won't let me forget. When the entire land places you on a pedestal because of your origins and the hopeful tales of ancient seers, you're doing your best to keep that illusion up unless you're wanting to risk losing a lot of support and momentum for that very purpose in the first place.

Boy, I sure fucking nailed that last part. I'm maybe getting a little ahead of myself here...


The name's Turquoise, or Turk for short. I'm a human, or at least I was a long time ago. Now I'm something called a Lucario, which is typically a blue, walking, talking dog, but the caveat with me is that I have titular turquoise fur, and these days I look like I went through a wood chipper... There'll be more on that later. I was transported to the Pokemon World by the bastardly machinations of fate to become a messiah for the archeological and mining community of Stover City, partially nestled in the craggy depths of the Skyridge Mountains. From a glance, you wouldn't know the peeking structures rising above the ground were the tips of great spires that went underground. It was quite a mesmerizing place.

The ancient Gemseer Diancie foretold of my arrival long before I tumbled across space and time into the depths of what is known as a Mystery Dungeon. They are labyrinthine structures made of reality-defying arrangements in the environment that are full of violent, illusory Pokemon, hidden traps, and countless treasures. Naturally, such anomalies make up a cornerstone of the world's culture and economy. It was a good thing because it's what allowed my former partner and best companion, Charcadet, to find me.

%gray%*"Wow, a human? You're joking. You almost look like any other Riolu! Ah... Hold still; this'll probably feel weird for aÂ  moment."The little spry and cheery armored creature administered a poultice of some sort to a bad cut I sustained to my leg while wandering the dungeon alone, enduring all kinds of feral Pokemon and traps. I shuddered in discomfort as the Oran berry juice and herb mixture did its thing. He helped pull me to my feet and patted me on the back. "Come on, the exit should be only one more floor away!" *%%

I was introduced to the Exacadrill Company, a Pokemon guild of miners, archeologists, explorers, and adventurers who plundered the mystery dungeons that manifested deep beneath the ground. It was led by the company's namesake, Foreman Excadrill, a large mole-like Pokemon with a gruff but cheery disposition who was constantly trying to beat the guild's yearly quota on resources. It was one of the Grass Continent's major sources of emera. They are magical gems that manifest within certain dungeon environments and could be set inside special accessories to harness their powers. I quickly made many friends and explored the continent's many scenic locales as a member of the company. My legacy in the Pokemon World was being written with every footstep.

%gray%*"Well, crack my stones. It's right here! This tablet here says a Riolu with unusual fur would be found in the Omenfall Vaults beneath the city! That place was sealed for centuries!" Foreman Exacadrill sets the ornate crystalline slab back on a table of similar artifacts. He looked toward me with an assuring smile. "Well, lad, what do you say about joining us? Charcadet vouches for you, and I'd trust him with my life! Trust me, you'll love it here!" I rubbed my paws together anxiously, gazing at the confines of the archive room before nodding excitedly at the big mole-like Pokemon. He laughed boisterously as he led me back into the main hall. *%%

With my arrival being quite literally written in Diancie's gemstones, I felt a sense of pride and empowerment that I had never felt before in my miserable life. As a human, I was to be a 'gifted child' with great expectations for my skills. I burned out pretty quickly from those high expectations as my mental health failed from the stress, and I dropped out of school in short order and became a social pariah to the world. I spent my time getting fucked up on drugs, drinking, playing video games, and shitposting on 4chan during what was probably the height of the website's history. I was an anon with the worst of them. Was being reborn as a Riolu in this world a second chance to make up for a wasted life?

I wish that was the case...

As the days turned to weeks and the weeks to months, the destiny of my arrival slowly became more clear. I was divinely chosen to lead a team of adventurers to stop the release of creatures known as Ultra Beasts. Ages ago, the Ultra Beasts were conjured from across the rifts of reality by a mad king to become their harbingers of authority and destruction. The king's machinations were stopped swiftly with the power of a cosmic, legendary Pokemon. A cult claiming to be the heirs of this forgotten Sternenschwert Kingdom was aspiring to continue their past king's work and regain their former glory. We had to stop them before this threat was unleashed upon our world. We fought adamantly and bravely. Many sacrifices were made, and lives were lost. Our journey returned us to where it all began, where I was first found deep within the Omenfall Vaults underneath Skyridge Mountain. until that dreaded confrontation happened...

%gray%*"Ah, little Turk and his sniveling friends have arrived, right on time as usual. Once again, you've come to try and stop my aspirations. You're too late, once and for all." The party of heroes that constituted Charcadet, Mudkip, Sprigatito, and I stood as the heir apparent to the lost Sternenschwert Kingdom, Kingambit VIII. The Pokemon stroked and sharpened his bladed hand against the equally sharp edges of his mustache as he looked down upon us from the pedestal in the ancient and ornate chamber, adorned with glowing symbols and murals alluding to the mysteries of the Ultra Beasts and their jailers. "With the Ultra Globe finally in my possession, I will be able to open the rift between dimensions and bring the most powerful of Ultra Beasts under my control!" Charcadet stamped his foot and furrowed his fiery eyes at the power-hungry Pokemon. "You can't control them without the Z-crystals! It'll just consume you like it did your ancestors and your kingdom!" Each of us drew out a crystal from our persons and raised them as a show of our unity and conviction against Kingambit. He looked perturbed as he held the orb high. "Silence! I do not need that trinket! With these artificial awakening emera, I'll have more than enough power to subdue Necrozma! Behold my ascension as once and forever king!" *%%

%gray%*In a spectacle of blinding kaleidoscopic light, the altar chamber's walls and ceiling were consumed by an otherworldly plane of existence filled with swirling stars and nebulae. Floating in the middle of the void was the dormant form of a massive Pokemon of black crystalline matter of extra-dimensional origin. It was Necrozma, the Prism Pokemon. Its eyes flared to life with color as its body slowly shook off a sleep of over several thousand years. It let out an earsplitting roar that vibrated the very space around us. Kingambit laughed maniacally as the scene unfolded. "Yes... YES! RISE NECROZMA, RISE AND BE MINE!" He held up his wrist, holding the awakening emera wristlet, unleashing its power alongside the glowing Ultra Sphere in an attempt to bind the Pokemon to his will. Try as he might, Necrozma's will was stronger than that of the artificial power the pretender king had made for himself with his family's stolen riches and the blood, sweat, and tears he spilled of the countless Pokemon under his servitude. Necrozma reared back, eating the very stars out of the sky as it charged up its power and destroyed Kingambit in a single onslaught of prismatic laser beams. "No... NO! NOT LIKE THIS! NOT LIKE THIS! GUWWAAAAAAAAAH!!!" *%%

%gray%* I recall looking onward in horror at what we were facing. This entity could absorb the light around it and funnel it into a very powerful weapon. We may have been way over our heads and underprepared for something of this magnitude. I was so confident until that moment, too. We sent so many of these monsters back to where they came from until this point. Why was it that until this moment I felt unease? "Fuck! We have to stop this here and now! Everyone gets in position! We need to use the Z-crystals to call forth both Solgaleo and Lunala! Charcadet, we have the dawn crystals! Sprigatito, Mudkip, you have the dusk crystals! We need to summon both at once, or this won't work! Stay on the defensive! Use every item we have at our disposal. This is the last battle!" *%%

%gray%* We charged into the fray, dodging lasers and swiping claws. Fatal rainbows of color threatened to eliminate us at the subatomic level as we ran across a glassy horizon of stars and planets. Our crystals began to slowly charge from the stellar energies as we fought. All felt like it would go according to plan until Charcadet was struck down into a crumpled heap by a mistimed evasive leap, while the others were pinned down by constant showers of laser energy. He would die right then and there, along with our chances of stopping this threat. In a panic, I ran toward the artificial emera that lay beside the smoldering mark where Kingambit VIII once stood in a grudge-filled defiance of the entire world. I scooped up the wristlet and slapped it onto my left arm. Sprigatito and Mudkip realized what I was about to do and screamed at me to stop. I had to do something, anything... *%%

%gray%* I threw my Z-crystal towards him as I activated the emera and screamed bloody murder as my veins felt like they were on fire. I defied the evolutionary course of Pokemon and ascended past a Riolu into that of a Mega Lucario. With terminal velocity, I intercepted Necrozma's giant fist and put fractures into its obsidian surface with punches and strikes filled with emotions for my first true friend's life. Charcadet regained consciousness only to watch in shock the scene that was unfolding. "TURQUOISE! NO!" The artificial emera forced out life energy that wasn't actually available for utilization. They were ultimately a shortcut with a heavy cost. I was killing myself to give everyone else the time they needed to prepare without me. *%%

%gray%*I was struck down against the floor with a bone-shattering crunch as stones splintered around me. I was hoisted up by my left arm as Necrozma stared me down with its flickering eyes. It then grabbed and wrenched my left leg at the same time, twisting and pulling as its body glowed with energy once more. I howled like the dying hound I was as I fought back against the crushing pressure of a literal all-enveloping void of darkness made manifest. I heard my flesh rip and my bones burst. The pain was too much. I used my free arm to unleash Meteor Mash into Necrozma's face to give everyone just a few moments longer. It did not take kindly to my feeble attempts and blasted me with rays of light. Everything went white, and then black. As the overwhelming pain made my body shut down, I heard the proud roar of a lion and the screeching cry of a bat. Did my colleagues succeed? Did we win?*%%

I would later wake up under the care of a nomadic tribe of intercontinental Pokemon who moved across the Skyridge Mountains and surrounding ranges. I was told I was dropped off by someone who regarded me as a friend, but they were not sure of their species at the time. The shock to my body took some time to accept. My left leg was gone at the knee, my left arm at the elbow, and I was completely blind, with only the feeblest control of my aura to perceive anything around me. My body was peppered with gouging scars and burns as the icing on the shit filled cake I've been reduced to. It was nothing short of a miracle how I managed to not die. I set out to wander the Grass Continent with them as I healed, and hopefully to learn about what happened back in Stover City.

From what I was able to learn, the plan worked... Sort of. Solgaleo and Lunala were called in from across the cosmic void and entered a pitched battle with Necrozma, but without four bearers of the Z-crystals properly charging them, they arrived incomplete. The battle was a stalemate that shook the dungeon to its very core. Charcadet was slain trying to rescue my body. I was told he was in utter tears as I lay there, bleeding out and smelling of burnt flesh and fur. Mudkip perished not long after trying to protect Sprigatito. With a True Escape Orb, Sprigatito left with me, leaving the fate of the battle with Necrozma unknown. I don't know where Sprigatito herself went. The event caused much of Stover City to collapse from unprecedented earthquakes and volcanic activity. The city had to be evacuated, and the Excadrill Company was placed in ruins as well. Last I heard, it was forbidden to enter as the Mystery Dungeon had absorbed the entire area into its fold.

News traveled astonishingly quickly, and rumors quickly twisted any truth on the matter into stories of indignation and villianization. Almost everyone that survived that event cursed my name. I suffered at least a few attempts on my life from friends, family, and colleagues of the victims, but I thankfully found sympathy and protection from the nomads during my stay with them. I honed my strength and aura, despite my crippled body, as best I could, growing strong enough to make it on my own. During my stay with the nomads, I fell back into an old coping mechanism in the form of drugs and drinks. Various exotic herbs passed through my lungs as fermented berries passed through my stomach and liver. I soon once again grew numb to the world and turned inward, empowering my aura through years of intoxication-fueled meditation, becoming a more capable Lucario than my appearance would present, although I can't say whether my personality earns that same courtesy. I left the nomads with new apparel to hide the worst of my injuries, and a prosthetic metal leg that worked on some sort of spring-powered ingenuity.

*And that has led us here. I step off the wagon being towed by a Tauros, giving him a tip of what few Poke coins I had left to his fee satchel in appreciation for the smooth ride and not setting off a migraine. He snorted and smiled in appreciation as he trotted off while I looked toward my new destination. My aura senses use the volume of the life force in the air to gauge the shapes and depth of everything around me. The sign before me apparently said Capim Town.*

*I wonder if they have vagrancy laws here too...*
