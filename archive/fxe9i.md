#Ode to the Flame Emperor

Hello! Allow me to introduce myself briefly. I'm just your typical monster researcher! I study monsters, their environments, their ecosystems, and pretty much everything about them.

I'm a big fan of them. Really, every monster researcher is. They're amazing creatures, and everyday it seems like there's more to learn about them. 

But I do have my favorites! Which leads me to the point of this little journey I've decided to write. I'm sure you've heard of Teostra?

Feared Elder Dragon? Emperor of Flame? King of Fire? Prized hunt of many a dreamer Hunter? 

Well… I'm dating one!! 

Ok, maybe “date” isn't the right word to use, but we are definitely in a relationship where he both recognize each other as ‘mates’. 

I'm writing this half to convince you to try and get a Teostra partner of your own, because they're amazing and I firmly believe he is actually the best possible partner in all of the world to have, and half to just have a place to gush about how great he is and how much I adore him. 

But where should I start? How about…


—

His mane, now that's something to talk about. It's such a passionate, vibrant red- the same hue that a king would use for his own chambers no doubt. And, despite being a monster, he keeps it remarkably well maintained! Does he groom it himself, I wonder, or does it just naturally stay in such pristine condition? Questions that I still ask myself. Of course, nowadays, I would like to say his mane is even more impressive than before. Why? Because he lets me take care of it now! 

That's a much bigger deal than it seems, by the way. Not to brag, but a Teostra's mane is his pride, and him letting me touch it at all shows the level of trust he has in me. It's quite the honor.

And I do enjoy my time with that, as does he, since he peacefully allows me to glide my brush through his magnificent mane without argument. Even tilting his head at times to make sure I get all the right spots. The first time he let me do it, he went off to a nearby river to inspect himself. I'll admit, I was a bit anxious he wouldn't like it, but he turned around with a satisfied huff, and I was rewarded with a lick on the cheek. I could barely contain myself after that! 

But that isn't even the best part. No, the *best* part is when he lets me bury myself in his mane… Such a wonderful feeling. The hairs are soft, like fine threads of scarlet silk as I run my fingers through it, and it's so thick I can't help but immerse myself in it, immerse myself in him. He smells like smoke, and heat, and fire. I adore it.

When I'm pressed up against his mane, everything feels right, I'm overflowing with happiness and joy, which honestly doesn't even fully explain it. It's great! 

I worry that I might be overstepping my bounds sometimes, but Teostra is a benevolent emperor, and lets me stay there for hours if I desire it, submersed in his great mane. 

-

His eyes, gog, what a striking pair he has. It may seem like I'm bragging here, but really, you cannot truly know the brilliance of those eyes until you see them for yourself.

The bright, azure hue contrasts wonderfully with the red of his body, demanding attention. I've lost myself in them a few dozen times already… I mean, most of those were when this whole relationship started, and I was still absolutely amazed at Teostra's majesty. I'm better at it now, but before I was *really* a mess. 

Teostra would roar at me, trying to get my attention, and I would just stare at him, completely lost because this beautiful creature was actually looking at me, his eyes were fixed on me, and nothing else mattered. 

He'd roar at me again to snap me out of it, I'd apologize, and he'd let out an amused rumble. Luckily for me, I'm pretty sure Teostra has always found my frenzied attraction to him endearing. 

But yes, in conclusion, his eyes? Good. He has good eyes, great even. I like them. 

–

I should mention his horns as well, shouldn't it? Yes, one of the parts that probably earned Teostra his famous title of “Flame Emperor”. Teostra has two horns on his head, they jut out in opposite directions from each other, forming sharp, zig-zag curves until they come to a point. 

They're large, they're intimidating, they're regal. Quite fitting for an Elder of his caliber. They practically yell out “I am greater, I am to be respected. Respect me.”

They are an important part of Teostra's identity I believe, it's practically a king's crown. Which is why I feel so much joy that he lets me shine them for him! And wow does he look stunning after I'm done… Well, he looks stunning regardless, but you get the point. 

–

Oh, speaking of intimidating, did I mention his fangs? They're sharp! And probably incredibly scary to deal with if you were hunting one. 

Thankfully I don't have to worry about that. Instead, I should tell you that Teostra is actually able to be quite gentle with those things, believe it or not. 

He touches me with them sometimes, grazing my skin with a purposeful lethargy. He never pierces my skin, but I'll definitely get a playful nibble from time to time. It's cute. 

-

This one is rather obvious, but Teostra is warm. *Very* warm. But to me, it feels like a different type of warmth than the one you feel during the day when the sun is out, or when you take a hot shower. Teostra's warmth is more similar to when you slip into your blankets when it's chilly out, or when you get a spoon of hot soup during a cold night. 

It's pleasant, and it feels cozy. 

Teostra could be hotter if he wanted to, and there are hundreds of reports starting in great detail just how hot he could be! But with me, he's warm. 

And when I hug him, or when he hugs me, I believe it's the knowledge that he's staying that warm for *me* to be the thing that adds that coziness to his heat.

-

There's some other, smaller things that I love about him as well. Although I don't really like calling them “smaller” because I really do love everyone about this big handsome monster, there are just some things that are easier to talk about than others. 

Anyway, onto my point; I love his tail. Might be a bit of an odd thing to say, but it's true. It's nice and thick, and has a neat little brush-like tip at the end of it that he loves to tease me with. He'll wave it at my face to get my attention, and it works. Or he'll just do it because he's feeling playful, or flirty.

And that's not the only way he likes to tease me either. Sometimes he'll roar for me, wave his tail around to make sure I'm really paying attention, then he'll slowly lift his tail up and let me catch a glimpse of his marvelous, bewitching, mouth watering… Well, I'll get to that later, but just know it's quite a sight! 

Ah, another thing. His wings. Teostra has quite the impressive wingspan, and seeing one in flight is breathtaking although seeing one up close is better, just personal opinion.

They're nice. Flexible, wide and definitely strong, since they have to carry him. I've taken a few rides on Teostra before (I'm talking about the sky here), and it's definitely quite the experience. I know Teostra would never drop me, but it's a bit scary being so high up in the way, so I end up basically glued to Teostra's back the entire time. He doesn't seem to mind, thankfully. In fact, I think he finds it a bit funny.

There's his claws. Polished and sharp even without a whetstone. Off the top of my head, I can't really think of another monster where this is the case. It's just another thing that's uniquely wonderful about this creature. But I shouldn't be surprised, of course such a resplendent, royal monster such as himself would not be seen with mangly claws. 

Teostra lets me polish them once in a while, when they need a touch-up. He likes the feeling, and the approving stare I get from him while it's going on makes me feel accomplished. Although I'm still wondering how he got them fixed up before… 

Moving onto a similar vein is his paws. Honestly? I'm not really a foot guy, or paw guy, I suppose, in this case. That might sound strange, considering I'm about to gush about how much I adore Teostra's paws, but what can I say? He brings it out of me! 

Such a grand, extraordinary Elder Dragon like himself, how could I not adore every part of him? I would be insulting him if I didn't, really. Yes, I love Teostra's paws. They're soft, they're warm, they're adorable! 

I've given him a few feet rubs at this point. He enjoys them. He quietly sits there, low rumbles periodically escaping his throat as I thoroughly work his paw with my hands. 

The first time I offered, he seemed puzzled. Even he was confused! I can only imagine what was going through his head.

“Hmm, now this human has an interest in my paws? What a strange one indeed… But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to indulge him.”

Or something to that effect. 

-

Hmmm… should I go more in depth about his scent? There's not that much to say about it, I believe I've already mentioned how his mane smells, and Teostra himself isn't that much different, I suppose. 

He smells like charcoal, fire, and smoke most of the time. Not the literal combination of those three things, Teostra has own… Mix, I should say? It smells like him, that's all I can really say. It's an acquired taste for sure, but I've grown fond of it, so much so that even the slight whiff of smoke makes me miss him. 

There are other times, such as when Teostra's finished doing whatever activity he usually does, like hunting or flying, when he smells a but different. 

It's a much stronger scent, more classically “manly” and musky, with a slight hint of cinnamon (don't know where it comes from, but I'm glad it's there). It mixes well with the scent he usually has, to create the wonderful mix that I love so much.

And, if I'm being truthful? If they sold his scent in a bottle? I would without a doubt, with no hesitation, spray it on my pillow. 


-

I love Teostra's personality as well, and the aura he gives off. He's so… Relaxed. Serene, you could even say. You'd think, being the deadly Elder Dragon that he is, he would be more explosive, but he really isn't. His poise is regal-like in its elegance.

Most of our time together is just spent laying around beside each other. Sometimes, he will lean in to nudge his snout against me affectionately, and I lean in in response, returning the favor. 

Teostra does not exert himself if he does not have to, he'll lounge beside me for hours, barely moving a muscle. 

But if I decide to do something, like the gentle giant that he is, he will happily play along. I'd start playing around with his paws, admiring them, and he might grab my hand! 

I might initiate a hug, doing my best to wrap my arms around this magnificent beast of a monster, and he'd recuperate, bringing me closer to perhaps engage in some cuddling. 

And other times he might just get a bit playful himself. My favorite is when he just lays on me. He's careful! If he put all his weight on me it probably wouldn't end well for me, but it's enough that it feels comfortable, like a heavy blanket. When I try to squirm out he rumbles in a manner that I'm almost certain is a laugh, snorting out some sparks. He really is just a big cat sometimes.

No surprise, he is prideful as well, but it's not that bad. I don't know if this makes sense, but his pride doesn't really come from ego, but rather from his brimming sense of self-confidence within himself. It's more admirable than contemptible, and with his natural kingly visage, it's easy to get swept away by that spirit. 

It's a type of pride that makes it so easy to think he's greater; that he's above it all, and that even with all my words of praise, it still doesn't do him justice. Gog… I love him so much. 

He's very protective of me, which not only makes me feel extremely safe around him, but also helps me tremendously with research! You wouldn't believe how easy it is to walk around when you have a scary Elde Dragon behind you dutifully standing guard. I remember vividly, one time when I was out in the Wastes, looking at a mildly interesting rock formation when a Diablos spotted me and roared. 

I turned around and prepared to run back, obviously scared, but all it took was one low rumble and a death stare from my flame-bodied partner to send him scurrying back underground. Obviously I can't tell what he was saying, but I'm sure it was something along the lines of “Touch him, and you die”. 

I had no idea a monster could be so chivalrous! And without a word, he moved closer to me, pulling me into his warm embrace and making sure any other monsters knew exactly who they had to answer to if they messed with me. It feels so good to be looked after like that! 

He's a bit possessive at times… But honestly? I don't mind it. It feels nice to know he enjoys my company as much as I enjoy his. 

I might have to cut my expedition early to go back to the guild, but instead I get cut off by my Teostra letting out a low growl and pulling me closer, urging me to stay. There's a twinge of something so warm and gooey inside my heart whenever that happens. And of course I'll stay with him because it's a Teostra! What am I gonna do, say no? Not a chance! If my Teostra wants me to stay with him, then he'll get exactly what he wants.

-

All things considered, I've been fairly tame with my appreciation towards Teostra so far. I've gushed about how great he is, and how wonderful, how charming, and a million other adjectives… But you should know it does not end there. 

I love Teostra in more than one way; to be extremely blunt, to me, Teostra is pure sex appeal. 

If you ever looked at one, you would immediately understand. His musculature is mesmerizing, I've stared countless amounts of times, drooled even. 

I'll fully admit, I ogle at him whenever he's doing one of the stretches that he does every so often.

The way his leg and foreleg muscles stretch with each movement, how you can easily tell how much power and strength he could exert at any given moment. It's almost frustratingly hot.

It's even more of a sight whenever he takes a bath. The way the water hits his scales just right leaves them shining, fully outlining the divots and curves of his muscles even more, but only for a moment before his own body heat causes it to vaporize in a flash of hot steam. 

I am so lucky to be graced with the opportunity to feel them as often as I do. His body is a work of art, a painting- no, a *sculpture* would be more accurate. A sculpture that deserves admiration and worship from someone that is willing to give it. And I, as a humble man, feel unimaginable joy to be able to take up this task and drink in this art with not only my eyes, but my hands as well. 
 
-

Let it be known that I am not alone in this behavior! It didn’t take long for Teostra to catch on to the… effects his body has on me, and oh how he *loves* to flaunt it. 

I mentioned the stretches from before, but those are just the innocent ones. When he's in a really horny mood, he'll make sure I see them, and he'll be sure to put *everything* on display.

He'll take his position right in front of me, arch his back, then, slowly, like he's doing a grand reveal to an audience, he'll move his tail upwards, pointing it towards the sky and exposing his soft, warm, inviting tailhole to me. 

And it gets me everytime, because it really is such a sight to behold. I'm not exaggerating when I say I consider Teostra's tailhole to be up there with some of the wonders of the world. 

My brain gets fried everytime I see it. If I'm doing something else, like a report or something similar, then I'm basically forced to end early, because all I would be able to think about is his hole. I'd be embarrassed to admit how many of my reports were late just because my Teostra partner wanted to get frisky and show off his tailhole for me. Too many.

But that's not all his backside has to offer! Teostra's butt is shapely, fit, and a treat to the eyes in its own right. Clearly, the rump of a monster who takes his position as Elder seriously and works hard to maintain his body in tip-top shape. 

It's firm to the touch, but it does have a bit of cushion if you squeeze hard enough. Only a bit though, it's mostly muscle back there. Trust me, I've slept on it once or twice, so I know my stuff. Gog, I've even been under it a few times. And enjoyed every second of it! 

If Teostra is the “Flame Emperor” as people say, then he must also need a throne, and I'm not afraid to play the part. Can't have my king sitting just anywhere when my face is freely available, after all! 

It's probably the asset that he most likes showing off when he's trying to get me in the mood, and I can't blame him, since it works every time. But in my defense, if you had a Teostra very purposely gyrating his shapely ass in front of you, you'd probably be won over too.
_

Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about the part you've no doubt been waiting for… His cock! 

Well what can I say about it? Just like the rest of him, it's gorgeous! It's a bright red rod with an engorged base and a tip that ends in a point. It's thick, about as big as my thigh I want to say, and the length is more impressive as well, even for an Elder of his size, standing proud at the length of my arm when he's fully hard. 

It was a bit awkward when he first started doing things with each other, since he was so much bigger than me in every way, but we've found some things that worked for us. Handjobs are great, he loves receiving them, and I love giving them, and seeing his panting, desperate face when he's close, and the roar when he cums. 

His balls shouldn't be neglected either. They're huge, heavy sacs that dangle beneath his taint and swing generously with each movement he makes. I'm not kidding about the size by the way; the things are huge, they're the size of grapefruit! 

I love just… feeling them over. Fondling them, even kissing them. 

It's also another one of his favorite ways to tease me. Swinging them side to side, throwing his weight around. It's hypnotic to look at. 

-

When it comes to intimacy, Teostra is shockingly gentle. More than anyone would think. I think he knows how much smaller I am compared to him, and he adapts appropriately, like the kind, considerate king he is, always, always thinking of his precious subjects before anything else. 

He practically spoils me. The way his tounge glides across my skin, calculated, like he's testing me. The way his paws touch and move me, like I'm mad of glass and he's terrified I might shatter if he pushes too hard. I partly want to object, because I *can* handle more force than he's giving, but love the way he handles me, so I don't say anything. 

He takes initiative most of the time, and I have no problem with it, there's never been any doubt that he's in control when it comes to this. The way he devoures my length, working his tounge against my tip with mastery, it's all too good.

He treats *me* like the king, and I can't help but feel a but guilty about it. What did I do to deserve it?

I never last long, not when he's as attentive as he is. He drinks my seed and makes a big show of it, making sure I hear the audible ‘gulp’ as It slides down his throat. He's agonizingly sweet, and careful, it makes me feel like I owe him something. 

If it's ever up to me to take initiative, I take it seriously. No need to mince words here; I worship him. Completely and utterly, his balls, his cock, his ass, his tailhole, everything about him is fully appreciated to the deepest level I am able to muster. If he treats me like a king, then I will treat him even greater, a creature that deserves praise and devotion.

And I know he likes it, his approving rumbles and roars ring loud in my ear whenever I'm in the middle of it. When my hands cup his balls, feeling their weight, fondling them, he mewls. When my hands are wrapped around his cock, milking him for everything he has, he trembles. When I'm working his backside, massaging his rump and giving it the respect it deserves, he's rumbling, and finally, when my tongue is buried deep in his sweltering tailhole, eating him out like a man starved, he roars. I'm very thorough with my worship, you see. He deserves the best, and nothing less.

And when were done with that? It's cuddling time. The aftercare is wonderful, and I always enjoy it. Teostra's moves closer, cradling my body in his front legs as his lays down over me. His heat washes over me, and I just… Relax. 

I drift off for a quick nap, and when I wake up, Teostra is still right there, holding me, waiting for me to wake up. That usually isn't the end of out get-togethers, mind you, it's just the midway point. There's still plenty to do, and how could I ever deny spending time with Teostra? I love him.
