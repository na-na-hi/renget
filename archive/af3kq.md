\>Another day behind the counter at the cafeteria.
\>Your job as a cook on the UAC Mars base was already an interesting job.
\>But a few months ago when the demons began integrating it only got even stranger
\>Even though the clientele has certainly become more colorful recently it’s still a good paying gig.
\>Still though learning how to cook with a whole new set of demonic ingredients has made life difficult.
\>Fortunately if the demons didn’t like the food at first they didn’t burn your face off or anything
\>But over time your familiarity improved with the occult ingredients and spices
\>Learning how to bake argent infused bread or cook the wiggling purple “pieces of leviathan” was far more of use of your chef skills anyways.
\>Most of the human food you made was all pre-packaged tv dinner style junk that required little effort and made it feel like you were just a school cafeteria worker.
\>What cook worth their salt wouldn’t enjoy working on the cutting edge of the culinary arts?
\>A Cacodemon even flew behind the counter one day to give you some compliments after your meals started improving.
\>You aren't sure how you feel about him expressing his joy by licking your face with his enormous tongue.
\>But he’s always happy to see you and more than willing to eat whatever left-over scraps you have in the back.
\>In general it seemed all your patrons were starting to enjoy the meals you were serving up more.
\>You could see it in the crowd outside the dining hall as the demons began lining up earlier to get your cooking.
\>While their faces were still hard to read the fact that many dug into their meals with borderline feral aggression had to be a sign of approval right?
\>The job had some drawbacks of course.
\>Like any good chef you would sample your creations, but the new demonic fruits and meats had some strange effects every now and then. 
\>The pickled argent leeches gave you one hell of a rush of energy but the crash left you exhausted for a day after they wore off.
\>The hell pepper salad you made had given you a nice lingering feeling of warmth in your body.
\>While nice at first by the end of the day the AC in your room was on max and you still felt like you were burning up.
\>Not to mention those damn things made you unbearably horny.
\>At least UAC had a good health insurance policy in case anything went too wrong.
\>Over time you started to notice a particular demon arriving earlier than most and always leaving last.
\>A Baron of hell, and a huge one too, the towering hulk of tough dark red demon having fallen into a pattern.
\>The muscled giant would arrive early and sit where he could see into the kitchen best.
\>You could feel it, his softly glowing green eyes following you as you worked.
\>Weeks pass without change your big spectator never talks or approaches you.
\>You hope he enjoys watching you to see your merely to see your technique and not some other more sinister reason.
\>Once things had settled down for the day and it seemed like all the hungry demons had left you clocked out and headed for the door.
\>Rather than the sight of an empty cafeteria that usually greets you when you clock out there is instead several hundred pounds of demon standing in the doorway.
\>It’s the baron who has been watching you these past weeks.
\>He’s just staring at you, those green eyes locked onto you with a piercing gaze.
\>For a moment you just stand there, his tall muscled body completely filling the door and blocking your exit.
\>He stands there almost fidgeting in a way, despite his size and power he seems almost nervous.
\>Just before you are about to break the silence he speaks, his voice deep and bassy as hell.
\>”You are the master of this domain correct?”  The baron rumbles, his intimidating voice certainly masking his nervousness.
\>”Uhh well i’m the head chef here if that’s what you mean...”  You reply still unsure of what the demon wants.
\>The Baron gives a satisfied grunt as you acknowledge his question.
\>”Yes you are in charge of the realm here, good.”  He says before he leans down to your eye level.
\>It’s clear this Baron must be a recent arrival on Mars, from the way he speaks he’s still adjusting to life and customs on the base.
\>”Your powers with food are most impressive.  So you will train me then.”  He says as bluntly as if you have already agreed to do so.
\>He stands still continuing to block your escape as he awaits your response as if it’s just a formality.
\>”Sure… I guess if you wanted I could-” You don’t get to finish as the massive baron comes alive at your agreement.
\>”Thank you from one lord to another.”  The demon says with a fang filled grin.
\>You have never seen a demon look so excited before, even his eyes are glowing just a bit brighter.
\>The other thing that quickly becomes apparent is that this Baron, like many others around Mars, isn’t wearing any clothing.
\>Since the demon’s started integrating clothing was encouraged to help them adapt to the customs of their human host’s culture.
\>Many demon’s took to the concept in different ways, some better than others.
\>Imp’s took a liking to loose hoodies to keep warm, Hell knights enjoyed sportswear and jockstraps to show off their form.
\>Even Pain elementals and Cacodemons often took part in their own way by tying a bit of patterned fabric to one of their horns.
\>But the few Baron’s that lived on the Mars colony generally viewed clothing as a burden.
\>It seems that the one in front of you also wasn’t a big fan as your eyes did not have to look too far down to see what he was packing.
\>Even flaccid the Baron was massive, sporting over a foot of cock resting on a sack holding balls almost as big as your head.
\>He even seemed oblivious to the fact you are checking him out or maybe still too happy from you agreeing to show him how to cook he doesn’t notice your growing bulge.
\>In fact the nude demon hardly cares he’s naked only a few feet away from you.
\>”I’ll be here tomorrow ready for when you arrive, I look forward to you displaying your might.”
\>The Baron says as he turns to leave giving you a nice view of his surprisingly perky ass as his hoofed feet stomp out the door.
\>The first few steps he seems light on his feet but as soon as he approaches the door where other demon’s might see him he changes his posture.
\>You just stand there and watch as he bursts out of the cafeteria and lets out little growls towards other demon’s who stray too close to him as he walks.
\>It seems like your new Baron friend tries to keep up appearances as the tough guy when he can.
\>Taking a moment to adjust your pants to make your arousal less noticeable you consider what you have gotten yourself into.
\>Just why does the Baron want to learn how to cook anyway?
\>Hopefully tomorrow goes as smooth as it can you think as you head back to your apartment.

\>After a relatively rough nights sleep worrying about what lies in store, you head out to work with an interesting day ahead of you to say the least.
\>Walking down to the cafeteria at your usual time you don’t see anyone else there and the lights are off.
\>You guess the Baron is running a little late.
\>Or so you thought.
\>Stepping into the supposedly empty kitchen you search for the lightswitch as you spot a pair of glowing green eyes in the back.
\>Oh god he’s already here.
\>With a flick of your finger you snap the bright fluorescent lighting on as the kitchen brightens up.
\>\>Seemingly oblivious to you checking him out, or maybe still too happy from you agreeing to show him how to cook, he doesn’t notice your growing bulge.
\>”Ah! You have arrived, I hope you don’t mind i’m early.”  The Baron said as you approached.
\>You told him it was no trouble at all as the adrenaline from his unintentional scare wore off.
\>The big red demon was, of course, completely nude just as he was yesterday.
\>As hot as it would be to have some eye candy while you work, if you are going to get any actual training done something had to happen regarding his state of undress.
\>You head on to the back closet as you throw on your medium sized chef’s apron, the Baron’s eyes following your every move as if he’s already taking mental notes.
\>After tying it up you notice that the sizes go all the way to 5XL, this might be the only thing that would come close to covering him up so you grab it as you head back.
\>”Why don’t you try this on before we start?  You say as you slide the extra large apron over to the counter your new Baron friend is standing by.
\>He grabs a hold of the fabric in one of his meaty claws as he inspects it, green eyes lit up with curiosity.
\>”I take it this garment helps you channel your power better?  I’m honored you would give me one.”
\>He slips it on over his head like a cape with a smile on his face.
\>As pleased as he seems, putting it on backwards isn’t going to help cover up his demonic junk.
\>You help him flip it over so it’s on proper, even at the largest size the kitchen had it’s still a little on the small side.
\>But at least it helped hide his maleness from your gaze.
\>Keeping it mostly covered up until he moved and you could just catch a glimpse of the tip of his cock sliding out from under the apron.
\>Now with those distractions out of the way for the most part you could start the Baron’s training.
\>You had him go pick out some basic ingredients from the cabinet while you set up your station.
\>It was then you were reminded of the fact that apron’s do nothing to cover one’s rear.
\>Turning back to check on him gave you an eyeful of the Baron’s dark red rump rooting through the pantry as he picked out the food.
\>Here you were, hardly ten minutes into your shift and you had a front row seat to the sight of an exposed demon’s ass.
\>Those dangling balls of his swaying almost hypnotically, no doubt filled to the brim with his seed.
\> Snapping back quick you avert your gaze before he notices you staring.
\>And even if he didn’t catch you the growing bulge in your crotch makes it obvious what you think of his body.
\>”I have the reagents you requested, I look forward to learning how you tame the energy inside these.”
\>You start to correct him that there isn’t any argent magic that goes into your cooking but stop when you see the almost puppy dog like look in his eyes.
\>Not wanting to ruin his illusions you decide to start with something easier, basic preparation and knife skills.
\>After laying out the varied ingredients you show him the different knives you use and how you best cut the pieces of leviathan.
\>You cut a few thinly sliced pieces and offer him your biggest knife for him to try.
\>”These are the weapons of your domain?  I thought they would be bigger.”  The Baron says as he inspects the huge butcher knife you gave him.
\>It’s practically a butter knife in his massive hand however.
\>”Like this?”  His low voice grumbles out as his slice cuts through the piece of meat you set out, as well as through part of the steel countertop.
\>You’re only surprised for a second as his strength practically cuts through your countertop.
\>Then you take another look as his muscles and it doesn’t seem to improbable.
\>You take back the knife from him as you tell him you are going to have him try something else.
\>The Baron hangs his head in shame as you do, despite knowing nothing about cooking he can sense the fact he made a mistake.
\>Taking the knife from his hand you set it down but hold on to his thick paw to reassure him.
\>It’s slightly warm to the touch and clearly holds a lot of power behind it, but it’s also gentle and calming that he’s able to hold your hand back with a more gentle grace than you would first think.
\>Guiding his hand back towards the counter you show him what you were planning.
\>You extend his claws near the food again and gently pressed his hand down.
\>His sharp nail cuts neatly through the chunk of leviathan slicing off a piece almost as neat as your earlier example.
\>The Baron’s eyes give off a strong green glow as he smiles, thankful for your help and proud of his small achievement.
\>You continue like this showing him different methods of preparing food as you get ready for today's lunch rush.
\>The Baron’s demeanor growing more gentle and appreciative towards you as the morning goes by.
\>It doesn’t take much longer before the first few demon’s start arriving early for the upcoming meal.
\>When your Baron assistant notices others arriving he leans down and almost whispers a gentle thank you.
\>His hands fully encompassing your own as he softly squeezes them together, giving you a little rush of hellfire through your system as he does so.
\>Turning around he stands up tall and changes back to his usual aggressive looking gait as he stomps out the door to leave.
\>Between the rush of energy from his jolt of warming fire and the sight of his plump butt walking away you almost don’t notice that he’s still wearing the barely fitting apron.
\>That is until one of the imps outside dares ask your new friend why he’s wearing it.
\>The Baron gives a deep harsh growl as he flexes for the imp and answers.
\>”It’s to help train my power welp!  You would not be worthy to bear this gift as I am.”  He practical roars as he shows off his apron.
\>The few other demons and the imp look confused but know better not to mess with a Baron.
\>Thanks to your not so little assistant chef’s contributions the shift goes more easy than usual, but who knows what would be in store tomorrow when he returned.

\>A  week goes by like this, making gradual improvements with the Baron.
\>He continues to regard you as some almost like royalty of the kitchen.
\>Old habits and hierarchies from hell hard for him to let go.
\>His constant displays of aggression and dismissiveness towards his “lessers”, other demons and Mars staff he doesn’t believe are of high standing, mask his gentle demeanor that becomes more clear with time.
\>But being around the giant stud each day has been starting to create a distraction that has been harder to ignore recently.
\>His insistence on wearing nothing besides an oversized chef apron has given you no shortage of sexy sights while you work.
\>It does little to hide his thick ass or bulging muscles, in fact the only thing that it seems to be good for is framing his bulge and concentrating his spicy musk.
\>As you head in early for work on your second Monday with the Baron even the kitchen itself lights a fire in your groin.
\>Shutting the door behind you the smell of your workstation has even grown to reflect the Baron’s presence.
\>He’s not even here yet and you are already starting to chub up downstairs.
\>Fortunately so far the Baron appears to be unaware of the effect he has on you.
\>Strutting his hot body and demonic junk around with the confidence of a demon that doesn’t care who sees.
\>You even had to slip into the supply closet twice last week under the pretense you were “double checking the stock” just to rub one out to avoid blowing a load into your uniform while you watched him work.
\>He did look at you strangely when you came out a bit disheveled each time though.
\>Brushing away those thoughts for now you started setting up for today's meal.
\>It wasn’t long after that you heard the tell tale stomping of your new helper arrive, practically bursting down the door in excitement.
\>The grin on his maw showing just how happy he was that you agreed last week that he could choose the recipe today.
\>Hopefully that won't come back to bite you.
\>”Greetings Chef, I hope my selection today proves most enjoyable for you.”  He said it an upbeat baritone voice.
\>He’s finally calling you Chef now after your insistence that “fellow master” was a bit too much.
\>You smile and tell him he can grab his ingredients from the back while you sharpen the knives up front.
\>Not before failing to resist the urge to check out his tight ass as he passes you by.
\>He returns with a selection of food in his hands, the happy spring in his step giving you a glimpse of balls as his cock presses a bit further into his apron than usual.
\>”I’ll give you a feast you will remember Chef!  Let me show you what your wisdom has done for my skills.”  He boasts with pride as he gets to work.
\>While you help with some minor components the Baron clearly wants to try to impress you with his own skill so you clean and prepare other dishes while he works.
\>His training showing as rather than tearing the meat apart with his hands he delicately starts to slice it with his claws.
\>You can tell the Baron is working up quite a sweat as he cooks for you.
\>The light sheen only serving to further accentuate his muscles and body.
\>As you oogle his body you notice he seems to be putting the finishing touches on the dish, instead of putting it in the oven he roasts the pan with a bout of green hellfire.
\>Try as you might to convince him otherwise he enjoyed his personal method of searing steak.
\>Before you know it he’s trying to delicately plate the meal onto two plates in an appealing way.
\>”My creation is complete, I promise you will enjoy it Chef.”  He says practically beaming with excitement as he slams one huge plate down for himself and slides your tiny by comparison steak over.
\>He stares at his food with hunger but holds himself back as he awaits your taste and appraisal of his personal meal for you.
\>You grab a knife and fork and dig in, your plate filled with fortunately human seeming ingredients.
\>Looks like he cooked steak and potatoes with a bright red sauce drizzled over the meat.
\>Your first bite of the steak is sublime the… unconventional searing method of hellfire ended up creating a nice juicy meat.
\>With a big smile you give the Baron a thumbs up as you go in for another bite.
\>His demonic face appearing pleased at his success he starts shoveling in the ten steaks or so he made for himself.
\>The next bite you take has a good bit of the red sauce which incorporates a nice but intense spicy bite to the meat.
\>Hotter than you would typically eat but still quite an appealing flavor.
\>The burning sensation subsides with a strange tingle as you continue eating, the heat moving through your system and starting to concentrate.
\>Too distracted in the quality taste to notice, it’s only on the last bite do you feel it.
\>That fire in the spice that’s been pumping through your system has kickstarted another kind of heat in you.
\>”Oh fuck…” you let out a small moan as you swallow the last bite.
\>Your Baron friend looks happy as he hears it.  “The leader of this domain likes it that much does he?”
\>That sauce must have been loaded with hell peppers, but it’s too late now, you are going to have to weather the storm of lust.
\>Your erection continues to pulse larger under the table, the growing tent becoming more obvious.
\>Practically squirming in heat and lust you try to play it cool.
\>”Yeah it’s amazing, i’d be happy to eat your… fuck”  Your train of thought is getting harder to keep straight as you start softly humping the air in your chair.
\>Struggling to spit out the rest of the words you half moan out the rest of what you hoped to say.  “Your… cooking any time!”
\>While the Baron doesn’t seem to be affected by the hell peppers, your words have a different effect.
\>Your lust attuned brain catches a stronger scent of musk after you compliment his food.
\>The noticeably loud bump you hear under the table also reinforces what might have happened.
\>God damn you’re turning this beast on with just some complements.
\>”Yeah i’d be drooling over you… your food any time.”  You say as your body keeps making it more obvious what you are doing as you rub your erection with a spare hand.
\>You need to do something to get out of this situation fast before you lose any more control, thinking quickly your spare hand brushes over your silverware onto the ground as a distraction.
\>You excuse yourself and crawl down to grab it and compose yourself.
\>As soon as you do you suspect your other head may have thought of this idea.
\>Under the table your face to face with over a foot of deep red Baron cock.
\>The little self control you have left is fading fast as the dripping pre of his own erection is clouding your mind with musk.
\>You try to tell yourself you won't but your body keeps moving closer.
\>The object from your last week of fantasies just inches in front of you.
\>Before you know it you hands are sliding up and down the beast as your head moves in to lick his essence.
\>As the dollops of pre hit your tongue your lust induced stupor tells you to keep licking as his creamy fluids draw you in like a man dying of thirst.
\>A startled moan from above tells you that your assistant chef noticed your actions, his cock growing a few inches bigger as he grows to full hardness.
\>You keep attacking his dick with your tongue trying to take as much as you can, your hands even slipping down towards his full balls as you play with them.
\>Each gentle squeeze rewards you with another shot of his precum, chasing that load of his as you work him over in every manner you can.
\>You can feel he’s growing closer as his body tenses up, but instead of that release you sought he stands up abruptly and walks away.
\>After crawling out from beneath the table you spot him splashing some water against his face by the counter.
\>As strange as it is for someone his size he seems almost shy about your encounter.
\>But in your current state that wasn’t what you dwelled on.
\>Instead you were mesmerized by his exposed ass practically drawing you in like a sirens song.
\>You move up behind him as you discard your garments along the way, fully giving in to just enjoy the lust for now.
\>Laying your smaller arms around his body as best you can you slide up behind him for a hug.
\>Helping him relax as you rubbed the meaty muscles that covered his body, his voice cut through the lust momentarily.
\>”Forgive me, I have not yet lay with another before.  The sensations are new to me.” The Baron says in a shy tone, as if the fact he is a virgin Baron of hell brought him shame.
\>”It was always seen as improper in hell, for lords like us to act so carnally.  But this pleasure you give me feels so hellishly divine.”  He grumbles out with his deep voice.
\>He moans softly as you grind your manhood against his ass while he finishes his thoughts.
\>”But… I suppose there is a first time for everything, and it would be rude of me to deny you your full course meal.”  His voice grows more sultry as he humps back into you.
\>Your cock sliding against his crack gracefully as you take in the pleasure.
\>”How about I have some dessert then?”  You tell him before gently pushing him forward so he is set up against the counter with his ass presented in all its glory.
\>You slide down and give his ass a firm slap that earns you a surprisingly high pitched moan from the Baron before you part his huge cheeks and get to work.
\>Sliding your tongue against his ring you press against it for a second, making him think you might go farther before pulling back and circling his entrance.
\>You press your face farther into his ass, the massive thing practically encompassing your head as you continue your delightfully sinful work.
\>Every once in a while pressing in slightly deeper into his puckered hole.
\>The heat and musk surrounding you has left your own cock spurting its own gushes of pre against the demons balls.
\>Giving them a nice coat of your own musk as you embrace his fully.
\>Rather than stroke your dick during the ordeal you devote both hands into pleasing the Baron, massaging his cheeks and muscles before moving around to the front to stroke his magnificent member.
\>It’s practically soaked in his own dripping pre and your hand moves up and down the slick dick as you work him over.
\>The Baron is gasping at this point as he groans out your praise. “Are you part lust demon?  You are too skilled at the art of… ngh… teasing to be anything but.”
\>His voice his so deep it practically vibrates his body you are so intimately close with.  
\>Seizing the chance you press your tongue in as far as you can go and start eating his ass with the conviction of a zealot. 
\>Tongue and face pressed as far into him as you can go you feel his balls tighten close to his body as his cock starts fucking the air in front of him.
\>”Burning hells… I can’t…” Is all he can let out before shooting shot after shot of his cum under the table you are tongue fucking him on.
\>It must be a gallon or more of dripping spunk he shoots out as it drips down.
\>Your hands don’t let up throughout each pulse as he doesn’t slow down in his orgasm.
\>Your own cock frantically thrusting between his legs in desperation for your own release.
\>Warm cum starts oozing down from the volume of the Baron’s release, coating your own cock in a pleasant hot blanket of musk.
\>This new slick feeling has you pulling your head out and gasping for air before pressing your dick into his ass like a man possessed.
\>Anything to put out the burning need inside you that has grown into a wildfire of lewd thoughts and lust.
\>Your preparations on his ass have given you a smooth entrance as you slide in easily.
\>Each frantic thrust into his hole pushing out another gout of cum from the Baron’s ever leaking cock.
\>The feeling is almost indescribable as the rhythmic flexing of the Baron’s powerful ass grip your cock in all the right ways. 
\>You were already so close and now with his rump embracing and massaging your cock during his orgasm it doesn’t take more than a few thrusts before you are moaning out and shooting your essence as deep as you can inside him.
\>The relief washes over you in waves as it’s replaced by a blinding sense of pleasure.
\>You cum for almost as long as the Baron as you pump shot after shot of your own special sauce as deep as you can.
\>The two of you lay there for a while, neither one wanting to be the first to move.
\>The kitchen fully a musky mess of cum and sweat.
\>The filled demon’s eyes burning a brighter shade of green as the two of you bask in the sensations as long as you can.
\>”I’m glad you enjoyed my meal Chef.  Because I sure did.”  The Baron says
\>”Because I might have to make that for you more often now”  Is all he can say before he moans and shoots out one last shot of cum.
\>Maybe there were some good uses for hell peppers after all.
