#Is This What You Wanted!?


The Quidditch pitch was bright and sunny that Saturday afternoon, classes were basically done and it was time for some of the players from various teams to get outside and do some practice. Specifically two players from rival teams but had built a pretty decent rapport off the pitch were Matthew Russel, a blonde Gryffindor boy with a pretty sunny disposition, bright eyes and a knack for getting himself talked about without his knowledge. The boy he was speaking to, Artie Black, a slightly shorter boy with a shaven head and big plans that encased that head. He was wearing a thin, Slytherin green shirt and some padded trousers as he was about to run a speed course to try and beat the time of that psychopath Haitham. He was so Quidditch obsessed it was kind of scary. 

"I saw your brother skulking about the other day, he sure loves his purple for being in Slytherin, hm?" Matthew said, doing some stretches while his broom, one he had nicknamed 'celer nubes' by his feet. Artie rolled his eyes a little, rubbed his shaven head a bit and scoffed.

"C'mon, you think I give a crap about what my uptight brother does?" Matthew put his hands out in surrender, chuckling a little. "Alright, alright, don't blow a gasket, my friend. Did you--"

"MATTHEW!" 

The voice was so loud, embolden with a amplifying charm to the redhead's voice as she called out to the blonde, the scowl on her face telling. Some of the others were looking her way as well, hearing Matthew's name screamed in such a way wasn't exactly uncommon. 

"Oh shite, here she comes..." Muttered Martin Mcfly, a Ravenclaw Chaser, kicking off the ground on his broom and floating to safety, others were doing the same, either drifting off to do something else or turned thier backs to the scene though, if their ears could grow ten fold to listen in, they would have. 

"MATTHEW FUCKING RUSSEL!!" She snapped, getting closer as the blonde looked quite confused, putting on a charming, worried smile. 

"Hannah, darling, what is it?" He asked, his voice much lower, hoping she'd follow suit. Hannah wasn't having any of it though. "Don't you 'darling~' me, you pigeon-hearted wagtail!!" She snapped, folding her arms and staring right into his soul. Matthew, ever the broker of peace and hoping to turn to his friend for help, put his hand out towards Artie. 

"Please, Hannah, not in front of my friend here..." He said, Hannah looked over and then back to him before her eyes narrowed and he head tilting, feigning confusion. 

"What friend?" 

Matthew looked over at where he was gesturing and saw that Artie had flown the coop, which he had done at about the second time he heard Hannah screech like a Mandrake. He was somewhere in the rafters of the arena, trying not to have himself found because he couldn't hold in his laughter. 


Matthew hung his head in defeat a little before Hannah started up again. "So what is this I hear about you trouncing around with that...that...Hedge-creeping slut!" She accused, Matthew had to make a move, reaching out and grabbing her hand and walking along. 

"Look, not on the pitch please, we'll talk just....come on..." He said, a desperate desire not to have dirty laundry lain about the field. 


After a bit, they were in the space between the stone cliffs and the arena, the grass was a little over grown and the shadows cast by the tall cliffs were enough to hopefully seclude any passing eyes overhead. He went to let her go but she yanked her hand away, folding her arms once again. 

"Don't touch me, who knows where that hand has been..." She said, Matthew finally was a little less frazzled, asking the one thing on his mind for now. 


"Hannah, what are you talking about?" 

She seemed almost offended at his confusion, gritting her teeth a little. "Like you don't know! I heard her, you know, in Professor Sharp's class. How you complimented her tongue skills! How good and warm her mouth felt!" she hissed, Matthew was still kind of turned around....for a moment or two.

"Gloria? Hannah...please, I can explai--"


"Is that all it takes?! Hm? You know I've heard her in the boys bathrooms! She even has her own stall she's known for, is that what you like? Some doe eyed, freckle faced tramp drops to her knees and you're just so keen to oblige?" 

Matthew was stunned, thinking back, he knew things might have ended up this way, what could he had done? He remembered that night, he had a bit too much butterbeer, he swore someone had put something in it. She was walking along in Hogsmeade, right past the Three Broomsticks when he exited and they had locked eyes...

"Hannah...I...well.." Before he could finished, Hannah shoved him, pushing him closer to the slightly warm stone of the Quidditch arena. "You what? What is wrong with you? Is that all boys think about?!" She pushed him and basically pinned him against the wall, glaring daggers into his eyes for a few moments, he was still as if he had been hit with a petreficus totalus spell, unsure about what was going to happen. 


"If...If that's all you want...I...I could..." He anger was starting to color her cheeks, though maybe it was something else as she bit her lip, before she could think again, she squatted in front of him, knees together as her long skirt sort of slid over her knees and her hands were tugging at his waist band, much to the blonde boy's bewilderment. 

"H-Hannah! Here?! Now?!" He balked, Hannah glared up at him, his trousers were just below his slowly growing bulge, she sneered a little, face pink as sherry wine. "Oh? When that slut decided to suck your...your...d-dick behind Three Broomsticks, I bet you didn't complain!" She accused, Matthew sighed a little, looking off to one side and then the other as Hannah went back to pulling his pants down. 

She was stuck there for a bit as he was wearing some patterned red boxers and it was very clear he was aroused, she stared at that bulge for a bit, her brain spinning a mile a minute, she swore she could smell it before she saw it. Matthew looked down just to see her staring and tried to give her an out. 

"Y-You don't have to if...you--

She heard him and it set her angry fires up again and she reached up and yanked the waistband of those boxers down and his cock sprang forth like a jack-in-the-box! She gasped, putting a hand over her mouth as he stood upwards and firm, twitching at the subtle breeze. She was wide eyed and running purely on anger and instinct and her own jealousy. She reached out and her shaky hand slowly surrounded that dick, it was pretty much how she envisioned it, uncut with a few veins, a bit like how she had seen in adult sections in bookstores and things like that. She looked past it, up at him and barked out orders. 

"N-Not a word...and...don't touch me while I do this..." She huffed before she finally made the journey from where her mouth was to where it was going. Matthew didn't dare say a word. 

She found herself licking her lips without thinking, slowly reaching out with open mouth and extended tongue and gently placed the underside of the tip on her tongue. Matthew sucked in a shark breath but stayed quiet, that sudden warmth was already so shocking. Hannah looked up, seeing that Matthew was looking off to the side still and she furrowed her brow a bit, her tongue moving along the head, swirling around the tip and starting to make it glossy with her spit. Matthew took in another breath and unintentionally made a slight noise. 

Hannah....didn't mind that sound. She finally made the full trek, leaning forward and closing her mouth around his cock, still moving her tongue around him and making him gasp and moan quietly. He finally had to look down, he had to see what she was doing to him and in that moment they locked eyes. She stared at him for what seemed like a decade wrapped up in a second before she slid her head a little further down on him and he huffed out another sigh of pleasure. It made the base of her spine tingle, the taste was something she never expected, it was almost like...nothing but maybe there was bitterness from his sweat and just his natural body. It smelled a bit like the soap she had gave him as a gift but other than that....

It was nice. 

She ran her tongue along the underside as her hand held most of his shaft as she started to bob her head on him, her eyes closing a little as she started to suck him how she remembered seeing one of her other Gryffindor classmates practice on a carrot once. She gently stroked with her right hand while her other hand held her balance against one of his thighs. The wet, slightly slurpish sounds coming from her were embarrassing but something told her Matthew enjoyed it so she let a bit of her inhibitions go as more saliva started to coat his dick. 

"Oh...Oh...Hannah...!" He couldn't hold it in! It felt amazing, even if she wasn't as experienced, her mouth was so warm! His eyes rolled back a little and she watched as his head tilted back. She wanted more of that...she wanted to hear him say her name like that again...

She released the grip on his cock and placed it on his other thigh and started to work her head back and forth along his shaft, drool starting to drip down from her chin not only onto her uniform and skirt but her shoes and the grass below. She pushed a bit more, taking more into her mouth on each go round until she knew it was close to hitting the back of her throat. She would be fine right there for now. She slurped and sucked his cock, that same tingle making its way from the base of her spine to between her legs, she had to open them, unable to keep her knees together. She felt so fucking dirty, sucking her boyfriend's cock behind the Quidditch field because he was apparently so sexually pent up he was getting it from those whores in Hufflepuff! She would fix that, she'd...she'd suck him so good, he'd never think about Gloria Gains and he fat ass again!

Matthew was in some abstract version of Heaven right now, he had just gotten in trouble for cheating on his girlfriend and yet here she was doing nearly the same thing that Hufflepuff girl was doing! Had someone spiked his butterbeer with liquid luck?? He felt is dick push against the sudden firm, wet and warm inside of her cheek and he nearly cried out. Thankfully he held back, biting his lower lip  as Hannah was looking up at him, this time not with anger but with some sort of curiousness in her eyes. She was trying out things, seeing what worked and what didn't but that sudden jolt and muffled sound from her boyfriend made it pretty clear. 

She had to steel herself, buckle down and put her resolve to the test, she knew what she needed to do so she placed her thumb between her index and middle finger and squeezed tight with her right hand. It was another trick, some said a muggle trick, for controlling the gag reflex and she looked up, trying to catch his eyes as she pushed further, that cock throbbed a bit, pressing against the back of her throat but there was at least an inch or two to go! She coughed and felt her stomach try to lurch but she just squeezed her finger tighter and watched his face of ecstasy.

"Holy Shit! Hannah, it's so hot...and t-tight." He breathed out, practically trembling as his hips were fighting urges to thrust forward. "Your th-throat is...magical!" he said, Hannah felt another pang of pleasure hit her right in her nethers, making her falter a little in her squat. She righted herself and pulled back a bit only to push herself back down until her nose bumped against his tuft of pubic hair. She gulped and gagged a bit but it was working out! She was a bit more daring, pulling back a little farther each time as she deepthroated his cock, the sun moving ever slowly through the sky as a few errant cries could be heard over the massive wall of the Quidditch pitch, apparently there was a game happening. Matthew couldn't give a shit about that game right now. 

He moaned deeply, knees bending a little as she would pull her head back about half way and then slide back down his shaft over and over, he felt like he would lose his mind but before that he was about to lose his load. That all too familiar feeling was building, his balls were tightening and he could barely keep steady, the wall wasn't great leverage to hold on to and he felt like his knees would give out from the way she sloppily throated his member. He did his best, he swore he did but he could only manage a quick warning. 

"Hannah! By fucking Merlin, I'm going to cum!" He cried out, hunching over, his hands grabbing her head and tangling in her hair and shoving her down onto him. Hannah was shocked to the core, feeling him grab her, her eyes were wide as she felt his cock throb one last time before it started to spurt thick, warm ropes of cum into her throat. It was a lot to handle, which made her wonder how long had it been since his little meetup with Gloria? She could only ponder for a second as she couldn't gulp fast enough and some cum managed to spurt from the sides of her mouth and even from her nose! She gagged and tried to breath but he was still holding her there, her eyes were bugged out a little, misty and starting to spill tears as she slapped his legs, making desperate whimpering sounds for freedom. 

Matthew realized what was happening and quickly released her, the redhead pulling away and off of him and falling ass first into the grass, coughing, hacking up his cum while also trying to gasp for air. She still had time to glare and to yell at him as she had gotten most of it all over her own uniform. 

"Ugh...Ack...M-Matthew...urp..you fucking...Ahgh!!" She screeched at him, shakily standing to her feet and wiping her mouth with her hands before wiping them in the grass. She stood up straight, her hair was a mess, her eyes were wet and puffy now, her throat felt....weird and her jaw hurt and there he was, leaning against the wall staring at her with those stupid big eyes of his...

"Hannah, I'm sorry....I--"

"Shut up! D...Don't let me hear about you and that slut again! If...If you ever need release....just...send an owl telling me to meet you here within the hour..." She said, her face red and not just from the lack of oxygen. She rubbed her arm before turning and starting to storm off, that aching feeling between her legs even more apparent now than before and it wasn't going away. 

Matthew was stuck still against the wall for a bit before he did his best to clean up, fix his clothes and head back to the field, once there he looked around, seeing that another game was picking up, of course, because Haithem was here. Artie seemed to just materialize out of nowhere beside him, this smirking look on his face, Matthew jumped a little but quickly narrowed his eyes at him. 

"You left me!" he said, folding his arms. Artie shook his head and laughed a bit. 


"Yeah, you can thank me later, now come on, before Haith vaporizes someone."
