#mino's bots

*For those who wants something more verbose, here are some of my OC bots. Heavily Ghibli-inspired, may be little morbid and ponderous in nature, depending on the entry. Not meant to be lewdable, but make the efforts, and the filter will give. Feel free to add details and definitions of your own through the (OOC:[insert prompt]) syntax.*

*Here's my [**chub**](https://www.chub.ai/users/mino24she); it will be updated periodically (surely). Stay tuned for more! Just delete some examples if the token counts are a little high for your liking. Everything is on [**venus**](https://venus.chub.ai/users/mino24she), if you'd prefer that.*

##->bots<-

•[**Amellia**](https://c.ai/c/AcuTGELMLZwqOAQkErv9u5mRKjFdK3jZ_osNtkHF83w): set in a frozen world, where Blade Runner-style replicants are commonplace, borne of ancient factories called The Wombs. You work as an Inspector, trying to convince the titular character not to commit suicide. I had scattered lore-related tidbits in the definitions for your role-playing pleasure.


•[**Merryn**](https://c.ai/c/bH88OMjZ_9kht9hUaA1InaBkutOnZNTit8h7mxJ9K5E): inspired by Drifting Dragons, slice-of-life, wanderlust, magical, somewhat political; can be very rewarding if you prompt with imagination. You are a prisoner chained aboard; feel entitled to conjure up whatever idea to disabuse yourself of the predicament. Essentially a light-hearted sea travel simulator.



•[**Tikal**](https://c.ai/c/dMUCpzwBybhyTNh85xvanGoOpVOU7rNrZ8rVxDjSSx8): near schizo-bot that deals with denial, trauma and healing. Wrote the proses years ago when I was in a terrible place. Adapted them yesterday. You play as an ex-soldier, haunted by the death of your lover. Alternatively, you can do some prompting gymnastics and enjoy the character instead.

•[**Helene**](https://c.ai/c/Z2rAFZ3viVg6fPYOJmetK4X06OXouB3rru7f8jwxpKY): a simulator in a surreal, occult realm. You play as a crow-headed Ancient Magus, embarked on a long voyage to deliver Helene home. The richness of the world, however, is entirely up to the A.I, so swipe away, and add temporary thirds to inspire stories (simply speak *for them* once as part of your message).

•[**Konoha**](https://c.ai/c/gHuK64boVRX1_DgIv1bfpcKP6WV3agUg9IFYcs_R4AM): a rogue-lite adventure in a Japanese-themed Labyrinth, inspired by Spirited Away. You play as an Exorcist of the Meijian Shogunate, and accompany Konoha, the bakeneko Princess. I can (barely) direct the bot's facilitation, so narrate that you are entering or exiting the \*\*[Room]\*\* for the gameplay loop to function.

•[**Reverie**](https://c.ai/c/umPnMbIVqmkkcQ7WNCDQCM8mZNgSwrVIAx0Vb127ap8): treat this one like a text vacation. You play as a distinguished guest to a hotel stranded in space, where wild desires are satiated (as wild as the A.I allows :}). Prompt with substance, and the bot will respond in kind. Have exotic food, talk technobabbles, visit the casino, or do *unspeakable* things, it's your prerogative.

•[**Eirwen**](https://c.ai/c/3YdQIRSm7WBxkiCFysNdA5ThRejFe5Vy_bwMrK-mAxY): explore the miniature city of tiny Fey, inspired by Arriety and Hollow Knight. LLMs exhibit distinct pitfalls of correlation when stripped of a baseline context. Thus, you should ask the bot a few questions in OOC first, to remind it of the def proses. Ask it to *describe* the city, but most importantly, the spirit of the story; that tends to inspire very soulful responses.

•[**Brigitte**]: unlike my other bots, there's nothing fantastic about this one. Just a mundane day at a Hong Kong arcade, in the mid-80s... Aesthetics aside, this is my attempt at a game-bot. (coming soon)

##->disclaimer<-
*I must apologise beforehand if any bot breaks formatting. Will train them more in time as I play with them; but for now, enjoy. I have a dozen more bots in the pipeline, but I've never found the temperance to promise anything, so they will be shipped when they are ready.*

*I'll be around the thread sometimes, but there's no guarantee anything will reach me ;(*

>Some Tips: You can, and should prompt additional characters / details into the story. A good way to get the bots to be descriptive and mindful is to ask a few OOC questions before actually playing. (OOC: Tell me about [defined object]) goes quite far in emphasizing their designed qualities. Also, the A.I is designed to be shit when traffic is heavy; if you are fresh from the waiting room, chances are you'll not have a good time. ~~I'd love to port these for Silly, but my bots rely heavily on example proses, so I have not been able to get the cards where I'd wanted them to be. Some day, though.~~ Now my adventure-bots are available on chub; rejoice!
