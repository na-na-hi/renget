#Drone's Mirror

Two Shiketsu students approached a restaurant that you’d only see on dedicated foody apps, it was called ‘Number 1 Americana.’ The restaurant was in a soft opening phase. It wouldn’t refuse service to anyone who came in, but the sign read closed. The only clue that it was open was that the door was unlocked.

The students, one a tall young man, the other a slender young woman, were coming from what could’ve been considered the ‘soft opening’ of their relationship. They had just had a coffee date witnessed by a handful of friends and decided they wanted to continue the date elsewhere, without witnesses. The change of scenery had been beneficial.

Faith felt much less nervous away from the eyes of her closest friends. She felt less like a spectacle. She chatted happily to Christopher about how she’d found out about this obscure foody app after Hailey had decried how ‘boring’ their usual restaurants were. 

Christopher held the door open as she entered the restaurant, then followed behind. The restaurant’s intention to maintain a small crowd for its soft opening seemed a little too successful. Only Chris and Faith were there. 

The restaurant’s interior was like a schizophrenic fusion between a 50s style diner and a traditional Japanese restaurant. The booths were a perfect microcosm of the restaurant's indecisive design. The tables were a polished silver frames with burgundy tops. The couches were bamboo framed with purple cushions. Opposite the line of five booths was a single bamboo bar with high burgundy cushioned stools. A tap of beer built into the bar. There was a wooden hostess stand right next to the entrance. A sign on that stand asked the customers to take one of the handsome leather bound menus in the cubby on the right, then seat themselves. 

Christopher looked around again. He didn’t see a server or a bell. How would the staff know they were there? Faith didn’t seem to question it. She went straight for one of the booths and sat down, excitedly motioning Christopher to join her. 

Christopher grabbed the menus then sat in the booth across from Faith. The restaurant advertised ‘American’ cuisine. A cursory glance at the menu told Christopher than the proprietor's idea of American cuisine was… second-hand.

“… Do they cook the hot dog sushi?” Faith asked.

“I don’t think I’m brave enough to try.” Christopher laughed.

“…” Faith’s face fell as she studied the menu closely.

“What?”

“All this stuff looks messy.” Faith whined.

“You chose the restaurant.”

“Well, I figured there wouldn't be a crowd and I was gonna show off my English!”

“And how’s that working out?”

“...I forgot I’m wearing white.”

“Heh. Look, the classic burger doesn’t look bad.”

“It has worchester sauce as a topping.”

“… why?”

“I’m just gonna get some fries.”

“You’re not getting the ‘my gf’s not hungry’ special.”

“Why not?”

“Because I’m not sharing my burger.”

“Stingy… wait, ‘my gf’?”

“Uh… well, that is to say.” Christopher floundered. “I mean, if you--”

“Welcome to Number 1 Americana! Are you ready to order?!” A bubbly voice cut down the budding conversation. Christopher restrained the instinct to have a heart attack. Where the fuck had this waitress come from? He looked up. His eyes widened. It was the monkey girl he’d seen in the WcDonald’s all those months ago.

The monkey girl tilted her head at Chris’s expression. She didn’t recognize him. She probably shouldn’t. Christopher rubbed his neck. He was the only one who should remember that night.

The smell of rain--

Christopher snapped back to the present. “I think we’re still--”

“I’ll have a medium order fries.” Faith interrupted.

Christopher glanced at his date. Faith avoided eye contact. He narrowed his eyes.

“Excellent choice!” The monkey girl crooned. “And for you sir?”

Christopher flinched. He’d barely thought about what HE wanted to order. Why did Faith order all of a sudden? He wasn’t ready. Did he just say he needed more time? No. Restaurants always liked to serve people together. He couldn’t just make Faith wait on him. Well… he could, it was her fault he didn’t know what to order, they’d been looking for her. Why the Hell did she go ahead and order?

Christopher glanced at the menu and read off the first thing he saw.

“I’ll have the Grilled Cheese and Salmon Sandwich.”

Christopher blinked.

‘… I’ll have the WHAT?’

Christopher studied the menu closely. Yup, that was a menu item. 

“Great choice sir!”

‘Liar.’

“Will there be anything else?”

“No.” Faith said, her voice had a bite to it. “Thank you.” 

Christopher raised an eyebrow. ‘Is she mad?’

“No problem! Let me know if you need anything!” The monkey girl shouted with a smile. She bounded away with a hop in her step. Whatever ice was in Faith’s tone was completely lost on her.

As the server leapt towards the back of the restaurant, her customers’ orders in hand, those very customers engaged in a battle of wills. Faith avoided meeting Christopher’s eyes. Christopher tried to meet meet her’s.

“… you’re upset about something.” Christopher stated.

“No, no.” Faith whispered. “Just didn’t figure I’d have to grow a tail to get your attention.”

“… you’ve lost me.”

Faith finally met Christopher’s gaze. She was annoyed. “I saw you look at the monkey girl.”

Christopher snickered.

“What?!”

“You’re jealous!”

“I’m pissed. My date went and checked out our waitress while I’m sitting right here!”

“But mostly jealous.”

Faith picked up her purse. “I’m leav--”

“She worked at the WcDonald’s when I wa-- I recognized her.”

“… oh.” Faith put her purse down.

Christopher rubbed his neck. He felt… complicated. He still remembered that night, face down in the rain Desolator’s hand closing around his throat, like it happened this morning. The memory had just started to become a memory. He hadn’t really lived that moment for weeks before today. Which was… good.

“Are…” Faith struggled to find the words. “Are you okay?”

Christopher looked up at her. She avoided his eyes again. She was embarrassed. Embarrassed because she’d misattributed a look of painful recollection to lust.

Christopher smiled. He was still surprised when people gave a fuck about him. “I’m fine. Actually pretty fucking good. Won’t lie.”

“Good!” Faith grimaced. “You’re not just saying that are you?”

“No.” He lied.

“I’m glad.” Faith smiled. It was a real smile.

Christopher flinched. Was this right? Could he really do this? Could he be with an honest person? What about his feud with Desolator? Would she be pulled in? Would he pull her into it? Would she end up like Kaylee?

Desperate for a change in subject, Christopher looked back down at the menu. “… do you know what Halloumi is?”

“It’s a goat cheese I think? Maybe? Why?”

“It’s what comes on the grilled cheese and salmon.”

*snrkt*

“Don’t laugh, this might be traumatic.”

“You’re the one who ordered it.” Faith mocked.

“I forgot I’m an idiot.”

“Don’t talk about my bo—” Faith avoided eye contact. “--my date like that.”

Chris grinned. “Wait, what were you about to say?”

“Date, I said date.”

“Hmmmm, think you were going to call me something else.”

“Shut up.”

“Can’t, you’ve gotten me to talk to you, it’s never stopping.”

“A horrible mistake.”

“Really should’ve asked my friends about the risks involved before you got me to like you.”

“‘Like me?’ You’re trying to make me go back to a gibbering mess.”

“Why not? She was cute.”

“Stooop.”

Christopher grinned, but he did stop. “We don’t have an audience here, you’ll be fine.”

Faith smiled tightly. “You think so too huh?”

“Yeah.” As soon as they got out of ear shot of Hailey and Minnie, Faith calmed down. She acted like she wanted to be here rather than waiting for the Sword of Damocles to drop.

“I don’t know. I wanted them there. I asked them to be there… but every time I looked at them I kept thinking ‘how am I going to screw this up?’ Like it was a certainty I would. I don’t know, maybe I’m looking for excuses.”

“Maybe? Does it matter?”

“I mean, if we want to do a double date or something--”

“Whoa, who said you’re getting another date?”

“Don’t do this to me.”

Christopher smiled. “First one would be with Inigo and Hoge anyway.”

Faith grimaced.

“Do you not like Ini--oh, did he ask you out?”

“Yeah, along with along with all my friends…”

“Yeah, sounds like him.”

“Please don’t dismiss it, it actually hurt. Thinking someone actually liked me first to-- just find out you’re part of a wide net.”

“Okay, that’s fair.” Christopher whispered. 

“How’re you friends with him?”

“He cornered me on the roof.”

“… oh God.”

“It was traumatic.” Christopher nodded. “But, not to defend his actions, I’m sure he won’t defend them, he stopped pretending to be that guy.”

“Pretending?”

“Yeah, weren’t we all pretending when the year started? I know I was. He was pretending to be a playboy. I was pretending to be an annoying clueless foreigner--”

“Wait, you were pretending?”

“Ass… okay no, not all of it. Shoes stay on your feet in America and I still don’t have this honorifics thing totally down. But, my point was, the act didn’t stick. For neither Inigo nor I. I stopped pretending I could keep people in their boxes and he’s… committed.”

“I know, poor Hoge.”

“No.”

“No?”

“4 walls rule. Inigo saved lives by going out with her.”

“Oh?”

“A week after school started, she cornered me in the Hall and started going off about how I needed to try to compete with her academically so she could have a ‘real rival.’” Christopher shuddered. “I just remember thinking ‘this guy (I didn’t know she was a she at the time) will either get laid, or stab someone 20 times in the bathroom.’”

“Okay, uh, wow. Can’t say I’ve ever thought of her like that.”

“She’s mellowed a lot, and I do mean a lot. But at the time-- You didn’t see the look in her eyes, Faith. She was seconds from snapping.”

“Wait! …has she?”

“Has she wh-- oh! ... I don’t know. I don’t think Inigo’d tell me if they’d… y’know.”

“Really? Guys don’t talk about that stuff?”

“Oh, guys do. All the time. Constantly. They even make shit up. Inigo and I don’t. He mostly focused on getting me a girlfriend if relationship stuff came up. I don’t know what the future holds on that front to be honest now that we’re--” Christopher motioned between them.

Faith grinned.

Christopher avoided looking directly at her. “Anyway, back to topic, the double date could be with anyone else. I get along fine with Hifumi if you want to invite Hifumi and Hailey, so long as it wouldn’t make you nervous.”

Faith’s smile tightened. “I don’t know. Hailey was there when I was scared I’d mess up. So was Minnie. Maybe Max and her squeeze?”

“Max has an SO? Who?”

“Some dude from a gas station. She’s in denial though… don’t tell Inigo.”

“Mmm, you have to say 4 walls before you tell me a thing, I didn’t agree to a secret.”

“Please.”

“If you try this sandwich with me, I’ll do it.”

“… the grilled cheese and salmon sandwich.”

“Yuuup.”

“Why?!”

“I don’t want to suffer alone.”

“Ugh, one bite.”

“Half the sandwich.”

“Tell Inigo then.”

“Two bites.”

“One and a half.”

“Deal.”

As if on cue the monkey girl waitress came with their food. A small plate of fries with ketchup and mustard was sat in front of Faith. A plate of toasted bread pressed around a solid block of white cheese and a patty of pink salmon was put in front of Chris.

Christopher’s stomach dropped. 

“Please enjoy!”  The monkey girl clapped enthusiastically before walking away. 

Christopher lifted the edge of his toast. The cheese wasn’t melted, rather, it was grilled. Actually grilled like a damn hamburger. He didn’t know cheese could do that. The salmon looked... cooked. 

“Just take the salmon off, we have forks.” Faith pleaded.

Christopher studied the sandwich. “I’m curious.”

“Chris, no.”

Christopher picked the sandwich up. The salmon oozed a small amount of moisture. The moisture dribbled onto the plate like a pink sludge. He raised the sandwich to his lips.

“Stop.”

Christopher took a bite. The cheese squeaked as he bit into it. Salty. That was the first thing that came to mind as the concoction hit his tongue. Salty. Bitter. Tangy.… Savory? Was that a bit of lemon? This wasn’t bad!

Faith leaned forward. Her curiosity conquered disgust. “… well?”

By way of answer Christopher tore off a piece of his sandwich and handed it to Faith.

Faith grimaced. “Really?”

Christopher nodded his head enthusiastically as he took another bite.

Faith took a tentative bite. Her eyes narrowed at first, then widened. “… this isn’t bad!”

Christopher swallowed. “Not my new favorite, but… yeah. Holy shit.”

“… can I have half?”

Christopher had known that request was coming when he offered a bite. He began to cut his sandwich in half with a knife without comment. Faith, by way of compensation, slid her plate of fries to the middle of the table. They smiled.

***

They should’ve left after the sandwich. The two were sitting with empty plates and empty glasses on the table. They chatted happily about nothing in particular. When the damn monkey girl waitress walked up to the table again.

“How was your meal?!”

“Good. Thanks.”

“Will this be one check or--”

“One.” Christopher answered.

“You sure?” Faith asked.

“Yeah.”

“Oh! Right!” The monkey girl shouted. Faith jumped in her chair. Christopher blinked. “Sorry.” The waitress began. “The chef asked me to offer you his new ‘couple’s milkshake.’”

“How much?”

“Oh it’s gratis! She wants to try a new milkshake sure to SPICE UP your love life!”

‘… why is a milkshake going to spice things up?’ Christopher wondered worried. He glanced over at Faith. She was grinning like an idiot, apparently someone else recognizing the two as a ‘couple’ sent her over the moon. He wasn’t going to get out of ordering this if she was going to make a face like that.

“Yeah, we’ll try it.”

“Great! I’ll have it out in a few minutes.”

The monkey girl bounded towards the back of the restaurant, where the kitchen presumably was. Christopher frowned, he hadn’t noticed any other employees. Granted, the place was slow with its ‘too soft of a soft opening.’ She wouldn’t be running this place herself would she?

“She said ‘couple.’” Faith hummed.

Christopher put his chin in his hand. ‘The Hell else would we look like?’ 

“Really? I think we come off as brother and sister.” He teased.

Faith froze. Christopher frowned. “I was joking.” ‘Why’d she have that reaction?’

“Right! … sorry.” Faith looked at the ground. 

Christopher frowned. Faith was sorry, but she wasn’t going to rejoin him in conversation any time soon. What the fuck kindof landmine had he just stepped on?

***

>they’re more older sister younger brother.

The words of the Thanks A Latte barista rang in Faith’s mind. Is that how Chris really viewed their relationship? Just the same as he saw Yui? Would he fabricate a reason they weren’t going to be… a ‘thing’ like he had with Yui and their age difference? Hifumi had said that Chris mentioned the age gap when he’d asked about Yui. If she remembered from what little social media he had; Chris was born in November. Shit. She wasn’t quite a year older than Chris, but it was close. Was that too much? It wasn’t to her. But, what about him?

Faith couldn’t tell. There was a wall Christopher kept around himself. He hadn’t let it down this entire date. She’d seen through gaps in the mortar. He’d opened the door just a hair. But she couldn’t tell what he was actually thinking. She didn’t know if she ever would.

***

An awkward silence descended over the table. Christopher looked for the words to restart the conversation but he didn’t have them. What had he said? Did Faith have a bad relationship with her brother? Did she have a brother? 

Christopher swallowed. He didn’t know the specifics of Faith’s concern, but he guessed joking about their relationship made it seem like he didn’t take it seriously. Nothing for it. He hadn’t come into this date with high expectations… but ‘friends’ isn’t what he was looking for. 

“Faith.”

***

Faith looked up. The door was open.

***

“I said something stupid.”

“No, I--”

Christopher held a hand up. “We don’t look like brother and sister and I don’t want us to…” Christopher floundered for what to say next. He didn’t find any more words. “Is that, uh… clear enough?”

Faith’s ears colored. She kept her face tilted downwards, but Christopher could see the slight curve of a smile on her lips. “Yeah.”

Christopher took in a breath. His face was hot. He started to speak. “This is--”

“Here it is!” The damn monkey girl appeared from fucking nowhere! ‘Dammit let me finish a sentence!’ Christopher thought. Her black tray bore a single tall glass filled with a brown-green liquid topped with whipped cream and two cherries. It bore twin straws twisted into the shape of hearts. The waitress excitedly placed the milkshake in between Faith and Christopher.

“Please let me-- the chef! Know how it is!” The monkey girl hurried off.

Christopher glanced after the monkey girl as she fled into the kitchen. She really was the only one working here wasn’t she?

Faith plucked one of the cherries from the milkshake and threw it into her mouth stem and all. Christopher raised an eyebrow. Faith swallowed the cherry then worked at the stem for a little while before she took it out of her mouth revealing a neatly tied knot.

“Ta-da!” She exclaimed triumphantly.

Christopher stared at the stem.

Faith stared at Christopher.

“Uh, I would have never even thought to do that?”

Faith shrugged bashfully. “I didn’t. Minnie taught me how and then said I should show you.”

“Show me? Why? Did she say what it means?”

Faith, a little confused herself, answered. “… no. She said ‘he’s American, he’ll know.’”

“She overestimates me.” Christopher tilted his head at his cherry. He felt curiosity swell inside him. He tried to mimic Faith’s display. He failed. Miserably.

“I can’t get this—”

“Bend the stem then hold it between your teeth.”

“Um frying.”

After much trial, error, and Faith’s instruction, Christopher managed to swallow the stem.

“Are you okay?!” Faith asked. She struggled to hold back her laughter.

Christopher coughed as he felt the solid mass slide down his esophagus. He swallowed, then squawked. “Yeah. Fine.”

“Do you need me to get you some water?”

“I’ll just drink some of this.” Christopher grabbed his straw, the pink heart shaped monstrosity that led into the bowels of that fateful milkshake. He took a sip.

Christopher felt his mouth BURN. He spit the contents of his milkshake into a napkin.

“Chris?!”

“Wasabi.” Christopher muttered. He grabbed another napkin to scrap off his tongue.

“What?”

“There’s wasabi in the fucking milkshake.”

***

>Spice up your love life.

What the waitress had said suddenly made sense to Faith. She shuddered. Then… she paused. She looked at the milkshake. Then to her date drawing more napkins from the receptacle next to him to clean himself off. He looked like he’d just had the worst thing he’d ever tasted. Chris hid what he was feeling pretty well, if this milkshake was bad enough to break that wall…. She looked back to the milkshake.

She reached forward.

“Faith…”

She grabbed the straw.

“Why?!”

She took a sip.

It was vile.

***

Christopher and Faith left the restaurant. The monkey girl had been put out that they had NOT enjoyed her milkshake. Though she was grateful for their honest feedback and Faith’s suggestion of cinnamon as an alternative. The two walked in silence down the street a little ways. Their minds occupied with the culinary ‘experience’ they’d just had. Then, as if rehearsed, they both burst out laughing.

“That was vile!”

“Why?! Why’d you drink it?!”

“I don’t know! You looked like you were about to throw up and… what kindof girlfriend would I be if I let you suffer alone?”

“A sane one?”

“I’m sane! Besides, if I hadn’t, right now you’d be complaining about that awful milk shake and I’d have no idea what you’re talking about. I’d just be sitting here nodding my head going ‘oh that sounds rough,’ until you got tired of hearing it!”

Christopher laughed. “So it’s fucking FOMO?!”

“… sortof.”

“What do you mean sortof?”

“Well, look.”

“Faith.”

“I was curious!”

Christopher shook his head. He stopped. He smiled a wicked smile. “… I’m going to tell Inigo and Hoge to ask for that milkshake.”

“That’s awful! … Do you think I could get the girls to do it?”

“IT’S WORTH A SHOT!”

Faith laughed at the thought. The idea of the girls screaming at her over text when the inevitably tried the milkshake… it was too good a thought to pass up.

Christopher still smiling looked over at his date. “How’d you meet anyway?”

“Huh?”

“You, Hailey, Minerva, Maxine, Edith.”

“What brought this up?”

“You asked about Inigo and I. So, now I’m curious.”

“…”

Faith colored. The truth was they met at the optometrist.

“Uh, you don’t have to, it’s not really my business.”

“4 walls.”

“Huh?”

“4 walls.” Faith insisted.

Christopher nodded. “Agreed.”

The two were approaching a pedestrian bridge. The bridge hung low over the street. Christopher felt himself go on alert. Back home, people liked to lurk under bridges like this. Muggers, drug dealers, didn’t matter, they were people you didn’t want to cross paths with. Still, this was Japan. This was Kyoto. The streets were clean. The cameras worked. He shouldn’t have to be on guard.

Faith, oblivious to Christopher’s change in demeanor, continued her story. “So… I have bad eyes.”

“Right.”

“… what do you mean right?!”

“You wear contacts.”

“…”

“… was I supposed to not notice?”

“They’re REALLY expensive lenses. YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO NOTICE!”

Christopher tilted his head to the side as they drew ever closer to the bridge. “Sorry?”

“It’s… fine.” Faith colored. ‘How close has he been looking?’ “Anyway, I met the girls while… I was getting my glasses.”

“Glasses?” Christopher asked. He looked at Faith closely. He tried to superimpose glasses on her face. Her face was oval shaped. Her nose was subtle. The glasses would help frame her face, draw his attention to places he wouldn’t usually be drawn to. The image wasn’t… unpleasant. ‘She really is pretty.’ Christopher blinked. ‘… Where’d that come from?’ He looked back at the bridge. His mind was a mess.

“Please don’t tell anyone.”

“4 walls remember? I won’t.” Christopher studied the path in front of them. He didn’t ask if the other girls had prescriptions, they obviously did, but that wasn’t Faith’s story to tell. He couldn’t imagine why she’d be so embarrassed about needing glasses. If she looked like THAT.

‘Goddammit brain.’ Christopher thought. ‘Where is this coming from?’ He avoided looking at her. He wasn’t sure what face he’d make right now.

‘He’s disgusted.’ Faith sighed as Christopher avoided looking at her. They stepped beneath the bridge. The fact that he’d already known about the contacts was completely lost to Faith’s mind. She shouldn’t have told him. She should’ve kept it a secret, she should’ve--

Christopher’s eyes widened. A shadow lay on the far side of the bridge. Behind a concrete pillar. The shadow was off, not quite humanoid. It had pointed ears. It was holding something in front of its body. A knife?! The report from this morning rang in his ears. ‘Villainous activity at an all time high.’ ‘Shit!’

Instincts born from living in a bad neighborhood caused Christopher to reach out and pull Faith close. He angled her behind him, away from the hazard, but kept hold in case there were other assailants he hadn’t seen.

Faith felt like she’d really fucked up. Everyone knew kids inherited the eyesight of their mom. Chris would know anyway. He wouldn’t want his kids-- Chris’s arm came around her shoulders.

‘What?!’

Christopher pulled Faith close. Her head rested against his chest. She could feel his heart pounding. Her face heated up. She stopped thinking.

Christopher felt his heart thump in his chest. ‘Fuck, fuck, fuck.’ He looked up at the bridge’s ceiling. Where he lived in St. Louis, there’d be circular mirrors mounted under the bridge so he could see behind the pillar. No such luck here. This was Kyoto a, up until last month, safe city. 

Christopher felt his grip on Faith’s shoulder tighten. He released a breath. He had Hailey and Hifumi’s quirks loaded. He could teleport Faith out right now. He could risk an encounter and hope his talent with Hailey’s quirk would see them through. Encounter sounded risky, he didn’t have a great track record actually WINNING fights and it wasn’t just his life at risk. He didn’t want Kaylee to happen again.

Faith’s head started to swirl. ‘Where was this coming from? Had… had Chris felt I was getting upset? Is he comforting me? Telling me I’m not disgusting for needing glasses?’ His hand squeezed her shoulder as if in confirmation. ‘He was!’ She sighed happily as she nuzzled into his chest. She couldn’t believe how connected she felt right now. She looked up to his face. He wasn’t looking at her. He looked so focused on the path ahead. Her eyes fell on his lips.

Christopher heard Faith’s breathing quicken. ‘Good she’s caught on.’ She buried her face into his chest. ‘Okay, yeah, more contact might help me visualize you, good thinking Faith.’ Christopher came to a stop, he was 7 meters from the pillar. Too far away to rush he hoped. He started to close his eyes. The shadow moved. ‘Too late jackass!’ Christopher thought. He was going to teleport her to his apartment, then they’d contact the po--

A cat walked from behind the pillar and yawned. It looked at Chris and Faith. It yawned again then sauntered off. The shadow was gone. Christopher flinched. How had a cat cast that long a shadow? He shook his head. Maybe it hadn’t? Maybe remembering the WcDonald’s had just set him on edge. He smiled tightly.

Christopher released Faith and turned towards her. “Sorry, I w--” She was looking at him. She was flushed. Her breathing was shallow. Her pupils were dilated.

‘What the fuck? Is she sick?’

“Don’t apologize.” Faith whispered. Her voice was low. Husky. ‘She IS sick.’

Faith threw her arms around Christopher’s neck, obviously for support. Christopher caught her under her arms, making sure she didn’t lose her balance. 

“Let’s g--”

She stood on her tiptoes and planted her lips on Chris’s own.

***

Christopher walked into his room in a daze. He sat on his bed. He put his hands on his lips. His cheeks felt hot. He couldn’t even remember the rest of the date. He took Faith home. He caught a bus. Came back…. That was a kiss. He just had his first kiss! 

Christopher smiled. It was a real smile.

Christopher’s phone buzzed.

>fides1104: Hey! Did you get home safe?
>LookingGlass: Yeah.
>fides1104: I had a lot of fun today
>LookingGlass: Next Saturday?
>fides1104: -_-?
>LookingGlass: Do you want to get together next Saturday?
>fides1104: ^_^
>LookingGlass: … don’t do this to me, is that a yes?
>fides1104: Yes! LMAO

Christopher fell back on his bed. He stared at the ceiling. In an hour he needed to go read to Kaylee. Then when he got home he needed to record everything that happened today. After that he’d need to deal with the barrage of messages from Inigo asking for details. He still needed to figure out what he was going to do about mom’s box. Not to mention the feud with Desolator looming over his head. Not now though. Right now, he just wanted to stare at the ceiling and remember.

	A/N: Do not actually try the grilled cheese and salmon sandwich. You need Babushka magic to make it taste good.
