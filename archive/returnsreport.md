!!!note Disclaimer & Limitations
Before we proceed, I should note that the Returns Report is still a work-in-progress. In its finished state, the Returns Report will also include losses/gains of net worth due to gacha, betting, and market fluctuations, painting a whole and complete picture of individual components that caused your net worth to change over the week.
The data collection has several limitations:
• It does not include data from closed wallets.
• Inactivity is denoted solely by the lack of trades in the past week.
• If someone were to open and close their wallets over the week, it’d only count the open-wallet period.
• User had to exist at the moment the beginning of the week, when data collection started.
So, if you are active and want to see your performance in those reports, set your wallet to public!

Due to peculiarities of the data collection, there is a single case in which an active account would not be featured in the Returns Report, even with an open wallet. All three conditions have to be fulfilled:
• Account was created last year.
• Account’s wallet is open.
• Account never bought a coin.
In this single case, that account would need to be manually added. No active accounts fulfill those conditions right now. Nevertheless, if you do not appear in the Returns Report and would 1) want to 2) fulfill three criteria above, please send a direct message to Triangle Consulting.
