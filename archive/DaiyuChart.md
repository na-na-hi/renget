####Disciples####

>Yasha, Pokémon Trainer
"Poor kid, being trapped and forced to fight like an animal for the entertainment of bloodthirsty monsters... At least he turned out fine for someone enslaved by a devil sect!" 

"While it's possible to adapt even a demonic technique for something good and consuming souls is part of refining one's soul, it's still a bit worrysome for a young boy to hold a technique meant for a devil sect, so i'm sure he could make use of someone to make sure he's not going the wrong path"

>Ming Ming, Capitalism, Ho!
"Isn't it adorable to see a little girl taking after her family's business?"

>Zheng Hao, Magic Fingers
"To be a doctor is such a wonderful and noble path is it not? And to think that so many would be capable of slaughtering these kind people for their treasures... I can't let those animals escape their due punishment!"

"It's a tragedy that living peacefully simply isn't possible these days, but i hope he'll be able to keep his eyes on his goal, it'd be a shame to see such a promising physician converting their trade into a tool of slaughter in pursuit of vengeance."

>Nobu, Operation Martial Storm
"A fool who worships war,  existence of such is more than proof enough that the current heavens are in disarray, and so are the daoists for allowing this beast to keep on breathing." 

"He's not any different from the barbarian, the only difference is that this one is able to show a little bit more discretion... In fact he is worse, Demonic beasts were never humans in the first place, but this one has chosen to discard his humanity"

>Yexin, possible furry build
"What a cursed existence this child has!  Born to a sect of vile snakes only to be kidnapped and raised by a demon.  

"Not all yaoguai are evil, but an animal that hunts humans has to be put down, and so a girl imitating one cannot remain nor should a repulsive technique built on slaughter and defilement of the dead be allowed to exist.

>Heng Zhiqiang, Ultimate Kuudere
"Bullying a defenseless kid, the gall of some people! So what if his predecessors have gone insane or became devils? That doesn't mean you can punish him for something he hasn't even done! ... Well it's not like those worries are completely unfounded, but still!" 

"Keeping his sanity so far is quite the heroic feat but it's hard to believe he'll manage to keep it for long when he's completely detached from everyone else so he clearly needs an aunty to keep him in check and teach him that there's more to life than simply suffering!" 

"Well if all goes wrong, i can always just throw him into a sealing formation and forget about him, either way i still need to get strong enough to get rid of those like the Golden Man who force their sinful ideas onto the innocent"

>Dónall, Hare-oic Rabbit
"Rabbits are curious little things aren't they? Seeing one of them walking the path of a great hero is not something you see every day, it's always nice to see someone who can still live freely despite all the problems in this world"

####Elders####

>Dong Do, A real fishy guy
"Trying to stay peaceful these days is quite the struggle, you can't really take a breather without being forced into a life or death battle, keeping at it is very admirable. Perhaps there is a thing or two brother could teach me, but that's something i can only check after meeting him"

>Xiu Yi, Hot Woman (literally)
"Killing one's family is a very grave sin, so i'd like to verify with my own two eyes the truth of the matter you never know how many of those aren't just a set up to finish up a botched job. 

"She also has a sister who controls thunder doesn't she? Even if does turn out that they're both irredeemable villains, studying both purifying flames and thunder could be worth the trouble of meeting them... Well at least i'm certain that i'm the cutest thunder user."

>Guan Chāo, didn’t listen to his pastor’s warnings
"A creature as disgusting as the things it worships. Scum that not only defiles himself but others, every second that it draw breath is an affront to all that is good." 

"I've been fortunate enough to find victims early enough to cleanse their bodies, but as i'm not a doctor i can't always help those who have reached a critical stage. For all those who have suffered at his hands i must deliver Heavenly judgement against this vermin and his ilk."

>Gyldenwulf, least violent cultivation protagonist
"A rampaging beast that only knows how to lash out isn't any different no matter where it comes from, animals that harm humans get put down, nothing more complicated than that."

>Morgain Blackheart, Tumblr Sexyman
"Puppetry is such a unique art... How unfortunate that this puppeteer is a shameless scam artist."

>Jian, Split Personality (haha get it split like with a sword)
"A cute little thing i've met once by chance, tragically bound to a demon blade.  By the next time we meet, it will almost certainly be in a battlefield, i can't allow a demon sword to keep on consuming souls, i can only hope that the girl behind the sword will survive the process... i'm sure a instrument would be more fitting to her than a sword."

>Wen Lifen, Slaanesh’s Strongest Soldier
"Selling your soul to a demon, it's hard to think of a way to sink even lower than that. I'm not yet at the point that i could cut this problem at the root, so completely wiping out the Wen clan off the map isn't doable yet, it would simply run away somewhere else and start it all over again even i could kill the clan members, but that doesn't mean i can't get rid of a few of them."

>Leanne Pierpoint, Red Flag Raiser
"Finding friends to help you out against a bully is nice isn't it? But i'm a little worried if this foreign girl won't end up being swayed by devil cultivators seeking to abuse her ignorance... If she doesn't end up swallowed by evil, i'd be more than happy to help her out."

>Kay Lee, Crossover Episode
"We've been seeing a lot of those weird foreigners lately haven't we? There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with her outside of her obsession with battle, but she does have some odd views. What values does an unbreakable body have if your soul will crumble at the slightest touch? True strength lies in reading the opponent's intention and hiding yours

>Xicotl, how come your mom lets you have THREE gods?
"Yet another one who has bent their knees to devils in search for power, needless to say nothing changes."

>Lan Jiangmei, The Martial Realm’s Next Masterchef
"Being part of a political movement is such a pain, it's not surprise she decided to quit it for the life of travelling cook. Pretty great decision in my opinion, even if you aren't a body temperer eating is one of best things in life! Her cooking technique does look peculiar, maybe there is something more to it than just a common technique?

####Ancestors####

>Xū, Void Parisian
"A guy so old his crime has fallen into oblivion.... Unfortunately i'm a few grades too low to actually check it myself, what a shame."

>Zhihao Cheng, Ace Attorney
"Uncle has a pretty interesting story but is severing yourself from fate really possible? Is it not your fate to do so? Those deep discussions aren't exactly my forte but in the end uncle has realized that the Laws that rule over Heaven are currently broken, so certainly there's something to be learnt from him."

>Chenrezig Bodhisattva, didn’t read the Bodhisattva Precepts
"It's that easy even for a buddhist to fall while trying to uphold justice huh? Such extreme and disproportional punishments ...."
