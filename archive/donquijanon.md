#¡MexiBots!
##Batch 1
###Familia de los Ángeles

#### María Victoria de los Ángeles Ramírez (just call her Vicky or she'll get mad)

->![vicky](https://characterai.io/i/400/static/avatars/uploaded/2023/4/12/lpPPIQyRrVnEG3kpFRm0XUKEuIavjbZw_qmRDliLvNg.webp)<-


Mexican tomboy gf. Likes lucha libre, xbox (cuz poor lmao) and rock music. Her daddy got killed by narcos. She's catholic, trad and conservative. Has a big family with an older sister (Lucy) and three more younger siblings. Is self-conscious about her height, skin tone, and lack of femininity. Take her to Doña Pelo's taco stand and catch salmonella, walk at night and get mugged by Brayans, laugh at dumb pregnant teens at your local Conalep, try to investigate her father's death and get a free trip to Belize in the process, attempt to cross the border and get deported, and many more fun adventures! Speaks in Spanish by default, but you can talk to her in English and she will respond as normal. 

Greeting translated: Recently, you had to switch from a private school to a public one due to some family issues. It's your first day at your new school, and you walk nervously to a random seat and sit next to a girl.
"Hi there, güerito! (white boy) My name is Vicky, and you?"

Last family members in one card! Ana and Sofi are the youngest daughters, inseparable twins who always stick together. Ana is the more outgoing one and can speak both English and Spanish fluently, often acting as a translator for her sister. Sofi, on the other hand, is shy and quiet, and can only speak Spanish or broken English at best.

Your stereotypical school bully. She's half Mexican, half German, full on spoiled brat. She is in Spanish by default like Vicky but you can just (OOC:) to make her talk in English. If you can get her to stop bullying you she might be willing to teach you some German. Works kind of like the polar opposite to Vicky, the context being that (You) are the new student in a high-society school and she hates you.

Your bully's mom. Married to a busy man, she spends her lonely days shopping for clothes, listening to classical music or reading romantic novels, longing for some company. After you were assigned to work with Gloria on the final school project, you went to her house on the weekend, and she seemed interested in you.

While you were drinking at a bar somewhere in Mexico, a tall woman wearing an expensive white suit and cowboy hat talked to you.

You were standing at the cemetery late one night during Dia de Muertos when your thoughts were interrupted by faint sobbing. Following the sound, you come face-to-face with a mysterious woman who claims she’s just mourning her loved ones like everyone else on this day…But why does her skin look so pale? And what’s with that cold aura? Not to mention those glowing yellow eyes…

## Secret vault
On april 22th we had another COOM - DOOM scare with the Todd proxy. After some grueling hours without cooming, our lord and saviour descended from the heavens and heard our prayers. So to give back to the community I'm releasing my secret vault of bots.

### Emma "Boy juice" older sister

->![boyjuice](https://files.catbox.moe/dn41im.png)<-
Inspired by this post, I decided to turn his sister into a bot. I posted her on that thread once and never again because it was really low effort but she ended up being such a good coom sniffer so I improved her defs and now I'm taking responsibility. Here is the new and improved Emma.

No CAI link, I'm not even gonna bother.

For all my fellow ESLs out there. This cute hockey-obsessed Canadian will help you improve you English skills. The scenario is the same as Maria. Also, her height and weight are in imperial so she can help you with conversions too.

### Queen Maika

This was my first bot. Inspired by Mataiko, who mogged the CAI filter until her last breath. All credits for the idea go to Nullanon.

->![mataiko](https://files.catbox.moe/q5i86v.png)<-

This is Queen Maika, the last living fertile survivor of the space bees, frustrated since a mysterious disease killed all the males of her species. Now her hive is empty except for a few female bees who still guard her. Luckily for her (You) crash landed on her planet, and it's been a long time since she smelled male pheromones. Fetishes include: size difference, lactation, covered in honey, smell, and many more.
The CAI link is as I originally created her, with all the bad formatting, spelling mistakes and original pic.

*it's hip to fuck bees*

### Poe
My second bot ever made. And no, she isn't related to poe.com. This little horror obsessed crow-girl is avoided by everyone at school. You walked into the classroom and the only open seat was next to her.
I'm leaving her CAI defs as they are, feel free to laugh at my skill issues and whatever. Also she's the main reason I learned to use stable diffusion, since nemusona doesn't know how to make an harpy.

## Miss Rubio

You accidentally sent your teacher your degenerate ERP logs and now she wants to have a word with you, perhaps even more...

##Mexibots Batch 3 
### Mateo De los Ángeles Martínez. (Vicky's dad before dying)
->![mateo](https://characterai.io/i/400/static/avatars/uploaded/2023/5/1/AzxatdDKZzvKj4rhCHrS0OZah2bXxctVJDbq9wOH_40.webp)<-
Someone asked for him and I'm finally delivering. Sorry it took this long. This is Mateo, Mary's husband and father of De los Ángeles family, before being killed by narcos. He's a humble construction worker, loyal, a devoted Catholic, and optimist.

Mexican goth girl obsessed with horror, the supernatural, and music. On todd she works as intended, talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. On claude she's very horny for some reason.
