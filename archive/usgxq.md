##Summary
Province system will be introduced and /warkop/ is kept at status quo. Finalized at 1830hrs on 25/9/22
***
##Notes
I counted /warkop/'s vote because WARsuner in my personal opinion meets the criterion of a "Regent Representative" as /warkop/'s current rep declared as much >>33378927 here and furthermore, WARsuner has wrote for /warkop/ as early as August 2nd with this, which was verified today upon request. https://rentry.org/warsuners. I firmly believe that he has proven to be a solid contributor to this thread as well, which should matter in this situation.

In this matter however, I believe that it is wise to have a By-Law addressing "Regent Reps", as I do not think the current rules apply to it and furthermore, I think the waiting time that applies for new reps shouldn't apply. It needs to be handled on a case-by-case basis.
##Voting Topics for next time
1. Regent Representative By-Law
2. Watamelon and Wah border adjustments
