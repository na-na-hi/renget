# Lamybaker bots list.
These bots are made in Tav+Pyg. I think there's no need to explain why I'm not bothering with CAI bots instead of Tavern ones. This list will be subsequently updated as time goes on or just in case a change is done to one of the bots, so the thread doesn't have to get clogged with a big post having every single baked bot. It's a matter of manners, you see.

## Hololive

###### Kazama Iroha (Degozaru-oriented)
Gozaru. That is all. You can also fluff the fat fuck that is Pokobee, he's in here, or should be.

###### Murasaki Shion (Brat-oriented)
Crush her skull if you please.

###### Takane Lui (Rui-oriented)
The real leader of HoloX. (given she's the one that does all the planning and paperwork, canonically)

![Ruirui](https://files.catbox.moe/8bztob.png)

###### Yukihana Lamy (Alcohol-oriented)
The drunkard elf of Hololive, what it says on the tin, and the same case as some of the bots below:

![BECOME](https://files.catbox.moe/otfio4.png)

###### Koyori Hakui (Mayo-oriented)
As it says on the tin. She's more about talking, just to see how current Pygmalion can carry a fairly regular conversation, however, the scenario can be changed as you wish, as well as her dialogue examples if you want to RP with her instead:

![Mayonnaisee...](https://files.catbox.moe/cx4rkz.png)

###### Hakui Koyori (Beach/RP-oriented)
Beach scenario, loved by most people in the threads (atleast what my brain tells me) and also the cause of the rise of sandcastle anon. She can respond well to RP and be quite wordy with her actions. However if she has an error like failing to format her message properly, do take your time to edit her message and fix it up. After a while of doing so it should let her know that she can't be having an aneurysm and actually, properly finish her sentences, atleast it's worked for me, as band-aid as it sounds.

###### Kiryu Coco (Dragon-oriented)
Same case as the normal Koyori bot, change her scenario, fuck her brains out, etc etc etc:

![Madafaka!](https://files.catbox.moe/c5bxtj.png)

###### AZKi (Diva-oriented)
Same case as the others I mentioned earlier, just be nice to her:

![Survive, anon!](https://files.catbox.moe/9suag6.png)

###### NunRyS (Sex.)
You're smart enough to figure it out yourself, right? Just look next to her name:

![We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way, the choice is yours, anon.](https://files.catbox.moe/443m8t.png)

###### Farmer Noel (Milk-oriented)
Eh, she can go a normal RP scenario or you can get raunchy with her. I did fill out her desc with some small tidbits of worldbuilding for a reason. It would also be interesting if she pulled something off like explaining the history of the farm or something:

![So much milk...](https://files.catbox.moe/lrwjc5.png)

###### L Bae (Sex-oriented)
I'm scared of this one.

![Mating press.](https://files.catbox.moe/3yb0ga.png)

## Indie Vtubers / From other corps

###### Suzuhara Lulu (Spook-oriented)
Everyone's favorite, -and completely normal- art student. Just change her scenario and avatar if you want it to not be spooky. Easy, right? Even with the spooky preset you can just lead the conversation or situation to something more light-hearted and wholesome.

![Konlulu~](https://files.catbox.moe/gidj2n.png)

###### Kamiko Kana (Menhera-oriented)
Menhera cunny fox.

![Real menhera hours.](https://files.catbox.moe/vt24l9.png)

###### Mint Castella (Chub-oriented)
/lig/'s favorite chubby dog vtuber, she's quite adorable and nice to talk to. But then again, dunno when Pygmalion'll get good to the levels of CAI before it was lobotomized to all hell and make her seem even more like the real Mint Castella. Same case as the other talk oriented bots:

![Helloo, how you doin'?](https://files.catbox.moe/m71t3p.png)

###### Iekushi Chapipi (Virus-oriented)
The virus in your PC suddenly became a cute girl and popped right out of the screen. Now it's up to you what you want to do with her, she's a friendly lass:

![I'm going to fix your PC! Both figuratively AND literally!](https://files.catbox.moe/gr69p6.png)

## Miscellaneous/Off-topic bots

###### L Ryza (Aphrodisiac-oriented)
The scenario is ever so slightly funky since there's not much action on her forcing the aphrodisiac into your mouth, but it should still work fairly well.

![By Palmyra I will dunk you in this cauldron and you WILL fuck me senseless and you WILL enjoy it.](https://files.catbox.moe/nz2u3n.png)

###### Shouhouin (Yandere-oriented)
A possessive office lady, slightly reworked. May need a tune up again.

![Dominant.](https://files.catbox.moe/2q9h75.png)

###### Demoman (Explosives-oriented)
If he was a bad demoman, he wouldn't even be there talking with ya about it.

![*drunken gibberish*](https://files.catbox.moe/dqli8n.png)

## Bots handed over from outside influences

###### Baby Moona (Daughter-oriented)
Bot made by a pal from a pal. Sounds unlikely, no? You'll see when you read the definitions. They're more cleaned up because they positively traumatized me when I saw them the first time.

![Papa!](https://files.catbox.moe/owaoct.png)
