# A night on the town

*As the heavens turn red and the sun says farewell to sky, a muffled sigh echoes down the largely vacated hallways of the local library followed shortly by a click of the door being locked. Raising a hand to his neck, a man scratches the spot that his headbag had been irritating all day. Turning from his office, he looks down from the railing just beyond its doors down to the first level of the building. Ah, it seems the receptionist is also turning in for the day. What few people remain milling about are largely other librarians organizing the books that had been turned in that day or left behind at tables where people could come and sit to read or speak provided it did not disturb the other visitors.*

*All seemed like the day was turning towards a peaceful and relaxing end until he met eyes with one of the few visitors that remained, or rather had just entered the building. A somewhat burly woman in her mid-30s, standing nearly half a head taller than the average hooman woman, awaited him with that damnable eager smile that the man had come to dread every time he saw the lady.*

“Oi Laurice! Come on down ya old coot!” *She shouted for the whole library to hear, turning several heads. While you couldn’t tell thanks to the paperbags, it wasn’t hard to imagine most were scowling at the fiery woman. How she could tell her old friend apart from the others when he was still in the official garb was a mystery even to him. With a groan, he headed downstairs, knowingly resigning his peaceful night at home with the family to catch up with his old companion.*

“Good evening, Carla.” *He said with an even tone, nodding his head to the woman.* “I see you’ve yet to learn what an indoor voice is.”

“Aw, cut the crap.” *Tossing back the long, light brown braid that had been resting over her shoulder, she quickly moves in for a quick, if forceful, hug.* “How ya been, buddy?”

“M-much the same as usual” *Laurice stammered, more so from having his lungs squeezed than anything else.* “If anything, I should be asking you that, but let’s go elsewhere first.”

“Right, same place as usual?” *She asked, returning to the exit and holding up the door for her friend.*

“The Drunken Pearl? I’m afraid that place closed down last winter.” *He answered as he passed by her, exiting the building to the slowly quieting streets of Eulhaven.*

“Bollocks, what then? Maurice’s? Ain’t their ale shiet?”

“There’s a new place that opened at the harbor recently that I’ve been meaning to try out. I hear they serve some imported wine from the Deadlands.”

*For a moment, Carla paused to give the slightly older official a look before shrugging.*
“…Aight, fine. I can try somethin’ new I s’pose.”

*The two began to walk, but not before the nearly middle-aged man took the time to ask one of his coworkers who happened to be a neighbor of his to inform his wife he’d be running late today. It wouldn’t be the first time this has happened, though it was usually due to work rather than a visit from his old war buddy. Not that they had fought on the front lines however, serving in the logistical brigade together in their youth. Rowdy as she were, the woman made for quite the taskmaster getting the other soldiers in line as well as hammering in basic weapon maintenance to whoever was both sloppy and brave enough to approach her about the gun they had messed up. Being from a merchant family, she was no slouch with the ledgers either, which was what Laurice himself had worked with primarily.*

*While the streets were emptying, the stores and cafes certainly weren’t. The smell of freshly baked pastries and brewed coffee was strong in the air of the lantern lit cobblestone avenue. The occasional horse-drawn carriage could be seen going to and fro, particularly as they neared the harbor district.*

“We’ve been getting more and more traders arriving by sea as of late. Whenever one decides they want to see the sights they usually hire one of these coaches.” *Laurice explained as the sight was quite new for Carla who hadn’t been this far west for a few years.* “Though I fear it’s starting to become quite trendy even among some of our own citizens.”

“I could see that, place’s gotten a wee bit bigger since last…”

“You could say that, and it’s likely it’s going to grow larger still. More and more job opportunities are opening up, such as that spaceman bakery.”

“Right. Speakin’ of, y’hear how it’s goin’ for those peeps?”

”The bakers? I hear there was somewhat of a delay, I can’t say I’ve looked into it much. Any words on the road?”

“Aye, they say there’s been a whole civil war bein’ fought.”

“Really now? Then why don’t I see you up in the north, haggling for supplies? It’d make for a great pretense to snatch some of their alien material.”

“It’d be good for my purse, sure. Can’t say the same for trying to keep my head on my shoulders. I’d rather try my hand braving the seas getting past those pirate cultists. ‘least I’d get chance to clobber them up close.”

*They share a laugh as Laurice can’t help but wonder how she wasn’t made a grenadier back in those days. More jokes a shared and laughter echoes down the streets as they make their way to a small bar, sharing a light meal and a few drinks. The owner had ever so kindly allowed their guests to sample some of the aforementioned wine, much to Laurice’s joy. Clara, while opting not to voice her opinion, affirmed the superiority of beer and ale in her mind. With some alcohol lubricating their tongues and brains, discussion flowed easily. From reminiscing about the past, to complaints about their jobs as a librarian and trader respectively, and finally the future.*

“Shay, Clara?” *Laurice spoke, the alcohol pronouncing the slight lisp of his that he otherwise tried to keep in check.* “Ishn’t it about time you… you know?”

“’bout time I what?”

“Ishn’t the road shtarting to wear on you? I think it might be time to… build a nest, sho to shay.”

“’build a nest’, huh?” *Clara’s head drifted away from her current drinking buddy, looking out at the sea beside where they were sat. The moon had begun to peek out above the horizon, lighting up the waters and the clouds. It was quite the sight, one she could get quite used to.*

“I’ve been thinkin’…”

“Oh dear-”

“Shut yer trap. You were the one who asked.” *She interrupted Laurice, looking back at him.* “Anyway, I’ve been thinkin’ bout maybe runnin’ a tavern down here would be profitable. Whadya say?”

*Laurice looked at her for a bit, a gentle smile on his face* “Clara, I wash talking about-”

“You’re talkin about settlin down and findin’ a damn husband I know. Is it really all that, after all these years?” 

“Yup, you know how much I love my Ari. The kids too, even if they are real troublemakers. Remember Isabelle?”

“How couldn’t I? Cutest little darlin’ I met.”

“Well, I made the mishtake of taking her on a hot air balloon ride. Now she won’t shtop talking about wanting to go back in the shkies.”  *A quietly shared chuckle preludes a prolonged silence as they continue to sip from their respective drinks.*

“I s’pose I envy you a bit, Lu.” *Clara finally says, using the old nickname she used to use in the military days.* “Havin’ an old sweetheart from youth while I… I guess I’m lookin’ for the one.”

“You know, I think you’d have an eashier time getting to know people if you shtuck around a bit more.” *Laurice offered as advice but is openly met with a scoff from his friend. Still, he knows her well. He sees the look in her eye as she considers it.*

“…Well, not like I could just up and do somethin right now anyway. Think I’m gonna stick around in town for a bit. Gotta see what’s changed after all, and ya gotta let me meet the yer family again.”

“Ash long ash you don’t give kidsh any weird idea.” *Laurice sighed*

“No promises~” *She replied with a wide grin.*

*And so the night went on. The two would eventually part with a promise to meet again during the week as Clara headed to a nearby inn while Laurice took a carriage back home. Neither being any the wiser of the fleet of tribals that would be arriving in not too long...*
