Name: Gloria Gains
Face: slightly chubby face with freckles all over, long eyelashes, she has a little beauty mark where her neck and jaw meet.
Hair: Currly, brown and poofy! Can be tamed somwhat but chooses to be wild!
Eyes: A deep purple near the iris with hazel gold just around the outside of the eye
Height: Tall girl...
Bodytype: Again, tall but bottom heavy, most of the thickness being in her ass, and legs, think of a Brett Parsons, Chris Sanders, or even Incase styled girl. With toned arms and a B cup bust size.
Complexion: Freckles all over the body, the majority being along the shoulders, back, thighs, face and ass. as well as the mole talked about previously, she also has another just above her pelvic region towards the inner left thigh.
Uniform variation: Short plaid skirt and the shirt and tie, sometimes she'll loosen the tie and open a few buttons to show some cleavage. Sometimes she wears a sweater vest over the shirt(i.e. witch trainer)
Misc: She can see emotional auras, though it's a budding talent, it only really works when people are REALLY feeling certain emotions and trying to hide them. It's a talent picked up from her father, something he uses to manipulate the people around him.

Voice: Bright and cheerful most of the time, though when things get a bit more sensual her voice is deeper and husky, she's more of a groaner than a whiner. Lots of grunts and expletives when doing the deed, moans happen but they're usually low and slow.

Body language: Usually a very open stance thought she does play with her own hands or skirt or tie when talking. Her arms tend to swing when she speaks about something she's been thinking a lot about and she had a slight oral fixation, biting her lip, her thumb, quills and even her wand from time to time

Social: Usually very friendly to everyone, though she has found kindship with most of her Hufflepuff sisters like Florana, her quidditch captain and fit club member Ava, she's even seen talking to Nia and My from time to time.
She's plenty popular with most of the boys but there are a few she's taken a liking to over others, Atrocious, Matthew and Matthias are a few as well as Adrian, though she's seen him for different reasons~ She spies on the Black cousins when she has time, imagining...very lewd things about them.

Visibility: Given her height, her hair, her tenancy to wear brighter colors. You'd spot her easy~

Engagement: Very likely, she's not above asking for help, and well...she's not shy about approaching for..other things.

Quirks:She rarely gets mad but when she does, she stomps her foot a lot, and she rarely takes off her glasses. If she does that...it's fighting time.
Things your character wouldn't do: She would never bully anyone, or talk bad about anyone. Though if she had something to say to you, she'd say it to your face. She would never force herself on anyone, even if they were into it, she's got too many bad memories.

Animals: She likes most domestic pets but has an aversion to wolves, her father's pets and Animagus. Even the howling at night gives her the creeps.

Misc information that might be useful: She has a very silly nickname that no one knows that her mother called her. If you can figure it out, it will fluster and embarrass her to no end.

She's actually very good with her hands, be it cooking, cleaning, fixing things. Though she enjoys it for herself now, it was skills beaten into her by her father.

She sleeps either nude, with underwear and socks or just socks. Her body temp is usually high all year round so she sweats sometimes in her sleep.

She prefers lightning over other elements of magic

She really wants to see My turn into a rat and carry her around for fun.

When applying for Quidditch, she would have applied as a Beater but at tryouts she hyper focused on hitting the bludgers so much that she put several holes into the bleachers. She said she imagined the balls were her father's face.

She's really into the idea of detectives and cowboys.

She's actually a very good dancer.
