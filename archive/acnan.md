The Assistant brought a tall glass of water to the bird.

Stetikekiak immediately sat up straight in the cafeteria chair, tail jolting back and forth. "You brought!" Unlike most other Vox the human had ever seen, Steti was lithe and curvy to the point of being hard to take his eyes off of-- and even after he'd joined the crew a month ago, gaining an Assistant ID and jumpsuit, he still often wore that slim, form-fitting 'stealth suit' of latex and soft rubber which the Assistant was convinced was made for kinky purposes. His previously quite stiff and worried-looking form was now relaxed to the point of complete comfort, and he'd integrated into the Nanotrasen 'office' culture quickly enough. The Assistant didn't even spot an erection in the bird's suit, and his modified jumpsuit covered up some of his sultry form.

"Yeah, yeah, I brought." He smiled meekly, setting the glass down for Steti. "It's just water, y'know." With a little groan as he let out some steam, the human sat right next to his friend. He felt a decent bit of comfort being around the bird, and certainly more than with most crewmembers.

Steti patted him softly in the shoulder. "I asked for and you went and got. That's very nice." He slid the glass back and forth a moment, watching the water sway back and forth. "...okay, now must look away."

"This again?" The Assistant crossed his arms, frowning a bit. Still, he turned his head away as he could hear the Vox slowly undoing the lock of his helmet to the stealth suit, placing it down, and taking a few long swigs of water. He knew he wasn't supposed to turn around until the helm was back on, and he also wanted to greatly, but stopped himself short every time, waiting until Steti was fully suited again.

The bird shrugged slowly. "It is just... feel more comfortable with helmet."

Nodding slowly, the Assistant took in a breath. "And the rest'a the suit?"

"Comfort thing, also."

He couldn't help but chuckle. "Well, I get that you think it's a comfort thing, but you know how I got my doubts."

Steti laughed alongside. "Of course is useful for... other things. But not all the time. Maybe do not like station air, or having to get in or out for space walks. That is all I want say on the matter." He leaned on the table, eying the Assistant calmly, until he shot up like he'd remembered something, which the human was plenty used to. "Oh! But I did modify for more easy stay-in. Don't have to take off for bathroom now." Stetikekiak pulled down the zipper on his jumpsuit and grasped his groin through the latex suit, much to the Assistant's confusion, but then revealed a couple of flaps which had been seamlessly modded in, letting him flop out his soft, bluish length onto the chair a moment.

"Ah, jeez." The Assistant went a little flush, crossing his legs. His demeanor had similarly softened once he'd started hanging out with the squeak-face. "Bathroom and... other things?"

The bird similarly went flush, in a manner somehow a little visible through the helmet. "Well, y-yes." He sat up straighter, tilting his head to the side. "Did you want...?"

"No, no, uh, not right this sec." He clenched up a little in unwanted arousal. "We've probably got stuff to do, right?"

Steti pulled back, laughing with a bit of nervousness. "Sorry. I guess do have... things could do." He began to stuff his length back into the flaps and zip up his jumpsuit, a more inconvenient affair than releasing it. "Maybe could work at Security more? I was learning how to use baton, and started to get pretty good at."

The Assistant took a long breath. "...Still pretty wacked out they're lettin' ya work there after the way you got here."

"Yes," the Vox muttered, "but thankful." He didn't want to mention just how much he had to 'convince' the Head of Security to let him get an internship. To some degree, it felt like it would invalidate the achievement.

"Yeah. I mean, good for ya!" The human patted Steti on the shoulder. "Guess I can't help but feel kinda inferior. I mean, I've just been part of the tide since... I dunno, since I got hired. You're already movin' up."

Stetikekiak leaned back in the cafeteria seat a moment, thinking. "Do want to come to next intern job? I think you will still better than me at most things, use experience. You are... 'robust', very."

The Assistant hummed. "I dunno. I guess I do wanna hang out with ya in less sexual contexts, more."

"Yes!" said Steti. "Would be fun."

He spotted a forming grin on the Assistant's face, and whisked both of them suddenly out of the chairs-- embracing him on the hips for a moment, almost drawn to the immediate intimacy. The human quietly uttered, "...thanks for lookin' out for me still, Steti." He leaned forward, calmed down though not entirely worry-free, but the moment was cut short as somebody with loud footsteps hurried his way into the empty cafeteria.

Stetikekiak and the Assistant broke apart to face the new arrival. It was a Grey, standing with a simultaneously very thin and muscly build, a solid brow and steely expression, and clothed in a formal orderly's outfit, tie, and white shoes. He stood firm and tilted his head down a bit, voice bitter before he'd heard a single word. "Stetikekiak. The CMO has noticed your lack of a recorded checkup." Steti cocked his head, and the orderly continued. "As a member of the crew, a medical checkup is required. You must come to the Medbay immediately."

"Never heard'a anything like this," the Assistant said, squinting a bit. "Are you sure you're--"

The Grey immediately interjected. "You've never been requested by our CMO. This bird was. Now, come." He swung an arm forth and clasped it around Steti's, who stiffened up and took a single slow step back.

The bird squawked, "What he said! Are sure?"

"Very sure, and now very impatient." He began to pull at his arm, beckoning Steti away with plenty of force, and finally he managed to get him to start moving towards the exit. The Assistant just meekly raised up an arm to wave.

"See ya in a bit?" he asked.

Steti clenched his beak in the helmet. "Should be soon." He swivelled his head to face the orderly, but before he could give any kind of protest, he was being whisked away by force, and struggled to keep up with the twunky Grey's pace. They hurried through hallways for a minute until they'd reached the entrance to Medbay, a place Steti had luckily avoided until this very moment. He was rushed inside and greeted with a waft of clinical, odd-smelling air, and instead of being examined or treated near the Chemistry front desk or by any of the nearby doctors, the orderly continued bringing Steti further and deeper inside Medbay. Various staff and injured patients alike gave the both of them a side-eye-- a worried expression that the bird didn't know what to make of. He just tried to keep his feet moving to keep up until he was greeted with a patient room door and brought inside. The orderly immediately shut the airlock closed behind them, and put the shades up on the reinforced glass window, leaving the room somewhat dim.

The interior was somewhat spacious, including a wide patient bed and plenty of medical equipment, but what caught Stetikekiak's eye was the large leather examination chair, which the orderly dragged him towards immediately. He was once again unable to squawk out any sort of protest before he was pushed into the seat, and the Grey swapped on the overhead light, suddenly making his suit shine quite a bit more vibrantly. Nothing was hidden from view, but the comfortable leather forced him to settle a bit, relaxed and worried at the same time.

"When is doctor coming?" he asked, hesitantly. "Or... are you doctor?"

The orderly put his hands behind his back as if trying to contain any movement, mouth clenched. "The Chief Medical Officer will be in shortly."

Steti shook his head slowly. "Isn't just a checkup? Could you not use just sleeper technology or scanner or..."

He trailed off as he noticed the Grey stiffening further, taking in a sharp, audible breath. "The Chief Medical Officer will be in shortly," he repeated. "You were requested in a patient room. I've retrieved you per my orders. Stay until you're finished."

"I know how worked on Shoal," the bird cawed, starting to sit up and clamber out of the chair. "You can just use scanner. I don't want inconvenient your--"

With no warning, the orderly shot forward, thin arms suddenly brimming with strength as he held Steti's arms down. The bird started to fight it, but had very little physical prowess of his own, and was rather easily strapped in, both arms against the armrests in tight leather restraints. "Stay until you're /finished/," he reiterated.

Stetikekiak squawked out loudly. "I do not want! No medical problems, no need for-- /stop/!"

The orderly simply took a few steps back and a long, matching sigh, watching the Vox struggle desperately against the bindings. It was no use, of course, but even now he was seething with jealousy. He hadn't gotten this kind of treatment in so long, and now Stetikekiak was resisting it like his life depended on it. Perhaps it did.

He would continue screeching out in protest for a few minutes before giving up, panting a little and sitting still, dejected. Finally, the airlock slipped open, and the slim chance of help dissipated when Steti saw who it really was. Stepping in with a lithe and short posture was another Grey, though this one was dressed in a high-skirted Chief Medical Officer coat alongside incredibly long legs. The height of that skirt was enough to put the CMO's black panties in full view, as well as a pair of garters attached to thigh-high stockings in matching color and white, form-fitting shoes around their two-toed alien feet. As he entered, they put their shoes delicately in the corner of the room, letting out a breath of relaxation... a throaty breath, slightly masculine. Steti had initially thought this might be a female Chief of Staff, but then he spotted the Grey's flat chest and impression of a semi-hard pointed dick pressed up /tight/ against his skirt. He stepped up to the patient chair in front, sporting a thin little grin. "Stetikekiak."

"Y-Yes," the bird stammered. "You are... Chief Medical Officer. Orderly man has tied me up, and don't understand why."

"He did exactly as I asked." As the CMO spoke, the orderly stiffened up and took a shaky breath, almost like the praise was arousing. "And you got here in one piece! I think we're /all/ thankful for that." His grin became wider, and he approached the trembling Vox. Steti had no intention of going at this without a fight, however, and brought up one of his legs to kick at the short Grey. Before he could put his weight fully into it, something stopped him. Something in his head relaxed his muscles and pained his core, and he stopped short. The CMO hummed, squinting. "Helping me out with the inspection, are you? So compliant." He clasped at Steti's upturned leg as the bird squirmed a bit, struggling to vocalize or resist.

His pale purple eyes began to inspect Steti starting with his foot, holding and grasping at him with no seeming concern for his comfort. Occasionally he would retrieve a clipboard and begin writing, and though the bird would use this opportunity to object and beg for his hands to be unbound, neither the CMO or orderly had any concern. He felt his legs pulled apart and rubbed, he felt his arms measured and held nearly to the point of blood being cut off, and he felt his jumpsuit being zipped down completely, revealing a soft bulge in his suit. The CMO seemed to take especial interest in this, and pressed one hand against Steti's groin, groping as if feeling for faults.

"Why are doing any of this?!" he squawked, shifting uncomfortably.

"You're really curious, Stetikekiak?" the CMO asked, face snarling into a grin.

The bird nearly stomped the floor. "/Yes/!"

To this, the Grey took a step back and retrieved the clipboard once more, flipping a few dozen pages back to the front of the file. He began reading an excerpt with an enunciated tone. "...'The new arrival to the station is remarkably capable. Camera feeds donated graciously by the Head of Security have revealed an adept capability for salacious acts and sodomy via hands, legs, holes... though somewhat untrained, shows great potential as a tool. In fact, he seems to use his talents as a tool of his own, maintaining an internship in departments of Security, Science, Engineering, and so on...'" He took in a breath, looking back up with his gaze narrowing. "I've seen what you've done to the easily-manipulated of this station, and I admire it. I intend to learn more about what you're capable of."

Steti nearly melted in his chair. He was speechless, and felt simultaneously betrayed, scared, and powerless. He clasped his hands against the armrests of the chair for grip. It didn't help.

The CMO ran his gloved finger down Stetikekiak's solar plexus, made vulnerable by the unzipping of his jumpsuit, feeling delicately along until he'd reached the base of the bird's member, felt easily through the thin latex suit. He began to beckon it to form with a few slow jerks of his palm against its surface, seemingly expecting to simply have it bulge out against the rubber like usual, but then he seemed to spot the modification, and pulled the two flaps apart, suddenly unleashing Steti's dick... and with only a little more pulling, he'd fully revealed the bird's perineum and hole, nestled between two fantastic-as-always asscheeks. Steti simply chittered weakly in protest, but with each passing moment, something was making it harder and harder to struggle.

Something like a voice. A voice entering his thoughts intrusively and painfully, forcing arousal into him, forcing his softness to hardness.

Steti's dick was, like all Vox, tinted an odd blue, and it was now in full view, growing and growing and pressing up against his latex-covered belly. The CMO furiously began taking notes, grinning wider and humming. Then, once he'd satisfied himself with notes, growing more erect himself, he began to ruffle through a nearby cabinet. The orderly watched on rather eagerly as his superior retrieved a thin, slightly ridged implement with a handle for ease of use and a pointed rubber end, and failed to contain a smirk.

On the other hand, the bird was now growing incredibly uncomfortable. He clasped at the ground desperately with his talons and clenched the seat tighter, but nothing could get him out of the coming violation. He clenched his anus on instinct, but in doing so, bobbed his cock back and forth with unwilling arousal.

"Haven't done this yet, though, have you? I imagine you were thinking about it. Why else would you have made it so easy to enter?" The CMO stepped forward and lowered the dildo to sit just on the seat beside Steti's hole, thin tip hovering just an inch from its destination.

Steti squawked. "I didn't want like /this/!"

The Grey smiled politely. "That wasn't my question, though you've confirmed my suspicion that you want this, one way or another." His hand pushed forth, and the dildo pushed forth with it, entering the Vox with little warning and pushing apart his sensitive, puckered interior. He began to squirm and groan with a flood of strange sensations. "You should be thanking your doctor, not chiding him."

"D-Doctor?!" the bird shouted, trying to fight against his binds. "You're psycho, not a doctor!"

He felt the toy as it slipped further and further inside him, probing at his innards and starting to rub up near his prostate. He was having trouble holding any part of himself together now, and groaned gutturally, trying to muster the energy to scream... but something continued to stop him. Something continued to make it difficult. That voice etched at the back of his mind, and he felt himself grow more and more aroused, to the point of sputtering out beads of precum until he was thoroughly wetted without a single hand on his dick. Steti squirmed as the dildo nestled itself fully inside him, bottoming out and filling him with alien sensations of penetration. He frantically tried to stare forward through a foggy viewport in his helmet at the Grey doing this to him.

Happy, and intensely aroused from the sensation of having Stetikekiak under his thumb, the CMO's own member was now bulging out from underneath the skirt of his coat-- still /barely/ contained within his black panties, but leaking like a fountain nonetheless. He seemed intensely excited to speak his next piece, and his tone didn't falter one bit despite the shared horniness in the air. "As you are likely aware, Steti, Vox have internal testes... right about /here/." He stuck a hand forth and pressed harshly on a place on the bird's abdomen, depressing latex and quills to feel at his skin.

Immediately, the bird was surprised, letting out a completely involuntary moan of pleasure. Stetikekiak squinted and tried to keep any place in reality, but the thoughts coming from the CMO were now invading him-- invading and trying to take control. He felt the Grey in his mind, probing as he probed his ass.

"That's something we have in common, in fact." He tilted his head back over his shoulder and beckoned his orderly forth, and the shorter, muscly Grey responded immediately, hurrying over with some trouble in his walk. The CMO said, "Retrieve a vial for me."

"Yes." The orderly almost grinned at the opportunity, and began rifling through another cabinet.

Steti groaned as his hole struggled again to accommodate the thick dildo pressing it apart, but by the look in the CMO's eyes, things were about to get a lot worse. Though he could feel the thoughts clawing at his mind rapidfire, they hadn't quite taken control-- but something about being more filled with need seemed to make it easier for the Grey to worm his way in. With this knowledge settling over Stetikekiak, he began pleading weakly under his breath, but the CMO simply grinned wider, and leaned forth, pulling his throbbing, slightly ridged alien dick from its pantied prison. He was trembling in his stockings, but held fast. "Something we have in common, and thus something very useful... for establishing a link."

The orderly hurried back over with a somewhat wide vial in his hands, and the CMO motioned for it to be held in front of his leaky dick, which the orderly did happily. "Now, Stetikekiak," he began, sliding a gloved hand over the Vox's abdomen and his own belly, "do what you do best."

Steti's best talent turned out not to be his stamina, and as the Grey pressed down on their mutual soft spots, he felt orgasm come upon him instantly, his bluish dick throbbing with each pulsating pump of cum, splattering against his own chest and groin, even landing some against the base of his helmet. He groaned and chittered and squawked like a chicken as an immense weight was lifted off his shoulders, but through the foggy viewport he could see the crossdressing Grey CMO doing the same, head cocked back a little as he pumped line after line of seed into the vial for safekeeping. The voice was no longer scratching, it was holding, controlling, overbearing, digging in deep. As he stared in the CMO's eyes, he felt a sense of deep and powerful control above him. Control, and commands.

(Begin to get some rest, Steti. You've got a lot of things ahead of you.)

The Grey's knowing smirk sealed the deal. He collapsed back in the chair as consciousness began to drain from him, and as cum pooled from him. He could hear the voice of the CMO complimenting his orderly for retrieving Steti, and he could see the immense joy and satisfaction fill the orderly, like every ounce of ego relied on the CMO's approval-- and he watched the orderly grow a tent in his pants from the sheer sensation of praise. As the world began to go dark, he also heard the Chief scold his underling, slapping slightly at his erection and reminding him that his 'assigned day' was a week ago, and to clean up the mess.

Those were the last words Steti heard before descending into a deep, dreamless slumber.

...

When he awoke, the world had shifted. He was in a patient room, still, though not the same one, and the lights were brighter, the room more cleanly. He came to without his jumpsuit, but still wearing his 'stealth suit', cleaned to the point of smelling new. Steti's body was wracked with weakness and a smog in his head, and even as he began to stand up from the chair he'd found himself on, he could barely stand, stumbling to and fro until he was shakily upright. The Grey's words were still echoing in his mind, and something in his groin was agitating his covered dick unwillingly.

(You're awake. Good.)

He sluggishly swung around, trying to find the source of the voice. It was coming from nowhere.

(And aroused, I can see. The treatment is working! It was made custom for you, Stetikekiak, and I'm interested to see how it does.)

In two corners of the room, security cameras suddenly swiveled back and forth, making a mechanical sound Steti could hear. Once he'd spotted them, his heart fell to the floor. He was too far in it now to get out, and he couldn't will himself to fight.

(Please follow the orders of my orderly.)

The airlock slid open, and two entered. The Grey orderly was dragging along a confused human Botanist by the shoulder, who was wiry enough to look almost malnourished, and was babbling out mumbly questions as he was pushed forth into the exam room. The orderly's voice was firm as he faced Steti. "His yearly exam has come around. Inspect the patient." He stepped back and shut the airlock, and the bird was alone with someone who could help him!

The botanist shivered timidly. "...a-are you here to, um, remove my appendix, or something?"

Stetikekiak tried to mutter out a response... but it emerged only as a soft, guttural moan. The bulge in his suit grew bigger without him realizing it.

"You're a medical... intern... right?" He took an uncertain step back from the bird, staring at the ID on his rubber plastron.

"Intern," Steti squawked out weakly. With horniness filling him to the core, he started to shakily approach, then quickly approach, quicker than the human could back away, and he'd grappled him by the shoulders. He began to drool, lifting up the wiry Botanist and placing him roughly on the exam bed flat, clambering on top of him. His mind was filling with thoughts, images, /need/, and Steti couldn't help but start to fulfill them.

He nearly ripped open the human's jumpsuit trying to get inside, stripping only the bare necessities to reach his awkwardly semi-hard pinkish fear-boner as it bobbed with confusion. For a moment he humped forward his wide hips as he seated in a kneel over the human, pulling his own blue Vox dick free and frotting with a thirsty bravado, but as the human began to let out panicked breaths and ask for it to stop, Steti realized- somewhere in his addled mind- he'd need to do more to convince. He pulled the flaps around his groin further apart to uncover his previously-violated hole and sat on the Botanist's erection, taking in as much as he could, using his gloved claws to beckon it further in. The human melted into uncertain gasps as he entered Steti, first inch-by-inch, then sliding all the way up his tight hole and spewing out precum as he did so. The Vox massaged the tip against his prostate needily, gasping out in Pidgin, gyrating his hips back and forth and up and down.

It didn't take long for him to get in the rhythm of it, and his dick waggled with every lift up and down, leaking on the Botanist's belly. He rode like a champ, pushing himself up with his legs and arms to deeply penetrate and pull nearly all the way out, and he could see the human's wild, scared expression turning into weakness. Sweaty, panting, moaning weakness. Steti slid back down one last time, hole a wet mess which was caressing the Botanist, and as his prostate was hit again, he began to break out into a squawky, hazy orgasm, spewing birdseed across the patient's chest. He felt the Botanist doing the same to him, and a few massive spurts of cum began to fill his innards, hot as hell and making him almost squeak with discomfort. Ropes of white goo began drooling out of his hole, and his beak swiveled open in euphoria.

He didn't know why he was doing this. He only knew that he liked it, and the human seemed to like it, too. Mutually panting and shuddering in afterglow, they both tilted their heads in surprise when the airlock came open again. It was the orderly, sporting a bit of a tent in his trousers, sternly looking onwards at the bird. "Clean up this mess and get the room prepped for another inspection."

The botanist tried to lift a finger in protest before collapsing flat against the bed, defeated. Stetikekiak simply took a few long breaths, lifted himself off his limp dick, and began to follow his orders.

Time started to drift, and one moment lead into the next. The bird had the room cleaned and set up again before he had time to realize what he'd done, and he couldn't tell if an hour or ten had passed by the time the airlock slid open.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

A human Engineer who was jittering uncontrollably was brought in alongside what looked to be a small egg with remote switch, which Steti quickly figured out how to use. He was told to 'get his jitters out'. It took only a minute for him to have the egg vibrator attached to the Engineer's shuddery dick, and he told the human with a shuddery breath to work until he was rewarded. He clambered up onto his chest and began to facefuck the human with his engorged, ever-needy Vox cock, spewing precum and buzzing the vibrator for a second for each thrust, pumping and pumping until both him and the unwitting Engineer were forced to shaky, moany orgasm. Filling the human up face-first pleased Steti in more ways than one. He wiped up the human's cum from his tail and sent him on his way, satisfied, breathing heavily, anxious for another patient.

For some exams, the CMO would arrive again, sporting that incredibly revealing outfit, bringing the almost drunken Steti along for a tour of Medbay. He would be sent on the occasional task, much to the orderly's disdain, but by in large the bird was too out of his mind on need to get anything done. He'd get a compliment, a reward in the form of a grope, and be sent right back into his assigned patient room.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

A Vox trader who hadn't come fully willing, which the orderly said was due for a cavity search. The curvy and lithe figure of Steti quickly became no match for this trader, though, and he was heaved on the bed, stripped of hardsuit and jumpsuit until his quills waved in cold, open air. Stetikekiak began to dig his fingers into the trader's ass, fingering him invasively while hanging over him like a pounced predator. Soon enough he was too horny to just satisfy the impressed Vox trader, and clambered around, commanding him with a guttural voice to do a 'cavity search of his own'. The trader figured it out soon enough, beginning to cautiously prop his beak against his cheeks and insert his long tongue into Steti's puckered hole, while Steti returned the favor with two hands. Neither one lasted long as their prostates were mutually massaged and poked, and Steti did his best to clean up the cum-bath that resulted afterwards.

Maybe days had passed, by now, or maybe just hours. When left alone for too long, Steti would find himself just masturbating to keep the edge off. Often when he did, he'd spot the orderly just outside the room, watching in what looked like... disgust. But the CMO, with his cameras and mind control and occasional injection into Steti's arm, seemed fine with this needy, salacious act. He never allowed Steti room to think about it, though... never room to reconsider.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

This one recognized him-- it was the Officer from Security, the one with lewd undergarments. He'd come to do a shakedown of the place, but once the orderly was gone, he seemed almost happy to see Steti. He'd brought a frilly pink skirt, and took surprising control of the situation, managing to keep the bird from drooling long enough to have him wear the bit of crossdress. "You look good in it!" he announced, grinning. Steti continued to try and force himself on the Officer, but found little success as he was sat on the bed with his Vox dick poking up against the skirt and straddled by the stripped Officer, wearing his pink panties and gartered stockings once again, ruffling his hair a little as he mounted the horny bird. "I figured you could use a lesson or two on how to make this part work, since the HoS always came to me with complaints..." Sure enough, the Officer slid the entire blue member into his hole, facing Steti through his viewport, and rode him until both of them reached shaky, 'cute' climax, drooling cum onto one another. When he was finished, though, the Officer became hostile again, pushing the bird down and confiscating the cum-soaked frilly skirt, calling it 'contraband'.

While Security were in town, the CMO had Steti brought out for the more public inspection of the Head of Security done in the lobby. Something seemed to keep the human out of the patient rooms, but he recognized the stealth suit-clad bird immediately, staring in worry. "You got an... internship... HERE, squeaky?"

Steti just drooled a little, still out of it. He did his best to shift and keep his bulging erection out of view as the lithe Grey inspected the opposing Head of Staff. "Blood pressure, now. Stetikekiak, retrieve the pressure cuff."

"Ah, shit." The HoS grit his teeth as a drowsy bird put the strap on his arm, beginning to tighten it. The CMO grinned a sly little grin, and leaned in close as he set the cuff to inflate. Close enough to feel the stressed-out human's breath. "Christ, CMO... little close."

"I can get closer." The Grey grinned as he glanced at the readout on the machine. "Your blood pressure's quite high. Are you worried about something?"

To this, the human stiffened up, taking in a gruff breath. "Nothing."

The CMO leaned in closer. Though his tone was quiet, sharp and under his breath, Steti could just barely make it out. "If you don't tell Central all is well this quarter, like the other times, I'll have to do something drastic." His hand shot to the Head's groin for a tense grope, and the human shifted in simultaneous terror and discomfort.

"I... f-fucking hear you loud and clear." He stood up from the seat, taking in anxious breaths as he glanced between Stetikekiak and the Grey. "We done here, right?"

"Of course." The CMO smiled, beckoned for Steti to pull off the Velcro-tightened cuff, and began to lead him back to the patient room that was quickly becoming a familiar home. On his way, he couldn't help but shoot the exasperated Head of Security another look-- one that was altogether threatening and cocky.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

This time, though, it wasn't just one, but two patients, a couple of tired Vox miners who had suspected 'asteroid STDs' to be inspected. Once the orderly left the room, however, it became clear that word of Steti's presence in Medbay had spread, and the miners pulled their helmets off, nearly breathless from the sight of such a feminine, horny Vox. Before he could say a word he was pinned between the two in a spitroast, kneeling and supporting himself with shaky elbows as the bigger bird mounted him, thrusting between plump, latex-clad asscheeks. They squawked out taunts and exasperated shouts of glee in Pidgin, though Steti refused to have his helmet taken off for the blowjob. Instead, he began to give the one in front a tightly-held handjob, begging under his breath to get his viewport splattered, and within a couple minutes of sweaty, screechy bird orgy, Stetikekiak felt himself filled and covered as he blew his own load, dominated. He'd learned a thing or two from the Officer, and drained every last drop of birdseed from the pent-up miners.

He was rewarded for this lustful act once more. The CMO took him out, assuring him the birds had come back 'negative for anything', and held him by the shoulder enough to make him feel small. But Steti had gotten used to this dynamic, this feeling of being controlled, and it seemed to visibly satisfy the Grey whenever he obeyed commands. The only problem was the orderly, who was seething with anger and arousal from across every room, watching the CMO give the bird all his attention. Most of Medbay seemed to be under the crossdressed Grey's thumb, running like clockwork so long as it was running with his intentions in mind. Steti, lost in his mind-controlled haze, could do nothing but admire such spirit, as the hours or days dragged on and on.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

It was another Grey, one standing meekly with a nervous expression on... /his/ face. Like the CMO before him, this was another crossdresser, clothed in a frilly maid skirt and top as well as long thigh-high rainbow stockings. The orderly called in to tell Steti this was a maid to clean the room, but once the airlock shut, the bird felt himself getting confrontational, squawking bitterly at the bird, ensuring his place as the 'one who cleans rooms'. The Grey maid seemed to take this in stride, and as Stetikekiak bumbled up towards him to try and seem intimidating, he felt yet another layer of alien mind control droop over his vulnerable, horny body, and stumbled back against the bed, drooling in his helmet. The maid decided he'd give a lesson or two to the bird, and as he slipped off his black shoes and clambered on the bed in front, it became clear it would be about the washing of clothes. "Stockings are fun," the Grey said, sitting in front of Steti with his legs outstretched, two-toed feet beginning to /perfectly/ slot around Steti's engorged, leaky dick. "The trouble is getting all the cum out!~" Utterly outmatched, the bird craned his head back and began to moan pathetically. It only took a couple minutes for the Grey maid to make him beg for release, shuddery breath echoing from the helmet as he leaned and humped into the stockinged footjob. He let out a volcanic eruption of spooge, splattering carelessly across the Grey's rainbow stockings, much to the ayy's delight. He clapped his hands together and smiled with pride. "Now for cleanup, mhm?"

Steti began seeing a lot more faces he recognized, as time went on. More and more patients around Medbay would blush and turn away when they saw him, and though his distracted mind was having trouble putting two brain cells together, he felt a good bit of pride, even if he was rarely sure of what. The CMO would often come out to congratulate him, that reserved little grin ever-present, and the reward for his hard work was always more work. By now, he'd begun to completely forget his world before becoming an intern. The thoughts drifted away, and he wasn't conscious enough to mourn for them.

Some part of him was screeching to be let out, but it was muffled under the comforting, overbearing voice of the CMO, ever-lingering, ever-watching.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

He beckoned this human in as the Grey quietly explained he had phazon sickness, and that he needed a thorough diagnosis. Steti threw him onto the exam bed, climbing on top of him with an eager, leaky erection, pulling the human's jumpsuit off forcefully. He tried to cough out a protest, but once his undercarriage was revealed, there would be no stopping Stetikekiak. The human had two dicks, pulsating with unfamiliarity, which were surely a result of the phazon 'poisoning'. The bird began grinding against it, stealth suit squeaking slightly as he thrust his bluish Vox cock between two dicks spread like a V. He continued lowering himself down further as he humped, pre beginning to ooze from all three shafts, and then decided to make things extra warm-- laying on top of the squirming human so as to sandwich their frottage in-between his thick, latex-clad thighs. Old-fashioned. With his rubber-covered talons pressed up against the human's face threatening to claw rather than rub, he was thoroughly quieted, and Steti simply proceeded with the thighjob and rubbing, his dick leaking and shivering alongside two others, all caressing each other's warmth. Neither lasted long, and he squawked out happily as he watched all of their tips begin to boil and bubble up with cum, spilling out in a wild and satisfying orgasm. He'd gotten so good at this by now.

He'd gotten so good at this, and he sent out the human, who was now wearing a dumb grin, rubbing affectionately at his face where he'd been pressed on. Steti cleaned himself up with a lustful, breathy panting on his breath, and waited anxiously for another arrival.

But the break had to be his own to take, as minutes or hours or days passed without a patient. He stumbled out of the room, trying to keep his bearings as he went on over to Medbay's break room. Maybe he'd eaten recently, and maybe he hadn't, but he figured he could at least go and grab some water. Steti held onto the walls and unsteadily swiped his Intern ID at doors until, at last, he'd found himself in the oddly calm break room, where there was no rabble. The orderly was there, standing beside a table with a tea mug, eying Steti suspiciously as he came in, took a few steps forward, and fell lazily towards one of the vending machines, trying to squawk out the word 'water'.

"I don't understand why he gives you so much commendation."

The bird turned around slowly, fogging up his helmet with his anxious breaths. "...what?"

"Commendation!" The Grey stepped forward, teeth grit, his legs shaking with a quaking feeling of need. "It should be /me/ by his side. Not you. Not /you/."

"I am just... j-just intern," Steti stammered.

But the orderly seemed determined to antagonize. He stripped off his belt and pulled down his trousers, then his precum-stained briefs, revealing a dick throbbing so hard Steti thought it might be a bomb. "That's right. You follow /my/ orders. I'm in control, just like CMO. Clean this up!"

He began to bring his shaky hand to his Grey dick, bulging out with soft serration, and clasped his palm against it. A few quick jerks against himself, and the bird could already see him shaking with closeness. Five seconds in and he was on the edge, but right before sweet release... something stopped him. Something in his head. He limply dropped his hand back down and stared incredulously at his exposed dick, trying to get that last bit out hands-free, but only ended up looking like an idiot in front of Steti, who simply stared with confusion. In a few moments, the door to the break room slid open, and the CMO came in, clutching a sheet of paper and looking deeply displeased. He handed the sheet to the orderly, who took it with an unsteady hand. "This is a notice of misconduct in a public place." The CMO glanced between the orderly and Stetikekiak, then back at the needy Grey. "Your appointment has been pushed back another week for this. Don't test me."

And then, as quickly has he had arrived, the crossdressing CMO left again, leaving only the orderly and bird in stunned silence. After a few moments, the Grey begrudgingly pulled his undergarment and pants back up, falling into a chair and sitting with a tent pitched and his eyes gone wild. Steti asked meekly, "...are okay?"

He just let out a long, weakened breath. "Ever since you got here, I haven't been allowed to... finish. It's been a month now, and I can't take it anymore." The somewhat buff orderly rubbed at his forehead. "The other departments know that he's gotten kind of out of control recently, b-but... they're all too afraid to do anything about it! How do you try and give criticism to the guy who does your surgeries?"

"I... want to..." Steti could barely make out any of his own words. Something deep inside him wanted to offer sympathy, some kind of friendliness, some kind of help, but he could only suck in air and sway from side to side, mind hazy. The hopeless look on the orderly's face was terrible to look at, and so he stumbled right back out of the room, popping open the airlock and heading back to the private exam room he'd made his home. For... how long? How long had it been? He'd already forgotten. Maybe he'd already asked before. All he could think of now was his own needy erection, waiting to be freed. Waiting to be serviced. Drooling with anticipation.

Another patient delivered by the orderly.

It was... an Assistant. No, it was /his/ Assistant. The bald, well-built, and terribly friendly Assistant who had become such a distant memory. He at first seemed overjoyed to see Stetikekiak, but as he was sat on the bed and straddled furiously, he zoned out a little.

"Ya know, Steti, I just... don't know if I got a worker's bone in my body," he muttered, not particularly noticing the horny bird rubbing his latex-clad asscheeks on his lap. "I mean, definitely I've tried, but I always go back to Assistant. Been doin' it for years now." He glanced off to the side as Steti let out a moan, rubbing his bulging cock against the Assistant's chest. "Unlike you, right? You've moved up'n the world. Didn't know you were a medical intern 'n all that now, but it's cool." He glanced down, sighing as Steti began to rub his own dick, two-handed. "I could never do that." The Assistant nodded weakly and morosely, before snapping open his eyes, realizing something was off. "Hey, wait, Steti, why are you trying to fuck me right now?"

The bird just fogged up his helmet with panting and moaning, rubbing stupidly in heat. The human stared at him incredulously, and began to have a good guess as to what might be going on. He glaned back, then around the room, and spotted something not far from the bed, just barely within reach-- a box of tinfoil. He snatched it over, pulled free a wide sheet, folded it into a hat, and took a breath. Steti wouldn't like this, humping and spewing precum as he was, but it was for the best. The Assistant wrapped his hands around the bird's back, pulled free a small latch on his neck, and undid the helmet, suddenly tossing it onto the bed. All in one motion, he wrapped the tinfoil hat around Steti's head... and the world came hurtling back.

Stetikekiak was a Vox with bronze-colored feathers. He stared in surprise at the Assistant, and suddenly the Assistant could /see/ that surprise, on a meek, thin-looking avian head. He had what looked to be a wide, deep scar along his beak and the side of his head, which he tried to cover for a moment. Then he noticed his bulging erection, fueled by aphrodisiacs and mind control, and decided to at least try and make himself look modest. He pulled himself off the human, panting weakly as he put his dick back in his suit.

The first words he could mutter were, "What... was... all that happened?"

"Beats me," the Assistant said, sympathetically staring into the Vox's now-visible eyes, "but I could tell somethin' was wrong with ya."

Steti nodded shakily. "I think there is... mind control, in my head. Chief officer."

"Yeah. Damn, yeah. Guess so."

A few moments passed in silence. Stetikekiak crooned his head as a rush of memories began to return. Not just life before the internship, but also every out-of-control moment of it. He felt a mix of horrible surprise, betrayal... pride, again, some arousal, but largely just confusion. It was a /mess/. Too much to vocalize, save for the simple phrase he'd learned to use in many a circumstance. "This is weird."

The Assistant stood up, putting himself in front of Steti and offering a hand. "We gotta get back at this guy. He's kept ya locked up for a month now! What've you been doin', just fucking dudes that come for exams?"

"Think so," Steti stammered.

He glanced off. "Explains why all the other guys were tryin' to egg me on to get one." His face narrowed, and he spoke bitterly. "That's pretty messed up."

The bird nodded firmly, and stood up shakily to face the Assistant. "It is. It's... all of was very messed up. But I have idea."

Before heading out, they made sure to get the human his own tinfoil hat, and Steti took the helmet for the stealth suit with him, kept securely in a bag. The circumstances seemed to make putting it on a lower priority than staying sane, and he held the Assistant close to him as they hurried through Medbay, trying to find one Grey before the other. They found success in the break room-- an even more shaky and pent-up orderly sipping tea while he grinded weakly against a vending machine. He glanced back and nearly dropped the mug in surprise, eyes wide and expression deeply, deeply bitter. "/You/."

Steti's eyes filled with empathy. "I'm sorry to you. I wasn't able do anything either. You need help with CMO."

"I just can't get through to him," the orderly admitted, sighing. "I still blame you for that, but... I suppose you weren't acting on your own volition."

The Assistant stepped forward and handed the confused Grey a tinfoil hat. "Put this on, guy, we're aboutta stage a coup."

Frantically, they split up, searching individually for something they could use, some kind of advantage. The cameras swished from side to side, and Steti knew they'd only get one chance-- they'd be walking into a trap. He used his Intern ID to peruse medical records, pried open file cabinets in hope of finding a single scrap of information about the CMO, but it had all been stripped clean. His last hope was in the small library at the corner of Medbay, so dusty it was nearly smoke-filled, and he finally found something he thought he might be able to use. A thick biology textbook... specifically about Grey anatomy.

He rejoined the other two, who had found a similar lack of information, and they collectively took a breath. It was time.

The CMO's office door opened before they even arrived. Steti entered first, uncertain, clutching his hands together for some security. Not having a helmet was really getting to him, now, but he did his best to keep his cool. The Grey and Assistant entered behind him, and all three saw a snickering CMO swivel around in his chair from the array of security cams, seat turned up so that they could all make out his utterly soaked panties, barely containing a raging erection.

"I've been waiting for you to decide to make your move," he chuckled. "It's cute, really, thinking you're not completely under my thumb here." Steti took a few steps forward, but remained breathless. He knew he could get stuck with a syringe or knocked over at a moment's notice, as he was hardly physically capable. The CMO continued as Steti approached. "I'm thinking once I'm done putting you and my orderly back on track, I'll snatch that Assistant for my newest project to attach a Grey dick to every--"

Steti reached forward suddenly and clasped the CMO's chin. His chin, squishy and slightly pointed, fit perfectly between his three gloved fingers. The Grey suddenly erupted into an involuntary moan, precum spurting out like a fountain as he was overcome with sudden, painful lust. "I-Impossible!" he stammered weakly, beginning to choke a bit on his own words. "Y-You can't kn-know... m-my /expertise/, y-you..."

The Assistant rushed behind the chair to begin restraining his arms, and the orderly approached with a somber, yet vindicated, expression. Stetikekiak spoke with a confidence he'd never had before, head open to air and eyes burning with passion. He didn't stop massaging for a single moment. "Your chin is /erogenous/ zone. I know anatomy, too!"

"Hey, wait," the Assistant said, tilting his head slightly. "How the hell'd you know what 'erogenous' means?"

"I learned Common from..." Steti trailed off, glancing from side to side, before training his gaze back on the overworked, panting CMO. "I-Is not important. Important part is you're not only one who can be cocky over basic knowledge!"

The CMO squirmed, no longer able to vocalize a response. His purplish eyes slid open for him to spot the orderly, who was stripping back down his trousers, then his briefs, his dick dripping with precum it'd been spewing for weeks. "I'm sorry, CMO, but I'm doing this for your own good." The orderly took a few steps forward, leaning over the CMO as Steti made room. The crossdressing Grey had his legs spread open, and his arousal was filling the air whether he wanted it to or not. The orderly slid forward, feeling up his boss's garters and stockings, and pulled off his tinfoil hat. They both had a sense of professionalism about them elsewhere, but both Greys were a mess, and the orderly knew they'd only last a moment. He just wanted to make it a good one.

He slid his dick cautiously down between the CMO's skirt. It rubbed up tight against his bare thighs and then began to poke at his exposed asshole, just below the edge of his dick-slit, and with no confidence or previous experience, the desperate orderly just began to thrust forward. He found purchase on the second shuddery hump, pushing his pointed tip into the CMO's hole, sliding upward as they both mutually burst out into groans. Steti and the Assistant glanced at each other once more.

The Greys both finished at the precise same moment. The orderly, pent up over the longest he'd ever been, began to spew out like a leaky garden hose, filling the CMO within an instant and then spooling a lake onto the chair. The CMO had plenty of energy left in his dick, and yelped out as he came-- alien spooge pumping out in ropes through his black panties. The simultaneous orgasm forced a psychic link, forced the link to be reworked, and the orderly clasped his head desperately to ensure he could hold on through the chaos.

The next week went by pretty quickly.

Stetikekiak found himself with the Assistant, walking closer to one another than ever before. There was a level of trust the bird hadn't ever really felt, and though he always worried it'd be broken with people, this human seemed different. He'd slowly convinced Steti not to wear the stealth suit everywhere, and as he walked into Medbay with a rolled-up jumpsuit, long boots, and gloves, but no pressure suit... well, he was vulnerable, tail and arms and thigh-feathers visible, but he was happy to try it out sometimes. The bubble helm on his head was a compromise. Although he was still largely hidden from view, the Assistant could see the bird's eyes, his expressions, and make out the shape of his face. It also helped him know when he was making the bird blush. Of course, Steti's ass still bulged a bit through the tight grey jumpsuit, but there was only so much he could do about that.

They headed by Chemistry, bustling with three bickering Chemists, and ordered a glass of sulphuric acid, carrying it with them. They headed by the lobby, where a couple of exploded Xenoarchaeologists were putting themselves together with some kind of arcane technology while a doctor stared on in horror. They headed by the patient rooms, where it seemed like real doctors were doing real inspections of real patients, and finally they headed by the CMO's office, heading inside.

The orderly was sitting at the desk, his legs propped up on the surface, pants against his knees as he was sucked off by what looked like the CMO. Steti and the Assistant almost immediately began to leave, simulatenously getting the idea that it might be a bad time, but the orderly greeted them both with a friendly tone. "Oh, I was hoping you two would come by today. Come on in!"

"You sure you're all good?" the Assistant asked, biting his lip.

"Perfect." The orderly grinned his mild little grin and sat back, letting out a soft moan. "How have you been?"

Steti lit up a little. "We have relaxed. That's all wanted to do right now."

"Yeah," the human chuckled, "it ain't bad. Hey, we even got you some acid."

He stepped over and set the glass of sulphuric acid on the orderly's desk, who nodded in surprise. "Well, thank you!"
 
"How is Medbay doing?" asked Steti, almost a bit hesitant.

To this, the Grey nodded slowly, taking a deep breath, one hand gently clasping the CMO's head, pressing him further in, sighing with every movement. "As you might have seen, I've been making just a few changes. I still believe in my CMO, and I let him run just about everything, b-but..." He felt tongue around the base of his slit, and craned his head back, gleeful. "...I get to pick some of the people we take for exams, and I get as much time with my boss as I want." Steti and the Assistant glanced at each other again as the orderly moaned, grunted, and then whispered, "...I'm close," to the CMO.

Just as it seemed he was going to boil up into orgasm, the crossdressing Grey suddenly pulled off of his dick, licking his lips and standing up, panting a bit, his grin mischevious. Both him and the orderly seemed happy out of their minds, but the orderly was still clearly leaky and needy, dick pressed up against his briefs as he slipped them back on. Then, in sync, they swapped places, with the CMO propping his own legs on the desk, legs splayed and stockings forming a runway to his engorged dick, which the orderly began to service.

Steti spoke up with sudden fury. "You aren't allowing to finish! Why?!"

The CMO let out a sharp breath as he began leaking pre into his subordinate's loving mouth. "The problem was never the denial, Stetikekiak. When you came by, I simply spent so much time with you, making sure you were as good at your job as you could be... it was inevitable that he would get jealous. That was my very own fault." He curled his toes within their socks, smiling brightly. "All he ever needed was my attention, which I'm now very happy to give. After all, he /loves/ being on edge."

To this, the orderly moaned deeply and gutturally, taking in dick inch-by-inch in approval. He massaged his dick with one hand through his briefs, keeping himself just on the edge, soaking his underwear with want.

After a moment of quiet, with the bird and human worried, the CMO spoke up once more, his tone more decisive. "I'm very sorry for keeping you here and controlling you, Steti." He humped desperately into the orderly's maw, but otherwise kept his conduct. "If you ever wish to come by, let it be on your own volition."

Stetikekiak grasped the Assistant's arm suddenly for support, for closeness. "Did learn few things along the way," he squawked. "Just would have preferred learn things not while being drugged and not able to control body at all."

Before the crossdressing CMO could properly agree, he felt himself start to moan out loudly, 'inspected' by his orderly to the point of orgasm. A few long, satisfying pumps, and he'd given his subordinate a healthy helping of seed to suck down, which he did happily, nearly choking on the load. By the time he was steady enough to stand, he was wearing a beam like a lottery winner, dick rubbing up against his briefs and then trousers as he pulled himself together. It really did seem better for him to be on the edge, and more empowering, as he took his hand, setting it softly on the bigger Grey's shoulder and tightening it slightly.

The CMO took a moment to recover, let out a breath, and then leaned back in the chair, similarly amused. "If it is any consolation, we learned some things about one another, too."

"Our relationship has matured," the orderly said. He reached over the CMO's shoulder, clasped the glass of acid, and took a good, long drink, revitalizing himself for the coming hectic day.

They seemed like the strangest peas in a pod that either Stetikekiak or the Assistant had ever met. They spent only a moment longer saying their goodbyes and then hurried out, walking back through Medbay the way they came, uncertain on the whole thing. As they reached the outer lobby, though, the Assistant felt a need for comfort again... and reached over to the bird beside him, clasping his hand tightly, feeling three gloved fingers in his grasp.

Steti glanced over and stopped walking, facing the Assistant, beak hung open a bit.

"Ya know," the Assistant stammered, trying to hold steady by holding Steti, "I kinda feel like /our/ relationship has matured, too."

The bird lit up brightly, and tightened his grasp on the human's hand. "...Don't push luck," he chuckled. The Assistant blushed a deep crimson, taking a breath so uncertain that Steti couldn't help but try and reassure it.

He turned to face the human, gaze sure, and asked, "Do you want to get pies at kitchen together?"
