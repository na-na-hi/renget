Extra: Amortentia

Anon was elated! He finally managed to do it! Despite mockery from other students and warnings from Professor Sharp; he finally managed to brew Amortentia!

"Now to find a test subject..." Anon whispered, calmly. It was a Hogsmeade weekend, the Great Hall would be empty but he was wary of being caught by a painting or a ghost with a flask of Amortentia; Professor Weasley had already warned him multiple times for his disturbing behavior with Zenobia Noke.
As he wandered the hallways he suddenly realized now would be the best time to hunt for some introverts.
"Those only come out when the school is empty!" he said out loud, as he started running towards the Greenhouse. The sun was shining through the glass ceiling and the plants were blossoming beautifully, the classrooms were completely empty save for a few potted plants.
Having found no one anywhere, Anon finally made his way under the tree at the end of the Greenhouse; that's where he found her, the new fifth year, he slithered slytherinly towards her.

Her robes neatly folded on her bag, she was moving strangely and her short white hair slowly moved with her head. When Anon approached she opened her pale green eyes and greeted him.
"H-hello, were you looking for me? How can I help you?", she said, her eyes wandering everywhere but not once locking into his gaze.
"Oh! H-hey! You must be the new fifth year, Minim- I mean, Marmalade, right?", blurted the young man, unsure how to deal with such a strange girl. "I managed to brew a really advanced potion and I was looking for someone to try it out on."
"Sure. I can do that. My name is Margaret, by the way", Anon was taken aback as she accepted his request even after being misnamed and called food.
"Alright, first, I need you to tell me what the potion smells like.", he said, a grin barely showing on his face as he plugged his nose and uncapped the flask.

Margaret suddenly gagged "Oh no! I failed! I messed up! I knew this potion was too advanced for me! I'm in trouble now...", he thought, but through the gagging and squinting, the pale girl started describing the smell.
"It's...like...your grandpa's worn out sock..." she retched, "worn...for years, in the same dirty boots...", she gagged, "B-but then...you wiped it...on the inside of a toilet bowl", she retched again.
Anon quickly hid the potion, looking crestfallen, but she suddenly grabbed his hand shakily but firmly "You were trying to brew Amortentia, right? I thought everyone knew Love Potions don't work on me." she said, looking at the now capped pungent potion.
"Wait, are you telling me it works, just not on you?", he was shocked, what an unexpected twist!
"Yes, I don't really know why but Amortentia smells horrible and makes me sick, I usually charge the girls one Galleon for a taste test, whenever they get suspicious of their butterbeer.", she said, as she was putting on her robes back on. "Were you trying to make me drink that? What are you, a poacher? Looking for a rare prey?", she said, as she turned around.
"N-no, I would never!", he started panicking, fumbling for his wand.
"I'm not going to hurt you, just go away and don't try to make girls drink your weird potions, you managed to brew it, you should be proud.", she said, amused by his buffoonery.
Anon ran away, both relieved and excited "That was WEIRD! ...Hmm, now where's Sophronia..."

Later that day, Anon was caught by Professor Weasley and got two weeks making sandwiches in the kitchen as punishment for trying to roofie Grace Pinch-Smedley.
