# Size

This is an attempt to build a comprehensive catalogue of size difference media. For now I will omit written works, hentai, short videos, videogames, and individual images until I figure out how to handle the technical aspects of organizing & displaying them.

 * Entries in the "TODO" subsections are pending categorisation - you can help by including cover pics, descriptions, tags, and relevant chapters/episodes when suggesting additions.
 * Entries in the "minor" subsections involve very limited size content - think [vggts](https://www.vggts.gdn/) and [acgts](https://www.acgts.gdn/).
 * Entries in the "shit" subsections are either low effort or non-substantial and only included for completeness.
 * Entries in the "lost" subsections have completely disappeared from the internet and may not be relevant.

-> **Please enjoy!** <-
