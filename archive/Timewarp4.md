>it's been a couple weeks since you and your co-pilot, engineer, partner-in-occasionally-morally-dubious-but-always-entirely-within-the-law-business-ventures, "bearboibf" Dreughbachus decided to commit to a substantially more romantic form of relationship following the realization that you're both just about perfectly suited to supporting the other emotionally
>you've been sleeping in the same bed
>which isn't something his people, the Br, do very often
>it was just a little awkward at first, having about half the space you're used to
>drew's kind of clingy, which you've developed an appreciation for
>you never experienced this kind of closeness on earth
>the nearest thing you can relate it to is the feeling of a pet trusting and depending on you
>but that's not really all that similar when you really think about it
>for one thing, the feelings that drew conjures in you are completely new to you
>you'd always heard the expression 'to make one's heart flutter,' it didn't make much sense to you
>unusually for you, you don't even know where to start in describing it any other way
>it's probably his nice, short black fur and the contact you freely share that makes the comparison so easy to make

>you've engaged in plenty of "experimentation in each other's preferred sensuality space" as drew put it 
>and immediately joked at his own expense 
>"I already said I'm not gonna be the one to write that paper"
>some of that experimentation didn't press the right buttons for one or both of you
>drew's not a fan of anything that even approaches 'rough'
>well, he definitely liked most of it while you were doing it
>as soon as he realizes he's going to be even the least bit sore from it
>instant regret
>it seems like he has a lot of earth fantasies he's built up over his time
>they're all a little... high energy
>he's hit you with scenarios from places and times you're pretty sure no written records exist on earth
>like that one where you're supposed to be some fertility god and he's an actual, no foolin' bear
>that you're supposed to be forcing the divine spark into in order to create some mythical figure who taught humans how to fish or something
>it's hard to RP when he knows more about the Linear Banded Ware culture's beliefs and deities than you'd ever had the opportunity to know
>you'd been trying not to make a big deal about drew's ursine countenance, first on the assumption that he wouldn't know what you were talking about
>then coming to the conclusion that it must be insulting, as he hadn't mentioned it himself
>maybe it is, and you didn't pick up on it 

>your own 'areas of research' as it were
>were much less complicated
>you tried to see how long it takes for you to get tired of kissing drew
>longer than it takes for you to cum just from the emotions and the sense of eroticism
>it's a strange and exquisite feeling
>but you can't say you like it quite as much as direct stimulation
>it happens that Br have a habit of 'grooming' the people they care about
>for drew it does nothing arousing, being a matter of normal social behavior
>for you it's a lewd and intimate experience which provokes fuzzy feelings and tests your ability to restrain uncharacteristic moans and gasps
>grooming in this case meaning 'licking of your neck and chest in an erotic fashion'
>and occasionally gentle biting as he focuses in on one spot for some reason or another
>it's not exactly a mutual favorite
>sometimes drew catches himself as he's about to start doing it out of habit
>it must be awkward or embarrassing for him to see you enjoy it so much

>right now, you're having a nice conversation with drew over breakfast
>which for you consists, as it usually has, of beuumwerma
>a delicacy of drew's home planet Magraaf
>partially because they're easier to punch in to the food replicator than most earth food you tried
>but mostly because they're real fuckin' good
>if you don't think too much about what they are
>hell, even if you do
>if Crick-ettes tasted half as good as thunder grubs they wouldn't be relegated to novelty stores, gift shops and 'glasswares distributors'
>you've reached the topic of idiosyncrasies in your earliest days piloting
>"I'm still a little nervous you'll run up to the controls in some cold sweat of compulsion to send a bunch of 'translate perpendicular, roll 1080' commands" drew jokes
>they gave you a barrel roll button, of course you're going to use it.
>technically it's an aileron roll
>you can't do that in The Scar anyway
>you'd end up smeared across 60 some lightyears
>"that's why I'm nervous, it's like some latent need in you"
>"you were hammering on the emergency macros like you were trying to weave through a gas giant's rings"
>"I was pretty sure that huge freighter couldn't handle so many"

>If they're for emergencies only
>why are they right under your index fingers?
>"they're not supposed to be, you hold the yoke like some kind of unhinged maniac"
>"I don't know how you fly like that, using your thumbs for everything"
>It's not your fault that the galactic standard for controlling spacefaring vessels is essentially an Xbox Duke Controller
>or that every function is mapped in such a way that no matter the size of craft, it feels like you're playing the world's most lenient and intuitive arcade style 3D shmup
>"I'm going to assume from the word playing, that you somehow have the computing power to simulate travel like this, before you even understand how it works?"
>"and that you use that for entertainment?"
>we're not even simulating it
>it's just a bunch of games made by, probably hundreds of people who have nothing to do with each other
>you're just as stumped as drew as to how it is that a bunch of iterative guesses at what's fun happened to coincide with how actual spaceships work
>especially considering how complicated the NASA ones are
>"you've put vessels into orbit?"
>we've sent them to our moon and most of the other planets it's feasible to
>and flown by or orbited the rest
>why?

>"there's no way we could have missed that, we'd have detected the gravity manipulations"
>"I guess you could use massive impractical jets of plasma to propel tiny, barely sufficient masses into orbit" 
>"then wait years on end to exploit a couple gravity wells just to get from one place to another"
>"but that's ridiculous, you wouldn't happen to know how you actually do it, would you?"
>uh, that sounds about right, drew
>"what does? that it's absurd? I tried harder than I needed to, to come up with that, I'm kind of proud, actually"
>apparently the truth is just as strange as fiction
>you weren't expecting that truism to apply to earth any time soon
>"by graaf, you actually pull that nonsense off?"
>"I think you've just pointed out a huge fucking hole in our contact doctrine, and proven humanity to be the mockery of all good sense we've long suspected it to be"
>"we- I mean you- are going to have a lot of work to do once we're clear of The Scar"
>you're not a rocket scientist, physicist, or engineer 
>you're not going to be able to explain it to The Padishah-Emperor Corrino or The Academy or whoever runs the Federation
>also, it's definitely 'we'
>you're not leaving drew out of anything anywhere near that important
>"no, you're going to have to help the Federation figure out exactly how it makes up for missing first contact for so long"
>"and how it does that with a planet that has way too many governments at each other's throats"
>he's right, that's definitely a 'you'
>you can't exactly be the most effective middle man for disclosure by starting off with
>hey everybody, not only am I in a relationship with an alien one day after vanishing without a trace
>it's a GAY relationship with a man who looks like an animal
