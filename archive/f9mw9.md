For the anon who wanted winter date story (sorry for repost since thread closed didn't realize it was gonna take so long)

You slept in for to long on a cold winters day,your phone was buzzing for a long time.Picking up the phone you see many weird gifs that are like where are you and etc."Oh shoot I forgot my date with mysta was today "....so you text him back and say,"sorry!!! I forgot we were going out today my mad"."Mysta sent a message back saying hurry up I've been standing out here for awhile ".You start to get dressed putting on tights and a sweater dress and some comfy boots."Let me put my coat on and get my keys" you put it on then open the door.Mysta is sporting a new look you never seen before his face was a bit red from being in the cold to long he had very noticeable new item around his neck You yourself have forgotten the item which is a scarf."Mysta I'm so sorry I'm late and I guess it's colder than I thought today ".Mysta scratches the back of his head "its fine I was looking at my phone for a bit while you were still inside ".You let out a sigh of relief knowing that it was ok.."Mysta whats with the new getup and the bright red scarf?"I just wanted to have a change of pace ok do you not like it?You wave your hands in the air trying to reassure him you think he looks great."No,I like what you're wearing today".Mysta says "thanks I guess" you smile at him for a little. We should get going mysta this new Cafe I heard about has some yummy hot chocolate.Mystas eyes brighten for a second hearing that but he says "sure let's go" You both start walking together to the Cafe but your hands and neck feel a bit cold even with your coat on Mysta notices"Hey,if your still cold you can wear my scarf you look up at him feeling bad because he'll be cold as well "oh no I couldn't you need it more"Mysta takes off his scarf and wraps it around you.."its fine I have an undershirt that will keep me warm and you won't get sick".You nod and feel the warm fabric engulf you..."wow this smells really nice "a thought you keep in your mind as you are walking to the Cafe. I'm so glad we are going out today.
