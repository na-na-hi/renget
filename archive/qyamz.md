*NothingPersonnel*: doubt theyd show up if they knew you are tagging along

*iniGOAT:* no worries

*iniGOAT:* the consequences of my past blunders will be eclipsed by your charisma

*ReapRIP*: So you are saying that their attraction for them will trump their dislike for you?

*NothingPersonnel*: a group date sounds fun

*NothingPersonnel*: if youre up to it of course @*SunlightManliest*

*SunlightManliest*: I guess it could work

*SunlightManliest*: could make things less awkward if theres more people to talk to

*iniGOAT:* GROUP DATE HELL YEAH

*iniGOAT:* ALRIGHT GUYS LETS ALL BRING OUR GIRLS FOR A SHOPPING DATE

*ReapRIP*: I see

*NothingPersonnel*: a shopping date sounds kind of hard given our general budget

*iniGOAT:* we shoud focus the buying part on the camping stuff 

*iniGOAT:* but still try to go to a cafe or something

*NothingPersonnel*: hey how about that place you and sandy went to that time with mitsurugi and Imai

*SunlightManliest*: my guy you can't just invite two girls to a date at the same time

*ReapRIP*: Don't worry I've informed each that I'd also bring the other

*NothingPersonnel*: oh god my sides are in orbit

*SunlightManliest*: this feels unreal
