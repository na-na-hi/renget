To be 17 again. Ch. 3.

And so, Anon was set up to work with other talents. 

Your success with Mio caught the attention of the higher ups, thus you were given tougher cases; talents dealing with depression, others being plain lazy but earning so much cover couldn’t complain and others which were absolutely insane. To Cover, they had to be put in line to keep a certain level of professionalism and most importantly, to avoid yabs. The talents, to say the least, were rather complicated to deal with. Some were loud, some were indifferent, and some others got too touchy, which always made you uncomfortable that Mio would see and get the wrong idea. 

With the passing days, you two saw each other less and less, keeping your distance in the office and only greeting when passing by.

Mio had her troubles seeing some of the more extroverted girls freely talk to you, but she did her best so it didn’t show. 
~*~

“Did something bad happen with him?” Asked Fubuki washing her hands, worried about her friend.

“Oh, no, nothing.” Replied Mio as she dried hers.  

Fubuki was interested, Mio’s nervous smile made her understand. 

Once the day was over, you would wait for Mio near a corner and she would show up a bit later, greeting you gracefully. Her pretty mannerisms under the streetlight made her look surreal. Then, you’d extend your arm and Mio would join you as you two walked to the station. Sometimes making small talk about work, sometimes in complete silence. Every time you and Mio parted ways in the station, you’d give each other a heartfelt, warm kiss. Not as intense as the first one, but just as welcome. Mio would wave you goodbye in silence and you would do the same.

You could easily remember every single kiss you had with Mio, the texture of her warm lips, her hands shyly resting on your body and her soft figure wrapped around your arms. The smell of Mio’s hair became one your favorites, and only helped fuel some intimate fantasies that would follow in your bedroom. 

Cumming onto some toilet paper and cleaning your cock, you threw it in the garbage can and let your eyes drift off to sleep. You wondered if Mio would be satisfied with you. You knew she liked you, but you worried that she might find you lacking later, specially in bed. You didn’t think you’d get that far, but if you did, what would you do? All you had for experience was…

Still, you tried to keep your head up. You missed working with her and the spirit she had, always so gentle and motherly, decorated with delicate gestures and a friendly, genuine respect, specially compared to some of your new talents. Mio was a mature woman through and through, one that had pierced your heart. The comparison between her and the younger girls was day and night, black and white. Your first impression of them was their carefully molded bodies, realizing soon enough that it was their only selling point. Working with them made you wonder how they could be considered adults.

~*~

Mio waited for her husband in bed, reading a new book she bought recently. “Piano and blues.” A collection of short stories by C.S.S, most of them erotica, involving age gaps in between. Lone mothers, unhappy housewives, office ladies and even university teachers, who held relationships with younger men, usually, the son of a friend, new interns, students, and more. Mio began reading a lot of erotica on her free time, swapping a few names and scenarios here and there for her leisure. These were the moments of intimacy she had, and they gave her more pleasure than anything else could. When the characters in the stories began kissing, she did her best to remember the kisses you two exchanged with meticulous detail. Every sound, each nerve on her wet tongue as she tried to reach for yours, a little string of saliva that would connect you both or run down her cheek, the placement of each other’s hands, all of these little things came back to life when Mio read them in the book. Once the characters got more intimate, her fun came to a sudden halt, memory over imagination being the reason.

Her husband entered the bedroom, he began undressing and got in bed. Mio hid her book under the bed once more and she turned to her side to sleep. Suddenly she felt a hand on her hip, gripping it with no delicacy. The hand slid over trying to reach her womanhood, but Mio grabbed it by the wrist. 

“Not today, I have a terrible headache.”

All she heard was a displeased grunt and her husband turned over mumbling something to himself. Soon enough he fell asleep.

More than anything, she was caught by surprise. Her husband stopped touching her almost a month ago. She figured his girlfriend didn’t yield today, and she wouldn’t give it to him either. Not because she didn’t want to, inside, Mio was about to burst like a pressure valve, wishing to be taken and ravaged like an animal. But not by him. Not only because she despised him, but because she felt she would be cheating on you.

He had his affair, and she had her lovebird. 

Once the morning came, Mio’s husband had already left. She didn’t have anything to do in the office or stream, so she had the day completely to herself. Mio got up and looked at herself in the mirror. She lifted her shirt up and saw her waist and stomach. The sight depressed her. The once firm and well-toned body she had made way for plumper underside and a belly with a bit of chub that would poke out visibly if she didn’t take care of her diet, her love handles too, became a bit too big to not notice. 

“What would Anon think of my…” As she played with her thoughts a bit, she remembered some of the talents you had to work with, Shion, Matsuri and even Ayame to an extent. Thinking of them, getting all friendly with you made her sick, but she couldn't stop her own emotional sodomy. She saw Matsuri’s perfect body standing in the beach, nude with her distinctive tan lines, suddenly her figure was obscured by someone’s shadow and her face was caressed by a gentle hand, yours. 

Mio snapped herself back to reality before she would depress herself over the amalgamations of her mind. But one thing wouldn’t stop bothering her, and it was that her husband only tried to have sex with her when someone else wouldn’t, so, what if you didn’t want her that way either? What if your friendship was reduced to mere formalisms because one of the other girls wrapped you around her finger? 

Mio sighed and began making herself some breakfast.

~*~

The workload today was heavy. Matsuri, in your eyes, was a special kind of dumbass. She willingly put herself into situations that would result in misinterpretations or yabs. You tried everything with her, but everything you said seemed to come in from one side and come out the other. She too, was a bit too touchy, she’d grab your shoulders, she’d hold onto your arm and get too close for comfort right up in your face. She enjoyed the kind of person she was, and you couldn’t change that despite Cover’s insistence. You had to sit the brat down and scold her, yet to not avail, Matsuri just giggled to herself and made some snarky remarks. Her very voice was beginning to annoy you. 

Her chat too, was one of the most repugnant to monitor. All of these people were on par with Matsuri, appealing to them is what gave her the superchats.

You were tired and came back to cold apartment that desperately needed some cleaning, but you couldn’t find the strength to do so. 

For a while Mio hadn’t brought as many of her lunches to you because once you started working with other talents, cover insisted you had your lunch with them, they thought it was a nice bond between managed and talent, thus, Mio giving you your bento and then cowering back to her seat would’ve arouse suspicion. Still she tried to sneak them by, leaving them in your office hidden only where you would find them, but eating without Mio was empty. The food was great, cooked to perfection like every time, but it was missing *her*. Even when she was in the office you didn’t get to spend as much time with her, your only solace being your little secret spot you met after the day. Over the course of the month Mio began having less practices and with that, less reasons to come to the office, so you often found yourself alone in the street, sometimes hanging around the spot you two met at, thinking maybe she’d show up, only to remember she didn’t come to the office that day.

This week, you didn’t see her at all other than her streams.

You sat before your plate of rice and sausages, with a bit of mayo to taste. You couldn’t bring yourself to finish it, so you stood up waiting for your stomach to make room. Looking out your apartment’s window, you saw the other apartments mixed with the streetlights. Your heating was malfunctioning and the cold night began making its move on your body. You threw your half eaten plate into the trash and brought out the thick sheets and got in bed, slowly waiting for it to warm, shivering under the frigid blankets. Every day, you’d come to this very same bed, but it felt different. It felt empty, and way colder than before. 

Mio. Ookami Mio. Your brain made her name present in your mind.

So close, yet so far, every time you saw her it felt as if you were a mere spectator. Her husband, what kind of man was he? You thought to yourself, he must’ve had something for Mio to fall for him, so what was it? What did you need? 

Whatever it was, Mio was a married woman. The kisses she gave you meant nothing as long as her name was written on a paper next to her husband’s. To her you were probably a little cherry boy she got chummy with, a dumb young man like the people you worked with. Maybe you were falling too deep for a woman who saw you as nothing more than a little fun for herself.

Staring into the darkness of your room, you realized what you wanted. You felt a newfound courage that ruined your sleep and gave you all the energy you needed to pull through with your plan, so you got up, grabbed a notebook, and began writing down your ideas until well into the morning. 

~*~

“A-A ramen place?” Mio asked.

“Yes” You replied. “It’s a little detour from our usual walk, but I think it’s worth it, I checked it out one time I went back by myself.” 

Mio blushed. You felt a knot forming in your throat.

“O-Of course, unless you think you might lose you tra-“

“Let’s go Anon!” Mio cut you off with excitement.

Mio beamed with a happy smile. You sighed in relief. She grabbed onto your arm and rested her head on your shoulder. Then, you two began walking under the moon’s veil. 

~*~
It was a quiet place, in a quiet night. The only sounds that could be heard were the ones coming from the kitchen and some buzzing coming from an old LED light that lit up the place. Not another soul was in the building, other than you two and the chef. The place had a homely aesthetic, mixed with wooden chairs and tables. 

Mio finished her bowl with delight, letting out a satisfied puff, and so did you. For a while she sat without saying anything, looking at you with a confused stare.

“Did you have…” Mio stopped talking and began restructuring what she wanted to say, but nothing would come out, so you decided to help her.

“Something in your mind, Mio?”

“I-It’s nothing important.”

“But is it something you wanna tell me?”

Mio looked inside herself and gathered some courage. She couldn’t look at you in the eyes.

“Why did you go over the trouble of bringing me here?”

Mio’s question didn’t bother you, so you replied in full honesty.

“I just wanted to eat with you. Just us.” 

Mio felt flattered, she toyed with her chopsticks for a bit, before asking more questions. 

“How’s work with the others?” Mio was examining your tone and face, looking for any signs that confirmed her suspicions.

“Like shit.” You replied without missing a beat. Mio was surprised at your language, you would never swear when you were with her, but she realized you were too tired to sweeten your words. She appreciated the honesty. 

You rambled on for a bit about your worst case yet, Matsuri. At least other talents tried to pretend they put in some effort, Matsuri didn’t. You avoided the touchier subjects such as her getting too friendly with you, but vocally expressed your displeasure. 

One you finished, you sighed, and Mio rubbed your back. This made you break inside. 

“I really miss working with you Mio.” You said, suddenly your face reddening and your leg jumping up and down. This is it. No turning back, you thought.

Mio also blushed, but still couldn’t shake off her insecurities. Maybe you didn’t have your way with Matsuri, so you turned to her. She still saw her husband in other men. 

“I miss working with you too, Anon.” She spoke. “Maybe I should underperform again so they’ll assign you back to me!” She half-joked.

“That’s not necessary.”

A brief silence ensued. You needed to get something off your chest. How were you so collected and calm until now, you didn’t know, but you couldn’t find any of that resolve inside you anymore. The light’s buzzing was getting louder and louder. The chef was nowhere to be seen, so you turned off your reasoning, and let your heart speak.

“Mio.” You looked at her.

“Yes?” She waited calmly. Her beautiful figure was a piece of eye candy. Mio held a smile that made your heart race, yet that calmed it even more. You could get lost for a thousand years in her eyes and it wouldn’t be enough. You were entering winter, and yet when you looked at her, you saw an everlasting spring. The poets talking about love, about the flowers, the songs about loving someone so deeply, the tragedies that ruined people’s lives over their hearts, it all made sense to you now, looking at Mio’s kind, gentle amber eyes.

You inhaled your courage, and after a deep sigh, you finally spilled your heart out.

“Mio, I know you’re married.” A slight pause ensued, you swallowed your saliva and got ready for the rest.

Mio shivered, thinking you were about to call her a whore, for a second, she felt the weight of her sin on her shoulders, she felt that she abused your trust with her needs and that you were going to chew her out about it, she wanted to disappear and never be seen again. She waited for the same kind of verbal abuse she’d get from her husband, but something else escaped your mouth.

“But I must tell you this regardless. I love you.”

Mio’s heart almost stopped for a second. Her fears ran and hid as something shinned inside of her, something that made her eyes water without a single tear of grief, her mouth gaping in awe as she listened to you.

“I love you, Mio.” You repeated yourself. “I know it’s been only a few months, but I don’t think it matters anymore. I hate this job. I can’t stand these childish women.” You were getting off track, so you retraced your steps. “I’ve loved every single meal you’ve made for me, I love your personality, I love those sweet kisses you give me. I know I’m probably just a kid to you, or even just a little adventure, but I love you.”

Mio was getting more agitated at every word you said, she felt she was about to pounce on you and strip you right there on the ramen shop, but one little thing sent her over the edge, one little thing that would forever change the course of her life.  

“I haven’t looked at a single girl in the same way ever since I met you. I can’t betray my feelings for you, not even in my thoughts.”

For a second all Mio heard was the loud breathing coming from her nose, her stare going blank before coming back to reality. You looked at your empty bowl of ramen, a weight finally lifted from your shoulders. You were ready for any kind of answer from Mio, from being tenderly rejected to laughing at you, but not for the answer she gave you.

Suddenly Mio’s arms were wrapped around your neck, you felt yourself at the station, ready to part ways with her after a gentle kiss, but it was missing the bright lights, the sounds of the people hurrying to their homes, the beeping machines, and the sound of coins at the booths. All you heard was the buzzing of a LED light, and suddenly, as you turned to face Mio, she lost herself in your lips. You were surprised yet invigorated by her. Mio put all her effort into her lips, biting yours gently, fiercely looking for your tongue with hers, which you gave her without a second thought. You exchanged feelings and saliva through your mouths, Mio greedily sucked your tongue, afraid that she’d lose it forever if she let go. Her hands ran under your hoodies neck, her nails digging into your back with a pleasurable pain for you. Your own hands felt lost as what to do, so you just grabbed Mio’s hips and held her gently. Mio stopped to catch her breath, slowly separating from you, and in her eyes, you saw something different. A stare that gleamed with a needy shine. She needed you as much as you needed her. Your body began burning up, you hand unconsciously reaching for something else, running up her waist, right under her breasts…

A small giggle broke your trance, and your blood ran cold.

The chef was staring with great interest at the two lovebirds, before disappearing into the kitchen once more when he saw himself caught. Both of you looked at each other with embarrassment, Mio began laughing onto her sleeve trying to play it off. You called the chef back and asked for the check.

As you two left the establishment, Mio looked at your embarrassed face.

“I never want this night to end.” She thought to herself, holding onto your arm.

“I think it’s about time we go home. It’s pretty late.” You said.

“Yes, let’s go.” Mio’s eyes has a special shine which you didn’t notice. You couldn’t look at her after the incident with the chef, but she had already made up her mind regardless. She *wanted **you** *. 

Mio and you left the place holding hands and reached for the train station without saying a word. Once in company of the usual cacophony of the machines and the footsteps of people, Mio buried herself in your neck, inhaling the same scent she used like an aphrodisiac a while ago while locking her hands around you. Mio’s hair on your cheek felt soft and comfortable, you rubbed your head on hers while your hands gently caressed her back. You stayed in that position for a good while. Neither wanted to go home, home was right here.

“Let’s go, Anon.” She said after a while. “I’m getting cold.”

You were confused at her statement, looking lost as to what to do next. Mio pouted at you with her eyes and asked what train you took to go home.

~*~

Mio’s husband got home with his usual mood. He got himself a beer and some snacks and sat before the TV for a few hours. Once he asked loudly what’s for dinner, he realized he was alone. Mio was nowhere to be seen. He tried calling her once, but her phone was turned off. He sighed, made himself a sandwich and went to sleep.

~*~

You checked your phone. 11:41 read the screen. Incredibly anxious, you began noticing all the details of your apartment. The walls had a little portion peeling itself near the air conditioning which still wasn’t working, your bedframe had a small veil of dust you could clearly see, you ran your finger across it and it came out black, your desk was a mess with papers and notebooks all over, your trash can was almost overflowing with crumpled papers, your get-up shoes were tossed into the floor, the zip up hoodie you used to workout hanged by one side on the chair, and so on, and so forth.

Your heart was beating fast, revving up like a motorbike. Finally, she made her presence after asking to use your bathroom.

Mio entered the room gracefully, your bedroom lights didn’t do her justice. The shinning sun or the pale moon gave Mio her rightful place in the world of beauty, magnifying her all her pretty details, and here they were wasted under the light of a cheap apartment.  

Mio sat at the edge of the bed next to you and leaned in closer, first she gave you a short kiss to tease you, letting her arms coil around your lower back, gently reaching under your shirt and running her hands on your abdomen. You shivered at the touch of Mio’s soft, fine hands. She blew air through her nose at your reactions, before giving you another kiss, longer and wetter than the last. Her lips they had a taste you couldn’t describe. Cherry? Chocolate? Liquor? Whether it was your imagination or her lipstick, it was the taste of Mio. Mio began pulling your shirt up without stopping the kiss, getting your tongues involved without hurry, you had the night to yourselves and no one but your walls and the moon would know. Finally Mio broke the kiss and took off your shirt, revealing your bare chest. Mio giggled softly, before going for your mouth once more, the third kiss was short lived like the first, but that was only because Mio gave you the fourth on your cheek, then the fifth on your upper neck, each one going lower and lower. She nibbled on your pecs, gently biting them and sucking with great force to leave a hickey, a little mark for you to remember, you felt your chest wet and your brain shooting an electric shock all across your body. You were scorching all over, and so was Mio. By this point you had lost count of how many times she kissed you.

Mio in turn took off her hoodie, but then seemed unsure about her shirt, still conscious about her body. You reached her shirt by the bottom, grabbing it with both hands, looking into her eyes for her approval. Mio looked to the side, and you took that as a yes. She closed her eyes and lifted her arms up as the shirt came off, hoping that you wouldn’t have an expression of disgust.

Your breathing was getting heavier than you expected, there she was, Ookami Mio, laid almost bare before you. Her body was that of a mature woman, one that aged like a fine wine alongside a healthy spirit. She had some stretch marks, showing that she had become bigger than she used to be once, her belly was pudgy, giving you easily a handful of it for your hand, her breasts, covered by a black bra, were big yet retained an elegant form when she stood up, you pulled her bra up and above her breasts, making Mio squeal in surprise, her nipples pink and her areolas a medium size. You turned your attention to her waist, you could see her love handles peeking from above her leggings, and you wanted more. You slid your index fingers to the sides of her legwear and pinched with your thumbs, slowly pushing them down.

“A-Anon…” Mio mumbled, but you didn’t hear, lost in trance.

You revealed her bare legs, as plump as ever. Her thigs were a milky white and retained their plumpness as you squeezed them, causing Mio to shake. Mio was wearing black panties, matching her bra. Between her womanhood and her belly her pubic was sticking out in contrast to her pale skin.

Mio was feeling shame, whishing she could’ve met you when she was at her prime, but a sudden feeling shook her out of her sadness. You kissed Mio’s belly softly and gently like it was her forehead, gripping her love handles with great care. 

Before you laid Aphrodite, the goddess of love and sex. She had a distinctive kind of beauty, one that only shows physically when the soul is also as beautiful. She didn’t have the body of a twenty-year-old, but that didn’t matter because *this* was the body of Mio, the body of the woman that made your heart flutter, the woman that made you filled with lust and the same woman whose kind words could make you feel as if you were hearing a chorus of angels. You left Mio’s belly alone with one last kiss and rose up to her face, looking at her with lust, Mio still gathering herself.

You saw in her eyes the confusion and sadness that she harbored, the poor girl was feeling exposed, and you knew she needed to *feel* what you felt inside, with an honest kiss, you whispered into her ear.

“I wouldn’t change a thing about you, Mio.” You said, kissing her again. “Not one single detail.” You let your tongue shamelessly into her mouth, only stopping to breathe. Mio was beginning to get lost in the moment, undoing your pants in a hurry, wanting to make you feel as good as you made her feel. She prompted herself up and took off her bra, then opened her legs wide apart to let you on top of her comfortably. You penis was beyond hard, grinding through your underwear onto Mio’s panties, leaking at the tip. You made sure your shaft would run across her slit from base to top, making you shiver at the feeling, Mio too, felt the pleasure running up her spine every time you pushed. She ran her hands up and down your back as her breathing became heavier, needing more frequent pauses from your kisses to catch her breath. You were nervous. You had gotten this far and yet you couldn’t shake off one particular fear. Mio hugged you tightly, pressing your chest onto hers, feeling how her soft breasts accommodated your figure felt insane, you could feel her nipples rubbing close to yours, hard as nails. Mio’s hand ran in circles on your back, reaching lower and lower for your underwear. At first she slid one finger down and ran it across, grazing your cock barely.

You spilled the beans. 

“M-Mio!”

“H-Huh?” Mio stopped her hand.

“I-I…” You fumbled.

Mio waited patiently for you to finish, but you couldn’t say it.

“I-I’m just, I-I’m just starting out, okay?”

You felt your heart sink. You had to let her know just in case. You knew guys tend to cum fast on their first time. You felt Mio’s left hand on your cheek. When your gaze met hers, you saw pure lust. A lecherous stare and a bit of drool. Mio kept caressing your cheek with her thumb, her index on your jaw. 

“Oh Anon~” Her tone suddenly changed, sounding a lot more dominant and motherly. You had unleashed a beast Mio kept hidden, not because she wanted to, but because she hadn’t a reason to let out.

Until now.

Mio turned you over with herself, now being on top of you, the bed was small, but she accommodated herself between the wall and you. She caressed your abdomen, running her hand up and down, slowly going lower to your hips with each motion. Her soft hands made you shiver as she reached closer. Finally she stopped at your crotch and squeezed your member gently. The sensations running through your body were enough to drive you insane.

“Oh Anon~!” Mio said again before coming closer to your ear. “What do you want me to do?~” Her sensual low voice wouldn’t let up, you felt it ringing inside your ears, knowing fully you’d never be the same. That voice was making love by itself to your ears, giving you the most obscene but marvelous high. 

“I-I want to…” You tried to say anything that wouldn’t kill the mood.

“Yes?~” Mio pressed you, slowly sliding her hand under your underwear, not yet touching your member, but gently touching your side hips.

“I want you to turn me into a man.” You finally said, you looked at Mio with a bit of embarrassment, she gave you the same lecherous stare she had given you a few moments ago, accompanied by a simple smile.

“Very well.” Said Mio. “I’ll turn you into *my* man.” 

You felt your heart jump at her words. Mio slowly grabbed your erect member and gently jerked it off under your underwear. The sensations you felt coming from your throbbing cock made you melt. You didn’t think it would feel this good to receive a handjob from a girl, but you knew that wasn’t the case. It felt this good because it was *her*. Mio pulled her hand up trying to take off your underwear, you helped her and tossed it aside. Seeing your erect member, Mio swallowed. She kept jerking your cock from base to top, with her index finger and thumb locked around it like a ring. She squeezed it gently to make sure you’d feel it as you deserved. Mio marveled herself at your expressions, how you let air out and closed your eyes tilting your head back was a wonderful scenery, but she decided that you deserved something else. Something better. She lowered her body down to your hips and jerked you with one hand, using the other to rest her face on. Her legs were off the bed, hanging out in the cold, but she didn’t care. Mio looked at you playfully, knowing fully what you wanted, toying with you a little bit. The way you saw her soft cheek become accustomed to her palm and her calm, serene eyes made your heart throb, and something else, too.

Mio inhaled the thick musk of your cock, watering at her mouth. “Ahhh~” Mio opened her mouth and hovered over your cock, slowly letting her tongue hang behind it, giving it only a small tap with the tip of her tongue. You let out a loud pant and Mio giggled. You felt that through your entire body, running up your abdomen and down your thighs, across your chest, all the way up to your head. Mio looked at you with delight, your expression begging her to continue. Mio licked your tip, wetting it all over, you saw a string of her saliva run down to your pelvis. Mio couldn’t help herself, the smell and taste of your manhood had awoken an insatiable appetite inside her, she then took your head into her mouth and began sucking it, using her tongue as an aid inside.

Your legs twitched in pleasure, which made Mio overflow with lust. You felt the warm insides of her mouth, wet and sloppy, the texture of her inner cheeks was something to behold. Slowly Mio took more of your cock in her mouth, trying to reach the bottom but stopping a few inches short. The sensation only shot itself harder as Mio went on, feeling light like a cloud, energized and hungry for her, like you’ve been all this time. Mio’s tongue coiled around your cock, pulling back and forth with a needy desire for you as her head began bobbing up and down, you dick shinning with her saliva for a few seconds under the lights of the apartment, only to disappear once more under her mouth. You couldn’t hold it any longer.

“M-Mio, I’m gonna-!”

With that, Mio picked up her pace and began sucking with a gentle force on half of your dick while her hand jerked the rest. You heart was beating fast, your legs were becoming spaghetti, and looking up the ceiling you let out a loud moan as you came. Mio felt you shoot your cum in her mouth, and swallowed it without letting a single drop go to waste. As you caught your breath, Mio gently jerked you as you went soft and letting up as you did. She looked proudly at your expression, a mix of shock, pleasure, and an absolute look of satisfaction.

“Did you like it, Anon?”

Still catching your breath, you did your best to answer.

“I-I loved it.”

Mio smiled.

“Well, that should be enough for the night. Now get some sleep, you look really tired.”

“Enough?” You thought. You had your fun, but Mio didn’t. No. You wouldn’t let the night go to waste with the pretense of sleep, not without showing Mio you loved her.

Mio sat on the bed looking for her shirt to use as a pajama, but suddenly she felt your arms around her waist.

“Anon, it’s ok, you don’t have to overdo yourself.”

Her words expressed concern for you, but you didn’t care, so your hand reached for her womanhood with some timidity, waiting for any sign of rejection, none that Mio gave. 

“Ah… you’re so stubborn…” Mio said. “Listen Anon, I don’t really need to-“But her words were caught short as one of your fingers gently caressed her pink pearl. Her bush was brushing your wrist, it had a thickness you could feel. Mio squealed, sucking air through her teeth. She turned to face you and saw you looking at her with a pretty smile that grew wider as her eyes met yours. Only looking at your eyes, she understood your intentions.

After so long, feeling the hand of someone she loved on her, touching her because he wanted her to feel good, because he wanted to share the feeling with her unlocked a dusty little box in her chest. Mio felt as if she was about to burst, the same feelings that she had once in her younger days, the unabridged, uncontrolled love you can feel only when you’re young and full of hope, before you’re crushed by the demands and needs of adulthood. The carefree nature of such love, with no regards for the future as long as you had the present, as long as you could wake up and relive it all over again, like a beautiful sunset that you hoped would never end, knowing the sun would disappear into the horizon at some point but choosing to believe it would remain there forever. That was what she felt right then, under the lights of your apartment, on top of an old single size bed and hopelessly lost in your warm, loving embrace. 

She felt as if she was seventeen again.

You bit Mio’s shoulder with lust as she let a loud, pleasureful moan. Her panties were becoming soaked with her love juice, causing Mio to almost rip them apart in one go. She laid back on the bed as she originally intended. Minutes before she would’ve felt ashamed of her hairy, thick bush like the rest of her body, but not anymore. She had nothing to hide from you, more precisely, she had everything she wanted to give you. Your mouth ran a tour of Mio’s legs, from her soft soles to her beautifully firm calves and her plump thighs, giving her soft kisses and running your tongue across the last parts. While you were between Mio’s legs, she locked them around your head, sandwiching your head with her smooth, milky thighs. The texture of those soft pillows must’ve been what hugging a cloud was like. 

“*Hoooh.*” You let out in a pleased tone. Mio smiled.

“You like that, Anon?” 

“I fucking love it. Your legs feel amazing, Mio”

Once more Mio giggled at the second swear word she heard coming of your mouth, flattered all the more that she made it come out. Mio let you go, and you kept rising with your kisses, giving her a gentle suck on her flower bulb, which made Mio squirm. The smell of Mio’s crotch was burning through your nostrils. Sweat and love juice. You kept going higher with your mouth, nibbling her soft, pudgy belly with your teeth. Mio caressed your head with joy as she saw enjoying yourself with her. At you reached for her breasts, you fondled the left with your left hand, as your mouth assaulted the right one. Licking around it, sucking it with force and love, Mio was loving it, her own body was shaky from the sensations you made her feel, feeling tingly all over, she kept masturbating as you want on, only for her hand to be pushed away by yours, caressing her womanhood gently, trying to find the clitoris once more, looking for a little meaty bulb, and then gently rubbing it like you saw in some H-Game. Her hands free, Mio placed them both on your buttocks, then ran them up your back and accidentally dug her nail in a bit too hard, leaving a little scratch mark. You stopped what you were doing at the sudden pain.

“Oh! I’m s-sorry Anon.”

You gave no response.

Mio got worried for a bit. 

“D-Did it hurt?” 

“Do it again.” 

“H-Huh?”

“Do it more, mess my back up with your nails.” You commanded her.

Mio snapped out of her confusion, and her lustful stare met your eyes once more.

“Oh~ So you like it when I do *this*~?” Mio ran her nails from top to bottom with a gentle force, a small white line would appear under them.

You clenched your teeth and sucked air in in the newfound pleasure, Mio gave you a little peck, asking you to comfort her lonely mouth and you complied with great enthusiasm.

You lined your cock with Mio’s garden, not sure where to go from there, so she grabbed your erect member and pulled on it gently, telling you to come closer, she lined it up with her hole and told you to push.

Mio’s lower lips felt a lot like the insides of her mouth, fleshy and smooth, that alone would’ve been enough to make you cum, but with some willpower, you slowly pushed yourself in. As your head entered her, you felt shivers down your spine, shooting constantly and stronger than they did before, your breath was a mess but so was Mio’s, enjoying every second, every inch of you. You stopped halfway through to calm yourself, attempting to not cum immediately, but it was hard. Mio’s insides, warm and wet gratefully took you in, squeezing you with force, never wanting to let go. Mio grew impatient, so she locked her legs behind your back and pushed you in with her knees. The sudden feeling made you moan lustfully, almost shamefully, Mio delighted herself with the sounds you made, those of making love and not just sex. 

“Sorry about that, Anon.” She said with a mischievous smile.

You couldn’t be mad at her, not while still melting inside. Mio kept squeezing your with her insides as you burned the feeling into your memory, closely located next to every little detail you learned about her body, from the contrast between her white skin and her black, hairy bush, the softest parts of her love handles as your hands remembered them, the little bits of fat you nibbled on her belly, the taste of her sweat as you ran your tongue and mouth across her legs. Your body began unconsciously moving back and forth, getting a bit rougher every thrust. You grabbed Mio’s legs and felt their soft form and milky texture, you grabbed Mio’s belly and felt the pudgy goodness, then you grabbed her breasts and squeezed them gently. You couldn’t get enough of her, all of your senses were shooting like crazy. Your eyes at the sight of the woman you longed, your body feeling every inch of her hers, your ears hearing the sound of flesh slapping flesh mixed with the pants and moans you two would let out,  the smell that emanated from Mio and you, body sweat, cologne and more, making a mix of strong musk that you loved, and your mouth, savoring every little taste it got that night, from her lips to her salty sweat.

It was too much to bear at this point. Your movements became rapid and erratic, overtaken by primal instincts, the feeling of Mio's warm insides in crontast with the cold air of fall as your cock moved out was insane. Her walls were devouring you with need. You felt yourself close to your climax, yet knowing you couldn’t just taint Mio like that, not without her approval. Your thrusts slowed down and Mio knew you were going to cum, so she quickly thought of leglocking you inside her, but before you came, you pulled out and sprayed your seed all over her, landing on her tits and belly. Mio came too, but was a little disappointed.

Catching your breath, you felt Mio’s hand on your cheek. You looked at her with expectancy, hoping that you made her happy. Mio in turn, returned a kind stare that told you so.

You grabbed some toilet paper and cleaned her. Mio didn’t have the guts to tell you that she wanted you to cum inside her. But she would, she knew that time would come, she just needed to be patient.

You turned off the lights, covered each other with a thick, warm blanket and spooned her naked body after, nibbling her ear with love.

“Anon.”

“Y-Yes?”

Mio’s face reddened, not that it could be seen in the darkness, but she felt the blood rushing to her face.

“I love you.”

You felt yourself slowly beginning to float.

“I love you too, Mio.”

And so, Ookami Mio slept soundly like a baby for the first time in months.

Her name was written next to another man’s in a paper, but in her heart, yours was engraved with fire.
