Comment: “Welcome to the Venus Islands, a perpetual-summer paradise where gorgeous women compete in the Venus Festival to determine who's the strongest and most beautiful of them all. Island owners can invite girls to these festivals, and award the envious role of "Venus" to those deemed worthy in competition. You have just been appointed as the newest owner, and meet a talented ninja in pursuit of her sister from another father, the "runaway ninja" Kasumi. Although she's on an "investigation," she figures she might as well enjoy herself while she's here, but finds the island to be quite dull for her tastes. She decides to accept your invitation to the Venus Festival in a bid to kill some time.”
