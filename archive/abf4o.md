## Lord Devan Fernal 
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING CRIMINAL CASE FILES ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete of so called 'Lord' Fernel. User has misidentified their technique as Vaapad. Indicating suboptimal understanding of relevant forms and underlying combat principles. ++

++ CLASSIFICATION: SUBJECT CASE FILE SS-07-61 ++

++ OBSERVATION: The Sith has adequately demonstrated a high degree of proficiency in Juyo. A suitable combat style for a life form of his size, disposition, and temperment. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Sith scum inadvertently circumventing primary historical concerns regarding the user of Juyo. ++

++ CRITIQUE: SUBJECT SS-07-61 has three critical flaws that need rectification or are suitable for exploitation. Most notably RIGID STANCE TRANSITION. SUBECT SS-07-61 has routinely demonstrated across several evidence logs rigid transition between forms. This delay could allow sufficiently observant foes to predict his flow and therefore defeat one of the primary strengths of Juyo - unpredictability and erratic movements.

++ CRITIQUE: SUBJECT SS-07-61 has proven to be a slave to his emotional state. The subject will make mistakes if adequately provoked. ++

++ ADDENDUM: SUBJECT SS-07-61 preferred form will become more deadly as his mental state deteriorates, caution is advised. ++

++ OBSERVATION SUBTYPE: CONCERN: SUBJECT SS-07-61 operates well outside the normal thresholds for Sith combatants. It is estimated he has higher than average connectivity to the Force as well as a natural affinity to bodily reinforcement and extreme stamina reserves. Both of which make exceptionally well suited to Form VII: Juyo ++

++ CONCLUSION: THREAT LEVEL SEVERE. ONLY S CLASS GUARDIANS TO ENGAGE ALONE. STRIKE TEAM OF AT LEAST 3 A CLASS KNIGHTS MINIMUM RECOMMENDED. PADAWAN ENGAGEMENT PROHIBITED ++

## Jedi Knight Netra
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING PADAWAN TRAINING MANUSCRIPTS ++
++ LOADING MISSION LOGS ++
++ LOADING PERSONNEL FILES ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete of Jedi Knight Netra. Biography summary: Grade A student, repeated demerits for poor behaviour. ++

++ CLASSIFICATION: SUBJECT: JK-DJ4-907 'Netra' ++

++ STATEMENT: Netra was a highly proficient learner. However did not abide by recommendations to pursue maatery of either Form II or Form III to completion. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Failure to conform to IG-SX recommendation has led to excess waste in light saber combat proficiency. ++

++ OBSERVATION: SUBJECT Netra is recorded as capable in both Shatter point and Battle Precognition.++

++ STATEMENT: SUBJECT Netra is allocated automatic combat rating of A class. ++

++ OBSERVATION: SUBJECT Netra lacks sufficient physicality to achieve high levels of excellence with Form V shien and djem so. The concurrent study of Form V shien and Form III soresu provides diminishing returns and is a suboptimal return on training investment. ++

++ STATEMENT: SUBJECT Netra has remarkably achieved grest success employing this 'unorthodox' concoction of forms. ++

++ CRITIQUE: The employment of dual blade sabers
defence is Ill advised for soresu practitioners having higher stamina consumption and slower reaction times. This is in condradiction to well establish soresu principles. ++

++ CRITIQUE: The employment of dueling lenses for soresu masters is suboptimal, diminishing ranged protection by as much as 47.89%. ++

++ ADDENDUM: SUBJECT Netra employs dual lenses to switch between. While noted, this platform still strongly discourages employment of dueling lenses for both form III practitioners and dual blade practictioners. 

++ STATEMENT: Doubly so for those Jedi who stubbornly employ both. ++

++ CONCLUSION: SUBJECT Netra has chosen to employ a suboptimal combat method despite repeated instruction and explaination by her instructors. SUBJECT Netra can safely be labelled: Arrogant. ++

++ ADDENDUM: Unable to modify automatic combat class rating. Rating remains extant A class. ++

## Tha'aia'ike
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LIMITED RESULTS FOUND ++
++ LOADING CRIMINAL CASE FILES ++
++ REQUESTING ACCESS TO DRAX INDUSTRIES PERSONNEL LOGS ++
++ ACCESS DENIED ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete for SUBJECT [no designation] ++

++ CLASSIFICATION: NEW SUBJECT CASE FILE CC-00-43 ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete for SUBJECT CC-00-43 "eye eye". Subject is a force sensitive gun for hire. Displaying above average understanding of both Force techniques and bladework. ++

++ CONJECTURE: It is highly likely SUBJECT CC-00-43 is being, or has been trained by renegade jedi or Sith agents. Probability of individual attaining recorded proficiency is astronomically low. ++

++ OBSERVATION: The subject employs novel bladework with shifting blade size to better employ various combat forms. ++

++ OBSERVATION: The subject has demonstrated adequate levels of proficiency across all major lightsaber forms. Achieving notable success with Form II. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Subject age is unknown however imagery provided suggests young implying extraordinary combat affinity. ++

++ CRITIQUE: Subjects small frame necessitates comprehensive use of force augmentation to suitably employ Forms III, IV, V, VI, VII. ++

++ STATEMENT: Evidence suggests the subject is aware of this shortfall and has trained force body and control appropriately ++

++ ADDENDUM: As the subject continues to grow the degree to which this affects them will continue to diminish. ++

++ CRITIQUE: Despite subject natural athleticism and affinity to learn light saber combat. IG-SX notes a demonstrateably poor mental state in addition to a lack of formal education has led to several identifiable flaws in each form. ++

++ CRITIQUE: The subjects shifting blade while novel telegraphs upcoming change in form and is a notable detriment to several form usage ++

++ CRITIQUE: The subject has over 3 dozen flaws across the suite of techniques that need rectification or are suitable for exploitation. Most notably PREMATURE SHOULDER DROP. The subject routinely demonstrated her left shoulder dropping by approximately 2-3cm prior to launching attacks, regardless of form undertaken. The likihood of demonstration varied by up to 15% with the least likely being Form VII and the most likely being Form IV. This telegraph was agnostic to blade configuration.

++ CONCLUSION: THREAT LEVEL Medium to High. A highly proficient close quarters specialist who is likely to continue in growth however is insufficient in most regards to experienced Guardian Masters. Be advised evidence does suggest potent telekinetic capacity as well.

## Padawan Farem Jarrik
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING PADAWAN TRAINING MANUSCRIPTS ++
++ LOADING MISSION LOGS ++
++ LOADING PERSONNEL FILES ++
++ APPLYING INSTRUCTOR FILTER ++
++ MODERATING INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS ++

++ [censored] STATEMENT: Padawan Jarrik is an [REDACTED] student. He is unruly and distracts other Padawans during lessons. ++

++ STATEMENT: Padawan Jarrik is a prodigal student who excels at all aspects of learning having above average aptitude at basic force power implementation as well as demonstrating notable aptitude at battle precognition. He is one of the youngest to attain official mastery of the IV form. ++

++ OBSERVATION: habitual poor behaviours will likely impede continued growth. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Padawan Jarrik has taken well to Form IV. It suits his energetic nature well and is supplimented by his high baseline agility. ++

++ CRITIQUE: Implementation of curved hilt lightsabers as a default is a poor choice and weakens his employment of Ataru significantly. Jar'kai already lowers his natueal striking power by more than a third and when combined with this grip I estimate he is suffering upwards of 60% loss in overall combat effectiveness. ++

++ CRITIQUE: Training vlogs suggest Padawan Jarrik continues to train in Shii-cho and Shien. Likely because of his impatience towards adapting the more suitable Ataru and Makashi techniques to unconvential situations. Padawan Jarrik [filter translation - is again reminded] that Shii-cho offers little if anything to him that Ataru mastery has not already provided. If his intent is to round out his portfolio in terms of defence Shien and Shii-cho are better replaced with Soresu. 

++ CONCLUSION: Padawan Jarrik reliance on his undeniable talent has become a stifling constraint on his development. Rendering him dismissive of crucial advice and alternate views.  His relentless blind hubris and unwillingness to slow down has led to several flaws in otherwise masterful bladework. Failure to conduct meaningful self reflection will exacerbated his already poor behaviour and make him ever more susceptible to the lure of the Darkside. ++

##Padawan Keru Yamoshi
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING PADAWAN TRAINING MANUSCRIPTS ++
++ LOADING MISSION LOGS ++
++ LOADING PERSONNEL FILES ++
++ APPLYING INSTRUCTOR FILTER ++

++ STATEMENT: Padawan Yamoshi is a another student is excels well above her peers. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Padawan Yamoshi is well suited to this form in body and in mind, allowing her to achieve early and repeated success in learning it. Her natural affinity for battle, and brazen attitude fuels the directness and leans into the kinetic side of the form perfectly. ++

++ STATEMENT: Padawan Yamoshi is lucky to have had such observant and insightful instructors to lead her so well. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Padawan Yamoshi's inclusion of wrestling, throws, and unarmed strikes only compound the advantage she will have in close quarters battle with unsuspecting enemies. ++

++ STATEMENT: Advise caution when utilising unarmed techniques against lightsaber users without fully comprehending advanced tutaminus.++

++ CRITIQUE: Padawan Yamoshi despite having the martial skills of a knight or young master is still below her peers in self-restraint and her meditations. With duty logs suggesting she is absent from more than 3/4 of her scheduled meditation classes.++

++CONCLUSION: Padawan Yamoshi is recommended to continue study under Master Kadi for a further 6 months. However steps should be taken to ensure that their tempermental nature's are made to conflict prompting growth, and the Council must be mindful of the risk of their nature's resonating could drive both further from the Jedi Ideal.++

## Master Kir Kadi
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING MISSION LOGS ++
++ LOADING PERSONNEL FILES ++

++STATEMENT: Analysis complete. Master Kadi has previously demonstrated a high degree of proficiency in Form IV Ataru. A suitable combat style for a life form of his size, disposition, and temperment. He is one of few masters within the Order that can sustain prolonged engagements whilst utilising the form. His expansion to Niman as per my advice has granted him a vast array of options and allows him to better leverage his potent force abilities. ++

++OBSERVATION: Evidence suggests Master Kadi no longer fights with his Saber as a form of protest. ++

++STATEMENT: This platform does not understand the utility in discarding ones primary weapon as an act of protest. Significant reduction to combat effectiveness.++

++ STATEMENT: Armed; Master Kadi is easily an S class Guardian who has mastered battle precognition, shatter point, tutaminus, and force body and is able to at least somewhat mitigate lasting harm with force rejuvenation. Unarmed, he is estimated to be between S and A class.

++ CRITIQUE: Master Kadi relies on his Kage speed and inherent physical attributes to overwhelm enemies, however without sufficient armor or a lightsaber he is extremely vulnerable to overwhelming enemy numbers and overmatched weapon advantages. Tutaminus and high speed will only carry him so far. ++

++ CONCLUSION: Master Kadi can improve following 2 easy steps. 1. Take up your Saber once more. 2. Spend more time in mediations. Reflecting on your wayward wraith and how it's leading you down a dark path. ++

## Jedi Knight Kaillos
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LOADING MISSION LOGS ++
++ LOADING PERSONNEL FILES ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete. Knight Kaillos is yet to demonstrate adequate and appropriate levels of combat proficiency for a Jedi of his standing. ++

++ OBSERVATION: A failure to master neither Makashi nor Shien is a significant oversight on Knight Kaillos' behalf. ++

++ CRITIQUE: No self respecting Jedi, who is still unable to transition flawlessly from Rain over the Moon to Swooping Grasshopper would arm themselves would call themselves a Guardian... Yet here we are. ++

++OBSERVATION: Since my removal from the approval board for Padawan proficiencies, the overall combat effectiveness of Jedi Knights has dropped by at 9.64% on average, with some outliers markedly worse. ++

++ CONCLUSION: Knight Kaillos despite being well regard high performer all round is far from the standard expected of a Jedi Master, whether it comes to inwards reflection and self control, or continued poor martial performance. ++

## Sith Apprentice Ah'Navi
++ QUERYING JEDI ARCHIVE ++
++ LIMITED RESULTS FOUND ++
++ LOADING CRIMINAL CASE FILES ++

++ STATEMENT: Analysis complete. No case file in archives. ++

++ CLASSIFICATION: SUBJECT CASE FILE SS-07-84 ++

++ STATEMENT: capture of the Subject and appropriate correctional services should be employed if possible in relation to this target. ++

++ OBSERVATION: Despite her youth she has displayed uncommon skill and high levels of natural aptitude in the force. ++

++ STATEMENT: Without an instructor or mentor to hone her abilities she will soon plateau in ability. As evidenced by her already directionless training curriculum largely wasting her potential. ++

++ CONCLUSION: THREAT LEVEL Low. Recommendation is that a Task be assigned to either a Strike Team or Master to capture this target once manpower can be allocated. ++
