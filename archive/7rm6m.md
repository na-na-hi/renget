#Seafood Surprise

When Abbi approached Sunny to tell him about her “new development,” he already had a pretty good idea of what was in store.

Knowing the way his… lewder dreams had been going lately, it wasn’t much of a surprise when she pulled down her underwear (now a pair of boxers to accommodate her new appendage) to reveal a penis.

What *was* surprising was that it was a tentacle.

…though maybe it shouldn't have been much of a shock, considering Abbi's nature.

Unlike her other tentacles, the whole thing had the same texture all the way around.

No suckers, just a smooth tendril.

It was completely black, save for where the base connected to Abbi’s crotch, which faded into the same color as the rest of her body.

"Huh." Sunny looked down at it curiously.

”That’s… new.” 

”Indeed. Though I can’t say it was unexpected, considering your newfound interest.” Sunny blushed.

He had been having a lot of dreams about girls with dicks lately.

Like, a *lot*.

Maybe too many.

”Can you move it?” he asked, rather than pursuing that line of thought any further.

”As easily as I can any other limb, yes.” To demonstrate this point, the tentacle rose and wiggled a bit, as if it was waving at him.

Sunny couldn’t help but giggle at the absurdity of it.

”What? What’s so funny?” 

”You’re waving at me with your dick.” Abbi seemed to ponder this for a moment.

“Well, when you put it like that, I suppose it is rather ridiculous.” There was a brief, slightly awkward pause.

"So, would you like to tou--" "Yes." Sunny reached out a hand to grasp it, and his fingers barely grazed it when Abbi squeaked and squirmed a little.

”Did that hurt?” 

”No… no, it didn’t hurt. It felt rather nice, actually. I’m just quite sensitive down there.” Oh she was, was she? He would have to press his advantage then.

Sunny took the tentacle into his hand, trying to get a grip on it as best he could, made slightly difficult by the sliminess of it.

He managed, though, and Abbi responded with a startled little yelp that tapered off into a breathy sigh. He started to stroke it from base to tip, slowly enough to keep hold of it.

Despite the languid motion, Abbi seemed to be having the time of her life, squirming and groaning and wiggling her hips. She aided Sunny’s endeavor by moving the tendril in time with his hand.

After a few seconds of this, a black fluid began leaking from the the tip in a steady stream, coating Sunny’s hand.

Curious, he brought it up to his face. It was thick, but not really sticky. It slipped through his fingers like hand soap.

As he was wont to do in situations such as these, Sunny stuck one of his digits into his mouth to taste the stuff.

It was salty, a little briny, and there was a vague hint of something else that reminded him of something he had at a restaurant one time.

Soy sauce, maybe?

…not bad.

Abbi wasn’t surprised when Sunny got moved to get on his knees.

On the contrary, she seemed amused.

“You just can’t resist, can you?” Sunny felt his cheeks flush in embarrassment.

In lieu of a comeback, he squeezed Abbi’s tentacle. Not very tightly at all, but it got a surprised moan out of her and made the appendage leak a little more ink. With a satisfied smirk on his face, Sunny brought it to his mouth.

It was… weird.

Not necessarily unpleasant, but undoubtably alien.

Sunny wasn’t exactly sure what he expected a tentacle wriggling around in his mouth would feel like.

Abbi moved the thing with a surprising amount of dexterity; it rubbed against his tongue, the roof of his mouth, along his teeth, against the inside of his cheeks, and everywhere else he could think of.

Even while she thoroughly defiled his mouth, however, Abbi did take care not to go too deep.

As her tentacle probed his mouth, it leaked more inky goop, even faster than when Sunny was using his hand.

He had to swallow it constantly to keep it from overflowing.

”Mm, Sunny, something is- ah- I’m going to…” Opening his eyes (he hadn’t realized he had closed them), Sunny saw the part of the appendage that wasn’t in his mouth bulge noticeably.

He felt it taking up a bit more space in his mouth too, before— Abbi nearly shrieked as a torrent of ink gushed from her tentacle, flooding Sunny’s mouth nearly immediately.

He attempted to swallow it all as it came, but was unable to stop some of it from dribbling out of his mouth and onto the ground.

Soon enough, the inky stream began to slow, then stopped completely.

Sunny swallowed the last of it, and Abbi slipped the tendril out of his mouth and fell to the ground on her butt, her knees given out.

She sat and breathed heavily for a while, regaining her composure.

Sunny scratched the back of his head.

"Well, that was-- what are you laughing about?" Abbi covered her mouth with her hand in a feeble attempt to hide her sudden giggling fit.

"You-- your-- your tongue...!" 

"My tongue?" He turned his head, and a mirror conveniently popped into existence to reveal that his tongue had been stained completely black by Abbi's ink.

Wonderful.

Just as Sunny was pondering the sudden coloring of his tongue, he felt a soft hand grip the back of his head.

He was made to turn around, and found himself now in a deep kiss with Abbi.

Pleasantly surprised, he moaned into the kiss, dully noting that the tongue that met his was as equally flexible as the tentacle that just probed it minutes ago.

Abbi's tongue hungrily ravished his mouth, taking her sweet time to taste every inch of him and herself.

Her hands didn't remain idle, stroking herself to further arousal.

Satisfied, Abbi separated from Sunny, 'staring' at him with her eyeless face, and with a thin line of saliva that broke once she got far enough.

"Sunny...We still have a bit more time, don't we? And the both of us aren't nearly satisfied with just that..." Abbi breathily whispers onto his face, lust slowly starting to overwhelm the wise being.

"Yeah..." Sunny eagerly nodded, his own hands slowly roaming Abbi's body, making her hum and moan in response.

"Let's - hah - take it just a bit further, is that fine with you?" At this, Abbi's hand snaked down to grip Sunny's own boxers.

He gulped in response, a thrill shooting down his spine as he realizes just what she wants.

He only nodded once more, hooking his own hands and pulling the restricting fabric off, allowing his own cock to whip free.

The way Abbi shivered and hissed upon the sight of his cock sent a surge of pride and greater desire through him.

Abbi slowly inched her own body closer to Sunny's, and once she felt his hot breaths on her skin, his cock pressing insistently against her tummy, she acted. Her sensitive tendril rubbed against Sunny's own hardness, prompting a moan from the both of them.

Then Abbi coiled her tentacle around his cock, and the both of them shivered from the alien but pleasurable sensation.

With what composure she had left, Abbi began to move her tentacle up Sunny's shaft, the resounding shivers and jerking thrusts into each other threatening to tip their balance.

A balance that Abbi quickly took advantage of, gripping Sunny's shoulders and pushing him to lie flat on his back.

In this position, Abbi no longer held back in, her hips awkwardly bucking with no sense of rhythm, only determined to extract more of the unique pleasure of having herself wrapped around Sunny.

As for the boy in question, he too cannot hold still, trying his best to sync up with Abbi's stroking but ultimately failing.

With her tentacle wrapped around his, he could feel its wiggling cover every inch of him, each pulse and throb as the familiar ink began leaking once more, covering the place they are connected.

"Mmh! Hhh! S-Sunny... Ha-ah!" Abbi was reduced to mindless stuttering as she felt her orgasm once more quickly rising, making Sunny quiver and groan as he felt full force the powerful throbs of her tentacle, ready to spurt more fluid.

Each desperate thrust, each feverish rub and stroke of her tentacle, it became too much once again, this time squealing into the empty air as she coated Sunny's crotch and stomach with forceful spurts of ink, the thick but smooth liquid pleasantly coating the boy, sending a strange sense of fulfillment through him as he watched his lower half be coated.

They took a moment to catch their breath, Abbi's tentacle slowly becoming limper and slipping off its grip.

Abbi stared at Sunny, lying on his back and breathing just as heavy as her.

His hazy eyes and panting mouth sending another wave of warmth through her.

She felt some life stir back into her tentacle, manifesting as a twitch, then an enthusiastic wiggle against Sunny's inner thigh, the boy squirming in response.

As the ink languidly dripped from Sunny's body, Abbi pushed the initiative once more.

"Sunny... You haven't came just yet right? We can do one more, right?" Abbi spoke, her voice somewhat insistent as she began to grind her hips on his crotch, her tentacle softly wiggling, rubbing itself against Sunny's ink-slick skin.

Sunny, who for a moment, thought that Abbi ran out of steam before they could get to the good part, finds himself groaning, lifting his legs, allowing Abbi to hold them and prop it up on her shoulders. They were actually about to do this, the anticipation making Sunny pant lustfully in response.

He could feel the tendril rubbing against his thighs and butt, he can see Abbi biting her lips every time she trailed herself across his soft skin.

Seeing his usually composed friend clearing wanting him so heavily made a warm feeling rise in him.

Abbi braced herself, a hand on his thigh, the tentacle arm wrapping around the other. Her hips went lower, the tendril making soft circles as she trailed down.

Soon, she felt his opening, making her tremble in utter excitement as the tip poked and prodded it. Their breathing, more erratic now.

This was it.

Nothing but desire for each other on their minds, Sunny gave a strong nod. With that, Abbi's slick tentacle pushed itself into him, the squirming appendage feeling strange at first, giving a sensation of being filled.

Abbi's melodic moans mixed with Sunny's soft groans, both sounds encouraging each other to further partake of this carnal dance.

Soon, Abbi's hips met Sunny's butt, firmly pressed against him, and her tentacle now buried as deep as it can be. The feeling of being filled was no full force for Sunny. 

Then came the wiggling and squirming of the excitable appendage in him, and that was when he began moaning and squealing in response.

It was a new but very much so welcome sensation, the tentacle wiggling deep in him managing to stroke and press against all the right spots, faintly he could feel Abbi leaking once more, she won't last long, not with his warmth tightly wrapping around her.

It was a thoroughly consuming sensation for the poor girl, who without any further thought, began to madly jerk her hips back and forth, as well as making the tentacle wiggle wildly inside him.

"A-AH-HAAA! AAAAAAAH!" The both of them deliriously screamed aloud.

Why would they hold back? It was just the two of them in this sinful dance.

Abbi uncontrollably thrusting deep into him, once more, no rhythm at all to her technique, simply wishing to seek as much pleasure for herself as possible.

Sunny certainly didn't mind, not when the effects are just as mind-melting for him.

Each loud wet smack, each meaty slap echoed and rang through their ears, the lewd sounds further encouraging haste.

For a moment, Abbi stared down at the pleasure drunk boy she had impaled herself into, greedily accepting her unique length, and squeezing it all around with his own insides.

Whatever rationality left her mind at the immensely lewd sight, pushing forward, and dropping her body onto him, pressing Sunny into the floor.

Sunny gave an excited sound in response, his legs automatically locking around her hips as Abbi began to desperately pound down at him in a mating press.

"Sunny! Sunny! Sunny! SUNNY!" Abbi chanted his name over and over again in such a needy tone, as if each time his name left her mouth, her pleasure would increase tenfold.

"A-A-AH! ABB-mpph!" Whatever Sunny was about to say, Abbi quickly silenced with her own lips, her tongue deeply plunging and wrapping around his in a senseless dance.

And just to make certain, the tentacles on Abbi's head came to life, stretching and firmly wrapping themselves around Sunny's head, making certain he was trapped in his lip lock with the wisest.

Nothing but animalistic lusts and carnal delight, the wisest found a strange satisfaction in just letting go, further punctuated by her normal arm wrapping behind Sunny's neck and her tentacle one possessively wrapping around his torso as she ploughed the dreamer.

Sunny felt his brain turn to mush at the sensations, he felt as if he was being claimed by his own friend, her body insistently wrapping around him, her hips slamming into him, her lips and tongue exploring every corner of his mouth.

He felt the tentacle madly probing his insides, leaking the familiar goop he has come to love, simply because it was from Abbi, her each rough smack, forcing herself deeper into him, he felt each potent throb, bulging the tentacle to a degree that filled him to such completion.

Then the tip clumsily prodded a particular spot inside, followed by the rest of the flexible shaft wiggling into it.

Sunny's vision turned white as he felt his long-deserved orgasm finally come out in uncontrolled spurts.

Abbi, upon feeling her sensitive appendage press upon something that made the boy beneath her shudder helplessly, immediately focused her efforts on that spot.

She was rewarded with a powerful orgasm from the boy, the sudden clenching making her squeal into his mouth.

A few more thrust and lewd smacks, and Abbi reached her own orgasm along Sunny, her tentacle bulging considerably as a much more powerful release wracked her body, instinctively causing her to thrust as deep as she can go and wrap herself tighter around the overstimulated dreamer.

Each bulge and spurt inside him further intensified Sunny's orgasm, if he felt full before, now he was certain he was stuffed, the fluid leaking in droves out of his hole and onto the floor.

Not at all releasing him, Abbi seemingly melted atop him as each spurt felt like a piece of her wisdom ripped from her.

And it felt so damn good.

Finally, both of their highs subsided, waning away slowly, giving room to a pleasant sensation.

A moment to breath of sorts, the both of them just melting into each other, taking part of each other's divine warmth, a soft contentedness in the afterglow of their heated acts.

"Mmmh. Mmmhohh..." Abbi groaned into Sunny's mouth, head and body still held in place by her.

"Mbbhi?" Sunny tiredly mumbled into her, still somewhat recovering from what felt like the best release of his life.

"Mmmh..." Another moan. This time, punctuated with a wiggle and thrust of her hips into him.

Sunny's eyes widened. A-Again?

Slowly, but surely, Abbi's motions became enthused once more, the squirming inside him resuming, this time, making certain to hit that spot that made Sunny arch his back in response.

"Mm! Mhmm?!" Sunny tried to say something, but Abbi was to deep into her wants.

Lifting her slender hips, once more she slammed so deep into him once more, making Sunny's eyes roll to the back of his head.

Once more, the lewd sounds of flesh eagerly smacking against flesh echoed through the empty space.

It felt like Abbi wouldn't be satisfied anytime soon, not with how tight she was holding him. Not that Sunny minded.

As Sunny slowly lost himself once more into the feeling of his friend thoroughly defiling his insides, Sunny wrapped his arms around her back, completing the lock of bodies.

Wet slaps.

Hard thrusts.

Frenzied pounding.

Wonderful release.

Again and again.

Sunny would awaken next morning, with a very large stain in his boxers and a thoroughly embarrassing situation with him and his sister.

Perhaps Sunny would think back to the time when he dreamt once more, Abbi profusely apologizing for just using his body over and over again.

He really didn't mind, damn that was good, but just to satisfy his friend's guilt, they decided that he should do the same to her.

What a time that was.

...

Or maybe, Sunny would think about the way Mari seemed to just stare at the stain in his sleeping wear, softly biting her lips as a flush worked up her face.

Maybe he'll remember the way her eyes trailed over his bottom as he casually took of his boxers and casually bent over, reaching for another pair of underwear.

Perhaps he'll recall just how much he "subtly" goaded his sister, pleased to have an edge on his smug sibling, teasing her over her clear non-familial feelings they held for each other.

Maybe he'll recall that one peculiar fact that there seemed to be a rather strange throbbing bulge in her nightgown as she stared at him.

Mayhaps he'll remember just how his big sister put her unexpected penis to good use on him, his hands, his thighs, his hands, his ass.

...

Where did the girl penis even come from?

Who knows?

But those are things for another day.
