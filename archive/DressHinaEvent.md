## post-five days 

- All collectibles that aren't notes can be found on day 1
- The crayons are found in trashcan in the classroom. You need to check it three times in a row to obtain it. 
- All note collectibles are found near an event, usually around 2-3 every day. This means that they're time-gated. 
- You end every day playing the piano.
