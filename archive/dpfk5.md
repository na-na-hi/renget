#Night Chores

The estate's grandeur was evident in its elaborate architecture, finely manicured gardens, and an air of prosperity that seemed to linger in the very breeze. For the discerning observer, this expansive domain was an unmistakable testament to the wealth of its owners.

As she stood on the threshold of the grand mansion, Mei Lan's mind wandered to the curious sequence of events that had brought her to this peculiar situation. Her fellow maids, eager to seize the night's pleasures, had frantically scoured the town in search of a replacement, a substitute to assume their responsibilities for the evening. On such short notice, the prospect seemed unlikely, but necessity had driven their fervor. Mei Lan's serene and composed demeanor had, in their eyes, made her an ideal candidate to shoulder the burden.

With a deep breath, she embarked on her journey through the opulent mansion, an elegant labyrinth of exquisite furnishings, fine tapestries, and polished marble floors. The grandeur and opulence were a stark contrast to the simple and modest work attire she wore.

Her first chore was to tend to the delicate porcelain collection that adorned the room's shelves. Each piece was an exquisite artifact, a fragment of history from a forgotten dynasty. Mei Lan, ever gentle in her movements, carefully dusted and arranged the porcelain with meticulous and gentle strokes.

The soft patter of her footfalls reverberated through the cavernous hallways as she moved to the grand dining room. With precision, she set about cleaning the vast dining table, an arduous task that required every bit of her concentration. Cleaning the delicate and expenisve tablecloth was already a chore on it's own as well.

As Mei Lan diligently continued her chores, her thoughts occasionally drifted to the peculiar instructions given to her by her fellow maids. They had emphasized, with a sense of utmost seriousness, that there was an esteemed guest resting in one of the vacant rooms within the sprawling estate. Under no circumstances was this guest to be disturbed, for reasons known only to her companions. Mei Lan, a paragon of discipline and respect, took their words to heart. She would never dare to breach such a solemn decree. 

But as she worked, she couldn't help but think about the well-being of the esteemed guest. A sense of responsibility weighed upon her, and so, with the unwavering dedication of a true maid, she decided to prepare a pot of fragrant tea and an array of delicate snacks, all poised on a finely crafted tray.

She carried this elegant offering to a side room, a tranquil sanctuary adorned with silk curtains that billowed with the gentle sigh of the evening breeze. Mei Lan set the tray on a low, intricately carved table near the guest's chamber. She had no intention of intruding on their slumber, but her years of service had instilled in her an intuitive understanding that even the most esteemed of guests might awaken with a longing for refreshment. She would be ready to serve, should they stir from their rest.

As she placed the teapot on a delicate warmer and arranged the snacks with utmost precision, her senses tingled with a subtle disturbance. There was a presence in the vicinity, one that did not belong to the realm of routine chores or diligent housekeeping. Mei Lan's brow furrowed ever so slightly.

She moved to the window, her graceful movements carrying her silently as she peered into the moonlit night. Beyond the carefully tended gardens, she caught a glimmer of movement. A group of armed figures, cloaked in the shadows, was stealthily making their way toward the property.

The intruders, their faces partially obscured by hoods and masks, were momentarily taken aback by the sight of the unassuming maid who dared to defy them. Mei Lan stood resolute, her demeanor as poised as ever, as she politely inquired, *"May I inquire as to the purpose of your presence here? The estate's owners are currently away, and they have left instructions for any guests or visitors. Please state your business, and if it is urgent, I shall arrange for you to wait until their return. There is also an esteemed guest resting within, and we must maintain their peace and comfort."*

The apparent leader of the group, a grizzled figure in the front, exchanged glances with his comrades, and a low murmur rippled through the ranks. They had expected little resistance from the estate's staff, let alone a diminutive maid who held nothing more than a broom and a ladle.

Mei Lan studied the intruders, their attire and equipment marking them as seasoned professionals, making them stand out of place on the outskirts of a lavish estate. Her perceptive gaze quickly assessed their capabilities, noting the subtle signs that revealed them as cultivators. While none among them surpassed Grade 2, their presence in this remote locale and the formidable weapons they carried hinted at a mysterious and lucrative assignment.

*"Your audacity is commendable, little maid,"* the leader said with a gruff chuckle, *"We have our reasons for being here, and they are indeed urgent. We're not interested in your masters, so just stay out of our way and we won't hurt you."*

The intruders start laughing at the serious-looking maid that looked like she was seriously considering fighting them then and there.

Mei Lan's response to the assailants' laughter was as unexpected as it was swift. With a resolute expression, she made a precise and well-timed strike, her ladle striking the leader's head with a sharp bonk. The audacious laughter came to an abrupt halt as the leader stumbled backward, nursing his sore head.

*"I must insist on maintaining the tranquility of this estate,"* Mei Lan calmly declared. *"Your laughter could potentially disturb our esteemed guest, and I simply cannot allow that."*

Her composed demeanor was unyielding, and it left the assailants momentarily bewildered. They had not anticipated such a reaction, and the audacity of the little maid stunned them into silence. However, the shock quickly gave way to frustration and annoyance, and in their irritation, the group decided to take a more aggressive approach.

With a sudden and coordinated burst of movement, the assailants lunged toward Mei Lan, their weapons poised for a strike, but to their astonishment, Mei Lan moved with a fluid grace that seemed almost otherworldly. 

With ease, she evaded their attacks, gracefully stepping aside or swaying to avoid the deadly arcs of their weapons. Her every movement was precise and calculated, and as she danced around her adversaries, her hands clutched the broom and ladle with a firm grip.

One by one, the assailants found themselves disarmed and defeated. With a graceful twist of her broom, Mei Lan disarmed the first, and with a flick of her ladle, she deflected the second's blade. A powerful spin sent a third assailant stumbling backward, their weapon clattering to the ground. In quick succession, Mei Lan dispatched the enemies with a precise combination of sweeps, jabs, and strikes that left them incapacitated, theit crude leader included.

Finally, Mei Lan found herself face to face with the last remaining assailant. She paused, her broom and ladle poised for action. Her opponent, who had been pretending to be just a terrified subordinate by her earlier display, dropped the act and erupted into laughter.

*"You are truly remarkable, little maid,"* he praised, his laughter echoing in the moonlit garden. *"I must admit, your skills are beyond what we expected. I'm glad I decided to hide my strength and have someone else pretend to be the leader while I measured your strength!"*

Mei Lan's expression remained impassive, and her monotone voice cut through the darkness. *"Your laughter is still too loud. You might disturb our esteemed guest."*

The bounty hunter's laughter ceased abruptly, and he met Mei Lan's unwavering gaze with a measured nod. With a flicker of his gaze and a subtle shift in his posture, the true extent of his power became apparent. He was not merely a Grade 2 Cultivator as the others were. He was... a Grade 4 cultivator!


The leader's weapon of choice, a pair of enchanted gauntlets, were formidable magic treasures, and they animated with a life of their own, one moving to intercept any attacks directed at him, and the other, equipped with claws, instinctively sought out weak points in his adversary's defenses.

He lunged forward with the confidence of his Grade 4 cultivation. His gauntlets moved with precision, one deflecting Mei Lan's broom strikes while the other delivered lethal slicing swings. However, Mei Lan's form and footwork had no weakness for the clawed gauntlet to target.

The leader, despite his initial confidence, gradually began to realize that this battle was far from one-sided. Mei Lan, with her broom in hand and her ladle poised, had been holding back, her every move calculated not only to defend against his relentless attacks but also to preserve the immaculateness of the garden.

As the duel continued, he noticed that Mei Lan's gaze never wavered, and her focus remained unwavering. With each strike, whether it was the gauntlet's attempts to exploit her defenses or her own measured counterattacks, she moved with an elegance that seemed almost choreographed.

But it was not just her martial skill that impressed the bounty hunter. He observed something far more remarkable. Mei Lan's dedication to her duties extended beyond her duty as a protector of the estate. With every movement she made, she ensured that the tranquility and tidiness of the garden were maintained.

He began to notice the subtle touches that Mei Lan applied during their battle. The fallen leaves and debris that had been scattered in their clash were swiftly swept away by the graceful sweep of her broom. Even the minor imperfections imposed on the garden by the movements of the bounty hunter were diligently corrected as she moved, her actions seamlessly blending martial prowess with meticulous care.

The enemy cultivator's realization that Mei Lan had deftly and silently moved the incapacitated assailants out of the estate only added to his frustration and humiliation. He seethed with anger, his pride wounded by the maid who had not only bested him in combat but also displayed a level of cunning and mastery that was unexpected.

Before he could vent his rage, Mei Lan spoke in a cold, emotionless tone. "There is only one last thing that must be cleaned," she declared, and with that, she unleashed her formidable technique: "Cleansing Whirlwind Assault."

This assault began with a series of swift, low sweeps that emulated the movements of a broom. Mei Lan's kicks and sweeps were executed with precision, targeting the bounty hunter's lower defenses. Each sweep disrupted his balance and defenses, creating openings for subsequent attacks.

Following the sweeping motions, Mei Lan's strikes resembled the precise act of dusting. Her every hit was designed to dislodge her opponent's balance and defenses, leaving him vulnerable to her onslaught.

As the assault continued, Mei Lan delivered rapid and precise strikes akin to the act of polishing surfaces. Her attacks focused on the most vulnerable areas, targeting joints and pressure points. With each hit, she disrupted the bounty hunter's defensive stance, creating opportunities for follow-up strikes.

The intensity of the barrage escalated as Mei Lan's blows resembled the vigorous scrubbing motion of a diligent maid. Her attacks worked tirelessly to shatter the bounty hunter's defenses and leave him reeling.

The "Cleansing Whirlwind Assault" reached its climax with a devastating finishing move, akin to the final rinsing away of dirt and impurities. Mei Lan's high-impact strike or technique was intended to conclude the barrage with maximum force, leaving no doubt as to the outcome of their battle.

The leader awoke with a start, his head throbbing from the relentless Cleansing Whirlwind Assault. As his vision cleared, he realized that he, along with his incapacitated men, had been moved and arranged around a large piece of cloth. It was set up in a manner akin to a picnic, with an array of snacks and beverages artfully arranged on top of it.

Mei Lan stood beside the makeshift picnic area, her expression as impassive as ever. The bounty hunter's astonishment was shared by his men, who stared at the unusual scene in bewilderment.

With a calm and measured tone, Mei Lan addressed the bounty hunter leader. "I cannot allow you to enter the house and disturb the guest," she explained. "So, I have tried to accommodate you outside."

The bounty hunter leader's confusion was evident.

*"Uhmm, Boss?"* 

*"I haven't seen food like this within our reach such a long time..."*

*"Boss please may we...? You know..."*

Some of his men hesitantly turned to him, seeking permission to partake in the offered snacks. He, too, was uncertain but nodded in agreement.

He looked at the maid for a second before answering.

 "You may eat," he allowed, still trying to comprehend the turn of events.

 The bounty hunters found themselves in a peculiar situation, where their adversary had not only bested them in combat but had also extended a surprising act of courtesy, even in their defeat.

As the bounty hunters began to partake in the snacks and beverages, Mei Lan, in her customary monotone voice, informed them, "Please keep your voices down. We wouldn't want to disturb our guest."

The leader and his men nodded in agreement.

As the bounty hunter leader bit into the meal Mei Lan had prepared, he couldn't help but express his astonishment. *"Dammit... this is delicious..."* he muttered in a mix of frustration and delight.

His men echoed his sentiments, their tears of joy and expressions of satisfaction making it clear that they hadn't enjoyed a meal like this in a long time. Mei Lan continued looking at them, her expression unchanged, but she listened attentively as the leader began to explain their dire situation.

*"We were bounty hunters, from the north,"* he started, his voice tinged with a hint of desperation. "Quite successful too, until that monstrously strong savage arrived in our lands, raiding and pillaging everything in its path. We barely managed to escape before he reached us.Entire lands erradicated, and many left with nowhere to go. Our group has been falling apart ever since."

He took another bite, savoring the flavors, before continuing. *"We caught wind of a possible bounty to claim, the first one since we arrived here, a target that could provide us with a chance to regain some stability. The information led us here, to this estate. We had no idea it was under the protection of such a formidable guardian."*

*"I am grateful for the praise"* said Mei Lan with her monotone voice *"But having you try to claim the bounty set on the guest would disturb our guest, so I'm afraid I cannot allow it."*

*"I know already"* answered the leader. The maid's way of thinking was unreasonably formal and strict.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the bounty hunters finished their meal and prepared to depart, a sense of shame still clung to them, but they couldn't help but bid Mei Lan farewell with a genuine fondness. She had not only defeated them but also extended unexpected kindness, even after their initial intent to disrupt the estate.

Mei Lan, ever the dutiful maid, had even packed them some food for their journey, an act that left the bounty hunters feeling humbled and appreciative. With words of gratitude and newfound respect, they made their way out of the estate, their footsteps lighter than when they had arrived.

Once they were gone, Mei Lan returned to her tasks, but her meticulous duties were interrupted by an unexpected sight. A mysterious figure was seated at the edge of the garden, leisurely enjoying the snacks and tea Mei Lan had prepared before facing the intruders. It was the guest, a tanned man with disheveled black hair that partially obscured his eyes. His clothes were ragged and torn, and a grin full of sharp teeth adorned his face.

The guest, unfazed by Mei Lan's presence, commended her on both her cooking and her adept handling of the situation outside. He spoke with a hint of amusement and admiration, seemingly pleased with the turn of events.

Mei Lan was taken aback by the guest's sudden appearance and his praise. She fell to her knees, a mixture of shock and regret overtaking her. In a soft voice, she muttered, *"I can't believe I failed as a maid."*

The  man regarded Mei Lan with curiosity. *"In what way have you failed, dear maid?"* he asked, genuinely puzzled by her self-assessment.

Mei Lan looked up at him, her expression one of deep concern. *"I should have sensed the assailants from even further away,"* she explained, her voice filled with remorse. *"I should have taken care of them faster so as not to disturb you."*

The guest's enigmatic smile persisted as he listened to Mei Lan's words. He reached for another snack, munching thoughtfully before replying, *"You are a remarkable maid, and your dedication is clear. There was no failure here, only a display of your unwavering commitment to your duties."*

Mei Lan paused for a second before straight up answering *"No."*

*"The hell you mean "no"?"* asked the guest.
