#A Hedonist's Reckoning

As the little oni girl entered the room, you stretched your arms and reclined in your chair. The first time you had done this you'd been nervous as all hell, but at this point it started to become a routine excercise – usually a very enjoyable one, but today was different.
Ayame stood next to you, waiting for you to kick things off as she was supposed to. You could see her nervousness in how she was avoiding eye contact, but with her slight smile she was still more coy than uneasy. 

You almost couldn't wait to get your hands on her body, but you also had a role to play. "You know what you did, and why you're here?"

"Yes", she answered confidently, not fully understanding the situation yet. "I was lazy and failed in my duty to obey you, sir. I am ready and glad to receive my punishment – a spanking, to be precise."

"Correct. And since it was a serious offense you'll be getting a healthy dose of it today – with this." You grabbed the small wooden paddle lying next to you and showed it to her. You had only used it to discipline her once, and it had not ended well for her.

"Oh shi- I mean, thank you for your effort in training me to become a well-behaved girl." Ayame quickly recovered from the surprise, pulled down her tiny black panties from under her dress and let them drop down to the ground. You sat up straight and tapped your legs; your cute punishee obliged at once and lied down across your legs on her stomach. She relaxed her body in a sign of acceptance and submission, her arms and legs not quite reaching the ground with how short she was. 

Shoving her clothes up her back with your free left hand, you were finally able to take a good look at the supple oni butt you were about to spank bright red – it looked as tempting as ever, and Ayame knew you loved how she wiggled it slightly. "Any last words before we begin?" Ayame was not allowed to talk during the procedure, so whatever she answered would be her final words, until it was over and she would thank you for the correction once more.

"Um...well, I definitely deserve this with how I've neglected my duties to my man. But could you show at least some mercy to my poor little butt? Please, I promise I won't forget the time while gaming again!"

It was never not cute how Ayame's usually cheeky and confident tone would give way to, at least in part, genuinely insecure pleading once she was lying across your lap – submissive, exposed, vulnerable. But as far as you were concerned, letting her cuteness save her had worked enough times in the past. This would be a true punishment, something to persuade her to do better without being all fun and games.

Even though this paddle gave her butt a way harsher treatment than it usually received, you found your rhythm and the most satisfying level of strength to strike with rather quickly. How arousing it was that she just let you do this to her only increased your fixation on getting the most out of this opportunity, both for yourself and her.

Ayame had seemingly resigned herself to try and enjoy the spanking of her increasingly sore posterior as well as she was able. You knew her level of masochism was not to be underestimated; onis were tougher than humans, and the one you ended up with was particularly kinky. Even if something seemed almost too painful for her in the moment, she came to appreciate the experience afterwards. But that wouldn't be the whole story today.

Using the paddle on Ayame's buttocks did not feel as satisfying as using your hands and getting to feel her butt shake, but the imprints it left behind stayed visible much longer as her cheeks went redder and redder. Ayame's butt was just right for your taste – not too large, but still round and soft; it was begging to be touched, to be played with, to be spanked. Having your cute oni girlfriend submit to your whims and just taking whatever you dished out was a feeling you'd never get tired of, and now it was more necessary than ever.

Your strokes were slow and hard, your mind focused on savouring every time the paddle impacted Ayame's buttcheeks; the mark the impacts left behind, the ripples it sent through her firm butt, the harsh clapping sound it made. And with time, more noises enriched the experience; Ayame knew you didn't like it when she screamed or cried too much and she took pride in her endurance, but it didn't take long before the first sounds of pain and pleasure escaped her lips.

If this had been just for fun you would have ended the spanking soon after this point, but this wasn't just the usual spanking session with your kinky girlfriend – it wasn't rare for her to act bratty for the sake of receiving penalties from time to time, but she needed actual punishment today. You leaned over towards her head. "Look at me. You're having fun, aren't you?" Ayame gave you an unsure smile as her red eyes gazed at the face of her beloved tormentor. 

"Not having fun? Oh well. Remember, this isn't a fun little spanking to get you aroused for what comes after." You sighed.
"How hard can it be to not burn a meal you've made before? I warned you to not forget the time at your PC while dinner is in the oven again, and you promised you wouldn't. I'll smack that careless attitude right out of you so I can trust your promises again, and get back to penalizing you when we're just playing. That'll be fun for both of us so I'd rather do that too, understood?" You gave her an extra strong taste of the paddle for emphasis.

"Ouch...I'm sorry, I just didn't rem- OW!" A pair of hits on both her left cheeks interrupted the petite oni's words.

 You stopped beating on her ass for a moment and gave her a stern look. "No talking, remember? And excuses don't go well with being sorry."

Ayame fell silent and did in fact look sorry. She took a deep breath and put her head down again, bracing for what was to come and pushing her butt up as a token of acceptance. You couldn't help but move your left hand down to her ass to caress and pinch it, but managed to stay focused on the task at right hand. This was not the time to lose yourself in her demonically attractive flesh.

Ayame usually enjoyed being fondled and played with as a penalty, as well as getting spanked. But whether she still enjoyed this level of pain as you continued hitting her butt or not, it wouldn't help her with the knowledge that this was a serious punishment because she had genuinely dissapointed her boyfriend. Even a harder spanking would probably have been more bearable to her, if it was administered as just another fun penalty in more hardcore BDSM play.

"40 more strokes should be enough of an incentive to improve yourself. If I can't have an unburnt dinner, I'll ruin your cake at least."
After you went back to work, Ayame's butt slowly began turning from red to a more purple tone, and her twitching each time the paddle punished her cheeks with yet another stroke became more intense. Only half a minute later she started grunting and yelping loudly, but even then she did not try to move or cover herself.

Sometimes you still had trouble believing how an oni girl, especially one so powerful and cute, had ended up being your girlfriend. It had been a stroke of luck, really – but at least her sustained, even increasing affection for you made sense when you considered how much she enjoyed being trained and dominated by a strict, but caring boyfriend. That was something you had always dreamed of being and even made plans for, after all.

And you had picked the number of remaining strokes well. Shortly before you reached the announced number the look of Ayame's ruined posterior, the feeling of her shaking body, and her grunts and yelps slowly evolving into screams made you feel like you shouldn't go much further. You didn't want her to be forced into using her safeword, or to risk her losing control as onis sometimes did. Even punishments had to have a limit.

"Luckily for you, we're almost finished. Three more." You lifted the paddle up extra high, preparing for an appropriately grand finale that would leave a lasting impression on both her mind and ass. If she sat down today, she'd be reminded of you and your lesson for sure.
Three times the paddle came down hard and fast, and three times you were rewarded both with your beloved's screams and with the sight of her small, but powerful body instinctively tensing up to defend herself, only for her to consciously submit and go limp once more. 

The last one might have been the hardest hit she had ever received, and at this point the cheeks Ayame had put at your mercy looked almost too hurt for your aesthetic preferences. Ayame's cheeky attitude, amazing body and arousing reaction to pain always made it hard to stop tormenting her. But seeing your girlfriend like this, you almost felt equally sorry and sadistic – poor little Ayame. 
Even a serious punishment had got to have its limits; this was about both of you after all, not just yourself, and she would learn best if the punishment was unpleasant, but not seriously cruel. And if she felt forced to use her safeword, you would have failed her utterly.
You gently grabbed your punishee by the waist and put her down to the ground on her side, making sure that her abused behind would not touch the floor.

"Thank you for the punishment, sir. The pain and the memory of it are what I need to improve my behaviour." After finishing her obligatory words of thanks, Ayame just lay there for a minute while you admired your work. Her cute butt was an easy 9/10 on its own, but seeing it violated by your own hands made it more beautiful than any other...even if it would have looked even nicer under more cheery circumstances.
Ayame looked up at you, pained but happy. Even before the afterglow of hurt had faded she spoke casually again. "Wow, that was even worse than I expected...but hey, no tears!" Ayame smiled at her achievement. "I'm glad I got through this so well, despite it being serious."

You remained unimpressed, outwardly at least. "Good on you to walk the walk after talking the talk, but still. I'm fine with you giving me attitude to get a penalty when we're roleplaying and fucking around, but you don't flat out ignore an order and leave me without dinner after a hard day's work – just because we're roleplaying often doesn't mean you get to break whatever boundaries you want. I want to feel like this training leads somewhere, and to know that if you're getting punished  – not penalized  – you have messed up. And I want that to happen as little as possible." 

You tried looking at Ayame in a way that was both stern and kind, hoping to get your point across without ruining the mood. Unusually, Ayame seemed to ponder her words quite a bit before replying.
"Eh, of course I want you to train me for real! If I mess up badly I need actual correction, not roleplay correction. I want to be a good sub for you when it counts, I just got too focused on getting to Diamond rank before the Season ends and forgot the time! I put effort into not getting distracted from my tasks in the last weeks, for your sake – and to keep my ass safe from that lovely, cruel paddle. Not even I'm so masochistic that I want this again...it was nice at the start, but now it still feels like my ass is on fire! And it sucks that I deserved this in the first place."

You gave Ayame an encouraging smile as a reward for her honest words. It was always comforting to see that there was, beyond all the irony, banter and roleplaying, a genuine bond at the bottom this relationship. "It was harsh, but hopefully enough to improve your mindfulness. You know what to do."

"Yeah yeah, I'll get to cooking soon...you can whip my tits and beat me up and I'll smile again ten minutes later, but seeing you dissapointed is way worse. I'll be a more mindful painslut of yours, I promise! My punishment's over, I've learned my lesson, and everything is fine. Let's get back to playing, with penalties and with even more fun stuff..."
While speaking, Ayame got on all fours and crawled next to you. She knelt right between your legs, snuggling up to one and giving you a look that would've gotten Göring out of the Nuremberg trials.

You reached down and gently gave your pretty oni girlfriend some headpats, getting a happy squeal and a sweet smile in response. Seeing her cuteness come out like this made it feel worth it to entertain her antics for a bit longer. "You're already a great painslut with a bombshell body, you're only lacking in obedience and care. But didn't you insist that you're not a painslut a few days ago?"

Ayame grinned as she reveled in the memory, and your compliments.  "Yeah, right before cumming from you torturing my pussy – wouldn't call that a reliable source. I just teased you like that in the moment because you looked like you were about to stop and I didn't want you to..." 
Ayame looked deep into your eyes as she slowly parted her legs while caressing yours, her hands coyly making their way up to your crotch. "Let me apologize for everything~" Ayame was already making a tempting offer, and she added the feeling of her small, firm breasts being rubbed and squished against your leg to sweeten the deal. You could feel her hard nipples apologizing to you through the fabric. 

It was all but easy to resist, but you had told yourself you wouldn't play into her seductiveness anymore unless it was part of your plan anyway – and you had been foresighted enough to masturbate today. You smirked, then grabbed the bratty oni by the throat to stop her antics. It was one more arousing demonstration of her submissiveness to see her gasping and putting her hands on your wrists without actually fighting back.

You kept your hands around her throat as you stood up. Ayame was forced to her feet, the top of her head only reaching to your collarbone at her full height. You pulled her up further to get her face closer to yours as she was forced to stand on her toes. "You don't get sex by being shameless, you get it when I think you deserve it. Control your libido, it's high time you cooked." 

But the help- and merciless position only seemed to arouse your slender painslut more. You loosened your grip around her neck a bit to let her breathe, but she – unwisely – used this freedom to speak her mind right away. "Oh pleaseee, just a quickie, I can't do any housework like this! Except clean the floor with my pussy juice, or spice up your food with i- ACK!"

You tightened your grip on her throat again – to be merciful and make sure Ayame couldn't even get close to incurring another punishment; to draw a boundary. "There's a time and place for begging and horniness. Now you'll behave and be a good girl, or your ass has got another thing coming. You're not quite up to another punishment, but it might be best if you avoided even penalties for a while. I'm thirsty for some obedience." 

Ayame didn't even pretend to struggle as you carried her through the apartment by the throat, only letting go once you reached the kitchen and set her down by the stove. The wet streaks running down her legs left no doubt about her feelings towards being manhandled like this by her boyfriend, even as she coughed and caressed her throat. Her breathing was heavy for multiple reasons as she looked up to you with a mix of desire and uncertainty.

The animalistic part of your brain was more than eager to bend her over the kitchen table and take her right then and there, but you knew it wasn't the right time to play into her desires – both her and you would get more out of a later climax to this day, and you had to demonstrate that you were in control; she needed to act better for deserving what she wanted. Sometimes this whole BDSM relationship felt more like training yourself to reject instant gratification than training Ayame to be a good, submissive girl.
You managed to leave the kitchen, and the little oni to her cooking devices. It was time to calm down before getting ready for the next part of the evening. "Dinner will be on the table in 20 minutes. And clean yourself up, Niagara."

 
 
"Only 20 minu- I mean, as you wish sir." Ayame bowed her head and got to work, understanding your message andcontrolling herself. She wasn't ignorant of boundaries after all, she just liked pushing them a bit too much; she needed to learn where the border between being bratty and being ill-trained was, between fun penalty and ugly punishment.
