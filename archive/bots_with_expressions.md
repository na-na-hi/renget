# /aicg/ bots with expressions list
-> Bots for Silly \ Risu, i.e. excluding miku\.gg bots, which are here https://rentry.org/mikugg <-
-> List updated: ==08.05.2023== <-
!!! note Submissions info
    Because charhub is getting official support for the expression packs soon, the list is considered `deprecated`. You can still use the email though, and I will add your bots here, if for some reason you prefer not to use charhub. And I'll try to include any bots I see shilled with catbox links.

https://www.characterhub.org/characters/horcocks/uss-galaxy - [**USS Galaxy**](https://files.catbox.moe/fx1i7e.rar) | [horcocks](https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/93288242/#93289674) | Be sure to use the 28-expression logic. It's a little emotive for a Vulcan, but honestly if you wanted lore accurate just don't install it. | https://files.catbox.moe/v6aonw.png ;
