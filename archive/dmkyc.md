    I'm not a geologist. I'm just a worldbuilding autist who likes doing this sort of stuff.
	Everything here I studied over the last two and a half weeks. I will have made mistakes, but hopefully not any major ones.
	If anyone who knows better finds these posts and notices a mistake, please do correct me. I'd be happy to learn to make these maps as accurate as possible.

The above map only shows the major plates of the planet. There likely exists an unknown number of minor plates and micro-plates that are too small to be marked on the map. The existence of these plates can be used to explain away some of the weirder aspects of the /vt/ world's tectonics, as well as some of the mistakes I may have made in the making of this analysis.

I will name each of the major plates. These names do not have to be the official ones, but having them helps with making the discussion on the topic a lot more precise. As for the names, I will name a plate after the nations whose territories exist on the plate or the territories surrounding the plate. Priority is given to nations whose territories comprise a larger area of the plate, with the north-easternmost nation taking priority in the cases where multiple nations that cannot be grouped together share a similar % of a plate's area.

###### Meaning of the symbols
Purple arrow in the middle of a plate shows the direction where that plate is moving.
If the arrow curves around to point at it's own base, the plate is rotating in the direction where the arrow is pointing.
Purple square in the middle of a plate means that the plate is relatively stationary.

Do note that the plates do not move at the same speed. Some plates may move faster than others. I have not marked plate speeds anywhere on the map, but I have made some of the choices under the assumption that some plates move faster than others. 

Red arrows near a plate boundary show you what type of a plate boundary the one in question is.
Arrows that point towards each other mean a Convergent plate boundary; The two plates are moving towards each other.
Arrows that point away from each other mean a Divergent plate boundary; The two plates are moving away from each other.
Arrows that are parallel to each other but point in different directions mean a Transform plate boundary; The two plates are sliding past one another.
No arrows means there is little or no relative movement on that plate boundary, or that I could not figure out reasonably what sort of movement would be happening there.

Dark blue areas drawn in the oceans mean a plausible location for an ocean trench.
Grey areas drawn in the oceans mean a probable location for an ocean ridge.

######Northern Indie Plate
On this plate at the moment of writing are the territories of /kbns/, /wvt/, /corpo/, /nina/, /pyon/, /lig/, /n/, /gorls/, /indie/, /ccu/, and /yah/.
The plate is moving south.

The northern boundary of the plate is unmapped.

The eastern boundary of the plate is a convergent one between a continental and an oceanic plate. The Council Plate is being subducted under the Northern Indie Plate, leading to the formation of orogens on the North-Eastern parts of the Northern Indie Plate, as well as an ocean trench off the coast of the Northern Indie Plate.
Expected events:
1. Earthquakes.
2. Volcanism.
3. Island formation.

The southern boundary of the plate is a convergent one between two mainly continental plates. There is not much subduction happening, but where it is happening, it is the Northern Indie Plate that is being subducted below the Southern Indie Plate. Both plates experience folding and deformation of the continental crust, but Southern Indie plate experiences most of it.
Expected events:
1. Lots of earthquakes.
2. Limited volcanism.
3. Limited island formation.

The western boundary of the plate is a transform one between two oceanic plates.
Expected events:
1. Earthquakes.
