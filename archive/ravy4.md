"Down."

"Please, no...someone will see-!"

"Down."

"But-"

"You know what happens if I have to repeat myself thrice."

The flustered alien girl noticed the coldness in your voice, and quickly got down on all fours to assume her proper place next to the couch you sat on.
 Iofi was usually disciplined, but that she was about to be walked publicly for the first time had overwhelmed her; she was diligent and capable, but still emotional and insecure sometimes.

"Good girl. Come here, it'll be alright."
She closed her eyes and purred as you first scratched her chin just above her white and blue collar and then gave her the tender headpats that always calmed her down.

 You took a moment to admire her small, but bountilful body - Iofi was naked like this more often than not, but you still hadn't grown tired of seeing her in proper posture: Butt perked up, and upper body bent backwards enough to give you a good view of her - for a girl her size - pretty large breasts, dangling below her cute smile and her deep eyes. It might just have been the placebo effect, but you felt like her beauty was out of this world.

"Say, why are you afraid to be seen outside?"

Iofi took a moment to collect her thoughts before answering calmly. 
"You have given me my training, and you provide for me, and love me...I belong to you, love you! You are my one and only master, and I don't want anyone else to see me like you do!" 

"Good answer. But it's how we do things here - everyone walks their pet eventually, as a sign of confidence and mutual trust. Anyone can keep a pet locked up at home, but only a well-behaved and loyal pet can be taken outside without embarassing her master or even running away - our bond has to endure seeing other people, even separation, while keeping up proper appearances or it isn't worth much. Always remember: You are my little Iofi and I am your master, no matter what happens" you said, giving her a kiss on the forehead.

"I understand...I, I will have to overcome my unease for you. I want to make you proud!" She looked you in the eyes and started to smile. 
"You've said I'm impressively far along with my training already, and the world should see that, right? And this body you love so much is sure to impress anyone!"

"You're already great, believe me. And if everything goes well with your further training, few pets of this planet will be able to match you. Sit."
As soon as Iofi had followed your command and brought her torso up you lovingly fondled her breasts, as supple as ever. She had been embarrassed by it in the past, but now she looked more proud than anything.
"And your body will impress, even more than usual. Close your eyes, I've got something for you."

Iofi contained her visible excitement and obeyed. You went to get your presents for her from the closet - a beautiful violet leather leash matching the colour of her eyes, a cute pink bikini top with white dots and an almost provocatively small bikini bottom, green with black stripes. 

Connecting the leash to her collar was a matter of seconds, but you took your time caressing your alien pet while putting her bikini on - one knot on her neck, one on her back, two on her hips - and finally gave her a playful wedgie, making her squeal and giggle in a way you'd never grow tired of hearing.
"There's no need to have you fully exposed on the first walk, so I got you pet fashion we'll both enjoy. Say, what do you think?"

The alien girl opened her eyes and eagerly studied her new accessories.
"They're beautiful...thank you! This almost feels more elegant than sexy, even with how little is covered. I love how the leash goes with my collar, too!"

You grabbed the leash and gave it another look - now that it was on Iofi it looked ten times better than before.
"You're more than my little slutty pet, after all. You're beautiful, and skilled."
The only answer was a playful moan as you pet your pet.

A slight breeze cooled the summer night as you headed through the streets. You didn't allow your thoughts to wander, curious and a bit anxious how Iofi would do - but your worries turned out to be unfounded for now.
"You're doing great - head and butt high, and a confident stride. Say, what do you think?"

Iofi walked just ahead of you, careful to not pull on the leash you held her by. 
"It feels natural by now! You were right in not going easy on me with the training...as you always are."

"Very true - I couldn't let all this potential you have go to waste, after all."

Throughout the last months inside you had trained Iofi's tolerance for discomfort thoroughly, as well as her ability to walk on hands and knees. She had required plenty of treats, pleasure and cuddles after the more intense training sessions, but now it paid off - she kept pace with you easily and showed good form, on paved and unpaved ways.

 Most first walks of other pets you had experienced involved trouble with soreness and skin being dragged over rough ground over and over, but even though she built up less calluses than a human would your little Iofi took it like a champ, as usual.

The streets were mostly empty this late, but just before you reached the park an older man in T-Shirt and Jeans came around a corner and walked towards you. He had headphones on and didn't seem especially interested in someone walking their pet, but you could tell Iofi was tensing up; you gave her leash a slight tug and talked to her in a low voice.
"Don't embarass me now. Look forward, keep walking steadily."

To your relief, Iofi refrained from answering or further signs of insecurity and just did how she was told - she walked and looked forward stoically, as if she had plenty of experience. The man passed by without paying further attention.

You kept walking until you reached the park and the man was out of sight, then stopped and let Iofi crawl next to you. 
"Good job back there! Say, how are you feeling?" you asked as you tenderly ran your fingers through her hair. 

"I felt embarassed, but now I'm feeling...proud? Because I made you proud!" she exclaimed, almost unbecomingly loud - but it warmed your heart too much for you to complain. She had properly recognized the "say" as permission to speak so far and not shown improper behaviour in front of that man, which was the important part.

You gave Iofi a headpat and stroked her cheek. 
"Let's go on then. Maybe we can practice a trick or two." 
Iofi nodded eagerly and strode ahead into the forested part of the park.

It was ten more minutes of a peaceful walk under the stars, until a voice called out to you. 
"Good evening! Haven't seen you around these parts." It was a middle-aged guy in an expensive suit sitting on a bench - and he was smiling, almost grinning at you. You had unfortunately been occupied by looking at your pet's behind and therefore failed to notice him until now. 

You turned in his direction and saw that he also had a pet, sitting next to him him - a tall, pale, well-endowed woman with long black hair wearing shiny black dress. The amounts of jewellry and make-up she wore alongside the dress were over the top and tasteless, but certainly displayed wealth - someone who kitted out their pet like that went outside to really show off. 
You had hoped to avoid encounters with the more prentious or competitive kind of pet owners for now, but it couldn't be helped at this point - best to get it over with quickly.

"Good evening! Indeed, I'm walking my pet for the first time. This is Iofi", you answered. Iofi turned towards them, smiled and wiggled her behind slightly - a bit stiff, but still well within well-mannered territory.

Deliberately bad-mannered was that neither the guy nor his pet girl reacted to Iofi but continued staring at you, even as he spoke again.
"Well, well...I hope you know that this area is traditionally only visited with well-trained pets. Triannara, greet.". 

What a prententious name for a pet, and what a smug attitude. Both Iofi and you tensed up, and she raised her head high standing to your left as the girl, Triannara, greeted as she had been told.

"Good evening, nice to meet you." 
"Bonsoir, ravi de vous rencontrer."
"Buonasera, piacere di conoscerti."
"晚上好，很高兴认识你."

For the moment, you were unsure how to react to such a sudden display of his pet's training. It necessitated a response in how rude it was - you had to show you and Iofi belonged here - but your brain refused to think of one. The arrogant shmuck used the chance to make his next move, in his apparent quest to assert dominance - he threw a tennis ball in a high arc, just towards your right.

 Triannara started running towards you almost instantly. She would have caught the ball in her mouth and knocked you to the side, if not for the fact that you had been a much better trainer than you were a talker - Iofi was not caught offguard. She ran from your left to your right and jumped high, catching the ball in her mouth faster and more elegantly than even you would have expected her to. 

Triannara, to whom such a speed was alien, attempted in vain to avoid a crash - she had already half-commited to her jump and, after Iofi's knee hit her shoulder, fell on her side with a yelp.

Both her master and her were shocked, and you finally came to your senses, wearing the sudden rush of pride in your pet as a smug smile. 
"Iofi, we're leaving. Say goodbye!". 
And goodbye she said, in all the ways she knew.
"Goodbye, have a nice day."
"Selamat tinggal, semoga harimu menyenangkan."
"Wilujeung tepang deui."
"バイバイ、いい一日になるといいね."
"Auf Wiedersehen, schönen Tag noch."

Both master and pet were too embarrassed and shocked to say a single word as you and Iofi walked past them. He was lucky there had been no spectators, but this kind of humiliation was a bitter blow to a prideful person regardless. 
You just hoped Triannara wouldn't suffer too much for her failure; she had shown bad manners, but pets couldn't really be held responsible for the way they had been trained.

Iofi walked the rest of the way with a big smile on her face. You both stayed silent because a look in each other's face sufficed to share the glee you both felt, but you couldn't wait to get home and be able to talk freely either way.

As soon as you were back home and the door was closed behind you, you picked up your beloved pet, lifted her up to your height and hugged her tightly. 
"Amazing, Iofi, amazing! Noone would expect that kind of initiative and skill from a first-timer. What a blowout...and all on your own, too. I should've made you return the greeting as soon as I heard that bitch stop at only 4 languages."

You had rarely seen your Iofi look as lovingly at you as now, and it felt like she was almost about to start crying tears of happiness. 
"Master...hearing that is worth more than you could ever believe! I did well, I did great, I...but no, no it was all you! You gave me all that fetch and fitness training, and allowed me to continue learning languages even beyond what's required of a pet - just because I love languages so much!"

You were still somewhat caught up in doubt as you carried your pet off to the bathroom for a joint shower, and maybe more.
"Yes, but that prick was a better master in the moment."

"No, you're the best master! You're kind, firm, smart...you train me so well, I know what you would want to command! Well...at least in that moment I did."

"I guess that's a good thing to train further, eh? But not tonight..." you whispered, just before your lips met hers.
