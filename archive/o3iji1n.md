The bus jostled along the winding mountain road, each bump causing Inigo to bounce in his seat. He peered out the window, grinning at the snow-capped peaks and lush valleys rolling by. Gigan perched on his shoulder, ears twitching with each jostle. Not long now, Inigo thought, running his fingers along the worn pages of the story book in his lap.

The scenery outside transitioned from rugged wilderness to a quaint green village nestled in the mountains. Inigo grabbed his bag as the bus pulled into the stop, the brakes hissing. He stepped off onto the cobblestone street, inhaling the crisp alpine air. An old farmer in lederhosen led a flock of sheep with glowing quirk sheep down the road, tipping his hat politely as he passed. 

The village pub's doors swung open, a burst of raucous laughter and the scent of bratwurst escaping into the street. Inigo stepped inside, immediately drawing stares from the patrons - grizzled men in coveralls clutching beers. He flashed them a smile as Gigan peeked out from his jacket. "Hey there! Does anyone here speak English?" He was met with blank stares and the resumption of conversations in heavy Swiss-German dialect. Inigo sighed, running a hand through his hair. With some basic German, he managed to purchase a couple of breakfast pretzels. "Danke!"

After consulting his map and taking flight, Inigo found a winding path carved into the mountainside. The trail led to an ancient stone fort nestled against the rocky slope, vines creeping up its walls. As he drew closer, he could make out faded etchings of dragons above the entrance's wooden doors.

"This must be the place, right?"

 Inigo rapped his knuckles against the fort's door. "Hello? Anyone home?"

No answer. He cracked the door open and poked his head inside. The main hall extended before him, tapestries and antique suits of armor lining the walls. Flickering torches bathed the room in a warm orange glow. He stared at the high-vaulted ceilings, the mounted weapons, the larger-than-life portraits of armored knights battling dragons. Gigan swooped ahead, inspecting a particularly ferocious draconic statue. Despite the building's immaculate condition, an air of disuse lingered, like he stumbled into someone's attic.

"Who goes there?" A deep, resonant voice demanded.

Inigo whirled. A cloaked figure towered in the hall's entrance, face obscured by a heavy cowl. 

"Uh...hi there!" Inigo raised his hands disarmingly. "No one answered the door so I just came in."

The figure halted before him.  "Oh? And what do you make of the place, young one?" 

"When I heard of this castle, I thought it'd be more like, you know...the stories. All towering spires, damsel in distress locked away, and whatnot. This place is kinda...dinky, no offense."

"The world has moved on from knights and fairy tales, I'm afraid."

Inigo shrugged, undeterred. He fished an age-worn book from his bag and carefully extracted a loose page, holding it reverently.

"I haven't. And judging by all this?" He swept his arm across the hall's myriad draconian displays. "Neither have you. There's just something magical about the old stories, you know? About the old days with devoted knights. Where good guys and bad guys were obvious in those stories. And love always blooms in the end!"

The hooded figure regarded him carefully. "And why have you come all this way, fanciful one?"

Grinning, Inigo presented the tattered page, an illustration of a fierce dragon looming over a small baker. "I want to know about the legendary chocolatier who saved the kingdom from the dragon! Teach me his recipe for chocolate! My -- my mother once told me you can make it here."

The figure lowered his hood, revealing a tired yet kind face framed by golden curls. Light flickered in his greenish-blue eyes - a mirror of Inigo's. A large winged tome with a dragon's head materialized on his shoulder.

"Very well then, nephew," he rumbled in heavily accented Japanese. The tome let loose a puff of smoke. "It's an old family recipe. Those sweets were always Amelie's favorites."

Inigo beamed, throwing his arms wide into a hug. "Thanks Uncle Moritz! I **really really** need the help!"

####II. Inigo's Apartment

######1 Week Ago


Inigo wiped the sweat from his brow and grinned proudly at the tray of chocolate before him. "Alright! This is the latest batch!"

He glanced over his shoulder at the line of stone-faced yakuza men in crisp black suits, gathered behind him in his small kitchen. Their eyes nervously darted between the chocolates and the piles of burnt, inedible-looking confections already littering the countertops.

"Who wants to try it?" Inigo asked confidently.

The men exchanged apprehensive looks. Finally, one burly enforcer with a pencil-thin mustache gulped and stepped forward. Inigo beamed and held out the truffle. The man gingerly took it between two meaty fingers and popped it into his mouth. 

Three agonizing seconds ticked by. Then the man's eyes went wide, face turning beet red. He clutched at his chest and crumpled to his knees with a pitiful groan. 

"It's.. terrible..."

"It can't be that bad, right?" Inigo scratched his head, glancing at the tablet propped up on the counter, a video tutorial on chocolate-making still playing. "I followed all the directions." Gigan shrugged.

**"DAICHI-SAMA!"** The man cried. With a surprising burst of energy, he whipped out a tanto blade from inside his jacket and raised it high. Pointing the blade to his stomach. "Please allow me to regain my honor for judging your baking so harshly!" The remaining men dropped into frantic dogezas, foreheads pressed to the sticky kitchen floor.

"Hiroshi-san, no!" Inigo facepalmed. "For the hundredth time, no seppuku in my apartment! Just get up, all of you! You can go!"

After watching them leave, Inigo rolled up his sleeves and grabbed a fresh bowl and whisk. 

"All I need is one good batch for the girls! WE GOT THIS, GIGAN! LET'S GO! IKUZO!"

Gigan bobbed up and down, raising a fist defiantly. The kitchen descended into a flurry of furious baking.

####III. Shiketsu Class 1-D


A sleep deprived Inigo swaggered up to Hoge as she was making her way to her desk at the back of the classroom. His signature grin was plastered across his face.

"Coru-chan! I've got somethin' for ya," he said confidently, raising his eyebrows.

Hoge paused and eyed him warily, taking a small step back.

Undeterred, Inigo moved in closer, pressing his hand against the wall behind her. He slowly pulled out a piece of finely crafted chocolate from his pocket.

"It's not White Day yet, but I need you to taste test this," he said with a wink. "Just take a little bite?"

Hoge's eyes went wide behind her glasses. "Ini...we're at school.."

"C'mon, class-rep," Inigo coaxed, leaning in until their faces were inches apart. He extended the chocolate out tantalizingly. 

-> ![I hope no one is staring at us.](https://i.imgur.com/Yufwy6n.png) <-

"Y-you're being reckless.."

"Just one little bite? You're four now, Coru-chan. You should be able to handle solid food."

"Please stop telling people that. I'm not a child."

"I will if you take a bite. For me?"

Hoge felt her face flush as she stared. After a moment's hesitation, she relented. "O-Okay..."

She took the chocolate from his fingers, taking a small nibble. Instantly, her expression contorted as if she'd bitten into a lemon. Her quirk activated, blurring her outline.

"Woah, you didn't like it?" Inigo's cocky grin turned into a look of utter shock.

Hoge shook her blurry head apologetically. "Ini..."

"No no, hold up!" Inigo ran a hand through his messy locks. "I can make better ones, I swear!"

Hoge seemed to regain her composure. "Well, if you'd like some assistance, I have become quite skilled in the art of confectionary."

Inigo flashed her a defeated grin. "Thanks for the offer Mrs. Chocolate Ninja, but I got this covered. The next batch is gonna be perfect! So get ready!"

#####5 Taste Tests Later....

"INI!! IT'S BAD!"

"HOooGe! Come Back!"

Inigo staggered back holding on to his chin. She did zero damage, but watching her run away in panic only proved to him one thing. He shouldn't have added so much black pepper and rosemary. The next batch will be better...

Inigo had been searching high and low for Hoge all day. Rounding a corner, he finally caught a glimpse of Hoge's blurry silhouette up ahead. His eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning.

"Aha! I got you now, Coru-chan!" he yelled, picking up speed into an all-out sprint. "You can't avoid me forever!"

Hoge's hazy form seemed to tense up as he rapidly closed the distance between them. Just as Inigo extended his arms to scoop her up, she suddenly went poof and disappearing in a cloud of smoke.

-> ![My Kunoichi Can't Be This Cute](https://i.imgur.com/enKIUWJ.png) <-

Inigo skidded to a halt, coughing as the smoke cleared to reveal...a simple log lying on the ground. He blinked a few times in confusion until he noticed a small sticker stuck to the center of the log. It depicted Marumaru, Hoge's heroic persona, sticking her tongue out cheekily.

"Oi! No fair using ninja tricks!" Inigo glanced around frantically, but her presence had completely vanished yet again.

"I didn't even know you can do that!"

He frowned, slouching in defeat as he scooped up the log. This was hopeless. At this point he was close to a bad ending. She was gonna avoid him forever. If he wanted to give Hoge the perfect White Day chocolate, he was going to have to take drastic measures.

###IV. Drakkenheim, Switzerland

Inigo let out a long exhale. "And that's the full story, Uncle."

Moritz stroked his golden beard thoughtfully, shaking his head. "Very well then. If making the confection that will win your lady's heart is so important to you, we'll re-create it properly." He rose from his seat, gesturing for Inigo to follow. "But come, this is a matter requiring the utmost focus."

Inigo trailed after his uncle into a cavernous stone kitchen, equipped with an enormous cast-iron oven. The scent of wood smoke and melted chocolate hung richly in the air. Moritz began gathering aged ceramic jars of ingredients from the larder.

"If we're to undertake such an endeavor, you must swear to guard the recipe closely," Moritz stated, fixing Inigo with an intense stare. "This is an art passed down through generations. It cannot fall into impure hands."

"Don't worry, I'm good at keeping secrets," Inigo assured him with a solemn nod. Gigan mimicked the gesture.

Over the next day, Moritz walked his nephew through each painstaking step of the chocolate-making process - grinding the cacao nibs, tempering the melted cocoa butter, aging the rich ganache filling. Inigo watched reverentially, following his uncle's instructions to the letter. Once the final molten chocolates had been poured into their molds, Moritz turned to Inigo with an evaluating look.

"So tell me, now that you're more learned, what errors were you making that rendered your previous attempts so...objectional?"

Inigo grimaced sheepishly. "Well...I got a bit overzealous and tried tweaking the recipe here and there. Adding a few extra ingredients to make it more special, you know?"

Moritz sighed heavily. "That is precisely why your efforts failed so miserably, my boy. The beauty of  chocolate lies in its simplicity - pure, quality ingredients, handled with the utmost care and respect for tradition. Nothing more is required."

"But...that's how it works, right?" Inigo protested. "You've gotta go big, make things grander than grand! How else would I make a lasting impression?"

The older man shook his head, raising a calloused hand. "Do you not see, nephew? Your presence alone, your genuine self honestly presented, is already a remarkable gift. You need not constantly strive to be more than you are."

Inigo looked down, crestfallen. In his heart, he knew his uncle's words rang true. But the fear had always gnawed at him - the fear of not being enough, of being abandoned like...

"I'm just scared she'll leave," he confessed in a small voice. "Scared she'll grow bored of me eventually, just like they all did."

Kaz.. Satoru.. his mother.. his father... even Locke from middle school... They had all drifted away, leaving him behind. This White Day, his first with Hoge, felt monumental. If his gift wasn't spectacular enough...if he failed to match her....would history simply repeat itself?

Doubt creased his face, but Moritz placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

"Look around you, nephew." Inigo glanced about the ancient kitchen, bustling with the mouthwatering aromas of their culinary labors.

Moritz plucked one of the chocolates from its mold and took an appreciative bite, savoring the flavors. A gentle smile played across his weathered features.

"These batches are outstanding because you trusted yourself, rather than over-complicating matters." He fixed Inigo with a warm look. "From what I hear, you are already an extraordinary young man - tender-hearted yet diligent, creative yet humble if not too bold at times. If you simply have faith in yourself, you will be more than enough for your beloved."

Inigo felt the knot of anxiety in his chest. Even if insecurity still flickered within him. He would give Hoge his heart's truth this White Day - nothing more complicated than that. Clasping Moritz's hand, Inigo managed a small, grateful smile. "Thanks, Uncle. I'll remember that. Sorry to cut this visit short. I got a plane to catch."

"Ah, I'm happy to be able to help, nephew."

"OH- one more thing! I noticed ya had a pretty big garden out back."

"Hmm?"

###V. Hoge's Apartment

Hoge turned from her breakfast. The mocking laughter of the calendar pages haunted Hoge as she readied herself for the impending doom. White Day was here, and she could feel the icy tendrils of dread wrapping around her heart.

Her mind raced back to Valentine's Day just a month prior. The countless sleepless nights crafting those confectionery masterpieces had yielded satisfactory results. Yet it led to this... It was Inigo's chance to reciprocate. Or her own crucifixion, she couldn't decide which.

Hoge's fingers trembled as she adjusted her glasses, the reaction becoming more pronounced with each passing minute. She had overheard his boastful claims of preparing the greatest White Day chocolates for her. A fragile flicker of hope desperately wanted to believe, even as the logical side of her brain issued a firm rebuttal. Hoge had been the recipient of his "chocolate making" all month.

She could already envision the lumpy, misshapen horrors awaiting her. Chocolates burnt to an acrid crisp or frozen icicles of cloying sweetness. Flavors so disastrously mismatched that they'd induce synesthesia. Her intestines roiled in preemptive agony.

And yet...Hoge's chest tightened as visions of Inigo's bright, eager grin danced in her mind's eye. The genuine excitement and affection he put into even the smallest romantic gestures. The radiant joy that would undoubtedly beam from him when she accepted his White Day offerings, flaws and all.

A weary sigh escaped Hoge's lips, her shoulders slumping in resignation. For his sake, she was prepared to suffer through another boutique of gastrointestinal distress. To pledge unwavering devotion by allowing those crimes against confectionery into her body. She didn't ask for this burden, and yet...

A ghost of a smile played across Hoge's blurry features as she shouldered her bag, quirk rippling. Somehow, against all odds and reasons, she had ended up hopelessly, irrevocably, attached to the ridiculous boy. She would gladly march into the sweet depths of hell for him. Steeling her gut with a fortifying breath, Hoge strode towards the school gates and her inevitable white chocolate penance. She hadn't thought her high school romance would culminate in such sacrificial sweet suffering...but then again, life was funny that way.

###VI. White Day

"Alright, I'm all set!"

The school day was well underway when Inigo made his move. With a grin, he gave Gigan a subtle nod. The spectral dragon construct shimmered to life, carefully cradling the first of many delicate ikebana arrangements.

Inigo led Gigan towards his first friend in 1-D. It's been almost a year since he first followed her to that cafe totting a bag of cat food. Yui jolted in her seat as Gigan fluttered the flower piece before her. Higanbana intertwined with soft pink sakura blossoms, all arranged to form a cat's paw. The delinquent girl's scowl softened as Inigo dropped a pouch of heart-shaped swiss white chocolate on her desk, as well. 

"Happy White Day, Yui! Hope I'm not getting in the way of someone." He winked.

For Kaylee he made a simple arrangement of sturdy matsu shoots and vibrant ayame. The ikebana is that of a crown. Steadfast strength is what Kaylee gave to everyone in 1-D. He met her at the Shiketsu gym while she rained blows on an unfortunate punching bag. 

"What do you want, Inigo?"

"Kaylee! Here!  It's the guy's turn to give these out. So I thought of you. The irises represent your battle prowess. In Japanese, it's "shobu" for the samurai spirit! The young bamboo represents your eyes. Happy White Day!" Gigan floated a pouch of white chocolate to her. 

The small crowd at the gym all turned to stare.

Inigo made short work of his presents as he made his way to the cafeteria next. Gigan flew across the table dropping his arrangements and pouches of white swiss chocolate. Orochi got an arrangement of refined elegance captured in a twist of white camelia and arusutoromeria coiled like a graceful snake. In hanakotoba, it meant 'waiting' and a 'strong connection'. Ashleigh found herself with 12 stems of blue and gold wisteria. Sally's innocent duality reflected in the pure white daisies nestled among sunny chrysanthemums. The chrystanthemum arranged like a halo around the single white flower. For Chihiro, he chose the resilient spirea complemented by the rare, evocative beauty and purity of a white orchid. 

After lunch, Inigo dropped off the presents for the Clique. Inigo had always admired their confidence in not just themselves but each other. He gave them chocolate with a bright bouquet of suisen (self-esteem) and morning glory (persevering affection and kept promises). May their loves bloom even further! Of course, he dropped some extra chocolate for Edith and left her an extra stem of gardenia.

He caught Tame-chan in the hallway and gave her a small pot with half-bloomed matsurika and violets. For faithful friendships.  She couldn't eat his chocolate, so he handed her a copy of the fairy tale - The Brave Chocolatier and the Dragon. 

And on Rosethorn-sensei's desk, he left the largest arrangement, a selection of roses entwined with red hōrii. Given to those who would get married soon. He hoped.

***
Inigo surveyed his handiwork with a satisfied grin. He gently picked up the last of the ikebana arrangements from the Doki Doki Misteru Room. It was a smaller pot, but the one he felt most proud of - the base was sprigs of ferns and eucalyptus leaves delicately holding up two stems of wasurenagusa entwined with deep crimson, un-bloomed azalea buds.

"They should be in full bloom by the end of the month," he mused aloud. "Just as the school year comes to a close. We'll get to see 'em together, Coru-chan."

Intricate dragonfly and cicada ornaments he had meticulously crafted from wire and translucent paper decorated the pot and the soil around the arrangement. Of course, his White Day gift wouldn't be complete without the customary chocolate. Inigo reached for the heart-shaped pouch, only for Gigan to tap his hand lightly.

He turned to find Hoge hovering uncertainly by the door, anxiety written across her blurring features. As he moved closer, she shrunk back imperceptibly.

"Coru-chan...hey, no need to be nervous! Please don't run away," Inigo cajoled with a lopsided smile. "I uh- well, you know..."

-> ![Happy White Day.](https://i.imgur.com/aDIcyDM.jpeg) <-

"I'll eat it!" Hoge blurted out, eyes closed, hands clenched stiffly at her sides as she marched towards him with rigid determination. Their gazes met, and he proffered the pouch, fingers brushing against hers fleetingly.

"H-Hey now, it's not a big deal if you don't want to," he backpedaled, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. "I just...I wanted to say I'm really sorry about all the chocolate torture I've put ya through!"

Hoge shook her head vigorously, her cowlick swaying with the motion. "I don't mind, but sometimes...Ini, it's too much."

"I know, I know!" Inigo sighed, reaching out to brush her arm. "If you let me stay by your side, I promise no more endless taste tests, okay? I'll start using Chris or Junichi as my guinea pigs instead."

A smile played across Hoge's lips as she seemed to relax minutely. "I can accept this trade."

"Even if it means getting you store-bought chocolate from now on?" Inigo raised an eyebrow teasingly.

Hoge nodded without hesitation. "I can accept that too. But I'll be inspecting the ingredients list thoroughly."

Chuckling, Inigo stepped closer until their foreheads were gently pressed together. Here, in their secluded hideout away from prying eyes, their shared secrets were safeguarded. He simply held her for a lingering moment, soaking in her ethereal presence.

Eventually, Hoge reached out to pluck one of the chocolates from the pouch. She brought it to her lips, nibbling slowly with a hint of trepidation. As the flavor bloomed across her tongue, her eyes fluttered closed in bliss. When they reopened, she smiled.

"It's good," she beamed. Her words were like angels singing!

Radiant pride swelled in Inigo's chest as he grinned back with the brilliance of the noonday sun. "I'm so glad you like it, Coru-chan!"

His expression softened as he drank in her blurry silhouette. Her eyes frightened him in wonderful ways. Suddenly he felt uncharacteristically shy. "Hey...I was thinkin' about another potential trade," he murmured, clearing his throat anxiously when his voice cracked.

Inigo forced himself to meet the warm blur of her gaze steadily. "Nyoro Hoge, would you maybe...trade all your future Valentine's Days with me? For all of my White Days in return?"

A pregnant pause stretched between them as Hoge seemed to consider his proposal thoroughly. Just as Inigo was starting to squirm, she nodded decisively.

"That's an acceptable trade too," she replied, the hint of a smile tingeing her words.

Letting out the breath he'd been holding, Inigo sagged in relief until a teasing smirk curved his lips. "But my White Day chocolate can't possibly be ten times better than your legendary Valentine's masterpieces, right?"

Hoge's laughter drifted through the air like a melodic refrain. "Fufufu - oh Ini, you'll simply have to train hard if you wish to surpass me one day."

Flashing her a roguish wink, Inigo pulled her close and their lips met. "I won't let you down, sensei."
