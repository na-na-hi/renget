Art School Rivalry by anonymous & Mastermind

>Ywn attend art school in an area with a high population of anthros
>You chose this school specifically to explore the differences in art between the species and cultures
>It's fascinating to see just how the differences in biology alone, let alone culture, affect the artistic tastes of the artists
>Humans art generally evolved to have a preference for a rich color palate, fine detail, and meaning hidden behind simile and metaphor
>Canine art, on the other hand, favors bold contrast of lighting, strength and motion, and clear meaning likely due to their comparative lack of color vision (hell, some of them can't even differentiate red and green!) and strength in visualizing motion and in low light
>Each side has their fans and detractors, though it's somewhat rare for a strong appreciation to cross the species line
>Naturally, your own personal style favors the human tradition, plenty of bold colors and double meanings in your works
>Not to brag, but you're one of this year's best talents
>There's one other who stands above the crowd, though, a canine (you're not sure what breed he is and you feel it might be offensive to ask)
>And unfortunately, you've been at each other's throats since you both started here
>Even if there were ten of you, you wouldn't have enough fingers (or toes) to count the number of arguments you've have over the "right" way to make a piece
>Some of his more groanworthy comments include:
>"The entire concept of the 'still life' is emblematic of the issue behind your species' approach. What 'life' can you find in a painting of nothing but stillness? That isn't life, it is STAGNATION, it is DEATH!"
>"Your Battle of the Delaware River is simply a mess, Anon. There's such a thing as too much detail, it's so visually noisy it's like a cacophony, not a symphony."
>"So this is REALLY just a painting of an apple? No other meaning? The stem doesn't represent a hidden Oedipus complex or a phallus, like usual?"
>I mean CHRIST! What a dick! You’re pretty sure he’s never said a single positive thing about your work, which would be FINE since art is SUBJECTIVE, but damn he’s aggressive about it!
>Eventually you complained to your teacher, who spoke with him privately
>He reported back the next day that the canine critic actually did admire your work, “by quite a great deal, Anon! He’s only criticizing it because he wants to see you get even better!”
>Seriously?! What a bold-faced lie!
>So even though you feel this isn’t the right thing to do, your anger gets the better of you, and you return the favor
>He’s quite skilled himself (though you’ll never admit it to him), with sculpting being his main focus as it lets him place emphasis on form, motion, and ignore color, playing to his species’ strengths
>So you begin to comment, rather caustically, in much the same manner as he did to you:
>”Wow! Your THIRTY THIRD statue of Caesanthro! Hmmm? It isn’t him? Dear me, I’m sorry, it’s just that I couldn’t tell at all since they’re all NAKED and with NOTHING IDENTIFIABLE to DIFFERENTIATE THEM.”
>”So, the theme of this painting is ‘lemmings falling off a cliff’? What…? It’s ‘the pack chases a reindeer’?! Oh dear, but the wolves and the prey all look the same, no wonder it looks like a suicide pact rather than a chase!”
>”Very interesting artistic decision to drape this one in ivy. It clashes so heavily with the statues’ native color, I presume it to be a reflection of the character of its creator, belligerent and constantly at odds with everything around it, am I correct?”
>That last one REALLY struck a nerve and the two of you then began to hurl half used cans of oil paint and chisels at each other, prompting your teacher to angrily break the fight up and literally drag the two of you to his office
>After an hour long dressing down of how “this isn’t how true artists learn and grow” and (not incorrectly) stating this is the sort of thing he’d expect from feuding exes, he gave the two of you an ultimatum
>Make nice or get expelled
>And he had a brilliant idea on how to do it
>Since the two of you were so insistent on ‘critiquing’ each other’s works, the two of you were to create pieces mimicking the style of the other so that you could try to see the good in both sides, and if either of you just used it as another excuse to make a potshot, you’d be finished
>And with that, he gave you a deadline, one week, and left the two of you to your devices
>And you hate to admit, but you were having hardcore artist’s block
>Canine art was so alien to you, where to even start? And you couldn’t hold a candle to his ability to sculpt, limiting your options even further
>You wondered, was he having this much trouble…? You hadn’t seen hide nor hair of him since your mutual dressing down…
>So you decided to do something a little stupid
>You picked the lock to his studio when you knew he wouldn’t be there, to see what he was working on
>As the studio lights slowly turned on, you found a pair of statues on the large stage
>A canine and a human at first glance, with the human facing away from the canine. They seemed vaguely familiar
>The human was incredibly finely detailed in a manner you never would have expected from him, but what surprised you even more was the canine
>He was never good at conveying emotion, but this time it was loud and on full display. The human’s expression was solemn and aloof, and the canine appeared wracked with sorrow or yearning, his ears flat and the detail on the stone fur indicating distress, one paw extended towards the human’s back like he was reaching in vain for something dear, the other clutching his heart like he was in pain
>You inspected the human closer, noting that the canine was in white alabaster whereas the human was intricately shaded with pigment
>He had paid an exacting amount of detail to the anatomy
>The subtle musculature and curves of the thigh almost seemed suggestive, and the way the human’s hand snaked towards his femoral crease drew attention to the ivy, which you parted to reveal…
>… that he had committed to complete anatomic accuracy by actually modelling the genitalia. You distinctly noted the subtle mark of pawpads in the pigment on the human’s genitalia, as well, indicating he was either recently working on them in particular, or…
>It was as you were gawking at this discovery that you looked up, only to find it was YOUR face staring back at you coolly, causing you to step back in shock into his workbench on the stage
>On it he had placed pictures of apparent references. It appeared the pose was inspired by a pair of late Roman statues called “the feuding lovers”
>Additionally, he had printed out a picture of your furbook profile, as a reference for your face most likely
>And finally, causing your heart to beat a little faster and your face to turn beet red, it appeared he had printed out almost innumerable pictures of well-endowed human men, and more than just a few of them with said well-endowed human men engaging in hard gay sex
>With canines
>From COLLARED.com
>And just as you read the name of the website, you heard the door to the studio open, causing you to almost have a small heart attack
>You quickly hid yourself behind one of the curtains as none other than the artist himself rounded the corner, looking pensive

fine, I'll try and continue it
>he walks up to his most recent work and circles it, like he's not absolutely sure if it's exactly what he had in mind
>then he stops short as he notices the ivy you left aside. his gaze wanders over to his workbench where his printed pages are all over the place, instead of being neatly stacked. he turns around, sniffing the air once, twice, his expresion shifting from confusion to anger
>oh fuck, can he smell-
>"ANON!!!" he shouts "I KNOW YOU'RE HERE! STOP HIDING!!"
>well, there's no way of hiding from a canine. you slowly move from behind the curtain, unsure of what to do. confront him? apologize? ignore him and just walk out?
>he approaches you furiously "Anon what the hell are you doing here! going through my stuff, what was your plan?? just copying my art? or destroying my work so your own would look better?? how dare you!!" he hits you against the chest in some blind rage, no claws, just a clenched fist
>you've still not come to terms with everything you saw in the past couple of minutes, but you feel you needed to add something to that - one-sided, so far - conversation
>"you're the one to talk! all these months you've been excoriating me and my art in an almost degrading way, mocking me, pulling me to pieces, like I was your arch enemy. but now-" you gesture vaguely in the direction of the freshly crafted statue "you create this! I mean, why is that shaped after me?? don't tell me you just made it for that challenge! and why the hell did you need to print out so much porn? I mean, sure, inspiration for your work is fine, but this is on a completely different level."
>he stops dead in his tracks and his eyes go wide. he looks as if you just slapped him right across the face, his ears turn crimson red, then fold flat against his head. "wha- you saw..? i-it's not what you think-"
