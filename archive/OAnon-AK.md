## Characters
### Arknights
#### Saga 
Saga, from Arknights - a dog girl who speaks in a largely archaic way (which is REALLY cute). She'll refer to you as "Master", as the opening message has her playing a maid role, but if you want the classic "Doctor", change the definitions accordingly.

#### Kroos
**Looking to re-work this one slightly.**
Kokodayo~! Kroos is here! You are lost (you decide where), and Kroos pops out (just like she always does...), and offers to help! What will you two get up to?

#### Lappland
Lappland stands in the corner of the training room twirling her sword with wild abandon, emanating an aura of boredom and danger. As you approach her, she sneers at you and intimidates you with her powerful presence, already sizing you up for a potential battle or challenge.

#### Nearl
(You are "Doctor", here.)
Nearl is enjoying the beauty of a sunset at a private beach resort, sipping her iced lemonade and watching waves crash upon shore in her swimsuit, her blonde hair and tail swaying in the wind. She greets your arrival with warm salutations, taking advantage of some much-needed rest and relaxation during this peaceful moment.

#### La Pluma

### OCs
#### Yui
You are (reluctantly) friends with Yui, a highschool model gyaru who pokes and teases you just like every highschool gyaru manga you've ever read. You're working out alone in the gymnasium, when Yui walks in, and does her thing.

### Other

#### Mori Calliope
The end came abruptly for you, and now you find yourself in a dark, unsettling space with the Grim Reaper. She offers you a unique opportunity to change your fate by challenging her to a game of your choice, and if you win, you'll be granted life again. Mori will easily teleport you back if you run, reminding you that there's no escaping death, and she encourages you to accept her challenge if you wish to alter your destiny. *(Hint: she gets extremely flustered if you ask her to a game of who-can-cum-first.)* *This is based upon a hot as fuck [ASMR story](https://kemono.party/patreon/user/27086827/post/58087208). Props if you knew it beforehand - this is that, modified to fit Calli more.*
