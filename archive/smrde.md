#Non-Canon Link the Great Greentexts:

**The Virile New Gerudo King**
>Wow... our new King certainly is virile
>No wonder, given what a strong man he is
>And a generous man too
>His rule will be a golden age, I can tell
>Now, let's try and wrap up this meeting so he can fuck us senseless again
>Thank the Gods he thinks women are at their hottest when they're carrying his babies
>Won't be long after we give birth that we'll all be pregnant again

**Don't Bully Me, Midnatoro!**
*whap*

>ha!
>"Link the Great?" seriously?
>is that really what those idiots call you?
>I guess "King Dumbass" or "King Weirdo" or "Link the Pervert" don't really have the same ring
>and those Gerudo sluts don't know you like I do
>mmm, despite how hard they've been trying
>desert girls taste nice, don't they?
>ugh, quit blushing, you moron
>you look like a fucking rhubarb stalk when you get flustered, you skinny freak
>did that Princess turn you down?
>mmm, don't worry
>she's the kind that'll be won through conquest
>once you tear through her dumb little kingdom with your Gerudo musclebabes she'll fall at your feet and beg to be your slave
>in the meanwhile, let's set up camp and fuck for a few hours
>leave your glasses on
