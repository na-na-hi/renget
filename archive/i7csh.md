Black Metal bf by anon

>"Dude, they're not gonna let you in like that."
>"The fuck're you talking about?"
>Looking at his attire and equipment, you're not sure where to begin.
>The complete lack of underwear or, really, any clothing?
>The spiked bracelets?
>Or the huge fucking steel axe?
>"When was the last time they allowed a weapon on a concert?" you ask.
>"Oh, quit your bitching, it will be fine!" he grunts and holsters the axe after swinging it around a few times.
>If anything, you hope he's at least not going to swing it when you get there.
>He continues, "I'm telling you, we're not going to some weak-ass, pussy-ass arena to see Green Day or whatever." He rolls his eyes, "Fuckin' hell, that was trite. Made me want a cinnamon latté."
>"But you liked the latté, didn't you?"
>"Y- ye-- No. And shut up, you've taken me there. AND bought me the coffee, so it's your fault," he growls.
>"No, we're going to a TRVE KVLT event, Anon. Shit your eye out if you don't like it. They know no-one is gonna blow up a black metal concert, and it's not ran by a bunch of shitheads who are scared of a dick or tits."
>He puts the axe on the ground and leaves the room to get something. You call into darkness to ask him.
>"What's your definition of kult? Last time it ended up with a rented out boyscout gym burning down during a Bathory concert."
>"So? That was cool."
>You sigh.
>He comes back with a bottle filled with red liquid.
>You look at it. It's not full, but the inside walls are completely stained by the contents. Wine doesn't do that.
>"What the fuck is that?" you ask.
>He shrugs. "Some special sauce for decoration. Just some pig blood."
>"P- PIG BLOOD?"
>"Relax, I'm not gonna stink up the place here. But look what I've also got."
>He produces a spray cap. He probably knows his blood ballistics; splatters, sprays, streaks, pools, drips.
>If anything, it makes for a truly badass make-up.
>"Come on, Anon, it's gonna be awesome!"
>You sigh again, hoping if any of the blood gets on your t-shirt, you'll be able to wash it off. Or your jeans. Or hair.
>"Are you sure you want to go there in this? You look like you're going to see Metallica. Fucking boring."
>You shrug. "You want me to go in there like you?"
>He laughs but nods. "Yeah, why not? You've got form. No chicken legs, no fat pudge. You'd look pretty hot in this."
>"That's pretty gay," you respond.
>"I'm not gay, you fag, I just like your ass. Anyway, if Deathspell Omega does a concert ever, you are not going there like you're going now."
>"Yeah, sure thing, as if anyone who listens to them would ever go outside."
>"Fuck you, Anon."
>"Yeah, fuck you too."
>Both of you laugh. This is his usual banter.
>It took you a while to get used to it, at least until he confessed love towards you with, "I love you, bitch."
>This is gonna be a fun evening.
