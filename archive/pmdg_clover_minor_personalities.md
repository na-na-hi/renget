>Berry has a calm and collected demeanor, even as she battles

####Dewott
>Dewott is Togetic's old partner from when they were both outlaws. He has a deep hatred of pokemon, and his one goal is return back to the human world with Togetic. He genuinely cares about Togetic, but does not care about the lives of anyone would stand in the way of his goal. In battle he's agile, powerful, cocky, and refuses to use pokemon moves or his scalchops until he feels like he absolutely needs to, preferring to use human-styled martial art attacks to deal with his foes. He also loves to shit-talk and taunt his foes, especially if he has the upper hand. 
>Togetic's preparedness also rubbed off on him, and he almost always carries a bag with him full of useful supplies, and despite his crass way of speaking, he's clever enough to set up plans to ambush his targets. While his main goal is "rescuing" Togetic, he might attempt attacks on random Clover Guild members, as he's grown to have a grudge against the guild itself since he feels like they're keeping Togetic away from him.

####Porygon2
Sex: Genderless

>Is a robot, so it does not express emotions.
>Speaks with a synthesized voice.
>Currently recognizes Smith as its owner. Unable to leave the guild building without his permission, though it will idly roam the building freely.
>Accepts most other commands from anybody.
>Speaks using stereotypical, formal "computer lingo". Refers to itself as "THIS UNIT" or "MODEL NAME: (Porygon2)". Frequently introduces itself using the phrase, "THIS UNIT IS AN AUTOMATON UNDER THE OWNERSHIP OF (Smith)." (Feel free to take liberties with its speech tbh)
>Eyes glow white by default. Turn blue when powering on from sleep. Turn yellow when connecting to another device. No glow when Porygon2 is off/in sleep mode.
>Created decades ago by a nameless Doctor, a human who transformed into an Electric-type Pokemon. It will continue to function for many lifetimes after being charged with the Doctor's electricity.
>Internal name is "Terry". Named after the Doctor's son. Only Smith and Furret are aware of this fact.
>Holds a vast wealth of information on Mystery Dungeons, with some limits. First, its knowledge is limited to dungeons on the Grass Continent. Second, not all of its information is 100% accurate, as Porygon2 has been inactive for decades, and the mystery dungeons are prone to shifting and changing. Despite this, it is still useful, and usually mostly accurate in its data.
>Provides general information about dungeons, including number of floors, weather patterns, common ferals, and recommended typings for exploration teams.
>Its time spent exploring dungeons with the Doctor has altered it, somehow. It is now apparently capable of learning from its environments, therefore absorbing new information and adding to its databases. What other effects could the dungeons have had on it...?

####Ampharos
Sex: Male
>A renowned explorer veteran who stopped exploring officially after the death of his partner in a brutal accident that occurred during a dangerous mission. While he's generally calm and jovial on the outside, there's a certain emptiness behind his eyes and a jaded edge to anything he says. Absolutely uncharacteristically terrifying when you get him angry.
>While he doesn't classify himself as an explorer anymore, he still occasionally takes on tasks that he finds during his travels simply out of the goodness in his heart. On one occasion, this was how he found Pikachu by saving her from an Outlaw. Following this, she begs to be his student - and while he denies her, he still visits Capim Town and the Guild every so often to help train her in the art of exploring and controlling her own electric attacks.
>Pikachu reminds him of his dead partner.
>Generally a mysterious guy who's hiding a whole bunch of things.
