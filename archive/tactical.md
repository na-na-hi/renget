(some trackers missing, report in thread if found)

!!! note Cheaper multiplayer keys:

-> ![Prices](https://i.imgur.com/jMVg65Y.jpg) <-

Use a game prices comparison site such as a [DLCompare](https://www.dlcompare.com), [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) or [GG Deals](https://gg.deals/) to find the sweetest deals (listed keys resellers are safe & legit). You can create wishlists, compare historical prices, receive notifications, etc. [And](https://steamdb.info/sales/) [other](https://www.cdkeys.com/) [individual](https://www.greenmangaming.com/) [sites.](https://www.kinguin.net/)

If you prefer buying on Steam directly, wait for the next [Steam](https://steamdb.info/sales/history/) [sales.](https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/)

Epic Games Store also gives out [free games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games/) weekly, which sometimes includes tactical or multiplayer games.

Some games also create free weekends events.

!!! note Steam profile privacy:
Some may be reluctant to share their Steam profile publicly to join online/co-op sessions. You can just [set your public to private.](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/588C-C67D-0251-C276) Another proposed solution by more paranoid anons is to [duplicate a secondary account via the family-sharing feature.](https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing)

## WebMs (recording and encoding)

You want to make some .WebM clips of your gameplay footage to share in the threads?

!!! note Gameplay recording:
If you are a Nvidia user, you can just use the GeForce/ShadowPlay utility built into your video drivers and customize your hotkeys (default should be Alt+Z to enable the recording overlay).
You can also use a third-party screen recording software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

!!! note WebM for Lazies:

How to use [WebM for Lazies](https://argorar.github.io/WebMConverter/) to convert your videos:
>Download and install the [latest build of AviSynth.](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page#Official_builds) ==required==

>Download and unpack the [latest build of WebM for Lazies](https://github.com/argorar/WebMConverter/releases/latest) in folder of your choice (latest version of "WebM for..." tool with VP9 support).

* 1. Launch WebMConverter.exe and open your recorded video in it. `(you may encounter an error message if the built-in updater is blocked by your firewall)`
* 2. Be mindful of the 4MB upload limit.
* 3. In the *Processing* tab, you can easily trim, crop, resize, etc. your footage. It's best to keep footage under 30-60 seconds. You can apply some light cropping and resize to lower resolution to reduce output filesize.
* 4. In the *Encoding* tab, set *Mode* to variable, enable *High quality mode*. Default *CRF* value should be set at around 30. You can try raising the value between 30 and 40 or above to reduce filesize output until you get a result under 4MB (upload limit), but this will also reduce video quality. It's best to reduce resolution rather than cranking up CRF too much. Alternatively, you can set *Mode* to Constant and force *Size limit* to 3.9MB but quality won't be optimal.
* 5. In the *Advanced* tab, tick the VP9/Opus box. You only need to tick it once as it should remember your choice. VP9 offers better quality output for lesser filesizes, but takes longer to encode.
* 6. To make more complex edits, click on the down-arrow next to *Trim* and select *Multiple trim*. Use *Go to* to directly input footage timecode or frame  number.

!!! note /wsg/, Streamable and Audio script:
Alternatively, if your WebM is too long, too large in size, or contains audio, you can quickly upload it to [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/) or [Streamable](https://streamable.com/).
* [/wsg/ board](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/): Post webm in [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/), then link it in /&tg/. 6MB limit, supports audio.
 * [Streamable:](https://streamable.com/) Requires quick account signup. 250MB limit, supports audio.

 You can also share WebMs with external audio on non-audio boards via [this custom userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/402682-4chan-sounds-player) ([Tampermonkey, a script manager for your browser, is required](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=tampermonkey)). Once installed, go in "Tools", "Data" section and input both your WebM video and audio source, then "Create", then "Post". This will upload the audio file to a third-party site and embed in your filename. Plays well with [4chanx.](https://www.4chan-x.net/)

## Games downloads & install guides (essential mods, multiplayer co-op...)

!!! info Dead servers, compatibility issues, too many convoluted mods... Older &tactical classics can be a pain to get running on modern systems, or perhaps you're wondering which mod packs are the most up-to-date and essential for the best experience today. We'll also attempt to streamline the multiplayer process and resurrect some online co-op fun for abandoned classics. Games are singe-player-only unless mentioned otherwise...

### FPS

SP = single-player, MP = multiplayer.
PvP = competitive against other players, PvE = cooperative players against AI.
PvP + PvE if a game/community is primarily-focused on PvP, PvE + PvP if more focused on PvE.
MP games need to be purchased to be played online unless mentioned otherwise.

#### BF2 Project Reality (2015) - MP-only PvP + PvE (free!)

!!! info Free, multiplayer-only tactical mod for Battlefield 2, which inspired Squad and BF3 RM. ==You do NOT  need to own BF2 to play it!== 

!!! info  *Project Reality (PR) is a multiplayer-only modification for Battlefield 2. Project Reality's aim is to create a more realistic combat environment than standard Battlefield 2, and place a greater emphasis on teamwork and cooperation. Most of the aspects of Battlefield 2 that have the capacity to be modified have been tweaked, or completely overhauled, to reflect their real life counterparts, for increased realism. Ballistics have for example also been audited to reflect those of real weapons, including characteristics such as damage, deviation and bullet drop depending on a weapon systems calibre. 100 player dedicated servers with up to 8 man squads. Over 70 maps spanning 5 unique gamemodes. Many additional features such as deployable defences, thermal vision, logistics and many more. Modern warfare & insurgency but also historic battles such as Vietnam, WW2 and Falklands are featured.* `Multiplayer-only or you can play with bots. Free.`

Other features existed as well, including a life-sign tracking device, as well other game items like tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and medkit. A LAW (Lightweight Anti-tank Weapon) could be used, as well as night vision and thermal vision.

!!! note 6. Advanced tips:
Courtesy of anon
>powercrawling
this is how you get your ass to safety while incapped. turn 90 degrees to where you want to move to, lean in that direction, then turn back around 180 degrees and unlean and repeat. leaning is faked by just moving your whole hitbox and tilting your camera, so doing this allows you to go a lot faster than the normal incap crawling speed.
>quickswapping
if you switch weapons while sprinting or jumping, the switch will happen much faster. especially good for heavy weapons with the extra-long switch time like the BFG or vulc, but even small weapons benefit. if you switch to fists during sprinting or jumping, it'll store the quickswap for the next weapon you select after that.
>general movement tech
jumping is really good and should be your main source of speed and method of dodging in a fight. sprinting is niche by comparison, it's more stamina-intensive, slower, and the constant speed is easier for enemies to hit compared to the irregular bursts of jumping. you can crouch while jumping to extend your air time. fist lunges are also very good. lunge the moment before jumping to really fling yourself. lunge, release forward movement, and then jump and you can do a high standing jump with significant forward momentum. lunge, forward jump, then crouch and you get super mario 64 long jumps. try to avoid rolling as well, it has its uses for getting even more burst speed and a midair roll can salvage a jump that would've undershot, but it's disorienting and leaves you unable to act for too long to be good for any part of a fight except leaving it.
>drugs
this isn't exactly tech, but if you're fighting, you want to be stimmed. if you're afraid of overdosing, you can check if you're already stimmed by punching the air. stimmed punching is significantly faster and also thrusts you forward slightly. with more experience, you can identify when a stim wears off by your HP or stamina regen slowing down.
>identifying the difference between being hit by a fireball and being set on fire
you don't have to sit and spin every time an imp fireball hits you, regular fireballs have relatively little heat buildup. only the mage imp's special attacks require you to put yourself out.
>more on drugs
stims give you near infinite stamina, increased health regen, and a boost to strength that overrides the penalty that severe wounding incurs. one stim lasts for about 3-4 minutes, but if you have blues then the duration is reduced to one fifth, and it burns off a lot of those blues in the process.
zerk can get you out of incap instantly and lets you ignore wounding up to a point. if you're zerked and you aren't regenerating to full health, then you're a lot more fucked up than your max HP would suggest. the strength increase from zerk adds a much more significant thrust to your punches compared to stims, which you can use for controlling your enormous jumps. you can chain multiple zerks if you time it just right and inject just before comedown hits. if you're too slow and go into comedown, you'll need to suffer for a bit before you can zerk again, but you don't have to wait out the full comedown. stims are very important for surviving comedown, if you have two stims you'll make it through just fine even if you're badly wounded.
>radsuits and shieldcores
radsuits also provide protection from fire and electric attacks, but get torn by bullets and melee attacks. shieldcores stop bullets and melee attacks dead, but have little effect against fire. use the two together and you can shrug off almost anything for as long as the shield holds out. just be prepared to ditch the radsuit if you're building up too much heat, because it won't protect you forever.
>using frag grenades right
enemies try to run away from live grenades, so just directly throwing them or setting up tripwires for an enemy to walk through usually doesn't work like you want it to. cook before throwing so they don't have time to escape, and rig tripwires to be set off by the monster closet itself, or even set the tripwire and then trigger it yourself. you can also take advantage of the fear to buy yourself a few seconds to get away from a nasty ambush, because enemies want to get away from a live grenade more than they want to kill you. they'll only turn and fight if they have nowhere to run to or if they get far enough away.
>squeezing into super tight spaces
if you crouch before playing dead, when you get up you'll briefly squish down even further, which lets you get into all but the smallest gaps.
>attacking while invisible
most forms of violence will disable the blursphere's cloak, but there's a few loopholes you can take advantage of. you can beat enemies up with distracting strikes (reload with fists) and kicks, you can throw grenades, and you can deploy derps using the derp 555/derp 556 commands. deactivating the blursphere manually gives you a few seconds where you can fire any weapon while still technically invisible. firing a bronto will trigger a slow decloak instead of an instant one due to the damage you take from the recoil.
>using more items from incap
anything that is activated instantly from inventory such as radsuits, shieldcores, summoning talismans, or IED kits can be bound to a key for immediate access even when incapped. robot commands are also fully functional.
>wall jumping
press jump with your back to a wall
if you aren't particularly light you won't really get any vertical benefit out of it, but in certain situations you can use it to climb even higher than normal
i tend to find it primarily useful for getting a horizontal boost near the end of a fall to roll the landing and take less fall damage

#### Rainbow Six 1 & 2 (1998-2001) - SP & MP PvE (free!)

!!! info *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is a pioneering tactical shooter developped by Red Storm Entertainment, based on Tom Clancy's 1998 novel. Players control a fictional international counter-terrorist unit called "Rainbow". Before each mission is a planning stage, during which the player is given a briefing, and then chooses the operatives to be involved in the mission, their weapons, equipment, and uniform/camouflage. During this step, the player pre-establishes orders and waypoints. The planning stage determines elements such as the path the AI-controlled squads follow during the mission and where they will deploy equipment such as flashbangs or door breaching charges. Successful missions often last just minutes, but may require dozens of repetitions and planning changes to account for failures, new plans, and simply faster or more streamlined completion. During gameplay, the player controls only one team member directly, and can see stats for that member and all units on the heads-up display. Teams not under player control follow the orders given to them in the planning stage. The player can take control of any living operative at will, making them the leader. All in-game characters can be wounded or killed in just fractions of a second with only one or two bullets, and any casualties that occur during a mission are permanent.*

#### Receiver 2 (2020) - SP-only

!!! info *Receiver is a single-player-only first-person shooter by Wolfire Games. The game attempts to portray realistic gun mechanics through a unique reloading system, where each step of reloading is assigned a different button. The player scavenges items and audio tapes which reveal the story in a procedurally generated world. If a player dies, they lose all progress and the game is reset with a new randomly-generated level layout, spawn position, and inventory. A core element of the game is how the player fires and reloads the handgun. The gun has to be used in a semi-realistic fashion, meaning that all aspects of reloading the gun have to be enacted individually with different key presses. Rather than finding magazines as seen in most shooters, the player finds cartridges which must be individually loaded into the revolver chambers or pistol magazines. In-game actions mapped to individual key presses include, but are not limited to: removing the magazine from the pistol, inserting a cartridge into a magazine, inserting a magazine into the pistol, pulling back the slide, cocking the hammer, toggling the safety, inspecting the chamber, releasing the slide stop, and spinning the cylinder of the revolver. To emphasize understanding of the firearm, the player's handgun starts in a random condition; the magazine or chamber may be loaded or empty, the slide may be locked or unlocked, and the safety may be on or off.* While the game is meant to be played as a traditional FPS with regular keyboard and mouse, there's also a WIP release-candidate beta branch for VR headsets. `optional VR beta`

The player can issue orders to AI controlled squadmates who serve specific roles, eg. the point man can safely lead the team towards the objective, avoiding any traps and warning the player of enemies in advance, while a combat engineer carries an supply of ammo for the player.*

### TPS

#### Chameleon (2005)

!!! info Chameleon is a PC exclusive 2005 FPS/TPS stealth action game created by Silver Wish Games, the Slovak division of Illusion Softworks (aka 2K Czech, makers of Mafia, Hidden & Dangerous and Vietcong series). It runs on the same engine and had the same development director as Mafia 1. Despite being dubbed in English by professional actors, the game never secured a release outside Eastern Europe. You play as a disgraced CIA agent investigating your parents assassinations. Levels include Ireland IRA farmhouse, Albanian airport, train in Moldavia, police station in Baltimore, Colombian prison Argentinian submarine, Lebanon in the middle of a conflict with Israeli forces, Cuba, Afghanistan... Plenty of cool little features, like being able to holster weapons, and if caught without a gun by the enemy they will try to arrest you instead of blindly opening fire. Typical stealth gadgets (night vision, silencer, lockpick, door camera, etc). Surprisingly decent hybrid Splinter Cell/Hitman clone.

!!! note 2. Modern hardware fixes:
Conflict: DS1 widescreen resolution infos on [PC Gaming Wiki.](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Conflict:_Desert_Storm#Widescreen_resolution) You'll need to edit some values in your registry. In my experience, only the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Pivotal Games\Conflict Desert Storm\Device Settings path changes are taken into account, and the ResolutionIndex values posted on the Wiki didn't work; instead try setting ResolutionIndex at 1, launch the game and see what resolution it's on, set ResolutionIndex at 2 or 3, etc. and keep increasing by 1 until you find your resolution. I got it to run in 1920x1080 with ResolutionIndex set at 10, while 11 worked best for another anon. You may also increase draw distance by setting its registry value to 1, although this will also affect enemies being able to spot you from further away.

Conflict: DS1 high framerate bug fix on [PC Gaming Wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Conflict:_Desert_Storm#Game_runs_too_fast_.2F_Mouse_too_sensitive). There's a bug tied to high framerate where your character gets stuck floating in the air. You'll need to download and install [Guru3D RTSS](https://www.guru3d.com/files-get/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download,16.html), add DesertStorm.exe to it, disable "On-screen display support" and put "Framerate limit" to 60

#### Death to Spies (2007-2009)

!!! info *Death to Spies is a series of third-person stealth games set during WW2.

#### Full Spectrum Warrior (2004-2006)

!!! info *Full Spectrum Warrior is a 2004 real-time tactics video game developed by Pandemic Studio, followed by 2006 sequel Full Spectrum Warrior: Ten Hammers. Full Spectrum Warrior is a squad-based game in which the player issues commands to two fireteams, Alpha and Bravo. Each fireteam has a Team Leader equipped with an M4 carbine. The Team Leaders also carry a GPS receiver, which can be used to locate mission objectives and enemy locations, and a radio for communication with headquarters. The second team member is the Automatic Rifleman, equipped with an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, used to lay suppressive fire on the enemy and assigned to take command if the team leader is shot. The third team member is the Grenadier, equipped with an M4 with an M203 grenade launcher attachment. The last team member is the Rifleman, equipped with an M4 carbine.*

#### Hitman (2000-2022)

!!! info *Set mainly in a third-person perspective, the core objective in each level of the games is to kill the assigned target (usually there are additional targets as an optional bonus). In most cases, Hitman allows the player different options to accomplish this task. Players can perform precise assassinations or slaughter indiscriminately in order to achieve the mission goals; however, the games reward a subtle approach by awarding special weapons or cash bonuses if players earn a favourable rank (usually achievable by eliminating only the assigned target, and without raising the alarm doing so). 47 can wear a variety of disguises (such as repairmen, police officers and waiters) to fool enemies and gain access to restricted areas. The focus of Hitman is not hiding in the shadows from the enemy, but rather blending in amongst them. It is up to the player to initiate violence, since guards do not usually open fire unless provoked.*

Playing as protagonist Sam Fisher, a highly trained agent of a fictional black-ops sub-division within the NSA, dubbed "Third Echelon", the player is encouraged to move through the shadows for concealment whenever possible. The game displays a "light meter" that reflects how visible the player character is to enemies, and night vision and thermal vision goggles to help the player navigate in darkness or smoke/fog, respectively. The light meter functions even when night vision goggles is activated, and it is possible to destroy lights, thus reducing the chances of exposure significantly.*

### RTT (real-time tactics)

!!! info One of the big distinctions between RTT and RTS and is that in RTT you do no base building (or at the very least, very little base building), in contrast to RTS. For example, you could make an argument that the first W40K Dawn of War is an RTS (there's light base building), but Dawn of War 2 is an RTT (the base building was removed entirely).

#### 7.62 High Calibre (2007)

!!! info *7.62 High Calibre is a Russian tactical-action game and sequel to Brigade E5. Similarly to Jagged Alliance, the game is about running a mercenary band in an unstable tropical nation. Everything is completely real-time, with a twist. You can set events at which moment the game can pause, zoom in on the event, show a shortcut and have a popup. Because one or two seconds can literally mean life or death, it's quite handy to be able to hand out orders on the millisecond. Should you for some reason need to do a part of the battle without pausing, the game allows a "Smart Pause Mode", time compression ranging from -7.5x to +7.5x.* `Real-time tactics with pause`

Vanilla 7.62 High Calibre can be buggy but it has a dedicated community still trying to fix and improve it.

There are a lot of mods for it, naming schemes are a bit confusing but to recap:

!!! note 4. 7.62 Hard Life (HLA) + Give Everybody Guns (GEG) `challenging overhaul mod for veteran players`

!!! info *In the original 7.62 High Calibre, the story was streamlined to ease the player into the game and introduce the mechanics and features. You start in a small town and slowly increase your team and abilities to perform increasingly difficult quests. 7.62 Hard Life is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Instead of starting in the town and having the ability to freely sculpt your playthrough and affiliations, it starts you off with the guerrillas deep into the jungle. You don’t even access the Russian criminal quest (the main objective of the game) until much later on. Instead, they obfuscate your task and give your character amnesia, with the story being that you were attacked, your unit was destroyed, you lost all your equipment and money, and you barely survived. Where you start in Hard Life is around 1/3rd of the story in High Calibre with the difficulty spiked right at the start and no handholding. The fact that they strip you of your equipment and money makes things even harder, as you have to equip yourself with whatever is laying around from the dead bodies in the starting sectors and you don’t have enough to hire any mercs to help you out.*

* 7.62 Hard Life: 7.62 Hard Life (HLA) is a fan-made overhaul mod released in 2015 with new story, missions, locations, NPCs, more options and bug fixes... Consider it an unofficial sequel to avoid confusion. Steam offers it as a different game entirely. Advice: play the original for a bit before trying HL. You don't need to do a full playthrough if you don't want to, but at least a dozen hours or so until you get the hang of it.  Stand-alone game, you do ==not== need to have High Calibre installed.

The game is very similar to Rainbow Six's planning phase, though with the added ability of being able to play real time. Meaning, you can either make up a whole plan, press play, and not intervene as your team members do everything in one go - or you can go in with little to no pre-planned route and micro their movements by pausing and unpausing. Good modding scene for it. `Real-time tactics with pause`

### TBT (turn-based tactics)

#### Fallout Tactics (2001)

!!! info Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is a spin-off of the Fallout series of CRPGs. Combat in Fallout Tactics is more complicated than in the previous two CRPG Fallout games. Unlike those, which featured an individual turn-based system, players can choose between real-time and turn-based play via three modes of combat: Continuous Turn-Based (CTB), Individual Turn-Based (ITB), and Squad Turn-Based (STB). In CTB, everyone can act at the same time. ITB is the system used in the original games. STB is a variation of that, where each turn is given to a squad. Other changes include the ability to change stance, modifiers for height, and setting sentry modes, which let characters shoot automatically in CTB upon encountering an enemy. `Turn-based + real time tactics`

The game uses a strategic map screen of Arulco where the player may issue high level strategic orders for their troops, such as travelling or prolonged training.

>Download [Stracciatella mod](https://ja2-stracciatella.github.io/download/)

Wildfire mod: *More or less JA2 with a few more mercs, a few enhancements, and the difficulty cranked up. The maps are different from normal JA2, the miners won't just agree to turn over the income to you, you will need higher leadership and town loyalty, and there are a few more enemies on the maps. On the upside, you can have increased resolution, and a max team size of 10 instead of 6.*  Fan-made mod that later received an official commercial release.

>Download [Jagged Alliance 2 mod/expansion Wildfire via GOG Games](https://gog-games.com/game/jagged_alliance_2_wildfire)

Another mod is 1.13 which adds a lot of stuff but changes the game a bunch, which might be undesirable for a first time. *JA2 1.13 is really more of an upgrade to the base game engine than a total conversion. So while we've added new resolutions, improved AI, weather effects and new items, we have left the original maps and quests intact. 1.13 has been structured in such a way that it can be used as a baseline for creating new mods.*

Each character has a role such as medic, sniper, scout, grenadier, soldier or engineer, with different advantages and liabilities in battle. The game features a remarkably advanced physics model.

### FPS: &tactical-adjacent

!!! info Other FPS games that include &tactical operator-flavor but may lack the depth, features or relevance of other entries in the genre:

[~~[REDACTED 3]~~ + RTT/CQB mods](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arma+3+tactical+mod+rtt+gameplay): While the game belongs on another general, it's worth mentioning there are single-player mods that can turn it into a hybrid FPS/RTT experience or closer to classic Rainbow 6 with focus on squad-based commands, waypoints and map planning, CQB room clearing, etc. [C2 Command & Control mod](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arma+3+c2+mod+gameplay) features: Full Spectrum Warrior-like 3D environmental HUD, radial menu, map planning, Door Kickers-style Go-codes, etc. Since it doesn't seem to get updated anymore, there are also alternative similar-purposes mods, such as [DCE mod](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arma+3+drongo+command+enhancement) and [AI1CM](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=arma+3+all+in+one+command+menu).

[Brothers in Arms](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brother+in+arms+gameplay): Squad-based, WW2 [Download](https://gog-games.com/search/Brothers%20in%20Arms)

[Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=counter+strike+condition+zero+deleted+scenes+gameplay): There is a somewhat obscure single-player campaign spin-off for Counter-Strike, that Valve initially commissioned but never fully finished, and released as "Deleted Scenes". It's a series of 18 unconnected scripted missions, consisting mostly of linear shooting but also with occasional stealth segments, puzzles and boss fights. While team mates or squad members are occasionally present, most of the game is played as a lone wolf in various anti-terrorists scenarios such as bomb disposal or hostage rescue. Equipment for some missions includes NVG, tactical shield, snake cam, etc.

[Escape from Tarkov](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tarkov+single+player+gameplay): While the base game is multiplayer-only, perhaps also worth mentioning that there are mods attempting to turn the game into a single-player experience, such as [SPT AKI](https://www.sp-tarkov.com/), although it seems to be currently limited to replicating the online modes with tweaked AI bots. See [their mods page](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/?pageNo=1&sortField=downloads&sortOrder=DESC) for further enhancements, such as Fin's AI Tweaks (FAIT).

[SAS: Secure Tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=SAS+secure+tomorrow+gameplay): This is a one-hour long tactically-flavored linear FPS developed by budget shovelware specialists City Interactive, where you play as a SAS operator followed by 2 squad mates. What's notable about it is it's using the same engine as FEAR designed for very dynamic gunplay, also reusing its slow-motion bullet-time feature for flashbang entries. Only worth experiencing if you are curious and have one hour to waste. [Download (links in description)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ln7YDL018o)

[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon & Rainbow Six series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tom+clancy+gameplay): While we have sections for the original classics, also worth mentioning that these series have many sequels/spin-offs/differences between PC & console releases/console exclusives, etc. that, while diluting the core gameplay to appeal to wider audiences, may still be deemed more-or-less tactical-flavored and worth checking out... Worth mentioning: [A first-person mod for Wildlands.](https://www.nexusmods.com/ghostreconwildlands/mods/20)

### FPS: tactical-horror-scifi-etc. hybrids

!!! info Some games worth mentioning that can be deemed tactical or tactical-adjacent, but with hybrid gameplay and/or horror/sci-fi/etc. themes/settings (a subgenre popular for some /&tg/ posters).

[Ashes 2063](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ashes+2063+gameplay): As mentioned in the [Hideous Destructor section](https://rentry.org/tactical#hideous-destructor-2007), Ashes 2063 is an immersive and atmospheric post-apocalyptic stand-alone full conversion mod for DOOM, in the style of STALKER, Fallout and Metro 2033, with side-quests, NPCs, non-linear hubs, etc. and an 80's John Carpenter-inspired soundtrack. It can also be used as a mapset (but not to play the main story modes) in Hideous Destructor. [(Review)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6WY3XqsArM)

[Brigand: Oaxaca](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Brigand+Oaxaca+gameplay): *Brigand: Oaxaca is a highly difficult post-apocalyptic RPG/FPS set in Mexico. Emphasis is on challenge, a branching story with multiple endings, and total freedom of action (kill friendly characters, rob stores, jump across roofs, etc.). The world of Brigand: Oaxaca by Brian Lancaster, is a unique one. It’s a post-apocalyptic world filled with ghouls, demons, ninjas and diseased animals. And on top of that, there are rival human factions skirmishing over control of the land. What makes the world feel even stronger is the immersive sim aspect of the game. Similar to games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, a roughly 20-hour RPG with guns, it features a solid, intrigue-filled narrative involving the various factions. You can increase or decrease your standing with factions depending on whether you take hostile actions towards them or not. Killing NPCs, stealing and quest-related decisions affect faction standing. This affects your ability to trade with or talk to certain NPCs. If you eventually became hostile toward a faction, they’ll shoot you on site.* [(Review)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G3OV3eoORI&t=478s)

[Hunt: Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hunt+showdown+gameplay): *Multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Crytek. Set in Louisiana in 1895, it is a co-operative game combining PvE and PvP elements. The player assumes the role of a bounty hunter who must kill a mythical monster in order to claim the bounty and survive long enough to reach an extraction point. In "Bounty Hunt" mode, the player hunts down one or two of the game's 4 bosses to claim a bounty. Players can work on their own or with up to two other players to find clues about the monster's location in the three maps. Each map functions as a medium-sized open world filled with other environmental dangers and enemies. As the player collects more clues, the location of the monster's lair is narrowed down. Old guns porn.* `Multiplayer-only but you can play PvP mode solo`

[No More Room In Hell](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=no+more+room+in+hell+gameplay): Co-op-oriented zombie survival FPS made on the Source engine. Free on Steam. `Multiplayer PvE co-op`

[STALKER](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=STALKER+gameplay): Single-player FPS trilogy with hybrid RPG elements and a post-apocalyptic setting, with military factions, realistic gun porn, tense gunfights, complex world systems, etc. There's also free stand-alone mod Anomaly which combines the maps from the three main games and adds a lot more content and realism-oriented features. Recommended that you do not play Anomaly if you haven't played the original trilogy first.

[Underhell](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=underhell+gameplay): Free Source mod made by a dev who later joined the Insurgency team. You play as a SWAT officer leading a team into a hostage-rescue situation. But the story turns into zombie outbreak and spooky house exploration.

### RTT (real-time tactics)

!!! info One of the big distinctions between RTT and RTS and is that in RTT you do no base building (or at the very least, very little base building), in contrast to RTS. None of the games featured in the list are RTS to my knowledge. For example, you could make an argument that the first W40K Dawn of War is an RTS (there's light base building), but Dawn of War 2 is an RTT (the base building was removed entirely). 

!!! info "With pause" here means to "game can be controlled while paused, orders can be issued, etc." Of course (almost) any game can be paused, but this refers to the ability to issue commands while in paused state until you unpause.

[7.62 High Calibre](https://rentry.org/tactical#762-high-calibre-2007): This is what's called "Real time with pause" (or "RTT/wP"). There's nothing turn-based about the game, because it uses actual seconds and miliseconds as the time unit. If you want to fetch something from your pockets, that's X amount of seconds. You can pause the game at any time, you can slow-down (or speed up) time, and you can configure the game to pause on certain key moments so you don't have to catch everything yourself (for example, you can make it so the game auto-pauses when an enemy is spotted). The game itself is about running a mercenary band in an unstable tropical nation. [see more about 7.62 High Calibre here](https://rentry.org/tactical#762-high-calibre-2007) `RTT`

[Blitzkrieg: see download section](https://rentry.org/tactical#blitzkrieg-sudden-strike-stalingrad-2000-2017) `RTT`

[Brigade E5: New Jagged Union](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brigade+e3+jagged+union+gameplay): Earlier title to 7.62 High Calibre, same concepts should apply. The name is a clue that the devs really wanted to make a Jagged Alliance game. Big difference is it had a multiplayer mode. However you can play the multiplayer scenarios offline with bots. They took the offline with bots approach and used that for an Russian-only expansion to 7,62 High Calibre called 7,62 Reloaded. Missions there are static and there is no open world, didn't sell well but the maps were ported from it to the major 7,62 mods like Blue Sun Mod or Hard Life. `RTT`

[Brigador](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=brigador+gameplay): Real-time tactics. You can pilot mechs, power suits, tanks, bikes, agravs, etc and wreck havoc. Premise is you're on a backwater colony world whose dictator has just been assassinated, and a corporate invasion force wants to land and take over. However, there are orbital guns defending the planet, and they would make the invasion very costly. So they hire dissidents planet-side that are willing to backstab their former countrymen in exchange for a big fat paycheck. You're one of those traitors that take the contract. There's 3 factions - Loyalists (former dictator's semi-professional army), Corvids (rebels who opposed the dictator), and Spacers (highly technologically advanced third party that conducts business with the colony but otherwise lives in spess). One very important thing to note here is that you should change the controls when you first boot up the game. In the current version, they default to emulate a "twin stick shooter" style (Absolute), but the game absolutely wants you to use tank controls "Relative" because there's directional damage. `RTT`

[Call to Arms](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=call+to+arms+gates+hell+gameplay): Real time tactics, though it's important to make a distinction. CtA is the base game, and apparently is kind of arcadey unless modded (Warfighter), so what people often mean when they talk about it is its DLC, Gates of Hell. That one is set in WW2 and is much more fleshed out and similar to the Men of War series. `RTT`

[Close Combat](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Close+Combat%22+game): [A decades-old series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Combat_(series)) of wargames with real-time tactics elements; mostly  WW2 settings but some of the games were designed as military training tools for US Marines. Download [Close Combat titles via GOG Games](https://gog-games.com/search/Close%20Combat) `RTT`

[Commandos: see download section](https://rentry.org/tactical#commandos-1998-2003) `RTT`

[Ground Control](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ground+control+gameplay): Real-time tactics, futuristic sci-fi/space setting. `RTT`

[Gunner HEAT PC!](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gunner+heat+pc+gameplay): Real-time tactics with tanks. `RTT`

[Joint Task Force](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=joint+task+force+gameplay): Real-time tactics. `RTT`

[Marauder, also known as Man of Prey](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=marauder+man+of+prey+gameplay): Real-time tactics. Same devs and same engine as Brigade E5 and 7.62 High Calibre, but in a dystopian Soviet setting similar to STALKER. `RTT`

[MechCommander](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MechCommander+1998+gameplay): 1998 RTT set in the Battletech universe. Has a 2001 sequel. `RTT`

[Mechwarrior series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mechwarrior+gameplay): Real-time tactics. You pilot the mechs from the BATTLETECH tabletop setting. They're usually played from a first person perspective but aren't quite FPS. You're actually pilots/grunts here that you control from above in HBS' Battletech game in an earlier post. The skill difference between them varies a lot, and they're piloting ludicrously expensive machines of war so comparing them to some conscript grunt infantryman in a colony is probably not fair. They have a lot of nuance to how mechs are piloted, with controls bordering on sim territory but still being accessible. `RTT`

[Men of War](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=men+of+war+gameplay): Real-time tactics. It also has pause. Takes place in WW2, and it has a big modding scene that can turn it into many different settings. `RTT`

[No Plan B](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=no+plan+b+gameplay): Similar to Door Kickers 2, difference is there is no direct control once the mission starts. Here the only playstyle is single plan. You draw up your moves, then your guys execute. This is a weird one to categorize. Maybe RTT? But it's """real time""". `RTT`

[Partisans 1941](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=partisans+1941+gameplay): Real-time tactics in WW2. `RTT`

[Project Zomboid](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=project+zomboid+gameplay): Zombie survival sim, similar to/inspired by Cataclysm, but with real-time action. Can be fairly tactical with mods that add gear, etc. so kinda RTT-ish? `RTT, zombie/horror survival`

[Running with Rifles](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=running+with+rifles+gameplay): RTT, uses voxels. `RTT`

[Shadow Tactics](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shadow+tactics+gameplay): Real-time tactics. Commandos/Desperados clone set in feudal Japan with stealth elements and samurai/ninja characters. `RTT`

[Syrian Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=syrian+warfare+gameplay): Vatnik Real-time tactics? Unsure if RTT or RTS. `RTT`

[Thunder Tier One](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=thunder+tier+one+gameplay): Real-time tactics, squad-based. You play as a team of elite operators in the 90's after the fall of the USSR. You can play solo but best experienced in co-op multiplayer. `RTT`

[WARNO](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=WARNO+gameplay):  Sequel to Wargame series `RTT`

[World in Conflic](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=world+in+conflict+gameplay)t: Real-time tactics. `RTT`

### TBT (turn-based tactics)

[Alfa Antiterror](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alfa+antiterror+gameplay): Purely a turn-based tactics game. Has a "replay turn" feature where you can watch the events that happened in the previous turn in real time, similar to Frozen Synapse. `TBT`

[Battle Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=battle+brothers+gameplay): Turn-based tactics game where you manage a mercenary company in a dark fantasy world. A little bit of real-time with pause on the overworld as you move around the map, but it's minor (think like Mount & Blade overworld). `TBT`

[Battletech](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=battletech+gameplay): Turn-based tactics game set in the tabletop universe of BATTLETECH with big (and little) stompy robots. Similarly to nuCOM (when people say nuCOM or FiraxisCOM, they're talking about the reboot series from Firaxis), you have a strategy layer back at your ship. Good mods support. `TBT`

[Breach & Clear](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=breach+and+clear+gameplay): Turn-based tactics. `TBT`

[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cataclysm+dark+days+ahead+gameplay): This is a free open-source turn-based roguelike, but can be lumped in with TBT since it's also tactical. [Website](https://cataclysmdda.org/) `TBT, zombie/horror survival`

[Frozen Synapse](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frozen+synapse+gameplay): Very interesting approach on turn-based tactics. The turns are *simultaneous*, and you get to test your plan against what you think your enemy is going to do by moving their units for them and previewing the results. There is no RNG involved, the rules for combat are deterministic. The sequel, which took a lot of inspiration from X-COM Apocalypse, flopped hard because of a rushed release. `TBT`

[Hard West](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hard+west+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, takes inspirations from XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Wild west setting but with supernatural elements,. Includes themes such as bank robberies, lynching and the gold rush but also creatures such as demons, ghosts and undead gunslinger. Sequel released in 2022. `TBT, wild west setting`

[Into the Breach](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=into+the+breach+gameplay): Turn-based tactics. `TBT`

[Invisible Inc](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=invisible+inc+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, inspired by X-COM, with a big focus on stealth and espionage. You're directing agents to infiltrate corporations. `TBT`

[Jagged Alliance 2](https://rentry.org/tactical#jagged-alliance-2-1999): Turn-based tactics. You control a mercenary band in an unstable tropical country. Heavily recommend using Stracciatella mod. It adds cross-platform, improves stability, fixes bugs and provides a stable platform for mods. Another mod is 1.13 which adds a lot of stuff but changes the game a bunch, which might be undesirable for a first time. [see more about Jagged Alliance 2 here](https://rentry.org/tactical#jagged-alliance-2-1999) `TBT`

[MegaMek](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=MegaMek+gameplay): MegaMek is a free TBT in the Battletech universe, includes all the tabletop rules. *The MegaMek suite of programs allow you to play out tactical turn-based battles and military campaigns in the BattleTech Universe, with tanks, infantry, battle armor, aerospace fighters, WarShips, and most importantly, the mighty BattleMech. The programs provide a modern, computerized version of the BattleTech tabletop game, as well as a variety of features for running campaigns and customizing units.* [Website](https://megamek.org/) `TBT`

[Mobius Front '83](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mobius+front+83+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, by Zachtronics who usually does puzzle games. `TBT`

[Phantom Doctrine](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=phantom+doctrine+gameplay): Turn based tactics. Set in 1983, Phantom Doctrine takes place in an alternative Cold War and is inspired by classic spy films and conspiracy theories. The game is divided between global strategy management elements, intelligence analysis, and tactical missions. `TBT`

[Phoenix Point](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=phoenix+point+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, lead designer was Julian Gollop who co-designed the original X-COM. Unfortunately PP kinda sucked. `TBT`

[Silent Storm: see download section](https://rentry.org/tactical#silent-storm-2003-2005) `TBT`

[Tactical Breach Wizards](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tactical+breach+wizards+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, has similarities with Frozen Synapse in the "preview turn" mechanic. `TBT`

[Troubleshooter](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Troubleshooter+gameplay):  Turn-based tactics. Korean XCOM `TBT`

[XCOM series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=XCOM+gameplay): Turn-based tactics. [see X-COM: UFO Defense here](https://rentry.org/tactical#x-com-ufo-defense-1994) `TBT`

[Xenonauts](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Xenonauts+gameplay): Turn-based tactics, inspired by the original XCOM. `TBT`

### RTT/TBT hybrids & others

[DEFCON](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=defcon+gameplay): It seems we *DO* have an RTS here, in a loose sense. It's a game about nuclear annihilation. The tagline is "Everybody Dies". The idea is you pick a block of nations, you hand place key buildings like radars, silos, hangars, etc. in your territory, and then you wait as the DEFCON level slowly raises... The game has pause. It's a good little game, with amazing soundscapes, and extremely depressing. [Download via GOG Games](https://gog-games.com/game/defcon) `RTS?`

[Fallout Tactics: see download section](https://rentry.org/tactical#fallout-tactics-2001) `RTT + TBT hybrid`

[Foxhole](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=foxhole+gameplay): Tricky to categorize. It's a massively-multiplayer game, where you only control your character. Wiki classifies it as real time strategy, but the base building that takes place is done by players. `RTS/RTT`

[Phantom Brigade](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=phantom+brigade+gameplay): Hybrid of turn-based and real-time tactics with mechs. `TBT + RTT`
