(some trackers missing, report in thread if found)

!!! note Cheaper multiplayer keys:

-> ![Prices](https://i.imgur.com/jMVg65Y.jpg) <-

Use a game prices comparison site such as a [DLCompare](https://www.dlcompare.com), [IsThereAnyDeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/) or [GG Deals](https://gg.deals/) to find the sweetest deals (listed keys resellers are safe & legit). You can create wishlists, compare historical prices, receive notifications, etc. [And](https://steamdb.info/sales/) [other](https://www.cdkeys.com/) [individual](https://www.greenmangaming.com/) [sites.](https://www.kinguin.net/)

If you prefer buying on Steam directly, wait for the next [Steam](https://steamdb.info/sales/history/) [sales.](https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/)

Epic Games Store also gives out [free games](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games/) weekly, which sometimes includes tactical or multiplayer games.

Some games also create free weekends events.

!!! note Steam profile privacy:
Some may be reluctant to share their Steam profile publicly to join online/co-op sessions. You can just [set your public to private.](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/588C-C67D-0251-C276) Another proposed solution by more paranoid anons is to [duplicate a secondary account via the family-sharing feature.](https://store.steampowered.com/promotion/familysharing)

## WebMs (recording and encoding)

You want to make some .WebM clips of your gameplay footage to share in the threads?

!!! note Gameplay recording:
If you are a Nvidia user, you can just use the GeForce/ShadowPlay utility built into your video drivers and customize your hotkeys (default should be Alt+Z to enable the recording overlay).
You can also use a third-party screen recording software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).

!!! note WebM for Lazies:

How to use [WebM for Lazies](https://argorar.github.io/WebMConverter/) to convert your videos:
>Download and install the [latest build of AviSynth.](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page#Official_builds) ==required==

>Download and unpack the [latest build of WebM for Lazies](https://github.com/argorar/WebMConverter/releases/latest) in folder of your choice (latest version of "WebM for..." tool with VP9 support).

* 1. Launch WebMConverter.exe and open your recorded video in it. `(you may encounter an error message if the built-in updater is blocked by your firewall)`
* 2. Be mindful of the 4MB upload limit.
* 3. In the *Processing* tab, you can easily trim, crop, resize, etc. your footage. It's best to keep footage under 30-60 seconds. You can apply some light cropping and resize to lower resolution to reduce output filesize.
* 4. In the *Encoding* tab, set *Mode* to variable, enable *High quality mode*. Default *CRF* value should be set at around 30. You can try raising the value between 30 and 40 or above to reduce filesize output until you get a result under 4MB (upload limit), but this will also reduce video quality. It's best to reduce resolution rather than cranking up CRF too much. Alternatively, you can set *Mode* to Constant and force *Size limit* to 3.9MB but quality won't be optimal.
* 5. In the *Advanced* tab, tick the VP9/Opus box. You only need to tick it once as it should remember your choice. VP9 offers better quality output for lesser filesizes, but takes longer to encode.
* 6. To make more complex edits, click on the down-arrow next to *Trim* and select *Multiple trim*. Use *Go to* to directly input footage timecode or frame  number.

!!! note /wsg/, Streamable and Audio script:
Alternatively, if your WebM is too long, too large in size, or contains audio, you can quickly upload it to [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/) or [Streamable](https://streamable.com/).
* [/wsg/ board](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/): Post webm in [/wsg/](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/), then link it in /&tg/. 6MB limit, supports audio.
 * [Streamable:](https://streamable.com/) Requires quick account signup. 250MB limit, supports audio.

 You can also share WebMs with external audio on non-audio boards via [this custom userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/402682-4chan-sounds-player) ([Tampermonkey, a script manager for your browser, is required](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=tampermonkey)). Once installed, go in "Tools", "Data" section and input both your WebM video and audio source, then "Create", then "Post". This will upload the audio file to a third-party site and embed in your filename. Plays well with [4chanx.](https://www.4chan-x.net/)

## Games downloads & install guides (essential mods, multiplayer co-op...)

!!! info Dead servers, compatibility issues, too many convoluted mods... Older &tactical classics can be a pain to get running on modern systems, or perhaps you're wondering which mod packs are the most up-to-date and essential for the best experience today. We'll also attempt to streamline the multiplayer process and resurrect some online co-op fun for abandoned classics. Games are singe-player-only unless mentioned otherwise...

### FPS

SP = single-player, MP = multiplayer.
PvP = competitive against other players, PvE = cooperative players against AI.
PvP + PvE if a game/community is primarily-focused on PvP, PvE + PvP if more focused on PvE.
MP games need to be purchased to be played online unless mentioned otherwise.

#### BF2 Project Reality (2015) - MP-only PvP + PvE (free!)

!!! info Free, multiplayer-only tactical mod for Battlefield 2, which inspired Squad and BF3 RM. ==You do NOT  need to own BF2 to play it!== 

!!! info  *Project Reality (PR) is a multiplayer-only modification for Battlefield 2. Project Reality's aim is to create a more realistic combat environment than standard Battlefield 2, and place a greater emphasis on teamwork and cooperation. Most of the aspects of Battlefield 2 that have the capacity to be modified have been tweaked, or completely overhauled, to reflect their real life counterparts, for increased realism. Ballistics have for example also been audited to reflect those of real weapons, including characteristics such as damage, deviation and bullet drop depending on a weapon systems calibre. 100 player dedicated servers with up to 8 man squads. Over 70 maps spanning 5 unique gamemodes. Many additional features such as deployable defences, thermal vision, logistics and many more. Modern warfare & insurgency but also historic battles such as Vietnam, WW2 and Falklands are featured.* `Multiplayer-only or you can play with bots. Free.`
