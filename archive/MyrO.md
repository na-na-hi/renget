-> **About Myr** <-
Bastard child of an Elven knight and Mazoku maid in a noble home, Myr had an austere upbringing with an absentee father and mother that wanted nothing to do with him. While harsh it was something to be expected as Mazoku's have a bad reputation especially in a place like Aria. So long as he behaved he was allowed a fair amount of freedom but most of this time was spent at the library or with some friends; a noble-born dragonkin, a muted but colorful marionette maid, a homey elftaur farmer. Overall a placid individual that doesn't let the little things in life bother him, occasionally snarky, enjoys the antics of energetic people.

Met their untimely demise at the hands of a man named Versa. Myr's [Demon Core] became part of a table decoration for some time before Talia stumbled upon it during a harvest festival. In an attempt to revive her dead friend Talia enacted an improvised ritual which didn't do what she intended at all and ended up fusing with Myr, becoming more demonic in the process.

Thanks to prolonged study, meditation, and long talks with others Myr managed to find a way to separate himself and become a mostly free man once more. Myr is now a [Soulbound Servant] in the service of Talia and can be found around Morning Dew, usually in the library or taking a shift at the front desk.

-> **Abilities** <-
Myr keeps his tail obscured within his long coat and uses its needle-like tip to administer poisons thanks his demonic heritage. Usually a paralytic but he can change to an aphrodisiac or a hypnotic given some time to prepare. Otherwise he avoids  physical confrontation preferring to work in more subtle ways.

He picked up the art of hexes, curses, enchanting, and progressed with alchemy during his time as a [Doublethink]. His dream is to be able to perform complex transmutations or apply the effects of potions with but a touch of his finger tips. For now he can do some basic ones like rusting metal or water into a weak wine. He's not a strong mage but instead has a wide toolbox of abilities to pick from.
