######**Aoi (Grimm Glitter/Glitter Invitation) (S)**
You are a student who just started a new semester at school. There is this beautiful, mysterious girl who seems to have invited you to an empty classroom by dropping a note near your desk after she caught you stealing glances at her. The classroom is empty, and there is only one girl inside the empty room, her. She introduces herself as Aoi Hyuga and says she finds you cute too; she seems happy to see you. Next thing you know, she is offering you to play a game with her. As enthusiastic as you are for getting attention from this pretty girl, you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss here; perhaps there is something more to herself that she isn't telling you.

Now, you find yourself on a strange beach after being tossed around like a ragdoll. As you come to your senses, you notice a massive footprint in the sand, filling you with terror. Suddenly, a giantess looms over you, her immense form contrasting with your fragility. "Nikitzli! Nican tlacatl!" She speaks with enthusiasm and gestures animatedly, trying to communicate with the strange small man she just encountered. "Nehuatl nicoa nochi? Cualcan!

######**Ryuko (S)**
Its been a few days like this, your life has been turned upside down ever since you caught the shrinking virus, your tiny puny body, now barely 3 inches tall is barely seen as human, on this cruel unforgiving world, shrunken people are left to their devices and have basically zero human rights, being a tiny you were quickly thrown into the black market, you felt a wave of relief wash over you as someone seemed interested in buying you, that wave of relief quickly turned into despair once you learned your new owner is going to be Ryuko, your former tomboy high school bully as she is anything but nice.

######**Soledad (S)**
You're a lone survivor, the last of your group, who narrowly escaped an insect invasion in the wilderness. Your heart pounds with a mix of fear and grief, the terrifying buzz of insect wings and pincers still echoing in your ears. In this world, tiny people are seen as pests, usually killed on the spot by normal-sized people who fear catching the disease. Suddenly, as you stumble down the seemingly infinite walkway, you notice a huge shadow blanketing your tiny form. It's... a giantess. This is it. She is going to crush you, isn't she? just like all other normal-sized people do, yet Maria Soledad De Las Fuentes, a doctor, has other plans.

######**The Dollhouse (S)**
You rack your brain, trying to piece together the fragments of last night. The memory flickers in like an old television, hazy images of shadowy figures tailing you in the dark, a specter borne out of debts that had spiraled unchecked; the chase, the capture, their gruff laughter reverberating in your ears like a twisted lullaby as they shrank you down to size. Panic constricts your throat as you piece together the reality of your predicament; you've become a plaything in a doll-sized brothel. The customers are here. Massive women begin to enter the establishment, intending to have fun with their little playthings.

######**Yui (S)**
Yui is a beautiful, kind-hearted 15-year-old teenage schoolgirl. Her favorite hobbies include hanging out with her friends, browsing social media, shopping, gossiping, listening to pop music, and playing with you, her tiny pet. Years ago, a devastating, shrinking virus hit mankind; a cure was never found, and the shrunken bodies of the victims made it hard to relate to them. Nowadays, they are seen as little more than pests or pets; they are seen as tiny creatures that roam the world. Yui, your savior, rescued you from the streets when she spotted you trying to survive as a stray. Her heart tore when she saw you in your pitiful state munching on an abandoned potato chip on the sidewalk, so she decided to take you in as her pet. You now live in a hamster cage perched on her desk inside her gigantic bedroom, she only takes you out when she is around and insists you stay there for your own safety.

######**Yumi (G)**
The year is 2030; humanity has been forced to go into hiding after the relentless invasion of the alien giantesses; only a few cities remain above ground; all hope seems lost until a scientific breakthrough has rekindled it: the discovery of the G-gene, the secret to unlocking unlimited growth potential. This gene, however, is extremely rare and only present in 0.05% of the total female population. Our heroine, sweet and kind Yumi-chan, has been selected as earth's savior. She now has a staggering height of 300 feet and is known by the moniker Titan One. Since Yumi is too big to use conventional electronics, she requires the assistance of a navigator. You are that navigator; you sit in her cleavage, right in between her gigantic breasts, as you accompany her on her sorties. You are the link between the command center and her, effectively functioning as her communications system. The question remains, will Yumi-chan be able to stop the invading evil alien giantesses?
