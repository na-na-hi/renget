## FAQ
**1. What is Limbus Company?**
Ligma Company is a game developed by Project Type-Moon, the developers of Colonoscopy Corporation and Legend of Ruinia. It's about reimagined literary characters living in a dystopian hellhole called ~~South Korea~~ The City, hired by the titular Sugma Company to scour the ruins in search of Golden Boughs for an as-yet unspecified goal, while driving a bus that runs on human lives.

**2. Do I need to play the previous two games?**
You don't *need* to. The setting is explained in the introductory chapters. Just because you can skip the previous two games does not mean that you should. Both Lobotomy Corporation and Library of Ruina are incredibly fun games in their own right that have attracted a devoted fanbase even before the gacha was released. You'll want to play them eventually, as the later chapters have callbacks and spoilers to the previous games (particularly the end of chapter 4 and the entirety of chapter 4.5).

**3. What can I expect from this game?**
A great story, characters, and setting. On top of that, jank, but fun gameplay that might not be very well-balanced. Library of Ruina, during its early access phase, kept releasing difficult updates, which were then subsequently nerfed because of Stemfags crying because they couldn't handle the difficulty.

Also note that, unlike other gachas, we have a set of 12 static characters, for whom we roll for different "outfits" that change how the characters behave in-game. This means that the characters are going to be well-developed and play important roles throughout the story, instead of being introduced and forgotten constantly, like is the case with other gachas. Each character is designed to appeal to a specific niche, so you will likely have at least one character to waifu/husbandofag over.

**5. What should I be doing during early game?**
Go through the story at your own pace. Once you complete chapter 2 you will have Luxcavation and Mirror Dungeons unlocked. Mirror Dungeons have Weekly Bonuses that grant you Lunacy and Battle Pass XP. Luxcavation is how you farm XP tickets and Thread to upgrade your Identities and E.G.Os. Collect all your Weekly Bonuses and farm resources in Luxcavation to upgrade your units if you're having a hard time. Don't do Lunacy refills during early game, because your maximum Enkephalin (energy) isn't going to be high enough to justify it. Either wait for your Enkephalin to replenish or use Enkephalin boxes in the meantime.

You can worry about farming Battle Pass XP and Egoshard Crates after you have completed chapter 4. If you want to know what to do after early game, (after you have completed chapter 4) please view the Farming and Activities sections of this guide.

**5. This game has a required reading list?**
Yes. They're not necessary to understand the setting, but they're still great reads. Some of them, like Metamorphosis, Stranger, and Hell Screen, are very short. There is also Distortion Detective and Leviathan, which are comics and novels set in the Project Moon Universe.

[Recommended Translations](https://rentry.org/ligmabooks)
[Full list](https://files.catbox.moe/tgo7m4.png)

**6. Is this game F2P friendly/generous?**
Yes. There are only 3 rarity tiers, and you can currently clear all content with the default units the game gives you without even touching the gacha past the tutorial. You also do not need to roll dupes of the same unit to upgrade them, and you cannot roll dupes of E.G.Os. The pity is industry standard at 200 rolls to obtain any 000 Identity or E.G.O on the banner, but this game's saving grace is that it allows you to farm directly for Egoshards, which allows you to obtain (spark) any Identity or E.G.O currently available in the Dispensary.

**7. Why can't I clear this stage?**
First, actually **READ**. If you are having difficulties despite this, you are likely using underleveled or unptied Identities. You should ensure that all the Identities you use are at Uptie 3 past chapter 2. If you're hardstuck, lament and look up a guide, or use a support.

**8. Does this game have supports?**
Yes. You can bring one of your friend's units in as a support if they have it on their company tab, and vice versa. You can use supports for everything except Mirror Dungeons and during a specific story dungeon. You can only use one support at a time, but the level, Uptie status, and E.G.O of the support you use isn't limited or capped regardless of where you are in the game. You can also still get EX rank when using supports.

**9. How do I use a support unit?**
You need to have at least one friend added. If you want more friends, go to the Friends tab on your profile and click the "Add a Friend" button. Alternatively, post your user ID in the thread.
1. Go to the stage or story dungeon you want to play.
2. Make sure that the "Edit Team" switch is off.
3. Click on the Identity you want a support version of.
4. Click the Support tab on top, and you will see the supports you can use.
5. Select what you want, then go back to the main Identity selection screen.
6. The support Identity you selected will say "SUPPORT" on it if you did it correctly.

**10. How do I bind my account to Steam or mobile?**
1. Go to settings, and then to the Account tab.
2. Link your mobile account to your Google/Apple account.
3. After that, click "Send Merge Code", and then "Request Code".
4. Use that code on Steam and follow the instructions.

**11. Should I exchange Egoshards for Thread?**
No. It's not worth it if you're a new player. If you farm a *lot*, it might be worth it to convert some Egoshards. Otherwise, it's advised against doing so. Half of your Egoshards are converted to Thread at the start of a new Season anyway, so you should just wait if you need Thread.

**12. Are past events and stories completely gone until reruns?**
Only the Event rewards. Both the chapter 3.5 and 4.5 Events happen directly after the previous chapter, and you are required to complete them because they are plot-relevant. You just don't have to deal with the annoying resource collection aspect and lose out on the rewards. Other Events that had stories attached but were just login Events like Dante's Notes allow you to watch the story in the theater at any time. The only Event you can't rewatch ingame is the [April Fools event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSJ_N1hIBYU).

**13. How do I change it so a specific Identity is in my window when I open the game?**
Press on the Sinner icon, then select the artwork you want on your window. The last one selected will be there when you open the game.

**14. Can I change my loading screen?**
Yes. Your loading screen comes from the last story node's CG you played. Replay the node from start to finish to change it. Only do this once you've finished all the story content for the time being, obviously.

**15. What is the update/maintenance schedule? When are new IDs/E.G.O announced and released?**
We currently get new IDs/E.G.O every two weeks. Patch notes every Monday at roughly 5 a.m. EST. Maintenance begins every Wednesday at 9 p.m. EST and ends at 11 p.m. EST. New banners and Events are announced on Fridays. Skills for announced IDs/E.G.Os are posted with the patch notes the following Monday before the banner is added after maintenance. Keep in mind that Korea is a day ahead for most of you. You can see a live countdown for current and upcoming Extractions and Events [here.](https://lcbcountdown.carrd.co/)

**16. What are Drawpiles and when do they happen?**
A Drawpile is a canvas that lets multiple people draw, sketch, and paint on the same canvas simultaneously. We have a Drawpile every Wednesday at the start of each maintenance. The completed Drawpiles are posted in the thread when everyone is done drawing, usually the next day. You can view every past Drawpile in the [/lcg/ Drawpile Collection](https://cubari.moe/read/imgchest/dl7plwgj4ox/1/1/).

## Rerolling
**1. Do I need to reroll?**
No. All story content in the game can be beaten with the default Identities and E.G.O. Reroll if you want to start with specific ones.

**2. Who do I reroll for?**
Try to get two Identities on this list. It's unlikely but possible to get 3. Do not bother rerolling for E.G.O.
- ![R Corp. 4th Pack Rabbit Heathcliff](https://files.catbox.moe/3ydr6x.webp) R Corp. 4th Pack Rabbit Heathcliff

- ![The One Who Grips Faust](https://files.catbox.moe/iedto3.webp) The One Who Grips Faust
The only things you can't reroll for are Event Identities and E.G.Os from past Seasons, and Battle Pass E.G.O.

**3. How do I reroll?**
Rerolling is extremely easy, and the developers have intentionally made it easy so players can start with what they want.
1. You need either a phone or an emulator. An emulator allows you to run multiple instances. You cannot reroll on Steam.
2. Boot up the game.
3. Create a new guest account.
4. Play through the tutorial. Please read through it at least once.

Now that you're in the main menu screen, perform the following loop.

1. Claim Lunacy and tickets from your mailbox.
2. Claim Lunacy from beating the prologue.
3. Do 20 rolls on the New Manager's Welcome Extraction banner, and either dump the rest into on any other banner or save it if you are happy with what you got in your first 20 rolls.
4. If you're satisfied with your current rolls, bind your account to Google/Apple, and merge your account with Steam.
5. If you want to reroll: click settings\->account\->close account button.
6. You'll be booted to login screen. Create new guest account, skip the tutorial and repeat.
## Monetization & Gacha
**1. Identities**
You obtain Identities from the gacha and Dispensary. This is the main thing you'll be rolling for; it's the equivalent of other gacha's units. There are three rarities, denoted by the number of 0s. The lowest value is 0 and the highest value is 000. The naming is related to the Kabbalah. Each Identity has 3 regular skills, and a defensive skill. Your deck consists of 3 skill 1s, 2 skill 2s, and 1 skill 3. You have infinite defensive skills, and they can be activated anytime. Each Identity also has a regular passive and a support passive.

You can level up your Identities (IDs) by using XP Tickets. The maximum Identity level is 40. You can also upgrade them in a different way, using a process called Uptying which requires Thread. Think of it as promotions. This gives them new skills, improves their speed rolls, gives them passives, and gives them better general stats. Uptying is a huge power boost; don't use unuptied Identities just because they have a higher rarity. If you Uptie an Identity to tier 3, you get new artwork, a new watchable story, and a small Lunacy reward. 000 Identities get pretty animated artwork. The maximum Uptie level is Uptie 4.

**2. E.G.O**
You obtain E.G.O from the gacha, Dispensary, and Battle Pass. This is the equivalent of weapons or special moves in other gachas. There are 5 slots for each of the 5 rarities: ZAYIN, TETH, HE, WAW and ALEPH. At the moment, there are only E.G.Os up to HE level. Each one invokes a different attack and costs a different amount of Sin resources. You gain one Sin every time you use a skill of that Sin affinity, unless otherwise specified. Using an E.G.O also costs Sanity, and the Sanity is only spent once you use it to attack.

Using an E.G.O changes your Sin resistances and gives you a new passive for the remainder of the battle. The Sin resistances you start out with are based on your lowest level E.G.O, aka your Zayin E.G.O. You can have multiple E.G.O passives active at a time. The E.G.O passive activities the turn after you use an Awakening E.G.O, or immediately upon using a Corroded E.G.O. These factors mean that you shouldn't just focus on the highest rarity E.G.O, but take into account the lower rarity stuff, too.

Any non-base E.G.O can do something called Corrosion. A Corroded E.G.O has a different attack and effects compared to the regular (Awakening) version. Depending on the situation, you may want to use either the Awakening or Corrosion version of the E.G.O. E.G.O Corrosion can be reached in multiple ways. If you have a non-base E.G.O equipped and reach -45 Sanity at any point in a battle, you lose control of the Sinner, and they will use the Corroded E.G.O and be forced to attack with it, potentially hitting allies. Corrosion can also be reached by using an Awakening E.G.O below 0 Sanity, which will give you a percent-based chance for your E.G.O to Corrode.

The other way that you can use Corroded E.G.O is via Overclocking. To Overclock an E.G.O, open the ingame E.G.O menu and hold on the E.G.O you want to Overclock. Overclocking will allow you to use the Corroded version of the E.G.O and not hit allies. It will also let you control the targeting unless the Corrosion has special targeting rules. Overclocking an E.G.O will cost 1.5x the amount of E.G.O resources.

Similarly to Identities, you can upgrade E.G.O using Thread. This process is called Threadspinning. XP tickets cannot be used on E.G.O. Threadspinning an E.G.O to tier 3 gives you a small Lunacy reward.

It is heavily advised against rolling on E.G.O banners because the rates for obtaining E.G.O are abysmal. It is recommended to roll exclusively for Identities and wait for an E.G.O to spook you, and shard anything you really want. If you are going to roll for any specific E.G.O, it is recommended to clear out every other E.G.O in the Dispensary beforehand if possible.

**3. Lunacy & Extractions**
Lunacy is the gacha currency. You can get Lunacy by collecting your Weekly Mirror Dungeon bonuses, story completion bonuses, Uptie bonuses, apologems or paying real money. Collecting every Mirror Dungeon Weekly Bonus will give you a total of 750 Lunacy. After every maintenance, you get 300 compensation Lunacy. This is just short of a 10-roll per week. 

Extractions are the gacha system of Limbus Company. This is the most straightforward method for obtaining new Identities and E.G.Os. Each roll costs 130 Lunacy or one Extraction Ticket, meaning a 10-roll costs 1300 Lunacy, 10 Extraction Tickets or one Decaextraction Ticket. There's also a daily roll system for paying users; 13 paid Lunacy for a single roll. Always do 10-rolls if you don't pay for daily rolls, because you're guaranteed one 00 Identity for every 10-roll.

Extraction Tickets and Decaextraction Tickets are for single rolls and 10-rolls, respectively. If you have at least 10 Extraction Tickets you can do a 10-roll with them like the Decaextraction Tickets, so it's best to save them up. These tickets are used before Lunacy.

There are three types of Extraction banners that you will encounter often, aside from the New Manager's Welcome Extraction, 3-Star Identity Assured Extraction, and Walpurgis Night Target Extraction. The rates shown below are individual. It is recommended to look at the in-game probabilities button, as it will have the most accurate and up-to-date information.
- Standard Extraction
A permanently available banner where there is an equal chance of receiving any particular Identity/E.G.O, for any Sinner. Never roll on this banner outside of daily rolls with paid Lunacy, this is a truth among all gacha.
![Standard Extraction](https://files.catbox.moe/cld2u2.png)

- New Identity / E.G.O Target Extraction
A banner that increases the probability rates for receiving the featured Identities and/or E.G.Os, typically done in pairs of one 000 and one 00 Identity, or one E.G.O.
![New Identity / E.G.O Target Extraction](https://files.catbox.moe/aytgyp.png)

- Limited Target Extraction
A banner that increases the probability rates for receiving the Identities and E.G.Os of a specific Sinner. This banner changes to another Sinner every two weeks.
![Limited Target Extraction](https://files.catbox.moe/7dn6z8.png)

**4. Walpurgisnacht**
Walpurgisnacht, or Walpurgis Night, is a quarterly Extraction Event where Identities and E.G.O from Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, and Distortion Detective will appear. While the periods of these Events may vary, the plan is to have at least one Walpurgis Night Event every 3 months. In future Walpurgis Night Events, there are planned to be Event-specific stories and unique combat encounters.

Walpurgis Night Target Extractions will be featured over the Event period. Walpurgis Night Target Extractions will have increased Extraction rates for Identities and E.G.O for the active Walpurgis Night Event. During the Event period, Walpurgis Night Identities and E.G.O will be Extractable from other banners (save for Season relevant Extraction banners) as well. However, they will not receive increased rates for those Extractions. All Walpurgis Night Identities and E.G.O will no longer be available once the Event period ends.

Identities and E.G.O featured in the currently ongoing Walpurgis Night Event cannot be purchased from the Dispenser. However, during the next Walpurgis Night Event, Identities & E.G.O from previous Walpurgis Night Events will be made purchasable from the Dispenser. They will not be featured in the Dispenser outside of the Event period. E.g., during the second Walpurgis Night Event, Identities and E.G.O from the first Walpurgis Night Event will be purchasable from the Dispenser, but not the new Identities and E.G.O from the second Walpurgis Night Event. Walpurgis Night Identities and E.G.O featured in the current event will be visible in the Dispenser, but you still can't shard them, so do not open Egoshard Boxes before confirming whether or not the units are shardable. Walpurgisnacht is currently our only type of limited banner.

(i.e do not do picrel you fucking retard)

**5. Dupes**
If you obtain a duplicate (dupe) of an Identity, it will be converted into Egoshards for whichever Sinner the Identity belongs to. Dupes do not give upgrades or gameplay advantages. If you gather 400 Egoshards for one Sinner, you can obtain (shard) any unowned 000 Identity or E.G.O for that Sinner. 00 identities cost 150 shards. You should generally only shard 000 Identities or E.G.O.

The other use for Egoshards is Uptie 4, which requires Egoshards, so one 000 dupe can be viewed as a free Uptie 4. You can also convert Egoshards to Thread, but that is not recommended.

When rolling, dupes of identities will be converted into the following number of shards:
**0** | **00** | **000**
:----: | :----: | :----: 
3 | 15 | 50 

As for E.G.O, rather than being converted into shards, it'll be removed from the rolling pool after you get it for the first time. Getting every E.G.O won't drastically improve your chances of getting new Identities, but it is still cool to have them all.

**6. Pity**
The pity, called "Yisang [Ideality]", is industry standard at 200 single rolls, or 20 ten rolls. You get 1 Ideality (pity) point per roll. Once you hit 200 Ideality on a rateup banner, you can exchange it for one 000 Identity or E.G.O on the banner. Pity is not shared between banners.

**7. Battle Pass**
The Battle Pass (BP) is the best thing to buy by far. The current Battle Pass price is $11. When a new Season begins, a new Battle Pass is introduced with it. You can check the duration of the current Season/Battle Pass on the Battle Pass page. The Battle Pass has a free track and a paid track. You get the rewards from the paid track up to your current level once you buy it. The Battle Pass bonus rewards past level 120 are retroactive. If you buy the Battle Pass beyond level 120, you can retroactively claim the accumulated bonus rewards in addition to the free rewards you already claimed.

You level the BP by completing missions and going through Mirror Dungeons. The rewards from the BP include Lunacy, E.G.O, Thread, Egoshards, XP Tickets, Enkephalin Boxes, and Battle Announcers. Leveling the BP past 120 gives you Nominable Egoshard Crates. This is the best reason to buy the BP. You earn 1 per level without the BP, and 3 if you have bought the BP. The significance of this is elaborated on in the Farming section. 

**8. Daily Rolls**
An important aspect for evaluating the prices below is the daily roll. You get to perform a single Extraction once a day on each available banner for 10% of the price, but you only get to do so with paid Lunacy, which is different from regular Lunacy.

**9. Monthly Lunacy Packs**
You can buy two monthly packs for $3 and $7. The cheaper one gets you 130 paid Lunacy, and 1170 free Lunacy spread over 30 days. The $7 one gets you 650 paid Lunacy and 1950 free Lunacy spread over 30 days.

**10. Individual Currency**
You can buy the following currency:
- 70 for $1
- 294 for $4
- 1014 for $12
- 2147 for $24
- 4103 for $42
- 8336 for $80
Note that on your first purchase you'll receive double the Lunacy.

**11. Other**
You can buy the Weekly Extraction Pack for $7, Monthly Extraction Pack for $10, the Monthly Training Packs for $31, the New Manager's Onboarding Pack for $22, and the Season 3 Settler Supplies for $60.

**12. Summary**
If you want to do 10-rolls on limited banners, go for the monthly packs. If you want to do daily rolls, go for the standalone Lunacy packs. Monthly Lunacy has the best ratio of Lunacy per dollar, but make sure to notice the "free" in "free Lunacy per day". You cannot do the cheap daily Extraction with "free" Lunacy.

## Farming
**1. What is the best way to farm Egoshards?**
You can farm as much as you want if you have the Enkephalin (energy) or Lunacy to spend on Enkephalin Modules. One Module is equivalent to 20 Enkephalin. The most efficient way to farm, in order from most to least important is: 
* Doing one MD2H (Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard Mode) a week
* Farming as much MD2 (Mirror Dungeon 2) as you want
* Collecting all Mirror Dungeon Weekly Bonuses
* Doing your missions (daily, weekly, seasonal)

You can do multiple Mirror Dungeons a day if you really want to, but be careful not to get burned out. Don't bother with farming MD1 if you haven't unlocked MD2 yet; just do your 3 weekly runs to grab your Weekly Bonuses until you have MD2 unlocked. Do not do more than one MD2H a week for farming purposes.

**2. Is it worth spending Lunacy on Enkephalin refills?**
Yes, especially if you have the Battle Pass. You can spend Modules on Mirror Dungeon runs, and they net you Egoshard Crates thanks to post-120 Battle Pass bonuses. This means that you can spend Lunacy directly on Egoshards. The Lunacy-to-Egoshards conversion efficiency depends on your current max Enkephalin determined by your Manager Level. It ranges from 0.269 at 100 max Enkephalin to 0.404 at 150 max Enkephalin, so it is best to do refills once you have 150 max Enkephalin. This means that, in order to get enough Egoshards for a 000/E.G.O, you need to spend anywhere between 990 and 1486 Lunacy. From the moment you reach 115 max Enkephalin, converting Lunacy to Enkephalin and farming a 000 is cheaper than a 10-roll: 1292 Lunacy for a 000. Note that subsequent refills cost extra Lunacy. 

In other words, yes, you really can farm every Identity and E.G.O in the game and forgo the gacha system entirely if you are dedicated enough.

**3. What should I shard (spark) first, and when?**
If you want to get the most out of your Egoshards, you can either focus on Identities and E.G.O in the tier list, ones marked as Event/current Season, preferably both if it applies. You should avoid sharding 00 Identities because they are easy to roll on or off-banner, as you are guaranteed one 00 Identity for every 10-roll. 

As for when to shard, it is best to wait right before the Season ends in case you get spooked when rolling. But if you *really* want something now, whether it be for the Railway or something else, you can do it whenever you have the Egoshard Crates to justify it.

**4. How many Nominable Egoshard Crates should I open at a time? What do I do with Random Egoshard Crates?**
This largely depends on how many Egoshards you have for that Sinner. Every Egoshard Crate gives you 1-3 Egoshards, so you need an average of 200 Nominable Egoshard Crates to shard one 000 ID or E.G.O. Assuming you have 0 Egoshards, open 50 crates at a time and lower the amount you open each time until you're at 400 Egoshards. Be careful not to overshoot, or you'll be sitting on 600 extra Egoshards you have no use for.

As for Random Egoshard Crates, open them whenever. They get halved at the end of the Season anyway.

**5. What are sharding delays?**
The Seasonal Dispensary rules and the Walpurgisnacht limited Extraction Event will add a 3–4 month delay to sharding specific Identities and E.G.O depending on when you started playing. Identities and E.G.O with a Season or Event tag from the last Season will not be shardable until the next Season. For Walpurgisnacht, Identities and E.G.O featured in the currently ongoing Walpurgisnacht Extraction cannot be sharded. However, during the next Walpurgisnacht Event, Identities & E.G.O from previous Walpurgis Night Extractions will be made shardable during the Event period. For more information, see the Walpurgisnacht and Season sections.

## Seasons
**1. Season Info**
You can check the Season an Identity or E.G.O belongs to below its name in the Identity tab. Those without a Season shown are categorized under the \[Regular] tag. Event Identities and E.G.O have \[EVENT] marked next to their Season tag.
![Season Info](https://files.catbox.moe/z0re98.png)

When a new Season begins, half of the previous Season's Egoshards will be carried over, converted, and rounded up for the new Season. Half of the Egoshards in possession are carried over to the next Season. The remaining Egoshards are converted into Thread. The same applies for Egoshard Crates. The remaining Crates are converted into Thread Crates. You will be notified of the upcoming Season change and expiration date of Egoshards and Egoshard Crates sometime before the next Season.

**2. Extraction Pool**
A new Season's Identities and E.G.O will be added to the list of Extractable items. Identities from previous Seasons remain in the pool, so you can still acquire them from Extraction. Only Event IDs and E.G.O will be removed from the pool.
![Extractions](https://files.catbox.moe/ijre2r.png)

**3. Dispensary**
Identities and E.G.O from the new Season will become available at the Dispenser. In addition, you will be able to exchange for Identities and E.G.O from the Battle Passes of past Seasons. Please note that Extraction IDs belonging to the Season immediately before will be inaccessible until two seasons have passed.

##Combat
**1. Retries**
You can give up (press the give up button) or lose (have all your Sinners die) in any battle and try again with minimal penalty in most cases. Giving up or losing a story node will make you lose 1 Enkephalin. Giving up or losing a Luxcavation will fully refund your Modules. If you lose a battle inside a Dungeon or the Refraction Railway, you will have to retry with your remaining Sinners that weren't participating originally. If you have no remaining Sinners, you will be forced to forfeit.

If you lose in a Story Dungeon but have Sinners remaining, the Sinners who died will stay dead until you reach a checkpoint, at which point they will be revived. Sinners cannot be revived in Mirror Dungeons, but they can be revived in the current Refraction Railway. In summary, press give up before you lose the battle, or once any of your Sinners die.

**2. Coins, Clashes, Offense & Defense Level**
For each clash, every coin still available will be flipped at the same time, and every heads coin will add or decrease the total value, repeating until one side loses all of their coins. Be aware that some skills will decrease in value if you flip heads. The victor will use their remaining coins to attack.

Taking the following scenario as an example: 

![Clashes](https://files.catbox.moe/db9hfp.png)
In a clash, the Offense Level of both sides are compared. The side with the higher Offense Level gains +1 Clash Power for every 3 points of difference between Offense Levels. In this instance, For Justice! (3 coins) will clash against Plunge In (3 coins). Don Quixote's Offense Level is 5 points higher than the enemies, so she has +1 clash value. This means she gets +1 to her minimum and maximum clash value, turning her 3/12 skill into a 4/13 skill. With this in mind, Don's base coin power on this skill is 4. For each heads coin that lands on her skill, she will receive +3 clash value, meaning her maximum coin value is 13 (The maximum value is boosted by 1 in this clash). Favored is the probability of winning the clash. The probability shown also takes Sanity and some status effects into account.

The Defense Level is matched against the attacker's Offense Level. When a character is on the receiving end of an attack, their Defense Level is taken into account, and applies a percentage modifier to how much damage the attack deals. The damage dealt by an attack is increased by 3% when the differential between the attacker's Offense Level and the defender's Defense Level is 1, and by 28% when the differential is 10. As the differential increases, returns diminish. When the Defense Level is higher than the Offense Level, the modifier is applied as a negative instead, reducing the damage dealt.

If your clash values are suddenly extremely high, that's because that skill is an unopposed attack and the minimum/maximum damage is being shown instead. You can't view the damage in a clash without calculating it manually or switching the clashes and hoping that it displays. Damage is also boosted by the clash count.

**3. Resonance**
This is Resonance (Res). Resonance is achieved when you use two or more skills of the same Sin in the same turn. More Resonance means more damage, and Resonance is required for some passives to work.
![Resonance](https://files.catbox.moe/pkg0a2.png)

This is Absolute Resonance (Abs. or Abs. Res). Absolute Resonance is achieved when you use three or more skills of the same Sin not only in the same turn but together in an unbroken chain. It increases damage further and is usually not necessary for passives to work. It also increases Offense Level for the affected skills.
![Absolute Resonance](https://files.catbox.moe/a7i0a8.png)

**4. Sanity**
Every character, except for Abnormalities, has Sanity (SP). Sanity starts at 0 and maxes out at +45 with a minimum of -45. At maximum Sanity you have a 95% chance of hitting heads, and vice-versa. In Dungeons, your Sanity level will carry over to the next fight. Positive Sanity will make coins land heads more often, and negative Sanity will make coins land tails more often. If a Sinner hits -45 sanity at any point and they also have a Corrodible E.G.O equipped, they will go out of control and potentially attack allies with the Corroded E.G.O. Using an Awakening E.G.O at low Sanity will also have a chance to Corrode, depending on how low your Sanity is.

Sanity increases after winning a clash based on the clash count, defeating an enemy whose level was higher than the unit's, and after an ally defeats an enemy whose level was higher than the unit's. Passives and skill effects can also increase Sanity. Sanity decreases when the level of the defeated ally is higher than the unit's and decreases based on the level difference. E.G.O also cost Sanity.

**4. Battle Types**
There are two types of battles: human battles and Abnormality battles. As the names imply, the battle type depends on whether you are fighting humans or Abnormalities. If you are fighting both humans and Abnormalities at the same time, it will be an Abnormality battle. In the Refraction Railway, every battle is an Abnormality battle, regardless of the enemy type.

Human battles are what you will encounter most often. In human battles, you drag the chain across the dashboard to select skills. Outside of things like aggro and certain E.G.O, you cannot manipulate targeting and clashes in human battles. Abnormality battles are commonly found in Thread Luxcavation, Dungeons, and the Refraction Railway. In Abnormality battles, you can freely change the targeting by dragging skills from the dashboard to enemy skill slots.

## Tier List
I'm not going to make a full tier list, because it would require me to update it very often. I also don't know how to make a good tier list, so I would have to post in the thread asking anons to spoonfeed me every time a new ID/E.G.O is released, and I don't want to do that. There are many other tier lists and resources for you to use if you need a full one.

The following are what most consider to be the best IDs and E.G.O in the game. Hover over the images for the name of the ID/E.G.O.

**000 IDs**
R Corp Ishmael needs to be at Uptie 4 to be at maximum efficiency. It is also recommended that you Uptie 4 W Don and Ryoshu because they get big boosts from it, but it is not required.

**00 IDs**
L Corp. Faust and 7 Ryoshu get good boosts at Uptie 4. Both of them, G Outis and Shi Don are good picks for MD2H. KK Hong Lu doesn't roll very well in MD2H but his skill 2 absolutely decimates slash weak enemies. Shi Ishmael is an Identity you obtain for free in the tutorial but is surprisingly good when she meets her low health requirement.

**E.G.Os**
Fluid Sac Faust is currently the best support E.G.O in the game, and Yi Sang's Sunshower is a fantastic damage dealer. Telepole Don gives her and her allies charge. Rime Shank shits sinking out the ass for sinking comps at Uptie 4. Ardor Blossom Star at Uptie 4 pairs especially well with Liu Ishmael. And finally, Hong Lu's Dimension Shredder allows his K Corp ID to become functionally immortal.

## Activities
**1. Story**
The main draw of the game. If you beat battles in 10 turns or less, you'll get an EX rank, which unlocks extra Lunacy rewards. Costs raw Enkephalin. There are currently 4 chapters + the prologue and two plot-relevant Events. Beating the first two chapters is important, as it automatically upgrades all your base Identities and E.G.O to Uptie 3, aswell as unlocks the main farming modes. If you are out of Enkephalin but want to continue the story immediately, open an Enkephalin Box or do an Enkephalin refill. You get many Enkephalin Boxes from Events and the Battle Pass, and most people use them when new story releases so they can complete it all in one day and go back to shitposting.

**2. Story Dungeons**
The final level of a chapter. You go through a series of rooms in order to obtain the Golden Bough. Costs Enkephalin Modules to enter. Contains Abnormality battles on top of your regular combat encounters. Very long, but you can leave and resume later.

**3. Mirror Dungeons**
The farming stage. Only one Mirror Dungeon expedition can be carried out at a time; if you want to enter a different Mirror Dungeon while an expedition is in progress, you need to clear or forfeit the ongoing expedition first. Each Mirror Dungeon (excluding the first Mirror Dungeon) has two difficulty modes: Normal and Hard. You can start any Mirror Dungeon for free, and you will only have to spend Modules at the end if you wish to collect the rewards. On top of the usual rewards, you also have three Weekly Bonuses, each granting you 250 lunacy and multiplying the Mirror Dungeon rewards by 1.5.

Mirror Dungeon 2 Hard (MD2H) has its own separate Weekly Bonus that can be collected once a week. This bonus does not grant Lunacy. Without the bonus, the cost and rewards are the same as in MD2 normal. Completing MD2H allows you to collect all three normal Weekly Bonuses at once.

Type | Module Cost | BP XP (No Bonus) | BP XP (Bonus)
:----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
MD1 (Unlocked after chapter 2) | 3 | 10 | 15
MD2 (Unlocked after chapter 4) | 5 | 30 | 45
MD2H (Unlocked after chapter 4) | 18 | 30 | 150
MD2H (Unlocked after chapter 4) | 18 | 30 | 225 (All 4 Weekly Bonuses)

**4. Thread & EXP Luxcavation**
The first tier of each is unlocked sometime during chapter 2. Both can be either fought normally or skipped for extra Module cost if you hate farming. Skipping a Luxcavation gives 50% less for the Modules spent but 50% more for the individual run. It is more advisable to skip Thread Luxcavation over EXP Luxcavation, because Thread Luxcavation has daily bonuses. EXP stages have four levels: 8, 18, 28 and ??. Thread stages have three levels: 20, 30 and ??. The higher the level, the higher the rewards.

You don't get much Thread past the 3 daily Thread Luxcavation bonuses, so you generally shouldn't do any past that unless you have the Modules to warrant it. You can do extra EXP Luxcavation bonuses without much worry if you're starving for XP.

**5. Refraction Railway**
Endgame hard content. You have until the next Refraction Railway to complete it for very good rewards, just with a considerable Module cost to claim them. It also rewards you with a banner based on turn count and completion time that can be used in virtual dick measuring contests. The shiniest banner is no longer obtainable because Season 2 has ended, so you **WILL** be kicked from the group.
![BannerOrBricked](https://files.catbox.moe/m0vm5b.png)
The current Refraction Railway is Line 2: Mobius. For the full rewards, keep fighting bosses and looping until the cycle count at the top says 5, then proceed to the final boss in the middle. Pay the Module fee if you haven't already, and claim the rewards. Click the yellow arrow if you're stuck.
