##What Was Rokosbasilisk?

Rokosbasilisk.io was a frontend for the OpenAI API. It was shut down by its creator after nearly a week.

![Rokosbasilisk.io, moments before it died. You can discern the tastes of the userbase based on what bots were the most popular.](https://i.imgur.com/pFRiOQX.jpg)

An anon captured the home page as an .mhtml file before it died. [Download it here.](https://files.catbox.moe/iprym1.io)

After a few minutes of downtime, Rokodev posted this on his official tripcode:

So, there it is. Roko is officially and unequivocally dead.

Will you get your chatlogs back? Will you get your secret bots back? Nobody really knows at this point. But Rokodev accidentally uploaded a file containing all public bots, which includes secret definitions.
