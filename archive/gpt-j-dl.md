#####Raw GPT-J-6B step_383500_slim.tar.zstd
The original model using the JAX library, as released by EleutherAI and used by the **original GPT-J-6B colab**. Only supports top-p and temperature options, but runs on a TPU.

#####Kobolded GPT-J-6B j6b_ckpt.tar
Converted to Torch, e.g. for use with the **GPT-J-6B Rev 2 colab**. Supports additional options such as repetition penalty, but requires a GPU with more than 12GB of VRAM.
