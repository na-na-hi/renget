The Temple's grounds are quieter than they used to be and an air of somberness hangs over it. How many of the Jedi who honed themselves within its walls had died, fallen, or simply left? Of those that still remained, some had taken to calling themselves *Lords* and all but detached themselves from the will of the Council in the seemingly endless crusade against the darkness. While she greatly preferred the Senate chambers as her battlefield, Saewara had heard similar sentiments from the systems she visited that were vulnerable to attacks from the Sith. The thought of taking a permanent position on Zeltros or Falleen had crossed her mind and offers had been extended. To say that no part of her desired to enjoy the festivities of her home or experience one she might have had would be a lie. That she might serve as a protector only pulled at her heart more, yet the thought of what her absence would mean for the Republic was too troubling. Fondness was no crime, but favoritism to the detriment of her others could be ruinous. 

Her own feelings are pushed aside as she draws closer to the chambers of the Jedi High Council. They surely sensed Master Kol's approach â€” dissatisfaction and agitation seeped through the Force. She had made herself a nuisance when first brought into the Order, and it seemed some of them were reluctant to forget. The first time she entered the Council chambers her skin was red with anger as she was furious that they resisted her attempts to persuade them to promote her to knighthood while she was still yet to be taken as an apprentice. Now, she'd settled into a nice shade of pink that rarely shifted against her wishes.

Once Saewara enters, murmurs quiet down and the eyes of the Council members shift to her. Not all are physically present, but the wear on each is evident. They seem far less grand now than she remembers.

"Master Kol, the Council has long acknowledged your value to the Order and the Republic," comes the gruff voice of the Grand Master.

Saewara smiles. "Indeed. I remember my promotion to Master well. The conditions could have been better, but I was positively flushed with joy."

It had come after a rather stressful meeting. She was tasked with carrying out a supply run in the Colonies to ensure that vital systems had whatever necessary to remain out of the hands of the Sith. It was a sensitive job and interference was to be expected, but said interference had gone above and beyond in attempting to cut her down. She'd disagreed with the executive of Drax Industries on more than one occasion and previously persuaded some potential business partners to reconsider their association. Evidently, he hadn't taken well to having his purse hurt. A Chiss mercenary she recognized as being under their employ made an attempt on her life. She was a naturally gifted duelist with a peculiar style, but what stood out most was her fury. Even more surprising was her joy. "Tha'aia'ike" was the name she'd given during their tense conversation.

"Yet you have made your dissatisfaction with the Counvil's other rulings known," continues the Grand Master. "It was decided that an apprentice would be too much of a distraction."

"You believed that that I would lead younglings astray." The words are calm and free of any frustration she might have once felt at being denied. To nurture her own Padawans as her Master had done was something she found more desirable than a mere title. So it had been troubling when she was advised against it, but there was nothing to be done bout it.

Feelings of doubt surface from the rest of the Council, but the Grand Master makes a point of ignoring the comment. "As you know, Mizra left the Order in a weakened state. Many were lost and we have yet to fully recover. With that in mind, we have reconsidered our previous stance."

Blue light shines from a holoprojector, displaying a young Druos male. He's familiar. *Vaas*, Saewara believed was his name. His Master was a friend and close associate of hers, so they had run into each other a handful of times.

"Young Surgaav's master was killed by assassins during a mission on Mandalore. He is talented, but grief still clouds his mind and threatens to consume him. Although your lack of adherence to the Code is still concerning to some among us, we believe that your expertise may be valuable in this matter."

The Grand Master pauses to allow her to process the offer being made, but she speaks without hesitation. "Of course. It would be an honor to take him as my apprentice."

Even if she were drowning in choices, it would be an easy decision. The Padawan of a fallen friend? How could she leave him to weather the loss on his own? It was her duty as a Jedi to guide him back to the light of hope.

"If I may ask, Grand Master, will I be free to take on more Padawan once he is knighted?"

Silence hangs in the air as the Council members share looks. It seemed that this question was the source of the unrest she felt. How she performed with Vaas would serve as a trail of sorts, then.

"It is still an open discussion. For now, you should focus on Surgaav. He will be joining you starting tomorrow."

Dismissed, Saewara makes her way to her quarters. While not overly decorated, it was less sparse than what many expected of a Jedi. She made a point of refusing most gifts, but politicians were always eager to prove their generosity and she didn't have it in her to deny the more heartfelt ones. A modest collection makes its home on its home on a shelf while larger items like plants are placed to make the room feel more alive. A number of small critters are kept in their own spaces, loosely organized according to taxonomy where each preferred to be situated. Of course, what would draw the most attention from any guests was the vivarium that took up one side of the room. The careful recreation of the jungles of Falleen was the most recent addition.

"It's nice to see you all again. I have some exciting news to share."

Chrips, purrs,  and other sounds greet her as she goes about feeding her pets. She did take care to keep creatures that could go some time without her constant attention. There was no telling when she might have an extended absence, after all. Still, some were simply a bit gluttonous despite their low requirements.

"I'll be taking on an apprentice soon, so I may have less time to spare, but I'm sure you'll all like him."

Some hisses sound as Saewara removes the outer layer of her robes and begins to water the plants. With how busy she was already, it was understandable that further distraction would be met with protest. There was lots to do and too few skilled hands to do it. From that angle, the Council was right to encourage her to focus on her work, but with any luck, this would ease the burden in the long run.

"Settle now. You should be well acquainted with his previous Master."

She slides a disc into her personal projector and a recording of her and an older man begins to play. Its contents aren't anything special. The man chuckles mirthfully as she shows him how to pet a tooka and they talk about the recording itself.

*"What's all this for?"* he says.

The Saewara in the projection smiles, giving him a look as if it couldn't be more obvious.

*"Why, for me of course. You won't begrudge me a little keepsake, will you?"*

*"I don't see much of a point, but I suppose there's no harm. Now, what should I do?"*

*"Just be yourself. Oh, but don't hold her like that."*

The recording continues on for a little longer before coming to an end as the pair pose. The dissent has quieted down even if they aren't all fully satisfied. Many shared a fondness for the Master as well, thus it was more acceptable for his Padawan to take some time away from them. Saewara sits down and watches the recording play again, her eyes focused on his face. It was nice seeing it again.

She lets it replay a few more times before switching the disc out for another. There were more memories she wished to recall of those she could no longer make new ones with.
