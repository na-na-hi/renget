##General Information:

The incarnation system has been established to utilize humanity’s latent power to bring about an evolution in the human species. Individuals with sufficient <Divinity> and a high <Synchronization Rate> with a <Myth> were chosen as Incarnations, individuals capable of controlling divine <Authorities> or skills.

>Myths

The system uses human fables, legends, and religious practices to create <Myths>. Currently, all extant <Myths> originate from the Hellenistic pantheon. The intricacies as to why this is done are classified, and, indeed, not particularly helpful for incarnations, but it should be noted that there is no consciousness in <Myths>, and there is no risk of being overtaken by them

>Directives

Each incarnation has a <Directive>, directly related to the nature and personality of their <Myth>. In most cases, an Incarnation's <Authorities> are suited to help the incarnation achieve their <Directive>. Accomplishing one’s <Directive> will allow for an increase to <Influence>, which will increase an incarnation’s <Level>.

>Authorities

Your <Authorities> are the ways in which you can channel your divine power using the system. Some <Authorities> use more power than others, and other <Authorities> have costs other than divinity, such as physical materials or resources derived from other organisms. It is possible to use <Divinity> without relying on your <Authorities>, but doing so isn’t recommended.

>Influence and Level

The system works by extracting divinity from a number of sources and channeling it into the incarnations. <Influence> is a numerical representation of the degree to which you have aided the system. Performing actions that extract <Divinity> into the system gives it the power it needs to increase your <Capacity> for divine power. This is numerically notated by your <Level>. It is impossible to increase the level of your <Authorities> beyond your <Level>. The amount of <Influence> you need to increase your level doubles at every <Level>. It takes the same amount of influence to increase the level of an <Authority> as the threshold required to increase your <Level> to the same amount. (For example, it would cost 300 <Influence> to increase a level 1 <Authority> to level 3, 100 for (1 to 2) and 200 for (2 to 3)).

>Subjugation and Eliminations

When you destroy another incarnation, you are capable of subsuming their Influence, and one or more of their <Authorities>, as well as acquiring their <Myths> as <Epithets>.

>Synchronization Rate

Your <Synchronization Rate> Determines the extent to which you embody the nature of a <Myth>. Synchronization rate can never decrease, because, as an incarnation, your actions and personality actively serve to rewrite the relevant <Myths>. Reaching certain milestones with <Synchronization Rate> provides certain benefits.

>Epithets

Whenever you subjugate another incarnation or achieve certain special conditions, you will receive an <Epithet>. <Epithets> are full <Myths> that you can acquire secondarily to your primary one. Should the <Synchronization Rate> of an epithet ever surpass that of your primary <Myth>, you will undergo a forced <Deification> process, dramatically altering your <Status>.

>Titles

You gain <Titles> from meeting specific conditions. They can provide a number of effects, including but not limited to Authorities, Influence, Epithets, and Items

>Shop

You can use <Influence> to buy <Items> or even <Authorities> from the <Shop>. You cannot spend more <Influence> than you have. Lowering <Influence> below a level-up threshold will not decrease your <Level>

>Inventory

You can only keep items bought from the <Shop> in your <Inventory>. There is no limit to the number or weight of items you can store. Once an item is removed from your <Inventory>, it cannot be returned

>Pantheons

A <Pantheon> is a group of connected <Myths> that can join together to increase their power. Even in an incomplete <Pantheon>, members can communicate from anywhere on earth, send divine power to each other, and instinctively know their location. Upon completing a <Pantheon>, other benefits are achieved depending on its nature. In order to join a <Pantheon> You need to meet a certain <Synchronization>

##FAQ

>Q) Is it possible to delete authorities or epithets?

A: Yes. However, it cannot be done by accident and, once done, cannot be reversed

>Q) Does an evil <Myth> necessitate an evil incarnation?

A: In actuality, very few <Myths> are truly evil. Even forces that are harmful to humans like natural disasters, monsters, and conditions like famine or drought are generally not inherently evil, merely working on a completely different paradigm to mortals. As for truly evil <Myths> like representations of crimes or evil itself, while it is possible for an incarnation to change for the better after deification, it is wise not to trust them.

>Q) Can I opt out?

A. Yes. Another person will be accepted as an Incarnation of your <Myth> and you will lose all of your <Influence> and <Authorities>.

>Q) I’ve seen a lot of incarnations in my area. What’s up with that?

A. Even before the Incarnation System, all life forms still had varying levels of <Divinity>. Places on earth hold different levels of <Divinity>, and individuals with high <Divinity> capacities will find themselves drawn to places with more. Hot-spots can be as big as a country or as small as a single room.

>Q) What happens if one of the members of my <Pantheon> is eliminated? Can I still get the bonuses for assembling it?

A. In order to be considered as complete, a <Pantheon> just needs all of the <Myths> involved to be possessed by members of the <Pantheon>, even if all of those myths are possessed by a single incarnation as <Epithets>.

>Q) Is it possible to join multiple pantheons?

A. If you possess one or more epithets, it is possible to join a number of pantheons, but you can only ever inhabit one at a time.

##Enchanting System

When you wish to enchant an item, you roll a number of dice (1d10), specified by the materials and the target. The number you roll will be compared to the following scale:

0-10: Failure
11-30: Common
31-50: Uncommon
51-70: Rare
71-85: Super Rare
86-95: Legendary
96-100: Mythic
101+: ???

The first source of dice is the thing you’re trying to enchant. Enchant targets provide dice according to the following scale:

Mundane: 1
Common: 2
Uncommon: 4
Rare: 6
Super Rare: 8
Legendary: 9
Mythic: 10

Bonus dice may also be provided if you personally crafted the object, with the number of bonus dice being at least one, with additional bonus dice provided based on the quality of the item produced.

The second source of dice are Enchant Materials. Enchant Materials provide dice according to the following scale:

Mundane: 0
Common: 1
Uncommon: 2
Rare: 3
Super Rare: 4
Legendary: 6
Mythic: 7

Authority crystals provide a number of dice equal to the stored authority’s level. Generally, the properties of the enchanted item will most resemble the source of the most <Dice>, although the properties of other materials, as well as the enchant target, will affect it to a lesser extent.

>About the authority <Enchant Item>.

When an item is enchanted, a number of attempts equal to the level of the authority <Enchant Item> may be made, the highest of which will be taken.

Additionally, the maximum number of <Enchant Materials> that can be used at a time is equal to the level of the <Enchant Item> authority.

It is possible to use the result of <Enchant Item> as a target for successive enchantments.

>Example Enchant

An incarnation wishes to enchant a sword that they made themselves. The sword has already been enchanted once and is now a <Common Relic>. The incarnation has an <Enchant Item> level of three, but only wishes to use two ingredients: a Rare Relic and a lvl 2 authority crystal.

The number of dice rolled is equal to 8d10: 1 for crafting the item, 2 for the target being a common grade weapon or relic, 3 for using a <Rare> relic as a material, and 2 for the use of a lvl 2 <Authority Crystal>. The rare relic and the sword itself provide equal numbers of dice, so the resultant effect will either be a mix of the two, or decided randomly.

The incarnation gets 3 <Attempts>, one for each level. The results are as follows:

>First roll: 56

>Second roll: 36

>Third roll: 62

Thus, the highest roll of 62 is taken, creating a <Rare> relic
