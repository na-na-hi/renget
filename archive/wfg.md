/wfg/ - Write Faggotry Thread #224

Previous thread:
https://desuarchive.org/trash/thread/(FILL IN)

\>Request, write, or share stories and provide feedback/critique when appropriate. All writers are welcome, SFW and NSFW.

\>Instead of asking for interest about a fetish, just post your damn writing/request and see what happens. You might get lucky.

\>Complaining about fetishes is dumb and stupid in /trash/. Use that negative energy for requesting, reading and writing instead.

\>Please tag stories so readers know what they're getting into. Nobody can force you to tag stories you share or make. However, people are MUCH likelier to skip a work if there are no tags present.
