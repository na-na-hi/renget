Well this is the place, as far as you could tell. Gino's handwriting was rather poor, to say the least, so there was always a degree of uncertainty. Regardless, you knock on the door, and prepare for a shout.

"PIZZA DELIVERY!" Your vocal cords could use some adjustment from 3 or so years of dormancy, you think to yourself as you hear the door open. After 15 or so seconds of waiting, the door finally opens, to an unexpected sight. A lady clad only in red panties is standing at the entrance, and grabs your arm.

Before you know it, you're dragged in and the door shuts behind you. The pizza you were carrying is now lost.

"Uhh Ma'am, didn't y-you forget your pizza?" You sputter out, trying to function so close to a bare chested woman. The lady caresses your cheek, and softly speaks.

"The pizza? I don't need that anymore. I just need you." She leans in for a kiss. Her lips meet yours, her tongue locking with yours. You try to pull away, but you are overwhelmed with hormones and a sense of fear. The lady french kissing you wearing nothing but panties wasn't helping either.

She reaches for your apron's tie and unravels it, removing the apron from view. The lady goes on top of you, undoing your pants & underwear. Your penis, erect from the lady's assets and kiss, springs up.

"Absolutely lovely, Darling!" She giggles before saying. The lady pulls down her panties, revealing her vagina. After a bit of shifting, she inserts.

The walls of her womb feel like heaven, and before you know it, you spurt after 3 thrusts. "Already Darling? You must've been so eager for this." She leans in for another kiss, and resumes thrusting.

You can't help but moan in ecstasy, prompting her to begin another french kiss, one more intense than the previous one. You feel another wave coming, utterly powerless to stop it.

As much as you want this to never end, it is intangible. You let out a second spurt, showering you in euphoria.

"Darling... That was absolutely wonderful. I knew I had my eyes on the right one. Now, run along now, you still at work. Feel free to come by anytime, Sunny."

You feel a chill run up your spine. How the hell did she know your name?! But you don't have much time to dwell on that.

You have a job to do after all.
