**interest corner**

i am currently fixated to chinese + japanese movies and reading international books! my current watchlist is ... too complicated to list actually. 'm currently reading all harry potter books + rereading eleanor and park. i also like poetry so i read some of that, my favourite poet right now is emile bronte. i really like the movie entitled all about lily chou-chou and my all time favourite book is eleanor and park.

i also play games but i am like very inactive with games now! most games i play is enstars, genshin and hsr. rest are now in the backyard buried six feet under the ground! if you wanna play the games i said with me though you can feel free to hit me up whenever.

i watch animes + read manga/hwa but i stagger with it a lot too, meaning i don't engage with such media now. i usually read bl/gl + i watch psychological genre a lot. i really like serial experiments lain and i love toilet bound hanako-kun! i also like hunter x hunter, bungo stray dogs, blue exorcist and magical girl stuff (also add neon genesis evangelion... touch grass).

i like music too, most part is that i listen to whatever that piques my interest now. no biggy about it, just pure fun. my favourite band as of moment is waterparks. my favourite artists are poppy, mitski and jazmin bean. my other favourite bands are deftones, my chemical romance + etc. i purely just casually listen to them now since i have inconsistent music taste. casual k-pop listener but i will only and will only like k-pop girl groups!

i like typology but i am not currently fixated with it now as i haven't been studying that for months. i still like psychology and human behavior stuff. still interested in astronomy and biology!

my pookies are scaramouche and yugi amane. i gatekeep them just a little, but i appreciate if you don't talk much about them around me as it makes me uncomfortable, thankies!

will be adding more if ever (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)
