Just A Normal Summer by TypicalWriter
   
   You were chained to a metal cage. This happened after you woke up from a deep slumber and noticing everything around you shifted. The sand you were supposed to be on was a wooden floor and the sun that shone wasn't there. Wait...why does it smell like the sea?

   There was a massive shake and you tumbled on your back. As you sat back up, a bright light suddenly pierced into the darkness from an opened hatch and lit up your surroundings a bit. You took time to recognize it but this was somehow some sort of old ship? There was only one cage that you were currently in. Some barrels filled your left and right cage.

   "Ho ho, looks who decide to wake up at this moment, ain'tcha beauty?" said a deep, rough voice. Your eyes up and finally noticed them. 

   Oh shit, are you high? You didn't take drugs, weed or marijuana. If so what on earth is in front of you now?

   There were...sharks, crabs, squid and aquatic-and-cryptid-looking creatures before you! You thought they never exist. Moreover, they weren't in their loincloths or tribal clothing. They were pirates. Also, the huge nine-feet sharkman had a cocked hat with a symbol of cutlass crossing and a huge shark mouth wanting to bite. This dude must be the captain of this ship. There was also a buffy orca, a hammerhead, a tiger shark and a squid. From the cries and shouts, there were more on the deck.

   "Cap'n, you are making him frightened!" the orca sounded, seemed friendly enough from his light tone. You aren't frightened, you mentally said.

   The hammerhead snorted. "Shut yer maw up! He isn't just any scallywag. He fought chum like us well and bruised me damn body!" But before the orca responded the Tigershark wrapped both their maw. He gave a glare at both at them, unlikely they both obliged, still mocking each other with faces but the tiger shark just shook his head.

   However, your attention was now on the shark, definitely a "he" because of the lack of feminine features and that big bulge on his pants, he had his eyes on you as if you are something precious and priceless. The scars across his face show how much combat he had been in, oddly you just notice the musk lingering around them when you unintentionally breathe and it poking your deepest desire. You had to admit that you rarely made any contact with anyone and your acquaintances either. Mostly, you only had used toys to pleasure yourself. In anyways, you were in their mercy and anything could happen...imagine getting ravaged by these nasty beas-

   Wow wow calm yourself down, Anon. Realizing that you often attracted to non-human creatures, can't calm your stirring member either. Plus you have already some before you...if the cat is already out of the bag. 

   Suddenly, something pushed your chin up and directed it to look at the shark, baring his razor-sharp teeth, his musk was even stronger now. You gulped, trying to break contact but something behind those deadly, sharp gaze told you the opposite.

   Something formed in your stomach.

   His crew just watching you both, aware of his act. " Jolly me! A booty for meself." He stroked your left cheek with his thumb, his claw try not to damage your skin. "Plus the beauty yer bear is nothing seen before the sea. Bettin' that you are fine than any golden penny!"

   You blushed at his compliment. Did this shark flirt or value you as a things? 

  "Why am I here? Where am I?" You finally found your voice. The shark had your head in his grasp. Amused, he replied, " Yer are on me ship! Captain Gills' the Black Pearl! Haven't yer ever hear about me tale? The ocean is in me hand! How foolish of those to deal with me! I am the migh-"

   You cut in."Nope, not even once, not even in my life or from any TV or news."

   He looked surprised enough. "What? There might bein' even a little naughty tale about me. Taking away life or stealing treasure."
   You shook your head and Captain Gills held his chest, backed away and cried. "Curse those landfolk! How could they forget the mighty Cap'n Gills! Who..."

   At this point, you were too tired to hear the shark mumbling and yelling intelligibly. He is full of himself, huh? Getting kidnapped by pirates...seafolk is a new experience. This is better than the average summer you had before. Who knew what might happen then. They treated you equally. They gave food, water and even something to kill the time! You think back that they aren't the bad as they look. 
 What happened after that, including the passing days, came the unexpected.

   Let's say the ship was currently under attack by other pirates. Those pirates were tough cookies, and they were unlike species like this ship. Mammals from wolf, cow, hyena and more to be listed.

   Escaped, you grabbed anything nearby. A metal bat, surprisingly you never thought there was one, this might be their stolen when they landed. You wanted to pick up a cutlass but you doubt you might end up cutting yourself.

   You headed up to the dock as you peeked from the hatch. This was a battlefield. Some crew was limping around and deeply bleeding. Hell, there were even bodies around but you had to get used to it. You saw some wolves cornered two figures, which you learned their name before; the orca, Orky and the hammerhead, Blunt. 

   They backed against each other and held their cutlass. As one of the attackers was about to jump, something hard hit his head and he fell to the ground. His mate, about to turn also received a strong blow to his left. The last one was left dazed when a fist met his muzzle.

   "Shit, shit, ow ow," You cursed. Your fingers might break after this. While doing that, both of them had leaped and crushed you in their strong grip. They even lightly nuzzled you and kissed your cheeks which you turned into a bright tomato. Effortlessly, you tried to pry them off. When this didn't work you voiced your concern about this situation.

   "Ah! Cap'n is still in a fight! He need-" Orky almost tripped when his sore and cut stung. Blunt also tried to push his limit but you stopped them and asked them to take rest for now. They informed you that Captain Gills was still in his cabin when all this fuss happen. You thanked them as you rushed to the room. You slammed the door open when...

  Kling! Kling!

  Captain Gills was on the edge of his life, clothes tattered, fresh cuts and bruises had formed over his body. The cutlass he held was against another one. His opponent, also a shark but contrast in deep blue and he was more light. Your presence seemed absent for now. His sword clashed and more small cut appeared over his wounded body as the battle stretched. Your heart skipped a beat when the shark succeeded in blowing his sword away. When that happens, his opponent raised his sword for another slash. He shut tight his eyes, leaning back on the desk. This is the end of his mighty life!
 But it never came.

  Slowly, he opened his eyes and saw you, breathing hard with one of his stash in your hands. The bat had knocked the shark out and now was lying unconscious. You grinned at him, relieved that he was safe now, ignoring the growing pain in your body. He grinned back, being thankful that the fact you saved him. Captain Gills slowly walked to you and...the fatigue finally took over.

 Everything went pitch black in a blink. You heard the fainting voice...calling for your name. But you didn't recall anything.

 This is comfortable, the first thing you thought. Wait, why does this feel different?

 You gently lifted your eyelids, staring at the empty ceiling. Where are you?

  "Ar, yer finally awake..." the familiar voice came from your right. Blinking, you jolted upright and turned to the source. This small room looked different but magnificent and cheerful. Have you been here? It got a painting of the oceans hanging on the wall. A colorful carpet filled the floor. A small vase of flowers sat on a bedside table. Dangling, a small oil lamp that lights the room enough.

  "What...what happened?" Your head was throbbing but eventually fading away, you noticed yourself naked so you held the blanket to your chest. The sharkman was wrapped in bandages and a new set of clothes covering them. He looked worried first but quickly replaced by a joyful, shining expression. His tired eyes looked at you and held tight the edge of the blanket. Then, he dropped his gaze, looking guilty as ever.

  "Losin' yer while I in yer debt is a pirate's biggest sin, might as hell ended in David Jones' Locker ." He met his gaze with yours. "Especially a true beauty like yer..."

  You felt heat crawled to your cheeks.

  "If that is truly the case...then why are you here? Shouldn't you be with the others?" You asked, now more curious when he averted the gaze suddenly. He shifted uncomfortably on his stool, fidgetting with the blanket. He also turned red like a tomato.

 There was a pause. 

  He coughed. His decision made up and now he is going to spill the bean.

 "I..." He leaned in, his shadow dropped on you as his huge bulk blocked the light source, you could feel his breath hitched in his throat and whispered. "might have fallen in love with yer..." 

 "I knew it...it was so obvious," You snickered. He blinked at you. "Wha-"

  "All this long your reaction told it...from the start," You left him agape. He bashfully looked away, embarrassed to look at you. 
 You released a relieved sigh. This sharkman...you can't admit you are like him. You remember he gave you some gifts even though you never asked. He was so stern when some crew tries to harass you. He did numbers of good deed. There might some you never knew. You don't feel like a prisoner at all.

 Wait...why do you feel something warm touching your lips?

 The shark leaned back to his seat, looking red and grinning. He just kissed you and your mind turned blank for a second.
  "Did you just...?"

 "Sorry, couldn't hold merself for yer looking cute while in thought,"

  You raised an eyebrow. "Really? I didn't say anything yet and you just dive in?"

  He huffed and crossed his chest, puffing his cheek. "What? I can't let someone else take it before me!"

  While that, you pecked his right cheek and shockingly he rubbed the spot. "Did yer.." He bared his usual wide smile, shining sharp teeth to you. 

  "Yeah, yeah ya got it,"

  "Then it's official then?"

  You thought for a second. "Yessie..."

  You almost jumped when you heard loud cries and songs out of blue filled the room. A delicious smell invaded your nostril and your stomach grumbled annoyingly. How long were you out?

  "Oh, it looks like the crew has started throwing the party for celebrating our success." He glanced behind then to you.

  "So...yer might want to join the party? I could guess from the sound~"

  You rolled your eyes and answered. "Yeah...yeah.."

  He grabbed your hands and took you off the bed, guiding you through the door to the crew. Eventually, you had your fun and glad you were captured. When he announced your relation with him to the crew...you elbowed his chest just to knock him to his kneel. The crew laughed heartily with all their might and cut the air with a happy tone of singing and chattering.

 This might not be a bad summer at all, being with a shark boyfriend who happened to be a pirate.
