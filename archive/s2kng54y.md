Please reply to OP if you have suggestions, I'm busy most of the day. I'm sorry.
Having them be replies to OP makes it easy for me (and others) to see

A dice roll minigame, in which there are 3 treasure chests and enemies with hearts for HP.
No borrows (does NOT count as conquest- it's a "minigame")
You get to sweep after you have finished 2 laps. While you're doing them, get the hidden maps!

-----------
# The maps
**THE MAPS AND OBJECTS CHANGE WITH EACH ENTRY**
These are *examples!*

General tip is to either: A) Get a treasure finder ASAP and find the shortest route
or B) Find the shortest route to all 3 chests WITHOUT FIGHTING

Unfortunately, in map 3 you WILL fight 3 HP enemies so be prepared!

**Hidden Maps:**
Go through all the signboard tiles/nodes to get the treasure chest
DO HIDDEN MAPS ONLY ONCE, more entries to them are not worth your event points.

~~UNCONFIRMED (if it will happen in Global): Map 4 Hidden won't appear until the second week of the event.
Can someone test this and reply to OP if this isn't updated to account for that?~~

Map 4 hidden, unlock condition:

\#463898980
>Nuh uh, you have to complete a full lap and then it'll start appearing.
>I've done both hidden rooms already.

#Fighting

Breakdown:
![Fighting Breakdown](https://files.catbox.moe/xdhux4.png)

Bottom numbers: 17 and 21.
Roll 17 or higher to deal damage
Roll 21 or higher to deal DOUBLE damage (in this case if I rolled a 24 for example- 6x4 - I'd one shot this mob)
**If you roll lower than a 17 you do no damage**

Fights costs 250 event points **PER TURN**
If you die, use 600 points to revive (Can someone tell me if you die do you restore a few HP or your entire thing? For example if I had 10 max hp will i restore 10 hearts?)
If you win, you'll win an item (you'll see what it is on the bottom left of the screen)

**Mobs**: Have 2 or 3 HP, use 250 event points to fight. See fighting section above

Roll needed for success from maps 1 to 4
(I'm bad at formatting, I'm sorry)

Mob: 11**(15)** 13**(17)** 16**(20)** 17**(21)**
Boss: 12**(16)** 14**(18)** 18**(22)** 19**(24)**

Flee: Always a value of 8 or higher
Please don't flee it's literally useless. The enemy will still be on the map. If you flee from the 2nd turn and beyond, the enemy's HP will be the same. In addition you need to pay 250 event points again to refight
