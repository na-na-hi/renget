#### Technicalities: Functions, etc.
>*“No amount of genius can overcome obsession with detail.”* —Traditional
- Heh, I suppose this means that *autism wins in the end*, right Anon? :^)

*"In this chapter and the next, we change our focus from programming to our main tool for programming: the C++ programming language. We present language-technical details to give a slightly broader view of C++’s basic facilities and to provide a more systematic view of those facilities. These chapters also act as a review of many of the programming notions presented so far and provide an opportunity to explore our tool without adding new programming techniques or concepts."*
