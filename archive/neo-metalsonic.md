**Before You Interact**<-
**1)** Please don't make sex jokes around me if we just met or I don't know you that well
**2)** I go AFK or semi-AFK randomly and without warning. I'm almost always doing something, so whisper me if you want to talk
**3)** I don't check local chat, I'm always on Personal. That means that if you're offline or if I don't have you friended I most likely won't see your messages
**4)** I struggle communicating. Tone tags appreciated but not needed, unless I ask for them
**5)** I'd appreciate it if you DIRECTLY told me something I'm doing/saying is making you uncomfortable. I don't get social cues very often
**6)** I don't care about slur discourse, but I find the R slur uncomfortable
