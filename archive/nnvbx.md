Weather phenomena.

Orange and greenish-blue stripes are the usual areas of lower rainfall and above average rainfall respectively. There are areas where rainfall would depend on season and I've left some of those unmarked, sorry for inconsistency. The final climate approximation should make things a bit clearer.

New:
>Big red arrows. 
Shows the most likely path of tropical cyclones aka, hurricanes, typhoons. Tropical cyclones would start forming at the base of the arrow, and make landfall towards the tip.
>Grey area. 
Area that could plausibly have frequent tornadoes.
>Purple area.
Areas that may experience ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation). Essentially, for a few months every one or two years one of the purple areas experiences heavy storms and flooding, while the other purple area experiences droughts and heatwaves. After the extreme weather dies down both of the areas get relatively normal weather followed then by the purple areas flipping; The one that initially experienced droughts is now experiencing storms and flooding, and vice versa. Then the cycle repeats.
>Green areas.
Zones that are likely subject to monsoon circulation, where one of either summer or winter is hot and VERY wet, and the other is a bit cooler (still warm) and very dry.
>Light blue zones next to coasts
Areas affected by cold ocean currents. Expect cooler temperatures and drier climate.
>Light red zones next to coasts
Areas affected by warm ocean currents. Expect warmer temperatures and wetter climate.

Cold coastal waters are likely to be very nutrition rich, meaning that the waters next to areas affected by cold currents would be the most optimal locations for fishing.
Coral reefs would most likely form in tropical waters where a warm ocean current flows.

Next post will be climate analysis, I might do a short tectonic analysis afterwards but I'm not sure about that one yet.
