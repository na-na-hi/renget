## -> For Merit and Profit, Be Prepared <-


From the outside, the Scout Headquarters looks like an ordinary, old-fashioned family house located on the outskirts of the city. On the inside though, the impression remains, even with the heavy desk and row of chairs shuffled under the wall. Said walls were covered with posters speaking of saving the earth, reminding them to pick up their litter and the dangers of drugs and other cliches. Two small cabinets held various items used by the scouts. Amongst them were photos of groups of boys and girls, all smiling. Some are more honest than others.

Boysenberry barely spares her surrounding any attention as she sits on a random chair. The phone hangs in her hand as she slowly inhales the air through her narrow nostrils. She smells the forest wood and wet ground coming through the open window. The familiar smell helps to keep her nerves at ease. Her pretty features relax a bit.

She is a tall thing, thin and lanky, despite her constant work on her family's vineyard. Her body struggled to fill up her thin, oversized blouse and matching skirt. The most noticeable things about her are hair in the color of dark purple made into a long French Braid, fashioned after her mother's hairstyle. Sharp cesire eyes stare at the tips of her shoes.

She tries to look dignified, but she can't help it. A heavy sigh escapes her lips and she fidgets in place as her legs begin to fall asleep. Barely a second inside and she's already disappointed. Not that she has expected much, but she was still disappointed. Impressive. She snorted.

Her father made an opening in his tense schedule to personally drive for the meeting and what the so-called 'Noble Scouts' do? Nothing. No welcome committee. Not even set a secretary or any kind of reception. Don't they know who her father was?

And to think that Colton Vines the 3rd of the Goldengrape was so eager to tell her how the local scouts are a well-organized and 'fun' group. Her dad was a great man, but he could be so silly, sometimes. She let out an indignant huff through her nose. Such low thoughts are unbecoming for a such classy, young lady - that she is, of course - but she had called it - it's a colossal waste of time. She was right. She usually was. The confirmation should have left her in a good mood, but, well, a waste of time.

The next few seconds pass in silence. Happy chirps come from the outside, making her ears twitch. Despite her annoyance, she has to admit that the outside was pretty. Calm, away from the noise of the city, kind of like her home. Her tiny nose crinkles at the thought. She could have watched over the tree's fertilization, right now. Not something that people her age find interesting, she was fully aware of that, but it's her future profession. She's mature enough to know what's good for her future.

Should she just call her dad? Humor him and look for someone? Or just show her defiance and go home on foot? The day was gorgeous and she would go for a hod-dog.

Berry re-checks her phone, confirming it was getting early afternoon, then lets out a groan.

Fudge it all, Berry thinks as rouses from the chair and stretched her back. She did her part, they did not. They are at fault for not greeting her. A petty desire to leave a rather note describing this place anomie passes her mind. She almost succumbs to it, but quickly discards the idea.

After a blunder like this, her father will surely reconsider her joining the scouts. He did not raise a fool, after all.

She lifts her chin and strides purposefully towards the door, but before she has a chance to grab the rusty handle, the door clicks open. Surprised, the Violet-haired girl quietly jumps back. The door cracks as it slowly opens until sun rays pass through the shallow rift. Just big enough for a small head with a large mane of brilliant turquoise hair. A very pleasant color, Berry has to admit. And the hair looked very soft, like silk in her bed.

"Hello." A meek voice brings her back from the distraction. Her brilliant cesire eyes with soft moderate aquamarine ones. At least for the millisecond, before they jumped back behind the door like a reverse jack-in-the-box.

"Huh?" Boysenberry sounds flummoxed.

------------------

"Hey, wait up!"

The wooden door nearly bursts as Berry swings them open. With a gentle quirk of her jaw, she looks around and catches the glimpse of turquoise, as it submerges in the nearby bush.

"Excuse me-" She hears a soft yelp and the tip of the person's head sinks further into the greenery. If it was for her to guess the girl - no boy alive could have such luscious hair - was scarred or was it some kind of scout play? Camouflage or whatever silly name it has.

No matter the reason, Berry's expression doesn't grow any softer. If anything, she looks more offended. If this was the reason she hasn't seen anyone, she'll be very unhappy. She closes the small distance with an authoritative strut before digging one skinny finger into the center of the turquoise mane, making the hidden girl sweat profusely.

"Excuse me. Have no one taught you it's a polite thing to face the person that speaks to you? Get out from there, so I can see your face." She demands, angrily, while the girl makes tiny, distressed squeals. The bush bristles for a few seconds and Berry's eyebrows rise when the girl finally decides to show herself.

She was, however still quite short, though that could be a result of her abysmally hunched posture. Undoubtedly, she is quite beautiful, with a youthful girlishness.

In her simple dress, with rosy, cherubic cheeks skin, and a face that the taller girl only imagined was possible with an effort of a makeup artist or a stroke of a brush from the skilled painter, she looked younger than Berry. She was tugging at her skirt nervously and wouldn't leave her purse alone, while the strong-willed girl examined her further. In contrast, the handbag was surprisingly bright, even gaudy with multicolored sequins. Looking closer she even wore matching earrings. Two characteristic bumps on her chest, betray her age.

Her deep eyes, rimmed with light cesire stare at the scary girl as if begging for forgiveness as she says softly. "S-sorry." She has a cute, high-pitched voice, fitting her overall vibe. However, it was tense and low, trembling with fear and anxiety.

"Well? What's your name?" Berry asked, her expression stiff.

"Aq-Aquamarine, ma'm." She answered meekly.

"Speak up girl. I can barely hear you. How do you expect anyone to respect you if you can even say your name? A person needs to have pride in their name or no one else will." Her words had the opposite effect, making Aquamarine wish she could go back to the bush. The bush doesn't judge. "My name -" Berry continued her lecture and put a hand on her chest. "is Boysenberry, from the Goldengrape vineyard. See? that's how it's done."

"Ohh, I kn-know who you are." The girl, Aquamarine, says quietly, eyes darting back and forth. She was never good at looking people in the eyes. Especially not harsh people like the one in front of her. Boysenberry doesn't see it that way and takes glee that the girl has listened. Now, what did she say?

"You do?" The girl eyed Marine slowly, and a low, pleased hum escapes her throat. "Good. Means someone has good taste. Do your parents buy our brand?"

"N-no, actually. We, uhh, kind of go to the same school." The turquoise girl's lips began to tremble, her head hanging in humiliation.

"We do?" She asks and a scowl decorates her sharp face like an expensive makeover. "Huh, well then. Now that we have introductions behind us, are you mayhaps a member of the Cantelot Scouts?" Her scowl deepens when her schoolmate shakes her head.

"N-no. Ar-Are you?" The Shy girl whimpered, lowering herself back into the scrub with a tiny sniffle. "I'm sorry I'm late. My mother had overslept, and I didn't want to wake her up and we couldn't find the keys. Andandand-" she stutters uncontrollably in a panic, trying to pull it away from the conversation.

"Enough." Berry cuts her off with a finger pressed to her lips. She shakes her head vehemently, having no time for this stuttering mess of ramblings. "Good news to you. With your tardiness, you'll fit right in. Assuming you have enough patience to wait for them. I surely don't." Confused, Marine tilts her head, when she catches something in her eye. "See you at school, I guess. I'm not gonna waste my time-"

"Is the meeting over?"

"No, no. It hasn't even started, yet, and-"

"Cool. Peach Fuzz nice friend-ya!"

Berry's concentration breaks as her mind registers the new incomer. She quickly took in her form, from the top of her head to the dirty sneakers she clopped around in.

She was a walking smile. Her lips are spread so wide, it made Berry's face hurt at the view. The new girl vibrates in place, in seeming defiance to the concept of stillness. It might have something to do with the large soda can in her hand. Just when Berry notices said can, she swings it until it touches her lips. Obnoxiously loud gulps split the tranquil silence of the forest. Her white top and green shorts only added to how utterly sunny the young gal was, despite her clothes being covered in dust, and her legs covered in band-aids. Despite her initial startle, Berry's pleased to see she's still the tallest in the group.

Peach finishes her drink and a bundle of unruly hair dances in the air. Light reflects from the gold locks hitting Aquamarine in the eye, as she struggles to leave her hideout and makes her stumble. The blonde stifles a snicker. She doesn't try to hide the loud belch, however.

Boysenberry's lips curl in enraged disgust. This was exactly the kind of individual she has expected to meet here. The one thing they don't disappoint.

"How long have you been here?" Berry asks backpedaling from the girl, only to stumble into her previous collocutor, who's busy with a stray stick in her hair. She doesn't notice her falling back into the accursed bush, again.

"About a minute." The blonde shrugs and then points to her right, where a hammer car stands. Behind the wheel was a powerful build man with an open shirt, proudly showing his muscular and hairy chest. "My dad drove me here. Didn't you hear?"

"Uhhh..." The tall girl blurts out, her cheeks reddening without knowing why.

Peach didn't wait for an answer and waves her father away. "Bye, dad. See you in a few hours." The man raises his hand with a warm smile, before turning the machine on. Birds fly away from the trees startled by the noise. The Hammer makes a half circle, dust jumping in the air, stinging the onlookers in the eyes. Once the tall girl wipes the tears the man and his car are long gone.

"We're going inside or what?" She presses the -hopefully empty - can to her forehead and begins to push. It crumbles in the middle, but before it can go further, the tomboy lets it go, clutching her head. "Dang it, almost had it." She whines, giving them a toothy smile.

--------------------

"So what are we waiting for?" Let's get in! I want to know how to set things on fire!" Peach announces as she goes to the door, bumping shoulders with her own on the way. "C'mon partners, the first day of classes! I want to know how to set things on fire!" In her exuberance, she completely missed the way Aquamarine squeaks before chasing after her like a scared puppy, with a jittery bounce that made her mane dance with each step.

Boysenberry looks behind them, amazed to find herself almost excited enough to follow the lively girl back into the building. Almost. She actually wishes for someone to show up. It would be cruel to see the disappointment on the girl's face. With an annoyed sigh, she closes the door. Half the process when she hears -

"Yo! Anyone here!? We're ready to learn survival stuff!"

"Be right there!" An equally young voice answers from behind the wooden frames of the building.

Berry pauses in her tracks. She was more than ready to leave this place behind, with no regrets. Buuut, if she does it now, the moment she knew someone was present, her father might be disappointed. Besides, they might try and contact him, and worst case scenario it will snatch him from his important work. So, with a heavy sigh, the responsible girl opens the door and gets inside.

At the same time, another door opens, and a girl enters the hall. She couldn't be older than her, and there was no mistaking her for a Scout. She was dressed in a plain button-up T-shirt with a green vest over it, and a matching medium-length skirt. Her orange and yellow colored head was tipped with a beret cap with a red tongue on the side.

So this was her future costume, Berry muses. She'd certainly seen stranger fashion in her school.

"Hi, my name's Tag-a-long, the head of the Filly Squad. Stellar name, I know but in my defense, I didn't have a choice." She said with a comedic lilt in her voice, which was more than enough to put Berry on edge.

She considers the Scout girl for a few moments longer. There was no hostility to her body language; one hand was on her hip, while the other moved in a friendly wave, matching her wide smile. Her whole posture gave a welcoming, at-ease, trust-me-I'm-harmless vibe.

At least to anyone, who wasn't raised to be a businesswoman. The scout girl's shoulders are tense, her smile too wide, probably devised to put people at ease and her eyes fidgeted from person to person. It doesn't escape her attention that they settled a second longer on her that the introvert/extrovert duo. Yup, she is being appraised. And Berry knew the same is happening to her.

Hmm, interesting.

"Name's Peach Fuzz." She bumps her thumb against her breastbone, completely oblivious about the mental game of chess, and pushes Aquamarine in front of her. "And this girl I have no idea. What's your name?"

Marine feels her stomach do a flip out of sheer terror, and she glances back at Berry and then at Peach in betrayed shock. The Blonde's smile widens. The Shy girl tries to sputter out her name but only an incomprehensive mess comes out.

"She said her name is Aquamarine." Berry straightens her skirt impatiently. "And I don't think she appreciates being tossed around like a doll." She mentions, before turning to the scout girl. Behind her Peach's eyebrows rise in surprise, while Marine's cesire eyes flash with gratitude. "And my name's Bosenberry. From the Goldengrape Vineyard. And forgive my forwardness, but is something wrong or is it normal for the scouts to make their potential members wait?" She speaks very slowly, her syllables carrying an extra bite. Not explicit, but enough for those that know where to listen. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, but she was curious how this girl would react.

"Ohh, I'm sorry. I wasn't aware that someone was present." Her voice sounds stiltedly apologetic as she is fighting her own growing contempt. "It's an all-consuming task to take care of the place. I don't expect someone owning a vineyard to understand the hard work."

"You would be surprised. And I can assure you, me, my father, and our helpers always live up to the expectations." Berry points out with a factual tone, though Peavh and Aquamarine both crinkle their noses.

"Well, not everyone can afford helpers, miss. Some of us have to roll up our's sleeves and do our tasks." Tag-a-long points out in a terse tone, making Berry frown. She gives her a very pointed stare, which, counter to what Beery was trying to accomplish, makes Tag smirk a bit. "Hard work is a big part of being a scout. We never - excuse my language - half-ass in our tasks. "The sudden curse gave Berry a pause, but she doesn't let it be known, besides quick upward twitch of the corners of her lips. "Especially when we are in a tight spot. Still, we're just humans, and sometimes we just can be in every place at once. I'm sure you can understand."

Berry hums under her nose, the girl's words picking her interest. She could respect that. But on the other hand-

"So it's only you today?" Berry asks, her tone softer as she examined the girl, "No any grown-ups leading the place?" She tilted her head slightly, trying to mask her suspicion with curiosity and worry. Curiously, this girl Tag-a-long, drops her head, her voice genuinely somber.

"Yes, unfortunately. Ms. Summer Joy, the HeadScout, the best you could have wished for, had to leave because of an emergency. She had left a note explaining everything, and asking if I could after the place until the replacement arrives." Her face scrunches in thought for a moment, but that stopped when another tiny, almost-smile ghosted across Tag's face. "Shouldn't take long, though. But until then I'm responsible to keep this place running." She slaps her hands together, her trained smile back on her face. "So, in the name of the Cantelot Filly Scouts, I hereby welcome you in our ranks. Hope we can together learn, go on adventures and make memories lasting lifetimes, friends."

"YEAAHHH!"

"Hmm..."

"...maybe."

-------------

"I'll speak for everyone here and say - This must be some sort of joke."

The statement catches Tag-a-long off guard, and she slowly lowers her hands holding the green box. That's not exactly true, she did expect some objections from her new scout mates, though not this forward. Even from Braid over there. She chanced a look: the new girls' expressions were not jovial nor energetic, but raging from terrified to insulted to plain disappointed. And truth be told, Tag fully understands where they were coming from. She loved her role as a Filly Scout, every part of it, but who normally be would be thrilled to sell cookies?

"Ohh, no. I'm being completely serious." Tag continues to play the good game. They are currently in the middle of the Headquarters' big hall, a place intended for group gatherings. With an outdated large podium, it looked a lot like a theater. The trio of newbies sits on chairs, facing Tag and a table with cookie boxes. "Selling cookies is an important part of being a scout." She says, voice sounding enthusiastic. She even sells it. She puts the box away and starts to enumerate with her fingers. "It allows you to meet multiple people, increases your articulation and bartering skills, and brings joy to the people. It's very important and profitable."

"Profitable to whom? More like slave work." Berry mutters under her fingers. When she isn't pinching her nose, trying to block the horrible smell, she had her arms crossed over her undeveloped chest. She blinks slowly as she keeps crossing and uncrossing her legs in boredom.

Aquamarine sat up straight, hands on her lap, fidgeting with her purse. Her voice is barely a whisper. "Or prostitution." Berry shoots her a glance.

"I didn't sign to sell stuff." Peach was the first to speak out loud. "I wanted to do fun stuff like setting a tent, starting a fire, wrestling a bear. Not work." The Tomboy has her arms behind her head, waving her 'musk' around. As Boysenberry who sitting right next to her, she was the main victim. It's barely past afternoon, how was she so sweaty?

"Well, I'm not officially allowed to teach you how to start a fire. Safety procedures-"

"What, you don't have the necessary badge?" Peach countered, and Tag, without missing a beat, continued. She did fix her badge sash.

"And tents are in the shed." Her beret hides her eyes as she scratches her scalp. The object in her pocket was weighing more and more. "One which I don't have the keys..." She explains with a shrug, trying to brush the topic off. She can still feel them watching her, though.

The steady 'tock' of the clock filled the otherwise oppressive silence that had settled over the large space. The braided girl raises her hands, her expression neutral, if groggy, and waited to be allowed to speak. Tag's eyebrow rises. She has a feeling will be having lots of arguments with the sharp-minded girl.

"Yes?" Reluctantly she called her. She regrets it immediately.

"Do we get paid for this?" Berry inquired, counting the second until she would be allowed to go back to wasting her day reading a book or watching a movie or something. Anything than this farce. If she has to work, better if it would recompensate. That's how the world rolls.

"Well... yes... well, not directly." The Scout girl winces, trying to dredge up as many half-truths as she could that wouldn't automatically pin her as a greedy girl, looking to exploit them. "It usually goes to covering the equipment used by scouts." The words taste bitter in her mouth.

"What are we even doing here?" The Violet-haired girl stands abruptly, and Tag feels her spine automatically straighten. "Clearly, there's nothing for us to do. None of us wishes to waste our day, walking around town, asking people if they wish to buy cheap confectionery goods. Besides how boring and most likely ineffective it would be, it feels like a horrible cliche. I appreciate the effort, Tag, " She says, her tone contradicting her statement. She couldn’t help but twist the knife a little further, couldn't she?" but until someone with more 'clearance' shows up, we're better to be leaving now." She plants her hands on her hips and stares at the Orange-haired girl. Their eyes meet, matching in intensity. Tag's knuckles pop from her tightly clenched hands. Besides her Tag sees Peach clicking her tongue in agreement.

The Head Filly scout had the privilege of a few minutes to find a solution. Shuffling on her heels, she glances from Berry to Peach Fuzz, to Aquamarine and only the timid girl looked like she didn't want to storm out of the building. Feeling defeated she rubs her arms and sighs. The kind eyes of Mrs. Joy bore into her head from the back of her mind. She would be so disappointed.

She should have known better, she thinks reaching into her pocket. She'll just tell them she'll look again at the office, and then that she found the keys. That way she could at least entertain them somehow, and hopefully, they won't opt out.

Her lips part when the doors crack open and four occupants turn to see who comes to interrupt. At first, they think it was a group of people judging from the heavy cracking of the wooden floor and the size of the overall form, peeking through the slit. The wooden frames part further, and a blonde form bursts out, growing into a person taller that the door.

The young girls blink in unison. Their eyes roam over what seems like miles of brown skin peppered with freckles. She was absolutely massive!

Her shoulders are so broad they could fit on a male bodybuilder but are balanced by the rest of her physique. A full set of tits that wore the same light freckling as her cheeks, and plump rump, wrapped in short daisy dukes, leaving her toned, strong legs exposed before they disappeared into calf-high cowboy boots. Her arms, legs, and stomach are forged with thick, hard muscles glistening in the sun falling from the window. They shift enticingly as the woman shifts her grip on a back she buried in her golden fountain of hair. As if the figure wasn't intimidating enough, the cowgirl's hat casts a dark shadow over her eyes, leaving only her plump smiling mouth visible.

"Are those real?" Aquamarine whispers in her face and ears an adorable shade of pink

The girls jump, as the amazon drops her load to the floor; a lock of her gorgeous, shimmering golden hair falls over her face. The Woman runs her fingers up her face, lifts her cowboy hat, and has stunning green eyes run over the tiny people.

"Howdy."

----------------

Once the introductions were over and each girl was back in their seat, each with a glass of milk, Applejack lays her wide hands on her spacious hips. She breathes in the air of the theatre hall. Years later and she still remembers the smell. Her eyes has been roaming all over the place ever since she had arrived. It didn't change much, besides the overall vibe. The paint was bleaker, the wood of walnut blanched and she saw plenty of cracks on the walls. Good old Quarters could use a bit of renovation. There is also the fact it lacked people. in her memories, the Headquarters always bustled with activity. Now only 4 girls with only three of them in uniforms.

While the Rustic Gal tries to make sense of the place, her new wards stare at the amazonian beauty dressed like for the cover of dirty hoedown magazine. Tiny daisy dukes an inch from becoming panties, flannel shirt stretched to the limit, only supported by her own green sash bursting with badges. Tag convinced herself she was trying to count and recognize each one. It was hard to move the four she had classified.

"What did she say her name was?" Peach Fuzz imperceptibly ribs the orange-haired girl and whispers the question.

"Applejack." Tag, now seated alongside them, answers, not taking her eyes away, as if the mountain of a woman would disappear if she did. "She used to be a Filly Scout when she was our age. Mrs. Summer Joy mentioned her a few times. Heard she lives on a farm."

"Does every scout ends like that?" Unlike the other three, Peach Fuzz is unashamed to stare at a woman's bulging muscles. Until today she had thought her daddy was the biggest and strongest. Now? Now she isn't so sure. She will need to make them arm wrestle.

Besides her, Berry's ears twitch at the sound of the name. She scratches her chin as if it might jog her memory. Applejack, Applejack, where did she hear that name- a metaphorical bulb lights over her head.

"I'm sorry. Miss? Are you not from the Sweet Apple Acres?" The Slender girl raises her arm, not asking but demanding attention. Her efforts shake the buffier woman from her contemplation. A person with her posture and might logically shouldn't have such a lovely blush.

"Why yes, I am." The Apple girl answers her family-friendly smile broadening. She grabs the edge of the weathered hat and tips it to them, elbow-bumping the side of her breast. Her eyes flash with sudden recognition. "And your name is Boysenberry, right? Aren't you from the Goldengrape farm? Daughter of Colton Vines?" Her nostrils flare. "The guy that tried to buy our land that one time?"

"The Vineyard." Berry's braid bristles at the wrong choice of words. "And I am. If you've changed your mind, I'm sure the offer is still on the table. If you wish I can give a memorandum to my father and-

A noise like a well-tuned piano vibrates through the hall. "Sorry sugarcube, Apple Acres do better than ever. " Her face takes a nostalgic expression, gazing into the empty space behind them. "Ever since we've made some changes."

"That's a shame." She spurts out, then covers her mouth with a hand. Milk spills slightly over her right hand. "That's not what I meant. I-"

"It's fine. I know what you meant." Applejack assures her, a delicate look over her features.

Berry eyes the woman slowly, carefully, her ears color and she wipes her manicured hand. Wine, yes, and apology wine is in order.

Sensing an occasion Tag decides to take the lead. She straightens her back and squares her shoulders like a soldier. "Miss Applejack. I just wish to say, thank you. It an honor to meet a veteran like you." She clutches the glass in her hands. "I'm sorry, but I couldn't find a key to the shed and, uhmm..."

"Pleasure's all mine, Sugarcube." Her nod says everything; hair tamed in long heavy braid wavers around her. The fellow braid girl can't imagine how long it took to grow them. And keeping them tidy must be an all-time job. "And doncha worry about the equipment. I have enough stuff for five times of ya." She kicks the massive backpack. It bursts and a metal pole, ropes, a book, and some long plastic object spill on the floor. "Honestly, I was ecstatic to hear from miss Summer Joy, that I might have overdone a mite. " She sighs, rolls her wide shoulders, and gives her wards a determinated look.

"So, Girl, I'm not that good with words." She begins, drawing everyone's attention. Standing in a more composed manner she pours herself a glass of milk from the heavy metal pitchers. The container reaches to her knee but the colossal woman has enough dexterity and strength to maneuver it with childish ease. "I simply lack the skills to properly describe how essential this 'club' can be to teach the values of loyalty, camaraderie, hard work, and honesty. A lot of people might find the group a silly waste of time or nothing more than a convenient way to drop their kids off to someone so their parents can have time to rest. Well, trust me when I tell you that what those people think is nothing but a huge pile of swine droppings. You'll never find a better way to form bonds lasting for life, a better place to learn valuable skills to survive, not only in the wilderness but so in the big city." Her mothery hips swing as she slowly makes her way toward the listeners. Captivated by her speech each girl leans forward ever so slightly. "In Scouts, they'll teach you perseverance, overcoming adversaries, and willingness to serve your fellow man or woman."

She hovers over them. As if the intimate situation wasn’t complete enough already, she leans forward, the two soft pillows she dares to call breasts, press themself into Berry and Fuzz's sides. Heat radiates in waves, spreading over the bunch of misfits. She raises her glass in the air, four smaller ones mimicking her. "So, in the name of Cantelot Filly Scouts - welcome you in our midst Hope we can become a family as tight as the Apple Family." She finishes and swings her arm to her lips, four glasses mimicking her actions.

The next minutes pass in a blur. The cool, creamy milk splashes down the young teenager’s throat. And once she starts it was impossible to stop. She drinks gluttonously. Moans echo in the empty space of the pseudo-header. She couldn't differentiate between hers and her companions, neither she cared. This milk is just too delicious to think about anything other than the overwhelming sweetness and fatty thickness.

She only stops when the vessel is drained and she couldn't feel the cool liquid entering. Her mind clears. Her belly feels full and nourished and good and surging with energy. Her legs close at the mere memory of the experience.

Her tongue rolls out on its own, swiping any leftovers sticking to the glass and when she can't find any more she spares a glance to her companions. She feels a swirl of envy when she sees Aquamarine, drinking as greedily as her but her glass was sonehow still half-full. She glances right and sees Tag-a-long fingering the glass, scooping droplets from the container; she finds it desperate but follows suit. She looks at Peach and -

"Where's your glass?" The thirsty girl asks, before sucking on her index fingers, tongue scrapping the sharp, violet nails.

"Ehh." Peach shrugs, with a roll of her shoulders. "Not much of a fan of milk. More into sodas. Took a sip and gave it to miss puppy eyes over there." She rolls her hands. "Almost ripped my hand off with it, too."

Berry's brows knit, in anger. Why didn't she give it to her? She is ready to fight for it but the shy girl has already moved further away and finished her undeserved fill.

Luckily for Aquamarine and all her family, the newly appointed Headscout spoke out saving her from Berry's wrath.

"Now, who wants to learn how to tie up a grown-up hog?"

--------------

"So!" Headscout Applejack clasps her hands in front of his face with an excited quirk of her prodigious chest. Silence fills the room as the low murmur of conversation dies as if all the junior scouts just remembered she's still here. She reaches behind her back, hand sinking in godly hair, and produces coils of rope. Heads tilt curiously. "Any volunteers?" She asks, muscles in python arms bulging as she snaps the rope.

Tag and Fuzz's hands shoot up immediately and they stare up at her instructor intently, while Marine dips her chin to her chest, trying to hide behind the wall of turquoise hair. The Walking traffic of a woman looks along her wards. The oldest Scout extends her arm further, begging whatever forest spirits that inhabit the Everfree forest that Applejack will pick up her. It is her time to show everyone that she deserves the title of the Filly Scout. If she could impress someone like Applejack, maybe she could become the general junior scout! Her heart flutters when the hand settles in her direction.

"I propose Peach Fuzz." Boysenberry speaks up. Everyone looks at her. Even Aquamarine peaks between her bangs. "To take the role of the hog." She explains, with a neutral expression, but her voice carries a teasing lilt, which was more than enough to cause Tag's entire body to turn a heated shade of red.

"Why is that?" Aj inquires with a curious quirk of her eyebrow.

"Yeah, why me?"

"Because you gave up your milk to the wrong person~" She all but coos in a whisper, and Fuzz quietly wonders what she has to be so dramatic over. "Because for the best opportunity to learn we would need a demonstration on a live subject aka a guinea pig." She explains her reasoning. "And from the four of us, Peach here has the most compact body, perfect for a wide variety of knots. Besides that, the little clothing she wears won't get in the way. It will additionally benefit."

AJ is silent, eyebrow raised, interested in what the analytical girl had to say. She mulls over her words, and there was logic to them. There was nothing to raise against her, but still... The way she spoke, her confidence, and her body language. It felt like she was talking with Rarity when she used that scheming mind of hers. She loved that gal, but she could be devious at times. She wasn't one with the final say, however.

"What do you say, Peach? You don't have to if you don't want it." She blonde tosses her a smile brimming with support.

The tomboy wordlessly looks around. Tag is fuming with a pout, her arms crossed. Her face looks almost as tense as the white T-shirt containing her bust. Bosenberry meanwhile looks unperturbed. In fact, she looks pleased as she plays with that ridiculously long braids of hers. Looking past her the busty shy girl behind her squeaks.

"Nahh, I'll do it." Peach resigns to her fate, raising and stretching her legs out so she could lean way forward and pinch her big toe, a few vertebrae popping and making her purr contently. She purrs at how good it feels. "But I call dibs on the next activity." She thumbs her sternum. "I want to know how to start the fire."

"Tell you what." She hands her the rope. Applejack reaches out and ruffles short blonde hair with her hand. "How about we make a barbeque later this week."

This puts the tomboy in a great mood. Her lips slowly rise into a savage grin A chance to burn stuff AND good food? You can't help but love this woman. She hops off from her place, raises her palm to the tanned woman, and high-fives her with a whipping slap. She puffs herself up, beaming like a sun.

"If she gets to be a hog, then I call dibs to tie her up." Tag-a-long said in a voice that's oozing with demand. She stretches her spine, and struts toward them. All her focus is centered on the temporary Headscout, but she keeps the blasted Violethead at the edge of her vision.

"Hey now, that's the spirit. She's all your partner." She hands Orange girl her rope, not bigger than her index finger. It was amazingly light and soft, completely different than their regular ropes. Seeing her wonder Applejack speaks again.

"Special kind of rope. Perfect for binding; won't cut your skin or anything like that."

Tag nods.

"Now." Applejack reaches behind her back, she struggles for a bit, but eventually, she manages to uptear the object from the ass pocket. She hands it to Tag whose blood drains from her face. In front of her was a book. It's old, worn out, and different from the one she owns, but there's no mistaking it - The Scout Guide. "Pick up the type of knot. Whichever you like. Don't be ashamed to choose an easy one, we all have to start somewhere. And don't be ashamed to pick a hard one, either, we're here to learn."

Slowly, Tag's finger touch the olden time, like it was the holiest of bibles. Her digits run up and down the ancient biding. Her nostrils quiver at the smell of a long-forgotten book recently retrieved from the depth of a closet. As if reading her mind AJ rolls her eyes. "I'm not that old." She thinks

Tag shuffles through the pages, delicately to not destroy the priceless treasure.

"Page 69." Applejack informs her. It's easy to find a page. And Tag begins to drink in the pictures and instructions. There were knots she wasn't familiar with. The old scout had a much wider selection of knots, the young girl thinks as her cheeks turn a deeper shade of red as she reads. There were even ones designed for people, they look complicated but... She reads for a minute until her eyes are set on a peculiar binding. "This one."

"Hmm, interesting choice. You sure you can manage?"

Just seeing the spark of confidence in her eyes was enough to make Amazon smile proudly. The tag pulls at both ends of the rope and stares at her 'hog'.

"Turn around." Her words carry an ordering note. It's so out of the normal range of her voice it even gives Berry a pause. With her previous boldness subdued, Peach reluctantly does as she's told. The Scout girls start with a simple double-column tie to bring the tomboy's arms together. She takes a moment to appraise the girl's arms. She's not muscular by any means but it was easy to trace lean, slim muscle, under her sunkissed skin. She definitely liked to put up some work. Tag flexes her arms, and her sleeves strain under the sudden pressure. They were made from the same cloth, and her obsessive work in the scouts provided plenty of options to work out. Perhaps hers are a little more defined.

Tag wraps the rope around the shapely limbs and pulls at the rope, maintaining the tension. The girl flinches as her shoulders fold backward, making the Orangehead's body tingle in a rather pleasant way. Right now, the dauntless girl was in her hands. She could do whatever things to her. Depending on if she went further or left the rope, she would be practically armless, on her mercy. A weak purr escapes her throat as she feels the tingles spread out across her arms and torso. The rope floats and moves around making the knots tighter and tighter. Fuzz bravely endures but a sweat gathers on her back.

Experimentally, she moves her arms, and they barely move. And that knowledge brings up an unexpected rush of powerful sensation. Suddenly the knot tightens. It's only after, she understands how lucky she was that her moans sounded a lot like squeaks.

Tag decides it's time to take care of the joints. The fact makes her mind clear a little. She did NOT want to fuck up joints! Delicately she takes her time to dress the wraps, running her fingers below them. Well-kept fingernails scrap the skin sending chills up the tomboy's spine.

The resulting wrap is a tidy set of blinded arms. She repeats the process to create more cinches. Not a shoddy job, Tag thinks wiping sweat from her forehead and examining her work. A warm and fuzzy sensation tickles in her center. She wouldn't show it but she was nervous about what Applejack would say. Her silence is its own kind of nerve-wracking in its own way but took as a prompt to go further.

Ignoring every lesson about personal space, the possessed girl leans forwards. Soft chest meets the gently defied back muscles. Neither finds it unpleasant. Both girls locked in the intimate position hold their breath. The girl in charge is first to let it out and wash over Peach's ear and shoulder, both reddening from the cool touch.

"Not too tight?" A little frisson of excitement runs up her spine as the words leave her lips. Peach's head jerks refutingly, her body raising to the balls of her feet.

Tag revels in the reaction and slides her fingers over her arm, across her chest bringing rope with them and appreciating the tomboy's aesthetics. But job first - this technique requires the 'subject' to have, well, breasts, which the poor girl simply lacks, so she has to improvise. No brainer, she just mirrors her previous action and finishes by tying the rope behind her.

The process is quick and methodical. It takes the binding girl a moment to notice she has finished. She backs away from her partner, released from the pressure jump and jiggle straining the button of her shirt. One button decides enough is enough and quits its job. Cool air waffles over the overheated mounds.

"Marvelous job, Sucarcube!" Applejack announces and slaps the blushing girl's back. Tag blinks, and elation replaces confusion as the head scout rubs her back. She blushes deeper and rubs her arms. "How does it feel, Peachy? Want me to take it off for ya?"

"It feels... weird. Not bad, really." She explains trying to make a sense of what just happened. "I think I'm good."

"If you say so." She ruffles Tag's hair. "Great job, Long. That looks like A+ a knotting badge material to me." She winks.

It makes Tag-a-long curls her toes, makes her heart race, and her eyes light up. She grins like a little girl on Heartwarming Eve.

"Well, can't give you one now, but wait until tomorrow and I'll think of something." She scratches, her voice apologetic as one can get out of a body like hers.

Tag nods enthusiastically and turns around on her heel and her legs began to carry her forward without her needing to think about it. She casts a glance to stare at Boysenberry and the happy girl rolls her long tongue mockingly.

------------------

Boysenberry uncrosses her legs and tosses her violet braid over her shoulders. She stands up and begins to leisurely strut towards the tied girl. With each step, she treats the onlookers with the hypnotic swaying of both her hips. She might lack the child-bearing width and the bountiful chest of the Amazon, but she doesn't worry about it. Her mother ensnared her father; The lesson she came up with was that men look past the tit and ass. With the right attitude and class, she can make up for her petite body.

The sharp girl's eyes drag over the guidebook and then to her teacher's overshadowing chest. Berry is a tall girl for her age at least, something she takes pride in. And now that same pride was being put to a test. Chest, hips, height, face, hair - this Woman, with a capital W, had it all, Even her musculature didn't make her less feminine, Berry musses starring at the undernboobage and the valleys of her abs. With a heavy heart, she places a hand on her chest. Bigger assets wouldn't hurt.

"Did you choose, Berry?"

She shakes her head and composes her heart. Just because she had blown in the gene pool lottery doesn't mean she should let our guard down.

She places a delicately manicured nail on her slightly puffy lower lip caked with lipstick. Peach had her arms and chest tied, not much work for her there. All's left is-

"This one." She informs and exchanges the book for rope and struts toward her partner. The two stare at one another for a moment before Berry places her thin hand over Peach's fast-beating heart. The Tomboy wonders why is her being chest appraised a second time on the same day before being shoved back. She stumbles nearly falling over before Berry manages to catch her by the shirt. As quick as she was to catch, the tall girl lets her crash onto her ass.

"Turn around." Berry orders, the tone of her voice much more fitting her than Scout girl. Dark marks around her eyes make her face look much more menacing. She's not like her. She doesn't have to live in a lie to be respected. She-

"Berry." The girl in question freezes when a heavy hand settles on her arm. She chances a look. Miss Applejack's expression is not jovial nor energetic, but one of reprimand and thoughtfulness. He looked at her with large green eyes as she sets her fists on motherly hips. The headstrong gal gulps, under the scrutinous daze, making her breasts sway. Her voice is calm but carries a dangerous note in it. "I appreciate the enthusiasm, but treat your friends with care."

"Yeah! Just because I'm not a porcelain doll, doesn't mean you can be a rugby ball." Peach says sounding angry, Berry ignores her, however, too trapped by the green eyes, poking behind the massive mounds. Her legs tremble at the reprimand. Her hand easily finds her long braid, and silently she starts counting plaits to calm her nerves. Her eyes trace a pattern in the woman's freckles to try and stop herself from replaying the moment in her mind again and again.

"Right, my apologies. To you, Headscout, and to you Peach." She tries to ignore the indignant snort. She kneels, next to her fellow teenager. The way her hand rests against Fuzz's thigh just inches away from the girl's puffy lips, brings the Tomboy's attention to the burning sensation, between her legs. Berry rubs the inside of her legs and the heat radiating from the place Berry's covered tit meets her bare skin, only stokes her own fire, making her melt. "Would you be so kind and turn around?" She requests breathlessly.

Slowly, Peach nods and does as she's being asked, careful not to rub herself off. She loses her balance and her chest slides over the thick floor. Damn it, now her nips are burning, too.

With Peach in place, Berry has the chance to do her task. And appraise the Wild girl's behind. And by her grandma's Naan, is she allowed to be jealous? Peach Fuzz lives up to her name, sporting perfectly shaped orbs. Combined with the tightness of her green booty shorts, there's little of her ample bottom left to the imagination. It's not the biggest ass but compared to her compact body it's an ideal shape for her.

Her thighs not far behind her, well behind, are built with young, feminine muscle coated with lingering baby fat. And what they lack in length they makeup with firmness. The curtain matches the drapes and her legs match her ass. Berry can't help but lick her lips when the Ass girl shakes her body to fix her position. Ohh, this was too much.

Her hand comes swiftly down upon the immaculate ass. Before any of the Observants can question it, Berry's palm connects with the straining fabric, sending a stinging sensation up the nerves.

"Bitch! What gives?!" Peach shouts.

"Sorry Peachy. It was an accident." Her laugh speaks otherwise. Steam flares from the spanked girl's nostrils. "I just couldn't help myself. Your bottom was just begging to spanked."

Before she could bite the Spanking Bitch's ankles, a burst of melodic laughter echoes in the hall.

"Take that as a compliment, Sugarpeach. That is a fine butt." Applejack praises and slaps her own behind. The slap echoes through the closed space like a whip. "Apple Family worthy I would say."

Hearing the kind words, the Sunkissed girl presses her face to the floor trying to hide the growing blush on her face. Berry hears Peach fumbling something about a silly thing like 'asking for permission' under her nose. Foolish girl, slaps are best when the girls don't expect them.

Ultimately, Boysenberry decides it's time to get to work. Work hard and people will respect you as her father says. The binding she had chosen is called - Spiral Futomomo. It starts with a Single-column tie around the ankle; not that different from the kind one of the Vineyard helpers taught her. Then you need to run the rope to the outside of the upper leg. Close the leg and keep wrapping, until there's no more leg. Then begin doing Crossing Hitches from both sides.

Berry had specifically chosen this knot because it reminded her of the same method she does her own hair.

Once the right leg is done, Berry spares a moment from her work to pet her hair. With a twist of her head, her braid grows as it lands in her hand. They were impossibly silky and luscious to touch. It takes forever every morning to wash and make them into the distinctive braid her mother had taught her, and sometimes, very rarely, she thought about cutting them. It was so easy to get them dirty when she tends the grape trees on her Vineyard or when her father teaches her how to preserve, spice, and bottle their wine, but damn it all, her hair was a gift to the world! It deserves the best shampoos, conditioners, and ornaments.

Gleaming gems and flowers of berry pop into existence between the thickening strands of the deep violet. Berry's finger gets stuck in a golden loop as she decides to go back to work.

Nerves eased after the previous leg, Berry is confident enough to spare enough attention to appraising the girl again. Peach's legs are hard and healthy, but they lack in length. This must be aggravating, Berry ponders. There is something about looking down at people, that makes her bristle with excitement. She can not imagine how it is to be so short. Well, short perhaps is a too strong word, Peach is a common height, it's just that everyone else in this group is taller than her. Her eyes flutter around; yes besides the towering amazon that is the rustic woman, the Violet-haired girl was the tallest she notices with glee growing in her chest.

The last hitch and Berry's gaze lands on the girl's shoes. Brand new running shoes, that add perhaps a centimeter or two. Some might call it an overkill or an inferiority complex but she prefers to wear high heels whenever she wasn't watching the Vineyard. Soft hum, escapes her throat. Where Miss Applejack buys her heels? Cowboy boots are not her style, but her heels look very practical.

Last one pull of the rope and her work is finally done. Hands keep grabbing Peach's ankle, while Berry methodically examines her work. With a satisfied click of her tongue, Berry backs away.

"There." She stands puffing her chest and pointing at her work.

"Let me see." Wood bends under Applejack's steps. It creaks louder when her knees bend. "Fine job, Berry-girl. My, was that your father who taught you?"

Berry's lashes flutter at the mention of her father. "Kind of. Had a lot of experience." She tosses her heavy braid so it can lay on her shoulder. "I believe I'm pretty good at it. Peach tries to loosen the knots."

"Fine. But not because you're ordering me." She protests and starts struggling with the binds. She jerks and tosses, knots, and muscles bulge straining until-

RRRIIIIPPPP

Time stands still as the two tallest girls stare at the gaping hole in the girl's shorts.

"Why my butt feels cold?"

----------------

"This is freaking embarrassing." Peach Fuzz speaks into the air. She is far from her usual ball of energy and excitement. She couldn't help but wonder what kind of puns those two would come up with once Applejack was outside the hearing range. Nicknames like Peach Ass or something equally stupid... "This isn't my day..."

"Hey now, Sugarpeach. Don't be so gloomy. These things happen." Peach does her best to look at the Headscout face, which wasn't easy when your hands and legs are so thoroughly tied up. It's even harder when her teacher has breasts large enough to eclipse the Sun. The Statuesque Woman adjusts her flannel top, exposing just a touch more of her bounteous cleavage. Just enough for her large brown nips to poke past the edge of the fabric. "Why, when I was your age Ahh been growing out of my dukes on weekly basis."

"...Really?" It sounds ridiculous, but looking past the thunderous thighs, Peach remembers with who she's talking with.

"Why, I had a whole phase when I walked with nothing over my buns. Uff, I sure fried them up to nice dark color." Before the Peachass girl can respond, the Towering woman pulls at the hem of her micro shorts. They are so tight that once they pass a certain threshold around her protruding ass, they roll down like spring-loaded window blinds and Peach is greeted with the sight of moist pussy lips, glistening in the dim air.

If Peach was blushing before, now her face would make some apples pale by comparison. So juicy... The bold woman rolls her hips in a hypnotic manner, a drop of juices staining the blue fabric, then without warning she whips her hip to the side, sending Peach's gaze to land back at the girls. Their eyes did not meet. Tag and Boysenberry's stares are fixated further on the side, on her tightly outlined backside.

"Still do that when feels like it. Recommend you do the same."

Peach says nothing, but if the wiggle of her backside is an indication, Applejack knows she helped this girl discover a new way of life. Good, be proud of what your mama gave.

"Ipp!" AJ drags her eyes to the source of the girlish, distraught squeak. Aquamarine is shaking harder than a poodle pooch in the middle of a rainstorm and sits next to a place Her expression is a mask of pure nervousness and terror.

Applejack looks up at her. She was sitting on her knees, trying to start her knot. The young girl's posture is still atrocious: slouched shoulders, a bent spine, and hands holding the rope as if trying to use it as a shield to protect her chest. Well, guess it would do a better job than that tiny dress with a plunging neckline. It looked like it was made for someone much more older than her. Not that she lacked in the chest department; Aqua has the udders of someone much older. Not bimbo worthy, yet, they do hold a promise.

That's actually something AJ had found peculiar. The girly looks skinny like she hadn't eaten in a while. Or as if her breasts sucked every nutrient in her body making them dwarf anything else that the young had or wore.

The look of conflicted frustration moved over Applejack’s face. Aqua was having a problem with her knots. She had chosen, unironically, one called Peach Harness, the kind that goes over a person's hips and ass. Perhaps she thought it would make the Blonde girl happy after her little accidents. Bless the girl's heart, but Applejack will have a funny story to tell her granny later this day.

Her tiny hands are shaking as she tries to wrap the rope around the crotch, but her fingers slip and graze the delicate spot. The string lands on the floor. Again. Marine balls her fists and hides her face in the little, private space made out of her long hair.

The Rustic girl silently closes her eyes and takes a breath. She was not a teacher, neither she had much experience with kids. Mostly her sister and her friends and kids of whatever branch from the Apple Family when they came for a visit or for the Reunion. What would Pinkie do - no scratch that. She might be good with kids, but kid like this one. What would Sunset do? The Redhead gal has a way with practically everyone. She is a wizard with words, but also her attitude and body language. She could charm even a hardest nut into a bed with a flick of that silver tongue of hers. She asked her about that once and she said it was just a matter of picking the right strategy to the right person... And then it dawns on her. The answer was so obvious she felt stupid for not thinking about it right away - what would SHE do if it was Fluttershy in front of her?

"Hey, girls. Mind doing me a favor?" She calls to the staring girls. They try to look casual, but it is obvious they are bored out of their minds. At the sound of her voice, Tag-a-long jumps to her feet, her spine straightens to the such degree it must hurt the little scout. Berry-girl beside her is less enthusiastic, but she stands up as well. "Could you take my backpack to the office? I would like to help Marine over there, and she might be more receptive with fewer people. Give me a moment with girls."

How her head doesn't fall off her shoulders is a mystery to AJ. Compared to her Berry gives a simple quick nod and heads towards the backpack. Seeing two girls dragging a load bigger than them makes AJ chuckle softly. She waits until they are out of sight and begins her strut toward the struggling girl. Careful not to startle the Shy girl, Applejack keeps her voice as calm and warm as possible.

"Marine." Her efforts barely work as the girl pops into an upright, rigid position as she listens in utter terror, sweat pouring down her back. Geez, the girl is even more skittish than Shy, AJ thinks. "Mind if I give ya a hand."

Aquamarine cautiously watches through her bangs. The woman towering over her was giving her the warmest smile ever and her eyes had nothing but kindness and support to offer. There was no shouting, no passive-aggressive remarks, or envious looks directed towards her. The simple goodness makes her heart go into overdrive.

It doesn't hurt that the kind woman was so pretty. She never would have thought one could grow to such sizes with professional aid, she thinks as her eyes roamed the burly body, more than once stopping to admire the massive orbs of fat. Her mother would rage if she saw Applejack.

Aquamarine gulps, loudly. You're a Scout now. The woman in front of you is your friend, she motivates herself and nods quietly.

Taking the invitation, the giant Cowgirl shifts her position. And in a way that Aquamarine couldn't have predicted. With one step of titanic legs, Applejack was right behind her, casting a gigantic shadow over her tiny frame. Her massive hands snake under her armpits lifting her up from the ground like one might pick up a puppy from the ground. Normally, Aquamarine would recoil and flinch at the intimate contact; large manicured fingers dug into the space where her chest and breasts meet, but instead of panicking, the puppy analogy holds and her whole body goes rigid. She whimpers as an itch spreads from the places where she was touched.

Roughly a minute later Aquamarine is sitting, on the Aplejack's lap. Even her shining boots has been discharged, to maximize the skin-on-skin contact. Instinctively, her tiny legs knead her 'seat'; her legs fall into that weird in-between of hard and soft. As if it wasn't enough, her back was brushing against the massive, hot, impossibly soft pillows the bronze woman calls breasts. The Shy girl was stiff as a board, making a semiconscious effort to not graze against the rock-hard nipples.

I'm sitting on someone's lap, the stunned girl thinks. Not even the normal 'someone's', but an authentic giantess' lap! Possibly the biggest girl that had ever and ever will live. The situation wasn't tragic, they still have clothes on -sort of - and they aren't alone, and it is not nighttime, but the chance of the Headscout sliding her hands between her legs is-

A gentle touch That is all it takes. When fingers begin to stroke into turquoise locks, Aquamarine goes stiffer than she already was, only to gradually relax as Applejacks works her magic with the glorious mane, until the girl practically swoons in the caring woman's embrace. Gently the motherly woman pushes her head backward directing the Timid girl towards the ample bosom until she can lay her head.

Aqua closes her eyes and allows AJ to do as she pleases with her mind and body, all while sinking deeper into the soft canyon. She breathes in the scent of apples, hay, and cinnamon. She listens to the steady beat of a heart bigger than her head, and lets warmth spread into her limbs, melting her into an easy to form putty. The moment stretches, and Marine hopes it will never end.

Peach meanwhile cast a glance to see what is taking so long. She finds view it's quite comical, as there was a huge change that might get lost Aqua in the curves.

Eventually, AJ decides her ward was relaxed enough for the next step. She prays that her sessions with Fluttershy will work here. She tugs at the neckline of the simple pink dress and Aqua's breath becomes shaky. The action stops for a sec when AJ senses her anxiety. Through the haze, Aqua composes her thoughts.

Why is she so scared? She is with Miss Applejack. It's okay if Miss Applejack looks at her. It's okay if she undresses her. It only means her body was worthy of being admired. Just like all those ladies in her mother's magazines. The look so pretty on the covers. With their fake assets and expensive accessories, they seem so confident, so proud of themselves. Marine wants to feel proud of her body too, not embarrassed.

"That's right, Sugarcube. It's Ok. There's nothing to be scared of. Get comfortable and let me do my work on this scrumptious body of your." Applejack cranes her neck forward and pours sweet words into her ears.

With another shaky breath, Marine feels the dress straps get pulled away from her shoulders. A rush of cold air on her exposed skin makes her shiver and makes her nipples get erect.

"My, aren't you excited little lady." Applejack risks a tease reaching out and grabbing at one of Aqua’s breasts. Slowly, her finger makes small teasing circles around her hot pink aureola. The teased girl shivers, as the tip of her Headscout’s fingernail sinks into the pliable expanse of her chest. "My, what a wondrous body you have, sugarcube."

The kind words echo in her mind. In truth, she was at odds with her body since her lady parts started to grow beyond the size of her peers. People could be so mean! Just because she was better developed made her an object of jealousy and mockery. Memories flood her brain. Whenever a girl called her tits for brains or tits on a stick. The particular memory of a girl roughly slapping her chest after a PE makes the fine hairs on her neck brush against one another with a mixture of terror and erotic energy.

Hmmm, she was so mean. So angry. But not as angry when she saw her boyfriend salivate over her, after she 'accidentally' spilled her drink over her chest. Aqua struggles for air as her tits grow heavier and heavier in the Cowgirl's hands. Ohh, she made him regret his unfaithful act. It felt right to see them.

The Innocent girl hisses, and her thighs spread a little as one hand drops to her crotch to tease it through the thin fabric. But the best part was after that. The mean girl become an object of ridicule for her so-called 'friends'. They couldn't go a day without reminding her about the event. Her pelvis surges forward, legs spreading to accommodate her hand. The hem of the dress rises revealing an expanse of the pink, thick thighs so different from the previous pair.

Soon a pair of large, calloused fingers join her own.

"Atta girl. That's a proper bimbo gal." Applejack's enhancing influence was in full effect by this point. She squeezes straight into the young teenager’s pussy with two curious fingers that were testing just how tight the unspoiled pussy is. As if sensing their intention the lips plump and squeeze against each other, as if mistaking them for a dick. How adorable.

The hemline rises up to the point where Aqua flashes a bit of her bright, lacy lingerie as she shifts her weight forward. Fingers dug deeper - spreading as much of the cotton underwear, as before, hooking just inside her entrance and teasing at the sensitive flesh just below her hood. Nectar slides down their fingers and pools under the Cowgirl's thighs. She adds a thumb to play and tickle the clit. It proves to be too much for the inexperienced girl; she had never been besides the smaller toys from her mother's secret stash. The fresh bimbo moans pathetically as the climax dawns upon her.

Through the haze of lust, Marine places a hand on Applejack's hard abs, signaling for him to stop. All she can do is pant heavily while AJ runs her hand up and down her shoulder, reassuringly

"I'm s-sorry." The smaller girl hiccups and water gathers in the corner of her eyes. "It-it was too much for me..."

"That's fine, Honey. I might have been a little too forward with you." The experienced Bimbo assures her and plants a kiss in the middle of her hair. Suddenly the whole world brightens. While Aquamarine tries to compose herself, the tanned woman pulls at the straps to the young, teenage breasts.

Which was an obvious Fool's errant because, wooo-wee the girl packs a pair! Her breasts stick out rather noticeably from her chest, like as if she stuffed two melons into her bra. Well, not bra. She had nothing underneath and most likely never did. If AJ was to guess she had given up on finding out she will grow out of it the next week. Not that she ever needed bras anyway. The natural fullness and ripeness devoid them from sagging. That quality did make them an especially bouncy pair, however. They swayed and rolled enticingly with every breath of her slim body.

"Wow." It was only now that AJ notices Peach staring at them. Well, mostly at her and Aqua's breasts, while have own poked through the thin fabric of her top.

A great idea forms inside the Rustic Bimbo's head.

"O dear Heaves, Aquamarine." Her voice snaps the girl on her lap back to the living world. She looks up with a mix of awe and devotion toward the woman. "Looks like we had forgotten about Peach. Say why don't you help her?" She asks, plainly. Chills run up and down Peach's spine.

---------------------

The door opens without a sound, letting curious Boysenberry peer into the dark room. Large windows loom over the room opposite the entrance in a shape half-circle. The sunlight pours in, highlighting the entire room in a pronounced glow that took a moment to adjust to. In the center of the half-circle is an ornate desk with a comfortable-looking chair. Behind the furniture, colorful plants sit saliently, doing nothing of the intruders, drinking in the light. On one side is a bookcase, filled with tomes and crude wooden figures. They must have been made by scouts, and Berry was amazed at how well-made some of them are. What's more surprising is the stone fireplace. Not small either, it has a broad inner and outer heart, a place for logs on the sides, and, uhh, there's a soft, stripy, fur rug that makes Berry start the fire, incite a random man, strip and-

"Move it, will you?" Tag-a-long growls heavily. Berry glances over her shoulder. For some reason, she didn't drop the heavy load and is dutifully holding in the air.

"Shouldn't scouts have more endurance? Or perhaps you've been slacking off." Berry teases, but grabs at her end and drags the heavy load inside.

Once inside, Tag stands up, pressing her hands to her lower back and arching backward, grumbling unhappily when she failed to draw a 'pop'. With a grumble, she reaches for the zipper while Berry continues to look around the space.

Cozy place, she comes to the conclusion. Has that rustic charm to it. It's not her father's office but a nice place nonetheless. Her eyes continue to roam the walls drinking in every detail until they set on a picture of a couple dressed in uniforms. The woman has deep red hair made into a short ponytail and a smile bright enough she could rival Applejack's. And that was the only thing she could. She had a good figure with decent hips and bust but never reaching an exceptional level. Berry breathes in as she feels a dull pain in her chest. Even berry outclasses her by a tight margin, though the uniform might be obscuring her real sizes.

The man on the other hand-

"Hmm, who's this?" Berry purrs the question, taking hold of the photo.He is a handsome man, tall, with broad shoulders, blue hair hidden under the green hat, playful yellow eyes, and strong arms wrapped around the woman. He wore a simple green shirt and brown, short jeans. He didn't look like any of those handsome guys on TV, of course, but his more down-to-earth nature face made him much more approachable.

"That's Headguides Summer Joy and Trailhead." Tag speaks up pulling a tarp and curses her clumsiness as the fabric untangles by itself.

"Trailhead." Bosenberry Roman rolls her tongue as if she was tasting the name, and runs her thumb over the picture. A certain kind of hunger awakes inside her heart. The men at the Vineyard are getting a little stale. Perhaps she should extend her tastes, she thinks licking his colored lips.

"Don't even think about it." Tag ordered in a terse tone, watching Berry like a Hawk.

"Whatever do you mean?" She offers her most sincere smile, all while Tag stands beside her with a scowl spread across her face. In her mocking attempts at looking innocent, Berry tucks the photo to her generous chest and leans slightly, simultaneously pushing up behind. Hair falls off of her back and an outline of her round cheek peek from her long but thin skirt. "I'm jusr trying to memorize the name of my Scoutguides." Berry purrs and confirms she plans to join the scouts.

If only to get to Mr. Trailhead.

"You know what I mean." Tag's lips peel back to show her perfect white teeth. "Do not even think about doing any moves on Mister Trailhead. You wouldn't be the first to try and you wouldn't be the first to succeed -"

"Ohh, did he reject you?" She asks with a mocking smirk.

"BESIDES! He and Mrs. Joy have a thing for each other." She states with finality. Berry's eyes sparkle excitedly at the news.

"Ohhh, they are a couple." She presses her sharpened fingernails to her lips caked with Violet lipstick, smudging her fingers. Now she wanted to get her hands on him even more. Her womanhood winks hard behind her as her mind immediately dredged up fantasies of the male guide slamming his hips into her wet cunny, right under the nose of the cheerful guide.

Seeing the reaction her words caused the young scout's entire face turns grey for a heartbeat, before being overtaken by a bright red hue as she reached over and swatted her fellow scout's shoulder.

"Would you quit trying to fuck my Guide?!" Tag's voice snapped, her expression deep with angry lines.

Berry snorted, smacking the Uniform girl's taut, little butt to get her off her soapbox. "Relax he's not even here."

Steam flares from her nostrils. "Little pain…" She mutters brattily, just loud enough to not be heard by Berry, whose bare hips swayed as she made her way towards one cabinet that looked different.

"Uuuu, she has a minifridge." She whispers with fascinated eyebrows. Inside are water bottles, a few fruits, packets of food, and milk. And a scotch? A crude drink but if someone like a strong kick to start the day. She'll have to bring some wine and cheese. That will score her a few points, she muses grabbing the throat of the started bottle.

Tag grabs her wrist tightly. Berry stops, mildly startled, and finally looks the Scout in the eyes, confused and a touch amused by the sudden anger burning in those green orbs. Berry's wrist goes loose, and so does Tag's grip allowing a gold arm wrist to shine in the light of the day.

"Just help me with the load." Tag grunts, all but marching to the giant-sized backpack, the Violet-haired girl rushing out to follow after. Her thin dark violet lips twitch in a sinister smile. Someone doesn't like when they are not in control.

Applejack brought, by a large margin. The two girls rummage through the bag, pulling things from little carving knives, metal poles, kindlings and-

"Ohh, what do we have here?" Berry glances over to her grumpy partner as she reaches into a fabric container and her long fingers close around a thick, cylindrical object. Just another reason to respect Miss Applejack; she has the tastes of a fine slut, Berry muses as she runs her hand up and down the cool of the lengthy dildo. It was to be expected, after all. A woman of her stature couldn't be satisfied with a lesser product. This bad boy was thicker than her arm and covered with bumps and ridges for additional experience. It's not a real deal, but it was enough for the girl to fall in love. You could just-

Without any warning, hesitation, or shame, she took a brown dick inside her mouth. She doesn't hold back even the slightest bit of impulse as she takes the cock all the way down in a single greedy swoop. Berry keeps the faux-dick close to her sweater-covered chest. Easily, it went into her throat, offering up no resistance as she got her head in motion, quickly bobbing along and working the gake dick over. There is little patience with her, no restraint or composure. Just raw indulgence and the excited, overly aggressive forwardness. Normally she would take her time, but there was no point with a toy. Muffled moans and wet, sloppy sucking noises filled the room.

It's always been like this. Ever since puberty had hit, Boysenberry couldn't help but think about big throbbing cocks penetrating her every orifice. Perhaps it was the natural conclusion. Growing up among the big sweaty hunks, working tirelessly in the vineyard; young, old, handsome, plain, every season new faces coming and going. All myriad of rippling, muscular bodies, uncouth behavior, and pants tenting for a wet pussy at the end of a strenuous day. Men that worked for her father could curse like sailors and rarely shied away from their sexual escapades. Never around her of course, but something must have sunk into the ground.

When she reached a certain age, puberty hit her and her troubles began. At first, she didn't understand what was happening to her. Her body ached with undescribed desire, her blood boiled with need, and her mind was plagued with something she didn't have a name for. It was only after a very awkward talk with her housemaid she understood what was happening. It was lust that was plaguing her mind. And she knew the remedy.

Her first time was with a young man passing through town, working that summer on the Vineyard, to gather enough money to move on. She believed he was perfect for the job. Young, probably as inexperienced as her, out of town so he wouldn't make things weird in a long run. It was easy to convince him. With her height and developed assets (though smaller than at the present) and right make-up she could pass for a much older teenager. The night was long and filled with moans; when the Sun rose Berry was covered in spunk, and the goofiest smile was plastered on her face. Somehow she managed to avoid anyone until she reached her shower.

Her lover left next week. Perhaps he found a better job or he was just uncomfortable after fucking his employee's daughter. Berry doesn't know, nor she particularly cares. What's important, she has become addicted to the feeling. Having a long meaty dick between her legs was the greatest feeling in the world. After that, there was rarely a man working at the Vineyard that didn't have violet lipstick or scratch marks somewhere on his body. Heh, Man- think a curious little kitten has found her way into their beds when in reality they were in the presence of a hungry tiger.

And yet, her father had never discovered his daughter was a nymphomaniac. Perhaps he knows, Berry ponders idly. He knows and allows her because he also knows it makes her happy. Her pussy moistens at the theory, until strings of honey run down her legs, dropping at the raising heels. The way she dresses, screams 'come and fuck me'. Violet steam raises from her sweater slowly dissolving until only a pair of spiral pseudo cups was left to keep her decent. Straps run up her chest until they connect to the golden choker, that twists with every gulp of the faux dildo.

"Ohh, father." She pants letting herself breathe and thinking about her father. The man that raised and loved her. "One day, I'm gonna sink my teeth into you." She says breathlessly.

Even with the lustful haze clouding her brain, her mind is still sharp as ever - a movement in the corner of her eye catches her attention. There, at the edge of the desk sits the young bimbo scout; her legs are spread, one hand massaging her decently-sized tit and her other hand runs its fingers in and out of her swollen clit. Berry's performance must have inspired the stuffy girl to relax. How flattering.

Keeping her fake lover, the Tall bimbo struts to her companion leaving a trail of juices in her wake.

"Tag." The quiet voice snaps the girl out of her daze and forces Tag’s eyes wide open, meeting the half-open ones of the Berry-bitch. Her mouth cracks open to ask what she wants, but Berry closes the distance between them, and their lips connect. Tag had a moment to register the dark gems hanging under her throat before her mind itself goes dark. The experienced kisser she was, Berry had little trouble leaving the scout girl whimpering for more.

Aggressively the taller girl pushes her tongue into Tag's mouth. Berry likes to find buttons to push, however. With a quick trip of the soft fingers down Tag's nethers, her teeth softly grazed the Orangehead's lip, and Tag was hoarsely announcing herself to the whole room.

Boysenberry begins to unbutton the silly T-shirt. Tag wants to give in to the Vineyard girl, but the scraps of her pride kept from succumbing completely. She might find her unbelievably attractive, but she still doesn't exactly like the 'little' devil. However what she thinks doesn't matter anyway. Soon her teenage breasts spill and bounce out from their confines. Tag was too weak to fight against her assaulter. The blushing Scout found herself bare-breasted Berry admires her torso with a hungry growl.

"Tag." The Wine girl whispers into her lowers ears.

"Y-yes?"

"What's this?" Berry's voice was so devoid of emotions, so matter-of-factly that it feels like someone had splashed her with cold water. A pair of keys dangle in front of her face. A tag with writing saying 'shed' hangs next to them.

"Why were these in your pocket?" Berry asks with a sinister tilt in her voice. Blood leaves Tag's face.

"I hid them." She admits shamefully. No point in keeping it secret. She has been caught red-handed.

"Why?"

"Because I wanted to convince you and the girls to go out and sell cookies." Berry raises a perfectly maintained eyebrow. Cookies? Really? That's the reason. "The truth is... not many new members these days. Miss Joy and Mrs. Trailhead are optimistic, but..." Tag continues, not looking her tormentor in the face. "Keeping this place running doesn't cost that much, but it still costs money. I thought that if..."

"If we sell enough, we could safe the Girl scouts." Berry speaks in a mocking tone. Tag still doesn't look at her but shrugs and covers her chest, like she just remembers this part of her is supposed to be hidden. Berry only laughs quietly at her embarrassment. Oh, she's just adorable. Despite their previous animosity Berry can't it in herself to rub the idea of a family movie in her face. Truth be told she found herself quite fond of this scout girl. She had a moxie and a knack for knots. And was fun to rail up.

"Tell you what." Berry starts, pinching the girl's chin until their eyes meet. "I'll help with your plan. BUT!" She exclaims when she sees Tag sparkling. If they were going to do it, it would be done her way, on her terms. "I want 10% of the money. And before you say 'no', you'll barely feel the loss once we figure out our route. I already have just the right idea for the business plan. Trust me you gonna love it. You, Aqua, and Peach." She leans forward until their breasts mush against each other, again. Berry's lips almost grazed Tag's. "So, do we have a deal?" She asks lustfully.

Does she even have a choice, Tag-a-long wonders? She can't do much on her own. Extra pair of hands would be a God send. Yeah, she could ask miss Applejack for extra help but Berry looks confident in her plan. It would be good for the scouts her on her side.

Besides, she's so goddamn horny. This girl is one heck of a kisser. As on cue tag's lips grow, until she sports a pair of fatty kissers herself. They latch onto the thin violet ones, and the two kisses passionately, tongues battling over domination until the two part ways. A string of saliva hanging between them, keeping them connected.

"I'll take that as a yes." Berry waves the large dildo in her hand. "But just to be sure."

-----------

"I thought scouts suppose to sell sweets." Tag-a-long jumped in pain as Boysenberry send a swift spank to her ass. "Not eat them."

"Stop being a jerk and fuck me!" Tag growls, shooting her torturer an angry glare. It's somewhat undercut by the fact that she was leaning over the table, the pink tips of her breasts zoomed along the wooden surface, and her ass is needily wagging right up in the air. Berry wouldn't say out loud but her ass is delicious; perky, round spheres that she knew are just perfect for rubbing big cocks. The Vineyard bimbo isn't lacking in that department either, but her wider hips and slim form come with a different sort of ass. Still, she's jealous. And when she's jealous, she's petty.

With a wicked smile, her hand pushes the full length of the faux dick between Tag's legs until it's up her stomach, only barely brushing against the bared sex. But only so slightly to send a tremor through the girl. Tag whines in need. The fact that she was being denied the fulfillment was driving her mad. Why was she even letting this manipulator to toy with her like this?

Berry doesn't give her partner a chance to voice her protests. Instead, she hooks two fingers into the heated pussy, drawing out a fresh wave of juices, and letting them flow over the toy. At the same time, she pricks the buns harshly.

"What are you-?!?" The Orange-haired girl finally howls out the question, only to descend into an anguished moan. Instinctively, she squeezes her legs and wiggles her hips, trying to pull the toy up enough to go in, or at least rub her off. Berry giggles in sadistic delight.

Tag had no reason to laugh. "Stop teasing me and fuck my pussy." TL voice goes from demeaning to angry and demanding. She was losing her patience and it only made the situation sweeter for the Tall girl."About that..." Berry purrs as she takes her sticky finger and the well-lubed toy back. It takes some effort to steal it from the girl - she had really strong legs to go with that Monster ass truck - and when she manages to tug it out, it accidentally bumps against her own slippery vulva lips; new seams and fabric pop into existence until it forms a sort of harness around her hips that locks around the dildo, keeping the object in place. A convenient thing as Berry had trouble wrapping her things around it completely. Was it always like this? she questions the shift in reality. She remembers taking her obscenely narrow skirt off, so it wouldn't get dirty, then she started her fun, but... wasn't she using only her hands?

Being the insightful girl that Boysenberry is, she might have grasped the change. If not for the girthy rod popping into grow on the other side of the toy, spreading her lips. Berry's cock-hungry mind was momentarily taken by the familiar pleasure of being filled with giant dick and her mind was back on what was important.

Let it not be said that Boysenberry of the Gildengrape was (completely) selfish, however. She regains her composure from the magic distractions quite fast, only to deign to lean down and press herself against her pet slut, reaching around and grabbing Tag's hanging breasts. Her fingers entoil in the Scout's Badge Sash. She didn't want to take it off for some reason. She decides to leave the question for later and she whispers into the ear.

"Did you have your anal cherry popped?" She asks, fingers following the curve of her chest.

"...No."

"Wonderful!"

Without a shred of restraint to it, Berry's hips shoved forward, impaling the scout girl onto the monstrous cock.

"Oh fuck, it's so big!" She cries, toes curling as she straightens herself out as best she could, taking on the weird mix of pain, pleasure, and thrill without much clarity and certainty about what to make of it all. The pleasures simply coming on messier and fiercer, forcing her head to spin and making everything suddenly feel downright bizarre. The noises the young Bimbo makes express something utterly baffling, a hazy rush of new feelings and pain her mind tried to make sense of as an orgasm comes crashing at her with full force.

"Ohhh, Fuck!." Tag screeches into the desk, this time calmer. Then growing an octave as another slap on her ass almost sent her to heaven and back.

"Enjoying yourself?" Berry teases, with an evil smile on her face. She could only guess what was happening in the tight hole. Muscles twitch, the insides growing hotter, massaging the half a length trying to accommodate to its sheer girth. If she was a real slut, she would try to squeeze out every last drop of cum at the same time.

"Oh fuck. Fuck..." Tag gasps, humping herself gently against the desk, trying to take it in. Her movements are slow and weak, and even the tiniest move makes her flinch. "Please... slow down. I-I need a minute.

"Really...?" Berry's smile, turns sour. Her disappointment from the morning, returns in full force. The idea of joining the Scout group has been gradually growing on her. Her companions were pleasant enough, though a bit too submissive for her to enjoy. She loves to see people on their feet, begging to fulfill her every wish, just like she does with her maid, but occasionally, she wished for a more challenging to stretch her will, and she hoped Tag would scratch that itch. But now...

"Oh please! Ju-just give me a sec. Fuck, I need it so badly..." The Needy girl rests her weight entirely on her tits, reaching back with both hands to spread her ass wide, offering herself. "Th-there, I’m ready for you!"

"It's barely half in, and you whimper like a kicked dog." Berry huffed loudly, anger just barely controlled to a scathing edge. She freed Tag from her grasp, and straightens her back, until her face is covered by shadows. "Is that it? That's how you are gonna play it? Desperate to lay down and beg for scraps?" She punctuated her point by giving Tag a few more swats across the rear enough to have her up on tip-toes, moaning lustily while getting even more sensitive. Eventually, the pale flesh turns pink, and Berry looked as if her jaw was fit to break rocks. This was less enjoyable than she expected. "Pathetic." She spits the words out. "Guess I was right after all. Girl Scouts are disappointing. You are nothing more than a pitiful, cock-hungry little toys, desperate enough to be used by others. No conviction. No will on your own. You scouts are pathetic."

Berry's voice rang out across the room. Slowly, Tag raises her head, ger eyes snap open. She grits her teeth as every pain synapse in her body numbs under the wave of anger.

Scouts? Pathetic? That's what she thinks? Long hours spent in the forest learning how to navigate through the lush foliage. Hours in the scorching sun until her skin is nice and crispy, and marked with white lines. Hours of watching Mr. Trailhead's body tucked behind that blasted uniform sticking to his body. She had to resist the all-consuming urge to tear it off and pin him to the ground. Berry was wrong, he did show interest in her. Many times. Hidden glances, and inappropriate physical contact were the proof of that. He was just too noble and faithful to Mrs. Joy to act. And speaking of which, how many occasions, she'd had to peak at that tightly compressed cleavage in her tied-up jacket during her lessons? Gods, didn't that woman knew how hot she is?! And when she strips that jacket off and fan herself with it, while her vest was wet to transparency? If she only knew how many sleepless night Tag had spend fingering herself silly because of it. But the worst part was, the feeling of them squidge up on back back while she leans down and speaks into her ear. She deserved a Fortitude Badge! She has a mental fortitude of Titans!

And it was time to show it that uppity slut.

"It is on." Tag seethes through her teeth. Panting from anger and strain, hands grip the edges of the desk. One by one, a perfect six-pack pops into existence as she slowly raises up. To the surprise of the Violet-haired girl she sees as the tanned back hardens into a perfect caleidoscope of hard muscles, that will no doubt make Applejack proud.

"How are you-"

Berry isn't sure what happened next. She knew that Tag had pushed her away, the large dildo still locked in her tight ass when her limbs moved with speed, strength, and creepy, contortionist-level of grace. It was enough to give her a pause, and the next moment Berry found herself with her back, laying on the desk and Tag kneeling over her. A lamp and a few loose papers were sent to the floor, while the sheer size and weight of her hair cleaned the tops of the cabinets behind her in one powerful swing, along with a chair.

Berry cracks her neck to look to get a better look, and what look it is. A set of washboard abs placed in the perfect spot between a pair of respectable grapefruit-sized breasts and a pair of sculpted legs and calves. All of it crowned with a sight of leaking pussy lips.

"There." The Orange-haired girl spits the word, not unlike Berry before. "You bitch stay where your place is, while I do the job. And don't think about moving!" She says, letting out an angry threat. A glint of challenge gleams in her eye, and Berry's lips slowly rise into a savage grin. That's more like it. She can worry later. There's fun to be had.

Before Berry can voice her approval, however, the muscles in the horny Scout's calves and thighs lift her hips upwards, her perfect globes clap together with enough force to keep the strap-on in and lift the wearer's hips up. Her chest isn't the biggest but they are quite perky and make a wonder full show when she bounces up and down her own personal toys.

A second later, Tag lets the gravitation do the work and the tip sinks deeper into her tight asshole, not stopping until it is insistently pushing against her stomach. The force sets her nerves on fire. Her eyes squeeze shut, and her whole world is rocked to the core. Her narrow anus stretches to the limit before shutting tight. Her head rolls back, spine arching while she embraces the raw pleasures. There was still a pain to it, and more than likely there will be after everything is done, but for now, Tag continues to bounce up and down, determined to show what she is capable of.

She's not the only one consumed by raw delights. Berry's eyes roll to her brain and her hips get soaked in the dripping juices. She gives in, letting out a sultry growl, mind completely overtaken by the joy of finding someone with equal fire. A few more bounces against her, sets Berry's heart to hammering in anticipation, although Tag winces when Berry anchors herself into her strong thighs with sharp nails. "Watch it! You'll make me bleed!"

Uncharacteristically, Berry mutters an apology and eases her grip. A tiny part of her mind still working decides to balance it with a hand-on-thigh slap. Good thing she had taken her bottom off as her legs are immediately coated in fresh moisture. Tag lets out a pleased sigh when she swaps to gently caressing legs and stomach while she rides on the toy.

This time TL can feel it, her own orgasm comes crashing down on the heels of hers. A torrent of femjuices squirts out her pussy, and the underside of Berry’s chest is liberally sprayed down by a fountain of girl-cum. A burst of electrifying pleasure opened in her brain, making her fall forward. Impossible to continue, Tag breathes heavily, her breasts heaving over her chest with a new weight. She doesn't notice, too absorbed by the biggest, messiest orgasm of her life. That was too quick, she scolds herself.

"You..." A calm voice snaps her out of her daze. She opens her eyes only to meet Berry's almond shaped ones. The Mean girl keeps her face kept in a serious expression, but her mask cracks around her lips where they twitch in a smile. "You owN me a new top."

"Screw you."

----------------------

"Why are you tied up?" Berry's eyebrow travels up to the line of her hair, sitting just outside the Headquarters, on the bench in the mini-garden in front of the building. A cozy little place to sit and wait while enjoying the tranquility that only deep and old woods can provide. The thing that she and her... companions - yeah, that's the right word - are doing now.

She had such a lovely day. The company was acceptable. She has started her own pseudo-investment and even put a charm on her fellow scout. She had resisted her and in the end, they parted as sort of equals. Well, she stayed to clean up the mess, she's a huge squirter. It will take time to tame that Outdoor Gall and Berry couldn't have been happier about it.

But back to the little conundrum of hers.

"Head Scout Applejack wanted to show me another knot, since, you know, I was everyone's hog." Peach Fuzz replies with an easy smile on her face. The young tomboy opted to sit on the dirty ground between her fellow scouts and allow Aquamarine to run her gloved hand over her head, like one might be petting a dog.

"Ok. But why are you STILL tied up?" Berry presses on. Despite the lessons being over, Peach continues to look like she had been assaulted and tied up by a group of people, which actually happened. But instead of restricting her movements, the ropes formed a sort of fashionable fishnet around her limbs and torso. Spiral patterns around her slim arms, leading to a chest harness, which might be more impressive if she actually had some boobs to wrap them around. She still wore her crop top, though it was strained and probably only kept in place by the knots.

Peach's legs are indecently wide open and allowing Berry to take a look and she can see everything! She had discarded her shorts, moments after they ripped and she couldn't be less bothered by the fact she was moonlighting everyone in the broad daylight. Her long legs, scratched skin, and that tight, tight Peach Harness (very original, she notes), hugging her huge buttocks, all on display. Only after squinting her eyes, Berry notices the plastic, elastic waistband. She looks further and sees that her puffy lips are kissing the tight white lines, through the material and a bit of moisture between her legs making them gleam in the setting Sun. Someone is eager for action.

"I just think I look neat." Peach answers and squares her shoulder a bit then lifts an arm and flexes until the rope strains. She turns such a fiery shade of pink, that makes the Tall girl thinks, her face will explode. Ultimately, Fuzz breathes out in exasperation. "I was sure they would break this time." She pouts and crossed his arms in a minor sulk.

"What?"

"Peachy said she could tear her ropes just by flexing."

She hears Aqua to her side, briefly looking over her shoulder, wondering if her voice has changed. It sounded louder, stronger, yet still delicate. Berry's eyes roam over the miles of Marine's exposed skin. There was just so much of it. And for all accounts something was wrong.

The Shy girl looks the same but not the same? For one, She and Boysenberry are almost equal in height. Berry KNOWS that she is the tallest in the group, but now that they are on the same level, she could stare straight at the endless ocean of hair where her head should be. Aquamarine's body was still waifish and shapely, wasp-thin at the waist but soft in the thighs. And the enormous pair of degrading boobs.

Berry concentrates, her brow knitting together as she tries to recall their first meeting.

Her large, perfectly-complexioned tits are just too perfectly round globes bolted still to her delicate torso, shamelessly displayed in the risque open-chested dress. Her gleaming breasts are held in place only by spaghetti-thin crisscrossing straps. But judging from the way her pink-colored flesh bulges in this framework, and her pierced nipples pokes through the fabric, the piece of cloth wasn't designed for modesty. Did it always look like this? She would definitely remember if someone was much better developed than her. Especially someone like her who didn't like to be looked at. Her almond-shaped eyes roam further. Now that she thought about it, no she definitely didn't have those gem-encrusted armbands so many real-looking gems locked in rings, shining right into her eyes.

Gods, she was so distastefully flashy. Let the look do the talking, but she was just screaming right to her face.

"So far she hadn't succeeded." Marine continued. When her fingers touch those blonde locks Peach briefly goes stiff, then relaxes as the Colorful girl begins to play with her blonde mane.

"Sure she will!" Applejack shouts from the other side of the grassland, mooning her ass while tending to the plants. She stands up in swift motion, sending her breasts into a wobbling frenzy, and then turns around. A phone in her hand. "She just needs to buff a little bit." To highlight her words AJ flexes her own arm and a bicep the size of the child's head pops out and she pats it. "Don't worry Sugarpeach. Ahm gonna bring you some Apple Acres products. Few healthy meals you'll shred your duds when reaching for a pen."

"Really?" Peach smile goes from ear to ear.

"Honey, the Apple Family has the beefiest guy and gals in the whole state. And if it comes to me, you all are family, already!" AJ laughs and closes the distance between her and the front doors with a few steps of her treetrunk legs. The girls don't notice when she takes a photo of them. "For now, I'll give something else though. Be right back."

Berry's eyebrows knit, curiously. Beefiest guys in the state, huh? If someone else than Miss Applejack was to say it, she would have thought that it was an empty promise. But if the Apple girl is so big, then how big was the Apple Guy? Berry licked her moist lips and steeples her fingers together, gears in her mind turning at full speed. She always has a place for more help at the Vineyard. Perhaps a business deal with the Apple Family could prove beneficial to her. And her father, of course.

A moment has passed the three by in a comfortable, unnoticed manner. Her father or someone sent by him should arrive soon to take her back home. She hoped it was the latter. Kissing her father on the cheek would definitely improve her day, but she has gone through the last few hours without a real, hot cock shoved down her throat, and the itch between her legs starts to become burdensome. How many people worked today in the fields? Maybe she will manage to snatch a two or three or-

Something brushes against her leg, snapping her from her schemes. Berry looks down into the golden locks of Peach Fuzz. The tomboy continued her fruitless efforts to snap her bindings. Try as she might she simply lacked in the muscle department. She has a nice, well-built figure, but she wasn't a musclehead, like her father.

Berry's eyes go wide like diner plates, the words reverberate in her brain shaking her whole body. Brief memories of the jacked Adonis flood her mind, heating her cheeks. It's not on conscious will that her hand slides down into the crotch and begins to rub her box. Her opposite hand moves to knead one of her barely covered breasts.

Her budding needs and stilted desires from her previous life are strengthened tenfolds by primal magic. Her mind cleares on one simple goal: to fuck Peach Fuzz's father. She doesn't care if it's today, tomorrow, or next week - she will get that hunk of a man! One way or another. Berry looks back at Peach who rubs her tears-covered face against the Marine's leg. The Crafty girl smiles. Time to get some info.

"So, Peach." She speaks up, doing her best bored impression while casually crossing her arms and legs. "Where are you from?"

"South-East side of town." Peach answers, beaming at the chance to forget about her failure. "Why you ask?"

"Just passing the time." She keeps her expression soft. It's not like her normal, disdainful expression. No, there was an unexplainable curiosity about the way she looks at Peach. "And what's your father called? What is he like?" What does he do for a living?"

"His name is Endeavour." Peach piped up, showing her teeth in a wide grin, finding nothing suspicious in the questions. "And he's like the best dad EVER!"

"I see." She doesn't.

"I'm serious." Peach argues, punching her new friend on the knee. "He's the best! He cooks for me. Buys me sweets and exercises, and watches movies with me whenever he's not working." She Energetic girl scratches her temple as if it trying to jog her memory. Eventually, her shoulders fall. "Or when he's not... dating."

Berry on the other hand perks up. "So he's single." She concludes. She tries to maintain a mildly interested appearance, but inside, her body is burning at the information of her single fuck-crush.

"Yeah." Peach sighs, laying her hands on her crossed legs. "He's awesome but he, ughhhh, he just can't stop looking after pretty girls. He goes out like, three different women. In one week." Peach doesn't hide her displeasure. She presses her hands to her temples and slams the back of her head against the edge of the bench. "Sometimes all three at the same time! They shake the whole house when they are at it!"

Berry's cheeks turn hot red while Marine tries to soothe the Blonde, but Peach slaps her hands away.

"Do you know how annoying it is?" The question is thrown in Boysenberry's face, and the answer is yes, she knows how it feels. She loves her father, more than all the men under her combined, but he can be so weak around pretty faces and low necklines. That some golddigger hasn't robbed him yet... "He could be spending time with me, but nooooo. He prefers to play with the beach balls of some other girl." She spins her hands in front of her flat chest, in a 'grope my tits' fashion."I get it! They're nice and soft and warm and you just want to bury your face between them, because they are so soft and warm, but really dad, you really prefer them over me?" She finishes with a dramatic press of her thumb against her sternum.

"Ohh my God, I know, right?" A surge of excitement runs up her spine as Berry leans forward. "Why would he go looking for some floozy when you have the perfect girl right by your side? The perfect daughter that will love you and be with you no matter what."

"Exactly! Finally, someone who gets it!" Peach jumps up, startling Aqua, and turns mid-air to look at Berry. "Why would they? Those grown-up girls are only temporary, but us? We are eternal, we love our dads and want to be with them, we know them better than anyone else. Like, hello, we're right there. Why can't they see that?"

"Men. What would they do without us?" Berry grunts in an exasperated tone, but her loose body language conveys that she wasn't angry. She actually feels at ease. Normally the topic sends her mind into an exasperated turmoil, but somehow, talking about it with this silly Blonde, makes the topic bearable. Sour sweet, somehow? Wait, is that what camaraderie feels like? It's amazing!

"Yeah. Men are the worst." Peach shakes her head and sets her scratched hands on her round hips. "Wish I could, I don't know, convince him somehow, that he only needs me in his life."

"Change his mind, you say..." Berry trails off. An invasive thought flits across Violethead's mind. A thought that stubbornly pushes its way deeper and deeper until it takes root, and slowly a plan blooms. Something with food and drinks. Mostly milk and wine. The memory of Tag's back flashes in her mind. Something is at play around here, something weird. She doesn't comprehend it completely, but somehow she knows it's beneficial. And if it's not, then Berry will find a way to benefit from it.

"Say Peach, would you mind if I bring you something?"

The tomboy tilts her head. "Bring what?"

"Something that might solve both of our problems."

--------------

"Uhmm, Boysenberry." Said girl glanced up sharply at the owner of the sweet voice. In an ill-mannered fashion, The shy girl still, has her face hidden behind her hair. Hasn't she learned anything from the morning talk? "I'm sorry to interrupt, but, when you said, you can solve your parent's attitude, did you mean it?"

"And?" Berry finishes with a bit of impatience. She doesn't bother with looking at Aqua's face, anymore. No, her's stare settles further down, and her dazzled-up disco balls. Aqua takes notice but doesn't comment on it. Instead, she loosely folds her hands on her lap, not so subtly emphasizing the size of her bust. She starts playing with the rings on her fingers, which also has the 'unfortunate' side effect of nudging her breasts. Berry's nose scrunches, making Aqua quirk her lip, pleased with her little game.

"And I was thinking, could you bring me it, too?" A sweet, delicate voice asks, sounding as innocent as it could get. The Trophy teen wiggles in her seat to 'face' her new friend, and Peach becomes an unfortunate victim of boob assault.

"Maybe I could. But first - what you have a problem with your father, too? Can't imagine a guy not wanting to play with your inflated beachballs." Berry asks lips peeled back in a small snarl that shows off her perfect white teeth, her eyes so narrow that they were little more than razor-sharp slits. She makes a point to fold her arms and push up her own chest. "Second, didn't I tell you to look people in the eyes when you speak to them? " Venom trickles from her words. "And third what's in it for me?"

In response, dainty fingers glide through dazzling turquoise hair, pulling the heavy, frontal bang covering her eyes.

Berry's eyes meet Aquas's bright, complex, aquamarine ones. Then slowly, quietly, with a mixture of awe, fright, and sheer, childish wonder, Berry's jaw falls to the ground.

Her cheekbones are plump and soft, giving Marine a slightly innocent appearance. Green, mascara-laced lashes blend with shining pink eye shadow making her gorgeous eyes stand out. Those eyes... It's like looking into the star-filled night sky, looking deep into the cosmos, until the understanding of your own ignorance dawns on you. Or when peaking from the edge of the ship in the middle of the night, right into the unexplored Ocean abyss, illuminated only by fluorescent algae. The sight... too beautiful, too mysterious, too enamoring to look away. A low, disbelieving hum escapes Berry.

A small smile crosses Aquamarine's puffy, swollen, cock-sucking lips, at the inevitably adorable reaction. Emboldened, the Trashy girl stretches a hand and slips her talons underneath the infatuated girl's chin, and gives her a tiny pull.

"I’d be so... grateful if you helped me… I would make it worth it for you..." The Teenage trophy girl explains, her quavering, flirty voice is so different from the shy and hesitant girl either Berry or Peach knew a few hours ago.

The Teenage Tyrant groans, feeling all her coolness seep out of her from being starstruck, leaving her weak. There was only her and this Goddess of a girl for which she would do anything.

"Okay..."

"Ohh, thank you." Marine leans in to plant her puffy lips on Berry's cheek, leaving a bright, bubblegum pink mark.

Berry shoots up in her seat with a jerk, sweat licking at her whole body when a car horn pierced through the forest. Berry very poorly soothes her heart with desperate promises of wine tasting, cuddles from her father, and men under her feet.

Just... what the fuck has just happened? It was surreal. That girl - Aquamarine was dangerous. Somehow she has slipped through her radar undetected. She'll have to watch out for her. For now, she'll be focusing on the safer parts, when talking with her. The gem choker on her neck or the nipple chain. Yes, tits. Tits are the safe spot.

The familiar Hummer truck rumbles across the dirt driveway and comes to a stop before the small patch of kept green. The vehicle abruptly turns off, and the door opens as a truly Beefcake of a man exits the driver's side of the cabin. Marine finds her own heart thudding under her breasts as she stares intently at the figure.

He is gorgeous! A huge, powerful, tanned man, at least as tall as her. His arms swell with muscles below a white, open T-shirt, displaying his hairy pecks and developed abs. Marine's flesh pimple at the sight of tight chino shorts, that rippled around his crotch, bulging outward. Pain shoots through her knees as The Trophy girl digs her nails into them. Berry next to her shares the sentiment, absentmindedly, nibbling the end of one of her precious braid.

Peach, on the other hand, has recovered from the micro-concussion and hastily stands up, and sprints towards the man. His purple hair blows back around her handsome square face, as he looks at the little, tied-up gremlin. His nose scrunches at the state his daughter was in, however still happy to see his progeny, he opens his arms.

"Dad!" She shouts, literally jumping up at the man, wrapping her arms and legs around his torso, and waiting for broad arms, squeezing him tight.

"Peach." Is his first word as he pushes her a bit to look into her eyes. "What did I tell you about walking around WITH YOUR ASS OUT!?" His voice isn't surprised or angry, the duo can tell that much. More like mildly tired and frustrated, after repeating the same topic a hundredth time.

"Hey, I have a good reason this time." Peach rises her chin defiantly, letting her arms go and settling on her hips. Her legs are still around her father's middle, grinding her pelvis against his abs. Neither of them seems bothered by it, though Peach winces quietly when the rope rubs her off in a nice way. Berry wonders how strong Peach's legs are. "They ripped."

"Ripped?"

"Yeah."

"...again?"

"Again. Like reaaaappeddd." She mimics the sound of the pants shredding and waves her arms around. "Like completely split in half. Couldn't hand onto my butt anymore, so I threw them off." She finished with a self-assured smile.

"Couldn't have used those?" The large man tugged at the coil around her chest, making his daughter wince again. Her cheeks colored a soft pink. "You have this thing around your rump, anyway." The solution was so obvious that Peach tilted her head and rubbed her chin. Indeed, she could have done that. But, on the other hand, why? Pants are such a bother. "What's with the ropes anyway? Did someone bully you?" She asks, voice turning deadly serious.

"Nope." Tomboy puffs her chest proudly, straining her confines. "It's a fashion statement.

Endeavour says nothing. After a second he clicks his tongue and smiles amused. He was used to her daughter's antics at this point in his life. Peach has always liked to make everyone think she was a daredevil, with her stunts or in the fashion sense if you could call it that. He should be grateful she had to wear a shirt and underwear. Though he doesn't necessarily approve of it, it does look good on her.

And it did show off her nice figure. Peach has always been a wild spirit, with enough energy to fuel a small city. He prized himself for a body-straining training regime, to keep his body built like an old god, but nothing compared to chasing her to put her pants on. She did not grow out of that. Luckily, they had found a way to vent that energy in joined training sessions. She can't keep up with him yet, always tiring up before the end, but she keeps coming back for more. More laps, more weights, more push-ups, sit-ups etc. Made raising her way easier. Hopefully, It would also discourage any boys from dating her.

"At least you still wear panties."

"Not because she wanted to." A heavily drawled voice speaks up. Applejack in all her amazon glory struts out of the building, a package in her hand. Her heels clack, hips and tits swing with reckless abandon combined with gorgeous tanned skin pulled taut over limbs and torso made a combined sound and picture show, hypnotizing everyone around.

The Hunk's jaw drops at the sight of the girl that rivaled or even outweighed him in muscle definition. For just a second he felt intimidated. After that second his pants cried as the bulge down his legs threatened to rip them apart, putting him in the same bottomless position as Peach. "Don't hold it against her mister. A gal shouldn't ashamed of her treasures."

"You heard her da-hey!" Peach squeaks as she is gently shoved aside. The young tomboy blinks as her daddy bows elegantly. Applejack finds herself looking into the green eyes and alluring smile of the man. He takes her hand to plant a kiss on its back.

"Hello there, pretty Lady. I didn't know Scouts hire amazons." His voice is deep containing a low rumble of approval that would make a normal girl weak in the knees. He keeps his eyes on her cheerful face instead anywhere lower, which takes an immeasurable amount of will, but an experienced Ladykiller like him knows the payoff would be worth it.

"What a silver tongue. Hope you know how to use it." Applejack tips her hat, with a tiny bow in her own, that put her fat udders on further display. It hurt to not have his dick between those. "Name's Applejack. I'm just a stand-in for the real Guides." She seems amused, her eyes wandering over his muscular body with interest that's more thinly disguised than his. "But if you are worried about the 'things' we did today, you might come with me inside and I'll tell you everything." She purrs the words, her large hand gliding over the brawny forearm, then at the stones, he calls pecs. Endeavour eyes dance at the perceived victory.

"She's good." Marine mutters from her place. Berry bites her lip until she can taste copper. Well, it's not hard if you're built like a cow.

The moment is to be ruined, however. Peach huffs. Her daddy is doing the thing again. He could never stop himself from flirting, especially when the girl was pretty and/or busty. Pretty sure that's how he picks up babysitters for her. Even if she absolutely didn't them anymore! Applejack was like catmint for him, and she doubted the Cowgirl would say no. And with his stamina, it could take hours for them to finish. So, when she saw the two flirtbirds subtly inching closer Peach, very understandably, jumps at her daddy's back and hooks her arms and legs around his torso, and shouts in his ear, drawing a surprised curse and an agonized wail of failure. "Dad, let's go him! I'm starving!"

Endeavour groans, as pain shoots through his head, jerking him down. The magic's gone and he massages his left side, wondering if he's bleeding. Applejack on the other hand is deeply amused by Peach's antics. It's like watching Applebloom 'protecting' Big Mac from 'hungry Harpies'. It's so cute. Nevertheless, Applejack's hornier than a nun during a bodybuilder competition, so she briefly considers the press on her issue. The guy's not bad for the eyes and packs enough heat in his pants that she wonders if some other bimbo got her mitts on him already. However, her big Sister-side gets the better of her. Take care of the younglings before you take care of yourself.

"Welp a growing girl needs to have her fill. P'haps another day." She speaks, murdering any hope he had to score with the tanned amazon. At least he managed to scope a feel. With his head. Shorter than he had wished, but he'll deal with that soon enough.

"Yeah. Another day." The older man shoots the younger blonde an annoyed glare, backed by promises of spinach-based meals in the future, then looks back up to Applejack with a small smile.

"Here you have, Sugarpeach." She offers them a bag with a square object inside. "A memento from me and a treat from a baker friend of mine."

"Gift?" Peach sets her arms on the broad shoulders and pushes herself upwards. With impressive control, the Blonde balances on her father's head. "Gimme Gimme Gimme." She chants as she quickly grabs the package. Fishing out a large box and she doesn't bother with such minor things like reading the label, before digging out one of the sweets - a large chocolate-dotted cookie. The Tomboy licks her lips, in such a way that she drools herself at the sight, before shark-biting into the confectionery. And then she moans.

The sound couldn't be taken for anything innocent. It is the sound of someone experiencing carnal pleasures outside of anything they've felt before. The chocolate melts in her mouth, drowning her in a sweet sensation. Her lips tingle, as her tongue, rolls out to catch the crumbs. Her hand moves out again, this time grabbing a rainbow-colored cookie. This was her last victim, before when Endeavour snatched the sweet box from her hand.

"Eyy." She whines, desperately waving her arms to get her precious cookies back. "Those are mine!"

"No sweets before dinner, young lady." He says in the same pitch AJ's parents would use when they caught her stealing from the cookie jar. It was much intentional. Not only was Endeavour punishing his child for standing between him and the sexy bimbo, but also showing his parent side. Ladies couldn't resist the 'Good Father' charm. The way the Cowgirl's eyes soften, confirms it worked on her. With that small victory, The large man shifts his frame, making Peach fall. With one arm, he catches her by the butt to let her hang over her shoulder and turns towards the car. "You'll spoil your appetite."

"Ohhhh." Peach whines. "'The best part always skip me..." The littlest girl insists and blows a dismissive raspberry. A trickle of rainbow runs out her swelling lips.

The Single father rolls his eyes and smirks. "I planned to order pizza, but I can cook something if you need a pick me up."

"Pizza, pizza, Pizza!" Peach cries, terrified of the prospect of looking at an extra large Meat'n'cheese pizza. Her fists playfully beat her daddy's back, like any grumpy child would. He didn't feel a thing, her fist bounce off the hard muscles.

"My cooking is not that bad." Endeavor chides while playfully smacking her daughters' rump, which drew an irritated whine.

Applejack was cackling as she shook a hand with the handsome man. "Pleasure to meet you, Mister. I look forward to talking some more." Before he can walk away she pulls herself closer, causing her chest to press up against his arm. With some difficulty, she slips a card out of her boob pocket and tellingly traces her fingers over the coil of meat in his pants until she finds his pocket. "Until'en, here's a link to a website of mine. I'm sure you'll enjoy its contents."

Endeavor wonders what the eager slut means, but mostly he focuses on the girl's touch. Her eagerness doesn't rise his suspicions. She wouldn't even be the quickest girl trying to get him in bed. With an eager nod, he says his goodbye. "I'm sure I will."

"See ya, tomorrow Peach." Applejack waves. "Can't wait to meet you again. I should have something special for you and the rest of the gals."

"See you tomorrow, Scout Master Applejack. Marine!" Fuzz shouts and waves them off when her father turns around. Berry lazily raises her hand, but Marine was too busy staring at the man's ass. So that's where she got it. "Hey, BB! I take your offer! Bring me the thing. I'm gonna make my Daddy love me!"

"I already love you." Endeavour quizzically quirks his eyebrow, practically throwing her ass into the Hummer.

"Well, yeah, but like, more."

"Not possible, kid." He closes the door and begins to walk towards the driver's seat. Imperceptibly, he reaches for a cookie.
