Hello, I'm Umbreon-Anon. I'm copying Ribombee-anon's page because his shit is really fucking good and it looks sick as fuck. Hope you all like my writing and my autistic artwork.

#Characters
##Team Moonshine
Team Moonshine is currently my ~~only~~ main set of characters who I write about. They are a nocturnal group of pokemon, (Half of whom were former humans) who work as an Exploration Team for Clover Guild. On paper, each member was designed to piss off their leader, Adrian, as much as possible.

###Adrian
A human turned into an umbreon. Adrian is very easily pissed off, and most of his interactions with people will be marked by his hatred for most of the people in the guild. The only people he tolerates well are the members of his team (Except for Enny). He usually avoids most members of the guild, (especially Cyndaquil), and will often be found in either his room solving puzzles, the dojo, or the library.

###Enny
A human turned into a sylveon. Enny is the polar opposite of Adrian. He is an incredibly flamboyant crossdresser who loves to pretend to be a girl so he can mess with people. He frequently pokes fun at Adrian to get reactions out of him, but has pretty normal relationships with the rest of his team. He will flirt with pretty much any member of the guild he thinks it will be funny with, (Except for Cyndaquil). He also read a lot of shoujo manga, watched a lot of anime, and was a complete shut-in as a human.

###Vileplume

Vileplume is a native pokemon and the older brother of Bellossom. He often fulfills the role of second-in-command for Team Moonshine. He's usually pretty level-headed, but he has trouble dealing with Adrian's aggression at times, and the two will frequently argue with each other.  He cares deeply for his sister, and he hates to see her get hurt or cry. He doesn't talk to Enny too often, but the two get along through mutual respect. He also has an interest in human culture which is often used as a tool to fuck with him by the guild members.

###Bellossom
Bellossom is a native pokemon and the younger sister of Vileplume. She's not very effective in combat without her brother helping her, so she often fulfills the role of medic in the team. She loves talking to Enny about the human world, particularly anything related to the more romantic stories he read. She loves her brother dearly and can't really do much without him. She's the only person in the guild that Adrian confides in regarding personal feelings. Lastly, she is very sensitive and will often burst into tears any time an argument occurs in her vicinity.

#Stories

I try to write more serious/dramatic stories with a bit of comedy here and there to lighten the mood. I hope they're not too edgy for you, because there are definitely edgelord moments in these stories
