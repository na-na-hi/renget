In bed by anon

>It's a nice cool night, anon is against my chest, his nose nusling into my fur.
>it's cold for him so he's wearing a shirt with his underwear
>"aren't you cold dear?" he asks in his bubbly voice, along with a pet name, he never fails to melt me.
>i sigh "no, anon, I'm not, you see, i have this thing called fur..."
>anon continues rubbing his cheek on me
>"something i can feel you getting *quite* aquatinted with."
>"yeah, it's nice~" he says in an airy tone
>i push him back a little "i know, but... I'm trying to sleep!"
>he's close enough that he moves his head forward and plants his forehead on my chest
>i sigh, thinking i can finally go to bed, and close my eyes
>"hey, i think this is like the third time I've seen you naked?"
>uh oh
>my heart starts beating faster
>"usually the dick is already out before i jerk you off, but i kinda wanna see the knot come out"
>"u-uhh"
>i can't fuck him this late, because of work, but i don't wanna say no
>"can I?"
>fuck fuck fuck, what do I do!?
>he lays his head still in my chest
>my heart is running a marathon
>he puts his hand on my side, getting closer
>"hey, it's ok if you don't want do it that's fine" he kisses me on the snout.
>i calm down a bit, along with my heart
>i hug him, and sigh
>"i do, i just-"
>i think for moment
>"you know I'm not that experienced, and i don't want to fuck it up"
>"you won't" he reassures me, "i promise, i love you"
>don'tcrydon'tcrydon'tcrydon'tcry
>"i love you too"
>we both pause and enjoy the moment for a while then i say
> "so, where do we start, babe?"
>it's blurry without my glasses on but i can still see anon smile in the darkness
>"I've been wanting to do something for a while now" says anon, "something you'd really like."
>I'm enticed by the cryptic nature of his statement
>"really? like what?" 
>"give you a blowjob, or more..."
>the arousal rises in me, the tip of my cock peeks out of my sheath
>"i- i would like that"
>he reaches down, caressing my balls as he leans in for a kiss
>i close my eyes and move forward to kiss him
>i enjoy this moment like a fine wine, moving my paws around his body, our erections growing.
>my dick throbs as my knot pops out of my sheath
>it takes a minute or so before anon realizes that I'm hard
>he pulls his tongue out of my mouth, leaving a string of saliva between us
>"here, sit on the edge of the bed"
>I can't control my excitement, i have a stupid grin on my face.
>he gets on his knees in front of me.
>he grabs my dick in his hand, which sends tingles of pleasure through my body, i squirm a little
>"having fun already?" anon asks
>i tell him yes
>he starts by giving kisses up and down my shaft, holding my knot in his hand
>i give little moans, i can tell he's enjoying every second
>he uses his tongue, rubbing the underside of my dick while he sucks on my tip
>it feels so good, i finally got what my friends were talking about when they talked about sex
>i feel him take more of my manhood with noises of pleasure from him
>he takes it all the way to the knot, rubbing his own hardon through his underwear
> am i panting? oh god I'm panting
>all the while, still holding my balls in his other hand.
>he slowly pulls his head back.
>"i told you you would like it"
>"why did you stop?"
>"for the more part, silly"
>I was really fired up from this already, so the promise of more, although i could guess what it was, was keeping me ok edge.
>"more?"
>he got up, and walked to his my bedside table
>he's been here a few times before, but i didn't expect him to hide stuff in my house
>he reached his hand to the back of the drawer
>"what are you?"
>i heard the sound of scotch tape tearing off of something.
>he presented, with a single pice of tape on it, a small bottle of lube
>this human never ceases to astound me
>"wait?! did you plan...?" my voice trailed off, but he completed the thought
>"I've been waiting for us to use this for a while now dear~"
>he applied some to his fingers, 3 to be exact, before gluttonously slathering his hole with it, giving little "mmms" and "ahhs" as he did
>i was throbbing and dripping at this point, warm sticky liquid running down my cock
>he giggled at me, knowing full well the effect he was having on me, i hated and love him for it, i'd never been this horny for someone like this ever
>i saw him pour a bit of lube on his hand and rub his fingers on his palm, spreading it well
>it felt like slow motion as he moved his hand towards my yearning member
>i let out i wine in anticipation, but was stopped by another kiss
>he generously coated my dick with lube, i could cum right now, god at least i wasn't panting with his mouth on mine.
>he took his hand off, along with his mouth, he needs to stop teasing me like this.
>"ok, i promise this is the last pause."
>i was so relieved
>"so that wasn't 'more', anon?"
>"no, *this* is more"
>he turned around and and put his hands behind him on my knees
>my hands were up, next to his sides for a while before finally landing on his waist
>"just guide it in"
>this was the part I've wanted to do since i first started watching porn, my tail wagged.
>the lube, plus the fact that he had probably practiced, made for a blissful entrance
>at once i felt the great feeling of this walls hugging my cock snug.
>we both let out an "ahhh" of extacy.
>he moved uo and down, engulfing the whole of my cock except for the knot
>i started to pant again, i could help myself and i didn't want to
>first he was the one taking the lead, slowly and sentually, bouncing on my dick
>this i started to push him up and down with my paws, leading him
>finally, i decided to take the lead
>"can we change positions anon?"
>"of course we can! what position?"
>"what about... doggy style? except, your on all fours on the bed, instead lying against the... do you know what I'm talking about?"
>"don't worry, i understand."
>he got off me a little faster than he should have, which send a tingle and a twitch through my body, and seemingly his
>then anon got on his knees and elbows on the bed, adjusting his position before saying:
>"like this right?"
>"yeah! like that!" i said, excited
>i climbed onto the bed and over him, one arm on his dick, and one around his body
>i pressed my cock against him and entered, i was deep in lust now and some thoughts i didn't know I had, began to surface aloud in between breaths down is neck
> "I'm... gonna make you.... MINE, I'm gonna.... claim you... anon!"
>he didn't respond, my pounding and masturbating had left him unable to control his vocal chords, moans and unintelligible words of lust.
>i was so close now, i pushed in my dick, and felt a little resistance until my knot fit in, i was pushing it in and out,
>this must have sent him over the edge
>he started moaning louder, almost screaming with pleasure
>the attempt of his anal ring to close as he shot cum strangled my knot, and forced me to shoot ropes and ropes of cum into him
>i moved us to to our sides, as we both payed there out of breath
>i would keep my dick in, the feeling was too nice to give you and it would go back into the shear on it's own
>he took my arms and wrapped the around himself
>"now... i am yours"
>i was DEFINITELY calling in sick tomorrow
>The End.
