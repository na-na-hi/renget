\>You get back from lunch with renewed energy and a full belly
\>Mars pot roast with a side of "whatever the agricultural department manages to grow on this red rock"
\>It's not a bad meal although it gets tiring after a while, but you are too much of a chicken to try out something from a demon run restaurant
\>Despite your belief that they ate pure sin and the souls of the damned, the denizens of hell do eat "regular" food
\>The problem for you is that their regular is weird purple grubs, argent infused bread and "a piece of Leviathan"
\>No way in hell you're eating a part of something you don't know what it is, no matter how much the cacodemon next door tries to convince you otherwise
\>The flying orb of teeth reminds you of a friend you have
\>A summoner that were among the demons that came on the rapture
\>You can hear his voice echo in your head, "Come on Anon, there is a ton of weird stuff on Earth that you humans eat. You eat the fruit of a dragon, if that's not "weird" then I don't know what is!"
\>He even conjured a vision of you enjoying the food he wanted to eat and what you would feel afterwards
\>It didn't work this time. He already got you to try out "argent wine" using that trick, and that made you feel electricity in your gut for a week
\>Even if he is pushy, and really whiny sometimes, you can still say he is a good friend of yours
\>Might even be your best friend now all things considered
\>It's been a while since you've seen him, you wonder how he is doing now that he helps with the research
\>You think about the progress that the research team has made into portal and teleportation technology while you enter your office
\>The first thing you see is your friends eyeless face, spooking you and making you fall backwards
\>The summoner started laughing as you landed on your back
\>"Wow Anon, I knew you liked me but to fall that hard for me is too much don't you think?"
\>You take it back, he's a bastard deserving only the worst punishment that hell can offer
\>After seeing the scowl on your face he bent down and offers you a hand, still giggling at your reaction
\>"You can't fault me for laughing, can you anon?" he started, "You're too cute when you're flustered."
\>With a pull from him, and with a little argent push on your back, you are back on your feet
"Sure I am, what's the reason for the visit" you ask
\>He brings a hand to his cheek and taps a finger on his exposed teeth
\>"What reason should I have to visit a friend of mine, one which I have not seen in a couple of weeks. I wonder"
\>He goes on for a while about why in all the nine circles he would visit you
\>As a sign you understand his point you push him to shut him up
\>He "falls" backwards and commits to it for about a moment before he spins back up, now with a smile on his face
\>"That's the Anon I know," he exclaims, "a little rough but always a good time."
\>You groan at the innuendo and ask if he has a reason to be here besides visiting a friend
\>He says it's time for his monthly check up, it was a perfect opportunity to meet up
\>Summoners, being a race of demons capable of utilizing argent energy naturally, are like mages in your fantasy games
\>They float, create waves of pure energy, can teleport themselves and summon demons, humans or things because it's easy
\>This reliance of magic puts them at risk of atrophying their muscles since they rarely get used.
\>To make sure they stay healthy you've asked the ones that come by to use their powers less
\>This monthly check is to make sure they are not withering away and to build some mass if an area is underused
\>Supposedly, there exists another creature in hell capable of using magic to resurrect others but no one in the excavation team has found any
\>You nod your head and tell him to sit down on the bench
\>He floats over to it and hovers above it
\>You do not have the energy to argue so you grab his waist and pull him down, he actually needs to sit for once
\>You start out simple, the legs
\>You press into his outer thighs and feel the sinews give way to your hand
\>Not in the danger area yet, they retain their form but they feel a bit weak
\>You start to press and drag the muscle underneath the skin to confirm their strength
\>All the while the demon just sigh and enjoy the feeling
\>You move over to the inner thigh and the summoner gasps at the touch
\>You carefully observe the red skin as you knead into it
\>You hear that he tries to stifle a groan but he can't stop the rumbling in his throat
\>You move closer to his crotch to check on the sinews connecting the legs when you feel his hand grasp your head
\>You always forget how long his fingers are, they reach to your neck
\>"You sure do look good down there" he says while scratching your head
\>You sigh, blowing air at his crotch and making the mage shiver
\>Still having his hand on your head, you continue up towards his abdomen
\>His holes are glowing in a healthy hue, you need to remember to ask what those things are
\>Besides the lights, there seems to be no problem with his chest
\>It's soft due to his strength stat being zero but nothing wrong with that
\>His hand moves from your head to your upper back, cradling you
\>You were about to start examining his arms when he pulled you up to his face
"Yes, you want any..."
\>Before you finished your sentence the summoner opened his mouth and kissed you
\>You tried to push back but his arm held you firmly in place
\>Seeing you were trapped he tilted his head and deepened the kiss, the bastard taking delight in your enjoyment of the intimacy.
\>You can't deny how good it feels and hearing your friend moan as he savors the kiss just makes you blush
\>Although it sucks to blue-ball yourself you pull back from the kiss, you have a couple more muscle groups to examine and work on after all
\>Once you think he has closed his eyes, maybe turned off his vision is a better way to say it, your hand sneaks to his back and grabs one of his "wings"
\>He grunts at the feeling and you feel something come to life between his legs
\>With one strong yank he howls in pleasure and releases his grip on you
\>You step back and notice a wet spot on your shirt, you just washed this one
\>Looking back you see the summoner panting, with a throbbing erection between his legs
\>You're all too familiar with this one. Its size is normal for a summoner, maybe half an inch shorter than average but that inch got placed in the girth of it instead.
\>The special feature of this one lies in the production, he's like a faucet when he's turned on
\>Once you got curious and placed a big glass underneath him to measure how much flows out
\>The findings were inconclusive because the glass was overfilled when the night was over
\>"Damn...Should not...Have told you about...That" he panted out
\>Each breath was punctuated with a splat of pre hitting the floor
\>You stare at him, trying to think of something to say
\>He beat you to the punch, "Hope you're not mad. It's been a while thanks to work, and something always happened when we were supposed to meet"
\>"You can't blame me" he continues, "You know how I get after a while. You don't blame the princes from the third when they outlawed resurrection after years of talking about it, it's expected"
\>You try to think of anyway you can spin this into his fault, but you can't
\>You've known him for a long time, he is always like this with you
\>Always teasing, always flirting, always finding any excuse to have some fun
\>"Sure, I can wait a bit more" he says while his smile takes a more lecherous twist, "I'm just not sure I can keep my hands off you."
\>You feel the air move around you as the summoners hands light up and begin drawing shapes
\>They suddenly stop and the room turns cold before a ribbon twirls into existence
\>It's deep red and made of a soft fabric
\>While it flows between your fingers you feel it's warm to the touch, a welcome feeling to the icy room you're in
\>Once you grab a hold of it the warmth and the cold disappear
\>The summoner coughs to get your attention and extends his hands, palm to palm, forward
\>"I wonder if there is any way you can stop them" he asks with a jovial tone
\>You can't help but laugh as you tie the summoners hands together with the ribbon
\>He always wins one way or another, but if it makes your job easier then you can indulge him
\>But for your sake you give it an extra knot
\>The demons breath turns wanting as he attempts to free himself of his bonds
\>While he struggles you lift him off the table and bend him over
\>You convince yourself that this is the optimal way to inspect his back, even if everything the manual has thought you says otherwise
\>Keeping your grip you take a step closer and the summoner gasps as your bodies eventually meet
\>You place your growing bulge in between the demons cheeks and carefully trail your hand over his smooth, blue neck
\>Underneath you feel that his trapezius and scalene are well formed
\>He hisses in delight as you press your fingers into the sinews and feel them give way
"Of everything I have seen yet your neck is the area of least concern" you inform the demon
\>He responds by crooning ever so softly
\>You move down to his spine and check on the connecting tissues
\>It's somewhat weak, could use some work but you can't really look into it as much as you want because he fidgets each time you touch his spine
\>While you check on his lower back you accidentally brush over his wings and he takes a sharp breath
\>Feeling that you deserve some payback for the kiss you grasp both his wings force your fingers into the soft flesh
\>The summoner throws his head and hands forward and groans through his teeth
\>"You're a tease, you know tha..." before he finishes his sentence you put a little more force into it
\>You don't stop until his breaths turns ragged, lucky for you he caved quickly
\>Looking down you see a waterfall painting the side of the table white
\>You haven't had the time to wash it after your last client so you feel no guilt in making it a bit more dirty
\>To your friends relief, you finally let go and tell him that you're finished
\>You try to take a step back, but you're stopped by a pair of slim legs being locked behind you
\>"You are not done yet Anon" the summoner says lustfully
\>He bucks back and grinds on your crotch slowly
\>"You still have one more area to check" he informs you, "Since you have been saving the best part of me for last you better not be gentle."
\>With that invitation you unzip you pants and let them fall to the floor
\>You stroke your member, trying to rouse it to even greater heights, before lining it up with against the demons hole
\>Once your tip brushed against his ring did you feel something press into your back
\>With an arcane push your cock head entered the demon once again
\>The summoner cursed the pleasure the entry gave while you had to ignore the loose, wet hole to not cum on the spot
\>"What's the matter? Lost some of your stamina while I was gone" the hellspawn asked jokingly
\>You could not respond as you fought a battle against yourself that you think you're winning
\>The summoner continued to tease you until you grabbed his wings once more and pulled the rest of yourself into him
\>That might not have been the best choice since you are back to square one in your struggle, but you are at least he can't tease you when you have him filled so deep.
\>You spend a few minutes in him, letting each other calm down and letting him adjust to you
\>Gently you start to hump the summoner, pulling more of your dick out with each flowing motion until you're screwing him with your whole length
\>A mix of "Anon", "Gods" and "more" escaped from the neglected mage as you stretched him wide
\>You get the feeling that it's been a long time since your last session as you don't remember where his prostate is
\>The summoner is more than willing to help as he meets your hips with a buck of his own, guiding your thrusts in his own delightful way.
\>When you do finally hit it a deep guttural moan vibrates through the summoner and you hear him struggling against his bonds
\>Try as he might, the ribbon will not break
\>He even bit into it as you pulled out
\>You see his hole slightly agape with some pre drooling out of it
\>The demon gathers some strength and says, "Did you finish already? I'm disappointed that I will have to resort use a toy to finish myself off"
\>He really does know how to push your buttons
\>Before he can come back with any other snide remarks you move your arms down and gracefully take hold of his warm demonic skin.
\>Before he can ask what your planning you flip him over onto his back with a hearty shove.
\>His face is deep red and argent energy sparks from his crown,
\>The ribbon looks untouched as he rests his arms on his chest
\>The demon gasps as you grip his pre covered shaft and squirms as you start stroking it
\>After ten agonizingly slow strokes you let go and dive back in
\>The summoner arches his back at the sudden intrusion and moans
\>You give neither of you any time to adjust and start hammering his hole
\>Each time you hilted more of the summoners infernal cum flowed out of him and pooled on his stomach
\>It was not long before he locked you in place again with his legs and begged you to go faster
\>Even though your knees protested that wish, you wanted the same as him
\>Locking your legs in place, you tightened your grip and prepared to show him what his actions have brought
\>You began to use him like a fleshlight.
\>At some point the summoner rose and placed his arms around your neck
\>You heard his needy breath and pleas for more as he hugged you
\>Despite your best efforts to hold back, you came
\>A wave of relief came over you as you pushed deeper than before
\>You felt each shot leave you, filling the demon with your cum
\>Overfilling might be the better word because you started to feel your cum push out and hit your crotch
\>In your afterglow you grabbed the demonic dick between you and stroked it fast
\>With you still pressing against his prostate and the feeling of getting filled, the summoner didn't last long before covering both of your chests in cum
\>Satisfied, the summoner rested his head atop of yours and tried to collect himself
\>"Sorry for teasing you a bit too much. I just wanted you to get into it" the summoner says with a content tone
\>You assure him that you would have gotten into it no matter what he said
\>He laughs at that and brings his hands to your front, presenting the red ribbon tying his hands
\>"If you would be so kind" he said with a smile
\>You take your hands of his hips and untie his hands
\>While you do so you pull out of him slowly
\>He shivers as the cool air rushes inside
\>Once his hands are free he cradles your head in one and gives you a peck on the cheek
\>He leaves as you begin cleaning the mess you've made
\>You're gonna go trough at least ten boxes of tissues to clean even half of his lewd mess
\>The door automatic door slides open and your friend leaves you, and the ribbon, in your office
\>Before the door closes you hear, "By the way Anon, I did my check up last week."
\>...
\>You should have blueballed him when you had the chance
