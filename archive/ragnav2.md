## Antivirus issues

Antivirus software has a profound dislike for Thor patcher, which is the stuff we use to send updated files to your client. Set the exception or will keep getting deleted/quarantined.

We have threads on /vg/.
**Warning: There are several resident schizos whose only purpose in life is to make up stories about cliques and internal drama. None of it is real, they do it on purpose to keep potential new player(like YOU) away from the game. Do not pay mind to bullshit posted in the thread.**
