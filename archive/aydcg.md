#####I. Shiketsu Academy
>Recommended music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD5_s1tGndw
Christopher controlled his breathing. "How many of our classmates have parents in the top 10?"

Inigo concluded the group call and recalled the tiny spy known as Gigan, leaving Christopher and Yui their privacy. He quickly typed into the "Council of True Love and War" group chat.

With a satisfied smile, Inigo put his phone back into his blazer's inner pocket. He took a deep breath and jumped off his perch outside the Science Room's window. For a brief moment, he allowed himself to fall before spreading his wings and soaring into the sky. Inigo flew higher and higher, until he was above the school, and then headed westward.

The sky was covered in clouds, providing him ample cover as he flew across the city. He had decided to skip the second half of the school day. Too much of his free time had been spent gently guiding the fragile threads of love. It was better not to tempt fate and let nature take control again. Besides, it would've been a shitty VN if people just made choices for you. Chris was about to hit the second act, where the flags were more important.

He rolled over on his back, and segmented wings moved to keep him afloat. His head leaned back against his hands. Chris and Yui would find their own paths eventually. Even if they don't get together, this was a victory for the class as a whole. It'd bring 1-D closer, plus he hated the idea of two of his friends fighting. The Five had told Inigo all about Christopher's mother, and he felt partly responsible for his uncle luring the Five to Kyoto. If they hadn't found that package that one night, and if he hadn't advised his uncle about the Night Parade, maybe Chris wouldn't have gotten hurt. Inigo sighed and slowed his speed.

*Still not talking to me, bud?*

Gigan replied with a short, sharp noise in his mind. The dragon hadn't been very happy with him lately. Inigo adjusted his tie and flew down at an angle. He spotted Valiant Park down below and landed next to a statue. The park was filled with people enjoying the first beautiful day since the unexpected storm four days ago.

*That's fine!*

He fished out a ball from a pond and tossed it back to a group of children.

*Cause today we're doing good deeds!*

He zipped around, collecting litter and cleaning up park tables.

*I've got to be ready for tonight.*

He flew an elderly couple across the street while dodging a traffic cop.

*Who needs a license anyway?*

He helped a stranded pizza delivery girl.

*I'll make do without one for now.*

He landed his dragon next to a remote bus stop.

"You girls need a ride?"

Fingerguns.

#####II. Lucky Snappy Soup Kitchen

It was hard work running the sexiest dragon taxi service in Kyoto. But he still had more to do. Inigo felt tired as he adjusted his cooking apron and waited for his soup kitchen shift to get busy. Gigan had finally calmed down and was cooking soup in the back. He checked the time on his phone. The final bell at Shiketsu will ring soon. He looked up and saw people filing in from his position in the food line.

After a few minutes, he got into his usual routine of ladling soba and miso soup while offering warm greetings and small talk to the now familiar crowd. Even if Gigan didn't force him into this work, he felt guilty for being away for so long. They really needed volunteers, and with his quirk, he could easily fill the roles of three people. It also made him feel good inside.

He had made some friends here. He glanced at the dining hall and the soup kitchen's regulars. Most of them were just normal people who were turned away from society, usually due to mental health issues or just rotten luck. Half of them also had quirks that made them unseemly, and they could've easily turned into villains if their quirk was stronger. There was "Oziwo," whose black tongue was three times longer than normal and served as an extra limb. "Juko", who could blow a weak but concentrated stream of wind from his ears, and "McStrangler", well, Inigo didn't know what his quirk was, but he did give very good hugs.

Inigo's eyes narrowed as he spotted an unusual fellow in the crowd of people in line.

*It's that big blue guy again, and he brought a friend.*

He had no feathers, but if not for his stylish shades and unreal drip, he'd look exactly like that villain he saw Impakt fighting that one night with The Boys®. The first time Inigo saw the blue guy here, he raised his defenses and kept an eye on him all night. This was the eighth time he'd come to the Lucky Snappy Soup Kitchen, and from what Inigo observed, the dude just wanted soup.

The big blue guy stopped in front of Inigo's station. "This is good soup here. You will take some," the blue guy said to the curvaceous woman in front of him. He pointed at the two steaming pots in front of Inigo. The tall woman wore shades and a large trench coat.

"It's your fault we lost all our pizza." She growled. "But this does look tasty." She bit her lower lip and held out her tray. Intense purple eyes peeked at Inigo from behind her sunglasses. There was a hunger there. She was staring at Inigo the way Hoge did when he accidentally got an A on a test that one time.

"What's in it?" The woman grinned, showing off two rows of very sharp-looking teeth.

"This one has tofu, seaweed, and daikon radish. The other's soba noodles with green onions. They're great!"

"No meat?"

"Nope. We're fresh out. How bout' I save you some next time?" Inigo winked reflexively.

"I'd like that." She licked her lips. "I'll take both."

He gave her a polite grin and ladled extra soup on both of their trays. Gigan plopped down a hot potato wrapped in foil for each of them.

"Enjoy the food," said Inigo with a bright smile.

The woman snorted and made her way to the dining hall. The blue man just stood there and looked at Inigo like he was expecting something. Inigo stared back.

"Hello?"

"You are friend of Jenkins, yes?" the horned fellow questioned.

"Yeah, you knew the grouchy bastard?" said Inigo in surprise.

"He was good buddy. This is for you, from corpse in river." He said, as he handed Inigo a stained, crumbled-up envelope. It smelled of blood and sewage.

Inigo wrinkled his nose and picked up the envelope with his thumb and index finger. "Thanks.."

"You are welcome. It is good soup." The blue man took a big bite of his hot potato with the foil still on it. He grunted before joining his friend.

Inigo raised a brow and looked down at the envelope. Curiousity got the better of him. He switched places with Gigan to go to the backroom.

!!! note Jenkin's letter

	Hey kid. If you're reading thi-

The rest of the message was covered in some kind of dark green mold. He couldn't remove it without damaging the paper. Sighing, he stuck the letter in a ziplock bag and slipped it inside his blazer. Why would Jenkins write him a letter? The old man had worked for Inigo's grandfather, and Inigo had known him all his life. But he didn't think Jenkins was that emotional.

*You were a big softie all along; weren't you old timer?*

His eyes closed, and he felt a surge of sadness go through his body, He lingered in it for a moment before stifling it with a forced grin. There was still a lot of soup to ladle before his shift was over.

#####III. Shiketsu Highschool
Inigo flew towards the school. He felt lucky that the sun was still up. The gates were full of students leaving the school after their club activities. His eyes scanned the crowd of kids from above. In Class 1D, there was one person he knew he could always count on. Someone who's never let him down. An honest-to-god badass. Inigo grinned widely and swooped down.

Hiro had been walking home from school. He found himself trailing behind two tall girls he was familiar with. They were chatting and giggling about something. He wondered if their conversation was about him. He unconsciously slowed his pace so there would be more distance between him and the girls.

"What'cha doin', bro?"

Inigo grinned as he hovered upside down above Hiro. He flew to match the master alchemist's pace.

"Oh, hey, Inigo. Nothing. I'm just going home. You shouldn't be using your quirk in public, man."

"I know you wouldn't rat me out, buddy!" Inigo said as he backflipped in mid-air and landed on the ground. "How was class? Did I miss anything fun?"

"You missed a lot of work. Where did you go after lunch?"

"That's a secret. Just pretend I was in a romantic rendezvous." Inigo said as he walked beside Hiro. "You know we missed ya at Operation Council of War and Love. Why didn't you join us?"

Hiro shrugged and said, "I saw the group invite, but I didn't think I could offer much love advice."

"What?! Bro, you're like the best. We could've used your experience, plus it's about Yui."

"I dunno. There's still the no-dating policy. You guys might've gotten in trouble if you were caught." Hiro stared to the side with his hands in his pockets. "I just want to keep my head down and not get held back again."

"Naruhudo." Inigo nodded and turned to Hiro with a smile. "I just don't think it's worth missing an entire year of your youth over. You should still take chances. I thought it was cool you joined us for karaoke."

"Nene asked me to come along. I can't say no to her," Hiro explained.

Inigo grinned. "Oh, I see! Are you on your own love quest, senpai?"

"Don't call me that. We sit next to each other in class. It's weird."

"Okay, but you didn't deny the love quest!"

"You're not going to do that thing you did with Chris, are you?" Hiro sighed.

"I'm through messing with the threads of love's tapestry. Honestly, I think it gives me bad luck in love. But I can still be your loyal bro." He gave Hiro a thumbs-up.

"I wasn't planning on doing anything."

Inigo pointed discreetly in front of them. "But you were staring at those two girls like you were up to something, man."

"Eh? Well, that was cause." Hiro glanced at the two girls. "They're from my class last year. I wanted to see if they'd recognize me."

"Oh, really?" Inigo's eyes shone mischievously.

"But it looks like they don't. I didn't want to creep them out by following them, but this is my regular route home."

"I gotcha, bro!" Inigo ran forward to intercept the two girls.

"Inigo! Don't!" Hiro stood still as he watched Inigo talk to the girls.
***
"I'm Myoga Inigo! Nice to meet you, Ume-sempai! Hina-sempai!" Inigo called out and bowed, grinning.

"Oh stop! We're not that much older than you, Myoga-kun." The girls giggled.

"And you girls already know Hiro, right?" Inigo stepped back, so he's behind Hiro.

"Hey," said Hiro coolly.

The girls turned to look at each other in confusion before one of them suddenly pointed. "Oh yeah, I remember you. You used to be in our class, Kyoda-kun."

"He's the ace of 1-D! You should've seen him wrecking it in our battle training. Led his team to victory too." Inigo proclaimed it proudly.

"Oh really? That's a lot different from last year." Ume said, smiling, as she twirled a finger through her brown hair.

"What happened last year?" Inigo asked eagerly.

"I don't think Inigo needs to know about that," Hiro said firmly.

"Oh." Hina seemed taken aback. "Yeah, it's probably old news." She looked away awkwardly.

"Actually! We stopped you for a reason!" Inigo smirked. "You girls like karaoke?"

"We love it!" Hina said, excited again.

"How would you like to go with Hiro and me?  Tomorrow after class? We know a good place. Our treat." Inigo put on his brightest smile.

The girls exchanged looks, and Ume spoke first. "It has been awhile. We have band practice tomorrow, but we'll come if you wait for us."

"Then it's a date!" Inigo grinned.
***
Inigo and Hiro watched the girls leave together.

"You're a lucky man, Hiro." He patted Hiro's shoulder. "Those two girls agreed to go on a date with you so quickly. I'm already taken, so I'll leave it to you, bro. Don't let me down."

"What? You can't really expect me to-"

"By the way!" Inigo cut him off, excitedly. "I have this letter, is there a way you can remove the mold from this?"

Hiro stared at the mold, and his face turned serious and analytical. "Alternaria tenuissima. Trace amounts of stachybotrys." Inigo could only understand every other word. "-and use an anionic surfactant of the alkylbenzenesulfonate. A dilution combining 5% sodium hypochlorite, an aqueous solution containing NaOCl, with deionized water. Intergrating triazole or quaternary ammonium compounds-"

"So you got it right?" Inigo asked, breaking off Hiro's concentration.

"Yeah. There's many ways around this. I'll do some tests on the paper. I could get you the solution tomorrow."

"I knew you could do it! I owe you one man." Inigo winked and gave him a thumbs-up.

"Then come with me tomorrow."

"What!? But it's YOUR date! You're not going to stand up two of your old classmates, are ya? Cute girls too." Inigo grinned eagerly. "I might swing by to check how you're doing, though. You can keep the favor I owe you."

"What am I supposed to do?"

"That's easy, first you-"

The two friends kept talking as they walked. The sunset behind them brushed everything with an orange glow.

#####VI. Unmarked Van


He sat uncomfortably inside the van with The Five and Junichi. Desolator was driving them to the next Sahugin location. It was a big job, one that required them to split their forces. The Five would attack the heavily guarded left wing of the manor, while Junichi and him would sneak in from the right. Last time they met, Inigo had fought against the Five and had gotten a very obvious result. Now they were on the same team again.

Mercury grinned at him as the mercenary inserted bullets into a magazine. "We're good now, yeah. Myoga? We had to protect the boss. You know the deal." Tether also offered him an apologetic nod.

He gave them a nod and smiled. "Yeah, we're square."

The Five had been able to renew their contract with Taizo. Desolator pushed for more money and a clause allowing them to take action if they were attacked by Christopher again, in return, they were to stay their hand when it comes to Inigo and his classmates, and they used their connection with the government to target rival yakuza groups in the city. His uncle had been fairly quiet about the whole thing. Taizo wasn't the type to hold his feelings and words back. Inigo was sure he would've gotten yelled at by now for messing with the family business. The fact that he hasn't been punished is disquieting.

"Almost there." Desolator said from the driver's seat. His eyes reflected off the rearview mirror and met Inigo's. "You have some interesting classmates at Shiketsu, young man. What are your opinions on Last Rite?"

Inigo furrowed his brow before responding. "Huh? That's Sally's hero name." He shrugged. "She's my friend. Cool. Kinda hilarious, actually."

"I figured you two would get along."

Inigo's voice felt quiet as he looked down. "I wouldn't say we get along. She's got a temper, but she cares a lot more than she lets on. Very opinionated and strong-willed. She's got a lot of stuff bubbling underneath." He sighed and smiled at the same time. Why does Sally remind him of Hoge for some reason? The two seemed a lot alike now that he thought about it.

"I recognize that sigh. You two an item?" Desolator seemed amused.

"You're not two-timing, are you, Myoga?" Maddox accused him suddenly. "And to think I was supporting your ship."

"W-what? No! She's with someone else! She's very committed too!" Inigo defended himself. "And why are you shipping people?" He pointed back at Maddox.

She shrugged and said, "When in Japan, do as the Japanese do." Mercury chuckled.

Desolator's eyes seemed to twinkle. "So she has an attachment, does she?"

Junichi looked up from his phone and nudged Inigo. *Crap* He recognized the look on Desolator's face; he might've said too much. "Why are you even asking about my class, Sam?" 

Sally's gun-nun quirk would be useful for mercenaries, Inigo thought. He had noted in his girl-stats notebook that she got into some trouble back in the US. He wasn't sure exactly what, though. She used guns and never seemed to use her nun healing spells either. He'd have to look into it at some point.

Desolator put on an unnerving and polite smile. "I'm just making conversation, young man."

#####VI. Hebii Estate

The night air hung heavy with tension as the two boys surveyed the scene before them, their eyes fixed on the imposing manor across the street. Shadows danced eerily in the moonlight, lending an air of foreboding to the operation they were about to undertake.

"Thanks for comin' along," Inigo quipped. He grinned excitedly as he adjusted his modified Ryu-kishi helmet. "We're here to set things right."

Junichi's violet eyes narrowed, his face etched with a brooding intensity. "As long as I get paid, I'm all for it. I hate these bastards who think they own the world." he sneered, his voice laced disdain.

Inigo's cocksure grin grew. "Don't worry, you'll get your cut. And we'll make sure these guys never hurt anyone again."

"On your call," Junichi answered.

>Recommended music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_PFIuOwmig

With a swift motion, Inigo leaped off the rooftop, and Junichi followed suit, the wind rushing past their costumes as they plummeted towards their target. Adrenaline coursed through their veins, heightening their senses and sharpening their focus.

They crashed through a window, shattered glass cascading around them like rain. Chaos erupted as the room's occupants, a group of Sahugin henchmen, unleashed a hail of bullets upon the intruders. But Inigo was prepared. Gigan materialized into a protective barrier that withstood the onslaught. The barrier doubled, and then tripled as the pair ran across the room.

While Inigo held the line, Junichi unleashed his bone quirk with savagery. His body contorted unnaturally as jagged bones erupted from his flesh, becoming deadly weapons under his command. A dance of violence unfolded as Junichi tore through their enemies, leaving behind a trail of broken bodies in his wake. Inigo saw a smile on Junichi's face as his quirk pinned a man to the ceiling with a large bone spike.

"Hey! You're going too hard, man! Gotta keep it clean." Inigo yelled.

A cold, unsettling chuckle escaped Junichi's lips. "Clean? I don't see why they deserve it." he said, the darkness in his tone sending shivers down Inigo's spine. "Their world is a cesspool, and I'm just adding to the filth." A trail of bone spikes ripped through his arm and into a man's leg.

Inigo's brow furrowed as he grabbed one of the guns from a thug and struck them down with its butt end. "They're just hired thugs. We've come for their boss."

"Should I ask them politely to fucking lay down? I'm already targeting non-vital organs for you!" Junichi said it coldly.

"Oh yeah? What else would you do for me?" Inigo teased as he wrapped the last man in the room in a foam construct bubble.

"Anything."

"Whoa. Same, bro."

They shared a look when suddenly the entire building rumbled. Pieces of the ceiling started to fall as wall furniture crashed around them.

The doorway out of the room slowly opened. Standing in the doorway was a hulking figure, towering over the fallen debris. He was a mountain of muscle, with tattoos covering his bare arms, neck, and even his shaved head. The flickering light cast shadows on his chiseled features, and a dark, menacing expression was carved into his face. Inigo recalled what he knew about him.

!!! note Villain Name:「Sahulor」

	Quirk:「Molten Rock」

	Type: Emitter

	Description: He can cover his body in hardened obsidian like an exo-skeleton. The hardened obsidian can be thrown as heated molten rock. Each rock explodes upon impact or at a delayed timer.

Sahulor sneered at his fallen henchmen. "I never could find good help. I'll just do this myself." He cracked his neck, and sleek, jagged rocks formed over his skin.

"We've got ourselves the big one," Inigo called out in a determined voice.

Junichi's eyes gleamed with a touch of sadistic glee as he cracked his knuckles. "About time," he muttered, the ghost of a smile spreading across his face.

The colossal villain charged toward them, his muscles bulging with each step. Inigo quickly formed a defensive barrier around them, hoping to buy some time. The explosive rocks launched by the villain collided with the barrier, causing it to ripple and crack under the immense force.

"Stay close!" Inigo shouted, his eyes locked on the approaching danger. "We need to coordinate our attacks!"

The villain, Sahulor, roared as he swung a massive, obsidian-covered fist towards Inigo and Junichi. Inigo's barrier shattered under the impact, and he was sent flying across the room, crashing into a wall.

Junichi leaped at Sahulor, his bone blades slashing through the air. But the villain was no pushover. With a swift movement, Sahulor sidestepped the attack, his hardened exoskeleton deflecting the blades with ease. He threw a row of exploding rocks, causing the ceiling to collapse in front of Junichi. Junichi rolled backwards but was caught by a delayed explosion from one of the rocks. He started to retreat.

"Thanks for the opening!" Inigo joined the fight, adorned in his knight armor, as he slammed a construct lance into Sahulor's hardened skin. The head of the lance transformed into a large drill, and Inigo thrust it forward, shattering the rocks in Sahulor's chest.

Sahulor started to chuckle. "You think that's enough? The rocks started to reform. Small explosions ripped apart the air around Inigo. The obsidian rocks on his skin exploded around Sahulor, sending Inigo flying.

Inigo fell to the ground and started to retreat to regroup with Junichi.

Explosion after explosion filled the room. Sahulor laughed and stalked the boys. "What's the matter? Scared?"
***
Junichi and Inigo ran down the hallway and into a library.

"His armor keeps coming back. I can't get inside," Junichi growled as he turned towards Inigo; his right arm was covered in painful burns.

"We need a strong push to get his armor and take him out. He's vulnerable underneath," Inigo said, leaning down, breathing hard as his mind raced. His body ached; he still felt his injuries from Gawa Village. He needed Junichi to carry this.

"I'm a little tired," Junichi replied, which surprised Inigo. "You were right; I shouldn't have gone so hard on the henchmen."

"Nah, don't worry about it," Inigo said, standing up.

"Should we just run?"

Inigo shook his head. "Hey Junichi. Shiketsu is an amazing school. Hero society is meant to help everyone. It's a fair system so everyone can live well. Majestic is a good teacher and the perfect hero. "

"What the fuck did you just say?" Junichi growled as his purple eyes lit up violently.

"Use the anger as fuel, bro." Inigo grinned, and he kept it up. "They didn't take you into the school because you're not hero material, not because of your quirk. The government is good. No cute girl will ever like you because you're such a grouch! All your ideals are just Legion propaganda, and they don't send you into missions because you're weak and pathetic. Also, your piercings are lame."

Junich roared and punched through the wall with a bone-covered arm, leaving nothing but a hole. "That last one's a low blow."

"Yeah, I went too far. Sorry. Your piercings are great, man," said Inigo apologetically.

"Let's just get this bastard," hissed Junichi.
***
They met Sahulor again in the middle of a large hallway.

"Ah, there you are. Ready to beg for mercy?" Sahulor said as he created a large obsidian rock around his fist. It sizzled and hissed, burning the air around it.

Inigo shook his head. "You're in trouble now. He's mad." He stepped aside, revealing his revolutionary friend. Inigo willed Gigan to form dark armor around Junichi and increased his strength.

Junichi's body trembled with unsuppressed rage, his eyes glowing with an unsettling intensity. He could feel the power within him surging, his quirk responding to the depths of his fury. Bones erupted from his body, longer and sharper than ever before. He tapped into his inner demons.

"This world, this rotten society... it deserves to BURN!" he spat out, his voice filled with bitterness.

With a primal roar, Junichi charged at Sahulor, his bone spears slicing through the air with incredible force. Each strike was fueled by his anger and his desire to prove himself and show the world the true strength of his terrifying quirk.

Sahulor, caught off guard by Junichi, found himself struggling to defend. The hardened obsidian exoskeleton cracked and shattered under the relentless assault, molten rocks exploding harmlessly as they met Junichi's bone barrage and Gigan's enhancements. He could only defend, changing his stance so that his vulnerable points weren't exposed. He regrew his armor rapidly while trying to swat away Junichi, but as Sahulor attacked, Junichi just ate every attack and returned it. Blood poured from the young man's mouth.

Inigo watched, his eyes wide with concern. He felt scared.

*Maybe I went too far with this one.*

He joked that Junichi's anger was basically bottomless, but not to this point. He focused on himself. He had his own job to do. He needed to time his own attack carefully.

As a chunk of Sahulor's back armor crumbled, Inigo saw his chance. He dashed around Sahulor and snuck forward. Before the villain could respond, Inigo was already on him. He channeled his energy into a single attack. "CRASH DRAGONCLAW!" Gigan erupted around Inigo's palm, taking the form of a single dragon claw. The claw collided and pierced Sahulor; clawed fingers formed around the single claw, creating a hand that reached into the cracks of his armor. It enveloped him. The large dragon's hand squeezed hard, crushing the rest of his armor and leaving him vulnerable to Junichi.

It was done.

"I'm kind of glad you got that out of your system." Inigo whistled.

"Shut up!" Junichi growled, looking left and right for more enemies to fight.
***
The two boys stood side by side as they watched Sahulor's beaten and wheezing form on the ground.

"I need to know why you did it. Why did you attack Kyoto?" Inigo growled out

Sahulor coughed up blood, looking up at them with disdain. "Hahaha. Is that why you're here? You don't know, do you? Taizo paid us to attack Jenkin's troop. He's working with this nut from Osaka. White hair, golden dragon—it almost looks like yours, kid. He even got The Five and the government running in his own little game. It's a fucking massacre for control of Kyoto."

Inigo's blood froze.

"He's lying. Let's get rid of him," Junichi said as he extended a boneclaw.

"Yeah, he is. But just knock him out. I want to take him to my uncle myself."
