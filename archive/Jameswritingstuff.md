**Name:** James Page
**Face:** Long face, usually with a neutral expression. Eyebags are not an uncommon sight.
**Hair:** Wavy dark blonde hair. Kept impeccable and in place with a nifty charm. Otherwise quite messy.
**Eyes:** Green-greyish. 
**Height:** Very tall. 
**Bodytype:** Almost gaunt. Fit enough due to physical activity and Quidditch. Naturally wide shoulders and chicken legs.
**Complexion:** Not overly pale, but enough to get sunburnt quickly. Has a small scar on the eyebrow and a bite scar on his right forearm.
**Uniform variation:** Wears an overcoat outside school grounds. It's heavy but roomy, and he thinks it makes him look cool. Likes comfy woolly jumpers. 
**Misc:** Gets a tiny bit of freckles from sun exposure.

**Voice:** Low pitched with a neutral accent. A weird, hard to identify accent may pop up if he gets particularly passionate in his speech.
**Body language:** Stands straight and has a very calm demeanor; neck's a bit forward due to his height. Has a closed-mouth smile, unless the *Faceappus* spell is cast upon him.
**Social:** Slightly introverted, but sociable and well mannered enough to make fast friends. Formal relationship with most of the staff. Doesn't bully people intentionally.
**Visibility:** Very tall, very visible. Can't really melt in the crowd even if he wanted to.
**Engagement:** He'll politely approach strangers if he has business with them, is friendly enough when approached- most of the time.
**Quirks:** Eclectic, holds several interests. Quite lazy, sometimes smug. Mostly calm and assertive, a bit volatile when dealing with Deek-induced rage etc.
**Things your character wouldn't do:** Make a scene or show vulnerability.
**Animals:** Loves most animals, his best grades are from CMC. Quite repulsed by bugs though, with a few exceptions like ants and bees.

**Writing hooks**
-He grew up in an ancient, decadent Pureblood family from his father side (although he recently took his mother's last name), which hails from the Alps. Thus he's quite used to the pompous, snobby background of old fashioned Pureblood families, but doesn't necessarily share *all* the views and behavioural quirks that come with it.
-Has a discrete knowledge of the Dark Arts.
-He loves mountains, woods and walking. He takes comfort in the nostalgic, longing feelings that nature provides. *Sehnsucht.*
-He can also be quite indoorsy- especially when enjoying a cozy fireplace while reading a book, preferably with bad weather outside. Everything comfy entices him.
-Will sing, badly, when drunk. Will not dance, as he's well aware he'd look like a wobbling praying mantis if he did.
-Proficient Quidditch Seeker, and surprisingly one of the fastest students on a broom despite his size. (2:06:12 coastal broom trial, Quidditch be praised)
