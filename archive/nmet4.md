To be 17 again Ch.5.

*"It's just like my heart feels at home with you."*

~*~

“And that sums up just about everything we talked about.” You told Matsuri while reading a paper. “Any questions?”

“None.” She replied.

“Good. Remember, it’s okay to play your character, but don’t go overboard.”

“Yes.”

With that, you finished one part of your workday. Now all you had to do was to double check her schedule.

Anytime between 4 and 5pm, anyone can have a 10 minute break, most use it to smoke a cigarette or to browse their phone, some don’t take it because it’s not enough time for anything. You went and sat in the lunchroom by yourself after getting a coffee from a vending machine. Blowing on it a few times you realized someone else was in the room.

“Oh hey, Anon!” Said Mio, who was seated not far from you. You got up and sat next to her, almost greeting her with a kiss after showing her your lips in the form of a small “o” before you checked that no one was watching, Mio got impatient and pulled you gently by your tie to kiss you.

“Mwa!~” She exclaimed in a playful tone. You blushed.

“How’s work?” She asked you.

“Great, actually, Matsuri has been rather cooperative since you… scolded her.”

Mio had a victorious air to her and a slight red in her cheeks. 

“W-Well, I didn’t want anyone else to lay their hands on *my* man…” She said as she drew circles with her finger in your chest, causing your heartbeat to panic. Mio noticed your expression and she giggled with no malice.

“What’s wrong, Anon?~”

“It’s just that, you know, being called *your* man is a bit… I mean, eh…”

Mio gave you a sweet peck on your cheek, and so, you two shared the moment in complete silence.

An alarm went off in your pocket, the break was over. You downed your coffee in one go and got up.

“See you later then, Mio.”

Mio waved you goodbye and looked at her cup pensively. There was nothing in the world she wished for more than to enjoy herself with you freely.

~*~

Over the past few days, Mio came back to a quiet, almost empty house. Her husband and her didn’t speak anymore, at most she’d tell him food was ready and he’d eat in silence, always leaving a half-full plate.

Tonight, he got dressed up as Mio as serving dinner.

“I’m going out tonight.” He told Mio. She didn’t ask where.

“Take care.” 

Her husband left and his car’s engine faded out in the distance.

Alone but not lonely, Mio ate her dinner and got in bed. By this point, her husband most likely figured out her façade.

When she had some time, she’d go to a law firm and get a divorce going. 

“And after that…” She told herself, as she imagined having her own place, maybe a comfy apartment for herself, as well as going out with Anon freely, taking him back to her place to “show him around”, or very well, skipping dinner one night to wake up in his bed, embraced by his loving arms as his girlfriend.

With those sweet scenarios Mio fumbled for a bit in bed, unable to sleep, her hand subconsciously began rubbing around her womanhood, before she knew it, she split her legs and began masturbating, hopelessly she touched herself, her body burning like a candle, but she couldn’t find any satisfaction. 

~*~

You sat in your chair, letting out a sight. Another day, another dollar. You booted up your computer and reached for the drawer in which you kept your following assignments. Without looking you put your hand inside and found something else inside, a tiny packet. You turned your attention to it, and took it out. Something, wrapped inside a brown paper. Written over it with a pretty font and delicate handwriting, it said: “For my beloved.” 

You carefully unwrapped the package and inside found a slice of dry cake. 

“Mio, you…”

You looked endearingly at the pastry. You hadn’t seen anything like it on a store. Mio had probably made this herself. Soft in your hand, chewy in your mouth. There wasn’t a single thing Mio did that didn’t amaze you.

With that, you also thought to yourself what were you doing for her. Ramen was nice and all, but Mio, she deserved much better than just that. Sulking over the thoughts of your dreaded apartment, you wished that one day you could treat Mio as she deserved. 

This last thought wouldn’t let up as you began sorting out papers and schedules. You wanted to give her the very best of you.

Coming home you squeezed your pillow between your arms thinking of Mio, biting it as if it was her shoulder, massaging it as if it was her deliciously pudgy belly. Your body ached, not in pain but in need.

You checked her schedule and looked for a day both of you were off work, next Saturday would work. You’d ask her in the morning, but the rising anxiety kept you up for a good while. Where should you take her? What do women of her age and type like? You scratched your head for ideas, anything that you thought would be worthwile. If necessary, you'd ask for an advance on your paycheck.


~*~

You sorted out some paperwork before getting in an elevator, still checking them once inside it. The elevator stopped at the second floor, a few people got in, including Mio who stood next to you. She greeted you with a smile which you returned. On the third floor, more people got in and the elevator became extremely crowded. 

Still going over the papers, you felt a hand creeping down your back, stopping at your butt before giving it a gentle squeeze. You looked over to Mio, red faced, trying her best to appear oblivious to everything around her. Mio’s hand slid to the side of your hip and soon to the front of your pelvis, Mio gave a good gentle rub to your member, clasping both your penis and balls in her hand as she swayed it gently up and down and side to side. After a bit she slid one of her fingers, cold from the winter inside your pants. She playfully touched your penis, slowly growing in size while you tried to keep your cool, taking deep breaths as quietly as possible, looking at the papers without reading a single word.

The elevator stopped at every floor, each time, someone outside tried to fit in, got rejected by the weight limit and stood outside, then the doors closed slowly and the same story repeated on the next floor, all the while Mio’s hand did a number on you, Mio slid more of her hand inside, her fingers trying to get a hold of your member while your belt resisted her advances. You wished for this torture to stop, but at the same time you wanted the elevator to go on for 10 more floors. Finally, most people reached their destination at the sixth and got off. As the people left, Mio quickly pulled her hand away back to her and gave you a sly, teasy look as she got off.

You missed your floor, and went back down two by yourself. Working with the lewd thoughts that fermented in your head was incredibly difficult.


~*~

Mio finished her stream and checked her phone, delighted to see “Anon manager” in the notifications. She sent you a text back and got up from the chair, ready to go about her day, your almost instant reply caught her off guard.

After a bit of formal chit chat, you asked Mio if she had anything to do that Saturday. She smiled to herself as she began typing.

~*~

“It was supposed to be a date.” You told yourself, finding yourself in your apartment, watching Mio cook a steak in your stove. Once you two met at the station, greeting each other with much love, Mio began making small talk as she walked to the platform of the train you took home. Before you knew it you were in a small convenience store together, as Mio asked what you wanted to eat while you replied with dry enthusiasm.

Mio served you a plate of steak that could’ve easily passed for a gourmet dish. Perfectly seared on the outside with a certain crisp that made love to your ears as you cut it, juicy and pink on the inside and served with mashed potatoes and salad.

While you ate the meal with delight, Mio knew something was bothering you.

“Something the matter, Anon?” She asked with a certain worry.

“Oh, it’s nothing. It’s just that I thought we’d do something more special.” You replied as you noticed a sudden hint of sadness in Mio’s eyes, piercing your heart.

“I-I don’t mean that I’m not enjoying this, it’s just that, I wanted to take you out somewhere…nicer, than… this place.” You said, as you laid back on your chair. Now more than ever your situation was taking downing on you. Despite earning some decent money working with cover, you didn’t spend much of it on yourself. You were still living on this shitty apartment without proper heating and were making a girl as fine and pretty as Mio eat dinner in a folding table with old cutlery and plates. Mio giggled.

“What?” You asked.

“I guess that’s just you then, Anon.” Mio said. “All I could’ve asked for is here. It’s been a while since we could share a home cooked meal together, right?” 

“Y-Yeah, I guess.” You said as you blushed.

“Plus!” Mio added. “Since we’re here, we can go straight for dessert after this.”

“I guess you’re right, what would you like?”

Mio contained her laughter at your obliviousness, her eyes looking at you in an endearing way, making you even more confused until you realized what she meant. You kept eating your steak pretending nothing had happened, and Mio then bursted into laughter.

“S-Shut up!” You said in a jokey tone, completely red faced.

~*~

“Do you like it, Anon?” Said Mio as she leaned forward, sticking out to you her massive ass in her jeans, the shape her bottom took was incredible.

“I love it, Mio.”

“You do?~” She asked as she unbuttoned her jeans, slowly beginning to pull them halfway down, her meaty ass overflowed her pants as your mouth almost began to water.

“Yes.” You replied to Mio, as the piece of clothing slowly revealed more and more of her, Mio was wearing a black thong, held together by two knots in each side. She swayed her hips from side to side slowly, up and down, giving you a piece of eye candy as it jiggled without losing its form. Mio legs were looking firmer than before, perhaps her dancing lessons had taken an effect on her.

Mio finished taking off her jeans and slowly approached you with a sensual strut, you sat in bed and watched as she sat her butt on top of your bare legs and above your member. Mio turned to face you and caressed your face gently as she gently rubbed your penis with her free hand, she pulled down your underwear and sandwiched you between her thighs. Mio gave you a soft peck on your cheek, asking for your attention, your hands ran under her shirt and played with her breasts as you and Mio exchanged kisses. She then began rubbing your member between her legs in tiny, short jumps, as her flower became more and more drenched by the second. Without hurry, she leaned over you and you two fell on top of the bed, making out in loud, wet kisses. Mio kissed your neck as she began undressing you, your hands got a firm hold of her butt, massaging it and squeezing it gently. Your hands ran under her shirt and tried to undo her bra, but you couldn’t figure it out, Mio giggled and gave you instructions, where to pinch and what to pull, a bult formed in her shirt, the bra was hanging from her.

“Good job Anon~” She teased you. Red faced, you took off her shirt and assaulted her lower neck.

“Ah! So feisty~” She giggled again.

Mio’s comments were starting to bother you, so you pulled an ace from under your sleeve. You grabbed her head and pulled her in for a kiss, turning both of you to the side, just as Mio wrapped her arms around you and her nails began teasing your back, you reached for her fluffy ears. Mio felt your hand get close, you pulled away from her and looked at her, nervous, embarrassed, red like a beet, looking at you waiting for the inevitable. She didn’t stop you as your hands began scratching her ears, rubbing them with your nails, Mio in turn made some of the most obscene faces you could imagine, her eyes barely open, her teeth clenching as bits of drool and exasperated pants escaped her mouth. Her nails dug into your back just like before, but this time with much greater force, she was going to leave some severe scratch marks for sure.

Mio brought herself lower to your pelvis and sniffed the scent of your cock. She stuck her nose between your shaft and your balls and began taking long, deep sniffs. You didn’t let her ears go either. Mio sucked on your balls, smoothing out the wrinkles in your scrotum with her mouth before licking you from base to tip and then pushing you into her throat in one go. You didn’t contain your moans, there was nothing to fear as these two lovebirds expressed their love, hidden from the rest of world inside their nest, her eyes opened in a squint, Mio kept an eye on your expressions, as delicious as the first time she took you in her mouth. Mio pulled back to breathe, her saliva all over your cock, and after a deep breath she took you in again, this time bobbing her head up and down. Stopping a second time, Mio slapped her cheek with your dick and rubbed her head against it.

“Anon, do it, please.” Mio turned around and got in all fours before you, her pussy dripping all over your sheets, seeing her being this submissive, the teasy Mio that always knew how to push your buttons, awakened something in you.

You hot dogged your cock between her butt cheeks and began teasing Mio in turn.

“Do what?” You asked her, gently thrusting your hips back and forth.

“Me, Anon.” Mio turned back to you with a desperate look. “Please, put it inside me now.” 

You lined the tip with the entrance to her garden, Mio tried pushing back but you pulled back, her feet tapped on the bed in her rising lust.

“Anon please…please…” Mio begged you. You leaned over close to her ear and whispered into it. 

“Tell me what you want, baby.”

Mio swallowed. 

“I want your cock Anon, deep inside me.”

“Okay~” You whispered again as you gently bit her ear and pushed yourself inside. The sudden gesture made Mio scream in pleasure. Her creamy insides welcomed you back after so long, she tightened herself involuntarily as you pushed, letting you out only to harden their grip around you when you pushed back inside. Pulling away from Mio’s ears, you marveled yourself at her butt, with each trust, it jiggled like jelly, you groped her butt cheek with your hands and saw just how much you could clench them, regaining its hypnotizing form as you let go. Mio had fallen onto your bedsheet and was drooling all over them, letting out pants of pleasure and loud moans with every thrust.

“Oh God…” You said.

“I love it Anon, I love you, I love you so much.” She said in between her breaths, wanting to see her face, you turned her around and kept going.

Mio shut her moans with your mouth, you brought both of her legs over your shoulders and kept railing her with all the pent-up lust you had.

“M-Mio, I’m close.” You told her. Mio saw an opportunity and brought her legs down from your shoulders, in one swift motion, she locked them behind your hips. 

“M-Mio! What are you…!” But looking at her face of melting pleasure, at her eyes of need, asking you kindly to show her just how much you loved her, just how much you wanted her to be yours, Mio gave you a sweet smile, one of invitation, she let go of your back, her legs falling to the side. She gave you a choice, and after her display, you knew your answer. Her nails on your back and the creamy sounds of her hole became too much to bear for you. You pulled out except for the tip and began thrusting as deep as you could multiple times.

“Yes, YES!” Mio yelled in your ear as you approached your climax. “Oh fuck Anon don’t stop!”.

And in one final thrust, you came inside Mio as deep as you could. As your love juice spurted inside of her, Mio bit your shoulder with great force, twitching under your body almost like she was electrocuted, her teeth pierced your skin, but the pain only revitalized you, as you kept moving inside of Mio while you came. After a few seconds, Mio fell completely exhausted, and you threw yourself to the side, with blurry vision, you saw her regaining her breath as your cum spurted out of her lovehole. Hugging her in your arms, you brought the sheets over you two, and let each get some needed rest.

~*~

Mio looked from the outside of your bathroom as you applied rubbing alcohol on your back. She got a little too excited and left many scars it. You kept finding them just by the burning sensation of the alcohol, they went all the way from your shoulders down to your lower back. Turning your back to the mirror, you looked as if you had been whipped with BDSM equipment.

Mio covered her face in shame, muttering “I’m sorry” repeatedly.  She came up to you and buried her face in your chest, still apologizing. You put your hand over her shoulder and gave her a heartfelt kiss.

“Don’t worry, I don’t… dislike them.” You flexed your back in the mirror, proudly looking at your love scars as Mio’s arms wove around your hips, her teeth too, were marked in your shoulder.

“I’m gonna clean the sheets, Anon.” 

“Alright, but I’m taking a shower first, want to watch a movie later?”

“Sure!” Replied Mio as she kissed you.

~*~

Once she came back home, she found her husband eating leftovers by himself. 

“I’m home.” Said Mio. Her husband didn’t look at her.

Mio headed for her room, as her husband stopped her with his voice.

“Where were you, Ookami?”

“I hate it when he says my name.” Mio thought to herself. “Work.” She replied dryly.

“Bullshit, your ID is here.” 

“I know, I forgot but they still let me in.” 

“Is that so?” He said as he got up and approached Mio, looking her dead in the eye.

“Yes.” Mio didn’t flinch.

“I don’t believe you.” He continued.

“Believe what you want.” Said Mio in a firm tone, her husband chose not to press the matter further and entered the bedroom.

Once in bed, Mio felt him grope his boobs.

“No."

“Why?”

“I don’t want to.”

Mio’s attitude was beginning to get under her husband’s skin, but in the end he bent the knee.

“Fine.” And so, he got up and dressed up. He left, not telling Mio where.

~*~

Fubuki and Mio were making some small talk after practice, Mio seemed unusually cheery and lightheaded.

“You’re glowing, Mio-san…” Fubuki said, sneaking a smug smile at her.

“You think so?” Replied Mio with a smile.

“Could it be that you…” Fubuki didn’t finish her sentences, teasing Mio with them, who turned away to hide her embarrassment.

“That I what?” She said, not looking at her friend.

“That you!” Fubuki kept going.

“Another group of idols entered the studio as Mio and Fubuki left. You were with them, following some members from generations 1 and 2 to see their performance.

Mio and you exchanged a quick stare, in her eyes she said I love you, in your smile you told her me too. Fubuki noticed and kept teasing her friend.

“Ohhh!~ So that’s why you’re in such a good mood today!”

“Stop it!” Mio giggled.

But in truth, she was feeling great, things were finally looking up to her, she felt things in her body and heart that she almost forgot what they were like. Even if your romance was your little secret, it was like a little match keeping you both warm during winter. A little light of hope, and soon enough, she would pull herself out of the hole she was put in. Finally, Mio believed in love again.

That afternoon, she went to a law firm and got herself a lawyer to begin talking about the divorce. In a few days everything would be set.

~*~

Mio’s husband was downtown, enjoying the pleasures the city had to offer to people who had the dollar to pay for them. A blonde girl dressed in a skimpy outfit was having a drink with him, letting her hands all over his body.

“Haha! Oh, you’re so funny, hun.” Said the girl in her service voice. Mio’s husband was drunk enough to buy her act.

“Hey~” The girl said. “I’m a little short on money again, is there anything I could do?”

“Sure thing honey, com’ere, I’ll show you.”

Mio’s husband paid for the drink and left with his mistress for a love hotel, groping her ass in the street.

She took off his shirt and pulled down his pants, stripping him down to his underwear. She wanted to get this over with quickly. 

“Hold on baby, hold on, I need to go take a leak first.”

“Aww, don’t you wanna do it in my mouth?” She asked him with puppy eyes as he got up and headed for the toilet smirking to himself.

“Hurry daddy, I want you here~!” She beckoned him from the room.

Mio’s husband was fairly intoxicated, and almost fell in the bathroom, making a loud thump as he grabbed onto a towel holder which ended up bent.

“Ah, it’s whatever.” He said.

“Are you okay there, daddy?” The girl asked with worry.

“Yes hun, I’m coming out in a second.”

“Okay~!”

Finally attending nature’s call, Mio’s husband opened the bathroom door and entered the bedroom.

“Okay hun! Here’s your daddy!”

But he found himself alone in the hotel. The prostitute that he brought was nowhere to be seen, his pants and his shirt too, had vanished into thin air. He looked around for the girl, then gave up and desperately looked for his clothes. Nothing, and with that, his wallet, his house and car keys, and everything else.

He sat on the bed by himself for a second and took a deep breath.

“FUCK!” He yelled at the top of his lungs. He kept yelling obscenities at loud as he could, until one of the adyacent users tapped on the wall. 

“Hey! Quiet the fuck down!”

And so he shut his mouth, but the anger bubbling inside of him kept festering.
