However, I was still eager to play some Sonic CD, so I loaded up the 2011 version, opening it and... I stared at the title screen with a 1000-yard stare...Sonic was miscolored here, there were no menu options except "Play", the looping Wacky Workbench...it was all here...but...how? Two different versions of the game, one shouldn't affect the other, this is...inexplicable....  I decided being out of options I downloaded a copy of the original Sega CD game on the internet to just emulate it, and opened it through Gens and...Are you SHITTING ME????? IT'S HERE TOO?????? FUUUCKKKK... I was starting to feel afraid, and running out of ideas and simply, way, WAY too eager to play Sonic CD without owning a real copy of it, I backed up everything, wiped my hard disk, and re-installed Windows anew. And it didn't do jack-shit! At this point it had permeated so deep into my computer that every copy of Sonic CD I had was just entirely fucked on that PC, permanently...

I tried my best to stay calm despite the fact I was on the verge of breaking down, and instead decided to just play a different Sonic game, so I loaded up Sonic Mania, opening my save file, and...

No. No... No no no no no no no no no. Fuck...why...how? How the fuck is this...why is this.. how is this happening to me? I screamed out, before catching myself because my family members were asleep, like I was going to be stuck playing this shitty level for as long as I lived, but then I remembered that I own one other platform, a phone with all the classic Sonic ports that were released on it, and....HAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAAHHAHAAHAA FUUUCK it's fucked here too, all of them are...that shouldn't even be possible, it's like all the 2D games are FUCKED.... just GONE.... so I decided to play Sonic Forces, because man it fucking SUCKS but at least it wouldn't be affected and...

No. Every level just says Wacky Workbench, and playing one of the Modern levels, I can confirm it. 3D versions of Wacky Workbench that shouldn't be possible, each of them unique, each of them looping infinitely. Every game...EVERY GAME....Even the ones that weren't Sonic that I had on Steam, VVVVVV, Half-Life, fucking Yume Nikki, they all just had a looping version of Wacky Workbench to play. EVEN FUCKING FNAF, EVEN FUCKING FNAF!!! THE OFFICE AND THE CAMERAS ALL JUST DISPLAYED WACKY WORKBENCH, ALL THE ANIMATRONICS WERE JUST HIM. WORKBENCH. FUCKED UP SONIC. HIM. 

I can't deal with this, so I sent my friend an enraged message, and when he responded in mocking disbelief, I told him to eat shit and blocked his number. I decided to just force myself to go to sleep, desperately hoping I'd feel better in the morning.

Are my dreams... are they even worth describing? I was just running through the zone over and over, dying, and starting over. Only to repeat the cycle again. I couldn't even escape it in my dreams, I woke up over and over, and I could still see it in the corner of my eyes... I turned on my computer again, having unplugged it through the night, and it didn't even bother opening a system, it just displayed Wacky Workbench, so I unplugged the computer but it just kept going so I just worriedly walked away from it. I decided to just try to clear my head and go for a walk, but when I looked out the front door... Wacky Workbench. It was just then I remembered the schizophrenic ramblings I read online...they were true. He was living through what I am living through now. I can't...I can't fucking do this... I closed the door and ran into the living room, remembering that there was a loaded handgun there. Without any hesitation, I press it to my head, and pull the trigger.
Nothing. It just clicks. Nothing came out. Should I feel happy about that? Lucky I'm still here? I wasn't even sure anymore as I pulled out the magazine and it was only full of pictures of Workbench in his zone. None of it makes sense and I don't know what I'm supposed to do...

The walls began to fade, the floor along with it, the room vanishing, becoming Wacky Workbench.

As in my ears, I started to hear the music of Wacky Workbench's present fade in, becoming all I could hear, I fell to the ground, sobbing.

Even if I kill myself now, what comes after is probably at this point just like this, and that's if I don't just get brought back from the dead...

"it's never been more over than it is now.."
