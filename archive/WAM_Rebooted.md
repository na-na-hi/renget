W.A.M - Rebooted



The year was 1984, and Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka were working on the first Super Mario Bros. game.
Tezuka had issues drawing a sprite for the game. He was hoping to find some volunteer artists to help with his job. Luckily, he found someone, or to be more accurate, someone found him. He got a random email from an anonymous artist wanting to create a sprite. The email said the following, in translated English:

"Dear Takashi Tezuka,
Hi! I have heard that you wanted some help with art, I can help! Just tell me what I have to draw, and I will reply as soon as possible!"


Tezuka was pleased and quickly replied to the artist explaining what he had to draw and got to work. After just a few minutes, Tezuka got a reply back. The email said nothing, but there were 2 links that each led to an image. He clicked on both of them, however, what he saw was unexpected.

The artist didn't draw what Tezuka asked them to do. They instead drew a completely new character, that had a slight resemblance to the main character Mario, but with some drastic changes. The sprite for the game was hard to know what it was, but the concept art in the other image made it clearer.
It was a short looking character with a pale color scheme of brown, white, and blue. The hat, mustache and overalls were the same shade of brown, the shirt was blue, and the face, gloves and buttons were white. The character had no visible face or hair, but it had a giant mustache that covered its lower head. Its hat didn't have any letter on it, but a white triangle.

The file names of both images were english text that said, "Weird Ass Mario". Tezuka did not understand English, so he did not know what the name meant. While looking, Shigeru Miyamoto noticed Tezuka's screen and asked what it was. Tezuka explained to Miyamoto, and he told him to ignore it and simply continue development.

Years later, from sometime between 1986-1987, Super Mario World was early in developnent. Takashi Tezuka was working on the computer developing the game when he suddenly got an email. When he checked, he realised that it was from the same person who sent him the images of "WAM" a couple of years ago. The email said the following, in translated English:


"Dear Takashi Tezuka,
Hi! I am aware you did not ask me to help you with your new game, but I did anyway! I hope you like it.

By the way. I noticed that the art I had given you before was not added into the game, why?"


When Tezuka took a look at the image, it was the same odd-looking character, but this time in the style of Super Mario World. Tezuka was confused, as SMW was not announced yet, so nobody could have been aware of its existence at that time. All that Tezuka could do was to ignore the emails altogether and finish development without further interruption. On November 21st, 1990, Super Mario World was released in Japan.


However, despite WAM never being coded into the game, it somehow managed to import itself into the game's code. A day after Super Mario World was released, a total of six people have reported a strange "glitch" in not just SMW, but also the original Super Mario Bros. game. They explain that at random level, they come across an out of place sprite of the entity. Due to it only having one singular sprite, all it would do was stare at the player. If they try moving past WAM, or attempt to jump on him, the system will mysteriously shut down on its own. Upon switching on the system again, they are greeted with what appears to be WAM again, but in higher quality, along with a rapidly colour changing screen. Four of them have reported getting migraines and mild nausea from the sudden flashing lights and loud white noise coming from the TV.

One of them, however, wasn't so lucky. An 11-year-old boy by the name of Hayashida Ikari, died due to epileptic seizures from the rapidly flashing lights when he encountered the "glitch" while playing Super Mario World. His parents reported that his body was uncontrollably shaking while he was laying on the ground, along with his mouth foaming. He was quickly taken to the Okazaki City Hospital; but it was too late, and he passed during the drive.
