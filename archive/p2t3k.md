>you’re sitting at the end of the dock at the lake at night near your house
>you can hear the ambience of crickets, waves hitting the lake shore and loon calls
>there was need to bring a flashlight as the moon was full this night
>your enjoying time on the lake and looking at the night sky when a bell sound disturbs your peace
>it's from your phone
>you check what it is and see that an unknown number has sent you an image
>it’s a picture of you on the end of the dock at this moment right now
>this caught you so off-guard that you lose your grip on your phone and accidentally drop it into the lake
>for a moment during the splash it sounded like your phone made a distorted screeching sound
>regaining the focus of your attention you look behind you to see if anyone is there
>for a while now you’ve been receiving phone calls from unknown numbers with no one answering, and cryptic text messages
>slowly the messages became more threatening and you began receiving pictures of places you’ve were familiar with
>you had a stalker and now they finally found you
>you scan the treeline along the lake but you can’t see or hear anyone
>your certain that just because you can’t see them doesn’t mean they can’t see you
>you get up and make a run for it to your house
>as you’re inside you notice that the lights aren’t working but your alarm panel still is
>you were in the dark long enough for your eyes to adjust so your able to not bump into things, mostly
>after making sure that every window and door was locked you set up the alarm
>”ERROR!” it said
>”All Entrances Must Be Closed!” the panel read
>your bedroom window, that’s the one you always forget
>you run up the stairs and make a dash to your room
>nearly bashing the door open you see your wide open window and rush towards it
>but as you’re about to shut it you notice a trail of something wet coming from the window
>your stalker is already in your house
>following the trail of wet spots on the floor with your eyes
>the trail leads your eyes back to your bedroom door
>there you see the intruder standing outside your door frame

>a deer in headlights would be an understatement for the amount of shock you feel right now
>a bi-pedal creature was slowly moving into your room
>first you notice a claw reaching out and resting on the wall of your room
>then it finally invites itself inside your room
>with the moonlight beaming into your room you’re more able to make out it appearance
>the only thing that comes somewhat close to its appearance was a wendigo, werewolf hybrid
>it’s claws were sharp
>it’s face had been skinned, showing only a skull for a face
>the skull itself looked canine
>black fur covered most of its body with some parts only consisting skin or furless regions
>it’s skin was also dark in color
>water was dripping all over its body almost as if it had taken a shower without drying
>did it come from the lake? you thought to yourself
>and finally… breasts?
>it was a she
>but thoughts of “her” had not mattered long as she had let out a growl followed by a shriek
>both of which sounded like a corrupted audio recording
>suddenly she lunges towards you
>by instinct you dive onto your bed, she misses you by a foot
>as she turns towards you, ready to pounce again
>frantically trying to find a means to defend yourself you throw pillows at her
>she slashes at them like they’re butter
>she jumps on you, pinning you in place
>she leans in forward, her panting emitting from her clenched jaw of pointy canine teeth
>she opens her jaw and lets out that distorted screech again
>sitting on top of your waist, she arches her back, with a claw raised behind her head, like a pitcher winding up a fastball
>making eye contact with her, it’s clear her intent is to kill
>it’s over you thought yourself
>you're going to have a horrific death
>this moment so close to death felt like hours
>in this time you can’t help but notice her wet body glistening underneath the moonlight
>how strangely erotic her body is despite being so exotic
>specifically her breasts, they were not too small and also perky
>her areolas were darker and noticeable compared to her skin
>her nipples stiff and pointed, no doubt after being exposed to the chill night after coming from whatever water source she came from
>death being inevitable you thought you might as well indulge on your desires
>without control you instinctively reach towards her tits with both your hands
>both were almost cold to the touch
>as soon as your hands made contact with her, she froze
>then you started fondling them in circular motion
>she broke from her frozen state then growled, aggressively knocking your arms away from her boobs before you could warm them up
>still growling she quickly raises her claw again ready to end your short debauchery
>you try your foreplay again this time using your thumbs and index fingers to tightly pinch her nipples
>whatever reaction you were trying to get with this time, might have worked
>suddenly her arms slowly drop to their side like strings
>her snout of her skull face pointed to the ceiling emitting with what you can guess is a moan
>it looks like you pressed her off switch and you’re glad that you found it in time
>suddenly she starts grinding her hips on top of your groin
>then her claws come back to life, holding the back of your hands, keeping them in place on top of her breasts
>finally her head recoils forward, her face is now fixated to yours
>the gaze of her eyes meets with yours and her grinding motion stops
>staring into her eyes, you now notice the intent to kill is gone, now replaced with what you could guess was a lustful expression
>you gulp for what’s to come next

>you don’t know what happened next but now you are naked, having sex with your monster stalker in the missionary position
>with you being on top of her for a change
>inserting your manhood into her cunt at a rapid motion
>not slowing down but not speeding up
>you lean back still not stopping and see her tits bounce up and down each time you slam into her
>a long, dark colored tongue has laid out of her jaw
>her body, once cold to the touch has now greatly warmed up
>she was moaning, still with that digital tone, almost like she was on the other end of a phonecall
>whatever she was you don’t think she did this before with anyone
>she was enjoying it maybe a bit too much
>as you reached your melting point you began to speed up
>she began to moan louder and you panting harder
>”I’m getting close.” you tell her with half breathes
>suddenly she holds you tight, her claws sink into your back
>you wince from the slight discomfort
>with both of her arms and legs now criss-crossed around your body, she has locked you in, holding you tightly
>afterwards and to your surprise, she gives you a verbal response

>you fuck her harder as you cum inside her
>each time your cock enters her, you release a load deep inside her
>you keep doing this until you eventually slow down and unfortunately stop
>you leave your cock inside her, not letting your cum slip out of her
>the only sound that could be heard are both of you taking exhausted breaths
>both of you slowly regain your breath but you are completely spent
>you lie on top of her as you slowly drift to sleep
>you feel her hand lightly stroking the back of your head as you close your eyes

>you hear birds chirping from outside
>as well as a familiar, piano melody
>your eyes slowly open
>the bedroom is lit up by the morning sun
>you rise up from your bed and look to your side
>your phone is on the nightstand playing your alarm
>as you reach over and turn it off you remember the events of last night
>your heart rate spikes as you quickly scan the room for the creature
>seeing your window still open, you jump out of bed and shut it
>you check the woods outside for anything out of the ordinary
>spotting nothing, you slowly walk away from the window and start compiling the events from last night
>it’s all hazy but you remember that some monster thing had entered through your window
>it was wet and left a puddle trail, but you don’t see stains on the floor or by the window
>you check outside your room into the hallway
>still nothing
>you remember that it entered your room, had you cornered, and it tried to attack you
>you jumped onto the bed and threw your pillows at it and ripped them apart
>but your pillows are still on the bed, and still in one piece
>there was no evidence that there was something in the room with you
>you then remember you dropped your phone at the lake
>grabbing your phone you inspect it thoroughly
>it’s working fine, no water damage from what you can tell
>you remembered someone sent you something last night but can’t find anything
>was it a nightmare?
>you can’t recall anything after you thrown your pillows at the creature
>you’re convinced it was just one hell of a nightmare
>still blurry with the details, what you recall is that the monster was some kind of werewolf?
>it was a full moon last night you remembered
>maybe your brain used that inspiration to scare you
>you were still in one piece and still wearing your pajamas afterall
>still slightly unease, you finally accept that is was all just a dream

>3 months later
>you are on your computer at home finishing some reports from work
>since that nightmare you haven’t had any problems
>in fact things have gotten better for you
>it’s also been a while since your alleged stalker had bothered you in some way
>until you received another cryptic message
>your personal phone lights up with a notification
>”1 New Message From: MalO”
>”MalO?” you thought to yourself
>you don’t recall anyone from your contacts named that
>you check the message and read it
>”I need to ask you something.”
>”Who is this?” you reply
>”I need to know something from you.”
>”What?”
>MalO sends you a photo
>from what you can tell it’s a close up picture of a dark skinned stomach with a protuberance
>and a sharp-clawed hand underneath, holding it up
>you stare at the hand in shock as you pieced it together
>there was no mistaking it, what you thought was a nightmare was instead a reality
>that hand belonged to the monster that was in your house that night
>your heart is racing before as you remember that night
>this “MalO” is the name of your stalker and home invader
>but at the same time, the word phrase “MalO” was starting to come back you
>ever so vaguely, you recall downloading an application for your phone roughly a year ago with a similar if not exact title
>but uninstalled it shortly after
>before replying to the image you tab out of your messages app and bring up the app store on your phone
>you try searching “MalO” but got no results
>before trying again with a different spelling of the word you receive another message
>it’s displayed on the top of your phone screen and reads
>”Yes, I am that MalO.”
>can she see your screen you wondered?
>you look behind you but no one is there, turning back to your phone
>”Wait, so it was actually you who’s been stalking me this whole time?!” you reply with sweat down your face
>”Will you take responsibility?” MalO replies
>”What are you talking about? I’m asking if you were the one harassing me! Answer me!”
>”Will you take responsibility?” MalO replies again
>”Take responsibility for what? I don’t know what you’re talking about?!” you reply, heart beating faster
>”The video folder on your phone titled ’MalO ver1.0.0’” she replies
>you check the videos list on your phone, sure enough there’s one titled just as she said it was
>you click on the folder and press play on a video there
>”What the fuck….?” you say to yourself
>it’s a video of you and the creature from that night having sex with each other
>from the audio of the video you hear yourself, ”I’m getting close.”
>you then see her locking her arms and legs around your body and reply with what you could guess was “Cum in me!”
>feeling like you had broken out of some sort of brainwash, you remember everything from that night
>from sitting on the dock by the lake, to the moment of you orgasming in her womb
>you set your phone down on the desk in front of you
>you’re still in your chair, still taking it all in, taking deep breaths is all you can do to cope with this realization
>you were being haunted by some cursed digital program, “she” manifested… and you impregnated her
>you’re phone lights up with another message
>MalO sent you another photo
>it’s a full photo of her at a side angle, looking down at the small mound on her abdomen
>despite her only having a skullface, it looked like she’s holding a smile somehow
>she has a hand underneath her stomach like the previous photo, and the other covering her breasts
>you’re certain that she’s apart of the phone somehow, she must have took the photo herself without the need for someone else to take the photo for her
>not to mention the sex tape that was recorded with your own phone you swore was lost to the lake
>she replies again “Will you take responsibility?”
>you put the phone down, still coming to terms with your actions 3 months ago
>you receive another notification, “Will you take responsibility?”
>you’re still lost for words as you scramble to talk to yourself out loud ”I….””
>you receive another notification, “Will you take responsibility?”
>“I-”
>you receive another notification, but the sound it made was louder
>staring down at the phone you saw that it was all caps this time
>“WILL YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!?”
>“Stop-”
>your phone goes crazy as well as your computer
>your phone is receiving multiple messages a second
>you see the same message being spammed over the the lock screen on your phone
>your computer goes haywire, you can hear the fans inside your tower drastically speeding up
>just like the phone, your computer screen is opening multiple windows like bad adware
>all of which are repeating the same message that were on the phone
>all the noise is unbearable
>with a snap you yell “ENOUGH!”
>the lights in your room go off as well as electronics, almost like a black out had hit your place
>your sitting in a dark room, the only thing you hear is you panting and the low pitch sound of your computer shutting off
>a moment passes when the screen on your phone comes to life, bringing you your only source for light in a dead silent house
>it was another message from MalO
>”Will you take responsibility?”
>you grab your phone and see 1471 unread messages
>you stare at her most recent message preparing give her your response
>despite her being an anomaly, she was in-fact baring your child, even if you could not comprehend the scientific explanation behind that
>you think back to the most recent photo she sent you
>you can’t help but think it was a beautiful photo and how happy she looked
>she’s wasn’t some monster, she was a person
>a soon to be mother anticipating your next response just as much as you are
>even going to back to that night, sure it was scary
>but looking back you can’t help but laugh at how exciting it was
>especially with how euphoric the night ended, it was so intoxicating that you couldn’t even remember it the morning after
>even in the moment then, you wished it would never end, you wished the two of you would be entwined for eternity
>and you’re willing to  bet that she was thinking the same thing
>you wished the two of you would be entwined for eternity despite being different
>but now, do you regret doing what you did that night?
>no
>holding the phone up, the light illuminating your face
>you send MalO your final answer
>”Yes.”
>moments pass without a response from her, you’re holding your breath, hearing the thumping of your heart
>you think that she’s waiting for confirmation, you finally reply again, to give her just that
>”Yes, I will take responsibility.”
>”Good.” MalO texts back
>you look up as the sudden blare of lights fill the room again, your computer powers on as well
>you’re relieved and proud with your answer and feel hopeful about the future
>you look back at her response on your phone
>after a moment passes you text her “I love you.”
>you take a deep breath waiting for her response
>without warning, your chair turns you around
>a nude and familiar, dark entity has pinned you to your seat by the shoulders
>you’re now looking up where MalO is staring down, meeting her wide open eyes with yours
>she’s panting with a nearly closed jaw, her fangs still as sharp as ever
>still caught off guard by this sudden jumpscare, you can’t bring yourself say or do anything other than to stare
>you dart your eyes towards her stomach, you definitely see the bulge due to her pregnancy
>then you stare up to her bare breasts, now slightly bigger, as well as lactating a small bit
>she slowly leans forward to meet you at eye level, still panting, her claws still on your shoulders
>you keep eye contact with her as she’s doing this, only to break off to look at her gorgeous, motherly tits hang in the air shortly after
>she takes a hand off your shoulder and holds your chin slightly upwards
>she doesn’t want you to stare at those just yet unfortunately
>her mouth closes shut, you feel her snout now drawing breath
>”....”
>”....”
>you’re tempted to break this moment of silence by using your signature move like last time
>but you know now’s not the time
>”....”
>”....”
>should I say something? you thought to yourself, is she planning on killing me?
>”....”
>”....”
>does she want verbal confirmation?
>”I-”
>before you could speak, she quickly stops you by placing her clawed finger over your mouth
>you’re now back to your staring contest, minutes have passed at this point
>she wants you to do something, but what?
>you’ve been staring at her for a while now… that’s when you remembered
>that night, when she looked back at you during your breast play, you got nervous when she looked back you
>then she leaned in close up to your face staring into your eyes until you felt comfortable with her presence for you to continue
>that’s what she’s doing now, you need to get familiar with her again
>you close your eyes and take a deep breath
>you open your eyes again and show her that you are comfortable with her by being calm and giving a smile
>you lay your hand on top of hers and take them off you, but still holding onto them
>you stand up from your chair and she allows it
>the two of you now standing, you let go of her hands for you lean in closer to place your head next to hers
>the both of you embrace each other with a hug, you swear you’ll find a way to make kissing work
>after a soothing minute, still not letting go of each other, the two of you lean back to stare at each other again
>”I love you.”

Epilogue

>2 months later
>you are sitting next to your now finance, MalO, on the pier by the lake
>just like that night, there is a full moon, crickets chirping, and loon calls
>”That reminds me, why were you trying to attack me a couple months back?” you ask her
