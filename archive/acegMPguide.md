1. Parts and builds
Before you start playing multiplayer in earnest, set your control scheme to expert and unlock the following parts (listed in order of importance). It's genuinely more important than getting more planes.
>High-Speed Datalink Antenna (MSL Homing ++)
>Thrust-Adjusting Steering Device 2 (MSL) (MSL Homing+)
>Thrust-Adjusting Steering Device 2 (Sp.W) (Sp.W Homing+)
>New Flap Actuators 3 (Pitch++)
>Superior Maneuverability 2 (All manoeuvrability+)
>Light Blisk 2 (Accel.+ especially under 700 kph)
>Variable Cycle Engine 2 (Accel.+ especially above 1100 kph and Top Speed+)
>Directional Proximity Fuze 2 (MSL Damage+)
>Directional Proximity Fuze 2 (Sp.W Damage+)
>Cutting-Edge Airbrakes 2 and Cutting-Edge Large Flap 2 (more on that later)
These will make your life much, much easier. You WILL be able to tell the difference between a stock and a fully upgraded plane.
Almost every build in the game will benefit from having Flaps 3, SupMan 2, Blisk and Variable Cycle Engine (level depending on whether your flying style makes you end up to low-ish (700 kph) speeds or you stay at medium speeds). These will be your bread and butter, coupled with damage and homing parts for your build's missiles. If you're using standard missiles, Datalink Antenna will also be vital to increase MSL homing to an even greater degree. It unfortunately adds looping capabilities too, but unlike QAAMs, they are not manoeuvrable or persistent enough to be a massive threat while they loop.
If your plane has access to HCAAs or HPAAs, only upgrade them and don't bother with the standards.
When it comes to manoeuvrability, pitch rate is the single most important stat. Maximise that. After that, acceleration will allow you to actually get back in your plane's ideal range of speed in a heated turnfight, so that will be your second priority. Top speed is the last truly important stat, and it's only situationally used (e.g. when chasing down a LAAM/HVAA user). Roll rate might come in handy, but SupMan already improves it to a degree where it's not really important to upgrade it specifically, and yaw is essentially irrelevant.
Weapon parts are equally important, and Homing and Damage parts are essentially mandatory if you want to play. After putting those on, it's down to personal choice on the other buffs to apply:
>faster missiles (BUT slightly less manoeuvrable) with Propellant
>more missiles to throw at the enemy with Takeoff Weight Augmentation 2
>an extreme edge in head-on engagements with lock-on speed parts
The ace in the hole of several dogfighting builds is Airbrakes 2 and Cutting-Edge Large Flap 2, two severely underrated parts. The fact that they make you decelerate faster means you'll also get a much, MUCH tighter turn radius, giving you a noticeable advantage that you can use even against technically superior aircraft. With a tighter turning radius, you will get better angles for your missiles and you'll give the enemy a much, much harder time matching you if you pair it with engine parts and fly aggressively. You'll also overshoot the enemy less often. Do keep in mind that you'll bleed energy at a much, much faster pace, especially if you've got both equipped, so you'll need to watch your speed more carefully or you might end up a sitting duck after bleeding too much energy.
Cutting-Edge Large Flap 2 is also one of the reasons why it's important to look in the datasheet ***(https://pastebin.com/6Uh45geR)***: the part increases deceleration, but the game doesn't tell you this and only mentions the improved pitch stability.
After that's done, we can get to the fun part.

2. Flying technique essentials
>look up your plane's ideal cornering speed in the datasheet ***(https://pastebin.com/6Uh45geR)*** and try to stay in that range, and don't slow down excessively
Every aircraft's got a range of speed where it will turn best, and knowing that will allow you to get the most out of your plane's performance. Even a mediocre aircraft will be a menace if flown right. Do keep in mind that flying too slow will make you an easier target for incoming missiles. as will PSMing.
>if you're not building up speed to get back to your ideal cornering speed, use high-G turns; and for the love of god, do not fly straight!
Be responsive. Be aware. Try to understand the enemy's flying style, and when you think you understand how he flies, exploit the weaknesses you've found to get your kill. Trust your plane and fly it to the limit. Don't give the enemy a second to breathe, press in to catch them unprepared. Train your reflexes.
>NEVER pitch down UNLESS it's to evade a missile in a head-on or for a very minute adjustment, and don't roll to reverse course if someone's behind you; don't try to evade missiles with blind barrel rolls!
In a close turnfight, pitching down will only waste your time, and if the enemy is close on your approximate six, then trying to reverse will only help his missiles hit you more easily. If youâ€™re in a head-on attack and the enemy got the shot off before you, however, pitching down is useful to evade. If you decide to turn to avoid a missile, keep turning in that direction! When they're in a turn and get hit by gunfire/hear an incoming missile, a lot of nuggets stop their current turn and try to reverse course, or even constantly barrel roll futilely without regard for the incoming missile's trajectory. This actually gives the missile an easier time following them, and they die because of it.
>if you hear a missile alert, drop whatever you're doing to assess where it's coming from
Situational awareness is the key to victory. Always keep your attention and reflexes up, and remember that it's okay to give up a possible shot if it means evading incoming missiles. A glance at the red indicators, then a glance at the map, and you'll be able to take action if necessary. Never panic, because:
>missiles will almost never hit from the side unless you're going under 600 kph, so if lots are coming from multiple directions, show them your sides
Even Macross-tier avalanches of missiles can be evaded if you angle yourself right. As always, assess the direction they're coming from, and turn so that they don't see your rear. It is trickier with incoming LAAMs and HVAAs, which will require you to go faster to evade them even if you're showing them your sides, but it will help you survive even if an entire room wants you dead.
>a good rule of thumb to make your missiles hit is to fire when you can see up the target's engines if you're behind, and refer to these webms for head-on attacks: fire so that the enemy will turn into your missile's trajectory.
When you're in a trailing position, you'll need to be as close as possible in order to leave your enemy no escape. Refer to this picture: https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1656110964214.png , the angle is right, but ideally you'd be even closer to ensure the enemy will have no escape.
https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1637052321107.webm
Notice how this buddy has forced the target to go slow, and fires when the enemy has no way of evading the attack. His target does get a shot off, but he evades by pitching down; instead the target keeps turning into the missiles and actually makes their job easier, guaranteeing a hit.
https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1657584721339.webm
This other buddy is fighting a target that is going faster. Take a good look at the footage and memorise the firing angles: they're meant to minimise risk to yourself while exploiting the enemy's flight path to ensure a hit.
https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1662885630004.webm
Here you can see how these angles can also be applied to special weapons: HPAAs and HCAAs are extremely deadly in head-on attacks.
>speaking of missile trajectories, fire them when the enemy is at the edge of your screen or beyond (most missiles have a lock-on cone bigger than your screen): this way, the missile's curve will be more natural and it will track better
While it may seem counterintuitive at first, firing when the enemy is at the edge of your screen means that the missile will immediately start curving towards the enemy. Meanwhile, if you fire while directly behind, it will fly straight at first; the enemy will only need to turn a bit and the missile will be unable to pursue.
A missile fired with this technique will track really viciously, to the point where it would seem like looping at first glance.
>try to anticipate the enemy's moves!
Being able to predict your opponent is the key to victory, so you need to be proactive and imagine what he will do next. Fly accordingly: be the first to turn on the merge (this is essentially a lead turn, the most basic of BFM can be applied here) to get a few precious moments of advantage; guess where he'll turn next and plan your own move accordingly to get an advantageous angle.
>don't bother with QAAM/EML/SASM, they only teach you bad manoeuvres that either leave you extremely exposed to attack or at a terrible angle to fire on the enemy
Obviously enough, EML is a lolcannon with a stupid hitbox and huge damage (meaning its users don't even need to fly the plane, just point their nose and shoot like a point-and-click adventure). QAAM doesn't need to see the enemy to be fired and will turn like a maniac to pursue (meaning they can just spam their missiles with no thought to angles and hope they hit). SASM's AOE means that it doesn't need to hit in order to damage the enemy, and even if the damage isn't much, it's still free points. This means that their users
 learn to fly like NPCs and will make them sitting ducks in an actual fight, extremely easy targets for anyone with at least two neurons to rub together.
>before pulling a PSM, check who's targeting you and don't initiate the manoeuvre if someone could shoot at you 
PSMs (post-stall manoeuvres like the Kulbit and Cobra) are an extremely powerful tool, but you are vulnerable while you're pulling them. Never initiate one if someone's behind you, as you'll give them a sure shot to kill you; remember to also check for other players looking at you, because nothing kills a PSMing plane like an HVAA or LAAM. As always, be aware of your surroundings and do not expose yourself needlessly.
>use gravity to your advantage!
Gravity does affect your aircraft and factors in your acceleration/deceleration. You can pull tighter turns if you decelerate while climbing, because it will slow you down more than just using your airbrakes, and you'll accelerate faster when you dive. This can be used in turnfights too: if you're dogfighting on the vertical, high-G while your nose is pointing up, accelerate when it's pointing down. This will tighten your turn radius and allow you to regenerate speed faster for more high-G turning. 

3. Target-tracking camera
Accessed by keeping the "change target" button pressed on controller, or the one referred to as "highlight target" in the keyboard control options, this feature will allow you to keep your view centred on your current target at all times. It works best in third person, as first person's view angle is constrained by the cockpit.
There are many advantages to using it, namely
>being able to track your target at all times, you will always be aware of your target's current heading, infer where it's going to turn, or see if he's trying any funny shit with PSMs
>since the lock-on cone of every missile is larger than the screen, you'll be able to lock your missiles earlier than normal and at safer angles
Do keep in mind that your general situational awareness is slightly reduced when you're using it, which is the price you pay for much better awareness on that single enemy; don't crash while trying to follow someone!

4. Countering meta builds
The unholy trinity of QAAM/EML/SASM are a pain in the ass, but even they can be beaten with some subterfuge and specific builds. They will still have the advantage, and a meta user will still give you a hard time if he's got half a thought going through his head, but goddamn if beating them doesn't feel good. The first two in particular will be your biggest problem.
>EML
The elephant in the room. Oneshot, no warning, and it's got a busted hitbox. When we say the hitbox is stupid, this is what we mean: https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1654815510647.webm . To top it all off, it is always mounted on PSM-capable planes. Your overall chances of winning a fight with an EML user depend on the gamemode, the presence of other players, and most importantly the enemy's turning ability. We will assume the worst possible case: a 1v1 against an EML-02. It's fast, it's manoeuvrable, it PSMs.
With that said, even something like this has shortcomings for you to brutally exploit.
>7 second reload time
Your biggest advantage over an EML user, and the easiest one to capitalise upon; at the same time, in order to exploit it, you either caught him shooting someone else or you were lucky he missed you. As you are free to shoot the enemy while it's reloading, force a head-on attack to get the best chances of hitting and killing him. Don't spend too much time at low speeds, or he will PSM and get on your tail with ease, or even try to gun you down like a flying turret!
>requires the enemy to put his nose on you, and thus needs predictable manoeuvres
Both a tremendous advantage and a slight disadvantage depending on the situation, the fact that it's a point-and-click adventure when the enemy can point himself at you also means that he will waste shots if you deny him the appropriate angle. Again, do not go too slow when fighting the enemy, as it will give him an easier time aligning a shot, or even worse, you'll be in his PSM window and then he'll have free reign over the laws of physics.
By the way, this should be a given, but it also means that you need to jink a bit when first approaching the enemy. If you just go towards him on the merge, without doing some basic manoeuvres to throw off his aim like a lazy barrel roll at full throttle, he'll snipe you off from 5 miles away because you're pointing directly at his nose.  
>since those manoeuvres also require some room to be pulled, fight close to the ground and use terrain to your advantage to try and deny them
A PSM that might give the enemy the perfect angle to shoot you may not be possible when you're close to the ground, or at least will require the enemy to be more careful to avoid slamming into obstacles. Exploit that mercilessly. Be daring in your flying, capitalise on the danger of crashing and you might make the enemy's usual manoeuvres unfeasible.
>***Fight like a lion.***
When it comes to playstyle, your best bet of winning such an engagement is surprising the enemy with your moves, and doing so with rabid, unrestrained aggression. Do not let the enemy breathe for a millisecond. Catch him with his pants down when you can and keep the pressure on, while being mindful of the speed at which he may pull a PSM. If you see the enemy is getting the upper hand, only then should you disengage to build some distance and try again. Ironically, a head-on attack will usually be your best bet of killing him: while it does expose you to his railgun, he is also going to be exposed to your own missiles. If you can get an advantageous angle, you'll win that joust.
At least in my experience, a build that can get the shot off in a head-on before the enemy can get the EML to bear on you will be your best bet for survival at worst and victory at best. As an example, below is a HCAA Typhoon build made to exploit that fact, which can also be applied to the Rafale and F-15J.
https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1663685464459.jpg
Many HPAA planes are able to PSM to level the playing field, and the F-15 S/MTD will also outmanoeuvre the Wyvern at all flight regimes.
>QAAM
The crutch weapon par excellence.
>enormous lock-on cone extending way past the aircraft's nose
>extreme manoeuvrability, jumping off the rail in an instant and tracking like mad
>extreme persistency, especially if they equipped Flight Time 2 (Ramjet) to give them even more flight time
>high damage, will oneshot most planes without Armor 2 (Bulletproof Fuel Tank) and leave the others at 90% damage
All of this adds up to a weapon that requires no positioning skills, no planning, and no dignity. So how do we counter this? The method for killing the launching platform depends on how aware the enemy is, while dodging the weapon itself is just a matter of keeping up your energy. Again, we will assume the worst-case scenario, in this case a QAAM-22 that knows how to PSM.
>unless you're definitely behind the QAAM player, assume he can lock and shoot a missile at you
The off-bore capabilities of QAAM are unparalleled. Coupled with its extreme persistency, it translates to a weapon that requires you to be always alert and on the lookout. Expect constant missile locks and alarms blaring in your ear.
>no matter what, keep a decent pace so that you'll have energy for high-G turns
On top of remaining in your plane's ideal cornering speed window, keeping your speed up means that you'll always have the energy to high-G when the missile's indicator is right behind you. Despite its stats, the rules for evading standard missiles still apply to QAAM, and no missile can keep up with a high-Ging plane. As long as you can keep doing it, it is enough to survive a barrage.
>keep your awareness up, those shits loop!
QAAMs are persistent, they loop when they miss and will keep tracking you for ten seconds even without the flight time part (which adds five more). Glance at the minimap and the indicators to ensure the missiles are not on your dead six, high-G when they are, and don't get overly focused on dodging! The enemy will keep launching one every 4.5 seconds (and that's ignoring any additional standards he can launch) and so your focus should always be on getting him.
>avoid head-on attacks unless you can reach a really safe angle
They've got better tracking than any other missile, a bigger lock-on cone than any other missile, and a single one will do a ton of damage or kill you outright. In order to win such a head-on, you would need to position yourself much more carefully than usual, and pass at high speed to further reduce the chances of getting hit.
>if the enemy exploits the wide lock-on angle too much, he might actually leave himself wide open to your guns!
It's true that QAAM users can shoot at you from any angle, but at the same time, remember: if he's firing from the very edge of his lock-on cone, he's leaving his sides or top in view of your guns! An extreme off-bore shot for him might translate to a perfect angle for deflection gunnery for you, so get in close and go to town with the cannon to chew him up. Even if he survives it, it will do some good damage, and it might shake him up to the point where he'll commit a graver error for you to exploit.
>SASM
Rather than murdering you without even thinking, the SASM user turns the match into a score attack mission because he can farm points without even thinking.
>the wide AOE means that it doesn't even need to hit to damage the target, essentially getting points for free
>the explosion itself deals half the damage of a standard missile, which doesn't sound like much, but it takes only two salvos to kill an F-15C without Armour 2
>if it does hit, a SASM inflicts as much damage as a QAAM from the impact plus the explosion on top of it, oneshotting every single plane without Armor 2
 installed
What this means is that the SASM player can just lob his missiles at the player in first place when he's distracted and get points for free, because unless he's going really fast he will get hit by the explosion at the very least. Assuming that the player in first place is a Su-35S with three stars (see score system section below), this means that a SASM user can reliably rack up 6,5k points per salvo and speed off before receiving any sort of retaliation.
Unless you actually get hit square in the face by the SASM, it's unlikely that its user will kill you unassisted. Rather, he will target players that are already damaged to ensure a kill and get even more free points. With all that said, it's time to think up ways to counter it.
>check your radar to see if someone is approaching the furball at high speed.
As always, awareness is the key to victory, and SASM users specifically target unaware players to ensure a hit. Deny them their free points by keeping your speed up: a slow target is more likely to be grazed by the missiles, which will allow them to detonate and inflict damage.
>if he's approaching fast and you cannot assure you'll hit him, fire when he's as close as possible and at the edge of the lock-on cone: your missiles will pursue more persistently and he'll be forced to evade (and thus lose speed) or die
Your missiles will pursue more persistently and thus force him to jink. This will cost him time, attention, and precious speed; exploit this opening to close the gap and go to town with him.
>you can attempt head-on attacks and consistently win them, but expect to take at least some damage if you do
SASMs track about as well as normal missiles, but their users tend to fire without any regard towards angles and probability of hitting, relying instead on the AoE to progressively damage you. This is doubly valid in head-on attacks, as you will pass closer to the enemy missiles and thus it's even more likely to trigger its proximity explosion. However, this can also work in your favour: given that they do not actively try to get in an advantageous angle, you can reach a favourable position in a head-on attack (as described earlier in the guide) and reliably kill them in a single pass.
If you are close enough to get a lock but he keeps circling in an attempt to evade your missiles, making no attempt to shoot back at you, you have three options:
>gun him down
Someone stuck in a turn presents a large, nice target to practice your deflection gunnery.
>try to close as much as possible and fire your missiles from a lag pursuit position (near the edge of your screen)
The same trick described multiple times in this guide works even in a close fight. Your missiles will track more persistently and give you a higher chance to hit. The closer you are to the target, the less you'll need to put him near the edge of the screen.
>try to get a different angle and try again
If you simply cannot hit the target, then use your current advantage to reposition yourself for an easier shot.

5. Gunnery
Ace Combat 7's guns are misunderstood. Their range is 1700 metres, more than what the gunsight shows you, and they're capable of handily destroying any target with a sustained burst. They are as powerful as the gunsight is unsuitable for dogfighting. Think of it as a WW2-era gyro sight: it shows the right direction to lead your shot, but you need to lead your target a lot more than what it shows you in order to hit. A far more intuitive way to aim is to take advantage of your infinite ammo and "walk your fire":
>see where the tracers are going
>apply a correction accordingly
>watch as the enemy is shredded in less than two seconds of sustained fire
If you do find the pipper to be more convenient, then a good rule of thumb in a turnfight is to use the edge of the pipper as an initial reference instead of the central dot, and lead the target even more than that. Lead the target roughly twice as much as the reticle tells you.[more coming soon]

6. Special Weapons and how to use them
Unless you're in a Sp.W off room or your plane doesn't get good Sp.Ws, you will do most of your work using Special Weapons. They differ greatly in behaviour, so you'll need to adjust your playstyle to employ them most effectively.  
>4AAM
Unfortunately, 4AAMs are not particularly manoeuvrable and they get a debuff to homing for the first second after launch, so they'll suck at close range. You can only really use them against furballs that are unaware of you, and having only four at a time won't help much with clearing them. Lob them at the furball as you close in with your standard missiles and guns. Upgrading them feels like a waste to me, considering that they don't hit often.
>6AAM and 8AAM
Much better. For some reason, PA decided to buff them to the point of making 4AAMs look like unguided rockets, while 6AAMs and 8AAMs could reasonably be used as dogfighting missiles. You can use them (especially the 6AAMs) both as dogfighting missiles and as furball-clearers. They're manoeuvrable and hit like a truck, so you'll only need a single missile to bring down an unarmoured target. Do not fire more than a single missile per target per salvo. Do not waste them by shooting them liberally, only fire them at fully-formed furballs (especially if they're going slow) or use them as dogfighting missiles.
>HCAA
Think of them as standard missiles, but better in every single way: better homing, better damage, better speed. They effectively make MSLs obsolete, so you can safely upgrade them exclusively. Otherwise, you can use them the same way you use standards, though obviously with a bit more caution since >finite ammo. You should still fire your unupgraded standard missiles to keep up the pressure on the enemy when you haven't got a clear shot.
>HPAA
Rewarding patience and the buddy who waits for a good angle, they'll oneshot any plane that doesn't use armour when unupgraded. Damage 2 will make them obliterate any plane, regardless of armour. You won't need more ammo if you wait for the right moment and angle to fire, but you will need practice to recognise it. Refer to the footage above for ideal timing and firing angles.
>HVAA
Lob them at slow, unaware targets, and watch the points roll. They're pretty manoeuvrable for a sniping weapon, but most importantly (and obviously) they're fast as fuck. Just don't use them at short range, they've got a slight debuff similar to 4AAMs. You'll give your opponent a nasty surprise on the merge, if he doesn't think fast. Stealth will make it even safer, and people will despise your existence and hunt you down; consider a build capable of both defending itself at knife range and staying undetected at longer range. Remember, you WILL become visible on everyone's radar for a second when you fire!
>LAAM
The quintessential sniping weapon, goes really well with stealth; you will pop up on radar for a second in any case the moment you fire. As with HVAAs, fire at distracted, slow targets who are already preoccupied with something else. Useless within 2km.
>PLSL
Look at the guy on top of the leaderboard and go medieval on his ass. You're a force to be reckoned in a radius of approximately 5km, but you'll need to lead the target a fair amount, and the slightest hint of clouds will stop it. If you're within a cloud, a bolt will travel 50 metres or so before dissipating into a harmless blue fart. PLSL bolts travel exactly twice as fast as your gun's shots and have a maximum range of 5km (if unupgraded), so adjust appropriately. You can use both gun and PLSL at knife range to melt a plane in an instant. Practice leading the target a lot, and walk your fire as you'd do with your guns, only more so at long range!
>SAAM
Keep the other guy in the circle. Mostly used as a sniping weapon, SAAM is surprisingly powerful in a dogfight if you're behind the enemy. A situational quirk of the weapon is that if you fire two SAAMs at different targets, and both targets are within the circle, both missiles will keep tracking perfectly fine. Don't get overly focused on your current target, or you might be easy prey to other people, who'll catch you distracted!
>TLS
Sniper central. Like PLSL, clouds are your biggest enemy. Unlike PLSL, using TLS means having a giant, attention-grabbing beacon emanating from your plane the moment you fire, so the entire room will usually drop everything they're doing to focus on you. Do not get overly focused on a single target, be prepared to evade incoming at a moment's notice, and remember that TLS rewards a steady hand.
>EML, QAAM, SASM
Don't.

7. Score system explanation
>Every player has a base score value based on the cost rating of their aircraft. The exact cost/score table can be found here: https://arch-img.b4k.co/vg/1656114430836.png
>However, the actual amount of points you get is scaled based on the ratio of your aircraft cost to that of the other players. Flying a higher cost aircraft will reduce the points you receive, and conversely flying a lower cost aircraft increases the points you receive. For instance, if you destroy a plane that has 300 cost less than you do, 95% of the original score calculated is given.

>Score difference between planes and percentage of score given:
>0: 100%
>100: 100%
>200: 100%
>300: 95%
>400: 92%
>500: 92%
>600: 86%
>700: 72%
>Any more than a 700 point difference and the score calculation given is still 72%.

>You get up to 70% of a player's score value for dealing damage, and the last 30% for actually scoring a kill.
>What fraction of the 70% you get is simply (damage dealt) / (maximum HP). This means that equipping Bulletproof Fuel Tank (which increases your max HP) effectively reduces the amount of points you give out whenever you get hit, as long as you're not dying in one hit (from, say, HPAA or EML).
>Each star next to a high scorer's name increases their point value by about 50% per star. That means that three stars turns your 10k F-15C into a 25k F-15C.

In BR:
>0~3 players: No stars are awarded
>4~5 players: 1 star for 1st
>6~7 players: 2 stars for 1st, 1 star for 2nd
>8 players: 3 stars for 1st, 2 stars for 2nd, 1 star for 3rd

In TDM:
>Stars are awarded to both teams, according to how many players there are on that team
>Last place within that team gets 0 stars, and each player above them gets an extra star as you move up in score
So even if the scoreboard in TDM is:
>Alpha 1 100k
>Bravo 2 80k
>Bravo 4 70k
>Bravo 1 30k
>Bravo 3 20k
>Alpha 3 15k
>Alpha 4 5k
>Alpha 2 2k
Then Alpha 3 will still have 2 stars, and Alpha 4 will have 1, despite all of Bravo outscoring them. However, low scoring players can still contribute by tying up enemies, evading their attacks and not giving out points, while their teammates hit those enemies while they're distracted.

8. /aceg/-approved builds

>Here's a more slightly more readable (and up-to-date in terms of what I fly nowadays) screencap.
>Blisk was chosen over VCE specifically due to the higher acceleration (despite the descriptions being the same), Cutting-Edge Airbrakes to make low-speed energy fighting easier, New Flaps and SupMan are bogstandard, Cutting Edge Large Flap had some kind of reasoning behind it, but I kinda forgot. **[---Editor's note: It's the increased deceleration, which when coupled with Airbrakes gives the plane an even tighter turn radius---]** BFTs are sort of a crutch, but you are a paper mache plane if you don't have BFTs on the 29 as well (many, and I mean many missiles will OHKO or 2HKO you) but I've mostly relied on dodging. DPF to OHKO Wyverns and tougher bastards, High-Energy Propellant and Steering Device to make up for the HPAA's many failures. Takeoff Weight Augmentation is another "crutch" in that 22 HPAAs are generally just barely enough to get you through a normal time limit lobby, if you aren't being extraordinarily shrewd. Having extra missiles would be useful for a fledgling HPAA user
 though.

>Never stalls, always ready to fire. ECU Software Update is the important part. Lower Stall speed means you can maintain high-G with a tight radius turns longer than opponents. Vulnerable at high speed since ECU also reduces deceleration in high-G turns. Ideal for aggressive close-range fights at low speeds, exactly what the Rafale excels at. Especially useful in a 1v1 or prolonged turn-rate fights and against PSM users, all low-speed situations.

>2420 Typhoon HCAA (can also be applied to Rafales and F-15Js)

>An attempt to counter meta and PSM users. It's meant to catch the enemy by surprise, or buy you time to reposition and try again. You'll only use HCAAs and your gun to kill people, but you can fire standard missiles to increase the pressure on the opponent and increase the probability of mistakes on his part.
>SupMan 2 and Flaps 3 are essential in any build. Blisk 2 increases acceleration especially at low speed. Airbrakes 2 and Cutting Edge Large Flap 2 increase deceleration, especially when high-Ging, to minimise turn radius and thus give you a bit of a positional advantage even against opponents with a better turn rate. Homing and Damage are obligatory on any missile, and make HCAAs especially vicious. Multiple-target threat level detection will ensure you'll get the first shot off in any head-on engagement.
>This build requires you to be both extremely aggressive (on the merge and subsequent turns) and aware of both your speed (to avoid stalling) and enemy positioning. Head-on attacks are your best friends against almost anything, only QAAMs are better in that role (and you're a buddy, you don't use QAAMs). Fire your missiles at the edge of the lock-on cone unless you're close enough to see up the enemy's engines (thus only if you're behind him).

>Posting my general pub build for the Su-35S before taking a nap. It's funny how I used to get scared whenever CIC-ranked players use these. Avoid firing blindly at fur balls since 6AAMs are your only viable weapon.
>Blisk for PSM stability and Lv1 Ailerons for additional responsiveness. I prefer putting High-Energy Propellant to give 6AAMs significant chasing capability against DarkStars and MiG-31s. Otherwise, I use Sp.W lock-on speed for 1v1 PSM duels. Takeoff Weight Augmentation is a decent option, too.

>here's what i'm using. my choice for Cutting-Edge Large Flap is to tighten my turn radius more. combined with airbrakes, i can actually keep up with most Rafale's in this thing -- it's insane
