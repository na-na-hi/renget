>rain trickled down through the forest canopy 
>dusk had come but you could hardly have seen the sun through the clouds
>you'd gone to the next village over for Mutter's medicine 
>unfortunately, the idea of camping in the woods seemed like the better option than trying to outrun the storm
>you knew that meant most likely traveling later in the dark
>you weren't looking forward to that
>however, your family's financial situation meant faster and smoother travel by horseback or wagon was out
>not for quite some time 
>you were born to wheat farmers and your land was not nearly as bountiful as some of the neighboring farms
>sometimes you felt like the land or even your family was cursed
>never able to climb up out of the hole 
>always in debt
>yet your family persevered 
>some stubbornness born from years of suffering
>men in your family had to push
>what choice did they have?
>this of course, meant the one horse on your farm was an ancient plow horse
>working Gunther much harder would put him at risk
>so any journey had to be on foot
>generations of toil leading to you huddled under a pine tree
>life didn't seem fair
>raindrops intensified their assault, filling the woods with new noise 
>you took in the scenery and relaxed
>why not appreciate the little things if you were trapped
>you were trapped in this life just as much as you were trapped under this tree

>you watched as any remaining sunlight vanished, swallowed by the blackness 
>the clouds prevented the stars from truly shining overhead but occasionally you'd get glimpses of the moon
>the silver would try to slice through the storm
>but the rain wasn't giving up without a fight
>leaving you stuck
>getting pneumonia while trying to treat your mother's illness wouldn't be smart
>Mutter needed you more than ever since Vater passed away
>his heart couldn't take all the stress eventually
>found him face down one day in the chicken coop
>since then you'd been responsible 
>the weight of your farm, no your entire family, hinged on you
>your siblings did what they could
>hell, they were the only reason you had felt confident enough grabbing the medicine 
>this trek was a long time to be away from the farm
>weather just made it longer
>you hoped they were alright
>you felt the weight of the tiny satchel of herbs
>they were supposed to treat her cough
>she'd been getting worse
>you could see it even if your younger siblings couldn't 
>Mutter even tried downplaying it
>she put on a brave face
>so you would too
>you'd just have to persevere like you always had
>fight uphill
>fight on and on and on
>that killed your father
>but responsibility was a cage one forges for himself
>if not you'd be no better than an animal
>what pulled you out of you melancholic musings was a noise you could make over the sound of rain
>it sounded like someone running
>this late in the evening?
>your mind went to the worst case scenario of someone accosted by highwaymen
>that was a bit outlandish and perhaps whimsical 
>you still drew the knife you had on you for self defense 
>your eyes and ears trying to pick out the movement
>sounded like a lot of running
>even with the knife you weren't ready to blindly charge into the dark sea of trees
>a romantic day dream was not a good reason to get mauled by a bear
>you couldn't place the number of footsteps but it sounded chaotic 
>finally you could hear ragged breath
>it sounded female
>more footsteps behind
>was it a woman being chased after all?
>you debated
>maybe it wasn't any of your business
>when you heard a scream you decided to take action
>you bolted towards the noise, knife drawn
>almost tripping over a tree root on the way, you intercepted the chase
>some peasant girl being chased by wild dogs
>you wish you had something more substantial than a knife but tackled and stabbed a distracted dog regardless 
>you yelled to the girl to climb the nearest tree while you bought time for her
>chivalry wasn't a strong suit of yours but you'd seen your sheep beset by these animals
>that's no way for someone to die
>after the first hound was downed the other two became cautious 
>they growled and bared their teeth
>you didn't have the element of surprise on your side but it at least sounded like the girl got to safety 
>your knife arm was pulled in
>your other stretched out in front of you
>you had no chance in a straight fight with them
>they were massive dogs
>however, you knew their instinct would have them lunge and try to pull you down
>sacrifice your arm or hand to get at one of their stomachs and necks
>this whole thing had been reckless but knowing what you know now you wouldn't have turned away
>it was a game
>you needed them to make the first move
>they needed you to do the same
>one of you had to blink and the one on the right got impatient 
>pain burned through your forearm as teeth clamped down 
>but you had your opening and violently stabbed the mutt to death as you fought through the pain
>it had a good deep grip on your arm and your white sleeve was now a mess of crimson
>pain and rage fueled your stabs and you were just as stubborn as this beast
>you used the flailing legs of the damned thing to keep its friend at bay, swinging the animal like a club best you could
>the other dog all of a sudden reconsidered it's options when it's companion let go of your arm
>a dozen stab wounds would have put anything that size down and thankfully it finally realized it was dead by number twelve
>you were in bad shape though
>not down but that was about your one viable strategy and you really didn't want to repeat that trick
>still, in your weakened state it could have gone for your throat
>it didn't, choosing discretion over another attack
>you were feeling a little shaky and the bleeding felt like it wouldn't stop
>goddamn that was stupid
>that was your last thought before you fell over and blacked out
>you had no idea what happened but you woke up in what looked like a cave
>some sort of bleak, damp hole in the ground
>your arm was bandaged
>you still felt weak
>the mildew smell was strong
>a dog bite putting you down would have been pathetic 
>you still needed to take care of…
>in a panic you sat up and fumbled around for your bag
>the medicine 
>where was the medicine?
>you looked around the cave in a panic
>you noticed two eyes in the dark opening of the cave staring into your soul
>in a panic you sat up and fumbled around for your bag
>the medicine 
>where was the medicine?
>you looked around the cave in a panic
>but
>this wasn't a cave
>you were lying on a small bed in a tiny room
>it wasn't even dark out
>soft morning light trickled in through the window in the door
>the bag was on a table near the bed along with some of your other belongings
>your arm was bandaged
>all that panic over a nightmare
>you sighed and pushed up off the bed
>the room wasn't familiar 
>still, you couldn't waste time when your family was worrying about you
>no telling how late in the day it was
>last thing you needed was Mutter thinking a bandit have slit your throat
>you felt rude leaving 
>whoever tended to you had saved you
>you had a feeling that girl was involved
>as rude as it was maybe you'd see them again
>you snatched your coin purse, knife and the herbs off the table
>ignoring the pang of hunger, you headed out the door
>a voice stopped you
>"so the gallant hero makes off without a word?"
>you turned to see a crone watching you from a chair near the door
>but you didn't see her when you walked out
>perhaps in the rush you didn't pay attention 
>but you could have sworn the area around the door was vacant a moment ago
>she had peasant garb
>not quite matching the girl from last night
>there was no way this woman could have climbed a tree either
>she looked like a stiff breeze could have knocked her over
>you apologized 
>but you had to get going
>the old woman didn't seem offended
>instead asking what the hurry was for
>you had to be honest 
>your farm was first and foremost on your mind
>she apologized for keeping you and remarked she understood 
>"family is important after all," she mused as she rubbed her chin
>on that note you excused yourself 
>you set off into the woods
>the problem was, as you realized quickly, you didn't know what part of the woods you were in
>you had lived around here for years and never heard of an old woman out in the woods
>when you got back home you'd have to ask Mutter
>she'd maybe have an answer
>your arm ached a little but thankfully it seemed like nothing serious
>that story was going to be hard to tell
>trekking deeper into the trees, you finally came up upon a dirt road
>that stretch looked familiar and you used the sun to set your direction
>your rescue last night was a distant thought aside from that reminder
>it all seemed to work out in the end
>no idea what that whole situation was
>when you finally left the forest and saw your land, your heart soared 
>your family had been worried sick
>so you coming home mostly intact was met with joy
>as was the treatment for Mutter's illness
>when you described what happened and your experience with the old woman your mother didn't seem to have an answer
>she helped clean and cover the wound again
>it would be a liability with doing work today
>thankfully, nothing strenuous today
>most of the harder chores had been done by your siblings
>something that made you really appreciate them
>there was just tending to the chickens 
>by comparison that chore was almost relaxing
>you enjoyed the solitude with the animals
>though something didn't sit right
>when you got out to the coop you felt like eyes were on you
>but there was just the field and you saw nothing out there
>the wheat had been harvested so there was nowhere to hide
>but you couldn't just shrug off the paranoia you felt
>you couldn't shake the feeling you were watched
>just didn't know where
>you tried not to let whoever know though
>just had to pretend you hadn't noticed
>maybe they'd go away 
>but letting them know you noticed seemed like a bad idea 
>you fed the chickens while giving the woods a side glance occasionally 
>you never felt this way out in the fields before
>once you got the chickens taken care of you were called back to the house
>lunch was ready and good thing too
>you'd went all this time since you'd woken up without a meal
>dumpling soup and beer
>it was filling and warm
>the littlest sister in your family had become adept at dumpling making
>she found it fun
>Emma beamed with pride that you liked her soup
>your siblings ranged I ages from Emma's five to Anna being only a couple years younger than you
>with a few brothers stuck in the middle
>you were man of the house by process of elimination
>the afternoon was easier
>with the harvest done there was little to tend to with the crops
>the cow and sheep had been cared for
>a chill had come in over the mountains to the east
>Mutter insisted you not push yourself too hard
>so you took it easy but not without debate
>at least you could patrol the perimeter of the farm a little
>your Vater had a shotgun he'd used for hunting that you cherished 
>you didn't take it out into the woods because you wanted your family to have something
>you had the gun resting on your shoulder and walked the field, checking the fences
>confidence had returned to you with the firearm in hand
>the unwelcome gaze seemed to have vanished 
>you didn't see anything out of the ordinary and you decided to head back in before it got dark again
>night came and you all had a light supper before bed
>even if you had to share it with your brothers, your bed was a welcome comfort 
>the next two weeks were the routine you'd settled into
>Mutter's medicine was getting low again
>you knew that meant another trek through the woods
>thankfully your arm was feeling much better
>the temptation to bring the gun was there
>but you declined
>you'd just make sure you weren't caught in rain or dark
>you set out at sunrise on a Tuesday 
>crumbs and a razor thin slice of cheese washed down with beer was your morning meal and you'd set out before the rest of the family woke up
>the sun was just cracking up over the horizon
>the apothecary wouldn't be that long a trip if you hurried
>no sight seeing
>just point A to point B
>however, halfway through the woods that same feeling of paranoia returned
>your hair stood up on your neck but you tried not to let it show like that time with the chickens 
>the routine of the past weeks had almost put you at ease and made you forget that experience 
>it was still dawn and your eyes caught nothing out of the ordinary in the light
>you did pick up the pace and held your hand over the handle of your knife
>the birds had quieted down
>all you could hear was the breeze through the branches
>had to speed up
>but not a full sprint
>you didn't want to look like prey to whatever was out there
>thankfully, you made good time and got the herbs before noon
>you dreaded going back through the woods but you couldn't delay
>when you entered to woods you felt comfortable 
>that feeling vanished the second you saw something in the middle of the walking path
>it was a strange effigy made of sticks
>barely came up to your knee
>just planted in the middle of the path
>you didn't see it leaving the farm
>meaning 
>someone really had been watching you
>it wasn't just paranoia speaking
>you moved gingerly around the stickman
>you didn't feel eyes on you but you didn't like any of this
>maybe you needed another path to that medicine in the future
>further along
>another stickman 
>then another
>they grew more frequent as you headed back to the farm
>and you were growing concerned
>whoever was doing this was hanging around your house
>it couldn't be that old lady could it?
>you didn't like this thought whatsoever 
>emerging from the woods, you saw one last stickman with something tied to its neck
>against your better judgment you took it
>it was an orange bag
>looking inside, you saw some sort of herbs
>what was the meaning of this?
>you fumbled with the bag before someone shouted from the farm
>your family realized you were home
>you stood in front of the effigy and blocked it from view
>no need to bring up questions from the family and make them worry more
>tonight you'd patrol the perimeter 
>checking the fences
>well that's what you'd tell everyone
>once your brother went back to his chore you uprooted the stickman and tossed it into the woods
>you hadn't the faintest clue what all that meant but you didn't appreciate the prank
>Mutter had her medicine 
>that's all that mattered
>the rest of the day turned into routine
>the chickens produced a lot of eggs today
>that night you slipped out with a lantern and the shotgun
>you lied and said you needed some night air and you'd be back shortly
>it was probably stupid to go out in the dark
>but it felt like the best chance to catch whatever this was off guard
>you paused when you rounded the house and saw another effigy 
>right next to the porch and everything
>clearly, someone thought this was a jest
>you didn't think it was funny
>you snatched up the effigy and went to toss it into the woods 
>when you chucked it into the brush something rustled out there
>you swung the barrels and discharged into the woods
>you didn't know if you hit anything but you reasoned you needed to get the Hell back inside now
>that scare meant you'd need to reload 
>hopefully whatever was out there didn't realize that as you backed up
>Anna was peeking out the door 
>she was quiet but it was clear that shot had been heard
>you tried to compose yourself and lied
>you'd seen a fox around the chickens
>they seemed to buy it
>you didn't tell anyone about the eyes shining in the treeline right before heading back in
>you'd locked up the house and tried to settle into sleep
>you had to put up a strong act
>otherwise you'd worry the family
>the shotgun was reloaded and placed above the fireplace 
>you decided tonight to sleep near it, on the couch facing the slowly crackling fire
>perhaps the stress had gotten to you though, for as soon as you got to rest you began to be plagued by dreams
>vivid ones
>it began with a weight on you, pressing you into the couch
>you couldn't pick out what was causing it
>just that it was heavy enough to pin you
>the room was just as you left it when you dozed off
>just with a fog hanging over your mind
>it was like something was there
>but you couldn't tell specifically 
>the weight was memorable though
>the weight moved over you
>in particular your crotch kept getting attention 
>rubbed over and over
>when you woke up you realized it was still dark out and you then realized you'd ejaculated in your pants
>was the dream that good?
>you tried to ignore the sinful act
>trying to go to bed again had the dream start over
>something over you and your crotch was rubbed against
>whispers picked up around you
>a feminine voice, unfamiliar to you, murmuring all around you
>the shape pinning you
>the voice
>it was just vague that you knew it was someone but you couldn't make it out
>this was so frustrating 
>what was this
>without warning you found yourself out in the woods in the dark
>a mouth pushed against yours and forced a hot liquid down your throat
>the hot liquid instantly spread heat through your body
>the rubbing intensified 
>the darkness overwhelmed you
>when you woke up again, you saw eyes outside the window before the shape fled from the scene

>you had no idea what was going on
>all this couldn't be mere coincidence 
>the rest of the night you stayed up and tended to the fireplace
>you tried to ignore everything, hoping it would just go away
>there was no explanation for all of this other than perhaps witchcraft
>maybe that was the source of all this
>though you didn't know what witchcraft really was
>you tried not to think about it
>thinking about it might attract more of it
>telling your family seemed like a bad idea
>you didn't want them worrying
>it was just more responsibility to shoulder
>you could weather it
>asking your town priest seemed like a good idea
>although, he might accuse you 
>you'd have to figure it out
>whoever this was was getting bolder
>that shape at the window bothered you
>was it tied to the dream?
>had to be
>why did that dream make you feel that way?
>the next morning you were still up, making some excuse about your stomach to Mutter
>she offered more bread for breakfast as a way to calm it 
>but you felt guilty about lying to begin with
>whatever devilry going on in those woods couldn't be allowed to come into the home
>you noticed a pattern of calm after your trips out there
>it only picked up on your trips for the medicine 
>then whatever it was tended to leave you alone for a while
>at least that was the theory
>that meant heading out for more medicine was unfortunate 
>but needed
>whatever was out there had you between a rock and a hard place
>you needed to cut through the forest as the fastest route
>this time, you would come ready
>it felt ridiculous and selfish taking the shotgun with you
>but you wanted the insurance and whatever it was seemed only interested in you
>so you hinged on that bet, hoping you'd only have to worry about yourself 
>it didn't take long on the trip for something to happen this time
>a fork off the usual walking path that was never there before
>you'd like to think you knew these woods but whatever this was wasn't here two weeks ago
>one could reason you hadn't been harmed by whatever this was
>that could be a ploy
>it could want your soul, your body being useless to it
>whatever it was it wasn't human
>and you weren't falling for whatever trick it had here
>you avoided the new path and hugged your gun a little tighter as you walked forward
>plus, just because no harm had come to you before didn't mean it couldn't happen
>that night with the dogs had to be the link
>you normally never went out that late
>these forests bordered your fields for generations
>you'd have heard about something in here by now
>the urge to bring it up to Mutter was there
>maybe it was some family secret 
>it was possible
>after about a half hour of walking you made a realization 
>you recognized none of this
>familiar landmarks like a broken tree or a certain rock were nowhere to be seen
>this path was completely alien
>it was impossible 
>it should be the regular path
>you ignored the intersection then carried on and…
>if whatever was out here did the branch in the first place what could stop it from changing other things?
>you turned and went to run back the way you came only to see the path now led to a cabin
>not unlike that old woman's, but just different enough
>when you turned to go away from the cabin you saw… the cabin
>the door opened on its own
>this had to be some devil's work
>you didn't want to be here but you seemed trapped 
>but playing this game seemed like a bad idea
>yet you were offered no other choice
>you were trapped out here
>dammit
>you turned to look and sure enough the only sight you had before you was a cabin with an open door
>to your left
>cabin
>right
>cabin
>no matter where you stood you were presented an open door
>it was not a choice
>so what you decided was instead of fulfilling the whims so some forest demon… you'd sit down
>whatever game it wanted you to play you weren't participating 
>you couldn't see into the house all that well 
>and you weren't curious enough to peek
>that's how you'd die
>trying to crawl close enough to look inside
>it was wanting you to be impatient
>but you weren't doing this
>whatever this was
>the air felt strange 
>as if the whole situation wasn't strange
>but there was the strange sweet smell 
>coming from the doorway
>no
>in fact, you aimed the gun towards the open doorway now
>"what are you doing?"
>the feminine voice behind you was calm but wasn't exactly calming
>you fumbled with the gun and nearly misfired it into the cabin in front of you
>you'd leapt to your feet and stumbled around
>a young woman in peasant clothes
>hair red as the sunrise
>you tried not to look at her ample exposed chest
>she looked you over and you looked past her
>more importantly than whoever this was you saw a way out
>you shoved past and ran down the dirt road, not even sparing a look over your shoulder
>you wanted no part of this 
>when you couldn't breath only then did you stop
>your lungs feeling like they were on fire
>when you finally regained your strength you made a terrible discovery
>the sun was going downcast the horizon
>you knew you set out in the morning
>the trip shouldn't have taken that long
>at this rate the forest couldn't be trusted
>it wasn't yours and you had become very aware of that
>you had little time to mull over things when the sun just vanished over the hills
>faster than it should
>cackling 
>you remembered that drifting through the woods and couldn't explain just where it came from
>so in a scene very familiar to you now, you took shelter under a tree
>whatever was going on, you were in its clutches
>you set the shotgun down on your lap
>this wasn't your finest hour
>you'd manage a way out of this though
>you had to
>the laughing grew in intensity and you were on edge now
>it was that damn dog incident
>that was the start of all this
>that peasant girl was tied to all this 
>trying to look cute and harmless with her cleavage out
>you did one good deed and this is what it got you
>when the laughing stopped you relaxed a little
>then whispering picked up
>a myriad of voice formed a sort of quiet chorus
>the shotgun was the only thing giving you any confidence now
>even that you had your doubts on how effective it would be
>your mind was racing
>whatever demons were out there were intent on you
>but you needed the farm
>you needed your family
>you tried hard to think of them
>you'd see them again
>this thing would not claim you
>you fell back on prayer
>while not the most devout, it brought you comfort
>blocking out everything, shutting you eyes tight
>when the whispers were replaced by birdsong only then did you peek
>the sun was out again, in fact it really hadn't moved much since morning
>was the whole thing an illusion?

>you made the best of the situation and rushed towards the village
>sprinting meant you made it out of the woods in good time
>you spared a glance over your shoulder as you caught your breath
>nothing seemed amiss but you dreaded the walk back
>but you dreaded the idea of doing it in the dark even more so you'd have to hurry
>you'd brought a few things to trade for the herbs
>you hated it but you were reduced to trading out family heirlooms at this point
>not that Mutter knew that
>you weren't about to tell her either
>hopefully she wouldn't notice 
>the few pieces of gold you had to trade with was getting slimmer and slimmer
>you'd persist
>just like everything else
>you wished the town your farm was apart of had a doctor, let alone a herbalist 
>something to do away with these trips through the woods
>maybe even cheaper too
>you'd heard talk of a train being possible in the near future with the local gossip
>you'd never seen one before but you'd heard how fast they could be and it sounded implausible 
>not the most unreal thing in hindsight
>you didn't dally, sightseeing wasn't a good thing with the day only being so long
>from what you guessed you had time to spare before sundown, though every day meant less and less time
>soon winter would come and you'd have no real window
>staying overnight in town for your safety was too costly an idea
>setting up camp in the woods seemed unwise
>you reasoned you'd have to just camp on the outskirts if it came to that
>hopefully it wouldn't 
>Mutter's medicine in hand you started through the woods
>the leaves had started to turn orange and brown, some already falling to the forest floor
>you gripped your shotgun but the trip through the village made you somewhat relaxed
>the solitude out here was a comfort though
>you didn't feel any presence 
>birds sang, squirrels skitted across the trees above you
>you even saw a doe on your way home
>you mulled over shooting her but she bolted upon realizing you were standing so close
>maybe another time
>when you came back to the homestead Anna came to greet you
>said someone came by looking for you
>confused, you asked who it was
>"some girl, she's sitting inside with Mutter"
>you were still perplexed but went along
>when you opened the door you froze in the doorway
>sitting next to Mutter on the couch
>that red headed girl from before
>Mutter and the girl seemed deep in conversation 
>all smiles
>when you walked in you all seemed to pause
>you from shock and them from the guest
>the girl was a spitting image 
>you could have sworn…
>you tried to not let the stress show on your face in front of Mutter 
>the shotgun was pointed towards the floor but you were keenly aware of it in your hand
>with Mutter involved you didn't want to bring it to that
>the girl broke the ice
>Füchsin 
>strange name
>but she seemed friendly enough
>Mutter spoke up 
>said this Füchsin had already met you before
>that's when it occurred to you
>the dogs
>of course
>but what about the crazy stuff in the woods?
>not like you could ask openly 
>this woman was still a stranger and couldn't be trusted
>while you saved her and you had a sneaking suspicion she was the one to patch your arm up
>you behaved yourself and tried not to fly into accusations of witchcraft
>for all you knew, she had nothing to do with it
>maybe stress was making you mentally unsound 
>Füchsin excused herself from the conversation and gave a small pouch to Mutter
>you were confused until the girl explained she ran a herb trade of her own in the woods
>out of gratitude she'd help your situation 
>that blindsided you
>no more trips through the woods
>Mutter would be safe
>holy hell
>she'd lived out there with her grandmother as a hermit of sorts
>while you still were suspicious she dangled a fantastic deal in front of you
>you'd bite
>when she asked for you to escort her home you'd agree 
>this was overwhelming 
>the medicine for free
>all the gold and work, unnecessary 
>all for saving her, something you'd have done without thinking
>of course you'd help
>it also sort of helped she looked gorgeous 
>if you were more of an unscrupulous sort you may have been tempted
>Mutter didn't seem to notice Füchsin's massive cleavage but you were a young man
>the pale skin was practically on display 
>red firey hair constrained in a bonnet
>a fierce look in her eyes when they locked with yours
>she was striking
>and she wanted a walk home
>you left the shotgun by the door just in case for the family
>hopefully you'd get there just fine
>the solution to all your problems was walking in front of you towards the woods and filled out a dress better than a bar maid
>only once out in the woods did she really speak up to you
>"I didn't really need an escort out here."
>she turned to meet your confused gaze
>"I merely wanted privacy for a business proposal"
>oh no
>she reclined against a tree and checked her nails while the weight of what she said hung over you
>you felt like she was fishing for him to question
>it wasn't the smartest idea to engage this stranger
>you felt like trusting her in hindsight wasn't a good idea
>but you wanted to believe a solution had landed in your lap
>a way out for your family
>perhaps that was too good a deal
>but you were curious
>so you finally decided to play along
>fine, what was the proposition?
>she smiled and it felt like the predator was with you right now
>"well, what if I told you I wasn't some sort of helpless damsel? is that a deal breaker?"
>you lifted an eyebrow
>she continued
>"what if I wasn't human?"
>oh dammit 
>dammit dammit
>she was a demon
>you accused her of it immediately, flying off the handle 
>her reaction… was to giggle
>she was laughing as you brandished a knife in her direction
>you turned to run
>you knew this deal was too good to be true
>a horde of those effigies stood behind you
>the little stickmen weren't just decoration
>they moved and had blocked your path 
>you spun on your heel once more to accuse her of this and she'd covered the distance to stand right behind you
>the smile made you uncomfortable 
>she swiftly disarmed you of the knife and tossed it to the little stickmen behind you
>you didn't even have time to react as she moved like a pickpocket 
>"you didn't even hear the deal"
>well you didn't have much choice
>bravado was hard to hold up right now
>but you'd hear her out
>fine
>she could do her worst
>at that last declaration she giggled again
>you flinched when she grabbed your shirt and tore it open, exposing your chest
>you wouldn't give her the satisfaction of fear
>"there we go," she said as she eyed you, "don't you feel more comfortable?"
>sensing the tension, she scoffed at your concern about your immortal soul right now
>"if I was a demon would I be threatened by dogs?"
>ok, she had a point
>she pulled her bonnet off with a flourish and a tiny effigy caught it as it was tossed aside
>you didn't know how to react when she started completely undressing
>the dress was tossed aside, leaving her skin bare for the world to see
>more specifically you
>"don't get too used to this."
>you had no idea what that meant 
>she reached up to her face and gripped into her hair
>confusion turned into horror when she started pulling her face off
>you stumbled and fell backwards as the sound of tearing fabric broke up the silence of the woods
>that's what struck you
>the sound
>someone pulling apart thin fabric with their hands
>when Füchsin had pulled her face off enough something else stuck with you
>her eyes
>you remembered those eyes
>her face wasn't human whatsoever 
>that smiling facade now pulled past a canine snout decorated with a mouth of canine teeth
>the red of her hair was the same red as her fur
>it reminded you of a fox
>she kept peeling like the human form was sort of clingy suit
>broad shoulders, then a puff of white fur on his chest that could put that cleavage to shame
>slender arms terminating in long claws
>a fluffy crimson tail and generous hips
>you were dumbstruck as she smiled at you before wiggling her hips out of the last bit of costume
>you realized then that she wasn't a she
>a strange sheath sat above two furry testicles
>it wasn't quite like yours but Füchsin here wasn't a woman
>the non human part was a more pressing concern though
>you'd been frozen on the forest floor, incapable of doing more than inwardly panicking at whatever you'd just seen
>the creature calling itself Füchsin tossed the skin aside as one would do an old coat then rested his hands on his hips
>"I told you I wasn't a demon," he admonished you in a silky voice more feminine than the girl's he was just using
>you had no idea what all of this was
>one thing was certain and that was you were in over your head
>this maybe explained some things
>not a lot 
>but your mind was piecing together some things
>so the dream?
>"well I'm glad you remembered. just testing the waters, so to speak."
>how could dogs have harmed him if he has these… talents
>"I'm still a fox."
>that wasn't a sufficient answer but you wanted to move things along
>maybe you really were mentally unwell
>fine
>what was this deal?
>might as well get on with it
>hopefully the death would be quick
>you stood up and dusted yourself off and asked 
>"that's a good boy. well, how's marriage for your farm thriving sound?"
>a clawed hand cupped your chin, the paw pads soft to the touch
>there was a smirk in his eyes as you were stunned 
>marriage to… who?
>he ruffled your hair with his paw
>Füchsin stood a bit shorter than you so he had to reach a little
>"I think you can figure out the bride pretty easy."
>the voice was honeyed and he seemed to relish in your discomfort 
>running still was an option
>you didn't have to entertain whatever this was
>but that offer
>you could save the farm, your family
>it could be that easy
>but this was a man before you, and an inhuman one at that
>that weighed on your mind
>this had to be a ploy 
>some sort of trap
>you grabbed his wrist and pushed the hand away from your face
>you couldn't allow yourself to fall into this thing's grasp
>all the temptations to just suddenly solve all your issues
>dangling solutions in front of you
>"for a marriage?"
>his eyes focused on your hand
>the grin faded from his face
>"what do you think you're doing?"
>he looked annoyed and pulled his arm away
>how could you not be hostile and scared with how whoever this was had spent weeks tormenting you
>all for a marriage
>why should you even humor that?
>you asked that bluntly
>"well I would like to play nice…"
>Füchsin grinned but this smile carried little of the previous mirth
>"I wear my best skin to impress you and even give your mother medicine."
>the fox turned from you and paced 
>the stickmen could be knocked over and you could make a run for it
>this thing knew where you lived and could stop you from getting those herbs for Mutter
>this situation was tense
>why did he even want to marry you anyways 
>you were a poor farmer with barely much to your name
>the fox sauntered, that was the best way to put it, like he was showing off
>just pacing, eyeing you 
>"well, until I get the answer I want, I guess you're just staying here."
>ok screw this
>you turned away from the fox and went to run
>a clawed hand held your shoulder back
>"why are you so hasty now?"
>the honeyed tone was gone
>you were frozen in midstep 
>there was magic afoot here 
>you were shoved over lighty 
>the stickmen servants caught you and you saw Füchsin gesture for them to move
>it was impossible to move anything but your eyes
>the assembled servants carried you like ants carrying food to their nest
>you prayed this wasn't how you died
>you were taken to a burrow 
>you recognized it as the cave you'd seen in your dream after the dog attack
>only now did you realize that wasn't a dream
>the effigies gently deposited you on a cot
>only then did the fox approach you and touch you
>with his touch you found yourself able to move again
>"we could have just done this the easy way, sweetie."
>you flinched away from his touch but the wall of the cave was to your back
>he had some sort of gourd of liquid in his other paw
>the orange caught your eye before he knocked back whatever was in it
>then he pinned you to the wall and forcefully kissed you
>it took you seconds to realize he was force feeding you whatever was in that gourd and you struggled to escape 
>he let you go and you tried coughing it up whole trying to get out of bed 
>"oh you won't want to go too far."
>what the hell did he mean by that
>you shot him a look and he reached up and petted you
>the grin returned 
>you grew nervous
>"you probably know just a little about something called a love potion, correct?"
>you nodded slowly as he moved to play with your face
>"a sort of elixir to make you fall head over heels for me."
>oh God he was trying to coerce you with chemicals
>"well that wasn't it. I just poisoned us and only I know where the antidote is."
>your eyes shot wide
>you almost reached out for the fox but Füchsin backed off the bed and gave you a wag of one clawed finger
>"marriage now, live long life later. I don't think I could make it simpler."
>your mind was racing
>just why would this creature want marriage this badly?
>you asked him if he realized he'd die too
>"oh I'm well aware. point is, how much do you think I'll wager? you probably think I'll just get scared."
>he leaned in and poked you on the nose
>"this is very serious."
>you had to ask for real
>why you?
>"simple. you rescued me so I'm merely extending my hand in marriage out of gratitude."
>he poisoned you
>you were poisoned right now
>you arguing this point got him to politely pat your head like one would placate a child
>"that's because you don't know what's good for you."
>he then procured a small box from a shelf
>the thought of running occurred but with this poison how far could you go? 
>"now then," he remarked while opening up the box to you
>gold bands were the only thing in the box and you didn't need him explaining what that meant
>the teeth had returned as Füchsin's yellow gaze awaited your next move
>he was forcing your hand and he was smug about it
>"come now, don't want to leave the family behind do you?"
>he spoke that in the voice of that old woman you initially met
>that earned him a glare
>you should have left him to those dogs
>blatantly manipulation like this was not a way to put you at ease
>you set your jaw and took a ring from the box, the surrender leaving a bitter taste in your mouth
>this thing, he was a demon 
>in your eyes he felt unnatural and the threat to you and yours had you on edge
>but he had you over a barrel 
>this bargain was the only way you could see out
>so, now what?
>"glad you asked," his voice returning to what you guessed was his natural one
>he slipped a ring onto a slender clawed finger and looked at it after, paying you little mind before he realized you hadn't put on yours
>"well?"
>he looked down expectantly 
>fine
>you put the ring on and it fit surprisingly well
>he tossed the box to the side and it clattered on the cave floor
>your marriage should have been a happy day
>instead you were in some gloomy cave that smelled of herbs and smoke
>how the hell did he make this look like a cabin? 
>wait 
>hell
>happy thoughts and prayer 
>that worked last time
>maybe you could drive him away again
>after the antidote 
>you needed the antidote 
>demanded it
>"oh that," he said with a laugh
>"I fed you water. surprise."
>you immediately went to pull off the ring
>goddamn witchcraft
>water
>he tricked you with water
>but… the ring refused to budge
>he stood there, triumphant 
>a hand on his hip
>"I needed you to volunteer for the spell to work. you should be flattered. those are an heirloom."
>you were free to get out of bed now and took the opportunity 
>you stood over the fox and he looked up to you
>"good men like you are hard to find."
>oh so now we resorted to flattery
>you were at a loss what to do now so you hoped that prayer and good thoughts trick would work
>"it won't work sweetie."
>you looked a little shocked
>"I can't completely read your thoughts but I do get little flashes."
>dammit
>"anyways, I ended up pulling back after realizing I went too far that day."
>the fox gently placed his arms on your shoulders and leaned into you
>you felt so defeated right now 
>maybe he was trying to decieve you again
>mentally, you sought safety in prayer regardless of what he claimed
>he wasn't leaving after even after a half dozen repeated prayers
>closing your eyes to the whole situation didn't help
>he seemed to let you have this 
>either out of courtesy or to rub the victory in your face you couldn't tell 
>but he still had a smirk 
>"God might have taken issue with me before, but guess who bagged himself a Christian husband?"
>he nuzzled up to your chest and you still had no idea how to react to any of this
>light outside the cave dimming made you keenly aware of how late things had carried on
>he took notice of you staring
>"oh you don't want to go out there after dark. I've heard there's a witch that lives out in these woods."
>he laughed and played with your hair
>then in a flash of movement he shoved you back onto the cot, pinning you to the bed
>"I insist you stay as my guest."
>the way he straddled you left hardly any guess at his intentions
>you pushed him back, finding your agency being stripped of you too much to bare at this point
>he didn't fight the shove
>instead he gripped your arm rested his chin in your palm, striking a pose as he looked down at you
>you wanted to get up but he decided to be dead weight and make it that much harder
>soft fur brushed over your bare skin
>"I know for a fact these strong hands and arms are wasted just plowing a field."
>he nuzzled his face against the arm shoving him back
>"doesn't your wife deserve to get the same attention?"
>attempts to wave him off ended with him wrestling your arm
>as in he ended up locking his arms, legs and tail around your right arm
>you had some experience with wrestling from your family and he was frankly small enough you fought the hold
>moving was difficult but not not impossible
>you looked around the around for something as the fox grappled your arm
>something to break the hold 
>then you'd run and never come back to these woods
>"don't you dare," he hissed out
>maybe he could really ready your mind
>you didn't know the exact science of that but that was going to make things difficult 
>your arm made moving off the bed difficult 
>but you ended up somehow dragging yourself and flopped face first onto the cave floor
>the fox's furry thighs clamped tighter around your bicep 
>"I could freeze you again. I could. but that's too easy."
>you drug yourself across the cave floor
>searching for anything
>he had a cauldron of some sort of bubbling concoction with a slow fire underneath 
>that was an option
>"seeing you gut that hound to save me… God you don't know how much that sold you as 'the one'"
>something wet rubbed against your arm as he kept trying to pin you
>he had trinkets and baubles on shelves too high to reach
>you tried hard to shake him off again to no effect
>he sounded desperate and frustrated
>your shirt sleeve was a mess
>when he started licking at your hand you froze, unable to comprehend just what that was about
>you shouted at him and asked just what the hell he was doing
>"let me lick you!" he shouted as you tried to wave your arm
>this was becoming ridiculous 
>he went from trying to charm you to extortion to this
>it felt like forever grappling with him in the floor
>he tried licking your hand until you finally managed to get your hand clasped over his muzzle
>at least you'd get some quiet but he wasn't letting go and you could see it getting dark out
>out in the woods with this thing sounded like hell again
>you could get more violent 
>but something stayed your hand
>maybe because he was essentially smaller in every way to you
>you would feel guilty
>maybe it was fear you would incur worse from him
>might have been both
>you had a hold of him at the moment and you didn't want him getting a better grip
>the whole time he tried jerking his snout out of your hand
>you toyed with the idea of grabbing wood from under the cauldron
>that was a last resort
>what you did instead was instead of flailing around any more you readied yourself 
>he didn't anticipate you putting all your strength into pushing you both up and in one motion grab the scruff of his neck
>it worked on your old cat
>you discovered he wasn't a cat when he grappled both your arms now that they were close together
>it didn't throw you off balance to one side but he had you locked in tightly
>"mmmph mmmph mmmph"
>at least your hand was still steadfast
>neither of you would yield
>he clung to your arms tightly and you refused to take a one knee
>one hand was free now to grab anything off the shelves
>you snatched a bottle with a sprayer attached to it
>you tried to spritz it in his face but he kept moving
>wasn't easy to aim blind
>you stopped when you realized it was a perfume that smelled of apples 
>making him smell nicer wouldn't help the situation 
>the fox continued to wiggle around your arms with the deft maneuvering of a snake
>you realized too late he just needed to tire you out 
>that was his whole goal, to make you expend energy
>and you were getting weaker carrying the spasming fox
>you roared and in one desperate final act ripped an arm free
>judging by the fox pausing you'd left an impression 
>you weren't getting toyed with 
>he was awestruck looking at you looking down at him
>he just wiggled against your arm
>you felt his weight once more throwing you off balance
>this time you landed on top of him
>he'd have to give up with you smothering him
>he released his hand and started tearing at your pants
>his claws shredded through the material easily
>you still had a hold of his muzzle but the grip was awkward now
>in the struggle you ended up with the fox's head between your legs
>the way he was shredding at your garments meant you were scared to let him go
>putting him at crotch level seemed like a bad idea in hindsight
>you didn't have the luxury of thinking too hard right now
>Füchsin had your manhood exposed now and you bucked when you felt a warm tongue over the length
>what the hell was he doing?
>you tried to stand up but his arms snaked around you and he grabbed onto your pants 
>he had worked your length in his needle toothed mouth and you were hesitant to get really violent

>you were fighting the urge right now
>you had to stay flaccid 
>it would be admitting defeat if you got hard
>you couldn't let the fox own you like that
>a combination of fear and prayer was sort of working
>however the fox man was tempting you with every lick
>you'd never done anything like this
>this was sodomy 
>you'd never even had a woman do this
>the line for brides is shorter for someone only owning a couple acres in nowhere
>let alone getting this far without marriage
>and here was Füchsin throating your manhood
>some sort of man beast witch and he was intimate with your manhood
>the space he had under you allowed him to bob a little and you felt the blood rushing there 
>he was winning dammit
>you felt like you were taken hostage
>letting his muzzle slip was a mistake
>a little voice I the back of your head was speaking up now
>the devil on your shoulder
>honeyed words came to mind, in a soft teasing tone
>it didn't feel that bad did it?
>in fact…
>didn't it feel good?
>a reward for all the stress and grief
>didn't you deserve to be rewarded?
>you felt your dick growing 
>the sin was great, you knew that
>you were keenly aware
>but maybe just once you'd have a moment of weakness
>to just allow it 
>you'd spent your life toiling
>was this some sort of reward, maybe?
>it was starting to make your head feel fuzzy
>you could always free yourself after
>run away
>yes
>that was it
>let him think he'd won now
>then repent later
>you relaxed a little as you allowed him to think he had victory
>the tongue worked the top of your shaft and every time Füchsin targeted the head you bucked a little and the fox shoved you as deep as possible into his mouth
>given how he was non-human, he had an easier time with your length 
>you felt him moan against you occasionally
>this was good
>so hot and amazing
>there was nothing to compare it to
>he kept your arm locked in with his legs but he rutted against your arm
>his own manhood leaking onto your shirt sleeve
>you don't remember what coaxed your orgasm 
>somehow all the tension and fear ebbed away in that moment
>you felt at ease
>when you softened and he pulled his mouth away the weight of what you did hit you 
>you'd laid with another man, possibly a demon
>all for momentary pleasure
>he released your leg and you fell over to the side of him
>you were damned now 
>he took the initiative and hopped on your chest
>his ass nearly knocked the wind out of you
>"doesn't it feel good?"
>the fox witch's cock throbbed and you could see it for the first time
>red and angry, with some sort of ball at the base poking out of the sheath
>he leaned his head down to look you in the eye
>"I mean, if you're damned you're damned."
>he casually wiggled on your chest
>his fluffy crimson tail wagged
>"but… you wouldn't be damned alone."
>his clawed finger pressed the head of his cock down to meet your mouth
>he gently pressed the tip there and smeared precum over your lips
>you were dealing with matters of your soul and he was trying to glaze your mouth
>he grinned down at you as you mulled over your life now
>you didn't have to give in there and you did
>"I could show you a place that probably burns a lot hotter than hellfire."
>the witch had won
>you'd given your seed away through inaction and lust
>he pulled the cock away from your mouth and look slightly perplexed
>"I didn't think hunting a husband would end in depression. you're not going to, say, punish me? I did lead you into eternal damnation, right?"
>he clicked his tongue against his cheek and looked down disappointed 
>"where was that drive from a few moments ago? I wanted to marry a man, not a fish."
>well, that snapped you back
>you had dealt with plenty from Füchsin 
>you'd been scared and terrified of whatever it was on your chest
>and now he was insulting you
>fine
>you weren't taking this insult lying down
>you'd been mock poisoned 
>taunted
>frightened through the woods
>cursed with jewelry 
>wrestled to the ground
>had your seed shot down some strange man's throat 
>and now he was attempting to emasculate you
>you shot your hands up and grabbed his wrists
>he was shocked
>actually wiped the smug off his face
>you used the rest of your body to shove him back off you and stood up
>you towered over him right now, not just physically 
>enough was enough
>you wouldn't be a toy for whatever this was
>you shoved him against the cave wall
>your eyes locked on his
>whatever was going on you were a man and you weren't going to let him control this or you
>witch or demon, he wasn't the master of your soul
>you asked why you shouldn't just dunk him in that glorified stew pot he's got going
>in a miracle you'd actually given him pause
>you were fed up with all of this
>he couldn't just dangle a solution to all your problems over your head like that and not expect anger
>couldn't just seduce you
>it was your turn to be stunned into silence when he licked his mouth and narrowed his eyes at you
>you had thought that last sentence and he seemed to react in time
>maybe he really could skim thoughts from your mind
>"sure enough, it isn't perfect mind you."
>he wiggled his fingers on his ring paw to draw your eye there
>the things really were cursed
>you asked how to undo that
>you figured you wouldn't get an answer but it couldn't hurt
>"wedding rings work like wedding vows"
>he gave you a minute to process that before the horror dawned on you
>"just a jest. a joke."
>you stared daggers into him
>"relax, I can reveal it to you. just come closer."
>you didn't lose any of your rage and stared him down
>"I need to whisper it into your ear"
>you were skeptical but what could he do with his wrists restrained and his feet off the ground
>even if he nipped at you you were still stronger
>his back was against the actual wall
>you'd indulge the damn witch
>you leaned in close and he moved his muzzle to your ear
>in a warm sultry voice he whispered
>"that's my man"
>his legs shot up and he wrapped them around your waist and you realized you'd allowed him to grapple you again
>he made sure to brush his manhood against yours as you tried to pry him off
>every move seemed to get him frotting against you
>"please don't fight it, my love. you wanted it in your dreams."
>he used your objection as an opportunity to shove his tongue into your mouth
>with the way his face was, it was clumsy kissing you
>he licked at you with all the enthusiasm of a puppy greeting its master while you tried to fumble away
>it wasn't that he was strong or heavy
>his combination of stubbornness and dexterity made it hard to dislodge him once he had a hold of you
>the fox witch's legs had clamped and locked around you tightly
>it was a struggle you were trying to win
>you tried not to think about his soft fur against your skin
>how his manhood jousted with yours with all the moving
>you would resist
>that devil on your shoulder wouldn't win this time
>you couldn't let it
>the struggle ended up having Füchsin throwing his weight to one side and knocking you off balance
>you landed with him on his back on the bed
>you still pinning him, his legs locked tight
>he kept clumsily showering you with licks and you cursed
>he could not be winning this
>your erection said otherwise and he knew it
>dammit
>he rolled his hips against yours
>"don't you want to plant your seeds?" he murmured 
>this vulgar flirting wasn't working
>the promise of relief, of pleasure
>no dammit
>it wasn't happening
>"don't you deserve to be taken care of for once?"
>this wasn't a fox
>he was a viper
>all the sweet promises of "what you deserved"
>he couldn't get his paws free
>his voice was mingling with the devil's on your shoulder
>this ring 
>would you have to chop off your finger?
>that made him snap
>"don't you dare."
>he started coming on stronger in your mind
>all heaving chests
>crimson fur splattered with your seed
>"I'm not trying to take away your life. just make it better"
>he was taunting you in your mind as he tried kissing you as messy as possible
>damn witchcraft
>trying to flash images of fertile acres
>a happy, healthy, family
>all these little promises
>this witch was trying to hex you, charm you
>it was… working
>"you work so hard."
>the voice was so sweet in your head
>he didn't need to win the struggle physically
>not when he had his claws in your mind
>slowly he was attempting and succeeding in eroding your resolve 
>he kept throwing happy futures out there
>whispering sweet possibilities 
>if only you fulfilled your marriage
>with how he'd slithered into your mind all you could think of is the snake that tempted Eve
>yet, you weren't in Eden
>your life wasn't ideal
>and here he was trying to sing sweet promises into your mind
>maybe you wanted them
>maybe 
>Mutter healthy 
>the kids growing up fine
>your family's land something now even more prosperous 
>would they smile down at you proudly?
>you had no idea
>but this bargain
>the promise
>you could make a better life for everyone if you just
>did it
>the voice didn't say what it was but instinctually you knew what it was
>you knew what your duty as a husband entailed 
>you had so much weight on your shoulders and maybe that was what broke you
>with the relief promised 
>maybe you could trade your soul
>you sighed and relaxed 
>you hated giving up and allowing this witch to have victory
>he sensed your grip loosening and pulled his arms away so he could wrap them around you
>he ruffled his paw through your hair
>"there there, I think you've worked hard enough."
>maybe you were lonely for some companionship because that gesture melted away your resistance 
>he cooed to your ear as he gently played with your hair
>was this what a wife was like?
>were you avoiding this warmth this whole time?
>you melted against the fox witch's warm coat
>he whispered sweet nothings into your ear instead of your mind
>"I will stay out of your head. in my haste I didn't consider your feelings."
>his body felt hot against yours even after he'd calmed down
>"you can at least see the benefits now though. it doesn't have to be so tough for you."
>he licked along your neck and softly rolled his hips against you
>"I don't have to be a woman or even human to know not to pass up a man like you."
>he started smelling you and you were reminded of a dog
>those eyes that had haunted you days before had a different quality in them when he pushed you back softly 
>they had a pleading look behind them and he didn't need more honeyed words
>maybe it would be alright
>the fox could be your wife
>maybe things didn't have to be so hard
>maybe
>he had tricked you before
>but was your life that much better before this?
>you'd toiled and lost
>and he offered such a prize
>maybe it was bait, but dammit you were going to take it
>you just prayed you made the right decision here
>this time, you initiated and forced your tongue into his toothy muzzle and he bucked against you
>your hands went for his hips
>this was your wife now
>you were probably already damned 
>you could blame anything on what happened next
>truth was you chose to lay with him
>Füchsin called over one of those little stickmen and you were aware you'd been watched the whole time
>they presented him a jar
>then a smaller bottle
>you trusted this wasn't anything weird
>maybe not the smartest idea but you hoped this led to those little promises 
>he swigged a little of the small bottle
>then handed it to you
>against your better judgement you downed the remainder 
>it burned on the way down
>but what happened next was shocking
>you felt burning hot and your dick was painfully erect
>he seemed to be burning up too
>your dicks were slick and pounding as your hearts pumped like hammers
>"consider it a little enhancement. not that I'm worried about performance."
>it made you start to feel feral
>you nipped at his neck
>this witch made a mistake offering himself like this
>he stopped you to get you to lube you your manhood with the contents of the jar
>"that way no one gets hurt."
>you growled how he wasn't sitting down all week 
>"that's the spirit, love"
>he giggled and moaned when you pushed against his tail hole
>he was lined up perfectly to be bred and you needed to oblige now
>your mind was quickly becoming a haze and all you could center on was the hole giving way
>the fox was at least easy on the eyes for something inhuman
>maybe that was the drug talking
>you bottomed out eventually and just sat there
>he clenched at you
>his tongue was out and he was panting next to your ear
>it just felt right inside him
>"so how's it feel? good enough you'll want it every night right?"
>you grit your teeth as you pulled back
>his confident attitude melted with a whine
>it did feel amazing 
>this heat pulsing through you both felt like a furnace 
>it was even better than his mouth
>you had no point of reference for how good this was
>Füchsin cooed into your ear as he brushed your cheek 
>"let your wife take care of you"
>there was a sweetness behind that voice
>"let it all out."
>he rubbed his legs against your back
>he lapped at your neck
>every time he felt you hit a certain spot he gasped 
>you picked up his ass to angle better and made deeper thrusts 
>"oh, you animal"
>the laugh was sultry 
>his tail wagged between your legs as you kept pumping
>it did feel good to finally let go
>to just rut into him
>you were fully aware how wrong this all was
>but it just felt too good to stop
>every night, he promised that
>you might take him up on that offer
>maybe it was the lust talking but he looked better than with his disguise
>his chest fluff against yours was silky soft
>his whole coat was soft to the touch but his chest in particular was like a pillow
>flat as he was
>could you rest your head on that?
>you'd been at this for so long and family is one thing but Füchsin promised just so much more
>you followed your base instincts and just kept pumping your length into the witch
>he would slip sweet nothings into your ear, then tremble in your grip the next moment
>"a happy home, all for you."
>yeah, he'd broken your resolve down
>you wanted this
>craved it
>the smell, the heat, the tight clench as he moaned out your name
>he just kept drip feeding you honey and promises
>and so help you 
>it had won you over
>you mated him deep into his bed
>your bed
>if this witch was your wife you accepted it completely now
>if he could make your life better why not
>this already was an improvement 
>his ears flicked on top of his head as you growled then went for his neck again
>the burning
>it needed to all end one way
>he groaned as one final thrust pushed your cock and it's load deep into him
>he shot his own load onto your chests the heat seemed to just pour into him as you felt like your orgasm lasted for eternity 
>it made you see spots in the corner of your eyes and you collapsed on top of him
>his own body seemed rocked by it and he kept spasming on your dick
>what brought you back was him speaking after regaining his strength 
>"wait."
>you looked up to see him looking at his paws
>"that witch…"
>you looked confused but he was still staring at his paws
>he stared daggers into your eyes
>"I was supposed to be human. all I needed was someone's love turning me into their ideal form."
>what?
>yeah you were confused 
>"I would have even been fine with the woman thing if it meant I was human."
>was all this bullshit
>just to get something from you?
>that left everything on a sour note
>first off, treating love as a business transaction wasn't the right way to go about things
>he nearly spoke up but you hushed him
>secondly, you wanted him
>so even if there was a spell to "fix" whatever this was you'd toss it aside
>he could feel your cock stir to life inside himself again and he got wide eyed
>he wasn't walking away from this
>this was your goddamn wife now
>so if he was going to spook you all over the woods for a scheme, you were making sure his ass paid for it
>you were collecting on all those sweet promises
>you were making him take responsibility 
>you asked if he even meant all those pretty words he'd said before
>a trace of guilt washed over his face
>God help you you were getting better at reading his face
>that was the first bit of remorse you'd seen on him
>at least it was a good sign
>he was going to be a good wife
>you nipped at his neck once more and he grasped at your back
>you growled that you'd make an honest man out of him
>he'd take your last name
>live on your land
>make your dinners
>if he was have as sweet as his words he'd have no problem 
>but this whole spell giving him humanity?
>he was forgetting it
>you were turning this on him
>if he had your soul you'd have his
>and every night you were laying him in bed until he had your kid
>"I'm… a man."
>you weren't listening 
>you had had enough of schemes 
>this fox had seduced you and you weren't letting him off easy
>your cock throbbed inside him and he was keenly aware of your intentions
>before the grace of God you were going to win against this witch
>you'd come into this thinking you were damned and now you were set on fulfilling your oaths as a married couple
>didn't matter if it was in a church or a cave
>in fact, Füchsin was getting pulled into a church
>you'd do this formally
>he was wearing garters and they were staying on
>against his earlier protests you started breeding him again
>his body was getting used to yours and soon he was moaning again
>his claws raked over your clothed back
>when you broke the skin on his shoulder he screamed and shot another load
>after all he could do was gasp out to God
>the smug merchant fox had vanished
>in his place your partner was whimpering and panting as you renewed your assault on his most vulnerable spot
>you were going to tame Füchsin 
>those words he said were going to mean something
>every thrust was enough to make him tremble 
>you were going to make this ring mean something
>even if it was a curse you would flip it around
>the fox witch clearly wasn't expecting you to go on the offensive 
>his attitude wavered in the face of your passion and he became submissive 
>you made him promise to do everything he said 
>you were going to hold him at that
>your thrusts were relentless 
>you demanded he say he loved you 
>declare it
>he was taken aback but you wouldn't budge
>he needed to say it if he wanted more
>you even slowed then stopped
>"that's… not fair"
>neither was getting scared through the woods or fake poisoned 
>you wanted those words
>you wanted to make sure he kept his word
>he whined when he realized he wouldn't get what he wanted 
>"fine, fine. I love you. that work?"
>not so fast
>you needed him to mean it
>he finally sincerely said those three little words
>and you replied in kind
>after everything that happened you wanted this to be right
>to work
>it was strange and deviant but you hoped in the eyes of God you looked like you were right
>all that sweet possibility would be yours
>you'd lost count of how many loads you'd pumped into the fox witch over the night
>you never pulled out
>just a blur in your memory 
>by the end your previous climaxes were getting fucked out of him
>whatever drug he'd fed you had done its work
>your shirt and back were clawed up 
>Füchsin's own seed had made a mess between you
>you two had mated nonstop like animals
>you could get used to him underneath you like that
>after one too many climaxes you passed out, pinning him in the bed
>you woke up to a tongue licking at your face
>any possibility of all last night being a dream was dismissed when you gazed into those eyes
>"you make for a good blanket."
>his soft paw ran over the cheek he hadn't kissed
>"it didn't go the way I thought but I meant what I said last night."
>your mind went to last night and your morning wood twitched inside your wife's foxhole
>he groaned
>you started up again 
>rutting into the tender hole offered to you
>his softly giggled as you regained steam
>"if you don't mind a male fox as yours then maybe I should be happier to be me"
>you took him as yours
>every slow thrust got a reaction from him
>"fill me up, love. it's so chilly out. I need your warmth."
>he had seemed to return to his affectionate doting tone
>you used him like a heat source too 
>this time you decided to do something a little different 
>he yelped when you picked him up 
>but his tail weakly wagged
>he was pressed against the cave wall and you slowly pumped into him
>you enjoyed his company 
>though you'd eventually want to learn more about Füchsin than the warm tailhole you'd almost took permanent residence in
>it was his fault for mentioning last night and being clenched around you
>"how about we clean up after this. then I'll make you breakfast before you head back."
>we head back, you corrected him
>you deposited one last load in him and pulled out
>spent did not begin to cover how you felt
>you probably poured a week's worth of energy into the fox 
>he was just as exhausted
>you didn't even humor his walking and you cradled him in your arms
>the gesture shocked him
>"even after everything you still act like a gentleman"
>he leaned against you
>you noticed activity outside the cave and the stickmen were collecting water in a wash tub
>so he had the foresight to have that happening 
>it was heated by a slow fire
>married life didn't seem too bad

>he offered the bath first and you weren't fighting that
>the warm water felt cleansing after all this
>Füchsin presented you the strangest bar of soap
>smelled of spices
>well, might as well
>you cleaned up without much thought
>a bath was a welcome change 
>the dirt scrubbed off easily and then you noticed the fox looming over you with a knife raised to the air
>he laughed when you panicked and floundered out of the tub
>you weren't becoming soup goddammit
>"relax relax. I was cutting up breakfast and couldn't resist"
>you scowled and he kept laughing
>just what did he get from spooking you?
>"I get bored. you spend a long time in the woods by yourself and it skews your sense of humor"
>you eyed him waving around the knife
>"so next time I'll make sure you aren't naked. deal?"
>you hadn't even considered there was a difference 
>he shrugged and went back into the cave grinning
>the sadist
>well you didn't want the bath to go to waste and finished cleaning off
>it felt weird to realize how different everything became after a night
>while you still didn't exactly completely trust the witch, you were willing to try this
>he did look good even in the sun
>so, you'd laid with a beast and a man and a witch
>you'd made peace with that
>but longing for something more had made you optimistic 
>he brought a bowl of gruel out for you and you sat on a tree stump near the tub
>he'd had the effigies bring clean water for the tub and you watched him bent over the fire, poking it to check the embers
>"stares like that and yet you spent half the night locked in a wrestling bout…"
>he shot you a look over his shoulder
>it was devious, just not murderous
>you ate the gruel and realized maybe you should have been wary about food he just hands to you
>but it was energy 
>and didn't taste too bad
>could use butter
>the fox slowly lowered himself into the wooden tub and sighed
>"I needed this. someone mistook my ass for a fortress door and kept battering it."
>he wiggled into the tub and laid back
>he softly laughed
>"I don't quite know if I'm 'bring home to mother material'"
>his smile was soft as his arms rested on the tub rim
>"promise is a promise though," he lifted his paw up to look at his ring finger
>"we'll get that field as productive as you were last night"
>he lounged in the tub for a bit while you ate
>then one of his stickmen came with a long bottle and a brush 
>"care to help?"
>you were curious and set down your empty bowl
>while you had him calm and in your hands you decided to press him for information 
>what did he mean by becoming human?
>he explained as you washed his coat that he wasn't always a witch
>he used to be a plain old familiar working for a witch
>she decided to curse him with this weird half man life instead of just being an adorable little fox 
>he wears her skin
>that made you drop the bar of soap into the tub
>he just casually says that
>so… that woman?
>he let the moment hang there before laughing
>"I skinned her."
>then he punched you in the arm
>"it's a joke. don't need to be so serious all the time"
>his sense of humor was a little strange 
>"she had been long dead after I skinned her."
>you did a double take
>"I didn't say what part I was joking about. some rival witch did it."
>you were reevaluating your choices here and he caught that
>"all the more reason I don't disguise myself around you, right?"
>his paw stroked your face and you calmed down a little
>not enough to forget what he said
>but enough to keep washing him
>you tied yourself to this 
>and that had hushed you a little
>you'd been looking at a dead woman yesterday 
>just trusting Füchsin didn't seem wise
>you washed his crimson coat all over
>when he slapped the soap into the water it was obvious what his intent was
>you were still floored by his revelation and the flirting felt awkward 
>maybe he was attempting to lighten the mood
>but you felt like you'd been gut punched and were recovering from getting the wind knocked out of you
>now he was purposely moving the soap around the water
>playing keepaway with a bar of soap was sort of humiliating but he had the good sense to wrap it up as quickly as he started 
>he grabbed your wrist with his paw and directed your hand down
>"you have to make sure my coat is its best. that is if you really want me to stay like this."
>he hand you handling one of his thighs
>for how small he was it all seemed to be centered on his hip region
>he encouraged you to squeeze and moaned into your ear when you did
>"not quite birthing hips but I'm sure you'll test that, right"
>his distraction was working
>you did say you were going to tame him
>so maybe you just had to put more effort in
>his full luscious read hair was warm against your face
>at least that part of his "costume" was real
>he nuzzled up to your bare neck, licking along it
>you stroked his thigh until something poked your hand
>you knew what it was and you grasped at it immediately 
>he giggled into your neck
>your hand squeezed at the bulb at the base and he arched his back and groaned
>"naughty~"
>his little distraction was working now
>you'd tasted lust before and he knew maybe he could use that to his advantage 
>he was more dangerous than you originally thought
>maybe it was because he was an animal becoming a man, of course his morality wouldn't be like yours
>maybe it really was up to you
>you'd tame him
>you sighed as he cuddled up to your neck
>he stroked your arm in appreciation 
>"I'll have a new shirt for you. no good having you come home to Mutter half naked."
>he nipped at your neck for emphasis 
>you wanted to work out whatever this was
>you came out and asked if he could deliver on the farm
>"I wouldn't let my husband down, now would I?"
>he rubbed his paw under your chin 
>"your family is going to thrive"
>"oh wait," he murmured into your neck, "our family."
>Füchsin panted in your grip
>he definitely took to companionship 
>his manhood throbbed in your hand and he couldn't help himself any more
>your wife decided a slow hand wasn't enough and started thrusting his hips up
>his cock felt burning hot 
>he whined as you matched his pace 
>he grabbed your face and opened his jaws around it
>he shoved his tongue into your mouth in one of his frenzied kisses
>he grasped your head in both paws and threatened to drag you into the bath
>his orgasm hit him hard and he screamed into your mouth as he dirtied the bath water
>when he pulled his mouth away his fluffy chest was heaving
>"would your family miss you if I just stole you away?"
>yes, so he'd better not try it
>"heh, relax. you are tantalizing but I wouldn't hurt you."
>he pulled you close and whispered 
>"you are definitely making the case for me to stay cursed though."
>he rubbed his forehead into your neck and asked you to finish up
>you hurried along his body, taking care to clean his chest and tail fluff
>his hair looked difficult thanks to its volume but you'd manage
>when he dunked his head you had his shampoo handed to you
>these effigies were useful, if unsettling
>you had a little experience taking care of girls before so his hair wasn't too alien
>you asked if he wanted a braid later and he seemed genuinely touched
>one clean fox later, you helped him step out of the tub and dry off
>you brushed his coat after it was dry and he ended up sitting in your lap while you braided his long fiery hair
>you wanted your wife presentable to you family, even if the circumstances couldn't be stranger
>you were shocked how politely he sat in front of you while you did his hair
>it was easy for you by now, with experience you'd gained from raising sisters
>you reflected on just where that experience had taken you
>never would have thought it would end up with you here
>but this was a step in the eight direction 
>that's what you told yourself 
>Füchsin was strange and you should have your guard up
>yet he ended up looking so delicate like this
>he just trusted you 
>when his fair locks were braided he relaxed against you briefly 
>"let's head out. I'm sure we've given them a scare."
>he pushed himself up out of your lap and went to get himself ready
>his costume would definitely take some getting used to 
>so that was a dead woman he was living through
>God
>this deal had better be worth it
>to get your mind off it you asked him some more questions
>he'd mentioned a rival witch
>"yeah, master picked a fight with someone she shouldn't have. the crone gave her a heart attack."
>you skin crawled at the idea something worse lurked out there
>Füchsin seemed harmless by comparison 
>the effigies were to tend to the homestead while the fox brought an armful of gifts
>you initially looked confused but he said he wanted to make a good impression
>you couldn't meet the eyes of his costume but he did have a point
>the new shirt he handed you was a little itchy but it wasn't that bad
>heading back home was much easier when someone wasn't making it difficult 
>your curiosity got the better of you on your walk and you had to ask
>was this rival witch nearby? was there a threat?
>"this was years ago. she probably moved on out of boredom."
>it didn't exactly ease your fears but he had a point
>you'd have run into something like that by now if that witch was still local
>the walk was peaceful 
>"maybe my master didn't mean to curse me. I mean, I thought being this half thing was one."
>you walked along and let him continue 
>"maybe I was just impatient or blind to the benefits."
>he laughed with that last work
>leaving little imagination to what benefits he meant
>"you don't know what being able to just shed this skin around someone means to me. to just be… me. you make me actually want that."
>he reasoned that maybe it wasn't half life after all
>that his envy was unfounded
>the skin wasn't what made one human
>he realized that now
>"what makes one human is that 'soul'"
>this was a surprising 
>you didn't expect this much depth from him after that display last night
>"so, worst case scenario I have yours now."
>that… was a way of looking at it
>you figured that was another jest and let it be
>the walk was relaxing but you couldn't lie and say you weren't happy to see home
>once more a sibling caught sight of you and there was much rejoicing
>you'd worried them and they'd tried searching close to home but thankfully no one really pushed into the woods yet
>you would have felt awful if anyone had went and got lost out there for your sake
>Mutter was a little shocked to see you had company
>but you perked her up by announcing your engagement 
>you had to fib a little
>not an outright lie to say you'd met this "woman" before
>more stretching the truth than anything
>Mutter was happy to see you had finally gotten someone
>before, you'd had issue attracting any marriage material 
>the land you owned wasn't particularly impressive
>plus, your family infamy
>but you'd survived
>and look at where you'd gotten
>you'd finally be able to settle down like your parents
>Mutter hugged you tightly, tears in her eyes
>Füchsin had set his gift basket on the table and witnessed the family reunion with interest
>you saw that look on his face
>well, the old witch face
>still would take getting used to
>but thankfully, he wouldn't be wearing it full time
>trying not to refer to him as him would also a be challenge 
>you'd just have to play that off if you ever did it
>not like anyone would expect it
>you certainly didn't 
>God worked in strange ways
>so why not see this as a blessing?
>his presence was welcomed and not thankfully questioned
>after that day he was a regular guest on the farm
>it was hard to keep up the facade he was a human girl
>it was easier to fall for him though
>his heart slow grew accustomed to your affection
>sure enough, he was true to his word
>the next year's crops came up like weeds
>stronger and more fertile than ever before
>with the next harvest came your end of the bargain
>Füchsin didn't have anyone to walk him down the aisle sadly
>the ceremony was informal but you felt it necessary 
>you said your vows before the town priest
>a lush farm and a beautiful wife
>you were the talk of the town now
>every night or every other night you would head to the woods to indulge yourselves 
>sex before marriage was unwise but you'd already broken so many taboos you'd lost count
>what was another?
>you couldn't lie and say you hadn't been corrupted a little
>and enjoyed the corruption 
>you just hoped God for forgive you two
>you refused to fool around with him while he was in disguise 
>partially for how creepy it was
>but mostly because you wanted the real him
>he began learning more about the soul
>the concept he was chasing
>the whole reason he pushed to get a man
>he was hesitant to do church at first but he appreciated your company
>that and you figured it might help him
>slowly, you both began to comprise
>and ultimately that's what a marriage was
>you had your parent's marriage as a model but they weren't a complete match for obvious reasons
>with the marriage came Füchsin's property becoming co-owned
>so those woods were in your name
>you ended up deciding to leave the family house in the care of your siblings
>the witch cave was only a short walk into the woods and no one could fault you two lovebirds for wanting privacy
>you had an idea for a project too
>with Füchsin's blessing you built an enclosed front onto the cave
>essentially a wood wall, with a shanty roof over head
>you made room for a stove in the future, hopefully the profits from the farm would mean that was possible sooner rather than later
>not pretty but it was within your skillset
>the effigies helped reduce the time and effort
>it was starting to look like a real home
>sort of like that one you saw after you were attacked
>you always wondered about that and asked him once
>he didn't want to play his hand too early then and figured something like that would put you at ease
>doesn't explain why he decided to screw with you but he was strange like that
>the cave was nice but you wanted to have a roof over your heads
>it felt right
>it took a season of building and learning while juggling the farm but you managed something
>you split your attention between the family and your spouse and you were getting good at it
>Füchsin was taking to domestic life
>whereas he originally sought marriage as a solution to his issue, he had grown to enjoy your company
>he even meant it when he said he loved you
>though you'd honestly figured he always did
>maybe living alone in the woods like this had him starved for affection 
>but it felt like when he said it now it was warmer
>you had to avoid the subject when Mutter asked about grandkids
>that would be your brother's responsibility down the line
>another harvest had come
>the help Füchsin offered was amazing
>his craft amplified your own work, experience and knowledge 
>he swore everything you did helped
>even offered his own experience with herbs
>a tiny garden in the woods was different than a wheat harvest but it worked
>with the growing success finally came a suitor for your oldest sister
>after speaking with the boy in depth, you gave your blessing 
>he had a neighboring farm that would become entwined with yours if it all worked out
>more importantly he sounded honest 
>the medicine for Mutter worked
>and the money you saved eventually went into making things in their house easier
>new cooking pots
>new shoes for the kids
>a heap of fresh blankets 
>it was starting to feel like things were working 
>the family thought nothing of you two heading off every night to Füchsin's house
>after all, you needed the independence 
>another successful harvest meant one other thing
>your anniversary 
>the second the door to your home closed Füchsin had stripped the dress and skin
>both were hung with care
>the mystery of that skin you chalked up to magic 
>he was fetching you a snack when you embraced him from behind
>you hoped God would bless this eventually because this felt right
>your doubts over the whole thing had faded
>no matter what happened you would happily live with this
>Füchsin was your wife
>and these rings weren't a curse any more
>you even allowed him into your mind after a fashion, he never pushed the subject though
>times like this you actually took advantage of it
>you flooded your head with an ocean of dirty thoughts, knowing he'd see
>he giggled and grabbed a bottle from a shelf
>he deftly opened the bottle and clawed fingers shoved two tablets into your mouth
>then two into his
>a familiar growing fire burned between you two
>he was definitely going for potency with this batch of pills
>the fox nuzzled up to your touch and fed you a slice of cheese over his shoulder 
>"got to keep your strength up tonight"
>you both ate like this, standing over his counter/work table
>you held him tightly and he'd feed you over his shoulder
>a little awkward but you enjoyed the companionship
>hard to believe you'd wrestled him away from here and he thought you were a means to an end once
>both of you had grown to learn things
>the misery of weathering everything had vanished
>you woke up happy for the routine because you could see the growth
>things had gotten better and you could say the fox man gripped I your arms was responsible 
>you were going to have him take responsibility for something else the second he was done cutting up and giving you an apple
>you loved his smell
>that was always the first thing you to greet you in the morning
>buried in his hair you'd always be aware of it
>he always smelled of all the plants he worked with 
>just this earthy blend 
>always reminded you of your woods
>when he set down the knife and asked if you were satisfied you reached down and picked him up
>he was like a plush toy in your grip
>softer too
>the care you'd put into his coat was paying off
>it had a sheen to it
>since moving the cooking to outside you had enough room for a nicer seat than just the bed
>you set Füchsin down and sat down in the wooden chair 
>the sun had set behind the horizon and the cave was getting darker
>those eyes watched you and you trusted them wholly now
>"I hope you don't plan on working tomorrow," he replied as he slunk down between your legs
>his snout pressed up to your aching dick
>he huffed you through your pants
>a giggle 
>guess he liked your smell too

>hard to think at one point this man terrified you
>over time it just felt natural to think of him as man or wife
>the fox and witch thing felt almost secondary 
>he was just your Füchsin 
>he was beastial, primal
>but you ended up balancing that out
>if he still didn't have a soul he could have yours 
>but over the seasons you'd felt a spark of something was there
>your contemplation was broken up by his tongue lapping at your pants
>he seemed to prefer you when you worked
>said you tasted better
>you didn't see much of a difference but it was nice to be appreciated 
>his ears flicked on his head as your hand went to play with his hair
>even in the darkened cave you could see the hunger in his body language
>the tail wagging helped
>he could never hide that
>claws hooked your waistband and he ever so delicately ripped your pants down and off
>took talent to do that without looking
>because those eyes that originally haunted you were focused on your violent manhood
>through the pants versus his tongue on the bare skin was a world of difference that you could never explain
>the heat of his breath
>the way he pleaded up to you silently
>his beguiling eyes reflecting a hint of mischief along with his desire
>he was naughty
>and you encouraged it
>gripping his hair, you occasionally buried his muzzle into your crotch
>he'd lap at your balls, worshiping them
>he huffed in your scent and you could tell he was stroking himself between your legs
>"I hope you don't mind if your anniversary gift is something you've used before."
>you had a pretty good idea what it was
>you had no complaints 
>you remarked at least then you knew it was the perfect fit
>he giggled as his paw went to lovingly stroke your own gift to him
>"and at least I know I love what you've got me."
>he got coy and rubbed his cheek against the tip
>the herbs he'd given you had your dick angrily throbbing and his warmth felt almost soothing and cool by comparison 
>he teased the shaft with a practiced ease
>his experience with you was paying off
>hard to believe a man could know how to satisfy another this well
>you'd come around to it and never had need of a woman after you met him
>he just was a wife
>a better wife
>you could see his teeth gleam in a sultry smile as he savored you
>the first time he'd gulped you down it had awoken things in you
>hell, before that such acts were unheard of
>such sexual activities counted as sodomy
>he craved you sodomizing him
>secretly, you ended up loving it too
>it was hard to reconcile with your faith 
>both of you knew acts like this counted as sin
>you had learned to ignore such guilt
>you'd waste every drop of your seed in your wife regardless of sin or not
>you heeded no punishment in the face of your growing lusts and passions
>it was a strange and corrupt love and you had to hide its true form
>but when you ended up facing God you'd proudly hold up your wedding band
>this was your life and you'd live it without regrets
>just then he spoke up, breaking the deep concentration you were in
>"you're sweet. I saw that. however, someone worries too much"
>a clawed finger softly rubbed at the underside of your tip
>"no more worrying, please?"
>he turned his face to plant the tip of his muzzle to the tip of your manhood
>he let go of the organ and eyed you
>his mouth open just enough to feel every breath
>you knew what he wanted and he knew you needed it 
>if God really took issue with your choice in wife you didn't mind being wrong
>the blazing red fur started to look ebony with the lack of light
>your wife was a little predator stalking it's prize 
>and with one violent shove down you fed the fox it's hard earned reward
>you grunted as your length disappeared into his muzzle 
>his eyes vanished in the dark 
>he'd shut them as he savored the feel
>his other paw ventured down to his own throbbing manhood judging by the frenzied wet noises 
>his frantically licked at the upside of your shaft as he desperately pleasure himself
>you'd forced all of it into his mouth
>only now did you realize what he had intended
>he wanted you to crave this, of your own free will
>and you did
>doubts melted away as quickly as they had appeared
>he made it very difficult to worry about God
>in fact, that hot mouth threatening to melt you was God now
>that was a blasphemy 
>and you were beyond worrying thanks to him
>Füchsin was so right
>no more worrying
>he moaned around you and you nearly bucked deeper 
>occasionally he took joy in watching you squirm when he nibbled
>just softly enough to grab your attention 
>it's funny to think at one point the threat of that was what ensured your seed shot down his throat the first time back then
>you'd realized pretty quickly he loved that position of submission 
>he loved gagging, though his beastial form didn't allow for it as much
>sometimes you could angle his face and get it deeper
>you fucked him, claimed him
>his body shuddered in your grip as he climaxed
>the whole time he didn't stop trying to please you
>you shot the first seed on the night down his throat
>with that medicine there was no break
>you picked him up and your vision in the dark was good enough to deposit him in your cot
>the nightstand next to the bed and the familiar jar was within reach
>he made an ointment with a minty scent recently and you'd both enjoyed it
>even in the dark you could see him presenting his smooth stomach, submitting to you
>you slathered your tool with one hand while your other hand lost itself in the fluff of his chest
>you felt his chest heave against your palm
>his heart hammered 
>the plush tail between his legs wagged
>it was an intimacy you'd never give up
>whether it was wrong or not was irrelevant 
>this warmth coursing through you met and melded with his
>embers becoming one fire
>a primal sense of belonging
>his eyes watched yours
>a need flared in them
>a look that no doubt matched yours
>you didn't need light to guide your manhood
>it just came naturally 
>it belonged there
>feeling the soft ring of muscle part, you enjoyed the heat as you kept going deeper
>a low whine reverberated in his chest under your hand
>he arched his back just a little
>as feral as this medicine threatened to make you, you could still appreciate him
>this was your wife
>and he was beautiful, burning even in the dark
>when your hips finally met you allowed him to relax with the fullness
>after all, he was going to have you in him all night
>your free hand wrapped around his own manhood and you started squeezing and stroking
>instead of violently mating right away, you wanted to tease him
>hard to believe he scared you at one point
>his claws gripped at the bed as you essentially forced his body to milk your manhood with every clench of his ass
>you whispered his name down to him as he panted 
>the darkness had swallowed your coupling and you kept burning together
>this was right
>this was love
>your strokes and squeezes on his manhood was driving him wild 
>you hadn't budged since lodging yourself as possible in him
>instead focused on working his shaft
>the precum was slick to the touch and seemed to slather his red rod
>a side effect of the drugs did seem to make that supply seem never ending
>sort of helped with the act
>but did leave the bedsheets worst for the wear 
>his expertise had worked well in making the crops better and stronger every year
>your Mutter and even siblings faired better with Füchsin's medicines
>and you personally had never felt this virile before
>not that you needed it for him
>when your cock throbbed deep in him he must have been all close to the edge
>his body twitched as he screamed your name and shot his second load of the night
>not to be outdone you let his orgasm milk your length
>you were close but quickly lost the patience for doing this the teasing way
>you snatched the fox up and pulled him to your chest
>his arms took their natural place around your shoulder and he buried his muzzle in your shoulder
>"you haven't filled me yet," he pleaded
>the pout in his voice was evident
>even after taming your wife he had a mischievous streak
>it made you grin, especially when he giggled at you slapping your hands down on both of his cheeks
>he would get it alright
>he wagged his tail, the fur brushing against your bare arms
>both of you burned like a furnace 
>fire poured over you, like being cloaked in the summer sun
>you would just have to sink into your wife and take care of it
>this anniversary gift was welcome and you hoped to get it next year too
>lift
>then
>SLAM
>lift 
>then 
>SLAM
>you built up a slow, heavy rhythm 
>chugging along like one of those steam engines
>his paws ruffled your hair and he yelped every time you bottomed out in him
>his fur was getting slick with your sweat, the embrace only making you both warmer
>Füchsin absolutely loved when you handled him like this
>you braced your legs to stand better while you worked
>the way his insides clung to you it almost prevented you from actually cumming
>but he pleaded with you to fill his guts and you why not give your wife what he wants
>his ass tight in your grip, you started slamming up to meet him halfway with every thrust
>he clutched to you for dear life and shot another load between your chests
>God you two would need a bath in the morning
>your first time was your fear and anger bubbling up into the surface and violently pounding the witch into orgasms
>with your relationship growing like it has, that time almost felt too dark to reminisce upon
>you'd had fun, sure
>but the negativity tied to it was distant
>now your coupling was beautiful 
>if God really would condemn you for the love you felt as Füchsin's face cuddled against your bare neck so be it
>you'd stand with your back straight and your chin up
>though holy shit you'd have to curb these doses of his concoctions
>the potency was nice but you worried about the toll
>as nice as going out in your wife's embrace sounded you didn't need to traumatize the poor fox with that guilt
>this was just for tonight
>you slammed up into him and it felt like pulses rocking your body as you bred him deep
>each spasm of your muscles threatened to have you tip over you didn't allow it
>rain colliding with the shoddy roof outside mixed with the wet mess of your love making
>you had Füchsin leaned against the wood wall with one leg in the air, presenting himself to you
>you took the offer, having barely left him wanting
>his hole was already a twitching mess and you fed yourself back into it
>you grabbed the back of his head and kissed him best you could
>you never wanted him to be human or a woman
>this was who you shared a bed with
>and that truth was satisfying 
>you couldn't openly flaunt it to your family but like this, you wouldn't change him
>this had all started on false pretenses but now the love was a real physical thing
>you could reach to his chest and he to yours and you knew the other was the reason for its beating
>you'd tamed this oddity of the woods 
>maybe he'd made you a little more wild
>hard to say where one ended and the other began
>especially when locked like this
>and it was a lock
>with both of you heaving and thrusting to meet each other there wasn't a gap between you
>"I want to try something," he gasped out 
>curiosity got the best of you and you stopped mid thrust
>he set his forehead to yours and had you close your eyes 
>for once you could see into his mind
>open as a book
>you saw all the futures he wanted
>how he actually saw himself as happy with this half life now
>how it shot forward decades to both of you gray, his coat like iron now
>hordes of adopted children, acres of land
>all while his body gripped your length like the fox was built for it
>he was driving you mad
>all his promises laid out bare in his mind
>he'd accepted himself so you should to
>you'd both make peace with God if it came to it
>flashes of an apothecary in the woods
>strong livestock
>copious amounts of love making sandwiched between quiet romance 
>winters held up indoors, using each other for warmth
>springs where you'd give the animals competition with your rutting
>his imagination flooded your mind and his heart was opened to you
>he was a book to be fingered through, allowed to be studied
>when he opened his eyes you followed, the connection fading away
>"I wasn't sure that would work. figured it would be easier to paint a picture that way than with words."
>your lips crashed against his muzzle
>the move was clumsy yet appreciated 
>you desired him more than breath
>those futures would be yours, both of yours
>your hips started moving again 
>full nuts slapping together
>even if you couldn't get a child out of him didn't mean you wouldn't quit
>his tight hole was getting painted as much as an actual womb
>after kissing along his jawline you leaned down and buried your face in his chest fluff
>you roared into his fluff as you deposited more ropes into his hungry body
>he was wife, mate
>as some point you just gave way to your instincts 
>no more thinking
>no more worries
>Füchsin and you were animals 
>the drug was really kicking in now 
>you ended up with your bitch on the cave floor
>all fours
>his rear presented to you
>the heat was maddening
>Füchsin was just as drunken as you
>he knew enough through the haze to get what he needed
>wiggling his hips as he sat there in the dark
>you pounced and begun again
>you didn't kept slamming it in
>claiming him
>he howled and yelped and his swinging dick sprayed ejaculate across the cave floor
>that night in a high you'd gone through a rush of emotions, culminating in this wild abandon 
>you remember gripping his tail in one fist while you kept painting his fur and insides with your seed
>the next morning you woke up on top of him, Füchsin feeling like a throw rug squished under you
>he'd unceremoniously collapsed at some point last night and you just kept going
>you rolled off onto the cave and that's when the ache hit all at once
>good fucking lord did that hurt
>you needed water and to never take those pills again
>you wouldn't live to see Füchsin get those silver hairs if you kept that up
>the fox which reached out blindly and when he found you he also expressed regret
>"I don't think I'll walk right for a week."
>he mumbled how it was at least worth it
>you laughed to the roof and asked him to get those little servants to fetch something to drink and eat
>no way in hell could you move
>he was in no better shape
>"happy anniversary, " he mumbled over to you
>you repeated the sentiment 
>his tail weakly wagged
>weary, you enjoyed the light cracking through the wood facade of your home
>the cave reeked of sex more than usual and you'd have to air it out today
>you sighed and wiggled your aching body closer to the red carpet that hissed when he tried moving over to you
>well you hadn't planned on working much today anyways
>your hand rubbed along Füchsin's fur on his back, slowly stroking him
>you chalked all this up to a gift from God
>why not view this as a blessing?
>your future was secure, your family was prosperous, you fields rich
>maybe God worked through deft little claws as well as he worked through your fingers
>content, you waited for sustenance and basked in the warmth of the moment
