>rain trickled down through the forest canopy 
>dusk had come but you could hardly have seen the sun through the clouds
>you'd gone to the next village over for Mutter's medicine 
>unfortunately, the idea of camping in the woods seemed like the better option than trying to outrun the storm
>you knew that meant most likely traveling later in the dark
>you weren't looking forward to that
>however, your family's financial situation meant faster and smoother travel by horseback or wagon was out
>not for quite some time 
>you were born to wheat farmers and your land was not nearly as bountiful as some of the neighboring farms
>sometimes you felt like the land or even your family was cursed
>never able to climb up out of the hole 
>always in debt
>yet your family persevered 
>some stubbornness born from years of suffering
>men in your family had to push
>what choice did they have?
>this of course, meant the one horse on your farm was an ancient plow horse
>working Gunther much harder would put him at risk
>so any journey had to be on foot
>generations of toil leading to you huddled under a pine tree
>life didn't seem fair
>raindrops intensified their assault, filling the woods with new noise 
>you took in the scenery and relaxed
>why not appreciate the little things if you were trapped
>you were trapped in this life just as much as you were trapped under this tree

>you watched as any remaining sunlight vanished, swallowed by the blackness 
>the clouds prevented the stars from truly shining overhead but occasionally you'd get glimpses of the moon
>the silver would try to slice through the storm
>but the rain wasn't giving up without a fight
>leaving you stuck
>getting pneumonia while trying to treat your mother's illness wouldn't be smart
>Mutter needed you more than ever since Vater passed away
>his heart couldn't take all the stress eventually
>found him face down one day in the chicken coop
>since then you'd been responsible 
>the weight of your farm, no your entire family, hinged on you
>your siblings did what they could
>hell, they were the only reason you had felt confident enough grabbing the medicine 
>this trek was a long time to be away from the farm
>weather just made it longer
>you hoped they were alright
>you felt the weight of the tiny satchel of herbs
>they were supposed to treat her cough
>she'd been getting worse
>you could see it even if your younger siblings couldn't 
>Mutter even tried downplaying it
>she put on a brave face
>so you would too
>you'd just have to persevere like you always had
>fight uphill
>fight on and on and on
>that killed your father
>but responsibility was a cage one forges for himself
>if not you'd be no better than an animal
>what pulled you out of you melancholic musings was a noise you could make over the sound of rain
>it sounded like someone running
>this late in the evening?
>your mind went to the worst case scenario of someone accosted by highwaymen
>that was a bit outlandish and perhaps whimsical 
>you still drew the knife you had on you for self defense 
>your eyes and ears trying to pick out the movement
>sounded like a lot of running
>even with the knife you weren't ready to blindly charge into the dark sea of trees
>a romantic day dream was not a good reason to get mauled by a bear
>you couldn't place the number of footsteps but it sounded chaotic 
>finally you could hear ragged breath
>it sounded female
>more footsteps behind
>was it a woman being chased after all?
>you debated
>maybe it wasn't any of your business
>when you heard a scream you decided to take action
>you bolted towards the noise, knife drawn
>almost tripping over a tree root on the way, you intercepted the chase
>some peasant girl being chased by wild dogs
>you wish you had something more substantial than a knife but tackled and stabbed a distracted dog regardless 
>you yelled to the girl to climb the nearest tree while you bought time for her
>chivalry wasn't a strong suit of yours but you'd seen your sheep beset by these animals
>that's no way for someone to die
>after the first hound was downed the other two became cautious 
>they growled and bared their teeth
>you didn't have the element of surprise on your side but it at least sounded like the girl got to safety 
>your knife arm was pulled in
>your other stretched out in front of you
>you had no chance in a straight fight with them
>they were massive dogs
>however, you knew their instinct would have them lunge and try to pull you down
>sacrifice your arm or hand to get at one of their stomachs and necks
>this whole thing had been reckless but knowing what you know now you wouldn't have turned away
>it was a game
>you needed them to make the first move
>they needed you to do the same
>one of you had to blink and the one on the right got impatient 
>pain burned through your forearm as teeth clamped down 
>but you had your opening and violently stabbed the mutt to death as you fought through the pain
>it had a good deep grip on your arm and your white sleeve was now a mess of crimson
>pain and rage fueled your stabs and you were just as stubborn as this beast
>you used the flailing legs of the damned thing to keep its friend at bay, swinging the animal like a club best you could
>the other dog all of a sudden reconsidered it's options when it's companion let go of your arm
>a dozen stab wounds would have put anything that size down and thankfully it finally realized it was dead by number twelve
>you were in bad shape though
>not down but that was about your one viable strategy and you really didn't want to repeat that trick
>still, in your weakened state it could have gone for your throat
>it didn't, choosing discretion over another attack
>you were feeling a little shaky and the bleeding felt like it wouldn't stop
>goddamn that was stupid
>that was your last thought before you fell over and blacked out
>you had no idea what happened but you woke up in what looked like a cave
>some sort of bleak, damp hole in the ground
>your arm was bandaged
>you still felt weak
>the mildew smell was strong
>a dog bite putting you down would have been pathetic 
>you still needed to take care of…
>in a panic you sat up and fumbled around for your bag
>the medicine 
>where was the medicine?
>you looked around the cave in a panic
>you noticed two eyes in the dark opening of the cave staring into your soul
>in a panic you sat up and fumbled around for your bag
>the medicine 
>where was the medicine?
>you looked around the cave in a panic
>but
>this wasn't a cave
>you were lying on a small bed in a tiny room
>it wasn't even dark out
>soft morning light trickled in through the window in the door
>the bag was on a table near the bed along with some of your other belongings
>your arm was bandaged
>all that panic over a nightmare
>you sighed and pushed up off the bed
>the room wasn't familiar 
>still, you couldn't waste time when your family was worrying about you
>no telling how late in the day it was
>last thing you needed was Mutter thinking a bandit have slit your throat
>you felt rude leaving 
>whoever tended to you had saved you
>you had a feeling that girl was involved
>as rude as it was maybe you'd see them again
>you snatched your coin purse, knife and the herbs off the table
>ignoring the pang of hunger, you headed out the door
>a voice stopped you
>"so the gallant hero makes off without a word?"
>you turned to see a crone watching you from a chair near the door
>but you didn't see her when you walked out
>perhaps in the rush you didn't pay attention 
>but you could have sworn the area around the door was vacant a moment ago
>she had peasant garb
>not quite matching the girl from last night
>there was no way this woman could have climbed a tree either
>she looked like a stiff breeze could have knocked her over
>you apologized 
>but you had to get going
>the old woman didn't seem offended
>instead asking what the hurry was for
>you had to be honest 
>your farm was first and foremost on your mind
>she apologized for keeping you and remarked she understood 
>"family is important after all," she mused as she rubbed her chin
>on that note you excused yourself 
>you set off into the woods
>the problem was, as you realized quickly, you didn't know what part of the woods you were in
>you had lived around here for years and never heard of an old woman out in the woods
>when you got back home you'd have to ask Mutter
>she'd maybe have an answer
>your arm ached a little but thankfully it seemed like nothing serious
>that story was going to be hard to tell
>trekking deeper into the trees, you finally came up upon a dirt road
>that stretch looked familiar and you used the sun to set your direction
>your rescue last night was a distant thought aside from that reminder
>it all seemed to work out in the end
>no idea what that whole situation was
>when you finally left the forest and saw your land, your heart soared 
>your family had been worried sick
>so you coming home mostly intact was met with joy
>as was the treatment for Mutter's illness
>when you described what happened and your experience with the old woman your mother didn't seem to have an answer
>she helped clean and cover the wound again
>it would be a liability with doing work today
>thankfully, nothing strenuous today
>most of the harder chores had been done by your siblings
>something that made you really appreciate them
>there was just tending to the chickens 
>by comparison that chore was almost relaxing
>you enjoyed the solitude with the animals
>though something didn't sit right
>when you got out to the coop you felt like eyes were on you
>but there was just the field and you saw nothing out there
>the wheat had been harvested so there was nowhere to hide
>but you couldn't just shrug off the paranoia you felt
>you couldn't shake the feeling you were watched
>just didn't know where
>you tried not to let whoever know though
>just had to pretend you hadn't noticed
>maybe they'd go away 
>but letting them know you noticed seemed like a bad idea 
>you fed the chickens while giving the woods a side glance occasionally 
>you never felt this way out in the fields before
>once you got the chickens taken care of you were called back to the house
>lunch was ready and good thing too
>you'd went all this time since you'd woken up without a meal
>dumpling soup and beer
>it was filling and warm
>the littlest sister in your family had become adept at dumpling making
>she found it fun
>Emma beamed with pride that you liked her soup
>your siblings ranged I ages from Emma's five to Anna being only a couple years younger than you
>with a few brothers stuck in the middle
>you were man of the house by process of elimination
>the afternoon was easier
>with the harvest done there was little to tend to with the crops
>the cow and sheep had been cared for
>a chill had come in over the mountains to the east
>Mutter insisted you not push yourself too hard
>so you took it easy but not without debate
>at least you could patrol the perimeter of the farm a little
>your Vater had a shotgun he'd used for hunting that you cherished 
>you didn't take it out into the woods because you wanted your family to have something
>you had the gun resting on your shoulder and walked the field, checking the fences
>confidence had returned to you with the firearm in hand
>the unwelcome gaze seemed to have vanished 
>you didn't see anything out of the ordinary and you decided to head back in before it got dark again
>night came and you all had a light supper before bed
>even if you had to share it with your brothers, your bed was a welcome comfort 
>the next two weeks were the routine you'd settled into
>Mutter's medicine was getting low again
>you knew that meant another trek through the woods
>thankfully your arm was feeling much better
>the temptation to bring the gun was there
>but you declined
>you'd just make sure you weren't caught in rain or dark
>you set out at sunrise on a Tuesday 
>crumbs and a razor thin slice of cheese washed down with beer was your morning meal and you'd set out before the rest of the family woke up
>the sun was just cracking up over the horizon
>the apothecary wouldn't be that long a trip if you hurried
>no sight seeing
>just point A to point B
>however, halfway through the woods that same feeling of paranoia returned
>your hair stood up on your neck but you tried not to let it show like that time with the chickens 
>the routine of the past weeks had almost put you at ease and made you forget that experience 
>it was still dawn and your eyes caught nothing out of the ordinary in the light
>you did pick up the pace and held your hand over the handle of your knife
>the birds had quieted down
>all you could hear was the breeze through the branches
>had to speed up
>but not a full sprint
>you didn't want to look like prey to whatever was out there
>thankfully, you made good time and got the herbs before noon
>you dreaded going back through the woods but you couldn't delay
>when you entered to woods you felt comfortable 
>that feeling vanished the second you saw something in the middle of the walking path
>it was a strange effigy made of sticks
>barely came up to your knee
>just planted in the middle of the path
>you didn't see it leaving the farm
>meaning 
>someone really had been watching you
>it wasn't just paranoia speaking
>you moved gingerly around the stickman
>you didn't feel eyes on you but you didn't like any of this
>maybe you needed another path to that medicine in the future
>further along
>another stickman 
>then another
>they grew more frequent as you headed back to the farm
>and you were growing concerned
>whoever was doing this was hanging around your house
>it couldn't be that old lady could it?
>you didn't like this thought whatsoever 
>emerging from the woods, you saw one last stickman with something tied to its neck
>against your better judgment you took it
>it was an orange bag
>looking inside, you saw some sort of herbs
>what was the meaning of this?
>you fumbled with the bag before someone shouted from the farm
>your family realized you were home
>you stood in front of the effigy and blocked it from view
>no need to bring up questions from the family and make them worry more
>tonight you'd patrol the perimeter 
>checking the fences
>well that's what you'd tell everyone
>once your brother went back to his chore you uprooted the stickman and tossed it into the woods
>you hadn't the faintest clue what all that meant but you didn't appreciate the prank
>Mutter had her medicine 
>that's all that mattered
>the rest of the day turned into routine
>the chickens produced a lot of eggs today
>that night you slipped out with a lantern and the shotgun
>you lied and said you needed some night air and you'd be back shortly
>it was probably stupid to go out in the dark
>but it felt like the best chance to catch whatever this was off guard
>you paused when you rounded the house and saw another effigy 
>right next to the porch and everything
>clearly, someone thought this was a jest
>you didn't think it was funny
>you snatched up the effigy and went to toss it into the woods 
>when you chucked it into the brush something rustled out there
>you swung the barrels and discharged into the woods
>you didn't know if you hit anything but you reasoned you needed to get the Hell back inside now
>that scare meant you'd need to reload 
>hopefully whatever was out there didn't realize that as you backed up
>Anna was peeking out the door 
>she was quiet but it was clear that shot had been heard
>you tried to compose yourself and lied
>you'd seen a fox around the chickens
>they seemed to buy it
>you didn't tell anyone about the eyes shining in the treeline right before heading back in
>you'd locked up the house and tried to settle into sleep
>you had to put up a strong act
>otherwise you'd worry the family
>the shotgun was reloaded and placed above the fireplace 
>you decided tonight to sleep near it, on the couch facing the slowly crackling fire
>perhaps the stress had gotten to you though, for as soon as you got to rest you began to be plagued by dreams
>vivid ones
>it began with a weight on you, pressing you into the couch
>you couldn't pick out what was causing it
>just that it was heavy enough to pin you
>the room was just as you left it when you dozed off
>just with a fog hanging over your mind
>it was like something was there
>but you couldn't tell specifically 
>the weight was memorable though
>the weight moved over you
>in particular your crotch kept getting attention 
>rubbed over and over
>when you woke up you realized it was still dark out and you then realized you'd ejaculated in your pants
>was the dream that good?
>you tried to ignore the sinful act
>trying to go to bed again had the dream start over
>something over you and your crotch was rubbed against
>whispers picked up around you
>a feminine voice, unfamiliar to you, murmuring all around you
>the shape pinning you
>the voice
>it was just vague that you knew it was someone but you couldn't make it out
>this was so frustrating 
>what was this
>without warning you found yourself out in the woods in the dark
>a mouth pushed against yours and forced a hot liquid down your throat
>the hot liquid instantly spread heat through your body
>the rubbing intensified 
>the darkness overwhelmed you
>when you woke up again, you saw eyes outside the window before the shape fled from the scene

>you had no idea what was going on
>all this couldn't be mere coincidence 
>the rest of the night you stayed up and tended to the fireplace
>you tried to ignore everything, hoping it would just go away
>there was no explanation for all of this other than perhaps witchcraft
>maybe that was the source of all this
>though you didn't know what witchcraft really was
>you tried not to think about it
>thinking about it might attract more of it
>telling your family seemed like a bad idea
>you didn't want them worrying
>it was just more responsibility to shoulder
>you could weather it
>asking your town priest seemed like a good idea
>although, he might accuse you 
>you'd have to figure it out
>whoever this was was getting bolder
>that shape at the window bothered you
>was it tied to the dream?
>had to be
>why did that dream make you feel that way?
>the next morning you were still up, making some excuse about your stomach to Mutter
>she offered more bread for breakfast as a way to calm it 
>but you felt guilty about lying to begin with
>whatever devilry going on in those woods couldn't be allowed to come into the home
>you noticed a pattern of calm after your trips out there
>it only picked up on your trips for the medicine 
>then whatever it was tended to leave you alone for a while
>at least that was the theory
>that meant heading out for more medicine was unfortunate 
>but needed
>whatever was out there had you between a rock and a hard place
>you needed to cut through the forest as the fastest route
>this time, you would come ready
>it felt ridiculous and selfish taking the shotgun with you
>but you wanted the insurance and whatever it was seemed only interested in you
>so you hinged on that bet, hoping you'd only have to worry about yourself 
>it didn't take long on the trip for something to happen this time
>a fork off the usual walking path that was never there before
>you'd like to think you knew these woods but whatever this was wasn't here two weeks ago
>one could reason you hadn't been harmed by whatever this was
>that could be a ploy
>it could want your soul, your body being useless to it
>whatever it was it wasn't human
>and you weren't falling for whatever trick it had here
>you avoided the new path and hugged your gun a little tighter as you walked forward
>plus, just because no harm had come to you before didn't mean it couldn't happen
>that night with the dogs had to be the link
>you normally never went out that late
>these forests bordered your fields for generations
>you'd have heard about something in here by now
>the urge to bring it up to Mutter was there
>maybe it was some family secret 
>it was possible
>after about a half hour of walking you made a realization 
>you recognized none of this
>familiar landmarks like a broken tree or a certain rock were nowhere to be seen
>this path was completely alien
>it was impossible 
>it should be the regular path
>you ignored the intersection then carried on and…
>if whatever was out here did the branch in the first place what could stop it from changing other things?
>you turned and went to run back the way you came only to see the path now led to a cabin
>not unlike that old woman's, but just different enough
>when you turned to go away from the cabin you saw… the cabin
>the door opened on its own
>this had to be some devil's work
>you didn't want to be here but you seemed trapped 
>but playing this game seemed like a bad idea
>yet you were offered no other choice
>you were trapped out here
>dammit
>you turned to look and sure enough the only sight you had before you was a cabin with an open door
>to your left
>cabin
>right
>cabin
>no matter where you stood you were presented an open door
>it was not a choice
>so what you decided was instead of fulfilling the whims so some forest demon… you'd sit down
>whatever game it wanted you to play you weren't participating 
>you couldn't see into the house all that well 
>and you weren't curious enough to peek
>that's how you'd die
>trying to crawl close enough to look inside
>it was wanting you to be impatient
>but you weren't doing this
>whatever this was
>the air felt strange 
>as if the whole situation wasn't strange
>but there was the strange sweet smell 
>coming from the doorway
>no
>in fact, you aimed the gun towards the open doorway now
>"what are you doing?"
>the feminine voice behind you was calm but wasn't exactly calming
>you fumbled with the gun and nearly misfired it into the cabin in front of you
>you'd leapt to your feet and stumbled around
>a young woman in peasant clothes
>hair red as the sunrise
>you tried not to look at her ample exposed chest
>she looked you over and you looked past her
>more importantly than whoever this was you saw a way out
>you shoved past and ran down the dirt road, not even sparing a look over your shoulder
>you wanted no part of this 
>when you couldn't breath only then did you stop
>your lungs feeling like they were on fire
>when you finally regained your strength you made a terrible discovery
>the sun was going downcast the horizon
>you knew you set out in the morning
>the trip shouldn't have taken that long
>at this rate the forest couldn't be trusted
>it wasn't yours and you had become very aware of that
>you had little time to mull over things when the sun just vanished over the hills
>faster than it should
>cackling 
>you remembered that drifting through the woods and couldn't explain just where it came from
>so in a scene very familiar to you now, you took shelter under a tree
>whatever was going on, you were in its clutches
>you set the shotgun down on your lap
>this wasn't your finest hour
>you'd manage a way out of this though
>you had to
>the laughing grew in intensity and you were on edge now
>it was that damn dog incident
>that was the start of all this
>that peasant girl was tied to all this 
>trying to look cute and harmless with her cleavage out
>you did one good deed and this is what it got you
>when the laughing stopped you relaxed a little
>then whispering picked up
>a myriad of voice formed a sort of quiet chorus
>the shotgun was the only thing giving you any confidence now
>even that you had your doubts on how effective it would be
>your mind was racing
>whatever demons were out there were intent on you
>but you needed the farm
>you needed your family
>you tried hard to think of them
>you'd see them again
>this thing would not claim you
>you fell back on prayer
>while not the most devout, it brought you comfort
>blocking out everything, shutting you eyes tight
>when the whispers were replaced by birdsong only then did you peek
>the sun was out again, in fact it really hadn't moved much since morning
>was the whole thing an illusion?
