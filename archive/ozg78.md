The Mari Vaccine

>’’It’s not as scary as you think. You can trust me! We have tested it thoroughly and it’s being used in hospitals and clinics all around the country. Once you take it in you will feel a lot better! It won’t hurt a bit I promise.’’ 
>You look into the eyes of the nurse named Mari holding your arm who was about to put the needle inside your arm until you stopped her
>Goddammit you can’t say no to someone so cute 
>’’A-Alright. I just want the headaches gone anyways.’’ 
>She smiles and grabs the syringe again with one hand as the other prepares your arm 
>’’Ok now, deep breaths in and out.’’ 
>You do as your told and before you notice the needle is piercing your arm and the liquid is flowing in 
>It hurts a bit as it normally does but soon it’s gone 
>’’See? It wasn’t that bad right?’’ she says as she rubs your arm 
>’’Y-Yeah although’’ you try to speak and stand up but you feel a bit dizzy and can’t find your footing to stand up so you fall into the chair again ‘’ I feel a bit dizzy. Is it a side effect of the vaccine?’’ 
>She nods and tells you that it will just last for a bit so you can rest at the bed for now
>She offers her hand to help you get up 
>You take her hand and you feel her tug you slightly towards the bed
>Your mind and vision get foggier as you walk towards the bed 
>’’Wow, I didn’t expect it to have such an effect on you but don’t worry. I will take care of you until it passes. I can’t let you walk out like that now can I?’’ you hear her say but just barely 
>As she helps you lay down in the bed you feel sleepy and start losing consciousness 
>’’Don’t you worry about anything. I will get you fixed up soon.’’
>As you lose consciousness completely you feel a hand going under your shirt and a small glint of a smile on her face 



>You wake up and get blinded for a sec as you look at the bright and white lights on the ceiling 
>You are still in the bed but feel a bit better now 
>Mari sees you wake up and stops whatever it is she was doing and starts walking towards you
>’’Did you sleep well sleepyhead?’’ she asks while tilting her head a bit with a slight smile 
>’’Urgh, I guess? I feel a bit better. How long was I sleeping?’’
>’’Hmm, I would say around an hour. I hope you didn’t have a date planned for after you got out of the hospital or something.’’ She giggles a bit at her own joke 
>’’Not really, well I should get going home anyways. Thanks a lot, Mari.’’ you say as you feel your body move by itself and hug her
>You quickly pull yourself back when you realize what you did 
>’’I-I uh sorry about that. I don’t know what came over me. I’m very sorry.’’ you stammer out quickly trying to explain yourself but she only gives you that smug look again 
>’’Don’t you worry about that. I know I can be quite cute! Well then, take care now will you?’’ 
>You just nod hastily trying to go towards the door trying to escape the embarrassment you feel for hugging someone you don’t know 
>Before you open the door Mari stops you 
>’’Wait a moment, please. I got something for you! For being so brave and not crying when the needle went in.’’ she says as she hands you a piece of candy while winking at you 
>You just feel even more embarrassed now due to being treated like an infant 
>’’T-thanks Mari.’’ you say as you exit the office quickly to avoid your face becoming a tomato
>As you get out of the clinic and get into your car you feel like opening up the candy 
>It’s watermelon flavored so that’s nice 
>You drive home and can’t stop thinking about her for some reason 
>From her long black hair, to her purple uniform, to the way she held your hand, how she smelled
>You shake your head as you try to remove those thoughts from your head 
>It’s stupid to think that way of someone you just met and worst of all of a nurse! She was just doing her job 
>As you reach home and park your car outside you feel the headache come back but it’s quickly opaqued by more thoughts of about her
>’’Maybe I should go see her again soon...’’ you mutter to yourself as you open the door to your house
