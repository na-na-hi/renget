"Have you seen that new piece of ass, LocaLoca? I don't know what she's teaching, but I wouldn't mind taking a couple of lessons from her, if you know what I mean." 

"That's hardly appropriate, Majestic. Have some class, you're a top hero for God's sake."

"Not like it's hurting anyone. God, she could blow my bubble anytime." 

"Are you asking to be reported, you asshole? I'm a second away from kicking your ass." 

"Just imagine getting a hardbody like her in bed. Forcing her down and - Alright, fine, fine, I can tell you don't want to talk about this. Fuckin' killjoy. Got any topics of conversation that you won't complain about? I'd like for my lunch to not be spent in silence." 

"... That Rescue Ray guy has been doing some good work lately. Saw him on the news." 

"Yeah. I never liked the guy."

"Why's that?" 

"Well for one, there was that whole Sunshine thing." 

"Sunshine thing?"

"Yeah, Sunshine thing."

"I have no idea what you're talking about." 

"Well, for one thing, I think he was probably a closet homosexual and pedophile and who did a lot of cocaine. That whole Sunshine thing."

"Huh." 

"Yeah." 

"You know, you talk a whole lot about women. Why don't you just settle down?" 

"Can't take the time off of work." 

"Makes sense. But what if you met someone, someone who really clicked with you, great personality, does the things you loved. Would you settle down?" 

"Great personality, are you hearing yourself? A good personality consists of a chick with a little hard body, who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things, and who essentially will keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. The only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or talented, though god knows what the fuck that means, are ugly chicks. But let's say, hypothetically, I met one who was smart, and maybe funny, and halfway intelligent or talented, maybe a little heroic herself, I'd probably settle down." 

"Hm."

"Christ, this is some good coffee. Gotta go to this place more often. Saw one of the kids going here, thought I'd check it out."

"Don't like coffee much."

"Your loss." 

"...Hey, look, you see Conman over there?" 

"Yeah, new guy. He's teaching math or something. Rosethorn's giving him a little while to settle in, lucky bastard." 

"Fuckin' degenerate is more like it. You know he mistook me for a janitor? How does that make any damn sense? I'm on cereal boxes, damnit. Shoulda kicked his ass for that." 

"Not worth it. Though he does feel slimy, I'll admit it."

"Huh, I might be late for class. Well, not like those snotnosed brats really care." 

"Yeah, I'm - "

"On a lot of lithium? Just kidding. Anyways, see you later, Masanori. Dinner?" 

"Yeah. I'll make reservations."
