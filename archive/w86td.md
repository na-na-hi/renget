Kate X Dream Sunny

A vibrant purple sky, teal grass, quaint little buildings strewn around. Here she was again. For the past few weeks, Kate found this particular setting often in her dreams. She wasn't sure why, nor did she care to find out. She wasn't there for that.

She was here, for a particular someone she had grown rather attached to in the prior months. After a bit of searching in the 'Town' Square, she finds him. A short boy, dressed in khaki shorts with a white collared shirt. He has a tint of purple, much like everything in this place had.

"There you are, Sunny!" Kate said. "Why don't we go somewhere more... Out of the way? Less crowded. How's that sound." "Sure! I'd love to go with you!" Sunny replies.

The duo head out of the Town Square, towards a lake-side shed. "This place is so cool! I've never seen this before!" Sunny exclaims. "Yeah, this place is cool and all, but I have a favor to ask you."

"May you strip?" Kate asks him. "Strip? What's that mean?" "It's a fancy way of saying take off your clothes." "Oh, ok." Sunny says. Sunny proceeds to strip down to his unmentionables. 

Kate, seeing Sunny in such a state of undress, is overwhelmed with primal lust and lunges at him. "Kate, what is thi-" Kate interrupts him with a passionate kiss on the lips. She then tears off Sunny's underwear. 

Sunny is like a deer in headlights, trying to process what is happening to him. Kate hastily removes her bottoms so that the real fun can begin. Kate pins Sunny down, and starts grinding on him.

"Doesn't that feel good, Sunny?" She doesn't get an answer. Sunny's member starts pitching up. "Mmmm... Perfect!" Kate squeals. She gets on top of Sunny's member and inserts it. 

Kate feels a wave of ecstasy flow through her. "I feel weird down there...." Sunny says. "That's how it's supposed to feel. You'll get used to it." Kate responds. She slowly moves up and down, causing Sunny's member to twitch.

Kate speeds up her bouncing, bringing her closer and closer to the edge. "Hold on, Sunny, Im almo-"

*THUD*

Kate falls on the bedroom floor. "Ow. And just when it was getting good..." Kate wanders over to the fridge and makes herself a bowl of stew. The stew doesn't taste as good as it used to be. Things...

Things were better when Sunny was still here. Kate knows this all too well. She thinks to herself, "Why God? Why'd you have to take Sunny away from me?"
