#Azure Days

#####Nov 5, 21xx
***
***
Inigo tapped his drumsticks idly against his thigh as he gazed out the band room window. His dragon, Gigan, floated lazily above him. Late afternoon sunlight filtered through the clouds, bathing the music stands and instruments in a gentle golden glow. His classmates were trickling in and out, chatting excitedly about ideas for their Culture Festival performance.

The class had chosen several performances for the festival and they'd been busy practicing all week. The main performance was going to be a team effort from class 1-D. He looks through the list they made.
!!! info
	Sandatsu, Yui, Orochi, Hailey, and Chihiro would perform as their class' **Dance team**.
	Inigo, Imai, Sally, Ashleigh, and Hoge would be the **Band team**.
	Noah, Hifumi, Bobby, Christopher, Kaylee, and the rest would support them with their quirks as the **Stage team** and wow the crowd.

It was their chance to lift the mood of the semester and make everyone forget about the events in Nagoya.

 Inigo grinned when he spotted Imai wheeling an electric keyboard into the room, followed closely by his girlfriend Ashleigh carrying an electric guitar.

"Imai, my man!" Inigo called out cheerfully. "Bout' time you got here. Is that the new synth?"

Imai nodded, a faint smile touching his normally stoic face. "Yes, my mother purchased it as an early birthday present when she heard I would be performing."

"Nice!" Inigo gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up. Behind Imai, Ashleigh waved shyly before occupying herself with tuning her guitar.

Just then, Inigo felt a light tap on his shoulder. He turned to see Hoge standing there, bass guitar case in hand and a music binder tucked under her other arm. His pulse quickened at the sight of her, as it always did these days.

"H-hey Hoge," he stammered, rubbing the back of his neck. "You find the place okay?"

"Yes," she responded briskly, though there was warmth in her eyes. "You did say room 304 in the arts building, correct?"

"Yep! Glad you could make it."

Hoge gave a nod and went about setting up, carefully laying out sheet music on a stand. Before long, Sally had joined them with a guitar as well, she had offered to help out with vocals and arrangements. Sally's singing lessons had done wonders for their group, even Hoge's terrible pitch and volume control had gotten steadily better.

"Alright squad, let's get this jam session started!" Inigo said, twirling his drumsticks.

Sally rolled her eyes. "You're way too excited about this. It's just a practice session."

"Are you kidding me? This'll be the highlight of the whole semester! Plus..." Inigo leaned in conspiratorially. "We could be the first hero-student jazz band to hit the charts! Word through the grapevine is there's gonna be talent scouts." He waggled his eyebrows.

"From where?" Ashleigh piped up, looking bewildered. Inigo just tapped his nose mysteriously.

Truthfully, he had no insider information. But he wanted his friends to feel pumped up. Morale was important!

"Whatever, let's just play already," Sally huffed.

And play they did. As soon as Hoge counted them in, a lively rock melody filled the band room. Inigo grinned as he lost himself in the rhythm, effortlessly pounding out a beat to support the melodic lines of keyboard and guitar. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Hoge's fingers dancing across the fretboard, face scrunched in concentration. Man, she was so cute when she focused! And talented too—she was keeping up with the complex bass line like a pro.

After running through a couple upbeat numbers, Inigo figured it was time to change things up. As Imai noodled idly at the keys, Inigo hopped up from his drum set and grabbed a vinyl record from his bag.

"Alright guys, I've got a special treat! Check this out..." He held up the album reverently. On its worn cover, five Japanese men sporting shaggy 70's haircuts and bell bottoms stared back at them. "It's the band I was talking about the other day."

"Kazemachi ?" Ashleigh asked, reading the cover. "I think my dad has some of their records."

Imai's eyes lit up with recognition. "Ah yes. All the members went on to become well known in the industry after this group disbanded."

"You got it! It's the original album by a folk rock supergroup called Happy End. It's the one that put them on the map." Inigo carefully slid the record from its sleeve and placed it on the turntable. As the crackling guitars and harmonic vocals filled the room, a peaceful nostalgia swept over him. His father used to play this kind of music a lot back when Inigo was small...simpler, happier times.

Inigo rifled through his bag again. "Oh yeah, I almost forgot! I got the sheet music too. Maybe we could try covering one of the songs?"

Sally crossed her arms, looking skeptical. "I don't know...think we can pull off that folky vibe?"

"Sure we can!" Inigo encouraged. "C'mon, it'll be good practice. Expand our musical horizons and all that."

After a bit more cajoling, his bandmates reluctantly agreed to give it a try. Luckily the chord progressions and rhythms weren't too ornate. Before long, they were jamming along in a passable imitation of the original recording. 

>>Happy End: 抱きしめたい - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZQQlzCqqNs&t=1s

Okay, so maybe the keyboard synth didn't quite capture the earthy tones of traditional Japanese instruments, and Inigo's vocals differed starkly from the lead singer's gritty tenor. But they infused the song with their own youthful energy, having fun testing their skills.

Inigo grinned as he pounded out the driving drum beat. Glimpsing Hoge swaying gently to the nostalgic melody stirred fond feelings within him. Maybe they didn't sound polished, but what mattered was the joy of making music together.

As the sky outside gradually darkened to evening azure, the band wrapped up an final playthrough and set down their instruments, faces flushed.

"Great job everyone!" Inigo cheered. "I think we're gonna blow them away at the Culture Fest. You cats excited to show off our cool vibes in front of an audience?"

Imai smirked. "Yeah, you just better not choke when you see the talent scouts you were going on about."

"Wouldn't dream of it!" Inigo assured cockily. Though honestly, even if it had just been their classmates in the audience, he would've given it his all. This performance was special. He adjusted his music sheet and snickered.

"Sorry, I couldn't keep up," Ashleigh stammered.

"Yo Ashleigh, you were laying it down like Eddie Lang in the pocket, real-deal stuff."

Imai shot him a wink and turned to Ashleigh too. "I dig. Remember, there ain't no clams in jazz, just unexpected riffs."

Ashleigh tensed, "W-what are they talking about?"

Sally narrowed her eyes, "They've both gone insane. Too much band practice."

Hoge blinked twice, "I believe they're pretending to be 20th century jazz artists."

"Loosen up, kitten, we're just translating the vibe into the language of the masters. You gotta speak jazz, ya dig? Your bass was like Mingus on a righteous groove, steady as a heartbeat," Inigo shot Hoge fingerguns.

"Yeah. Don't be square. We're channeling the spirit of the cats who blew their horns and banged their skins before us. Helps the notes flow like a river of sweet bourbon. Let the music take you on a trip, man." Imai added.

"I-I think I get it now. Please stop," Ashleigh said awkwardly.

"How bout' we hit one more song for the road," Inigo continued. "Wanna start us off with a cool bass rift?"

"I don't know many jazz songs," Hoge stated evenly.

"Anything's good. Let the music take you on a trip, baby."

"Okay," With a smile, Hoge started.

>>Good Times · Chic - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51r5f5OdIY0

"You're swinging like a natural."

Inigo and Imai fell into the laid-back groove, Ashleigh and Sally joining in with their guitars soon after. The room filled with the fusion of old-school and modern sounds, and soon enough, Hoge found herself immersed in the pulse.

After finishing their song and chatting excitedly about costumes and set lists for a bit longer, the group eventually dispersed to head home before dark. Inigo waved goodbye to Imai and Ashleigh, and Sally and Noah (who had popped in to pick up his girlfriend), he then turned to Hoge who was packing up her bass.

 Glancing over at his girlfriend, he caught Hoge's eye and gave her a little wave.

"Sasuga, Coru-chan! Your bass skills are incredible."

Hoge flushed at the compliment. "Oh, thank you Ini. Though I still have much to learn."

"Are you kidding? You blow us all out of the water! Plus you're not even cheating like I do with Gigan," Inigo encouraged as he twirled his sticks and one of them turned into his dragon construct. He got up to start helping pack up equipment as their bandmates filtered out of the room. Soon it was just the two of them left.

"I know your schedule's packed but- you mind if I walk you back to your dorm?" he asked, rubbing his palms against his pants. "Y'know, since we happen to be going the same way?"

Hoge nodded, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. "I'd like that."

They exited the music wing with instruments in tow, heading down the hallways of Shiketsu just as club activities were ending. The hallway soon filled with students making their way out of the gate. As they walked, Inigo glanced sidelong at Hoge.

"Hard to believe second term is almost over," he mused. "Our internships are coming up too...have you thought about applying to Popsy's agency? I know she's kinda controversial but she's the best." He chuckled. "It could be a really good experience! Break the mold of traditional hero training."

Hoge hugged her bass case closer. "I have considered it," Hoge admitted after a moment. "Her situation is rather unfortunate, but it seems most of the scandal was overblown media speculation anyway. I'm considering her."

Inigo fist pumped the air. "Nice!! Can you imagine? A whole month of chasing bad guys and learning from the #1 hero Popsy!" His eyes took on a dreamy cast. "Do you think she'll teach me how to properly style my hair in a clown style?"

Hoge frowned slightly. "You know, Popsy isn't even an active hero anymore. She is still an incredibly skilled and knowledgeable hero who could teach a great deal. But your...admiration seems rather extreme."

"What? No way!" Inigo argued. "It's a perfectly normal amount of admiration! This isn't about the queen thing is it? Rep-chan, don't tell me you're jealous?" He batted his eyelashes grinning.

Flushing, Hoge huffed "I am not jealous of an elderly woman! But constantly fawning over her make believe persona indicates an unhealthy fixation. You should speak to a school counselor about it."

 "So you are jealous," Inigo stopped in his tracks, clutching his heart. Gigan turned into a storm cloud above him. "Nyoro Hoge! How could you wound me so?" he cried dramatically. Several students in the hallway paused to stare.

"You must know that you, and ONLY you, hold the key to my heart!" Inigo exclaimed with exaggerated passion. "My devotion burns for you like a thousand suns! Please believe me when I say I will love and cherish you until the end of days. I'm going to make you the happiest woman on Earth! On this I swear!"

He dropped to one knee, gazing up at Hoge while she stood frozen in mortification. A chorus of giggles broke out around them. Just then, the hallway door banged open and Principal Nishima came storming out, dragging a struggling student by the ear.

"Ow ow ow! Let me go already!"

Principal Nishima scowled down at the boy. "Tani! You've really done it this time, young man!"

Tani jabbed an accusing finger towards Inigo and Hoge. "Hey, aren't you gonna yell at them?? PDA is against school rules!"

Principal Nishima followed his gaze to the dramatic scene of Inigo proposing.

Hoge had gone invisible, but she reappeared to bow apologetically, and Inigo straightened worriedly. Had he gone too far? This isn't good, Hoge's gonna be fuming if they got in trouble. Her perfect record...

"I uh.. we're rehearing for a play."

Anzu's severe expression instantly melted. "Ohoho, so that's what it is. My lovely hero students!" She tittered, placing a hand on each of their shoulders. "Please pay no mind to grumpy Tani here and his baseless accusations. You two enjoy your youth. You did an excellent job in your exams by the way. You've really made Shiketsu proud! We really showed UA why we're number 1," Her tone hardened again towards the smaller support student. "As for you, straight to detention!"

She hauled him off by the ear down the hallway while Inigo chuckled nervously. "I'll probably get detention later too! See ya in there Satoru!" Inigo waved.

Hoge exhaled in relief. They kept quiet as they resumed walking, two students suddenly approached wearing Shiketsu's business course IDs.

"Hello Myoga, Nyoro," greeted a gray-haired boy who looked almost like he was a middle-aged man. He bowed politely. "I'm Okimoto Chisaka and this is my friend Nesis. We were hoping to ask about the music performance your class is putting on for the festival?"

A girl wearing an old-fashioned plague doctor mask curtsied in greeting. Inigo bowed in return.

"Chisaka-san! Yeah man, it's gonna be awesome. We just finished rehearsing."

Chisaka wrung his hands nervously. "That does sound very nice. But, we were curious what price you had in mind for the entrance fee?"

Hoge shook her head. "The performance will be free to attend. I've already filed the proper documents."

Nesis clapped her hands, voice muffled slightly by her beak mask. "Our class thought it was a mistake. Wonderful. Thank you Nyoro. We are most grateful."

"...But free. This is going to cause some problems," Chisaka stated.

"Eh, what sorta problems?" Inigo probed.

"Oh, never you mind. Let us, the business course handle it."

As the two business course students bowed and headed off to return to their class, Inigo and Hoge overheard Chisaka relaying the news about the free admission. Loud dissent immediately broke out among some other 1-C members.

"Free?!" A tanned male student with a headband yelled out as he stomped on top of a desk, "I'll be damned if I let you take control of the concession stand, Dance-with-Rain! That throne is mine!" Several student stand up on their own desk to meet him. Soon a heated argument erupted over profit shares and signage rules.

Inigo laughed sheepishly as he steered Hoge away from the growing conflict. "Wow, Shiketsu's gotten pretty wild lately huh? Kinda fun though." He nudged her. "At least we don't have to worry about money stuff with our class projects."

Hoge eyed the squabbling students warily. "I've observed it too. The increased chaos seems...concerning. It's too lively." 

"But lively's good!" Inigo grinned, looking around as they crossed the school's gate before taking her hand in his. They fell into step together, strolling through the quiet streets of Kyoto as the first stars began peeking out in the dusky firmament. They went on to talk about the band's set list and music. A peaceful silence blanketed the city. As they waited at a crosswalk, Inigo's thoughts turned towards their future.

Inigo beamed. "You know, with Popsy. The media was just out to get her. She's gonna make a comeback one day for sure. I really think her program would be a great fit for you." He nudged her playfully. "Oh and Chihiro will be there too! And I promise I'll be in my best behavior- even if we're forced to be roommates in her agency."

Hoge flushed slightly at that, fiddling with her glasses. "W-well I haven't submitted my final decision yet. But Popsy's agency is on top of my list."

By then, they had reached the front entrance of Hoge's dorm building. Lingering awkwardly, Inigo rubbed the back of his neck. "Well uh, guess I'll head out then! See you tomorr—"

His words cut off as Hoge suddenly moved closer, tilting her face up towards his with eyes gently closed. Inigo's brain short-circuited. Was she expecting him to...? His heart thundered rapidly. Swallowing down nerves, Inigo began leaning in to meet her lips, their breath intermingling...

"Oy, Nyoro!" A brash voice interrupted. "Thanks for letting me borrow this charger!"

The pair jerked back from each other, faces aflame. Hoge's land-lady stood nearby, brandishing said charger with a knowing look. "What's going on with you two, eh? You know the rules of the dorm."

"Ahaha, silly me, losing track of time out here!" Inigo babbled. Hoge had gone completely invisible beside him. "I gotta dash, but let's meet up again soon yeah? Great practice session, buddy!"

He fled before Hoge could respond. Getting her kicked out would be the last thing he wanted to do. Inigo clutched at his wildly thumping heart. Well, so much for a suave goodnight kiss. But an entire month with Hoge at the Popsy internship... he'd get plenty of chances there! Just thinking about it made him dizzy with longing.

Don't mess this up, he told himself firmly as he grew verdant wings and took off into the sky. An exhilarated grin spread unbidden across Inigo's face as he fluttered all the way home.

"I wonder what Popsy is like."

####Nov 6, 21xx
The next day, Inigo wandered aimlessly through the buzzing arcade, hands shoved in his pockets. The others were too busy for band practice today. Multicolored lights flashed erratically as vintage game themes blared from rows of cabinets. Yet none of the nostalgic childhood magic stirred Inigo's mood. He just felt...off. Restless. Like an itch under his skin he couldn't scratch.

Pausing by a crane game stuffed to bursting with plushies, Inigo watched a young girl maneuver the claw unsuccessfully again and again in pursuit of a unicorn nearly as large as herself. Behind her an older boy lined up tickets by denomination at the prize counter, his younger brother bouncing excitedly at his side. The warmth kindled a strange ache in Inigo's chest. His brothers had taken him to an arcade just like this one.

Shaking his head, he moved on. None of the games held their usual appeal. He considered just heading home...then the pounding rhythms of the taiko drums caught his ear. A spark of inspiration hit and Inigo made a beeline for the machine. Hell yeah, setting a new high score would lift his spirits for sure!

Cracking his knuckles, Inigo selected the highest difficulty song and chose his avatar. As the ridiculously fast beat started up, twin mallets materialized in his hands. Inigo grinned, tension draining from his shoulders. This was exactly what he needed! He played around with most games, but he was a taiko god. Taiko is life.

**DON KA DON DON**

He smashed the drum heads with practiced precision, nailing even the trickiest rhythmic combinations. The familiar satisfaction of excelling at something difficult began flowing through him. Inigo let muscle memory take over, his focus narrowing to each demanding sixteenth note. Nothing existed except the throbbing drums and his exquisitely timed strikes. He was a god behind these skins!

**DON DON KA DON KA**

All too soon, the song ended in a dramatic flourish. Breathing hard, Inigo watched his new high score flash in pixelated glory upon the screen. Oh yeah! Suck on that, random arcade patron from five years ago! He wiped sweat from his brow, mood lifting. Maybe today wasn't so bad after a—

"Wow, not bad!" came an impressed voice behind him. Whirling around, Inigo found himself face to face with Orochi. How had he not noticed her approach?

"Heh, just blowing off some steam," he rubbed his neck self-consciously.

Orochi's eyes crinkled. "I'll say, I could hear you wailing on those drums halfway across the arcade! You've gotten really good."

"Nah, I just play for fun."

"Uh-huh." Her tone dripped skepticism. "So...wanna go for the doubles high score? My treat!" She held up a cup brimming with tokens.

"You sure you can keep up?" Inigo teased. Orochi simply tossed her hair and selected a character, readying her mallets. Laughing, Inigo chose the most challenging co-op song in the catalog and together they demolished the high score target by over a thousand points. Soon a small crowd gathered to watch them dominate, oohing and ahhing at their flawless teamwork. By the time they finished their arms ached, but euphoria flooded their veins.

**KA DON DON DON KA**

"Man, that was awesome!" Inigo cheered, giving Orochi a sweaty high-five. "We gotta come back again and defend our title!"

"Heck yeah!" Her grin dimmed slightly. "If we have time between internships and stuff I mean."

Inigo nodded, exhilaration fading as he too pondered the weeks ahead. "Yeah... Hey you here with Yui?"

"I was but she left early. It's just me now."

Tame held up a finger behind them, "I'm actually here too. The arcade is so nice."

An awkward beat passed before Inigo cleared his throat. "Hey uh, random, but you doing alright? Couldn't help noticing you've seemed kinda tired in class lately. Something going on? Late night training?"

Orochi blinked rapidly. "Huh? Oh no I'm good. Just stress y'know? Year's almost over and hero work is no joke." She laughed but it sounded forced. Inigo's eyes narrowed. Was she hiding something? Things had been different with her since her hospitalization. He opened his mouth to pry further...

...when sudden shouting arose nearby. Inigo spotted a group of girls clustered around a dance machine, speaking urgently. His eyes widened as he recognized their uniforms—1-E from Shiketsu's other hero class. What were they doing here? And why did they look so suspicious? 

"Hey, you wanna join me for something." Inigo gestured forward sneakily. Exchanging a glance with Orochi, unspoken agreement passed between them. As one, the duo crept closer to eavesdrop.

"—telling you guys, I can hack the machine to overwrite the score!" one girl holding a megaphone insisted to her reluctant friends. "Just gimme like, two minutes tops." Inigo can recognize Yerricson and her yellow jacket anywhere.

"I dunno," a tanned girl with long white hair said. "Isn't that cheating?"

The first girl just scoffed. "Um, duh! Yokia Yerricson calling Akairo. That's the whole point! Don't you wanna wipe the smug smiles off those 1-D jerks? They come here all the time and take all the high scores. Wait til you see their faces."

Another tanned girl, identical to the first snickered. "Oooo good idea. Let's do all the machines."

Inigo frowned. These sneaky little cheats! Orochi placed a warning hand on his arm before he could confront them directly. Instead she tilted her head meaningfully towards the dance machine, eyes glinting with mischief. Catching her drift, Inigo smirked and together they waited for the girls to rig their high score. Then the two of them approached.

"Wowww, so impressive!" Inigo gushed loudly, clapping the bewildered Yerricson on the back. "9,999,998? Highest score I've ever seen! You ladies are incredible!"

The girls gaped at him in utter confusion before Orochi chimed in. "I know right? With skills like that you could go pro! Hey everyone, check this out!"

She began calling over random passerby. "These girls just crushed the all time national record!"

A curious crowd gathered, the color drained from the girls' faces. They glared venomously at Inigo and Orochi who continued extolling their imaginary talent.

"C'mooon, show us those champion moves!" Inigo cajoled, to a smattering of encouraging applause. When the embarrassed trio tried to slink away, Orochi blocked them.

"We're actually out of tokens. Sorry," Yerricson stated frankly.

"No worries, we have some. It's our treat!" Orochi called out.

Inigo slid tokens into the dance machine which blinked to life expectantly. "C'mon! Show us how it's done! Highest difficulty right? There you go!"

The crowd closed in.
<Oh my they're so talented.> <I want to see!> <I'm having a bad day and this will crush if it's not real.> <Woooo!> <Wow! Go girls go!>

Trapped by peer pressure, the red-faced girls had no choice.  Stumbled through an utterly abysmal routine. The unimpressed audience watched with surprise, many of them laughing and recording. The two dragon-quirked teens wandered off and leaving the mortified cheaters to escape while Orochi and Inigo high-fived.

"Did you see their faces?" Inigo snickered. "Serves them right for erasing our Chris b-day record."

"For real." Orochi smirked. "They're never gonna live that one down." 

"Hang on, just got a call." Inigo trailed off. "Huh. Think it's a friend." Unease swirled in his gut. Junichi? What was his wayward friend plotting?

"Oh wow, yeah you should see what he wants." Orochi hitched her bag higher. "I'll catch ya later then?"

"For sure!"
***
Inigo entered the bathroom. Junichi broody voice came out the other side, he sounded upset.

>Junichi: Hey,
>Inigo: Yo. Is this about Charlattan's laptop?
>Junichi: No. You busy?
>Inigo: Kinda.. I'm at the arcade. Want me to come over?
>Junichi: Nah. Where does Takeda live? I need to talk to him.
>[...]

Inigo left the bathroom after combing his hair a few times. He wondered what Joon and Hifumi were up to. 
***

After resolving the odd phone call, Inigo wandered back to the arcade craving some mindless gaming to decompress. Immediately he spotted Orochi in front of a gachapon machine, softly cursing under her breath as she turned the crank over and over. She's still here?

"No luck finding the one you want huh?" Inigo asked sympathetically. Orochi nearly jumped, her tails hissing at him.

"Gah! Don't sneak up on me dude!" Scowling, she gestured in frustration at the rows of plastic capsules lined up neatly before her. "I just want the mystery neko keychain for Yui. It's a 5% chance but nope! Two sets of everything except the one I actually need!"

Inigo examined her extensive, repeats-heavy collection, suppressing a laugh. "She's gonna have one hell of a keychain selection at least," he offered diplomatically. Orochi only narrowed her eyes.

"Laugh it up, but Imma keep trying out of spite, every day if I have to! If had time." Her sharp tone belied some sadness in her eyes. Inigo's mirth faded. Right...the internships started soon. They'd all be split up for weeks.

"Alright!" Inigo rolled up his suit's sleeves and walked off.

"Where are you going?" Orochi asked.

"To get more coins! We gotta get that mystery gacha for Yui!"

***

"I'm all out," Orochi sighed as she placed the last dud into a bag full of gacha capsules.

"Me too. Ugh," Inigo replied. "I'd rather do the license exams again than spin another gacha."

"I should've brought more money."

"You get the whole set?" Inigo asked, peeking over at the neko capsules.

"Yeah, all of them except for the mystery prize. You can have the doubles, maybe share them with the others," Orochi handed a few of them gloomily. "Here, least I can do for keeping me company."

"Thanks, we done for the night? Maybe we should just break one open while no one's lookin'. I'm sure Gigan can shrink down," he said lightly, hoping to lift her spirits.

"I know it's silly  but...wanted to give Yui a little memento?" She shrugged. "Since we'll be apart for the internships and all. Kinda unsure about the whole thing if I'm being honest.

"Yeah I get it. You're with Seiryu, right? Yui's gonna be with Popsy with me and Hoge. We'll take care of her," Inigo reassured, as he selected a few keychains to give out that reminded him of classmates.

Orochi looked outside the arcade, grimacing at the torrential downpour now flooding the streets.

"Crap, guess I'm taking the bus," Orochi grumbled, yanking her hood up. 

"Yeah, catch ya later then."

As Orochi left, Inigo grumbled and made his way to the arcade's west exit. From the side of his eyes, he heard a little boy with a clam-head cheering. 

"Cool! It's the Lucky Neko Mystery prize!"

 "Wow, you got it kid!"

An arcade attendant congratulated the boy as a small crowd gathered to cheer him on. Inigo paused and looked at his construct. Gigan frowned.

"-I'm gonna bring this home to my dad!"

***
***
Orochi stepped out into the downpour, cursing under her breath as fat raindrops fell on her. Her hydra tails took refuge inside her drenched hoodie. She quickened her pace towards the bus stop, ears flat against her head. Just another crappy end to a long day. At least she had a bag full of keychains to show for her wasted effort, she thought gloomily. She stood by the bus stop and took her Kyoto pass.

"Orochi, wait up!"

Just as the bus arrived, she turned in surprise to see Inigo sprinting towards her, hair plastered to his forehead. Gigan flapped frantically overhead, trying in vain to shield them both.

"Are you crazy?" Orochi yelled over the drumming rain. "You're gonna get sick!"

Skidding to a stop, Inigo grinned and held up a familiar plastic capsule. "Yeah but I got this!"

Orochi's eyes widened. "How?"

"I found one more coin in my pocket," Inigo smirked. "I dunno, felt lucky I guess."

No way... Quickly she popped it open, gasping as the rare neko keychain tumbled into her palm, as promised. Its oversized head bobbed happily under the downpour.

"I can't believe you found it!" Her eyes sparkled as she stared. "This is exactly the one Yui wanted!"

"Worth catching pneumonia over to see you looking happy. I'm looking forward to see you and Yui dancing in the festival," Inigo chuckled, shivering in the cold. Above him Gigan snorted, thoroughly drenched as he tried extending his wing over them like an umbrella.

Orochi shrugged, "We'll do our best. Good luck with your internship too." She turned to leave.

Inigo shot Orochi a cheesy pair of finger guns as the rain poured around him, plastering his spiky hair to his forehead.

"Hey uh - I dunno what's going on with you lately," he said, raising his voice over the drumming rain. "I guess we all got our own stuff happening right now. But remember we're always gonna be classmates and comrades, bonded together by fate!"

He struck a dramatic pose, raindrops flying from his arms. "We're the twin dragons of 1-D! Nothing can tear our class apart!"

Orochi laughed and shook her head, her hydra tails twitching amusedly. "Alright you doofus, enough with the theatrics. I have to get home before my family gets worried." She smiled, sharp canines glinting. "But thanks for today. I had fun hanging out."

The bus driver honked impatiently from where the vehicle idled by the curb.

"Oops, that's my ride!" Orochi hitched her bag higher. "See ya in class, Myoga!"

"Catch ya later, dragon-sister! Let's play some Fekken again!" Inigo called, waving enthusiastically as the bus pulled away into the rainy night.

He stood there a moment longer, rain pattering softly on his skin.

 No matter how much darkness and uncertainty swirled around them these days, they could always create a little light and joy to push it back. 

The thought sparked inspiration. He really needed to write an upbeat song about that with Imai!

####Bonus After Credit Scene

The next day found Inigo miserably sick in bed, head pounding and body aching. He grinned weakly despite his pallid complexion.

"I don't mind dying..." he declared, voice a pitiful croak. "We had a rad bonding moment. I got her the thing. So now she can marry Yui.. or Edith, or whoever." 

Beside him, Hoge sat in a bright yellow radiation suit, face obscured by the reflective helmet.

"Baka. You're hopeless, you know that?" She placed a wet towel on his forehead and popped a thermometer into his mouth.

The cold lasted for exactly one day. Totally worth it.
