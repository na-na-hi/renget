Suzume's greatest crisis.
 
Suz: Mebu! I came again!
 
Shi: It's Kagajou.
 
Yum: Welcome.
 
Suz: Huh? Did I mix the rooms up? This is Mebu's room, right?
 
Yum: It certainly is.
 
Shi: Kusunoki's still at the meeting.
 
Suz: Okay. I'll just wait here then.
 
Yum: Alfred! A spot of tea for our guest... Oh my, I forgot he was on a leave.
 
Shi: The usual.
 
Suz: Going with your trademark gag, eh.
 
Yum: I would appreciate not being treated as a stale comedian.
 
Suz: Heh. I've thought of a new gag recently too. And Sensei...
 
Aki: Pfft... Well, that wasn't bad.
 
Suz: Even praised me for it! Wanna see it? 
 
Yum: You showed your comedy routine to our teacher?
 
Suz: She's been coming to waking me up lately, so I used the moment. 
 
Shi: Aki-sensei really is kind... probably.
 
Suz: Alright, here I go! Ueeh, hup, hup hup! Your duty's been decided. Cleanup at the Taisha. That's got nothing to do with your Sentinel duties. That's got nothing to do with your Sentinel duties.
 
Suz: Snap?
 
Shi: That was a really bad sound just now...
 
Yum: Aah... Suzume-san... Look at your feet...
 
Suz: Aaaaaaagh! I stepped on Mebu's castle model!
 
SHI: Are you retarded or something!? You had me come out in shock!
 
Yum: Was it really necessary to perform something with so much movement?
 
Suz: I-I-I-I-It's broken! The top of the castle, it's broken!
 
Yum: Terrifying... What a terrifying predicament this is!
 
Suz: What have we done...
 
SHI: Who "we"!?
 
Yum: Do not drag us into this!
 
SHI: Go apologise to Kusunoki, there's no other way!
 
Suz: Wait... I'll try simulating it...
 
Meb: You broke my plastic model? Ah. I see. Then tell me what your most important thing is. I'll break it the same way.
 
Suz: Aah, I just saw a horrifying future ahead of me!
 
SHI: Oh come on, Kusunoki wouldn't do that. She'd let you off with being her sandbag.
 
Suz: I don't wanna get hurt! 
 
Yum: Perhaps she could let you off the hook with simply not talking to you for a while?
 
Suz: Being ignored by Mebu is gonna kill me!
 
SHI: You don't want this, you don't want that. What are you even gonna do then?
 
Suz: M-Maybe I could repair this somehow... A drop of glue, and maybe she won't notice... Heh, heh heh, heheheh...
 
SHI: Uwaah...
 
Yum: I have never seen a smile so empty.
 
Aya: You can't do that!
 
Suz: Ayaya, were you listening?
 
Aya: Suzume-senpai, I think honestly apologising is the best choice here.
 
Suz: B-But...
 
Aya: I'll be with you...
 
Suz: Uu... Ayaya, will you hold my hand while I'm apologising to Mebu, then?
 
Aya: Okay! I'll hold it really tight!
 
SHI: Wow, Kagajou's amazing. Normally you'd try to atone at least a little.
 
Yum: She roped Kokudo-san in without a moment of hesitation.
 
SHI: But wait, you should probably find a good time to apologise first.
 
Yum: Mebuki-san looks somewhat angry in general, but it would be best not to add fuel to the fire when she's particularly enraged.
 
Suz: I've lived my life by carefully watching the others' expressions. It's time for my specialty: determine how she feels and finish it off with a spectacular prostration!
 
SHI: It's almost refreshing how thorough you are.
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai spotted!
 
Suz: Let's see, Mebu's mood is... Hmm... Her anger's subsided but only for five more minutes, if I'm to apologise it has to be now!
 
Aya: Let's go then!
 
Suz: Y-Yeah. On a count of three.
 
Aya: Okay!
 
Suz: One... Twooooooo... One...
 
Aya: It's back to one!
 
Suz: I'm nervous now that we're doing this. Okay, this time for sure. O-Ooooooooone... Twooooo...
 
SHI: Agh! Get it over with already! Get going!
 
Meb: Hm? What's up, Suzume? Oh, Aya-chan's here too.
 
Suz: Mebu, you see... I, uh... Your plastic model...
 
Meb: Hm? What about my plastic model? 
 
Aki: I'm sorry to interrupt. I'll just announce something. Kusunoki-san, please come to my room tomorrow morning. 
 
Meb: Another one of your crazy tasks?
 
Suz: Eek! Her mood got worse!
 
Aki: You'll learn when time is due. Excuse me.
 
Meb: Jeez... So, what was it about my plastic model, Suzume?
 
Suz: Eh? Uh, well, you see...
 
Meb: ?
 
Aya: Suzume-senpai, I believe in you! 
 
Suz: I'm sorry! I broke the top part of a castle model that was in your room, Mebu!
 
Meb: Eh!? *cough*
 
Suz: Me-Mebu!?
 
Aya: Mebuki-senpai, are you okay?
 
Meb: F-First of all, I need to confirm the situation.
 
Meb: Hm... Hmm...
 
Suz: *gulp*
 
Meb: Phew. I can repair this, no problem.
 
Suz: T-Thank goodness... Not that there's anything good here.
 
Meb: Aya-chan, good job playing along with Suzume. Jeez, when I saw you holding a junior's hand while apologising I couldn't even get angry at you.
 
Suz: T-Then!
 
Meb: Suzume, I'll let you off with a ban from my room for a while.
 
Suz: Whaaa...
 
Yum: Looks like today we all gathered in Mebuki-san's room again.
 
Aya: S-Suzume-senpai isn't here, though.
 
Meb: She's banned from here, that's how it is.
 
Shi: I brought a cake for everyone.
 
Meb: Let's have some, then.
 
Shi: How many plates?
 
Meb: Me, Aya-chan, Miroku-san and you. That makes four. Although... Make it five plates.
 
Suz: Ah! Mebuuu!
 
Yum: Were you standing in the hallway?
 
Suz: You forgave me, right!? That's why I love you, Mebu! I'll follow you forever!
 
Meb: No, the fifth plate is for SHIZUKU.
 
Suz: Whaaa...
 
Meb: I'm joking.
 
Suz: Mebu!
 
Meb: But now that I think about it, forgiving you too fast wouldn't be good either.
 
Suz: Whaaa...
 
Aya: They really get along well.
 
Shi: In a way, they're a perfect match.
 
Yum: Sheesh.
 
Meb: Guess I'll forgive you, though.
 
Suz: Mebu!
 
Meb: Wait, no.
 
Suz: Mebu...
 
Meb: Forgive-
 
Suz: Me-!
 
Meb: Won't forgive-
 
Suz: Bu!
