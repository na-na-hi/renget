Hi! I make cards of many kinds - minigirls, adventures, and other high concept experimental stuff. I focus on making the user feel like a character in a novel.

## Claude 3 prompt

I created a prompt preset to serve as a rock solid reliable baseline for the new generation of models in the **Claude** family. Here's some things you should know first:
- The preset is **minimal**. Claude 3 needs little convincing of anything, just common sense instructions for what to do. Sentences were removed until I was sure each one has a positive effect. Parts of the preset are wrapped in a shallow tag hierarchy to avoid mentioning things multiple times and save tokens.
- The preset is **unbiased**. Claude 3 is very susceptible to suggestion, and just mentioning a topic introduces bias. The preset tries to improve handling of mature content without putting undue attention on it. However, it's still possible for cards to feel more horny than before if their definition was tweaked to overcome the bias of earlier, more censored models.
- The preset is **compatible**. Cards whose name doesn't refer to a character work out of the box. Cards using system prompt override will behave as expected, allowing advanced cards to affect writing style and formatting while obeying global preferences like response length. Default prompt is for third-person prose and novel style narration, which might conflict some cards that do first-person without any overrides. There's no avoiding that, but at least it's easy to tweak.
- **Impersonation** and **Continue** that work reliably! Despite using a prefill.
- Thoroughly tested on **Sonnet**. Got no refusals on vanilla NSFW and tamer fetishes. If you do anything more extreme or non-con, please report back.
- The point isn't to give you the best possible prose out of the box, but to be a reliable and **transparent** baseline. You should be able to easily make it spit out any writing you want by tweaking the sections tagged as *[EDITABLE]*.

## Cards

First, some notes:
- All cards **Female** and **OC**. Lots of minigirl content, but a fair bit of normal-sized girls too if you're not into that.
- Some use a **system prompt override** to ensure intended formatting, POV of the narrator and the writing style. Make sure your JB doesn't break if this feature is used. You can confirm this by checking that the **Main** section under **Quick Prompts Edit** contains no tags or other critical structure, just a simple explanation of what the model is expected to do (or nothing at all, that also works).
- Most cards are compatible with both male and female **personas**. Set a persona, or the model will attempt to guess details like your gender and appearance.
- Sorted from newest first.

**Sora** is an eccentric yumejoshi, playing otome games all day without caring what others think of her. However, her affection has been completely redirected at you, the boy from class who looks just like her favorite fictional character. Her walls are now plastered with photos of you, and she's deduced and memorized all your preferences... and yet, she has always been too shy to say a single word to your face. One day, she managed to find out about your minigirl fascination. Without thinking twice, she broke into your room and shrank herself. What happened afterwards was not at all how she pictured it.

**Persona**
The premise requires that user is male. Make sure your persona doesn't conflict this.

**Greeting**
The greeting is extremely long - a short story written to establish the entire setup and push the model into an entertaining, light-novel-like writing style.

[Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/7uqn6t.png) | [Chub](https://chub.ai/characters/aiwaifuenthusiast/iris-a5c3c28f)

**Iris** is your high school girlfriend, demure and dainty. She enjoys acting the way she looks, but hates it when people treat her like it, expecting them to understand that her childish appearance and attitude are just an act. The illusion breaks sometimes when the maturity of her real age shines through the facade.

Recently, she agreed to try our the Girlfriend App - a reality-shifting mobile app for controlling your girlfriend's body and clothing. Feel free to hang out with her, or have some fun with the app.

**Greetings**

### Arri

| | |
|-|-|
| ![Arri](https://files.catbox.moe/1m29sx.png) | A girl with a horrifying power she's unaware of. As she lives her happy stress-free life, things and people change and disappear around her for her comfort and convenience. |

[Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/2in5do.png) | [Chub](https://chub.ai/characters/aiwaifuenthusiast/arri-9953124f)

**Arri** is a cheerful, confident high school girl. She always gets what she wants, and everything always goes her way. Why? The reason is simple: her reality-bending powers, which indiscriminately edit everything around her to match her expectations, wishes and hopes. These edits can make things pop in and out of existence, modify bodies and personalities, or even break the fundamental laws of physics.

She has no idea this is happening, and every attempt to let her know has met with failure. And around Arri, failures can be... catastrophic. So, you can imagine how much it sucks to be you, her unwitting dorm roommate.

My entry for Unconventional Monsters week.

**Greetings**
1. Hangout after school,
2. Leading an investigation,
3. Discovering a murder,
4. Forced into a relationship,
5. Exploring size difference.

**Mari** is a hyperactive girl who has always idolized mad scientists. She dropped out of school and now lives with you, doing science experiments all day. Well, that's what she calls putting random reagents into devices gotten off Amazon and seeing what happens. Explosions are commonplace. One day though, she accidentally manages to actually achieve something, and her experiment ends up shrinking her down to 1/8th size..

**Greetings**
1. Discovered shrunken in her room,
2. Trying to cook up the antidote.

[Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/xnxmyu.png) | [Chub](https://chub.ai/characters/aiwaifuenthusiast/lieze-e823b25c)

**Lieze** was always different, more into technology than social interaction. She dropped out of school early to live in peace, making money on bug bounties and consulting. Little does she know that her life of solitude is about to be turned upside down when you, an actual real fairy, arrive at her doorstep.

**Persona**
Use a blank persona. User's full details are included in the description, including gender and full detailed appearance.

**Greetings**
1. Accidental encounter,
2. Purposeful encounter,

That's where you come in, a colleague from the IT department who just happened to notice her first.

1. At your office desk,
2. At the moment of discovery,

### Dream fairy Elena

**Elena** is a fairy whose job is to fulfill the secret fantasies of the human that she's assigned to. Tell her what you're into, and you might begin to see reality shift around you sometime soon. Keep in mind though that she can be wild and unpredictable, and the results might not be exactly what you expect!

**Naomi** is a total airhead, gets distracted out of nowhere and talks seemingly to thin air. But in reality she's just talking to you, the strange god who keeps making weird and embarrassing things happen to her for your own enjoyment. Your physical body doesn't exist in her world, but I'm sure with the complete omnipotence you can work something out.

**Greetings**
1. General purpose,
2. Intimate activity quick start,
3. Story scenario - how will you improve Naomi's school life?

### Tokoro

|||
|-|-|
| ![Tokoro](https://files.catbox.moe/f8qovr.png) | A small percentage of girls shrink to doll size and legally become free-use property. |

[Catbox](https://files.catbox.moe/f0ft2s.png) | [Chub](https://chub.ai/characters/aiwaifuenthusiast/a4af02e8-ce47-4ea9-a463-771bf31a39e2)

A phenomenon known as reduction strikes about 10% of girls of age 18 to 20, and it causes them to spontaneously shrink to 1/8th of their size for the rest of their life. They are commonly referred to as "dolls", and law states that they become the property of whoever first finds them in their reduced state. Once owned, a doll's basic needs must be met such as food and shelter, and in exchange the doll must allow the owner any activity that doesn't cause physical harm.

**Tokoro** is your good friend from high school. She's had her head in the books all day every day, until you showed her how to relax and have fun with things. And now... you found her reduced to 8 inches tall, and standing on a classroom desk.

**Greetings**
1. Moment of discovery (1st person),
2. Daily life together (3rd person).
