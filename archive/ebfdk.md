Penny Poacher/Graphorn


>>I sucked under the streak of blue light, responding with a blasting charm of my own, sending the Dark witch flying, her arms splayed out as she screamed in pain and smoke curled off of her body.

>>For a moment I stayed still, hyper alert and listening for more poachers, but when no more apparated into the ruined camp I stood straighter and lowered my wand before moving off to the cages of nifflers, kneazels, and crups near the main tent of the camp.

>>As the last crup curled around my ankle in thanks before running off to freedom, I turned my attention to that tent, hoping to find information regarding more camps like these...

>>Peeling the tent flap back, I sucked in a surprised breath. It was like Horntail Hall all over again. The tent was much bigger on the inside, but unlike Horntail Hall this tent full of Poachers had known I was outside...

>>Fifty Dark wizards were all pointing their wand at me, and before I could roll backwards out of the tent, the fabric was sealed shut and then transfigured into a brick wall, trapping my between a rock and a hard place.>
My Shield came up and deflected the first six spells, but then I was forced to roll out of the way as a bright green bolt of acidic death raced for, and just barely missed me…

>>The combat had been long and hard but when half of them were dead I found my supply of healing and other beneficial potions had started running low, forcing me to fight more defensively. I had ducked behind an overturned table reinforced with a quick and dity charm that increased it's durability while I tried to staunch the blood from a gash on my arm, even as my barricade shook from repeated spell-fire. Every now and then It's peek up and cast wide area damaging spells to keep them off my back, but I had stopped thinking of victory and started worrying about escape...

>>"Come out come out lit'l Penny," taunted a feminine voice, "take yer lumps loike a good girl!"

>>I hated that crappy accent, and hearing the taunts directed at me chaffed too, but I had just finished tying a tourniquet around my arm and I was ready to really start fighting again. I popped up from my barricade and summoned the robes of that cockney cunt, slicing her throat with a severing charm as she sailed towards me and then using her levitated remains to intercept a blasting curse, the spell turning the corpse into a fine red most that hung in the air long enough for me to banish it back towards that trigger happy wizard, blinding him with blood - my own blast ended him. Of course the three seconds it took for all that to happen was enough for the other 20+ wizards to start their next spells and I was forced to duck, but I wasn't quick enough and I was thrown back, my head slamming into the corner of an iron cage. My vision faded in and out as I struggled to get up, but then a Poacher was there, pointing his wand at me. I saw a flash of red light and knew no more…

>>The first thing I was aware of was that my arms were numb and tingly

>>The second thing was that I was entirely naked, stripped to skin, with my arms tied above my head. My hat was missing and my braid hade even been undone, my coppery hair loose and wavy.

>>The third thing I noticed was that I wasn't alone. All around me stood the remaining poachers I hadn't managed to kill after being trapped in their headquarters. There were roughly 20 of them and I crossed my legs as I glared up at them.

"Let me go... Now..."

>>They chuckled at me and I saw them parting as someone approached. It was a woman - older than I had expected a Poacher to be. She had dark hair that was fading to grey, and a heavy, blocky build. A body used to living roughly.

>>"Ah, Penelope Warwick. Tha lit'l trollop what killed me daughta... I should Cruciate yeh until you bite her own tongue off... I wanted too. But 'den I 'ad me a better idea...

>>Oh Merlin. The mom of that cockney slag...

>>"We got ourselfs a lot a wee beasties 'ere what struggle sumfink fierce. I fink I know just how to calm 'em..

>>The poachers around her laughed and I tensed.

>>The crowd of Poachers surged towards me and held my down, my legs my arms and shoulders. My wrists were unshackled and I was man-handled, unable to do much but he marched towards a large cage covered with a tarp that prevented me from seeing what it contained in the center of the tent. As we went I felt hands grabbing my chest, spanking my rear end hard enough to leave hand-prints, and rubbing with no care or forethought between my legs - one of them kept grabbing my coppery pubic hair and tugging it hard, but through all of it, besides a few whimpers when one of them pushed me over and shoved a finger into my dry, puckered rear-end, pumping it in and out a few times. Eventually they tossed me into the cage and I landed hard in a pile of straw.

>>The fact that the straw wasn't on fire had me relieved that I wasn't being fed to a dragon, but then I heard a deep rumbling growl from the depth of the cage. I slowly picked myself up, ignoring the twinge in my recovering rosebud. I couldn't see what was making the noise, but then that tarp was summoned away and I saw the Graphorn approaching. Mottled grey skin covering steel-hard muscles, its back seemingly made of spikes. It was fifteen feet long and regarding me cautiously, warily. I sucked in a breath as it closed with me, facial tentacles reaching out and caressing my own face, neck, and chest as it sniffed at me.

>>Trying hard not to panick, I tried to think back on everything I knew of the Beasts, but all I was coming up with was how dangerous they were, even for prepared wizards possessing a wand, let alone a naked wandless, exhausted witch..

>>I tried to back away, my hands raised to show that I wasn't a threat, but then it's golden yellow eyes snapped up to meet mine and if huffed out a warbling sound.

G-good beast... Good Graphorn...

>>It shoved its head against me, nudging me back a half step, and then it came closer, smelling me once more, and I heard the poachers laughing from outside the cage, the bitch who ordered me put in here holding my wand and smirking. "While yeh were out of it we gave yeh a new perfume, y'see," she explained cruely even as I tried to keep an eye on both the Graphorn and the Bitch, "the pheromone-fuelled excretions of a female Graphorn. A female in heat, that is! Human nose can't smell it, but I know 'e can!"

>>As of to punctuate her statement, the Graphorn bumped me again, his great big facial tentacles moving over my chest, scaly ridges rubbing in what I hoped was an accident over my nipples...

>>Eventually I backed up as far as I could, the cold metal of the cage door pressing into my back and arse, but still the Graphorn drew close, overhead light glinting off it's great golden horns. It was them that I heard it, even over the Graphorns warbles, and the jeers of the Poachers, two heavy something's impacting against the ground...

>>I swallowed nervously, a pit of fear opening in my stomach even as my legs started to cross in some cheap defiance I somehow knew wasn't going to be enough to save me.

>>I tried to shimmy to the side, making my movements as non-threatening as I could, but the Graphorn shoved me the rest of the way before he backed away and moved off a bit. He warbled again, the sound deep and undulating in tone and strength and he lifted himself onto his back legs, the cage only just tall enough to support his height and horns. He clenched his muscles, as though he were a body builder but I couldn't take that in because I saw what had made those heavy sounds moments ago. There were -two- of them. They were unmistakably cocks hanging between his hind legs. One on top of the other. They were roughly a foot long and at the base there was a knot as thick around as my calf and while they tapered to a sort-of point nearer the tip the shafts had dozens of not a hundred little inch long tentacles wriggling like an anemone caught in a current, each glowing with a pulsing golden light that ran from tip to base and back again endlessly.

>>I started to breathe heavily, my eyes darting for some sort of escape…

>>The Graphorn's large, powerful, scaled and spiked tail started to sway behind it in some strange sort of dance and it's warbling became a sort of song and I grimaced as the poachers cat-called me.

>>"Go get 'im Luv!"
>>"Your boyfriend awaits!"
>>"'e's serenadin' yeh!"

>>I flashed them a scowl, but I didn't approach, in fact, I did the opposite, scooting away a few inches at a time. Making a circuit of the cage. The Graphorn regarded me patiently, turning as I walked so he was always presenting 'himself' to me.

>>Unfortunately, my plan to examine the cage for weaknesses backfired when the Bitch up there used my own wand to hite with a Tripping jinx, sending me sprawling to the ground, face in the straw and arsw up in the air, which was all the invitation the Graphorn needed, apparently as it jumped on top of me quicker than I could react, pinning me beneath it.

>>I yelled out, trying to struggle free even as the poachers all jeered and laughed, but he was heavy enough that I couldn't move, and I was being poked with the only slightly duller scales on its chest, making me worry about what would happen if I messed about too much under him.

>>His facial tentacles fell in a curtain overy face, my head between his front legs and I grunted up at him, slapping his thick armored legs.

>>He probably didn't even feel it.

H-hey! Get off! No! St-stooop!

>>As I struggled and fought back, yelling curses and unintelligible grunts and screams, the Graphorn was moving, but not his body... It seemed as though his... Phalluses were able to be moved independently from one another and I felt two somethings start to prod around behind me. Hot tears started to fall from my eyes and I grimaced when on of those massive things found purchase on my pussy's opening, its slender point thankfully not suart, but able to slip inside like the tip of a human's cock. That though was where the similarities ended because once that first inch was inside, he widened dramatically and I felt my breath leave my lungs in a pained gasp as my teary eyes snapped open. I gripped handfuls of straw as he forced himself into my dry pussy, but then he caught the first of those smaller tentacles linging his shaft and he seemed to struggle with my (surely tighter than a female Graphorn's) passage, but then he grunted his warbling grunt, his chest rattling my whole body, before he shoved another three inches in, drawing a howl from my lips...

>>Only five inches in and it felt like I had two fists inside my pussy, tearing me apart. I let out body-shaking sobs of pain and though I couldn't see them due to the Graphorn's facial tentacles and thick legs I could hear the poachers.

>>"Cor! You see that?"
>>"You can see the light from 'is willie shinin' through 'er body!"
>>"Like holdin' yer 'and up to a light it is!"
>>My world was pain, but then the Graphorn huffed, seemingly annoyed, and pulled out a bit until just that slim head was inside me, giving me a chance to breath before I felt something slick and slimy pump inside me as it gave me a few shallow thrusts, the movement getting strangely easier, and though my mind was addled by pain and exhaustion, I knew that Graphorn's didn't -do- things like that. That was like the Snare, or the Silver Serpents, but then the possible answer came to me: could Graphorn's have control over the release of precum? Was he lubricating me to make his 'job' easier?

>>And just when the pain was leaving, he shoved himself in deeper than ever, at least seven inches and I grit my teeth to keep from biting my tongue off yelling. The lubricant helped, but he was still massive, especially with a hundred wriggling tentacles in my pussy alongside his arm-thick shaft.

Fffuuuuuuuu!!!

>>I gritted out, pussy contracting, automatically trying to expel this invader the unnatural (to a Graphorn) tightness of a human vagina drew a whimper from the beast and I felt something start prodding at mt puckered asshole...

Nononononono!!!

>>But it wasn't to be and the top of his second cock slipped inside, but it seemed he learned his lesson because he immediately released copious amounts of precum into my ass, feeling like a gushing hose of slimy goop.

>>"Haha look'it 'im go!"
>>"Save some fer us!"
>>"You git, you really want a Graphorn's blown out sloppy seconds?"

>>The beast pumped what felt like cups of precum into my arse and even though everything I knew about anal sex said I had to relax or it would hurt more, I couldn't bring my body to do it, and I braced as that second cock slid inside slowly, but with all the inevitability of an avalanche in winter. But while that cock was slow the other was picking up in speed. In and out, in and out, small nub-like tentacles rubbing my walls randomly, as though they were massaging my insides, soothing the pain of his penetration and our unnatural, bestial joining.

>>I let out a whimper, but not from pain (though there was still some of that, particularly from my arse) but from a strange pleasure I couldn't identify.

>>My pussy made weird squelching sounds, the precum pumped inside of me getting whipped into a froth inside my stretched sleeve, but then the cock in my arse bottomed out even deeper than the one in my pussy - a ten inches at least, almost to the absurd knot at it's base. Strangely, that cock didn't move, which was was grateful for, but confused by. It just sat there jammed inside while it's tentacle nubs wriggled against my walls.

>>The beast warbled, sounding content, and I finally started getting used to the filling feeling of a Graphorn double penetration.

>>Then the cock in my pussy dug deep, right up to my cervix, and I could feel something unexpected happening. It's slender tip splitting open, unfurling into even more tentacles which covered my cervix.

Ooophhhhfgg!?!

>>He groaned atop me and I felt more precum gush inside but since he had sealed the exit with his unfurled tip it had nowhere to go but deeper, and I felt my stomach distend from the amount of precum poured directly into my uterus...

>>Something was coming…

>>My eyes were wide, and I whipped my head back and forth, trying to see what was happening around me, trying to escape this building sense of dread, but pinned as I was it was a doomed effort, and then I heard the Graphorn... Purring... And for the first time it moved it's lower body, not just its prehensile tentacle cocks, but it wasn't thrusting into me, more like clenching it's muscles and then relaxing them. Over and over and over. It's tentacle nubs we're wriggling like crazy and the pain was fading fast, being replaced by a shame-filled pleasure. The light glowing through my body was picking up in intensity, enough to where I could see it's soft glow from herey head was hidden away...

>> Then it came.

>>The beasts cock undulated inside me and I felt the section of shaft near my entrance balloon out suddenly like a dog's knot, but it didn't stay there, undead that strange balloon slid deeper inside. Inch by inch, until I felt something hard mix with the sensation of those unfurled tentacles covering my deepest parts. It pushed, hard, insistently, and I grity teeth - feeling its journey had allowed me to brace for it, but it still didn't feel good and I found myself gripping the Graphorn's muscular legs as what could only be an egg slid through my cervix and deposited itself into my uterus..

>>Two more times did an egg fall passed my now loosened cervix and into my uterus, making three lumps appear in my distended belly, and though I was kicking my legs, I knew what had just happened.

>>I had just been bred by a Graphorn.

Please please please...

>>I begged lowly of the Mark glowing in Ravenclaw blue on my pelvis - neutralize it, PLEASE!!

Of course the Graphorn didn't know or care about the inner struggle of a human woman forcibly impregnated by one of a different species entirely, and simply pulled first his cock from my twitching and sore ass, leaving a gaped hole in its wake, before the cock in my pussy closed itself again and withdrew with a wet-sounding...

*SSHLOOOOORRRRP!*

>>The Poachers cheered even as I felt myself starting to cry again. Shame burning through me. I hid my face in some of the straw and sobbed as I leaked a small lake's worth of precum.

>>Finally the Graphorn moved off me, though I wished he wouldn't because I didn't want to be seen and his bulk had provided at least a little bit of a shield for the tattered remains of my dignity.

>>The beast moved over to me and sniffed at my face, his facial tentacles caressing my cheeks and nose before he sat down, curled up next to me, almost protectively.

>>"Well that was a show'n a half weren't it Lads?"

>>I managed to move just enough to see the Bitch approach, still holding my wand. She pointed it at me through the bars of the cage and next to me the Graphorn stirred, making a low, threatening warble, but the Poacher leader scoffed and shouted out, "You turn around and face me properly when I kill you -Flipendo!"

>>I felt the beam of magic hit me and flip me forcibly from my stomach to my back, legs spilling open and showing off my ruined holes to every poacher in the tent... If they hadn't been distracted by the Graphorn suddenly glowing gold along its powerful chest and spiked shoulders. Its warbles turned into a roar and the poachers started attacking it through the bars, trying to subdue it, but it charged forward, ramming its golden horns into the reinforced iron bars with an unearthly cacophony.

>>The lead Poacher snarled in the beast's face and forced it back with a spell from my wand, but it moved to hunch over me protectively, raising its great scaled tail with its spiked 'mace' like plating and then that devastating looking natural weapon glowed gold and it whipped it towards the bars, shattering them into shrapnel that hit like a cannon-blast, killing the Bitch instantly, but before I could capitalize, to try and summon my wand to my hand, the Beast was through the opening he made and was tearing through the remaining Poachers, their screams filling the tent and bringing a smile to my face.

>>Suddenly I remembered a lesson from my Creatures Class *Graphorns mate for life, and once impregnated, the male will protect their female until death.*

Huh...

>>I said, leaning back in the hay to watch my revenge played out at the horns and spiked tail of a hacked off Graphorn.

Guess I have a Graphorn now. Wonder where I'll keep it?

The End
