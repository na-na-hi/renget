### -> /chastegen/ Lock Tracker <-

##### Some Suggestions when making a lock
1. Keep the vote times reasonable to how long you want to be locked up. __You will currently get about 7-10 votes per day if you share the lock in chastegen__.
1. Chaster has finally added a feature to "limit lock time" when you create a lock. This is a hard-deadline for a lock where time cannot be added that brings you over it. __Make use of it__.


##### Currently Tracked locks
_(Updated 26-Dec-2023)_

!!! note
    - Locks will be tracked in thread and here until you unlock/abandon, OR until a custom time you give is reached (in date or threads)
    - __Need to update or remove your lock from the list?__ Post in thread (preferred), or message me on [chaster](https://chaster.app/user/Delv) or [Discord](https://discord.com/users/230024106400022528).
