### -> /chastegen/ Lock Tracker <-

##### Some Suggestions when making a lock
1. Keep the vote times reasonable to how long you want to be locked up. __You will currently get about 10 votes per day if you share the lock in chastegen__.
1. Chaster has finally added a feature to "limit lock time" when you create a lock. This is a hard-deadline for a lock where time cannot be added that brings you over it. __Make use of it__.

!!! note
    Locks will be tracked in thread and here until you unlock/abandon, OR until a custom time you give is reached (in date or threads)
