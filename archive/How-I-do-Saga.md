- What I know:
= Retires: You get three at the start, so you can't spam them like a slot machine from my guess. The dev is just one man, after all. Every 10 messages (from both you and the bot) you get three more. You can also delete the AI message and copy and paste your own into the 'enter your prompt' box and click enter. It's like a free retry. Doesn't add another message unless you edit it in the prompt box in any way, then you delete your message and enter the new one in.
= Models: GPT-3.5 has baked in censorship and positive bias, which can mess with the scene (Want to grope your OniGF? GET THE FUCK OFF ME NORMIEEEEEEEEEEE https://youtu.be/j5CBhPDQDr4?t=133) Not to mention it's limited to 50 responses, unlike the other models. Jurassic Jumbo and its instruct variant has treated me well. At the start of a conversation, I have Jumbo Instruct selected since it helps move things along. After a certain amount of time, I switch to Jumbo default since the instruct effect isn't needed anymore. I do switch back and forth depending on if I get repetition problems or am just curious.

- To be pasted in "Inspect Context" on the right side menu.
This is a text role playing game (or sometimes 'story') set in the "Xworld" world. XWorldDescription It plays like interactive fanfiction.(usually remove if I put 'story' before). It is a conversation with XCharacter. XCharacter—XCharacterdescription.
XCharacter always replies in the first-person! Always reply from her POV when talking. (If you want the character to write in first person. Takes a few retires, or you could just edit it into first person. Had a great time with this, even when I reply in first person. You could just delete this line too)
The plot always advances. Unexpected events may occur. This is an engaging, thrilling story. Continue the following story with lengthy and descriptive dialogue and action!
(Sometimes I like to put a Summary: if things progress far enough)

Here it is without the notes:

- My current settings for both models:
Temperature: 1-1.09 (Maybe 1.2 depending on how creative/schizo I want the AI to get. Can sometimes generate gold and new words I catalog for later, or shit that needs a retry)
Top-P: 0.9
FrequencyPenalty: 3-14 (Depending on how far I am in the story. Helps with preventing new lines, but don't push it up too early. Wait until there's enough in the context)
PresencePenalty: 0.20-0.50 (Same as above in that don't push it up too early)
