##### `Whuffa and the Wise Shaman`
> Be me, village shaman and keeper of knowledge for my tribe
> Sitting in my hut, communing with the ancestral spirits
> Damn, that’s some good spirit herb
> Pondering why the ancestors want me to seek salted meats when I hear someone approach my hut
> “Great shaman! I seek your wisdom!”
> Sky spirits preserve me, I know that voice
> “You may enter.” I say
> Whuffa enters, carrying her new weird furless husband under her arm
> Why did I ever allow them to get married? I was way too enlightened that night
> “Great shaman.” Whuffa bows her head, “Something strange is happening to my husband!”
> She holds her squirming husband out to me, who struggles and yells something in his weird language
> He looks just as bizarre as ever, so I don’t really see the problem
> “I’m not sure I-“
> “His face!” Whuffa interrupts me, “Look at his face! It’s growing fur!”
> Well damn, look at that. She’s right. There’s hair growing on his face
> “What does it mean?” Whuffa whines
> I use my sacred pipe to seek more ancestral wisdom

> “He is becoming one with the tribe.” I let the spirits guide my words, “Soon, he will truly become one of us.”
> Whuffa gives me a blank look
> By the deeds of my forefathers, come on
> “He’s turning into a wolf.” I explain
> “What?? No!” Whuffa cries, crushing her husband in a protective hug. Poor guy is turning blue. “I like him this way! Is there anything I can do to stop it??”
> I’m going to need some serious enlightenment for this one. I refill my pipe with sacred herbs, and draw deep from the font of knowledge
> The wisdom of my ancestors flows through me
> “He must preserve his natural essence within himself,” I fill the room with smoke, “and refrain from joining his spirit with yours.”
> Whuffa just stares again
> “No sex.” I explain
> “Oh! Um… okay.” Whuffa’s ears fold back as she bows. “Thank you for your wisdom, great shaman. I will… try.”
> She leaves, and I let out a deep sigh
> Maybe now half the tribe won’t pester me for sleeping charms and deafness potions
