5 years after the Battle of Mizra. https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Mizra

The Republic has retreated to the Core. The Sith Lord that masterminded Mizra has been killed (probably by PCs). It's a free for all outside the Core filled with squabbling Sith, Mercenaries of all stripes, and Jedi have just started taking up the mantle of feudal lords to bring order to star systems.

Band together with other Anons to conquer the galaxy or whatever. Ideally we'll all be part of a couple of factions whatever they end up being, probably Clones/Jedi/Etc vs Sith/Droids/Etc but whatever works depending who makes commanders and stuff.

>New Perk for non-force sensitive characters.
>"Minor Force Talent"
>[-20 Points]
>You have some Force sensitivity after all! It's not on the level of a trained Jedi, but there are some tricks you know.
>You get access to the Basic Force Powers section, but unlike Jedi, you can't use those you do not purchase. You can purchase each power twice; the first purchase gives you a basic proficiency with it equal to the default for Jedi; the second purchase brings it up to a level of a Jedi character that purchased it. Your first two purchases in this section are free.
