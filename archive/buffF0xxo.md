Totally Not a Bottom by anonymous

>have fox roommate
>absolutely detests the sex crazed, submissive and “breedable” vixen stereotype.
>bulks up just because he doesn’t want to look “femboyish”.
>shows off when girls are around, tries to give advice on how to get girls, joins parties to try and get laid.
>it gets annoying hearing him boast about how many girls he has “scored”.
>you’ve never actually seen him get with a girl before or even bring one into the apartment.
>one day you receive a package for the fox. It was a suspiciously long box that read “6in human dil-
>the muscular fox bumps into you causing you to drop the box.
>”w-whoops sorry anon. Oh, l-look at that, a package for me! Thanks for getting it anon bye!”
>he quickly swiped the box away, covering it with his arms, and slammed the door to his room. What was that all about?
>a few days later, you walk in on him eagerly riding the dildo
>he's horribly embarrassed and tries to cover his raging hard-on with his tail
>"A-anon! It's not what it looks like bro, I swear!"
>"T-the latest science says that prostate stimulation is a great natural testosterone booster! I'm just doing this for the gains!"
>you decide to play along and pretend you've heard of this too
>but you "correct" him by explaining that it doesn't work if you're tensed up
>the proper way to do it is to lay on your stomach in a relaxed position while a "workout buddy" performs the "massage" for you
>next thing he knows, he's blowing his load into the mattress while you work the dildo in and out of him
>you tell him not to worry, "involuntary" ejaculation is a sign that it's working
>you promise to continue helping him out with this after each of his workouts from now on
>he's too flustered to talk his way out of it
>the totally-not-a-bottom fox himbo starts out very shy about the new after-workout prostate massages
>you help sell the idea by also giving him a full-body rubdown
>explaining that you've been wanting to learn massage therapy and thanking him for the opportunity to practice
>it doesn't take long before he's completely addicted to the regular petting and prostate orgasms, of course
>that's when you tell him that you read that actually, turns out dildos might not be the best method
>it'd be healthier and more effective for you to start using your fingers directly on his prostate
>judging by how much he's been filling his condoms (which he only wears to avoid dirtying the sheets), you're right
>a bit later during a "massage session", he nervously "jokes" about that one primitive tribe that believes that masculinity/virility can be transferred through insemination
>"what a crazy idea, right anon? bruh, maybe we should try it to see if it helps my gains lol"
>"aha ha... just kidding... that would be gay... unless...?"
>you lie and say you’ve also heard about it.
>you ask him if he wants to try.
>He nervously squeaks out a “yes”.
>you tell him that the primitive tribe did it on all fours.
>he slowly rises up from the bed and covers his hole with his tail.
>holy shit, how did you and the hunky fox get this far!
>you tell him to lift up his tail, to which he obediently complies.
>you explore his muscular back and slowly slide your hands down his sides causing him to wiggle a bit and shudder out a breath. You reach his butt and give a light grope to both cheeks causing him to yipe and cover his snout with both hands.
>he was already hard and leaking out pre from the touching.
>so much for being “masculine”.
>thanks to your “massage session”, his tail hole was already lubed and stretched out, but just to be sure, you smeared some live on your aching erection.
>on your first push, you were met with little resistance and completely hilted him. >the big vulpine’s back arched and his ears spiked.
>he let out a muffled whine through his clasped snout and you wanted to hear more.
>you lean over him and whisper into his ear.
>”c’mon, let it out. Don’t you want those gains~”
>his hands were still clamped around his snout. His face was flushed red and eyes shut.
>you gave a few more pumps of encouragement while soothing him by saying how moaning was the masculine way for showing you liked it.
>with each pump came a louder muffled moan until he finally let go of his grip and started to pant and moan out loud.
