Chapter 5: Peaceful Everyday Life
Yu: Acorns rolling all around, rolling all around~. It looks like autumn is here, doesn't it? The breeze feels so nice.
Ch: Hm.
Yu: Gun-chan, don't look at me. Look at the scenery in the distance, the scenery! It's good for your eyes.
Ch: Uh-huh.
Ta: ~~
Ch: Hm?
Ta: You expected a cat? Too bad! It was Tama!
An: Tamacchi-senpai, wait for me! Walking up to Marugame Castle isn't easy either...
Ta: Anzu, I've found Yuuna and Chikage! I knew they'd be on the site of the moon viewing tower!
Ch: ...
An: The main keep is Wakaba-san's favorite, so I suppose this is your favorite place, Yuuna-san?
Ch: ...What do you want?
Ta: We went into town and bought dango.
An: Would you like to have tea together?
Yu: Good idea, sounds great! Right, Gun-chan?
Ch: ...Yeah.
Ta: Now we just need Wakaba and Hinata. If we talk like this...
Wa: Oh, it's so lively over there.
Hi: Please let us join.
An: ...Wakaba and Hinata will come, right?
Yu: Mmh, those dango are delicious! And these monaka too!
An: They're a local specialty here.
Yu: Huh. I think these are the best monaka I ever had.
Wa: Yuuna, you're from Honshuu, right?
Yu: Yeah.
Wa: You like udon and honetsukidori, and even the sweets you're eating. You've perfectly adjusted to Kagawa's food.
Yu: That's because udon and such are really delicious. I was really surprised.
Ta: Yuuna, where in Honshuu are you from?
Yu: Ehehe. It was pretty much in the sticks. Whoa, I'm getting sleepy.
Ta: Must be because we ate so much. It feels so good...
Ch: You're right... I'm sleepy.
Yu: Hahaha! How about we sleep here?
Wa: That might not be too bad once in a while.
An: It sure is peaceful when we can all sleep together.
Yu: But I'm glad we have this peace.
Ta: For real, those Vertex are up to no good at all, but deep down I know it's thanks to them that carefree times like these are so precious to me.
Ch: All we have to do is take these times back. By defeating them all.
Wa: You're right. Let's do that.
Yu: And to achieve that goal... how about we take a nap now?
Wa: ...You're right.
Ta: Can someone sing a lullaby? To maximize the element of surprise... Chikage!
Ch: You may go in, you may enter, which way is this narrow pathway?*
Ta: Gloomy!
An: I think I'll get nightmares from this.
Hi: Hushabye, hushabye! My good baby, sleep!**
Ta: Hinata, this is soothing~.
Ch: Falling asleep already~...
Hi: Where did my boy's baby-sitter go? Beyond that mountain, back to her home.
Yu: This makes you sleepy~...
An: It's drawing me in~...
Wa: Amazing... Hinata...
Hi: Fufufu. Sweet dreams, Heroes. See you tomorrow.
