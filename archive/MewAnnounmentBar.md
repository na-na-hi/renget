- I don't know how long it will take for me to finish Chapter 11-15 but let's hope for less than 5 hours! I've gotten the hang of it, and today i'll try to use more flash bolts for sneak kills.
- I do need to gather some materials too for my MINECRAFT house so i don't drag out the whole portion of the stream picking blocks later. But it will be a very chill low energy stream for sure. Still haven't figured out i wanna build my house yet too!

[20220617] mew procrastinates on minecraft starter home (MHIgDiZtC_M)
- Hello Earthlings!
- I'm incredibly happy that we've completed THE EVIL WITHIN! In all honesty at first viewed is a stepping stone or THE EVIL WITHIN 2 because that was what i actually wanted to stream. I thought it was weird to jump to straight into the sequel so i just wanted to get over with TEW but i ended up really loving the game! Almost to the point i feel sorry for anyone who gave up on it! It's so good! 
- I'll be rinning an endurance for the DLCs then jumping in TEW2. I'm too excitd for TEW2! Sorry if yall preferred me do something else first lol. Thos os what i wanna do!
- For today's MINECRAFT i;ll just be doing some simple starter house and some herding!

[20220618] the lord shall condemn me if i don't save them all | DETROIT: BECOME HUMAN (lNVjUzhiCxM)
- Hello Earthlings!
- I'm still adamant on wanting to save everyone and make lives for the androids better. NO VIOL3NCE. If i fail to save someone i will have real repercission.
- Today i'll be switching over to controller soince it felt better in THE QUARRY. I'm not very adept with the controller and DETROIT's QTE are intense so i might miss a few ): But i won't give up!
- Youtube is still eating my views and while that makes me sad, i'm looking forward to next week. 
- I'll also be joining GENSHIN today, but only for a bit since i;ll be late due to prior appontments.
- I'll be playing A PLAGUE TALE: INNOCENCE next week!

[20220620] THE EVIL WITHIN DLC ENDURANCE RUN (5il-zZgH22k)
- Hello Earthlings! 
- I'll try to be as effecient as i can for this run and make stream as short as possible. Not sure ow that's gonna go with me plating this first time but let's try!
- I'm seeinng some gifted members renewing membership and i really appreciate that! Every little bit helps and this makes me really happy!
- Incoming A PLAGUE TALE and for that as well i'll try my best to make the run as short as possible since we're only going to have 2-part stream for playthrough.
- I've gotten my views nerfed TWICE by YOUTUBE for my past 3 uploads (VODs) and that made me a bit cranky yesterday. I'm feeling a bit better today and i just wanna keep the momentum for now.

[20220622] mew is best oneesan | A PLAGUE TALE: INNOCENCE (xrMDy7Pmtew)
- Hello earthlings!
- If we manage to get to chapter 7 by more or less the 3rd hour i'll have this game done in 2 parts, else i'll break it down into 3 parts instead. I'm looking to complete up till Chapter 8-9 today, depending on our time.
- Jumping onto A PLAGUE TAKE: INNOCENCE from THE EVIL WITHING is quite a change but i'm sure we'll do fine :)
- It's almost end of the month now and i'm kinda looking forward to our next karaoke stream!
- YOUTUBE is still nerfing my views and bossman tells me it's fine but really it kills my momentum with the inconsistenct. I'm still very grateful and i'll work hard towards nexе month. GROUP HUG.

[20220623] casual talk about VTuber and PvZ stocks: invest wrong and YOU DIE. (QnGj6vx-2ns)
- Hello earthlings!
- A PLAGUE TALE was honestly a blast for me! I can't wait to complete the game!
- I honestly have no idea what's ahead cos what happens later on is way beyond any spoiler, review video and the game trailer that i've seen so fat! WAKU WAKU
- Today it's just casual MEW day. Am wearing glasses because i love my glasses. MEW is too piviliged to have regenerative powers and don't need glaases but i just love how casual it looks!
- Am recording something right now and IDK when it's coming out but i hope very soon! I don't put out music as much as ATHY so everytime i do it it's so much more exciting for me!

[20220625] doom befalls me if i fail to save even one | DETROIT: BECOME HUMAN (KEgL4Gfzmdk)
- Hello Earthlings!
- The impromptu zatsudan stream the other day was very insightful and i've decided to do more Vtuber things including more zatsudan streams. I've always only wanted to do more streamer stuff beside the occasional music releases but i think i should take more initiatives to be a proper Vtuber.
- I do have plans to grow my channel and they're gonna take time becaise i don't do music but i hope YOUTUBE doesn't hinder my gworth with the random unsubbing like it's still been oding.
- Today will be INTENSE. If i cry on screen, i cry. I'm not going to hold back my emotions. I'm RAW like fresh sushi you deserve.

- I'm having a rough morning today so i hope it doesn't affect too much. Work has been difficult lately and i', not getting as much sleep but i hope next will a bit better. Not like my usual sleeping times are sufficient either but it's at least better than it has been this week lol.

- I posterd zankyosanka at wrong time!!!! And last night when i was trying to nap i remembered I COULD HAVE SET A PREMIERO!! I counldn't sleep after. I just through it was just a raw live singing clip so i didn't thnk much about when i should post it etc. That sort of backfired because the video isn't etting much traction. SAD. It's not a high effort video but i hope you like it at least! :')
- Today we're just gonna chill so i don't have to use my brain a lot. I heard someone said this game "makes dark souls look like a kiddie run carrying a doll around" but it doesn't fill like a solid comarison lol!
- Anyway i hope y'all be having a great day!

- I will be taking 11 days off in August! I will announce the dates around end fo this month but i'm looking forward to a good vacay trip! I'm going island hopping yay! It won't be long vefore i'm back and i'll have a few videos schediled to be posted so i hope you don't miss me too much HEHE
- It means more work for me this month but it will be worth it! I'm also doing another recording rn for another song so it will be out by then hopefully.
- Tommorow we'll be playing RESIDENT EVIL 2! Exciting! I think comparing to this game RESIDENT EVIL games are more run-and-gun but i hope i don't stumble too much doing the pizzles.

- Hello Earthlings!
- I can't wait to complete THE EVIL WITHIN 2 and get started on something else! What should we play next? Maybe we can talk about it during TUESDAY MEWSDAT next week!
- I've been thinking about MADISON or FOBIA but after watching the reviews they don't feel like something i would enjoy as much.
- I spent 30 mind doing something else end trying to thhink up something to write here but i'm just burnt. I have a lot of non-disclosable happenings/feelings and right now i'm just very much looking forward to tommorow.
- KARAOKE STREAM is coming up next weekend! I hope i have time to learn the remaining songs i have in my setlist lol

- Hello Earthlings!
- I couldn't sleep well and dreamed about this game lol. Was counting down the minutes till stream starts. This game just feels intimidating somehow. I read a few tips for new RE2 players and maybe i'll stick by them until i get the hang on it. Generally i want to have fun but knowing RE games are more management than being a badass, it'll probably be more stressful than TEW2.
- I've gone out for a bit yesterday for some house maintenance stuff and touched grass for a little bit. I used to feel better after touching grass but now it's just ok.
- One of my humans said "I bet you dream of work when you sleep: and i feel sad. I do in fact dream of work but i can't control it.
