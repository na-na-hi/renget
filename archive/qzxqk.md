**Face:** A slightly round face with no distinguishing marks
**Hair:** As seen in pictures. Short cropped dark brown hair. He keeps it short to make it easier to manage.
**Eyes:** Greenish-brown eyes behind a pair of square black framed glasses.
**Height:** Fairly tall. 6'2" or 74in.
**Bodytype:** An average build, with a slight chub around his mid-section. Not fat, but not lean.
**Complexion:** Smooth skin with no marks or discoloration.
**Uniform variation:** He wears a white collared t-shirt with a blue plaid suit coat over it. His pants match his blue plaid jacket. His unique clothing item is his Ravenclaw House enchanted duster. It shimmers and pules with magic whenever Zach casts spells.
**Misc:** A warm smile and kind eyes that offer a welcoming presence to anyone he meets.

**Voice:** As a Midwestern raised American, Zach can tend to get loud when talking about topics he enjoys.
**Body language:** He talks with his hands often, and his general posture is good. When he's nervous he shrinks his stature to appear shorter than he is.
**Social:** He's made fast friends with Matthew and Haitham, bonding over their shared love of Quidditch. He also considers Garland a friend as the two enjoy listening to music together.
**Visibility:** Being taller than the average student, Zach is fairly easy to spot in a crowd, but he also tends to suffer from "Clark Kent" syndrome, by being so unremarkable that he can blend in.
**Engagement:** He'll happily chat with anyone who approaches him, though he'd never make the first move to talk to a witch he has a crush on.
**Quirks:** Talks with his hands, uses American Wizarding slang like "no-maj".
**Things your character wouldn't do:** He'd never do anything without the other person's consent. He would also never willingly hurt another person and he'd never EVER use the Unforgivables.
**Animals:** He likes magical creatures that are cute and soft. Back home he has a pet dog named Ginger and a pet puffskein named Dragon. His Owl is a Barn owl named Armitage.
**Misc information that might be useful:** Zach is a hopeless romantic. He used to get his hopes up when a girl shows any interest in him, and it often led to heartbreak due to his own inability to recognize that she was just being nice and engaging in common pleasantries. As such, Zach has hardened himself and is oblivious to ACTUAL flirting.
