    >⚡️ A leading source in the #Palestinian resistance factions told Al-Mayadeen:
    >
    >- The goal of our ongoing negotiations in Cairo is to reach an agreement that achieves a permanent ceasefire, the return of the displaced, withdrawal from the #Gaza Strip, and the provision of the needs of our people.
    >
    >- The occupation has not yet given any positive position on stopping the war and does not want to withdraw from the #Gaza Strip.
    >
    >- The occupation puts the issue of the return of the displaced under negotiation and wants its details to be discussed and achieved gradually.
    >
    >- The occupation does not adhere to what was agreed upon regarding relief, aid, and increasing quantities, and if it agrees, it evades it with flimsy excuses, including inability.
    >
    >- After rounds of dialogue in Cairo with the participation of the #Egyptian and Qatari delegations, the #Hamas movement has become certain that the occupation will not give clear answers to the main issues it requested.
    >
    >-Hamas's main demands, which have not changed, are a ceasefire, complete withdrawal from the #Gaza Strip, and the return of the displaced.
    >
    >- Regarding the issue of withdrawal, #Hamas confirms that the agreement is unclear and ambiguous.
    >
    >- “Israel” offers that the withdrawal take place east of the #Gaza Strip without specifying the locations, and #Hamas demands that it be through clear maps.
    >
    >- In the first stage, #Hamas demands the complete suspension of military operations, provided that the second stage includes discussing a final ceasefire.
    >
    >- The obstacle in the prisoner issue is the numbers requested by #Hamas and rejected by “Israel”.

    >The sales were made even as top US officials and lawmakers increasingly expressed deep reservations about Israel’s military tactics targeting civilians.
