    >
    >- Regarding the issue of withdrawal, #Hamas confirms that the agreement is unclear and ambiguous.
    >
    >- “Israel” offers that the withdrawal take place east of the #Gaza Strip without specifying the locations, and #Hamas demands that it be through clear maps.
    >
    >- In the first stage, #Hamas demands the complete suspension of military operations, provided that the second stage includes discussing a final ceasefire.
    >
    >- The obstacle in the prisoner issue is the numbers requested by #Hamas and rejected by “Israel”.
