otto holy shit i don't know if god blessed you or what but you going on that hiking trip this week was probably the best decision you've ever made in your life.

you remember ansel, the track guy that we occasionally talk to in science class? i don't know what the fuck happened but over the weekend he went from being like the coolest dude ever to just a straight-up loser. it all started on monday when he just didn't show up to class until it was half-way over, at which point he came in looking like some homeless bum. i swear to god the guy walked in with pajama pants, somehow managed to gain like 15 pounds in the span of two days, and was wearing this super crusty t-shirt that very clearly hadn't been washed in a while. he just sat in his chair spaced out til the end of class staring at his phone, only getting up to go to his next class once everybody else had left.

a couple of minutes after i encountered him again in the hallway so i tried to ask him what the fuck was going on and his immediate response was to just try and change topics. everytime i tried to bring the conversation back to figuring out what happened to him he would go on and on about how i should come over to his house after-school, how he wanted to show me "a really cool sonic boom mod with titties in it" and that i'd "become absolutely addicted to it." i'm paraphrasing shit but he would either talk about that or try and (i think) flirt with me repeatedly which absolutely creeped me the fuck out and convinced me to just go straight to my next class.

don't have any classes with him tuesday so i didn't talk with him that day but i heard a couple of rumors that before school started he and his gf ended up getting into a fight cause of all the weird ass shit he was doing the day before. turns out i wasn't the only one that was super creeped out by him, a couple of his friends noticed too, especially when he just didn't show up to track that day. apparently they tried to schedule some sort of intervention with him and his gf.

it went about as well as you'd expect.

seems like he's a fucking addict now cause during the intervention everytime his gf talked he'd just cut her off and start talking about that sonic boom porn mod i mentioned earlier. she eventually ended up breaking up their relationship when after a thousand times of begging him to listen to what she's saying he just started making these weird ass sexual comments to some of the other people there.

i tell you man, the guy just became a nut overnight. even if you told him that his parents died i bet you a million dollars he'd either try and get you to download that god damn boom porn mod or he'd tell you to come over to his house so that you could play it on his pc.

anyway wednesday comes, similar to monday shows up late as hell to science class looking even worse, spends the rest of the period again just mindlessly browsing his phone but unlike last time i'm waiting for my opportunity to strike and thank god it does.

teacher tells him to speak with her in the hallway while the rest of the class starts working on their assignment and i take this opportunity to immediately snatch his phone from his desk to see what he's looking at. turns out his brainlessness stretches to his phone's security so just tapping 1 a couple of times on his phone's lock screen lets me in. was hoping that searching through his phone would reveal what the fuck is going on with him and christ did it do that and much more.

dozens and dozens of porn tabs all on his browser. some of the stuff on top was more generic but the further i scrolled down the most disgusting it got. transvestites, shit and piss play, sexually harassing people publicly, various videos of people actually being raped. i felt like i was about to puke so i immediately tabbed out but i swear the descriptions of the the tabs at the bottom were advertising videos of "illicit acts with children."

took a bit to gain my composure after that but with little time i had left before he came back i went through his messages in hopes that it'd reveal something a little more tangible about why he's acting so strange.

hundreds, and i do mean hundreds, of various conversations he's had with people over the past couple of days. a few of them are with people that i know from my school but the vast majority are with random ass people i have never heard of in my life. from what i've gathered some of them are people that he knows irl, a couple online friends that he's had for a while now, a few are just random ass people he met on random sonic forums. thing is though is that all of them always end the same regardless of how the other person is responding. he drops a link to this site and then tells them to check it out.

normalcpmod.xyz

apparently as the site says it's "supposed" to stand for "normal conic porn mod." why it's misspelled i don't know but the rest of the site gives a description of the mod, how it's meant to be a modification of sonic boom for a "more mature audience" that's "sure to enhance your gameplay." there's a couple of images of the mod itself that show a more sexualized version of some of the game's character before ending off the page with a link to download the mod. i didn't click the link cause one i'm on his phone and two with how long i was on phone at that point i knew i was pushing my luck. after that i quickly put his phone back on the desk and christ was it close cause around five seconds later he comes back into class with the teacher a couple of minutes before the bell rang. i don't think he noticed anything cause he just went back to endlessly scrolling on his phone but it made passing him on the way out of class uncomfortably tense.

rest of the day went fine, decided to purposefully avoid him cause i didn't know what to make of all of this but all of this brings us up to now. tomorrow's gonna be thursday so thankfully i don't have any classes with him but jeez am i worried, not just for him but for everybody else around him. yeah, he's absolutely tanking in school now and i'm pretty sure he's lost most if not all of his friends, but whatever that fucking sonic boom mod is it's weird as hell that he's trying to get others hooked on it.

i don't know when you're gonna get back but dude i seriously need your advice. i have no idea what the right decision is to make because i feel like if i act there's a good chance all of this is gonna be even worse.

please, message me back when you get the chance.
