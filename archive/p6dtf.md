#->The Private Elevator<-


Your relatively short time working for Royaltea Inc. had proven to be stressful, intense, overwhelming, punishing, and demanding. You couldn’t remember the last time you had a full night’s sleep, or a proper meal that left you satisfied. Every day featured the same gridlocked commute, rushed lunches, and brutal tasks with impossible deadlines. At least three times a day you would find yourself thinking this would be your last. Whether at the company or in life you didn’t care to clarify. 

You knew you couldn’t quit, though. The pay was simply too good, and with the prices of your rent and Mother’s medical expenses, it needed to be. 

“Just one more day,” you whispered to yourself as you adjusted your tie and entered the towering office building, “and then a million more.”

The main lobby of the Royaltea’s headquarters was an imposing modern design. A massive silver “P” hung on the black marble walls opposite of the entrance. Silver and gold gilded the lobby in an obvious show of power and wealth. It still intimidated you. You knew you were smaller than they were, that you were their inferior, and that they knew it too.
	
Royaltea Inc. was the nation’s leading business conglomerate with practical monopolies over global fishing, literature, feline care, office supply, and spice industries, with additional markets being aggressively recruited and acquired. On any given corner of the Earth it was likely a Royaltea product was within arms reach. The distinctive three blue peafowl feather logo marked the world as theirs.  Even your briefcase and suit were made by members of the Royaltea corporate umbrella. You could never really escape the Royaltea.

And at its head was the CEO of the Royaltea. The Princess herself. Pavolia Reine. Your direct superior and boss. 

Reine quickly made a kingdom and then an empire out of her business. Her ambition, decisiveness, beauty, demand for loyalty, smart business mind, and cruelty were renowned. Reine’s Multiple Enterprise Program had rewritten the book on business and revolutionized modern economic philosophy. All knew to respect her. Or at the very least to fear her. Companies that opposed her rarely lasted the year. And individuals that dared speak out against her and her practices found finding further employment near impossible. 

Royaltea Inc.’s aggressive recruiting had coerced you into the position before you could really understand the ramifications or responsibilities of the job. The allure of the company name and size of the salary had done most of the convincing, but the recruiter, you realized in retrospect, had not mentioned the long hours, immense pressure to perform, and sadistic managers. Or that you would be the personal assistant to the most sadistic of them all.

Maintaining and growing a global empire required constant attention and work, which meant as Reine’s lapdog your tasks never really ended. Crises became a daily occurrence, and it was not enough for you to simply manage them. Reine demanded that you deal with them to the extent that it seemed like they never happened. 

Despite being at her beck and call, it was a rare occurrence that you would actually see the Princess. You had never even been to her office on the top floor. And judging from what you learned from your co-workers it seemed nobody had. All sorts of rumors circulated your office on what could be up there. From managing her schedule you knew she had some sort of meetings up there. At least according to the schedule. You had only ever seen her use the private elevator that led up to her office. Despite the hoards of company executives and political leaders Reine had to deal with, you had never seen them enter or exit that elevator. As you crossed the lobby you thought of all the different supplies you had sent up to Reine’s office. Everything from bed sheets to watermelons and everything in between. 

“Maybe she lives up there,” you mumbled. “Would explain how she always seems one step ahead of me.” 

The private elevator was accessible from the main lobby. You spied it standing unused and solitary. The employees gave it a wide berth, almost as if an evil aura emanated from it. Everyone knew to give Reine her space and that stepping in her way was to brush with death.
 
All part of the job. You had learned to decipher her vague memos detailing her expectations and demands of the day for you, though not without cost. Early in your tenure as Reine’s assistant you had misinterpreted one of her instructions. This mistake earned you a personal visit from the Princess. You had never been so demeaned, so put down, so humiliated in your life. Despite this, the tongue lashing you received from perhaps the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen excited you in ways you never felt before. And the memory of the slight smile and glint in Reine’s eyes had never left you. Despite the very clear anger in her voice and words, the slight blush Reine had when threatening to transfer you to the waste collection department only left you with the impression of how cute she was when she was mad.

You made sure to never make another major mistake, but sometimes you would intentionally make small errors or inconsistencies in your work. Nothing that would actually cause an issue, but something significant enough that Reine would have to respond. Most of the time she would simply communicate through mail or messenger, complete with emojis, but on occasion she would march down to your office and chew you out in front of everyone. Her piercing blue eyes making direct eye contact over her glasses and her blouse open just one button too many made the lecturing worth it, and was currently your only source of pleasure in life.

It was an odd and dangerous relationship with perhaps the most powerful woman in the world, but you just couldn’t stop. You loved to tease her, to bait her into small tirades, all for your own enjoyment. You suspected she was on to your ruse, but if so she did nothing to stop it, and her blush had only gotten more crimson as your kidding got braver.

“I’m really sorry, Ms. Reine, I just figured your reputation and beauty would be enough to seal the acquisition. I’ll put together a proposal at once.” 

You reminisced about your last jest against Reine. She made sure you paid for your remark, but the way her ears turned red in embarrassment and the high pitch her voice reached made it a net positive in the end. 

Smiling to yourself over your past actions, you reached your elevator and waited for an opportunity to get on. So many people used this elevator you would often have to wait for a second or third trip up. Not good. Reine wasn’t the most punctual person in the world, but she did not tolerate tardiness. 

“There you are, assistant. You just can’t help but waste my time, can you?”

The voice seemed to echo in the lobby and your skull. The casual din of morning conversation died out. Everyone did their best to avert their eyes without making it seem like they were doing so. She was here.

#~~~

Pavolia Reine was known for many things, but her ability to demand all the attention in the room was perhaps one of her more underrated traits. Her ferocity alone could achieve this, but her absolute beauty and divine figure removed all doubt.

Her black high heels clacked against the floor as she crossed the lobby straight towards you. Her long legs were in sheer stockings, riding up until her black miniskirt hugged her wide hips and thin waist. Her white button down shirt was half open, and her ample cleavage was on full display. Her hair was short again, dancing on the collar of her shirt. She was also wearing glasses today, you noticed. That meant she had been working. The clipboard in her long, slender fingers also would have clued you in to this, but you had never seen better breasts in your life, and it was taking your full focus to not get caught staring.

It didn’t work.

“Eyes up here, you worthless pig.” You quickly snapped your gaze to meet hers. A sheepish smile betrayed your lips and you struggled to control yourself. You could hear the blood pumping in your ears. 

“Yes, ma’am. Of course, ma’am.”

Reine gave a scowl that could have killed a lesser man.

“Did I ask you to speak? I will let you know when I want to hear your quivering voice.” Reine was starting on you early. Normally you had time to reach your desk before being subjected to this kind of abuse. And in front of so many people as well.

Reine was breathing heavily and her face was quickly reddening. Clearly she was already worked up and slightly disheveled. That would explain why she had three buttons open on her shirt. It did not explain, however, why she was leaning over so much to try to talk down to you. Reine was a tall woman, but not taller than you, and her posture was causing you to look down at face. This not only had the effect of seeing Reine’s face from a new angle, making your heart skip a beat, but also to give you a direct view down the front of her shirt. Reine’s chest was displayed to you like never before, and your blood was hot enough that you dared to steal a glance.

It was glorious, and the microsecond was seared into your retinas, with a million dirty possibilities flashing through your brain. It was obscene just how perfect they were; the shape, size, and weight seemed too good for this world, like a gift from the heavens. 

The view would make working at this place worth it for a while longer, and would make Reine’s current rage bearable.

Unfortunately, she noticed again.

“You insolent little cockroach! Get your mind out of the gutter for one second and try to use that brain of yours! You do have a brain, don't you? Do you understand?” Reine’s voice rose in volume and pitch, and she grabbed your chin and forced your face closer.

Your breath caught in your throat. You had never been this close to her. You could see her petite nostrils flaring in anger, her cheeks rosy in fury, her eyes wide in excitement.

Excitement?

“Y-yes, ma’a-”

“I told you to be quiet! Now, if you can stay focused for a moment maybe I can extract a single iota of use from you. I told you I wanted an increased presence in keris knife production and distribution. I told you I wanted a report on current competitor figures and operations. I told you I wanted you- I wanted you to take some initiative. Well it’s been a week, and what progress have you made? Nothing. I’ve seen no reports and no proposals.”

In actuality, she had told you none of those things. The only instruction you received was a long winded tangent about how she was spending some time with her friend and they were discussing different weapons and how they determined keris knives were the cutest and coolest. Reine didn’t make small talk with you, so you filled in the gaps from the message.

You said nothing, waiting for her to finish speaking. Reine was also quiet, staring at you with an impassioned expression. The silence grew to an awkward length, and the elevator door dinged. You could see the slight twinge of embarrassment on her face as she realized the situation the two of you were in.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?” Reine asked between her teeth. “Do you have a death wish trying to make me look like a fool?”

“You told me I couldn’t speak.”

“Well obviously I want you to talk now,” Reine broke eye contact for the first time. For as cute as she was when she was mad, she was even cuter when she was embarrassed.

“It’s already all taken care of,” you responded calmly.

“What?”

“I'm already finished. You were right. This was the perfect time to expand into that sector. I finished the analysis and we already have started making moves. We should achieve dominant market share within two quarters.”

For the first time since you met her, Reine didn’t know what to say. At this close distance you almost thought you saw her white pupils start to change shape. Her mouth opened, then closed, then did it again. 

After the third time, she finally found her voice, “You already did it? It’s all finalized?”

“That’s what I said, didn’t I?”

Reine looked at the documents on her clipboard again, realizing her mistake. Her mouth opened and closed several more times.

 Maybe it was a result of getting 6 hours of sleep in the last week to finish this deal but you decided to be a little risky. “You know, you almost look like a cute little koi fish when you open and close your mouth like that.”

She stepped on your foot.

“My office. Now. Get in the elevator.”

She let go of your face and dragged you by the tie towards her private elevator. You limped behind, hurried to match her pace. This was new. This was scary. Were you about to die? You couldn’t see her face, but this was not normal. Glancing at the other people in the lobby, it was clear by the looks of shock and confusion this was very unusual. 

Reine let go of your tie long enough to place her thumb on the reader. The doors opened immediately. Instantly she had you on your leash again and dragged you into the elevator.


#~~~

It was a much nicer elevator than what you were used to. No cold metal but soft velvet and wood paneling. You pressed yourself against the back of the elevator and held your briefcase against your chest. Your heart beat faster than before, your fear mixed with curiosity and excitement. Reine pressed the top button of what must have been hundreds on the panel and stood with her back facing you. The elevator quietly hummed as it began its ascent. 

“I am not going to apologize to you,” Reine broke the silence, still not facing you. “I will, however, offer you a form of confession. This is a long elevator ride, and will give us some time and privacy.” 

Her voice was calmer and measured. She was choosing her words carefully as you waited in silence. 

“You did good work on this deal, even if you overstepped your role in doing so. Don’t forget your place under me.”

It may have been the nicest thing she ever said to you in person, though it didn’t feel like praise. 

“Thank you, ma’am. I think”

“Why you… don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing.” Your face paled. “Your little barbs and jokes. Always trying to get me all bothered. This is a very stressful position, you know? Every decision I make affects billions of people's lives. The last thing I need is a plucky little assistant giving me lip.”

“You don’t seem to mind it that much,” you responded, “or else you would have gotten rid of me a long time ago.”

Reine let the comment stand for a moment. “Perhaps so. But only because you serve as a good source for stress relief. As I said, I am under constant stress, as I am sure you are as well. Being able to unload my built up stress on you is as valuable a service as any you provide.”

“Well I’m happy to help, ma’am.”

“I’m sure you are. I see how red and flustered you get when I enter your office space,” Reine wryly commented. You couldn't see her face but you could tell she was grinning. 

“That’s funny. I could almost say the same thing about you,” you shot back. You weren’t sure what this conversation was. You weren’t used to having conversations with Reine at all, let alone in an enclosed space. 

“Like I said," Reine repeated diplomatically, "You provide stress relief.”

Reine stiffened slightly. Clearly she meant more than she said.

“Of all kinds.” You were pushing your luck, but you couldn’t stop now. 

“Indeed. I confess, I have been using you. I don’t apologize for it, but perhaps it was unfair to you. As such, I will offer you some additional benefits and responsibilities.”

Your mind raced, spurred on by her outfit and body. “What did you have in mind, ma’am?”

“Later. This is still a very long elevator ride, and with the knife deal settled my day is now uncharacteristically free. And however well this deal has ended, your failure to properly alert me of its conclusion has led me to perform redundant work all night.” You thought it wise to hold your tongue this time.

“As a result, my back and shoulders are killing me.” She threw her clipboard to the ground. “Why don’t you help me out?”

Reine untucked her shirt and pulled the sleeves off her shoulders, exposing her upper back. She was wearing a strapless bra, and her upper body lay unadorned. Another button was undone to allow for even greater access. Finally, Reine turned her head to stare back at you with one eye. She had a smile you had never seen from her before. 

“Well? Get to work, assistant.”

You froze for a moment too long. Her smile turned into a frown and then she scoffed. She took two steps backwards until she was right in front of you. You dropped your briefcase and it tumbled away into the corner. Your hands hung in front of you with your arms pulled in. Her bare skin was inches away from your fingers. 

“Come on. Please. I need it.”

Reine’s expression was soft now, pleading. She was showing vulnerability for the first time to you. She was literally exposed before you. Her lips almost looked like they were trembling. Her eyes were losing themselves in your face, waiting in anticipation for you to make your move.

“I’ll make it worth it for you.”

#~~~

At her words your hands made contact. Her skin was soft and warm. You couldn’t believe how smooth she felt as you slid your hands across her shoulders. You explored the different muscles and tendons of her body, getting a feel for what elicited a reaction from her.

Her soft hums and moans were music to your ears. You had gotten so used to only hearing anger and scorn from this voice, so hearing the soft sounds of bliss was causing a cognitive dissonance in your brain. The mix of emotions was having an effect on your body, as did the smell of her perfume, as you were acutely aware of the distance between Reine and your hips. 

You dug into Reine’s shoulder blade and she let out a loud moan. 

“Mmm, yes, right there. Ooooh give it to me deeper.”

The subtext was now gone. This was now explicitly erotic. You doubled your efforts, placing one hand on the top of her shoulder so you could leverage your thumb harder into her shoulder blade. A higher pitched yelp came out of Reine. Her noises were intoxicating. You needed more. You needed her more. 

"Harder! Harder! Yes! Yes! Ugh, don't stop..."

You switched sides, attacking her other shoulder blade. This was even more effective and evoked a more physical reaction out of Reine. A shot of electricity went up her spine, causing her to bend over. Pinned in by your hand on her shoulder, her hips shot backwards, thrusting her butt directly into your crotch. You were already rapidly hardening, but your cock suddenly nestling itself between Reine’s tightly clothed cheeks brought you to full mast.

A moan escaped your throat. Serving Reine had taken up the majority of your time while at this company. Every late night, early morning, and thankless task. This was much better.

Reine arched her back up, keeping her rear firmly pressed against you. A satisfied hum sounded out of her smirking lips as she started to grind against your crotch. The fabric of her skirt, the proximity of her body, the smell of her hair, they were all threatening to overwhelm you and turn you into an animal. Your fingers dug into Reine’s back, determined to wrest every moan and tremor out of her. A part of you saw this as payback for all the abuse she put you through. But with her soft ass hugging your cock, you didn’t have time to think about the past.

You put both hands at the base of her neck where it met the shoulders. With all the force and discipline you could muster you slowly, tenderly, yet firmly brought both hands down her spine, pulling her shirt off her back and arms. Reine responded positively, letting out a loud cry as she felt the tension in her body dissipate. You ended with both of your hands on her hips, pulling her into you and rocking your hips into her. She pushed her back up against your chest, turning her face to find yours, your lips scant centimeters away from each other. 

The taboo added to the situation, as well as the knowledge that you knew you would both get away with it. Reine was in control. Her rule was law. And here she was like putty in your hands.

You spun her around. You wanted her lips, her breasts, her stomach, her whole body and was afraid when the elevator reached the top this would all disappear. 

You leaned in to kiss her, but she skilfully dodged, pinning you to the wall and licking your ear to whisper, “Mmm, I really liked that. But I can feel you need more stress relief than I do. Don’t worry, it’ll be good for me too.” 

She accented these words by grabbing your hard dick, playfully rubbing it through your pants. 

Once again, Reine proved why she was in control. 

Never taking her hand off your cock in order to keep it hard, Reine slid her way down your body, getting down on her knees before you.

The most powerful woman you’ve ever met, on her knees and removing your belt. 

The whirlwind of emotions and sensations blew through your brain, creating an almost out of body experience. Reine had your belt off in record time, and pressed her face against your package as she slowly pulled down your pants. 

“I’ll be your good little cock slut until we reach my office. After that, who knows?” Reine purred as she fondled your dick through your underwear. She made eye contact with you once more before pulling your underwear down and letting your cock spring out in front of her face. From there, she only had eyes for one thing.

Reine ran her eyes along the length of your cock, her hungry expression keeping you rock hard. She gently ran her fingers up and down your shaft, her touch electrifying. She was playing with you, and as much as you wanted to grab her by the back of the head and gag her on your cock you felt compelled to let her have her way with you. 

She didn’t make you wait long. She engulfed half your dick at once. You yelled out in pleasure. Her lips made a tight seal around your shaft and she used her tongue to swirl around your head. She was just testing the waters, seeing how you would squirm. A quick glance at the elevator panel told you you didn’t have very long left, but you didn’t think you would need it. 

You put one hand on Reine’s head, urging her to be more aggressive. She was one step ahead of you. Also sensing the end of the ride, she began to blow you in earnest. She bobbed her head back and forth along your dick, each time moving a little further down your length. Her tongue was relentless, continually licking at different spots, identifying and exploiting all your weaknesses. 

“Oh god, Reine, just like that,” you gasped as both you and the elevator neared the end. 

Reine didn’t respond, only picked up her pace. Your dick was now hitting her throat, forcing out obscene noises. Undeterred, Reine forced your meat deeper down her throat, shoving it all the way down to the hilt. 

“Reine…ma’am..I’m gonna…I’m almost”

Reine finally looked up to lock eyes with you. She never stopped sucking, but the look in her eyes told you everything you needed to know. With what felt like a scream you unloaded your cum down Reine’s throat, filling her mouth. Reine grasped onto the back of your legs, ensuring she took every rope you let out. 

You don’t know how long it took, but eventually your climax subsided and Reine eased her mouth off of your dick. She kept her lips tight around you to keep anything from spilling until she pulled off with a loud pop. She opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue to show you she still had all your cum, then closed her mouth, swallowed, and stuck out her tongue again, showing it was all gone. It was the hottest thing you’d ever seen. You could only try to catch your breath as you leaned against the wall. 

She stood but didn’t bother to put her shirt back on. A moment later the elevator dinged and the door opened. She left everything on the floor and walked into her office.

“I hope you enjoyed that. I have a few more similar matters I would like to discuss with you. This way. Now."

You obediently followed, happy and willing to serve your CEO.
