###Kiyo aggie lore 2023-11-06

!!!note fern
	i wonder, would there be any reaction out of kiyo from seeing ciel
!!!note elm
	"Dad?!"
!!!note booker
	lol elm
	inb4 ciel is actually kiyo's long lost father
!!!info kiyo
    my gut reaction is that he would react negatively
    And either just avoid ciel or try to impress him and bond to fill the hole of parental figure
    But it'd be ugly either way I think :o
    @booker that would be cruel lol
!!!note fern
	just a big old brother
	tease the little keokeo
!!!note booker
	\>kiyo longs for a father/mother figure in his life ... interesting

	I would be more curious about Cassie's reaction lol
!!!info kiyo
    @linoone now THATS a question :)!
    Cuz Cassie hasn't seen a Ninetales before.  I think she'd get blushy about Kiyo potentially evolving to be handsome
    actually, scratch that lol
    I just remembered she saw the alolan Ninetales mural underneath the guild
!!!note linoone
	true!
!!!note vulq
	That's just a mural, tho, not real life.
!!!info kiyo
	True vulq true

!!!note vulq
	And here I thought Cassie would freak out over how fluffy Ciel's tales are.
!!!info kiyo
	@vulq also true!!! But Kiyo's are pretty much nearly equally soft, just a little smaller :)

!!!note linoone
	hahahha nicee
	 wait
	 "to be handsome"
	 excuse me, Kiyo is already handsome!!!
!!!info kiyo
	@line Kiyo would like to believe that he's handsome but to Cassie he's pretty much just cute
!!!note linoone
	Dang... he's in the cutezone...

!!!note booker
	does cassie humor him and call him handsome?
!!!info kiyo
	@booker sometimes for sure :]

!!!info kiyo
	secret lore is that Cassie had a mega crush on Kiyo when they first met but it went away pretty quick, and now they both see each other as siblings alongside Bean
	just had to sink that ship before anyone got any ideas cough cough line >;]
!!!note linoone
	omg
	I love that secret lore
	 imagine
	Cassie trying to impress Kiyo to win his heart :>
	They hold hands after robbing a blind caterpie :>. Then they have a lil kid they name Bean
