A saner approach to growth over time.
Just a crazy lady moving into an abandoned manor in the middle of Hebinier and getting consumed by her work while talking to spirits most non-fey can't see.
This is actually something I've been meaning to make for awhile; Eden if I were taking things a little more seriously instead of trying to be entertaining for the RP.
A slower, smaller, more stable start with less responsibilities and no banes that end up hurting someone else like Adoring Fan does.
I may change some things up at some point to make it more plausible that I make the [Service] and [Servant] as part of my [Metamorphosis], possibly by [Hero]ing Alchemy or by bumping up [Smithing] to three.
That said, the Servant and the Player have a lot of intentional overlap because I intend to Demon Core fuse with my, "other self," and I think that will help smooth that out.
It's less of a powergrab, and more of a, "I want to be a comfy treehouse," kind of thing.
