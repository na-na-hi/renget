[21:49]<Spaghetti Womna>i'm fucking certain i didn't have a sonic oc, else i'd remember it
[21:49]<Deleted User>You probably had one but forgot about it lol
[21:49]<Deleted User>Or just blocked it out from your mind due to embarrassment
[21:49]<Deleted User>I'm pretty sure Zvinne, Shine nad me are the only people here who look back on their Deviantart OC autism days fondly

[21:51]<Deleted User>Actually, you know what, fuck it. Im gonna dig up my old DA account and snoop around to see if there's anything there to prove you guys had OCs
[21:52]<Jggy>dew it
[21:52]<Jggy>it's gonna be funny
[21:54]<$hine>good luck with that i guess

[22:02]<Deleted User>Pretty sure I did once
[22:02]<$hine>hm
[22:02]<$hine>can you give us a quick rundown on him still
[22:02]<Deleted User>Oh boy
[22:04]<Deleted User>So basically I REALLY hated OCs that I thought were too powerful, so I made one to counter them. Dude essentially was a grim reaper-type figure that would instakill anyone I didn't like.
[22:04]<Deleted User>Pretty sure I even gave him a big fuckoff scythe at some point to complete the look too.
[22:05]<Deleted User>Anyway
[22:05]<Deleted User>Zvin, what was your DA handle? I forgot

[22:23]<Deleted User>It's gone for me too now, what the hell?
[22:23]<Zvinne77>DA doesn't want us to see our old shames, it seems
[22:23]<Deleted User>That image was weird too
[22:23]<Deleted User>Like it was super well drawn, and was just your hedgehog guy, looking
[22:23]<Deleted User>despondent, would be the right word I guess
[22:24]<Jggy>creepypasta
[22:26]<Deleted User>Ok what the fuck. I just got a PM on DA from myself, subject "Why are you here?", no message.
[22:26]<Deleted User>I click on my profile, the deviation of my guy gets replaced with a completely black rectangle
[22:26]<Deleted User>No title, no desc
[22:27]<Deleted User>Wait I F5'd and NOW it has a desc
[22:27]<Deleted User>"Why did you come back?"
