#A date with foxanon

>Everything is hot and it's hard to breathe, you are lost in thought, you still didn't figure out if he is just messing with you
>"ARE YOU DOING OKAY?" the loud voice directed at you takes you out of your thoughts
>You look up at object blocking out most of the sun which is a head of the fox looking worried
>You shout that it's alright and give thumbs up
>You don't know if he heard exactly what you are saying or if he saw exact gesture you were making, unlikely considering your size, but seeing you respond in any way was most likely enough for him
>He smiles back and lifts head back up, now blocking much less of the sky, but still being the biggest object there
>You need some fresh air
>You climb to the edge of the chest pocket containing you by climbing heaps of cotton wool that fox left inside, now slightly wet from moisture
>Your hands now hang out of pocket, pocket itself supports your weight very well, you most likely weigh less than cotton wool below you
>In front of you there are other macros moving at huge speeds on the sidewalk
>Normal walking speed for them but huge for you
>You look down
>You feel chill coming down your spine
>You really better not fall
>Even if you survive the fall you will be obliterated by the crowd of macros all around you simply crushing you under their feet
>Most likely not even noticing you
>You see legs as large as legs of huge offshore oil rig, walking quickly and confidently below you of your... boyfriend?
>You start rethinking, what made you agree to this
>A macro with a micro hanging out of her pants pocket catches you attention
>Female macro with rather large thighs and too tight pants
>And a micro being stuck in her left pocket
>Being grinded between two pieces of fabric with each step of their owner
>You can't tell if he is still alive, but the way things look like if he is then not for long
>Really made you appreciate the lecture your... bf... did about dangers of keeping micros in pockets
>But they are already gone, you saw them for a few seconds and went past them
>Or rather the fox carrying you passed them
>He didn't even notice this most likely
>Why would he
>He has people of his own size to worry about which are plenty here
>And you
>You feel hot wind from top
>You lift head and see once again smiling fox snout looking at you but this time he quickly lifts his head after noticing you looking back
>"I know that those are less than ideal conditions, but we will be arriving at our destination in a moment" he speaks from distance this time, not directly at you.
>You smell fish
>And the sea
>After a while you are next to the exit to the beach
>"So, what do you think?" he asks
>You say that it is a good place for a date
>Sound of sea completely drowns out any of your noise
>He looks at you for a while and moves his ear directly over you as far as he can without breaking his neck
>"Could you repeat?"
>You repeat, shouting this time
>"Ah, yes, uh, still, I didn't quite thought this through. Sea is quite noisy, I can't hear what you say." He sound apologetically and awkward. "We can return and go somewhere else if you want?"
>You make a gesture in direction of the beach from his chest pocket. You don't want to think that you went through all of this for no reason
>"All right, let's go" he crouch, movement making you for a moment not feel any gravity
>He takes off his shoes and socks
>Socks are placed into pocket of his pants, while both shoes are in his left hand
>You enter the beach
>It is a sandy beach
>For macros
>For you it's quite rocky
>You are so small that one grain of sand flying sufficiently fast could probably cause you a concussion
>Fortunately it's not that windy
>"We are going onto this pier" macro fox carrying you says, pointing onto the pier in front of you, with metal support and wooden planks to walk on. It's mostly empty
>He walks onto the wooden stairs of pier. Each step making horrible creaking noise
>If those sounds were heard is building for micros then that would mean it's in process of collapsing
>Most likely because of being stepped on by a macro
>But here it's just normal noise that macros hear every time while walking on them
>Or maybe it's not making any noise for them and only you can hear it due to your size
>You are carried to the end of the pier by the macro fox
>He sits on the planks and puts shoes down
>"Well, that's the best place I could think of for a date" he says and takes a deep breath which you could feel a little yourself
>"Alright, it's time to get out" he moves he upper body a little forward to help you climb out and places palm of his hand right under this chest pocket which you were occupying "sorry for keeping you there for so long"
>You slowly get out of the pocket onto his hand, you are at this point wet from sweat beacause of this heat, he too, but less
>He forms cupped hands, looking like he is holding water there, but instead of water it's your tiny body
>He just looks at you intensely like that for a while
>"Sorry, this is just painfully one sided" he finally says
>"I'm sorry, you probably agreed to come here because you were thinking there was no actual choice" he clenches his teeth
>You make gestures for him to calm down
>He sees that and calms down a little
>You start taking, he notices and moves his ear to you so that he can hear that despite sound of waves
>You say that yes, you are afraid, but so are all micros of all macros
>That you try to not let this dictate your decisions
>That there was a failure of communication but we could make this work, maybe we could talk through some device? We are still learning here, together
>That you think he is honest about this and you are willing to trust him, more than other macros for sure
>And that you can't know if this will work or if this is even what you want, but you can at least get to know each other
>He brightens up "Thanks, thank you for your trust"
>Both of you sit for a while quietly looking at waves
>He, while sitting on planks on pier
>You, while sitting in his cupped hands
>All this time you can feel his body, every slight movement of his hands changing plane on which you exist, blood being pumped through his veins in his hands, like underground river
>Hear him breathing in and breathing out, if you were closer you would get sucked into him mouth or blown out of his hands into the sea
>If you were left here on planks you would have problem with going back to beach due to gaps between those planks and be on the mercy for any passerby to firstly not get crushed by them, secondly to see you, and thridly to have good intentions towards you
>Fortunately you do have someone to help you
>Making you feel safe
>Being a wild micro is being in constant state of distress, but now you are feeling fine because you know you are kept safe
>"Look, the sun is setting" the fox says from over you
>You look to the left and it is
>It looks nice
>"Okay, I think this is where we will conclude this date, it think it went pretty well" macro male fox says happily
>"Just one more thing" he says "Could I maybe... kiss you? Just a little. Very lightly. Well, you will have to press into my mouth a little because it will not be safe for me to do. I know you are not neceserally into that but..." He looks at you hopefully
>You make gesture for him to lower his head
>He moves his snout into his cupped hands where you stand, close to you, then stops and closes his eyes
>Hot air coming from his nose surrounds you
>You walk towards gigantic mouth which could very drag you in with it's tongue if it wanted to
>You grab in wide embrace part of his maw and stuff your face in between his closed lips
>You move back and his snout retracts, this time looking much happier
>"I always wanted to do this" he exclaims "Okay, let's go"
>He lets you jump into his chest pocket again and you start going back to his home
