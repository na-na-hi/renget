Luca is in his apartment, bathing, after a day of crime. He's been dissociating; today was particularly brutal. He has to appear confident in front of the gang, but he almost threw up when giving the ugly orders. He needs to be punished.

He puts on the makeup with practiced efficiency. After an hour, even he can't tell he's a man from looking in the mirror. The outfit comes next, and his persona is complete. He's taking the private elevator today. The last time he took the front door, someone called him "Luca's sister." It was too close for comfort.

He drives a city away. Somewhere he won't be recognized, either by his gang or an enemy. After parking the car it's time to move. Walking in heels suits him. Normally he'd never leave the apartment without a gun, but tonight the danger is thrilling. 

It doesn't take long until a limo pulls up, and it's windows role down.
"Hey Girly, need a ride?" 
There are five guys inside, and they reek of alcohol. Luca can tell what they want at a glance. He wants it too. He needs punishment. For once he'll be the one on the bottom. Getting exploited for the profit and pleasure of other men.
Lucy answers "Like, sure! My feet were starting to hurt."

It's clear that the guys inside, weren't expecting it to be so easy. They're looking at one another, expecting some sort of trick. She needs to prove she's just the gift they were looking for. One of them offers Lucy a pill, and she takes it immediately. Luca's rules are never, ever consume what you sell. Lucy doesn't have rules. She's out to party.

It was MDMA, or something like that. She can tell from the weird, fuzzy, feeling that makes her magnetized to warm bodies. The guy who gave it to her is already pushing her to the floor of the limo, struggling with his zipper. Now comes the fun. 

"Like, I don't know if I want to do this..." Lucy whimpers
"Come on bitch, I gave you pills for free. You owe me."
"...Okayyyyy..."

Lucy has gotten his cock out way faster than the drunk man could have, and within seconds it's already emptying pre on her tongue. She's fighting the gag reflex, but the guy won't let up. He's holding her head down, forcing her to take all of it despite her audible choking. Of course, Lucy finds that incredibly hot.

She's finally been roughed up enough that she's relaxing by force. Without air flowing to her brain, all she can do is flop over, and let this man have his way with her. Luca couldn't permit anyone to even imagine him in this scenario. But she's not Luca anymore, she doesn't have to worry about keeping up appearences. 
The drunk is grabbing her head with both hands, groaning every time the tip of his cock pierces her throat. He can even feel it going down the curve of her windpipe. He finally finishes, while Lucy is on the verge of blacking out.
She coughs until her lungs are full of air again, but shamefully swallows what little of his cum remains in her mouth. Her eyeliner is running. It's proof she was crying for air at some point and he still didn't relent. The man's cock is covered in her purple lipstick as well. The stains go all the way to the base. The mere image of  those stains makes Lucy lick her lips. 
The abuse is making her incredibly hard. It's good thing the skirt hides it.
When she turns around the entire limo is looking at her. They all have their dicks out already. The MDMA is still in Lucy's blood and it'd be a shame to waste it. So she goes for the biggest cock first, and starts kissing it. Purple lipstick is already smearing the tip. When this drunk grabs her head, she grabs the two guys next to him, stroking and encouraging them to get closer.
The night was still young after all.

When they finally kick Lucy out, two hours have gone by, and her makeup is destroyed. There's pearly stains all over her her outfit. Her skirt's been torn, and cum is leaking from her panties. Just as much from the front as from the back. She's stumbles to her car, but before long, a new voice calls out from the darkness.
"Hey baby, need some help? Heh"
Lucy knows he's not going to help her. She knows exactly what he wants. But she answers anyway.
"Y-Yes! I need help, please... c-could you give me a ride?"
"Course baby."
Jackpot.
