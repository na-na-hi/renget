####Ending only
I safely arrived in Capim Town. I gave Lapras my thanks and started to look around for a guild. After asking around I learned that there was no guild in Capim Town and that I would need to travel to Treasure Town to be selected as a guild member. It was already night time and I sold all my food, so I decided to go to the local tavern. 
The place was packed with many pokemon. All of them were watching the pokemon on stage singing a song. I scanned around the room and noticed that a substantial number of pokemon in the audience have a weird aura, it was something entirely different from the run-of-the-mill Pokemon. I sat in the back of the tavern to not be noticed. Eventually, one of the weird aura pokemon stands up and says it reminds him of a song. The song had an unfamiliar name but other weird aura pokemon stood up and said they also recognized the song, suddenly chatter erupted from the audience. I didn’t catch all the details but terms like ‘human’ and ‘other world’ started to be thrown around. As the chatter died down I thought to myself, If the pokemon were actually human that their weird aura would make perfect sense.” Eventually, a small blue pokemon with green eyes and white stripes spoke up saying all the human talk was role play and that they were just a bunch of human enthusiasts that seemed to calm everyone down. A nice pokemon, named Dolive, took my order. I asked her who the blue pokemon’s name was. And she responded, “Meowstic”. 
As I finished eating my dinner, I looked up and noticed that every single pokemon with the weird aura left the tavern at the same time. My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to follow them from a safe distance. Thankfully I mastered aura suppression on my way too Lively Town or I would have been noticed immediately. We walk for what felt like hours but it was realistically only 10 minutes. Due to the dense forests, in the outskirts of Capim Town, I was able to head while still being close enough to overhear what they are saying. It turns out that they were humans that were transformed into pokemon. While some of the Pokemon there had normal aura, most of the pokemon there were likely human. They were talking about forming a guild. “This is perfect!” I thought. I could help form a guild and finally be an explorer to master my aura” All the pokemon/humans there seemed to be in agreement that Meowstic should be guildmaster. I think I got a little too excited because my aura suppression slipped for a minute. Meowstic noticed immediately. 
“Hey you come on out” he said.
Knowing my cover was blown a stepped out of hiding. Everyone there had an aura flare-up, they were on the defensive. If the next words out of my beak weren’t perfect I’d be considered an enemy and attacked. I thought for a moment got on my hands and knees and asked, “Please, will you let me join your guild?” And the rest is history, I was accepted into the Clover Guild as the first native mon without a human partner. It was weird getting used to all the new human speak, but it was fun. I'm still trying to master aura expression, I still have a long way to go, but I am making progress. Side note: Some of the guild members started to call me KFC and I have no idea what that meant, but I liked the sound of it.
