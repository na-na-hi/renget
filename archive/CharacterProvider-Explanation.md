**BEFORE WE DIVE IN ANY FURTHER PLEASE READ THIS DISCLAIMER:**
â€¢ I do not encourage/propagate any illegal/questionable/harmful/unethical activities or hate towards any ethnic groups/nationalities/minorities etc. All prompts and "jailbreaks" are intended for entertaining purposes ONLY.
â€¢ If you want to get access to a certain LLM so you can chat with bots, get access legally. When violating the **Terms of use** keep in mind that access can be taken from you by the key provider [Anthropic/OpenAI].
â€¢ Roleplays and generated stories depict exclusively fictional characters and scenarios, do not represent/encourage/propagate real experiences and are not intended for publishing. Private use only.
â€¢ My prompts are a result of work by dozens of AI RP enthusiasts, not just me. Sometimes I come up with something myself or take inspiration from the work of others, sometimes I copy parts of prompts from other 'prompters'. You may modify and repost my prompts too, no mentions needed.
â€¢ Using these prompts you are confirming that you are **18+** ~~and in a clear state of mind~~.
â€¢ While RP with AI is fun, be mindful about how you spend your time. Do not get too attached to your characters. Don't forget about your real friends and close ones, hobbies, shower, walks.
â€¢ Be sure to take rests between *khm* sessions and mind your health. Stop if you are uncomfortable or feel pain/discomfort. I am really-really serious. Dead serious.

**ABOUT VERSIONS:**
â€¢ Prompts are intended for Claude 100k models.
â€¢ All my prompts are intended for ecchi and rpg-like adventures.
â€¢ Each new X.0 version is not a better version but has major changes in structure and contents. It just provides a different output. Each X.X version has slight improvements/changes/fixes.
â€¢ If a version uses `Prefill` or `jailbreak` assistant is more likely to ignore OOC requests. (You can temporarily erase them to perform OOC request.)
	
Sometimes I leave orthographic mistakes. If they are major - I fix them and reupload. If they are not significant - I fix them in next versions, because using text editor, putting it in .zip, uploading to catbox, changing rentry is an 'ugh' action chain.

##Why we use XML?
**Quote from anthropic docs:** "We can also ask Claude to use XML tags in its response. Doing so can make it easy to extract key information in a setting where the output is automatically processed. Claude is naturally very chatty, so requesting these output XML tags helps separate the response itself from Claude's comments on the response."

Claude was specifically trained to understand XML tags. Breaking your prompt in <sections> and explaining/repeating makes it easier for AI to follow your prompt!
