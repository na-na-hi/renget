##Why we use XML?
**Quote from anthropic docs:** "We can also ask Claude to use XML tags in its response. Doing so can make it easy to extract key information in a setting where the output is automatically processed. Claude is naturally very chatty, so requesting these output XML tags helps separate the response itself from Claude's comments on the response."

Claude was specifically trained to understand XML tags. Breaking your prompt in <sections> and explaining/repeating makes it easier for AI to follow your prompt!
