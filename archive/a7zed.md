The Sasquatch Of Faraway's Championship Bout

This was it. All of his time training cumulated in this match. The world lightweight boxing champion. Basil Greene. Otherwise known as "The Thunder Rising Dragon"
He was known for his quick movements and lightning fast punches. He was the last obstacle standing between Sunny Suzuki and the belt.
Sunny was known as "The Sasquatch of Faraway" His punches had far more weight behind them, then one would expect from someone of his size. He was known for hitting hard and being able to take beating after beating without quitting.
The Unstoppable Force Versus The Immovable Object was the tagline plastered across the advertisements. Sunny thought it was clich√©. But it must have worked. There wasn't an empty seat in the house.
Sunny wrapped his hands in boxer's tape as his handlers rubbed his shoulders down with Tiger Balm. The idea was that it would get on the opponent's forehead during a clincher and their own sweat would cause it to drip into their eyes. Blinding them.
Sunny wasn't a fan of playing dirty. But there had been more than a few allegations of cheating levelled against Basil. 
Basil's team had always maintained that it was just a bunch of sore losers trying to beat him outside of the ring, since it was clear they couldn't do it inside. The boxing federation had investigated him several times and nothing ever came, but Sunny wasn't taking any chances.
One of the stagehands signaled to Sunny that the match was about to start. He had been standing there as Sunny's team prepped his unfair advantage, either he didn't understand that it was cheating or he simply didn't want to cause a fuss. No one wants to be the guy who ruins the most anticipated match of the year after all.
Sunny put on his gloves, and headed out towards the bright lights of the ring. 
The crowd was already roaring. Basil was already in the ring. The bright lights were as blinding as ever and the announcer babbled about something Sunny couldn't quite make out and didn't care to.
His attention was fixed on Basil, he was doing his best to amp the crowd up. He turned and pointed at Sunny and flashed the most disingenuous smile he'd ever seen.
God Sunny couldn't wait to wipe that look off his face.
He climbed into the ring and the two boxers stared each other down. Basil grinning from ear to ear as Sunny's expression was as stoic as ever.
The referee rushed through the rules as quick as he could, he didn't want to delay the match any longer and frankly he wanted to be away from the pair. The tension was palpable and he feared that if they weren't hitting each other soon. They'd be hitting him.
The ref quickly ducked out and the bell was rung. Within in an instant both boxers had thrown their first punch. Aimed directly at the others face.
Mari was sitting in front of her piano, however she was not playing. For some strange reason, the sheet music book was missing. She didn't remember moving it. Why would she? 
She got up and began searching the room. Maybe it had simply gotten knocked to the floor at some point. Her searches turned up empty.
She thought this was rather odd. She decided to search her room. Perhaps Sunny had taken it for some reason? It was worth a try. 
Heading up the stairs she could hear noises from behind the door. Seems that Sunny was hanging out with Basil today. She'd just pop in and ask Sunny if he'd seen the book.
Swinging open the door, she was met with the sight of her Brother and Basil sitting on the bed together. They had stripped down to just their underwear.
They were swinging their hips back and forth. Hitting their erect dicks together. They were frantically yelling about "Dragons" and "Sasquatch" all while making fight noises with their mouths.
Mari stood frozen in horror in the doorway. When Sunny and Basil noticed she was there. They too, froze in place.
There was a few seconds of silence between the trio. Finally Mari, without a word, turned around and shut the door behind her.
"I'll just- Ask mom if she's seen it." She said to herself as she made her way back down the stairs.
