The fight began, it's really happening, Sunny and Kel are facing of against their former friend Aubrey. The confidence is glimmering in Aubrey's eyes, her grin contorted by anger.
Mari's old Softball Bat, impaled with nails, turned into a fierce weapon.

Kel was tensing up, you could see the fear and sadness on his face, he didn't want to do this, afraid of Sunny's and his well being and the unimaginable terror of having to face his former friend like this.

Sunny keeps mustering Aubrey, barely resembling the girl he has seen in his dream, just a few hours ago. Kel is holding the Basketball with both hands in front of him, like it was a shield.

Aubrey looked determined, she could feel that Kel was shaking, she knew that Sunny couldn't defend himself, the fight would be over the second she hit Kel. She takes a step forward.

'Heh, don't worry sis, there is no way she can lose to these nerds".
Vance said with a smug facial expression.
"I know butâ€¦ i can't shake this feeling that something is 'bout to happen" Kim replied.

Aubrey is looking Kel dead set in the eyes, she was about to take a huge step forward but Kel couldn't allow her to come any closer. Kel quickly rotated his hands to throw the Ball with full force, if he could knock her over it hopefully would be enough to end the fight or at leas confiscate her weapon.

Aubrey barely manages to react, just enough time to twist her face.
The basketball is hitting her right in the face, barely missing her nose. The impact made her slightly tumble, but she didn't fall. Aubrey's cheek is glowing red, she's showing her teeth clenched together, she lets out a scream and storms towards Kel.

She closed in, steadily clutching the bat with both hands, she was swinging with brute force towards Kel, with a quick step back he was barely out of reach. The swing left Aubrey stumbling.

An opening, now was the time to strike. Sunny was dashing forward, towards Aubrey, while keeping his profile low, he grabbed the Steak knife that was loosely in his back pocket. He clutched the knife with both hands and he threw himself with his entire weight forward, the tip of the knife entering Aubrey's abdomen and quickly pulling back.

Aubrey felt cold,
she dropped the Bat,
she started shaking, 
her body felt numb. 

She looked slowly down while shaking heavily, she saw the blood flowing out of her, she looked Sunny in the eyes for a brief moment.
Tears in her eyes, ready to fall.
Her face contorted in shock, she took both her hands and started to press against the wound. 
Then suddenly like a breaking dam the pain hit her full force, the tears followed.

She let out a loud pain induced scream, the gang looked confused, still processing what happened just a few moments ago.

Sunny's body froze up, he is staring dead into the distance, clutching the knife full force, he feels numb from the realization of what he just did. Guilt slowly creeping up on him.
Kel started to cry, rushing towards  Aubrey and helped her to sit down.

The pain was too much for Aubrey, she couldn't speak, she couldn't cry, she couldn't breathe.

Kim was the first who started to act, she screamed: "VANCE CALL AN AMBULANCE! RING ON THE DOORBELL AND KNOCK UNTIL SOMEONE OPENS, KICK THE FUCKING DOOR OPEN IF YOU NEED TO!"

"AUBREY!" she cried out, "everything is going to be ok, you got this, you are strong, i am here, we are here". Her words were disrupted by heavy sobbing. She kneeled down next to her best friend, looked onto her pale face and held her cold hand.

Tears continued to rush down Aubrey's face, her eyes were shut. She felt that she was losing control over her senses.

Kim turned her head towards Kel, she spoke with a voice full of anger and sadness, while trying to hold back more tears: "Kel, get that fucking psycho out of here".

Kel turned to Sunny, who was still staring into the distance, still in shock and in denial of what he did. Sunny had never seen Kel looking at him like that: "Go home Sunny", he said in a voice devoid of any emotion.

The battle was over, nobody won.
