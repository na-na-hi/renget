!!!note -> 🪶  **Most recommended streams if you're new.**  🪶 <-
    Many hoomans fell for Mumei due in part to the scuff in her early streams, and a big part of the experience was watching her grow and improve over time. Here's a list of the most recommended streams to watch in order to fully appreciate the evolution of Mumei. You can click on the thumbnails to access the stream.

######Minecraft
->[Go back to the TOC](https://rentry.org/cgy92)->
What is featured on this recommendation list was her longest stream at the time before being beaten by the 'Pokemon breeding' stream. Described as possibly one of the most entertaining MC stream from Mumei's POV in multiple aspects and most particularly interactions with Sana and Kronii. Slow second half, but still worth the watch.

######Jump King
->[Go back to the TOC](https://rentry.org/cgy92)->
Previous longest stream (title taken by [PKM Violet Shiny Hunt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHeWJNBIFbY) in Dec 22), clocking at 6:13:43. The other reasons why the stream is featured in the rentry are the VChat interactions with Bae and Kronii and the last 30 minutes of perseverance on Mumei's part to get done with her in-game objectives.

#####The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild
->[Go back to the TOC](https://rentry.org/cgy92)->
BotW was her longest running series so far and as far as gaming goes. /who/'s most recommended stream would be the Zora's Domain one (Part 6 - BEASTS!) - on the sole context that it was the very first 4 hour+ stream on her channel and was the very first stream of the Sugar Rush week.

#####RUST
->[Go back to the TOC](https://rentry.org/cgy92)->
Another saga (just like HoloCure arc) but just as more addictive for Mumei. Seems to be the perfect game fitting her tastes: basically Minecraft with guns, multiple targets to shoot at, wild tangents and situations leading to multiples interactions with her JP/ID senpais and kouhais - most of the streams listed so far happened during the 2nd season with the exception of the collab with Gura and Fauna, which happened a few days before the server wipe.

Her 3rd stream called 'shhhhhhh' is the one being the most recommended by the thread due to the in-media-res interactions with Moona and Kaela (kickstarted when Mumei killed Kaela before the start of her own stream) and the gambling sequence. It was mostly a solo stream with mundane tasks despite the large cast of protagonists in these events: Subaru, Moona, Kaela & Zeta (Luna & IRyS were also in the surroundings, without being seen on Mumei's stream). [Here's the link to the RUST Annex - everything from Mumei's POVs, the Alt POVs and the M.E.S. timestamps will be archived in the chronological order.](https://rentry.org/euyui)

#####Civilization V
->[Go back to the TOC](https://rentry.org/cgy92)->
Long awaited series. She was denied her history and Civ streams by managment. But the Moom delivers as the Hopium fortold. First stream's save is sadly abondoned but the save from the 2nd stream is continuted properly. She tries to stream it every Friday night.

The members ones ('Member's Unarchived Karaoke' and 'Acapella') are also heavily recommended.
The off collab karaokes that happened on Ame's channels are also recommended by the thread. The first link is the archived part of the offcollab while the second is the unarchived part. We'll note for the sake on being an anecdote that all the members of that off-collab were all drawn during the very first episode of the ['Mumei draws HololiveEN'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZcYUy-WQD4) series. It was a subject of a (joke) controversy on /who/ whenever this thing was unintentional or rigged.

#####Mumei Zatsudan & Rants
Sources of wild and wilder tengents. Also not laughing in the case of the Mumei Rants. Worth to note that the original 'Mumei Rants' stream from January 2022 had a [follow-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wp2XsR9b1M) a few months later. It's Moomin' Time is the return zatsudan from a rather long health break, also the first time she used her home 3D in a stream.

#####Memei Meme Review
This is what her sense of humor is like. Also 'I expected better from you' as she says. On the side note and it's an opinion shared by Mumei herself and /who/ : The 'i forgor' meme needs to die! Her ideal source-material for memes have to be mainly based on streams or any different interactions whenever it's twitter or chat interactions as long as memes used prior to her debut aren't overused, seem forced or is irrelevant to her character.
