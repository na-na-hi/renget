##### `Guardian Angel`
>A gentle breeze had blown through the moonlit hillside. The only thing that could be heard was the faint sound of crackling fire from an isolated hut and the chirping of crickets.
>This hut was not home to the man, but rather, it belonged to the wolfu. The man had been injured and was in desperate need of help. Taking compassion on the man, she brought him back to her campsite to help him. It's strange to consider though, the two weren't always friends with one another.
>In the past, she was more than content to silently follow the then stranger as he wandered seemingly aimlessly through the forest. She was always told that humans couldn't be trusted, or that they were dangerous. But the man's actions contradicted what she had been taught as a cub.
>The rabbits, the deer, the birds, ... they didn't seem to fear this man. If anything, when he sat down and rested against a tree, they approached him one after another, merely curious about the forest visitor.
>Deciding to learn more about the man, the wolfu had decided to stealthly approach him herself one day. None of the usual animals visited this man today, undoubtedly avoiding him due to her closer than normal presence. The man was, as expected, resting in that same spot he had taken a liking to. Now was her chance.
>As she approached, the man spoke: "Was wondering when you would say hello."

>Her eyes widened in surprise: "You knew I was following you?"
>"Of course. I figure you were just shy to talk. Most animals come to me on certain days, then never come at all. Either animals are bored of me, or scared of you."
>She emerged from the trees and stepped into the clearing. "And, aren't you scared of me?"
>The man merely tilts his head as he visually inspects his stalker: "Should I be? If you meant harm, you'd have done so by now."
>The man's logic was correct. She didn't want trouble, and it seems the same could be said of the man. But why was he so calm about her?
>"If you want to talk, come, sit" the man said, motioning to the ground before him.
>Accepting his offer, she slowly approached before sitting on the soft grass in front of him.
>"Can tell you are curious of me, what would you like to know?" he says with a smile.
>She wanted to ask the obvious, but didn't know how to put it nicely. "Isn't it true humans are dangerous?"
>He tilts his head upwards and ponders the question for a bit. He then replied: "Some humans bad, some animals bad, never is all."
>On some level that made sense to her. She knew that there were certain denizens that were hostile to other creatures. And despite most humans that visited the forests being hunters, here was this man before her, content to be in nature's serenity with no intention for violence.
>The two began to talk for a while longer, and soon, the man had to take his leave to return home. But not before asking her to come back here tomorrow. And so she did. The two had met in this exact same spot for days, until suddenly, the man didn't come one morning.
>It wasn't until evening faded to night that she felt uneasy about him not appearing. Feeling a newfound sense of concern and worry, the wolfu scoured the forest, intent to see if the man was ok.

>A loud roar had caught her attention and she immediately dashed towards it. The direction of the roar was leading her further towards a mountainside where she then heard the distinct shouting of the man.
>This spurred her on even faster, and when she reaches the source of the noise, she finds the same human she had grown accustomed to, fighting against a mountain lion.
>The man had suffered a deep slash to his abdomen and was beginning to lose his step. The mountain lion was in no better shape, seemingly limping with one of his legs badly damaged.
>Not wanting this fight to turn out one way or another, the wolfu rushes to the side of the man, snarling at the already shaken up mountain lion. Not wanting to press its luck, the mountain lion turns tail and bails.
>She resists the urge to give chase and finish the bastard off, and instead turns her attention to the man, who had collapsed to the ground, clutching at the wound on his abdomen. The wound was pretty bad, and it was obvious the man would die without immediate intervention.
>She elects to carry the now unconscious human back to her hut, hoping to save his life in time. When they make it there, she immediately dresses the wound, learning all she needed to know about healing from her family.
>After the wound was tended to, she rests the man against her, silently appreciating the close feeling of another being. The man began to stir and as he opened his eyes, he was staring up and directly at the one who had saved him.
>He reaches a hand up to her face, she takes the hand and presses her face gently into it, content to know the man was awake and on the road to recovery.
>"Thank you" he said softly. The wolfu merely smiled back at him.
>He brings his arm back to his side and quickly falls asleep again in the lap of the wolfu. And she merely rubbed him idly, taking care to gently glance over the bandages, as the wind of the night continued to drift by in solitude.
