!!! warning Autism
->*Hold! What you are doing to us is wrong! Why do you do this thing?*<-
	As I say in the disclaimer, this is meant to serve as a quick run-down of some of 4chan's most prolific posters. It also serves as a kind of very informal chronicle of such people. I, yrstruly, am also on the list. It isn't meant to be a bad thing - some entries are derogatory in tone, but this is because I think a purely academic list would be very boring to read. No offense is intended.

->*Isn't this a terrible idea?*<-
	Maybe! So far, it's been alright. I would hope that the people on this list would see their presence as a sort of compliment; I put in more time than you might expect researching every entry. It's a labor of love.

->*How do I find you? Where do you live? SSN?*<-
	If you're here, you should be able to figure out where I post. It's not too hard.

->*Tell me more about **you**.*<-
	I'm really no one important. I'm in no secret discord cabals, run no gayops, and appear in no KYM or ED articles (as far as I know). I'm interested in internet, and particularly chan, culture, and that's about all there is to it. I have no social media and am profoundly paranoid. 

->*Hey faggotron, you fucked up an entry, you stupid idiot, you fucking buffoon.*<-
	Reach out and I'll fix it. You can help me along by posting screencaps or key terms/image hashes/names/tripcodes to search for in the archives. This is also true for if you want to add to the list.

->*Is there any rhyme or reason to how an entry is described, or are you just winging this shit?*<-
	There's a few rules. Every entry has at least one Haunt - I go through each archive and eliminate identifiable posts by the board they're posted on, sequentially, until nothing else appears. The first Haunt is always the board with the most identifiable posts, the rest are largely arbitrary. Boards the person can be found on are included if there are more than about 5 identifiable posts of theirs there; my reasoning is that they are probably lurking, or posting unidentifiably, even if I can't know that for sure. >fat is only posted if the poster showed a picture of themself, and is fat. >gay is used if they are flirtatious with other anons, post gay porn, or explicitly describe themselves as such - I assume everyone is male unless proven otherwise. >shart(y)fag is used if they post soyjacks. I realize that not everyone who posts soyjacks is a shartyfag, but I feel like it works as a rule of thumb. >name/trip/old/originalfag is self-explanatory - I don't categorize newfag, because I have no way of knowing when they actually began posting (before they were identifiable). >furry is used if they post furry pictures, no semantics involved. >/pol/tard is used if they post on /pol/, or if their posts have a significant amount of /pol/ ideology. >cunnyseur is what you think it means; I felt like "pedophile" was a bit harsh. Not everyone who watches Bocu no Pico wants to molest children. "Identifiable posts" is a bit of a crapshoot; entrants who use a name/trip are more accurate (shout-out to Vidya Butts for making life very easy), otherwise I base it off of key terms or image hashes associated with the person in question that can be found in the archives. You should assume a margin of error of around 1k posts.  "Active since 20XX*ish*" is used if I'm not sure when they started/stopped posting, and should be read as a best-guess. If there's a month listed, I'm fairly confident in the date. 
It's worth noting that several entries were primarily written by people who are not me, so there are some minor differences in style.

->*What archives are used?*<-
	Desuarchive and Archived Moe at a minimum. I will also usually check b4k, warosu, thebarchive, and 4plebs. I generally only check the Oldfriend Archive if I see posts going back to at least 2011. Sometimes I'll Google someone if I think I'll find something related to 4chan in that way. 

->*Isn't this just doxxing with extra steps?*<-
	I leave a lot of things out on purpose. I don't want to get SWAT teams dispatched to anyone's house; I make an effort to leave out any clearly identifiable info (with the exception of a few very internet famous people, such as MadThad and Barneyfag - anyone can find that just by Googling). This is also why I don't include trips for tripfags. 

->*What is a schizo, anyway?*<-
	My rough rules: identifiable, known to the regulars of at least one thread, generally divisive or disliked (3AB wasn't a schizo, for example). I check into people before adding them on in an attempt to leave out extremely specific grudges. "Schizo" is used because it's the lingo; I'm not claiming that everyone on this list is actually schizophrenic. I've never interacted with most of them.

->*Why are there crying emoticons after /qa/?*<-
	I am eternally mourning the board's deletion (;-;)
I really hope they bring it back one day.

->**Special thanks to everyone who has contributed to this list. I am sincerely grateful for the time you spent on my behalf.**<-
