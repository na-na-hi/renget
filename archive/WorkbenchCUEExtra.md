This version of the character was SCRAPPED because trying to make "Sonic.EXE but he turns every level into Wacky Workbench" into a serious thing was never going to work, and I was retarded for attempting it.
I'm not leaving the old version of the pasta with this canon up because there's nothing of substance.

I'm not going to add any useless facts like his favorite food but I will just say that Workbench's mouth is covered with skin, though I guess that answers the favorite food thing since he can't fucking eat. I'll just leave you with this:

!!! note This is sort of like a write-up on the prototype itself (in the style of an article/blogpost, rather than of someone playing it)

Sonic CD Special (1997) was a scrapped version of Sonic CD for PC, oddly set to release only one year after the original port. It was to include certain enhancements over the original game, such as the genesis Spin Dash, 3D special stages, and that's about it really. 

Workbench was planned as a funny little rare easter egg, being the self-insert of a programmer who resigned in shame due to the internal conflicts caused by it. His implementation was only as the looping Wacky Workbench easter egg, which was only planned to appear very rarely on roughly 1% of playthroughs, however it ended up morphing into something much worse through unknown causes that appears consistently on every playthrough.

The anomaly ended up so deeply rooted into the game that none of the developers could remove it, those who tried being naturally affected by the mass panic and hallucinations induced by Workbench, leaving SEGA no choice but to terminate the project. and most copies were completely wiped away, the one that resurfaced being the only copy left, somehow being recovered off of a thrown out hard drive. This is also why Sonic CD had never been re-released since the first PC port until 2011, as the source code ended up damaged beyond repair, SEGA no longer having access to it for safety reasons.

There are no links available to the prototype since no one wants to host it, most filehosts will outright reject it, and the "Good Samaritans" of the Sonic community forbid you from posting the link in Discord servers, Reddit, etc, and will report any hosted links for it

(Though up to Quartz Quadrant is completely safe, it is generally not recommended to download it even then.)
