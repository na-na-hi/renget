This version of the character was SCRAPPED because trying to make "Sonic.EXE but he turns every level into Wacky Workbench" into a serious thing was never going to work, and I was retarded for attempting it.
I'm not leaving the old version of the pasta with this canon up because there's nothing of substance.

I'm not going to add any useless facts like his favorite food but I will just say that Workbench's mouth is covered with skin, though I guess that answers the favorite food thing since he can't fucking eat. I'll just leave you with this:

!!! note If you'd rather not see basic explanations as to what goes on in the story, do not read this.

Most things that happen in the pasta are part of the protagonist's mind.  The game prototype itself is real, and Workbench does indeed show up within it, but everything else is the result of intense hallucinations which happen to anyone attempting to play it. This is why the prototype was pulled off the net, presumably by SEGA's legal team themselves.

Sonic CD Special (1997) was scrapped because the anomaly ended up so deeply rooted into the game that they couldn't even remove it, and most copies were completely wiped away, the one that resurfaced being the only copy left. This is also why Sonic CD had never been re-released since the first PC port until 2011, as all source code was destroyed for safety purposes.

Workbench was planned as a fun rare easter egg, being the self-insert of a now-terminated programmer, and he was implemented along with the looping Wacky Workbench. It is unknown how it morphed into the anomaly present in the pasta.

The protagonist and anyone who played the prototype will NEVER recover from the hallucinations, and will be tormented by the Round even beyond death.
