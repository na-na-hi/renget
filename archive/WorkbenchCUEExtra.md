YAH FUCK YOU! YOU AREN'T GETTING ANY MORE SHIT FROM MEEEEEEEEEE.

!!! note Sonic CD Special (purposefully lost media, 2021)

Sonic CD Special (1997) was a scrapped version of Sonic CD for PC, oddly set to release only one year after the original port. It was to include certain enhancements over the original game, such as the genesis Spin Dash, 3D special stages, and minor improvements to gameplay.

Workbench was planned as a funny rare easter egg, being the self-insert of a programmer who resigned in shame due to the internal conflicts caused by it. His implementation was only as the looping Wacky Workbench easter egg, which was only planned to appear very rarely on roughly 1% of playthroughs, however it ended up morphing into something much worse through unknown causes that appears consistently on every playthrough.

The anomaly ended up so deeply rooted into the game that none of the developers could remove it, those who tried being naturally affected by the mass panic and hallucinations induced by Workbench, leaving SEGA no choice but to terminate the project. and most copies were completely wiped away, the one that resurfaced being the only copy left, somehow being recovered off of a thrown out hard drive. This is also why Sonic CD had never been re-released since the first PC port until 2011, as the source code ended up damaged beyond repair, SEGA no longer having access to it for safety reasons.

There are no links available to the prototype since no one wants to host it, most filehosts will outright reject it, and the "Good Samaritans" of the Sonic community forbid you from posting the link in Discord servers, Reddit, etc, and will report any hosted links for it

(Though up to Quartz Quadrant is completely safe, it is generally not recommended to download it even then.)

!!! note If you hate this kinda stuff just...please don't read it.

- In different games afflicted by his hallucinations, he will mutate the appearance of Classic Sonic in that game with his colors and mannerisms. Pretty simple.

- An older version of the pasta was scrapped that would've given him a more serious design and characteristics.
- His mouth is entirely covered by skin.
- The hallucinations can only be removed from afflicted people through 48 hours of white torture.
- He is real in a sense. The easter egg and Sonic recolor do exist in the real world, but Workbench as a character only exists in the mind.
