Originally written on the 5th of February. Rewritten on Feb 17th.
Credits to SEGA and Sonic Team for the original sprites edited, and The Spriters Resource for ripping and hosting them.

Written by me in an hour, rewritten in another

The entity in the pasta is only referred to as "Workbench" and the original "Workbench.CUE" name has been scrapped.
