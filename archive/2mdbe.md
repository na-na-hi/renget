Three's a Crowd

Mari sat on her bed in front of her two younger siblings, both of them in their underwear, both of them looking at her expectantly.
 
“So…” said Haru.
 
“So.” said Mari. “How exactly are we going to be doing this?”
 
“Um.” Haru glanced at Sunny. He glanced back at her as if to say 'Don’t look at me, I didn’t think this through.'
 
“You didn’t think this through, did you?” The twins looked embarrassed. Cute. “Okay, why don’t we take turns, then? Who wants to go first?”
 
They looked at each other again. Mari waited patiently.
 
“…Haru can go first.”
 
”Aww, what a gentleman you are, Sunny!” Mari said. Sunny blushed a little bit as he took a seat on his bed, while Mari beckoned her sister over. "Step right up, little sis!”
 
Haru stepped forward, then stopped in front of Mari, looking a little lost. "Um. Do I- do you want me to lay on the bed, or...?"
 
Mari giggled. "Just lie down and I'll take care of you, okay?" Haru nodded and got into bed, lying on her back. Mari followed, putting her knees on either side of Haru. She noticed that there was already a rising tent in her sister’s purple polka-dot boxers. Haru was always the more excitable sibling…
 
Deciding to get right into things, Mari tugged at the straps of Haru’s tank top, slipping them off her shoulders and pulling her shirt down below her tits.
 
Haru’s breasts were small—a fact that the girl was a bit self-conscious about—but Mari thought they were perfect. She leaned down to take one of them into her mouth, making her little sister moan in response.
 
Shifting her position slightly, Mari slid her hand down from Haru's chest to her crotch. She teased her sister's bulge through her underwear, running a single finger down the length of her cock at a lazy pace that nonetheless made Haru's toes curl. She moved her hips in time with Mari, trying to work just a bit more friction out of her touch.
 
…and just as easily as she gave, she took away. Mari suddenly detached her mouth from Haru's nipple and took her hand away from her crotch, to which Haru whined plaintively and gave her sister a pitiful look. "Mariiii..."
 
“Oh don’t look at me like that, you don’t want the fun to be over already, do you?” Haru’s only response was a bratty little pout, which was, considering the circumstances, unreasonably adorable. “Be patient and I promise we’ll get to do something even better, okay?”
 
“…fine.” Haru conceded. Mari smiled and gave her little sister a kiss on her forehead, making her cheeks flush pink ever so slightly.
 
“Alright Sunshine, your turn!” Mari rose to a sitting position and patted her lap, inviting her brother over. Sunny, who had been sitting with his legs crossed in a not-very-effective attempt to hide his arousal, got up and made his way over to her.
 
Unlike his twin sister, who was often shamelessly vocal, Sunny tended to try to keep quiet. To Mari, that just made every sound he did make all the more delightful. She knew exactly what buttons to push, so coaxing what noises out of him that she could was almost like a little game for her.
 
After a bit of fidgeting around, Sunny eventually settled into a comfortable position on Mari’s lap. She wrapped her arms around him and rested her chin on his shoulder, her chest pressing up against his back and her breath in his ear sending tingles down his spine.
 
For a minute, they sat just like that, Mari rubbing little circles into his tummy, and Sunny content to bask in her warmth and closeness. Only when Sunny was completely relaxed did Mari make her move.
 
Slipping her hand underneath his shirt, she started feeling up his bare stomach, and there was a subtle yet noticeable change in his breathing and body language; breaths ever so slightly less languid, muscles ever so slightly more tensed, anticipatory. He knew she was about to start for real.
 
Slowly, she worked her fingers up his torso, digits tracing along his stomach and ribs, drifting all the way to his chest. When her hand brushed against his nipple, there was a sharp intake of breath.
 
That was a weak spot for both of her siblings. Mari found this fact unbearably adorable.
 
Deciding to press her advantage, she pinched the little bud between her thumb and index finger. She had barely applied any pressure at all, but Sunny twitched and whimpered at the touch. Mari continued her onslaught by burying her face into Sunny's neck, nibbling and planting little kisses wherever she could.
 
Sunny, unable to maintain his composure under such a skillful assault, melted into his sister’s grasp as a long, low groan was drawn from him. Mari brought her free hand down to his crotch, ever so slightly ghosting her fingers over the tent in his boxers. On instinct, Sunny bucked his hips forward, desperate for her to attend to his untouched arousal. Just a bit more of this and Sunny was effectively reduced to a squirming little mess.
 
Letting up her onslaught, Mari gingerly shifted Sunny off her lap to set him on the bed beside her. She stood and looked at her two siblings, and they looked back at her expectantly, erections straining against their underwear. They were both perfectly primed for the main event.
 
And so Mari began the agonizingly slow process of stripping, starting by unbuttoning her top. She made a real show of it, no doubt to the frustration of her siblings, who were little more than pent-up bundles of horniness just waiting to ravage her at this point. They would have to wait, though. Patience was a virtue, after all.
 
After undoing the final button, she pulled her shirt over her head and tossed it in Sunny’s direction. Mari hadn’t intended for it to land on his face, but she considered it a happy accident. He made a (ridiculously cute) surprised little squeak noise when it hit his face, then pulled it off hastily, not wanting to miss a second of Mari's striptease.
 
Next, she let her skirt slip off and pool at her feet. With tantalizing ease, she brought it up to her hand by lifting her leg, then tossed it at Haru. It also landed right on the girl’s face, and Mari swore she heard her sniff reflexively, taking in the scent.
 
While her siblings were occupied with her discarded clothing, Mari got into position on the other bed, lying on her stomach and giving the other two the most shamelessly sultry look she could muster. “So… who’s taking front and who’s taking back?”
 
Once again, her siblings simply looked at each other. There was a strange intensity to it this time, like they were having a heated debate in their minds. Maybe that thing Mari had heard about twins sharing a mental connection was actually true? Were they having some sort of psychic argument? She'd have to ask them about that later.
 
Eventually, they seemed to reach a silent agreement... somehow. Haru sat herself down in front of Mari's face, while Sunny made his way to her backside. She felt him fidgeting with her panties, and decided to tease him a bit by wiggling her butt.
 
“Feel free to start anytime back th-ERE!”
 
Wow, okay, she honestly wasn’t expecting him to just go all in like that. During the brief moment that she attempted to compose herself, Sunny had already begun thrusting with reckless abandon, and Mari soon gave up higher brain function. She had enough presence of mind to open her mouth so Haru could slip her own length in, though her mouth being open might have just be a consequence of how hard her brother was fucking her. Her head was too fuzzy to tell at this point.
 
The next few minutes were mostly a blur of sensations for her. She felt Haru's hands on her head, Sunny's hands on her hips, Haru's cock nearly hitting the back of her throat, Sunny's cock hitting her in all the right spots. She smelled Haru's scent, heavy from arousal and nearly making her lightheaded. She heard both her siblings moaning incessantly in their lustful frenzies.
 
She felt herself tighten around Sunny, and moaned as he flooded her insides with his seed (fortunately, she was infertile), the sound muffled by Haru's cock in her mouth. And in some sort of obscene chain reaction, while the wave of her own orgasm washed over her, she felt her mouth being filled too as Haru was pushed over the edge. Mari swore her heart nearly gave out.
 
After a euphoric minute or two, Mari finally came to her senses. She popped Haru's softening length out of her mouth and slid herself off of Sunny's. They were all a complete mess, not to mention their sheets. Those would definitely have to be cleaned. Maybe burned.
 
She moved to get up, but paused when she heard... snoring? Quiet, but unmistakably snoring.
 
Oh. Haru had fallen asleep. ...and so had Sunny. They were both sleeping. Great.
 
Mari sighed and laid back down. Like the good older sister she was, she decided to let them rest.
 
She was going to make them take the sheets to the wash when they woke up, though.
