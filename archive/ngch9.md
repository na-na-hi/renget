#Moonlight lily

>A rich land of purple grassy fields, beneath the violet tree were two figures holding hands; Hikki and Basil.
>Basil’s colorful flower crown matched nicely with his blue hair while Hikki’s flower crown just looks out of place due to her monochromatic appearance.
>They leaned on each other’s shoulders as the others were playing back at the playground. Having time to themselves was refreshing and reminded them of old memories.
>”Hey Hikki, remember the first time we met.”
>”I remember, when Aubrey introduced you to the group. You were quite shy back then.”
>”Y-Yeah, but I changed a lot since then!”
>Hikki closed her eyes and went through her memories. Black and white static first appeared, as if her memories were rewriting the setting. 
>They traveled mirror mountain, where the ground was nothing but glass mirrors. The girls had to wear pants that day. Next was penguin plaza, a village of penguin all wearing unique hats. Lastly, was the same exact spot they were sitting on, next to the tree. 
>In all those memories, Basil grew closer and closer to Hikki. When they won battles, he would hug her thigh. When they ate lunch together, he was always feeding Hikki like a child. Then at the tree they were at, he-
>”I confessed my feelings for you here…do you remember?”
>Hikki nods and looks at the purple sky.
>”When you were a man, ask me again…I’ll probably say yes.”
>Basil was red as a beet, he quickly turned to Hikki to give her a little peck on the cheek.
>Hikki’s eyes opened wide and placed her hand on the cheek that was blessed. This lingering feeling she had.
>One of regret.
>A bad feeling, perhaps a memory? It was hard to tell, nothing came to her head.
>Nothing ever did.
>How long as it been since she told Basil her answer; 4 years? You’d think he would’ve grown up just a bit by now.
>…the wait was killing her.
>Hikki taps on Basil’s shoulders, he turned around to have his lips stolen by her.
>A longing desire, something she felt like she would never see again. She had to savor this moment to every feeling of his warmth.
>She pulls away to see the reddest flower she has ever seen. Basil kept stuttering, but felt something heavy on his knees.
>Hikki claimed her favorite pillow and rested her head on his lap. Basil couldn’t help but smile as he pets the oversized cat-like girl.
>”We’ll be together…waiting for when the time comes, right Hikki?”
>Of course, he would always be waiting for her. No matter what would happen, he’ll be there for her when she needs him the most.
>His kindness, his caring personality, it’s no wonder Sunny was his best friend…
>…
>Was?…
>…
>Probably something went through her mind, but she quickly forgot about it.
>All she wanted at this moment was rest with her tulip.
