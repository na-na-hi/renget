>>BROTIPS

PRESSING CTRL SPACE speeds up time
PRESSING SHIFT CLICK allows you to upgrade, garrison, recruit or release 10 troops at a time in the party menu
PRESSING CTRL CLICK allows you to upgrade, garrison, recruit or release all troops at once in the party menu
PRESSING CTRL J  Halts your horse in battle
PRESSING THE ยง/" KEY lets you turn the camera around your character
PRESSING BACKSPACE opens minimap, strategy options and fighters/routed troops/casualties window; clicking on the minimap will order the selected troops to Hold Position at the spot
RIGHT-CLICKING A LORD'S ARMY allows you to follow them automatically with 'Accompany'
HOLDING F1 enables you to choose where your selected troops will hold with your mouse; icon is a flag
YOU CAN ZOOM IN/OUT in third person with the + or - keys of the numpad (not sure about notebookfags)
CLICKING ON A NPC PORTRAIT during talking scenes redirects you to the Notes window (can be used to check NPCs, places, etc before accepting a quest)
BATTLE SIZE can be increased by opening \My Documents\Mount&Blade Warband\rgl_config.txt and changing "battle_size = 1.5700" to "battle_size = 3.0000" for example
PARTICLE EFFECTS and Character shadows are performance killers when using large custom battle sizes, IE 350+
YOU WILL LOSE STATS once your save reaches 757 days and you lose a battle, as it's meant to show your character is growing old. It can be disabled with TweakMB (see Minor mods & Misc section)
HORSES IN YOUR INVENTORY will reduce the speed nerf from excessive weight in your inventory. Their stats don't matter in that regard.

>>Should I buy the Mount & Blade bundle/which game(s) should I play?

Classic M&B: There are some mods that are exclusive to original M&B, but you can get that for free if you own Warband (see bottom of pastebin). Outdated overall.
Warband: It's undisputedly the best game in the series and basically an expansion of the original game. Pretty much all the mod scene revolves around Warband.
With Fire and Sword: While alright, has not received updates in quite some time and should be the worst paid M&B game available.
Napoleonic Wars: It's restricted for Multiplayers. Purchase it if you like decently populated multiplayers.
Viking Conquest: Single Player is controversial; some legit enjoy it, others don't, most of them shit on the story mode. The overall opinion is that it's way more polished if compared to release. MP is kill.
Caribbean!: It's a very unique M&B mod, though pricey. If you're into pirates, you should consider this.
Gloria Sinica : Han Xiongnu Wars : "Recent reviews : Mostly Negative". Clunky mechanics and unbalanced gameplay are among the most prominent problems. Unique setting and it tries a lot of new things. Maybe be worth on a sale and with some mods. Caveat emptor (you're warned).

>>MOUNT & BLADE STUFF GOES ON SALE IN STEAM REGULARLY, KEEP AN EYE ON THEM<<


>>WHAT IS BANNERLORD
The sequel to M&B. You have heard of it even if you've never heard of warband. 

The basics of it as far as we know is that its Warband but actually fully working plus some new stuff atop of that
>Better campaign and combat AI as well as more diplomatic options.
>Combat now more reliant on physic simulation.
>New Factions : Empire (Late roman/Byzantine styled); Khuzaits (Mongols/Huns); Sturgians (Kievan Rus (confirmed, suck it 578) :^); Vlandia (Normans/Franks); Battanians (Late celts/Britons); Aserai (Early arabs).
>Chained attacks for more fluidity in combat. Shield bashes. Upstabs. Troop formations. More varied orders and commands to troops.
>Troops are now recruited through NPCs in a town, by building your relations with these NPCs you'll unlock more and better soldier. There seems to be 3-4 such NPCs per town, each offering at least two lowest level recruits when you don't build up relation with them.
>Influence, gained by completing quests and winning battles, is a kind of currency used for diplomatic deals you neeed to amass and manage multi-lords armies.
>More extensive modding possible ? Modding will be in C#. Having different mods active at once will be possible. Custom skeletons implementation is confirmed. Refer to the dev blog about modding for more extensive questions.
>Siege weapons : (Chiero-)Ballistas, Siege towers, Rams, Onagers, TREBUCHETS and Bricoles.
>Weapon crafting, with stats determined by parts chosen, shape, weight and length of the weapon. Only for melee and throwing weapons, no armour, no bows or crossbows. Different crafting materials have been found in the beta's files.
>Pretty fucking cool music. Check the OST some lines below.
>Death of the player character is confirmed as of Gamescom 2018. When dying you will pick up another family member and play with him/her instead. May be your descendants or brother/sister.
>Family system is also confirmed, you can have children and will have to if you're to die.
>Skill system is changed : Now you have to practice a skill to level it, investing 'focus points' in it will make it level faster. As you level a skill you will unlock perks for it (most of them seem minimal improvements).
>So far we know of the Battanian and Sturgian troop trees. Both of them include cavalry -ALL THE TROOP TREES HAVE BEEN SHOWN DURING GC 2018 BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE EXTREMELY SUBJECT TO CHANGE, MORE AT ELEVEN- Well they indeed changed. The empire gets its BIG IMPERIAL XBOW BOLTS back.


>>WHEN IS MUH BANNERLORD

EARLY ACCESS ON 31st OF MARCH 2020 !

A thank you from Armagan :

And a thank you and well done to those anon who stayed on the general while not shitting it up all this time. And to those we lost along the way.

We're going to make it bros.

"Bruh what about the early access ? /v/ told me it will not be feature complete". Well here's the list of features that will be missing upon the release of early access (as of 20/02/2020):
>Some locales will reuse maps (they're supposed to all have unique maps upon full release)
>"Quest Content: A portion of planned quests may be missing entirely, and those in the game may be using placeholder maps, animations, etc."
>full game controller support (who fucking cares, Jesus Christ...)
>"some skill and perk effects" given that we just found 259 different perk icons in the beta files this comes out as no surprise.
>crafting
>some aspects of sieges. Expect most siege weapons to not be usable or all of them.
>(some aspects of) clan, army and kingdom management. This is pretty fucking large so yeah, don't hold your breath.
