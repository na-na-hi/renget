# __**OUTDATED!**__
# __**[ INFINITY BUILD FOR DUMMIES ]**__

As for 5.4, this is outdated!!!

Mobius ER strategy aka infinity cycle / Mind Sync strat / mobiloop is a way to clear ER, or to make infinitely big dps (damage-per-screenshot).
It's quite nice to use at high difficulties (130D and higher) but requires a lot of rng luck.
It also can enable even *zero-gear weak characters* (hello Kallen) to clear much higher difficulties than they can, potentially even 130D.

-> *Note: This will stop working in version 5.4, which will come mid-Jan 2022* <-

To actually run that you *generally* need these signets *at least*:
1) **Lodging [C] +3**
2) **Newborn [X] +3**
3) **Dead [X]**

Preferably you get **Unknown [X]** after that for comfyness and max **Dead [X] +3** for actual damage.
The former also enables you to use supports other than VC+BK, while the latter is actually a must for high-difficulty runs.
*Reminder: all **[X]** Mobius signets are Enhanced signets, they require Core signet first.*

Things to note:
1) Minimum requirements can be much lower when using a character with high frequency of attacks (e.g. BKE is fine without signet upgrades). Most ER characters can actually sustain the loop with just +3+1, +1+3 or +2+2 levels on **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]**.
2) Mobius build can't 130D+ alone with bad bad signets, so other good signets are still required, preferably not TDM%
3) In the end of this article there are little helpful moments I didn't know where to put \\(^_^)/ 

There are several ways (styles?) to execute this strat.

___

### __[ First option = "Chill and mighty!" ]__

Play normally ( https://rentry.co/ElysianRealm ) before Benares, then start building Mobius signets. 
That is the best and most convenient way, assuming you're using a well-geared character that basically can't clear **16F** only by a tiny margin. 
Otherwise (if you're undergeared) you probably won't be able to clear Benares or Heimdall.

Everything you need to know here is the infinity cycle requirements above and some general misc ER info:
\> Bonus Reward floors are 4F, 7F, 11F and 15F. *How to remember those easily: these are the last non-boss floors in their respective landscapes* (landscapes change every 4 floors).
\> Phyllis shop floors are: 5-6F once, 9-10F once, 13-14F once. *How to remember those easily: these are the last two floors before Bonus Reward floors.*

The other options are different ways to finish infinity cycle before Benares. 
Crazy? Yes! 
What's also crazy? Clearing 130-150D with f2p Kallen!
The next options are exactly for that.
 **If you're going to use the options below, prepare to suffer, potentially for a few hours**  

___

### __[ Second option = "Standard mobiloop abuse" ]__

The basic outline of the run:
\> __Before starting__: Equip **"Forbidden Seed"** sigil. Use VKE + VC supports.
\> __2F-4F__: Pick **Lodging [C]** (Support CDR) before getting Core Mobius signet with 2 other signets (like **Dark Pupil [T]**, **Lip Poison [E]** or **Entwined [P]** /  ELF SP, summoned TDM% or enemies dmg taken%)
\> __5F__: Get **Newborn [X]**.
\> __6F__: Firstly, reroll portals until you get a Mobius portal or tun out of rerolls. Then change your sigil to to **"The First Scale"**. Then check the shop and buy a Mobius Enhanced signet if you can (cases below). Then upgrade **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** as high as you can. _Also change the supports to BKE + VC!_
\> __7F__: Get **Dead [X]+1**.

NO NEED FOR ANY BONUS REWARD.
4F might take you ~4 minutes.
7F might take you ~6-12 minutes.

This is the standard run using Mobius strategy. There might be some slight differences depending on your luck:
Case | Solution
------ | ------
There's no **Newborn [X]** at **5F**   | Pick any other Enhanced signet (**Unknown [X]** preferably) and pray for another signet (**Dead [X]** or **Newborn [X]**) in Phyllis Shop. Buy it, then max **Lodging [C]** as high as you can. Get the 3rd Enhanced Mobius signet at **7F**. *Don't forget to change the sigil and supports*. If you don't have a Mobius Enhanced signet available for purchase in Phyllis Shop, finalize the run.
Phyllis shop has **Unknown [X]+1** available for purchase   | Firstly, reroll portals leading to **7F** when you still have **Forbidden Seed** sigil equipped, you *must* a Mobius portal. Then equip **The First Scale**, and only then buy **Unknown [X]+1**. Then proceed to upgrading **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** if you can.
Phyllis shop has **Dead [X]+1** available for purchase   | Firstly, reroll portals leading to **7F** when you still have **Forbidden Seed** sigil equipped, you *might* get a Mobius portal. Then equip **The First Scale**, and only then buy **Dead [X]+1**. Then proceed to upgrading **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** if you can.
Rerolls ended but **7F** portal doesn't lead to Mobius   | Don't lose hope and check the Phyllis Shop. If you can buy **Dead [X]** or **Unknown [X]**, swap sigil to **The First Scale**, then buy. After that / else, upgrade **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** levels. Lastly. swap sigil to **Home Lost** (don't forget to swap supports to VC+BKE __beforehand__).

Speaking about **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** levels... If you don't feel comfortable with having them only at +1+3 or +2+2 or even lower, consider the next option.

___

### __[ Third option = "Slowly but surely" ]__

In this variation we use **The First Scale** from the very beginning. Other than that, it's the same as the standard run, but safer in terms of ability to sustain the loop.

Using **The First Scale** from the start means:
1) You receive all Mobius signets already upgraded to +1 level.
2) You get Mobius portals less frequently.

Implications of those: 
1) You save some **Silver Coins** for upgrades = you can upgrade signets further!
2) It's difficult to keep getting Mobius portals until 7F = you need to restart even more.

Anyway, let's reiterate on the outline:
\> __Before starting__: Equip **"The First Scale"** sigil. Use VKE + VC supports.
\> __2F-4F__: Pick **Lodging [C]+1** (Support CDR) before getting Core Mobius signet with 2 other signets (like **Dark Pupil [T]+1**, **Lip Poison [E]+1** or **Entwined [P]+1** /  ELF SP, summoned TDM% or enemies dmg taken%)
\> __5F__: Get **Newborn [X]+1**.
\> __6F__: Firstly, reroll portals until you get a Mobius portal or tun out of rerolls. Then check the shop and buy a Mobius Enhanced signet if you can. Then upgrade **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** as high as you can (should be able to max them if you didn't purchase an Enhanced signet). _Also change the supports to BKE + VC!_
\> __7F__: Get **Dead [X]+1**.

___

### __[ Fourth option = "The Scale Gambit" ]__

This time we also use **The First Scale** from the very beginning.
In addition, we **don't use Phyllis Shop** before Benares.

Implications of not using Phyllis Shop at 6F: 
1) Your **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** are only +1 level.
2) On the other hand, you also have **Unknown [X]+1** that helps sustaining the loop even better than levels on **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]**.
3) However, getting all portals until 7F (6 portals in total) leading to Mobius requires much more luck than getting only 5 portals (without 6F, because Phyllis door is guaranteed). More random-dependent events = more time spent restarting ER over and over. 

Anyway, let's reiterate on the outline:
\> __Before starting__: Equip **"The First Scale"** sigil. *This time, use BKE + VC supports from the start.*
\> __2F-4F__: Pick **Lodging [C]+1** (Support CDR) before getting Core Mobius signet with 2 other signets (like **Dark Pupil [T]+1**, **Lip Poison [E]+1** or **Entwined [P]+1** /  ELF SP, summoned TDM% or enemies dmg taken%)
\> __5F-7F__: Get **Newborn [X]+1** > **Dead [X]+1** > **Unknown [X]+1**

___

### __[ Bonus option = "Holy Lance" ]__
##### This option requires Bright Knight character unlocked.

This option uses Bright Knight valkyrie with VKE+VC supports.
Basically, other than that, you can follow any other option above, with a slight difference:
* BKE can prolong the loop duration using high frequency attacks, making her able to use VKE+VC supports even with Lodging+1 and Newborn+1.

Basically that means she has more freedom, so you can either use lowest-CD supports with low Lodging/Newborn levels or she can make use of spamming VKE high dmg, or just be less random-reliant.

### __[ Misc stuff ]__

* Combinations of basic signets to get from 2F to 4F **in order of dps potential**:
**Lodging [C] + Entwined [P] + Lip Poison [E]** for the most dmg output
**Lodging [C] + Lip Poison [E] + Rodent [V]**
**Lodging [C] + Lip Poison [E] + Dark Pupil [T]**
**Lodging [C] + Entwined [P] + Rodent [V]**
**Lodging [C] + Entwined [P] + Dark Pupil [T]**
**Lodging [C] + Rodent [V] + Dark Pupil [T]**

* Sometimes you might need **Dark Pupil [T]** to sustain the loop (especially so if your Jingwei ELF still has no SP-related skills leveled).

* At 6F: After you upgrade **Lodging [C]** and **Newborn [X]** as high as you can, upgrade **Dark Pupil [T]** with leftover coins if you can (just in case).

* Tesla:Zero ELF greatly reduces requirements for the infinite loop. Use it if you can!
