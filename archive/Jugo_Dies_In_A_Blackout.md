#Hospital Killer Kills a Saiyan

The Hospital Killer was going to make his move. He had worked up his courage for a LONG time. He was gonna murder his first person!

Having made his own Quirk gadget out of parts he stole, he was one of the fastest people in Japan. He had to be, because this wasn't gonna be pretty.

Zooming through the wiring of the hospital, the Killer was looking at his available tagets.

**%cyan%"Old lady with cancer... boring."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"Sick little girl... meh."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"Ugh! None of these boring people will get me a damn Wikipedia page..."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"UwU! What's this?"%%**

Peaking through an outlet, the killer saw a hospital room with some buff bitch sleeping in it.

**%cyan%"Yeah, I know her! I saw her on TV! Some stupid hero kid! Yeah, this'll be great!"%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

A hand made of blue sparks reached out of an outlet, and it started mindlessly unplugging things. One thing was bolted in, but he brought a screwdriver so it was no longer bolted in. The killer was new to this, so he didn't really know what he was doing. All he knew was that he wanted to mess around for a while.

**%cyan%"She's still sleeping?! Time for plan b."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**


A blue hand reached out of an outlet, holding a firecracker.

##**%red%POP!%%**

**%cyan%"...NOTHING?! Ugh. I'm bored."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**


Disturbed by the noise, nurses (and a security guard) rushed into the room, but they found nothing but the sleeping patient, unplugged cords, and a couple screws. They assumed it was simply some freak Quirk ability. That day, the killer instead swapped an old man's pills with placebo sugar pills. He wasn't sure if it worked; he didn't see anything in the news about it. Or the memorials.

It's been some time since the killer's first attempt at murder. It wasn't flashy. It was subtle. And it might not have even worked. He had to be more... exciting.

**%cyan%"Is that cheap, gross, beefy chick still here?!"%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"Nope, not her!"%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"Nuh uh!"%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"UGH! She's not here."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"...But that guy seems familiar."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

Cogs and gears turned in the killer's head. He *had* seen him somewhere before.

He was definitely related to that buff chick. A memory returned, of them fighting on the killer's dingy TV, in his dingy apartment.

Did he win?
Did he lose?
Eh.
Didn't matter.
He was popular enough.

...Maybe too popular.

Men in black suits were in his hospital room. 
They looked... serious.

**%cyan%"I don't really want too much governmental attention..."%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"What if they keep my news story hush-hush?!"%%**

##**%cyan%BZZZT!%%**

**%cyan%"Ooh, I know! I just need to make a news story unavoidable!"%%**

In Jugo's room, surrounded by men in black suits, he slept soundly as the lightbulbs illuminating his room shattered.

In his dreams, floating in a deep, strange void, he felt a few shards of glass land on him.

Then, something bigger fell on him.

A formless blob laid on his chest, and his blurry mind started to shape it while it laid still.

It seemed to have... a handle.

What is this weird shape?

The formless blob began to change its structure, as his  mind engraved a texture onto it.

Heh!

It's a coffee mug with a waffle-like texture!

Oh, wait.

Uh, no, it's a...

Grenade!

Huddled over in his dark bedroom, littered with empty bottles of soda, and also a few bottles of urine, the Hospital Killer stared at his computer.

He was on Wikipedia.

##*Son Jugo*
*Son Jugo... was...*

He just skimmed for "was."

**%cyan%"YEAH! CONFIRMED KILL!"%%**

##*Death*
*At 10:14 p.m. Pacific... blackout... weapon identified... assailant unknown... investigations ongoing...*

He just skimmed again.

**%cyan%"WHAAAAAAT?! I DON'T HAVE MY OWN PAGE!?"%%**
