#Dinner For Three

Yui's head rests on her knees. One hand digs into a bag of marshmallows and pops one of the sugary treats into her mouth while the other clutches a doll.

It was the one she'd started first but the only one she couldn't bring herself to finish. The sewn-in ruby-like eyes give away that it's a diminutive version of her own form. Aside from that, not even a tuft of hair marks it. She hadn't even been able to decide on clothing despite how relatively few items she actually owned. A thousand different ideas seemed to pop into her head for what she might dress it in and she'd gotten the materials to make more than a few of them. The most recent additions were a few scraps of colorful fabric to replicate her clown costume.

It was a good month — maybe even a great one. Being stuck in a place only a little bigger than her own with five other people and a rat wasn't great, but everything else surrounding that easily made it worth it. Having Popsy of all people training her felt unreal enough. Then there was how close she felt to everyone. It felt like a real ~~family~~ team and she belonged in it. There were plenty of reasons to choose the outfit she'd worn for the experience.

*But is it right?*

Yui's eyes shift to the collection of finished dolls modeled after her classmates and a few other people. They were all neatly huddled together in a nice box she'd found to store them, dressed either in costume or what Yui felt best represented them.

She winces and turns away as they stare back, seeming to also question her indecision.

The desire to make them had snuck up on her months ago. She just felt something, then her hands started doing something. She wasn't even sure if she wanted to give them away. But Christmas was around the corner and that was the only chance she really had offloading them on her friends without question. Besides, if they were gone then she couldn't compare her unfinished mess to them.

***BZZZT BZZZT BZZZT***

Yui's phone noisily vibrates in her pocket. When she checks it, she sees that several messages have come in over the last minute.

> -> [Nene] <-
>Yui-chan~
>I have a surprise~
>If you wait too long it'll get cold!
>And so will I <3
>You aren't asleep, are you?
>Or worse, you already ate!
>We were supposed to eat together and then you'd fall asleep in my arms...

The delinquent rolls her eyes and shakes her head, deciding that she doesn't need to read any more before getting up. She puts the lid on the box and throws her doll into a corner as she heads to the door. Ako is already waiting there, sitting proudly and staring a laser into the door. When Yui opens it, both seem to eye the catgirl suspiciously. In Nene's arms is a large KFC bucket with a festive design and slung over her shoulder is a bag with who knows what inside. A Santa hat adorns her head to match the red dress she's wearing.

"Dinner for two~?"

The thought of shutting the door and going to bed earns serious consideration. Even without the barrage of texts or choice of words, her intentions couldn't have been clearer. You didn't decide to spend Christmas Eve with just anyone. So, letting the catgirl in meant... Yui wasn't exactly sure what it meant, but she did know it'd probably lead to her looking redder than the few decorations she had handmade. That much was fine — it was practically a qualifier for spending any amount of time with Nene — but the uncertainty was unbearable. Nene had always claimed she was, but how serious was *this*? 

"Look, I...

*I'm too busy playing with dolls? Ugh. Why'd she have to make it weird? Why can't I just tell her to screw off?*

Nene's tail stands high, twitching slightly in anticipation as she waits for an answer. It reminds Yui of the way Ako acts when she comes home after a long day. Currently, her tail was angrily thumping against the floor but that was at least progress compared to the start of the month. It seemed neither of them really had it in them to reject the catgirl's offer when she was so clearly fond of it.

Yui clenches her eyes shut and grumbles a few curses as she shakes her head. She moves out of the doorway and crosses her arms while looking away.

"Those things have cakes right? Just don't get the wrong idea."

"Of course~! You can have as much as you want! Well, maybe save me a little slice."

The delinquent grunts. She wasn't quite sure what the right idea was, but it was too late for further consideration now.

Nene practically skips inside as she finds a place to sit and lay out their meal. A much easier feat with everything more organized. Yui had made an effort to fix the place up some before leaving for her internship, but its current state was mostly thanks to the catgirl to whom she'd entrusted her home while she was gone. Ako was less than thrilled about the whole situation, but both cats seemed to have reached an understanding.

Still, there wasn't much furniture to speak of. It was really only a single giant cushion accompanied by some blankets. As Nene settles in, Yui prepares Ako a meal of her own. When she looks over, the catgirl is setting up a laptop and some speakers.

"Dinner n' a show?"

"Not exactly. I thought we could use some ambiance ~"

Nene winks as she presses a button on the keyboard and the sound of fire crackling starts up.

"It won't make the place any warmer, but I'm sure we can figure something out~"

"Tch. Whatever. You're lucky there's only one seat."

Yui refocuses on Ako, setting her food down and giving the cat a scratch under the chin before walking over to join her guest. Nene takes out a couple of candles and lights them with her quirk, the blue flame dancing on the wicks as the smell of 'firewood' permeates the room. The delinquent couldn't deny that there was something nice about the artificial fireplace. It was almost worrying how good the catgirl could be at making her feel comfortable, but she couldn't let a friend being a friend bother her.

As Nene continues setting up a few other decorations, the delinquent unceremoniously plops down and sinks into the cushion. She resists the urge to start with the cake and instead reaches for a crispy piece of chicken. If this was *that* sort of thing, then this was how she preferred it.

"Hey, Yui-chan. What's this?"

Yui looks in the catgirl's direction and nearly chokes on her food. In Nene's hand is the unfinished doll she discarded before answering the door.

*How the hell am I supposed to explain that without sounding like a creep?*

"Er, you don't have to tell me if it's private."

"It's not like that. It's just- I felt like makin' some dolls. Couldn't finish that one."

"Hmm? Why not?"

"Don't know what I should do."

Nene hums as she saunters over with the doll in hand and takes a seat next to Yui.

"Oh, I know! Why not give it some twin tails and a maid dress? It'll be super cute~"

The delinquent finds herself choking again at the suggestion. There was nothing inherently wrong with the suggestion but given *who* it was a doll of, Yui wasn't sure whether to be angry or embarrassed. She unconsciously twirls a lock of hair around her finger as her face turns a shade of red.

"T-That so?"

"Yeah! The Jersey style is *super* popular right now."

"So — and I ain't saying it's what's gonna happen — that's how you'd want her?"

"Mmm. Well, I'm sure anything you pick would be just as cute~ You don't need to decide now, do you?"

"Uh, I guess not. It'd just be nice to have some direction, y'know?"

Yui curls up into herself as she glances at the doll before looking away again.

"I mean, what if you thought you were getting a maid and you got a...a clown or somethin'?"

She cringes slightly and exhales through her teeth, realizing she's probably said too much. Nene doesn't hesitate to slide closer and take one of the delinquent's hands. She places the doll in Yui's palm and squeezes it as she smiles.

"Then I'm sure it'd be a su~per cute clown."

"Ugh! You don't mean that!"

Without thinking, Yui shoves the catgirl away. A wave of regret crashed into her immediately at the sight of Nene's hurt expression, but she wasn't wrong. She *knew* she wasn't. People expected things and she was never good at meeting those expectations. Things were never just okay when she didn't.

Her lips mouth the words 'I'm sorry'. Or maybe it was something closer to 'go away' to fit her own frustrated and hurt look. She isn't sure. Regardless, nothing comes out and the delinquent settles for burying her head in her knees. It was too much. All of it. She didn't feel like fighting even if she didn't know what else to do.

Ako looks up from her meal to look between her master and their guest. She gives Nene an expectant, and somewhat threatening, glare. The catgirl returns it with a slightly annoyed expression that seems to say 'I know' as she picks herself up inches back towards Yui. It couldn't be clearer that this was about more than just a doll, so it would require some tact.

"We've known each other for a while now, right?"

"Yeah."

"You don't think you've surprised me at all?"

"...Have I?"

"Duh!"

Nene rubs into Yui's side with a purr. The delinquent huffs, annoyed at how effective the small bit of affection is but also thankful. When she glances up, she meets the catgirl's self-satisfied look with one of skepticism.

"So what?"

"So, I haven't complained so far. I'll like whatever you choose. And even if I don't...I'll still like you."

"Really?"

"Really."

Nene's hand slowly slides into place atop Yui's. Without a layer of cloth and stuffing between them, there's only the warmth of each other's skin. The catgirl's fingers settle into the grooves of Yui's knuckles as they intertwine and she starts rubbing circles into the side of the delinquent's hand with her thumb. The false fire seems more real than seemingly possible as Yui starts to feel feverish from the heat. Her eyes stay locked on Nene's, mesmerized and waiting for whatever she plans to do next.

***"Merwooow!***"

A mix of orange, black, and white fur comes between the two as Ako nuzzles against Yui, her tail batting Nene on the nose. The delinquent's brain catches up to the situation and she turns away bashfully but doesn't let go of the catgirl's hand.

"Look like she's done eating. We, uh, should do that."

"It would be a waste..."

Nene sighs and quickly shoots a glare at Ako while Yui isn't looking.

"But, I don't mind treating you tomorrow too~ Just me and Yui-chan spending Christmas together~"

"That'd be...nice."

Although her expression is hidden, the light squeeze from her hand tells Nene all she needs to know. The catgirl sticks her tongue out triumphantly while Ako puts on an act of indifference despite her angrily swishing tail.
