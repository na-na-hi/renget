##Kon Talkyl

First, Kon. Autistic Ataru Appreciator.

**Race**: Human (Enhanced with Strong, Agile, Tough, Quick Reflexes, and all of this increased by Athletics 2)

His **Complications** are *Blind and Impatience (Removed).*

The *serene* perk increases his focus, and probably helps him keep his Force Powers going as well. He is **blind**, but compensates this through *Force Sense* + *Farsight*


####Basic Force Powers
#####Telekinesis
Useful, specially for unexpected applications, since he can probably target things he perceives through Force Sense or Farsight. Is also overall stronger thanks to the *Powerful* perk.

#####Force Barrier
It's an offshoot application of telekinesis. Decent, could be used to block a hit from the enemy before it breaks while Kon repositions again, but otherwise not remarkably useful.

#####Force Sense and Farsight
Kon's way of percieving the world. Enhanced through Awareness 2 and probably the power he's most used to. Combined with Farsight it could grant him hyperawareness of the battlefiled, great for maneuvering around with his lightsaber form and keeping track of an otherwise unmanageable number of variables, both of his opponents and on the environment. His reflexive uses of the Force are also enhanced, which could help him pull off a clutch Force Barrier before taking damage.

#####Force Control
Perfect for fighting, could increase his agility even more, buffing his Ataru and Sokan performance.

#####Mental Shields
 Kon's mental fortitude is reinforced by Mental Shields, providing protection against telepathic intrusions and psychological attacks. Combined with Serene this would make his train of thought in battle very hard to disrupt.

####Advanced Force Powers
#####Force Body
Great for endurance and survivability. A great lifeline in case things go south and he takes damage.

#####Battle Precognition
Battle Precognition provides Kon with foresight specifically tailored for combat scenarios, and it seems specially useful when combined with his super awareness, since he is keeping track of everything around him a few moments into the future.

###Lightsaber stuff
Double-bladed with dueling lens for extra speed. Tr√°kata is very interesting because he might be able to turn off just one of his blades, increasing the maneuvers he can perform to distrup the enemy.

His focus on Ataru and Sokan are well supported by the rest of his build, with Force Control increasing agility, Force Sense + Farsight + Awareness 2 keeping track of everything around him and lastly Battle Precognition for a very solid and impactful addition to both offense and defense.

Form Purism and his Natural Warrior perk increase the efficiency of his Sokan form even more, augmenting his accuracy and skill. 

He seems incredibly hard to deal wih, jumping around and seizing every advantage he can get from the battlefield. Would have benefited a lot from tireless.

###Nexios
Now for Nexios, the Superior Sith Specimen

**Race**: Sith (Enhanced with Tough, Strong, Quick Reflexes, Tireless, Agile and Athletics 2)

A species thta is naturally gifted with a deep connection to the Dark Side of the Force, and can even be sustained by it. They have better senses that humans. In Nexios's case he's enhanced beyond normal Sith limits by Athletics 2.

His **Complications** are *Wrath, Arrogance, Attachment, Phobia (Removed), Greed (Removed), Tempestuous, Amputee, Notorious*. Wrath and Arrogance can empower him, but can also become exploitable flaws for his enemies, since it could lead to overconfidence and uncontrollable outbursts of rage that can make him vulnerable in battle.

###Basic Force Powers
####Telekinesis
Very basic Force power, with increased strength since Nexios has the *Powerful* perk.

####Healing (Force Drain)
The ability to siphon energy and vitality from others. Again, being enhanced with the *Powerful* perk this power is extremely dangerous, since Nexios could be used to sustain himself and deplete the strength from his opponent, specially in a lightsaber duel, as both fighters are within melee range.

####Control (Force Rage)
Force rage augments the user's strength, speed, agility, endurance, stamina and ferocity by channelling negative emotions such as anger or fear. It differs from normal force control in that the user is left exhausted and weakened afterwards. The enhancement would be increased by the *Powerful* perk, and the *Tireless* perk could mitigate the exhaustion as well as increase time it can remain activated. Still, it's a double edged sword.

####Confusion (Force Fear)
The ability to induce morale-rending terror through force of will. Can be used to create openings in the defenses of an enemy. As with the other powers, it is enhanced by the *Powerful* perk.

####Mental Shields
The ability to resist mental attacks. Being an advanced user and having the *Powerful* perk, Nexios could probably use it to mess with Kon's perception through Force Sense, making keeping track of him harder.

####Empathy (Fear Sense)
The ability to sense fear, could be used to sense doubts and moments of weakness in the opponent, allowing the user to capitalize in them to create openings.

###Advanced Force Powers

####Tutaminis
When faced with blaster bolts, lightsaber strikes, or even other Force-based attacks, Nexios can harness this ability to not only deflect but absorb the energy. The *Powerful* perk amplifies the effectiveness of his Tutaminis, making him capable of withstanding and redirecting even more potent assaults. Combined with his armor and Beskar limbs his defense is incredibly high and effective.

####Force Body
Enhanced survivability that improves his defense. Even if his defenses (tutaminis, Beskar Armor and Beskar limbs) are bypassed, Nexios could continue fighting as Force body allows the user to live through otherwise fatal injuries.

####Force Lightning
Potentially lethal bursts of electrical energy that have their power increased as the resto of his abilities. They branch out into several smaller bolts allowing him to either target multiple opponents or cover a large area. Being electrical energy it could be grounded or even redirected back at the user, but doing so is extremely hard and would require a great deal of endurance and power. Unless a victim of Force Lighting receives treatment and rest, the debilitating damage and pain caused by this power can become chronic.

###Lightsaber Stuff
Djem So purist using a standard red lightsaber. Nexios lacks mobility, but his defense is great. Djem So is a counterattack-based defensive form that relies on powerful and unexpected bursts of offense when the enemy least expects it. With Tutaminis and his Beskar defense Nexios could possibly withstand an assault from someone with better mobility until he finds the chance to counterattack.

Nexios can turn to the offense instantly and return to defense as needed, without much issue. His strong telekinesis and Force Lightning could be used to compensate for his lack of movement.



###Syko
Now, Syko the Seriously Schizophrenic Sith.

**Race**: Gen'Dai (Enhanced with Tough, Strong, Quick Reflexes, Tireless, Agile and Athletics 2)

Syko's a Gen'Dai. He can regenerate, regrow lost limbs in minutes, has near-instant relfexes by default and incredible hearing. His only weakness is his brain, lacking any other organs. His regeneration is enhanced by Tough, his endurance by Tireless and his relfexes increased by Quick Reflexes. All of this increased past the natural limits of his species because of Athletics 2. He does suffer from Gen'Dai psychosis, so his violent tendencies are increased.

His **Complications** are *Wrath, Senseless (Touch), Deadly Secret, Impatience (Removed), Smooth Operator, Unsavory, Savior.*

Wrath could empower him, being a Sith, but it could also hinder him a bit since it'll increase his bloodthirst when combined with his psychosis. It'd be more crippling if he still had Impatience, since he could be baited into lashing out without thinking, but witt that complication removed it will be a lot harder.

###Basic Force Powers
####Telekinesis
Basic Force power enhanced through the *Powerful* perk. Goes well with his Niman Form.

####Force Sense
Increased by  *Powerful* again. Enhances his insane perception form his race.

####Force Control
A nice boost for his overall high physical abilities.

###Advanced Force Powers
####Force Immunity
Immunity to mental attacks and paralyzing effects. Not that useful in this scenario.

####Shatterpoint
Requires concentration, which could be harder to achieve being insane, with the *Wrath* complication, and being in the middle of battle. But it isn't completely impossible. A very useful prophetic ability that can also detect weak points and break through obstacles and defenses.

####Force Repulse
AoE damage that knocks back everything around him, and with the *Powerful* perk it might be able to disintegrate enemies.

####Battle Precognition
Perfect synergy with his already incredible speed and reflexes. Could be used to counter and overwhelm Kon's own Battle Precognition.

####Force Body
Given that Gen'Dai only have a single thing that could kill them (besides total annihilation), Syko could probably use Force body to survive brain destruction.

###Lightsaber Stuff
Syko uses a scythe instead of a convenional lighstaber. It has several mods. Dual Phase to change length in the middle of battle, increasing his reach and flexibility. Dueling Lens for extra speed on his attacks and swings. Concealed and Waterproofed too.

Juyo Mastery for some fast and unpredictable attacks, and he also has Niman for a balanced form where he can weave Force Powers between moves.
He has Advanced Telekinetic Combat, Specialist Lightsaber Combat and Unorthodox. Given his Unarmed 2 skill and overpowered physical capabilities, he could fight unarmed while also attacking with his telekinetically controlled scythe.

Asa fighter he seems hard to predict, as he moves at speeds that are difficult to match, is not hindered by wounds and uses really unorthodox methods, all boosted by the *Natural Warrior* perk.




##Misc Overview
###Skills
They all share the same martial Skills (Athletics 2, Awareness 2) with the exception of Kon only having Unarmed 1, while the Sith have Unarmed 2.

Athletics 2 boosts physical abilities beyond the limits of their respective species. Kon may be evenly matched against Nexios when it comes to Athletics (with the exception of their senses, where Nexios would have a slight advantage). Syko is the one that gains the most benefits out of Athletics 2, as his race already had incredible natural advantages.

Kon does have the Investigation 2 skill, which can help with his Sokan maneuvers, as it helps him pick up details that could be useful in battle.

###Perks
Again, they share most perks, with the exception of *Tireless*, which Kon lacks. So the Sith have an advantage over him when it comes to their endurance and stamina.

He does have the *Serene* perk, which means his concentration is far better, and his focus is basically unwavering.


##Battle Overview
In a 2vs1 face-off against Nexios and Syko, Kon's in a real bind. Splitting them before a straight-up brawl seems like the smart move, given Kon's Awareness 2. Tricky because the Sith have that skill as well, but not impossible, since he has better perception through Farsight so he could sense them before they sense him.

Now, Kon's got the Ataru Purism and Sokan skills to turn the environment into his playground, but Nexios and Syko aren't dumb enough to stroll into an obvious trap. No blind wandering into a danger zone for them. 

His best option would be to !>crush them with his spaceship lmao

Jokes aside, the best path for him is engaging Nexios pronto after the split. Nexios is a defense powerhouse with strong Force powers, but Kon's got the upper hand in speed and Battle Precognition. If he can't blitz Nexios (and that's a big "if" with Nexios's defenses and Force Body), it might be time to high-tail it out of there.

There is a viable, if risky, option for Kon against Nexios. First he separates them, and here's where Kon could get crafty. Baiting Nexios into unleashing Force Rage might just be the ace up his sleeve. Now, Force Rage amps up Nexios's capabilities, but it's a double-edged lightsaber. The risky play for Kon would be to let Nexios go all out, then hang back and wait for the rage to run its course. 

 If Kon times it right and plays the waiting game, Nexios could be left drained and exhausted once the Force Rage party is over. The risky part it's thanks to Nexios having the Tirless and Powerful perks, and Kon lacking  the former. It could cause this waiting game to go on for longer than expected, and in that time Syko could get back into the fight, or Kon could run out of energy. Kon's got to be quick on his feet, literally, and assess whether the gamble of waiting out Nexios's Force Rage is worth the potential payoff.

Kon might have his incredible mobility and Battle Precognition, and yeah, it's an insane advantage. But Nexios is tanky; he's got Beskar armor, Beskar limbs, and Tutaminis amped up with the Powerful perk. That's like a triple threat of "good luck trying to hurt me."

Nexios's lightsaber form is all about counterattacks. That means every swing Kon takes at him is a potential opening for Nexios to hit back harder.  Kon can't afford to slip up because, let's face it, one solid counter from Nexios could spell trouble.

With Battle Precognition, Kon can see Nexios's moves before they even happen. Every swing, every counter, Kon's got it mapped out before Nexios even gets the chance to flex those Beskar muscles. He could see the effects of his attacks beforehand, and decide not to risk it. But then he could end up stuck dodging for longer than he should.

With that Ataru Purism and Sokan combo, Kon's mobility is off the charts. He's flipping, spinning, and basically making himself a hard target. Picture Kon darting around, using every rock, pillar, or piece of debris as cover. He's leaping onto platforms, balconies, or even the low-hanging branches of a conveniently placed tree. Nexios swings low, but Kon's dancing in the air, striking from above and making himself a moving target that's a pain to lock onto. If they're in a rocky or unstable environment, Kon could trigger controlled collapses or rockslides.

So, here's the conundrum. Kon's untouchable, yes, but getting through Nexios's defenses is going to be a marathon rather than a sprint. The longer the battle, the greater the risk for Kon. He can bank on piercing through Nexios's defenses, but it's a high-stakes gamble that could leave Kon weary.

In this case Kon might exploit Nexios's Wrath and Arrogance complications to tip the scales in his favor. Nexios, fueled by these emotions, opens a window of opportunity for Kon. However, here's the dangerous flip side: feeding Nexios's emotions might also make him stronger. Wrath and arrogance, if harnessed properly, can enhance a Sith's power. Nexios, less careful but more powerful, could still be very lethal.

Things get real dicey for Kon once Syko steps up to the plate.

Syko's got his own Battle Precognition to match Kon's, and his reflexes are on another level. But wait, there's more. Syko's basically unkillable. Gen'Dai physiology that makes him not care about injuries, regeneration, the Tough perk cranking up his healing, and Athletics 2 on top of all this, making him more buff than your average Gen'Dai.  

Juyo mastery makes him hard to predict, Niman helps him include Force attacks empowered by his *Powerful* perk, and he also has Unorthodox, for extra unexpected twists to his fighting. Advanced Telekinetic Combat increases his options and reach since he can use his scythe at the same time as his Unarmed Combat 2 skill.

Even with terrain advantage and picking the battlefield himself, I can't see Kon beating Syko. The Sith might be more violent and  have a hard time controlling themselves in battle but it's not like Syko is going to wander into a place with a conveniently placed laser that could disintegrate him. At that point it'd be pure plot convenience, and it would disregard the choices of the Sith builds since they also have Awareness 2 for that extra paranoia.


##Final thoughts
In devising a strategy for survival against Nexios and Syko, Kon must leverage his keen perception to sense their presence in advance. Prior to direct engagement, a prudent approach involves tactically separating the Sith duo.

Then comes the blitz hoping to catch Nexios off guard. And if that doesn't work? Well, he might play a risky card, trying to tire Nexios out with Force Rage or taking advantage of his Sith temper tantrum. 

And then there's Syko. Kon should hope Syko doesn't crash the party too soon, and he's gotta stay on his toes, ready to bolt when the Gen'Dai lunatic makes his entrance.

!>Then drop his starfighter on them and pray
