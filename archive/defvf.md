closure

>At the visiting area, he waits patiently as she's called and brought out.
>Mari - notably more mature - is brought to her end of the plexiglass, escorted by two guards. 
>She looks tired. More than tired - the spark in her eye that she had as a teenager has all but been snuffed out completely. 
>When she sees exactly who's there to visit her, it takes a moment or two of processing to realize exactly who she's looking at. 
>The clarity washes across her face in waves of deep horror. 
>She sits, and shakily reaches for the receiver. 
>She has trouble meeting Sunny's eyes.
>Expecting to be berated, Mari is instead spoken to in a soft, gentle voice, much to her surprise. 
>Sunny asks her how she's been. 
>The response she gives comes out as an agitated whisper, something along the lines of 'what do you think?'. 
>She was still too scared to be fully angry. 
>And it isn't until Sunny mentions how beautiful she still is that she becomes completely flabbergasted.
>Confused, she asks him what he actually wants. 
>She expected him to just yell at her for twenty minutes then leave, like their mother and father does every so often. 
>Sunny, having already come this far and having dedicated himself to this path, quietly and carefully explains how badly he needs her. 
>He tells her of his struggles. His inability to connect with others, the fact that he sees and compares everyone to her.
>Everything leads back to her in his mind. 
>Sunny tells her how he thinks about what she did to him every single day, and how he hates her - not for what she did, but for showing him a glimpse of heaven before leaving his life forever. 
>Mari sits in silent shock and growing revulsion as Sunny continues to explain his feelings towards her - for her - until he finally, for the first time in years, feels at peace. 
>He asks her when she'll be released. 
>Dazedly, She tells him it's a manner of months away - she's managed to get some of her sentence reduced for good behavior.
>Sunny makes her a promise - much to her furthered confusion - and tells her that when the time comes, when she's free, he'll be there for her, to take her away from this nightmare. 
>Mari stares into his eyes.
>The eyes that used to light up at her hugs.
>The eyes she looked into as she held him when he was still so very small, when she made a promise to protect him.
>The eyes that would always look at her for guidance, so much trust and love behind it.

>The little brother she ruined.

>She felt like she was going to throw up.
