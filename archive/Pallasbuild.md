##Appearance
Pallas stands approximately 151cm tall. Quite unusual for a humie, his hair is pink in color, reaches down to his hips and is usually kept in a single braid. Aside from the hair on his head, eyebrows and eyelashes no other traces of hair can be found on his body. His eyes are violet and have an energetic look about them. Out on the sides his ears are completely normal. His nose is on the small side. Even further down his chest is completely flat. Down some more his butt is deliciously gropeable. In general his build is athletic, slender and, aside from his genitals, entirely androgynous though leaning towards the feminine. His skin is unremarkably fair. Muscle-wise, he seems to be quite fit.

In terms of clothing they can usually be found wearing their armor. Though through [Transmog] are also capable of showcasing quite the collection of other styles. Also fond of wearing more extravagant outfits when in a formal setting.

##Attitude
A cocky and confident noble scion who cares above all for improving his skil at arms and partying.
Bound to a chivalric code of conduct and always seeking a worthy challenge.
Considers magic to be unchivalrous despite the fact that he unconciously uses it himself.
Becomes remarkably timid when his older sister is mentioned.

##Plans
Become humanity's strongest knight
Find and tame a worthy mount
Acquire good armaments
Assemble a group of companions
Defeat great evils
Have a minimum of 3 songs dedicated to him

##Changelog
Dropped [Caustic Blood], [LOST], [Exhibitionist], [Bizarre Demeanour]
Lost [Demon Lord], [Ooga Booga], [Survival Guide], [Royal Rumble]
Gained [Convenient Backstory]

##Thoughts
A redesign of Pallas since the current headcannon on Greyweul conflicts with Pallas' lore.
Got rid of [Royal Rumble] in favor of having Pallas be a minor noble via [Convenient Backstory] instead.
Also took the opportunity to drop some unfitting Banes like [Caustic Blood] & [Exhibitionist].
Those points did have to come from somewhere though so I had to give up on T5 Endurance.
[Ooga Booga] seemed like the least useful Boon to lose so it was axed for points too.
Felt like Pallas' new backstory wouldn't really work with [LOST] anymore so it and [Survival Guide] were dropped in exchange for just spawning in Encore.

##Profile
[EOH Name]
Pallas d'Anaksang

[One line description]
Chivalric Knight who wants to be the strongest humie.

[Personality]
The very storybook image of a knight in shining armour, so long as he doesn't talk too much.
Though blessed with a noble upbringing, is actually rather disinterested in proper etiquette.
Bound to a chivalric code of conduct and never tells a lie (knowingly, at least).
Often blunt and to the point but is willing to make exceptions for certain people.
Scoffs at magic and considers it underhanded and unworthy of a true knight.
Doesn't actually realize he unconciously uses his Arka for physical strengthening.

[Backstory]
Pallas d'Anaksang was born as the 4th son of a minor noble family from Arka Numidia and doted on frequently by his many siblings, he seemed poised to lead a normal, if spoiled, life if only it weren't for his fascination with knighthood. 
Misfortune struck the family however when the boy went missing for several days when he was out playing in the woods. 
Immediately springing into action, they combed through the forest until they found their darling son in a cave, having been cursed by some manner of foul magic, twisting both his appearance and mind into an almost unrecognizable form.
Undeterred, his family naturally set out to correct the changes this "curse" had made after they learned they could not simply undo it. His older sister especially took to vigorously "re-educating" her baby brother into the perfect knight she knew he always wanted to be.

On the other side of this story we find Arc, smugly pleased with the scenario she has set up for yet another soul from Earth whom she will no doubt have fun bullying throughout the next five years.
