>You don't know why you're doing this
>You must, no, HAVE to be going crazy right?
>Getting woken up by the ghost of your dead best friend and her telling you how to break into her brother's house?
>Its madness! 
>Yet, the warm breeze of this summer night still blows through your hair
>The cyan blue of the streetlamp above shines down upon you as the Suzuki household grows ever closer
>But...you do miss him. 
>And from what Mari said, he needs some help. 
>You arrive at their doorstep and look under the second stepping stone out from the porch...huh. 
>Much to your surprise the house key is still there!
>It's pretty old and a bit rusty, it's probably been under here for years. 
>You take the Key and it clicks into the doorknob perfectly.
>The door creaks open into the pitch-black house.
>The fear of whatever curse has beset this place starts to get to you. 
>You shouldn't be doing this, here you are breaking into your dead best friend's house at 3 AM after driving home a day early to kidnap her brother. 
>But...you still need to help him. 
>Even if you have lost it and even if this is illegal, you still need to get him out of that house. 
>You walk into the blacked house and enter the mostly empty living room. 
>Before having time for the emotions to get to you, you are startled by the sound of a small metallic door closing and the hum of a microwave. 
>You peer around the corner into the kitchen and see him standing in front of the microwave. 
>He stares into the microwave with a sullen face bathed in yellow light. 
>His cheeks are sunken in, like this is his first meal in days. 
>All of your doughts from before have been set aside, he looks like hes starving!
>You need to let him know your here without scaring him. 
>You tap your nails aganist the drywall to hopefully alert him of your presence without having to scare him. 
>His head whips to the site as the light tapping sound reaches his ears. He is looking stright at you. 
>"H-hey Sunny-" As you walk out of the darkness and towards him he holds the knife towards you with a terrarified look on his face. 
>"Wait Sunny its just me! I'm Henrettia dont you remember? Please, just put down the knife." 
>He sets the knife in the sink and relaxes. 
>You open the fridge and see he is compltly out of food aside from whatever he put in the microwave.
>The machine lets out a loud beep and he clicks open the door. 
>Before he has a chance to dig into the warcrime of a steak, you stop him. 
>It looks pretty old and you don't want him to get sick. 
>Also if hes not used to eating much, a steak that big might just updet his stomache anyways!
>"Wait Sunny, don't eat that its old! I have food at my house." 
>You reach out your hand for him to take it but he walks foward and wraps his arms around you. 
>Your face goes red as Mari reappears to your side with a smug look on her face and hand to her chin. 
>"He always had a crush you know." She says while laughing to herself.
