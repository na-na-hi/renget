#Turmoil Rewrite
Bowser Jr. rushes into Bowser's throne room.

"Papa! Papa! Come quickly! I have something to show you!" Jr. exclaims.

Jr. grabs his father's hand and tries to pull him up, motivating Bowser to get off his throne and follow his son as Jr. continues to tug him forward. The two of them talk as they go to Jr.'s room.

"What is it Jr.? Have you completed your homework yet?"

Jr. gets a big smirk on his face hearing that.

"Actually this is about my homework dad! You know that science fair you wanted me to participate in? The one hosted by the Mushroom Kingdom that's happening next week? I've been working on it for a while now and I think you're gonna like it."

As Jr. continues to lead his father towards his room he goes on about his project.

"That Mario and his green sidekick. Always ruining papa's plans, always cheating whenever they can! If Mario and his brother want to be bullies then maybe they should pick on someone their own size!"

Finally arriving at his room Jr. opens the door for his father, the two of them now in a dark room. Jr. turns on his room's lights, revealing in the middle of the room two objects underneath a big curtain. Walking over to the two objects, he sees his father looking at his project, intrigued as to what it may be.

"I present to you papa, my science project!"

Jr. takes the curtain off his project to reveal two sleek metal figures standing right next to one another, their heads looking down at the ground. It's Mario and his brother... Yoshi?

Bowser Jr. starts to list off the various features of his two creations: "Metallic plating, resistant to everything those two pests could possibly throw at them. Metal Mario and his shiny buddy are even able to beat the dishonorable duo at their game, easily capable of outrunning and outjumping them."

Jr. turns both of them on. Their heads move upwards as the two of them both enter fighting positions.

"Bravissimo!" says Metal Mario.

"Luigi!" says Metal Yoshi.

Jr. pauses for a second before asking his father a question.

"What do you think papa?"

Seeing Jr. 's project Bowser immediately goes in to give his son a big hug.

"That's my boy! With this, the Mario chumps will finally be done for!"

Bowser gives a great laugh as he continues to hold Jr. in his arms. 

"You always make papa proud! Let's crash that science fair, get your gold trophy, and get my princess back!"

As Bowser and his son continue to bond with one another they begin to hatch a plan on invading the Mushroom Kingdomâ€™s science fair.

The real Mario brothers are unaware of the turmoil those metallic menaces are about to cause them.
