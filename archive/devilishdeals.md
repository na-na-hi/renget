>in an effort to pass your college exams you decide to summon a demon
>howdidwegehere.wav
>end up summoning a demon that specializes in astronomy instead
>fuck
>instead of being a giant owl with a floating crown above its head it looks like an owl anthro wearing a bathrobe
>he also looks depressed with all his messy feathers
>he takes one look at you and just asks what do you want
>say you want knowledge to pass your math exam
>"Alright fine, but I need something in return as all contracts do."
>welp looks like you'll lose your soul in exchange for a diploma
>however, he asks something different
>"Could you just, hold me for tonight?"
>an odd request but alright
>he suddenly sits on your lap and wraps his arms around you and lays his head on yours
>it was an awkward position but you reciprocate the hug
>you two were stuck like this for a few minutes, with the owl sighing like as if a weight just lifted off of him
>eventually he lets off and produces reading glasses and a book
>"Alright then, lets see how you fare against algebra. Couldn't be that much different with my daughter"

>its been a few days after your exam
>still waiting for the results to be posted
>after your encounter with Stolas, the goetian demon of astronomy, you've had a new perspective in life
>as in demons are actually real and they might be more chill than you expected
>at least you think Stolas is an exception
>still to be alive after summoning a real demon makes you giddy inside
>you wonder what else this expansion of reality has to offer
>but you're getting ahead of yourself
>you turn in for the night and wait for the day of the exam results
>but you wake up to feel something tickling your back
>let out a manly scream and find Stolas on your bed wearing the same bathrobe but now untied to show off his fluffy chest
>he was surprised by your reaction but you had to ask why he was here
>"Haven't you forgotten? Contracts with demons are for life. So I'm cashing in the amount I'm owed."
>owed in what you ask
>"All I ask is to be held, is that so hard? You don't need to think hard about this since this is the most generous agreement I have to offer darling."
>he didn't need to ask for your permission and he embraced you again, this time your face on his chest
>the owl sighed once more and rubbed your back
>you didn't have any room to complain but the idea of serving a demon for life seems dangerous
>but the deal for now is to just hug him?
>sounds easy enough
>you embrace the demon as well while inhaling his scent
>it honestly feels like hugging a large fluffy pillow

>fast forward to exam results day
>log in to your college website and look at your course was
>you pass with flying colors
>to think you end up here with a help of a demon
>speaking of whom, Stolas kept visiting you every night from now on
>he started to open up to you
>by that you mean he starts dropping info about his personal life
>his abusive wife, his estranged daughter, that one assassin he sleeps with in order for him to kill humans on earth
>that last one was concerning 
>but it all ends with you and him cuddling within each other's arms
>tonight you tell him of the results of your exam
>for the first time, he smiles
>"Oh that is wonderful! Truly, celebrations are in order."
>his excitement was infectious and you decide to order pizza for the two of you tonight
>as you wait for the food to arrive he resumes his position with him by your side 
>but instead of sitting next to you, he sits on your lap
>howdidigethere.jpg
>he decides to tell stories about himself to pass the time
>you tried to listen, but he keeps adjusting his seat which rubs your crotch in all the right ways
>try not to sport a boner under a guy who could end you instantly
>the door bell rings and you immediately leave his soda to pick up the pizza
>the delivery guy couldn't help but notice your boner and chuckle at himself
>"you waiting on a lady sir?"
>just tell him to shut up but leave a tip since he at least arrived early enough before stolas to notice your erection
>place the pizza on the coffee table and you two dig in

>you continue to shoot the shit 
>divulge on your reasons on taking a college course
>tell him you want to become an programmer for AI
>explain what the barebones of it since you are talking about a demon here
>"So if I were to summarize it correctly, you desire to create a companion?"
>agree with him as one of those reasons
>in truth, you thought building giant robots as a kid and it snowballed from there
>withholding the fact AI can be dangerous if pushed to its limits
>suddenly, he changes the topic to somewhere else
>"Well I must congratulate you for passing your exams, but I must ask if there's any more you need of me?"
>you couldn't think much of anything and say to him you'll think of something later
>your response seems to pull the wool over his eyes and he went back to being mopey
>"I see... but I still have the right to continue our current agreement correct?"
>you were confused on why he was asking but you nodded
>that seem to make him comfort him but you could tell he was thinking about something
>eventually, you two share the bed once more 
>but you could feel he held closer this time, as if you were gonna disappear on him

>a week has passed since that night
>except Stolas hasn't had a nightly visit since
>you were a little worried about the demon but that in itself surprised you
>still you try to enjoy the time spent on your own because you may never know what'll happen if he returns
>that you did, a new term has started and with that, more things to learn about new subjects
>you were able to breeze by thanks to Stolas' tips on studying
>another night alone as you stare at the ceiling about to fall asleep
>suddenly, your room turns red as a portal opens and Stolas stumbles in with a wine bottle in hand
>his red eyes hid their puffiness but you could tell he was crying recently
>you asked him what happened
>"I don't- *sniff* want to talk about it."
>with that, he joins you under the bed covers and snuggles with you
>his head rests under your chin which was awkward considering how tall he was
>give him an assuring rub on his head and he breathes a sigh of relief
>sobbing into snores and you feel like you wanna turn in the night as well
>don't know how to handle a demon owl guy suddenly clinging on you for emotional support

>wake up to being center of tangled limbs 
>Stolas usually leaves in the morning or before you wake up
>try to get up but his arms tighten around you
>you try to wake him up but that felt like a bad idea
>still Stolas was still sleeping but you could hear him whispering
>it was too quiet for you too understand but his words were peppered with grunts and moans
>a thin arm starts to reach down under the blankets and you feel it wrap around your morning wood
>WOAHNELLY.mp4
>your shout finally wakes the goetian demon and sits up in shock
>he takes a look around and realizes he fell asleep in your room
>"A-Anon I, well- I must apologize for my behavior last night."
>you weren't too perturbed by it but still this morning took a turn for the weird
>though he doesn't seem to notice what he just did and stands up.

>"I should return home. My little 'Tavi might get suspicious of my absence."
>he turns to you with his face with a tint of pink 
>"G-Goodbye Anon. Call me if you need anything!"
>a red portal opens up and he immediately zips into it and closes.
>you have several questions on what happened just now
>but you have to put those aside later as you have a busy day ahead
>classes pass by and you had some time in the dorm's cafeteria
>look at your phone at the time and a notification pops in
>you have a new unidentified number in your contacts
>out of curiosity, you dial it in and get picked up
>"Anon? Anon! Is that you?"
>Stolas' voice nearly pierced your eardrums and say it is
>"Oh thank Lucifer, I thought I put the wrong number in your phone. Anyway how are you? Do you need something from me."
>you ask him how he was able to put his number on your phone
>"Remember the contract dear? I do need a way of contact to folks who are indebted to me."
>right...
>"In any case, do you need something from me? Any more subjects you need help from? Ooh! Maybe Astronomy? I could help you with that."
>you politely decline and just say you were testing out the number
>the owl's tone deflates from that 
>"Oh, still if you need anything from me feel free to ask."
>Say  your goodbyes to him and close the call
>you rub your face as you try to comprehend what's happening
>first he barges into your room, cries into your shoulder, and gives you a handy in the morning
>then he puts his phone number on your contacts and is practically begging for you to do something that relates to him
>you don't know where to blur the line between being in debt to a demon and being a shoulder to cry on to an emotionally broken owl

>classes end and you head back to your dorm room
>find stolas on your bed sniffing about
>he sits up in surprise 
>"A-Anon! You're already back!"
>the owl runs up to you for an embrace
>get a mouthful of floofy bird feathers
>"Oh Anon! I had an awful day. First Blitzy refused to answer my calls, then my favorite soap opera was delayed for a day. A DAY!"
>and so Stolas talked your ear off for the rest of the night
>while still clinging on to you
>you had to figure out a way to keep him off you
>so you decided to introduce him to a medium you think hell never had
>anime
>open up your laptop and play one your favorite animes
>it was a classic saturday monday romcom about a guy and a girl and their wacky adventures
>stolas was basically hooked on the first episode
>thanks to the fact he has two pairs of eyes so he can watch the show and the subtitles
>he was glued to the screen which left you all alone with your phone for tonight
>hopefully nothing can go wrong

>Stolas would still visit you from time to time
>now he would demand to watch "animays" show with you
>apart from being forced into a cuddle position, it was actually nice to watch it with someone
>this time it was another romcom (apparently he likes those) but this time the main love interest was a trap
>at first he was confused on why the mc is freaking on about
>so you had to explain what a trap is
>"Oh, so it's a man dressing up like a woman, a crossdresser?"
"Something to that extent. Well, traps usually lean into the more cuter side for their appeal."
>"I see."
>he sat silent for a moment before speaking
>"...Do you think I'm cute Anonymous?"
>shit what do you say to that
>the owl sat there with an expectant look

>well the Stolas looks terrifying, at first glance
>but he had proven himself to be a good, yet clingy, companion
>the way he reacts to the world could also contribute to his cuteness
>he gravitates on parts of anime that are cute or comfy
"I think you act cute?"
>his eyes widened at your response
"I'm sorry if that sounded like a question. But the way I see it you sort of carry yourself like a-"
>don't say puppy don't say puppy
"-child"
>FUCK
>Stolas pursed his (beak?) before turning towards the show with a dejection
>"So you don't see me as an adult?"
"No! No. What I mean is, the way you react to stuff common here, like this show, or the courses I'm taking, and even the way you talk about yourself."
"I think it's endearing to see someone so happy about being himself."
>he perked up from what you said and turned away
>"D-Do you mean it? That it's cute for me to be myself?"
>from your point of view, you don't see the creeping, blushing grin on his face
"Sure, I guess."
>he rubs his shoulder before clearing his throat
>"I think I should leave for tonight Anonymous dear. Maybe we could catch up with show on a different night yes?"
>you were a bit surprised on his sudden urge to leave
"You're not staying?"
>he pauses for a minute before speaking
>"I'm afraid I important business to take care of"
>Stolas says his goodbyes and leaves 
>putting you all alone in a saturday night
>you rub the bridge of your nose and hope you didn't say something wrong

>Stolas laid down under the covers of the bed staring at the ceiling
>sleep continued to elude him after what you said
>he rubbed his face while trying to put down the growing heat on his cheeks
>"Stolas you old fool."
>it was one thing find someone react to his quirks and behaviors in a positive way
>but to find him cute? 
>his feathers ruffled at the mere thought

>Blitzo was already at the door and slammed it shut after their monthly ordeal
>Stolas felt cold again
>even after a hot shower, he still felt cold
>and alone
>he sighed and reminisced about his other business partner
>what are they to Anonymous
>even he knows there's a level of fear the human has for him
>but that's just part of being a demon
>still the human admitted he was 'cute' because of the way he acted
>acted
>that just means the way he looks is a turn off for the man
>his thousand-year old brain racked on what could make the human think otherwise
>then he remembered the animays he was shown 
>about the cute cross dresser who was trying to win over his object of affections
>that's it!
>maybe he needs to spice up his appearance and ditch this dirty little bathrobe
>but what to wear
>Stolas' eyes wandered over his wife's wardrobe
>he shuddered when he remembered what type of clothes she likes to wear when they made Octavia
>then he had another idea
>no no no, he is already on thin ice with his dear little starlight, he couldn't possibly be-

>the owl rummaged through his daughter's and pulled up an old uniform
>it was a miniskirt accompanied with a black dress shirt and star-patterned tie
>it was an old school uniform his daughter worn before she decided to change her fashion sense to be more-
>-braver? more subdued as it were
>in any case it should fit him
>demons don't grow fat no matter how much they consume food
>that's what Gluttony is for!
>he rushed towards his private closet and tried it on
>the skirt tight in his waist, and the shirt was too small for him and it was more like a crop top
>it didn't look bad, but it needed something more oomf
>so he decided to add the dark red g-string he bought for his sessions with Blitzy but it was never used 
>still... he was going to use it now!
>with his new attire complete he posed in front of the mirror
>he leaned forward to make the lacy fabric be stretched and exposed under his skirt
>yes, this could work

>be Anon
>another day filled with coding and ai ethics nonsense
>enter your dorm room expecting the owl waiting on you
>AWOOGA-
>barely stop yourself from screaming that word
>you shake your head to make sure what you're seeing is real
>Stolas was on all fours facing away from you wearing some sort of school girl outfit
>his 'panties' were stretched on its end as it became a border between two great moons
>suddenly, he turns his head towards you
>"Oh Anon, you're back."
>he walks towards you with open arms to greet you like an old friend
>but the same ritual of him giving you a hug hits different
>the shirt barely hides his thin stomach but that somehow makes it more risque
>is this what Grandpa Anon says when the Lord gives you the toughest battles?
>you awkwardly reciprocate the gesture 
"H-Hey man, what's with you? Feel like trying something new?"
>Stolas gives you a relived smile and twirls in place
>"You like it? I felt inspired by that romance animay we watched together! Tell me it suits me darling."
>you knew the owl was fruity but this is different
"I think it looks great on you."
>you fooled yourself into thinking either it was a lie or a genuine compliment
>he seemed to beam at you for that answer
>"Really? Oh Anon dear you are too kind."
>he waves his hand while looking away
>god fucking dammit he really does act cute
"So anyway, what are we gonna do for tonight?
>Stolas already beat you to the punch by opening your laptop and continued the last episode of 'My Childhood Sweetheart is a Guy'

>'Hey! I want to see what you're doing MC-kun.'
>you two were on the bed all up in each other's arms 
>it was Stolas' favorite position whenever he watches something with you
>though what was different was you were feeling down below
>you knew the owl wore nothing underneath when he was wearing his bathrobe
>so why was this different
>the erotic scene played out as the trap continued to grind his butt on top of the MC's lap
>and worst of all, Stolas was doing it to you
>unconsciously or not
>you give a mental prayer to the lord, whom you hope has not abandoned you for summoning a demon, to give you strength 
>you will not get a stiffy under this owl
>suddenly Stolas lets go of you and lied down in front of you, with his sinful derriere still on your crotch
>he propped his head with his arms and continued to watch the show with earnest appreciation 
>meanwhile, you were commanding all the blood in your body to not go to your dick right now
>his ass was like Medusa, one look and you're finished
>you were feeling lightheaded, either blood is rushing to far up to your brain or you're having a constipation

>the sound of the anime ending song fills your ears
>it was like a finish line that seemed to never come
>"Guess it is getting late."
>you yawn in response
"Guess it is. Maybe I should hit the hay."
>"Though you could stop feeling me up now dear Anonymous."
>what
>looked down and notice you have a handful of feathery butt on each palm
>when did this happen!?
>"I think it's around the time I lied down."
>why did you say that out loud?!
"I'd- you'd uh."
>the owl lets out a chuckle
>"It's fine dear Anon. I consider it a compliment."
>his face turns into worry 
>"Though the cause of concern right now is you. Are you feeling alright? Your face is red all over."
>yeah that figures
"I think it's because I tired myself out."
>you close your laptop and just lie down on the bed
>Stolas joins you and wraps his arms around your neck
>It was no different from any other night as you slept 
>but the owl was awake, smiling at the thought you touched him back

>it was like this for the rest of the month
>Stolas Goetia kept tempting you several times throughout
>he would push his back against you and rub his ass next your crotch
>pose himself in compromising positions whenever you wake up or return to your dorm
>his wardrobe would change from more risque attire like mini skirts and fishnet leggings
>you were pulling your hair over the fact you KNEW he was doing this since a part of you secretly enjoy it
>every time you asked about his recent escapades, he would either deny it or ask you if liked it
>'Oh dear Anonymous, I was just cleaning your bed y'know.'
>'How does this fit me Anonymous? Maybe I should cut back on some of the cheese and wine."
>it doesn't help the fact the owl's figure made you curious in more ways than one
>daydreams of slamming your dick in his fruity ass often derailed your thoughts
>still the owl's behavior wasn't like this before
>at least it wasn't this bad
>you think back on what he said about his life
>abusive wife, cheated on her with a childhood friend, yada yada yada
>wait
>is he considering you as a fling? or some sort of person to bounce back to?
>at first you were a bit offended, then flattered, then concerned
>this was unhealthy, you know that
>he did help you with the exam, so the least you could help him too
>and escaping from his problems to your dorm, to you, wasn't going to solve that
>he needs intervention
>at least, the equivalent to a owl demon
>tonight, you and him are gonna talk it out
>maybe it would be enough to give you some personal space for once

>curse him
>curse that brute
>that gentlemanly fiend!
>damn his heart, but Anonymous was starting to frustrate Stolas
>no matter how many times the owl hinted at his interest to him, he still pushed him back
>innuendos, risque clothes, vulnerable positions to be ravaged, all of it fell flat
>he knew for the fact he stared at him, looked at him, felt him, DESIRED him
>yet he still refused to take advantage of him because he cared about him and his needs
>Stolas looked at the upcoming full moon
>his white face was flushed at his desire to be fucked, to be loved
>Blitzy usually gave in to his fantasies and demands, but it felt like he didn't want to be a part of it
>there was still a sense of divide and contempt as soon as it was over
>childhood memories soon replaced by recent activities of his lone summoner
>the back of his mind kept suggesting that Anonymous would be the one who fill his heart once more
>but their was still a lingering fear in his heart that he would reject him
>his eyes lingered to a shopping bag near the foot of his bed
>a recent purchase from the Lust district
>of course he purchased it in the guise that it was for Stella, but it obviously he was going to use it
>tonight will be different
>make or break

>'Anonymous, I wish to talk, come back soon.'
>it was a short call and he hung up as soon as Stolas said those words.
>you swallow the lump in your throat and braced yourself as you approached your dorm room
>grabbing the knob, you open the door
>to see Stolas in his red bathrobe sitting on the bed looking solemn
>the owl turns his head towards you and nods
>"Anonymous, please have a seat."
>even though it was your room, you obeyed and sat next to him on the bed
>seconds pass as you two were silent while you waited on how to open your thoughts on him
"Stolas I-"
>"I've been meaning-"
>both of you stopped yourselves and Stolas cleared his throat
>"You first."
>you hesitated on what you were about to say but soldiered on
"Stolas, for the past couple of weeks, I've noticed you've been more 'eccentric' around me."
>carefully observing the owl's face for any emotions you continued
"And well, I've thought about what's been happening and I think you should stop, for the good of both of us."
>Stolas looked a little hurt from what you said but he nodded
"I know what you are doing, and I think it's unhealthy. Escaping from your life, your family isn't going to solve it. I'm not some new 'thing' you can latch on to just to make you look the other way and pretend it doesn't exist."
>he opened his beak to say something but shuts it when he couldn't find his words
"And I got to be honest, while I am flattered by the notion, I don't think it's gonna work in the long run.
>with your speech done, you gestured to him to say his part
>the demon took a deep breath
>"Anonymous, the past couple of weeks were one of the happiest of my life. But even I know for a fact that it wasn't going to last long. "
>"As you said, I have been using you as an escape for my life. You weren't the first I admit."
>he took a moment to breath first but you could see tears his in eyes
>"I've done nothing but run from my problems, and when I saw you caring for me, it was like a beacon that I couldn't help but follow."
>"I want to fix my mistakes I really do. But such an idea was lost when I was with you."
>"I wish to thank you Anonymous, for all the nights we've had together, and for putting my mind clear of what I must do."
>being thanked by royalty from hell, what an achivement
>Stolas wiped away his tears before he continued
>"I-I want to reward you Anonymous. At least before we separate."
>you were taken aback on what he just said
>a reward? you were curious but you felt like you need to tread lightly
> Stolas removed his robe and you were in shock
>he was wearing a obsidian black one-piece lingerie with heart patterns and a chest window to accentuate his fluff
>black stirrup stockings hugged his surprisingly thick legs
>while black elbow length gloves reached out and touched your legs
>"Anonymous darling~"
>the owl demon let out a low sensuous tone made your dick twitch in reflex
>holy genuine fuck

>Stolas started to crawl over you and overshadow your presence
>the room's atmosphere seemed to get dark and his eyes glowed like a beacon
>"Pop quiz Anonymous: What is the demon that uses sex and desire to claim men's souls?"
"Stolas wait-"
>A claw reaches your lips as the owl emits a tut
>"Ah ah ah, it's rude to answer a friend's question."
>his eyes dig into your soul
>your reminded on WHY he's a prince of hell right now
"S-Succubus?"
>he sits up and applauds your answer
>"Correct! And how do you think they do it?"
>you pause and think about it
"They... fuck them until the guy's empty?"
>two arms right next to your head and you jolt in place
>"WRONG!"
>you swallow the lump in your throat as he breathes down on you
>"It is a simple misconception of observation really."
>Stolas starts pulling himself back, dragging his claws over your body
>his fingers leave rips on your t-shirt and the sensation sends electricity down your spine
>"Succubi prey on men's desire and lust."
>he grips the hem of your pants and pulls them down
>"And since they are selfish and lazy creatures, they just let the men wore themselves out."
>with one swift movement, he pulls of the article of clothing and tosses it away
>"Even when the men are dehydrated, sleepless, and hungry, they never stop fucking."
>the owl's hands return and slides from your ankles to your thighs
>"All because they tasted a forbidden fruit."
>he takes a long agonizing lick on your growing chub, separated only by cotton fabric
>"One. Single. Taste."
>each word was emphasized with each lewd gesture
>all the while he never kept his eyes off you
>his tongue feels godly on your dick
>or demonic
"Stolas, this feels wrong. This is what we were just talking about!"
>he suddenly grips your briefs and rips it apart with one swipe
>your mast stands full attention and it grabs said said attention of the demonic owl above it
>you see his face falter for a moment
>"I know Anonymous. I should've just taken my medication."
>a claw wraps itself around your shaft and starts pumping it
>"And by medication, I mean a daily dose of dick prescribed by Anonymous M.D.~"
>his beak latches itself on to your tip and starts slobbering all over it
>you bite off a moan as you feel another set of claws caress your coin purse
>'Scream Anonymous.'
>your eyes widened as you hear his voice in your head
>'This room was enchanted to hold in any sound that is emitted inside it.'
>Stolas gives a loud wet smack on your dick leaving behind black lipstick.
>'So scream, moan, call out my name! LET IT ALL OUT!'
"AAAAAAAAHHHH!"
>you grip your sheets and thrust hard balls deep into the bird's throat
>load after load of pent up sexual frustration is deposited deep into owl's stomach
>but he takes it in stride as he moans at the sensation of your cock deep in his maw
>you're hips were holding up the owl's head for several seconds
>until it gave up and you landed on the bed with a thud alongside the owl
>you take agonizing deep breathes as you recovered from the mind-blowing head 
"F-uck ah... Stolas..."
>said demon was not moving from where he was
>but you can feel him continue to suckle on your softening dick
>post-orgasm sensitivity was starting to kick in and it was too much
>you tried to push his head away but his arms grab your wrists 
>Stolas pulls his face up and you see mascara running down on his tomato red cheeks
>alongside a demented gaze directed at you
>his beak grips your shaft hard and vacuum sucked all of the remaining cum until it lets go with a pop
>he licks some of the residue off his face
>"Human cum~ no wonder some demons get addicted to it."
>that's all he had to say before he started blowing you again
>you hiss as Stolas' tongue expertly worked your cock like it was used to it
>the owl continued to gorge himself with your length, letting out lewd noises all the way
>he pulls your arms and directs them on top of his head
>by instinct you grip his feathers and that seemed to encourage him to go faster
>he hollowed his cheeks as he seem to try suck more cum out straight from your balls
>your orgasm isn't further away as you throbbed at the back of his throat
"P-Please stop! I'm gonna cum again!"
>he suddenly pulls away, letting the cold air hit your twitching, leaking cock
>you're just one breath away from exploding again but his grip on your dick seems to stop you
>"Ooh we can't just waste your precious seed here~"
>he carefully gets on his knees and presents his crotch in front of you
>a snap of his claws and his panties open up to his cloaca
>"Not many beings in this world have gazed upon my sacred organ. Well, aside from Stella and Blitzy but the latter made me take a conventional set of genitals since it creeps him out."
>he opened the entrance to the slit with two claws and let his head peak out with dripping precum
>"But you'll be the first to enter it my handsome student~"
>your quiver in anticipation as he drags a gloved claw on your chin
>but one ounce of sanity still reaches you
"You c-can't do this. What about your family, your life?! You can't use me as a crutch for your problems!"
>he grab your head and brings it closer to his
>he whispers into your ear
>"But I'll love you regardless."
>the statement was sealed with a passionate kiss
>Stolas explored your mouth as he descended on to your shaft
>your tip opens his cloaca as both of you formed a symphony of moans in each other
>but that distracted you for a moment until he suddenly envelops himself over you in a single drop
>OH SHIT 
>HE GOT THAT GRIP
>this is a new level of homo sex no man has ever reached
>he pulls away from the kiss, a bridge of saliva connecting the two of you
>"N-Nonnykins~! Make me yours!"
>he resumes the make-out session as you fully hilt inside the demonic owl
>Stolas pulls up from your cock as he demon grasps your log like it was an alien lover
>he doesn't hesitate to wait on your tip before he forces you inside his slit again
>the heat from his body made you want to cum but the sheer tightness kept you from finishing
>this continued as he slammed, grind, and bounced on your hips like no tomorrow
>the demon would whisper into your ear sweet promises of his absolute loyalty and attention
>a pool of precum was forming between the two of you as the two of you frotted inside the owl
>you were starting to lose your mind from all the sensation and influence the demon wrought upon you
>primal instincts took over you and you gripped his plump bird ass and started thrusting back
>Stolas chirped as soon as your dick hit the floor of his guts
>"YES! THAT'S IT NONNYKINS~ FUCK ME! LOVE ME!"
>the gloves on his arms protected your back as he dragged his claws all over your skin
>both of you were delirious in each others arms as you continued to split his insides 
>you were already at your limit and you bucked one last time 
>white flooded the guts of Stolas as he whined at the sensation 
>his cock finally sprung up from his slit let out a few syrupy loads on your stomach

>Stolas was shivering in place as he continued to ride out your orgasm
>his eyes were rolled up while he gripped your body tightly
>you on the other hand, were thoroughly washed out
>the demon owl could easily fit the succubus schtick considering he utterly drained you dry
>minutes pass and Stolas sits up, groaning and a bit woozy as he gazed at you with half-lidded eyes
>"Mmmm~ Look at what you did to me you bad boy."
>he pulls away from your cock and spreads his slit wide, letting the liters of cum leak down on the bed
>above it, his dick was still pulsating from his previous orgasm
>"I've hadn't had this much fun since forever~"
>Stolas continued to slur his words before he passes out on top of you
>his chest smothers your face and it was oddly comfortable sensation
>you feel drowsy as you sunk into the soft sensation that was Stolas' fluffy feathers
>...
>you wake up the sensation of blinding light from your window
>sighing in frustration, you attempt to stand up but a clawed hand yanks you closer
>"Mmmmm... Nonny."
>your eyes bulged out from your sockets as Stolas' hands wrapped themselves around your chest and feel his chin on top of your head
>last night's events run through your mind and you did the one thing you need to do
>you screamed
>Stolas sat straight immediately, pulling the bed covers up to his chest and looked around in panic
>his feathers were a mess and he was still wearing the lingerie last night
>he actually looked cute when he's messy
>wait what are you saying?!
"Stolas! What the fuck!?"
>he flinched from your foul language
>"N-Now Anonymous, I know you're a bit mad-"
"Mad?! Of course I'm mad! I just said you shouldn't use me as an emotional crutch for your problems!"
>"I'm sorry! It was that time of the month and I felt lonely! Y-You were just there."
"Lonely? You were practically fucking the life out of me from how you acted last night!"
>"Again I'm sorry! I don't usually lead during sex but when I do I get too... 'passionate.'"
"Well if you used that energy to fix your issues rather than give me the best sex of my life, maybe we'll go somewhere!"
>"Please Anonymous, I know I can be a bit unbearable but I- wait what was that last part?"
>oh crap you said too much
"I-I said that if you just used that energy to-"
>"Give you. The best sex. Of your life?"
>the way he rolled the words right off his tongue just gives you more dread
>he gets on top of you and lets his elbows rest on the sides of your shoulders
>"Anonymous, my dear DEAR friend, have you enjoyed our coitus from last night?"
>Stolas looked down on you full judgement and coy
>your face heats up and that's all the answer he needed
>he smiles ear to ear before resting his head under your chin
>a sigh escapes his beak
>"I've already taken steps to improve myself Anonymous."
>he clutches your hand and you return the gesture
>"There are still problems along the way, Octavia's safety, my divorce, my... partnership with Blitzy."
>you heard a sniffle
>"They aren't simple problems that's just going to go away. They're complicated, with each step I take I feel like I'm going to fall into a pit."
>"But with you, you gave me solace. Just time for me to get away for a moment and relax."
>"I get to think for a moment without any weight on myself. And I enter my life again with a clear head and a new perspective."
>"To reiterate, I just wanted to say, thank you. For being there to listen."
>he stayed silent after that
>you decided to throw in your two cents
"...Each step counts right? I mean you are trying to improve, in your own way. So that counts. I guess it's kind of stressful being a family man.
>Stolas props himself up to face you with a smile.
>"Every step counts."
>you find yourself smiling back
>the two of you stared into each others eyes before you feel something stroking your cock
>you frown but he just continues to smile
>"Well I did say every step counts, and I need some 'thorough' rest before I seize the day~"
"Stolas I have classes to attend."
>he gestures the calendar and you notice it's the start of the weekend
>oh fuck
>the entire morning consisted of Stolas introducing to all kinds of kinks you never knew you had
>at one moment he was rubbing his thighs on your aching dick
>the next he was making you cum buckets with just a handjob as he peppers kisses all over your face and neck
>noon finally hit and it was that time Stolas decided to leave you in a sorry state
>"Ta ta Anonymous~ I'll be sure to put some 'us' time tomorrow. I'll even update you on what I've accomplished after I return!"
>the portal closes and you were finally alone
>a sore pelvis, black lipstick all over your body, and a question that persisted from this very day
>how did i get here
