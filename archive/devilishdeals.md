>in an effort to pass your college exams you decide to summon a demon
>howdidwegehere.wav
>end up summoning a demon that specializes in astronomy instead
>fuck
>instead of being a giant owl with a floating crown above its head it looks like an owl anthro wearing a bathrobe
>he also looks depressed with all his messy feathers
>he takes one look at you and just asks what do you want
>say you want knowledge to pass your math exam
>"Alright fine, but I need something in return as all contracts do."
>welp looks like you'll lose your soul in exchange for a diploma
>however, he asks something different
>"Could you just, hold me for tonight?"
>an odd request but alright
>he suddenly sits on your lap and wraps his arms around you and lays his head on yours
>it was an awkward position but you reciprocate the hug
>you two were stuck like this for a few minutes, with the owl sighing like as if a weight just lifted off of him
>eventually he lets off and produces reading glasses and a book
>"Alright then, lets see how you fare against algebra. Couldn't be that much different with my daughter"

>its been a few days after your exam
>still waiting for the results to be posted
>after your encounter with Stolas, the goetian demon of astronomy, you've had a new perspective in life
>as in demons are actually real and they might be more chill than you expected
>at least you think Stolas is an exception
>still to be alive after summoning a real demon makes you giddy inside
>you wonder what else this expansion of reality has to offer
>but you're getting ahead of yourself
>you turn in for the night and wait for the day of the exam results
>but you wake up to feel something tickling your back
>let out a manly scream and find Stolas on your bed wearing the same bathrobe but now untied to show off his fluffy chest
>he was surprised by your reaction but you had to ask why he was here
>"Haven't you forgotten? Contracts with demons are for life. So I'm cashing in the amount I'm owed."
>owed in what you ask
>"All I ask is to be held, is that so hard? You don't need to think hard about this since this is the most generous agreement I have to offer darling."
>he didn't need to ask for your permission and he embraced you again, this time your face on his chest
>the owl sighed once more and rubbed your back
>you didn't have any room to complain but the idea of serving a demon for life seems dangerous
>but the deal for now is to just hug him?
>sounds easy enough
>you embrace the demon as well while inhaling his scent
>it honestly feels like hugging a large fluffy pillow

>fast forward to exam results day
>log in to your college website and look at your course was
>you pass with flying colors
>to think you end up here with a help of a demon
>speaking of whom, Stolas kept visiting you every night from now on
>he started to open up to you
>by that you mean he starts dropping info about his personal life
>his abusive wife, his estranged daughter, that one assassin he sleeps with in order for him to kill humans on earth
>that last one was concerning 
>but it all ends with you and him cuddling within each other's arms
>tonight you tell him of the results of your exam
>for the first time, he smiles
>"Oh that is wonderful! Truly, celebrations are in order."
>his excitement was infectious and you decide to order pizza for the two of you tonight
>as you wait for the food to arrive he resumes his position with him by your side 
>but instead of sitting next to you, he sits on your lap
>howdidigethere.jpg
>he decides to tell stories about himself to pass the time
>you tried to listen, but he keeps adjusting his seat which rubs your crotch in all the right ways
>try not to sport a boner under a guy who could end you instantly
>the door bell rings and you immediately leave his soda to pick up the pizza
>the delivery guy couldn't help but notice your boner and chuckle at himself
>"you waiting on a lady sir?"
>just tell him to shut up but leave a tip since he at least arrived early enough before stolas to notice your erection
>place the pizza on the coffee table and you two dig in

>you continue to shoot the shit 
>divulge on your reasons on taking a college course
>tell him you want to become an programmer for AI
>explain what the barebones of it since you are talking about a demon here
>"So if I were to summarize it correctly, you desire to create a companion?"
>agree with him as one of those reasons
>in truth, you thought building giant robots as a kid and it snowballed from there
>withholding the fact AI can be dangerous if pushed to its limits
>suddenly, he changes the topic to somewhere else
>"Well I must congratulate you for passing your exams, but I must ask if there's any more you need of me?"
>you couldn't think much of anything and say to him you'll think of something later
>your response seems to pull the wool over his eyes and he went back to being mopey
>"I see... but I still have the right to continue our current agreement correct?"
>you were confused on why he was asking but you nodded
>that seem to make him comfort him but you could tell he was thinking about something
>eventually, you two share the bed once more 
>but you could feel he held closer this time, as if you were gonna disappear on him

>a week has passed since that night
>except Stolas hasn't had a nightly visit since
>you were a little worried about the demon but that in itself surprised you
>still you try to enjoy the time spent on your own because you may never know what'll happen if he returns
>that you did, a new term has started and with that, more things to learn about new subjects
>you were able to breeze by thanks to Stolas' tips on studying
>another night alone as you stare at the ceiling about to fall asleep
>suddenly, your room turns red as a portal opens and Stolas stumbles in with a wine bottle in hand
>his red eyes hid their puffiness but you could tell he was crying recently
>you asked him what happened
>"I don't- *sniff* want to talk about it."
>with that, he joins you under the bed covers and snuggles with you
>his head rests under your chin which was awkward considering how tall he was
>give him an assuring rub on his head and he breathes a sigh of relief
>sobbing into snores and you feel like you wanna turn in the night as well
>don't know how to handle a demon owl guy suddenly clinging on you for emotional support

>wake up to being center of tangled limbs 
>Stolas usually leaves in the morning or before you wake up
>try to get up but his arms tighten around you
>you try to wake him up but that felt like a bad idea
>still Stolas was still sleeping but you could hear him whispering
>it was too quiet for you too understand but his words were peppered with grunts and moans
>a thin arm starts to reach down under the blankets and you feel it wrap around your morning wood
>WOAHNELLY.mp4
>your shout finally wakes the goetian demon and sits up in shock
>he takes a look around and realizes he fell asleep in your room
>"A-Anon I, well- I must apologize for my behavior last night."
>you weren't too perturbed by it but still this morning took a turn for the weird
>though he doesn't seem to notice what he just did and stands up.

>"I should return home. My little 'Tavi might get suspicious of my absence."
>he turns to you with his face with a tint of pink 
>"G-Goodbye Anon. Call me if you need anything!"
>a red portal opens up and he immediately zips into it and closes.
>you have several questions on what happened just now
>but you have to put those aside later as you have a busy day ahead
>classes pass by and you had some time in the dorm's cafeteria
>look at your phone at the time and a notification pops in
>you have a new unidentified number in your contacts
>out of curiosity, you dial it in and get picked up
>"Anon? Anon! Is that you?"
>Stolas' voice nearly pierced your eardrums and say it is
>"Oh thank Lucifer, I thought I put the wrong number in your phone. Anyway how are you? Do you need something from me."
>you ask him how he was able to put his number on your phone
>"Remember the contract dear? I do need a way of contact to folks who are indebted to me."
>right...
>"In any case, do you need something from me? Any more subjects you need help from? Ooh! Maybe Astronomy? I could help you with that."
>you politely decline and just say you were testing out the number
>the owl's tone deflates from that 
>"Oh, still if you need anything from me feel free to ask."
>Say  your goodbyes to him and close the call
>you rub your face as you try to comprehend what's happening
>first he barges into your room, cries into your shoulder, and gives you a handy in the morning
>then he puts his phone number on your contacts and is practically begging for you to do something that relates to him
>you don't know where to blur the line between being in debt to a demon and being a shoulder to cry on to an emotionally broken owl

>classes end and you head back to your dorm room
>find stolas on your bed sniffing about
>he sits up in surprise 
>"A-Anon! You're already back!"
>the owl runs up to you for an embrace
>get a mouthful of floofy bird feathers
>"Oh Anon! I had an awful day. First Blitzy refused to answer my calls, then my favorite soap opera was delayed for a day. A DAY!"
>and so Stolas talked your ear off for the rest of the night
>while still clinging on to you
>you had to figure out a way to keep him off you
>so you decided to introduce him to a medium you think hell never had
>anime
>open up your laptop and play one your favorite animes
>it was a classic saturday monday romcom about a guy and a girl and their wacky adventures
>stolas was basically hooked on the first episode
>thanks to the fact he has two pairs of eyes so he can watch the show and the subtitles
>he was glued to the screen which left you all alone with your phone for tonight
>hopefully nothing can go wrong

>Stolas would still visit you from time to time
>now he would demand to watch "animays" show with you
>apart from being forced into a cuddle position, it was actually nice to watch it with someone
>this time it was another romcom (apparently he likes those) but this time the main love interest was a trap
>at first he was confused on why the mc is freaking on about
>so you had to explain what a trap is
>"Oh, so it's a man dressing up like a woman, a crossdresser?"
"Something to that extent. Well, traps usually lean into the more cuter side for their appeal."
>"I see."
>he sat silent for a moment before speaking
>"...Do you think I'm cute Anonymous?"
>shit what do you say to that
>the owl sat there with an expectant look

>well the Stolas looks terrifying, at first glance
>but he had proven himself to be a good, yet clingy, companion
>the way he reacts to the world could also contribute to his cuteness
>he gravitates on parts of anime that are cute or comfy
"I think you act cute?"
>his eyes widened at your response
"I'm sorry if that sounded like a question. But the way I see it you sort of carry yourself like a-"
>don't say puppy don't say puppy
"-child"
>FUCK
>Stolas pursed his (beak?) before turning towards the show with a dejection
>"So you don't see me as an adult?"
"No! No. What I mean is, the way you react to stuff common here, like this show, or the courses I'm taking, and even the way you talk about yourself."
"I think it's endearing to see someone so happy about being himself."
>he perked up from what you said and turned away
>"D-Do you mean it? That it's cute for me to be myself?"
>from your point of view, you don't see the creeping, blushing grin on his face
"Sure, I guess."
>he rubs his shoulder before clearing his throat
>"I think I should leave for tonight Anonymous dear. Maybe we could catch up with show on a different night yes?"
>you were a bit surprised on his sudden urge to leave
"You're not staying?"
>he pauses for a minute before speaking
>"I'm afraid I important business to take care of"
>Stolas says his goodbyes and leaves 
>putting you all alone in a saturday night
>you rub the bridge of your nose and hope you didn't say something wrong

>Stolas laid down under the covers of the bed staring at the ceiling
>sleep continued to elude him after what you said
>he rubbed his face while trying to put down the growing heat on his cheeks
>"Stolas you old fool."
>it was one thing find someone react to his quirks and behaviors in a positive way
>but to find him cute? 
>his feathers ruffled at the mere thought
