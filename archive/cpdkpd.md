#Crayon Eater CYOA

!!! info Hello? Hello? Ah, yes. Zetta, are you recording this? Don't roll your... your whatever, at me. Make sure you capture every moment! I want this to be utterly sublime. Well, as sublime as an informational could be. Ahem. Let's restart. Greetings, I am your Captain, Gabriel Marcellus Alexopoulos. You might be thinking, that's quite a mouthful. Yes. It is! Call me Admiral Solomon for short! And you may be asking, Admiral of how many ships? I'm WORKING on that. No more stupid questions, moving on. Ahem-hem. Welcome aboard the Ars Goetia!

>Origin: 
Society of Dustkeepers
!!! info Dustkeepers, Dusties, my dear dusted fellows. You might be wondering how I've rounded up such a... motley crew of Dustkeepers, as famous as we are for our, er, individualist proclivities. That is because I know what they want, being one myself! Duly, I provide... ample opportunity for exploration and income. No corner of the galaxy left unturned, no expedition too dangerous. Faraday's good, excluding the whole mutant part, but there's more to the stars than just an abandoned old facility. That's why they're here. The people have demands, and I supply. Though we all have our differences, we're just one big happy family! Zetta, did you catch that? Family. Just like you and I!


>Skills 8M
Medical, Computer Science, Mechanics, Nuclear, Mercantile, Industry, Diplomacy, Standard/Advanced Combat Training, Basic Piloting 
!!! info You pick up a few things in the trade, I suppose. Years of trading, study, and diplomatic relations will sharpen your wit quite a bit. Oh, Zetta, you flatter me. I am quite a genius. Oh, stop it, I'm extremely charismatic and handsome under the mask too? You aren't so bad yourself, either! 
A Gazer walks by, typing something into a holographic tablet. She looks at Gabriel, shakes her head and walks away.
!!! info Don't judge me, Cynthia. It gets a little lonely being the smartest one in the ship! The nerve.


>Titles: 
"The Hell Raiser" +  "The Fatebreaker"
!!! info You may have heard, but I have quite a few enemies! Countless bandit groups, rogue AIs, you name it, are after my head AND my ship. I may have... meddled in a few affairs, yes. But, you know, making an omelette, and all that. Sorta have to crack a few junglefowl eggs. Yes, yes, I am aware that what I did do that Syndicate Fleet near Erebus was uncalled for--but it was self defense. What was I supposed to do? They looked threatening. Sure, an important one-in-a-lifetime anti-matter deposit forming due to cosmic radioactive decay just HAPPENED to be there, but that's... uh, not relevant. And about the AI? No clue. They just don't like me, I think. Nod if you agree, Zetta. 


>Ship Hulls:  
Dhyana
!!! info Herald artifacts go for quite a bit, you know. I called in quite a few favors for this one, didn't I, Zetta? A few underhanded business deals... a bit of investment, and connections. And well, would you look at that? A brand new ship. What can I say? I'm quite profitable. Even with the bounty on my head, they're still willing to do business with me! Well... not publicly. 

>Ship AI: 
Cedrick
!!! info Oh, Cedrick. Cedrick, Cedrick, Cedrick. Ceddy. Rick. You used to be so kind and obedient. What happened to you? So rebellious now. Don't you know it's not nice to talk back to your parents? Teenagers, am I right Zetta? Anyways, our AI here is quite something! Anti-matter energy cores can only output so much power, we need a bit of efficiency so we don't burn out like a candle made of gasoline, especially on a gargantuan ship like this! Sometimes we get those pesky bombardments from bandit fleets, no issue to us! We'll wait them out, and cull them all like the mongrels they are! Cedrick here is perfect for that. Well, whenever he's not being a bratty teenager. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CEDRICK?
A wire unhooks itself, zapping Gabriel. He convulses for a second before collapsing onto a knee.
!!! info Ow. Ow. Sorry. Okay. Sorry. Fine!

!!! info We have tens of hundreds of men running diagnostics, calculating parameters, doing status checks on our mainframes, weapons and vehicles. Constant maintenance, cycled throughout the entire day. With some of my most skilled officers piloting our vehicles and operating incredibly advanced equipment, it all comes together! I mean, come on. Anti matter guns that can vaporise entire BATTLESHIPS. More guns than you have appendages on that filthy meat flesh prison you suckers call a BODY. State of the art? HA! I AM THE FUCKING STATE!

!!! info I like to keep my crew happy. In fact, it's my duty. If I don't take care of my crew, then there is no reason why I am captain. That being said, we have everything we could ever need. And I mean it. Everything. Becoming a crewmate here is as good as being a fat politician allied with lobbyists in a Federation system. We even have mini fridges in all the rooms. Thirsty?
He opens up a fridge, taking out an aluminum-copper alloy can.

!!! info Now, for the camera man, Zetta? Tell 'em, Zetta. What about you?
Silence.
!!! info He's camera shy. Anyways, I found him on an abandoned facility in one of the No Mans Lands sectors, it was filled to the brim with experimental technology and Herald artifacts. Boy, did they sell for a ton. I gave a few of the systems a reboot, and boy, was that a mistake. Let's just say, if we didn't get the hell off that planet--we were about to maimed to death by angry drones. Woopsies. Glad to say I had my officers with me though. You might be thinking to yourself, can you really trust Gazers? To that I say... fair enough! But I trust these guys. We started around with around, what, 10 Gazers at first? But you know them, connections and whatnot. Built up around 50 strong. And we've already went over my Dustkeeper comrades. Anyhow, welcome aboard the Ars Goetia, glad to have you here!
The video stops and Zetta puts down the recorder device.
!!! info Well? Was it good?
!!! danger No.
They stop and stare at each other, completely silent.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

An eccentric man, even by weirdo standards, Gabriel is a calculating pragmatist at his core despite his... seemingly whimsical demeanor. Extremely competent and eager to do business in ventures he deems to be profitable and high quality, he is a powerful ally to have on your side--even temporarily. However despite this eagerness, he is quite the polarising figure. His eccentrics are... annoying at best, but what's worse is how much trouble he may cause for all parties involved with him due to his mercurial nature. He might blow up a fleet or two, on accident of course. He puts his crew above all else, but he spares no expense for his allies and treats them very well for as long as he remains allied with them.
