So you want to play Assetto Corsa in VR?

#####What to Buy:
You'll just need the base game and the Japanese Pack DLC if you want to race with /vrg/.
For general online play, you'll probably just want to buy the Ultimate Edition since a lot of servers use DLC.
Don't pay full price if you can avoid it, this game goes on sale all the time.

#####General setup:
At the bare minimum, make sure to set your rendering mode to OpenVR or Oculus in the video settings and disable Crepuscular rays.
Race department has a list of recommended tweaks you can look at as well, but a lot of these come down to personal taste.

#####If you want a physical wheel:
T150/TMX is usually the cheapest decent option.

#####If you want to use your VR controllers as a wheel:
A few regulars use this and really like it.
Ask in the thread if you're having setup issues, hopefully one of them can update this with their sample config.

#####Extra tweaks:
Content manager is a much better launcher than the default one for everything other than wheel setup, and the Lite version is fine.

You can install the shader patch through it under Settings>Custom Shader Patch, which improves lighting.
The Sol mod allows for improved weather, which lets you race at night and more.
