#Cracks in a Mirror

Two Shiketsu first years sat inside the library. Both were a rare sight here, in this sacred temple of learning. For one there was nothing to lift or fight. For the other, there was little to hold his interest. But exams were coming and while the uninterested student felt sufficiently prepared, the fighter had asked for help.

Kaylee looked up from her math textbook, thoroughly exhausted. She wasn’t built for this. For a moment she watched Christopher. Christopher was working ferociously at a complex diagram using a stack of loose leaf paper. Beside him was a very thin book held open by a paper clip. 

Christopher had been ecstatic to find that thin book at a used book store on the way to school. It was apparently some obscure dissertation that could cost hundreds of us dollars to buy online, but he’d gotten it for 1000¥. Kaylee didn’t know what it was about, her eyes had glazed over before he finished reading the title. All she retained from Christopher’s explanation was that the dissertation, On the Motion of Spheres on an Inclined Plane When Acted Upon by Outside Forces wasn’t going to be on any of their tests.

Kaylee returned her attention to her math textbook. It was basic trigonometry but Kaylee was having trouble keeping all the functions straight. She was still trying to memorize sine, cosine and tangent and she was having trouble keeping which function was which straight. At this rate she wasn’t going to get to the class’s actually difficult material… not without help.

“Chris… can you explain the functions?” Kaylee asked. 

Without looking up, Christopher pointed at an example problem using his pencil. He explained in English.

{“SOH-CAH-TOA. Sine is Opposite/ Hypotenuse, Cosine is Adjacent/ Hypotenuse, and Tangent is Opposite/ Adjacent.”} 

Kaylee appreciated Christopher teaching her math in their native language. Memorizing this was hard enough without having to do it in her second language. But his explanation just brought up another question for her. One she felt stupid for asking. The way Christopher treated the word it was like everyone should know it… but he obviously didn’t appreciate her rather specialized approach to education.

{“What’s the Hypotenuse?”}

{“The side of the triangle opposite the right angle.”} Christopher pointed to the hypotenuse on the example presented without changing tone.

{“Thanks.”} Kaylee said and she meant it.

{“No problem.”} Christopher kept his head down. He was avoiding looking up from that pile of loose-leaf paper, that was… odd. Whenever they’d played chess, worked out or studied it was like he’d make an effort to look her in the eye as he spoke. Not lately though. 

Not that a lack of eye contact bothered Kaylee, but when added to the fact he’d gone back to ignoring everyone he wasn’t friends with… it was concerning. Especially when he walked straight past Nene with her fanny up leaning on the table, talking to some 2nd years in the cafeteria like he hadn’t seen her. It was like he was going back to how he used to be, back at the start of the year. Just… closed off.

{“You okay?”} Kaylee finally asked. 

Christopher shook his head.

Kaylee frowned, {“Do you want to ta--”}

{“No.”}

{“It have anything to do with Yui?”}

Christopher shot her a sharp glare.

Kaylee tilted her head. {“You haven’t been getting plushies recently.”}

Christopher mumbled his answer. {“She was an ass last time she walked me home…. Then I was an ass right back and now we’ve stopped talking. Can we leave it at that?”}

{“Both of you? What’d you do? Confess?”}

Christopher coughed and sputtered at that. Kaylee restrained a smile. That got his attention.

“I don’t even--” He stammered, unintentionally switching to Japanese.

Kaylee smiled broadly as his eyes met her’s. 

Christopher’s eyes narrowed. 

She was kidding.

“You’re hilarious.”

“At least I finally got your attention.” Kaylee nodded at Christopher’s pile of notes. “Those notes relevant to you being an ass?”

“No. It’s something really stupid. So, Yui was somehow able to get a pinball to change trajectory slightly, avoiding the deadball trap. The most likely explanation is she somehow changed the table’s incline without triggering the tilt. But… it could also be the table received a spontaneous force a little under 10psi perpendicular with its right legs. But I was watching her hands, she didn’t use her quirk and I can’t figure out what else she could’ve done!”

Kaylee laughed. He couldn’t be this obtuse! “You’re joking right?”

Christopher was taken aback by her tone. “No… why?”

Kaylee stood.

“Kaylee?”

Kaylee held up a finger asking for silence. Then walked over to an adjacent table. Held out a pencil, placed it at the center of the table. Then, she gently, with human strength, kicked the table. The table shuddered and the pencil moved slightly.

Christopher’s face fell.

Kaylee restrained her laughter.

Christopher crumbled up the looseleaf paper, filled with complex, worthless, formulas. He hit his head against the table. 

“I’m a moron.” He groaned.

“Dumbest smart person I’ve ever met.” Kaylee agreed as she returned her place across the table from Christopher.

Christopher kept his head on the table, not stirring. 

Kaylee frowned. He didn’t want to talk about whatever happened between him and Yui, so she should drop it here right? Both Christopher and Yui were friends to Kaylee but their relationship shouldn’t be any of her business. Shouldn’t she just leave well enough alone and not mettle?

“Neither of you have apologized?” Guess not.

Christopher looked up at Kaylee and rested his chin on the table.

“That’s the thing isn’t it? I… overreacted to something Yui said, but what she said was stupid and offensive. I should’ve reacted milder, but it deserved a reaction. So who apologizes first? The offender or the overreactor? Is there an order of operations here?”

“You’re overthinking. You want to apologize, apologize. Or don’t and stop moping.”

Christopher frowned, but said nothing.

Kaylee sighed and finally closed her neglected math book. He was asking the wrong questions and that was obvious enough even SHE could see it. “Listen Chris, if there’s anything I’ve learned from my war with the bitches--”

“War?”

“Yes, war. It’s that social interaction is really just a boring fight.”

Christopher raised an eyebrow at her choice of adjective, but continued listening. 

“I figure a fight happens in 3 stages. Stage 1 is Visualization. This includes deciding whether to fight. You’re here with Yui. But, Stage 1 also includes planning the engagement. Choose your ground and tactics. Ambush? In the open field? It’s all fair game at this point. What maximizes your odds of victory?” Her voice was getting heavy as she described the process of a fight. Christopher was torn between listening and slinking away.

“Stage 2 is Actualization. THIS is the moment that your visualization gives way to the reality of battle. Fists—or words-- collide in a contest of wills and any preparations you made during stage 1 are put to the ultimate test.” Christopher checked his exits. She had to give up training for studying today. She was going to be looking for a release valve for all her pent up aggression and soon. Christopher would rather that valve not be him.

“Stage 3.” Kaylee consciously controlled her breathing. She fought back the urge to go train immediately. “Is Revelation. The winner’s decided. And all that’s left is to figure out what you’ve learned from your victory or defeat. What the result says about your skills as a warrior and what your shortcomings are.”

Christopher raised an eyebrow, chin still firmly on the table. “There a point you’re trying to make in all of this?”

Kaylee put a hand over her chest. Her blood was really boiling now that she’d described a battle in such detail. Maybe she’d go find someone to spar with.

“Yeah.” She managed. “Point is, there’s an opponent you face at every stage no matter who your enemy is. That opponent is always with you and must be constantly defeated. Want to guess who that is?”

“Yourself.” Christopher answered, putting it together.

Kaylee nodded. Her blood cooled. 

“Yup, you get it! Your uncertainties, arrogance and complacency. You have to beat yourself every step of the battle, or you’ll lose.”

Christopher looked a little miffed, as if he was struggling to apply her hard won wisdom to his own situation. 

“What I’m saying is. You’re wallowing in uncertainty by thinking of who should apologize. Instead, you should be thinking about how you would.”

“You couldn’t just say that?”

“… are you seriously asking me to not talk about fighting?”

Christopher shrugged at that. “Point.” 

Silence. Christopher stared at the wall behind Kaylee as if it held the secrets to moving forward. Kaylee debated reopening her textbook. The conversation hadn’t taken as long as she hoped it would.

“Kaylee?” Christopher said.

“Yeah?”

“You're one of the best friends I've ever had.”

Kaylee found herself smiling as she cracked open her math book again. “Same.”

OO has left the chat.

IniGOAT: Okay, we may not have to worry about making love bloom anymore. If Chris’s still alive tomorrow we’ll talk again.
ImaSoujyuuro: What did I say?
IniGOAT: Just, never tell her what Chris says about school work.
IniGOAT: Or that he’s helping you study.
IniGOAT: Actually just avoid Chris as a subject with Hoge. This was my bad.
ImaSoujyuuro: Noted. ttyl
IniGOAT: WAIT, what’d you mean by this?
ImaSoujyuuro: By what? ttyl?
IniGOAT: NO
IniGOAT:
Replying to: maybe we sh…
THAT
ImaSoujyuuro: Well aren’t they best friends? If he told anyone what happened it was probably her.
IniGOAT: First of all, I’m his best friend. Second of all… I’ll add her.
ImaSoujyuuro: Doesn’t she hate you? Why would she join?

OverwhelmingForce has entered the chat.

ImaSoujyuuro: I stand corrected.
OverwhelmingForce: who we fighting
ImaSoujyuuro: @OverwhelmingForce Hi Kaylee.
IniGOAT: THE FORCES OF CELIBACY! CHRISTOPHER AND YUI HAVE BEEN ON THE OUTS AND WE MUST RETURN THEM TO THE GOOD END’S PATH!
OverwhelmingForce: @ImaSoujyuuro hi
OverwhelmingForce: @IniGOAT this chat is named council of war
ImaSoujyuuro: uh oh
IniGOAT: Love is War.
ImaSoujyuuro: … ttyl

ImaSoujyuuro has left the chat

IniGOAT: @ImaSoujyuuro ?
OverwhelmingForce: Inigo, I came here thinking I was gonna get a fight. I haven’t fought anyone since you threw that fucking bear. It’s been THAT long. Then you send me this LINE with a tease of a chatroom name? Someone’s gonna fight me. And it looks like you’re the only one left.
IniGOAT: …

OverwhelmingForce started a group call

LookingGlass: Why?
OO: Imai said you told him you’re finished studying for our exams.
LookingGlass: 
Replying to: Imai said…
I am.
OO: Now I know that can’t be true because I haven’t satisfied myself with complete mastery over a quarter of the course material. And any claims, on your part, to already be done has to be a lie to get a rise out of me.
LookingGlass: 
Replying to: Now I know…
What’re you having trouble with?
