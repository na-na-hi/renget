#Baggy & The Beast: A Trash Bag Side Story

I stared back at the disgruntled teddy bear-looking chef, he looked like he was bored out of his mind and really didn't want to be here, Maddi thought it'd be nice if we went to a cafe that she highly recommended. Unfortunately, Maddi was out sick so she couldn't come for dinner. To be honest, me and Beast never really interacted much... the times we did interact weren't exactly the most positive of interactions, The kitchen was the only room I wasn't allowed to clean in, Beast was extremely protective of his kitchen, my guess is because he was some kind of a germaphobe and my presence would've made things worse. The mood in the air was getting awkward, I knew I had to say something.

"So... how was your day?" I asked Beast, trying to initiate some kind of conversation with him.

"The same it always was... middling at best..." he replied

...

I tried asking another question, I asked him something a bit more personal

M: "So... how's th-the Numel guy??"

B: "You mean Ronald?"

M: "Yeah, him!"

B: "Well, he is still a migraine-inducing moron, I swear interacting with him is like interacting with a brick wall!"

M: "Tell me about it, One time in my third-grade science class I got paired up with this one chick, she was a serious airhead, she would just talk and talk, and I just wanted to get gym over with just I would never hear that dumbass' voice for the rest of the day."

B: "Hmm... You know, you are starting to sound like him..."

The tension of the scene began to rise

M: "Oh, In what way?"

B: "You seem to blather on about some pointless things."

M: "Pointless? I'm just talking about a story from my childhood! If you're trying not to be a smug asshole then maybe you should tell a similar story from your own childho-"

Just then, I was cut off by a cutesy, perky voice...

"Excuse meeeeee! Are ya guys ready to order?~"

It was the Waitress, who was a Tinkaton in 1950s waitress getup and rollerblades.

B: Um... yes, yes we are."

W: "Kay' then, what'll y'all be havin'?"

B: "I will have the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich with a side of Homestyle Chicken Noodle Soup and a Chocolate Milkshake!"

W: "Kay' and for you Trashman?"

M: "Just get me some damn iced coffee... and some Chicken Noodle Soup to go please."

W: "Not hungry? That's fine with me. I'll be back with your drinks in a sec!~"

Things were getting awkward again... We both didn't want to make a scene at a place like this. Then it was Beast's to ask me a personal question.

B: "Why on earth did you become a janitor in the first place? It seems a little surreal for someone of your kind to take a position such as that."

M: "What do you mean "Your kind?'"... nevermind, it was Maddi's idea, I said that if I was gonna take the job with me, so here we are..."

B: "Interesting... so... are you and Madeline-"

M: "What? No, we're just good friends who are living under the same roof. Why would you even think that?"

B: "I was not asking about your relationship, idiot, I was asking if you were going to the guild retreat this winter."

M: "Oh... the retreat... wait what retreat?"

B: "The entire guild is apparently taking a vacation to a winter resort up in the mountains."

M: "Oh, yeah, I'll think about it..."

...

Yipee, more awkward silence... that is until the waitress came back with our drinks

W: "Here are ya driiiinks!~"

B: "Thank you, Madam!"

W: "D'aaw thanks, sweetie!~"

The waitress rolled away to get Beast's order, I took a big sip from my coffee and said...

M: "So... what was the most interesting thing that happened to you today?"

B: "Hmm... I suppose it would be when I witnessed someone grope a Kirlia in order to know what touching a "cunny" feel like.

M: "Yeah, I know that feeling, Maddi was asking about that word several days ago, I just simply told her to ignore them.

B: "I swear, this place is filled to the brim with degenerates, I practically see something bizarre and unsavory every day."

M: "That's the 4chan for ya, wild and uncontrollable."

I took another long-ass sip from my coffee, Beast took a huge sigh and sipped his milkshake.

M: "You know, I never expected you to be the sort of person who still enjoys milkshakes"

B: "Huh, is that so?"

M: "Yeah, I mean, you're basically an old man."

B: "Well, it is nice to enjoy something a little sweet once in a while, you know?"

...

Then, would I only describe it as "Me being stupid", this happened...

M: "Hey, this song, it's from Sea Is A Lady isn't it?"

B: "Come again?"

M: "It's an album by Toshiki Kodamatsu, one of the founders of City Pop, one of my personal favorites!"

B: "I did not understand the words coming out of your mouth."

M: "Oh right you're probably the kind of person who unironically listens to opera or whatever."

B: "Who gave you the right to judge my taste in music?"

M: "Hey man, who said I was judging you!? At least I don't look like I'm actively hating my job..."

B: "Well, at least I do not make people wince whenever I enter any given room!"

M: "At least don't constantly belittle my co-worker all the damn time!"

B: "Well, at least I did not lie to some random person about being an explorer because my partner has anxiety issues!"

M: "YOU SAW THAT!?"

Just then, we noticed that everyone was looking at us even the waitress who had Beast's food, we were standing on the table and about ready to kill each other, but, seeing that we were making a scene, slowly sat back down in other seats, The waitress gave Beast his food and we said nothing for the rest of the meal. Afterward, I walked back with Beast to my house...

M: Hey... sorry about that outburst, guess I just couldn't hold it back anymore.

Beast says nothing

M: Hey come on, dude, say something...

B: You want me to say something? I have never felt more embarrassed than I already am right now, I lost my entire life's work in a flash and am in a situation that is driving me insane, and you're part of it!

M: Geez, I had no idea... listen, I said some stupid shit just now, people say stupid shit all the time, and they get into fights over said stupid shit, it's human nature, I didn't know about your current situation and I seriously regret saying those things, can't you at least take pity on me?

B: Hmmm... I suppose I could give you a pass for not knowing... but one more outburst like that and you are dead to me.

M: Sweet... so does this mean I can clean your kitchen?

B: NO IT DOES NOT!

M: Aw man...

So we ended up understanding each other a bit more, we stopped to get medicine for Maddi, and the moment we got home we parted ways, but before I did, I shouted to him how I enjoyed his cooking and he was free to come over at any time, the moment I stepped into my abode, I noticed that Maddi was already asleep, I was getting tired too, Probably because of everything that happened, so we decided to sleep together on the couch that night. I needed that so much...
