Illuminating the way
A Clover Guild Story
By Mareep-anon

Scattered across a rather short desk were maps in various states ranging from neatly rolled up to crumpled and wrinkled. Each and every map displayed some region of the Grass Continent in varying qualities, one in particular laid out on top of the rest showing the northern parts of the continent.

"Here. It has to be here."

There had been rumors of an abandoned location in the northern regions. Between hearsay, legend and old maps of the continent someone was determined to find it.

That someone was a Mareep.

Much like others that have recently found themselves in the 'Wonderful world' of Pokemon, the Mareep was a human in literal sheep's clothing with all the downsides being a quadruped. He brought his forelegs up on the table and tapped a specific spot on the toppost map, as if marking it. "Lets hope that the rumors are at least partially true." Grabbing the map as best he could the Mareep rolled it up using his face and forelegs. "I miss having hands.." he grumbled out loud. With his task complete he shoved it into his side satchel and began the long process of cleaning up the room.

The Mareep approached the Guildmaster, his task complete. "Lliam. I found it. It is about a two day travel from Capim town. I suggest sending a team because of the Mystery Dungeons along the way. I personally volunteer to go to better map the area out. I will leave the planning to you." He pulled out the map and gave it to the Meowstic.

"Thank you Macom. This is a lot of help! I'll get a crew together." The Meowstic was energetic as always, which didn't bother the reserved Mareep too much. All there was left to do for the Mareep was to prepare for the journey. With a 'bow' of his head, the sheep turned around and departed.

-- A day later --

Crystal Cave

According to recent explorers a path through the cavern had opened up that no longer leads to the crossing. This new passage however was extremely dark. So dark that other light sources are required to even see. In one of the pathways through there was a singular source of light: A glowing orb upon the tail of Macom, the Mareep. He was on a team with two others as they traversed through the cave and Mystery dungeons being as they were could never be mapped properly but the shining ball was their guide in the darkness. The dungeon was known for its dangerous rock and ground type Pokemon which would properly knock the Mareep out if given a chance.

The two other Pokemon kept their source of light safe as they trekked closer and closer through the dizzying maze of the dungeon, hostile Pokemon surrounded them and even in the light of the Mareep they were hard to see. As the shadowy figures loomed down upon the group the light suddenly got brighter, Macom quickly charging electrical energy within his wool. His two partners knew what that meant and they quickly ducked for cover as the room got so bright it was blinding! Electricity lances through the air as the built up energy is suddenly discharged right into the swarm of Pokemon surrounding the trio.

When the light faded, only a few Gravelers remained and were quickly dispatched by Macom's companions, a few of the crystals reflecting more of the light that remained from the electrical discharge. With the Monster House cleared and safe all that was remaining was a set of stairs leading to a bright tunnel, They had found the exit! As the trio left the crystal caves Macom finally spoke up since first entering the dungeon. "Maybe.. just maybe this wool is good for something." With a heavy sigh he lowered down to grab the map and peered around. "I believe our destination is on the other side of that forest to the East. We should rest here and prepare for the rest of the trek."
