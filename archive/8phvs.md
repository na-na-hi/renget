#Togetic's Mind-Bending Adventure
->By Togetic Anon<-


"Remind me, partner. What's the info on our target?" Asked Sneasel.

"A powerful psychic-type outlaw has been messing with exploration teams and robbing them," responds Booker from Sneasel's belt pocket. "We don't know what pokemon it is, rumors say it's been wiping the memories of the teams it's attacked."

"... A-And it's a-also rumored t-to be h-hiding out in this c-cave... H-Here." I stutter out, while looking over our map.

"You sure this is it, Toge?" Said Elm, floating closer to the cave entrance in front of us. I look up from my map, and examine our surroundings. We're only a few hours to the east of Capim town, and a tall, rocky hill towers above us. A jagged cave entrance pierces the side of the hill, and as I peer deeper I can see that the cave's sloped path descends underground. "You said this wasn't a dungeon, right?"

I nod. "R-Right, it sh-should just be a normal c-cave... S-So we should only h-have to worry about the outlaw..."

Elm twirls the Switcher Wand he's holding in his hand. "And it's just a lone outlaw?"

"According to the rumors, yes. But we should be prepared if they do have some kind of backup." Answered Booker, staring into the cave. "Hey, it looks like there are light sources in there!" 

I float closer to the entrance, and see that the cave's walls are lined with outcrops of white, shiny crystals that shoot out bright beams of light, as if they were searchlights. Sneasel walks by me and starts entering the cave. "Well, let's get going! " She beckons for us to follow as she heads deeper in. Elm and I look at each other and nod, then follow Sneasel and Booker. 

Despite the beams of light, the cave is still pretty dim. It also doesn't help that when one of the rays of light hits my eyes, I get blinded for a second, and my eyes struggle to adjust back to the darkness, making the cave seem even darker than it is. Sneasel tries to keep the light out of her eyes by covering them with one of her claws, only the cause light to reflect off of it and shoot a ray of light onto the cave wall. "Hey, Booker, look at this!" She twists her claw around, making the reflected light move across the wall. "Heh, this place is kinda cool. I can see why someone would make a hideout here."

Booker's eyes follow Sneasel's ray of light. "It is pretty neat, but we should stay focused. The outlaw could be waiting to ambush us."

"Hey, this isn't a high-level dungeon. There's no way some chump outlaw is gonna beat all of us." Sneasel says as she lifts up her other arm, and starts creating a mini-light show with both of her claws. 

*(Well, someone seems to be enjoying herself. Booker is right though, we don't know what to expect from this outlaw, so we need to stay alert.)* I fly closer to Sneasel, so I can be right next to the pocket Booker is sitting in. "H-Hey, you c-can sense a-aura, r-right? S-Sense anything?"

Booker shakes his tiny head. "No, nothing. I can only feel the auras of the four of us."

"Maybe they're not even here?" Elm chipped in as he floated up next to us. "If they're out, we can just grab whatever they stole and return it."

Sneasel scoffed. "Naw, if they're out we wait for them here, cuz that'll give us the chance to set up an ambush of our own!" 

"Oh, alright..." Elm floats back, staring off in thought. 

*(... He must be a little worried. Not like I'm one to talk, I'm worried as well. A psychic type powerful enough to erase memories? There's been legends of mythical Pokemon doing that, but not an outlaw. I'm really curious about what kind of pokemon this outlaw is.)* 

The cave's path continues straight on, with no curves or forks in the road. After a few more minutes of walking and Sneasel entertaining Booker with her light-reflecting claws, we come to a large, open room. The ceiling is full of the light-shooting crystals, causing the room to be full of perfectly vertical pillars of light. We're all slightly mesmerized by this sight as we step into the room. *(I'd be amazed if those were natural... I'm guessing this outlaw must've set up this room themselves.)*

Sneasel strolls towards one of the pillars of light and moves to stick her claw in it, wanting to continue her little light show. The moment her claw touches the light, all of the lights in the cave disappear with a loud bang, plunging us into complete darkness! All of us yell in surprise, but before we can call out to each other, one of the crystals reactivates, creating a new column of light right in the middle of the room. The silhouette of a tall, slender pokemon can be seen from within the spotlight.

The silhouette takes out a baton and a top hat, and puts the hat on her head as she spins around the baton with her other hand. "WELCOME, ONE AND ALL! I, MADAM MEMORY, WILL BE YOUR HOST TONIGHT!" An energic feminine voice booms through the entire room. "Ohohohoho! What an INTERESTING audience we have today-"

"To hell with this." I hear Sneasel run past me in the darkness, and I see her shadow fly through the spotlight, trying to slash the silhouette. However, the silhouette simply disappears, and the spotlight turns off as another crystal activates a few feet way activates in its place. The mysterious silhouette reforms under this new spotlight. 

"I **LOVE** audience participation, but I'm afraid the audience needs to **STAY SEATED!**" With a wave of her baton, I feel an invisible rope wrap around my arms, legs, and wings, locking me in place! I can hear Sneasel, Booker, and Elm grunting as they try and escape their own psychic restraints! "Perfect! Now you're all *comfortably* seated, I can start the show!"

Once again, the spotlight and the silhouette disappears, and both reappear a few feet away. "Ohohohohoh! Get your snacks ready folks! Madam Memory has got some **JUICY** thoughts to show off tonight!" Some of the other crystals on the ceiling begin to glow, slightly illuminating the darker parts of the room, allowing me to see my guildmates, and the true form of the silhouette.

It's a Gardevoir, wearing a green top hat with a red stripe, and using a black wand with a white tip. "Aren't memories just a beautiful thing? There's just one, teeny, *tiny* problem with them, and that's that they don't get to be shared in their *raw*, **unfiltered** form!" The outlaw cackles to herself, her laugh making my fur stand on end. "The TRUE thoughts of your friends, haven't you ever wanted to know them? What they REALLY think of you? And haven't all of you ever just wanted to say what you *reaaaallllyyyy* think?" Elm's skull shakes from side to side as he continues to struggle against the power binding him. The outlaw sees this and puts her hand to her ear. "What's this!? Do I hear a *VOLUNTEER?!* She raises her hand and snaps, causing a spotlight to shine over Elm. The sudden light makes his eye sockets grow, and he freezes up like a deer caught in headlights.

"How COURAGEOUS of you to be our first volunteer! Now, without *further* ado... **Viola!**" With a twirl, the Gardevoir disappears, and instead a transparent version of Elm forms in her place. An echo-y, almost ethereal version of Elm's voice can be heard from the hologram. *"Every day I thank Arceus I was sent to this world and able to join the guild... I love it here, and all of my guildmates! They're a bunch of shitposting goofballs, but I wouldn't have it any other way!"* The holographic Elm bounces from side to side happily, as the real Elm is sweating, his red eyeball shaking from within his skull. 

The Gardevoir's disembodied voice booms throughout the room. "OHOHOHOHOHOH! My my *my*, this little human really likes his new buddies, doesn't he? But... Is that **all** he thinks about them?" The sound of a snap reverberates around us, and the posture and demeanor of the Elm hologram instantly changes. Now the hologram is rubbing his chin mischievously.

*"Heh... They're a bunch of freaks alright! Perfect for messing with and playing pranks on! Especially that weirdo Togetic, it's hilarious how he c-c-can't s-seem t-to st-st-stop himself from st-st-stuttering! Bwahahahahah! And those rants he goes on, I could watch those all day! I'll have to find some ways to get that sperg to rant on command so I can laugh at him whenever I want!"*

I see the real Elm staring at me from the corner of my eye. I ignore his staring and close my eyes, trying to drown out the voice of his doppelganger. *(... So that's what Elm thinks of- Wait, I can't let myself be taken in by this outlaw's showy theatrics! I need to start thinking of a plan to get us out of here!)* I try and struggle against my restraints again, but my limbs and wings still feel like they're bound by an invisible rope. I open my eyes and try to call out with my voice, but I can't open my mouth, so all that comes out are muffled grunts. *(Damn... Damn! How can one psychic-type be this strong? Could something in this cave be amplifying her power? Or maybe she set up this entire trap beforehand, and there's some device in the room restraining us? Ugh, there has to be something I can do!)*

The Elm hologram suddenly disappears and the Gardevoir struts into the spotlight, whirling around her wand. Her hair-raising cackle once again fills the room. "Thank you, Elm, for such an *entertaining* first act! Now, who wants to follow that up!? *Oooooohhhh,* why don't we leave it to chance!" The Gardevior pirouettes and laughs as she spins around with one arm outstretched. "Annnnnnnnnnddddd... **YOU!**" Her momentum stops instantly, and her arm is pointing at Booker, who's suspended in mid-air. The spotlight over Elm disappears and instead one lights over Booker. I can just barely see his head and tiny limbs struggling against his binds. "Awww, what a little cutie! I wonder what you think of your friends?"

The Gardevoir holds her wand horizontally, and snaps with her free hand. A hologram of Booker appears on her wand and sits down. *"I like my friends, but... Why do Toge and Elm get to fly while I can't!? So many pokemon at the guild can fly, even ones that used to be humans, why am I the only one left out!? And Sneasel... She's so nice to me, but she just makes me feel even more weak and useless! Am I going to be stuck leashed to her the rest of my life!? I hate it... And I hate her! I know it's not her fault, but I can't stand how useless she makes me feel!"* As the Booker hologram rants, the outlaw feigns a look of compassion and understanding. Meanwhile, Sneasel turns her head and has shut her eyes tight, trying to ignore Booker's thoughts. The real Booker has stopped trying to struggle and just stares down at the ground.

I try and tune out the voice and continue thinking. *(I can't reach the items in my bag, and everyone else can't seem to do anything either. This display of psychic power must be draining on her, maybe it would just be best if we wait it out... Huh?)* I feel the invisible binds around me suddenly loosen a tiny bit. I wiggle my entire body, trying to pull one of my arms free. Just as I feel like I'm making some progress, the Gardevior spots my squirming with a cold glare, and instantly my restraints tighten! She then turns her attention back to the ranting Booker hologram. *(Ugh! Well, at least now I know she can't keep perfect focus, I guess I have no choice but to sit through this and wait until her focus wanes enough for me to break these binds.)* I sigh, and decide to "enjoy" the show.

The Booker hologram finishes its rant, and it fades away as the Gardevoir spins the wand it was sitting on. "Poor, poor little Booker... A human stuck in a tiny body like that and unable to fly! His partner must feel so sorry for him..." The spotlight over Booker turns off, and now it's Sneasel's turn in the spotlight. She looks up with a start the moment the bright light shines over her. "Or *does* she?" The Gardevoir snaps her fingers, and she disappears a Sneasel hologram takes her place.

*"I really want to help Booker get stronger cuz of how small and weak he is... So why do I keep worrying about what he'll do when he finally learns how to fly and fight on his own? What if he decides to go off on his own once he gets strong enough? I don't want that to happen! Maybe... If he does ever learn how to fly, I could make one of his wings get hurt in an "accident". Not enough to seriously injure him, but enough to make sure he'll be unable to fly for a while. Then he'll have to stick with me!"* The hologram sighs and sits down. *"Or... Maybe it's better if Booker doesn't hang around me at all. Cuz if I ever do lose control by accident while in a dungeon... I'm afraid of what I would do to him or any other guildmates... Booker's got some good friends here, maybe it's best if I just run off one day so I don't have to worry about hurting him..."*

I look off towards the real Sneasel, and see her furiously struggling against the psychic power restraining her. My own restraints start to feel weaker. *(Yes! Sneasel, keep it up! I wish I could tell them all to keep struggling, but I can't even move my arms to give them any signals...)* Just as I'm about to try and free one of my arms, the outlaw's voice echoes through the room. 

"What **drama!** But doesn't it feel good for you two to finally have what you actually think about each other out in the open? No more needing to hold back what you really think!" The outlaw twirls back into the spotlight, causing the Sneasel hologram to fade away as she takes its place. "Now, time for our **final** act! And I've saved the best for last! None of you will ever look at your little Toge the same way again!" She points her wand at me, and my eyes are blinded momentarily by the brightness of the spotlight. 

I try and not let her words get to me, but I can't help but worry about what memories and thoughts of mine she'll unearth. *(... She's going to show some of my memories with Dewott, isn't she? Or... Maybe some of my old mean thoughts about Booker? Wait, oh no... SHE'S GOING TO REVEAL TEAM COZY'S SECRET TO EVERYONE, ISN'T SHE?! Wait, she already read Elm's mind and didn't reveal that, so I'm safe on that front.)* I take a deep breath, and prepare myself mentally. The Gardevoir snaps her fingers once again, and is replaced with a hologram of me.

*"I-I'm s-so w-weak... M-My guildmates n-never seem to t-take notice of me..."*

*(... If these are supposed to be my own thoughts, why am I stuttering in them? I guess it's just another way of the outlaw taunting me.)*

*"A-All I want.. Is to b-be able t-to say what I r-really think w-without p-people thinking I-I'm w-weird for stuttering..."*

*(Is that what I really think? I just find the stutter annoying, and I do speak my mind most of the time, especially if I get into one of my rants.)*

*"A-And wh-what I w-w-want to s-say is... I-I... I-I have f-feelings for S-Sneasel!"*

*(**WHAT**.)*

The holographic monstrosity masquerading as me starts to drool as he floats around in the air gleefully. *"I... Really love Sneasel! She's so cute and powerful, I just want her to be mine! She can do better than that little bug, she should be with ME! I can just imagine her constantly pushing me to try and get stronger while also teasing me for being weaker than her... And then we could have training sessions where we spar, and then as we get all hot and sweaty-"*

*(**I'M ENDING THIS FARCE.**)* 

With all of the force I can muster, I move my arm into my bag and grab a Blast Seed, but the binds around me suddenly tighten up again, making it impossible to get my hand out of my bag! *(Dammit, wasn't fast enough for her not to notice! All I can do is wiggle my arms uselessly! Wait... Wiggle... METRONOME! C'mon, give me something good!)* I wag my finger from side to side, and a warm aura envelops me. Suddenly, a large blade of blue energy shoots out from my right arm, and I feel the invisible rope around me sha
