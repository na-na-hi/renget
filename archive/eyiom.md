# [Life Cycle of a Sapling](https://archive.alice.al/vt/thread/29539794/#q29542347#34231870)
> How are saplings made?  Are saplings canonically shaped like mini versions of Fauna? Do their voices sound like her?
The sapling life cycle is as follows
>Infant sapling sprouts from soil
>Infant sapling fed diet of baby food, compost, sunlight, and breast milk for one to two years.
>Infant sapling enters torpor, forming a "cocoon" of bark that leaves only its stem exposed.
>After two to four months of gestation, a fully grown sapling emerges.
At this point, sapling growth diverges down of one of two paths.
>The majority of grown saplings live for around two to three years before dying of natural causes or comical mishaps.
>Sapling remains decompose, fertilize the surrounding soil, and usually leave behind half-a-dozen seeds.
>Over the course of nine months, these seeds will germinate into infant saplings, eventually sprouting and starting the cycle anew.
Roughly one-in-twenty five saplings instead continue growing in response to environmental and social factors. They grow larger, develop female sexual characteristics, and become vastly more intelligent over the course of their lifespan. These saplings mature into kirins, who serve as the caretaker and shepherd of their lesser kin.
Truly fascinating.

Am I the only one hung up on the image of Fauna breastfeeding one of these saplings?
Just picture Fauna finding a lost sapling out in the woods at night, tired, scared, and hungry. She lets it bounce up into her loving arms and embraces the poor, shivering, scared little sapling with all the warmth she can muster. It whimpers softly. It's losing color in its leaves. It's starving.
That's when Fauna smiles and whispers to the sapling that everything will be alright. She pulls down her dress and draws the sapling closer. Her motherly affection resonates, and childlike instinct compels the quivering sapling's lips to furtively latch onto her breast. The sapling is so cold, but mommy's skin is so warm. Its leaves wiggle with delight. The sapling teases her nipple with its tongue. Fauna giggles at the sensation, gently rubbing its head to encourage it. The sweet taste of milk, however, is enough to incite the sapling to begin suckling more and more, before slowing into long, smooth gulps. The fearful tears at the edges of its eyes have dried, and are replaced by a serene, almost blissful expression as warm milk fills its belly and mommy's hand caresses its head.
Fauna whispers that everything will be alright now. Everything will be okay. The color returns to the sapling's cheeks as mommy's sweet, creamy milk nurses it back to life. Its suckling slows. Its lips unlatch. It looks up at Fauna, and a small burp rises from its throat. Fauna giggles. The sapling smiles. Fixing her dress, Fauna brings the sapling back into a cradle, turning back towards her cottage and into the peaceful night.

Unfortunately, that just makes them scream louder.
> Not OP but I’d just make the fire hotter. I mean, what are the saplings going to do, not burn to death? 
A friend of mine is a sapling breeder who talks about this shit all the time.
Basically burning a sapling dead or alive causes the ashes to spread more seeds in soil than a regular burial would, leading to more saplings. The temperatures required to utterly sterilise a sapling's remains would require an actual incinerator. 
> A ... Sapling breeder? Like a gardener? 
He breeds domesticated saplings for purchase, which means learning a lot about their biology and behavior.
Botany is a big part of it, obviously, but also crap like behavioral psychology, knowing all of the stuff you need to take care of one, etc. etc. 
> What are non domesticated saplings like? 
They're the ones that live out in the woods with a Fauna. "Domesticated" is kind of a misnomer given that they usually live in a house with her, but it's an apt enough term for describing a sapling kept by a human as a pet instead, especially given how you need to condition them like one. 

You'd actually be shocked by how simple you can pull it off. It's not easy, but it's doable.

Infant saplings, the green plant balls with the leaves on their heads, don't really have the cognitive ability to understand who Fauna is. They aren't mentally developed enough to understand such things yet. But they do get stressed out when they go long periods without stimuli from Fauna even if they've never seen her before in their entire lives. This is why it's recommended that you buy things like a speaker to play her music, pictures of Fauna, or a doll for it to imprint upon. Once you have those, the "separation anxiety" they experience is mitigated.

Grown saplings, the tiny little Faunas, are more complicated. Fauna quickly imprints upon them as their mother, and pretty much nothing can dissuade them from that notion. Like an infant sapling, you can soothe this somewhat with Fauna-related stimuli, but they will miss Fauna given a prolonged absence from her and begin suffering from intense anxiety attacks. This is why, for at least four hours a day, it's recommended that you place a sapling before a screen with Fauna's stream on it, otherwise the stress of separation can and will lead to health complications. VODs work too, but loose their effectiveness over time. The fact that a grown sapling is usually so attached to Fauna leads to a lot of pet owners get rid of their saplings once they reach maturity, since it's such a hassle to keep it from freaking out.

As for your water question, you only need to water your infant sapling like a plant. Their "skin" is actually a woven mesh of roots that absorb water, which they need to survive. The same applies to their growth cycle. This is also the reason why you don't bathe an infant sapling in soapy water, since it's potentially toxic. Grown saplings, however, lose this ability. They consume all sustenance orally, but still need some exposure to the sun to remain active. 

> ![Was...was this...?](https://s1.alice.al/vt/image/1661/19/1661195010051.jpg)

Yup. Plenty of writers, artists, scientists, philosophers, and the like have written about saplings throughout history. Their strange behavior and life cycle appealed to a lot of scholars. I think Theophrastus was the first to write a treatise on them, but other mentions of saplings allegedly go back to ancient Mesopotamia and China.

# [Introduction to Sapling Psychology](https://archive.alice.al/vt/thread/29870063/#q29888904)
>  Can I take a sapling home like it was a stray animal? 

You can, but without fauna you can expect it to die in 2-3 days. 

And not peacefully. It will be wailing nonstop for the first 24 hours away from Fauna, then it's vocal cords will cease to function, then it will start spasming and tearing into it's own flesh, eyes, teeth, hair, etc. for the following 24 hours, and for the last 24 hours it will almost entirely cease functioning. It is a grim sight. 

I'm a graduate student of psychology whose worked with saplings in lab conditions for several years now. Saplings tend to make great test subjects because of their uniform predictability and unique response to certain psychological triggers, not to mention the fact that they are so numerous and expendable.

A sapling's initial reaction to realizing they are without their oshi is confusion. They become hyperaware and begin searching their surroundings, which inevitably leads to them being overwhelmed by anxiety. When they cannot find her, a sapling will enter a state of distress, screaming and crying in the hopes that she may instead find them. The longer they remain in this state of distress, the more hopeless and despondent they become. Normally, a sapling will pass out from exhaustion within six to twelve hours of wailing, but will continue to be in an agitated state even during rest.

Your post contains a common misconception about sapling psychology and physiology. Saplings only self-harm in response to certain conditions.

After twenty-hour hours without Fauna, a sapling will normally become wholly despondent. They will steadily refuse food and water, instead remaining trapped in a fugue-like depression until either Fauna herself snaps them out of it or they die from dehydration/starvation. Most sapling psychologists believe this depressive state to be caused by a negative feedback loop, in which the sapling convinces itself that Fauna is gone because of something they did. They did something to upset her, they didn't love her enough, whatever the reason, they grow to believe Fauna now hates them personally and is punishing them.

Saplings exhibit self-harming behaviors when an outside source confirms these negative feelings. My professor conducted a famous study in which five saplings, depressed after a full day without Fauna, were herded into a room before a television screen. We then played a doctored video in which Fauna stated that she was graduating because she hated her saplings, before naming each individual sapling in the room as the worst of the lot.

The response was immediate. Every sapling entered a state of distress, screaming with all of their remaining energy, before quickly devolving into an orgy of suicidal violence. One sapling began beating its head against the wall of the chamber until its skull fractured, later dying of a brain hemorrhage. Another stripped itself of its clothing, dived into the screen whilst screaming apologies, before electrocuting itself. A third simply sat in place, incessantly screaming for a full twenty-six hours, before dying of a stroke. The reaction of the other two saplings, however, was of great interest. Instead of harming themselves, the two quickly turned on each other, blaming their opposite for their oshi's graduation. A brief (and pathetic) scuffle ensued, ending when one sapling strangled the other to death. The triumphant sapling, of course, then proceeded to contort its body until snapping its own neck at an unnatural angle.

Very exciting. Very informative. Very funny.

What the hell, guys?! I don't think I could ever force myself on an effeminate little Sapling, his petite androgynous frame unable to defend himself from my groping hands and lusty attention. I would be remiss to kiss his soft, svelte neck and touch his slender chest and back. It disgusts me to thin how hard his tiny cock would get as his protests become moans of pleasure. My stomach churns at the thought of picking him up and forcing my cock deep inside of his tight, needy hole. Bile rises in my throat as I envision pounding him from behind, his wrists in my hands as his failed-male cock spurts useless loads onto the bedsheets from a prostate orgasm. And my thoughts are but of revulsion as I imagine what it would be like to cum deep inside him, emptying myself until I am spent as we both collapse, panting, covered in sweat, before we doze off in the afterglow. How sickening.

Fauna tucks in all your sapling brothers and sisters, but not you. You are the weakest sapling, always bullied by the others. They all get their share of mommy's milk, but you don't. They're well on their way of being quaking sequioas, whereas you are the weakest, puniest sapling. They all produce so much sap that fauna collects, but you can't manage more than a little spurt. You're out in the living room, shivering and crying
>uuuuuuu
>uuuuuUUUUUUUUU
>UUUUUUU I MISS FAUNA MOMMY WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUuuuuuuu
Using up all your strength, you manage one final cry. A well curved shadow rushes out from the dark.
>Oh no!!! I forgot my most precious little sapling!!!!
It's fauna! You would be happy but you have zero energy left. Fauna picks you up, grabs a blanket, and tucks you in to the sofa for a good night kiss.
>Now my precious sapling, you know why I can't give you milk. I was smoking and drinking while you were but an acorn, so you're lactose intolerant. I noticed you're not growing at all, and the sun can only do sooooo much. If you can't have my milk... you want... my juice?
>yaaaaay mommy fauna i want juice!
>OK my dearie...
Fauna puts your favorite pillow under your neck, and instructs you to lie straight on your back. She pulls down her pajama bottoms and underwear, exposing her hairy, but well manicured, nether regions.
>I want you to open your mouth, and suck and lick until the juice comes out
She gets on top of you and sits herself on your face. Her legs envelop you, and your mouth is right there. You lick and suck her nether regions, as her juices start to leak
>uuuuuu that's my precious little sapling
Her juices taste amazing, nothing like the salty milk and coins the other saplings say. She tastes like the berries her good friend and life partner Aunt Mumei picks for all of us.
>oh my, you really like licking me up! 
Fauna notices your once frail, limp stem perk up. Normally she wouldn't be able to rub it without ripping your leaves, but it seems like that's but a problem in the past.
>You're getting strong! Keep sucking!!!
Fauna starts rubbing your stem back and forth. You feel funny, but it's a good feeling. She's rocking back and forth against your mouth and tongue, basically humping your face. Her rubbing and jerking your stem is making your mouth movements more aggressive
>uuuu my mouth is getting tired
>keep going my sapling! We're almost there!
Electricity is shooting into your brain. You never felt this good before. Fauna's juices are seeping more and more.
>uuuuuuuu i'm about to squeeb mommy
>squeeb with me!!!!!
>SQUEEEEEEEEEEB
>SQUEEEEEEEEEEB
Fauna squirts her juices all in your mouth, filling you right up right as you shoot hot sap all over yourself and fauna. You're tired, but full and content. You never felt like this before. You notice fauna, normally full of energy, just as tired as you
>Let's get you cleaned up.
She wipes the sap off of her, then cleans you up.
>You're such a big strong sapling now. Do you want to sleep with the other saplings?
>yes mommy!!!
Fauna leads you to their bedroom before hesitating
>On second thought, do you want to sleep with me every day so I can feed you my special mommy juice?
That could only mean one thing: you will never miss fauna

#[Are The Saplings OK?](https://warosu.org/vt/thread/39417220#p39467343)
It has been 7 days and 20 hours since we last saw Fauna. Food, supplies, and morale is decreasing by the minute. Feeling our despair, she sent out a tweet reminding us that she would be back soon, but it wasn't enough. Hardly a squeeb or an uuu can be heard in the FauForest. Things are not okay. The stems on our heads can no longer photosynthesize as the bleakness of our situation combined with the apex of darkness in the Winter Solstice means that death is approaching. Water is hard to come across as most of it freezes before it touches the ground. Milk isn't an option while she's gone. Some saplings are starting to pass away, some out of boredom, others out of despair, and a few even starving to death. As Thomas Paine once said in his work The Crisis, "These are the times that try men's souls." It's only a matter of time before a micro-pandemic of smallpox sweeps across the forest and kills us all.

Some saplings, driven to the brink of madness, have begun doing her favorite things in an effort to appease her and bring her back to us, as if she were a God. Her role as Keeper of Nature has continued for four billion years at this point in time, and yet the bleakness of our circumstances makes me think she may have permanently left the job and left us on our own. These saplings, desperately clinging to the idea that she still bears the crown of Mother Nature, have begun playing Getting Over It, drinking tea, or even attempting to enjoy Fauna's vegan lifestyle. Some have even searched her private belongings for her clothes, and dress like her to cope with her absence. As if things couldn't get any worse, some saplings have elected to perform sacrifices in Her name; these gruesome rituals take place at the top of the highest tree in the forest, the victims squeebing out as they are killed, under a hopeless notion that Fauna will her the deafening cries of a dying sapling. It's only a matter of time before the sacrifices become a constant practice, and cannibalism may very well be the only way for any sapling to survive. The elder, baby, and disabled saplings randomly disappear at night without a trace. Rumors have it that they are murdered to cull the population so that our food rations last longer. When.. or if.. Fauna comes back, the sight of mass graves and our sacrifice altar will bring her fury to a level that hasn't been seen since the Dinosaurs died out. May she have mercy on our souls.
