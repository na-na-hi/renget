>be me
>just the son of a farmer, fourteen winters old
>walking back from the village of koroneijuku with some tools my dad needs
>usually i don't go by myself, but dad says i'm a big boy now
>whatever, dad
>our farm is a bit away from the village but if you take a winding stone path through an old forest, you'll get there
>y'know, i never got the chance to pay attention to things around me
>mom said i always thought too hard about stuff
>usually my dad would tell me stories about the land while we walked
>that long ago, a glorious empire led by the god-king yeguu ruled over it
>its banners stretching from the mountains in the north to the seas in the south
>was always unsure whether to believe him or not, but it's not like i know much else
>we have to live off this land, no time to be exploring it after all

>i turn my attention to the path i'm walking on
>the rocks are beaten and cracked, its structure remaining but its age showing
>this path must've existed way before i was born
>maybe even before my parents were born
>it's as if ten thousand people have walked on it before me
>and ten thousand more will walk on it after me
>the road that goes on for distances i can't even fathom in either direction
>i dont even know where it actually begins and ends
>the farm and the village only lie near it
>as if this path once had a bigger purpose than just being a way to go to the village and back
>it's rare to see an outsider around these parts, however
>only us and the village guards regularly use this path now
>the trip back is quiet save for the sounds of nature
>the branches of the trees sway in the gentle breeze
>it was snowing last night but it's all melted now
>even the water that comes from snow is gone
>it's still chilly, but that's winter for you
>take in the environment around me
>it's so peaceful
>and serene
>and beautiful

>suddenly i notice some scratches on one of the trees near the path
>walk over to it and examine it
>it's not just random scratches
>it's writing
>the scratches are faded into the wood now
>it's not a very deep etching, and the crevices are somewhat filled with moss
>easy to miss if you aren't looking for it, i was just lucky
>i can still make out most of it though
>an outline of a heart is carved into the tree
>inside it, the letters "KC + UR"
>"never forgotten"
>"Year 1170"
>as i look at it i feel a tinge of sadness
>i don't know what any of this means
>is this a memorial?
>stare at it some more
>who wrote this? when?
>clearly it wasn't written recently
>the text gives me no further answers
>i don't have time to stay near it, the sun's almost down
>but that doesn't stop me from thinking about it
>and as i walk away from the ancient mark immortalized into the tree
>my steps trodding on a path which may have matched its age
>my sorrow gives way to wonder
>the person who carved it is long dead, i am sure
>their passion probably died with them
>and the meaning of that passion has been lost to time as far as i know
>but its result remains
>a message orphaned from its context, yet still it speaks
>waiting for someone like me to come across it
>to ponder it
>and eventually, to forget it
>it'll wait for another person to find it
>and the cycle will repeat until the tree is dead
>then this remnant of a era infinitely long before ours will disappear
>its history, forgotten
>its purpose, complete
>maybe mom has a point
>i really think too much about things.
