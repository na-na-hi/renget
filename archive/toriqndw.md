Karaoke Night with IRyS and Kronii

Having made their way to some random karaoke bar, IRyS and Kronii are relaxing in the back, enjoying the performances of the other patrons. Some are actually quite good, but most are laughably bad. Already pretty deep into her drink Kronii excuses herself to the bathroom. Her friend away, IRyS took the opportunity to put herself down for a song, set to happen just a few songs from now. Kronii gets back with plenty of time to spare for the show she isn't aware is coming.

"And next up we have IRyS," the DJ calls. "Come on up here, IRyS, the stage is yours."

The sexy nephilim excitedly hops off her stool and makes her way to the front of the bar. She takes the mic with the confidence of a woman about to put this joint in its place. After a nod from the music man generic Van Halen song #652 starts playing. IRyS bops her head in time with the music and as the tension grows she rips into the opening of the song like no one but her could.

Instantly the crowd, Kronii included, is in her hands. She croons and keens, her angelic falsetto making David Lee Roth look the bitch he is. As the song rises she starts swinging her hips, her free hand sensuously drawing invisible sigils on her chest. The vocals, nothing but an excuse for Roth to talk about his dong, are not lost on the crowd, who are following IRyS's motions like they've been hypnotized. Her hand starts descending, just as she might from Tokyo Tower, inching ever closer to her crotch. Just as she tears into the chorus her hand hits it mark, her fingers grasping tightly and yanking hard. Her tear-away skirt is sent across the room, landing on some random dazed patron's head.

Realizing what has happened, every eye in the joint locks onto IRyS's waist, utterly taken by the tight and threadbare panties clinging tightly to her crotch. One might mistake said panties for those of a middle schooler, but there was no mistaking their contents for that. Fighting at the flimsy material was IRyS's rigid and throbbing nephilcock. The already entranced crowd had lost their shit upon realization, but only one of them managed to act.

Kronii came barreling towards the stage and in one great leap took IRyS from her feet, ending her performance prematurely.

Their night, however, ended in the cell of the local lockup, charges of indecent exposure, lewd and lascivious and a number of others relating to the unspeakable acts Kronii performed on that stage pending. For his part, the owner of the bar pleaded for leniency because the last time he'd had such a successful karaoke night was literally never.
