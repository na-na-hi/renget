->Patient Zero<-
May 8th, 1543
A French girl kneels at her alter to Baphomet in the farmhouse, made of her parents bones and soaked in the blood of cattle. She says the words she learned in her vision were Latin that she didn't understand.

She pours the blood of her parents over herself and drags her fiancÃ© out of the horse stalls, bound and gagged. He's pushed over onto the alter and tries desperately, like a pig unwilling to go to the slaughter. She slams the shears into his stomach as his muffled screams flow like his blood onto the hay around the alter.

The life leaves his eyes, and the girl feels enraptured, full of life, and invincible.

The goat demon appears before her. "You have followed all of my instructions and proven yourself worthy of power."

A contract appears in her hands; her finger starts to bleed. "Sign it. You will never die under its conditions."

The girl signs without hesitation.

She was more than this village.

More than this kingdom.

More than this world.

============================================

Tokyo, Japan, Modern Day
"....What do you mean we can't identify it? Even after we sent the sample to the USA?" a doctor says with desperation in his voice and interns and administrative staff surrounding him. 60 dead, all with the same unidentifiable disease that emulsified their blood, turning it into a metallic-smelling scarlet stone in their veins.

"Yes, so we'll make something up! Anything! We can't afford another scandal!" The head of the hospital says.

"But they *know* they are being lied to and *sue our asses* into oblivion!"

They argue surrounded by the lucky few that manage to barely live, completely paralyzed below the neck and requiring a machine to breathe. The families haven't even seen the bodies of the dead.

"You are *FIRED* if you don't play to the story, Hanazawa! Don't pretend you don't need this job after your wife just gave birth!"

Hanazawa sighs as he looks over the victims again, a reminder of the horrific disease he had to keep the public calm about. They didn't know how it spread, how it incubated, or under what conditions it survived best. It seemed targeted as well; only a specific floor of an office building was hit with this, with a mortality rate of 76% so far.

"Understood, Director. But they're... going to need to see the bodies." the doctor says.

"You could tell them it's a new flu, and they would believe it. Just use your head, or you will lose it."

The doctor nods as he decontaminates himself and prepares himself to lie to the public for the sake of his job. A disaster waiting to happen.

=============================================

"...Disappointing." The cute plague doctor says as she sits on a shattered island in a realm of demons. Her lab is full of esoteric alchemical equipment and racks of samples of her diseases, concocted to keep her living as long as possible. Every life she took was another year for her to perfect the art of murder by disease.

"In terms of spread? Or Mortality?" Pazuzu asks as he sits by the woman he knew as Penny.

"Spread. This venture will have proven worse than the samples released in China." Penny says as she leans on her palm.

"...Why not a more... aggressive approach then?" Baphomet offers tantalizingly.

"Go on..." Penny says as she stands up.

"Cease with the passive way of doing this; refine the samples and use them as bioweapons." Baphomet says.

"...True, I can make it much... much more virulent and widespread..."

"And then they will all run in fear." Pazuzu says to his rival demon.

"We can escape afterward; anyone who recognizes our work as magic will be too terrified or busy dealing with the aftereffects of the plagues we unleash to give chase." Penny says.

"And we will all live forever." The demons and theoretically immortal human say in unison, like a mantra.
