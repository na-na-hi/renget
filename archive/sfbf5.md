###*Anjanath*

=============================================

>\>You thought having both a normal Anja and a Fulgur would cause friction.
>\>You were right, but for all the wrong reasons.

\>The solid, meaty clap of Anjanath flanks colliding with each other nearly makes your ears pop.
\>You know your girls well enough to know that they've been planning this for a while now.
\>Usually, they wouldn't be coordinated or agreeable enough to pull off any schemes.
\>The brute wyverns are much too territorial and competitive.
\>Of course, monsties are not like normal monsters.
\>You suddenly regret those teamwork exercises you put them through.
\>Had they been plotting ever since then?
\>The mischievous glint in their eyes told you all you needed to know.
\>They wiggle their tails and toes, grinding their scaly hindquarters together as they salivate.
\>Stormcloud, your Fulgur, licks her chops, sending sparks crackling through the air.
\>Hot Stuff - why did you name her that? - pants wetly, smoke curling from her nose.
\>You could try to run, but you wouldn't get far, and the chase would only excite them.
\>You swallow the lump in your throat and clutch your Kinship Stone.
\>You remember the words of your companion.
\>"Ride on, buddy!"

###*Astalos*

=============================================

\>Staring into those glowing eyes while you're perched on top of him, feeling the muscles lining his slit flex as that exotic shaft everts itself,
\>sliding out hot and dripping against your stomach, just begging to be touched by hands, lips, tongue and anything else
\>that spread cloaca tightening as you plunge into it, contracting and squeezing around you the more aroused he gets
\>the faint heartbeat felt through his dick and insides becomes a pulsed current spreading through yours, soon forcing you to throb in time with him
\>ozone-tinged breath hits you alongside a chittering moan, looking up to see his eyes closed and maw open, ready for one last push over the edge
\>putting both hands around his length is enough
\>a sudden jolt hits your forearms, clamping your fingers down on him tighter than your body would naturally allow
\>the wyvern's head crest flares and crackles in front of you, accompanied by the heat and pressure of his dick flaring out against your skin below
\>you have just enough muscle control left to aim it downward toward his face, before he takes over your lower half completely
\>spasms hilt you inside the warmth of his vent, legs locking around the tail underneath, overriding any motions your hips might have wanted otherwise
\>his first shot splatters onto his own crest and beak before you manage to press against him further, angling lower to send thick jets of white down into his throat
\>you spend the next minute in a shared orgasm with the Astalos, his body's electrical pulses causing you to shoot deeper inside him than a human would ever manage otherwise
\>you slump forward as he gradually releases you, pressing your lips to his softening flare, taking your first unhindered breath and letting the wyvern's scent flood into you
\>squeezing up the length of his shaft while the hot, slimy, organic taste of Astalos sperm envelopes your tongue, sucking on his urethra to pull out the last thickened fluids still left inside him
\>the receding flesh twitches against your face, enjoying the attention as it pulls back into his body. His cloaca spreads open wider in front of you, waiting to be kissed in the most intimate way possible
\>a minute spent with your face buried in the heat of his slit passes like an eternity, only interrupted by the eventual protest of your lungs, now rudely demanding oxygen
\>finally pulling away, climbing forward onto his plated chest, you have an up-close look at the size of the mess left behind
\>licking his crest clean is an irresistible urge at this point, then it only takes a prying finger to open his mouth wide, letting you enjoy the sight of his own load dripping from his teeth and throat
\>you lose track of the time spent exploring the Astalos's maw, content to enjoy the galvanic taste of his tongue curling against your own, and the arousing feeling of his teeth and beak on your neck
\>somewhere during that time your positions reverse, now on your back with your massive partner hanging over you, jaws still locked around you, hot breath still washing over your face
\>it isn't until he pulls back and gives you a long one-eyed stare from six inches away, that you notice the warmth growing down by your feet
\>that familiar stare was more clear than any words... the stare that could make your heart pound more than any G-rank mission
\>"ready?"
\>immediately rolling over onto all fours gives answer enough, even if the pheromones coming from your body already answered him long before then
\>you brace your back hard against his chest as he mounts you, feeling the immense weight bearing down even when most is being held up by his wing arms 
\>the Astalos cranes his head down to make eye contact again, probably enjoying your expression at the moment he penetrates you
\>his shaft pushes in further every time he thrusts forward, still barely able to fit while being flexible and dripping with his body's natural lubricant 
\>briefly you wonder how many hunters have mated with monsters, or if you're really the first to feel the primal bliss of being taken by the feral wyvern on top of you
\>a tongue intrudes on the thought, followed by the familiar scraping of teeth over you face
\>he decides that penetrating one end wasn't enough, contorting his neck down to hold you between his jaws, tongue sliding along yours every time his hips meet you from behind
\>you reach up with one hand to feel his shuddering crest, pulling him closer, trying to get his tongue down your throat
\>being kissed by a monster while he's rutting you becomes too much to handle-for both of you
\>the building pleasure of his dick rubbing your prostate explodes as he flares inside you, the current buzzing through your abdomen instantly spilling what's left of your seed on the ground
\>the wyvern's second round is still massive by comparison, the pulse of his load being pumped into you once again dragging out your own orgasm to match, forcing you to stay in heaven with him to the point of exhaustion
\>you shiver between his armored legs while your senses slowly return, your heart just now sorting out its normal rhythm after being caught between two near-fibrillating ends of the circuit
\>your partner pulls his jaws from yours and rolls onto his side, holding you against his chest with a less-spiky part of his wing arm
\>translucent wing membranes grant you a multi-faceted view through them, enough to see his head resting on the ground just outside, one red eye still fixed on you
\>neither of you bother to break the coupling. Right now the only thing that sounds better than being taken by an Astalos, is falling asleep with him still hilted inside you 

=============================================

>\>What would you do if you suddenly heard a loud BZZZZT, all the power in your house went off, and you went outside to see a huge Astalos on your lawn, in the process of becoming a boltreaver, thrashing around with the cooked remains of your bug zapper stuck on the tip of his horn?
>If your answer was "get a broom and drive him off with it", I hope you're prepared to do battle with that fancy new lightning crest of his.
>>I've fought enough EX Boltreavers to know I'd be better off trying to make a friend than a foe. The only times you should fuck with THE BEST is in bed.

\>Okay, this is your life now
\>There's a bug flailing about your front yard juiced up on most of the town's power grid
\>You're standing there dumbstruck
\>And there's only so long until a blackout could turn into the destruction of multiple neighbourhoods
\>Think dammit, think
\>'I know!' you exclaim, if only to reassure yourself
\>'I will make love with the Boltreaver! I will fug the bug!'
\>No way that'll backfire, surely
\>The Astalos is now fully charged and in control of its newfound strength, regaining its footing and locking eyes onto you
\>With a confident stride you close the gap, planting a kiss on its chitinous snout while rubbing the newly formed horn on its crest
\>Considering the fact you're not already dead, you must be doing something right
\>You aim your kisses lower and lower until their tongue is exploring your mouth. The static from their horn getting stronger as you give it the best handjob you possibly can
\>With a flutter of a crest, you're pushed onto your back as the bug rears up and performs a clean swipe with a beam of pure energy. Pausing for effect before the roof of your house slides off
\>Grabbed by its claws, it takes flight and flings you onto your bed
\>With the slick member now rubbing against your stomach, you confirm this is a male Astalos in his prime, and he's very pent up
\>You hug onto his penis as his thrusts become more vigorous. Bolts of electricity arc around the room
\>He lets out a screech as he reaches his limit, painting the wall behind you with his essence in thick ropes
\>Taking a step back, he begins to trail his tongue down your body, stopping at your crotch. He nips at your pants and gently pulls it off you
\>The bug licks at the erection trapped in your underwear. He looks back up to you with what what could be described as a smile
\>You pull aside what little is covering your manhood and let him have at it, lapping greedily at your cock
\>It doesn't take long for you to crack as well, spilling cum into his maw
\>Both of you completely spent, the Boltreaver carefully rests himself down next to you and coils around your bed, draping a wing over you
\>Crisis adverted
\>Boyfriend obtained 
\>Quest complete

###*Chameleos*

=============================================

\>be in a relationship with a Cham girl
\>being around her for so long has made you wise to her attempts to jokingly zap items out of your inventory with her tongue
\>she's had to get increasingly creative with it, lest her tongue get snatched mid-attempt by your quick hand
\>such as coming at you with it from one angle, only to whip-curve it at the last second and snatch something from you from behind
\>or rapid-firing tongue attacks in an attempt to overwhelm you
\>or slowly creeping it under the bedsheets (you don't have an inventory while you sleep so you assume she's trying to steal your underwear off you)

\>after she took your last ancient potion, you've decided you've finally had enough
\>you ask the Kamura chef to make you the spiciest dango possible and against their better judgement, they prepare you a skewer to go
\>the smell alone is enough to singe your nose but you carefully remove them from the skewer and place them at the top of your pack, making sure that they'll be the first to be grabbed.
\>after you embark, you act like you're digging around in the item box. making it obvious that you're stocking up and knowing full well that thats the kind of thing that excites her kleptomania the most.
\>while walking around in the middle of the forest for a bit you can feel a strong wind behind you, trying to keep your best poker face on as you can tell she took the bait
\>a long pink rope suddenly slaps you on the back and you hear a monster cry that would flinch someone with even max level earplugs
\>turning around and laughing you see her flailing around in circles like a tap dancer, the bright red dango smudged all over her lips, rubbing her face on the grass trying to get it off.
\>you're practically doubling over with how hard you're laughing, finally happy that you got your sweet revenge on that pilfering pest
\>but as your regaining your composure you see a huge purple blur charge at you, flattening and trampling you as she waddles right over you to get to the nearest pond and shoves her whole head in for some much needed relief
\>the cats come to scrape you off the ground and you both pay a much needed visit to the village doctor, they give you a stern look of disapproval of your shenanigans as you try to give a thumbs up in a full body cast, and the chammy lass staring dragonators at you with an ice pack on her tongue. 
\>you think that'll finally put an end to her stealing spree but as you reach to drink a potion its swiped right out of your hand by a pink blur, she gives you a look that tells you're going to have to watch your back even more from now on.

=============================================

\>be Cham
\>plan an epic prank that'll make anon rule the day that he messed with you
\>go to his item box and steal ALL of the healing items he has
\>know the fact he doesn't look twice he takes out his item sets
\>snicker in the shadows of his house as he leaves
\>imagine him getting carted again and again wondering where his potions have gone
\>wait at the side the entrance door to smack him upside the head where he'll prepare another spiel about messing with his stuff

\>6 Hours later
\>he hasn't come back yet
\>ah well probably just decided to finish the hunt without items 
\>prideful little hunter and all that

\>Day 2
\>anon still hasn't come home yet
\>his palico helper didn't even notice he was gone
\>you shouldn't be worried 
\>he is probably just sleeping outside on his little tent in the forest
\>yeah that's a good explanation

\>Day 3
\>nope he is still gone
\>you're starting to get worried
\>you planned on going outside looking for him
\>but the idea of him waiting outside to see you panicked as a gargwa hurt your pride as an elder dragon
\>plus its not the first time you slept under anon's house

\>Day 4
\>no sounds of your name being called
\>no pitter patter of his steps coming from the stone floor of his home
\>you really wanted to go out and find him
\>but you didn't want to let go of the fleeting hope of pranking him one more time
\>the mattress you've been sleeping on still smelt like him
\>you held it close to you and never let go
\>your eyes never left the door entrance the entire day

\>Day 7
\>you had the idea of making a 'welcome back' sign for anon
\>the palico helper would've ruined your surprise so you kicked them out of the house
\>no matter how many times he tried to warn the villagers, you always turned invisible, relishing his frustration
\>but that frustration is only sweeter when its on anon
\>taking some of his swords and bamboo, you spell out the message
\>hold on it needs a more oomph to it
\>'Welcome Back, Nerd'
\>there we go
\>now you can imagine anon's face turning red as he chases you around
\>the smell of the mattress enforces the idea of him being all sweaty
\>you hold it tighter this time, pretending to catch him off guard and securely bury him under your weight 

Day 11
\>the mattress was starting to lose anon's smell
\>but that didn't make sense since you didn't wash it
\>you decided to draw your attention away from the growing problem
\>taking a look at anon's shelf you see various wooden objects
\>one of them looks like you 
\>in a genius move, you decided to get rid of every single one of them except your look-a-like
\>you even put yourself on top of the shelf
\>hmm but you are a bit lonely up there
\>your eyes darted through one of the fallen objects until you see it
\>using your tongue, you wrap around the anon look-alike and placed it side-by-side of small you
\>even laying them on the side like you are doing now
\>the sight of smaller anon under small you comforted you a bit
\>you copied the same exact pose as you turn in for the night
\>the smell of the mattress up against your face at least helped you sleep

Day 15
\>where is it?!
\>wheres your cuddle buddy?!
\>you practically turned anon's house upside down looking for the mattress
\>wait a minute why do you even cling on to that thing
\>it barely even smells like him anymore
\>barely?
\>no 
\>it was the one thing he shared with you when he invited you into his house
\>a nest is the most precious thing to share after all
\>b-between two lovers...
\>you then hear some chatter outside of the house
\>shit they must've heard the racket you made
\>you turn invisible hoping they would ignore it and continue on with their business
\>but then you see the light from the entrance door getting cut out

Day 15 Part 2
\>no no No NO!
\>your tongue shoots desperately to scare some of the villagers pushing the rock
\>but you only hit a hard wall instead
\>you tried to claw your way out of but it was no use
\>it was already sealed
\>anon's house was your tomb
\>a pit formed in your stomach of what was going to happen
\>no you can't die here!
\>you take a look around your cage
\>wood is something of a trivial matter for your draconic strength
\>with one stretch of your wings you could blow it all away-
\>NO!
\>this is wrong, this is anon's house and he trusted ME with his nest!
\>well if you don't let go of that trust then how would you feel getting slain by a village worth of hunters?!
\>how would YOU feel if anon saw us destroying his house?!
\>ANON IS NOT HERE ANYMORE!
\>...
\>...
\>he's not?

Day 20
\>your body hasn't moved from the spot
\>the windows of the room were slowly being blocked out by a blanket
\>it was cold, damp, and lonely
\>just like you
\>you take a look around, seeing the cacophony of trinkets you've caused
\>the small you on the shelf is still turned to the side
\>but the small anon is somehow on its feet
\>looking down at you
\>glaring at you
\>its not the type of playful anger you're used to
\>it was hatred, deep seated hatred
\>reserved for monsters
\>just like you
\>the legs moved on its own
\>the body kept asking for something to eat 
\>anon's box was still there full of tantalizing bugs to eat
\>but the mind refused
\>not because it can't but it shouldn't
\>not after what had happened
\>but the body nonetheless continued to move 
\>the small lake in anon's house still had some
\>the tongue snaked it's way out of the mouth and tasted it
\>it was disgusting 
\>but deserved
\>it used to be fresh thanks to the wooden machine 
\>but that stopped after villagers realized it kept the monster inside strong
\>now it has become rotten 
\>just like you
\>another few slurps and the body was satiated
\>the eyes wandered over its prison 
\>it was the same path all over again, the angry shelf, the tempting box, the taunting message
\>still unused by the way
\>the eyes closed, letting itself rest
\>...
\>a mechanical groan wakes the body up
\>"We can't use the waterwheel here it's useless!"
\>"Why what happened?"
\>"Something must be stuck inside the mechanism, but the only access is through inside the house!"
\>inside?
\>your body rose in its squalor
\>hope rang inside you as you rush towards the small lake in anon's room
\>taking a look deeper in the well, you see something stuck under it
\>when its gone the water can be fresh again
\>and when its fresh you can drink it
\>which you can find more time and energy to escape!
\>you take a deep breath as your tongue reaches deep into the water
\>having to stomach the nasty green buildup of algae and bacteria you finally fish out what was stuck
\>it was the mattress!
\>the machine groaned and finally began to turn
\>"Oh hey now it works!"
\>"Finally! Get the dragonators hooked up and this will be all over!"
\>it is over!
\>anon's here!
\>you bring it up to your face and inhale his sweet sweet-
\>rancid SMELL?!
\>your eyes bulge out even more as you let go of the disgusting object
\>you were surprised how wet anon is 
\>no anon isn't wet, he is...
\>...
\>taking another look of the mattress, the stench invades your nostrils
\>it wasn't anon
\>it didn't have his wonderful odor that you sneaked in for seconds
\>it was gone now
\>just like anon
\>it was now damp, disgusting, full of algae and rot
\>it looked like it was abandoned by its owner and was forced to fester away in the dark
\>just like
\>just like...
\>you
\>a disgusting, arrogant, little, monster that doesn't deserve him
\>that doesn't deserve anon
\>...you're right
\>I don't deserve him
\>I don't deserve-
\>"What in Gog's name are you guys doing at my house?!"
\>anon?

\>be anon
\>standing in front of whatever the fuck the village is doing right now
\>two large dragonators precariously aimed at the sides of your house were hooked up to the water wheel
\>"Hunter! Thank goodness you've arrived!"
\>the sound of yomogi loading her siege weapon with malicious intent could be heard
\>"We recently discovered a Chameleos living in the village, inside your home no less!"
\>"Yes meowster! We even trapped inside and are prepared to take it down!"
\>gogdammit cham what the hell did you do
\>you comb over you bald green head and walked in front of your barricaded house
"Okay for the last time! There is not, no will there ever be a Chameleos living inside my-"
\>a large explosion could be felt from behind
"houssssSSSHIEEEET"
\>turning around, you see chammy right above you
\>in body slamming range
\>you felt the air in your lungs leave all together for her sheer weight
\>didn't help the fact you had to take a deep breath to compensate
\>that was a mistake
\>dear GOG it smells like someone trudged through the sewers like a week!
\>unfortunately the smell complimented the feeling of snot, tears, and I don't know sweat?
\>can elder dragons even sweat?
\>anyway it felt like all three decided to a mating dance and charged straight into your face
\>chammy looked like she the worst case of the sniffles 
\>the roars she made were a mixture of sobbing, choking, and weird roars
\>it was a very awkward situation
\>multiplied indefinitely when the situation was in front of every citizen of kamura village
\>first things first, calm down your crying girlfriend then explain it later
"Hey chammy I manage to snag some of your favorite bugs-"
\>she rudely swatted away the bag you held before digging her face close to your neck
\>oh shit oh fuck you could feel both dry and fresh snot coming from her nostrils 

\>anon be you
\>the past several days were a whirlwind of events between you and chammy
\>it wasn't hard legalizing her stay in Kamura
\>you finally put the "Kamura village Leader" title to good use
\>anyway chammy
\>chammy the chameleos
\>turns out forgetting to tell her that'll you'll be saving a foreign nation from a vampire dragon made her worried sick
\>literally
\>elder dragon immune system saved the day though
\>now she wouldn't STOP leaving you alone
\>everyday she made her presence known to you both inside and outside of a hunt
\>goodbye sleeping inside tents, hello chammy belly
\>she did have an awesome feature of going visible alongside you during long hunts
\>you can't even wirebug far away out of sight without her hyperventilating 
\>she would forcibly fill your packs with max potions, adamant seeds, antidotes, etc.
\>sometimes in the middle of a battle with the help of her tongue
\>it wouldn't be all bad if it wasn't for the fact you kept running out of space in your inventory
\>the twins remedied that by sewing her a pack fitted on her waist, acting as a mobile inventory box
\>sweet
\>sure she did the occasional prank like swapping your flash bombs with hardshell powder
\>she wasn't laughing as hard when you took a good hit from a rathalos
\>basically forcefed a mega potion after the fight
\>it was more or less an upgrade compared to earlier iterations
\>she doesn't even touch your item box anymore
\>always asking permission with a little pawing motion towards the chest
\>now you have to handfeed her insects of her choice
\>doing that seem to help her turn back closer to her original shade of purple 
\>you stop your reminiscing and look towards your new hunting partner
\>her tongue experimentally lashes out in the air before she looks at you with a smile
\>nodding towards her, you mount her back and she speeds down into the valley of the forest
\>life is good

\>THE END

=============================================

\>no trickster hybrid Cham hunting partner who feels MORE exposed wearing clothing than when she isn't
\>mainly because the clothes don't turn invisible with her when she does
\>all she can tolerate are some simple undergarments for the sake of modesty in town
\>but the moment the two of you are either in the privacy of your home, or out of sight of the town gates as you head into the wilds, they're quickly pulled off and tossed to the side
\>usually followed by a long, languid stretch - perhaps a bit longer than necessary, as she meets your gaze with one of her large eyes and a devilish smirk full of sharp teeth
\>"What? Don't tell me this STILL gets you going? You've seen me naked almost every day, you little perv, you!"
\>"I've also seen the sunrise almost every day, doesn't mean I'm tired of it."
\>she turns invisible all the sudden - possibly to regain her composure - shortly before re-materializing on your other side, leaning on your shoulder all cool as a cucumber
\>"Oh-ho, laying the charm on the Cham today, are we? You better watch it, pard, or you're gonna have to chase me down for that ancient potion you always keep in your back pocket, allll the way to some private, secluded little spot in the forest..."
\>"How about you try lifting it off me now? I'll even give you a head start. C'mon, you know you want to."
\>she glances at you for a moment before another sly grin spreads across her face, and she vanishes from sight again
\>a moment passes before she suddenly re-materializes in front of you again, looking amused yet none-too-pleased regardless
\>"Anti-theft?! Really?!"
\>"Thought you'd like a challenge for once."
\>that damned smirk comes back again, along with that crazed, feverish glint in her big rotating eyes that you know means it's go time for her
\>"Ohhh, I get it. Playing hard to get, are we? You better hope that ancient potion's the ONLY thing I steal before the day's done."


>\>Cham wife can't ever stop being quirky and trying to pull pranks all the time, even during intimate moments
>That sounds horrifying but also kinda fun in a weird way.

\>come home after a long day of hunting only to get soaked by the old bucket of water prank
\>you couldn't be mad at her since she was literally rolling on the floor laughing after seeing your face
\>help with making dinner, only to have every wooden spoon, pair of tongs, and hot pad zapped out of your hand by her tongue while she plays dumb with barely repressed snickering
\>getting a little annoying but you still manage to crack a smile and finish some well-done steaks for both of you
\>get lovey-dovey with each other during the candlelit dinner and decide to take it to the bedroom where your king-of-the-size bed awaits both of you
\>slip on a magnum condom for your magnum dong and get right to work, starting with a messy but oh so good tonguejob from your skilled wife before things get more passionate
\>no prank this time, thankfully - you still remember when she set off one of your sonic bombs right as you were about to blow and sent you tumbling right off the bed to thrash around like the monsters you'd used them on yourself
\>end the night with some wholesome cuddling within the tangle of her limbs as you both drift off
\>several weeks later
\>"Hey, anon, by the way, I'm gravid. Like, REALLY gravid. You knocked me up."
\>THAT sent you for a loop, and you manage to sputter out how the hell that happened since you were wearing protection
\>a truly massive grin spreads across her face and she hunches up with uproarious laughter
\>"HAH! GOTCHA! I stole your condom with that tonguejob and you didn't even notice! Now your going to be a dad! Isn't that HILARIOUS?!"
\>you're at an absolute loss for words
That Cham, what a lovable goof!

\>When the big day comes you're huddled together with your Cham wife in anticipation for the eggs to hatch
\>The first egg start cracking, with the other ones following soon after
\>Both of your faces light up in anticipation
\>The eggs all break in unison and...
\>There's nothing in them, except for very crude scribblings reading something you can barely recognize as "Gotcha!" in the inside of every eggshell
\>Your wife erupts in laughter
\>You stare in disbelief at the eggs, in the biggest mix of amusement, shock and disappointment in your life
\>The strong feeling along with the sounds of your wife laughing harder than you've ever heard make you ignore the sudden heaviness and ticklish feeling all over your body
\>All of a sudden, a small dangling tongue makes contact with your face and makes you snap out of it, making you notice the diminute Chameleos that's nested on the top of your head, along with all of it's siblings climbing all over your body
\>The feeling of shock and disappointment turns into one of happiness and relief as you see all of your children joyfully climbing all over you
\>...before turning into a feeling of pure dread once you realize you'll have to deal with the pranks from all of your children on top of having to deal with the ones from your wife.

###*Diablos*

=============================================

Within my wasteland, my sands disturbed.
from down below i have observed.
a tiny being, their lance drawn quick.
against my horns? is it a trick?
so i put forth a challenge declared.
for with my might, i'm never scared.
my hide is strong, my horns are sharp!
a curious spot their lance does park.
from behind my tail, my flesh exposed.
a dormant desire has arose...

###*Fatalis*

=============================================

`{Transformation}`
\>be a hunter
\>took on the toughest challenge of all and defeated fatalis, protecting everyone from devastation once again
\>get crowned a hero for it
\>but being famous doesn't pay the bills, so I still gotta take on requests from time to time
\>made some fancy armor out of the slain dragon's hide
\>it's really tough and allows me to easily take on risky high rank quests for big payouts (at this point everything feels like a low rank quest, but hunting never gets old)
\>get so used to the armor I start wearing it all the time 24/7
\>it's SUPER comfy for some reason
\>wake up one day and go to the gathering hub to see what's on the menu for quests
\>get some really weird looks from the villagers as I make my way to the hub
\>some palicos even screamed at my presence and ran away in terror for whatever reason
\>pay no attention to it and walk up to that cute hub lass working the stand
\>her face is buried behind some gigantic log book as I approach
\>"Hey, whatcha got for me today? Anything spicy?"
\>she looks up and meets my gaze only for her jaw to drop
\>"What? Is it my breath or something?"
\>she quivers for a moment before shrieking her head off and running into the back room
\>"What's her problem?" I ask to the arena lass who was right beside her spot
\>"Y-Y-Y-You..." she mutters
\>"Come on, spit it out!"
\>the arena lass closes her eyes and takes a deep breath before calmly saying: "Have you looked in a mirror recently?"
\>"No, why do you ask? Is there something on my face?"
\>"Lets say it has less to do with 'on your face' and more 'is your face'"
\>she hurries into the back room only to return with a simple hand mirror
\>I bring it up to my face only to see the vicious dragon fatalis staring back at me
\>"What is this? Some kind of joke—"
\>notice the dragon's face syncing up with my mouth movements
\>finally make the connection
\>"Huh, that's odd. Anyways, you got any quests for me?"

=============================================

>[this is my box, mine! no dumb smelly hunters allowed.](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1522/55/1522557349420.png)
>>\>ywn take the box and use the cardboard from it and many other boxes to built a to-scale replica of Castle Schrade for your tiny Fatty kid to claim as his own
>>\>ywn play rousing games of "hunt" with them, "challenging" them using mini-figures of hunters to "battle"

\>lil' Fatty loves their playtime in cardboard fort, its the best you've bonded in a long time
\>but during one play session they accidentally prick themselves on the finger with the sharp lance hunter toy
\>they get visibly upset and accidentally make a spark cloud with their flame breath
\>it wasnt enough to hurt anyone but the whole cardboard fort ignites almost instantly
\>being the proud parent of a elder dragon youngling means you're prepared for scenarios like this and you rush to douse the room with one of the many extinguishers that you placed close by
\>little fatty is obviously fine but is crying and sobbing about how sorry they are despite being covered in extinguisher foam and snot bubbles
\>its such an infrequent thing that you're able forgive it almost instantly and you find that its a perfect time to teach them a lesson on how to be more careful in the future
\>but now you're stuck building a new fort for them, and scrubbing the soot off the walls, and replacing the carpet, the extinguisher and some of the toys that got melted too..
\>you think to yourself that maybe its time to move the fort to the backyard from now on, and maybe make it out of something fireproof too...

###*Gore Magala*

=============================================

>\>"oh, a hunter is nearby, i should say Hello"
>\>HoLd ThEm dOwN! MaTe ThEm! bReeD ThEm!
>\>"n-no! i just wanted to be f-friends with *pant* them! i-i have to stay in control!"
>\>BrEEd! MaTe! MaKe EgGs!!
>\>"hold it together! m-must stay i-in control!"
>\>oh, its a Gore, hi Gore, how're you today?
>\>"O-oh, Sorry H-Hunter! something just came up! GOTTAGOBYE!
>\>"poor girl, they seemed a bit agitated than usual, i hope they're alright.." 
>>Haha surely no one would inadvertently do stuff that keeps making her think of breeding and subsequently makes it harder and harder for her to resist jumping their bones 
>>>\>It was getting harder and harder to contain her urges in front of her crush
>>>\>The socks weren't cutting it anymore
>>>\>No matter how many times she wore it over her horns and sniffed his used underwear it just kept getting stronger
>>>\>Her voice kept telling her to blast him with the most potent amount of the horni virus
>>>\>Visions of him drenched in her spores as his sensitive cock twitches in the air
>>>\>"A-Ah Gore-chan! P-Please make it stop!"
>>>\>She now gets periodic nosebleeds

\>you've noticed that Gore has been acting very strange when you're around, stranger than usual and that's saying a bunch for someone of their species.
\>frequent twitching, heavy breathing, tiny flecks of dried blood on their snout
\>"Gore are you sure you're not sick? you've been acting strange lately and I'm getting worried."
\>"I'm F-Fine Hunter *pant* Really..i am."
\>"Gore you're a terrible liar. come here, let me check and make sure you don't have a fever or anything"
\>W-wait Hunter! Don't!"
\>you remove one of your gloves and place your exposed hand over Gore's forehead, their smooth scales feel pleasantly warm to the touch
\>but as you stand there, rubbing Gore on their head you notice their horns spring up, their legs shaking, their mouth drooling.
\>"m-maybe i am sick.." they mutter
\>"Gore?"
\>their large wing claws unfurl, exposing the jet black scales underneath, small flakes of darkness falling off with their constant shaking
\>before you know it you can feel them on you, large wing claws big enough to crush boulders have taken your whole arm in each claw, their overwhelming strength pinning you against the ground
\>"Y-yes, I'm very sick" they mutter again
\>putting a foreclaw on your chest they bring their head in close to yours, horns fully engorged and glowing, strands of drool leaking from a mouth full of sharp teeth
\>"I'm sick of this distance between us..."
\>with their other claw they clumsily undo the straps on your helmet
\>"I'm sick of always having to hide how i really feel"
\>as your helmet slides off you take a sharp inhale, doing your best to hold your breath against the rapidly expanding frenzy clouds
\>"I'm sick of being lonely when you're not around..." they rub their head scales alongside the bare skin of your neck and cheek, their voice trembling
\>"i know.." you cough out. "Trust me Gore, i know exactly how you feel"
\>they pull back their head, and their horns snap down, immediately coming to the realization of what they are doing
\>"I just wanted to be with someone that trusts me as much as you do.." they say as they pull their weight off you, releasing your arms from their clawgrasp
\>you immediately reach into your pouch and shove a handful of nullberries in your mouth, chewing and swallowing them as fast as you can
\>Gore's large wingclaws begin to fold in, gently resting their claws on their shoulders
\>they back away slowly and sit down on their hind legs, head hanging low
\>"I'm sick of being treated as a walking disaster.." their tone sounding like their on the edge of crying
\>"you're the only one who has been able to stay near me, no matter how many times I've given you my frenzy"
\>you get up and dust yourself off, as you move towards Gore they turn their head away from you
\>"i know it cant be easy Gore, I'm not going to pretend like what your going through is easy either" you say as you once again place your hand on their head, gently turning it towards you
\>you make a rubbing motion on the top of their head while your other rubs their jaw underneath
\>"but I'll always be here for you no matter what, frenzy and all". you place your forehead against theirs, you can feel the air finally start to clear up
\>"i just don't want to be a menace to you too" they say, slowly pulling their head back
\>"Gore, you never were, and you never will be" you say, cleaning off some of the drool from their mouth
\>"now lets get you cleaned up, you're a mess.."
\>"yeah, sorry again for losing myself like that." they say, shaking off the last of their loose scales
\>"its fine, as least we got a chance to clear the air"
\>Gore gives you a soft punch in the arm with one of their wingclaws
\>"yeah, thanks for that. I'm glad i just got to tell you how i really feel"
\>"okay but next time, try not to cover the whole forest in frenzy clouds again, okay?"
\>"okay" they say "I'll do my best, for us."

=============================================

\>the guild guide to monster mating recommends extra care when laying with Gore Magala
\>not because of the risk of Frenzy infection but because when a Gore's Scales are spread and they're in their "Sensing mode" they become hyper sensitive to all forms of stimuli, this means that things like differences in temperature and scent locating are greatly magnified to them, which can easily lead to cases of over-stimulation 
\>however there are ways to help alleviate this as dictated in the next few pages, the guide recommends starting with gentle caressing at the head first, letting the Gore Magala get a clear picture and outline of you through their sensing scales will help them relax, beware that you should not grip the pulsing tips of the horns as this can lead to temporary sensory shock and paralysis, instead its recommended to gently massage the base of the horn while remaining in clear view, this combined with light pecs on the maw will signal that you're willing to mate with them.
\>another area worth noting is the giant wing claws, which are actually more sensitive than they look, especially around the clawpads, its recommended that you guide their claws around you so they can explore your body and get a sense for your size, tapping on the base of the claws can also signal to them that its okay for them to handle you.
\>lastly we can move onto the lower midsection, make sure to slowly rub your hands alongside your monster partners chest and hips so they know that its time to mate, let them take a comfortable position first and then after one lack approval check begin massaging their slit in a steady back and fourth motion. continue massaging until their sex organ starts to expose itself or the slit has become sufficiently moistened, you may begin insertion at this point. repeat thrusting at either end until climax.

###*Wind Serpent Ibushi*

=============================================

>\>[Ibushi's face after you explain what a metaphor is, and that you don't actually want to 'succ him to death'](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1646/04/1646047099623.png)
>You can almost see the excited fireworks going off in his head when he realizes that he gets to keep having sex without getting eaten after the first time.

\>"Y-y-you mean it, Anon? You won't eat me??"
\>"Wait, t-then, that means...we can have sex more than once?!"
\>"Oh g-gosh, then, can...can we have sex twice? Or even...three times?"
\>"AS MANY TIMES AS I WANT?!"
\>*Ibushi has fainted. Monetary reward decreased by 2000z.*
\>he starts back up right where he left off when he finally comes to
\>"And, and, maybe we can try...holding claws during it?"
\>"Oh, am I really blushing? I'm sorry, I've just never felt like this before. I thought I'd only get to shoot my shot once and that'd be it..."
\>"Y-yeah, I'd actually really like to go again. You're really serious about not eating me, yeah?"
\>"Then, one more thing...can I...maybe be on top this time?"

###*Izuchi*

=============================================

\>Dear Guildmaster

\>I'm interrupting my field work to write this letter to express my displeasure at the recent decision to hold a poll to decide the "most suckable monster cock"
\>Last I checked we are an institution dedicated to the research of monsters, not a den of degenerate zoophiles
\>However, I am understanding of the reality of the lives of the Hunters and Field Researchers who spend much of their lives alone in the wild, who might begin to feel a kinship with these creatures and perhaps even share a tender, taboo moment with them
\>This is why I decided to participate as an intellectual exercise, but your decision to reject my nomination of the Izuchi was outrageous
\>Izuchi are lovely creatures
\>Attractive to the eye, and possessed of a lively and boisterous spirit that is almost infectious
\>While they may often attack Hunters on sight, their friendship is easily earned with food and petting
\>Their penises are of a manageable size, providing their partner a mouthful while not intruding upon the throat
\>They are social creatures, meaning that they may be easily coaxed into reciprocation
\>Their bodies are covered in a delightfully soft layer of downy fluff for one to bury their nose in while hilting, and the constant preening and cleaning they do to each other and receive from their alpha Great Izuchi means that the odor is pleasant while doing so
\>But you've discarded all of my logical points in favor of nominations for beasts such as Rathalos, or Glavenus, or Gore Magala
\>I don't know what's supposed to be "suckable" about a penis that's the size of your leg, but if this poll is to take place in a fantasy land where we can all unhinge our jaws, so be it
\>Yet, you rejected my updated nomination of Mizutsune because, quote, "it'd probably taste like fish"
\>When I return from my current field study, I'll be transferring to another Guild Hall, where I won't have to tolerate this nonsense any longer

\>Sincerely, Exasperated Field Researcher 

=============================================

\>out on a expedition to the shrine ruins
\>notice a lone Izuchi out in the field 
\>walk over and just pick them up
\>after some confused wiggles trying to escape your grasp they settle down
\>while calmed down you pet them and gently brush their fur
\>during all this they still occasionally call out to their Great Izuchi
\>after minutes of holding and petting you gently put the Izuchi back on the ground only for their Alpha to finally arrive 
\>Great Izuchi runs into you knocking you to the ground
\>he then lies next gently bumping his head into you clearly wanting his turn
\>While giving the Great Izuchi the attention he demands he rest his head on your lap
\>you're not leaving until the Alpha says so

###*Jaggi/Jaggia*

=============================================

\>accidentally get injured while traveling through a forest locale
\>not a hunter so you don't have felyne cart insurance
\>get rescued instead by a tribe of wild Jaggia hybrids
\>barely a sentence's worth of spoken word between them but they seem nice enough
\>bring you poorly cooked meat (they preferred it raw but knew you couldn't eat it like that), water, and regular applications of healing herbs each day while you rest and heal
\>sleep around you in a big, comfy, pillowy pile at night - nothing really sexual going on, but as they were all nude 24/7 apart from some simple accessories, the first few nights embarrassingly gave you some boners that you had to hide
\>not to mention several of them had competed over having the spots right up next to you, so you were often in physical contact with their naughty bits as they cuddled up to you
\>along those lines, they were all fascinated by you and the strange (to them) things you had one your person, one particularly so
\>she surprised you with some rough but clear enough spoken words
\>she'd apparently been studying some abandoned hunter literature, wanted to learn the language enough so that one day she could leave and visit other places, see the world
\>she asks you to teach her some vocab as you continue to heal
\>takes a while since you're no teacher, but eventually she starts to get the hang of it
\>looks a bit sad one day, says that she doesn't want to see you go since you're almost healed
\>lights up when you ask if she wants to come with and nods eagerly, her long leathery ears flopping humorously

---
###*Kirin*

=============================================

>The unanimous belief is that Elder Dragons cannot be captured. So, how would you make the impossible possible?

Firstly, you'd want to do away with all the usual trappings of trapping, as no Elder Dragon would acquiesce to such a thing.
Next, you'd want to be sure whatever method you employ gives the Elder Dragon the respect it deserves, as they're able to recognize and appreciate such a thing.
Lastly, every Elder Dragon is rather unique, so the exact method would ideally be suited to the specific Elder Dragon.

For instance, consider the Kirin (which is my personal favorite). Kirin is peaceful by nature, and appreciates having room to roam.
Lay down your weapons and present yourself in a way that shows you mean no harm, which the peaceful Kirin will appreciate. Establish the Kirin's trust, and gently guide it to where you would like to lead it rather than trying to force or constrain it. Make sure the Kirin is given a shelter with elevation above the surrounding terrain; if it's willing to sleep in the shelter you have prepared you'll know you've done it properly. Either give it plenty of room to roam as it likes, or be prepared for it to roam into the surrounding wilderness whenever it needs to.
As you can see, the "capture" of a Kirin hardly involves actual capturing as such, and keeping it somewhere specific is more about preparing the area than controlling the creature. The same would be true for any other Elder Dragon, since they can't be contained in the same ways as other monsters.

---
###*Kulve Taroth*

=============================================

>How the heck does anything get done at this office? 
>>Kulve, the CEO, is very successful at keeping the company afloat with her seemingly endless pockets. They can handle these dips in productivity every once in a while.
>>The real threat is from their deviant acts getting leaked one way or another. Kulve had one too many incidents in the past, she can't afford another scandal.

\>Kulve turns heads wherever she goes because of the extremely revealing bikinis that she insists on wearing to work 
\>often goes without anything else because she's extremely vain about her youthful appearance despite her age, and (dubiously) claims that the natural gold plating on her body often acts as clothing in of itself (plus she's the boss, who's going to stop her?)
\>rich enough to afford an entire harem of manservants who attend to her every need and follow her around like a pack of leashed palamutes
\>she's also tall for an anthro monster, tall enough that she practically towers over the other elder dragons that are supposedly "equal" to her on the scale, lending her a significant air of superiority
\>rumor has it that she also has an extremely skilled Safi boytoy, the best money can buy, on speed dial who attends to her every OTHER need
\>that doesn't stop her from taking what she wants if she likes what she sees - many a new hire has inadvertently caught her eye and ended up eventually joining the manservants
\>basically the queen - in every sense of the word - of her own little kingdom
I'd work for her. Would you?

=============================================

>I love this monster office worker setting~

\>Fifth fleet company is a subsidiary to the First fleet company
\>They are normally a small operation instituted in the 10th floor of the New World building
\>The Relationship Commision Conglomerate (formerly Research Commision) services monster human relationships with advice and guidelines from their experts
\>Affiliate company /trash/ fleet would handle NSFW stuff passed on them from their parent company
\>The rest of the other fleets lived in relative harmony and nothing interesting happened since their establishment
\>Until a certain wealthy dragoness bought all the floors upwards of the fifth fleet floor and established a business there
\>Goldhorn Inc. is one of the few companies that would have majority of their employment be monsters
\>Not much is known what type of service they offer
\>Other fleets would encounter Goldhorn staff trying to flirt or seduce their interns and employees 
\>Many monsters attempted to force themselves on the employees
\>Key word attempted since the Fifth fleet acts a barrier between them and the other fleets in the floors
\>They are the newest branch which most comprises of security staff and no-nonsense ex-hunters that could handle their monstrous neighbors
\>There has been a rumor going around that the entire business is just a front for the CEO of Goldhorn just to spy on the assistant manager of the First Fleet
\>Evidence of this the mountains of secret cameras found on his office that he wasn't aware of
\>And every time he clocks out, she coincidentally leaves with him to 'accidentally' bump into him
 
=============================================

Going on a dance date with a cute, sweet, gorgeous Kulve hybrid!
Only remembering once you get there that she's incredibly tall due to being half Kulve and you only reach up to her bosom in height!
Hearing her chuckle when you bring this up to her!
Being swept onto the dance floor by her anyways!
Embarrassingly having your face smooshed between her scaly sweater puppies during a slow, romantic song!
Feeling your face heat up both from embarrassment and from her hot body temperature!
Having it not even matter that you have two left feet since you're barely even standing on your tiptoes in this position!
Finally being allowed to get some air when the song ends!
Gasping for breath as you wipe the sweat off your face!
Realizing you left a big sweat stain on her dress!
Apologizing profusely until she laughs again and tells you you'll be doing a lot more of it after the date!
Realizing you're already way past first base and quickly heading straight for the home run!

###*Kushala Daora*

=============================================

>I wonder what fucking a freshly molted Kushala would be like?
>>\>Feels like the softest thing in existence
>>\>Her muscled thighs trapping you in-between as you squeeze her calves 
>>\>Feels like jello that sinks between your fingers in contrast to her usual stiff scales as a whole
>>\>Not having to worry to get crushed between iron walls when all you feel is her squishy, vulnerable flesh

\>her molting doesn't happen often, but the two of you always look forward to it eagerly
\>when it does finally happen, all bets are off the moment she steps out of her now-scrapmetal hide
\>the two of you fuck like absolute rabbits in the short window you have before her scales harden into their usual metallic sheen
\>her entire body is like a shapely fleshlight, all for you to pleasure yourself with, and she eagerly obliges your every desire
\>her own sensitivity is heightened to astronomical levels during this as well, and it's a simple matter for you to get her rocking and soaked through multiple orgasms of her own
\>it's easily some of the most intense and pleasurable sex the two of you have due to her unusually soft plushness
\>and after you're totally spent, she spends the rest of it gently kneading and massaging you between her thick, pillowy, slowly firming haunches

\>"Oh Gog, Anon, why didn't you tell me these sheets felt so good?!" your freshly molted Kushala wife exclaims, twisting and thrashing her "nude" form around on your gold-crown size bed
\>"Freshly washed and warm out of the dryer, just for you, babe."
\>"Oh...ohhhh...oh they feel so good...! I think...I think I'm gonna...gonna...aaaAAAAAHHHH!"
\>she stops thrashing, the entire bed suddenly vibrating along with her shuddering bulk as she blows like a fire hydrant and soaks everything south of her nethers with elder femcum
\>"Hah...hah...holy shit..."
\>"Yeah, I've never seen you blow that hard just from bedsheets. That good, huh?"
\>her response is to grab you with a remarkable soft claw and yank you towards her
\>"Fuck...me...NOW!" she gasps out, drool flecking from her maw and a desperate, feral look in her eye
\>you grin and quickly swipe your hand along the inside of her flank with a vigorous petting motion
\>"What are you...AHH! AHHHHHHHHH!"
\>she near-instantly explodes again, ensuring that the both sheets you just washed and the mattress are thoroughly soaked through and ruined now
\>"Not just yet, I wanna see how far we can go with this..." you smugly retort to her twitching, panting, half-delirious form, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she fights to stay conscious
\>if only "capturing" monsters during work was this easy

\>"Oh, Gog, fuck me that was amazing..." she moans out, slowly coming back to reality from being rocked into a comatose state by an orgasm equivalent to the pleasure felt by 1000 successful No Nut Novemberers on December 1st
\>"Babe, w-what are you doing?" she asks watching as you pull some kind of strange looking Gunlance with a rounded tip from the closet
\>you smirk with raunchy excitement, starting the motor inside and feeling the whole thing buzz in your hands, the boys at the Smithy called it a "Vibra-lance"
\>"What is thaaaaAAAAAAAAAHH!!?" she cums nearly instantaneously from just a touch, doubling over in ecstacy and ensuring your sheets will need a thorough washing

###*Lagiacrus*

=============================================

**`{Vore}`**

\>(You), new hunter in Moga, accept the quest to deliver some Monster Guts to the village.
\>"Guts: It's What's for Dinner", ha, funny name.
\>You reach Area 11 to kill your final Epioth.
\>A big roar startles you. You look back and see a large Lagiacrus.
\>Fuck, you are not ready for this! You try to swim for your life.
\>Lagiacrus goes straight to the dead Epioth and begins to eat it. 
\>You continue swimming, but you realize you are too far away from the shore.
\>Also too deep. And you forgot you had to get some air...
\>You start to drown and lose some health.
\>Lagiacrus notices your desperate movements.
\>It leaves the Epioth behind and now it is approaching you at full speed with its jaws open.
\>Fuck, you can't do anything, your stamina is also depleted.
\>In an instant it grabs you with its maw and starts swallowing you feet first.
\>You can't believe what's happening. You are going down its throat as you feel its tongue licking your entire body.
\>Suddenly you can't see anything, just darkness, as it closes its jaws and you slide down its neck.
\>It's a long way down, or... in. The powerful neck muscles massage your body as they work on you to take you deeper and deeper.
\>You fell unconscious as you enter what it appears to be the stomach.
\>...
\>You wake up.
\>You see light, slowly your vision clears and you see that you are inside what appears to be a cave.
\>Was it a dream? or are you dead? You check your body for injuries, but there aren't any.
\>You are clearly alive. But how?
\>When you look around, you notice a Lagiacrus curled up around you, sleeping.
\>Did... did it save you from drowning?
\>As you try to get up, the Lagiacrus grabs you with its claws and squeezes you against its body.
\>It looks like you'll have to stay a little more time with it.

>>\>starts fantasizing about herself and her favorite hunter in various roles in the story, like Meryl and Johnny

\>be a hunter
\>find yourself kidnapped and whisked away into some sort of platform near coral highlands
\>get greeted by a peashooter-obsessed Tzitzi and a sunglass wearing Paolumu
\>wear some sort of jumpsuit and harness gear that accentuate your ass and crotch

\>you'd think it would be tedious as hell but its a blessing in disguise compared to when SHE arrives
\>the Legiana who seems to be the boss of the place who would wear an eyepatch despite having two functional eyes
\>you'd know since she would adjust it sometimes when it starts tickling her eye
\>she would wander around the place, wearing a box on her head, talking to the two monsters, or just humming some sort of foreign music
\>most of all, she would suddenly tackle you to the ground and start sniffing your crotch and/or ass and then just leave
\>the latest one has her giving you slow sensual licks at your face
\>the other two are just as bad with the Tzitzi yaku kept hitting herself with the tiny bowguns she keeps showing off
\>Paolumu would lecture you in monster speak before tripping on her crutches and having her ass pointed at you a few seconds too long
\>you just want to go home and eat at grammeowster's

=============================================

\>"You realize you're well within my clutches in that position, don't you, hunter?"
\>"I could easily kill you if I wanted - even freeze you to my powerful body to ensure you never leave - but I'm choosing not to because I like you."
\>"Just keep in mind that you belong to me, and only me."
\>"No, no, don't look at your Palico, or those Wulgs watching us. Keep your eyes only on me..."

\>"Yes... That's right."
\>"Please your mistress. Give me a full clutch of eggs-"
\>*CLICK*
\>Legiana immediately looks up on who tf interrupted her night time fantasy and sees her sister at the door
\>"Sis! What the hell! Don't open the lights when I'm sleeping!"
\>"Uh-huh sure sleeping"
\>"Listen Legs, I've been trying to look for my homemade Hunter doll and I've looked everywhere but here."
\>"Maybe you didn't look hard enough...?"
\>Legiana adjusts her haunches over the incriminating evidence, hiding the stuffed legs below her.
\>"You're humping it aren't you"
\>"...No."
\>"Get off the bed"
\>"No"
\>"Get off the bed!"
\>"NOOO!!!"
\>"GET OFF THE BED!!!"
\>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
\>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

=============================================

**`{Unbirth}`**

\>Climbing inside legi marks the first time you've been able to pleasure her without the need for earplugs
\>the screaming still vibrates through her insides, becoming a useful indicator of where to rub for the best reaction
\>her heartbeat also becomes apparent, going from a pulse every several seconds to quickly matching pace with an average human
\>not close enough to the lungs to feel breathing, the gaps between vibrations still betray breaths turning to staggered gasps as you grind harder against the flexing walls
\>finally a brief loss of gravity, followed by a THUD signals her legs giving out
\>flesh curves as her back arches involuntarily, sudden pressure from all sides pushing you further in
\>the pleasant coolness near her entrance is soon replaced by heat that could have come from a Lunastra strolling in the volcanic belt
\>you come to a squishy stop but the muscle contractions keep going, letting you enjoy a full body massage and imagine how deep you are inside her now
\>spend the next several minutes with your lips pressed against her thrumming cervix, face occasionally sprayed by the heavy fluids from further in
\>The squeezing around you relaxes, giving a chance to push backward through the heated canal, and allowing a little much needed air ingress around the edges

\>albeit slowly enough that you just know she's dragging it out as long as possible

\>she's on her side now, allowing the chance for a long, slow kiss with the drooling opening of her tailbase 
\>a large splatter is still warm and dripping on the stone behind her, more satisfying than any Quest Complete stamp

###*Magnamalo*

=============================================

If I were to marry a monster, I'd unquestionably marry the latest and greatest flagship of Rise, Magnamalo! Their hunting prowess would be ideal for hunters looking for an equal partner, or even those who prefer to sit back and let their other half take charge! Their firm, scaled hide is deceptively smooth, so you'd never scratch yourself on them, and thanks to its sensitivity, you could bring simple pleasures to your partner and strengthen your relationship through the human act of "petting!" But that's not all! Did you also know that thanks to their immense internal heat, you'd never experience a cold night again when cuddled up with one? Trips to the Frost Islands have never been cozier!

\>But person, look at them! They're scary-looking! I'm afraid to go near one!

I assure you, despite Magnamalo's fierce outward appearance, they're actually quite welcoming towards visitors! Unless you're attempting to claim their territory, you have nothing to fear! In fact, they'd happily protect YOU once you got friendly enough with them! There's no doubt in my mind that I– Magnamalo is the perfect mate for anyone looking for interspecies romance! And in a stroke of convenient timing, I've even heard that one is residing in the Shrine Ruins at this very moment! Perhaps some lucky human should visit me– them!

###*Malzeno*

=============================================

>\>"So, your handler is also a Malzeno? Mine too. Do they ever... go out at night for an extended period of time?"
>\>"Yep. Probably something to do with their monster genes. I'm surprised they even allow them in the guild to begin with—"
>\>"Do they always go out at around 9:30pm?"
>\>"Yes..."
>\>"Hmm, then my suspicions are true. I think all the malzeno hybrids are congregating at night somewhere. But what they're up to I have no clue."

\>in typical fashion, shortly after Malzeno was discovered, it wasn't long before Malzeno hybrids started appearing in hunter society thanks to the efforts of the /trash/ fleet hunters
\>some people begin to notice some strange going-ons since their appearance, though, like the hybrids all leaving their homes at the exact same time every night to go somewhere, or the strange surge of Rathalos-related capture quests and their increasingly specific objectives (such as restraining them with shibari-style bindings)
\>a reporter for the Daily Hunt, alongside their trusty monstie partner, decides to dig into the mystery and makes a shocking discovery
\>it turns out that the hybrids shared their feral parents' overwhelming love for Rathaloses and were all conspiring together by pooling time, resources, and zenny to put up tons a fake capture quests for the Kings of the Sky
\>having caught so many by now for their own personal uses, the ecosystem was getting thrown out of wack - Rathians everywhere unable to find mates and taking out their frustrations on unsuspecting hunters instead
\>with the aid of law enforcement, the reporter and their monstie track them to their hideout and burst through the door to a startling sight
\>dozens upon dozens of Raths tied up in various positions, some used for pleasure, some BEING pleasured, many, many more being milked of their talon poison
\>a vicious melee ensues, the Malzeno hybrids defending their turf, the air filled with clouds of Qurios and frantic Raths that managed to get loose in the chaos
\>but when the dust settles, many end up being led out in wirebug zipties, the dozens of Rathaloses wrapped in blankets and being soothed by professional caretakers

=============================================

\>Be Hunter, chasing down the Anjanath that you've been tasked with capturing along with the others in your party
\>Something crashes into the ground in the middle of the group
\>Your heart drops
\>Malzeno
\>None of you are equipped to take on an Elder Dragon
\>The beast locks his gaze onto you
\>Shit
\>You try to run, but he's blindingly fast
\>You're knocked to the ground before the dragon suddenly scoops you up in his claws and brings you close to his body, wrapping his wings around the both of you for privacy
\>Your attempts to struggle are ignored completely as he turns you upside down and spreads your legs
\>He lifts you to his lips, and his long, ribbed and ridged tongue snakes out of his maw and slithers between your skin and your underwear to enter your body
\>The dragon purrs as he begins to savor the flavors he discovers within you
\>Jaggi
\>Jagras
\>Kelbi
\>Remobra
\>He shudders as his taste buds detect Kulu-ya-ku
\>A weakling to be sure, but still a "large" monster
\>As his tongue hits the deepest point it can reach inside of you, he enjoys one last unique taste
\>Palamute
\>A common flavor to find in Hunters these days
\>He gingerly withdraws his tongue from your body before spreading his wings and dropping you to the ground
\>The Malzeno launches into the sky as your party members rush in to check on you
\>They're surprised to find you completely unharmed, and try to ask what happened
\>You answer as vaguely as possible, and thankfully they're willing to drop the subject
\>The warmth that had previously suffused your insides is gone, replaced with the coolness of Malzeno's saliva
\>You can't help but blush a bit as you tell your comrades that you'll need to go off on your own again to "gather resources"

\>Be Malzeno
\>You spot a group of your favorite creatures galavanting through the citadel
\>Humans
\>You lick your chops in anticipation as you swoop in
\>They shout and circle about, frightened by your sudden appearance
\>You lock your gaze onto the smallest, most submissive-looking one, and charge
\>Effortlessly swiping their weapon aside, you scoop them up and wrap your wings around them, stroking them gently with your claws before spreading their legs
\>You shudder with anticipation as you dip your muzzle down and slide your tongue into their monster-hole eager to savor the-
\>The moment the taste of the seed spreads across your tongue, you freeze
\>It's no monster seed
\>It's human
\>How foul, how utterly revolting
\>You immediately drop the human to the ground and fly off, heading straight for the nearest stream to wash your mouth out 

=============================================

\>Be Hunter, out with your party in the wastes
\>Somebody calls out
\>"I-it's Malzeno..."
\>Your stomach turns as you whip your head in the direction they're pointing
\>...
\>Yeah, that's Malzeno
\>He's slowly approaching your group
\>Not, like, menacingly
\>Just slowly
\>His body language and expression are very calm
\>It's unnerving how peaceful he looks
\>He keeps coming closer
\>You all take a step back, looking back and forth between each other
\>What do you do?
\>Before you know it, he's right in the middle of the group
\>His demeanor is so bizarrely calm that it's practically stunned you all
\>His eyes pass slowly over everyone in the group
\>He stops briefly to give you in particular a respectful little nod before his gaze resumes its journey
\>Finally, his eyes land on the Hunting Horn user
\>And then he starts moving again
\>The HH Hunter backpedals and panics
\>"G-guys? What's happening!? What do I do?"
\>He's so confused that the idea of swinging his weapon never occurs to him
\>To be fair, none of the rest of you are attacking either
\>The HH user is backed into a corner
\>The Malzeno dips his head down, gently grabs him around the waist with his mouth, and lifts him into the air
\>Then, he turns around and walks away
\>"GUYS WHAT'S HAPPENING!? GUYS!? HELP!"
\>His panicked voice grows fainter as the Malzeno slowly saunters off, shrinking into the distance before turning a corner and disappearing entirely
\>None of the rest of you have moved an inch
\>"... uh, we should probably follow them...?"
\>"Maybe we should contact the guild first...?" 

>Malzeno is just looking to create the perfect evening meal ambiance. Being enslaved to play every day for an indefinite period of time might be a bit of a buzzkill though.

\>it's been several days since your "employment" (capture) by Malzeno
\>upon seeing you and your hunting horn, you were taken by the elder dragon to provide a lovely musical ambience for the nightly evening meal of him and any guests he was entertaining at the time
\>when you weren't, you found yourself chained in his castle dungeon, told to keep quiet lest your blood find its way into his "wine" storage
\>but what Malzeno didn't know was that you were already hatching a plan for your escape, using a secret weapon taught to all hunting horn users on graduation day at the Wycademy for use as a last resort
\>when the next night rolls around, you're unchained and trotted out with your horn by a few of Malzeno's enthralled small monster minions, the host himself laughing jovially as he toasts to the health of the beautiful-yet-stern Velkhana sitting across from him
\>wait, that Velkhana was wearing glasses...surely it couldn't be...the famous monster romance novel author V. Ana?
\>you can barely suppress your glee - not only were you going to escape tonight, you were going to absolutely RUIN his reputation in the process
\>at his cue, you begin to play a lovely tune on your horn, enough to lull him into a false sense of security as he settles into a pleasant chat with V. Ana, both of them picking at their plates piled high with meat
\>it's time
\>praying he won't notice in time to stop you, you immediately switch notes mid-song to start buffing yourself
\>Movement Speed Up!
\>"...Hmm? I think your servant's instrument might be broken, Lord Malzeno."
\>Earplugs (L)!
\>"What? What on earth is that wretched tune, manservant?! Stop that immediately!"
\>it was now or never, thank gog you had brought your earplugs horn
\>taking a deep breath, you adjust your grip and unleash the hunting horn user's secret weapon, blowing the hardest, loudest, *deepest* note you can physically manage with your horn
\>Brown Note (XL) Extended!
\>you don't even hear the sound of Malzeno's and V. Ana's wine glasses shattering as they drop from their claws in shock, so focused you are on maintaining the note for as long and loud as you can
\>nor do you hear the horrible gurgling sound filling the room as their stomachs, including the stomachs of every one of Malzeno's minions in the chamber, proceed to flip themselves inside out
\>Malzeno was the first to react, immediately encapsulating himself in his wings and teleporting out of the room in a puff of reddish-black smoke
\>V. Ana was quick to follow, barely suppressing a groan as she immediately flew for the nearest door, her poorly balanced glasses falling from her snoot as both elder dragons raced for the bathrooms
\>giving your trusty horn a thankful pat, you quickly race over to the table where all the food was and start chowing down as fast as you can to restore your maximum stamina, that had been left at the bare minimum in order to prevent your escape
\>restored, you start running like a charging Tigrex was on your heels, hearing groaning and horrible messy noises throughout the castle, followed by lots of snarling and shrieking as the enthralling influence of Malzeno began to break on the small monster minions and added to the chaos
\>you swear you could even hear the cacophony echoing through the entire Citadel area as you escaped back to town, your hunter friends ecstatic at your surprisingly safe return
\>Malzeno was rarely seen in public after that, monsters laughing in his wake whenever he had to go out in public, and he avoided eye contact with you whenever the two of you saw each other
\>V. Ana's reputation took a far less egregious hit (thankfully, you felt kind of bad that she was caught in the crossfire), though her next novel did include a rather controversial scene with a hunting horn, though it was spun into an amusing incident that led to the protagonist meeting their true love

=============================================

\>Capcom releases a new event quest
\>You've got to hunt [a tiny Malzeno](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1661/74/1661740724484.jpg) to get tickets to make a hat that looks like a Malzeno holding onto your head
\>Sweet
\>You start the quest with a couple of friends and fill the empty spot with a random
\>The quest starts and you all jump down into the Arena
\>The random rushes forwards towards the monster
\>And... picks it up?
\>Somehow?
\>Then he just vanishes with it in his arms, and a message pops up letting you know that he abandoned the quest
\>What the fuck
\>The Malzeno is gone
\>You all just stand around waiting for a minute, but there's no monster to fight
\>So you all abandon and put up a new quest
\>You tell your strange story online, and many people chime in to say that the same guy did the same thing to them
\>Join their quest, pick up their tiny Malzeno, then abandon, taking it with him
\>"He's a menace"
\>"It's happened to me and all of my friends"
\>"He's got to have enough Smallzenos to make a Tallzeno by now"

=============================================

>How much longer do you think velk can handle malzeno being such a freeloader and living in her basement?
>>Clearly we should start a campaign to get Malzeno's castle back.
>>Not out of good will, mind, but so we can get him and his couch surfing out of our hair. 

\>Your impromptu powwow has gathered more monsters than expected, everyone positioned in a loose circle. Its occupants lay claim to wide swaths of land, some holding no relation to others, but here amongst the group of wyverns, leviathans, and lone person, one issue unites all.
\>"He insisted on sharing our hunting spoils. Fair enough, right? Well guess how many times he went out to hunt. Guess! ZERO. Not once!"
\>"…You know he can send his Qurio to gather nourishment for himself, right?"
\>"I… what?"
\>Any further bits of their exchange are promptly drowned out by the chatter of others eager to voice their grievances.
\>"Who stays at a nest for free and has the audacity to request a blood sample from their host? Oh right, he does!"
\>"My mate and I didn’t have a single minute of solitude when he was with us! I could feel those blood-red eyes staring at every nuzzle shared between us!"
\>"I woke up one night after feeling ticklish to find a Qurio nibbling on me! He said he didn’t order it to, but those blood-sucking freaks shouldn’t be allowed near anyone!"
\>"I can’t believe he didn’t stay with me. He didn’t even *visit* me! Why didn’t he visit? Why don’t YOU guys visit me?"
\>"Huh?... Wait, why are you here?! Go on, scram! Git!"
\>As you watch the dejected purple wyvern slink away, you can’t help but wonder what in Gog’s name is being said by the group of monsters all jabbering away.
\>No matter. In dire situations such as now, unity transcends language.

=============================================

[This](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1677/75/1677752190413.webm) reminds me of the time that I found out that not only was Malzeno a giant needy slut, but that he was also a giant CUDDLESLUT
\>get invited to Malzeno’s bi-monthly “super-masculine-and-totally-not-girly” tea party 
\>Tea party was actually super fruity and extremely homoerotic but don’t tell Malzeno I said that
\>at some point during tea time I see Malzeno wiggle his horns, and I think it’s super fucking cute
\>ask him if I can scratch behind his horns 
\>Malzeno being the masculine and honorable elder dragon he is, indulges my “silly” request.
\>Malzeno begins to let out a loud and throaty purr within less 5 seconds after my my fingers begin to scritch behind horn his horns 
\>after 20 seconds of sustained horn-scritches Malzeno practically goes limp
\>after 60 seconds of horn-scritches he cums
\>briefly think the tables are about to be turned on me when Malzeno’s tail wraps around my waist
\>instead of crushing me or flinging out of his lair however, Malzeno’s tail instead presses me against his ass (and puckering tail-hole)
\>Malzeno gives me puppy-dog eyes and practically BEGS me to fuck him. 
\>due to the size difference between us I initially think that there is no way that I’m going to be able to pleasure him this way, let alone have him even able to feel me, but I nonetheless oblige him
\>my concerns about me being to small to pleasure Malzeno are quickly dashed aside as Malzeno cums the instant I plunge my cock into his puckering hole.
\>the elder dragon is insatiable, and I fuck his tight mal-bussy for what feels like hours
\>learn a lot about Malzeno while we fuck as well 
\>for example, Malzeno LOVES to be called a “good boy” when getting railed 
\>he is also very fond of chin scratches, rubs/scritches on his underbelly, having his neck plumage stroked, and being booped.
\>eventually I have to leave and go back to hunter HQ, much to Malzeno’s dismay.
\>since then I have constructed my home on the outskirts of the village so Malzeno can visit me without being noticed when I am unable to visit him myself
\>comes by quite often, usually seeking a snuggle buddy for an a few hours
\>also find out that Malzeno can be VERY persistent in trying to get what he wants. 
\>whenever I decline to snuggle (or fuck) him due to work or just not being in the mood Malzeno will linger outside my home and scowl at me judgementally through my windows
\>Malzeno probably thinks he looks terrifying when does it but it’s actually super fucking cute, so I almost always eventually cave to his demands for snugs and fugs 
Fun fact: most monsters have very, VERY sensitive erogenous zones in the space behind or around their ears. I hope my fellow hunters put this information to good use, because gog knows how many times it’s saved my life

###*Mizutsune*

=============================================

>So how would it take until Mizutsune realizes that Chameleos is encroaching on his hunters/property
>>Mizu was HUNTed and captured a few days ago during his fashion stream, so maybe he'll catch on once they finally release him from the "research pen", crewed by all those young, strapping, oddly shirtless researchers...

\>Mmmmm...
\>To think getting captured was the greatest thing to happen to you
\>Granted having been pelted with tranquilizer mid-strip in front of the camera was a turn off but you liked how these cuties were handling you
\>"You can go a bit lower y'know~" you purr
\>The uounh researcher inspecting your hide cringed a bit but nevertheless continued on his research
\>Oh you love how these fresh folks seem to resist you
\>But you know he'll come around soon...
\>...
\>...Wait
\>You stand up as the researchers were startled by your sudden movement
\>*Sniff Sniff*
\>Some hunter is getting molested...
\>And its not your doing!
\>But it couldn't be
\>Female heat season isn't until 2 months
\>And you can't remember any males that you know (so far) that are interested in swinging that way
\>Let alone being interested in hunters
\>You made sure of that
\>Unless...
\>"That son of a BITCH!" you roar

=============================================

>Robotamas capture hunters and force them inside of their bodies so that they can use the hunters' orifices to mate with real tamas.

\>Be a Tama, just minding your business in the Shrine Ruins
\>That strange, artificial Mizutsune approaches you again
\>It runs its cool, metal body alongside yours and nips affectionately behind your frill
\>You ignore the thing, until it rolls over onto its back and presents itself to you
\>A glimpse of flesh between its legs intrigues you
\>The smooth skin of a Hunter, trapped somehow inside of this thing's belly
\>His cute, flaccid penis and quivering Hunter Hole are bared invitingly to the air
\>You dip the tip of your muzzle down and sniff
\>It sends a shiver down your spine
\>You recognize this scent
\>It's the Hunter who frequently prowls these parts
\>You had approached him with the intention to mate, but he attacked you instead
\>You swiftly sent him back to his village with his tail between his legs, but you've thought about him a few times since
\>Your tongue slithers out of your maw and into his hole, causing it to fruitlessly clench against your intrusion
\>He tastes wonderful
\>Your tongue writhes inside of his bowels, taking care to slather every nook and cranny with lubricating saliva, as well as bumping his prostate a few times for good measure
\>By the time you pull your tongue from his depths, his body is shaking, his cock is rock hard and oozing pre, and you can hear the muffled sounds of him whimpering and struggling inside the MechaTama's belly
\>You mount the machine, nuzzling it affectionately in thanks, but quickly turn your attention back towards the Hunter
\>Your penis dangles in front of his clenching, quivering sluthole
\>It's funny
\>When you had initially approached him, you fully intended to act as a "female" for him
\>But it's too late for that now
\>You firmly press the tip of your cock, nearly as large as his thigh, against his resistant pucker
\>The slightest press of your hips effortlessly begins to pry him open
\>His whines from inside the machine cause your cock to throb
\>He'll learn a very, very hard lesson about turning down a Mizutsune

=============================================

>\>female mizutsunes aren't as colorful as graceful as their male counterparts
>\>also they're buff as shit
>\>using their musculature to pin down males just to make sure their species live on
>\>males soapy characteristics emerged when they didn't want to have eggs with their fugly women
>\>allows them to slip away from their grabby arms

\>"Sir are you sure we should we even doing this?"
\>"We have no choice. Mizutsune population is dropping down at an alarming rate and its up to us hunters to balance the ecosystem."
\>In the middle of the arena is a Mitzutsune bound on his back with his limbs splayed out
\>The monster doesn't even panic at the situation and looks maybe even a bit eager
\>Judging by the way he looks at the observation post (you) every once in a while
\>"Alright! Send in the breeder!"
\>The arena gate opens and in comes in monster above
\>A towering female Mitzutsune that eclipses the tallest walls of the stadium
\>Surprising everyone, it stands on two of its muscular rear legs and lets out a mighty roar
\>The Mitzutsune, now sporting a fearful look tries for the first time to struggle against its bindings
\>The eyes of the female looks around the arena before it settles on the lone male in front of her
\>Her eyes dilate and her nostrils flare out
\>She slowly waddles over the male leviathan as it cries out for the hunters to stop her
\>Then without warning, she slams her hips down on to the poor monster
\>Every single male hunter on the sides wince as with each powerful drop her body lets out a sickening scream from the captured specimen
\>Finally after what felt like several hours, she stops
\>Letting out a pleasured roar in to the sky, she slowly picks up the male from the neck with her teeth
\>The sight gives you a look on the current status of the male mizutsune
\>With a mighty leap of her four legs, she blasts through the roof of the arena and dives on to the cliffside right next to the sea
\>"Welp! That was a mission success, let's hope those two end up making lots of babies for us to hunt." 
\>"Sir I don't think that male is gonna last long"
\>"What makes you think that?"
\>"Because knots aren't suppose to bend 90 degrees like that."

###*Nergigante*

=============================================

\>be new world hunter
\>make a weapon out of some nergigante materials
\>it's a good weapon, but doesn't really fit your style
\>ditch it for something else
\>iceborne drops— I mean, the Hoarfrost Reach is discovered
\>leave all your old gear behind and join the crew traveling to the new region
\>many days later you return back to Astera
\>go back to your old room to look for something
\>suddenly get jumped on by a tiny nergigante
\>then another
\>and another
\>suddenly pinned down to the floor by a horde of nergi babies
\>thankful that you were wearing your full armor set, else all the cuddly spikes might have harmed you too much
\>turns out each spike from that old nergigante weapon you made all somehow grew into actual nergigantes, who knew?

=============================================

>is it... right for them to be using weapons made from their monster counterparts?
>>I imagine that for the hybrids that actually tolerate wearing gear instead of hunting fully/partially in the nude like they usually do, their armor and weapons are likely made using sustainably gathered materials - usually materials that they can shed, trim off, or otherwise create themselves.
>>Probably a point of personal pride for them to use a weapon made from themself, too. Hybrid user that's half-hunter and half-monster, hybrid gear that follows the same idea. 

\>be nergigante hybrid (don't even ask how dad managed to bang mom in the first place and come out unscathed)
\>cursed with having to constantly trim your spikes that never stop growing
\>decide to turn your curse into a blessing and become a blacksmith selling weapons and armor made from your endless supply of hybrid materials
\>not as strong as a feral nergigante's materials, but definitely way strong than most other accessible monster parts
\>but alas, you can't escape the curse completely
\>the weapons made from your hybrid parts still retain their rapid regeneration for a while
\>you strictly advise hunters who buy your gear to constantly sharpen their weapons and bang them against monsters, polish their armor and take hits from time to time, etc.
\>else they risk the parts growing on their own and ruining the shape until sanded/hammered back into place
\>some of the more careless hunters who bought your gear only to put in into storage claim it all grew into baby nergigantes, but you ignore their claims and scrutinize them for not taking proper care of your gear
\>besides, none of the spikes you've left lying about ever turned into little nergigante copies
\>what a crazy accusation to make

###*Rathalos*

=============================================

An insect glaive to give the hunter flight
no mach is it for my fearsome bite
for as they fly and flail towards me
i swing and charge them vehemently
with traps and bombs they seek to stall
i roar and fly to avoid them all
now of i go to my nest to flee
for the hunter's scoutfly pursue of me
i tend my wounds and get some rest
for the hunter comes with newfound zest
and on my turf their scent does spread
for even me it invokes some dread
but much to even my surprise
a tenderness in the hunter's eyes
our fight was never to procure a win
the Hunter's aim was that of Kin

=============================================

\>Psst hey hunters
\>I need your help
\>I'm being stalked by Malzeno, that new monster coming to the neighborhood
\>Basically, ever since I agreed to be in the trailer for the MHR Sunbreak, he's been following me non-stop
\>To be fair, I should've quit the moment he pinched my haunches and said I 'taste good' when we first met
\>I was stupid back and then and thought it was just some cultural/instinct thing and it would stop
\>It didn't
\>Anyway, he would often stalk me and settle himself just outside me and my wife's nest and just look at me
\>Sometimes he would stretch and give me a bit of a show
\>Other times have him trying to deepthroat a tree branch or any long objects he could get his hands on
\>The only time he would stop or disappear is when Rathian brings home dinner for tonight
\>I tried talking to Zinogre about this since he was an expert and all he could say was: "Atleast yours doesn't fly"
\>I'm running out of time
\>My wife will be leaving for a for her monthly book club with her friends and I feel I am not safe
\>Hunt, capture, kill, just do ANYTHING to make him stop
\>I'll even give you my prized Rubies as compensation 

\>It's been 3 days since Rathalos posted his request on the quest board
\>He cautiously looks down from the nest and see accursed dragon has written something on the forest floor
\>'I'M GONNA STEAL YOUR JEWELS'
\>He thought at first he just wanted to his Rathalos Rubies and dropped them down
\>But that didn't stop the creepy stalking
\>Rathian won't be back for another week and won't be long until Malzeno realizes that he's alone for a long time.
\>He tried fashioning bushes and used ghillie mantles stolen from hunters to make a dummy Rathian
\>But he feels the elder dragon's starting to catch on when he pretended to make out with the dummy wyvern and the tail fell off

=============================================

>\>[Rathalos disguises himself](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1638/11/1638112818708.jpg) to hide from Malzeno.
>Lets just hope he doesn't find out about "Rathians Rubies"

\>Rathalos sweating bullets as Malzeno leers at them with contempt
\>"So he's not here then?"
"Yes."
\>The vampire dragon turns away to scowl before clearing his throat
\>"Very well then, would you tell me where he is then?"
"Uh... Last I checked my 'husband' told me he was going to take a dip in the Lava Caverns."
\>The interrogator's eyes glint at the prospect of him being in such a vulnerable state
\>He tries to hide his manic glee before composing himself
\>"I see, then I shall head off."
\>Malzeno didn't even let him say goodbye before taking off abruptly
\>'Rathian' sighs before collapsing in the nest, adjusting his seat so his balls could finally breathe
"Hopefully step two of my plan would give me a week at most to relax."

\>You are Azure Rathalos
\>And you're a bit pissed
\>Currently you're in some lava cave drenched in red paint
\>You knew your cousin would pull a sick joke like this
\>It's not your fault you're stronger than him that he gets jealous
"Haha yeah real funny! You proved your point."
\>Hopefully this is the type of paint that comes off easily with some water
\>Wait what's that noise?

\>[silverlos therapist](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1651/77/1651776929120.jpg) was offering a discount to guild members so I figured it was worth a shot
\>spent most of the first session asking me increasingly tangential questions about talons, fur and scale textures, monster scents, human anatomy etc
\>a whole shelf of the bookcase is collected works from V. Ana, presumably some well-known figure in the field
\>the following week starts out with a "trust exercise" which involves him holding my neck in his jaws
\>a question about tongue ridges quickly devolves into making out on the couch, "inspecting" fire glands and him explaining the taste and chemistry involved
\>khezu secretary walks in once and spits out a stack of lightly-chewed papers with scribbles on them, doesn't seem to notice anything happening
\>by that point he has me bent over the desk, we're still kissing passionately while he's rutting me and mumbling something about lagiacrus mating rituals
\>start getting scheduled for the last slot in the day, which seems necessary when the sessions are becoming multiple hours long and wrecking the room more each time 
\>it's been about two months now, we've probably been in every possible position on everything in his office, and also a couple in legi's office after she left for the day

\>they were so drunk they didn't notice the rathalos scrounging through their food (or didn't care)
\>then the rathalos got a taste of their cheap mead from a leaking keg
\>in the morning the hunters wake up to find all of their food devoured and mead gone by the rathalos snoozing away outside their tent
\>woefully underprepared to take on a rathalos (along with many splitting headaches), the hunters attempt to sneak away but comically fail
\>the rathalos, also afflicted with a nasty headache, wakes up but is too hungover to even care about the hunters and just lies there awake watching them squirm about
\>due to his passiveness, the hunters leave the rathalos alone while packing up their party camp, making jokes about befriending it through the power of alcohol
\>they even give it some water to drink before departing
\>unfortunately for the rathalos it got too much of a taste of their low-quality alcohol and now craves more
\>after a few attempts of raiding other camps for something to drink, the rathalos retreats back into the depths of the wilderness, sad that it may never taste the cheap nectar again
\>until one day it hears familiar sounds coming from a camp full of hunters throwing another party
\>upon inspection it's the same group of hunters with even more barrels full of mead
\>the rathalos swoops in and lets out a mighty roar before cracking open a keg with his powerful talons and chugging the whole thing
\>everyone cheers in response and the party continues throughout the night while the rathalos drinks away
\>they repeat this party for the next few months, always bringing plenty to drink for their rathalos friend
\>of course the more it drank the less active the rathalos became, leading to it getting very out of shape
\>now it barely flies anymore and made residence inside a cave where the parties are hosted

###*Rathian*

=============================================

>\>have a [rathian hybrid gf](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1643/09/1643092495873.png)
>\>but she drew the short end of the stick and still has gigantic wing arms instead of regular hands
>\>have to help her every morning put on her favorite shirt to wear for that day
>\>she still tries her best to do other tasks on her own like eating and helping around the house (even if she is a bit klutz)
>\>usually she'll make more messes throughout the day trying to clean up old ones
>\>but that's okay because it means more time spent with her

Imagine having a hybrid SO who was so far along on the "mutation scale" in this hypothetical society that they practically almost classify as a feral monster in their own right, minus some things like still having the ability to speak hunter languages, and still having some humanlike body features such as breasts and bellybuttons.
\>larger than normal size - not to the degree of a feral monster, but still making it difficult to fit through the doors of most homes/shops
\>hunched over stance - again, not quite to the degree of a feral monster, but very noticeable nonetheless
\>large wing arms in place of regular hands, making fine motor skills difficult without resorting to their talons but allowing for a better degree of flight in return
\>while the large majority of hybrids still possess talons like their feral cousins, these particular individuals tend to have much larger ones in accordance with their increased overall size, making shoe-shopping difficult
\>tougher, scalier hide that covers more of their body in place of softer skin
\>elemental/status producing glands being a full strength, instead of reduced potency like with most other hybrids
People would probably keep mistaking them for a monster, only to be surprised when they answer back with completely normal talking.

\>ywn flip that veil up after the vows are made, your ring is place on her claw by you, and the fresh kill from her traditional hunt that morning (still wafting miasma) is given to you from her, revealing her beautiful double-jawed smile as she beams at you and waits for her kiss
\>everyone claps and/or roars applicably, the commotion kicking up a ton of effluvium and causing the celebration to devolve into a lot of coughing and wheezing
\>at the reception, the Meowscular Chef and his crew are catering with gas masks on, and the wedding cake has to be kept in a special container to keep it from getting contaminated
\>a lot of the monsters end up having to go home early due to "not feeling so well", a possibility you were well informed on given your wife's..."influence" on the surrounding area

\>one hand caressing the vents on their chest, the other moving deeper towards their slit
\>"Are you sure you're up for it?"
\>they nod as best they can and make a muffled confirmation
\>you press your torso onto their back, being careful not to put much force behind them.
\>you can feel their wing thrusters starting to rev up as you explore their body, the intakes on their chest drawing in more and more air.
\>you remove your hand from their chest vents and gently push on their head, forcing the dildo deeper into their maw, you can visibly see their throat bulge from the depth.
\>"Let me know if you need a break"
\>their tail begins to wag back and fourth, wings twitching, their moaning increasing in frequency
\>you can feel the heat coming off their body, your hand is still deep within their slit, massaging it more and more the deeper they go.
\>"you're almost there, you can do it.." you whisper in their ear
\>with one last inhale of air they take the dildo all the way to the base and you can hear their beak make contact with the wall
\>"GULK"
\>you can feel your hands becoming drenched in their fluids as they writhe and cum from the ordeal.
\>they slowly pull themselves off the wall, the dildo bulge in their throat slowly making its way out with a wet pop.
\>you let them lean against you as they fall back and cough, trying to catch their breath.
\>you can see that their slit is still dripping, their vents still glowing red
\>"Ready for round two?" you ask.
\>still panting they give you a thumbs up and you give them a gentle kiss on the cheek.

=============================================

\>Take on an investigation about strange blast marks and fires causing trouble in the forest.
\>All signs point to it being caused by a feral valstrax.
\>After enough snooping around you almost bump into her.
\>A lone valstrax hybrid. You wonder what she's doing all by her lonesome out here.
\>All the blast marks are from her practicing how to fly as you watch her attempt another takeoff only to fail miserably.
\>Observe her from a distance for a while trying to figure out what her story is.
\>How does she not know how to fly at this age? Perhaps she lost her parents growing up and had to live by herself.
\>Her skittish nature and the lack of proper clothing back up that theory somewhat.
\>As you get lost in your thoughts you lose track of her only to hear rustling behind you.
\>Turn around to see the hybrid staring straight at you while hiding behind a tree.
\>"H-Hey," you mutter only to spook her a little. "Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you."
\>You reach out your hand and she slowly creeps over to you, only to grab your hand and examine it carefully. Perhaps this is her very first time encountering something that wasn't a monster.
\>After being satisfied with examining your form the lone hybrid hugs you and doesn't let go.
\>You attempt to break free of her grasp but she revs up her jets the moment you start struggling. 
\>You're not sure what her problem is but you accept your fate and let the hybrid valstrax do her thing.
\>This is going be one hell of a write-up when you get back to report on your findings.

[\>"The Velkhana observed her human lover with rapt attention, her bated breath fogging the air before her, as the hunter's fingers trailed down to the hide skins around his waist. She watched as his fingers undid the knot, before dropping the garment to the floor, fully revealing fully his maleness. Devoid of scales, his bronze skin glistened with mammalian sweat, and her eyes trailed down between his legs to the thin genital slit that spread with his arousal, revealing a long, pink spire that grew by the second. Her eyes hungrily devoured his impressive length, mind fantasizing how the flared and barbed hood at his tip would feel buried deep within her, or how the fleshy spines along his length would feel as they dragged against her depths with every thrust or how wondrous the bulbous knot at his base would fill her as he claimed her as his own..."](https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1625/38/1625383143682.png)

\>"Hunter, i feel the need to remind you that i only entertain [these adornments](https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1601/52/1601527263582.png) because they signify that i am mated to you"

\>"c'mon velk, you can hide behind that ice mantle all you want but i can see right through you"
\>"choose your next words carefully Hunter, or i'll skewer you..."
\>"well i for one think it really highlights your features"
\>"and those would be?"
\>"those big beautiful topaz colored eyes of yours"
\>Velkhana turns her gaze away from you, visibly flustered, her spear tail gently swaying back and fourth. you can tell she's clearly struggling to keep it still
\>"does it really?" she mutters.
\>you place your hand on her snout and move it back towards you slowly, meeting her gaze
\>"yes, and i can get lost in them for hours"
\>"you're hopeless" she protests
\>"only for you, Velk, only for you."
\>rubbing her snout gently, she closes her eyes and you press your heads together, her normally ice cold scales, now with a soft warmth to them

\>"dont push your luck.."

=============================================

>\>"Unacceptable, Mr. Anon. Come see me in my private, out-of-the-way office later so I can 'reprimand' you for your sloppiness."

\>Office Velk calls you into her office and makes you hastily strip naked before stuffing you under her desk
\>she proceeds to use you as her footrest/plaything while she busies herself filling out a company tax form on her computer and dealing with any visitors she gets
\>she idly plays with your dick with her ice-cold footclaws during all this, occasionally speeding up and slowing down to deny your orgasm, any noises you make stifled by her clamping one down over your mouth so you don't alert anyone else coming into her office
\>eventually you can't hold it anymore and she wrings a massive orgasm out of you, coating yourself and her claws in spunk
\>she then prods you to get up while simultaneously sinking down in her chair, prompting you to pleasure her in return
\>her nethers are even colder than her claws, threatening to make your lips go numb as you eat her out, her fluids effectively equal to ice water in temperature
\>this is where things get truly dangerous, as she can't contain herself as effectively, being in plain view of visitors
\>thankfully, this time, she only gets the occasional odd question if she's alright, which is hastily dismissed by her claiming it's too hot inside
\>you also know better than to make her orgasm when she's talking - as fun as it would be to get "revenge" by reducing her to a drooling mess in front of company, it would likely mean both your jobs
\>eventually you get a large enough opening to finish her off, her loud moans contained by the soundproof office as she blasts you right in the face with her orgasm, effectively giving you a facial ice bath
\>shakily gets up to lock the door finally, declares that playtime is over, and now it's time for you to absolutely ruin her with your "lance" like the hunters of old did as she begins stripping even faster than you

=============================================

>I'd absolutely worship multiple parts of Velk's body if she'd let me (even if it's tickling, for however long she'll put up with it). Part of the fun with such a regal monster would be tempting her to give in to her desires that she struggles so hard against, to throw aside the haughty, composed image just once and let herself melt away into a beast of lust indulging in her desires - even better if I actually succeed in "breaking the ice", so to speak.

\>Forced to massage and pamper a massive dragon until she is content, working on the grounds that she just kills you if you do poorly enough
\>It was all mostly hot air--she quickly submits to your touch as you begin to search for loosened scales to pull up along her neck and chest, granted she's still glaring at you out the side.
\>By the time you're preening her wings she's splayed out on her back like a contented cat in the sun. Her hide is so thick that you can't imagine it feels like much, but maybe she's more sensitive to touch than those craggy scales seem to let off.
\>You work around to the digits on her hands and feet, buffing out any chips in her talons and sharpening the points to a razor edge. She's almost receptive to your touch, giving just enough effort to allow you to move her heavy limbs as you please.
\>You're working up from there, up the arms toward the torso. As you reach finer and finer layers of scales, you can hear her breathing hitch. These spots are soft enough that you use a steel brush to find the broken scales and remove them. A wavering sigh of satisfaction leaves her mouth once you're at her stomach, yet she's twitching like something's wrong. The relaxed posture that you finally managed to coax her into was gone. She sucks in her belly to get away from the sensation, tail slapping against the ground with a resounding thud, but then forces herself back the same position.
\>Assuming you're doing something wrong, you pull away and try to reevaluate the task at hand. Almost immediately she cranes her neck to shoot you a vicious stare. She wasn't done, and neither are you.

>\>She suddenly rolls over so that you are on your back this time
>\>A clawed foot slams mere inches away from your head as cold air tickles your face with her bated breath
>\>"My restraint isn't just for my sake..."

\>With that duly noted, you come to the unfortunate reality that there is one last place for you to tend to. You would assume that Velkhana would be too proud to allow anything between her legs just on principle, but you have a job to do, and you're going to be doing it until its done. She returns to her back and splays her legs so you can properly address the base of her tail
\>Watching the talons on her feet that you already unwittingly sharpened, you get a strong grip on your steel brush and get to work. Already you get the impression of how much power is below your fingertips, the trunk of her tail pushing you away as Velkhana struggled to keep still. You can tell this was where her scales were the thinnest, and it really did feel that smooth. She kept her head straight along the ground and faced away from you, but her stomach was convulsing with every breath.
\>It couldn't be, right? It was just her enjoying the attention, wasn't it? And how much was she really enjoying it? Her vent was in clear view right there, and if you angled your head just right you could see the condensation of frost glistening around it.
\>A terrible urge to satisfy your curiosity steals control of your arms before any sense of self-preservation does. You reach up with both hands and dig right into the spot where her tail and haunches met.
\>She wasn't bracing for it. Her tail flips you up between her legs on reflex, an unrestrained shout of a chuckle escaping through her razor teeth. You nearly bash your head open on her lower stomach when you land. By the time you're able to look up and meet her gaze, you already know that you're dead

###*Zinogre*

=============================================

\>It was always something with this village, some little kid getting their hands on a zinogre pup.
\>Didn't matter how they acquired it, each one always ended up the same. As a gigantic beast that was just too wild to keep around.
\>In their pup stage they were seemingly harmless. Tons of fun to play with and at worst giving off a little static shock by accident. 
\>But as time passed and they grew larger, it became harder and harder to keep them tamed.
\>The first one really took the village by surprise. One day it went berserk and destroyed some walls in a blast of lightning. Didn't take long for the local hunters to subdue the beast. Nobody was hurt except for the emotions of the poor child who raised it.
\>People were skeptical when the second one somehow found its way into the village, but with its early stage being so friendly perhaps all it needed was more discipline growing up. It was watched around the clock but alas the chaotic tendencies emerged once again and the beast was released to the wild far away from the village.
\>Third time's the charm, right? Suppose so for this new village zinogre. It was definitely a runt with its extremely small size compared to the last two. And with the limp it had when it crawled into the village nobody could have turned down its cries for help.
\>Most villagers wanted to throw it out as a precaution, but when a researcher from the commission who was visiting found out about it his interest peaked. After hearing about the last two stories he had a glimmer of hope that such a beast could be tamed.
\>He took the pup in and moved his base of operations to a location on the edge of town, just in case the thing went berserk. Many months passed by as the monster grew, and to everyone's surprise this one didn't blow up another building.
\>Things were looking up for the friendly zinogre. It retained its peaceful nature as it grew up this time, acting like a giant palamute who just wanted to be pet. 
\>Every day kids would visit the researcher's place for a chance to play with the lovable dog. This usually ended with their parents scolding them out for messing with the resarcher's work, but he didn't mind. And the zinogre sure didn't either.
\>The researcher was stumped by the beast's consistent nature. Why didn't it turn monstrous like the others? He spent countless days on research but couldn't find a definite answer. Whatever the case he was still glad things turned out better this time.
\>As word spread about the researcher's success the village soon accepted the zinogre into their ranks like any other normal pet. For a beast its size it knew how to control the lumbering power within and move around the village gracefully. Fear of it destroying the place dissipated over time and the villagers eased up.
\>It also proved to be very useful at times. From warding off rogue adult monsters who battered the village while hunters were gone to providing fast transport for the village doctor when a serious injury occurred far away from home. Everyone was glad the zinogre was around to help.
\>And the friendly beast did its best to always give back to the community. Usually by dazzling everyone at night with a wonderful lightshow of sparks and excitement before resting in the town square. It was now the village's mascot and protector, guarding the people who were kind enough to give it another chance.

####*Velkhana/Namielle*

>I'm pretty sure the moment Nami gets in the pool, she'll end absorbing all of it and getting stuck due to her new size
>I pray for the poor soul got in before she yelled 'CANONBALL!' 

\>"Ms. Elle, we need to talk."
\>"Ever since we brought you into our little family, our water bills have nearly quadrupled."
\>"Not only are your frequent visits to the water cooler cutting into you work time, your...'absorptive qualities' are proving expensive as well."
\>"To put it frankly, Ms. Elle, these various incidents have become a nuisance. The effects that water seems to have on your figure, not to mention your strange tendency to splash it over your office clothes and leave NOTHING to the imagination, is distracting your male coworkers, reducing productivity across the board."
\>"And then there's the incident last week where you simultaneously nearly drowned and crushed our newest one to death after diving into the company pool and growing large enough to displace the water entirely."
\>"The poor soul has only just begun his long road of therapy and recovery from it. He still repeats the phrase 'thicker than a bowl of oatmeal' regularly, whatever THAT means..."
\>"Yes, yes, I'm aware that due to your...genetics, you need regular rehydration more than others. But nonetheless, I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend your pool privileges and limit water cooler breaks to your lunch hour until you learn to control yourself."
\>"Need I also remind you, Ms. Elle, that your 'streamer tag' of 'wet4hunterz69' also reflects poorly on our company name?"
\>"It's recently come to my attention that you have a certain aversion to a particular product of ours...namely, Goldhorn BosomBoost and it's rather 'amplified' effect on you. If you require a lesson on NOT using your work computer when dealing with your little side-hobby, I'm certain Ms. Kulve would be able to find time in her busy schedule to assist with that..."!'

####*Velkhana/Malzeno*

\>velk is looking to move after getting bored of the hoarfrost reach (and annoyed by the constant screaming)
\>sees an ad for some snowy mountain region land for sale, perfect for somebody like her
\>also has some old castle ruins nearby which probably explains the low price but she isn't too worried about it
\>the move goes great and velk gets settled in just fine
\>moving process was extremely tiring however (couldn't leave behind all those priceless ice statues she made) so exploring the ruins will have to wait for tomorrow
\>after getting a few hours of sleep in her icy bed velk gets woken up by a sharp pain all over her body
\>she glances over and to her surprise notices a whole bunch of weird bugs biting her
\>bedbugs! the thought itself is enough to send a shiver down her spine
\>she roars alongside an icy blast, instantly freezing all the weird red bedbugs before they have a chance to scurry off
\>despite the infraction she has no issue falling back asleep
\>as she dozes off she wonders how those bedbugs came to be, probably caught them off one of the palico movers she hired
\>wakes up in the morning to the sound of her door bell
\>answering the door reveals none other than the titular Malzeno himself
\>except velk has no idea who this monster is
\>"Can I help you?" she asks, unamused at the thought of being awake this early
\>"Yes... I believe you have something of mine, or rather, a group of somethings. Also, you should be dead."
\>the horde of qurio bugs attached to malzeno's neck all flutter in response to his statement
\>velk finally notices them and almost screams
\>"Eww! So YOU'RE the one who gave me those. Get away from me you disgusting slob!"
\>she slams the door shut on him and freezes it over with an ice blast for good measure 

=============================================

\>velkhana moves in to the icy part of the citadel
\>malzeno does everything he can to kill her so he can suck up that delicious dragon energy
\>sending over a horde of quiro while she was asleep didn't work, her icy armor was too thick and cold for the bugs to pierce
\>malzeno, being the clever dragon he is, decides to invite her over to the castle for dinner and hatches a plan to kill her there
\>of course things don't go as planned
\>velkhana sits down at the table unaware of the monster sized piano hanging above her
\>malzeno goes over to pull on the curtain rod to activate his trap
\>nothing happens with the piano, instead a chandelier falls on his head
\>thankfully malzeno prepared for this and continues with the dinner
\>his servant garangolm arrives with a bowl full of dangerously hot soup as the appetizer, the plan to melt velkhana down to a puddle
\>but garangolm slips on one of the sheets of ice velkhana makes wherever she walks, spilling the drinkable lava harmlessly to the side
\>plan C arrives as garangolm comes back with a plate of the most potent poisontoads ever, created in malzeno's underground lab and altered to look like harmless frogs
\>malzeno chuckles to himself as velk picks up a toad, only for her to freeze it solid with an icy blast which nullifies the poison inside
\>she takes a bite and is quite pleased with the taste while malzeno sits on the opposite side seething with rage
\>plan D takes place with malzeno giving velk a tour of the castle before locking her in a room with lunagaron, hoping that his powered up form can take velk down by surprise
\>after waiting a few minutes he opens the room to find velk petting lunagaron like a harmless puppy
\>her powerful gaze was enough to subdue to the beast before he had a chance to lay a claw on her
\>malzeno, furious that all his previous plans had failed, is now forced to take things into his own hands
\>he brings her back to the castle's main ball room and begins monologuing about how he hates her guts and admits directly to her face that he is going to kill her
\>a flood of quiro fly in, empowering malzeno with the life force of almost everything from the forest
\>velk is unamused by his act throughout all of this
\>finally, malzeno is completely powered up and displays his magnificent wings with a force so strong the walls tremble
\>the gust of wind he created somehow activates an old gramophone that was sitting nearby and a smooth waltz begins playing
\>"Enough with the show, if you wanted to dance with me you could have just said so," velk says and takes malzeno by the claws before he has a chance to react
\>the act alone is enough to freeze malzeno in shock, never mind the icy grasp she had on him
\>with no control over his body velk guides the two around the ball room as they dance to the blissful music
\>not a word comes out of malzeno's mouth, he is completely flabbergasted by velk's dominance over him
\>garangolm and lunagaron also dance together in the background until one slips on another ice sheet
\>the music finally stops and velk lets go of malzeno's hand before giving him an icy kiss
\>"Well, it's getting late. Thanks for inviting me over, I had a lot of fun tonight," she says
\>"Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes..." he stutters as her cold aura sends a chill down his spine
\>as velkhana walks away she speaks up again: "You should really do something about that piano. It's dangerous to leave it hanging up like that."

>[God I wish I was Rathalos](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1533/21/1533218958988.png)

\>Imagine the SENSORY OVERLOAD of being mounted by a full-size Tigrex
\>Imagine the weight pressing down on you, teeth and hot breath on your neck, claws hooking around your hips while his warm scales scrape you all over
\>the heavy, relentless thrusts pushing your whole body forward, trying to force his already-hilted shaft even deeper under your tail
\>being brought to orgasm within seconds when his ridges start to flare inside you, barely able to moan over your own panting
\>the sudden feeling of another heartbeat all through your lower half, a load being fired into you with enough force to knock a hunter to the ground
\>imagine pulling your shivering body up from the dirt ten minutes later, still dazed when you walk past and casually flag your tail in his face
\>looking back moments later to see that genital slit already spreading open, his shaft drooling white as it slides out, rapidly becoming erect
\>realizing you only have seconds before that shaft is buried in you again, and this time it won't be over nearly as quickly as the last

\>after a bit of this, slowly, surely, the front door creaks open and the Barioth girl gingerly steps out, naked as well and blushing madly
\>clearly she's not as into this, a fact proven when her Tigrex friend quickly wraps an arm around her in a friendly but strong headlock with a loud guffaw and pulls her out into the open

\>hands you her phone (which you have no idea where she was keeping it) and asks you to take a picture of them to commemorate the occasion

**`{Transformation}`**

>\>the [Fatalis] eye was actually lovingly hand crafted out of sweet jello
>\>but it also contains materials that are not fit for human consumption
>>Alternatively, she gives you fully edible Fatalis "eyes", then one day when you're nice and comfortable with them, switches it out with a real one in hopes that chomping down on it will basically speedrun one of those Fatalis transformations she's heard so much about on you. Then she'll finally be able to have that rough sex (rough, as in, bordering on actually fighting you) that she's always wanted.

\>while you're on the ground screaming from having the very core of your humanity being rewritten on the fly she's furiously tearing at your pants to harvest you at the peak of your transformation.
\>you try to resist her but the elder dragon blood coursing through you is almost too much for your body to handle, you can feel your limbs seizing up preventing you from throwing her off.
\>she's playfully straddling you and coaxing you on, practically begging for you to let it take you as you can feel your new scales enveloping you and sealing you in.
\>your mind clouds as you can feel your body being pushed past its upper limits, the surge of dragonfire in your lungs begging to be released, the instinct to scratch and bite with your new claws and fangs, the fire in your soul shouting "breed!"
\>with the very last drop of your willpower you manage to focus and direct yourself at the one thing in the room that can take it
\>her sadistic nature is instantly reversed when you manage to grab her arms and turn the tables on her, overpowering her and pinning her down with your newfound strength and taking her as your mate instead.
\>even as strong as she is she gravely misjudged how much she pales in comparison to a newly arisen Fatalis, her once dominant nature instantly turned on its head to complete submissiveness as you clamp down on her neck with your jaw and lock her down, her soft protests are ignored as you squeeze and push, completely lost in the moment.
\>with one last loud roar you let loose all the energy that has been boiling over inside you, scorching the ceiling and slightly distending her belly with your oozing manhood.
\>feeling like a burned out matchstick your strength leaves you just as quickly as it came, your limbs turning to jelly as you flop down beside her, puffing and wheezing.
\>before you completely black out, you catch one last glimpse of her cuddling up to you, giving you a peck on the jaw with her cool fangs.

\>hiking along they're to busy enjoying the scenery to notice the obstacle in front of them, making full contact and startling the heck out of whatever they bumped into
\>large pairs of green translucent wings unfurl and the air begins to crackle with neon lightning
\>"alright, who's the runt that interrupted my preening?"
\>the looming figure shuffles around, meeting Tobi eye to eye
\>"well well well, you must be quite the greenhorn if you're picking a fight with me little one" they hiss
\>Tobi sits down, head cocked fully to one side. "Tobi is blue, not green. silly!"
\>Astalos seems dumbfounded by their complete lack of self preservation
\>"You have no idea who i am do you?" "then allow me to introduce myself" they say as they stand upright, puffing out their chest and vibrating their tail and head crest
\>"I am the one who calls down the thunders rage, the electric rebel, the reaver of bolts!" their wings spread wide filling the air with static and an overwhelming sense of pride
\>"HI I'M TOBI!" the small fang wyvern shouts, tail wagging at full speed "YOU'RE SO COOL!"
\>Astalos deflates almost instantly, tail flopping to the ground
\>"kid i know you're new around here and all but you're supposed to fear me, you know fear. with an F"
\>"F? like Friends?!" they shout. "ARE WE FRIENDS NOW?!"
\>"kid, no, wait. no. thats not how this works!" they sputter, completely stunned and bewildered by the turn of events
\>"FRIENDS FRIENDS FRIENDS" Tobi cheers while running around in a circle
\>Astalos grabs the small wyvern as best they can with their wingtalons and picks them up to eye level
\>"Stop. that. right now" they growl
\>"OKAY BEST FRIEND" shouts Tobi, tail still wagging frantically

>\>I think helping monsters by being matchmakers for them is just as noble a cause as legalizing hunter-monster marriage

"I want to help you find your special someone."
\>The monster blankly stares at you with a thickening aura of dubiousness that slightly cracks your otherwise cheerful mood. As your mouth creaks open, you stifle the urge to reflexively snap back with a sarcastic retort.
"I'm not a monster, but that doesn't mean I'm ignorant to what makes you, or them, tick. Would you prefer to find a living, breathing mate, or does your ongoing affair with that oddly worn-down rock you keep conveniently close to your nest trump any desire of seeking out a more meaningful relationship?"
\>You tried.
\>A garbled noise escapes your acquaintance, visible chagrin and indignation producing an unusually strident whine that has no business coming from such a rough-and-tough monster. They quickly recover from the loss of face, growling in wordless, yet fully intelligible conversation while staring daggers at you. That you haven't immediately been sent scurrying away with a minor bruise or two is a miracle, although the errant flicks of their tail has not gone unnoticed. Loath to endure another "gentle" beatdown this week, you hastily follow up.
"Look, I'm not here to judge, I'm here to play matchmaker. Help you find your dream guy, or gal! Whichever works."
\>Be it from their own doing or your sweetened words, a steely glare slowly softens, eyes wandering in thought while you warily eye the telltale tail – every so often, their gaze meets yours, to which you smirk and waggle your eyebrows.
\>You're unsure of how much time passes, but after yet another glance down towards you, you catch an unmistakable eye roll as they murmur to themselves, and you can't help but grin at their actions. Never direct, this one.
"I'm not hearing a 'no'..."
\>Muzzle pursed tight, a loud huff is the only response, their blatant refusal to make eye contact only fueling the shit-eating grin spreading across your face. If that isn't a go-ahead, you don't what is.
"Great! Consider me the ultimate wingman!... No it's not literal, it's – stop giving me that look, okay?... You don't have to be looking at me to give me a look – IT'S NOT LITERAL."

\>Private Journal Entry #29, three days(?) after the experiment
\>It finally worked! At least, I think it did. After countless hours of research and gathering of the rarest materials in the land my time machine worked! But alas, my excitement got to the best of me. Failing to properly calibrate the machine before performing such a long jump through time might have created my own demise.
\>I don't know how many years I jumped ahead, but it is most certainly far beyond my estimates. This world I'm in is so foreign, so alien that I'm afraid I might have moved through more than just time itself.
\>The inhabitants of this era have created marvels that surpass the greatest achievements from our time. Buildings made of steel rising into the heavens, machines that fly through the air with speeds rivaling that of a Valstrax, and tiny handheld devices that somehow do just about anything you could ask. It is almost paradise.
\>Almost, except for the fact that everyone here is a fucking hybrid! I have not seen one human or wyverian since my arrival. I fear they may have been eradicated long ago, not through conflict but from being unable to keep up with the monstrous expansion of the hybrid population.
\>Luckily I have managed to conceal myself beneath the shadows of their own constructions. A dark cloak is the only thing that covers my naked form. As long as I keep to myself nobody notices, only spending as much time as I need out in public. Who knows what may happen if I get caught? My priorities now are staying alive and finding someplace to set up a base of operations. I spotted an abandoned building near the coast a while back so hopefully—
\>["Hey mister, you alright?"](https://test.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1539/46/1539466353437.png)
\>Shit, one of them is on to me. I got to get out of here...

\>Entry #29, addendum
\>Managed to escape that mizutsune hybrid, she (or he, I couldn't tell) was very persistent and started asking all these intrusive questions like what's wrong, what's my name, and if I needed a place to stay for the night and wash up. I kept my head down and stayed under the cloak I was wearing. I don't think they saw what I looked like.
\>They kept offering to let me use their washroom for whatever reason. Maybe I smelt really bad, or maybe it was something to do with them being a mizutsune. Who knows with hybrids.
\>After mumbling a few words at them to leave they finally walked away. I really don't know why I engaged in conversation with them in the first place. Got to stay focused. Find a place to set up shop and hopefully recreate the machine to get back home before this turns into my new home.

\>eventually gain enough of their trust to visit them at their home/den, and talk calmly with them about things, even if they can't respond in turn
\>eventually get to know each other well enough that through body language you can communicate crudely with each other, as you're both intelligent beings
\>see the look of shock and confusion and happiness when they finally let you touch them, and they feel the comfort of another being not trying to kill them for the first time in ages

\>slowly build up enough trust for them to fall asleep in your presence, and watch their chest rise and fall as they peacefully rest while you watch over them

\>their rapid heartrate and breathing as they feel your hands and fingers across their body, moving and caressing with more gentle precision than paws or claws could offer
\>the desperate neediness and pure bliss combined in their eyes as you work to pleasure them in ways they never could on their own
\>the feeling of the two of you locked together as one as they climax to your touch

>>With Hybrids and rampant monster fucking being a thing in /trash/'s version of the monster hunter universe, quests like that probably would unironically be a thing

\>when good ol' hunting eventually stops being the primary method of dealing with unruly monsters and wild hybrids getting a bit too big for their (lack of) britches, quests to see what kind of effect certain sexual acts will have on certain monsters become commonplace
\>like if cumming on a Lavasioth hybrid's tits will make it sizzle
\>or if doing the same on a feral Velkhana's ice mask will cause it to freeze and "add" to it's design (be sure to take detailed notes on how unamused/pissed she gets!)
\>or if fucking one of the Great bird wyverns will actually cause them to lose status within their pack
\>it goes the other way too
\>like Legiana needing a male hunter/hybrid's services, to test if she can make them cum just by screaming at their dick loudly enough
\>or a really big monster like Lao Shan wanting to be taught how to safely have sex with a smaller hunter/hybrid without accidentally crushing them
\>or a sweet but nervous Cham hybrid girl, wanting to know more about hunter society (particularly the inside of their homes) but too mild-mannered to ever try and sneak in invisibly without spilling her spaghetti
\>...that last one you're still working on, because you ended up losing track of her halfway through the "tour" of your own house and now you can't find her

Combing their fur and polishing their scales so they can look their very best!
Bringing them lots of food so they can bulk up on muscle and take on any potential challengers!
Helping them practice their mating dance and nesting behaviors!
Comforting and encouraging them when the big day comes!
Giving them a friendly smack on the haunch and telling them to go for it!

>Would hybrids instinctively perform mating rituals related to their monster counterpart? Or maybe they're super surprised when a human gets interested in them even though they haven't shown off any display of courtship. 
>>you would probably only see fancy displays and rituals during the height of mating season, while on the other side it would be funny to see your monster partners complete bewildered reaction when you try to explain to them that humans don't really have a season and are to some extent "in heat" all year around. and who knows, maybe you could have fun with it try to put some moves on your partner and see how it plays out, maybe wear some brightly colored clothes and flex in front of them with a feather duster on your head or something and see if they either bust out laughing or are too busy trying to tear off your pants.

\>"well, nobody really follows it anyways, its just a joke thing."
\>"so what, does this mean that you're just in constantly in heat through the year? how do you get anything done?"
\>"in heat inst really the word for it, we just get to choose when we want to be sexually active"

\>"um yeah scatternuts for brains, i just always thought you were super oblivious, but now i know."

\>"yeah yeah i already told you i get it now but for the sake of curiosity, when is your next season thing anyways?"
\>"it should be in about 3-4 weeks when the weather clears up, why do you ask?"
\>"because when it does, i was thinking that maybe we could get a place down by the shore, craft a few energy drinks and maybe practice a few moves that arent exactly guild approved if you know what i mean"

\>"You see... recently we've been noticing a somewhat disturbing trend surrounding your graduates. Graduates that 9 times out of 10 apply to become a hunter immediately once they're free of your clutches. Usually this isn't a problem and we'll welcome any new applicants willing to prove their mettle."
\>"But this is where the disturbing trend comes in. They're mostly female and barely scratch the surface of meeting our requirements. Some of them are so voluptuous they can't even wield most hunter weapons properly! Now the Guild doesn't discriminate against any applicant's gender or build, but the trend here is clear. These recent graduates of yours are not hunter material."
\>"I really don't know what happened but your standards have obviously plummeted in the past few months. Your dojo is not the pristine training grounds that it once was. I recommend you try and remedy this troubling trend or else you'll lose the Guild's certification. And that means losing all the benefits that come with it."
