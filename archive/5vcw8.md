Heartaches

A strange sight. A place once so lively with servitude suddenly reduced to an all encompassing silence.

Omori frowned as he looked around the colorful halls, his friends behind him following his example, perhaps unnerved as well by this sudden hush.

Grand doors were opened. A sense of dread and lightheadedness suddenly assaults them.

They were struck into inaction. A familiar figure, now dressed in a wedding dress.

Something was different this time. A different weight to her presence that was not there when they first encountered the obnoxious ruler.

Beauty and grace, so otherworldly that it rooted them to the spot and did nothing but stare.

As if she was waiting for them, she turned and gave a beatific smile, veil casting an ominous shadow.

Steps toward them, halting just in front of them. Sweetheart outstretches a hand, a gesture aimed at the eldest of their little adventuring group. Come hither.

Like a love-struck loon, he stumbled forth, taking her hand in his grasp and saying nothing as she stared deep into his eyes.

At the edge of his vision, Omori saw her hand making a clawing gesture. That pit of dread he felt grows into a roaring tide. Too late.

Her hand surges forth, burying itself deeply into Hero’s chest. A gurgle. A brutal rip.

He crumples to the ground and everything spirals into chaos.

A scream of rage and equal despair, before he could stop them, Aubrey and Kel sprinted for her, craving retribution.

Seeing as his choice had already been made for him, Omori joins the battle as well. 


The reason for the silence is now known to Omori.

Sweetheart had stolen their hearts. All of them. And in doing so, grew in strength.

Far too much power, in so little time. 

Tremendous.


Like dolls, he was knocked aside with little effort. A gloating, grating laughter pervades the ears, and the monochrome boy rises for another round.

Dangerous. Wrathful. There was no other way to describe this new threat.

Where did this sudden bloodlust rise from? Omori had no way of telling.

All he knows now that this was something that cannot be allowed to remain in Headspace. Too brutal for this idyllic dreamscape.

Omori grits his teeth in rage, as Sweetheart let out yet another string of obnoxious laughter. Levelling her gaze at him, challenging yet ultimately, dismissive of him. 

Blood on her hands as well. Red. 

They came to her castle, once lively now surrounded by death.

Holes punched through certain areas, something was ripped out of them.

Omori stares at the broken heart buckle on her hip, and he feels a sense of revulsion at his thoughts.

She had ripped out their hearts, and in doing so, grew stronger.

Far more than she should have.

A spin of his knife, his red hands extending behind and beneath him, ready to further bathe in crimson at the behest of their master.

Sweetheart gave a bloodthirsty grin in response, twirling her heart-breaking flail in the shape of a crimson mockery, a heart.

His friends were behind him, downed and unresponsive, but not toast. A portion of his will went to them, making their bodies remain even as they bordered on the brink of sliced, browned bread.

Hero...He’s not sure what has happened to him. He should have been relegated to the stasis of bread by now, but no, he remains lifeless.

Damnation. He refuses to let them be exposed to this egotistical maniac, grim clarity as he realized what would have happened to them.

He charges forward this Queen of Hearts, let her small tyranny end this day.

Knife met flail.

A clash. Red hands met body. Sweetheart gripped a few with an empty hand and crushed them in her grip.

A few, stronger hands sneak by, wrapping tightly around her waist, and lifting her into the air as she lets out an indignant squawk.

The hands were faster, and with great force, dragged her wretched, beautiful face across the ceiling and with great force, slammed her into the floor, cracking the tiles.

Omori took no chances, charging forth once more, knife tinted red, glinting with the urge to end this.

A leap into the air. A plunge downward. A final stab. 

He feels something burrow into him.

...

His hand lets go of the knife, he missed, tilted away by an arm that suddenly buried itself elbow deep into his torso.

Bleeding and battered, Sweetheart smiled viciously at the slowly dying child.

With a vicious rip and a powerful kick to his body, his heart was stolen and he, knocked away once more, tumbling limply.

Sweetheart stands shakingly, victorious mocking laughter heard through the desolate halls.

With great force, she squeezed the throbbing heart in her hand, and immediately all her wounds faded, and her ever stronger.

No matter. He succumbs this day, but he knows that the dreamer will crave justice sooner or later.

And if this loathsome brat dares to touch his dear innocent sister on her picnic blanket?


He will ravage her body and whatever rotten heart she had till nothing remained.

He swears.

Omori succumbs.
