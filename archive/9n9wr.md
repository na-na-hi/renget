>backpacking through Taiwan had been an experience so far
>people were kind and the weather had been amazing
>summer wasn't hateful during your trek
>all in all a nice vacation
>one night you decided to camp on the beach 
>exploring the beach for a nice spot led to an alcove, hidden in the undergrowth
>rocks seemed to have buried the entrance but you'd pulled a few aside after seeing light
>humans clearly hadn't set foot in here in possibly centuries
>it was a beautiful 
>dusky sun cracked through the ceiling 
>it felt… holy
>your eyes were drawn to a pool and past it a small humble shrine
>this place felt ancient and you couldn't explain it but that shrine was the perfect place to set your sleeping bag next to
>the water in the cave shimmered with the setting sun and you cleared your mind and watched it
>the shrine itself had some tiny statue you didn't recognize
>age had stolen the colors but it still persisted
>it was a man or possibly a woman
>the robe made it ambiguous 
>the figure wore a mask that had what looked like ears
>almost like a rabbit
>you admired the craftsmanship and felt the serenity of the tiny cave wash over you
>it smelled like the ocean
>that was your last conscious thought before sleep hit you like a freight train
>you must have been more tired than you thought
>you dreamed for the first time in ages
>it was vivid
>the first thing you noticed was… rabbits
>rabbits everywhere
>the room was covered in such a carpet of fluff you were afraid to move
>what wasn't covered in rabbit resembled some of the older architecture you'd seen in the cities
>ancient Chinese construction swarmed by bunnies
>you wondered about the significance of the dream
>but at the moment you didn't want to crush a rabbit underfoot
>as if sensing your fear, the rabbits cleared a path to ornate double doors that had appeared
>the doors opened outwards an ornate oriental garden
>moonlight bathed everything
>the smell of sweet flowers was relaxing 
>the garden was almost like a fairy tale and you walked further into it
>sitting on a nearby wall was a figure that resembled that statue
>same robe, only in vibrant red
>same mask, only in stark ivory
>their hands and feet didn't resemble human's 
>instead they were more like black and white paws
>this was a dream after all
>then he turned to you and you felt something deep welling inside you
>you just knew his eyes were locked with yours even with the mask
>you awoke after that and the first thing you noticed was a weight on your chest in the dark
