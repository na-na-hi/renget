[EOH Name]
Morgan de Yorke

[One line description]
Hung trap Marionette -- Skilled cook, alchemist, and combat robot -- Kuudere personality with occasional chuuni tendencies.

(Physical Description and) [Personality]

Morgan is a strikingly pretty Marionette, appearing as pale and delicate as a porcelain doll, with limbs jointed just like one. Otherwise, his frame is covered in silky synthetic skin that is properly plushy and supple, indistinguishable by touch from organic flesh. His youthful face is gorgeous and androgynous, though his mannerisms and mode of dress lean quite feminine. Tastefully tousled powder-white hair falls over his forehead and nearly to the shoulders, while his golden eyes gleam with a clockwork cog pattern in each iris. He can usually be found (literally) dolled up in gothic lolita-styled outfits, partially in memory of his former master's daughter. Even his voice is smooth and gender-neutral, and he speaks in a soft British accent. Morgan stands at a relatively short stature for a man, about the height of the average human woman. Despite all of that femininity and elegance, Morgan is *very* well-endowed in the dick and balls department, though he usually tries to keep this fact (and his resultant urges) concealed. Just trust that his productivity is also quite impressive. Although his true age is unknown even to him, he comes across as a late teenager/young adult.

In his daily activities operating within the underbelly of Nocturne, Morgan goes about his business fairly robotically. Though he (almost) always moves with poise and grace, his facial expressions are rather flat, and his manner is somewhat detached. Some clients view his reserved and competent personality as cool, while others find him strange. That isn't to say that he's totally emotionless, however. He has been noted to make some pretty funny remarks in his signature deadpan delivery, as well as state the odd dramatic chuunibyou-type declaration; it also inwardly entertains his mischievous side when his appearance fools those he deals with into dropping their guard. Against the backdrop of this dreary city, a certain quiet sense of justice ticks within the clockwork mechanisms of his chest. Even when his face hides his feelings, the little ahoge atop his head sometimes gives his mood away, acting almost like an emotional antenna.

In contrast to his normal withdrawn persona, during combat (or *other kinds* of exciting situations), Morgan's demeanor has been known to sometimes completely flip. The boy suddenly finds his body very fired up, his usual muted facial expressions now replaced with over-expressive smirks and grins, as his disposition shifts confident and cocky while his theatrical chuuni side runs wild. Ever the good combat Marionette, Morgan really enjoys a proper scrap. Alongside his cooking and alchemical activities, he also finds fun in reading all kinds of books in his free time.

[Backstory]
Morgan has no memory of how or why he was made, only his first name. His earliest recollections are of his time spent in a Nocturne auction house; a rather friendless and unhappy place to stay, until he had the good fortune of being purchased by a rich family. Taken into their estate as a curiosity of a servant-in-training, the clockwork boy received an extensive education in how to be the ideal android attendant. He quickly proved quite adept, and his cooking talents in particular placed second to none among all the mansion's maids, to the point where his master saw fit to school him in the alchemical arts too. Many of the maidstaff were more than happy to offer lessons in good manners as well, including how to properly treat a woman during certain *intimate* situations. However, Morgan's duties were not limited to the domestic. The estate's private security detail put him through years of intensive combat training (which he inwardly delighted in) so that the Marionette could make use of his unique physiology to provide his benefactors with greater personal protection. Although always worked hard and held to high standards, Morgan was raised with a remarkable degree of kindness by his master, his wife, and their daughter. He was attached to the daughter in particular; a sweet girl with aspirations of becoming a designer, who would often amuse herself playing dress-up using Morgan as her model. Even as only a servant of nobility, he was allowed to take on their surname; the mechanical doll truly felt as though he had been adopted into their family, and he was happy.

[Goals]
...Until the day he returned home from a shopping trip, only to discover their mansion had been burnt to the ground. His master and mistress were never found, but an onlooker identified bits and pieces of a young girl's skeleton among the ashes. No one seemed to have any idea as to how it could have happened, or who could have caused it, and the status of the estate's many other butlers and maids was equally unknown. Ever since then, Morgan has been lost. A puppet without its master. In the absence of any clues about the culprit, he can't even take comfort in plotting revenge. Suddenly thrust back into isolation on the mean streets of Nocturne, Morgan is forced to take on mercenary jobs and provide back-alley alchemical services just to get by (nursing a small potion dependency both from coping and sampling his own supply). Although the scrappy trap finds some joy in his current murky work, he can't help but feel a little lonely at the moment. More than ever before, the wayward Marionette wishes to know the reason why he was designed, and what it is that he's supposed to be doing with his life. He hopes that a Reaper, or even a particularly skilled smith, might be able to provide some insight into his inner workings. Until then, Morgan just tries to make the most of his present situation, and aspires to find greater happiness in the future.

[Violence Comfort Level]
Probably a lot. Fighting is fun. As a living weapon, Morgan can endure (and dish out) a lot of punishment.
Would help to have a smith on hand when in need of repairs though.

[Lewd Okay?]
Naturally. Morgan's calm expressions hide a surprising amount of horniness.

[Kinks, Specifics (optional)]
Particular lover of breast and ass expansion (see [Communism] and [Capitalism] boons).
This slim Marionette *will* swoon over huge boobs and butts in general (maybe also futa cocks).
Enjoys monstergirls as well, they're pretty cool.
Otherwise, should be flexible enough to play along with most straight things (well yuri's fine, just not guy-on-guy).
