# BOTMAKER RENTRY TEMPLATE
->![Add a cool image here!](link to the image)<-
***
This is a template based on my [own rentry](https://rentry.org/Darkfantasy109) which focuses on organizing things neatly.
Includes sheets for bots and prompts. 
The table of contents fills automatically. Use ## for categories and ### for sub-categories.

##BOT LIST
***
###Bot category 1
A bot sheet. To add new bots, simply copy and paste the latest one you've added (or in this case, the sample bot). To make another category simply copypaste this category below. You can also use the same template for lorebooks.
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![This is a little easter egg message if you hover in!](https://files.catbox.moe/jd5it8.png) | Bot name goes here | Add a brief description of your bot here. Don't worry about the image being too large or too small, it'll adjust to the text you add. I recommend having the image link to a catbox file of the card, and have the link to chub or others on the side. | [CHUB link](link goes here)
