# BOTMAKER RENTRY TEMPLATE
->![Add a cool image here!](link to the image)<-
***
This is a template based on my [own rentry](https://rentry.org/Darkfantasy109) which focuses on organizing things neatly.
Includes sheets for bots and prompts. 
The table of contents fills automatically. Use ## for categories and ### for sub-categories.

##BOT LIST
***
###Bot category 1
A bot sheet. To add new bots, simply copy and paste the latest one you've added (or in this case, the sample bot). To make another category simply copypaste this category below. You can also use the same template for lorebooks.
Image| Name | Description | Link
------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![This is a little easter egg message if you hover in!](https://files.catbox.moe/jd5it8.png) | Bot name goes here | Add a brief description of your bot here. Don't worry about the image being too large or too small, it'll adjust to the text you add. I recommend having the image link to a catbox file of the card, and have the link to chub or others on the side. | [CHUB link](link goes here) [Catbox link](link goes here)

##PROMPTS
***
Optional: A category to add the prompts that you use. 

###Model-specific Prompts
You can add a brief explanation of your prompts here. Copy and paste this section below to add different prompts for other models.
Prompt | Text
 ----- | -----
Main | Main prompt goes here.
NSFW | NSFW prompt goes here.
Jailbreak | [Jailbreak goes here.]

###Custom Jailbreaks
Optional: A lot of anons like to create custom or special jailbreaks, like appending humorous 4chan posts to the end of your bots replies, and whatnot. Here is a table you can use to list and showcase what these jailbreaks do! 
Jailbreak | Text | Example
 ----- | ----- | -----
Name/brief description | The Jailbreak goes here. | ![example log goes here](image)


***
##REVIEW BOX
***
Optional: a table you can append to your rentry if you would like to have a space to recommend or showcase other people's bots, or alternatively have a trimmed down/simplified version of the above botlist style. (Though I always recommend adding images to your card lists - it's the first impression you'll give!)
Name/Link | Review | Author 
 ----- | ----- | ----- 
[Card name goes here](link goes here) | A brief review or description of what you wish to add here | Author's name

Put whatever else you want here, like your contact info, profiles on other sites, or a link back to the meta rentry!
