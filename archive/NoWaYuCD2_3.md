Chapter 3: The Heroes' Great Adventure
Ch: ...Like this... and this, and this... It's finally done. My self-made role playing game! Ready for release. The title is... how about this. Let's make it "Bloody Abyss." Yeah. That's great...
Yu: It's recess time~!
Ch: Y-you're in a good mood, Takashima-san.
Yu: They say nothing can beat a middle school girl's recess! That means I'm unbeatable right now!
Ta: I get what you mean, Tama's feeling great. Tama's Super Tama God 3 right now.
Yu: What's Tama God 4 like?
Ta: Ohohohoho! Tama turns into a figure of utmost nobility.
Yu: You would be an ojou-sama, I take it?
Ta: Indeed.
Yu: Wakaba-san, are you in good humor on this splendid day?
Wa: Huh? Normal, I guess.
Hi: Wakaba-chan, that's wrong.
Wa: Eh? What is?
Hi: You have to answer like an ojou-sama.
Wa: I don't know how that works.
Hi: Just speak properly, the others do it too.
Wa: Ahem. I'm feeling quite well. Tamako-san, would you join me for some green tea?
Ta: What the hell are you saying? Did you hit your head or something?
Wa: This was your own idea!!
Ta: Hahaha! Run!!
Hi: This truly is a middle school girls' recess time.
An: It does feel a bit like elementary school though.
Ch: Takashima-san, I wanted to give you this.
Yu: Huh? What's is it?
Ch: Takashima-san, you said you were interested in RPGs and such, but couldn't handle difficult games, so... uhm, I made this.
Yu: Huh!? Gun-chan, you aren't just good at games, but you can even make them!? Awesome!
Ch: It's nothing that amazing... There are games where you can make your own games, you see...
Yu: Eh, you made it just for me!?
Ch: Yeah... You, me and all the others appear in it and I think it's easy to play. I wanted to give you something that would make you like games...
Yu: Thank you, Gun-chan! I'm super happy! Handshake, handshake!
Ch: Oh, ahh... I'm glad you like it.
Yu: Let's play it right away at the dorm once we're back!
Ta: I've heard everything! A game that has Tama in it, huh? We've gotta play it with everyone!
Hi: I'm intrigued. I hope I'm a healer.
An: But we're all Heroes. Will it be balanced?
Ch: I've taken that into account.
Ta: Alright! Let's meet at Yuuna's room this evening. Wakaba, you too!
Wa: Sure. I've learned how to play video games a bit, so I can somewhat keep up with the conversation.
Hi: But no staying up late. You'll become the drowsy Wakaba-chan.
Wa: I know.
Yu: And thus, all of us have gathered in my room.
Ta: "The Home of the Gods," huh. That tapestry makes some bold claims.
Yu: I've put it up because that's my home town. Okay, let's boot up the game!
Wa: That title...
Ch: It's Bloody Abyss.
Ta: That name is pretty visual kei.
An: Who would you say is your favorite game character?
Ch: Vincent, maybe...*
An: You really stick to your tastes, huh.
Yu: The game has started!
Ta: Oh, this is...!
Yu: I see! Gun-chan and I have to save the world in this game.
Ch: That's right. We're Heroes.
Ta: Hey, wait a sec.
Ch: What is it?
Ta: Would you happen to know where my Tama makes her appearance?**
Ch: You'll appear soon.
Ta: I'll join the party, right?
Ch: Fufu.
Ta: What's that laugh supposed to mean!?
Hi: Ah, this Miko is me, right? I see, I'm the character where you can restore your health and save.
Ch: That's absolutely essential in games.
An: What about me?
Ch: Takashima-san, could you open the system menu?
Wa: I believe the system menu is where you can check your status. I know a fair bit as well.
Hi: The knowledgeable Wakaba-chan, right~?
Wa: I suppose.
Yu: Where do I open the system menu... here?
An: Ah, I'm giving advice on how to proceed.
Wa: That's a fitting part for you, Anzu.
Yu: It's reassuring to get advice, don't you think?
An: Such a lovely role. Thank you very much!
Ch: I didn't think you'd be so grateful for it.
Yu: Oh, an enemy has appeared!
Ch: Take a good look at the screen. There, Nogi-san shows up.
Wa: You're right. I'm engaging the enemy.
Ch: She's a damage dealer that sometimes comes to assist. When she does, she usually defeats them in a single attack.
Yu: Wow! Wakaba-chan, you're strong!
Wa: Don't be so blunt, you're making me blush.
Ch: She has many different attacks patterns. Sometimes she'll take a bite out of the enemy.
Hi: Hey! Wakaba-chan!
Wa: The real me didn't do anything!
Ta: When Wakaba handles the offense, does that mean Tama's a defender?
Ch: No. You don't appear in battle.
Ta: Don't tell me I'm running the item shop or something. Or maybe I opened an atelier?
Yu: Oh, another enemy! ...Huh, it's Tama-chan! Tama-chan appeared!
Ta: I'm an enemy!? This is utta madness! Chikage, we're going to the roof!
Ch: If we beat her, she recognizes our strength and joins our party.
Ta: Geez, you should have said that earlier. Our roof meeting is cancelled.
Hi: All of us have appeared now.
Wa: Good thing each of us had a role they were satisfied with.
Ta: I had no idea what was gonna happen for a while there.
An: But you were relieved in the end, right, Tamacchi-senpai?
Ta: Hey, why are you watching Tama so closely? You sure love Tama, don't you, Anzu~?
An: Yeah, that's right. I love you.
Ta: Where should we go for our honeymoon? Hawaii? The Aloha Islands?
An: Austria would be nice...
Hi: Okay, Wakaba-chan. It's getting late.
Wa: You're right. Let's call it a day.
Ch: I'll stay a little longer.
Yu: Haah! That's enough for today. This game is fun, Gun-chan.
Ch: I'm glad you think so.
Yu: Let's play some more Buraddo Kaosu tomorrow!
Ch: Not Buraddo, Bloody.
Yu: Buraddi.
Ch: Abyss.
Yu: Abisu.
Ch: You got it.
Yu: Okay, Buraddi Abisu! I've memorized it! By the way, if you clear this... do you get a happy ending?
Ch: Of course. You live up to your name as a Hero, save everyone and live happily.
Yu: It will be world peace, right?
Ch: Yeah, of course.
Yu: All right! I'll try to clear it all, both in the game and in reality!
Ch: Yeah.
Yu: Together with you, Gun-chan. Okay?
Ch: Yeah!
Wa: Chikage sure is amazing. She managed to make such a game...
Hi: You could feel her love for games and Yuuna-san through it.
Wa: You're also smart, Hinata. I think you could make a game like this as well...
Hi: But I'm currently playing the Wakaba-chan raising sim in real life.
Wa: Huh?
Hi: Never mind, it's nothing.
Wa: By the way, Hinata... I know it's almost time for bed, but, uhm... could you please clean my ears?
Hi: But of course.
Wa: Okay, all right...
Hi: It seems like this will have a good ending~. Fufufu.
