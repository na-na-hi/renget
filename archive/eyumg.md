#/ncg/ FAQ for /ncg/ anons

>Do I need to play Girls Frontline to understand this?
No, Neural cloud is almost completely a different story. It reuses a lot of characters from that game and is set on the same universe but you don't have to play or read on that game to enjoy this.

> I just started, who do I reroll for?
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/who-should-you-roll-for-192
See above guide
If Kuro isn't out then roll for either Hubble or Aki and start with that. The pool is extremely small at the moment and rerolling matters a lot less than you think unless you get some ultra nut roll with multiple 3*'s and Aki/Hubble.
If Kuro is out then you have a real important unit to roll for and reroll for.

>Is this game fun?
It's autochess with randomly generated stages. Pretty fun but it was intentionally designed to be side game material so don't expect to play a lot once you're done with current content unless you want to spend every day farming pivots.

>Is there PVP in this game
Zero. There are some leaderboards but zero PVP and fully PVE.

>Is this game F2P friendly?
CN players say it's extremely generous and F2P friendly but EN hasn't even been out for a month at the time of writing this. We have no real reason to not believe them though and many F2P players are already sitting on two guarantees so it should be true.

>Do I need dupes
No, dupes are turned into a universal currency called Neural Kits which can be used to purchase additional character fragments outside of daily farming stages.
1 ⭐ = 5 Kits
2 ⭐ = 60 Kits
3 ⭐ = 300 Kits
In a future update, there will be a banner type that rewards character fragments directly for dupes instead of Neural Kits. The choice is yours.

>Are there guilds or clans?
None.

>How do I make a team? Who is good???

See above guides. Warrior team is currently the easiest way to blow through stages as F2P but sniper team might be better once Kuro is out. One of each works very well for progression but you might want to stack all your cards on one class for harder content which means mostly warriors or mostly snipers.

>How should I progress efficiently? I have no idea what I'm doing
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/beginner-guide-219
See the above guide. Just make a team and clear story as far as you can. Make sure to keep your people leveled and story should be pretty easy.

>This game is so stamina hungry!! I waste all my keys on 2 stages!!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/122DgoNlc8KSYR6JCHzcf5IHzE8BLOKBUCo-BA6Hgjys/edit#gid=0
The tl;dr is that grabbing everything is good but expensive so if you want to progress slowly but build a stash of materials as you go then claim everything and if you want to speed through content then you can choose to claim nothing and get what you need off 1st time clears. Always grab Skill Pivots though.

>I used a support and now I can't find that character anymore??
Supports in story mode are limited to 5 unique characters per day starting out. Meaning that if you use someone's support Aki then you can't use any support Akis for story until the next daily reset. Non-story modes like Endless or Resource Stages have infinite support uses though so go wild there.

>Who do I pick from the 3* Selector? I have no idea who to pick!
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/3-selector-recommendations-191
Usually the answer will be to grab Nanaka if you do not have Nanaka because she's an extremely good healer that remains relevant later on. If you don't want Nanaka or have no idea who you want, you can always sit on it until you know who you do want.

>Who am I saving for? Any reccomended characters to roll for?
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/who-should-you-roll-for-192
CN and Global have different schedules so we have no idea what they will toss at us but the biggest one to roll for is Hatsuchiri because of how good her QoL is and how she trivializes some stages that require killing backliners. For other units, check the above link.

>Whats this procedural efficiency shit?
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/procedural-efficiency-guide-193
See the above link. You get points for doing the Endless Modes and this permanently boosts or changes your gameplay. Overclock Function is an absolute game changer and it allows you to pick one function of your choosing in every stage ever so grab it as soon as you can.

>What are Algorithms? Which ones do I want?
https://nalu.wiki/neuralcloud/p/neural-cloud-algorithm-setups-236

The Chinese tierlist also has reccomended Algorithms but keep in mind this specific sheet is for the CN server and not the Global one. It's for the CHINESE server.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugEerWZZcjcXyF7ZlYOUPISbnarrg2DCqRyHxpYsH4o/edit#gid=1139501412
Just copy the above builds for your characters. Getting the perfect algorithms is going to take a while but it's perfectly possible unlike in other games.

>Chinese tierlist?? Is there an EN tierlist??
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNBX0zZdaNsGYwxA6cxvh58X6nvUSlcaKf9lTmjF6Yg/edit#gid=4312925
See this one instead then. This one is for the EN server and is being updated for global by the guide people that played CBT and are making most of the resources.

>What are all these functions? Is there a resource that explains what all these cards do?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17X_5tPO3A7cYazONIM0F75t92lljF1X7-96bqLUy5sk/edit#gid=0
Here's a function catalogue with a brief explanation of what they do. The Chinese tierlist (Linked below) also lists some reccomended functions for each character if you want to know what cards to get for them but remember the sheet is made for the Chinese server and not the global one.

>Do we have a full list of what skins are coming with the battle pass?
https://i.imgur.com/iypAetI.jpeg
See above image. Order is unknown due to EN's different schedule so just hope the one you want comes when you can afford it.

>I want to whale, what are the best packs?
Cognition improvement is the best you can get with your money then the monthly card. Other than that, check for any limited time packs that you might want or the battle pass if it has a skin you want. Also, please buy the 3 packs in the shop that cost quartz sand. Sand is a F2P currency and the packs cost less than a single roll for a lot of resources so they're really worth grabbing even for F2P.
