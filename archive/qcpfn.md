#The question 

Fubuki and Mio dont fight

Just like rains fall from the sky and the sun comes out from the east, Fubuki and Mio just dont fight. Sure they bicker and discuss stuff, but fighting? Mio can maybe count the times in one hand and still have fingers to spare.
The first time, it was some dumb argument in the first year of  highschool, the kind of argument you roll your eyes over. They fought, yelled at each other and went home. In the middle of the night, they met at a park, both of them criying and apologizing

The second time? Must had been four years after they left highschool. It was a three-way fight really. Fubuki got mad at Mio's mom, her mom got mad at Her and she got mad at Fubuki. Mio and Fubuki made up,like they always did, but Mio's mom never spoke to her again.

The third time wasnt even a fight, it was the start of an ugly habit fubuki developed. Instead of fighting, she would just stand up and leave, saying''Ill think about it'''. It was two years before the debut of Hololive Gamers, and it was there when Mio asked her a question

Fubuki grimmaced, stood up and left. Mio just sat there, conflicted. At the next day, Fubuki apologized and explained herself, while evading the question

A good friend understands when a question isnt well received, and knows not to ask it again.

And Mio, who was a good friend, carried on. Years went by, and Fubuki and Mio didnt fight over it. The question,however, stayed with them, looming over like a sword of Damocles.

When Hololive came, everyone assumed the question was solved. And so Fubuki and Mio went with it. It was nice to live without worriying about it, and their relationship flourished to even greater heights
 Hololive helped, with it, the question just had sense.

But of course, the Question was a problem, and problems, unless solved, will eventually arise.

One night, as Mio was relaxing in her house, she got a call from her Dad.
It was a mundane call. ''are you eating well?'' ''i saw your live concert, your Aunt is proud of you' '' you should visit and talk to your mother''

And then he asked about Fubuki. 

''What about her? She's doing fine, like she always does'' Mio answered

His father didnt meant to poke around the issue, just like someone doesnt mean to break a plate while helping in the kitchen. 

It just happens. It was an innocent question, not the same she had buried in her heart for years, but a similar one

''Is she Mrs or Miss Fubuki?'' An innocent and well meaning question, one that Mio cannot answer. She apologizes and hangs the phone, but the damage is already done
The question rears its ugly head again, determined to stick around
Mio keeps triying to stamp it down, to force it down, but it just wont go away. She loses sleep for a few days, pondering it
And in the middle of the night, she realizes it wont go away. She needs to ask it or else she will get drowned in this stagnant misery.

A week later, in the middle of a dinner with Fubuki, she drops it. Umpromted 

''Fubuki...what are we?''
''Friends''
Fubuki's answer is instantaneous, automatic and cheery.
It is also fake. Mio looks at her in the eyes
''Please''
''Mio you are my best friend in the whole world'' The puppy eyes, the sincere tone.
It almost fools Mio. Almost
Friends dont reject boys to spend time together
Friends dont make a promise to remain united under the moonlight
Friends dont plan their future together
Friends dont get caught kissing by a homophobic mother
''Liar''
Fubuki looks at her, and before she can stand up, Mio grips her hand, tears building up in her eyes
''Im begging you, answer me''
''We are friends! i told you''
''Please''
''What do you want me to say?''
''Please''
''Im serious!''
''Ill go home, please answer''

She expects fubuki to Fight, to yell at her, to spit at her.Anything to steer the conversation away

 What she doesnt expect is a despair filled sentence
''I dont know''
Her grip softens, as Fubuki slumps back in the seat
''Im scared, because i simply dont know'' she whispers, her sorrowfull eyes locking with Mio's ''I know its not fair to you, but i really dont know''
Mio doesnt need to ask why, multiple voices echo in her head
''GET AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER YOU FREAK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?''
''Holy fuck you two really are faggots huh''
''Why cant you be normal? Your mother and Father would have loved Granchildren''

Hololive helped sure, but she knew it wasnt the same out there.
''I know we are friends'' whispers Fubuki ''And that's all i need really''
Its so easy. Friends
Just there, this can end. They are friends

And yet Mio cant accept that answer
''No''
Fubuki looks at her confused, before Mio asks tenderly
''Shirakami Fubuki....Would you be my girlfriend?''
Fubuki's eyes almost pop out of their socket, blood rushing to her face.
Mio cant help but feel a small chuckle escape her lips, and suddenly she's laughing loudly, as fubuki scrambles for her words
''Wh-Why are you laughing?! you just asked me that and you are laughing?!''
''B-Bec-because you'' Mio has problems forming sentences, as she wheezes'' Yo-You-Your face!''
Fubuki,sits there, before she sputters.
And then she joins Mio in laughter.



After Dinner, they leave, hands linked together in the middle of the night.
''Im sorry i left you hanging for so many years...i didnt...you know...want to cause you more pain'' Fubuki trails off, searching the words to explain herself
''Its okay... i never pushed you into it either. I was happy just...assuming it was a thing'' Mio simply enjoys the heat of their hands, linked together. It isnt the first time they've done this, and yet this time feels...different

Speaking of which.
''You didnt answer my question'' she knows the answer, but she wants to hear it.
Fubuki hmms, then turns around, bringing mio closer, hand in her waist and noses touching
''Ookami Mio...Will you be my girlfriend?'' 
Now its Mio's turn to blush, red as a tomato, as she smiles. It not her first love confession, but it certainly is the most important one
''Not fair...''
''Please Mio-sama'' Mio giggles at the dumb voice fubuki makes ''Im just a lowly fox asking for your love''
''I would Love to'' she puts a finger in fubuki's lips ''but a certain fox wont tell this wolf her answer''
Fubuki giggles
''Yes please... i will be your girlfriend''
Satisfied, Mio  inches forward, and Fubuki does too.

Its their first kiss as a couple.
