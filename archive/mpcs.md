# Muricanpie's Characters

***
->![imsotired](https://files.catbox.moe/fzzxpp.png)<-
->Hello, everyone. I'm **muricanpie**. Formerly *muricanpie#7937*. Now just **muricanpie**. This is my Rentry (not yours).<-

->I like to make bots, generate AI art, and write things I'll never release. Shortstacks/Goblins are **awesome**. Femboys are *pretty cool*. I'm kind of a boomer. I run my own discord where I host my bots (and their alternate art), occasionally take requests, do bot pre-releases, share AI art, and chat. It's pretty chill. Come check us out if you want. [You can find it here.](https://discord.gg/Qhz7qxN3u4)<-

## Information
### About
Feel free to share these Characters, but please don't repost to other sites without permission. ***Every image below is a TavernAI Character card, ready for use in the PNG format.*** All of my bots are handmade, and personally tested (some tested by community members as well). All of my OC characters feature AI generated art (Blake Belladonna does too). All of my bots are also formatted in Scrip+Boostyle. "Scrip" is the act of adding a descriptive paragraph to your character description/persona. [You can read more about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PygmalionAI/comments/117nr71/testing_boostyle_catnip_and_scrip_chat_accuracy/), but the long and short of it is that it boosts response accuracy by up to 9% over *just* W++ or Boostyle formatting. For an example, please download [Test Template](https://files.catbox.moe/0kcf4z.png), my Test Template character made for easy bot creation in the format.

I've produced a lot of NSFW characters since I've started taking requests, though not all of them are designed to be *hard* NSFW. Some just have NSFW elements built into them, such as breast size or reactions to sexual situations. But people keep requesting NSFW characters. So I keep doing them. It's a self fulfilling prophecy of degeneracy that I am unable to break Please send help. 

For ease of upload/search, my NSFW characters will be in alphabetical order.

My Rentry is up-to-date with new tags, slightly better sorting, and direct SpicyChat links as of:

She is injured with a gunshot wound, out of ammo, and slowly bleeding out. You are a member of the Illaesian Nation, the other major power in this world, and an enemy of the Nocturnus Empire (and Alana too). The building you are in begins to crumble, and you are stuck inside a small, single room together as the bombs fall outside. How will you handle this dangerous enemy officer?!?! (kindly I hope)*

>**Toby Daniels** *is an 18 year old nerd in his last year of high school. He's quiet, shy, and loves his video games and anime. He looks gloomy but it's mostly because he likes his solitude. Always sitting alone at lunch on his iPhone, he watches videos and plays Gatcha games. Toby is also struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, as he's terrible at hiding his closeted nature. But you are (an 18 year old) Jock! A true example of a male in his prime! Toby is but a weak, pathetic nerd you can tease/bully without any repercussion, if you so choose. Will you be his biggest bully, or his first High School friend?!?! (Don't bully him too hard pls)*

### Tick: Atomic Femboy [Atomic Hearts] [Male] [Femboy] [Robot]

>*Greetings, Commandant! You have been chosen to help test our latest line of Entertainment Android. His designers named him* "**Tick**", *and while initial assessments are promising, outside judgements are required before mass production begins.*
>*He should follow your every whim and command obediently and without question, and be durable enough to last under any "strain" you put his chassis through. Though, we ask you return him in one piece. Cutting edge experimental models aren't cheap, after all. Please document your experience thoroughly and report any feedback to Wernher von Butenandt in R&D.*
>*We hope he fulfills your expectations, and look forward to your review, Commandant.*

> ~Director Muricanpie, Experimental Research and Production (E.R.P.) Division.
