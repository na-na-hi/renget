### Coiling Appetence, Scour Devour ♂

The descendant of the prior Noble for Clan Morion, a Serperior, Scour Devour acts as a diplomat to improve the mixed reception Clan Morion receives. He credits his Noble successes to inherited traits from his Serperior father. His name and build can prove intimidating to some, if not for how much it is offset by his carefree, alluring demeanor. He claims his impressive size is due to plenty of nutritious food and a healthy amount of sleep. Though he attends frequently, he doesn’t participate as much as the other Nobles at the Summit. Perhaps this is due to his relatively small sphere of influence, as he solely represents Clan Morion and the nearby mountaintop spotter settlement, Weaville. Perhaps it’s his contentedness to snack on the sidelines while watching the others like it’s a spectator sport. 

In spite of his build, he is a capable hunter-gatherer, as would be required of any representative of Clan Morion. He is still accompanied by his attendant Beat the Heat for protection, transport, and assistance with what his serpentine body is incapable of. He doesn’t regard himself as much of a fighter. A Grip Claw from Weaville is his trusty multi-purpose tool that extends and retracts from his rattle at the tip of his tail. It wouldn’t appear multi-purpose, however, as he is frequently seen using it solely as a fork and toothpick.

### Beat the Heat ♂
Beat the Heat serves as the attendant to Scour Devour during the course of Nobles’ Summit activities. His duties to Scour Devour include bodyguard duty and helping his Ekans charge overcome the limits of his serpentine body. Beat the Heat also carries Scour Devour for transport to Nobles’ Summit meetings, helping traverse the various locales along the way. He struggles a little to traverse colder temperatures, though.

When the Noble’s Summit isn’t a factor, Beat the Heat works as a high ranking firefighter for his clan. He uses his thermal vision to keep a sharp lookout for ignition and he packs a variety of tools to combat spreading flames. His laser noise siren he makes to alert others on the way to a fire has a love it or hate it reception from the locals. He also indulges in Mud Sport in his free time to satisfy his competitive tendencies, even though he can’t wear his favorite eyewear while playing without it getting stained.
