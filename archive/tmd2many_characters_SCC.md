->Silver, Copper, Coal. Silver n' Co. These three Meowth lived in an old mining outpost alongside a few dozen Bug-Types. As wilds, they had no need for currency, instead trading what they'd find in the caves near their home. Silver would spot the stuff that looked nice, Copper would give what he overlooked a second opinion, and Coal would do whatever Coal wanted. Together, they lived a quiet life, until their home burned down during an ash storm. Silver wouldn't let this be the end of them, and made sure they'd be housed by any means necessary. Now they're living in Baram Town, wondering how to adapt to the lifestyle of civilized mon. One is clean, one is cautious, one is neither. All are in over their heads.<-
->All that matters is that they stick together. Things will always look up for them if they do.<-
