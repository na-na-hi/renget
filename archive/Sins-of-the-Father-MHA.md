Sins of the Father

A distinguished man dressed in the finest of clothes was showing a young man down the halls of Shinketsu.

"Don't worry my dear Haiiroshi, I would never hold a grudge against you because of your father."

"Thank you Mr. Yamando, that means a lot. My father would also like to offer his apologies for that whoopie cushion incident ."

The large man goes red and laughs uncomfortably " Don't worry, I am sure he forget I was meeting the Prime Minister..... Anyways here is your class, enjoy (dumb kid)" with the last part muttered under his breath, he showed Haiiroshi the closed door and walked away quickly. 

Upon opening the door the first thing that his the young hero was the nauseating smell making him gag instantly. A large boy in the front row waved to him

"Good morning! We were just discussing the latest episode of Giant Titted Magic Girl" he spoke as though he was talking before to someone yet no one was sitting even remotely close to him. Everyone has pushed their desks as far as they could.

Haiiroshi ignored him and moved to join the rest class in the back of the room. On his way another student offered a high five, upon reciprocating a jolt of energy shot through him. He could sense every bit of metal in the whole school, but only for a moment. The effect wore off as quickly as it came. 

"Whoa sorry man, didn't mean to do that!" The student apologized "My bad!"

Recovering from the sudden surge Haiiroshi shook it off "That is quite alright. It seems you have a pretty unique quirk."

He was about to sit down until the girl in the desk next to him shed her body and made a new snakier one, with the old body lying on the floor dead.

"S-s-s-sorry, needed a change"

Haiiroshi moved quickly to the other side of huddled group of desks. He sat down quickly next to a boy laying his head down on a desk.

Finally someone normal, Haiiro thought to himself.

"Hey there, my name is Haiiroshi, what is your name?"

The boy raised his head, a crazed look in his eyes. "I have devoured my family once again. I am cruel and evil, and will bring horror to the world!" He let out a loud scream before snorting more dust like it was cocaine.

"....maybe I should have applied to UA"
