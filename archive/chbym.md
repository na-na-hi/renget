How long had it been since you walked with such a spring in your step? The dreary grey clouds that occupied your life and skewed your perception of others had lifted, filling you with hearty optimism and a new genuine appreciation for life. Before you were just on autopilot and even after you summoned Hakos Baelz, you were still just scraping on by.

Ironic, that a goddess of chaos would make you feel this way.

She wasn't just a warm hole that happened to be bound to you anymore, the dynamic between you two had changed dramatically ever since you said those words to her a few nights ago.

*'I love you, Baelz.'*

The girl had started sleeping in your bed now, previously crashing on your couch or some other weird place in your house. The way she stopped wearing her own unique outfits just to have an excuse to wear one of your shirts like an oversized dress? Adorable. The way she would intentionally cuddle up close to you so that you had no choice but to wake her up in the morning? Adorable. She knew exactly what she was doing, wrapping her arms around you when your alarm goes off and giving you irresistibly endearing puppy dog eyes.

"*Just hit the snooze button a coupla' times, won't you?*"
"Baelz, c'mon-"
"*Please, honey?*"

Then you'd sigh and oblige her, hitting the snooze button and closing your eyes while she giggles, nuzzling your neck and making herself comfortable again. You're lucky that you like to rise nice and early before work to get ready because you've nearly been late a couple of times due to your new lover's devious machinations... Though, you feel it'd be worth it just to be able to hold her for just a little longer. 

However, you started setting your alarm for thirty minutes earlier rather than your usual hour. You were pretty sure Baelz couldn't tell that you did that, since her mind was always seemingly occupied with thinking she had won over the alarm's influence on you. 

. . .

This particular morning was rather dreary, drizzling lightly and with a decent bit of wind that was audible even through the closed windows. You've managed to wake up a few minutes before your alarm and you laid in your bed, mind still a bit groggy as you disabled your alarm. You wouldn't be needing that. 

It was gonna be hard to get out of bed, especially as the months would get colder and colder. The combination of the soft, warm girl and the comfortable blanket proved to be a monstrously powerful combo that took intense willpower to overcome. You lift your blanket slightly, pulling it down and exposing Hakos, tucking it around her shoulders so that she could get some fresh air instead of just sniffing you.

A small sigh leaves you when you realize she's drooling on you again. You'd reprimand her, but she just looks so damn cute. Reaching down, you gently ran your fingers through her silky locks, eliciting quiet purrs from her. Were rats supposed to purr? Who knew? Moving onto her ears, you carefully felt them up between your digits, marveling at their softness and almost jolting when she suddenly shifted during your experimental touching. 

"Mmmmgh... Anon...?"

"Good morning, sleepy." You replied, hand moving down to her upper back and rubbing it as she stretched underneath the blankets, repositioning herself until she was laying on your chest. "Love," you murmur in a warning tone, scratching her nape gently, "you know I'll have to leave in another hour or so, right? I know you're going to try and just weigh me down."

"Are you saying I'm just a burden?" The rat asks in a mock sad tone, scooting up higher until she's just about face level, where she rubs her cheek against yours. "You know I l-love you, riiiiight~?" Something about how hesitant she is to say 'love' is absolutely lovable to you. It also fills you with a need to protect her- to show Hakos that you're deserving of her love and that she's deserving of love in general. 

You peck her on the chin, rolling onto your side and dislodging her, now face to face with the goddess. "Of course I do," you smooch her on the lips, pulling away and pressing your forehead against hers, "and I'd still love you, even if you played pranks on me or hurt me. I might be fragile, Baelz, but I don't want you on eggshells. I love you just the way you are, and I hope you know that." You add.

The look on her face is something you could savor and subsist off of for many decades to come, like a five-star gourmet meal for the soul. How her beautiful blue-red hues glitter with bona fide affection for you, how her upper lip trembles slightly as tears threaten to come, and how the dim light of your room catches her face *just right* and makes her out to be almost angelic.

Well, she was an angel.

Yours, specifically.

Across your link freely flows a stream of pure joy and calmness, easing whatever mortal stresses you had. Any thoughts of bills to pay, rent to make... it all fades into the background, and at this very moment, there's only one other thing that matters and that's Hakos Baelz. Your eyes glaze over slightly, body filled with warmth that threatens to lull you back to sleep. It wouldn't be that bad, you can afford to be cozy with her for another half hour or so, right?

Your eyes close.

"Anon?"

"... Aaaaanon."

"A-Anon, you're gonna be late!"

The words jolt you out of your sleep and you let out a disoriented sound much akin to a goose being slapped with a sandal. You grab your phone and gasp, immediately swinging your legs out of bed. Twenty minutes to get ready *and* get to work! You open today! "A-Ah jeez, I-I'm so sorry, A-Anon! I w-was really comfy with you and I a-accidentally m-mighta made you slee-" 

"It's okay, I'm just gonna have to double time this!" You hurriedly assure her, sprinting for your bathroom. Water on. Toothbrush grabbed. As you frantically do multiple things at once, you fail to register a presence behind you in the cold shower. 

"I-It's freezing, Anon! T-Turn the temperature up!" Complains Hakos, reaching around you and causing two soft things to press against your back. Ordinarily, you'd be a bit more into this, but the water is decently cold and it's your favorite way of waking straight the fuck up. 

"I-I won't be in here long!"

"You're gonna get sick or something!"

"Better sick than late!"

"I'll w-wash you then!"

As you brush your teeth, you can feel your lover's warm hands reach up and lather up your hair, tiny fingers carefully ensuring all of it is covered in shampoo. Leaving you to rinse that off yourself, she gets to work on your body, using your bar of soap to cover just about every inch of your upper body before hesitating slightly. "A-Are you going to eat breakfast?"

"Don't think I'll have time to today." You've been keeping track of the minutes that've gone by. It's already been four. 

"T-Then I'll give you a lil' pep-up because you'll be cranky otherwise." 

"Wha-"

Through the mildly uncomfortable chill of your cold shower, heat blossoms from your groin as Baelz' fingers grasp your cock. The fact she's able to emit such a comfortable amount of heat and offset the coolness of the water lends a strange feeling to what she's doing, and for some reason, you find it oddly pleasurable. Your hands brace themselves against the shower wall as she peppers your back with kisses, spreading tiny seeds of warmth as her fondling quickly gets you to full mast.

Understanding that she needs to be quick, there's hardly any words exchanged between the two of you- lest she gets too into it and tries to beg you for more. Although, you can feel her slowly mounting frustration as her hand keeps slipping off your length as a result of her quick pumping and the water present. Your eyes closed so that you can enjoy the sensations of warmth from her touch more, you become privy to her moving around to your front, leaving your cock exposed to the cold waters before it is engulfed within a warm and tight hole. 

"S-Stand still!"

Six minutes.

Over the dull pitter-patter of the rain on both of you, the shower becomes alive with the sound of wet skin slapping against wet skin- and muffled moans of pleasure. It's hard and fast, with how Baelz immediately picks up a frenetic pace, doing her best to milk you. The cold water is no longer bothering you now, the pure heat of your girlfriend's honeypot generating enough warmth that you can ignore it. Try as you might to keep track of the time, you've started losing count after the eighth minute. 

The girl experiments with all sorts of different patterns, alternating between slow deep thrusts or quicker shallow ones- or even a mix of those techniques. Her hips slam back against yours, walls contracting tightly against your cock and drawing out copious amounts of precum while she grinds on you, pulling out slightly before repeating. Her cries of pleasure spilled out, voice blessing your ears with:

"*GODS Y-YOU'RE SO FUCKING BIG! H-HURRY UP OR Y-YOU'RE GONN' BE LATE!*" Her high-pitched groans and whiny pants are bliss to your brain, and you wholeheartedly agree with her. You're going to be late alright, but not before you give her a firm dicking down. Eyes now open, you grab both of her arms and tug them behind her, practically holding her upright as her knees threaten to buckle on her. 

Joining her thrusts and slamming into her, each motion elicits a loud gleeful and plain lustful cry from her. Your engorged manhood must be pulling most of the blood from your brain because it's getting harder to think as you plow the horny goddess. The swollen tip of your meat pushes right up against her deepest parts on each plunge into her sopping wet cunny, her tightness practically sucking every available inch of you inside of her.

"*F-FUCK! F-FUCK F-FUCK! H-HA-AHN! H-HARDER, P-PLEASE I-I LOVEYOU! N-NNGH Y-YOU'RE SO D-DEEP!*" 

Most of the rationality seems to be gone from her mind too, as the buildup of pleasure begins to quickly reach its boiling point within you. Her breathing begins to get labored and you can feel the approach of an especially big climax approaching. Holding onto her wrists with one hand, you spank her pale, firm ass with one hand and feel her tense up around your dick as she lets out a cry of surprise. "Y-You like that?"

"M-MORE, P-PLEEESH!" Her back arches as you continue to slap her rear, the girl squealing in blind pleasure and then tightening up like a vice grip around your cock as she cums violently, forcing you to do the same as pure bliss pours through your connection. It pours through, the same as your cum shoots out in hot, heavy spurts into her waiting womb. You pull out of her with a lewd sound, semen dripping out of her hole as you stagger backwards.

"F-Fuck, I-I... I-I'm gonna be real late now." You gasp, still lost in a bit of post-ejaculation mindlessness. Baelz shakily reaches back and looks back at you, a delirious almost crazed look on her face as she spreads her lower lips and displays the sheer amount of cum leaking out of her. 

"Y-Yew f-fhffillled me up... eheh...~" She mumbles, before you suddenly reappear somewhere, unable to fully process the lewd image and get another raging hard-on.

You're at work now, in the employee room- which is thankfully empty. The only downside is that you're dressed in just a pair of jeans, and you can hear people approaching the lone door. 

You've got explaining to do as to why you're still damp from the shower and literally just have a pair of jeans on.
