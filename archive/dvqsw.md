[Another quiet weekend: /gmad/, /hmoma/]

Frank spent another day at his job, more eager about getting home than the tedious bullshit he was assigned to do. After six or so hours sitting at his desk, it started to drain on him. It didn't help that he wasn't exactly a day person. He struggled to wake up in the morning normally, even before he met his roomate Kelsuf, a six foot eight bat he couldn't exactly take out in public for a variety of reasons like: His hatred for clothes, the way he kept ruffling his wings, and his overly protective attitude towards Frank. 

In a way it was kind of cute watching him struggle to put on human clothes. Through Kelsuf's broken English, and Frank's patience, he was able to learn a lot of things about him. Anything to make living together more comfortable than it already was. 

First, Kelsuf was too hard to pronounce, so Frank settled on "Kels" after a brief discussion. Althougth it seemed obvious, looking back, Frank didn't realize the bat was abnormally sensitive to lights. This made things complicated until he gave him an oversized, goofy looking pair of sunglasses that managed to stay on his face and help him block out all the lights whenever they went out at night. After a very confusing, initial week living together, Frank was able to figure out that Kels was fond of fruits, and unsurprisingly, meat. Through some trial and error, he also learned that Kels was fond of Chinese food. Several months had passed since then, and the two had gotten to know each other...very well. 

At least Frank had something new to look forward to when he got back to his place. "He usually wakes up around this time anyway, I hope he liked the leftovers I saved him." he mumbled to himself on his way out the door. Frank started on his way home, dealing with a lovely amount of stop and go traffic that gave him plenty of time to think about what to do with Kels later on. Personally he would be fine with another night at home, watching movies and lounging with Kels, but he realized Kels was probably extremely bored staying at home and he felt slightly bad about it. 

When he finally got home, he parked, wiped the sweat off his face and got out of his car. He stretched his back, felt a satisfying pop, and worked his way up a small flight of stairs, fumbling around for the right key as he went. Exhaustion crept through him, the afternoon heat was brutal, but he was glad things might finally be cooling off. He sighed and quietly said "Finally" as he turned the key in the lock and stumbled inside while his eyes adjusted to his dark apartment. 

"Hey Kels, I'm back" he said while closing the door, relieved to start his weekend.

Despite his size, Kels was very efficient and moving around quietly. No matter how much Frank prepared himself, he was still having trouble getting used to it. All he heard in response was breathing, almost panting from the oversized bat that was somewhere in his apartment. From the sound of it, Frank thought Kels was trying to be friendly. He heard him getting steadily closer. Kels failed to stifle a yawn as he walked up next to Frank and put a hand on his shoulder, startling him. His "yawns" were long, drawn out growls that always made Frank's blood run cold.

"Fuck, you have got to stop doing that", he exclaimed while fumbling around for a light switch. The lights went on, then dimmed to a lower setting while Kels held a hand up to his face and recoiled back a few steps, hissing. 

Now that the lights were on, Frank was able to actually see his silent as fuck roomate. He wasn't surprised that he was completely nude because of how hot it was today. Frank had gotten to the point where he stopped being phased by it. Every now and then he caught glimpses of Kelsuf's figure, but he savored moments like these. He was well defined everywhere he looked. Even in the poor lighting, he could see the bat's massive upper torso and just the slightest amount of fat over a set of visible abs. His chest, underbelly and inner thighs were a soft beige color that complimented the rest of his light brown fur. His black, pointy ears sat on top of his head, twitching randomly. Two pool-ball sized nuts hung below an equally impressive sheathe that was barely covered by a small tuft of fur. Frank adjusted his sight when Kels brought one of his massive hands down from shielding his face, and looked into his dark green eyes. 

Kelsuf blinked a few times before returning Frank's gaze. "HEY. YOU ARE. RETURN" he said plainly while his ears twitched in excitement. Despite how calm and friendly his tone was, the bat's voice still sometimes shook Frank to his core. He was so glad the human he protected was back from the thing he called work. He didn't quite understand what it meant, but he did notice that Frank came home exhausted every time. Every time he asked about it, Frank said something about rent but he didn't understand it. He was just glad he was back.      

"Yeah, hey. Sorry I'm late, traffic sucked." Frank said weakly while Kels slowly walked up to him and hugged him. 'He's so fucking soft', Frank thought to himself before letting go. He reached up to pat the bat's head before turning around and kicking off his shoes. "Fuck, I'm beat." he said while sitting on his couch. 

Kels sat next to him on the couch, and slightly leaned into Frank hoping for more headpats. "ES OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU WANTING TO DO LATER?" he asked while smiling down at him with his top fangs exposed. Frank let out a weak sigh before responding, "Well, I dunno, let's head to the beach later...hell, we could even stop and get some food on the way back." Kels fell on top of him when he said that, and brought him in for a hug. Kels brought his face close to Frank's ear and whispered "VERY GOOD".

 It would have been endearing to Frank if he could stop thinking about Kels pinning him down like this and tearing his throat out while he begged him to stop. He knew Kels would never do it, but deep down, it lingered in the back of his mind. Between that and how distorted his voice was, it was hard not to think about it.  

He was trying his best to stop imagining the worst. Old habits die hard. But what made it even worse was that he was confused, and mostly ashamed because something that simple was all it took for his dick to start getting hard.

Apparently, Kelsuf's race had almost no boundries when it came to personal space. And since Frank was being pleasantly hugged by a ripped, naked bat, he couldn't help but squirm under him. He felt Kels gradually pull himself up and looked up into his eyes. He swore he watched his pupils contract ever so slightly while his tongue lolled out of his mouth. He inhaled deeply and, much to Frank's surprise, started chirping.

He only did that when he was really happy. 

Frank finally managed to sit up and continued, "Wow, you must really be glad it's the weekend, huh?". He watched Kels curl up his nose and shift in his seat to try and stop himself from blushing. It didn't work.

"NO. AM JUST GLAD WE CHILL." Kels shot back at him while flashing a grin. Not wanting to ruin the moment, Frank continued. "Well, let me shower real quick and we can get going-" he started to say, but was cut off by Kels raising a clawed hand to his face. "NO. YOU RELAX. IT TOO FUCKING LIGHT OUTSIDE NOW." As deep and disturbing as the bat's voice was, Frank did manage to find some comfort from it. He got up to grab a beer out of the fridge and was weakly held back by one of the bat's wings. Frank laughed, then rubbed the top of the bat's head. "Hey now, come on, I'm just grabbing a beer...you want one?" he asked, hoping that was enough to get Kels to laugh. 

"SURE", the bat responded. When Frank was happy, he was happy. And sometimes, that was all that mattered. 

Frank walked to his fridge, grabbed two beers and opened them before returning back to the couch. He handed one to Kels who carefully grabbed it between three fingers. "Cheers" Frank said. "YES. CHEERS" Kels responded. The bottles knocked against each other, it was officially time to start the weekend. The two had a whole night ahead of them, but for right now, they just wanted to relax, watch some netflix, and enjoy each other's company.

Only an hour had passed after Frank got home and sat on the couch with Kels, the tv flickered. Frank was enjoying a post work-day nap and Kels sat there quietly, looking down at Frank while he waited for the sun to set. Now that Frank was asleep, Kels was slightly interested in whatever was on tv. He was watching a bunch of humans argue about something. He didn't really know what it was about, he was just trying to learn how to speak English better. 

"SO SMALL. SO SOFT."

He looked down at the veins in Frank's arms and did his best to stop drooling. He was hungry for something else.

He shifted uncomfortably on the couch, realizing that his leg was falling asleep. The pins and needles had slowly crept up his leg for the past 5 minutes, but he didn't want to wake up Frank. He realized that his human needed rest so they could have fun later on, and he wasn't about to ruin that. Frank's face, however, was resting on his thigh, right next to his crotch. Part of him wanted to give Frank a scalp massage, and another part of him just wanted to grab him by the back of his head and-

Then his stomach growled, causing Frank to bolt up.

He looked up at Kels, who started to apologize for waking him up, and pat him on the head. "Yeah, I'm kinda hungry too" he mentioned while standing up. He gave him a quick glance over, picked up a nearby hoodie with two giant holes cut out the back, and threw it to Kels. "Get some clothes on and let's get out of here." He rubbed his face and walked towards the back room, flipping the light on walking over to their laundry basket. Inside was a pair of standard black denim jeans, but with a small hole cut out in the back for the bat's tail. He returned back to the main room to see Kels finally managing to get his wings through the back of his hoodie, facing away from him. Through the dim lighting of the tv, Frank was able to see the weird, almost transluscent skin that connected the sections of his wings. The amount of veins he was able to see was what suprised him the most as Kels briefly unfolded them and yawned. 

It took all of Frank's restraint to not walk up to Kels and slap his muscular ass. Instead, he threw the pants on the couch and started walking towards the door, looking for his shoes. "I'll see ya outside" he said, while grabbing his shoes. He stepped outside into the cool night, closing the door to give Kels some privacy. 

"Not like he needs it, he loves showing off. Can't really blame him." he scoffed to himself and grinned.

Kels walked outside shortly after, making sure to shut the door behind him. Frank locked it, looked up and Kels and grinned. Kels gave him a wide smile back, showing all 50 of his teeth. After seeing his teeth, Frank made a mental note to himself to have Kels try soup at some point just so he could see how he eats it. 

The two made their way out of the complex and towards downtown, which was only a few blocks away. Frank waited until he was a good distance away from the apartments to grab Kelsuf's hand. He didn't need his nosy as fuck neighbors to start asking even more questions. 

All the stress of his day vanished. He kept walking with Kels, completely thrilled to start his weekend.
