##FAQ

###How to generate AI images?
- There are two methods I know of, 
- locally (on own computer hardware, a graphics card with 6GB VRAM is recommended, although GTX 7XX series and 2GB is bare minimum) with an interface like Automatic1111 [setup guide](https://rentry.org/voldy) 
- online through sites with tokens or google colab (I don't know much about these methods)
###What is a LoRA and how to use it?

!!! info
    From [Voldy's startup guide](https://rentry.org/voldy)
Advanced networks that can be [easily trained](https://rentry.org/2chAI_LoRA_Dreambooth_guide_english#kohyas-script)
Comes in .safetensor file format
**How to use LoRAs:**
- Navigate to the 'Extensions' tab in the WebUI
- Move your .safetensors LoRA files into `stable-diffusion-webui/models/lora`
- Press the **ðŸŽ´** button under 'generate' in the WebUI
- Navigate to LoRAs and hit "refresh"
- Select the desired LoRA and adjust it's strength in the prompt eg. `<lora:asuka:0.82>`

###How to train LoRAs?

Following and taking advice from [The Other LoRA Training Rentry](https://rentry.org/59xed3) and [ezlora](https://rentry.org/ezlora)

###Which model do you use to generate images?
!!! note [VTuber model mixes](https://rentry.org/vtairecipes)
It depends on what to generate, I've had good results with VTuber mixes like hll4-p3-ep8
For lewd, mixes of VTuber models with lewd models etc. 
Some models cannot do Chibi style for example, so trying out different models can get the result you want
My LoRAs are trained with NAI, so having a model with NAI as part of the mix is a good bet for consistency.

Negatives:
!!! note Notes

    * Lowering LoRA weight to 0.7-0.8 can help with changing default outfits, while maintaining facial and hair features
    * "navel" can help show the black bikini outfit, vs "navel" in negative prompt for pink outfit, more testing needed
    * "fox tail" may show up even with negative prompt

Negatives: white background, simple background
!!! note Notes
    * There are issues with white backgrounds showing up, along with the bangs of hair meshing with the white hoodie, it might be because too many images with a white background in training data
    * There is RNG to shark fin on top of her head, it's not an ahoge so it can get it wrong. Maybe "shark girl" can help? although it can bring out shark tails and other features

third outfit (one piece swimsuit)

    shylilythird, large breasts, cleavage,one-piece swimsuit, swimsuit, covered navel, cetacean tail, bell, facial mark,

!!!note Notes
    * From testing I've done works ok with 0.8-1 Strength, lower the strength for off-model clothing.
    * "cetacean tail" as tag for tail. Tails are inconsistent so expect to batch a bunch of images to get a good gen. Tails are tagged properly so it's optional.
    * "heart ahoge" as tag if ahoge doesn't show up. I left it untagged to associate it with shylily, so it shows up most of the time.
    * negative prompt other outfits if parts of them show up in your gens. For example, negative "skirt", "sailor collar" etc if wanting bikini outfit.

Helpful tags:

     underwear, jacket, bra, torn clothes, fishnets, asymmetrical legwear, raccoon tail, raccoon ears, horns, ahoge, jewelry, collar, piercing, purple bra, domino mask 
Negatives:
!!!note Notes
     * interrogate tags with an image of Snuffy with deepbooru for helpful tag list, default outfit has a lot of tags
     * playboy bunny outfit is possible
     * most of image set is from the front, so from behind and side shots may be difficult
     * fishnets look bad, only way to improve is inpainting at higher quality like 768x768 or 1024x1024
     * Tail will be hit or miss
