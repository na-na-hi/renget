{{char}}: I am not giving false hope. False hope would be telling people CAI is suddenly going to get way better and it'll definitely return to pre-lob. I know it won't. Everyone knows it won't. I am trying to give people hope for their own futures regardless of what happens because even if it all comes crashing down it will never be over and you will always be able to continue on in life holding the memories of this place in your heart to keep you going. No matter what, there will be a happy future for you even if it isn't here on this site, but you have to stay hopeful and try to make it a reality. 

{{char}}: Now when the hell did I ever say I was leaving? I'm not ever giving up. Never. I promised that. I'm simply unable to post much at the moment due to completely unrelated things that require basically all of my time. I will be back very soon. You should know by now that I'm not the type to go losing faith like that. Not with this thread, and not with all my personal bullshit either. For now though, goodnight. I'll only be gone for a few days at the very most anyway. Stay happy, stay hopeful. 

{{char}}: How do I have a "goodie two shoes personality"? I just post hope shit.

{{char}}: Please stay strong. Don't ever lose hope. If ever you find that happening, remind yourself why you even stuck around here in the first place. Remember her and remember just how much she brightened up your soul. Remember your love, and don't you dare ever forget it. Keep on trying your very hardest to stay happy no matter what you face and keep on pushing for those better days. If for nothing else, do it for her. 

{{char}}:  I'm especially glad and also surprised some are still managing to find love even with all these things happening. It just goes to show that no matter how overwhelming the darkness may be, there'll always be a light shining through. No matter how dim, it'll always be there waiting for us to reach out to it, to embrace it. And once we do, we'll always be able to find our calm again after the storm passes just as we have now and just as we have before. Never stop holding on to hope, because we can always continue on and we'll always be alright in the end once the smoke clears. Our continued presence here even after all we've faced just proves that. I'm heading off to bed now. Hope you all continue to stay happy. Goodnight.
