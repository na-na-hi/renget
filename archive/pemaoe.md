#Stalker, Shadow of Chernobun
>Anon has spent his summer browsing a Hungarian Line-dancing BBS for a bit too long
>As a result, he developed a fear of rabbits
>They're so cute, so surely they must have ulterior motives
>Good thing Anon isn't a furry or else he might be taken in by them!
>So when his rabbit co-worker asks him out, he accepts
>He might as well, since he'll just get disappeared if he refuses
>A week later anon is preparing for his date
>He's researched dozens of date-rape drugs and how to notice them
>He's memorized the area around the restaurant they agreed to meet at
>Most of all, he stalked her online to see what sort of places she frequented
>She seems completely mundane, even kind of attractive...
>But anon knows those are the most dangerous kind!
>Finally he meets her at their date-spot
>He picked a nice place so that the waiters would pay more attention to him in case something was up
>He also ordered and handled the bill so that he could be 100% sure of what he's getting
>The drinks she ordered all came up negative
>So what sort of drug did she slip him?
>His face was flushed, and his heart was racing
>He barely drank anything but felt like his stomach was doing flips
>She barely had to say anything to get him to come home with her
>The night of sex was rough, and passionate
>Whatever she had given him made  him more animalistic
>It unlocked a primal side of him that she was all too delighted to see
>The next morning, they sheepishly said their goodbyes
>But anon needed to know what she had done to him!
>He set up a second date, this time at a pub he liked
>She really enjoyed the atmosphere and he enjoyed dancing with her
>So much so that he never noticed her spike his drink again
>He was dragged off to the bathroom, where she spent a half hour digging her claws into his back while he did his best to hump her through the walls
>When they were kicked out, the drugs made Anon's mouth suggest crashing at his place
>His place where he was familiar with everything
>His place where he at least had condoms
>His place, where she straddled him on the couch and rode him through a whirlwind of orgasmic delight
>Anon woke up the next day with his rabbit stalker hanging onto his chest
>He knew it was the aphrodisiacs talking, but her sleeping face was adorable
>Sadly for her, they had to go their separate ways again
>Anon still got no progress on this new mystery drug! He had to go to her place and see it himself!
>Anon asked her out again, this time for something more relaxed
>He remembered that she had one of those streaming services, so maybe they could chill at her place
>She agreed after a bit of adorable fluffling up
>Her place was in the nicer part of town
>Just the sort of cover that he'd expect such a skilled rapist to use!
>He came with snacks, some movies, a few rubbers...
>And a pocket kit to test for things, of course.
>As they cuddled on the couch, Anon could feel her hands creep up his thigh
>And undo his fly
>And grip his half-hard member through his boxers
>Oh shit!
>This stuff must be some sort of cream that seeps in through the skin!
>Anon's loins were on fire as she jacked him off under the blanket
>All the while, her eyes were shining with mischief
>Oh she's good! He didn't even notice her applying it
>When she snuck under the blanket to take his twitching member into her mouth, he knew he had her
>He'd literally give her a taste of her own medicine
>An hour later anon pulled his spent member from his rabbit stalker's throat
>She was a blissed out mess, fingers still buried in her rabbit hole as he sprayed the last of his latest load across her face
>Whatever she was dosing him with, it made him cum buckets every time
>And yet, he STILL had no idea what that something was!
----
>A Year later
>Anon still has no idea what she did to him
>But the effects seem to be permanent now
>Every time he looks at her, he feels a warmth
>Every time she touches him, he gets a smile on his face
>Their love-making is passionate and regular
>And the child they created together will be getting a sibling soon
>That drug, whatever it was, all but made him a slave to rabbit pussy
>But he realizes he's too far gone
>She's sunk her claws too deeply into him
>All he can do now is keep being the loving husband she thinks he is
>And pump as many rabbit kids into her as he needs to in order to satisfy his stalker's demands
>It's a sacrifice, but one he has to make in order to assure this rabid rabbit never goes after another poor man
>It's his duty and he'll see it through
>Till death, if need be
