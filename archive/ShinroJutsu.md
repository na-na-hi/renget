#Shinrō Kamotai's Secret List of Jutsu Ideas

>磁遁・磁龍の術 (Jiton: Jiryū no Jutsu)
Magnetic Release: Magnetic Dragon Technique

As the practitioner focuses their elemental chakra within their hands and executes the handsigns, a dragon of shimmering, translucent gray energy surges from his body, quickly flying forth towards a straight direction. Upon contact with a target, the affected area is engulfed by giant burst of heavily concentrated magnetic energy, causing severe internal damage and violently disrupting the muscular functions of the body as their electrical signals are driven into disarray.


>磁遁・飛翔球の術 (Jiton: Hishōkyū no Jutsu)
Magnetic Release: Flying Sphere Technique

Initiated by a hard forward stomp into the ground, the technique begins as the practitioner, making use of Earth Release, carves out a number of spheroid chunks of earth and stone from the ground, flying them above his head. Focusing his chakra upon these chunks, they are quickly consumed from within in a process reminiscent of Magnetotactic bacteriae. From within the rough chunks of rock, smooth metallic spheres burst forth, ready to be controlled by Magnetic Release. The size and quantity of those spheres is up to the user. It is also possible to realize this process entirely underground, the user needing to only control the spheres once they are formed.

>磁遁・磁石の墨術 (Jiton: Jishaku no Sumi)
Magnetic Release: Lodestone Ink

By blending Ink Production and Magnetite Production techniques, users can expel a stream of gritty, metallic ink from their mouth or fingertips. This jet black ink, which is infused with particles of magnetite, becomes easily manipulated by magnetic release abilities by virtue of being an liquid, allowing its usage in any number of techniques with far more nimbleness and agility than standard solid metals.

>磁墨・無定形塗料 (Jisumi: Muteikei Toryō)
Lodestone Ink: Amorphous Paint

An advanced usage of Magnetic Release: Lodestone Ink By manipulating the metallic particles embedded within the metallic ink, it allows for the rapid solidification of  parts or the entirety of the manipulated ink, allowing it to be used in a myriad of ways such as trapping enemies, creating walls, or even creating tools and weapons.

>磁墨・生壁 (Jisumi: Seiheki)
Lodestone Ink: Living Wall

Considered a subtechnique of Magnetic Release: Lodestone Ink and Lodestone Ink: Amorphous Paint, the Living Wall Jutsu manipulates metallic ink to create a thick protective defense around the user. Aside from being highly durable due to the layered qualities of the magnetic ink, it is capable of absorbing the shock of attacks by dissipating them within itself. It is also capable of trapping those who are able to punch through its layer, solidifying around the target's weapon.


>磁遁・砕片の雨 (Jiton: Saihen no Ame)
Magnetic Release: Rain of Shards

Through the use of Magnetism, the practitioner shatters a piece of metal into a large number of thin, sharp, senbon-like shards of rough metal. After charging them with magnetic energy, they are then shot at ludicrous speeds towards the chosen target in a rapid-fire barrage not too dissimilar from an automatic weapon. As they are stripped to mere needles in order to increase their penetrative power, have the tendency to shatter upon contact, showering it's target with shrapnel. They can, alternatively, be fired all at once, creating an metallic death shower, though at a much greater cost of chakra.


>神術・裁き衝撃 (Shinjutsu: Sabaki Shōgeki)
Divine Art: Judgement Impact

By concentrating a large amount of divine energy within a fist or chosen weapon, the practitioner of this technique is able to turn the divine energy within their method inwards, allowing it to be used offensively by effectively smiting the opponents with concentrated divine energy. This technique is especially effective against practitioners of Jujutsu, as the negative cursed energy within their bodies is violently purged by the positive divine chakra.
