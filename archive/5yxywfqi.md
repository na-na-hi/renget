**List of chess principles from the book "The Tao Of Chess: 200 Principles to Transform Your Game and Your Life" by Peter Kurzdorfer**

- 1: If you control more than half of the squares on the board, you have an advantage.
- 2: A knight on the rim is grim.
- 3: Place your pawns on the opposite color square as your bishop.
- 4: The path from a1 to a8 is the same length as the path from a1 to h8.
- 5: Leave the pawns alone, except for center pawns and passed pawns.
- 6: In order to get the most from your knights, give them strong support points.
- 7: To be at their best, bishops require open diagonals and attackable weaknesses.
- 8: Rooks require open files and ranks in order to reach their full potential.
- 9: Don’t bring the queen out too early.
- 10: Connect your rooks as soon as you can.
- 11: Develop a new piece with each move in the opening.
- 12: Don’t move the same piece twice in the opening if you can help it.
- 13: Develop knights before bishops.
- 14: A wing attack is best met by a counterattack in the center.
- 15: Before beginning a wing attack, make sure your center is secure.
- 16: Centralize your pieces to make them powerful.
- 17: When choosing between two pawn captures, it’s generally better to capture toward the center.
- 18: Play to control the center, whether Classically or in the hypermodern style.
- 19: Castle early and often.
- 20: Do not move pawns in front of your castled king.
- 21: Pay particular attention to the f2- and f7-squares.
- 22: A queen and a rook will always checkmate a naked king.
- 23: Do not pin your opponent’s f3- or f6-knight to his queen with your bishop until after he’s castled.
- 24: Never a mate with a knight on f8.
- 25: When ahead in material, trade pieces, not pawns.
- 26: When behind in material, trade pawns, not pieces.
- 27: In situations with three healthy pawns versus a minor piece, the piece is usually superior in the middlegame, while the pawns are usually superior in the endgame.
- 28: An extra pawn is worth a little trouble.
- 29: In positions with an unusual disparity in material, the initiative is often the deciding factor.
- 30: Passed pawns must be pushed.
- 31: Doubled pawns are a weakness in that they are immobile, but a strength in that they offer half-open files for rooks.
- 32: Look to liquidate backward and isolated pawns.
- 33: Fewer pawn islands means a healthier position.
- 34: If you must accept pawn weaknesses, make sure you get compensation in one form or another.
- 35: Location, location, location.
- 36: Exchange pieces to free your game when cramped.
- 37: Avoid piece exchanges when you control more squares.
- 38: Break a bind in order to free your pieces, even if it costs a pawn.
- 39: The move ... d7-d5 is the antidote for the poison in many gambits.
- 40: Don’t attack unless you have the superior game.
- 41: You must attack when you have the superior game, or you will forfeit your advantage.
- 42: Every move is an opportunity to interfere with your opponent’s plans, or to further your own plans.
- 43: A sustained initiative is worth some material.
- 44: The initiative is an advantage. Take it whenever you can, and take it back when you don’t have it, if at all possible.
- 45: A rook on the seventh rank is sufficient compensation for a pawn.
- 46: Superior development increases in value in proportion to the openness of the game.
- 47: Attacking two weaknesses on opposite sides of the board simultaneously will stretch out the defense.
- 48: The bishop pair is usually superior to a bishop and a knight or two knights in an endgame with pawns on both sides of the board.
- 49: Opposite-colored bishops will usually give the weaker player a good chance to draw a bishop-and-pawn endgame, but can often be a virtual extra piece for the attacker in a middlegame.
- 50: Don’t grab the b-pawn with your queen—even when it’s good!
- 51: The double attack is the principle behind almost all tactics.
- 52: Ignore your opponent’s threats whenever you can do so with impunity.
- 53: Doubled rooks have more than twice the power of one rook.
- 54: Hit ’em where they ain’t.
- 55: Relentlessly attack pinned pieces, weak pawns, exposed kings, and other immobile targets.
- 56: The threat you do not see is the one that will defeat you.
- 57: Always check, it might be mate!
- 58: Never miss a check!
- 59: Be aware of the numbers and types of attackers and defenders in a convergence.
- 60: Sacrifice your opponent’s pieces.
- 61: If you sacrifice material for the initiative, make sure that initiative is enduring, or at least that it can be exchanged for some gain elsewhere.
- 62: Accept a sacrifice not with the idea of holding on to the material, but with the idea of later gaining something by giving the material back.
- 63: The only way to refute a gambit is to accept it.
- 64: A knight, firmly ensconced in a hole deep in the opponent’s territory, is worth a rook.
- 65: Three minor pieces are usually much stronger than a queen.
- 66: Maintain the tension in the position rather than dissipating it too soon.
- 67: The threat is greater than its execution.
- 68: Pawn majorities should be marched forward with the candidate leading.
- 69: Attack the base of a pawn chain.
- 70: Rooks belong behind passed pawns.

- 72: Use a minority of pawns to attack a majority of pawns with the purpose of destroying the pawn structure of the majority.
- 73: The best defense is a good attack.

- 83: A good knight will overwhelm a bad bishop in an endgame even worse than a good bishop will.
- 84: Possession of the bishop pair is often compensation enough for weak pawns.
- 85: A queen and knight complement each other and are often superior to a queen and bishop.
- 86: Trade off your bad bishops.
- 87: Trade your passive pieces for your opponent’s active pieces.
- 88: Trade your opponent’s attacking pieces in order to break the attack.
- 89: Trade pieces, particularly major pieces, when your pawn structure is healthier than your opponent’s.
- 90: Exchange your opponent’s blockading pieces in order to make room for passed pawns to march.
- 91: Exchange your opponent’s defending pieces in order to make room for your remaining attacking pieces to infiltrate.
- 92: A bad plan is better than no plan at all.
- 93: A good plan incorporates many little plans.
