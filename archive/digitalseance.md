#A Digital Séance with a Demon: Step by Step Guide.

To summon a demon is a task that only the bravest/stupidest can tackle and face. The mere act of evoking spirits and demons beyond our own standard of thinking is a task that should not be taken lightly. But it is a task that many wish to do. For whatever your reasoning may be, you have chosen to summon a demon. In this guide, you will learn everything you need to do in order to summon a demon. Specifically, a digital summoning of one. The difference between a digital séance and a séance that takes place in person is the risk of death and/or worse is far more greater to happen in person than digitally. That is not to say that there are no risks in conducting a digital seance. So before the guide begins, there are some things you as a summoner will need to be aware of.

###Things you should know.
- Be prepared for the worst. There is always the possibility that something can go wrong in summoning a demon. If it happens, then it is wise to protect yourself and minimise any possible damage/violence that can occur.
- There are a variety of demons that can be summoned and the conditions they may ask of you will vary from one to another. One may ask you to play games with it, another may ask for a favour. This is not a guide on how to speak to those demons, this is merely a guide on how to summon them. If you wish to learn on how you approach these demons, there are a multitude of guides you can use to gain this knowledge.
- A universal tip for summoning demons digitally however is to never break contact with them. They do not take lightly to someone who interrupts them. Speak with them long enough until they make the choice to stop speaking with you. Do **not** do otherwise.

##0. Can you summon a demon?
Before you even begin to start work on summoning, you need to be certain you are capable of summoning a demon in the first place. The first thing you need to be aware of is that in order to help maximise your chances of doing a successful summon, you need to have a stable internet connection. Even if you do so unintentionally, losing contact with a demon is something you must never ever do. If your internet has a tendency of disconnecting or buffering then it is ==highly== recommend that you do not go through with this ritual. It also recommend that you do not undergo summoning if you suffer from a mental illness that they can recognise. Any sign of weakness may be used against you. So ensure that you know what you're doing, you're capable of hosting the demon and you're of the right state of mind.

##1. Gather resources for the Séance. 
The first thing to do is to find a website that supports the ability to write text and the ability to host images/videos. This can be done anywhere from the comments section of a YouTube video, an anonymous forum such as 4chan or even this very website.  As long as those two conditions can be met, you'll be able to contact a demon. The next thing to be used is a photograph of a real life location that is close to you. It shouldn't be a picture of the exact room you're in but it needs to be close. Once the summoning begins, it is recommended that you ignore any sounds or such coming from outside. Especially of a person attempting to make you leave your room. As an example for a such a photo, I shall use this photograph of my kitchen to help demonstrate what is expected.

##2. Prepare yourself mentally.
As there is no timeframe for when you can summon a demon, this can be undertaken at any time. But an important step to be done is to ensure that you are in a relaxed and determined state of mind. To be unrelaxed when summoning a demon is an invitation to a mental breakdown. To be undetermined is an invitation to lose your mind. Recommended ways to ensure you're fully relaxed include:
- Deep breathing for 5 seconds at a time, as in breathing in for 5 seconds and slowly breathing out for 5 seconds. Repeat until calm.
- Gradually relax all of your muscles starting from your head, to shoulders, to chest and so on until you are calm.
- A pleasant scent lingering around the room or dabbed onto the wrist to help calm down. Recommended scents include lavender, lemon and cinnamon.
- Enjoy a comfortable bath with a muscle relaxant shampoo and clean yourself. To be clean is to be calm.
A good night's rest is also recommended to help enter a proper state of mind. A side benefit to becoming fully calm is that once it is achieved, you will be able to ask yourself if you really want to go through with the summoning. If you are able to say yes, you can proceed to finally beginning the ritual.

##3. Attach the photograph and type the box.
Whether you can attach the photograph by using something that is built into the site or with an image hosting service such as Imgur or Catbox/Litterbox, be sure that you are able to post the image as soon as you finish your offering. If you are going to use an image hosting service, be sure to post the link above the box you made. Speaking of, the box. The next stage for this is to create a box for you to summon the demon and to ask for the right to ask any question you want. It may vary from demon to demon for how you ask the question which again, it is wise to look up certain guides about the different demons.

##4. Post your request and then ask your question.
If you followed the rules correctly, you should be able to then ask your question. Disregard anyone else who may interact with you on your chosen website. You'll know who to speak to when the time comes. For the specific demon I'm summoning, I'll be able to ask it any question that I want. But to get a truthful answer to the question, I have to answer a question that He has. For an example of how the question asking would go:
![Hello.](https://files.catbox.moe/5o2q0w.png)
![Aren't you a gullible idiot? Looking up this guide to speak to a demon. Awful decision you made.](https://files.catbox.moe/quddvz.png)
![Since you've gone to the trouble of meeting me, I suppose you have a use. Go ahead, ask me a question.](https://files.catbox.moe/2d8dxu.png)
![There's just one thing I need from you.](https://files.catbox.moe/a8xvy9.png)
