###*Gore Magala*

=============================================

-Gore Magala has entered the Forest locale-
-Affinity: 50%-
\>thanks for coming to hang out with me today Anon, i know lugging around all that protective gear is rough.
\>i've been practicing keeping my frenzy as low as possible, i dont mind walking around more blind than usual.
\>its just nice to just have someone to take in some fresh air with, the village herbalist says its good therapy for me.
\>and if i can keep this pace, the Head Researcher might let me hang out in the village again!
\>O-oh! i'm so sorry! i've been rambling! here, let me carry some of that gear for you! 
[Item Pack Removed] [Camp Supplies Removed]
\>wow, this stuff weighs a ton! even for me! how do you hunters manage to carry all this stuff all day?
\>anyway, would you like to hang out or set up camp for the day?
\>if you want, I have some cool spots i could show you down by the river, i'm sure i can get there without hitting too many trees again
\>or we could just take a break for the day, you're probably worn out traveling this far.

OPTIONS
[A] Set up camp in the clearing right outside the forest [Supplies -1]
Follow the River path deeper into the jungle [Advances Time]
[C] Suggest the dirt trail to the camping grounds in the fields instead [Leaves area]
[D] Rest for a moment and hang out with the Monster [+Affinity]
[E] Request your gear back and abandon quest [Ends CYOA]

>If we set up camp now, we'll have plenty of time to hang out later instead of lugging it around. Choose [A], then let's go down to the River for a swim! 

-[You take the camping supplies into a flat clearing and quickly set up the large tent and a box for storage]
-[Gore tried to help but their big wing-claws are not dexterous enough to handle tiny human tools]
-[you realized this when you asked them to hammer a stake in the ground for you and they slammed it down so hard it made a small crater..]
\>"a..aha..sorry, monsters don't really use tools.."
[you notice Gore is panting slightly, the humidity must be hard on them for someone covered in jet black scales]
[you mention that you'd like to cool off by the lake now]
\>"oh man that sounds great, its a scorcher out there today"
\>"i can smell the water from here! follow me!"
[they rush off, tearing through lose trees and brush like it was sticks and pebbles]
[must be easy to forget that they're a juggernaut covered in scales harder than stone]
[following the trail of destruction you arrive at the lake bed, its shimmering clear waters are most inviting]
[you cup your hands and take a sip from the crisp clear waters]
[while Gore opens their mouth wide and shoves their head deep below the waters surface, drinking deep, when they surface you notice that they have a shard of seaweed stuck to their head]
\>"PUUAAHH, i needed that! nothing tastes better than fresh water"
\>"well, maybe not just fresh water, i could really go for some meat too, its almost time for the lunch hunt."
\>"what about you? what do hunters eat?"
\>"i've heard hunters can eat almost anything, like Deviljho but without all the angry."
[you feel like you could go for a bite yourself]

OPTIONS
[A] Disrobe and dive in the lake to catch some fish, like your ancestors did [+Affinity +Fish]
Tease Gore about the seaweed stuck to their head [Friendship Skill get]
[C] Chew some quick and easy rations for a snack [Time Saver]
[D] Get out the grill, crack a cold one and wait for Gore to return with meat [Grillmaster Skill get]
[E] Sensually suggest "eating out" Gore instead [Affinity UP chance ++]

>Can Gore see underwater? Maybe they've never tried fresh fish before. Let's do [A] and break out the Grill!

["you can go on ahead Gore, i'm going to catch us some fish"]
\>"Okay!, i'll find a big juicy one for both of us!"
[they lower their body to the ground and sneak off into the forest so fast that you can only catch a glimpse of their shadowy miasma trail as they disappear]
[you turn your attention to the lakes edge, the still waters lull you into a trance, years of living on the coast has trained your body's muscle memory to superhuman levels]
[you cast away your underarmor, boots and pants, letting the soft winds of nature kiss your toned form as you dive headfirst into the lake.]
[a few moments underneath the waters and you surface once again with a mighty warcry, Great Speartuna in hand]
[as you drag your bounty to shore, the hair on the back of your neck picks up birds scattering and a great disturbance deeper into the forest]
["Looks like Gore found their meal.."]
[you tie your shorts back on and begin dressing the fish, the blade of your billhook knife glides like your cutting through air as you strip and season the carcass over a fiery grill, toasting it until it peak crispyness]
\>"i'm baaaack" Gore cheers. "i found a big one that actually put up a fight this time!"
[they emerge from the brush, a large dead Aptinoth clutched tightly in their bloody wing-claws]
[they stop suddenly, furiously sniffing the air]
\>"wha-*sniff* what is that?! what smells so good?!"
\>"it smells like..like fish, but way better!"
[they drop the aptinoth with a thud and rush over to your fish, you put your hands firmly on their snout, barely able to hold back the drooling beast]
["its just a fish i grilled, they smell and taste better this way"]
\>"does it work with meat?! please tell me it works with meat! i want tasty meat!" they squeal with excitement
["okay, okay calm down, i'll grill yours up too" you chuckle]
[after offering a small apology to the herbivore you work your magic again, cutting and placing the large slabs of beef over a tiny grill]
[You can tell Gore is getting impatient as their drooling intensifies, their foreclaws tapping on the ground, tail furiously wagging]
\>"is it done yet, is it done yet?!" they sputter
["just about, here i'll throw some fish on there for you too if you behave"]
[you set down a big plate of food in front of them and you feel like you almost would have lost a finger with how quickly they dig into the pile]
["must've worked up an appetite doing all that hunting"]
[they mutter something in agreement but its hard to make out what they're saying nose deep in food]
["I'll take that as a yes"]
[as you both finish your meals, you decide its time to lie back and relax as the sun starts to set]
[Gore lays down and stretches, licking their claws and chops]
\>"oh man that was good! thanks for hanging out with me again by the way, it means a lot"
["yeah same, too bad we made camp so far away though"]
\>"nah, its okay, here, let me pay you back."
[they unfurl one of their massive wings, inviting you to some shelter. its remarkable that normally something that would be covered in dark frenzy dust now displays a bunch of shiny, clean looking iridescent scales]
\>"i managed to take down that aptinoth earlier without relying on my frenzy at all ya know, i want to prove to everyone that i can survive outside the Frenzy's influence."
\>"i remember the chief wyverian warning me long ago that the Frenzy is like a wildfire that follows me, that its an absolute barrier that harms both friend and foe, and giving into the frenzy is to embody suffering itself"
\>"I've thought about it a lot and how with friends like you that stay by me, if i can master it then i wont have to be alone.
[they lay the side of their head against your chest, the sharp spikes poke you a little]
\>"besides, the Khezu life isn't so bad, I'm super used to it already."
[you both let out a chuckle and you run your hand upon their forehead scales]
\>"Goodnight, good hunter"
["Goodnight"]

###*Malzeno*

=============================================

\>a group of new lance recruits are being trained by a veteran knight for a guild regiment one day
\>suddenly, there's a sharp change in the air followed by people screaming outside of the training grounds
\>the group gets word of an unspecified elder dragon approaching from the skies
\>despite being new recruits, they're all ready to put their lives on the line to protect the rest of the town because that's what lance users do
\>before their teacher can even make a plan of action, the elder dragon swoops down and lands in their courtyard
\>it's a primordial malzeno, his elegant scales glistening with a terrifying intent
\>the teacher readies his lance in a defensive stance, with his trainees following suit
\>this is his first time fighting a malzeno, let alone encountering a primordial one, but he's still ready for anything
\>worries of how his pupils will survive the monster's awesome might flood his mindâ€”
\>the malzeno steps back a bit and takes a stance almost mocking the teacher's, using his wings as a shield and his tail as the lance
\>everyone is at a standstill, uncertain about what they should do
\>the teacher, almost fed up with the malzeno's passiveness, makes a few jabs at the air and slowly walks forward
\>surprisingly, the malzeno copies his movements in a somewhat crude manner
\>the teacher stops, and so does the elder dragon
\>gears start grinding in the teacher's mind, and after seeing the malzeno badly copy a few more of his moves everything begins to make sense somewhat
\>fast forward a couple of days
\>the malzeno has been making great strides in his lance maneuvers alongside his hunter pupils under the teachings of the veteran knight, even becoming a sort of mascot for the group
\>the teacher however keeps wondering what the malzeno will do once it "graduates" and training is complete...

###*Mizutsune*

=============================================

>\>"'Never had you dick sucked by a monster?'"
>\>["What about two monsters?"](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1686/67/1686677250057.jpg)
>\>"Doubtful. Look at him, he looks like he hasn't even gotten a kiss from a monster..."
>\>"I'll give you a kiss, hunter... on your cock."

\>The two tama brothers pin you down and work on your cock like professionals
\>The bubbly one slithered his tongue around your balls and giving them a good squeeze
\>His soapy saliva kept your purse shiny and sensitive
\>His more fiery brother worked on your tip, planting searing kisses on it
\>Making sure the heat reaches to a point you're writhing in pleasure until he lets go before putting it inside his mouth like an oven
\>You didn't last long as your cum covered their slutty faces, licking your entire member with thier hot and cool tongues
\>Next they sandwiched you between their fluff as their rear paws worked on your still sensitive cock
\>Making sure they rub their scent on your face while they whispered honeyed words above you
\>Suddenly you feel something stiff and pulsating against your member
\>Just like you, your little greatsword is sandwiched between their cock
\>Rolling over your length as if they are cleaning brushes
\>You can't help but thrust against them as if it is a woman's lower lips
\>The two smirked and expertly grabbed their own cocks and sandwiched them tight around yours
\>Words of encouragement were muffled as you pretended you were breeding some monster fuckhole
\>You passed out somewhere at around your fourth orgasm
\>Wake to find yourself squeaky clean but covered in singed kiss marks around your body except your crotch

\>forced to attend a stupid mandatory M.A.R.E. (monster abuse resistance education) meeting
\>everyone already knows monsterfucking has risks and these cringy-ass presentations aren't going to convince anyone to change their mind
\>once everyone's seated some dumb "how do you do fellow hunters"-level hiphop music starts blasting from a cheap-sounding hunting horn
\>a group of people run out, all dressed in various monster disguise armor sets, acting like they're Gog's gift to coolness
\>along with a Jagras dressed up in a t-shirt and backwards-ballcap - obviously their "mascot", who clearly looks like it would rather be anywhere else right now
\>the feeling's mutual, little guy
\>"WHAT'S WIGGLIN', MUH GIGGIS" the head dudebro type in a Jaggi set yells, clearly expecting a roaring cheer in response
