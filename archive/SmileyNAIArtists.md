## Uh?
Rentry to list authors that perform decently in the latest NAI image generation model.

**25 steps - 5 guidance - DDIM**

Most of the artists were tested with different prompts to find an optimal result.

!!! note
     NSFW is not my priority, so I will be adding samples more slowly.
	All generations were generated with a x2 strength {{TAG}}. (I don't know if it is exactly x2, but I can't think of a better way to explain it now).

## How to use
The simplest and most recommended way to use this kind of styles is to literally put =={{%ARTIST%}}== as a tag inside the prompt, depending on the artist and the prompt used it can look more or less marked.

It is also possible to "combine" styles between two or three artists, I leave this to your experimentation as it would be impossible to test and organize each one individually.

## Glossary
Easy way to go from one point in the list to another.

### [Doppel (Bonnypir)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=doppel_(bonnypir))
It's not 100% true to the original style, but it's one of my favorite results even though you need a little bit of trickery to get good results.

### [Zaphn](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zaphn)
Seems to work a lot better on bikinis... for obvious reasons. Also add watermarks from time to time.

### [Sincos](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=sincos)
Many of the generations give back lewd...it's not like it's a problem lol.

### [rakeemspoon](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rakeemspoon)
Lovely style, no more to say.
![rakeemspoon](https://files.catbox.moe/eg6xmb.png)

### [moshimoshibe](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=moshimoshibe)
It is somewhat... difficult to handle from time to time, but most of the time it delivers good or at least decent results.
![moshimoshibe](https://files.catbox.moe/ukb5q2.png)

### [shexyo](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=shexyo)
It likes to generate cute outfits if small boobs, and likes more lewd one for big boobs, no more to say.
![shexyo](https://files.catbox.moe/1mo1u8.png)

### [ray-k](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=ray-k)
The art style from that game... yeah. Returns pretty good results without much effort lol.
![ray-k](https://files.catbox.moe/4t2rak.png)

### [toraishi_666](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=toraishi_666)
It can mimic the style, but the model becomes too schizo most of the time.
![toraishi_666](https://files.catbox.moe/jjj3tw.png)

### [asanagi](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=Asanagi)
Nice... and lewd.
![asanagi](https://files.catbox.moe/8e71z7.png)

### [zankuro](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zankuro)
A rather... cute style. May generate lolis if not specified (Loli Fubuki was not something I wanted to see today).
![zankuro](https://files.catbox.moe/oyvdcq.png)

### [cutesexyrobutts](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=cutesexyrobutts)
The art style is quite marked and aesthetically... cool, but it fucks up the hands basically every time and in most generations includes a malformed watermark.
![cutesexyrobutts](https://files.catbox.moe/z48v0v.png)

### [kagami hirotaka](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=kagami_hirotaka)
Quite clean styling with a noticeable taste for lips.
![kagami hirotaka](https://files.catbox.moe/6nqkrd.png)

### [megateru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=megateru)
It has a rather odd consistency and takes on the style in a variety of ways, you decide whether you like it or not.
![megateru](https://files.catbox.moe/5ct8pq.png)

### [jasony](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=jasony)
It's kind of hard to get specific poses with this... probably just skill issue ngl. The artist likes bikinis, the model probably handles better generations with them.
![jasony](https://files.catbox.moe/5xxczx.png)

### [greatm8](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=greatm8)
It tries to imitate the 2D/3D style of the artist in a curious but successful way, I'll probably use it more lol.
![greatm8](https://files.catbox.moe/qesvjh.png)

### [ratatatat74](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=ratatatat74)
I love this style and the model knows how to handle it quite well.... it didn't take me long to get good generations.

### [40hara](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=40hara)
Nice style that the model has no difficulty in recreating.
