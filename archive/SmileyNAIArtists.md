## Uh?
Rentry to list authors that perform decently in the latest NAI image generation model.
Images sponsored by Tatsumaki and Fubuki.
**25 steps - 5 guidance - DDIM**

Most of the artists were tested with different prompts to find an optimal result.

!!! note
     NSFW is not my priority, so I will be adding samples more slowly.
	All generations were generated with a x2 strength {{TAG}}. (I don't know if it is exactly x2, but I can't think of a better way to explain it now).

## How to use
The simplest and most recommended way to use this kind of styles is to literally put =={{%ARTIST%}}== or =={{%ARTIST% (style)}}== or =={{Artist: %ARTIST%}}== as a tag inside the prompt, depending on the artist and the prompt used it can look more or less marked.

It is also possible to "combine" styles between two or three artists, I leave this to your experimentation as it would be impossible to test and organize each one individually.

## Glossary
Easy way to go from one point in the list to another.

### [Doppel (Bonnypir)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=doppel_(bonnypir))
It's not 100% true to the original style, but it's one of my favorite results even though you need a little bit of trickery to get good results.

![Doppel (Bonnypir)](https://files.catbox.moe/4ca82w.png)

### [Zaphn](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zaphn)
Seems to work a lot better on bikinis... for obvious reasons. Also add watermarks from time to time.
![Zaphn](https://files.catbox.moe/7zrgeq.png)

### [Sincos](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=sincos)
Many of the generations give back lewd...it's not like it's a problem lol.
![Sincos](https://files.catbox.moe/uzh0y9.png)

### [rakeemspoon](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=rakeemspoon)
Lovely style, no more to say.
![rakeemspoon](https://files.catbox.moe/eg6xmb.png)

### [moshimoshibe](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=moshimoshibe)
It is somewhat... difficult to handle from time to time, but most of the time it delivers good or at least decent results.
![moshimoshibe](https://files.catbox.moe/ukb5q2.png)

### [shexyo](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=shexyo)
It likes to generate cute outfits if small boobs, and likes more lewd one for big boobs, no more to say.
![shexyo](https://files.catbox.moe/1mo1u8.png)

### [ray-k](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=ray-k)
The art style from that game... yeah. Returns pretty good results without much effort lol.
![ray-k](https://files.catbox.moe/4t2rak.png)

### [toraishi_666](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=toraishi_666)
It can mimic the style, but the model becomes too schizo most of the time.
![toraishi_666](https://files.catbox.moe/jjj3tw.png)

### [asanagi](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=Asanagi)
Nice... and lewd.
![asanagi](https://files.catbox.moe/8e71z7.png)

### [zankuro](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zankuro)
A rather... cute style. May generate lolis if not specified (Loli Fubuki was not something I wanted to see today).
![zankuro](https://files.catbox.moe/oyvdcq.png)

### [cutesexyrobutts](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=cutesexyrobutts)
The art style is quite marked and aesthetically... cool, but it fucks up the hands basically every time and in most generations includes a malformed watermark.
![cutesexyrobutts](https://files.catbox.moe/z48v0v.png)

### [kagami hirotaka](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=kagami_hirotaka)
Quite clean styling with a noticeable taste for lips.
![kagami hirotaka](https://files.catbox.moe/6nqkrd.png)

### [megateru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=megateru)
It has a rather odd consistency and takes on the style in a variety of ways, you decide whether you like it or not.
![megateru](https://files.catbox.moe/5ct8pq.png)

### [jasony](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=jasony)
It's kind of hard to get specific poses with this... probably just skill issue ngl. The artist likes bikinis, the model probably handles better generations with them.
![jasony](https://files.catbox.moe/5xxczx.png)

### [greatm8](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=greatm8)
It tries to imitate the 2D/3D style of the artist in a curious but successful way, I'll probably use it more lol.
![greatm8](https://files.catbox.moe/qesvjh.png)

### [ratatatat74](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=ratatatat74)
I love this style and the model knows how to handle it quite well.... it didn't take me long to get good generations.
[NSFW Generations](https://files.catbox.moe/n5161b.png)
![ratatatat74](https://files.catbox.moe/b4p42y.png)

### [40hara](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=40hara)
Nice style that the model has no difficulty in recreating.
![40hara](https://files.catbox.moe/w97miw.png)

### [usa37107692](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=usa37107692)
Pretty unique style, the model can understand it well but usually has a few problems with the hands, but I'm surprised how well it works lol.
![usa37107692](https://files.catbox.moe/4w50u7.png)

### [bee_(deadflow)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=bee_(deadflow))
I did not specify any outfit in the prompt and these were the results. Enjoy.
I recommend using the tags ==bee, animal, wings, tail== to avoid failed generations as the word bee often confuses NAI.
![bee_(deadflow)](https://files.catbox.moe/rtr7f3.png)

### [dev_dev(0614)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=dev_(dev0614))
Probably one of the styles that gave me the least trouble overall. Recommended :DumbSmile:
![dev_(dev0614)](https://files.catbox.moe/mp9m8l.png)

### [riyo_(lyomsnpmp)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=riyo_(lyomsnpmp))
Silly artist style. The model has some problems imitating his style while giving decent results.
In case you want the chibi style, I recommend adding these tags to the promp and generating several times ==chibi, absurdres==, add ==1girl== to the prompt if your generation is of single characters.
![riyo_(lyomsnpmp)](https://files.catbox.moe/22fhng.png)

### [Konpeto](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=Konpeto)
The model suffers a bit with this style, especially with the hands, but overall it handles well. As a bonus, I love how NAI always goes horny mode when watching Fubuki.
![Konpeto 1](https://files.catbox.moe/8t5v7x.png)

### [alexi_(tits!)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=alexi_(tits!))
Style focused on large breasts, it took a little to get Tatsumaki's anatomy decently, Fubuki on the other hand... well.
![alexi_(tits!)](https://files.catbox.moe/bqbk11.png)

### [pepe_(jonasan)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=pepe_(jonasan))
Artist style of milfs here. I expected it to be more difficult to use, but it's probably the easiest of the whole list so far. Also new personal favorite.
I took a little more time with the second generation of Fubuki to... test the capabilities of the model.
![pepe_(jonasan)](https://files.catbox.moe/hsk29m.png)

### [tianliang_duohe_fangdongye](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=tianliang_duohe_fangdongye)
Another favorite style to add to the list... easy to use but seems to be more focused on small bodies and can become watermarked in unspecific generations.
If your character has a chest that is not small or flat, add the tag ==medium breast== or ==big breast== to get the results you expect.
![tianliang_duohe_fangdongye](https://files.catbox.moe/hag7p3.png)

### [shikuta_maru](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=shikuta_maru)
This style is one of the best that gets the anatomy of both Fubuki and Tatsumaki just right. How is this being a day of adding favorites to my list.
 ![shikuta_maru](https://files.catbox.moe/c9y5yx.png)

### [nyuu_(manekin-eko)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=nyuu_(manekin-eko))
NAI struggles a bit to generate coherent poses but follows the style well enough.
![nyuu_(manekin-eko)](https://files.catbox.moe/fbvkaw.png)

### [akatsuki_myuuto](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=akatsuki_myuuto)
One of the easiest styles to handle with simple prompts.
![akatsuki_myuuto](https://files.catbox.moe/hxcz72.png)

### [mimonel](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=mimonel)
The artist draws mostly hentai, take that into mind.
![mimonel](https://files.catbox.moe/7aovox.png)

### [fan_no_hitori](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=fan_no_hitori)
I don't know how faithful the style is to the original... but it gives good results so it doesn't matter.
![fan_no_hitori](https://files.catbox.moe/bwe961.png)

### [aitsuwu](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=aitsuwu)
Quite simple style and without much complexity to work with.
![aitsuwu](https://files.catbox.moe/0ep42b.png)

### [as109](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=as109)
Style that likes to mark the nipples through the clothes and also give a small breast to Fubuki.
![as109](https://files.catbox.moe/ou8ywr.png)

### [alphonse_(white_datura)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=alphonse_(white_datura))
Most likely he will fuck up one of the two hands in the generation, but style is so good that it doesn't really matter that much lol.
![alphonse_(white_datura)](https://files.catbox.moe/n203vl.png)

### [vanripper](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=vanripper)
Helltaker artist, pretty cool style with the problem that one hand can have more than 10 fingers at a time.
![vanripper](https://files.catbox.moe/3kcg60.png)

### [bb_(baalbuddy)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=bb_(baalbuddy))
Comic book style, expect mostly black and white generations.
![bb_(baalbuddy)](https://files.catbox.moe/9yrlxq.png)

### [focke_wulf](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=focke_wulf)
The first image of Tatsumaki is probably one of my favorite generations in as long as I've been making this list. If your character has a medium/large breast, specify in the prompt ==big breast== or ==medium breast==, not entirely necessary but recommended.
![focke_wulf](https://files.catbox.moe/1ik46q.png)

### [moisture_(chichi)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=moisture_(chichi))
If you like thick bodies and milfs, this is probably your style, also holy fuck was it hard to get a non-lewd generation for Fubuki.
