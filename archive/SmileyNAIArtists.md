## Uh?
Rentry to list authors that perform decently in the latest NAI image generation model.
Images sponsored by Tatsumaki and Fubuki.
**25 steps - 5 guidance - DDIM**

Most of the artists were tested with different prompts to find an optimal result.

!!! note
     NSFW is not my priority, so I will be adding samples more slowly.
	All generations were generated with a x2 strength {{TAG}}. (I don't know if it is exactly x2, but I can't think of a better way to explain it now).

### [Doppel (Bonnypir)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=doppel_(bonnypir))
It's not 100% true to the original style, but it's one of my favorite results even though you need a little bit of trickery to get good results.

### [Zaphn](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zaphn)
Seems to work a lot better on bikinis... for obvious reasons. Also add watermarks from time to time.

### [Sincos](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=sincos)
Many of the generations give back lewd...it's not like it's a problem lol.

### [moshimoshibe](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=moshimoshibe)
It is somewhat... difficult to handle from time to time, but most of the time it delivers good or at least decent results.

### [shexyo](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=shexyo)
It likes to generate cute outfits if small boobs, and likes more lewd one for big boobs, no more to say.

### [ray-k](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=ray-k)
The art style from that game... yeah. Returns pretty good results without much effort lol.

### [toraishi_666](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=toraishi_666)
It can mimic the style, but the model becomes too schizo most of the time.

### [asanagi](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=Asanagi)
Nice... and lewd.

### [zankuro](https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=zankuro)
A rather... cute style. May generate lolis if not specified (Loli Fubuki was not something I wanted to see today).
