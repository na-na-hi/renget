**Link's detention**
>I'm really disappointed in you, Link
>how could you screw this test up so bad?
>you've been studying for months and you still know nothing about our kingdom!
>our official language is not Portuguese and it never was!
>our chief export is not tungsten! there is no tungsten here!
>our capital city is not Winnipeg!
>in fact, it's pretty much the opposite of Winnipeg!
>our national pastime is not motorcycle repair, it's horseback riding!
>I'm starting to think you're failing these tests deliberately because you enjoy being sent to the breeding pens as punishment!
>well, from now on, you're stuck here breeding me!
>until you start taking these tests seriously, I'm gonna wring you out like a wet sock after every class!
>also, stop drawing naked pictures of me on the chalkboard, I know it's you!
>my butt is not that big!

**Link and Tetra's unborn firstborn**
>hey Link, remember that night at sea?
>we got drunk and took a bath in a rainbarrel under a shinin' Moon
>and then we made loud sloppy love for hours
>the crew didn't say anything but I bet they all heard
>we spied land that morning and we had good luck ever since
>I think we're having a son
>I think he's gonna be a sailor
>an' I bet he'll spend his days traveling to distant lands and loving strange women
>one day he'll sail home an' he'll step ashore with a black-skinned woman on his arm
>or maybe a Zora princess
>maybe even a Deku maiden, who knows?
>our boys will carry our name and our blood to the far corners of the world
>I'm hungry again, can you cook up some burgers?

**Young Link gets the ara ara treatment**
>I don't rightly know how we did it, girls, but we brought Young Link forward in time!
>that means we get seven years of watching the little guy grow up into the fucking machine we all love!

>I vote for myself, Link and I have a lot of horseback riding to catch up on!

>n-no! he's supposed to rule Zora's Domain with me!
>we even got married, just ask him!

>well, I'm the princess of Hyrule and I say I have the royal right to take the virginity of any boy I choose, and I choose Link!
>w-what do you mean, he's not a virgin?!
>who the hell is Saria?!

>hah! I promised him a special gift that I never got the chance to give him, and he's getting it tonight with interest!
>y'know, Malon, you mighta taught him to ride

>I know he likes my big butt and soft belly, but don't worry
>I've seen how he looks at you and I know it's true love!
>he fucks my brains out all the time but you're the one he wants to grow old with
>oh, I've tried, but I just couldn't steal him away
>I've kissed him as deeply and lovingly as I could
>tried imprinting the smell of my hair and pussy on him
