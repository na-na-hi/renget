# Red Ogre Relationship Chart
# The Great Seething
##Team 1:
>Natsuo Uchiha

!!! note “Natsusu! He is so cool, an’ strong, an’ hot! Nothin’ unexpected from the prestigious Uchiha! Waaah! I would like him more if he was my sensei!”
She greatly respects Natsuo as a prestigious member of one of the founding clans of Konoha, holding in high esteem even if the Uchiha and Red Ogre styles of waging war are radically different.
!!! danger  “Tsc. If only he were my sensei. I only have Shimakuburo-dono as a fellow Konoha nin in my own team. It is disgusting the fact we end in a team with two outsiders.”
Because of his status as a great ninja of Konoha, Nodao feels a little bitter and cheated because she ended up in a team of “Outsiders”, and resents that her teacher is “not as good” as someone like Natsuo.
>D:

!!! info “Hm. His rap is kinda cool, but he is kinda hard to tolerate when he starts braggin’.”
Has no real opinion over D besides the fact he was “adopted” into Konoha as to say. She may poke fun and try to prank him as a form to get a little revenge for him ending in a Konoha team she wanted to be in.
Besides that, she finds him enjoyable because his lightning reminds her of Blue Ogres and blue ogres are worthy opponents, making him a person she would enjoy being around even when sober.
>Himari Miko:

!!! info “Himaaaari-chan! It is you! Can you give me some of that medicine? Pretty please? Pretty please? I want it! I want it! Oh! You will give it to me? Thank yooou!”
Genuinely enjoys her presence and the “baptism” she does to her drink, besides a small medical care here and there when Nodao went “Overboard” while training years ago, making her earn a few “scratches” as to say, making Himari one of Nodao’s favorite people.
Nodao will refuse any confrontation and battle against Team 1 in the initial stages of the Chunin test solely because of Himari’s presence, as well as not allowing any other team to dare to damage them, even if it means clashing against her current teammates.
!!! warning “Konoha is our family, and Himari is my friend. She is a friend and family. None shall hurt her. And her friends.”
>Takeru Suzuki:

!!! note “Never was one to read stuff, but it is kinda neat? He is a tad too quick for me, but he is not a bad chap.”
Finds him a little too overwhelming to talk with, but enjoys his presence as much as she can enjoy being around the average Konoha nin. Everything he speaks and topics he brings up flies by her head, although.

##Team 2:
!!! warning “Osamu sensei! How are you! It is nice to see you! The weather is  nice, isn’t it?” 
> Thunder falls as a storm rages.
Nodao will try to act friendly and hide her true intentions behind her happy-go-luck self, and her cheerful demeanor, acting as the perfect teacher’s pet and a good student to get as far away from Osamu as she (physically) can while doing the team assignments and missions.
!!! danger “Stuck with a weakling bastard instead of a warrior of Konoha…  Hell, even a genjutsu master would be a better teacher. I hope he dies a painful death, a pathetic little bastard deserves nothing more than that.”
Beyond him being an outsider, he is Nodao’s teacher. Nodao feels cheated of what should be rightfully hers (a team alongside other Konoha-born ninjas with a cool Konoha teacher), forcing her to turn to harder drinkers and in bigger quantities to keep her temper and persona in check, lest she gives away into uncontrollable wrath over her situation. She is overwhelmingly bitter about her situation, complaining openly to Shimakuburo about how unsatisfied and angry she is about the rest of their team.
>Shimakuburo Fumio:

!!! info “Shimakuburo-san! It is you. I have brought some drinks and snacks for us to kill time while waiting for the others. How is your train going? I tried to ask some Blue Ogres for enhancing medicine and drinks, but I couldn’t get it because I’m still a genin… I’m sorry.”
The only one she likes in her team. Nodao respects his determination and resilience, and because of that, she is willing to push Shimakuburo as far as she can in the chunin exams. At least he will be a chunin before his death, this much Nodao will try to guarantee with all of her skill.
!!! note “It is sad to see someone with so much determination fall and fail, but I won’t allow it. This time he will win. He has to. I won’t allow my teammate to fail one last time.
Even if they barely know each other, Nodao respects his determination and self. He is also the only one in Team 2 Nodao sees as a friend, openly telling him her grievances and disappointments towards the team.
>Kichona:

!!! warning “Hi Kichona-san! I… huh…”
Even for a happy-go-lucky Nodao, Kichona is a mystery she can’t approach or understand, failing to do the barest social interactions besides the weird talks Osamu has with her and her overall creepy demeanor. 
!!! warning “How someone talk to her?"
Nodao is disappointed that instead of a second teammate, she has some weird person-thing who is hard to communicate with and understand.
>Nodao
She wants to help Shimakuburo become a chunin, but she holds no desire to help Kichona or even pass this exam. Nodao is doing it merely because Shimakuburo wishes to do it and for a darker reason.
She wants to fail this exam on purpose and get rid of her status as a Team 2 Member, so she can go for the chunin exam the next year with a team of her fancy, or with a better teammate than Kichona. She knows that passing the chunin exam with Kichona won’t dissolve the team dynamics or set her free from those outsiders’ presence, so she hopes to fail and dissolve the team to never ever see those two again.

##Team 3:

!!! danger “I don’t know  much about them, only that they are from other villages. A ragtag bunch of misfits and a traitor. Blagh. Why care about them.”

##Team 4:
>Kiko Inuzuka:
!!! info “Kiko-sama is nuts! She endured for long in that hell-infested village! Not even the Blue Ogres managed to get a good foot in Uzushio before having to retreat! I heard her squad was one of the legends! They got in that hell hole and survived! Us Red Ogres even refused to set foot on Uzushio! SO COOOL!”
Kiko is a hero in Nodao’s eyes, the young Red Ogre hoping to be “half as good” as her idol in battle. Because of Uzushio’s… uniqueness in combat, even her tribe and the Blue Ogres refused to engage in an open all-out battle against Uzushio, preferring to be shipped off to “more dangerous places” than face the wrath of the Uzumaki.
The fact Kiko managed to fight, and not only fight but also survive the ordeal, solidified her as a one-of-a-kind idol in Nodao’s eyes. She is not disappointed in Kiko’s situation after the war, rather, she respects her even more for going back into the ninja career after such a gruesome war.
>Remilia Orochimaru:

!!! info “She is like Himari, but she is easy to tease. Nope, I shall save Remilia for myself. Himari will tease her to death. Her accent is so cute too!”
While Nodao doesn’t have a deep connection with Remilia, she appreciates her presence as a medic-nin, knowing their worth because of the times Himari patched her up. Because they both are cheerful and energetic, they go easy around each other, playing and goofing around the village in their free time, overall one of Nodao’s friends.
>Itami Nanae:

!!! note “A guy from Uzushio, wants to restore his clan. Hmm, Uzushio and Konoha were sisters’ villages, and since Konoha is our family, does it mean he is my cousin? Douji cousin? Hmmm…”
Nodao lacks the necessary brainpower to decide if he is an outsider or part of the Konoha family, it can make her freeze over and just zone out near him, trying to decide how she should act near him, which in turn fuels his delusion that every girl is in love with him.
Nodao appreciates his focus on CQC for a Ninja, the only time she will talk straight with him and act normally without the mental fog brought by confusion.
>Kazen Uzumaki:

!!! note “He exists, I guess. Also Uzumaki.”

##Team 5:
>Ezaki Tuto:

!!! note “I haven’t heard much from him, despite the fact he is a war hero. I wonder, what he did to gain his reputation? He also is kinda hot with all those bandages.”
She has an interest in what he did in the war, but for now, she is far too green in Konoha’s ranks to know exactly what he did to earn his fame.
>Jin Hyuuga:

!!! info “I have found Jin multiple times while playing with Remilia, when he is out of duty he joins in too! I like him! He knows how to make a game fun! It is so sad he is too young to drink… I would love to introduce him to some Red Ogre alcohol…”
She loves being around Jin. She would kill Kichona any day if it meant replacing her with Jin because of how enjoyable his personality and self are. Nodao particularly likes his jokes and humor.
!!! danger “Why did we end in a team with those two freaks, instead of a pure Konoha team, Shimakuburo-dono?”
>Shinro Kamatai:

!!! info “I thought he would be one of those monks when I first saw him, but he is such a light-hearted fellow! He even can drink Red Ogre alcohol with me! Monks tend to hate us of the Douji, but nope! He is cool with us! I am cool with him too!”
One of the best people to calm down and improve Nodao’s mood by existing. While Nodao had some misconceptions about his nature and personality at first, it was quickly washed away when they met and shared some conversation, with Nodao even allowing him to taste some of her drink, suffice to say the result of tasting an Ogre’s alcohol was wild. They tend to spar together a lot because of their combat views: enjoying themselves in combat, making the battlefield a playground (Nodao), and making it a canvas (Shinro).
>Yuma:

!!! danger “I don’t like her much desu. She has something that doesn’t belong to her desu.”
Nodao nurtures active malice and hatred towards Yuma, contrary to D who strikes her fancy by reminding her of Blue Ogres and being fun to look at, Yuma is nothing but a pest for Nodao, and her personality makes it even worse. The fact she is in a team full of Konoha-nin and Nodao is not, makes her blood boil hotter than her distaste of her own team.
!!! danger “I hope I can kill you.”
