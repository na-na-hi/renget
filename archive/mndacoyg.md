#Kichōna's Friendship Chart
***

>Natsuo
"Mr Natsuo is really cool! Papa says he has SPECIAL EYES! I bet they're really pretty! Other kids say he's a good teacher and some kinda hero, too!"
(She was not told this by other kids. She eavesdropped.)

>D
"He's a boy from Kumo, right? Papa said that we might've moved there, but we went to Konoha instead. I dunno the reason why. I like the way D talks! He's funny, and kinda cool!"

>Himari
"She's really nice to me! The Miko visited Papa for something, and she let me play with her! I think she's sweet!"
(There was no playing. Kichōna pestered her the entire time.)

>Takeru
"He's pretty cool! He likes to go fast, and we became friends after I showed him my rocket-boosters! We don't hang out much. It's hard to find him."
(She once crashed into him while using her rockets. That is the only time they ever interacted.)

>Osamu
"Papa's the best! He's really cool, and the other kids look up to him, and he always has time to play with me! I wanna be like him when I grow up!"
(Most of the other kids do not look up to him. There are a few that are based/weird enough that actually do, though.)

>Shimabukuro
"Uncle Shima's great! He tells me funny stories about when he was younger! I know he can be a great Chunin! We'll be great ninjas together!"
(Don't let her down, Shimabukuro.)

>Nodao
"Nodao's awesome! She's my best friend! We always talk to each other in training, and I try and keep up with her! Papa says I can't drink her special drink, though."
(Nodao gets her ear talked off by Kichōna a lot, and likely does not know how to respond. I don't think she's warming up to her.)

>Kamiko
"I don't see Ms Kamiko a lot. I heard she's a really good doctor like Papa, though! And there's something about a Gingereeky, which Papa says is like being sick. I hope she gets better."

>Masukada
"I don't see Masu a lot, either. She seems sad. Papa says there's a sad kinda sick, too. I hope she gets better. Maybe that's why Ms Kamiko is her teacher?"

>Ichika
"Hee hee, Ichika's really sweet! She plays with me and the younger kids, but she isn't in Konoha very often, so it's rare. I heard she wanted to be a kunoichi really badly, like me! We'll be kunoichi together!"
(Ichika may be one of the few tard wranglers who might actually like Kichōna.)

>Kita
"Kita seems sad. I wanna make him happy! He's in Konoha, so it should be easy! Maybe he has that same kinda sad-sick as Masu? I wonder if Papa has a cure? ...Why'd they put so many sick people on a team? Ichika has her hands full..."
(Osamu likely is not qualified to give anti-depressants.)

>Kiko
"I... I don't think Ms Kiko likes me... I don't know why..."
(The one person who Kichōna can absolutely tell does not like her. She's heartbroken.)

>Remilia
"Remilia's really nice, she's one of my friends! I think she looks up to Papa! Probably 'cause Papa is so cool!"
(Kichōna thinks they are closer than they probably actually are.)

>Itami
"I think Itami is pretty cool! I think it's kinda cute that he's looking for a girlfriend! But... Papa told me to stay away from him. I don't know why."
(Osamu is probably one of the worst In-Laws you can have, in all honesty.)

>Kazen
"Kazen's funny! I like his jokes. But, sometimes... he gets this creepy look. I can tell. I wonder what kinda sick he has? I hope he gets better."
(Despite being schizophrenic, Kichōna CAN tell when someone is emotionally distraught! It's her secret gift. Can't tell when people don't like her, though.)

>Ezaki
"Hee hee, I like Mr Ezaki! He's both funny AND cool! I like to hear his stories, they're always so neat!"
(She stalks him on occasion because he's funny and it's like watching a Saturday Morning Cartoon.)

>Jin
"Woah, now that I think about it, Jin's a LOT like Mr Ezaki! They're both funny AND cool! The guys who picked the teams must have really put some thought in them!"

>Shinrō
"Pfft... HEE HEE HEE! He's BALD! That's *so* funny!"
(She likes him, but all she can think about him is him being bald. It's funny.)

>Yuma
"Ok, so, apparently, Yuma needs to wear an eyepatch, BUT, she can see? Papa says it's because of one of those really cool eyes! But... what's the point of a really cool eye if you need to wear an eyepatch...?"
(Same deal as Shinrō. She likes them, but one weird thing always throws her off when talking about them.)

>Tsugumi
"I really like Ms Tsugumi's eyes! She's also really sweet, and she and I can talk for a really long time!"
(Kichōna has spewed streams of schizophrenic babble at her a couple times. Jury's out on if Tsugumi bothered to record any of that nonsense.)

>Ghidorah
"I really like Ghidorah, for some reason! Maybe it's because he uses Puppets like Papa, or maybe it's because he also has Clay Dolls like me!"
(Yes, she's talking about Homonculi Clay. The real reason she likes him is because she subconsciously realizes that they are both treated like freaks!)

>Junki
"I think Junki's really kind! I can tell that he really loves animals, like me! I don't like being out in nature, though... it makes me feel lonely... being surrounded by buildings and Puppets is WAY better!"
(Kichōna is the type to rip apart a dead animal because she's confused on what happened to it and wants to put it back together, but she has actually never killed a small animal by being a schizo. She has a very low animal kill count; all resulting from stepping on bugs and snails by accident and then crying for hours about it.)

>Sen
"I like her, and she's really sweet, but she confuses me. All the cool shinobi fight! That's what being a ninja is all about! Pew, pew!"
(Her empathy for animals does not extend to human beings, who she would be just fine with killing. She is already numb to the idea of killing someone, or combat. No issues could POSSIBLY arise from this.)

>Darkbone
"I'm sad. Papa says I can't hang out with Darkbone! He says that his weird scorpion is an o-melon, or whatever. What's up with that?"

>Taihō
"Hee hee! A little birdy told me that Taihō has a crush! Aww, I think that's cute...! I... don't think we've actually talked, though? That has to change! Oh, he has Gingereeky, too. I hope he gets better."
(Lol. Lmao.)

>Ahiratsu
"Hee hee, she looks funny AND cute! I love her colors! Oh, Papa got a D-onion-A sample from her. I don't know what that is. He also seems very confused by her Key-eye Gong-eyes. I don't care. I like to play with her. She's such a mystery!"
(Ahiratsu likely does not like her very much, in turn. Maybe she feels a sort of alien connection, though? Machina Ex IS Otsutsuki related.)

>Kuro
"Woah, she reminds me of Darkbone! She's really cool! I kinda wanna copy her! Shadow Bang! Shadow Pew!"
(No, it has not crossed her mind that she has nothing actually shadow related in her arsenal.)

>Kijyo
"Ms Hokage is SO cool! She's the coolest! I think she's related to Nodao. Less red, though. I wanna be like her when I grow up! I'll be the Hokage!"
(Ah, young dreams...)

>Kamare
"You know what's WEIRD about Kamare? I STILL don't know what village she's from! W-Wait, she's a boy?"

>Barou
"Why are there so many Gingereekys around? I-Is it contagious?"

>Engetsu
"I LOVE Mr Raikage's stories! My favorite's the one with the exploding rice ball! He's so cool! I wanna be like him when I grow up! I'll be the Raikage!"
(She'll have to start her own village, at this rate...)

>Nobutake
"Hee hee, Nobu's pretty cool! But I heard he doesn't know why so many foreigners were allowed in Konoha! Isn't it obvious? Papa did it! He got me in, after all!"
(No, Osamu is not the reason for Konoha's foreign intake. Konoha Clans hate him enough, already.)
