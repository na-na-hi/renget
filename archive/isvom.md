There are not many offices, syndicates, or wings that doesn't know of Milo's Workshop, especially when his lifestyle has him travel across the City on a normal basis, rarely staying put in one location. He offers a wide-array of products for different types of customers, from household appliances to Fixer weapons, from the Backstreets to the Nests, he has a large net of requests to pull from. Not only that, but he is also known to be a Fixer, though he specializes in dealing with Distortions and similar cases.

Not many are aware of his past as a Rat. Milo simply popped up and became recognized through the quality and affordability of his work, his background unknown to anyone except for those with extensive information networks.

(-55) That is that and this is this, Backstreet Ghost, Urban Movement
(-35) The Wanted Mindset, Extreme Survivalist
(-40) Little Sun II, Seeing the Problem
Milo is still very much the resilient, slippery junk salesman he was before, just older, smarter, and debatably wiser. "Junk" is also debatable. He is not as good at the scurrying as he was when he was younger and smaller, but he knows how to skip town when someone's after him without being tracked. Although he has taken up a new career ever since becoming an Artificer and awakening his EGO...

(-60) Standard Combat Style II [Spear], Unique Combat Style III [Trap Setting]
Can Milo fight now? Yes, actually. He knows how to wield a spear, keeping enemies at bay with custom-made spear. On top of this, he is still skilled in the art of trap laying and given time to prepare, they are quite a menace to unsuspecting foes. He can retreat behind his traps while distracting his foes with his spear, or if he has the initiative, push his opponents towards his traps to get a greater advantage.

(-120) "Lost the Patent", Field Mod
Ever since being introduced to the wider world of Fixers and Workshops, Milo has developed quite a bit an "ego" when it comes to artificery, proclaiming himself among the greatest Artificers in the City. Of course, as much as other artificers despise his arrogance, they can't deny that he is, in fact, on a completely different level considering his age. Many workshops, offices, syndicates, and even Wings are desperate to have him join their group, some even making attempts on his life to make sure he doesn't work for their rivals.

(-55) I'm Also a Fixer, Tres Association backing
(-100) "Fixing Issues" x2 [Detective, Weak Point Analysis, Association Contact x2(Seven, Oufi)]
On top of his Artificer work, he has taken up being a Fixer on the side. Although he takes on ordinary requests that deal with combat, he specializes in dealing with Distortions, mostly the prevention of and the "pacification" of them. While "pacification" usually means the termination of the Distorted, he has been able to save some of them through his newfound abilities by solving and reversing the source of their distortion. Much of his work with Distortions have also led him to have an amicable relationship with Seven, needing their intelligence to help investigate the target's past and possibly make a breakthrough in solving their issues. He also has contacts within both Oufi and Tres, being given sponsors, requests, and finances from time to time.

>Equipment
(-70) High Quality III Weapon: Tesla Pike
The final model of Milo's Tesla Wonder. When deactivated, it appears as a simple metal staff, useful for traveling on foot. When activated, a blade of plasma extends out and can be used as a spear. Much of the old functions have been stripped, but he has added a powerful ability which lets him shift and manipulate the blade at will, allowing him to counter attempts of dodging or bypassing defenses by going around them.
(-200) Objet D'arte Armor: Nano Faraday Suit
Long gone are the days of Milo's disheveled and ratty appearance... he has refined his wardrobe and this particular suit is his finest. At a glance, it is a fine suit of Nuovo Fabric with all the benefits it entails, however, he has improved on it significantly. Within the fabric are nanomachines which hardens in response to physical trauma, providing much stronger defense than "ordinary" Nuovo Fabric. But that's not all. The nanomachines can also be manipulated at will to come together and form electronics, weapons, stronger shields, and tools. The nanomachines also act as lightning rods, giving Milo resistance to electricity based attacks.

>Misc
(-70) Vehicle 3: BLINK Board
His old hoverboard made with salvaged G-Corp and W-Corp technologies. The G-Corp tech allows it to hover a meter or two, though it may drop speed in rougher terrain, while the W-Corp tech allows it to teleport several meters away. He doesn't use it as often due to needing to stick around his new van, but it still comes in handy when the van is parked in a safe location.
(-50) Vehicle 2: Mobile Workshop
A van with pink neon lights on the right side spelling "MILO". The left side can open up and act as a storefront. Inside are most of the tools and equipment he needs for Artificer work, though certain higher-end requests will still require an actual Workshop or to have him remain stationary for much longer to make up for his lack of bigger equipment.

>Enhancements
(-100) Tier IV Cybernetics: ORACLE
Milo's upgraded cybernetic right eye. Prior to the upgrade, the eye showed a HUD which, so long as he knew what it was and its functions, identified items he was looking at and revealed its schematics and the separate parts used to make it. It could also change sights between normal, infrared, and nightvision. It has been improved significantly, being able to identify information beyond its original: it could identify an object's chemical composition, weight and dimensions, and it could also identify people, their names and information (if Milo possesses that knowledge). However, its new strongest function is its ability to calculate something's movement according to its velocity, weight, etc, allowing Milo to predict something or someone's movements.

(-30) Tier I Cybernetic: Memory Brain Implant
A cybernetic implant in his brain, hooked directly to his eye. It helps store and disseminate information the he has seen before, though it also helps with processing new information.

Resonant Dagger
Milo's EGO manifests itself as a stone dagger. Its stone blade phases through whoever it stabs, not leaving any physical damage, only affecting the target's and Milo's psyche by resonating both to the same point. Depending on the state of the target, the dagger can cause different effects:
On an ordinary person, it heightens their emotion to the same point as Milo, enough that they can temporarily awaken an incomplete form of their EGO. This does not remove the danger of that person Distorting.
On another EGO user, Milo's psyche resonates with theirs, allowing the dagger to mimic the abilities of the other EGO, although not as strong and not as far-reaching if the original had the ability.
On a Distortion, both psyche's resonate towards each other, allowing both to understand each other on an emotional level. Once connected, it is easier for Milo to reverse the Distortion, but he still needs to put in the work to solve the Distortion's issues.

Milo awakened his EGO when most of his former Rat gang, akin to family for him, had died, and the remaining survivor had fallen to despair and distorted. Milo, too, was close to distorting, but his desire to save his last family member was stronger. With his new EGO, he managed to save his family, and henceforth decided to use it to save more.
