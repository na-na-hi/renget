Much like Lamia, Martichoras / the Manticore was never originally given as a 'species' type of monster, simply a powerful Man-Eater (literal translation) far within Inner Asia (anywhere further-East than Afghanistan) that was relayed to them by trading Persians. The word Martichoras is a loan-word from the Persians, because rather than translating it into the Greek term for the same meaning (Androphagi), it was treated as a different creature entirely, due to the fact Androphagi already had an understood depiction (a humanoid tribe of cannibals that lived to the North-East, just North of modern-day Crimea), which clashed greatly with the animalistic description of Martichoras. From there, by simple grammatical standards, it was assumed to be one creature - a single, colossal, ferocious Manticore that prowled Inner Asia and terrorized the populace, much like how the Sphinx once did the same to Thebes or the Calydonian Boar did to Aetolia}* <-
 -> *{Overall, likely the Greek understanding of a Tiger, later hybridised with various other creatures unique to South Asia, that was thought to be different aspects of the same beast}* <-
