###Switch Terminology
***
#####RCM
***
**RCM** stands for **R**e**C**overy **M**ode.

#####Horizon OS (HOS)
***
**Horizon** is the name of the **Nintendo Switch** operating system.

#####OFW
***
**OFW** stands for **Original Firmware**.
It is your devices unmodified firmware.

#####CFW
***
**CFW** Stands for **Custom Firmware**. 
It is a firmware that modifies the system firmware to allow it to run [homebrew](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#homebrew).

#####Homebrew
***
A term used to describe unofficial software created by developers for a locked down system.
When it comes to the Switch, such software can include save managers, emulators, or games.

#####Atmosphere
***
A free and open source CFW created and maintained by [SciresM](https://github.com/SciresM) and [other contributors](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/graphs/contributors).

#####SXOS
***
A paid, no longer maintained and closed source CFW created by [Team Xecuter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Xecuter).
Does not work with firmware above 11.0.0.
#####NAND
***
The **NAND** is your devices built in memory (not to be confused with the SD card).
The **Nintendo Switch** has the memory size of **32GB** and by default has **25.9GB** of free storage, and
the rest is taken up by the operating system.

#####SysNAND
***
**SysNAND** stands for "**System NAND**".
The **SysNAND** is the contents stored on your devices built in memory (not to be confused with [OFW](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology#ofw)).
It contains everything ranging from the operating system itself, to games, screenshots, videos, and save files.
Every device, hacked or unhacked, has a **SysNAND**. 

#####EmuNAND
***
**EmuNAND** stands for "**Emulated NAND**".
The **EmuNAND** is a copy of your **SysNAND** that resides on your SD card and not on your devices internal memory.
Think of it as having a secondary **Nintendo Switch** on your SD card. 
It is used to isolate any actions that you might perform from your **SysNAND** that could either
harm your device or performing any other actions that might get you banned.
Any changes or actions that you perform in your **EmuNAND** won't affect your **SysNAND** since it is just a copy. 
!!!Warning Having an EmuNAND on its own won't protect you from being banned. [Click here](https://rentry.org/AvoidSwitchBan) for more information on how to avoid being banned.

#####Signature Patches
***
**Signature patches** or **SigPatches** allow your device to bypass signature checks performed by [**horizon**](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology#horizon-os-hos)
for installed titles. 

#####Hekate
***
A custom bootloader that allows you to bypass fuse checks and has a lot of useful tools.
Can be used to boot into [**OFW**](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#ofw), [**CFW**](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#cfw), Android, Linux, and any other payload.

#####Fusee
***
A custom minimal bootloader that is only used to boot into Atmosphere.
The difference between [**Hekate**](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#hekate) and **Fusee** is that [**Hekate**](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#hekate) needs a custom configuration file that
tells [Atmosphere](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology/#atmosphere) what KIP's, Patches and other settings it should use, while **Fusee** boots them automatically. 

#####NSP
***
**Nintendo Submission Package** or **NSP** is either a dump of an installed title or a homebrew package that can be installed.

#####XCI
***
**NX Card Image** or **XCI** is a dump from a Nintendo Switch cartridge.

#####NSZ
***
A compressed **NSP** file.

#####XCZ
***
A compressed **XCI** file.

#####NRO
***
An extension that [homebrew](https://rentry.org/SwitchTerminology#homebrew) applications use.
