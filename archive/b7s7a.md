#### Shadows Falling

Subtle movements across still waters. 
Night is about to fall. A Hunter is passing through the quiet of W Corp's backstreets, melding with the shadows, looking to finish his job without causing a ruckus.
But still, someone notices.

"Look at that Grey, I think a Taboo Hunter is about to visit someone. This could be the opening into the backstreets of W Corp that we need."
The other Member spat on the ground. "You're gonna poach from the Wing's higher ups now?"
"Dunno. You're gonna to return to boss empty handed?"
Grey stopped as the air became tense for a moment. They didn't know what they were in for yet.
...
If there was any hope to get a big catch before night fell, this was it.
Grey focused for a moment, and the message in his mind propagated. "We could strike gold here, two big catches are about to fight. House southwest of us. Send a group."
In a few moments, the fight was already midway, and members of the Black Scrawl were unknowingly moving in.

"Piece of shit!" shouted the other, "What are you here for?"
A dagger flew in the direction of her heart, making the answer obvious. She was quick to intercept the throw, only for more daggers to come out from the darkness, impaling her arms and legs.
With that, the shadowy killer finally reappeared. A man in a stealth outfit with a set of daggers, he seemed way stronger than her...
"I'll keep it short. The Enforcers heard that you were a murder and a cannibal, acting out despite the recent crackdowns on cannibalism in the backstreets."
Great, a taboo hunter. Are they really going to be trying to stop people for murder? This place would require so much work, there's no way that's possible...
"Here, I'll make sure your death is quick. You'll serve as a warning to the syndicates."

And so, the house's door detached from its hinges and went flying into his face. The hunter melded into the shadows again, but the thugs storming into the building just smirked. 
"I see you."
She is only able to register the start of a pitiable beatdown before passing out.

Guanting smirks.
"Going to war so early?"
"Sir..." 
With a small wave, you motion Grey to continue.
"... A taboo hunter could have info about the people they've been targeting recently. This is a chance to recruit them before they're bagged..."
Bagged? Seems Grey still has his lowborn ticks.
But that's not important compared to who stands before you. This taboo hunter may be the best view of Warp Corp's priorities you'll get your hands on, you only need to see what's inside...
"Inform the lieutenants in W Corp's backstreets that we have a new to-do list, then. With just a few key recruits, could take over the streets in a storm."

With a hit square in the jaw the chained Taboo Hunter begins to wake up, only able to mutter a few words before you focus your will against him.
