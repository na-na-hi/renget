###Expansion Content
####->Overview<-
Each Character in YML is comprised of three pieces:
1. **The data in the card's Description field.  This is formatted as:**
>Name[
>Race Class
>1-2 Clothing Tags
>2-3 Physical Description tags
>4-6 Personality tags, with the most influential up front and at least one "negative" trait.
>2-3 Special characteristics
>Background quest hook
>Secret personal quest hook
>]

2. **The Introduction in the First Message.**
_THIS HAS A MEASURABLE EFFECT ON PERSONALITY._
These are prose, so are quite flexible, but always need the following:
-The type of Advisor
-A bit of Characterization
-A bit of Character-specific setting

3. **A Journal Entry** or two related to the Character's area of expertise. If at least one relevant entry is present, it'll pull from the whole Journal as the  story unfolds, which is the entire  point!

There are plenty of free tokens, so it shouldn't be an issue to simply add a few more characters! Any more than 3-4, and I'd recommend swapping out existing characters. You want to leave room for plenty of Journal entries, after all, and you can always swap them back in as needed.

###Base Content
In lieu of re-downloading the card all the time, I've reproduced all of the base game content here. Also includes alternate journal entries for more questing!

Please note that some of the portraits are a bit more "human" than the descriptions--blame my inexperience with NAI Diffusion Furry. If you have any better pictures, a burner email is listed on my Charhub profile. Also accepting Rule 63 / Genderbent versions for those anons so inclined!

###The Journal
The Journal allows for long-term questing, developing relationships with characters, and actual plot progression.  There are two ways to keep your journal updated.

-Manually.  Duh.  Treat it as you would a real journal, and write entries in natural language.
-Automatically.  Type "Update Journal" and it SHOULD give you a fully formatted journal that you can copy/paste over your exising journal entirely. In practice, it can take a couple refreshes.  If it's not behaving after 5 tries, lower heat and presence penalty.

I worked hard to get the token count as low as possible, so you can add a **ton** of info here.  Go wild!

If all goes as planned, this is what it should look like:

2. **The Introduction in the First Message.**
These are shorter than Yes, My Liege, but no less important. The introduction should contain a description of their position or duties, so that they can chime in at the appropriate times. A bit of characterization rounds it out.
***
Intead of an example from the base game... here's the cast of Yes, My Liege if they were in Starfleet.  Simply add the characters to the USS Galaxy's description, and add a single line to the opening message.  Sample openers also included!
