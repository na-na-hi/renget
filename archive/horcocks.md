!!! note
	My personal favorite card, and the one that I've spend the most time with, both as creator and as {{user}}. This scenario is my attempt at the classic 'Infinite Zork' narrative, with a neverending adventure that keeps track of your progress. The original version had logic related to automated Journal entries, but that was removed with the rework as models became more diverse.  Also removed was the DLC - everything is now contained within the base v2 card.

	The Corrupting Curse was the first card I released publicly. I had dabbled in chats, but I preferred the more narrative-focused tools that /aids/ offered.

!!! danger
	->**Day and Night the guns fire, all day every day.  Nyota doesn't even hear them anymore. She's been firing this cannon for 8 years, and every day she hears her comrades die over the radio. It still hurts, though she no longer shows it.**<-

!!! note
	There is a bit going on under the hood here.  Nyota has a Randomizer for her fire missions, so you never know if your shots are going to be helpful or harmful.  I'm also quite happy with the conversations heard over the radio.
