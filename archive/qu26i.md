##### `Ost Afrika Prompt`
I want a story about werewolves in Ost Afrika

Where Fantasy Germany is going full colonial by taking the mantle of defending anthropes as an excuse to colonize places.
Having a religion based around metallurgy they're able to connect with the blacksmithing hyena clans, with spotted wifhyenas being provided with better equipment out of all auxiliaries due to being actual amazons.
They're miffed at being relegated to moral support, positioned right behind the front line and forced to use long-range rifles-cannons instead of being on the front shotguns blazing and killing giant elephant people.
The only upside is that they live in semi-luxury for a war environment due to being the only females in the battlefield surrounded by war-weary werewolves. The only reason they have a turn-over rate is due pregnancies relegating them to logistics.
Luckily after conquering the locals. Vets are provided land for themselves and their wives.
There a sort of game among colonials where they try to get at least one wifcreature of every carnivorous species for their harems. Spotted hyenas being the hardest because they don't function under normal sexual dynamics.
