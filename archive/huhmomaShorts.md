Misunderstood Awoo by anonymous & Jaycee

>Fuck, fuck, fuck!
>you run blindly through the darkened moonlit forest
>thickets of bramble and low hanging branches whip past your face and tear at your clothes as you sprint through the darkness with the heavy pater of rapid footsteps hot on your tail
>you should have listened to that park ranger and never gone off trail
>your exploratory night hike had transformed into a sudden game of cat & mouse after you had bumped into what you thought was a mossy tree
>it was as sturdy as oak, but the moss had felt a little too long and fuzzy
>and then it had growled at your curious blind groping in the dark
>now you were going to end up a missing 411 case
>you let out a short yell as you trip over a tree root and tumble a good few feet with your momentum
>you lie stunned on your back as the massive form of a black wolf creeps over you
>oh god not like this
>you scamper backwards on your hands and feet until you hit a tree, nowhere to run to now
>you close your eyes and wait for the inevitable
>suddenly you hear a loud *THUMP*
>crack one eye open to see the massive wolf presenting his stomach to you
>his tail whaps excitedly against the canopy floor as his malicious looking eyes glow in the moonlight
>"Belly rubs?"
>You furrow your brow
>the massive wolf simply lies on his side, staring at you with his creepy eyes
>you're still kind of intimated by the huge beast but he makes no further moves towards you
>this must be an intimidation tactic
>you'd better not piss him off
>you shakily rise to your feet and slowly make your way over to his prone form
>his tail hits the ground even harder at your approach, displacing leaves and twigs across the forest floor
>"Uh, s-sure" you reply as your hands sink into the soft fur of his stomach
>the effect is immediate as a low rumble rises from his throat
>you jerk your hands back quickly in fear
>you knew it was a trick to make you come close! Now he's going to rip you apart!
>the wolf makes a small whining noise as your hands leave him
>"Sorry! I'm... Sorry, you're hands just feel... so good!" he blurts out a hasty apology
>uh, what?
>"I-I didn't mean to scare you before! Please let me make it up to you! I know you humans can't see very well out here in the dark. Y-you can stick with me tonight and I'll keep you safe!" He continues, tail drooping
>this isn't at all how you expected your confrontation to go
>and keep you safe from what? He must be the biggest thing out here
>you want to reject but you're still kind of intimidated by him despite his desperate pleading
>...and you are now totally lost after your sprint through the woods
>"O-kay...?" you reply
>"Awesome! Come with me!" he says, his tail resuming it's rapid wagging
>"H-hey! Wait!" is all you can get out before you're picked up and slung over his shoulder
>he takes off in a dead sprint through the night, easily dodging trees and roots as he rushes back home with his new prize.

Hitanthro by anonymous

>You met him one night when you stopped for gas in the bad part of town
>He had just finished stuffing a lumpy tarp into the trunk of his gently used 1996 lincoln towncar and taken a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket under a flickering yellow streetlight
>When it became apparent that he had forgotten his lighter somewhere, you decided to go over and let him borrow yours, and surrounded by late night mist and stale cigarette smoke you hit it off
>For the longest time you had thought that he was just a completely normal gun nut with a home chemistry hobby who probably worked as a handyman or something, but you've only ever seen him buy stuff in cash, and he keeps burning his clothes and shoes in the backyard of his singlewide trailer when he gets back from work
>You're beginning to suspect he might not be entirely on the level, in fact, him occasionally taking you to the mall and buying you whatever you want (for $50 or less) along with a new pair of cheap tennis shoes for himself before throwing a silenced pistol, pair of handcuffs, and bottle of cloroform in an overnight bag and dissappearing for a day or two before coming back with two to three hundred dollars in copper, catalyctic converters, and crumpled five dollar bills is fairly suspicious
>Whatever he's doing, one thing is for sure: you can definitely fix him
>Or convince him to take you to work with him
>Spend a few more months getting closer until you could honestly say this shady prowler was your best friend
>It was clear he thought of you the same way
>Enjoy spending much time together out at bars, shopping, or drinking beers at your house (he never invited you over to his)
>Until one night he shows up at your place, 2:45 AM banging on the door frantically
>immediately barges in when you open the door and throws you a baseball cap and dark glasses
>begs you to come with him somewhere safe, clearly in a state of panic
>he refuses to explain much more than that but you hear him blurt something strange in his frazzled state as he ushers you out the door
>YOU were his next job
>Is he dramatically confessing his love to you?
>Are you being kidnapped?
>Does this have something to do with you not paying for the cool quartz you got from that extremely skinny guy with a nervous twitch you ran into in the dollar general parking lot?
>Questions race through your head as your friend shoves you into a two door grand prix with rust holes, no AC, and an aftermarket radio that wasn't wired in correctly and puts a taurus pt111 with visible rust in your lap
>You can barely register that he's even speaking as he demands to know what drive through you want to go through before you pick up road beer and head to his cousin's place outside Lincoln, Nebraska

>You turn off the projector and turn on the lights

>Pointing at Tyler, he straightens up
"Tyler, you're our fastest and bulkiest attacker, you'll be handling the ball for touchdowns."

Let's get silly

Genetically enhanced anthro bf

never.
ending.
sex.
drive.

I know I shouldn’t question this but how could he possibly keep something that long in his mouth?

The same way all anthros can fit any dick inside them, no matter the size. Magic.

I'm going to make something up and say that there's a cavity right next to the esophagus when the tongue is based and it gets compacted into there.

So the spot where the Adam’s apple would be.
>lump in neck when retracted 
>smooth neck when let out
Seems legit.

>save bio experiment anthro from some secret science facility
>he won't stop clinging to you
>gets upset when you leave him alone for too long

That’s not surprising. Being used day in and day out in all sorts of experiments would wear anyone down mentally. Even if said thing was literally made for it.

Whiff by anonymous

was stopped by my wolf roommate in the morning on my way out to work

>"Woah Anon, wait up!" he yells from the living area
>He's lounging on the couch watching TV in his pajama bottoms, not having to work until noon.
>lucky bastard
>I stop my hurried rush out the door to face him
>he peeks over the back of the couch at me and pauses for a moment to contemplate his next words
>"Y-you know I'm always here for you right?" he asks after a short silence
>"Uh, yeah? I know you got my back dude" I reply
>he looks up and away in thought
>then turns his eyes back to me
>"No, like, if you ever need anything. You know you can ask me, right?" he elaborates
>"Yeah, I know man. You've been the perfect roommate, I appreciate it" I tell him
>"No! No no no no no, I mean, if you ever need ANYTHING. You know you can ask me?" he reiterates, a tiny bit of frustration creeping into his voice
>at this point I was already late for work
>"YES, bro I get it. Look I'll see you after work, I'll cover rent this month if that's what you're getting at. Talk to you later" I shout to him on my way out the door.
>could hear him whining to himself as I left

Okay, but genuinely. What did he mean by this? Been thinking about it ever since and I'm getting off shift in an hour

He just wants to help you satisfy your own needs like a true bro.

Does he need to spell it out for you? He wants you to breed him you bozo.

What are you talking about? we're just really good friends

Sometimes really good friends share personal things and do intimate things together that really isn't that strange.

Canid anthros can get a bit neurotic when they aren't living in a family/pack unit. For one, they get clingy, especially when left home alone. And they get very insecure without regular physical and verbal reassurance of their place in the pack.

If you're his sole roommate, he's probably viewing you as his "pack" surrogate and is craving your approval and affection. But he knows you're not a canid, so he's too shy to ask for it outright. If you want to calm him down, give him some physical affection by regularly rubbing his belly and neck when the two of you are hanging out. Telling him that he's a "good boy" or giving him other pet names will help a lot too -- but play it off as ironic banter to avoid embarrassing him too much.

P.S. if you're leaving him alone at home for extended periods, you've probably noticed your clothes going missing, right? Check his room. He's probably "borrowing" them to calm himself down with a familiar scent.

This explains so much, thanks for the actual answer

Always didn't know what to make of his "us against the world" and "wolves bond for life" tangents when he gets drunk. Also just a few socks missing but I think those are just getting lost in laundry

UPDATE:

>Just got back from work
>roommate greets me at the door, tail wagging like he usually does
>asks me if I'd be down for a movie night
>hell yeah always done for movie night with the bros
>break out the alcohol while he went to go grab a DVD from his room
>puts on this weird fantasy movie about some wolf warrior
>special effects look pretty bad for fantasy, and the story kinda sucks if I'm being brutally honest
>but now the wolf warrior is getting a little handsy with some human squire on-screen
>and I'm getting a little worried about the X rating that popped up on screen earlier, I thought it was a studio logo or something
>roommate keeps shooting weird prolonged glances at me in between drinks

Am I supposed to pet him now?

Watching bad movies is a good pastime, and a good opportunity to break the ice on petting him. If it's the first time you've pet him, he might be surprised and act a bit weird about it. Just play it casual and nonchalant, act like it's no big deal, and he'll relax and let it happen.

By petting him, you're signalling that you've accepted him as "pack" -- and keep in mind that because you're the one who initiated (since he was too shy to do so), you're establishing a dominant position over him. Don't worry if he acts shy or submissive, that's just him signalling his acceptance of the role. You can also make him more comfortable by undressing him a bit -- not fully, just pull his shirt off to signal that it's okay for him to relax around you, since pack members don't usually have much modesty around each other.

>do I pet him now?
Yes. Word of advice, grope his butt or chest. Canine anthros LOVE when you do that. Don’t worry, it’s not a sexual thing for them, they just really like being touched there.

Heavy petting
