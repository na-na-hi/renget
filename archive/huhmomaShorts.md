Misunderstood Awoo by anonymous & Jaycee

>Fuck, fuck, fuck!
>you run blindly through the darkened moonlit forest
>thickets of bramble and low hanging branches whip past your face and tear at your clothes as you sprint through the darkness with the heavy pater of rapid footsteps hot on your tail
>you should have listened to that park ranger and never gone off trail
>your exploratory night hike had transformed into a sudden game of cat & mouse after you had bumped into what you thought was a mossy tree
>it was as sturdy as oak, but the moss had felt a little too long and fuzzy
>and then it had growled at your curious blind groping in the dark
>now you were going to end up a missing 411 case
>you let out a short yell as you trip over a tree root and tumble a good few feet with your momentum
>you lie stunned on your back as the massive form of a black wolf creeps over you
>oh god not like this
>you scamper backwards on your hands and feet until you hit a tree, nowhere to run to now
>you close your eyes and wait for the inevitable
>suddenly you hear a loud *THUMP*
>crack one eye open to see the massive wolf presenting his stomach to you
>his tail whaps excitedly against the canopy floor as his malicious looking eyes glow in the moonlight
>"Belly rubs?"
>You furrow your brow
>the massive wolf simply lies on his side, staring at you with his creepy eyes
>you're still kind of intimated by the huge beast but he makes no further moves towards you
>this must be an intimidation tactic
>you'd better not piss him off
>you shakily rise to your feet and slowly make your way over to his prone form
>his tail hits the ground even harder at your approach, displacing leaves and twigs across the forest floor
>"Uh, s-sure" you reply as your hands sink into the soft fur of his stomach
>the effect is immediate as a low rumble rises from his throat
>you jerk your hands back quickly in fear
>you knew it was a trick to make you come close! Now he's going to rip you apart!
>the wolf makes a small whining noise as your hands leave him
>"Sorry! I'm... Sorry, you're hands just feel... so good!" he blurts out a hasty apology
>uh, what?
>"I-I didn't mean to scare you before! Please let me make it up to you! I know you humans can't see very well out here in the dark. Y-you can stick with me tonight and I'll keep you safe!" He continues, tail drooping
>this isn't at all how you expected your confrontation to go
>and keep you safe from what? He must be the biggest thing out here
>you want to reject but you're still kind of intimidated by him despite his desperate pleading
>...and you are now totally lost after your sprint through the woods
>"O-kay...?" you reply
>"Awesome! Come with me!" he says, his tail resuming it's rapid wagging
>"H-hey! Wait!" is all you can get out before you're picked up and slung over his shoulder
>he takes off in a dead sprint through the night, easily dodging trees and roots as he rushes back home with his new prize.

Hitanthro by anonymous

>You met him one night when you stopped for gas in the bad part of town
>He had just finished stuffing a lumpy tarp into the trunk of his gently used 1996 lincoln towncar and taken a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket under a flickering yellow streetlight
>When it became apparent that he had forgotten his lighter somewhere, you decided to go over and let him borrow yours, and surrounded by late night mist and stale cigarette smoke you hit it off
>For the longest time you had thought that he was just a completely normal gun nut with a home chemistry hobby who probably worked as a handyman or something, but you've only ever seen him buy stuff in cash, and he keeps burning his clothes and shoes in the backyard of his singlewide trailer when he gets back from work
>You're beginning to suspect he might not be entirely on the level, in fact, him occasionally taking you to the mall and buying you whatever you want (for $50 or less) along with a new pair of cheap tennis shoes for himself before throwing a silenced pistol, pair of handcuffs, and bottle of cloroform in an overnight bag and dissappearing for a day or two before coming back with two to three hundred dollars in copper, catalyctic converters, and crumpled five dollar bills is fairly suspicious
>Whatever he's doing, one thing is for sure: you can definitely fix him
>Or convince him to take you to work with him
>Spend a few more months getting closer until you could honestly say this shady prowler was your best friend
>It was clear he thought of you the same way
>Enjoy spending much time together out at bars, shopping, or drinking beers at your house (he never invited you over to his)
>Until one night he shows up at your place, 2:45 AM banging on the door frantically
>immediately barges in when you open the door and throws you a baseball cap and dark glasses
>begs you to come with him somewhere safe, clearly in a state of panic
>he refuses to explain much more than that but you hear him blurt something strange in his frazzled state as he ushers you out the door
>YOU were his next job
>Is he dramatically confessing his love to you?
>Are you being kidnapped?
>Does this have something to do with you not paying for the cool quartz you got from that extremely skinny guy with a nervous twitch you ran into in the dollar general parking lot?
>Questions race through your head as your friend shoves you into a two door grand prix with rust holes, no AC, and an aftermarket radio that wasn't wired in correctly and puts a taurus pt111 with visible rust in your lap
>You can barely register that he's even speaking as he demands to know what drive through you want to go through before you pick up road beer and head to his cousin's place outside Lincoln, Nebraska

Coaching Anthros by anonymous

How about some comedy?

>be Coach Hanknon, the newly hired coach for the american football team of an anthro school
>learn about their losing streak since they joined the leagues
>fox principal put an incentive for you to push the team hard and get a single tournament win for the season
>by incentive he means he'll dock your pay
>also he might molest you if the school loses
>fuck
>enter the locker room to meet the team
>get a sense of relief that these guys are built like shit houses
>all of them are surprised that a human will be coaching the team
"Listen up guys! I'm gonna be your new coach so starting today. I'll need a rundown of your names and what you do."
>the tiger anthro wearing tight fitting jacket stands up
>"My name is Tyler and I'm the lead attacker for the team."
"You fast Tyler?"
>"I-I'm sure I'm pretty quick sir."
>The rest of the guys snickered 
>"Maybe in the bed."
>the snickers turned into held-in giggles
>Tyler stomps on the floor and pouted at his teammates
>Okay then...
"You there! Big bull, what you got there!?"
>The largest of the team, quickly stood up in a panic and dropped a frilly bra
"Ah we got ourselves a Romeo over here. There a girl waiting for you back at class?"
>He quickly picked it up and his face turned red
>"A-Actually sir it's mine. My chest is a bit big and it chafes on the pads sir."
>You take a deep breath
>This is going to take a lot of work
>On the training field
>huge great dane linebacker sacks QB during practice plays much to your delight
>your drills seem to be paying off
>slap him on the back and your mouth is moving before you even realize what you're saying
>"Good boy! Nice Job!"
>great dane is stunned for a second but heads back out to the field
>his performance increases nearly ten-fold as he dominates the gridiron for the next few drills
>but now is constantly looking toward you with a wagging tail for approval after every play
>training time
>you order the attackers to run laps and the defenders to practice tackling
>sounds of training dummies being tossed and players working hard fill your ears
>except
"HENDERSON! What the hell are you doing?!"
>the small goat anthro and designated lead defender, is currently latched on to the dummy facehugger style
>you see his tongue slobbering all over the poor target's face
>taking a walk behind the bleachers, you rub the bridge of your nose on how you're going to turn these pansies into hard bred american football stars
>"Heeey there coach!"
>the principal fox appeared from behind the corner and struts in front of you
>"So how's training our future champions doing huh?"
>you refuse to answer the creepy little shit and walk away and immediately return to the field
>Two of the dog anthros, Daniel and Matt, are nose-to-nose as they pull with their teeth a worn out football
>you turn back to see the fox dancing like a stripper against the bleacher's poles
>remember what you signed up for Anon
"Alright you apes! Time for a scrimmage!"
>"But I'm a lion sir-"
"DEFENDERS NEXT TO ME! ATTACKERS ON THE OTHER SIDE!" 
>You and your team are seated in the AVR
"Alright gentlemen, we're going to be up against Chaddington University. Some uppity school upstate."
>The slide cuts to a picture of an all human team posing for a picture
>The anthro boys all ooh'd at the sight
>"O-Oh he looks nice."
>"Mmmf..."
>"A-All human team?"
>You were expecting them to cower in fear but you can't complain really
"Chaddington has the been the fan favorite for over 10 years, winning each and every season taking home the trophy."
>You play one of their last season games 
>It depicts their lead defender shutting down some poor rabbit anthro with a chokeslam
>Another has half of the team bodyslam on a kangaroo
>Each member of your team reacted as they saw wipeout after wipeout of Chaddington's opposition
>"That's gotta hurt!"
>"How are we'll be able to beat them?"
>"God I wish that was me."
>You looked around on who the fuck said that last one
>Skimming all over the faces in the back, you shake your head and continue
"As you can see, Chaddington prides themselves on their tight defensive coordination."
>You turn off the projector and turn on the lights
"We're gonna need some fast offensive maneuvers if we're going to break their defense."
>Pointing at Tyler, he straightens up
"Tyler, you're our fastest and bulkiest attacker, you'll be handling the ball for touchdowns."
>The swole tiger anthro pointed at himself while shaking like a leaf
>"M-Me? Against all those guys?"
>"Lucky bastard..."

Gator's Prison Stud by anonymous

>when your giant alligator bunk mate said 
Imma fuck you good tonight boy
>you were certain you'd be seeing the infirmary for a ruptured asshole
>instead he starts drenching you in his drool to "get you ready"
>then suddenly you're playing the littlest mule to daddy Earthshaker's ass as he calls you baby and slowly licks your face
>not sure what would give first, the bed, your pelvis, or your soul
>big daddy gator suddenly gets a heavenly glow like some scaley jesus or Aurora borealis
>what
>you're pretty sure the guard pissed himself with the rumbling snarl he got from daddy sub on your dick
>feelthebass.jpg
>the rumbling is coming and so have I

>"Well well well, looks like we got a genius over here. That's three weeks of being our prison stud bitch."
>days are filled with you being the prison bicycle as rows of crocs and gator plap their fat asses on your dick
>the last gator is your cellmate as he roughly bounces on your aching pelvis
>last thing you feel at the end is a kiss on the forehead and a 'nice job stud'

>giant Gator cellmate INSISTS that you sleep and cuddle with him every night
>you use one of his huge tit-like pecs as pillow 
>almost every chance he gets he plaps his gigantic jiggly asscheeks on your cock
>he starts to follow you around wherever you go so he can “protect” you 
>you think he actually just wants to keep you for himself
>the fact that he gets very irritated and jealous whenever you speak to another anthro inmate only lends credence your suspicion
>though to his credit, having a titan of muscle and scales follow you around like a loyal hound does certainly ward off any potential trouble
>your only concern is that your oversized cellmate seems to be getting very, very attached to you to an almost unhealthy degree
>you wonder if he will even let you leave when your sentance is up

>one night he says he feels 'romantical' tonight and pins you on the bed
>no penetration, just steaming hot french kisses night long
>your cheeks and neck are red with hickies when you wake up
