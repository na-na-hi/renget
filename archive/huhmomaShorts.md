Misunderstood Awoo by anonymous & Jaycee

>Fuck, fuck, fuck!
>you run blindly through the darkened moonlit forest
>thickets of bramble and low hanging branches whip past your face and tear at your clothes as you sprint through the darkness with the heavy pater of rapid footsteps hot on your tail
>you should have listened to that park ranger and never gone off trail
>your exploratory night hike had transformed into a sudden game of cat & mouse after you had bumped into what you thought was a mossy tree
>it was as sturdy as oak, but the moss had felt a little too long and fuzzy
>and then it had growled at your curious blind groping in the dark
>now you were going to end up a missing 411 case
>you let out a short yell as you trip over a tree root and tumble a good few feet with your momentum
>you lie stunned on your back as the massive form of a black wolf creeps over you
>oh god not like this
>you scamper backwards on your hands and feet until you hit a tree, nowhere to run to now
>you close your eyes and wait for the inevitable
>suddenly you hear a loud *THUMP*
>crack one eye open to see the massive wolf presenting his stomach to you
>his tail whaps excitedly against the canopy floor as his malicious looking eyes glow in the moonlight
>"Belly rubs?"
>You furrow your brow
>the massive wolf simply lies on his side, staring at you with his creepy eyes
>you're still kind of intimated by the huge beast but he makes no further moves towards you
>this must be an intimidation tactic
>you'd better not piss him off
>you shakily rise to your feet and slowly make your way over to his prone form
>his tail hits the ground even harder at your approach, displacing leaves and twigs across the forest floor
>"Uh, s-sure" you reply as your hands sink into the soft fur of his stomach
>the effect is immediate as a low rumble rises from his throat
>you jerk your hands back quickly in fear
>you knew it was a trick to make you come close! Now he's going to rip you apart!
>the wolf makes a small whining noise as your hands leave him
>"Sorry! I'm... Sorry, you're hands just feel... so good!" he blurts out a hasty apology
>uh, what?
>"I-I didn't mean to scare you before! Please let me make it up to you! I know you humans can't see very well out here in the dark. Y-you can stick with me tonight and I'll keep you safe!" He continues, tail drooping
>this isn't at all how you expected your confrontation to go
>and keep you safe from what? He must be the biggest thing out here
>you want to reject but you're still kind of intimidated by him despite his desperate pleading
>...and you are now totally lost after your sprint through the woods
>"O-kay...?" you reply
>"Awesome! Come with me!" he says, his tail resuming it's rapid wagging
>"H-hey! Wait!" is all you can get out before you're picked up and slung over his shoulder
>he takes off in a dead sprint through the night, easily dodging trees and roots as he rushes back home with his new prize.

Hitanthro by anonymous

>You met him one night when you stopped for gas in the bad part of town
>He had just finished stuffing a lumpy tarp into the trunk of his gently used 1996 lincoln towncar and taken a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket under a flickering yellow streetlight
>When it became apparent that he had forgotten his lighter somewhere, you decided to go over and let him borrow yours, and surrounded by late night mist and stale cigarette smoke you hit it off
>For the longest time you had thought that he was just a completely normal gun nut with a home chemistry hobby who probably worked as a handyman or something, but you've only ever seen him buy stuff in cash, and he keeps burning his clothes and shoes in the backyard of his singlewide trailer when he gets back from work
>You're beginning to suspect he might not be entirely on the level, in fact, him occasionally taking you to the mall and buying you whatever you want (for $50 or less) along with a new pair of cheap tennis shoes for himself before throwing a silenced pistol, pair of handcuffs, and bottle of cloroform in an overnight bag and dissappearing for a day or two before coming back with two to three hundred dollars in copper, catalyctic converters, and crumpled five dollar bills is fairly suspicious
>Whatever he's doing, one thing is for sure: you can definitely fix him
>Or convince him to take you to work with him
>Spend a few more months getting closer until you could honestly say this shady prowler was your best friend
>It was clear he thought of you the same way
>Enjoy spending much time together out at bars, shopping, or drinking beers at your house (he never invited you over to his)
>Until one night he shows up at your place, 2:45 AM banging on the door frantically
>immediately barges in when you open the door and throws you a baseball cap and dark glasses
>begs you to come with him somewhere safe, clearly in a state of panic
>he refuses to explain much more than that but you hear him blurt something strange in his frazzled state as he ushers you out the door
>YOU were his next job
>Is he dramatically confessing his love to you?
>Are you being kidnapped?
>Does this have something to do with you not paying for the cool quartz you got from that extremely skinny guy with a nervous twitch you ran into in the dollar general parking lot?
>Questions race through your head as your friend shoves you into a two door grand prix with rust holes, no AC, and an aftermarket radio that wasn't wired in correctly and puts a taurus pt111 with visible rust in your lap
>You can barely register that he's even speaking as he demands to know what drive through you want to go through before you pick up road beer and head to his cousin's place outside Lincoln, Nebraska

>You turn off the projector and turn on the lights

>Pointing at Tyler, he straightens up
"Tyler, you're our fastest and bulkiest attacker, you'll be handling the ball for touchdowns."

Let's get silly

Genetically enhanced anthro bf

never.
ending.
sex.
drive.

I know I shouldn’t question this but how could he possibly keep something that long in his mouth?

The same way all anthros can fit any dick inside them, no matter the size. Magic.

I'm going to make something up and say that there's a cavity right next to the esophagus when the tongue is based and it gets compacted into there.

So the spot where the Adam’s apple would be.
>lump in neck when retracted 
>smooth neck when let out
Seems legit.

>save bio experiment anthro from some secret science facility
>he won't stop clinging to you
>gets upset when you leave him alone for too long

That’s not surprising. Being used day in and day out in all sorts of experiments would wear anyone down mentally. Even if said thing was literally made for it.

>textbook evil Corp/government mooks build weapon
>he's physically perfect, mentally a failure his complete lack of any drive to kill or even really harm humans

Whiff by anonymous

*SNIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFFFFF*

was stopped by my wolf roommate in the morning on my way out to work

>"Woah Anon, wait up!" he yells from the living area
>He's lounging on the couch watching TV in his pajama bottoms, not having to work until noon.
>lucky bastard
>I stop my hurried rush out the door to face him
>he peeks over the back of the couch at me and pauses for a moment to contemplate his next words
>"Y-you know I'm always here for you right?" he asks after a short silence
>"Uh, yeah? I know you got my back dude" I reply
>he looks up and away in thought
>then turns his eyes back to me
>"No, like, if you ever need anything. You know you can ask me, right?" he elaborates
>"Yeah, I know man. You've been the perfect roommate, I appreciate it" I tell him
>"No! No no no no no, I mean, if you ever need ANYTHING. You know you can ask me?" he reiterates, a tiny bit of frustration creeping into his voice
>at this point I was already late for work
>"YES, bro I get it. Look I'll see you after work, I'll cover rent this month if that's what you're getting at. Talk to you later" I shout to him on my way out the door.
>could hear him whining to himself as I left

Okay, but genuinely. What did he mean by this? Been thinking about it ever since and I'm getting off shift in an hour

He just wants to help you satisfy your own needs like a true bro.

Does he need to spell it out for you? He wants you to breed him you bozo.

What are you talking about? we're just really good friends

Sometimes really good friends share personal things and do intimate things together that really isn't that strange.

Canid anthros can get a bit neurotic when they aren't living in a family/pack unit. For one, they get clingy, especially when left home alone. And they get very insecure without regular physical and verbal reassurance of their place in the pack.

If you're his sole roommate, he's probably viewing you as his "pack" surrogate and is craving your approval and affection. But he knows you're not a canid, so he's too shy to ask for it outright. If you want to calm him down, give him some physical affection by regularly rubbing his belly and neck when the two of you are hanging out. Telling him that he's a "good boy" or giving him other pet names will help a lot too -- but play it off as ironic banter to avoid embarrassing him too much.

P.S. if you're leaving him alone at home for extended periods, you've probably noticed your clothes going missing, right? Check his room. He's probably "borrowing" them to calm himself down with a familiar scent.

This explains so much, thanks for the actual answer

Always didn't know what to make of his "us against the world" and "wolves bond for life" tangents when he gets drunk. Also just a few socks missing but I think those are just getting lost in laundry

UPDATE:

>Just got back from work
>roommate greets me at the door, tail wagging like he usually does
>asks me if I'd be down for a movie night
>hell yeah always done for movie night with the bros
>break out the alcohol while he went to go grab a DVD from his room
>puts on this weird fantasy movie about some wolf warrior
>special effects look pretty bad for fantasy, and the story kinda sucks if I'm being brutally honest
>but now the wolf warrior is getting a little handsy with some human squire on-screen
>and I'm getting a little worried about the X rating that popped up on screen earlier, I thought it was a studio logo or something
>roommate keeps shooting weird prolonged glances at me in between drinks

Am I supposed to pet him now?

Watching bad movies is a good pastime, and a good opportunity to break the ice on petting him. If it's the first time you've pet him, he might be surprised and act a bit weird about it. Just play it casual and nonchalant, act like it's no big deal, and he'll relax and let it happen.

By petting him, you're signalling that you've accepted him as "pack" -- and keep in mind that because you're the one who initiated (since he was too shy to do so), you're establishing a dominant position over him. Don't worry if he acts shy or submissive, that's just him signalling his acceptance of the role. You can also make him more comfortable by undressing him a bit -- not fully, just pull his shirt off to signal that it's okay for him to relax around you, since pack members don't usually have much modesty around each other.

>do I pet him now?
Yes. Word of advice, grope his butt or chest. Canine anthros LOVE when you do that. Don’t worry, it’s not a sexual thing for them, they just really like being touched there.

Heavy petting

>"Orin?" you ask, the features of the young wolf you once knew coming clear in the dim torchlight
>"Come Anon, your presence alone saves this night. I will bring you somewhere more... suitable" he speaks, in a voice much deeper than the one you remember

Becoming a Saltlick by anonymous

>*huff... huff* "Ah!" *muwah*
>You never really know where you might end up or who you might meet when you go out exploring; but it was always sure to be an adventure
>tonight seems to have proven no different, after you met Trent, Matt, and Leslie
>"Mmmph!" you moan into Matt's mouth as Leslie's warm maw brings you to orgasm
>your tongue is limply pushed around your mouth by Matt's flatter, more abrasive muscle as you spasm
>the sandpaper texture of Leslie's tongue sends jolts of pleasure through you as it laps the underside of your shaft, trapped in the depths of his stretchy throat
>you'd met the trio of goats while going a little off trail at one of your favorite spots
>an older looking gay couple and smaller feminine tag-along who you honestly thought was their niece at first
>until the small goat had opened his mouth to invite you back to their tent to come smoke with him and his "partners"
>one thing led to another, and well...
>"Yer pretty noisy for a saltlick, ain'tcha?" Trent says as you curl your arm under his muzzle and grip the fur at the side of his face
>the muscular goat pulls you closer into his chest, and grinds his member against your cheeks as you recline in his lap
>the feel of his smooth shaft gliding against your hole the only other distinct sensation besides the fur and tongues assaulting you from all sides
>the noise of moans and busy mouths join the chirping of cicadas and peaceful crackling of the campfire in the night
>Matt breaks his kiss, just in time for you to let out another lurid moan as Trent runs his tongue up the side of your neck
>almost no part of your body has been left untouched from their prolonged tongue bath
>your bare skin turning sensitive and pink under their rough tongues
>you're left gaping like a fish as Leslie begins moving again, his velvet mouth sliding up and down your overstimulated cock
>this brings small chuckles to Trent and Matt as they continue peppering your face and chest with long, wet licks and kisses
>you twist and squirm, desperately trying to escape the maddening pleasure
>but you are held firmly by Trent and Matt's interlocking legs, practically sandwiched between them
>you can only pant and moan at the slippery heat wrapped around your dick, the warm fur pressed into your back and sides, the drooling tongues lapping at your face
>you're left a twitching mess. The only coherent images you can make out as your eyes roll to the back of your head is the light of the fire, and Trent and Matt's warm expressions as they observe you
>thankfully, the blissful torture does end and you slowly come too as your cock leaves Leslie's mouth with a *POP*
>"See! I told ya humies were cute! Tasty too!" the small goat exclaims, wiping his mouth. "Can we keep him?" he asks after a small pause
>both Matt and Trent pause their licking and look at each other, both of their tongues still pressed firmly into your skin
>an unspoken agreement passes between them before Trent pulls his tongue away
>Matt simply continues licking as you squirm in your fluffy prison
>"What do you think saltlick? Wanna spend the night gettin' to know us a little better?" Trent leans down to whisper into your ear before nibbling on it, he thrusts his hips into you a few times to accentuate his point
>the answer was obvious to you, an affirmative head nod is all your breathless form can muster. Trent seems to get the message though as he giggles and sucks at your ear
>suddenly Leslie pulls away from your legs, and your world is flipped horizontally
>"Matt, darlin' would you put out the fire then come join us in the tent? Me n' Leslie are gonna tuck in our new friend here." Trent says as he lifts you effortlessly into a bridal carry
>"Sounds good honeybun! I'll catch up~" the fluffy bespectacled goat replies as he begins collecting all the clothing strewn around the campsite
>you snuggle into Trent's broad furry chest and Leslie walks alongside you, stroking your legs as you're carried to the small nearby tent, just barely large enough to squeeze the three of you in
>one thought briefly crosses your mind as Trent unzips the entrance and hunkers down to crawl inside the darkened shelter with you in his arms
>it was going to be a cramped night

Inspiration strikes randomly, but hope ya'll enjoyed. Wanted something short and smutty, was thinking about maybe doing a second part later

>both of his hands tenderly hold his meal, his thumbs prodding at it as he works out what to say
“I‘ve never really talked to a human before, and I just wanted to get to know you.”
>he looks up, his blue eyes peering through the glasses, this adorable rotund rabbit holds eye contact for a few moments before he returns to his sheepish demeanour, quickly eating his meal

“Sorry, I feel like I’ve just wasted your time…”
>he gets up, turning to leave
>you snag his hand, your fingers diving between his soft digits, he turns to you, looking up
>Inches away from him, you assure him that you enjoyed yourself, that it was a wonderful little meal and that you wouldn’t mind spending more time with him

Playing horror games with your anthro bf!

>horror game where a werewolf chases the main character
>he thinks it's a dating sim

>horror game where you're partnered with a werewolf
>you're both trying to escape something even bigger and deadlier
>human can enter smaller places like buildings and crawl spaces to find items and their clear thinking allows them to solve more complex puzzles
>werewolf has superhuman strength and agility which allows him to traverse terrain and help the human reach far locations but his lack of mental clarity makes him capable of solving only simple environmental puzzles
>swap between the two on the fly to progress

aside from the swapping and werewolf part that's pretty much The Last Guardian

>You recover your health and sanity bars in between levels by sleeping in each other's arms

>you thought it was a bit funny when he suggested it since the main characters were a human and wolf, just like you two

>wait did you just hear that right? Did they just confess to each other? what's going on? this kind of came out of nowhere

what the fuck? why did the devs do this? I can't help but feel they're pushing an agenda. My roommate has been much more "handsy" since then, and won't stop buying this one specific brand of water

>Soundless Mountain used to be a respected, sophisticated, atmospheric, mature horror series
>Then the second game has the stupid "Romance Ending" easter egg and sex crazed anthros latch onto it like fleas and the game sells like hot cakes
>Now every game in the series has doubled down on the implied romance to the point it's less of a horror series and more of a softcore porn series
Ridiculous. Btw it's actually really hard to get the romance ending in Silent Mountain 2 unless you're really specifically gunning for it. Your roommate 100% planned this and probably wants into your pants

Damn! I thought it was strange that he refused to move onto the next level until we got all the hidden "frayed red knot" collectables!

gonna confront him about this during our next platonic grooming/petting session

>Ywn be a pretty boy singer in an "Hpop" band of all humans
>Your job is to look as cute, handsome and pouty as possible with 4 other humans guys, all the while dancing in coordination and crooning sappy romance songs
>Most other humans can't stand this shit, but it's wildly, INSANELY popular with anthros
>Unfortunately, despite your popularity, it isn't all fun and games behind the scenes
>Your agency works you like a dog. You barely have any time off and even when you do, the agency keeps you on an incredibly tight leash
>So important is your sex appeal and public image to the popularity of the band that your contract dictates when and how you can appear in public, what you're allowed to say, what you're allowed to wear, even what you're allowed to eat
>And the worst thing?
>Your contract forbids you from being allowed to date
>It's an Hpop industry wide rule for all human performers
>The reason for it?
>Anthro fans can get very... possessive of their favorites
>One of the first big breakthrough human stars in the industry had his career abruptly extinguished when he publicly revealed he had a boyfriend
>His jilted anthro fans responded with unrestrained rabid fury
>His popularity plummeted, and both the human and his boyfriend received non-stop online harassment and even death threats
>Instead of helping him, the industry blacklisted him
>You have no idea where he is or what he's doing these days, but sadly, if you don't want to share his fate, you've got to keep your bed cold, your lips unkissed, and your heart hollow and empty
>All of this has left you pretty depressed, and it's started to show in your performances
>Your audience has noticed, but it's not having the effect you'd expected...
>"OMG Anon looks so sad these days!!! I just want to hold him and hug him and bite his face and-"

excellent stuff anon lol

>anthro k-pop stans
Dear god. With how rabid irl KPOP fans are I can’t even begin to imagine what anthro ones would be like.
>anon eventually becomes the most popular member of the H-pop group, to the point where his agency decides to make him a solo-act
>unfortunately however, anons fanbase seems to attract increasingly obsessive and borderline-deranged fans
>as a result, anon’s agency has had to repeatedly increase security 
>but that can only go so far when the average anon-stan is close to double the size or more than the average human and can bend steel with their bare hands
>also doesn’t help that the agency is reluctant to hire anthro security after repeated complaints of anthro inappropriately flirting with the human stars
>it’s gotten to the point where anon now has a small army of security guards, many of whom are ex-soldiers and swat members on constant stand-by to quickly extract anon from a show if his fans get to excited or rowdy

>anon misses when he would get normal fan interactions on social media 
>practically all he gets these days are confessions of undying love, and pictures of his fans spread-assholes begging him to “breed” them 
>anon-stans start to show up to his shows in increasingly skimpy clothes
>eventually devolves into his fans just wearing straight up fetish gear to his concerts

>pictures of his fans spread-assholes begging him to “breed” them
He should go all "artsy" and make an album cover where it is nothing but a collage of all the pictures of his fans' spread holes all together to form a picture of himself.

Hot Knot by anonymous

Had a semi-internet related greentext I wrote for /awoo/ that might fit better here

>"Anon! Hey Anon!"
>oh god
>here comes my wolf roommate, and I mentally prepare myself for whatever psychic damage I know he's about to inflict upon me
>wherever he gets this excited over something it's never good
>I turn my head from the brainless tv program I was vegging out to and my worst fears are confirmed
>First, my roommate was wasted. As I could infer from the nigh empty bottle of bourbon in his hand
>or well, that's how I would usually tell if he wasn't the level of 'fucked up' that comes with its own aura. I'd smelled the alcohol long before I looked at him
>Second, he was stark naked. only a backwards baseball cap sat atop my roomies head, with ear holes cut out for his canine features
>Third, and the most egregious in my eyes. He was painfully erect
>so erect that I was pulled back from the bizarre situation as the errant thought crossed my mind of how long he must have been prepping himself around the corner to show me this
>and what was 'this'?
>my roommate cradles his knotted cock in between a hotdog bun, a bottle of ketchup in the other hand
>"Hey, hey! Wanna hotdog?" he spouts enthusiastically, before hovering the ketchup over his dick
>the bottle lets out the saddest puttering noise I've ever heard as my roommate squeezes the condiment over himself
>the mixture is watery at first, clearly not having been shaken, before a sloppy torrent of red ejects from the bottle and coats his member
>Cyprus himself would be in awe at my stoicism as I watch my roommate spatter heinz 57 all over his cock and balls, his drunkenness not lending itself well to accuracy
>the only noise that fills the room is the quiet drone of the tv and the intermittent sputtering of the poor condiment bottle
>"Eh? eh!? get it?" my roommate gestures at his dick
>The bun is no longer visible under the soggy pile of ketchup on his crotch
>I close my eyes and inhale deeply
>new social media trend blowing up across anthro centric platforms
>the act of wolves and various canids 'raw dogging' their friends
>can be properly done to any non-canine anthro but is seen most frequently done to humans, and of course it's recorded for their reaction
>would be inconsequential enough to you
>except you unfortunately know the most popular 'influencer' in on the trend
>your roommate
>ever since his videos started hitting tens of thousands of likes and reshares, your life has turned into a hotdog themed hell
>can't even look at hotdogs or sausage the same way anymore
>walking down the condiment isle in the store gives you borderline PTSD attacks
>all because some fuckin' lonely anthros love watching you blow up on your roommate
>comments left on your roommates videos constantly calling you cute and professing their desire to see you 'eat' the hotdog

>Human blood (And cum) sommelier
as long as he doesn't try to get both at once (by biting my cock while I'm cumming), I'd gladly let him have a taste of mine 

>The two of you met when you were at a fancy restaurant
>You were just there to burn the giftcard for the place that you got as your new year's office white elephant gift, he was there to do "blood snob" reviewing things as part of his job
>He was seated a few tables behind you when you accidentally cut yourself on a steak knife
>Milliseconds later he somehow picked up the scent of fresh human blood wafting through the restaurant
>He immediately got up so fast that he knocked over his chair, and began intensely sniffling around the room looking for the scent's source with his cute little bat nose
>(All the while completely ignoring the bewildered restaurateur following him around asking him "sir please, what is the matter?!" and "please sit down sir, you're scaring the other guests...!")
>Until he finally half crashed into your table, his wiggling bat nose coming within an inch of your bleeding thumb, and he came to his senses enough to sheepishly look up and make eye contact you
>Nowadays whenever he has hoity-toity bat friends over he likes to show you off, not only as his boyfriend but also as his "rarest, most delectable, finest quality bloodsuckle", too
>You've had to break apart a few bats fights, wings and angry squeaks flying, because he absolutely refuses to share you

>You will never hear an anthro bat beg you for a syringe of blood because "the plasma in your blood is better than sex"
>You will never watch his eyes go wide when you prick your arm and watch him scramble to find something to collect it in
>You will never jokingly put a hand behind his head and watch him lose any restraint he had
>From just one sip, he can tell how much sleep you've had, what you've eaten over the past 3 days, and if you're aroused
>He also claimed to be able to divine a rough phylogenetic tree, including that you're a carrier for a few heritable genetic conditions, just from a few grams of your hemoglobin
>At first you thought he was just exaggerating for comedic effect but he somewhat angrily INSISTED he was telling the truth, though you refused to believe him
>In the end he ended up taking some of your blood, sending it to a genetic testing service (tearfully, because he wanted to drink it so badly) and showed you the results JUST to prove it to you
>Yfw he was fucking right
>From just one sip, he can tell how much sleep you've had
>Realizes how high your blood pressure is and starts forcing you to exercise and eat better

>Sign up as a new patient for a human clinic, the only clinic in town with a doctor boarded in human primary medicine
>Go there for your first visit, the doctor's some kind of fox, blah blah nice to meet you Anon, blah blah blood pressure a little high blah blah get these labs and see me in a few months
>After refusing a prostate exam (he was oddly pushy about it???), go to get your labs drawn at the outpatient phlebotomy center
>All of the staff are... bats...?
>The guy who draws them keeps saying weird things about you "having great veins" and he literally licks his lips at one point
>Leave slightly creeped out, except you forgot your jacket so you have to turn back
>Except nobody's there when you come back in...?
>You poke your head into the room marked "specimen processing and interpretation" to try to find somebody to help, only to be met with a bat greedily slurping down the vial of your blood and then putting your total LDL and triglycerides down in pen on your chart
>...

>bat bf
>insist you fuck him and cum in him before he drinks from you, since the blood loss usually makes staying erect impossible
>he tastes and swallows your cum like fine wine 
>makes sure to utterly drain your balls and satisfy you completely before going for your throat vampire style

>So, against your better judgment, you agree
>You follow the cat's directions to a dive bar in a shady part of town, and then knock in a specific pattern on a door in the corner
>Sunglasses wearing anthro thugs answer, and usher you into an large, hot and humid lair with few lights and a high ceiling
>Some kind of converted warehouse from back before manufacturing crumpled in the anthro district, you figure?
>In the middle, a large hexagonal fighting ring surrounded by chains
>And inside of it, two enormous anthros fighting
>A wolf and a tiger, you've stepped in right in the middle of things
>And holy SHIT you can see why this is so underground
>This isn't some gentlemanly fisticuffs session, this is a raw, bestial struggle between two forces of nature
>There's clumps of fur, blood and spit flying as the two beasts collide, both using their maws, jaws and claws to do the talking
>After playing keep away for a while, the wolf is finally caught by the tiger, and is overwhelmed in a contest of strength, the tiger biting down hard on the wolf's hackles, his pained and panicked howling almost drowned out by the din of the crowd
>Finally a referee steps in before things go too far, raising the triumphant tiger's bloodied paw up in the air, the himself beast letting out a feral victory roar
>You're seriously worried if the wolf is going to die with how much blood there is, as two anthros wearing uniforms with a red cross on it quietly rush onto the stage and carry the canine out amidst the din
>But your thoughts quickly return to the ring as you feel someone elbow you
>You hear a familiar voice whisper to you "Eyes on the prize, human! Time to earn your pay!", but looking around the feline is nowhere to be seen
>Actually, the entire crowd has thinned around you, leaving you conspicuously out in the open
>And looking back at the stage, the tiger of the hour is staring right at you
>You gulp and almost lose your nerve at the intensity of his staring, his shoulders still heaving and his predatory eyes still constricted from adrenaline
>But you manage to collect yourself and put on the best smile you can given what you just witnessed, waving fenetically while cheering and even wolf whistling (maybe that wasn't a good idea given his opponent, but whatever...?)
>The tiger seems pleased by your tribute to his supreme victory, despite the din of the crowd rising from your antics you can make out a deep, chuffing laugh from the apex predator
>And as if in reply to your display of admiration, the tiger lowers his paw, bares his claws and scrapes them across his pecs all while he shoving his chest out, raising his head and letting out one more animalistic roar of victory, just for you
>Part of your brain is telling you that maybe you shouldn't be here, reinforcing this kind of clearly illegal and dangerous behavior, but it's lost out to the part telling you that hnnnnnnnNNNNNNGGGGGHHH FUCK he's hot
>The tiger dissapears off the stage into the bowels of the building, and you leave with the crowd as the few lights start to go out
>Only for a familiar, much smaller feline to slink beside you and whisper: "Great work out there, human! I have an offer for you, if you're interested. Would you consider turning your guest appearance here into a more... regular one?"
>"Don't worry, you'll get paid just the same as this time. And I have it on good word that a lot of fighters are dying to meet you after seeing you here. Including... well, actually, *ESPECIALLY* our champion today..."
>"Nothing more motivating for a fighter than something, or *someone* to fight for, eh? So, what do you say?"

>canines are "man's best fuckbuddy" to the point that they immediately joined man in space
I love all of the implications of this.

>Canines were fastracked for clearance for spacetravel because if they weren't, it would have triggered separation anxiety on a global scale so severe that it would have had a nonzero chance of ending civilization

I want to see video recordings of the arguments from canine scientists in the early days of the space program, because they probably have them sweating profusely while shaking a bit as they detail how vital "psychological reinforcement via collaboration" is.

Human Cafe by anonymous

A /hmoma/ doujin just dropped, here's the tldr for those, who don't have a translation plugin.
>A masochistic wolf, who's the minister of security, goes to a sex shop to learn what it's like to become a completely subservient dog for a human.

The doujin hand me thinking
>Canines have a very weird, inverse equivalent to human maid cafes
>Where they can go to get spoiled and praised by their (usually human) 'master' for a set time every day
>For a low low membership fee and session charge each time
>("Try for our 'Golden Goodboy' loyalty level!")
>Feels... weird...
>But the pay is almost unreal given the low skilled work required
>You just have to have a passable face, a soothing voice and a nice pair of hands
>Of course, for YOU, this is just a job, a fantasy you help these weird dogs play out
>But for some of them, the line between fantasy and reality is becoming dangerously thin
>And some of them are starting to really think that what they have with you is special, not just a financial transaction...

>some of them are starting to really think that what they have with you is special, not just a financial transaction
Imagine working at a cafe and everyday A massive wolf anthro that could twist you into a pretzel with zero effort comes in and pays you to praise him, pet him, cuddle(fuck) him, and then just one day he shows up outside your apartment door so he can be (your) good boy FOREVER

Many such cases I imagine

>*KNOCKNOCKNOCKNOCKNOCKNOCK*
>"ANOOOON! IT'S MEEEEE! LET ME IN ANOOOON!"
>You awoke to your house being under siege from a roughly 600 pound wolf, and unfortunately you recognize his voice
>He's one of very few of your 'Golden Goodboy' tier patrons at the cafe
>What that actually means is that he's visited you at the cafe literally every day for the past year for at least 30 minutes a day
>For reference, that's at least 3,691,062.50 yen, or 25 thousand usd, he's spent just to spend time with (you)
>In one year
>On a bouncer's salary
>Obsessed would be a gross understatement
>Over the past month he had been trying to spend more and more time with you at the cafe, sometimes trying to stay after closing and loitering around the building when he would finally get kicked out
>You had told your manager that you were starting to get a little scared of his behavior, but he had brushed you off, telling you in a sing-song voice that "it just means you're doing a great job, Anon! He's an excellent patron and he knows our rules, he wouldn't dare put a claw on you!"
>The sound of your front door starting to crack from your stalker's onslaught brings you back into present
>"I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, ANON! I COULD RECOGNIZE YOUR SCENT FROM A HUNDRED MILES AWAY! PLEASE LET ME IN, IT'S ME!"
>What do you do? Your first instinct is to call the police, but this guy brings in so much money to your workplace you might get in trouble or even fired if he gets locked up, even though he's clearly violating the 'no stalking our humans' rule...
>But he clearly wants to take his imaginary relationship to you to the next level, with or without your consent, and that's not going to be good for business, either
>You're explicitly forbidden from having a public relationship all so that you can maintain the illusion of a special relationship with your clients
>Maybe if you're lucky, one of your neighbors will hear the racket and call the cops for you...

This has the all the hallmarks of being a classic case of “inadvertent domestication”… Unfortunately for anon however, under Japanese law he is now legally obligated to take care of this poor wolf now… So in other words, let him in.

Anon needs to take RESPONSIBILITY and give that good-boy what he needs, which are some pets, a walk (with leash of course) and a “treat” (human cum) for being such a good boy!

He'd been improperly domesticated before... which means it's time to do it right. Force that dude to understand his place. Be firm.

That’s when your quiet, reclusive feline neighbor comes out with a Mossberg

Kek
>Fortunately (?), your wish that one of your neighbors would intervene for you miraculously comes true
>Unfortunately, it just so happens to be your... weird... neighbor
>The only interaction you've ever had with him is introducing yourself on your move in 2 years ago, to which he responded with a suspicious glare in total silence before slamming his door on you
>Real charmer, but his timing couldn't have been better
>Right as the lovesick lug managed to snap off one of your door hinges, you hear your neighbor's door fly open and a warning shot from his massive shotgun (which you don't know enough about shotguns to identify), followed by a "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, YOU IMBECILIC HORNDOG?!"
>Instantly the assault on your front door stops, the intense din replaced by an ominous, inhuman growling directed towards your insane neighbor
>H-haha...
>You should probably do something, or else somebody is actually going to die here
>The growling turns into a bloodcurdling roar and you can hear your neighbor yell out "G-GOD DAMN...!" before another shot rings out
>It almost deafens you, but you're pretty sure you heard buckshot ricocheting off of the wall rather than through flesh
>After struggling with the almost destroyed door, hanging on only 2 of its hinges and covered in clawmarks, you emerge to see your neighbor and your, uh, suitor, engaged in their best impression of the Doom cover art, the cat holding his now ruined shotgun with its barrel bent in an almost 90 degree angle off to side and using his free claw to try and hold the hulking canine behemoth at bay
>You yell out 'STOP!' to try to get his attention, and both of them turn towards you
>The canine himself has bloodshot eyes and is literally foaming at the mouth, but on seeing your face it seems like some great weight has been lifted from him
>Your neighbor, on the other hand, looks like he wants to turn his shotgun on you next
>"Anon! Oh thank god, it's you! Please get back inside, i'll keep you safe from this criminal, I promise!"
>"W-what the hell kind of company are you keeping, Anon?! Who the hell is he?!"
>"Who am I?! Who are YOU and why do you think you have the right to bring a weapon anywhere within 100 yards of MY HUMAN?!"
>Quick, you need to think of something to say to defuse the situation!
>"Please, stop it, both of you! You see the truth is... that he's... my boyfriend!"
>Silence as both of them stare at you
>The canine breaks the silence first as his ears fold back and tears start to well up
>"Wh... he's... you have a...? Am I not...?"
>Wait, he thought you meant cat?!
>"Good god, is this the kind of company you keep at your weird human whorehouse job?! It's a damn miracle you haven't been ripped to shreds yet if THIS is your clientele!"
>The cat's unhelpful snark awakens a primal rage inside of the canine, as hackles raise and all of his anger is redirected towards him
>"You... YOU STOLE HIM FROM ME...! I'LL KILL YOU!", followed by a panicked hiss as the wolf's grip starts to tighten around the cat's upper torso
>You know, maybe you really do need to rethink your job after all...

>"You... YOU STOLE HIM FROM ME...! I'LL KILL YOU!", followed by a panicked hiss as the wolf's grip starts to tighten around the cat's upper torso
