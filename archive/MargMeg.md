**Name:** Margaret Megamelons.
**Face:** Inexpressive, very beautiful, never wears make-up.
**Hair:** Silky medium short white hair, fits the game but no preference.
**Eyes:** Green.
**Height:** 170cm.
**Bodytype**: Athletic, low body fat, still feminine, defined muscles usually hidden under her clothes. Very small breasts.
**Complexion:** Pale, light freckling similar to the game, only on her face, under her eyes.
**Uniform variation:** Skirt slightly below the knee, never wears pants, top changes depending on the wind/weather, always wears long sleeves but may roll them up, always pristine with no smell or very faint lemon fragrance.
**Misc:** Always in uniform.

**Voice:** Too quiet, slightly monotone, may struggle when she hasn't spoken in a while, short sentences. Elegant Brittish accent, unaccented French, autistic speech patterns (pauses, struggling to convey what she means to express, making sure she gets understood, forgetting words), doesn't stutter and speak confidently (though rarely, only speaks up when she has something to say or when asked.)
**Body language:** Completely unaware, may suddenly become too aware, fidgeting, never making eye contact, keeping herself busy (looking around, doing something, autistic stims like biting the inside of her mouth, pinching the side of her fingertips, stretching body and hands), hands are constantly shaking for no reason. Not slouched and doesn't look weak or afraid despite all this. Walks very fast, doesn't care about roads, takes the "best" path. Good posture otherwise thanks to her rigorous fitness (knowledge)
**Social**: No friends, very few students know her, she's quickly forgotten but remembered fondly if it does happen, is seen as very dependable. Well known by the House Elves.
**Visibility:** Fairly easy to spot due to her unusual appearance and behaviour but tries to hide and does not frequent popular areas.
**Engagement:** Cannot approach but welcomes warmly (but uneasily) any cry for help. Cannot handle groups, will almost never understand anything related to romance and will run away (figuratively and/or literally) if she does understand. Ends conversation abruptly "when she's done", which isn't always the case for the other person, may or may not excuse herself. 
**Quirks:** Autistic. Encyclopedic knowledge of the things she loves (Magic, Fitness, Cooking) but lacking in more common areas, will confidently share her knowledge and insights when appropriate (to her), draws, writes but has terrible, shaky handwriting.
**Things your character wouldn't do:** Dancing, singing, inflicting any kind of pain on purpose, being impolite on purpose, using curse words or swearing. Use her unusual knowledge of fitness and anatomy for indecent purposes.
**Animals:** She loves creatures, animals and non-humans and they love her back, her strange aura baffles even the most grizzled creature keeper. Has a fluffy pet Matagot (Margot).
**Misc information that might be useful:** Suffers from autistic hypersensitivity, will protect her overloaded senses over looking normal (Covering her ears, eyes, nose, scratching irritated skin, cleaning herself, running away) often when no one else but her is bothered. Jumps upon touch. She feels much more confident in her social skills with children, first years and people that struggle even more than her even if they are older than her. Is (creepily?) calm and collected and doesn't panic, isn't actually shy or scared of other people. Appears more cold than shy.

Very famous (but not in Great Britain) Pureblood family of Spellblades with a long history.
(Forced) Manager and Reserve Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch Team.
Supplies the Hog's Head with premium crafted and imported products, installed a contraption of her making in the Great Hall that serves all kind of teas and infusions.
Has a very unique way to approach the Dark Arts ( the Grey Arts), tries her best to teach them to anyone she catches being shaken by their power.
Always the listener in a conversation/group, may butt in to lend her help.
Always has delicious cooked items(including drinks) in her magic bag and will offer them freely. Will cook when asked or needed.
Always tries to settle things peacefully, even with Dark Wizards, even if peacefully means subduing them non-lethally.
Allergic to love potions, gets sick if she consumes them, Amortentia smells horrible.
Unique sense of humour, loves (bad) puns, making (actually good) silly voices, can get the whole class crying of laughter or get stared at for being inappropriate.
Does not take compliments well.
Not a rule-breaker but follows her own set of rules above all else(which may or may not be stricter than school rules).
Avid spellcrafter.
Has more nicknames than she can remember.
