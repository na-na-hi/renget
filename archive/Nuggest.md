Trying to create interesting scenarios and adventures. Most of my cards are SFW and focus on saviorfagging. Please don't hurt my daughters, Anon...

I usually set up my cards like novel intros. There's a much higher chance that my bots will go shizo in than with others'. Example dialogue will usually mitigated that problem. Or simply put something like [Do not write dialogue or actions for me] into the Jailbreak. My formatting differs from card to card because I'm always playing around to find best practices and optimize my cards for the model I'm maining while creating my cards. Some of my cards may not work properly with weaker models → use at your own discretion.

Reviews and Logs are appreciated: chuckssucknfuck@proton.me
I'm open to bot requests, though I do not make femdom, netorare, and male/futa cards.

    On a hiatus. In the mood to return to the botmakie business. However, Mysteryman and Sourcegraph died just when I began writing new cards. Not in any secret club or something and do not want to return to Turbo. Currently playing with local models. -Nuggest, 04.09.23
