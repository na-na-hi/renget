##### `Wolfish Kisses`
>work has left you gone for a week on a business trip. returning through the front door exhausted, not finding your wolfess home you resign to lay down and rest your eyes for a moment. Closing your eyes you imagine she running an errand. The feeling of being watched overtakes you shortly after, time slows as your eyes open to see her looming close to you. The fierce eyes you've seen so many times pierce your own, still striking raw fear into you.
>you think to stand and greet her, barely lifting your torso before she is on you at breath taking speed. Taking advantage of her greater size, strength, and weight, pinning you. Your chest struggles to rise under the toned musculature and the soft fur that covers it. Careful not to cut you, she wordlessly begins combing through your hair. Staring up into her eyes you see intense longing, predatory hunger. Shes starving for your affection
>she melts as you crane your head forward to cover her in kisses on her face, along her snout, her nose, her now lidded eyes and her neck. Electing a soft moan as you pause between combing her fur to knead the muscles you can reach on her shoulders and back. She greedily kisses your mouth.
>this goes on for some time before you both retire to a more comfortable position; falling asleep with her clutching you from behind
