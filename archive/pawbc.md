>muzzle her so she can't bite you
>proceed to run your hands through her fur, ignore her growling
>pet all over her body, feel her fluff, her curves and those strong muscles beneath
>nuzzle into her neck while scratching behind her ears
>her growling goes silent
>nibble her throat, gently but still dominant. for a moment she tenses up, then she gives in
>remove her muzzle and kiss her, hard and deep
