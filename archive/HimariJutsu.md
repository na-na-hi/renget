#Himari's Signature Jutsu
Like any young ninja, Himari more than likely knows a couple dozen jutsu of various kinds, from wind blades, to spitting globs of poison, simple clone jutsus, and more. The following are her primary tools however.

##Miko Clan Divine Arts: Sacred Tonic Production
Type: Ninjutsu (Divine Substance Production)
Nature: Divine
Class: D~B-Class
Stats:
Power A
Range A

Description:
-Creates her special healing elixirs. The jutsu is long and tiring, but the produced medicine has a lone shelf-life, essentially allowing the jutsu to be prepared in advance.
-Much like common medical arts, the Miko clan's medicine production techniques are a wider array of jutsu rather than a single jutsu. At the highest rank (S), their medicine is said to cure any illness and even to wake the recently departed. Sadly the chakra costs of that jutsu are so high that ritual arts are essentially a requirement, demanding the majority of the Miko clan to toil for a month, only to produce a single pill. As a result, only one such elixir is produced every year and their usage requires the authorization of the Hokage.
--At B-Rank, a single cast of the jutsu can take as much as 15 minutes and requires the majority of Himari's chakra reserves, however it's a true divine medicine capable of regenerating lost limbs at a visible pace, let alone closing wounds or mending bones. Himari generally carries around five of these at a time, two of which are left in the care of her squad mates. Unless it's her only option to save a life, Himari will not use this jutsu won't she's out in the field as it's too tiring and time consuming to risk using. B Rank pills are red colored.
--At C-Rank, a single cast of the jutsu takes Himari a minute to cast and a significant amount of chakra, enough that she could at most produce half a dozen elixirs before running out of chakra. Such pills cannot regenerate lost body mass, but can close wounds, mend bones, cleanse poison, and accelerate production of blood, allowing most non-fatal wounds to be healed in a short time. Himari generally carries around a few dozen of these at a time, three of which are given to each of her teammates. C Rank pills are brown colored.
--At D-Rank, a single cast of the jutsu takes Himari several seconds and a fair amount of chakra, but can produce several elixirs with a single cast. At this level, it's viable to cast the jutsu in combat if the user isn't actively being attacked. However, the pills can only treat the symptoms of what ails the one comsuming it. Wounds will stop bleeding, but won't close. The effects of poison will merely be suppressed for a few minutes. Bones will stick together well enough to hold weight but won't be properly mended, risking further damage. Etc. Himari carries a few of these on her person for use in other jutsus, but mainly relies on creating them in the field when needed for emergency healing. D Rank pills are grey colored.

-Note that she keeps poisons mixed in with her healing elixirs, just in case an enemy attempts to pickpocket her. She can tell them apart just fine but to most people both are identical, even down to the amount and kind of chakra held within.
-Also note that elixirs of all ranks will have their effects diverted into resolving curse energy first and foremost, meaning that the healing effects will only take place when the consumer's body has no curse energy circulating within it and that curse arts user's will struggle to use any curse arts until the elixir's effects are expended.

##Miko Clan Poison Style: Rotted Blessings Jutsu
Type: Ninjutsu (Divine Poison Release)
Nature: Divine, Poison
Class: D~B-Class
Stats:
Power A
Range D
Usability D
Efficiency C
Description:
-An unusual Miko Clan jutsu that relies on the thin line that separates medicine from poison. This jutsu requires an elixir made by the Miko Clan as an ingredient, transforming it into a poisonous pill instead, with effects that are as toxic as it was originally rejuvenating. When consumed or when Himari activates the elixir with a simple handsign, the elixir detonates into a cloud of poison. As long as elixir's are prepared ahead of time, the jutsu itself is fairly quick and moderately easy to use. The rank of the jutsu is the same as the rank of the pill being converted into poison, requiring correspondingly more time and chakra to perform.
-No sane opponent would stand there and let Himari lob a pill at them and the AoE of the poison clouds aren't very big, so she generally relies on more indirect methods. For example, tricking her opponent into stealing it or using the elixirs as impromptu landmines.
-Himari naturally know show to perform normal poison style jutsu that won't expend her precious pill supply, but those would at most have a Power of C and she only knows D rank jutsu for normal poison style.

##Name: Miko Clan Poison Style: Stagnant Miasma Jutsu
Type: Ninjutsu (Divine Poison Release)
Nature: Divine, Poison
Class: D~C-Class
Stats:
Power C
Range B
Usability D
Efficiency C
Description:
-Creates a thick, poisonous grey fog. The poison itself numbs the victim's senses and motor functions, eventually leading to sensory depravation and paralysis after a long period of exposure. Furthermore, the fog is thick and covers a wide area, obscuring the senses of everyone other than the caster. The fog itself doesn't have any particular scent, nor is it painful to breath in. Between the subtle effects of the poison and the unassuming qualities of the fog, most victims are unaware of when exactly they were poisoned, mistaking it for a normal concealment jutsu.
-This jutsu is cast by crushing a number of D-Rank poison elixirs made via 'Miko Clan Poison Style: Inverse Blessings' as an ingredient and cannot be cast without them. If C-rank poison elixirs are used to cast the jutsu, the rank of the jutsu can also be increased, and the poison changes from a paralytic grey poison fog to a lethal brown poison fog. B-Rank poison elixirs could produce an even stronger jutsu, but she doesn't carry enough B-Rank elixirs to perform a B-Rank version of this jutsu.
-Can be combined with various basic divine energy infused wind-style jutsu in order to properly weaponize the poison, but doing so weakens the jutsu by dispersing the fog. Ordinary wind-style jutsu will simply pass through the fog without dispersing it, but jujutsu will also disperse the fog regardless of what kind of jujutsu it is. Otherwise the fog also makes a great cover for other more offensive poison style jutsu.
-Himari's teammates can avoid being poisoned by consuming an elixir, but otherwise don't have any special advantages.

##Name: Divine Wind Style: Vanishing Gale Jutsu
Type: Ninjutsu (Divine Wind Release)
Nature: Divine, Wind
Class: C-Class
Stats:
Power B
Range E
Usability C
Efficiency B
Description:
-A more advanced concealment jutsu that suffuses the air around the user with divine energy and causes them to become invisible, along with anyone else in the tiny bubble of holy wind. Himari herself only recently learned this jutsu, and as a result her concealment isn't perfect. Once she starts moving quickly, a blurry outline of her figure becomes visible. As a result, she tends to use it either outside of combat or together with her 'Miko Clan Poison Style: Toxic Mist Jutsu'.
