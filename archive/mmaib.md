 The War of the Dark Aurorai


### Foreword

> Aurorai started life as a proposed story to a very different fangame which the author was part of the writing team. The head honchos however, deemed his work too dark for the game. Humbled, he accepts the judgment, but thought that his draft would be a waste if he just trashed it. Then one day, he had an epiphany. Why not make a Fire Emblem mod with the story, he said. And so that day, the Aurorai we know is born.

### The Celestium and Aurorai's Creation

> The Celestium is a council of four deities who got together to create and keep watch over Aurorai. The continent is named Aurorai, after the auroras that dance around the night skies as the sign of favor of  The Celestium. Born from a great shift in the infinite seas, there arose a new and promising land full of potential. All four can take on any appearance they please, but they all have their true forms and can wield various weapons, according to their domain.

#### Covernius
> Strong and just, all mortals of Aurorai owe their genealogy to him, even if its furthest removed. He is responsible for birthing the myriad kinds of mortals that inhabit Aurorai today, much to the chagrin of his true love and compatriot. He leads the deity quartet and his doctrine stands to this day as the prevailing moral guide amongst the land. His true form is a hulking, absolutely sculpted man with immaculate golden hair arranged in a neat manner. His face is chiseled like fine marble, with eyes made of white fire. He is wearing a cape attached to a small chestpiece, and bracers and leg armor colored white with a gold trim adorned with a divine design and triangles. He wears a crown on his head with yet another triangle and wield the Polaris Blade, a sword shaped after the popular depiction of the North Star.

#### Auroia

> A nurturing woman, Auroia is essentially the mother of Aurorai. She is responsible for releasing auroras into the night sky as a sign that The Celestium watches over them. She is Covernius' true love and never leaves him, despite the many dalliances his lover had. She governs the skies above Aurorai and the day-night cycle. Her true appearance reflects the beauty of the night skies: black hair that streaks into blue and violet that sparkles with actual stars within, a motherly feminine figure and pale skin smoother than finest silk, topped off with a gentle face that has eyes change color on emotion. The auroras themselves manifest as her clothing, the dancing colors rippling across her bosom and her rear all the way to her legs. Her bracers are colored like dusk on the trim and dawn on the main. They emanate radiance whenver she moves her hands.

#### Nijongis

> The wise one of the group. He is credited with originating all the spoken language of Aurorai and is charged with receiving all prayers and rituals from the mortals. He is also credited for fostering culture across Aurorai, making sure such cultures are just and cannot harm without reason. His true form is less buff than Covernius' with short, messy hair colored similarly to that of a  bird-feather quill, brown and black streaking across the dull white, coupled with a longer, worked face that has dull yellow eyes. He is adorned with a robe and sash adorned with the praise of all languages in Aurorai, and carries a scroll with him that carries every language's wordbase that he draws fighting power from.

#### Rojoris

> The bold, albeit cold one of the group. He ensures that karma flows naturally and the mortals are rewarded or punished for their works. He is credited with inspiring most, if not all of Aurorai's legal constitutions and penal codes. His true form rivals that of Covernius in musculature, but his hair is a bold shade of red instead of his gold. He stands in armor consisting of heavy pauldrons flowing into a battle worn cape and similarly heavy looking bracers and leg armor. Where Covernius has flowing designs, he has rough ones, to convey the hard justice that can befall a mortal. He wields a huge steel gavel that can be used as a warhammer or a magical sceptre.

### The Nations of Aurorai

#### Polaria
***
Capitol: Holopolis
Current ruler: King Covigo(7th)
Established: 1 H

>Found in the center of Aurorai, Polaria is home to the biggest amount of mortals in the land, a big percentage of such being humans. Has a temperate climate excellent for farming or city life. Throughout the Holomini years, the country's leaders have enjoyed their inputs being followed by the rest of Aurorai. They also have appointed their own Hand, a trusted ally to oversee the daily operatjons of the castle and assisting the King/Queen. Kizuna Ai and the First Knights from the olden days of The Great Aurorai War trace their origins here. Polaria is reputed as the place to make it big although its cities may be too busy for someone not too used to them. Units hailing from here are Sora, Shion, Noel, Temma, Luna, Miko and Amelia, as well as most of Guild Tempus.


#### Savan
***
Capitol: Lionsgard
Current Ruler: Queen Botan Shishiro(12th)
Established: 2 H

>The vast flatlands of Savan provide a home to a myriad of people endowed with animal features and abilities. Queen Botan is the 9th ruler from the old Shishiro line overall and 7th since the Avian Uprising. Hawkrose Takane was the 3rd and last Savan ruler from the Takane line which took power during the Avian Uprising. The uprising ended with the remnants of the Takane faction and the Shishiro faction signing a ceasefire in 72 H in exchange for them being granted a mountainous island to call their home, under Shishiro rule. The King or Queen has a Council of their own choosing guiding her decisions, which still exists until this day . Cities are sparse and less sophisticated because the people value their rolling plains, which is home to most of their hunt and plant food. Savan has Territories that make up the land. Units from this nation include, aside from Botan herself: Pekora, Korone, Mio, Shien, and Fubuki.

#### Diarnuit
***
Capitol: Le Eclipse
Ruler: Uriel Amane(8th) (angel)
Established: 2 H

>Divided into the rough-and-tumble steampunk West and the high-fantasy magitech East, Diarnuit is truly the picture of night and day making one whole. Humanoids like elves of differing creeds, all types of fairies, dwarves and orcs of varying types would be all found in the country. Angels in particular are held in high regard in Diarnuit, essentially becoming the ruling class. Cities here are of remarkable quality for both halves of the nation, be it the mighty engines that power the West, or the magics that power the East. Diarnuit is the highest nation in terms of above-sea levels, which contributes to a cooler climate than expected even for the seaside areas in the East. Units like Lamy, Kanata, Aki and Flare, come from here.

#### Cita Azur 
***
Capitol: New Poseidon
Current Leader: Councillor Dolph (13th since freed, 22nd overall)
Established: 46 H 

>First discovered by seafarers from Polaria, Cita Azur is haven for all people plying the seas. Merchants, pirates and just about all manner of ship-using profession regard Cita Azur as the center of such things. Chief among such denizens are the Houshou Pirates, established in 585 H by Marn Houshou, ancestor to the current leader Marine who appears as a unit. When The Sinking happened, what little of the Atlantean population that was left found refuge here. Such refugees include Atlantean royalty Gura Gawr, who also appears as a unit. When it comes to coastal getaways, Cita Azur is nigh-unbeatable in sheer beauty of its coasts as well as the warm, balmy climate befitting its location and height above sea.

#### Nero Eterna
***
Capitol: Yozora Eternus
Current Ruler: Death Muertos (13th)
Established: 16 H
>A breakaway from Negazion, Nero Eterna gives demons, imps and the like a home. Most elder magic is said to have originated in this swampy, humid and wet lowland. Rivers snake through the marshland making for a very humid climate especially on the seaside western parts. Denizens make their homes from the imposing and scary-looking trees in their dominion, if not from the highlands surrounding the mountain range. The nation has the lowest above-sea levels of all Aurorai. The Fallen Star Graveyard resides here, resting place of many a famed individual, like Kizuna Ai and the First Knights. Units from here include Ayame, Towa, Choco, Calliope and Oga.

#### Stadt Des Feuers
***
Capitol:  Flammiena
Current Ruler: Coco Kiryu (4th)
Established: 350 H
>The youngest nation of all Aurorai, Stadt Des Feuers is located in a small island state off the coast of Cita Azur. The island they reside was all that was left of the old nation of Atlantis, banished to the depths as punishment for their crimes in The Great Aurorai War. Weather here is warm and balmy but not humid which the residents are thankful for due to the island in its current form having high above- sea levels. Aside from Coco, Kiara also appears as a unit as well as her Kiara's Fighter Phoenix squad; a small squad of phoenixes and fiery-hearted warriors in general under her name.

#### Blancopolis
***
Capitol: Citablanca
Current Ruler: Grand Pontifex Damaso (36th)
Established: 1 H

>A theocratic nation, Blancopolis originally was the place that ardently worshipped the entirety of The Celestium. Formed just after Polaria, its tied with it for being the oldest established nation of Aurorai. In 619 H, a new doctrine was rapidly spread to the citizens that enforces strict gender rules and segregation propagated by the then-Bishop Damaso. Shortly after swiftly and ruthlessly ascending the throne in 620 H, radical changes were implemented in the nation. Major of such changes included every male and female interaction that is not by blood nor adoption is screened and monitored carefully by a board of priests per estate. Women in particular are forced to serve the clergymen and cater to their every whim while men were treated as expendable bodies, toiling the vast state-owned farms, building new temples, running security in the clergy's properties, and other hard labor, including fighting conflicts if their masters demands it.

#### Anakondia
***
Capitol: Jaggeskal
Current Ruler: Grand Hydra Karonda (12th)
Established: 17 H
 
>Home to a group of united reptilian amazonic wartribes, Anakondia's marshy islands saw almost 2 decades of violent war amongst the tribes ever since the start of the Holomini years. Ever since the end of the Snake Wars, the ruler has always comes from the Blue Anaconda tribe, only ever challenged remotely by the Red Viper, Purple Adder and Black Boa tribes. Unlike most nations, women are the dominant gender in its societies, with laws and rights catering to the feminine wiles more. The nation is at its most dangerous at the time of the Red Ovulation, a long ritualistic hunting session spanning the whole of the month Virgo where they kidnap any male they come across for slavery and breeding purposes. The tribes agree on one thing: women are the superior race of Aurorai. They believe that the women Guardians are not enforcing their "superiority" harder on the land and on their "lesser" male peers.

#### Negazion
***
Capitol: Direcore City
Current Ruler: Vermel Darkstar(18th)
Established: 7 H

 >An enigma of a land, Negazion is a barren chain of 3 islands in its current form. Sunk in a great flood for their agression in the Great War, Negazion's landscape is a shadow of their former glory: wide highlands that rival that of Diarnuit's. Today, it's dull yellow sands send a harsh greeting to anybody who dare visit, as well as chronicle the various magical experiments the government made to improve their surroundings for food. Negazian royal mages will push relentlessly for any advantages they can use to get back at the Aurorai mainland; monstrous weapons, overt and covert operations all across Aurorai, and a myriad of fearsome dark spells not even the shamans of Nero Eterna dare invoke. Principal among these is dark spell called Dox Majica, a spell only the highest and most decorated of Negazian royal mages can wield without major repercussions including their own life or sanity. This evil spell feeds on the negative emotions and memories of the victim and drains all positives out, leaving the victim either dead or a husk easily puppeteered by magic. In the catacombs of Blackstar Castle, the royal mages have mastered the science of cloning, which they use to supplant their military numbers including war beasts like horses, pegasi, and wyverns. Ruling succession is a very serious and violent matter, being decided by a duel to the death between the reigning Tyrannus and the challenger. All citizens here have been mandated to not know the history of Aurorai save for their origin, the Great War(highlighting their victories), their defeat, and their efforts to even the score. Being in the military in this nation grants perks normal citizens do not have access to, which only lengthens as they rise up the ranks.




### The Order of Iridescent Guardians

The main cast of the game. The Guardians are your key to averting this crisis and bring peace to Aurorai once more.

>Characters are ordered and grouped according to order of appearance.

#### Prologue

**Sora**
-The first Guardian and the main Lord of this game. Revered for her grace and beauty even in combat, all the other Guardians highly regard her and new Guardians are expected to be acquainted with her. Because of this, she rather feels cut off from the rest of her colleagues save her closest ones like Azki due to the sheer respect she commands. She, together with her friend A'chan and the King Covigo himself, are regarded as the Founding Triad of The Order.
>Home: Polaria

**A'chan**
-Sora's long-time friend and Kinghand of Polaria. All operations regarding the Guardians are overseen by her. Hardworking to a fault, people around the castle take upon themselves whenever possible to look after her. For such hard work, in 628 H, a young lass named Nodoka Harusaki was appointed as her page.
>Home: Polaria

#### Chapter 1

**Noel**
-A dutiful officer of the Polarian Army. She takes her job seriously, always tending to those in need with her trusty mace at her side. Born in the rural slums of Polaria, Noel took up the armor to give back to her family, especially her brother who worked as a trader of sorts. She has a deep friendship with her fellow Fantasia Brigade member, the elf Flare Shiranui.
>Home: Polaria

**Flare**
-An outgoing and frank elf from Diarnuit. Wanting to be different than most in her town her age, she took up the spear instead of the bow most elves would pick up. Born to the fire elf estates bordering West Diarnuit, she is as fiery like her name, a flame that would lead the way. Regards the Polarian knight and co-member in the Fantasia Brigade Noel Shirogane a very trusted friend.
>Home: Diarnuit

#### Chapter 2

**Aruran**
-A half-breed of a human and elf, he is half-brother to Flare, but both care not for the distinction. They both are fathered by an elf named Lack. He is a gentleman that runs a restaurant con bar in uptown Holopolis, hosting people from all walks of life, organizing parties every once in a while. His Knight colleagues make him the butt of jokes often but he takes it all in good fun.
>Home: Polaria

**Enma**
-An aloof swordfighter raised in the hustle and bustle of the capitol city of Polaria. In studying the blade, her journey led her to many places all over Aurorai before getting the call by King Covigo to be an Advisor in The Order. She takes care personally of Ina, Gura and Amelia, and is very protective of them. She will take any length to support them and keep them from harm.
>Home: Polaria

**Ina**
-Laidback and chill, she is a priestess of the Ancient Ones, entities that power the societies of Nero Eterna. Her general demeanor sets her apart from her peers bar the general aversion to the outdoors. She has been given leave by them to explore the world and pursue her passion: art. However, she may have to stow her brush away and bring out her tomes earlier than she'd like as war looms over the horizon.
>Home: Nero Eterna

#### Chapter 3

**Izuru**
-A tacticurn agent, he prefers empty, quiet spaces to himself. Born to a dying mother and deadbeat father, Izuru tried to make ends meet at a tender age. His efforts were futile as his beloved mother passed at age 10. Since then, he has resorted to petty thievery to not starve to death, getting with dubious crowds. King Covigo one day decided to pick him off the streets after seeing a battered Izuru reeling from a failed heist of the castle kitchen by himself. He owes the King deeply for this.
>Home: Polaria

**Miko**
-Born to a family of shrine maidens, in the northern reaches of Polaria, hers was a simple life. As required of shrine maidens, staff lessons she took and aced them, despite her usual antics. The war upended her idyllic life, forcing her to abandon the shrine she just has been entrusted to, running to the fringes of  Savan and healing injured and sick people with her staff mastery. She may be childlike in speech, but her helpfulness as well as honesty is of an adult's.
>Home: Polaria

#### Chapter 4

**Aqua**
-An erstwhile maid in Castle Crystale, she is very reserved and cannot be talked to as easily than average. Beneath the shy demeanor though lies great talent in archery, with precise aim said to rival even that of the Lion Queen herself. Worried for her friends in the Second Brigade, Aqua has took it upon herself to look for them, starting in Savan, where she heard her closest friend the witch ran off to after the great invasion.
>Home: Polaria

**Shion** 
-A prodigy of the Polarian Magical Academy, her confidence is backed by results. Most who'd see her antics would regard her a brat, but under such exterior lies some insecurities, like her age and her background, which had a rough record in Aurorai's magical history. Everyday, she toils for the day the Murasaki name to be in what she deems their proper place.
>Home: Polaria

#### Chapter 4x
(Shinove's bio would not be present here despite appearing as playable here.)

**The Aspirant**
(Aka Avatar)(M/F variants)
-A fan of the Guardians, they have dreamed all their lives of being called to join their ranks. They come from the latest line of a knightly House from Polaria that have lost their lives in defense of the manor in the Negazian onslaught, including them. But they get a second chance from Omega, reviving them to fight again. Now, they carry the honor of their entire knightly House and the burden of avenging his family and all who served their House.
>Home: Polaria

**Temma**
-Cheerful and eccentric if not downright dark, he is a Knight of Polaria. He is friendly towards the citizens but can be merciless against those who would threaten them. To talk to more people, he studies the different languages of Aurorai in his spare time. After he and a few others on castle guard duty fled the Negazian onslaught, guilt haunts him; thinking he failed Polaria. On the run, he meets an eccentric pair...
>Home: Polaria

**Pekora**
-The shy but devious heir of the Pekoland territory in Savan. Her tenure as a Guardian is a story of personal development, from being as closed as a clam to being more open to her peers, with their help. The disturbance in House Usada after pretenders to Duke Piko's throne spurred on by Negazion made her flee along with her trusted retainer, Moona, to not put her family in any more danger. She puts her ability to wield light magic into wacky and zany uses much to the chagrin of both her pursuers and bystanding citizens alike.
>Home: Savan

**Moona**
-Atop her pegasus, Moona is an illustration of beauty in the face of battle, her long lilac hair flowing in the wind as she swoops down upon enemies or merely ferrying her liege Pekora around. Becoming her retainer marked a dramatic turn in her personality, becoming more unabashed and open with expressing herself. Unbeknownst to most, within her is a minor moon goddess named Hoshinova, who amplifies her combat abilities, including latent magic only ever seen radiating around her.
>Home: Diarnuit

#### Chapter 5

**Ayame**
-A noble-born oni swordswoman from Nero Eterna's upper echelons. Refusing to be tied down to typical nobility activities, she left the Nakiri estate despite the protests of her parents. One day, she met with Fubuki Shirakami unprompted in an inn somewhere in downtown Polaria. The conversation later swung into an offer of a spot in The Order. Ayame grabbed on to the opportunity to distinguish herself from her noble-born peers back homes as well as the opportunity to master her two blades.
>Home: Nero Eterna

#### Chapter 6

**Korone**
-A knight of Savan, her boundless energy allows her to take an entire day's guard shift by herself and never doze off. She has an eccentric fascination with people's fingers, never failing to take notice whenever possible and convenient. As a dogwoman, her heightened hearing and smelling has kept the Lion's Keep personal bakery safe and its wares untouched.
>Home: Savan

#### Chapter 7

**Lamy**

-Hailing from Argenian nobility, Lamy effectively juggles duty between two nations; her native Diarnuit, and her closest friend's Savan, of which said friend is Queen. To this day, Lamy is the only non-Savanese to hold a high position in the royal court, something that has resulted in jealous whispers around the Keep. Her gentle face belies the alcohol tolerance fit for a brigand, not that of a noblewoman like her.
>Home: Diarnuit

**Botan**
-After beating her male siblings for the throne, she is the first female to rule Savan. A stoic and laidback character in court, Botan can be described as nigh unflappable in every situation. Her combat skills are peerless, combining masterful archery with her innate ability to turn into a majestic and fierce white lion like the rest of the Shishiro bloodline. At court, she is always credited with being the most level-headed among the royal council when they convene to discuss Savanese affairs. In this looming war, her weak side may finally be revealed to many and her more beastly side unleashed, as the safety and wellbeing of her people grow ever more threatened.
>Home: Savan

**(!)Mio**
-The motherly royal council to Queen Botan, she takes care of feeding everyone who works for Lion's Keep. Most of her projects are orphanages and feeding programs, a testament to her motherly nature. She also is a talented practioner in the divining arts, with Tarot cards as her medium of choice. With her matured wisdom, she guides her equally matured Queen in her decisions and defends her with elder magic learned alongside her divining magics.

#### Chapter 8

**Calliope**
-The First Apprentice of Nero Eterna's reigning Rex Mortis, Death Muertos. Calliope's talent and hardwork make her an inspiration as well as the target of a few jealous whispers. The Rex Mortis' most trusted person, she can be often seen taking over his authority whenever he's away for official business, with mostly splendid results. Calliope can quite be a perfectionist, never settling for "good enough" in everything she does. Rumors are circulating Nero High Hall that allegedly, she is being groomed by Death to take command as Rex Mortis as he ever nears his impending retirement
>Home: Nero Eterna

 
**Gura**
-Carefree and happy-go-lucky she may appear, she carries a great burden. She is among the few carryovers from the defunct nation of Atlantis, and even fewer remaining nobility. She came awash into Cita Azur's shores in her robes and carrying her trident, one of the few surviving pieces of Atlantean history. To her surprise, most people were charmed by her demeanor and physique, although some others have less-than-savory designs from her. She is forced to run however as Negazian tries to round up whatever it can of it's old ally in The Great Aurorai War.
>Home: Cita Azul

**Suisei**
-Her origins are a mystery, allegedly a descendant of Covernius and Auroia. When she first came into rural western Polaria, she felt from the skies with a powerful crash similar to that of a comet. Not helping with such allegations is her beauty, said to be a result of such divine heritage. Another indicator of her alleged heritage is her axe. She and her axe have cut down many foes and chilling accounts from those lucky enough to tell the tale say that she did so with glee and in a vicious manner. With such skill and killing drive, she has earned the moniker "Suicopath", an apt name for her battlefield antics.
