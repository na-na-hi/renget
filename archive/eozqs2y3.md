Yoru sees her last set of customers out of the cafe, with a mischevious and a heart symbol made with her hands.
"Byyyeee!~  Request me next time and I'll _shower_ you in aaaaalll my _love_" she says, making some salary men blush.  Her clients were usually people who wanted more of girlfriend experiance, the type who wanted to be told how much they mattered to Yoru and all the usual affirmations: Gifts, tips, a few dates, and even a marriage proposal a few months ago.
Ichioka-sama had to step in and make it clear Yoru couldn't just go through the ceremony to dig for gold: Her workers were much more dignified than that.  She correctly assumed that Yoru intended to that and much more to her short-term husband.

Being a demon hunter came with rules on how she had to use her eyes to not cause a stir, as the dreaded three-letter-men were always looking for obvious targets.  Yoru could charm anyone without a curse into being her pleasure slave, but she had to fight that urge and appease the lust demon in her brain in others ways.

%purple% "Flash them a nice view of your ass, they'll be back tommorow ready to shower you in their love~ %%
Yoru grins, ready to give her last guests of the night a final treat before her hands are swatted away from her skirt by Akari: "How uncouth, your curse of lustful indecency is fine in small and finite doses, but overdosing the customers on your particuler appeal will have us classified as an entirely differant kind of business" she says in her usal long-winded from.
"Yes, Ichioka-sama, would you like to punish me?~" Yoru says, sending a mischevious look to the short vampire girl.
"Your voices must be kept under control, and I must oblige your cravings it seems" Akari says with a sigh as undoes Yoru's high collar, scratching her long nails on her with just enough force to cause pain but not break skin.  The noble vampire looks her nails over afterward, and looks back down on her somehwat problematic but inarguably populer employee.

%purple% "She loves you enough to mark you as hers, embrace the pleasure of pain, and make euphoria your state of mind~" %%
A wave of pleasure and appeasing control washed over Yoru, as if she could think again.  She watches a certain lazy ladyboy, dressed in his usual school girl subar baby bait outfit enters the cafe right before closing time, causing Akari to sigh, but put on a nice face.

"Ko-chan!  Your soooo lucky!  I get to be your maid for this little slice of the night~"
"Or maybe you'd like me to teach you the _trick of the trade?_  A rare few men can resists a lady who lives to _service_ others~"
"No thanks... Yuki is making me go to try and meet-cute with Ashton-san, but I'm so tiiiireeed..."
"This late for just one guy?" Yoru asks as she sits down by him.
"Yeah... she says you should get a real job"
"Tell Ki-chan that my job is to _pleasure_ others, so being a cafe maid is good until that hostess club finally offers me a wage"
"Yeah (Yawn) she heard you.  Can I get a coffee already?  Sugar and milk please"
"Coming right up mistress~" Yoru says as she stands up and smooths her skirts out.

%yellow% "You should just let her take your third leg off and give you a rack: It'll fix your voice too" %%
"But that means I have to use tampons and all that junk.  Thats way more effort"
%yellow% "You already wear a bra, and I can teach you all about your cute new body when you give me more control over it.  Your just trying to cling to that little itty bit of manliness you have, right?" %%
Makoto is quiet as Yuki grins over his shoulder: he had that extremely small amount of pride left, even as he sat in a cafe wearing a pleated skirt, panties, earrings... he looked like a girl with broad shoulders than any kind of man.  Yuki could only smile at her progress on the boy.

"Here you go mistress!~" Yoru says as she brings his coffee, a heart drawn with cream on top.
"I grant thee the blessing of delicousness!" she says as more cheer than most customers get.  Everyone knows that a cute girl blessing your coffee makes it taste better.
"You know mistress, if you _really_ want to pull in the rich boys, theres a mixer I got an invite to in a nice part of town, right near a school of really rich kids, if your not busy tommorow I can make you sparkle like a diamond so they'll rip eachother apart to get their hands on you"
Makoto sips his coffee, and cocks his head.
"Ki-chan's done a good job with your skincare, nails, and makeup, but a schoolgirl isn't going to turn heads here: We need to find you a proper evening cocktail dress that shows off your figure and some heels to give you that perfect leg shape~"
"Heels?  Sounds like a pain..."
"Ko-I mean Mistress, do this for _me_, ok?" Yoru says, breaking out the puppy dog eyes.  Makoto sighs a bit, drinking his coffee as he listens to the girl in his head.
"Fiiiiiine, I'll ditch at lunch and meet you here" he says as he hands Yoru his payment, and her tip.  Yoru sways her hips excitedly looking at the money, giving the traditioanl salute of the cafe maid, a heart made of the thumb and pointer finger.
Makoto gives her a weary smile as he gets up and smooths his skirt out: "See ya tommorow then, Ru-chan" 
"Have a good night mistress~"
"Bye..."

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yoru wore her usual immodest clothes to meet with Makoto, a big purse she stole from a second hand store closely guarded under her right arm as she counted the money that Amaryllis was willing to conjur up for her.  It was agaisnt the rules to use demon eyes to steal things, but it was fair game to get "discounts", which was the only way her scheme was going to work.  
5000 Yen was enough to get Makoto ready to impress rich kids: She's managed shopping sprees with less without having to steal and get yelled at by Mari and Amiryllis.  She looked at her phone and checked the time impatiently while sipped her free coffee for the day.
%purple% "Don't let him be shy, if he wants sugar mama or papa he has to work for it just like you do honey"~ %%
"These are refined people, they expect a bit class from their sluts, though maybe if he gets lucky we may have to spring for a lingerie set..."
She looked online at what style would work best with his boyish figure while she waited.

Thankfully, Makoto was  only 30 minutes late as he came in dressed in his usual schoolgirl uniform.  It amazed Yoru he was allowed to wear that despite the records probably saying he was male.  Guess the loud guys on the radio were right sometimes, but so was a broken clock.

As Makoto sat down, Yoru could tell that her protege had been spurred to do a bit of prep: His nails were freshly done in pastel colors and shining with fake rhinestones.  His makeup shimmered in the midday sun that stremed through the cafe's windows along with his washed hair.
"Ki-chan must have been nagging you this morning~"
"Yeah... and that Meet-cute was a disaster so she's been so loooouuuuud"
Yoru pets his hair, feeling its softness firsthand and smiling: "Its alright, she knows to trust Ru-chan, right?"
"...She says she doesn't want her future body to have aids, so I can't spend the night with you"
"Well thats rude, I keep myself clean for my darlings" she says with her arms crossed at the indignity of the ghost girl's words.
"Either way, I know you don't have a good party dress so were going shopping for that and a nice pair of heels, maybe even somethign nice to wear under all that if my little protege gets _lucky_~"
"H-Heels?" Makoto says with worry.
"Of course!  You really think your going to show up to rich kid's mixer in _loafers?_  And not get laughed out?"
Makoto grumbled in frustration: %yellow% "Oh shush, you knew this was coming when you got a serious date.  Your just lucky Ru-chan can actually catch you before you hit the ground if your a good 'girl' for her" %%
Yoru beams over Makoto as he sits slumped over the table, her smile a mix between motherly satisfaction and the look of a child with a new toy: "Come on Ko-chan!  We've got about 6 hours before we need to get a ride over to our destination".
Makoto grumbles a bit as Yoru holds his hand to make sure he follows, all but dragging him along on her shopping spree of doom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto blushes as he exits the park bathroom in the clothes Yoru brought for him to change into, Yoru herself following him out: 
->![Makoto's New Fit](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIG2.M96xrSUU.S.tmwK.TD67?pid=ImgGn)<-
 %yellow% "Great, we look like a caramel frappacino.  If Ru-chan keeps this up I'll have to make you have a word with her" %%
"Yo-Chaaaaan?  My chest feels-"
Yoru puts a finger to his lips: "Don't want to blow your cover already sweetie, I gave you little ones like me so you wouldn't feel too self concsous about them.  If you _really_ don't like them I'll remove them after tonight"
Makoto touches his chest and indeed feels some lumps of warm fat and the snickering of Yuki in his head:  %yellow% "Its a start, a bit too humble for my taste" %%

Yoru looks at her protege dressed like a gyaru out on errands and smiles: making his hair a bit longer really did make him look much cuter.  She let him keep his private bits for today at least.  She quickly takes 'boy's' hand as they walk to a second-hand formal wear boutique nestled inebtween some hobby shops, prom and bridesmaids dresses discarded after their initial use glittering on their curvy mannequins in the window.  Many of them left little to the imagination in all areas of the body.  
"Come on Ko-chan!  I need to know what color your wearing tonight" Yoru says as she is already looking through the racks of Makoto's rough size, looking for dresses which covered his broader shoulders so they could be minimized.  
"Uhm... black... yeah, black sounds good.." he says rubbing his eyes, only to woken up with a start by Yuki:  %yellow% "Black?  What are you, a 30 year old housewife?  Tell her to find you a cyan or something in a pastel!" %%

Yoru looks at Makoto negotiating with the voice in his head, with her own acting when she see's an open-sided purple dress with a tiny skirt: %purple% "Oh thats perfect for him, if he wears that fine little number he'll be tripping over gifts and dates or better yet, you could wear it and show how to _really_ work it"~ %%
Yoru bites her lip just thinking about showing herself in the dress, the stares she would get, the wandering eyes of the lust-stricken unable to keep themselves away from someone so liberated from the confines of the sterile world of suits and uniforms.  Just thinking about the sensation scratched the itch that She who Thirsts put in her head. 
She shakes her head when she heard Makoto saying her name: "Ru-chan?  Ru-chan?  You in there?"
"Yeah just _fantasizing_"
"..Kazama helped me pick dresses out, I assumed you like... cared to see them"
Yoru snatches up the revealing one for herself for later, prepared to make this work price-wise... somehow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto looks at himself in the mirror of the dressing room as Yoru zipped him into a tight pastel blue with sparkling sequins.  He looked a slightly curvy in the mirror, his body clear of any offending arm or leg hair as he heard Yuki chastising him for wincing about the tightness of the dress.  It was a short garment with a slit that showed off yet more of his leg and made walking easier.  Yoru seemed to aslo beef up his thighs a bit.
Yoru walks around behind him, inspecting him from differant angles.  She runs her hands over his new figure with a smile: "Most boys would _kill_ to have a pretty girl touch them _all over_ like this... but I notice your not too excited about all this"
"The dress feels scratchy Ru-chan, and I'm cooooold"
"Oh come on, you wear skirts shorter than this _all_ the time"
"Yeah but I usually wear long sleeves, Kazama says they hide like my.. shoulders?"
 %yellow% "To SLIM your shoulders: Tell her to slim those down so you can wear something strapless" %%

Makoto opens his mouth to speak, but Yoru shushes him: "I know Ki-chan is very smart, and very beautiful, but tell her Yoru-nee is handling things today~"
"And I don't want to hurt you pushing you into the deep end... just yet"
She sits him down and messes with his hair, smoothing it out with a brush: "But consider what the people who will be looking at you _desire_ out of a sugar baby... flashy, entertaining, bubbly, energetic"
"I can make you 3/4 if you just follow my advice, _sweetie_~"

Makoto runs his hands through his hair: "Soooooo... how do you plan on doing all that?"
"I'm glad you asked!  Your wearing that out so slip your shoes on.  "Flashy" means a nice pair of glittery heels!"
Makoto gulped as Yuki spoke to him:  %yellow% "Don't mess up my future body, okay?  I don't if Yoru has to princess carry you every where, your not breaking one of MY ankles cause your clumsy bitch" %%

Yoru pays for the two dresses: A sequened cyan dress on Makoto's body and a much more revealing purple dress which look more like a skirted negligee than a dress.  Both cost her dearly: 3000 Yen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto couldn't look at Yoru as she strutted about in the revealing dress: It hugged her as tightly as it could with a series of small cutouts on its side showing off her pale spotless skin with a low neckline giving anyone seeing her from the front a view of her modest bust and a miniskirt-length bottom  which made every move she made have more flash.  Its straps connected at her lower neck, leaving her dainty shoulders for the world to see.  
She made Makoto look modest about his own outfit and intentions with every progressing step.

Mothers out shopping gasped in shock and horror at seeing the pair, men couldn't tear their eyes away, students on their way back from buying lunch looked at them like magical beings.  Yoru looked on top of the world as she strode into a fancy shoes store, and the ensuing stares from the shoppers and attendents could have killed a lesser being, But Yoru's curse allowed her a seemingly infinite ability to resist shame.  

->![Pretty Torture Devices](https://di2ponv0v5otw.cloudfront.net/posts/2021/12/02/61a944c081a36cfd845968ec/m_wp_61a944e26f6c916b182672a5.webp)<-
Yoru giggled reassuringly as Makoto stumbled about in the obstructive shoes, his steps unsteady as Yoru put one had around his hips: "Walk with a sway, take shorter steps landing on your toes, and let your legs be seen~"
Makoto blushes as the other women shopping look at him and Yoru scornfully walking down the center isle of the store.  Every look reminded him of his mom and how much she would kill him if he broke these shoes and took home the bill for them.  Yoru led him like a dance partner: his steps were directed as Yuki bombards him with other tips on feminine social manuevers he would be using tonight or else.  

After a few laps down the center aisle, Yoru whispers in his ear with sickeningly sweet smile that dripped with honey: "Can my sweet yearling walk on her own now?"
"No-" he says before being pushed to walk on his own:  he stumbles for a few seconds, feeling like a fall is imminent.  He manage to stabalize himself against a wall and get his bearings: His loafers were across the store, just a minute of walking in these things and he could get out of here and find a coffee shop to loiter at.  
But he started to walk like a baby bird taking flight after being pushed out by their mother: one short, dainty step after another.  He looked back toward beamingly as he heard a satisfying click and clack with every step.  He settled into the shoes as Yoru walked beside him nodding at his pace: "Perfect, I knew you were ready for something _really alluring_"
Makoto smiles a bit, as Yuki actually congratulates him on something for once.  For a moment he doesn't feel like just slumping down on the floor and napping, even if he can see the feeling coming on the horizon 

"About paying for those..." Yoru says with a giggle.

The two would spend the rest of their afternoon in the backroom making up the 8000 yen they owed by modelling shoes, much to the glee of the photographer.  Makoto had never had his foot washed by another man, but he was ready to ask for double if he was going to be treated like an object,.  But that would be alot of work and yelling... so he just didn't.
As he watched Yoru make extravagent poses, he overheard that she owed at least 10000 more yen to this one store and had a tab on shoes.  He'll have to ask how she got that so his mom can get a new pair.

->![Party House](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cb/bf/d9/cbbfd9cc0de95a553f1f2abb39427014.jpg)
Yoru and Makoto rode the bus down to party they were meeting, taking place in a nice house in an expensive part of town.  Yoru walked alongside her dress-up doll for the day with a grin of pride seeing how pretty me came out, even if he wasn't perfect in a pair of heels yet.  He clearly wanted to complain as they waited around the entrance to the house with some other college and high school students for the house to be unlocked, many of the girls looking Yoru and Makoto with disgust:
"Who invited the mega-slut?"
"Their dresses are _so_ last season"
"Could they look anymore desperate?"

The boys however, especially those without a signifigent other for the night had much differant mutterings about the two as stole looks at them and tried to sneak photos of them:
"I gotta get some time with the blonde one"
"Holy shit, didn't know we hired actual hostesses"
"Think they do costumes?  I'd love to see'em in bunnyssuits..."

Yoru makes exagerated poses for them as she waits for her invtite in to arrive.
%purple% "Don't stop: They love you.  Your the belle of the ball, the taste maker for the prey of the evening.  Being shy about it would just be a waste of your power of attraction~" %%
"Ko-chan~, your just letting me take all your spot light?" 
 %yellow% "Yeah, don't just lean their and hold your clutch purse: the shrinking violet act isn't what your doing tonight" %% Yuki bellows in Makotos head as he sighs and sticks his leg out, the moonlight reflecting off of it and his shiny heels.  He stretches his arms and leans down, trying to stomach his fear as Yoru gives him her best attempt at a reassuring smile.

The two are quickly approached by some college boys who try insert themselves into the group, even causing one to leave the girl he came with just for a chance at Makoto.  

"Whats your name cutie?"
Makoto gives him puppy dog eyes, being well trained for this situation: "Makoto, oji-san, I _love_ guys who know how to treat me right~" he says in a higher pitch to sound convincingly feminine.  The crossdressed boy's confidence is shaken a bit when his prey wraps an arm around his waist, causing a momentary look toward Yoru, who is already giving a guy mouth-to-mouth.
 %yellow% "We practiced for this idiot, now perform or your eating Ramen for the next month!" %%
"So what you do for work?" Makoto asks, swallowing another fragment of pridewhile sugar baby mode fully engaged: Make the man of the night feel like he's all you care about and he'll give you all you can ask for.

20 minutes of tactical schmoozing and being groped by the a man named Sawatori later, the host of the mixer finally arrives: 
->![Cheerful Hostess](https://safebooru.org//samples/4217/sample_0628a13d363f19bf4bdc20a6d833913d500a483c.jpg?4404011)<-
"Hiya!~" she says in a cheerful tone, homing in on Yoru
"Wow!  you actually showed!  And your plus one is?"
"Makoto, call her Ko-chan though, she's very _freindly_, maybe you'll get to see that for yourself~"
"Ko-chan, this is Emi, or Mi-chan" Yoru says as the two shake hands.
"Nice to meet you" Makoto says, cocking his head afterward and closing his eyes to puncuate his smile as last minute commands from Yuki.
"You are a cutie... see me when Sawatori's yandere comes to collect him~" Emi says as she unlocks the front door and allows everyone inside.  Music turns on, drinks start flowing, and the real fun of the evening starts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Music: https://youtu.be/aS6rxmgtbt8?si=Y3eYtnDD-8jwfduq )
Makoto sips at the disgusting tasting beverage that his date sucks down: Sawatori is on his third bottle as the two of the them lean on a wall inside the living room, which has become the main gathering space for everyone despite its darkness.
Maybe because of its darkness as Makoto squints to see just how touching and feeling is going on amongst the participants.  Yoru stands at the center of this, dancing wildly with Emi while other cheer the couple on.  The music moves fast as the two move in a flurry, Emi taking the lead while Yoru follows along and improvises after her.  The purple-haired demon hunter moved with a perfect speed and grace that seemed unreal, as if Makoto was watching a anime characters dance rather than real people.

Every step Emi and Yoru made had an air of freedom with it, like they could fly if they so pleased.
All this made Makoto's head hurt while he was drawn close to Sawatori and layed his hands on him gently, glad his man for the night wasn't the dancing type.  He smelled bad but already seemed smitten with Makoto as he was... which could be a problem after Yoru takes his tits away, and would be kind of shitty to take his money with those features gone...

 %yellow% "Oh you feel bad for poor Sawatori?  Then just keep the tits and tell your school your a girl now and make my job easier when I take over" %%
Makoto bit his lip, just imagining the shitstorm at home if he came home with boobs... It'd be a huge pain in the ass to find another place to live while that ran its course.
He took a drink of water as Sawatori looked at him: "Ko-Chan, lets go for a dance while the floor's hot" he says hungrily, looking for an excuse to see Makoto's assets in motion.  All he can do is sigh and smile:
"No thanks..."
"Huh?"
"Yeah, I don't feel like dancing... its such a bother.." he says, slumping on a high table as his slothful nature takes full effect.  Yuki might be screaming at him, but his other passenger was louder this time.
Sawatori rolls his eyes and throws a 10000 yen bill on the ground near the improved dance floor and looks at Makoto expectently.  His eyes are drawn to the free money as he leans down to pick it up and shove it into his clutch purse for safety keeping.
The man sighs with dissapointment and throws some coins on the ground before leaving.  Makoto picks up the money on his hands and knees before going to back to a table to sleep.  The music was easy to block out at least and his feet hurt alot.... all this was way too much effort and he already made some money.
He watches Emi and Yoru go upstairs as he lays his head on a table to sleep.  Guess he should have brought a jacket or something to sleep in while she gave Emi a happy ending or whatever.....

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->![Emi's Pleasure Chamber](https://guidable.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Untitled-design-18.png)<-
Yoru eagerly followed her patron for the night up to her bedroom, her clothes practically itching itching against her skin as the voice in her head whispered every word of joy it could into her ear about the coming private time with the lady of the house.
As she lays on the round bed straight out of a love hotel, Emi's form shifts:
->![Kitsune](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120757721881391175/1203575788977389589/e64dd38b99a43ac23b1d1dd05044d75a.jpg?ex=65d1984d&is=65bf234d&hm=940f627db884aec5480ef0c94ab8183dcc483014e3d12b5b99e013e9b6804764&)<-
The fox-woman stares at Yoru smugly, her eyes gleaming and challenging the mega-sluts own eyes.  The war of suggestion is one Yoru can barely maintain as she feels the thoughts of the powerful demonic youkai bleed through any protective barriers her own voice put up:
 %Red% "You want to be dominated, you want a partner who understands _every facet of you_, and accepts it as part of their own collection" %%
 %Red% "Give yourself to me and I can show you true bliss... more than any brute or doll can, forget about your poor excuse for a protege, and all those below.  You are mine for tonight, and forever.." %%
 %Purple% "Yoru has _much, much_ higher standards for a dominant than someone like you.  She needs to be physically subdued, she needs a presence that does more than speak, but bleed power and status.  Your role in this relationship is to listen, not speak" %%
 %Red% "Don't listen to this foul presence Yoru.. I will cleanse it.. just come close and hug your new mistress" %%

Yoru's mind reels from the continued mindfucking as she braces herself against a wall and tries to sort through the mental noise and reach into her purse for her knife, a cursed box-cutter capable of weakening powerful spirits and forcing them to succumb to her sealing rituals.  She pushes forward with an odd chant to keep her movement seperated fromthe mental war going on in her head: 
"As I walk.."
Yoru pushes herself through a headache which seems like it will make her head explode.
"..Through the shadow.. of.. the valley of death..."
She grabs onto the frame of the bed to stabilize herself, strength rapidly failing as she musters up her thin muscles for one last labour.
"I shall fear... no... Evil"
She plunges the blade into shoulder of the fox-woman with what she has left, causing her to howl in pain and snarl at her.  She sends a wave illusions which probe her mind for weaknesses, traumas, and fears.  They come faster than Yoru can process: Mari refusing to hook up with her, Makoto dying, Amaryllis kicking her out, Hinako moving away, being forced into a hospital's mental ward, and a thousand-fold more images pour into the mind of Yoru Heinard.

But the sealing ritual must be completed, or she may end up the love-slave of an ancient harlot with mroe slut power than even herself.
Yoru bites down on her left thumb to get some blood of her own flowing, and covers as much as she can onto her right hand, pushing the Kitsune over onto the bed while hte knife was still embedded in her shoulder.  She draws a pentagram with her own blood, using the knife itself as the storage medium for the spirit.  The pain in her body was numbed by the over-work of her cranial pain receptors.  

The Kitsune is sucked forcefully into the box cutter, screeching and trying to boil Yoru's brain before she leaves. 
 %Red% "JOIN ME IN SAMSARA!" %%
 %Purple% "Know your _position_, _bitch_" %%

Yoru takes a moment to gather her wits, her sanity, and the condoms she dropped on the floor.  A wave of endorphins flood into her brain and make her feel worth a billion yen an hour.

Then she started falling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->![The True Venue](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/171255212/photo/burnt-house.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Of5iL_GKFPi2bSeZFF4LLB5LCGzbaIOOqrppsrPABsY=)<-
Makoto is awoken by someone falling on him.  Everything suddenly smells like ash and soot, and he felt really cold as if he wandered outside.  He finds himself on the ground with Yoru on top of him nursing a headache.  After blushing for moment he looks around to see everyone even Sawatori asleep in the very early morning in a burnt out house.  

"Ru-chaaaan?  What happened last night?
"It was all an illusion by some Kitsune demon, gave me a _real_ headache and not even the fun hangover kind" she responds as she dusts herself off and spins the cursed box cutter on a finger.  "She's nice and _caged_ in here now.  Sorry I got you involved in this Ko-chan..."
"My feet huuuuurt... and my head hurts.." 
"I need a massage too, did you make and money off that fine gentlemen who took an interest in you?"
Makoto nods hesitantly: "Breakfasts on me then, then we sumbit a report about all this, then we hit the spa.  That sound good Ko-chan?" she says
"Umm... my uhhh... chest.."
"Fiiiiiiine, if you really don't like them.. they make you _much_ cuter though sweetie" Yoru says with a knowing glare, the pastel dress going back to looking flat on Makoto's chest.  

If anything, Makoto made some money off of all.  Illusion or not, that 10000 Yen bill was reason enough to hang around Yoru more often.
