A Lynx Walks Into a Bar by anonymous

>goes to a gay bar where he could get the fabled Human Man
>doesn't get any
nooooo
Interesting, though.

Let me pick it up:
>One of the patrons, a Human, takes pity on the lone and dejected Anthro.
>Invites him to his booth for a few sandwiches and drinks, on his tab.
>Strikes up a conversation, finds out they have quite a few interests and hobbies in common.
>And the sandwiches are really damn good too.
>Things look up for the poor Anthro.
>The Human and the Anthro sit in a booth, talking and joking for hours.
>Anthro feels some real chemistry.
>They exchange phone numbers somewhere during that.
>Human agrees to join him on the walk back home.
>The weather is pleasant and the way rather peaceful.
>At the door to his apartment, the Anthro finally asks the million dollar question:
>"Want to come in for a light snack?"
>Human blinks, then answers.
>"Oh, sorry, man. I'm straight. I just go to that place for the sandwiches."
>Then wishes him a good night before heading off home, alone.
>Anthro dying inside. Found a Human Man he likes, still doesn't get any.
>Existence is Suffering.
>A few weeks passed.
>Anthro, a Lynx, has somewhat recovered from the disappointment of that one evening.
>Anon, the Human, and Lynx kept contact.
>Anon even went so far and apologized in case he unintentionally sent any mixed signals.
>Though that wasn't necessary, from Lynx' point of view, it was still nice.
>Overall, the two got on like a house on fire, and quickly became close friends, regardless of the awkward first meeting, so that chemistry Lynx felt wasn't entirely unfounded.
>They still met up at that gay bar once a week, because the sandwiches were genuinely amazing, talking about things.
>Even managed to hang out beyond that, like heading to the bookstore together to geek out over a new release of their favourite fantasy author.
>It was another one of their usual sandwich-and-drinks evenings, in their usual booth, at their usual places opposite one another.
>Well, Anon suggested they try something new for once.
>Shrimp sandwiches and that Vanilla-Banana drink the bartender liked to mix.
>They got served, and then Anon started.
>"Well, Lynx, how is the hunt for love treating you so far? Any successes?"
>Lynx buried his face in his hands sighing.
>"Nothing. Only duds. And I have no idea what I'm doing wrong!"
>Anon chuckled at that, patting his feline friend on the shoulder.
>"There, there, man. Just stay in the game. You are one hell of a catch, and those that can't see that are either blind, straight, or both."
>Now it was Lynx' turn to chuckle. Anon knew how to cheer him up.
>"And anyway, on my end it hasn't been much better either. I thought my neighbor was interested in me, but she only likes me as a friend."
>That, on the other hand, was a surprise. Anon was easy on the eyes himself, as well as funny and polite. He wouldn't struggle to find someone else.
>"But eh, it wasn't meant to be."
>Anon shrugged.
>"So, you thought about next week?"
>Lynx knew Anon was changing the topic, but he knew to what. The weekend they had planned.
>An entire weekend just filled with video games and a bunch of cheesy movies. He was already looking forward to it.
>"Of course!" Lynx piped up. "I got snacks, the extra cables, and I stocked up on booze!"
>Anon gave him a thumbs up. "Great! I've got the movies and grabbed the pizza stuff."
>He loved homemade pizza.
>The two spent the next few hours as usual, just chatting, drinking, and eating their sandwiches.
>Once more, Anon accompanied Lynx back home, until they were at the apartment door.
>Lynx, feeling cheeky that moment, asked the same question he did during their first meeting.
>As a joke, of course.
>"Want to come in for a light snack?"
>However, something was off.
>Anon didn't immediately respond.
>The Human sighed, staring at the ceiling.
>Was something wrong?
>"Know what? I'd like to come in."
>Wait, what?
>"Uh, Anon, are you serious? I thought you were straight!"
>The Human shrugged.
>"Maybe I'm not. Ever since things didn't work out with my neighbor, I've thought some things over..."
>Lynx raised an eyebrow, his brush-tipped ears standing completely straight. "And?"
>"Well, let's just say I think it's a night for experiments. And if you'd give me that chance...?"
>Lynx thought for a minute. Then two.
>Then, suddenly, he pulled Anon into a hug, eliciting a surprised yelp from the Human.
>Planting a kiss on his cheek, Lynx whispered into Anon's ear. "If you want me, then you got me."
>There was a risk, of course, a risk it would destroy their friendship, but Lynx didn't care.
>Then he pulled back, holding Anon's hand like an excited teen, bright grin on his muzzle.
>"So, Anon, do you want to come in for a light snack?"
>Anon shrugged, a little smile on his lips, his eyes focused on the Anthro's.
>"I don't see why not."
>And with that, the two entered the apartment, and interesting night ahead.
