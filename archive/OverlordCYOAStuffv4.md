### Original QnA
 
Q: Do I have to divide my Caster Proficiency?
A: Maybe, See examples:
    Arcane (INT) and Arcane (INT)                     - No
    Arcane (INT) and Arcane (CON)                     - No
    Arcane (INT) and Divine (CON)                     - Yes
    Arcane (INT) and Divine (INT)                     - Yes
    Arcane (INT), Divine (INT), Theurge               - No
    Arcane (INT), Divine (INT), Divine (CON), Theurge - Yes
 
Q: Can I pick <Overpowered Class>?
A: Yes, if you make it one of your Secret Advanced Classes
     You can get 2, and they are 5 Level each
       They grant TWO custom abilities or ONE custom and TWO pre-existing Class abilities
     Try to make it something possible in a game engine
 
Q: Can have World Item? Caloric Stone? What are they?
A: Try to win Gacha or pick one item for FREE. Their effects are defined in Cash Shop
 
Q: Can be little girl? Can be babby? Can be pretty?
A: Zuranon didn't say you couldn't. Prettiness is somewhat limited by race.
    For example, Nephilim can be aesthetically ugly or horrendously ugly.
 
Q: Attribute increases/decreases? Attribute doubling?
A: Attribute increases/decreases are +/-
   They still follow a cap of 40, so getting a +4 at 38 STR gives you 40 STR
   Nephilim +8 to two Attributes is an outright change
     Apply the change as Permanent and recalculate Skills
   "Considered 2x" is an effect that can scale an Attribute over 40
     This is applied after all other +/- Changes.
     Do not recalculate your Skills, Skill Cap, or any final calculations.
   Multiple "Considered 2x" go up by 1
     For example two/three/four "Strength is considered 2x higher" will get you 3x/4x/5x
   "Considered 2x" only affects the determined effects of Attributes mentioned in the beginning
     STR: Carry Weight Limit and ability to apply Grapple, Knock Out, and Stagger
	 CON: Vitality Regeneration and Resistance to DoT, etc.
 
Q: Character size?
A: The more "Strength is considered 2x higher", the bigger you should be
     If you don't want to, don't be. It's just expected.
 
Q: Why can I be big and lift anything, but deal no extra damage? Why can't I do thing that I should?
A: Video game logic. Everything goes out the window once you get isekai'd into the New World.
 
Q: What's the difference between Physical Resistance and Armor?
A: One gives flat(-) damage reduction, the other percentage(%) damage reduction.
 
Q: Where the metamagic at?
A: "Channel mana for additional effect" is your metamagic. All spellcasting in Yggdrasil are silent,
   player's only announce their spell out of courtesy for their teammates. 
     You can consider Immunity to Silence to be silent casting, if you want.
 
Q: How do you expect us to make ~50 Commands or ~300 Spells?
A: I don't. Those numbers indicate your builds versatility. You don't have to write every command/spell you can use.
 
Q: Why is Supernatural action speed doubling so OP?
A: It isn't. It affects start-up frames and recovery frames, but not active frames.
     If it affected active frames then you could do double damage from concentration spells.
     The same with Physical action speed and automatic firearms. You can aim faster, reload faster, but the bullets don't come out faster.
 
Q: Elemental Immunity? 100% Resistance?
A: Elemental Immunity is 100% Resistance and 100% Resistance is Immunity. Anything that lowers Resistance lowers even Immunity. Anything that pierces Immunity makes both Immunity and Resistance set to 0%.
