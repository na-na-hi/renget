“Mmm, you exhausted me today” Choco said in her signature flirtatious voice, leaning in towards me over the small café table. “You really know how to satisfy a woman.”
We’d stopped into the quiet street-side coffee shop after a voice recording session, which I’d helped her with. I was just doing my job, but Choco certainly had a way of making everything together seem intimate. I got a small espresso and meant for it to be a quick stop. A polite chat with a workmate after work. She had ordered a large caramel mocha something-or-other, topped with whipped cream, and a slice of chocolate gateau.  
Her thin pink blouse was buttoned down low, revealing ample cleavage pushed together by a beautiful, black lace bra. I was a faithfully married man, but no one in their right mind could ignore the sexuality this woman exuded.
“I’m glad we got everything done. We’ve all had too many late nights at work lately”, I stated simply. 
I felt her shiny black high-heeled shoes against one of my ankles. Using both feet, they worked up under my trouser leg and rubbed at my skin. Then a stockinged shin stroked its way up and down my calf in a slow, deliberate rhythm.  
“We could go for another late night, if you’d like? I have something in mind” she said. Her small obsidian horns glinted in the sun, reminding me what this woman was capable of. She gently ate up the last bit of her chocolate cake whilst staring at me. The tip of her tongue was sharp, almost to a point. I looked into her eyes, a whirl of blue and green, with a serious expression, momentarily feeling myself become slightly entranced by her, before remembering myself. I pulled away my leg, and my eyes, from her grasp.
“Choco, you know I am married, and you know to who.”
She giggled at this, she seemed to enjoy seeing me squirm.
“Ohh, I’m just playing.” She got up from her chair, “She’s a very lucky girl, that Polka~” she said sweetly, and left me with a mocking blown kiss. 
She’d also left me with the bill.

Polka already waited before me in the hallway when I got home. She wore a deep frown, and gripped a smartphone tightly in one hand. Her large bushy tail whipped from side to side, I could practically hear it beating the air.
She looked adorable when angry, but I knew I was in for it.    
“Just what do you think you are doing to me?” She shrieked, and stomped towards me.
“Polka, hey, I’m here n-” I started, and went to wrap one arm around her. She rolled her shoulder angrily and brushed me off.
“No. Your recordings ended at 3, it’s gone 5 now!”
“I texted you, we stopped off for a coffee.”
“You and *little Ms. Choco*.” She said her name in a bratty, mockingly sweet voice.
“Polka - don’t be like that. Isn’t she your friend, don’t you trust me?” I put both my hands on her shoulders firmly. She shrunk her frame inwards, letting me hold her like that, her voice went quiet and distant.
“But I know what she’s like… What she’s like with men. With everyone.” She fell into my chest, pushing me back against the inside of the front door, and I embraced her. She looked up with sad eyes, those amazing deep purple eyes that glistened with dots of yellow and white like a starry night sky. “You said you’d be here and you weren't. I wanted you. Don’t ever do that to me.”
“It was nothing, I promise.”
“Nothing?”
“Nothing” I repeated.
She let go of our hug and showed me the screen of her smartphone; a text from Choco.
“Great time with your man today~”, she read aloud, “heart emoji.” 
“Ohh come on, you said yourself, what she’s like. She’s a tease.”
She stood aside and pointed to the bedroom.
“Go.”

Polka was straddled a top of me, by now in nothing but a white bra. The straps fell off her shoulders, letting the weight of her breasts hang more freely. Her trademark tail ran down behind her, sweeping gently between my legs. The room was dark, our thick curtains pulled tightly, the bedside lamp faced away and towards the floor. The silhouette of her body, her milky pale skin, looked as if lit by soft moonlight, though it was still early evening outside. 
I ran my hands up her full, large thighs. She was a petite woman, but with curvaceous feminine weight in all the right places; her hips, her thighs, and her tits. I longed to be inside of her, but knew I would only be so on her terms. 
She grinded on me in slow circles, through my boxer shorts, working me to an erection. She took my wrists, pulling my hands from her, and pinned my arms above my head, pushing her face in close to mine. She breathed heavily into my face. 
“You won’t ever go on stupid ‘dates’ with another women” She said in an intense voice.
“I won’t.”
“You’ll always come to me. You’ll always be mine.”
“I will. I love you, Polka.”
A shock like a sudden bolt of lightning. The nerves in my face danced and tingled. She’d slapped me, hard. 
“Again.” 
“I love you, Omaru Polka. I love you” I repeated like a mantra. 
She kissed at my cheek where she’d struck me, down my jawline, and then nuzzled into my neck and shoulder, her large fennec ears brushed across my face. She bit down firmly into the top of my shoulder and began sucking, giving me a deep, intense lovebite. 
I let my hands down from above me, stroking her large ears, massaging them at the base. She groaned into me and couldn’t help but wiggle her hips about excitedly, she loved having her ears massaged. I combed fingers through her gorgeous, golden hair, then gripped tightly onto the braid that ran down one side, attempting to ease her off. But she didn’t. Not until she was satisfied she’d left a dark red, almost purple, mark upon my flesh, would she release her bite. 
She sat back up straight and adjusted herself, sitting her lips right over my cock. She was wet by now. She slid the fingers of one hand into mine, locking our hands together. The other picked up her panties from the bed.
“Do you think she’s pretty?”
It was a lose-lose situation. Of course Choco was attractive. Denying it would be a lie.
“We don’t need to talk about her. I only want you.” I tried to avoid answering.
“Is. She. Pretty?” Polka spat back, squeezing my hand. She wasn’t going to let me get away without playing her little game. She dangled her underwear playfully over my chest, sweeping them around in little figure of eight motions that tickled against my skin, and then around my face.  
“Yeah. She’s pretty.”
Polka smothered me with her panties, rubbing them stiffly into my face, covering me with the scent of her body. She pushed all of her weight down through her hips, arching her back, feeling my throbbing head at her entrance.
“But you would never”, she spoke right into my ear, “You would never touch another woman that isn’t me.”
“I don’t want anyone else but you” I said, my voice muffled through her panties.  
“You belong to me. You’ll always be mine. Say it.”
“I belong to you, Polka. Always.”
She released my hand, and tossed her underwear aside. She hurriedly began working down my boxers, and lapped at me with a wet tongue, licking at my face and chest all over. She was frenetic with excited lust, and I was ready for her. 
With an arm down between our bodies, she lightly took my member at the base and lifted it, stroking it against her clit and entrance, but she couldn’t wait for any more teasing. She sunk down onto me deeply, taking me all in one motion until I bottomed out inside of her. Then she repeated this several times, lifting up and pulling me all the way out, before sinking back down on me. My precum flowed ever more from this, and mixing with her wetness, we began to produce a soft squelching sound each time I buried into her. A bra strap had fallen down one arm completely, her breast flopping out over the fabric. I couldn’t help but eagerly sit up and take her in my mouth at the sight of this. She let me. I playfully bit at her soft skin, and sucked at her nipple, groaning into her flesh as we began making love. She removed the bra fully and tossed it aside, so I nurtured both her breasts with my mouth, deeply sucking at her nipples ‘till her breasts let out from my mouth with a soft ‘pop’. Her fluffy tail coiled around us and her thighs tightened. She bucked up in my lap and started to ride me, my face buried into the middle of her chest. She wasn’t the loudest during sex (“I’m not a screamer” she once told me back when we first became lovers), but her breath would shake during pleasure, as it began too now, she’d let out soft moans, and that excited me no end. 
I could have tossed her down, and fucked her ferociously into the mattress, such was my desire for her. However, I knew how much she enjoyed the feeling of being in control, and in turn how much I enjoyed letting her take it. So I leaned back and let myself lay down flat again. She followed me down, not letting go of our embrace yet, our chests pressed together. Her erect nipples teased over my body as her tits swung wildly underneath her. She began lapping at my ear, tonguing the entrance, and her breath shook. 
“Pl-ease”, she shuddered through moans, “Please always be with me. I love you. Please don’t ever leave me.”
“Polka, I would never. You are mine, I promise you.”  
Satisfied, she sat back up, raising her thighs and pushing her feet into the mattress. I gripped tightly onto the voluptuous weight of her thick thighs, squeezing my fingers deeply into her flesh. She let herself go and rode wildly now, and I couldn’t resist from fucking myself back up into her. The room filled with the sound of our flesh loudly slapping together, the bed and mattress shaking. Our bodies slammed ever harder together, both us filled with lust by that erotic sound. She shook and panted, grasping at me below her, grabbing my face, my hair. Raising her arms above her head, and fondling her tits. She was uncontrollable. I loved the sight of her letting go. 
Polka moaned loudly in ecstasy and collapsed back down onto me, her entire body shaking almost in a fit. 
“Fuck”, she panted, “I’m squirting.” She lifted her weight up from my cock, until I almost fell out from her, and she gushed, soaking me with her juices. She wiggled back down my length, taking me all the way inside again. That delicious squelching sound let out even louder. Again, she lifted, letting her wetness gush out. Again, she sunk down with loud wet squelching sounds. She could barely contain her growls, and wailed with the pleasure of her squirting orgasm. The mattress beneath us began to dampen. “Please, come with me. Give it to me. Come inside of me.”
The feeling of my wife in complete climax on top of me, shaking, panting, gushing all over me as she begged, was enough to send me over the edge. The walls of her cunt seemed to vibrate with her shaking, wet orgasm. I gripped her body tightly into me, caressing her back, breathing in the smell of her hair, and exploded inside of her.
We made out as our orgasms rolled. I moaned into her mouth with pleasure. Deep, sloppy kisses, both of us gasping for air, until eventually our breath settled. Polka pressed her nose into mine, staring into my eyes, and we laid still like that for a long time, wordlessly. Until my erection faded and I slipped out of her. Locks of her hair brushed gently over my face as she moved to give the lovebite on my shoulder a little peck, admiring the mark she had made, the mark that claimed me as hers for another night.
