#Dance-With-Rain Thoughts

######General Caligate
>"Tch, Lukiul. Sharp mind for battle but not Reel-Ka. Army slow, easy to catch. Fight to keep Empire corpse, futile battle."
Dance-With-Rain respects Caligate's natural affinity for battle, but his loyalty to the Empire is something that he sees as a weakness as it is something that has no permeance in this new era of the world, unlike the Hist. If he were independent, Dance-With-Rain would have been interested in an allegiance, but seeing as how he is beholden to old laws and expectations from his outsider upbringing, Dance-With-Rain has no choice but to see him as an obstacle. Despite this though, he would avoid conflict with the General if he can, as although it would be easy to break apart his Legionaires with his own skirmishers and assassins, it would waste time as he does not consider Caligate significant enough of a threat over the others at hand.

######Grenel the Fat
>"Greed, weakness bloat greel. Not stand and fight but lead other as though Kaal, too much time with bok not blade in hand."
Grenel's reliance on others for almost every aspect beyond him is bothersome to Dance-With-Rain and he feels almost personally offended that Grenel has such a large army despite lacking the ability to fight himself. Dance-With-Rain sees Grenel as the exact type of rot that Tamriel needs to be rid of to grow stronger. As his army is far above his own however, he will have to target the Lord's other strength, his supplies. Dismantling the lines that feed his troops will in turn dismantle his army, but is a task far easier said than done. The distance and effort it would take is something that prevents him from taking action so far as he has much more to be concerned about with his neighbors, so he cannot commit his Shadowscale force at the moment. Dragons may not be susceptible to starvation, but their loyalties can just as well be spent were there not anything to hold them to their masters.

######Endehm, Hero from the High Seas
>"Toteik Reel-Ka. Dance-With-Rain knows of ojel's people, fierce with blades. We meet in battle to find the better, or share battle as Saxhleel and beek-ojel."
He has heard of the legends of a sect of Redguard whose skill with a sword is unrivaled, the Swordsaints. Dance-With-Rain has unfortunately mistook Endehm to be one of them. Having never seen one in action however Endehm can still easily be passed off as one due to his mastery of swordfighting. That is until Dance-With-Rain sees Endehm's companion and understands what being a Swordsaint really means. Still, he would still have the Argonian's respect for having such powerful warriors under his command, and would be interested in a potential partnership as Dance-With-Rain sees much reflected of himself within Endehm as both are considered heroes and nearly divine in their own right, and take action without the influence of other mortals.

######Lilinah
>"Slaver of Saxhleel. Hist remembers old grudge. Word can never trust, only blade will speak in response."
Her lineage as a Dunmer marks her as a target for Dance-With-Rains attention. While the past may be the past, the actions still have their effects run deep in the memories of Argonians. Her attempt for the Empire may be beyond what he can achieve, but while she may worm her way in with her words and negotiation, he will chase her down with his steel and snuff out her supplies. He cannot fight her on her grounds, so he will have to make do with what he has to ensure that she cannot latch onto someone else for defense like the parasite they are.

######Isaelene Nesis V, Witch-Queen of Jackon
>"Vastei, the way of Hist. What end will ojel find?"
Dance-With-Rain is not sure what to make of this Breton. The extents of what she will do to pursue these advancements hasn't been fully revealed, and while the technology is something he has seen start to emerge with other Warlords, it is never something that he has seen done for its own sake rather than to create newer destructive arms for their forces. He is neither friendly nor hostile towards Isaelene, and a possible alliance could be created if their technology led to continued Argonian freedoms rather than being enslaved to provide for these new Earthbone creations.


######Ruga the Doom.
>"Decide if hand want peace or battle. A good battle earned by facing greel, not request. Meet Dance-With-Rain with blade on battle or alone, not matter."
He sees a powerful warrior with Ruga and his army, which is why it vexes him how he who avoids combat. Those to fight on their own terms through ambushes or other tactical methods are perfectly capable in Dance-With-Rain's eyes, but for someone who still wants to fight to ask to not fight is something that is unnecessary as most times conflict is inevitable, so choosing to avoid them purposely until the end is just delaying the inevitable. He does not care about upholding an alliance until a final duel, and would go to battle with Ruga at any point that it seemed that it was the best choice. If he did have the duel however, he would bring a small guard with him, as he does not expect Ruga to come alone. If he was sincere about a personal duel between them, then the guard will provide as witnesses for the result.

######Nishtar
>"Child of Reel-Ka, yet fights with word over blade. Hmmm."
Nishtar already intrigues him being a Redguard and with a capable army by her side, but it is the way she stays away from the blade during the day that makes her so interesting to Dance-With-Rain. While he would not know her real prowess with a sword nor the actions she undertakes to rise to the top, he has a hunch that she is much more then she lets on... mostly because he thinks that she's probably a Swordsaint like Endehm, as a suspicion completely unfounded on anything but race and rank.

######Octavian Caerulus, The Old.
>"Not long for world. Still fights for Throne. Strong heart, strong blood."
Dance-With-Rain doesn't consider Octavian as much of a threat but recognizes the strength he has to continuing fighting to lay down the frameworks of his plans so that others may continue them. His bloodline is in a unique position to take over or provide assistance to the old man as well, which gives ample strength of hard to break bonds and the possibility of carrying through their will through generations. Ultimately though, they will be just another small hurdle to get to the Throne, and despite the experience Octavian has, Dance-With-Rain will show him the might of the young blood and the pride of the Argonian race.

######Captain Commander Farvad Torn
>"Sits in shadows waiting for light of another. Symbol of weakness or strength?"
As someone who is not interested in taking the throne for himself, he does not get the attention of Dance-With-Rain. While he could easily be turned into a threat depending on who Torn decides to support, as long as he is still undecided, he is a non-threat in Dance-With-Rain's eyes. He knows that he will eventually have to face Torn's forces but for now as long as the Captain is preoccupied with trying to hold together the last remaining threads of the Empire's remaints, he will push ahead and overcome those armies all the same. An army under a leader without strong resolve will break upon Dance-With-Rain's scales and be cleaved in twain.

######Atrael Elsinore
>"Watcher of war, wielder of strong magicks, stands not on any side but own."
Atrael could be a strong ally if not for his purpose in guiding a successor for the sake of the Summerset Isles. Dance-With-Rain is wary of the Altmers as their vie for control over the region is something that could go terribly wrong for the rest of Tamriel. He could not trust them to keep to themselves and not expand to further regions. Unlike the others who do not have any current goals of the taking the throne for themselves, he views Atrael as a high threat as the Altmers always work for their own goals. Either way he leans or whatever person he allies with, will always be to expand control. His fearsome magical might and artifacts set him as a difficult target to deal with, and at best Dance-With-Rain can hope to assassinate the mage directly before their plans are set into motion.

######Ysmir The Giant
>"Reel-Ka born out of battle. Xul gives strength and rids of weak. Land need more of same ojel."
Ysmir is the embodiment of Dance-With-Rains idealogy, to build a stronger population through trial and triumph. It is likely that Ysmir will stand against Dance-With-Rain and that they will come to blows, but no matter the result of such a battle, his will shall carry on through the strength that those who've been forced to grow through war have. Dance-With-Rain would consider a battle like this a waste however, and in a rare occasion would opt to not strike down someone who could inspire strength from people and hasn't fully realized his potential.  An allegiance would be nearly impossible as they stand on two sides, one of Beast and one of Man, but maybe one day some shared goal could be realized.

######The Cobra King
>"Hewei Thuxis come from far land. Story of strength is known by Dance-With-Rain. We may meet, see if story true."
Dance-With-Rain does not fear the Cobra King, nor is intimidated by his forces. He is closely interested in seeing the actions of this snake to see what their true goals may be, as a possible allegiance may be in Dance-With-Rains interests. Although he does not care particularly for the what happens to the race of Man, he doesn't have any personal reasons to eradicate them or other similar acts. However he could be convinced to bring about the end of the age of Man to let the age of Beasts rise, as Argonian kind would be included in such a golden age. With their combined physical and magical might, there would be no one who could stop their march to the Empire to claim it for themselves.

######Goose Neck Silver
>"...he would take Khajiit uxith-beeko? Dance-With-Rain recoils head in disgust."
Dance-With-Rain has an intense dislike for Khajit, so the idea that someone would specifically seek out and give the entirety of their forces for the sake of laying one makes him question the sanity of such a person. He wouldn't see him as a threat but he would most definitely steer clear or try to exile him from the lands for being such a lunatic.

######Vivie Herrvan
>"She fights for Throne, for battle end. Pah, overcome weakness or fall."
Vivie's goal is one that Dance-With-Rain fundamentally disagrees with, as taking the Throne without ultimate strength will be a futile effort to prevent any other war or tragedy from falling upon the Empire's people. She has immense magical potential alongside her artifacts, but her attempts at peace will only be met with hardship and failure in his eyes. If she had set upon any other path, she may have a fair measure of success, but he cannot and will not entertain the idea that someone like her will be able to get far on her own.

######Al-Rahj
>"Tiny Khajiit, heavy jewels. Dance-With-Rain heard of Dragon under them. If so, know Dance-With-Rain stand to fight in battle, to take down Toteik lizard."
The Khajiit are fickle creatues, and it seems Al-Rahj is no exception. He seems to be an exemplary example of this actually, and as such Dance-With-Rain does not care for his presence in these lands. While Dance-With-Rain does not have an immediate need to dispose of them, he does realize the significance of the Khajiit's wealth in assisting any force that they may ally with, so will have to keep a close on their actions. If needed, an assassination could be in order. And if worst comes to worst, he will meet their army head on to take down that Dragon of theirs, as foolhardy as it may be. He already possesses the title of Daedra Slayer, adding Dragon Slayer to it seems to be the next natural step.

######An-Xleel
>"What?! Hist... no, pretender! Death to nalpa greel!
Dance-With-Rain utterly rejects this Hist impersonator. As one marked by the Hist, he has a strong connection to its call even at such a distance away from his home. For something to impersonate the connections of the Hist like this makes them an enemy to his eyes. He will push back other matters so that he may turn his full attention towards this entity, to either demand explanation or capture/kill for the real Hist. There will be no chance of allegiance.

######Magnum Septim II
>"Last blood of old Empire. Once blood spilled, Empire no more."
The man himself is less interesting then what he represents. He is the final chance that the Empire has to pretend that it isn't going away and the era will continue. His death will solidify the changing times, and therefore bring about a stronger foothold for Dance-With-Rain to use to wash away the remaints of the Empire and establish himself in these lands. The main issue is that the younng heir-to-be is surrounded by Imperial forces, so full war or even assassination attempts would be nearly impossible. There are many different hands at play here however, and he would not be surprised if someone from within would betray them to get a seat at the Throne. For now, he is a problem that will sort itself out, or simply an issue he will have to tackle later.

######Kasha Shadowtail
>"Lukikul of great danger... hmm. Perhaps Saxhleel beeko?"
Dance-With-Rain knows of the danger Kasha poses. Her army and ability to maneuver them alongside other Warlords is one of the most fearsome threats at play. While she isn't interested in the Throne itself, he knows that she will be one of if not the most significant obstacle he would have to facae to get it. If he were to ally with the Cobra King, he would most assuredly be met with Kasha's forces. As much as he would like the ability to call her an ally, sometimes fate does not have some choices in store, so he will have to watch his back as long as she is still in the game.

######Anumaril, Scourge of Men and Elves, the Fire King, the Eternal, the Ravager, the Light-Bringer, Lord of Annihilation, the Feathered
>"Ojel from sky and mountain... against man, Saxhleel, or mortals?"
Dance-With-Rain has never seen an Ayelid, but knows that they are considered a Beast in the eyes of others. If Anumaril does not intend to cause conflict with the Black Marsh and Hist, then similarly to his views on Cobra King, he may be interested in forming an allegiance. The forces of Man already fear the races of Beast for their power, and wouldn't hesitate to strike them down if they decided they were getting to close at having a chance at the Throne. Is it not fair to rend onto them what they would onto others? It may be difficult to establish such a tenuous allegiance between all three parties, but they may find common ground by breaking up the conquered lands. The Sea and Coast belonging to Cobra King, the Lands and Sky to Anumaril, and the Black Marsh belonging to the Hist and its people.
