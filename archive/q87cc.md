##### `Playful Pounce`
>Morning jogs are one of the best ways to stay in shape. Being up early and watching the sun rise, feeling the cool morning air in your hair, the serenity of running through the woods... it's one of the best ways to spend the mornings.
>It's all about location. Choosing paths that are practically untouched by others makes for a much more unique experience and an opportunity for exploring. For instance, you made a mental note of the abandoned mine shaft you passed half a mile back, even noting a seemingly undisturbed hot spring as well. That hot spring sounds like a fun way to spend this afternoon.
>You slowed down to pace yourself out so you'd have enough in the tank for the return trip, but as you slowed to recover and gather your thoughts, the loud snapping of a twig made you spin on a dime. Looking towards the source of the noise, you saw nothing was there.
>Paying no mind, you turned and continued down the path, taking heed to return to your previous pace. The rustling of bushes off to your right made the hairs on your neck stand at attention, although looking at the source, again, nothing was there.
>The uneasy realization that you were being followed, sent an icy chill down your spine. Whoever it was, was clearly toying with you, knowing that you knew they were there, yet not knowing how to respond other than trying to run faster.
>You broke out into a full blown sprint now, causing your stalker to increase their own efforts, with the resounding sound of sweeping brushes and broken branches growing louder.
>A loud roar rings out behind you. You barely get a chance to turn around before you are unceremoniously pounced to the ground by a fast and strong blur of fur.

>As the beast pinned you with their impressive strength, all you could hear was that low, sinister growl, and feel their claws paw over your figure. "Oh god, this is it!" you thought to yourself over your impending doom. Those thoughts of this being the end are immediately dashed when you hear the telltale snicker of Shyra.
>She could hardly contain her excitement as she proudly proclaimed: "I win... again!" You turned sideways to spot her beautiful gray furred face, her signature toothy smile, and her sparkling ocean blue eyes. You merely smiled back at her.
>"Yeah, you got me" you admitted, trying to ignore that you were being crushed.
>Nothing got Shyra more excited than "chasing her prey", as she calls it. That became apparanet after that fateful fullmoon, when you ran away in pure terror before she caught you and you both roughly mated under the sparkly nightsky. She was absolutely hooked on that chase play, getting you roped into it whether you were fully willing or not.
>"You are getting better awareness though. Keep it up and soon enough maybe you'll be doing the pouncing" she said.
>"Hm, maybe" you replied, as you tried to turn around from underneath her. Getting the hint, she lifts up just enough so you can roll on your back and stare upright at your wolfu beauty.
>"I take it you spotted the little hot spring while you were stalking me."
>"Hmph, I wasn't stalking you. I was just making sure my mate was safe on his morning run" said Shyra, trying to feign innocence.
>You merely roll your eyes at that: "And the intentionally snapping twigs and rustling bushes were a part of your plan?"
>"Heh, I was just having some fun. You know how I get when something I want tries to run from me. What better way to get you that extra mile than having you on edge" she replied with a smile.

>While you are relieved it was just Shyra up to her normal, playful antics, there was a moment there where you thought you really were in danger.
>You elect to give her "the face" to show you weren't overly amused this time around. Her playful grin drops to a concerned look.
>"Ah, stop with the face. You know I would never let anything bad happen to my dear mate" she says as she caresses the side of your face with her clawed finger. "Tell you what, to repay you for being so willing, we'll let you hold the reigns tonight, deal?"
>You ponder that offer for a moment. Being the dom tonight, pushing all of Shyra's buttons that makes her gush and turn to puddy in your hands. Just imagine how much you can tease her, how much she could try to resist the urge to break free and be bred properly. Yeah, that sounds like a good repayment.
>"Fair enough" you say as you begin to push up from the ground. She scoots back to crouching just over your legs, allowing you both to be face to face. Shyra pulls you into a gentle hug, taking care to caress your head and rub your back, while you rested your head in the nape of her neck, letting her fur and hair tickle your nose and cheeks. When you pull back, you lean up a bit to give her a quick peck on the snoot.
>You both rise from the ground and gaze at the rising sun. "Looks like it's getting late. Time to head back home."
>"And we'll go to the hot spring later today?" Shyra asked hopefully, with a wag of her tail in anticipation of your decision.
>"Of course, sweetheart, of course. But you still owe me tonight, right?"
>"Absolutely" she said without a 2nd thought.
>You both hold hands, or hand holding her paw rather, and walk the direction back towards your home. Sometimes it's hard to deal with Shyra and her "eagerness", but when you see that endearing personality and warm smile that you fell in love with, you wouldn't have it any other way.
