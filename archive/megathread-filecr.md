# FileCR

FileCR was [mentioned in a post by FHMY](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/comments/15qfjh8/we_removed_filecr_as_we_found_malware/) as potentially problematic, although it was not directly responsible for the malware. Interestingly, these same releases with identical hashes can be found on several other public websites, including [SoftArchive](https://softarchive.is) and various others. It appears that the dissemination of these releases originated from [SoftArchive](https://softarchive.is), at least from a public standpoint.

It is worth noting that a significant number of compromised releases on [SoftArchive](https://softarchive.is) were attributed to a [specific uploader](https://softarchive.is/blogs/turr21/), while a few others came from [somebody else](https://softarchive.is/blogs/tolyan76/). At present, it remains unclear whether these two uploaders are obtaining the files from external sources or if they themselves are the original source. It is important to highlight that not all releases from these uploaders contain malware. However, any website, tracker, or platform that has obtained releases from these sources may unknowingly contribute to the spread of the malware.

To ensure the safety of your systems, it is essential to exercise due diligence. Conduct comprehensive scans using tools like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and [Hybrid Analysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/), and carefully weigh the potential risks associated with the use of cracked software against the benefits of accessing the full version.
