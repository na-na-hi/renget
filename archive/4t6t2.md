>It's time for a school-wide athletics festival
>Everyone's admired my athletic skills
>That nice American boy is participating too
>He's doing really well
>...Wow, he's stronger than he looks
>And he looked pretty damn strong to begin with
>No wonder everyone wants him on their team
>He's practically a gamebreaker
>Okay, enough ogling
>Time to refocus
>My team is counting on me
>We're doing long jumps
>I sail through the air
>I go pretty far
>But something's wrong when I land
>My ankle hurts
>I crumple to the ground and cry out in pain
>The American boy is between events
>Hears me and comes running over
>"Are you okay?"
>"I think I'm fine"
>I try to stand up
>Ankle flares up
>"You don't look fine to me."
>"It's probably just a bruise. I can walk it off."
>Try to take a step
>Fall again
>"I don't think you can. Let me take you to the nurse's office. I can help you keep weight off that foot"
>"...Alright", I say reluctantly
>I expect him to help me stand up and let me lean on him
>Instead, he grabs me by the back and legs and picks me up
>And starts carrying me
>...I'm probably bright red
>Kami, he's not burdened by me at all
>He secures his grip on me and starts briskly walking
>...You know, I could get used to him carrying me like this
>It makes me feel delicate and girlish
>Any boy who can and will do this for me is definitely worth pursuing
>Strong AND caring
>He makes me feel safe and protected
>I want to keep feeling like this
>Nurse says it's nothing serious
>I just need some ice and I should be good to go
>"You want me to stay here until the nurse clears you to go?"
>"...I think I'd like that, actually."
>He smiles
>I want to bask in that smile forever
