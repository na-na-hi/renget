##Is IL Dan going to be good? Should I save for him? What gear does he want?
He's looking like an extremely good and very strong IMG damage dealer and is the sole real damage dealer for IMG given that Welt is a debuffer, Luocha is a healer and Yukong is a buffer. Most people are pre-farming the IMG set for him as a safe bet but you can wait and see what calculations and conclusions people arrive once he's actually out.

##Is Fu Xuan going to be good? Can she solo sustain?
As of right now, beta people seem to assure that yes, she can solo sustain a team. Fu Xuan will take 70% of the damage recieved by your party members while so if a boss hits your Seele then she would take 30% damage while Fu Xuan will take 70% of that damage. Damage reduction and def is calculated using Fu Xuan's stats so that damage can be reduced quite a bit.
She can protect your party from hits, she will reduce damage taken by your party by 18% just by being on it and she will also apply a 6% max HP buff and 12% crit rate to all party members while her shield is up. On top of that, her shield will protect party members from crowd control effects but is limited to once per skill cast. Her signature ability is that she will restore 90% of her missing HP when she falls under 50% as long as she has avaliable HP restore counters to use. Fu Xuan will start the battle with 1 by default and you can gain more HP restore counts by using her ultimate skill, storing up to 2 maximum.
In addition to all that, she should have another Healer (Lynx) in her banner so this should be all-around a really great banner to roll on if you want more survivability in either of your memory of chaos teams or just make more teams more durable.

##Is Lynx going to be any good?
Lynx should have similar healing potential to Natasha if not slightly higher but she can also clear one debuff from the entire party at the same time, can buff max HP and can also increase aggro of a party member if they are Destruction/Preservation character so she should be an all-around nice character to have given that she will be a 4-star character and a healer when most of the playerbase are lacking good healers or good sustain.

##Can Clara function as a solo carry? Is she good?
Depends what enemy you're fighting but yes she can. Clara's entire playstyle depends on countering the enemy actions so she will naturally be better against aggressive enemies that can deal damage to her often and/or phys weak enemies. Also because of this, she is naturally a bad choice against enemies that are slow or do not attack often because she can't deal damage if the enemies don't hit her so make sure to use the right character for the job. Her nature as a pseudo-tank means that she will be constantly attracting all the hits for herself and will make your teams safer by making the enemies attack her and not your other team members so make sure to place her at the edges of the team when organizing your party members (Far left or far right) and nowhere near characters that do not want to get hit.

You want to run her with a 4pc Longevous Disciple set or the Streetboxing set. The Streetboxing set might be slightly better in terms of damage but the Longevous set is a lot more resin efficient and the free crit chance it offers will allow you to go for a crit dmg chest a lot more easily without having to desperately hunt for crit chance in your pieces. Her accessory set of choice is a Phys damage orb and an Atk% rope. Some people prefer using an ER% rope for slightly better up time but these people are a minority because trading 40%+ Attack for 20% ER is simply not worth it when she will be getting hit a lot throughout the entire battle.

Good LCs on her are her signature LC as the best and on the fall of an aeon at S5 with other 4* options being inferior. Blade and IL Dan LCs are great on her too if for some strange reason you happen to have those LCs and aren't using them on Blade/Dan.

##Do we know what the next banners are? Is there any way to know?

As of Kafka banner, this is the currently speculated banner order

1. [Imbibitor Lunae](https://hsr.yatta.top/en/archive/avatar/1213/dan-heng-imbibitor-lunae?mode=details)
2. [Fu Xuan](https://hsr.yatta.top/en/archive/avatar/1208/fu-xuan?mode=details)
3. Jingliu
4. Topaz
5. Huohuo
6. Argenti

Banner order up to Topaz has been confirmed via reliable/official sources but this is still **Subject to change**
If there no reruns or changes made to the banner order, Huohuo should be next then Argenti.
Lynx is a 4-star and will be included in Fu Xuan's banner.

##Is there a good tierlist anywhere if I want to see how characters compare to each other?
There's a decent one here but please remember tierlists are stupid and do not tell the entire story. Characters do not exist alone in a vacuum and their performance greatly depends on what content they're being used, against what enemy and what characters you're taking with them. It's best to ask for teambuilding help or what is best for your own particular account rather than take tierlists as facts.
