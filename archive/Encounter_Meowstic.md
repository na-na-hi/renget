Encounter 
When I came to this world, I found myself on a cold, stony ruins. Although I'm feeling a bit light-headed, I stood up and looked around. 

"What is... this place?" I mumbled, "...Did I seriously got drunk and ended up in a cave?"

"..." I shook my head, "Nah... that couldn't be possi-" 

As I finish that sentiment, I took a look at my hands. I nervously took a deep breath.

"It's all fine... you're just losing it!"

But curiosity struck me when I noticed there's a pool of water right next to me. I took a glance on the reflection. 

"Fluffy ears and... a tail... it's a Meowstic."

I gasped in fear and took a good look at myself, it all looked so strange to me, yet it feels so natural, like it always has been like that. 

Looking at my tail gave me an idea and started to wiggle it, 'wiggle', 'wiggle', it swings back and forth. It's amusing to look at, "Haha, that's so adorable!"

"...Now I must have gone insane." 

I wanted to say this is all but a dream though it felt so real. Have I been kidnapped and they tossed me into this cave? All I know that I'm a human... was a Human. The odd part is that I don't have any recollections the moment I became a Pokémon, it's like this all happened so suddenly. Thinking about it all day would lead to nowhere so I decided to find a way out from this place. 

"...A staircase?" 

After walking through the hallway, I found this stairway at the end. I looked elsewhere on this supposing floor and it seems this is the only way to go onwards. 

"Looks a bit out of place... like a sore thumb. Hm, Whatever."

Once I took my last steps to the new floor, the staircase behind me just vanishes.

"What the- Agh! This is really bizarre... this has to be a dream."

After wandering around this floor, I found a staircase right across this big room, I was about to go to the stairs but suddenly, I felt rocks trembling beneath my feet. It's growing stronger like it's approaching me. It shook me up and I slowly turn my back.

"...It's a Pinsir! But if I really became a Pokémon... do I have to fight it?"

I made a run for it but was stopped by its quick attack.

"No!" I wailed as it knock me onto the floor. 

I stood back up, "I got no choice. I had to fight them."

I put both of my arms at the air, "Ps- Psybeam...?" 

Clearly clueless how this would work but then, a beam of light came from me and strikes down the Pinsir. 

"Woah! No. I had to go before there's more of them!"

An item was dropped from Pinsir and it's a Silver Spike. I quickly grabbed it and run towards the stairs.

"Shadow Ball!" I yelled as I fight against a Mismagius.

"An Ivysaur... I believe I have an advantage here because I'm a Psychic type."

I wanted to try something ever since I managed to pull of Psybeam. Ivysaur seems to be confused when I did a finger gun gesture, "...Bang!"

And Psybeam seems to work this way too, who knew! 

...No. Ivysaur just fainted. Don't worry about it!

"Brrr," I shivered from the cold breeze, "All of this makes no sense..."

"How long does this have to go on for?"

A mysterious voice answers, "Not much longer. You're almost at the finish line!" 

This response made me alerted.

"Just relax. There's no need to be hostile."

A portal appears right before me and a Hoopa emerges from that portal, "Ta-da!"

Few seconds of silence ensues...

"D-did I do it wrong? I thought I made my cool grand entrance." Hoopa frantically speaks out, "Ehh! Don't look at me like that!"

"*Ahem* Anyways, you did well for a Meowstic. Though your circumstances is a bit of a pickle..."

"How so?"

"Well you see, Humans that turned into Pokémon don't appear inside a mystery dungeon."

"A mystery dungeon?"

"Look, I don't have time to explain all of that. I'm a busy guy, y'know?"

"Rude."

"Hey now. Don't be like that! Wait actually, that's fair because... ugh! I'm not so good at this!"

"I always thought Hoopas are such mischievous gremlins..."

"Shut up! There's a job to do and I had to get rid of you, stat."

"No thank you, I'm leaving this place in one piece please."

Hoopa holds one of his gold rings in front of me, "Now, Hyperspace Hole!"

But nothing happened.

"Huh? Hyperspace Hole! Psychic! Dark Pulse!" 

At the midst of the confusion, "This can't be right! What dungeon is th-"

I sneaked behind Hoopa, "Shadow Ball!"

"Geh! You're cheeky... Argh! This is one of those special dungeons. Fine! Shadow Ball!"

"Hyah!" I narrowly avoided the attack.

"*Sigh* You're making hard, y'know."

"Then spill the beans on what is going on?"

"If you defeat me... hmm. I'll let you leave this dungeon and umm, leave you alone."

I gave thought on Hoopa's offer but it doesn't make any sense to me, "(Why the sudden change of mind... this has to have a catch.)"

"I'll accept the offer because I'll be defeating you either way~."

"Argh! You're so vexatious! Let's get this over with!"

Hoopa sets up a shield in front of him, "(I believe that's a Light Screen. This might not be the right time to use Shadow Ball.)"

"Hah!" I backed off from Hoopa and began circling around him, waiting for an opening. 

"Slow down Meowstic! You're going too fast!"

The moment Hoopa's starting to get dizzy, I used Scratch at him and jump back after one strike and I continue to repeat the attack as I keep circling around him. 

"ENOUGH!" Hoopa's getting pissed, "Take this!"

Hoopa used Facade at me.

"No!" The attack was so strong, I hurled to a wall!

"*Pant* *pant*" I'm starting to lose consciousness. "(What to do, this is bad. I need to think... Ah!)"

Hoopa approaches me, "It seems I still have some of my strength despite the dungeon's effects."

"It's not personal Meowstic, there were some issues with-" Hoopa stops for a moment, "He figured out how to open his eye-ears! (I had to flee from him!)"

"Take this!" I throw a Silver Spike into Hoopa. His Light Screen appears before him and it puts a stop on the Silver Spike but it caused a crack on the Light Screen.

"Hah! Psybeam!!" Psybeam aided the Silver Spike and penetrate through the Light Screen, shattering it into pieces and hitting Hoopa's arm.

"Hah!?"

"Shadow Ball!" I followed up with another attack while Hoopa is still in shock. 

"Now that's just unfairrrrr!!!!!" Hoopa yells. 

"I-I did it!" I felt so relieved that I couldn't help but to wag my tail around. 

"*Pant* Fine *pant* you win. I'll let you go..." Hoopa holds his left arm in distress, "I'll tell you one thing. You're not the only *pant* human that turned into a Pokémon; there are many others."

"Keep them safe from people *pant* like me! Now go enter this portal... ah!"

Hoopa drops his gold ring to the floor and I picked it up, "I'll be taking this as a souvenir~ (This might be useful for teleport I believe.)" 

Before Hoopa can say anything, I hastily walk towards the portal.

"Hey wait! Argh! I hate that guy *pant* Ugh!! But maybe..."
