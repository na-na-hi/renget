*The recording starts within an empty room. In the back is a beige wall, filled with craters and cracks throughout it, lighter stretches of paint and plaster singling out where repairs have taken place. It is obvious this room has not been well maintained. As the camera settles into place, loud stepping knocks against the wooden boards as a young man walks into the scene, his uniform disheveled and malkept and his hair like a spiky mane upon his head. It is **Ikari Michita**, and he is not doing this out of his free will. Stopping befoore the table, he slams his fists upon it's wooden surface.*

***"Aaalright..."*** *he exclaims, visibly seething with every breath.*

 **"Now, after those bastards sent me to 'Anger Management' after breaking the arm of some lowlife who stole my place in the cafeteria, they have the FUCKIN' GALL to tell me I need to make a video detailin' all the stuff that's been making me angry?! What kind of garbage jackshit practice is that? Thinkin' about it is just gonna make me angrier! Idiots!"** *Ikari exclaims, hitting the table yet again. After a moment of silence, he takes a deep breath, before sitting on the chair beneath him. Slowly, his face breaks into an unnerving grin.*

"Fine, then. I'll say what's **really** been angering me..."

#Ikari Michita's List of Reasons Why He Really, Really Hates You

!!! Mari Aozaki,   "Legion"
**"This woman, huh? She thinks i can't see through her shitty mask, actin' like she's shy...I see through your goddamn veil, bitch! You think you're too good to talk to people just because you've been doing shit for slightly longer? Sending your shadows like you're goddamn Royalty? %red%I ain't takin it! You bastard! You're just as shit as any of us!%%**" *he exclaims, almost breaking the table as he slams his hand on it yet again.*

!!! Eiyu Isamu
"**I hate low-lifes like this most of all! Bastards who think they know everything when they don't know shit! This idiot's cursed, clear as day, but he thinks we're goddamn retards! %red%LET'S SEE WHAT'S MAKE-BELIEVE  WHEN I FEED YOU TO A DEMON, YOU FUCKIN' PIECE OF TRASH!%%"**

!!! Emilia Shadowsong, "Battousai"
"**A goddamn fucking otaku! Is this girl unable to see that i'm not interested in her schoolgirl bit??? Leave me to myself, you bitch! And you're telling me Shadowsong is your real name?! I call bullshit!"**

!!! Akari Ichioka, "Crimson Vermilion of the Night"
"**I've been to her cafe before, and i %red%FUCKIN' HATED IT!%%** *he yells yet again, cracks appearing in the wood as he grips the table with unearthly strength.* **"Dressing like you're in one of those western movies...speaking like you're a fucking noblewoman!* Who the hell likes that? Nobody wants to* suffer dealing with that! You bitch! You say you're a vampire? I'll shove a stake into your heart through your ass!** 

!!! Lem Amano, "Amano Lemon"
**"I REMEMBER HIM! I Remember this bastard. Probably thinks I don't, but i don't forget when someone insults me like that! This bastard had the guts to take the last TWO Sour Citrus Mochi in the cafeteria just as i was about to order one! I BUY ONE EVERY DAY! HE SHOULD DAMN WELL KNOW THAT'S MY FAVORITE! HE ALREADY HAD ONE FOR HIMSELF! %red%YOU SELFISH PRICK!%%"**

!!! Hinaki Shimeki, "The Dollmaker"
*As the next recording begins, the wall behind Ikari seems to have gained a new crater. The Mad Screamer himself continues in the chair, visibly seething - though less so than he was in the previous recording.*

**"A lowlife creep! That's who this woman is, with all her damn dolls. And worst of all, she tries to use her powers on other hunters! Just how unbearable can you be! %red%If that bitch tries to force me to act friendly with her even once, i'm breaking her damn face in half and turning her stupid dolls into dust!%%"**

!!! Yoru Heinard, "She Who Thirsts"
*Upon mentioning this name, Ikari Michita seems to wince as his face contorts in disgust.*

**"Blech! This creature ain't even worth calling human. I've seen how this whore looks at everyone! Just being in the same country as this bitch makes me want to roundhouse kick it at full strength! And the worst part is the *blatant flirting...* You want someone to fuck you,  huh? Well i'll fuck you alright. %red%I'LL SKULLFUCK YOU WITH MY FUCKING FISTS UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT BUT A SMEAR ON THE GROUND YOU STUPID FUCKING WHO%%**

!!! Amane Shiozaki, "Amaryllis"
*The wall seems to have suffered even more. It is a miracle that it has not yet collapsed.*

***"The Librarian, huuuh?*** **I remember the first time i tried checking out that damn library. The moment i came in, she greeted me with that chickenshit fancy speech! Damn bitch! She's lucky that library's the only place with demon books where i can find some goddamn silence when i'm trying to read! Everywhere else it's those other fuckin' hunters annoying me...She's learned her lesson to not talk down to me. Let's see if she can keep it.** *he finishes, clenching his fist.*

!!! Makoto Nagai / Yuki Kazama

**"Another *whhhhhhhore...* and this time, it's a man trying to be one! Just knowing this pervert's existence makes me want to vomit... I'd say i want to stomp on it until it's nothing but a stain, but i have no intention of touching him with my hands! %red% *Though i wouldn't object to doing it with a particularly large chunk of concrete...*%%**

!!! Yoji Ryoshi
**"The priest - he doesn't seem to understand who i am, huh? I'm already hunting demons. If i get sent to hell, then it's all the damn same - %red%i'll purge that entire shitty realm with my own bare hands!"%%**

!!! Mithran Kuro, "Undefeated Knight"

**"What a fuckin' disappointment of a person...when i saw this bitch fighting, i thought i found someone who knew how to let loose too! But outside of fights, all she does is act like she's the center of the universe. You bastard, stop acting like you're a goddamn Shonen Jump Heroine! You're nothing but trash! LIVING TRASH! TRASH! TRASH! You think you can impress me with that protagonist routine!? HOW GULLIBLE DO YOU THINK I AM!?!?!?!"**  *he steps aggressively, grabbing his chair with superhuman strength as he hurls it across the room, screaming all the while.*

**%red%"YOU'RE TRAAAAAAAAASH!"%%**

!!! Haruhi Oohara, "Rasalhague"
**"Garbage who hides itself is just well-hidden garbage! This bitch tries to act friendly, but i ain't falling for it! I've seen her looks of disgust when i refuse her shitty help. I'm certain she'd have attacked me if she didn't know i'd slap her into a coma if she did."** *he exclaims as he stands in the now chair-less table, smirking unhingedly.*

!!! Yuki Tanaka, "Abyssal Sovereign"
**"Hmph. The last one in the list, huh? I barely know that bastard...nothing short of a loser. He doesn't seem like the type who can handle this manner of world. Powerful or not...he doesn't have the spirit!"**

*Having at last finished, Ikari stops for a moment, catching his breath as he pants from his parade of scream. It seems his berseker rage has been temporarily sated...though just barely. He smirks, less enraged but no less unnerving*

"I guess this 'Anger Management' thing works after all."
