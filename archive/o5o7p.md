the skyscraper's route to the penthouse floor was some 50 stories up - and the elevator journey from the top tower was long enough to make your eardrums pop from the air pressure and then deafen from the seemingly soundproofed interior in each elevator car. you had figured it was part of the megacorp's demands - no idea who may want to eavesdrop on the conversations that happened on the way to those cutthroat "mergers and acquisitions" meetings. 

the conversations that happened on the ride /from/ those negotiations tended to be much more casual - at least when it was you and your fellow coworker, Shen. 

It wasn't uncommon to see people call businessmen "wolves of wall street", but Shen was a dragon - literally. You and him had a pretty good rapport in the office and an even better record in those meeting rooms. Your company had paired you up at first on a hunch, but figured out pretty quickly that your teamwork was unprecedented and your results spoke for themselves. It's not like you were doing anything particularly genius, either - most "negotiation sessions" went like this: 

Shen usually went in first and handled the presentation. If you think most businessmen are frightening - try one standing 6'7 head-to-tail, as wide as a fridge, and sporting a grin full of teeth razor-sharp enough to tear flesh from bone as if it were paper. He rarely ever needed to raise his voice or get aggressive with a client because his looks usually did the job, but nonetheless after dealing with the scaled exec, you usually came in as the closer, sealing the deal and locking up whatever ironclad contract before the guy on the other end realizes they've basically been intimidated into selling half their company (on a good day) or worse. This was a good day, and you were sharing the long elevator ride back down to the office with your compatriot. 

"Starting to feel like these sessions are getting too easy," he grunts as he squeezes himself into the elevator. "Why do you think that is?"

"i don't want to sum it up as a 'good cop, bad cop', act," you tell him, "but i have a feeling that for the average boardroom exec - dealing with me after dealing with you is like a lifeboat in a storm. i can convince them to agree to pretty much anything after you've scared them shitless."

"So they're terrified of having to negotiate with the scary coldblooded dragon - and you swoop in to save the day and rob them blind in the process."

"You make it sound so cynical."

Shen's face contorts into a faux-offended mask as he dramatically claps a ruby-red clawed hand over his chest, swooning. "Well, i'm hurt! i'm not so frightening once you get to know me, right?"

"*I* know you're secretly nice under the 'Glengarry Glen Ross' act, dude." You smile, jokingly elbowing the reptile in the side. "The trick is, they don't. And it works every time, because we have excellent chemistry as partners."

Shen doesn't break from his joking-offended pose, but his gold-flecked eyes shift to you for just a second, and you see something flash in them that you don't think you've ever noticed before. "As partners? Is that so?"

You quickly (maybe a bit too quickly) add "Business partners."

"Of course." 

Shen readjusts his tie, fiddles with his suit. You pass another floor, elevator now silent except for the ding of each floor being reached.

"I mean, I enjoy your company as well," you add. 

The dragon looks at you. For a second, you can't make out his expression - the sort of poker face he's usually laying on clients, not coworkers - and then the corners of his muzzle curl upwards, his species' attempt at a smirk. "Is that so?"  

This is awkward. You look down for a second.  If this is how the execs feel when Shen is working his magic - fuck, he's good.

"I lie to our clients, but i wouldn't lie to you." You shrug.

Still staring at you, Shen asks: "Tell me the truth, then. do you like me?"

Your face flushes. You look back at the elevator door (of course the door is mirrored, showing your own flustered visage back at you), praying for someone else to enter the car and finally end this conversation. "I like working with you."

Shen steps closer to you in the elevator. 

"Do you like *me*, Mr. ___?"

He's close enough that you can smell the cologne on his shirt and scales, mixing with his natural scent. It’s a lot. It’s intoxicating. Up close you can see the slight beginning of a tuft of fur (feathers? You never asked what type of dragon he was, HR said that was prying too much) underneath the collar of his buttoned shirt, the well-sculpted jaw and neckline, the snugness of the crotch area in his tailored pants— 

**DING! **

Finally. Salvation. You let out a sigh of relief as the elevator door begins to swing open as you pull up to the nearest floor. On the other end, another human worker — one of the interns, you vaguely remember — holds a stack of paper, face obscured.

“Going up?”

“Going down, actually,” Shen says. 

The elevator door closes again. You and Shen remain the only two in the car.

Fuck.

“You didn’t strike me as the workplace harassment type,” you half-joke, half-mumble, avoiding his gaze.

“I hope I’m not harassing you, Mr. ___ .” Shen says. “I was just curious, is all. I’ve always seen how you look at me in the office. In the boardroom. Even in the bathroom. I had my suspicions, but I wanted to see for myself as to what was going on.” 

“And what exactly do you think is going on?” You ask.

“You have a thing for me. You’re a human, and humans in negotiation always have really obvious tells. Once you notice them, it’s fairly easy to act on them.” 

You tell him, “Is that so? What is it you’re about to act on?”

Shen pulls his face close to yours and his tongue is down your mouth quicker than you can even react. It’s warmer and softer than you expect, and you gasp for air as you realize the length of it is already down your throat. Your knees buckle for a second, leaning against his body — it’s both muscular and smooth and hot, like, body temperature several magnitudes warmer than you expected — and you can feel his breathing quickening behind his clothing. His cologne is mixing with your sweat and his scent and you’re going from full body panic to arousal and back faster than your mind can keep up. He pulls back for a second, your mouth and his maw both slick with saliva, and the only thing you can really muster as a response is “Holy shit,” but the dragon still isn’t done, because he’s just mashed the “Close door” button a couple of times to avoid the elevator getting off at the next floor.

For a second you wonder about what would happen if the doors swung open to a couple CEOs suddenly looking at their two best workers making out in the company elevator, but then Shen presses himself to you and grinds up against your crotch so intensely that you almost black out then and there. 

It takes some maneuvering because the dragon is both kind of too big for the elevator and much taller than you, but he’s hooked one of his legs around yours and is undoing the belt around his pants with one clawed hand and desperately pawing at the one around yours with the other. You oblige, unzipping the fly on your trousers (wait, those are tailored, you can’t make a mess in those) and trying to pull down his pants with the other free hand. This shouldn’t be as difficult as you’re making it out to be, but your face is pressed deep against Shen’s chest, inhaling deep and drawing your tongue over the bare scales under the shirt, savoring how the big beast is quivering under your touch. It takes some fiddling, but you manage to pull his pants and underwear down around his thighs —  stripes same color gold as his eyes — and his manhood comes free, slick and throbbing.

“I think you’ve had a thing for *me* this entire time, actually,” you tell him. He makes a sound somewhere between a choked laugh and a grunt that rises in his throat as you take hold of his dick. 

“If you don’t want us getting fired, keep a finger on the Door Close button.” 

He doesn’t say anything else, but moves a hand to follow your command. You finish disrobing your own pants and stroke his length a little bit — his breathing becomes labored, and suddenly you realize that you quite literally have this hulking beast in your hands and under your control, which seems like an incredible turn of events compared to just a few minutes ago. You polish his pulsing red tip a little with your palm and he grits his teeth and bucks his hips against you, and you look up at the elevator display - there’s like 15 more floors until you reach the lobby, so as much as you’d like to make Shen beg you might actually have to wrap this up fairly quickly. Pressing his dick to yours, you tell him - “stay close” and begin to pump the two together and grind up against him and his body — growing hotter still by the moment and his ragged excited breathing beginning to synchronize with yours. 10th floor. Need to finish this off. 

“There’s something else you should know,” you tell him, and he’s so lost in himself and lost in you that he doesn’t even really hear what you say, just continues bucking against you while you jerk him off. “I know you think of yourself as the master negotiator who has us humans all figured out, but you don’t know me.” Your other hand drifts down to his tail — swishing constantly — and shapely ass, flexing and taut under your grip. “First — this isn’t a negotiation.”

“Second — I never lose.” 

You only manage to finger his ass for a moment before Shen totally loses himself and cums, which is enough to make you finish as well. He may have been totally lost in himself for the last couple of minutes, but he has the mental fortitude to at least remember where he is — he shoots ropes, a lot of them — but thankfully he pulls away from you and gets it all over the floor rather than your clothes. He stumbles back — forgetting he still has a leg wrapped around you — and the both of you crash to the opposite end of the elevator — you still have a couple more floors, enough time to get dressed, not enough time to clean up any of this mess, and for a second you have a twang of panic, but then you remember you’re resting your head against this dragon and you decide to forget about it. 

After a moment of recollecting himself, Shen exhales, “You’re a real son of a bitch, you know that?”

You shrug. 


Shen looks around at the inside of the elevator and adds, “But I guess I am too.”

“It’s why we have excellent chemistry as partners,” You tell him.
