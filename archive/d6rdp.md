##United Stellar States of Tokino (U.S.S.T.)

![Tokino Sora](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/2/24/Tokino_Sora_-_2020_3D_Model_06-1.png/revision/latest?cb=20210915132954)

##Leader: Tokino Sora

Size: 25’000 km2

Population: 4.42 Million 

Founding Date: Year 1

Capital: Okunotohe

Geography and Infrastructure: A slightly elevated plateau of many grasslands and forests. A low valley with a long river runs through the north of the nation and down south to Matsuri’s country. Sora is bordered by Roboco to the west, Yagoo’s Tower to the southwest, Matsuri to the south and east, and the endless fog to the north. 

The infrastructure is very beautiful with a design reminiscent of Greek architecture, replete with large amounts of marble buildings. Said buildings are often very large. It is more common to build onto an existing structure rather than build new ones, keeping the urban sprawl in the country down at the cost of making cities rather cramped. Significant portions of the economy go into creating religious places of worship, each more extravagant than the last. 

Flag: A cobalt 5-pointed star outlined in dark yellow projecting 15 sky blue rays over a cobalt field. 

General Overview: The United Stellar States are the first nation to come into existence, when the world was naught around it but fog. As the oldest state, they are considered by many to be the closest equivalent to a holy land on the planet. 

Many pilgrims flock to the states every year to worship and to join the Cult of Yagoo, the main religion of the nation. It has a higher-than-average number of religious zealots in its borders who often pressure others into joining their flock. 

The country is a theocratic monarchy with Sora at the head. She usually delegates leadership to the thirteen prime ministers which run the thirteen states that make up this nation. The reason for thirteen refers to the supposed original thirteen human templates Yagoo presented to Sora as blueprints for the Human race that she approved of. They prioritize moral quality over all else, and the lands of Sora are known for being clean, peaceful, and stable. 

Sora does not tolerate corruption or what she considers to be morally questionable decisions. Those who are unkind or unrighteous are swiftly removed from their positions. The people’s faith in Sora has ensured they remain devoted to her, and so actual examples of such bad behavior are quite rare. 

Much of the nation’s economy is tourism based, receiving many visitors every year who flock to the site of the world’s creation. The three core tenets of the state’s government is good morals, excellent conduct, and superb beauty.

Blessed: The blessed of Sora are extremely rare, being less in number than all other Blessed of their respective demigods. There are always thirteen in existence at once, with each fulfilling the function as a prime minister of one of the thirteen states. 

Every year, one among them is also elected as the high priest of the Yagoo cult for one year. Those blessed by Sora have their physical features shift into a perfect form, becoming beautiful beyond possibility. Almost all of Sora’s Blessed are women for unknown reasons.

Leader Description: Tokino Sora is the first, and mightiest, of Yagoo’s children. She also claims to have met him, the only one to do so, and also claims to have helped create humanity by selecting among the many templates that Yagoo offered her thirteen designs that would go on to form the basis of humanity.

 She formed the first state, wrote the first constitution for which all other states have taken inspiration from in some form, and convinced Yagoo to make other children, starting with her sister Roboco in the year 13. Despite all Yagoo has done to the world, Sora preaches forgiveness and worship of him, saying it is all in his grand design. She champions proper moral conduct and idol-like behavior, which she says pleases Yagoo, and forms the basis of her society with her people trying to emulate her and her decisions. 

It is through her influence and behavior that the cult of Yagoo thrives in her state and almost entirely in her state alone. Among her sisters she is highly respected and regarded for her righteous behavior and kindly nature, and has helped to solve many disputes. However, it is she alone who continues to be blindly obedient to Yagoo, much to the others chagrin and her countries delight.

Leader Powers: Sora is the mightiest of all the demigods. Her powers are near limitless. Flight, strength, speed, magic, nearly everything one can consider is at her disposal. Much like Superman, the only true limit is her moral character. While perfectly happy to defend her people, she shirks at the possibility of violence against another of her kind, and has in the past been reluctant to punish incursions or abuses by another of her siblings against her lands.

Nevertheless, her reputation is such that such incidents rarely happen, especially in this modern age of technology where word gets around fast. 

##Techno Union of Roboco

![Roboco](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/c/cd/Robocosan_V3_Full_Body.png/revision/latest?cb=20221212195900)

##Leader: Roboco-san

Size: 25’000 km2

Population: 3.12 Million

Founding Date: Year 13

Capital: Tama 

Geography and Infrastructure: The lands of the Techno Union are heavily industrialized and as a result have become an arid wasteland of near extinction where little life remains. Because food cannot be grown, it is instead produced in hydroponic labs or imported from outside. 

The Techno Union’s cities have become vast and almost self-sustaining machines that strip the earth bare to provide what its people need, while its technology has become one of the most advanced on the planet. A plan to repopulate the environment with cloned flora and fauna is currently in the works. 

The LaLion Sea’s river originates from here as the Mudwater River. Roboco is bordered to the west by Sora, the south by Yagoo’s Tower, the west by Ayame, the southwest by Suisei, and the endless fog to the north. 

Flag: A black diagonal band with a gunmetal gray eight-toothed circular gear in the middle. There are two triangles in the upper left and lower right-hand sides that divide the flag’s black band. These triangles are covered in an urban camouflage scheme of dark red, both light and dark gray, and pink. In the middle of both triangles is the white paw print of a feline. 

General Overview: The Techno Union are a highly industrial, urban, scientific focused technocracy focused on the advance of humanity’s knowledge and technical prowess above all else. Many of the new inventions of the world originate from the Techno Union, who treasure science and learning above all else. 

The Techno Union is also considered the world’s front-runner in robotics. It is very common for the citizens of this country to replace parts of their body with machines. Likewise, AI has become steadily more sophisticated at such a rate that fully autonomous worker robots are expected to be created within the next twenty years. 

The Techno Union elects its leaders based on expertise, with the leading engineers and scientists as the head of government. Due to worry of their own technology being used against them, they have refused to export their inventions, and are considered somewhat isolationist despite being among the most technologically advanced nations on the planet. 

Owing to the desecrated state of their terrain, what food is not imported is grown indoors, and because the air is so heavily polluted, it is quite common for the citizens of Roboco’s land to rarely venture outdoors. They can be thus easily identified by their pale and somewhat gaunt appearance. The people of this land believe that the ends justify the means, and so are willing to sacrifice basic liberties for the needs of the many, all up to a certain extent.

Blessed: Occasionally, a citizen of Roboco’s land will feel the need to further accessorize their body with mechanical parts beyond the norm. Forsaking flesh and their humanity, they will attempt to replace their entire body with metal and machine. This does not always work, but when it does, they join the ranks of Roboco’s Blessed. 

Cold and logical, her Blessed have given away what made them Human to attempt to become closer to her. Ironically, in doing so they have become more distant, and Roboco often feels quite uncomfortable around her Blessed. In time, as technology improves, it is likely that such fleeting concepts as emotions and senses may be retained. But for now, these Blessed are looked upon both with wonder and with fear. 

Leader Description: Roboco, often referred to with her honorific as Roboco-san, is the robotic demigod of the Techno Union, and the second of Yagoo’s children to come into existence. Roboco is mild, calm, but slightly air headed. In the past, this has been mistaken for ditziness, which Roboco has since proven to be not the case after an embarrassing defeat of Suisei nearly a century ago led to the loss of her eastern lands and the creation of what is now considered the southern panhandle of the Techno Union. 

Roboco has also been shown to be very diplomatically shrewd. She maintains a position of neutrality in most aspects of running her state, all the while spoon feeding the rest of the world her technological achievements to make them reliant on her state for exporting technology. In meetings with her kin, she maintains her soft-spoken and gentle demeanor which masks a more cunning mind, and there is a reason why the Techno Union is blindly obedient to her wishes. 

Leader Powers: Roboco, aside from being a robot, possesses the capability to create powerful beams of energy. This she uses to blast threats to her land from afar. In addition, she can control the strength, speed, density, and flow of said beams, and over the years has become very creative with her powers.

 In coordination with her robotic body, she is more than capable of using this in conjunction with upgrades to become an unstoppable machine on the battlefield. The Techno Union has been facing frequent incursions since day one, and its wastelands offer excellent breeding grounds for monsters, so Roboco is often busy protecting her lands seemingly every week. 

##Nocturnal State of Yozora

![Yozora Mel](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/e/e8/Yozora_Mel_Full_Body.png/revision/latest?cb=20230610065837)

##Leader: Yozora Mel

Size: 27’000 km2

Population: 3.5 Million

Founding Date: Year 17

Capital: Taramato

Geography and Infrastructure: The Nocturnal State features a wide variety of black spired gothic architecture to befit its ruler, Mel. Towering spires and ancient castles lurk atop tall hills over thatched roof villages with cobblestone homes. The country is very mountainous and craggy, though the soil is quite rich. Tomatoes and acerola cherries are grown here in abundance more so than any other part of the world, and are believed to originate from these lands. 

The mountains also provide excellent defense, which makes assaulting the lands hard. This comes at the cost of also harboring a much higher than normal rate of monsters. The day and night cycle in this land is always favoring long nights and short days. The sun does not rise until 8:30 AM and sets at 6:00 PM, leading to harsh winters and fervent summers. 

Because of the uneven terrain, many of the roads in the Nocturnal State are unpaved. Electricity was only recently fully adopted across the country, and many backwater villages and hamlets exist away from civilization’s interior. Most villages have at least one family of vampires to guard them. 

The country is landlocked and is bordered by Choco in the northwest, Suisei in the northeast, Miko in the east, Azki in the southeast, Aki in the southwest, and Subaru in the west. 

Flag: Five horizontal bands of yellow, black, white, black, and yellow. The black bands are double the width of the yellow bands, and the white band is double width of the black bands. In the center of the white band are two black bat wings. 

General Overview: The people of the Nocturnal State are quiet, suspicious of outsiders, and introverted. Because of the harshness of the land, as well as the near-death experience of Mel at the hands of foreign would-be usurpers, the Yozorans are not accepting of those who originate outside of their country, and tend towards xenophobia. 

There is a sharp divide between the ruling power of the common class and the elites, the vampires. Early on in the country’s history, Mel created the first vampires as her thralls, to make those who would better appreciate and understand her by becoming more like her. These vampires grew to become the nobility of the nation, and were expected to be their defenders as well.

The vampires held too much power, being taxed little, granted much of the peasantry’s lands, were allowed to drink the blood of the peasants, and were greedy with their power. In the year 50, the vampires were coerced by outside agitators of an unknown state to attempt to kill Mel. What followed was her disappearance and a bitter civil war between the vampires and foreign agents against the peasants and Mel’s Blessed. 

In the end the peasantry won, and the power of the vampires was reduced. Mel returned towards the end of the conflict and revealed she’d been forced into hiding to recover her strength after being poisoned and nearly losing her life. With Mel on their side, the civil war ended quickly in favor of the peasants in the year 63. 

As a result of their betrayal, the power of the vampires was reduced, and many houses or titles were expunged. These days, the vampires enjoy a higher social class, but few of the luxuries they once did, being closer to an upper middle class in wealth. They do still, however, retain control of the country’s government. Both classes remain highly devoted to Mel, whose popularity only grew after the civil war. 

The Nocturnal State remains somewhat poor, and is primarily agrarian in function. Only just able to grow enough to feed itself, and totally unwilling to harbor tourists, this closeted and old country seems as if it will remain this way for years to come. 

Blessed: The Blessed of Mel are created by Mel specifically when she chooses to bite a vampire. This second bite magnifies their powers further, and their bond with Mel increases. Psychically attuned, they become true forces of nature, capable of incredible feats of strength, agility, and endurance. Their job, in addition to keeping monsters at bay, is also to keep the lesser vampires in check. Mel has not yet fully forgiven them for their betrayal, so fewer Blessed are made today than once were. 

Mel knows where her Blessed are at all times due to their psychic bond, and their devotion to her is beyond fanatical. This has led to incidents of overzealous protection in the past, as they have grown paranoid after Mel’s near-death experiences. Though they serve no function in the country’s government, they work tirelessly to make sure no corruption spreads among the vampires. 

Leader Description: Yozora Mel, beloved by her country (and don’t you dare let them think you don’t love her either), is a sweet and calm woman who is known for dealing with pressure and stressful situations rather well. This personality of hers, as well as siding with the people during the civil war, has made her tremendously popular in her country. Most of her countrymen would gladly die for her. 

As a vampire however, and especially a powerful one like her, she must occasionally drink blood. While she tries to suppress this urge as much as possible, every now and then a human sacrifice is required. It is considered a great honor among the Nocturnal State to be eaten by Mel, to the point that people opt in for selection, and being selected is seen as the equivalent of winning the lottery. Outsiders wonder if perhaps Mel has used hypnosis on her population to make them love her.

Unlike many of the other demigods who rule their lands, Mel is not a terribly ambitious one. She is quite content with what she has been given. She also does not tend to interfere in the administration of her nation either, leaving this to those she has governed. Mel does not desire a grand state, but simply a functional one, and despite the Nocturnal State’s poverty she seems content. 

Leader Powers: As a vampire, Mel has all of the powers expected of one in such a role. This includes flight, blood-draining, incredible strength and endurance, and the ability to turn into animals such as bats. Other powers such as hypnosis are also rumored but not confirmed, and Mel has also practiced some level of hemomancy in order to bolster her powers. The practice of hemomancy is currently banned to the general public, and no magical studies exist en masse within the Nocturnal State. 

Although not giving the appearance of one who would seem a strong fighter, Mel has proven time and again she is not to be trifled with. A popular account of her tearing a rogue vampire in half with her bare hands in one, single rip, is often used as an example of her innate strength.
