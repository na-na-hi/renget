78: For the crime of conspiring to destroy Yagoo together and replace him with a new system, he enacts judgment upon Doris, Rosalyn, Artia, Civia, Spade, and Yogiri. Artia, the ringleader of the plot, alongside Spade and Civia, are destroyed instantly and their lands reduced to ash.

117: Having grown dissatisfied with the world, Sana requests Yagoo’s permission to leave to explore the stars. He agrees. The inhabitants of her land bid her farewell, knowing they would never see her again. Sightings are sometimes reported in the night sky by observatories of a massive goddess adrift in the far depths of outer space. 
118: Regis, Vesper, Axel, and Magni are created.
126: For not showing proper respect to Yagoo, Vesper’s western lands are scorched with rays of hellfire, annihilating a good portion of his territory. The land remains uninhabitable to this day.

##United Stellar States of Tokino (U.S.S.T.)

![Tokino Sora](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/a/a6/Tokino_Sora_-_2018_3D_Model_04-3.png/revision/latest?cb=20210915132815)

*Leader: Tokino Sora*

*Size: 25’000 km2*

*Population: 4.42 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 1*

*Capital: Okunotohe*

###Geography and Infrastructure 
A slightly elevated plateau of many grasslands and forests. A low valley with a long river runs through the north of the nation and down south to Matsuri’s country. Sora is bordered by Roboco to the west, Yagoo’s Tower to the southwest, Matsuri to the south and east, and the endless fog to the north. 

The infrastructure is very beautiful with a design reminiscent of Greek architecture, replete with large amounts of marble buildings. Said buildings are often very large. It is more common to build onto an existing structure rather than build new ones, keeping the urban sprawl in the country down at the cost of making cities rather cramped. Significant portions of the economy go into creating religious places of worship, each more extravagant than the last. 

###Flag
A cobalt 5-pointed star outlined in dark yellow projecting 15 sky blue rays over a cobalt field. 

###General Overview
The United Stellar States are the first nation to come into existence, when the world was naught around it but fog. As the oldest state, they are considered by many to be the closest equivalent to a holy land on the planet. 

Many pilgrims flock to the states every year to worship and to join the Cult of Yagoo, the main religion of the nation. It has a higher-than-average number of religious zealots in its borders who often pressure others into joining their flock. 

The country is a theocratic monarchy with Sora at the head. She usually delegates leadership to the thirteen prime ministers which run the thirteen states that make up this nation. The reason for thirteen refers to the supposed original thirteen human templates Yagoo presented to Sora as blueprints for the Human race that she approved of. They prioritize moral quality over all else, and the lands of Sora are known for being clean, peaceful, and stable. 

Sora does not tolerate corruption or what she considers to be morally questionable decisions. Those who are unkind or unrighteous are swiftly removed from their positions. The people’s faith in Sora has ensured they remain devoted to her, and so actual examples of such bad behavior are quite rare. 

Much of the nation’s economy is tourism based, receiving many visitors every year who flock to the site of the world’s creation. The three core tenets of the state’s government is good morals, excellent conduct, and superb beauty.

###Blessed 
The blessed of Sora are extremely rare, being less in number than all other Blessed of their respective demigods. There are always thirteen in existence at once, with each fulfilling the function as a prime minister of one of the thirteen states. 

Every year, one among them is also elected as the high priest of the Yagoo cult for one year. Those blessed by Sora have their physical features shift into a perfect form, becoming beautiful beyond possibility. Almost all of Sora’s Blessed are women for unknown reasons.

###Leader Description
Tokino Sora is the first, and mightiest, of Yagoo’s children. She also claims to have met him, the only one to do so, and also claims to have helped create humanity by selecting among the many templates that Yagoo offered her thirteen designs that would go on to form the basis of humanity.

 She formed the first state, wrote the first constitution for which all other states have taken inspiration from in some form, and convinced Yagoo to make other children, starting with her sister Roboco in the year 13. Despite all Yagoo has done to the world, Sora preaches forgiveness and worship of him, saying it is all in his grand design. She champions proper moral conduct and idol-like behavior, which she says pleases Yagoo, and forms the basis of her society with her people trying to emulate her and her decisions. 

It is through her influence and behavior that the cult of Yagoo thrives in her state and almost entirely in her state alone. Among her sisters she is highly respected and regarded for her righteous behavior and kindly nature, and has helped to solve many disputes. However, it is she alone who continues to be blindly obedient to Yagoo, much to the others chagrin and her countries delight.

###Leader Powers
Sora is the mightiest of all the demigods. Her powers are near limitless. Flight, strength, speed, magic, nearly everything one can consider is at her disposal. Much like Superman, the only true limit is her moral character. While perfectly happy to defend her people, she shirks at the possibility of violence against another of her kind, and has in the past been reluctant to punish incursions or abuses by another of her siblings against her lands.

Nevertheless, her reputation is such that such incidents rarely happen, especially in this modern age of technology where word gets around fast. 

##Techno Union of Roboco

![Roboco](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/c/cd/Robocosan_V3_Full_Body.png/revision/latest?cb=20221212195900)

###Leader: Roboco-san

*Size: 25’000 km2*

*Population: 3.12 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 13*

*Capital: Tama*

###Geography and Infrastructure 
The lands of the Techno Union are heavily industrialized and as a result have become an arid wasteland of near extinction where little life remains. Because food cannot be grown, it is instead produced in hydroponic labs or imported from outside. 

The Techno Union’s cities have become vast and almost self-sustaining machines that strip the earth bare to provide what its people need, while its technology has become one of the most advanced on the planet. A plan to repopulate the environment with cloned flora and fauna is currently in the works. 

The LaLion Sea’s river originates from here as the Mudwater River. Roboco is bordered to the west by Sora, the south by Yagoo’s Tower, the west by Ayame, the southwest by Suisei, and the endless fog to the north. 

###Flag
A black diagonal band with a gunmetal gray eight-toothed circular gear in the middle. There are two triangles in the upper left and lower right-hand sides that divide the flag’s black band. These triangles are covered in an urban camouflage scheme of dark red, both light and dark gray, and pink. In the middle of both triangles is the white paw print of a feline. 

###General Overview
The Techno Union are a highly industrial, urban, scientific focused technocracy focused on the advance of humanity’s knowledge and technical prowess above all else. Many of the new inventions of the world originate from the Techno Union, who treasure science and learning above all else. 

The Techno Union is also considered the world’s front-runner in robotics. It is very common for the citizens of this country to replace parts of their body with machines. Likewise, AI has become steadily more sophisticated at such a rate that fully autonomous worker robots are expected to be created within the next twenty years. 

The Techno Union elects its leaders based on expertise, with the leading engineers and scientists as the head of government. Due to worry of their own technology being used against them, they have refused to export their inventions, and are considered somewhat isolationist despite being among the most technologically advanced nations on the planet. 

Owing to the desecrated state of their terrain, what food is not imported is grown indoors, and because the air is so heavily polluted, it is quite common for the citizens of Roboco’s land to rarely venture outdoors. They can be thus easily identified by their pale and somewhat gaunt appearance. The people of this land believe that the ends justify the means, and so are willing to sacrifice basic liberties for the needs of the many, all up to a certain extent.

###Blessed
Occasionally, a citizen of Roboco’s land will feel the need to further accessorize their body with mechanical parts beyond the norm. Forsaking flesh and their humanity, they will attempt to replace their entire body with metal and machine. This does not always work, but when it does, they join the ranks of Roboco’s Blessed. 

Cold and logical, her Blessed have given away what made them Human to attempt to become closer to her. Ironically, in doing so they have become more distant, and Roboco often feels quite uncomfortable around her Blessed. In time, as technology improves, it is likely that such fleeting concepts as emotions and senses may be retained. But for now, these Blessed are looked upon both with wonder and with fear. 

###Leader Description
Roboco, often referred to with her honorific as Roboco-san, is the robotic demigod of the Techno Union, and the second of Yagoo’s children to come into existence. Roboco is mild, calm, but slightly air headed. In the past, this has been mistaken for ditziness, which Roboco has since proven to be not the case after an embarrassing defeat of Suisei nearly a century ago led to the loss of her eastern lands and the creation of what is now considered the southern panhandle of the Techno Union. 

Roboco has also been shown to be very diplomatically shrewd. She maintains a position of neutrality in most aspects of running her state, all the while spoon feeding the rest of the world her technological achievements to make them reliant on her state for exporting technology. In meetings with her kin, she maintains her soft-spoken and gentle demeanor which masks a more cunning mind, and there is a reason why the Techno Union is blindly obedient to her wishes. 

###Leader Powers
Roboco, aside from being a robot, possesses the capability to create powerful beams of energy. This she uses to blast threats to her land from afar. In addition, she can control the strength, speed, density, and flow of said beams, and over the years has become very creative with her powers.

In coordination with her robotic body, she is more than capable of using this in conjunction with upgrades to become an unstoppable machine on the battlefield. The Techno Union has been facing frequent incursions since day one, and its wastelands offer excellent breeding grounds for monsters, so Roboco is often busy protecting her lands seemingly every week. 

##Stellar Republic of Hoshimachi

![Hoshimachi Suisei](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/2/2f/Hoshimachi_Suisei_3D_Model_Transparent.png/revision/latest?cb=20221002211704)

###Leader: Hoshimachi Suisei

*Size: 25’000 km2*

*Population: 4.06 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 14*

*Capital: Mihoyami*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The Stellar Republic is seen as the rising star of the nations of the world. Once a harsh backwater that fought incessantly with its neighbors for resources and survival, under the leadership and determination of Suisei, they have grown to become a new regional powerhouse in both might and economy. Proud fighters and infamous for their tenacity, the armies of the Stellar Republic have been aiding the other nations in the perpetual battle against the endless fog.

However, this was not always the case. Once, the Stellar Republic was a troubled and angry nation that lashed out at its neighbors with little regard for what others thought. The Stellar Republic has been at war with every state it borders in the past, many of them unsuccessful save for one which annexed the southern tips of Ayame’s lands, and the northern tip of Mel’s. 

Today the country is modernized. Having focused inward instead of outward for growth, it has gone from the troubled black sheep of the nations near the tower to a shining star that is a superpower in the region, and is currently the largest economy in the region as well, surpassing the Elite Shinto Dynasty of Sakura. They have urbanized significantly, but not to the extent of the bordering Techno Union.

Suisei’s lands are mainly taiga, and have a cooler than average temperature with highs of low 80’s and lows of 20’s in the Fahrenheit scale. Much of the old growth has been chopped down through the decades of urban expansion, though some patches still remain to give the country a natural feel. It is bordered by Roboco in the north, Ayame in the northwest, Choco in the west, Mel in the southwest, Miko in the southeast and east, Yagoo’s Tower in the east, and Sora in the northwest. Most of the cities are heavily developed and linked via a well-maintained system of highways and roads. Poverty and unemployment has been dropping rapidly for the past several decades as well. 

###Flag
A white field with two obtuse triangles of ultramarine in the top and bottom respectively, giving the white field the appearance of being diagonal, facing right. A stylized shooting star is in the middle of the flag, facing towards the left. The star itself is a golden five-pointed star overlapping a bronze five-pointed star except for the tips of the bronze star, which jut out from the non-pointed angles of the golden star, giving it the appearance of a ten-pointed star. The overall tail of the comet is composed of three colors and five tails. The first color is a lighter blue with one tail, which overlaps a darker blue with two tails, which overlaps an even dark blue also with two tails, for a total of five tails. 

###General Overview
The Stellar Republic is the unlikely story of a nation with all odds stacked against it that, like their leader, arose like a rising star to become a regional superpower. In the beginning, however, the nation was a hard and difficult land to live in. At the time of its creation, much of it was bordered by fog. Although not unusual in those early days, what was unusual was the harsher climate and volume of attacks. 

Because of this, the struggle to survive was much more severe than in other lands of the time. Colder climates made it more difficult to grow food as well. Not only this, but constant disruption due to monster attacks often threatened the viability of crops. 

What began as raids by the desperate soon turned into a tradition of stealing from other lands, which then escalated into constant warfare. Suisei gained a fell reputation as a bloodthirsty warmonger. All confrontations into her behavior were rebuffed, stating that she needed what they had so her country did not go extinct. Indeed, in those days, times were hard. Mortality rates were high, average lifespan was lower than that of other surrounding nations, famine was common, and conscription was mandatory. 

The first change came after an embarrassing defeat by Choco’s much smaller armed forces in the year 58. During yet another dialogue of treaties and land changes, Suisei poured out her frustrations over the years of mistreatment and poor fortune she felt she had received. By now her borders had become more secure. She no longer bordered the fog, though endless warfare and attrition had kept her lands poor. It was a vicious cycle. 

To her surprise, Sora agreed. Though others were sick of her and her constant muddling, Sora proposed thus. Choco, Roboco, and Miko would grant a portion of their lands to Suisei as appeasement. In return, Suisei would not attack them again or risk a combined assault to wipe out her state. What happened afterwards was up to her. 

With peace finally achieved, Suisei reflected. She was rather unpopular, for obvious reasons. To say her nation was the only one with strife was a lie as well, for Mel was in the midst of a brutal and vicious civil war and was still missing, while Roboco and Ayame were dealing with constant barrages of monster assaults. This was a hard world, she mused. 

Suisei decided to change this. For the first several years, she focused on the infrastructure of her lands, a much-needed change. Commodities became more common, resources more available to her people, and, most importantly, a more sophisticated means of preserving and growing food using newer farming techniques and technologies. 

In the year 65, Suisei began to offer her army’s services as hired mercenaries in other nations. They would pay a tithe to Suisei, who would have them guard their lands from monsters. Already battle hardened and with many veterans in their ranks, multiple nations found their borders more secured. Income flowed into the Stellar Republic, and these bands became known as the Comet Legions. 

With the added cash, the country modernized and democratized, transitioning from an authoritarian state into a democratic one as Suisei finally stepped down into an advisory role (though still retaining the traditional title Stellar Leader). So far, she has not acted to remove individuals from government, trusting the will of the people. Indeed, corruption in the Stellar Republic is quite low. 

In modern years, the Stellar Republic is a massive success story. Having successfully urbanized and updated their country into a fully functional one with a massive GDP, the Comet Legions are known across the world as protectors of the peace who, for a price, will keep your lands safe. Though casualties are high, it is considered an honor to serve, for in their mind you are bettering not just your client’s lands but your homelands as well. 

The Stellar Republic has also become famous for its entertainers. Many famous singers originate from these lands. Finest among them is Hoshimachi Suisei herself, who is thought by many to be perhaps the best of all the demigods in terms of musical talents. 

###Blessed
The Blessed of Suisei are growing more common with every year. They primarily inherit their demigoddesses’ physical traits, often growing blue hair and becoming slender. A notable talent they all share is an incredible vocal range, one which Suisei herself is famous for. 

They are often found commanding the Comet Legions, as the transformation greatly enhances their reaction times. A fondness for stargazing, optimism, and energetic behavior is also noted to affect their personality, almost as if lost in a dream. This is great contrast to the early Blessed, who were far more bloodthirsty in behavior. 

###Leader Description
Hoshimachi Suisei, the shooting star, has come far throughout the years to get to where she is. After countless struggles, she has finally achieved what she sought so long ago, that being a stable, peaceful, and above all powerful country.

Suisei has focused on her musical career in recent years, leaving much of the governing to the citizenry. Among all of the demigods, she perhaps has among the least role in governing these days. She has also worked to patch up her reputation over the years, to a fairly decent degree of success.

It must be noted however that a ruthless streak exists in her that tends to come out when angered. Though one would not suspect it by looking at her, brutality is one of her favorite ways to solve problems. If one visits her personal dwelling, they may note a collection of skulls of those who particularly annoyed her in the past. Some state that the low corruption of the lands has less to do with love than it does with fear.

###Leader Powers
Hoshimachi Suisei, as befitting her name, controls a unique form of cosmic and stellar magic that pulls foreign objects from orbit or manifests them. Although this would ordinarily lend itself to a ranged fighting style, Suisei prefers to use it point blank for maximum effect. She also often combos it with her trusty axe which she is never without. 

Her enthusiasm to use her axe to split skulls has often alarmed the others, particularly the way she cackles gleefully as she cleaves skulls, but Suisei has never seemed to mind. However, this is usually how she toys with her foes. When she needs to get serious, she will ascend and begin raining comets down from the skies to absolutely flatten and obliterate all around her. Because of the high chance of friendly fire, her soldiers know the best way to survive is by staying as far away from her as possible. 

##Nocturnal State of Yozora

![Yozora Mel](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/b/ba/Yozora_Mel_3D_Model.png/revision/latest?cb=20221002201426)

###Leader: Yozora Mel

*Size: 27’000 km2*

*Population: 3.5 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 17*

*Capital: Taramato*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The Nocturnal State features a wide variety of black spired gothic architecture to befit its ruler, Mel. Towering spires and ancient castles lurk atop tall hills over thatched roof villages with cobblestone homes. The country is very mountainous and craggy, though the soil is quite rich. Tomatoes and acerola cherries are grown here in abundance more so than any other part of the world, and are believed to originate from these lands. 

The mountains also provide excellent defense, which makes assaulting the lands hard. This comes at the cost of also harboring a much higher than normal rate of monsters. The day and night cycle in this land is always favoring long nights and short days. The sun does not rise until 8:30 AM and sets at 6:00 PM, leading to harsh winters and fervent summers. 

Because of the uneven terrain, many of the roads in the Nocturnal State are unpaved. Electricity was only recently fully adopted across the country, and many backwater villages and hamlets exist away from civilization’s interior. Most villages have at least one family of vampires to guard them. 

The country is landlocked and is bordered by Choco in the northwest, Suisei in the northeast, Miko in the east, Azki in the southeast, Aki in the southwest, and Subaru in the west. 

###Flag
Five horizontal bands of yellow, black, white, black, and yellow. The black bands are double the width of the yellow bands, and the white band is double width of the black bands. In the center of the white band are two black bat wings. 

###General Overview
The people of the Nocturnal State are quiet, suspicious of outsiders, and introverted. Because of the harshness of the land, as well as the near-death experience of Mel at the hands of foreign would-be usurpers, the Yozorans are not accepting of those who originate outside of their country, and tend towards xenophobia. 

There is a sharp divide between the ruling power of the common class and the elites, the vampires. Early on in the country’s history, Mel created the first vampires as her thralls, to make those who would better appreciate and understand her by becoming more like her. These vampires grew to become the nobility of the nation, and were expected to be their defenders as well.

The vampires held too much power, being taxed little, granted much of the peasantry’s lands, were allowed to drink the blood of the peasants, and were greedy with their power. In the year 50, the vampires were coerced by outside agitators of an unknown state to attempt to kill Mel. What followed was her disappearance and a bitter civil war between the vampires and foreign agents against the peasants and Mel’s Blessed. 

In the end the peasantry won, and the power of the vampires was reduced. Mel returned towards the end of the conflict and revealed she’d been forced into hiding to recover her strength after being poisoned and nearly losing her life. With Mel on their side, the civil war ended quickly in favor of the peasants in the year 63. 

As a result of their betrayal, the power of the vampires was reduced, and many houses or titles were expunged. These days, the vampires enjoy a higher social class, but few of the luxuries they once did, being closer to an upper middle class in wealth. They do still, however, retain control of the country’s government. Both classes remain highly devoted to Mel, whose popularity only grew after the civil war. 

The Nocturnal State remains somewhat poor, and is primarily agrarian in function. Only just able to grow enough to feed itself, and totally unwilling to harbor tourists, this closeted and old country seems as if it will remain this way for years to come. 

###Blessed
The Blessed of Mel are created by Mel specifically when she chooses to bite a vampire. This second bite magnifies their powers further, and their bond with Mel increases. Psychically attuned, they become true forces of nature, capable of incredible feats of strength, agility, and endurance. Their job, in addition to keeping monsters at bay, is also to keep the lesser vampires in check. Mel has not yet fully forgiven them for their betrayal, so fewer Blessed are made today than once were. 

Mel knows where her Blessed are at all times due to their psychic bond, and their devotion to her is beyond fanatical. This has led to incidents of overzealous protection in the past, as they have grown paranoid after Mel’s near-death experiences. Though they serve no function in the country’s government, they work tirelessly to make sure no corruption spreads among the vampires. 

###Leader Description
Yozora Mel, beloved by her country (and don’t you dare let them think you don’t love her either), is a sweet and calm woman who is known for dealing with pressure and stressful situations rather well. This personality of hers, as well as siding with the people during the civil war, has made her tremendously popular in her country. Most of her countrymen would gladly die for her. 

As a vampire however, and especially a powerful one like her, she must occasionally drink blood. While she tries to suppress this urge as much as possible, every now and then a human sacrifice is required. It is considered a great honor among the Nocturnal State to be eaten by Mel, to the point that people opt in for selection, and being selected is seen as the equivalent of winning the lottery. Outsiders wonder if perhaps Mel has used hypnosis on her population to make them love her.

Unlike many of the other demigods who rule their lands, Mel is not a terribly ambitious one. She is quite content with what she has been given. She also does not tend to interfere in the administration of her nation either, leaving this to those she has governed. Mel does not desire a grand state, but simply a functional one, and despite the Nocturnal State’s poverty she seems content. 

###Leader Powers
As a vampire, Mel has all of the powers expected of one in such a role. This includes flight, blood-draining, incredible strength and endurance, and the ability to turn into animals such as bats. Other powers such as hypnosis are also rumored but not confirmed, and Mel has also practiced some level of hemomancy in order to bolster her powers. The practice of hemomancy is currently banned to the general public, and no magical studies exist en masse within the Nocturnal State. 

Although not giving the appearance of one who would seem a strong fighter, Mel has proven time and again she is not to be trifled with. A popular account of her tearing a rogue vampire in half with her bare hands in one, single rip, is often used as an example of her innate strength.

##Friendly Union of Shirakami

###Leader: Sakura Miko

*Size: 32’000 km2*

*Population: 6.34 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 23*

*Capital: Aizen*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The Elite Shinto Dynasty is a peaceful landlocked nation with many quiet forests, tall snowy mountains, serene fields of grass and gently trickling waterfalls. Its cities are primarily made of wood, and are well-developed yet fitting in well with nature so as not to overwhelm it. There is a symbiosis in this country between man and wildlife which makes it a very comfortable place to live. The average altitude of the country is higher than normal. 

Shintoism is the dominant religion in this land, unlike the worship of Yagoo. Best described as a mixture between animism and polytheism with traces of Buddhism, numerous shrines exist throughout the nation. Even the smallest villa will have at least one shrine. When leaving on a journey, it is a custom to visit your shrine before you go to bring you good luck. 

A singular volcano sits outside of the capital Aizen, known as Mt. Kazan. This volcano is mostly dormant, and plays a key role in the art as a prominent backdrop. A famous incident in Miko’s life led to her somehow simultaneously falling into the volcano and triggering an eruption which destroyed most of the capital in the year 38. The exact circumstances of this incident have been suppressed on Miko’s orders. 

The nation is bordered to the north by Yagoo’s Tower and Suisei, Mel to the west, AZKi to the Southwest, Fubuki to the southeast, the ruins of Chris to the east, and Matsuri to the northeast. 

###Flag
A large white circle over a dark pink background. In the center of the circle are five pink cherry blossom petals, forming a complete cherry blossom.  

###General Overview
The Elite Shinto Dynasty is somewhat of a misnomer, as the nation’s titular dynasty consists of exactly one individual who has no real government function. It instead operates as a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy, with Miko having willingly stepped down from operating as head of government after realizing she simply wasn’t very good at it. This peaceful transition to power not only saved the nation but allowed it to thrive. 

Miko is technically the head of state, religion, and military all at the same time. In theory this gives her almost unlimited power. However, in practice she can be vetoed by nearly every branch of society she operates in. As a result, Miko, despite being loved and respected, does not command much power within her own country, being almost redundant. Miko is allowed to advise or make decisions in most matters, and is well regarded, but often others will go around her or adjust her ideas. 

Although she could certainly go on a rampage and use force if she wished to usurp back power, Miko simply isn’t that sort of person, and is quite tolerant of the masses so long as they don’t try and take away her comforts. In fact, she does not participate much in decision making these days unless she feels it’s crucial. 

The country’s origins lie in the murky past in the early days of the world, and coming fresh off the destruction of Chris. Much of Miko’s territory bordered this ruined fogland. Put in charge of a new country, Miko found that the logistics of building up her country as well as fending off attacks and managing her religion were too much for her to manage. So, she delegated the task to her people.

In the year 43, Miko handed power over to her countrymen. What was widely seen as an impoverished and failing state began to slowly turn around. Always a bit disinterested in such aspects of civilization, Miko was able to focus more on defending her homeland and shrines while the people managed the resources of the land. The new arrangement greatly worked in her favor, as it lessened her workload significantly and made her much more focused. This continued when in the year 103, Miko also gave up her military and religious powers for a more facial based role instead as opposed to function. 

Content with lazing about and occasionally showing up for various functionaries, Miko has become complacent in her life. So complacent in fact that she did not mind when her royal position as empress and high priestess of the realm became little more than a title with a tax break. Miko has yet to complain. As far as she’s concerned, she’s succeeded, as befits an “elite” demigoddess like her. So far, she has not yet made an effort to find an heir, though there are rumors she may one day grow bored and depart. 

The Elite Shinto Dynasty is like a well-organized machine. The trains run on time, the lands are well-guarded, and the economy is good. It is the largest country in the region, and was even larger in the past before forfeiting some lands to Suisei. Its shrines are also home to a strong if localized religious community. Miko spends a fair portion of her free time making sure shrines are kept up to quality, and that proper rites are being observed. As often as she is accused of being lazy, a badly maintained shrine is one of the few things to get her going. 

One notable problem of the country is corruption, particularly bribery. With the demigod of the state being lax, politicians in all levels of the nation hold more allegiance to coin than to country. As Miko is quite happy with letting her people run the show, and nothing so far has come of it besides annoyance, it is unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Travelers should bring extra cash for bribes lest the wheels of bureaucracy churn slowly. 

###Blessed
The Blessed of Miko are known for their pink hair, and a shocking decline in dexterity related functions, becoming very clumsy. Although many would not see this as a boon, her Blessed fervently maintain this is a symbol of them becoming closer to her. They mainly act in a high priest function for the religion of the land, as their clumsiness renders them unsuitable for many tasks. Thus, they devote their life to studying Shinto, and become very knowledgeable in the magic and rites that their god shares with them. Miko often consorts with them to garner knowledge of the country during times she is preoccupied with other matters. 

###Leader Description
Sakura Miko is certainly an interesting demigod. From an outside perspective she seems airheaded, clumsy, and a bit pompous. This is not technically incorrect, but it hides a much more intelligent personality than she lets on. Miko is aware very much she does not make for a great leader, not possessing the capabilities to properly organize a nation. By keeping the country run by the people, she keeps them happy, and herself happy. 

Miko maintains positive relations with all of her neighboring states, especially Fubuki, of whom the kami ridden forests mesh well with the Shinto shrines of her country. In the past she devoted serious time and effort to creating magic to cleanse what was once the lands of Chris from monsters, but has largely given up from lack of progress. 

Miko often professes herself to be “elite” and has a somewhat haughty streak that can get her into trouble. The most famous of these incidents led to the capital being burnt down and her refusing to go near open flame of any sort for the rest of her life. Miko finds herself humiliated and humbled time and again, but always seems to bounce back regardless. What she lacks in motor coordination she makes up for in tenacity.

Some often question why she is so inactive in the modern world. The truth is quite simple, and it’s that she puts her own needs first. Feeling that her reward should be to enjoy life for defending the people (though these days she only intervenes when necessary), Miko has created a land designed around being as easy for her to relax in as possible. While others fight for survival, Miko chills out on the couch and watches television. The best way to get her to act is if she thinks the country’s future is in imminent danger. She’ll work extra hard so she doesn’t have to work at all if that’s the case. 
 
###Leader Powers
Miko’s powers are somewhat unusual. As a shrine maiden, much of her powers relate to Shintoism. She specializes in magic, specifically rituals and purification, making her an expert in dealing with ghosts and spirits. Miko is widely recognized as the greatest exorcist in the world. When not cleansing the lands, she uses her powers to heal or augment others, or make the lines blur between reality and the spirit world to attack from unusual spots.  

##AZKian Virtual Frontier

![AZKi](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/7/77/AZKi_Fourth_3D_Model.png/revision/latest?cb=20221115204043)

###Leader: Virtual Diva AZKi

*Size: 28’000 km2*

*Population: 7.02 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 29*

*Capital: Totokumi*

###Geography and Infrastructure 
The Virtual Frontier is a heavily urbanized nation which has turned the majority of its central country into an urban megacity. Only the outer edges furthest away from the capital retain any trace of greenery left. It is a somewhat hilly country but with few rivers, so it has a slightly arid climate. From all sides it is surrounded by fellow nations, although many of its rivers do link to the sea eventually. 

The train was invented here, which revolutionized transportation and paved the way for further inventions such as automobiles, planes, and the like. Unlike the somewhat reclusive nation of Roboco, the people of the Virtual Frontier have always been extroverted and willing to share their technological gains.

A significant portion of the country is in virtual space, much like their demigoddess AZKi. . It was AZKi herself who created the virtual world when the nation was first founded, though it was significantly more primitive at the timeMost citizens lead a double life in virtual reality independent of their physical form. The nation has advanced so heavily into virtual development that they expect the ability to create virtual life before the century is out. What this means is that most of the population lives two lives at once. This includes the government, of whom a Physical and a Virtual parliament exist. 

The AZKian Virtual Frontier is bordered by Miko to the northeast, Mel to the northwest, Aki to the west, a small portion of Miyabi to the southwest that was taken in a war, Haato/Haachama to the south, and Fubuki to the east. 

###Flag
Two left facing diagonal bands of black and dark pink. The black band has a smaller light blue band running down the right side. In the top left and bottom right corner are two white acute triangles that both point towards the corners of the flag. 

###General Overview 
As prior mentioned, the Virtual Frontier is distinguished by its neighbors for its openness and virtual reality pioneering. The Virtual Frontier has long encouraged members of the other nations to adopt their virtual reality-based lifestyles too, to mild success. Almost all citizens have an alternate avatar where they can live their private lives, and many dream of one day bridging the gap completely to be with their demigod. 

It was AZKi who first suggested to Sora the benefits of collaborating through the internet as a means of both entertainment and diplomacy. Since the first streams began in the year 94, warfare between the nations has dropped. In a way, it could be said AZKi is the greatest diplomat of her sisters and brothers. 

AZKi primarily operates in the virtual world instead of physical reality, and specializes in virtual monsters, not physical. As a result, her citizens’ best chance to interact with her is to join her in the virtual world, where the cover of anonymity allows for greater confidence. Most of the country operates on a virtual backdrop to its physical counterparts, which means that it is just as large to explore as the nation itself. 

The country is not all sunshine and rainbows, however. Like all utopias, it has its seedy underbelly. For once, cyber crime is a serious felony in this state. This wide reaching term covers aspects such as avatar destruction, hacking, virtualspace terrorism, and various other forms of mischief and larceny that endanger and degrade the virtual world. It is possible to die in the real world if the virtual body sustains enough trauma. There is also the risk of becoming too engrossed. Many are the tales of bodies wasted away to nothing while their minds roam the avatar realms forever, growing wilder and madder. 

After the tragic disappearance of Aloe Mano, AZKi founded the Exploration Corps which aims to map out the known world in spite of the fog by using both virtual and physical exploration. These brave scouts have aided many lost souls trapped close to the endless fog, assisted in the evacuations of doomed countries, and scouted out the physical geography of the fog lands. 

The map of the world, unmarked as it is, has been meticulously scouted and detailed on the Exploration Corps maps. Strange landmarks and features cause many to guess at what Yagoo is building out there, and these maps have also been used to plan out means of defense against future monster attacks. 

###Blessed
The Blessed of AZKi lose their physical form entirely, becoming true virtual entities of raw data so complex it would make a computer pop like a balloon if converted onto a hard drive. They gain near unlimited power over virtual space as well, and often assist AZKi by acting as virtual police.  

Of course, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Although exceedingly rare for a Blessed to betray their demigod, it is not impossible. Because of the near unlimited amount of matter warping allocated to these Blessed in the Virtual World, when they go rogue, and it happens more often than other demigods, they become a serious threat, erasing and destroying as they go. 

###Leader Description
AZKi is an unusual demigod in that she prefers to exist in the realm of virtual than physical, having often cited she feels uncomfortable in the real world. In her own realm, which she helped create, she sings and performs nearly every day. Entertained subjects are happy ones. This is the creed she has always stuck by, and it has allowed her nation to thrive. The people of the Virtual Frontier are joyous, and love their ruler. 

AZKi is both persistent and playful, someone who doesn’t take things too seriously yet refuses to give up on challenges. Multiple times she has dealt with exhaustive levels of monsters to keep her people safe. Multiple times she has collapsed from exhaustion and overexertion. Because she created the virtual world, she feels responsible for it, and often blames herself when things go wrong. 

###Leader Powers 
AZKi, being a virtual diva, has the power to manipulate the space around her as she sees fit. Although incredibly powerful, this only works within the virtual space she has created and helped grow. While making her almost godly in her own territory, it greatly limits her capabilities for combat outside, like a sailor on solid land after years at sea.

Much of her remaining powers specialize in the application of sound. Be it sonic shockwaves that rupture organs or pure noise that overwhelms the senses. She is currently coaching Nerissa in her sonic based powers as well in order to develop them better, as Nerissa has been struggling to control her borders. The core difference between the two is raw volume and controlled sound. 

##Angelic Heavens of Amane

![Amane Kanata](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/4/4f/Amane_Kanata_3D_Model_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20230630034518)

###Leader: Amane Kanata

*Size: 34’000 km2*

*Population: 5.58 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 56*

*Capital: Hanoseushi*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The lands the Angelic Heavens occupy are the tallest known mountains in the world, with the portion inhabited by Kanata being the coldest and tallest part of them all. Known as the Dragon Spine mountains, they are to all extents and purposes uninhabitable. It is dark and stormy, blanketed with snow all year round. 

To escape this unlivable landscape, the people of the Angelic Heavens were lifted above by Kanata and built their civilization within the clouds. Kanata raised the first sky palace in the year of her nation’s founding, and has since raised many more. These fortifications have been added onto over the years, becoming towering floating islands of tethered pieces of stolen land and extra buildings built up to support a growing population. 

All habitations are built with defense in mind. The means to produce these floating settlements is known only to Kanata, who sacrificed much of her wingspan in order to do so. They are hard to make, and harder to replace, so growth in this country is slow. 

Life at such a high altitude is not without its extremes. The oxygen is very thin, necessitating acclimation for visitors who are forced to wear oxygen masks. Most citizens of the country are quite heavily tanned, and many develop skin cancer. The altitude also presents a constant issue of freezing, so heavy clothing is a necessity. There is also of course the issue of falling. This is circumvented by gliders to travel between settlements, small planes, and even personal aerial devices such as pedaled gyrocopters. 

Water is collected in rain barrels which are lowered to cloud levels via lengthy chains to accumulate precipitation. Because food must be grown to be produced as no natural plant or animal life exists at this altitude beyond the occasional high-flying bird, all citizens are expected to farm plots of their own land. The people of this land exist in a semi-serfdom state as a result. 

The entire northern border of the Angelic Heavens borders the fog, so monster attacks are a constant problem. It is believed that of all border states, they receive some of the most frequent monster attacks due to the ground being untamed. To the east is Okayu, southeast Korone, south Pekora, southwest Flare, and west Coco. A very small passage exists in the northwest corridor to Towa’s lands, and has traditionally been a sight of many battles between these two opposite demigods.

###Flag
A horizontal triband of blue, white, and blue. The white band is quadruple the size of the white bands. Two smaller black bands border the white band on the left and right. In the center is the halo of Kanata outlined in dark yellow. 

###General Overview 
The Angelic Heavens are a curious land full of hardworking, kindly people that live hard lives for the betterment of all. They are born into a difficult land and expected to work or fight until the day they die, all while being a moral example to others. The term Heimin is often used to refer to the citizens of the Angelic Heavens.

One would expect this to be the description of a dictatorship. The truth is as far from this as possible. Kanata and her Blessed rule the floating sky islands and castles of the Heavens acting not only as a vanguard for other countries and a first line of defense, but also as a bastion of good and proper moral behavior. The best way to describe the Angelic Heavens is a judicial “moralocracy”. 

The meaning of moralocracy, as defined by Kanata herself, is a society ruled by good behavior solely. Laws are enforced around innate goodness in the human spirit and behavior, not necessarily legal specifics. Judges, the highest authority in the land, are expected to make calls not based on prior precedent but by morality and by what they deem to be best in advancing the goodness of the community and person. Theft for the sake of feeding a hungry child may well be forgiven, but excessive rudeness may be punished. Kanata sits as the head of the supreme angelic court, the highest authority in the land. 

The Angelic Heavens receive constant monster attacks from flying enemies on a near daily basis. All members of the nation are expected to serve in some capacity. From twelve to sixty-eight, all citizens are members of the militia and expected to defend their settlements in whatever means necessary. Those wishing to join the military proper become one of the Angel Guard.

The Angel Guard, made up of Blessed and volunteers alike, are the highly trained and disciplined sky knights of Kanta’s land. With mechanical (or real in the Blessed’s case) they soar through the air with crossbow and sword, acting as the first line of defense for not just the country but many nations as well. The Angelic Heavens suffers the brunt of monster attacks that pour down from the fog in the north so those to the south do not suffer. 

When Kanata raised her people aloft, she did so with the expectation they would be a force of good, righteousness through adversity, kindness through hardships. She often emphasizes the heavy burden they bear so that others in the lands below may not suffer. An incredible respect is given to this nation by the others, (save for Towa, her rival) who often pour gifts galore to the inhabitants of this country. 

It is Kanata’s goal that in time they may scour away the fog and return to conquer the lands below. This goal, lofty as their nation, is quite far away from reality. For now, the Angelic Heavens are held together by a communion of good faith and upright morals which earns them the respect of other nations and demigods. 

###Blessed
Kanata’s Blessed are often referred to as angels, and for very good reasons. Upon becoming Blessed, they sprout wings from their back, and a halo as well, with four points like Kanata. They serve as the generals and judges of her army in equal measure, and are so willing to risk their lives for the cause that many have fallen in the line of duty.

Only those who display the most genuine and honest moral fiber become Blessed. Their devotion to not just Kanata but to her beliefs must be as fanatical as possible. These are the kinds of people who would donate every last coin to a homeless person, who would volunteer at a senior center every day off, who would never be rude or unkind under any circumstances. They know they must set a good example, because if they do not and faith wanes in Kanata, the entire nation will fall apart. 

###Leader Description 
Amane Kanata is an angel. She has a very firm and poignant approach to humanity, and that is that they are beings of ultimate goodness. She has also resolved to strive to bring out the best in human behavior through whatever means necessary, often acting as a moral example.

She has sacrificed much for her land. To lift them from the ground, she destroyed much of her wingspan, limiting her flight capabilities. In battle with a monster, she suffered intense sonic damage which is gradually making her go deaf. Day and night she studies healing skills to better aid the sick.

This does not mean she is meek, however. Kanata is quite infamous for a personality that does not necessarily follow her actions. She can be very crass and loud when she needs to be, and has more than once used “percussive therapy” to solve issues in her ranks that words were not fixing. Still, her sacrifices and diligence ensure her populace remain loyal. Without her, none would be alive.

Coco was great friends with Kanata. After her departure, Kanata became notably less energetic than before, deeply missing her presence. Her rivalry with Towa, her antithetical opposite, is also well known. The two frequently clash, with both nations built on the concepts of good and evil respectively. 

###Leader Powers 
Kanata as an angel is not just limited to flight. Her powers rely on the manipulation of light for both offense and defense. She is just as capable of adjusting the wavelengths of her soldiers to make them invisible as she is firing massive bursts of light rays to disintegrate her foes.

In her spare time, she researches medicine and healing magics to better assist her people. Kanata is also quite infamous for her hilariously disproportionate physical strength, leading to her being affectionately referred to as a gorilla instead of an angel. 

##Draconic Khanate of Clan Kiryu

![Kiryu Coco](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/1/10/Kiryu_Coco_3D_Image.png/revision/latest?cb=20210830104805)

###Leader: Clan Kiryu (Formerly Kiryu Coco)

*Size: 31’000 km2*

*Population: 5.04 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 56*

*Capital: Odatsuba*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The Draconic Khanate is one of the most rural nations in the world, with long chains of mountains running straight through the heart of the country. The southern portions have wide open plateaus and grassy steppes, while the north has frosty peaks and untamed wilds. A significant number of rivers begin in the Draconic Khanate from the icy mountains flowing down as meltwater and straight into the sea. 

Approximately 40% of the country lives within the capital Odatsuba, a massive sprawling metropolis, with the rest spread across the country in primarily nomadic camps that eschew a more traditional lifestyle. Once, the Khanate was little more than riders. Not just horses, but dragons as well. Primarily in fact. Wildlife continues to thrive even to this day, and dragon riding is an important tradition in this land. 

There is a sharp cultural divide between the urban and rural, similar to Mumei’s nation, although in this case it is more a divide between tradition and modernity as opposed to the direction of civilization. However, it has yet to devolve into open hostilities, and is more of a soft disagreement. Some simply prefer the comforts of air-conditioned apartments to riding atop a dragon’s back and sleeping under the stars. 

Because the urban centers and urban development as a whole are quite new to the country, it is not as advanced or economically prosperous as its neighbors. This does not bother most, however. The people of this land are long used to living with limited resources. This being said, those in the cities are attempting to attract investors, something the land could use. Coco’s lands are bordered by Towa to the north, Watame to the west, Flare to the south, and Kanata to the east. A mountain pass in the north also connects to the endless fog. 

###Flag
A large left facing black band bordered by two blood red isosceles triangles. The black band has two smaller orange bands running on the left and right side. In the center of the black band is an eight-toothed orange wheel with a pair of orange dragon horns in the center.

###General Overview
The history of the Khanate is tricky. In the beginning, the land was wild and primal. Clans of nomads roamed the countryside, warring and surviving in harmony with nature. Kiryu Coco, the khan of the clan named after her, united the tribes over many years, but kept their traditions strong. Dragons flew freely over the skies, a balance between them and humanity managed by Coco, the largest and fiercest of all dragons.

The first “cities” were large collections of yurts, semi-permanent dwellings. The first true structure was Coco’s famous dragon bone palace at Odasuba, now abandoned but kept in pristine condition. Thanks to the dragons and hardy nature of the people of the khanate, they did not suffer from monsters as much as others, and none dared attack them.

However, the peace did not last. When the six traitors (Holo CN) attempted their ill-fated plot to overthrow Yagoo, it was Coco and Haachama who attempted to halt them. They failed, and Coco was forced to retreat and lick her wounds. She watched on in frustration as her sisters were destroyed, and she blamed herself for the rest of her life.

Coco became more morose and less invested in her land. She attempted to somewhat modernize the country for fears of becoming obsolete, but change was slow, and Coco lacked the drive she once possessed. Even to this day, much of the nation is rural and undeveloped. Eventually, in the year 93, she’d had enough. 

One night, Coco disappeared. She left a note on her throne explaining she’d asked Yagoo to leave the country in peace, but let her subjects live on without her. Nobody saw her depart, save for a single hunter that saw through the clouds a silhouette of a massive dragon climbing higher and higher before disappearing forever.

Clan Kiryu retains control of the country as Coco’s former clan, but without a demigod to watch over them, things are changing. Dragons are becoming wilder and more vicious, as well as rarer without Coco’s supervision. Other clans have begun to challenge Clan Kiryu’s right to rule, arguing they have become weak and decrepit. 

The storm clouds of conflict are beginning to brew. As of now, the Khanate has been in existence without Coco longer than it had her. It remains to be seen if the Draconic Khanate will survive, or break apart into a massive civil war and disintegrate. Amidst this, there are rumors of a seemingly ageless purple-haired swordswoman that wanders the lands. Only rumors of course…

###Blessed
The Blessed of Coco are few now. None have been created since she left this world, and those left are now all seniors. They adopt traits of dragonkind, becoming partially reptilian, and with the ability to shapeshift into a larger and more powerful draconic form. Common traits include horns and long tails. Many eventually live among the dragons, and a few have gone feral without Coco’s guidance. The few Blessed that remain, and it decreases every year, are held in awe by the clans they belong to, and serve as storytellers. Memories to pass on of their beloved, now departed goddess… 

###Leader Description
Kiryu Coco was well known for her fiery and boisterous personality. She would often wake her subjects with a rousing call of “Good morning motherfuckers!”, and was particularly fond of rowdy behavior. Coco was not afraid to use force or example in order to corral behavior from her subjects. This was how she was able to successfully unify the clans as well as tame (to an extent and often with violence) the dragons. 

The morose mood that gripped her in her final years as ruler did not significantly nullify this personality of hers. Her behavior often led to ire from puritans, who proclaimed she was not behaving as a goddess should. Coco’s typical response included a raised middle digit and a thwack from her meaty tail, or, if she was in the mood, simply eating them. 

In the early days before the printing press was widely available in the Khanate, Coco would often deliver the news to her subjects herself. The first television station was her morning AsaCoco news, famous for its quirkiness and troublingly not safe for work content. Coco was famous for not giving a damn what others thought of her, though privately it was rumored she was more sensitive than she seemed. 

###Leader Powers
Kiryu Coco’s powers were both simple yet highly effective. As a massive dragon, she could simply use raw power to bring untold devastation to the lands. In her true form she was the largest of all the demigods, save for Sana of course, also now departed. Although her techniques were crude, they were undeniably effective. Few monsters could last more than a moment under her fiery onslaught. 

##Calliope’s Reaper Underworld

![Mori Calliope](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/virtualyoutuber/images/4/40/Mori_Calliope_3D_Model.png/revision/latest?cb=20220416023257)

###Leader: Mori Calliope

*Size: 30’000 km2*

*Population: 3.58 Million*

*Founding Date: Year 73*

*Capital: Wenbury*

###Geography and Infrastructure
The Reaper Underworld as it is called lies in a blasted wasteland where little life exists. This geographical area is known as the Dying Lands, and covers both her, Shien, and Ollie’s territory as well as the former nations of the deceased powers that surround her. The heat above is extreme in this desert nation, which forces the entire population to live in subterranean dwellings. Temperatures never go below 80 Fahrenheit, and in the summer may reach as hot as 140 on the worst of days. Large piles of dust and ash blanket the surface, which is endlessly grinding all down into nothingness. 

Throughout the entirety of this land, the features above depict the ruins of a past unremembered. For as long as the inhabitants of this country can recall, they have always been there. Pools of tar and canyons that seem to dive down endlessly into the earth. Bones of long extinct gigantic creatures and colossal stone crosses that form the graveyard of seeming giants. Even the ruins of long abandoned cyclopean cities made of obsidian exist. It is difficult to say who lived here before Mori, but they were long gone before she arrived. Or perhaps, she cleared them away to make her domain.

A single river runs through this land, though its waters bestow amnesia on those who drink it, before becoming pure when it touches Kiara’s nation. All water is thus drunk from underground reservoirs, as this is the only place it is pure. Although the cities thrive well enough on their own, only the largest structures of utmost importance poke their heads up onto the surface. Because there are few resources available, the Reaper Underworld often goes a long time without creating new infrastructure, and can seem run down or more impoverished than it actually is. Most cities have a somewhat crumbling or abandoned feel to them, as it is easier to build new dwellings than repair the old ones. 

The surface of the Reaper Underworld is simply too hostile. Not only is there no resources, but monsters swarm the lands as easily as if there was fog covering it. Because Mori’s country borders multiple ruined states, the fog blows in often, and to the south, incursions of zombies from Ollie’s raj occur frequently. 

Only the tough can survive here, and all citizens of the Reaper Underworld are expected to contribute to the defense of their homeland. It is said you are not an adult until you take your first life. Mori borders the former lands of Artia and Rosalyn to the south and southeast, Ollie and Reine to the southwest, a small strip of Kiara to the west, Gamma to the northwest, and Uyu to the northeast.

###General Overview
Although the geography may be among the most hostile of all states, the Reaper Underworld is a successful country with a modern infrastructure and a stable economy. Mori has managed to create a thriving society in what most would consider a death sentence, although her rule is autocratic and with an iron fist. She is the only government. All obey her, or they get the scythe. 

Mori has always seen it as her duty to protect the cycle of life and death, specifically the latter function. To this end, Mori has always been vehement in purging the lands of the undead and those who would avoid the cycle of death. Within less than five years of her state’s creation, the destruction of the traitorous six states (Holo CN) and the ruination of their lands led to her proclaiming a crusade of death. The citizens of the Reaper Underworld have supported her in this endeavor ever since. 

Little by little, she has been chipping away at the lands once inhabited by Artia and Rosalyn. She has successfully reclaimed some territory, but it is minor. The process is expected to take centuries. She is also engaged in a perpetual war with Ollie that seems to be an endless stalemate of attrition. Some would argue that Ollie could win as her numbers are limitless if she actually cared, but nobody is bold enough to suggest this to Mori.

Because the Reaper Underworld has more limited resources, this has led to the inhabitants becoming tough and very “urban” as it were. Short tempered and rough around the edges, they are used to having to fight to defend their homes from monsters. A large rap culture has also developed in this country, one which Mori herself supports and engages in. 

The worship of the Grim Reaper does occur in this state, one of the few religions outside of the church of Yagoo. As Mori is the apprentice of death, it stands to reason to these individuals that a death deity should exist. The worship of the reaper in fact overpowers Yagoo in this state by popularity. This once led to a puritan onslaught who accused Mori of heresy. However, after a shocking display of violence and slaughter by Mori who massacred the puritans with little regard, they have kept away.

Because the Reaper Underworld is in a constant state of conflict, all individuals are expected to serve militarily. This is combined with an attitude of unity through adversity that makes the people of this land tough it out through the bad times to get to the few good times. Their rough mannerisms however have landed them no friends, save for Kiara who has been rebuffed. They would prefer to get things done themselves so as not to shoulder the burden of their task on others, although they also don’t want anyone to mess things up. 

Although a technical military superpower, the endless fighting has resulted in Mori not becoming a global superpower. Her ultimate goal is to cleanse the lands of her lost siblings of the fog and monsters that dominate them, and after that, some whisper, she may turn on her own living siblings as well. For are not immortal demigods in breach of the cycle?

Still, Mori has rebuffed this. Except for Ollie. She hates Ollie. Kiara too if she can find a way to keep her dead. Only time will tell. 

###Blessed
Those who are Blessed of Mori will lose all of their skin, having it slough off literally overnight and becoming living skeletons. Ironic as it is to have the Blessed of a demigoddess who loathes the undead be the undead, she has come to appreciate them, albeit reluctantly. Her annoyance has given rise to the term “Deadbeat” which has been adopted en masse by them. They share Mori’s personality for many things, as well as enthusiasms, which often means they have a serious almost punk-esque attitude to things. They follow Mori regardless of whatever she wishes, sometimes grumbling but never refusing. 

###Leader Description
Mori Calliope, the reaper’s apprentice herself, is cool and serious individual who claims to be the apprentice of death. She is also quite relaxed, and rarely loses her demeanor. Mori has no tolerance for dissent in her ranks or troublemaking, and is frequently known to kill those that annoy her with her scythe. This lack of regard for life is generally believed to be because of her philosophy on mortality, that being it is inevitable, and life is both fleeting and one speck between twin eternities of nonexistence. 

Mori’s job is to make sure death functions correctly. This means that in addition to purging monsters and undead from her lands, which are extremely common, she also makes sure that things stay dead. Necromancy is highly illegal in the Reaper Underworld, and she loathes any form of unlife association. It is rumored that when Rushia passed, she celebrated for a week. Those who prolong their life through unnatural means also irritate her.

A state of constant war has existed between her and Ollie since the zombie’s descent into undeath, seeing it as her duty to end her unlife. It is unlikely this will end until one of the two ultimately claims final victory and destroys the other. She also rather despises Rio, Mel, and quite a number of others for similar reasons. Because of this, Mori’s relationship with many of the other demigods is chilly, famously loathing Kiara for her inability to die. Some say she has a sweet side, but it is very well buried if this is the case.

###Leader Powers
As Mori embodies death, it is no surprise that she wields magic related to death. Aside from casting spells that kill very easily, her obsidian scythe in particular is a lethally effective weapon. This is because the scythe is capable of killing with a single blow, flawlessly, every time. All it takes is the tiniest cut to end a life, quite literally severing the soul from the body and sending them to the afterlife. As the scythe cuts through everything, it is perhaps the most dangerous weapon in the world, because there is absolutely no defense against it. The other demigods are always respectful around Mori as a result.
