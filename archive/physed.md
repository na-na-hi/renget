### Episode 1 - Physical Education
https://rentry.co/8ykct
***Synopsis:***
Every high school had that one teacher that was a bully. One that everyone hated. The one that people heard horror stories of through the grape vine. When Bryce finally became a senior, he got to meet the one that was whispered about, the infamous lynx that had it out for any and every student. Problem was, the poor human was smitten. That toned body. Muscular frame. Best of all, those broad feet that he couldn't keep his eyes off of. Though he never got to see them bare, his mind always fantasized about the big paws hidden away. Good thing he ended up meeting a naughty camgirl that had no problem selling him her used socks and shoes to satisfy his urges. Filled with hormonal lust, he dove into the deviancy that revolved around paws and everything about them. Though the socks were sold by some stranger on the internet, Bryce constantly imagined that they belonged to the intimating lynx. It was a hot fantasy, but it could never come true.
Right?


### Episode 2 -  Testing the Equipment

***Synopsis:***
High school was supposed to be full of fun. Getting your first car, first girlfriend, home coming, prom, football games, pep rallies, at least that's what Bryce had hoped for. Instead, he was pulled into surreptitious "relationship" with his gym teacher, after he had discovered about her separate life as a cam model that earned an extra income by selling her used footwear and teasing perverts with her over-sized paws through the help of a webcam, which earned him a few death threats from the teacher, along with some unexpected private time with her immaculate paws. This was only a week ago and already things had been far from normal. The human had been beating himself up and heavy-headed with remorse and longing for the lynx who had been giving him the cold shoulder ever since. Maybe it was time for him to move on? Should he confront her? Hmm, though the cute canine she had started to tutor was looking good as well. The real question about that though, is would Ms. Holt approve?

### Episode 3 - Detention

 ***Synopsis:***
With another day of school over with, Bryce could only excitedly sit at his computer, eagerly awaiting a message from the big pawed, aggressive, dominating lynx that he called a gym teacher. It wasn't easy sitting at his desk with a set of bruised balls, courtesy of Ms. Holt, but what would follow would certainly be worth it. Wouldn't it? Sure, they'd "made up" that day, but would things stay like this? It couldn't be easy for a teacher to juggle such an odd relationship, hide it, and continue keeping up appearances at the school. At least she promised to send him another pair of shoes to tide him over, until their next encounter. It shouldn't take long to arrive? Right? Hmm, it'd been nearly two weeks and still nothing. Bryce was getting far too pent up to keep a clear head. Let's just hope he doesn't do anything stupid! Wait a minute, what's the title of this story? Uh oh.

### Episode 4 - Piss Poor Performance

***Synopsis:***
As the school year continues, the weather starts to turn. Instead of the pleasantly warm days of fall, the class now had to deal with the ongoing briskness of autumn and winter. Of course, this isn't going to change gym class too much as having class inside was still a rare luxury. At least, most of the class. One particular student had been invited to meet the teacher in one of the scarcely used rooms after class. Does anyone really expect Bryce to decline such a proposal? Expecting the usual sessions of the lynx's abuse and footplay, he's caught off guard at the sight of a wrestling mat and an unusual offer.

### Episode 5 - Line Dive
https://rentry.co/9oyen
***Synopsis:***
After an incident over the weekend, Bryce and the others start to take notice of a shift in their teacher's demeanor. Rather than her usual aggressive barks and orders, Ms. Holt seems distant and forlorn. Expecting the worst, Bryce checks in with her after class to get the news. Will she still be around to teach or could this be the last time he sees her?
