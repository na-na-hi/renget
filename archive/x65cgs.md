#A Speciality in Bitterness

Ray Sisuto; "Bloodline Actor." A man of many talents, but like many other Tokubetsu Jōnin, he had a speciality. Kekkai genkai! Unfortunately, having kekkai genkai as your speciality is not very fun. This is because the majority of time is not spent tutoring genin on their kekkai genkai; no, their clans are all worried about their "secrets", like they aren't under the same village. Ray always hated that. Those old men need to get the sticks up their collective old man behinds removed. He had WORK to do. Anyway, what he was usually stuck with... was geanology. Every clan in Konoha, he was stuck with recording. You would think "but there's only so many clans, right?" 
WRONG.
Ray HAD to open his big mouth once. He offhandedly mentioned "I hope this clan wasn't one of those who always married off their kids... kekkai genkai gets spread out a lot more that way!" and the next thing you know, he was recording each clan's history! And it's not like he can check any records or anything. He has to go to EVERY clan leader and chat up a storm with them. THEN he has to go check out their graveyards and other memorials. Not only that, but he's still a ninja! A jōnin, even! It's no wonder that Ray has resentment towards all of those clans...

"You wanted to see me, Lord Third!?"
"Yes, Ray. I have a request for you."

Ray had plenty of respect for the Hokage. He was probably the person he respected most, period. Part of him admired the Hokage for his hard work. Another part of him related to the Hokage, because he also hated paper work. He also had a suspicion that the Hokage harbored resentment towards the village elders, just like him! The last, worst part of Ray admired the Hokage because he was the strongest. And not just the strongest, the strongest with (as far as he knew) NO kekkai genkai! He would never tell anyone that, though.

As Ray set his posture (usually terrible due to hunching over while he does his usual work) perfectly, Ray focused and prepared himself for anything!

"Anything at all, Lord Third!"
"You sure? You're not gonna like it."
"Yes, Lord Third!"
"I have a special mission, just for you. Y'see, we just had visitors from Suna. During our talks, your work came up."
"SAY NO MORE, LORD THIRD! I already know what it will be! As you may know, I am an EXPERT in Mud Style, and specifically the type anyone can learn!"
"Ray, wait-"
"Suna, as you may know, is surrounded by sand! Sand is one of the least compatible materials for mud! However, with an expert like me, I can teach them how to use Mud Style perfectly! I am HONORED to be of crucial importance for our Konoha-Suna relations! I will not fail you, Lord Third!"

Ray was ecstatic! He finally got a mission, and of such importance! There were no finer Mud Style experts in Konoha! Other than kekkai genkai Mud Style... but that's not the point! He comes closer than anyone to replicating kekkai genkai Mud Style! This is what he was waiting for!

Inatsu's eyes had glazed over, but now he was coming back to his senses. It was probably just Ray's imagination, but it almost looked like he was pitying him for a moment.

"...Ray, that's not it. It's about your other work."
"Ah, then it must be Paper Style! I am-"
"Shut it! Would you just listen for a moment?"
"S-Sorry, Lord Third."
"It's about... what do you call it? 'Geanology?'"
"What... what about it, Lord Third?"
"Yes, one of the village elders brought up your work when talking to the visitors from Suna. They're interested."
"Oh."
"Yes, I am sending you out to Suna. You are going to spend some time with them. Specifically, their clans."
"And, I am going to record their family members?"
"Yes, Ray. They expect great things. They want your work to be of the highest quality. You are allowed to stay in Suna for as long as you need, for you to record their clans."
"But... I haven't even finished here..."
"They only need a 'rough outline.' They said that you only need to provide a rough list of important members for each and every clan, and provide a detailed list of any marriages between any clan that were lost."
"Will... do I get to see their kekkai genkai in action?"
"No."
"I-I see. Well, if you- if you excuse me for a moment... I need a second."
"Hurry up, Ray."

Ray took a moment to step outside. A few seconds of muffled screaming later, and he stepped back in Inatsu's office.

"I fully accept this mission, Lord Third. I will not disappoint."
"Look on the bright side, Ray. You *are* an important aspect of Konoha-Suna relations, after all!"
"Yes, Lord Third."

Ray stared at the mountain of papers on Inatsu's desk. He planned on submitting paper work for a "Geanology Team." Now he really wanted to. Inatsu had a worried look.

"Do you need to submit something?"
"...No, Lord Third. Everything is fine."
"Well, I need to get back to my work. I'll be seeing you, Ray."
"Yeah. Got it, Lord Third."

Ray's hopes were... thoroughly crushed.

Ray was at his favorite ramen vendor. It was cheap, but it was good. He always requested it to be as hot as possible. This was actually quite smart! If anyone asked him to actually finish his work and stop his lunch break, he could reply "But I'm waiting for it to cool off!"

Ray was staring at his ramen bowl. He wasn't hungry. The ramen was simply his favorite memory from Konoha, and he wanted to memorize it before he left.

"Whaddaya know! It's Ray!"

Ray turned to loud and energetic voice behind him, and it was Taiki. He was a good guy, even if he had a kekkai genkai. They both had a distaste for the village elders. Or, at least, Ray thought they did.

"Hey, Taiki. I-I'm getting back to work soon... I'm waiting for it to cool off..."
"But, it's night! Shouldn't you be done? I thought you worked only during the day!"
"I work during the night and day, Taiki."
"When do you sleep?"
"On my day off."
"Shucks, that sucks!"

Taiki sat down on a stool right next to Ray. It creaked. These stools don't creak when Ray sits on them. In fact, he sat one of the logs he carries around on a stool as well. It didn't creak, either.

"I'll have... uh..."
"I think you'll like the Pork Bowl."
"Sure, Ray! You eat here all the time, right? I'll be sure to trust your opinion on this!"
"Happy to be of service."

Taiki had stopped the conversation between them, because he was drinking his entire bowl. He finished, after about 30 seconds.

"So, how's it going? I'm still waiting for my genin registration."
"I'm gonna be leaving Konoha for Suna, actually."
"WHAT?! But- but... that would make you a Missing Nin! And a traitor!"
"What? No, I'm leaving on a mission. I'm going to do my geanology work over there for some time, on Lord Third's request."
"Woah, a request from the Hokage? Lucky!"

Taiki leaned in close, as if to whisper. He talked in normal volume, anyway.

"Y'know... I don't think he likes me much."
"Really? I wonder why."
"Yeah, I wish I could get a mission straight from him. Some people have all the luck!"

Ray liked Taiki considerably less after that conversation. He knew it was unfair to dislike him for that. He really hadn't done anything wrong. But he still disliked him.
***
Today was the day! The day Ray was leaving Konoha for his mission at Suna! The day right after he was even told about the mission! 

...Ray forgot about his plants. Ray had no dog, no cat, not even a fish... but he had plants. He couldn't just let them die. No, he had a duty! He was the caretaker of those plants, and he was going to take care of those plants! But... he couldn't while he was away. Where would Ray ever find a caretaker for his plants? That's right, Sarurata! Wait. That's a bad idea. Sarurata... can't be trusted with such an important task. Also, it would break his poor heart when he failed to take care of the plants... if he even realized that they died. He had to find someone else.

Ray had *one* more job. Yep, even though his kekkai genkai tutoring was disliked... it was there. He had done it before, and he had students! He hardly never gets to see them... but just this once, he would need to pull some strings! He could only gather some genin on short notice... but he could! No matter who!
***
"I'm sure you all know why you are here."

That weird bug kid, Zeiji, was the one who spoke up.

"I... I don't think anyone does, Ray-Sensei."

There were only a couple genin Ray could grab. He snagged Ikari's team on their way to something that wasn't important (even though Eisei was never his student, he was grabbed anyway), that poor Kazuo kid, and that weird Zeiji kid.

"Really? I thought I told you? That was my fault, forgive me! Anyway! I have a very special discipline training for all of you! This training exercise will test many things! Teamwork, patience, trustworthiness... this AND more will be tested!"

That little artsy brat, Takatsui, spoke up.

"Can you hurry up? My team is supposed to be somewhere. I don't think I'm going to be able to do it right now, anyway."
"Of course, Takatsui-san! How observant of you! Yes, you will not be doing it right now. I would like all of you to formulate a plan!"

Ray didn't like Takatsui. He didn't like most of the kids he tutored. He considered them all spoiled rotten. Except Kazuo. He felt bad for Kazuo. Anyway, it's not like he could just tell them his distaste straight to their face. So, he was always being nicer to them then he was to everyone else (who wasn't Inatsu). He hoped that, if they were smart enough, they would catch on to his sarcasm. He also hoped they would *never* catch on, so he could silently mock their stupidity.

That cold kid, Suzura, blinked a couple times. She didn't say anything... but she blinked, more than usual. Ray hoped that didn't mean anything.

"I need you all to put your brilliant minds together and come up with a schedule! Yes, a schedule for watering my dear potted plants!"

The armless kid, Kazuo, spoke up. Ray already knew what he was going to say.

"Ray-Sensei... I don't have arms."
"That's true! But I trust you can come up with something!"

After some chatter among the kids (and a few groans), they all left. Ray would trust them to actually water his plants, and not just leave them to wilt like the good-for-nothings (he thought) they were! He could at least trust... Eisei, he thinks his name was? Good ol' normal Eisei. He hadn't gotten around to the Hokan clan. Yet.
***
Ray had a little more time on his hands, so he went back to his favorite vendor for one last bowl of ramen. One he would actually enjoy, without getting it as hot as possible! Or so he thought...

"It's good to see you, Ray."

Ray turned to see one of his least favorite people, Hakumo Ikari. Cordial as always, he would never tell anyone about who he disliked. He hoped to give off the impression that he didn't *not* like anyone! But Ikari knew. And he knew she knew. And she knew that he knew that she knew. They are both the same type of person, after all. Think one thing, and say another. Or, that was the grasp he had on Ikari. They knew each other well. With a clan as large as the Hakumo, he met with her and some of the elders to discuss their history quite a few times. He has uncovered two children born out of wedlock that were unknown to the Hakumo already! This caused a couple issues for the Hakumo. They weren't exactly upset, but the non-Hakumo wives to the men who fathered the children were. He had a hunch about a third, but he was keeping that to himself.

"Oh, Ikari! What a surprise! You sure are good at sneaking up on people."

Like always, Ikari didn't speak to Ray until she was in a position that meant she was already there for quite some time. Sitting at the seat right next to Ray, and she got there at some point after Ray had sat down. Or... he thinks.

"I would like to talk to you about my genin."
"Oh, them? What?"
"You... disrupted the errand I sent them on."
"Did I? Welp, I admit it. I had to ask them about something. I really am sorry. Is there anyway I could make it up to you?"
"It was about your plants, wasn't it? That's alright; I'm sure they are very important to you. I ask nothing of you, other than that you let me know if you require them first, next time."
"Will do! Thanks for considering my plants, as well. Did your little friend enjoy them?"

THERE! He saw it! The ever so slight movement of the eye! He just told Ikari something that SURPRISED her! That's right; he knew that Ikari had sent a fox to follow them! He didn't even see it, but he knew! Those Hakumo always send a fox, and he *knew* Ikari would to follow her precious genin on an errand she sent them on. Ikari didn't expect that! Even if she doesn't show it very well, she was surpised! It's the little victories that count. And she knew that he knew.

"Well done, Ray! I didn't think you would notice her. I guess you really are quite the capable ninja after all!"
"Heh! Was there any doubt I wasn't?"
"You're right, my mistake. None at all."

Ikari glanced at her shoulder for a moment, and then looked back at Ray.

"Well... I suppose I should be going now. Have a nice meal, Ray."

But instead of eating his meal, something was eating Ray. He felt like there was one more thing he needed to tell Ikari.

"...Hey, Ikari? One more thing."
"Yes?"
"Your genin... they remind me of me."
"Oh, do they, now?"
"Yep. I don't like it. You remember me from the academy, right? I was a real slacker, back then... and they may not be slackers *yet*, but they have some of the same qualities I did! Make sure they grow out of it!"
"...Sure, Ray."

Welp, Ray did it! He said what he needed to say! And he could enjoy his final bowl of Konoha Ramen for a whil-
Wait.
It was too hot, and now he was going to have to wait for it to cool off.
Ikari was long gone, but he knew she did it. He knows a lot about the Hakumo. They love pranks... and fire is common among them.

"Paper Style: Ice Imitation Heat Shield Justu!"

A pretty little parasol made of blue paper appeared in Ray's hand, and he promptly handed it to the old lady he was talking to on the street corner.

"You Konoha boys are such gentlemen! As I was saying, my father had seven brothers..."

Ray scribbled away in the notebook he had in his hand. There were plenty of old people in Suna, and he was going to "enjoy" a chat with each and every one of of them.
