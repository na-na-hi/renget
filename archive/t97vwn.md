The early autumn breeze gently rustled the ginkgo leaves overhead as Inigo paced outside Kyoto Station. Despite the chill hinting at winter's approach, the late September sun still provided ample warmth as it peeked through the brilliant golden foliage. Inigo breathed in the mingled scents of roasted sweet potatoes and freshly brewed matcha that drifted from nearby food stalls. He watched as locals bundled in cozy scarves chatted and sipped from paper cups as they emerged from the station.

Nearby, a street musician played a cheerful melody on his shamisen, the traditional sounds blending with the city commotion. Inigo hummed along, finding the tune soothed his nerves as he awaited Hoge's arrival. His miniature green dragon, Gigan, mewed happily from his shoulder.

Inigo paused his pacing and smiled as he watched young children in tiny hakama robes laughing and playing with sparklers, likely on their way to visit a shrine with their families. Despite his anxiousness, Inigo felt a wave of fondness for this town. Even after all his travels, Kyoto in autumn remained one of his favorite places to be. Inigo brushed his forest green "Save the Boars" t-shirt and dark blue jeans, he had ultimately opted for casual clothes over his signature suit and tie to help them avoid standing out. 

"Glad you'll be with me," Inigo said. "Don't let me psyche myself out, okay buddy?" Gigan squeaked in confirmation and Inigo scratched the dragon's ear.  Gigan mewed happily in response. Inigo checked the time on his phone again. Still, 10 minutes until Hoge was set to arrive. He tried not to obsess over the idea of getting stood up, focusing instead on watching the trains glide smoothly in and out of the station. He turned to his phone again.

Inigo spotted a familiar blurred figure approaching in an adorable white-gray frilly top and flowing brown skirt. His anxious nonsense thoughts vanished, replaced by awe at how incredibly cute his date looked.

"Hoge-chan! Over here!" Inigo yelled out eagerly, waving both arms overhead. A group of tourists turned to see what he was waving at but their eyes went through Hoge.

She offered a small wave in return as she reached him. "Apologies if you waited long," she said with a small bow. 

Inigo shook his head rapidly. "Nope, not at all! You're right on time." 

He grinned goofily."You look really pretty. Like, wow." Smooth, doofus, he scolded himself.

Hoge flushed, the barest hint of a smile touching her lips. "The twins aided in selecting an appropriate outfit," she explained. "I wished to...make an effort." Inigo beamed. He has to remember to get those blessed twins the best thank-you gifts later.

"Well you nailed it!" he said enthusiastically. "Seriously, you're the cutest girl I've ever seen. I'm the luckiest guy here."

Hoge's blurred and her blush deepened as she glanced aside, caught somewhere between flattery and embarrassment. Inigo decided to spare her any further gushing. "Shall we head in?" he asked, offering his hand with an exaggerated formal flair.

Hoge shook her head indulgently but took his hand without protest as they walked towards the ticket machines.

“Ini, you never told me where we're going,” Hoge asked as Inigo punched in their tickets into a display.

"Oh yeah!” Inigo scanned his phone on the machine and two tickets popped up. “Tada! We’re going to Nagoya today! To the Churaumi Aquarium and Rescue. It’s gonna be awesome -and there’s a little surprise coming!" He held up the two tickets and grinned.

***
As the train sped towards Nagoya, Inigo couldn't take his eyes off Hoge. Her hair shone in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window, and her soft lips were turned up in a hint of a smile as she gazed out at the passing scenery. 

To pass the time, they were both locked in a game of Shiritori. 

"Shirikageru. (Silica Gel)"

"Eh? Another Ru. You're not playing fair. And here I was going easy on you since it's our first time."

Hoge lifted her chin. "I require no special treatment. I have never lost at this game."

"Oho, confident! Fine, fine." Inigo rubbed his hands together. "Rubicongo Inko! (Congo Parrot)"

"Inkouzume. (Incisor)" she replied, her confidence unshaken.

 "Mezasu. (Aim)"

"Suugaku. (Mathematics)" 

 "Kuuko. (Airport)"

"Kokoro. (Heart)"

The pace quickly intensified as they volleyed faster and harder words back and forth. Inigo racked his brain, determined not to mess up before Hoge did.

He furrowed his brow. "Suki. (fondness)"

Hoge's eyes flashed.  "Kikaho. (equator)"

Inigo paused, stumped. "Uh...Honma. (truth)" he tried weakly.

"You said that earlier," Hoge said matter-of-factly.

"Eh! Then- Ho-kkaido. (northernmost island of Japan)!"

"You said that earlier too."

"Ugh- c'mon I had the perfect attack word right after."

 "Fufufu- I believe that means I am victorious," Hoge said with a sly smile.

Inigo smirked, "Hmm, okay. - what about-" He lifted the divider between their train seats and pulled her close into a side hug. He grinned as she didn't pull away, and he leaned close.

"Wah!"

"Ho-ge." He whispered into her ear, as her cheeks turned pink. Unable to resist any longer, Inigo slowly leaned in. Hoge's eyes fluttered shut as their lips met in a kiss.

"Gendai. (modern)" she said quietly when they broke the kiss.

"Really? You're still trying to win?"

"Yes."

 "Dai- daisuki, (I really like you)" Inigo said grinning from ear to ear.

"That's not the right syllable," she said accusingly.

"You got me. I guess I'm no match for the Shiritori queen," he shrugged.

"Sateioubu," Hoge replied loftily, looking incredibly smug about her win.

"I'm definitely gonna train super hard before our rematch," Inigo warned playfully. "So you better brace yourself!"

"Ganbarimasu," Hoge said, lifting her chin. Her eyes shone happily behind her glasses. Inigo grinned back, not even mad about losing. Hoge's competitive side was adorable. And he'd succeeded in his real goal - helping her relax on the way to Nagoya. Hoge snuggled against Inigo's shoulder. He wrapped an arm around her, marveling at his luck. The rest of the train ride flew by in a blissful haze of whispered words and stolen kisses.

###Chapter 2: Nagoya Churaumi Aquarium and Rescue
Inigo and Hoge stood together in an empty parking lot a building away from the Nagoya Churaumi Aquarium and Rescue. “Are they coming?” Hoge said warily, her outline twisted and wavered as she instinctively crouched a few feet behind him. 

“Should be any minute now,” Inigo said reassuringly. Right on cue, a sleek limousine pulled up to the curb. Inigo waved eagerly as the back door opened and a small girl with blueish white hair and red eyes peeked out.

"Eri!" Inigo cheered. The girl's face lit up. "Inigo-oniichan." She scrambled out of the limo and rushed to hug him around the waist.

Inigo laughed and swung the little girl up into his arms. "I've missed you, kiddo! Look how big you've gotten!" Gigan hovered over the little girl and nuzzled her cheek.

 It's been nearly half a year since Inigo and Hoge rescued Eri from villains. Although she barely smiled or laugh like a normal little girl, Inigo was thrilled to see the shy girl looking healthy and carefree. Two stern-faced men in black suits stepped out of the limo and nodded to Inigo. He returned the gesture - even without the telltale tattoos, he could recognize fellow yakuza.

Lastly, a tall, thin man with a red-and-gold plague doctor mask over his mouth exited the vehicle. This was the infamous underboss, Overhaul, who the Shie Hassaikai clan adopted into their family a few years back. 

"Thank you for taking Eri today," Overhaul said formally. "I know she's been eagerly awaiting this trip."

Inigo set Eri down and smiled at the imposing man. "Thanks for letting her come along! Hoge and I have been really looking forward to spending time with our favorite girl."

Right on cue, Hoge emerged from her quirk. The bodyguards visibly tensed as she appeared and Inigo could almost see an amused smile on her face. 

"Nyoro-néh-chan!" Eri cried happily, dashing over to hug the older girl. 

A tiny smile crossed Hoge's face as she returned the enthusiastic embrace. "Hello Eri. I'm glad you could make it today."

Overhaul checked his watch. "I'm afraid I have business to attend to. You two enjoy yourselves with Eri." He turned to leave but paused, placing a hand on Eri's shoulder. "Remember what I said about using your quirk," he murmured just loud enough for Inigo to overhear with his quirk. Inigo's brow furrowed slightly but he hid his concern behind a smile as Eri nodded obediently.

After Overhaul left, Eri immediately perked up and grabbed one of each of her caretaker's hands. "Let's go, let's go! I wanna see the fishies!"

Inigo and Hoge exchanged amused looks over the little girl's head as she dragged them towards the ticket counter. Inigo paid for their admission despite Hoge's protests. "I invited you both, so it's my treat!" he insisted. Inside the massive lobby, Eri's eyes went wide at the towering model of a white narwhale suspended from the ceiling. Inigo hoisted the awe-struck girl up onto his shoulders so she could get a better view.

"It has a horn just like me. It's so big and beautiful! " Eri exclaimed. "Does it live here?"

Hoge shook her head. "No, that's just a model. But perhaps we'll get to see a real one today."

After grabbing a map, they made their way towards the indoor exhibits. Inigo paused to let Eri meet the aquarium's mascot, a pink dolphin with a cowboy hat, he shook hands with the mascot's flipper which got him an amused look from Hoge. Grinning and laughing at colorful ocean displays, their little party headed through the double doors into the first cavernous hall. Eri's mouth fell open at the sight of the towering kelp forest tanks, teeming with schools of shimmering fish.

"Wow!" she cried. "Hoge-nee, Inigo-oniichan, look look!" She dashed back and forth between exhibits, pressing her nose against each tank and ooh-ing at the residents inside. Inigo had to gently steer her away from climbing the acrylic walls in her eagerness to get closer.

Hoge followed more sedately, though Inigo could tell she was secretly just as delighted by Eri's infectious joy. She shared facts about each bizarre creature they passed, igniting curiosity in Eri's gaze, who hung on to Hoge’s every word. Inigo mostly just basked in the glow of seeing his two favorite girls getting along so well. Hoge's rare smiles and quiet laughter made his heart do flips, and Eri's nonstop gasps of wonder were utterly endearing. Together the three of them stood out as a bright spot of sunshine and cheer amid the subdued crowds.

As they turned a corner, Inigo noticed a giant statue of a grinning dolphin perched atop a massive beach ball. His eyes lit up.

"Photo time!" he declared, sweeping up both girls under his arms. Hoge scowled and tried to squirm away, but Inigo just laughed. "C'mon, we need to commemorate our special day together!" He used his height advantage to maneuver them into position in front of the statue, holding out his phone. "Say cheese!"

After snapping a series of photos featuring Eri's large eyes, Inigo's exaggerated grin, and Hoge's amused smile, they continued on their way. Inigo scrolled through the pictures happily. He knew it was risky saving evidence of their not-allowed-date, but he couldn't bring himself to care. Today was already becoming one of the best days ever, and he wanted to be able to look back fondly on these memories.

###Chapter 3: Aquarium Exhibits
As they walk, there is the sudden crackle of speakers and a clear, crisp voice announcing that the seal feeding will take place in five minutes. Inigo immediately freezes and whips around, staring at Hoge with a pleading look on his face.

“Ini..” Hoge sighs. “We have to!” Inigo says excitedly, but Hoge pursed her lips uncertainly.

"I don't know..." He brings Hoge’s hand up to his lips and kisses her knuckle. “Please?” he adds. Hoge’s stomach flutters and she knows that Inigo’s won. She’s already resigned herself to spending twenty minutes in a cold exhibit that smells very strongly of fish and that will likely be overcrowded with children just to please her boyfriend. But…she decides to resist a bit longer, just to see what Inigo would do.

“It looks rather crowded. And messy. Eri could fall in the water,” she notes.

"Aww, c'mon! It'll be fun and educational." Inigo glances around to make sure no one was around, and then moves closer to wrap his arms around her and presses a kiss against her neck. “Please, Coru-chan?” he whispers, his breath hot against her ear. Hoge's cheeks flushed slightly and her quirk turned her into a blur in his arms. If she hadn’t already made up her mind to go see the stupid seals, that definitely would have done it.

“Fine,” she says, and she tries to ignore how unsteady her voice sounds.

“Yes!” Inigo whoops, and he pulls back to plant a quick kiss on her lips. “You’re the best!” He disentangles himself and Hoge inwardly bemoans the sudden lack of Inigo wrapped around her. She watches him run up to Eri to share the good news. Eri nodded eagerly, as Hoge approached them. "I'll be super careful and stay far back, I promise!" Inigo shares a triumphant high-five with Eri. Hoge just hid an exasperated smile. Together they headed off towards the noisy seal exhibit.

They end up spending almost half an hour at the seal exhibit. The feeding only takes about ten minutes, but Inigo and Eri insist on meeting each seal and assigning them names based on their personality.

“Alright, see, that one’s Christopher because it’s super irate and spends a lot of time sleeping, just like in class”

“Hmm… I’m gonna call that one Bobby because it just seems like a really friendly sea lion, you know? A real happy guy.”

“And that one is Kaylee because I’m almost one hundred percent sure that it’s just walking around asking the other seals to fight them… See? That was definitely the seal equivalent of ‘Fight me.’”

“And…hey! I found you Hoge, look! It’s the seal that’s just sitting alone in the corner, hiding. Haha—ow!” Hoge pinched Inigo's cheek,

Eri watched wide-eyed as she fed and petted the baby seals. 

Inigo noticed two of the caretakers crouching by one of the white baby seals. Curiosity led him, Eri, and Hoge to investigate.

"What's wrong with this little guy?" Inigo inquired, crouching down beside the caretaker.

The caretaker sighed, her gaze filled with concern. "This baby seal has been sick for a while. We've separated it from the others to prevent the illness from spreading."

Eri's eyes filled with sympathy. "Can't we play with it and make it feel better?"The caretaker kindly refused, explaining the seal needed rest. Eri sighed in disappointment, and Inigo comforted her. They rejoined the visitors, but Inigo soon realized Eri wasn't with them. Hoge tapped him on the shoulder and pointed to the corner. They found Eri beside the sick seal, the horn on her head was glowing softly. Inigo and Hoge exchanged surprised glances. 

"Eri?" Inigo called.

"She's all better now." Eri said, patting the baby seal as it wiggled actively.

"What's happening here?" the caretaker asked, coming from behind them. Eri tensed. Inigo played it cool. "Nothing much. Looks like the little guy is feeling better."

"That's weird, I just checked his vitals earlier," the caretaker said.

Hoge patted Eri's head, and quipped "You should double-check your equipment for any malfunctioning tools."

The perplexed caretaker nodded and took the baby seal away for a second check-up. Eri waved goodbye. They each shared a secret look as they made their way out of the feeding area.

Inigo, Hoge, and Eri entered the sea otter exhibit, instantly melting as the playful creatures rolled and tumbled through the water. Their fuzzy faces and moods shifted rapidly from mischievous to inquisitive and back again. Hoge explained how the otters kept their coats waterproof thanks to specialized fur, while Inigo and Eri giggled at their silly antics. Gigan transformed into an otter and scurried about.

Next, they moved through displays of odd deep sea creatures, surrounded on all sides by the eerie glowing tanks. Spindly spider crabs crept along the seabed while anglerfish dangled their bioluminescent lures. Hoge pointed out viperfish with their long needle-like teeth. Eri stared wide-eyed for a moment before scurrying to hide nervously behind Hoge. Inigo joined them and rubbed Eri's back comfortingly until they got to the end of the tunnel.

***
The tropical ocean tunnel instantly lifted Eri's spirits again! She flitted eagerly from tank to tank, utterly enchanted by the bright colors and chaotic motion of the reef. "They're so pretty!" she exclaimed as a parrot fish swam past in a blur of rainbow scales. Inigo had to stifle a laugh when they passed the blobfish, miming being trapped in an invisible box. Hoge struggled not to smile as she pointed out that blobfish don't look silly in their normal habitat.

-> !["Y'know sometimes I wished we waited before having a kid-ow! I'm kidding!" ](https://i.imgur.com/13ew8dk.png) <-
Inigo's dramatic dismay at the lobsters and oysters in the shellfish hall nearly got them kicked out. Only Hoge's quick lecture on crustacean anatomy placated the disgruntled staff and saved them. Afterwards, she banned any further anti-oyster rants. Inigo grumbled but gave in when she stroked his wrist apologetically. Forgiveness came quickly when Hoge was involved. They found some time for each other while Eri joined a group of children to listen to a guide.

The camouflaged creature exhibits brought out Inigo and Hoge's competitive sides. They playfully bickered and teased over who could spot the most hidden fish. Eri scampered back and forth between tanks to check each new discovery. In the seahorse area, she happily adopted a "baby" to link to her wrist, enthralled by its coiled tail and horselike snout.

***
The massive whale shark tank stole the show. Inigo and Eri jostled at the glass, struggling to capture the creatures' full majesty in photos. Hoge hung back until Inigo coaxed her into the shot with a playful hug. She flushed but allowed him to guide them into fun poses with the gentle sharks drifting past. 

After the shark tank, the aquarium cafe beckoned with promises of cold treats. Inigo ordered himself a triple-scoop cone of mango sea turtle, cotton candy dolphin, and sour gummy shark. Hoge selected a modest double scoop of sea salt caramel. Much to their dismay, Eri chose a massive fishbowl sundae coated in sprinkles, dripping with chocolate sauce, and dotted with gummy octopi.

Eri's eyes went huge at the towering confection. "This is the biggest ice cream ever!" she exclaimed, digging in enthusiastically.

Inigo grinned and nudged Hoge. "Told ya the fish bowl sundae would blow her mind." Hoge just shook her head with an indulgent smile, eyes soft behind her glasses. Eri looked utterly content picking away at the icecream abomination.

***
After two hours, Inigo, Hoge, and Eri wandered out of the Aquarium gift store and into the jellyfish exhibit, with Eri clutching a pair of shark and dolphin plushies. They each stood mesmerized by the otherworldly creatures pulsing in the darkness. "It's like they're ghosts," Eri breathed out, eyes going wide as she stared up. "Look at them floating!"

Hoge nodded approvingly. "Jellyfish are over 98% water. This allows them to float ethereally despite seeming to defy physics."

"If I hug them are they like pillows?"

Inigo stifled a chuckle. "Careful now! They got stingers!" Eri backed away and Inigo patted her head reassuringly as she ran up to join a group of kids watching a feeding demonstration.

Inigo and Hoge stood by the jellyfish tanks and they shared a look. He pointed at the jellyfish and snapped his fingers. "You know this one time. Kaz and I were digging for clams at the beach and a jellyfish stung him. He cried, but I didn't know what to do back then. What do you do if a jellyfish stings you? Pee on it, right?"

Hoge's brow furrowed. "That's a misconception. Urine does not help jellyfish stings. The notion derives from anecdotal evidence and the mistaken belief that urine is sterile."

"Oh." Inigo blinked. "So what actually helps?"

"Application of vinegar to deactivate any remaining stinging cells. Not vinegar from sushi rice, which has added sugar. White distilled vinegar is ideal."

Hoge held up a finger. "Though for more severe reactions, seek medical care. Don't attempt things just because you watched a lifeguard show."

"Duly noted." He grinned impishly. "Still, gonna be honest - if I got stung, my first instinct would definitely be to whip it out and start peeing."

"Inigo!" Hoge scolded, though her lips twitched with suppressed amusement. "There are children present."

She gestured discreetly to a mother and young son across the hall and Eri who just rejoined them. Inigo nodded apologetically.

"Whoops." He shrugged. "But hey, give me some credit for asking." Hoge pinched his cheek and he chuckled.

Just then, Hoge grabbed his arm, her eyes narrowed as she looked behind him. "We're not the only ones here from Shiketsu."

Inigo followed her discreet glance. His eyes widened as he spotted Bobby and Minnie strolling hand-in-hand nearby. And just behind them were Hifumi and Hailey, peering into a tank of seahorses! Inigo gulped. Their classmates being here meant one thing - they had to be on secret dates too! Hoge quickly pulled Inigo and Eri behind a janitor's cart. 

"I don't see why I can't just say hi. They're my bros. I can't believe they're on a double date without me though." Inigo grumbled.

Hoge shook her head, face serious. "I can't let them see me, Ini. There's plenty of rumors already. Let's exercise caution and avoid them."

Inigo nodded. Getting questioned about why they were at the aquarium together with Eri was the last thing they needed.

"What're we doing?" Eri asked inquisitively.

"We're doing some ninja training," Hoge replied quickly.

Eri brightened up, "Oh! I've been training Neh-chan!" She imitated the older girl's crouch and put on a serious face. They snuck away down a side corridor, rolling the janitor's cart to conceal themselves, just as Bobby's voice echoed towards them.
***
Bobby stared at the sunfish in the dimly lit aquarium, puzzled. "Why call it a sunfish if it doesn't glow?" he wondered aloud.

Minnie stood hugging his left arm as she read the sign. "It likes to sunbathe. I totally relate," she replied.

Bobby turned to Minnie with a sly grin. "It does look kinda beautiful and graceful in the water, but not as pretty as you."

Minnie giggled and kissed Bobby's cheek. "Tell me more!"

(Inigo and Hoge sneak quickly behind them pushing the janitor's cart)

Another couple trailed behind. Hifumi and Hailey watched seahorses with their tails entwined.

Hifumi smirked, "The way they hold on is kinda romantic, don't you think?"

Hailey teased, "Did you know the male seahorses get pregnant? Would you do that for me?"

Hifumi didn't hesitate. "In a heartbeat, anything for you!"

Hailey raised a brow and pouted. "You didn't even think about it, Babo."

"What's there to think about? I'll do anything for you, Hai."

"You'll be all bloated."

Hifumi grinned. "So? That won't stop me from becoming the number one hero!"

(The janitor's cart rolled behind Hifumi as he shouted his proclamation.)

The two met up with Minnie and Bobby.

Minnie pointed at the tank next to Hifumi and Hailey, "Oh look at that shrimp!"

Hifumi moved Hailey back, quickly taking a defensive stance, "Stand behind me, Hai!"

Hailey bopped Hifumi's head, "She said shrimp, not Magnum Shrimp!" Bobby and Minnie laughed. 

"I knew that! I was just playing along!" Hifumi yelled confidently as Hailey pulled him into a hug.

Inigo bit back a laugh as they retreated to safety.  Inigo kept watch for any other familiar groups as they explored the exhibits. They took a snack break on a secluded bench near the cafe. Sure enough, up ahead, he spotted a trio of adults in Shiketsu infirmary uniforms clustered around a tank up ahead. Curiously, he recognized The Doctor ahead along with Nurse Becky and the new nurse, Emilia.

"The Doctor?" Inigo whispered, ducking behind a decorative sign for cover. "He must've brought the whole nurse squad!" 

"We'll have to sneak past them. Good thing we kept this." Inigo patted the janitor's cart. 

"Note the unique coloration of the spotted moray eel. Its adaptations for ocean life are simply fascinating!" the Doctor exclaimed.

Emilia mused, "Very interesting markings. I'll have to read up more on moray eels."

"That’s the diversity of aquatic life for you. I'll admit it has its charms," Nurse Becky said. Just then- Becky grabbed her waist and shook. "I'm cramping again..."

Emilia looked up with concern, "Sit down and let me give your arm a massage."

“Feeling better?” Emilia asks.

“Yes, I feel much better now. Thanks Emilia.” Becky replies and with that they turn their attention back to the Doctor.

The Doctor cheered, "Too right! Now, compare the chromatophores of the cuttlefish here with the octopus in the next exhibit..."

He wandered over to another tank with the nurses following him.

The Doctor gasped, "Good heavens, get a load of the size of that mammoth Pacific octopus! I'd fancy getting my hands on that fine specimen. Imagine getting up close and personal with those slick, supple tentacles wrapped around you. What a dream!"

"Oh my..." Nurse Becky frowned. "While that's interesting, I do prefer the seahorse or the axolotl for their gestation qualities."

"Doctors, there are children present," Emilia scolded gently.

"Apologies, I got rather carried away. Now observe the hypnotic pulsations of these alluring squids..." The Doctor said,

(Inigo and Hoge sneak by unnoticed, looking disturbed as they whisper for Eri to cover her ears.)

"Simply fascinating!" The Doctor exclaimed. "Note the sophisticated chromatophores patterns, you'll need to learn that when operating on mutants."

The nurses murmured in scholarly agreement.

Inigo let out a low whistle of surprise once the pair had drifted past. "Is everyone at school here except us?" he joked. "Maybe," Hoge pointed to the side. The trio heard a cheery voice.

"Look at that one, Sally! It's an angel fish!" Inigo ducked, he turned to see Noah and Sally approaching, hand in hand. Sally in particular was looking in their direction.

Thinking fast, Inigo swept up Eri and deposited her safely inside the janitor's cart to obscure her from view. Then he put on the janitor's jacket inside out and smoothed his hair flat.

When Noah and Sally reached them, Inigo flashed a bright grin. {"Why hello there, fine Japanese people!"} he exclaimed loudly in an exaggerated Southern accent. {"What a right nice aquarium this here is!"}

Sally frowned, clearly perplexed. "Inigo, what are you-"

But Inigo steamrolled on theatrically. {"I believe y'all have me confused with someone very handsome! The name's Billy Bob...Smith."} He stuck out his hand. {"Just a good ol' boy from Texas visitin' your parts!"}

Noah politely shook his hand, smiling kindly. {"Oh! Welcome to Japan, Mr. Smith. Noah hopes you're enjoying the aquarium so far!"}

{"Darn tootin'!"} Inigo enthused. Sally frowned and stepped around Inigo, {"Who's that behind you?"}, she said.

He jerked a thumb back at the hunched Hoge. {"And this? Eh.."} He quickly turned Gigan into a gray wig for Hoge. {"Here's my granny Agnes. Say howdy, Granny!"}

Still crouched, Hoge blinked slowly then lifted a hand in greeting. "Herro, yangu wanzu," she said in her thick Japanese accent. "Mai Gurandosun Billy Bob ando Ai aru jusuto ruvingu zisu Fishu Zoo!"

Inigo nodded eagerly. {"Ain't seen sea creatures this big back in Texas, 'cept maybe them wild zebras and kangaroos! Well, y'all enjoy your date now! Granny and I best mosey along. Yipeedoodey!"}

{"Yipeedoodey to you too, sir!"} Noah said happily. Sally stood puzzled.

Inigo mimed tipping a cowboy hat, then hustled Hoge and the janitor cart carrying Eri quickly away down the hall. He peeked behind to see the lovebirds holding hands once more as wandered towards the gift store. Once safely out of sight, all three dissolved into relieved laughter.

"That was close!" Inigo said, pretending to wipe sweat from his brow. "But nice save with the accents. Totally fooled 'em!"

"Did I do good?" Eri called out from inside the cart.

"You did great!" Inigo cheered.

Hoge just shook her head, smiling slightly. "I suppose it worked and- I just caught McCarthy breaking the rules-huhuhu,"

"But aren't we breaking the same rule?" Inigo raised a brow.

"It's not the same," Hoge said briskly as she helped Eri out of the cart and tidied the little girl's mussed hair.

"Cause we're ninjas?" Eri said, her eyes wide.

"Cause we're ninjas." Hoge nodded in agreement.

Inigo chuckled. "Alright then, Operation Aquarium Stealth Date is still going strong! Who's up for checking out the dolphin show next?" After abandoning the cart, they set off once more. The coast seemed clear, for now, dodging classmates and staff was all part of the fun.

###Chapter 5: Dolphin Show
-> ![Careful not to get splashed!](https://i.imgur.com/izy6M9S.png) <-

Inigo, Hoge, and Eri entered the marine park's outdoor amphitheater and took their seats near the front. Below them was a large pool where dolphins were swimming and jumping happily.

"Look at them!" Eri said, bouncing in her seat. "I've never seen dolphins before!"

Hoge nodded, her eyes scanning the area. "Dolphins are known for their high levels of intelligence. I've heard, some even have quirks now."

"I'm hyped, I've been excited for this one," Inigo added. "You see all those fans up front! The trainers are part of a pro-hero and idol group called the Undersea Rangers. Real crowd pleasers."

Just then, an announcer's voice boomed through the speakers. "Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Please welcome your hosts for today's show - the Undersea Rangers!"

Cheers erupted around them as three young women ran out waving. They were dressed in flashy wetsuits - one pink, one blue, and one yellow.

The blue-suited hero waved her arms, water droplets flying from her hands. "Hello everyone! I'm Tidal Wave!" Spiraling waves fell around her.

The one in white did a twirl, her hair fluttering in the wind. "Call me Sea Breeze!" The spiraling waves were sent blowing upwards into the air.

Finally, the yellow-suited hero struck a pose. "And I'm Sunny! Together we're the Undersea Rangers!" She raised a hand and the area above her visibly brightened creating a rainbow as the cascading water fell behind the idol group. More cheers.

Inigo and Eri whistled and cheered enthusiastically. He leaned over to Hoge as the heroes played to the crowd. "Rumor is they're trying to break into the top 10 hero rankings, but some think Rosethorn is purposely keeping them off the rankings."

"Why would she do that?" Hoge asked. Inigo shrugged. "No idea. Heroes and their drama, am I right?"

The Rangers gave introductions of their quirks - Tidal Wave could produce and control whirlpools, Sea Breeze created air currents, and Sunny produced blinding light. They then welcomed the dolphins, who jumped and flipped to delight the audience. One even shot a jet of ice shards from its blowhole thanks to an ice-manipulation quirk.

After several tricks, Tidal Wave addressed the crowd again. "As you saw, some of our dolphins have quirks! We rescued them from unethical captive quirk testing. Now they're our partners in hero work and conservation efforts!"

The show continued, the Rangers and dolphins performing in sync. Tidal Wave raised pillars of water for the dolphins to jump through while Sea Breeze blew them higher. At one point Sunny created a flash of light, causing a magnificent rainbow.

Inigo nudged Hoge. "Check out these sweet moves! Gigan, why can't you do that?" He made a hoop with his arms. "Jump through!" Gigan attempted to jump off the seat without using his wings and fell. "Oooh! So close, buddy!" 

"Baka, stop that," Hoge scolded, but Eri giggled.

For the finale, all three Rangers used their quirks together as the quirk-dolphin fired a huge ice blast. The combined powers created a towering waterspout which sprinkled down on the audience as snow and droplets of waters. Spectators shrieked and raised coats and bags to block the water.

"I got this." Inigo grinned. He activated his quirk, transforming part of Gigan into a large rain jacket that expanded to shield himself, Hoge, and Eri from the sprinkles, except for the holes along their faces to Eri's delight.

"Yay, no wet clothes!" Eri said happily under the protection of the construct jacket. The crowd cheered wildly as the show ended. Inigo retracted his construct back into its dragon form as they began filing out. "Want to try meeting the Rangers?" he asked. "I bet we could get autographs."

Eri's eyes went wide. "Could we really?"

"Of course, just leave it to me!" Inigo said smoothly.

They headed down to the front railing where the Undersea Rangers were greeting fans. Inigo waved trying to get their attention.

-> ![Look out top 10! The Undersea Rangers are coming!](https://i.imgur.com/5CUfDJP.jpg) <-

"Excuse me, Miss Rangers! Eri-chan, here would love to get your autographs if you have a moment!" He gestured to Eri, who suddenly looked shy at all the attention.

"Of course! Hello Eri-chan! Aren't you just adorable!" Sunny said, smiling brightly. She and the other Rangers came over.

"Hiiii~!" Sea-breeze exclaimed, waving.

"O.M.G! Anything for a fan!" gushed Tidal Wave.

Inigo handed them a notebook and pen. The three heroes signed with flourish, chatting with Eri.

"Did you enjoy the show?" asked Sea Breeze. Eri nodded eagerly.

"The quirk dolphins were so cool!" she said. "I liked when they made the big waterspout!"

Tidal Wave laughed. "That's one of our biggest crowd-pleasers." She ruffled Eri's hair. "Keep an eye out for our next event, little fan!"

After autographs, Inigo and Hoge thanked them for their time. As they turned to leave, Sunny called out to Inigo.

"Hey, sorry but you look so familiar! Do you go to Shiketsu??"

Inigo paused and grinned. "Yeah! My name's Inigo Myoga."

Sea Breeze's eyes lit up in recognition. "L.O.L I knew it! I saw you two at the tournament. You're one of Shiketsu's first years, right? I think Rosethorn mentioned you when we visited."

Inigo looked surprised but tried to play it cool. "Oh yeah? Good things I hope." He laughed.

"She said your class has promise," Tidal Wave remarked. “Even though there's some rebelious types."

Inigo coughed. "Heh, tough but fair. How do you know her by the way?"

Tidal Wave piped up from behind. "Oh we all used to be her sidekicks! That is until she got jealous of our fame and totally F.R.-eaked!"

Sunny shrugged. "We still visit her in the hospital though! Aren't we just so nice? Say, are any of you looking for an internship?"

Sea Breeze slapped her hands together. "W.O.W! Rosethorn would just love it if we got some of her students as interns! Please tell us you're free!"

Inigo found it hard to say to say no to the over-eager idols. "Etto'...you see."

Hoge stepped forward. "Thank you, Rangers. But we should go." She quickly dragged Inigo behind her while leading Eri away.

Once they were out of earshot, Hoge sighed. "There's a reason why Rosethorn-sensei doesn't like them and I trust her. We should stay away from them."

Inigo blinked twice, letting go of his dreams of a beach-filled internship. "Well, I guess you're right. I felt weird for a second there. But hey! At least Eri got her autographs! And it was a super fun show!" 

Eri was looking down contently at the signed notebook. Hoge gave a half smile.



###Chapter 6: Goodbyes
As they left the dolphin show, Inigo felt his phone buzz. He pulled it out and saw a new message from an unknown number.

'Here with the car out front. Don't keep the girl out too late.'

Inigo's face fell slightly. Their magical day together was nearly over.

"Looks like your ride's here, kiddo," he said, pocketing his phone.

Eri's face fell. "Aww, already?"

Hoge gave her shoulder a comforting pat. "Don't be sad. We can always visit again another time."

"Promise?" Eri asked, lower lip wobbling.

Inigo crouched down and held out his pinky. "Promise. We'll come back and see the narwhal next time, okay?"

Eri nodded firmly and locked pinkies with him. Inigo ruffled her hair.

The trio made their way reluctantly towards the entrance. Near the gate, two stern-looking men in black suits waited. Overhaul's guards had arrived.

Eri glanced at Inigo and Hoge. "Let's go again soon, okay? You promised! I want to see the narwhal." The young girl wiped her eyes and sniffed. As she wiped, one of the bandages on her finger fell revealing a bruise. Inigo blinked twice and shared a look with Hoge.

"By the way, Eri-chan. Why are your fingers bandaged up?" Hoge inquired, tilting her head as she crouched to Eri's level.

Eri visibly tensed up and glanced at her hands. "I-I hurt them while playing."

"Are you sure?" Inigo raises his brows. "You know you can tell us anything."

Eri nodded resolutely. "Y-yes." She grew quiet. Inigo placed a hand on Eri's shoulder and looked up at the waiting guards.

She moved and hugged Hoge tightly around the waist. "Thank you Hoge-nee. I had the best day ever."

Hoge's expression softened. She returned the embrace gently. "I'm very glad. Make sure to take good care of Sharkle and Mister Dolphin."

Eri nodded seriously before turning to Inigo. Easing up he swept her up in a big bear hug and swung her around, eliciting happy giggles.

"See ya later squirt. Don't stop being awesome," he said as he set her down.

With one last wave, she skipped over to the waiting guards and slipped into a dark town car outside. Inigo watched wistfully as it pulled away down the parking lot.

"Do you think she'll really be okay?" Hoge asked softly once the car was out of sight.

Inigo sighed and slipped an arm around her shoulders. "I hope so. Not much we can do except be there for her when we can."

Hoge nodded, leaning into him subtly. They stood together in pensive silence for a moment, waves of people flowing around them.

Eventually Inigo shook off the somber mood. Worrying accomplished nothing. He could only control this moment now.

Turning to Hoge, he replaced his worried frown with a playful grin. "Sooo, since we have the rest of the day to ourselves now..."

Inigo wiggled his eyebrows. "Wanna grab some lunch together? Maybe go for a romantic walk? I hear the jellyfish tanks look awesome in the dark." He made an exaggerated cute pleading face. Hoge scoffed and shoved his shoulder, but she couldn't hide her amused smile completely.

"You're incorrigible," she informed him sternly. But she didn't protest as Inigo hugged her close and steered them back inside, rambling about all the exhibits left to explore just the two of them.

Their time with Eri today had been a bright spot of joy. However uncertain the future, he was determined to keep his promise to Eri and make sure this wasn't the last happy day they spent together. Eri was just like him, born into a darkness that will always be there, but slowly, he would help her push it back, the same way Hoge and his friends had helped him.

###Chapter 7: Dark Corners
They wander around aimlessly, hand in hand, moving from exhibit to exhibit. Inigo yelps about how cold the water is when he dips his fingers into the tide pool; Hoge laughs and strokes the sea cucumbers and grins at the starfish under her palms. She rolls up her sleeves and reaches in to glide her hands over the baby stingrays, and her face softens into a smile; Inigo teases her and says he’s jealous. Hoge flicks the water off her hands onto Inigo; he yelps and threatens to feed her to the sharks. Together, they pushed their heads into a small glass dome under a tank, which made it seem like they were divers underwater.

Somehow they find themselves in a dark corner, Inigo’s hands on Hoge’s waist, Hoge’s fingers tangled in Inigo’s hair, their lips hot and heavy, illuminated by the distant glow of the fish tanks.

Hoge hooks her leg around Inigo’s, her back pressed against the wall, and he tightens his grip and pulls her closer until they’re completely flush against one another. She lets their tongues meet halfway as he fights her for control. Hoge hums, pulling away for a breath and grins deviously. Inigo darts his tongue out to lick her lips, his breath coming in harsh pants, eyes dark, and she leans up to press a wet kiss against his jaw. Inigo shudders against her and she feels his fingers tighten around her waist; one hand slides down to grip the underside of her thigh.

Hoge inhales sharply, her nose filling with the distinct tang of sweat and boy and Inigo, and she pulls at his hair, the strands sliding between her fingers like silk. She muffles Inigo’s groan with her mouth and bites down on his bottom lip, and then presses an apologetic kiss against the corner of his mouth. Inigo lets out a small noise, almost a whimper, and she laughs against his lips.

There’s a sudden flash of light and Hoge’s eyes fly open. She pulls away with a gasp and stares at Inigo: his swollen lips, his mussed hair, his rumpled clothing, his wide eyes.

“Excuse me, no flash photography please!”

It suddenly dawns on Hoge what exactly they’d been doing in a darkened corner of a deep-sea fish exhibit.

“Ini, we should.. stop.”

Inigo makes a funny noise in his throat then, and Hoge looks up at him in confusion.

“Damn it, do we have to? I’ll fight them if they try to stop us,” he says, his voice strained.

Hoge stares at him, indecisively, and then she shakes her head.

“Ini,” she whispers. She pushes away from the wall and grabs Inigo’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “I think you need to cool down. Maybe a swim with the eels, hm?”

“Jerk,” Inigo mutters.

Hoge grins. Inigo sighs, exasperated, and moves to leave, but Hoge tugs on his hand, “Wait.”

Hoge sets about straightening Inigo’s clothes for him, and Inigo, after a moment, returns the favor. Hoge motions for Inigo to bend down. Hoge runs her thumb over Inigo’s bottom lip.

“I didn’t hurt you, did I?” she asks, concerned.

Inigo smiles and shakes his head. “I’m fine.” He catches Hoge’s wrist and tucks a stray hair behind Hoge’s ear. He snickers suddenly, his face brightening with surprise. “Oh crap.”

“What?”

Inigo brushes his fingers over Hoge’s neck, grinning. “I think I gave you a hickey.”

Hoge squeaks and rubs her neck. “Uwaaa- b-baka!”

“I’m sorry!” He teases sheepishly. “I didn’t mean to do it. I got carried away.”

“Is it noticeable?”

“I got this.” Inigo reached into his bag and pulled out a travel-size make-up kit.

“Why do you have that?”

“When I was little, my brothers and I had to live in a kyabakura for a few months. The ladies there would get into fights and altercations all the time, so I learned to help them with their make-up. Plus, I get into scraps all the time.”

Hoge frowned and rubbed the side of Inigo’s neck, revealing a bruise. “Where did you get this one?”

“Eh, you can blame Imai for that.”

“Did you two fight?”

“Nah, he took too long to pick up a gun. It’s kinda a weird story- There!” He stood back and smiled at his work. “You’re all set. You wanna find another corner and pick up where we left off?” He said hopefully, with a wink.

“L-let’s just—look at the other exhibits.” With a flustered smile, Hoge takes Inigo’s hand and pulls him away, headed in no particular direction.

###Chapter 8: Final Exhibit
>>Recommended music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZqKkDOaS3k

They meander through the exhibits, Inigo laughing at the variety of odd-looking fish (again), Hoge looking on in amused silence.

When they passed a door labeled "Staff Only," Inigo's eyes lit up. Without hesitation, he grabbed Hoge's hand and pulled her through the doorway before she could protest.

"Trust me. I’ve been looking for this place," he whispered at her wary look. Inigo shrunk Gigan and placed the dragon in his pocket. They crept unseen down the dim hallway beyond the door, Inigo trailing one hand along the wall to guide them.

After a minute or two of tense sneaking, the passage opened up into a massive domed room. Inigo froze in awe at the enormous cylindrical fish tank that dominated the space, stretching from floor to ceiling. Inside was the most incredible creature he had ever seen - a full-grown blue whale, drifting with stately grace.

"Whoa. There she is," Inigo breathed.

"How did you know about this place?" she asked softly.

"I heard from my contacts about how they're releasing her soon," Inigo explained. "I wanted you to get to see her up close before she's gone. Can you believe it? We're practically inside the tank with it!"

Hoge approached the tank and stared. “*Balaenoptera musculus,* It can grow to 30m long and weigh more than one-hundred-eighty-thousand kilograms. The blue whale is the biggest animal to ever exist.”

Inigo moved to stand beside her. "Makes you feel so small, getting to see one up close," he murmured reverently.

Hoge nodded, eyes never leaving the whale. "She seems...lonely," she whispered.

Inigo tilted his head, studying the giant. Now that Hoge mentioned it, the whale did appear solitary, swimming endless loops with no companions in the confines of her tank.

"You're right," he realized. He leaned against the glass next to Hoge. "Poor girl. Bet she misses having other whales to talk to. Or however, whales communicate." Inigo waved a hand airily."

That earned him a small, amused smile from Hoge before she turned back to the hypnotic circles of the whale's path.

"Blue whales usually travel in small pods," she remarked softly. "Roaming the oceans, singing their songs."

Her hand slid down the glass, fingertips trailing the whale's steady movements.

"But she's confined here, cut off from her kind. Only the echoes of her own voice for company."

“I hope she finds others when she gets out,” Inigo said grinning. He cupped his hands together. “You hear that.” He said, tapping the glass lightly. “I’m rooting for you, girl.”

Hoge's brow furrowed, her eyes dark with empathy. Inigo curiously studied her pensive profile. She tips her head back in awe and stares at the slow-moving creature swimming beyond the tank. She raises her hand, tinged blue from the light filtering through the water, and presses it gently against the glass. She tries to suppress a gasp as the whale swims past right in front of her. She follows it with her eyes and watches as it moves deeper into the tank until it’s lost from sight. A wave of calm washes over her as she follows it and watches the creature circle lazily above. She stays frozen, simply observing her chest light, until she hears footsteps approaching behind her.

![Sorry it took awhile for your whale song to reach me.](https://i.imgur.com/iWMLgIt.jpg)

Inigo took her wrist and smiled.

"Hey," he said quietly.

For a moment, he simply stared at her. "Do you remember that little whale toy you used to have when you were small? The one you said was really special to you growing up?"

He shifted as he pulled out something hidden away in his pocket., "Well, I tried to find one just like it but the gift shops don’t sell them anymore."

He ducked his head. "I ended up calling the manufacturer and begging them to check their inventory. They found one stashed away in a warehouse. So I bought it," he admitted and met her gaze tentatively. "I want you to have it. To remind you of...us, and of today. Happy one month anniversary!" He grinned and presented a small plastic whale toy on a keychain.

Hoge's eyes shimmered. She turned the plastic keychain over in her hands.

Inigo fidgeted, doubts creeping in. "I'm sorry, this was dumb, wasn't it? I was gonna get something expensive but I’m kinda short this month. It looks pretty small and cheap. I shouldn't have assumed—"

Hoge threw her arms around his neck, cutting off his rambling apology."Thank you, Ini."

Relief crashed over Inigo in a dizzying wave. He hugged her back fiercely. “You like it?” When they finally parted, Hoge gazed down at the keychain, wiping her eyes. "I can't believe you found him after all this time," she said with a watery laugh.

She looked back up at Inigo, her expression soft and vulnerable. "Do you want to know why this meant so much to me?"

Inigo nodded, waiting patiently.

Hoge took a deep breath. "When I was little, my quirk made it hard to connect with others. Other kids thought I was strange, and adults found me difficult." She closed her hand tightly around the keychain. "Before that, I had a friend at daycare who went to an aquatic park. She got the whale toy there and gave it to me.” She stared at the toy in her hand, “I was so excited that the teacher got mad and made us sit on opposite sides of the room, but it didn’t matter, I was happy to have something precious to play with.”

She grew quiet, her outline blurring, “That was the week my quirk started to come in. It was happening to the other kids as well, with all the excitement, every one kept forgetting me. My friend never played with me again.”

Looking up at him, Hoge continued, "Soon after, her family moved away. And not long after that, my quirk got stronger, making me even more isolated. My parents grew more distant and I found myself alone. ”

Hoge smiled sadly, “I used to sit in my bedroom and turn the whale over and over in my hand. I’d whisper secret worries to it about how my friend must’ve found new friends and everyone found somebody else to belong with. Still. It was my last tangible link to other people. So I kept it with me at all times - hanging from my bag, in a pocket on important test days, or sitting on the desk to keep company. I even had it during the entrance exam.”

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "That silly toy was the only comfort I had on lonely nights. The last gift I ever got out of generosity instead of obligation, the very last gift given from the heart. Proof someone had cared for me once..."

"Now you have me..." he promised fiercely. "I'll always be there when you need me.” He reached to cradle Hoge's face, brushing away a fallen tear with his thumb. Hoge's lower lip wobbled and she started to hiccup. She pressed her face into Inigo's palm, overcome. They stood entwined next to the drifting whale, the rest of the world fading away. Inigo held Hoge as she let pent-up hurt flow out of her.

Hoge let out a watery laugh. She wrapped both hands around the renewed symbol of friendship, holding it over her heart. "Thank you for this," she whispered. "And...for caring. It means more than I can say."

She finds Inigo staring at her with the utmost look of adoration on his face, his eyes soft and mouth turned up in a small smile.

“What?” Hoge says, suddenly self-conscious.

“I love you,” Inigo says. He says it so simply, so easily, without any hesitation, that Hoge feels her heart swell and her throat constrict.

Hoge clutches at the back of Inigo’s shirt and buries her face into the crook of his neck.

“Are you okay?” he asks, rubbing his hands up Hoge’s back.

Hoge nods and tries to steady her breathing. Inigo stays silent, waiting for her.

She swallows. “Ini… You can’t just say that.”

She feels Inigo press a kiss to the side of her head, then chuckle.

“What’s the big deal?” he says. “It’s not like this is the first time I’ve said it to you.”

“I know. I’m - it’s hard to explain,” Hoge pulls in a breath. “You just make it seem so easy. Like—like loving me is easy. I don’t know.”

“Hey now,” Inigo says, and she pulls back to look at him. He leans in to rest their foreheads together, and she swallows, staring into Inigo’s eyes.

“Hoge, loving you is the easiest thing I’ve ever done.”

She smiles, a warm feeling spreading out from her chest to the tips of her fingers, letting Inigo’s words sink in. And then she snorts.

“That was too cheesy, where did you get that line from?” she asks, smiling.

Inigo laughs, “That’s mine too! But I know. I’m kind of embarrassed, to be honest, but it’s true. I love you.”

“Good.” She stared up at him and bit her lip. A pause. “Ini, I lo-”

A bubble popped and a loud voice yelled, “I told you someone’s there! This is a restricted area! Get them!” A sharp whistle is heard and they turn to see a security guard running into the exhibit followed by an Oyster-headed man in a suit.

“They’re somewhere in here! Find them!”

Inigo and Hoge ran together laughing as they made their way to the other exhibits.

###Chapter 9: Home
>Recommended music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Pvsc7wW74

After a long, fun-filled day at the aquarium, Inigo and Hoge settled tiredly within her dorm room. Gigan waited outside the door as look-out.

"You sure I can't stay the night?"

"We have school tomorrow," Hoge deadpans and thumps Inigo’s thigh with her fist. 

Inigo smirks, "Nope. We're quiting hero school to become a seal feeder. You wanna run away with me?" he can feel Hoge’s giggles from where her head is resting on his stomach but she pointedly doesn’t answer.

Inigo stops carding his fingers through her hair to poke her cheek. “Okay okay but before I go, we need to make a choice,” he teases, his smile evident in his voice. Inigo sits up and twists to reach over the side of the bed. Hoge groans when he jostles her head. Inigo rummages around, huffing, until he finally snags what he’s looking for with a triumphant, “Aha!” and flops back onto the bed.

There’s the sound of a paper bag crinkling and then there is something small and soft landing on Hoge's head. Several small things, in fact. "Here, pick whichever cute fishy friend you want to keep, I'll take the rest," Inigo offered with a grin.

Hoge eyed the colorful selection, pursing her lips uncertainty. "Perhaps we should divide them equally," she suggested, "Choose one."

Inigo nodded agreeably and picked up a cute turtle plush. "Then I'll take this little guy," he declared.

But Hoge immediately shook her head, eyes narrowing. "Not that one."

Inigo blinked in surprise. "Oh, uh, okay then... How bout' The sea otter?"

"Nope," Hoge deadpans.

He searched the pile before holding up a smiling starfish plush. "How about this funky dude?"

Hoge pouted, eyebrows drawing together. "No, I'm rather fond of that one as well."

Inigo rubbed his neck sheepishly. "My bad. Hmm..." He grabbed a toothy shark plush and waved it playfully. "This scary guy?"

Instead of answering, Hoge suddenly nuzzled her nose against Inigo's cheek. "Not Sharkle Junior. Try again," she whispered close to his ear. 

Inigo's brain short-circuited at the intimate contact. His eyes went wide as understanding finally hit.

"O-oh!" he stammered out eloquently, face heating up. "Did you want me to pick...you?"

Hoge pulled back just enough to nod, her own cheeks adorably pink. "Okay, I pick you," Inigo's eyes softened as he gazed at Hoge, her cheeks still flushed pink. Slowly, gently, he leaned in, bringing his hand up to cup her face. Hoge's eyes fluttered closed as their lips met in a  kiss. Inigo rested his forehead against hers, his thumb tracing small circles on her cheek as they both fell back on the bed.

Inigo ends up not taking any of the plushies home that night.
