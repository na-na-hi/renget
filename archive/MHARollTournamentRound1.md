>SAWBONES VS KEVIN ROOL
Sawbones: 12, 11, 6
Kevin Rool: 12, 18, 3
Sawbones: 11
Kevin Rool: 4

Kevin Rool may have been a dragon apparently, but the literal who snorefest got actually killed by the Hero-Villain Sawbones, who gathered pain from people who saw cringe, and overloaded him to death.

Stand proud Kevin Rool, you were strong.

>OMURA TODAO VS SMOKIN' SEXY
Apparently his name is Conman: 11, 6, 19
Smokin' Sexy: 11, 4, 6,

Conman, who makes illusions, vs Smokin' Sexy! I don't know what Smokin' Sexy does but it doesn't matter because Conman put the illusion of a 13 year old girl over an oven and Smokin' Sexy smoked his 'sexy'.

Stand proud Smokin' Sexy, you were strong.

>FLOOR VS HYDRA
Floor: 3, 10, 19
Kisame: 9, 8, 8

Before Floor could do anything at all, Victor stopped water inertia in the moisture around himself to make a barrier, just to show off. He then splattered into red mist against the stopped water. Why? Because Earth didn't stop... or whatever. What a nerd.

Stand proud Water Inertia Guy, you were strong.

>EUGENE KURTZ VS ICHIMAKI
Eugene Krabs: 1, 5, 9
Ichimaki: 7, 10, 18

Lmao, Ichimaki splatters this man across the ground. Wait, uh, lemme check his Quirk... oh, he has a sword? Yeah, he stabs him.

Stand proud Mr Krabs, you were strong.

>OVERMAN VS ORBIT
Overman: 2, 8, 10
Orbit: 17, 15, 9

"...Do you believe in gravity, Oberumanu?"
"No."
*CRUNCH*
I don't know if these guys would really say those things but I enjoyed the JoJo reference. I hate Part 6 btw.

Stand proud Overman, you were strong.

>BLACKOUT VS BAKENEKO
*#ASHLEIGHSWEEP*: 8, 10, 9
Bakeneko: 12, 1, 3

Ashleigh walks into the room, says "**#ASHLEIGHSWEEP**" at the top of her lungs, and Bakeneko explodes into a shower of gore. I don't care enough to look up either of their quirks for now, so this is what happens.

Stand proud Catgirl, you were strong.

>MAULER VS GOLDORADO
Darth Maul: 4, 20, 14
Gold Guy: 14, 12, 19

\*checks Goldorado's quirk*

Wow, this guy is boring. He replicates a sniper rifle and shoots Mauler in the head, 720 no scoping him. I have nothing else to say, these guys are really boring.

Stand sad Mauler, you were weak.

>SAURUS VS ISABELA
I expect great things from you, Saurusanon. Chop chop, get a move on with that wrestler speech.

Saurus: 12, 14, 2
Isabela: 16, 17, 19

Damn.

As Saurus prepares his speech, Isabela blasts him with a ray gun, incinerating him on the spot. Then she giggles and says "Reminder to all Arena Anons that WGWL will be the only Arena completed, ever!"

Stand proud Saurus, you were strong.

>JACK DUNN VS TOMI
Jack Dunn: 17, 8, 8
Tomi: 17, 6, 19
Jack Dunn: 14
Tomi: 5

Jack Dunn turns off his body cam, and Tomi's corpse was found with several bullet holes and crack that was TOTALLY not planted there. Thin red line, babyyyyy.

Stand proud Tomi, you were strong.

>TOP SMILE VS SETO KAWATA
Top: 2, 18, 5
Seto: 17, 13, 16

U.A Student vs U.A's Mio! Top Smile gets detention, and Seto Kawata gives a speech about how he wiped out the other U.A builds and will wipe out them all in this tournament. Then a plant kills him or something.

Stand proud Top Smile, you were strong.
