The long awaited full myth off collab finally came. After some scuff during the 3D arm wrestle part, they finally got to relax a bit with some chatting and drinks Mori promised. Speaking of those, Mori went to the kitchen to prepare, an excited smile creeping around her face. She was stocked to act as the bartender for her precious friends.

Of course, this wasn’t the whole reason. The smile on Mori’s face didn’t come from happiness, it came from the perverseness in her mind. There wasn’t going to be a second opportunity for Calli to enact her own twisted fantasy on the people she has met for some time. She could barely hide the excitement, her legs trembling, her heart beating at top speed, drops of sweat forming on her forehead.

However most of these didn't come from her current  emotions. In actuality Mori’s bladder was on her limit, holding on pee since the night before. It all came down to this moment and this moment only

You see, Mori wanted to add a bit of flavor to the drink. Her own flavor, that is.

“Calli, do you need help with the drink?” Kiara asked.

“haha it’s ok my dude. I got this… just give me some time” Mori replied, trying her best to hide the nervousness that came from the probability of her stunt being discovered. That, and she is about to piss herself yo.

*oh please hold on a bit longer, just a bit more* Mori’s desperation came at full force, her own panties wetting with droplets of piss. She pulled her panties down to her ankles, thanking the counter in the kitchen was tall enough to cover her filthy act. Mori grabbed the big glass jar sitting on the kitchen counter, and aimed it at her pee hole.

*oh baby, this is the stuff. Let’s gooooooo* Mori closed her eyes, holding a hand over her tum bulging with all the liquid stored for this occasion, a satisfied look spreading through her face. That wasn’t the only thing spreading. A big spray of piss shot from Mori’s pussy to the glass jar, filling up half of it in mere seconds. Mori was glad the girls were too distracted to pay attention to her. The sound of her piss crashing against the sides of the jar, like waves of the ocean hitting the rocks on the beach. It was that loud. 

Mori didn’t care. She had been holding it for way too long. It was time to enjoy the pure ecstasy that came from pissing her soul out, with her friends just a steps closer to her. The sheer degeneracy of the act was enough to push Calli into a climax, her free hand quickly covering her mouth. Mori’s back arched, and her torrent of piss shot like a charge riffle, legs giving in at the pure pleasure she experienced. The jar was big  enough to catch it all, although some of it shot outside of it. 

*Fuck it. I’ll clean the floor later* Mori recovered from her post climax status, watching over the counter to see if the girls noticed anything. They were still talking and singing, none the wiser to the reaper’s action. 

Mori put the jar on the counter, then accommodating her panties like nothing happened. She took a peek at the result of her actions. The jar was filled to the brim with yellow liquid, a bit of fizz swimming on the surface, some pink pubic air as well.  A clear menacing heat emanated from the soiled juice jar, dark colored urine with evaporating juices raised to the top. The reaper girl looked satisfied with the results,  colocating the beer mugs for the 4 girls across the table with a smug look.  

*Time to mix drinks and change lives* Calli thought, taking pride in her talents as a drink mixer. It was thanks to them, she knew the perfect combination of ingredients to hide just enough the pungent smell and taste her stinky undead urine. She poured the urine from the jar into each glass, different quantities depending on the drink she was going to deliver.

A bit of preparation later, the drinks were done and ready to be served. Calli took the 4 drinks in a plate, putting them neatly in front of her genmates to not raise any suspicion from them.

“Woahh Calli, these look amazing. Did *you* really make them, hmm?” Ame teased, grinning to the reaper.

“Hell yeah I did. Come on drink them, I wonder if you’ll notice the secret ingredient” Calli purred, taking a seat next to the other girls.

“IT 'S PEE!” Gura yelled, shocking everyone with this joke. The myth girls ignored the comment and moved on like if she said nothing at all. 

Callii looked calm, but deep inside she was fuming. Her perfectly orchestrated plan was in peril, she nervously handed Ina her drink, sweating bullets as she did.

“Here you go, tell me what you think”

“Thanks Calli. Ohh  it’s kinda hot, I didn’t expect that.” Ina looked curiously at the drink in her hand, licking her lips in awe, expecting  a really refreshing hot beverage. “Alright itadakimasu!!”

Ina chugged the drink down in one go, raising the mug over her head. Her attempt at showing off her drinking skills quickly backfired. A sour, powerful taste quickly invaded each part of her throat, it was too late to stop now without making a mess. Ina took the resolve to finish the drink without a stop, holding back the need to cough it out. She looked at the inside of the mug, a good amount still remaining. 

*oh god I can’t anymore!* Ina thought, putting the mug down, a few drops of the mystery drink falling into her clothes. The priestess girl coughed a few times, shedding a few tears from her eyes. 

“Oh god, Ina are you ok?” Ame asked, worrying about the state of the purple girl.

“Oh.. *cough* yeah, it was just a bit *strong* . I’ll sip the rest quietly, don't mind me” Ina sipped at her mug, tasting slowly what she just drank previously. It was like nothing she had ever experienced before, the bitterness of the flavor, the lingering heat resonating through her tongue. Ina was left in a state of arousal , her stare lost in the distance, gasping for air like she just ran an entire marathon. This reaction was more than Mori could have anticipated, she had to see the reactions of the remaining girls as soon as possible.

“My, It looks like Ina got a bit drunk there. How about you go next, Kiara? Take it slowly” Mori said, passing the drink to Kiara.

“Hmph you underestimate me Calli. Alright, bottoms up!” Kiara took a big sip of the drink, keeping it around her mouth to taste it carefully. Kiara’s face turned to confusion,  her own eyes watering. The taste was so raunchy, the pungent smell invaded each corner of her respiratory system. Kiara had no choice but to gulp it down, desperately swallowing down the yellow liquid. “Calli, what the hell you put in these?! It’s so yucky, I feel like throwing up”

“Kiara you’re being such a baby, it can’t be that bad” Ame laughed softly, bringing her own mug to her lips. The reeking odor hit first her nose and then her taste buds. Ame’s eyes widened, spitting the drink back out. She grabbed a water bottle nearby, using it to wash over any remaining aftertaste in her tongue. “Ok, it is THAT bad. oh god WHY!”

Mori snickered, seeing her own friends so distraught about drinking her own stinky piss made this all worth it. But there was still someone left. “Heeeey Gura, surely you can appreciate my  amazing talen-”

“This is your pee, isn’t it?” Gura whispered to Mori’s ear, taking a sniff from her own mug. “It smells like it”

“Wha- No, no, no. Gura, I wouldn’t do th- ”

“Ehh I don’t mind. It’s kinda hotter this way.” Gura winked at Mori, flashing her own bratty smile to her. The shark girl tasted the Reaper’s urine like it was the first  she had drank in a month. Mori could audibly hear the shark girl passing down the drink to her stomach, blushing at how thoroughly she enjoyed the putrid taste of her piss combined with alcohol. It was certainly fun to see how the other girls were shaking in place after experiencing the fruits of her bladder, but Gura’s reaction was on a whole new level. This fucking brat finished the whole thing with a calm, collected look on her smug face!

“Ohhhh that is the stuff baby. Can I get a refill?” Gura exclaimed loudly, slamming the mug at the table. The shark girl gave her friends  a cocky look, mocking their failed efforts.

“Sure my dude, follow me. I’ll have a batch ready, just for you”.

“Yay!”

Mori and Gura left the table, walking towards the corridor. A degenerate smile on both of their faces. The remaining girls looked at each other with a puzzled frown, all thinking the same thing.

“Why are those two going to the bathroom?”
