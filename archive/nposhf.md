`ENTER: An immense, hulking dragon, his hide encrusted with shimmering obsidian scales. He is currently crouched in a forest, having flattened several trees and created a clearing in the process. He is fiddling with a small bow which his tiniest claw can only just barely fit into. The bowstring twangs as he attempts to shoot arrows at a small troupe of would-be bandits clustered against a tree. He has been trying and failing to do this for the past hour.`

`DRAGO: Bother.`

`His voice is fearsome. A vortex of foul-smelling breath washes over the bandits, who swallow and clutch at one another as DRAGO snaps the bowstring in frustration and tosses the ruined bow over his shoulder. His wings flex as he glares down at the bandits, who shudder at the sight.`

`DRAGO: Foul brigands. Do you surrender?`

`The bandits nod frantically.`

`DRAGO: Good. Are you going to come quietly?`

`The bandits nod frantically.`

`DRAGO: I'm new here, so you're going to have to bring me to the local sheriff, or headsman, or whatever they call them these days.`

`DRAGO coughs. The bandits watch, alarmed, as a plume of smoke escapes from its nostrils.`

`DRAGO: Not that I'd know. I'm but a callow human adventurer. I've only been around for, uh, four decades.`

`The BANDITS exchange confused glances. Their erstwhile LEADER clears his throat.`

`BANDIT LEADER: W-we can bring you there. To our village.`
`DRAGO: Don't lie to me, now. I'll know if you do.`
`BANDIT LEADER: Wouldn't d-dream of it. We deserve to be p-punished for our crimes.`
`DRAGO: Quite right. Quite right.`

`He glances over his shoulder.`

`DRAGO: Where's the, ah, person whom you were trying to rob?`
`BANDIT LEADER, hastily: Ran off. You n-needn't worry, milord. We'll confess to everything.`

`CUT TO: A small, nameless settlement on the island of Longlake. A tiny greeting committee has assembled on its outskirts to greet DRAGO as he lurches to meet them, prodding the bandits forward. The bandits stumble towards the village's ELDER, who is squinting down at them.`

`ELDER, quietly: What have you hooligans been up to?`

`The BANDIT LEADER throws himself at the ELDER's feet.`

`BANDIT LEADER, talking very quickly and quietly: You've got to help us, Elder. We were just out in the woods for a spot of fun when that dragon came and -`

`DRAGO clears his throat. The ELDER quickly steps in front of the bandits, who scramble out of view. As he stares, DRAGO reaches for a sack dangling around his neck and empties it out into the dirt. A small, glittering seal is at the top of the pile. DRAGO tries to pick it up, but is unable to due to the size and unwieldiness of his claws.`

`DRAGO: You will find that this seal declares me to be a member of the House of Draconis.`
`ELDER, faintly: I see.`
`DRAGO: My name is Drago Draconis. I am from the Kingdom of, uh, Nagaland. It's a very, very faraway kingdom. You've probably never heard of it.`
`ELDER: I see.`
`DRAGO: Will the bandits be punished?`
`ELDER: They will be - taken well in hand. And disciplined. By their parents.`
`DRAGO: Good.`

`He narrows his eyes at a small knot of children who have appeared a few paces behind the ELDER. They are staring.`

`DRAGO: And what are you looking at?`

`The ELDER turns and blanches, but it's too late. A BOY steps forward.`

`BOY: You're a dragon.`
`DRAGO: That's a secret, lad.`

`His voice is slightly softer, but not by much. The ELDER thinks that DRAGO might be trying to whisper. He is not doing a very good job of it.`

`ELDER, speaking louder in a bid to get DRAGO to refocus on him: In any case, Lord Draconis, we are thankful for this service that you have granted us, and are forever in your debt.`
`DRAGO: You're welcome.`
`ELDER: Please accept this small token of appreciation.`

`A man prods a sheep forward. DRAGO licks his lips unconsciously.`

`DRAGO: Why, that looks like quite a - meal. It might even be able to last me and my feeble human stomach about a fortnight. Or so.`

`He wraps one huge hand around the sheep and drags it over the dirt until it has disappeared behind his back.`

`DRAGO: My thanks, lad - I mean elder.`
`ELDER: You are welcome, Lord Draconis. Forgive my presumption, but have you an itinerary for your visit?`
`DRAGO: Oh, I thought I'd catch a few bandits and visit Longlake. The city, I mean.`
`ELDER: Do enjoy your stay, milord.`
`DRAGO: Thank you.`

`He gathers his things into the sack, loops it once more around his neck, and strolls nonchalantly into the woods before rising into the air and flying off. The ELDER watches him go.`

`BOY: That was a dragon, grandpa.`
`ELDER: Yes. Yes, it was.`
`BOY: I wanted to ride it.`

`The ELDER turns around and ruffles the BOY's hair.`

`ELDER: Dragons are dangerous, my boy. You'd do well not to get on their bad side, nor speak harsh truths to them. In any case, the beast is no longer our problem.`
