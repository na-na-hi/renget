#Detective Anon and the Werewolf

->Epilogue<-

->*Anon, Rory and the Light Side of the Moon*<-

Anon and Rory's relationship had grown over the years with each and every visit Anon went at the state prison, even with the incredibly high security for "potentially savage" werewolves. But it didn't stop them from growing not only as a couple, but as individuals. Anon had the pleasure of finally meeting Rory's father, Joshua, and finding out that he's a pretty cool guy and loves his son very much. So it didn't take long for them to bond. Their first and quite emotional visit, with Rory breaking down in front of them once he saw his father's bruised face. Joshua promised to visit whenever he could and Anon made sure to keep him up to date on visiting hours and dates.
In just a year, Anon had finally achieved control of his wolf form thanks to all the effort and the advice Rory gave him, Anon couldn't be happier. All he had to learn was speak English with his maw and the awesome ability to transform at will, like all other seasoned werewolves; and after some months of language classes for werewolves and finally being able to speak well enough, Anon was qualified to work as a wolf, even on nights on the full moon. Though some words were still difficult to say.

"It's harder than you think!", is what Anon would tell his coworkers at the station. He just wished they'd stop asking him to say hard words and then laugh, but growling usually shuts them up and Anon likes doing that anyways, so it works out. Though sometimes he wished changing at will didn't take so long, even though Rory has reassured him it's normal for it to take a while. But it just made Anon worry that he won't ever be able to change whenever he liked.

But nowadays Anon is never alone to try and achieve these things by himself. Not alone in the woods under the crisp light of the full moon, or alone in his own home. Rory has been free from prison for over a year for good behavior. In only five of his seven year sentence. After a reunion Anon could never forget, him in Rory's tight, loving embrace at the gate of the prison, the two finally have each other to spend all their time. And of course there was intense, hot werewolf sex once they got to Anon's house. Rory literally couldn't contain himself and lifted Anon off his feet as soon as the front door opened.

"I missed you so much!"
"I missed you too!", were the only exchange of words they had during Rory's obliteration on Anon's ass and mouth.

Life for the two of them couldn't be more blissful and simple. Anon had his important detective work handling different cases each month, and Rory is content with being Anon's trad husband for now. Like keeping the house clean. Tidying up the yards. Doing laundry. Making food. You know, ordinary werewolf husband stuff. Although Rory has had thoughts about a possible career in the police force and something else; something for Anon.
They spend nights on the full moon together in the woods fucking around doing werewolf things, and also fucking. Some nights they would just spend alone together at home. Anon's favorite thing they did together as wolves was sitting on Rory's crossed legs, lean back against his huge, furry chest and listen to each beastly breath. Time seemed to move slowly or at all during those beautifully quiet moments.

Anon has been in the slumps lately because of how he hadn't been able to fully change into a wolf without the moon. It has been four whole years since he gained control, yet cannot fully change at will. But today Rory is visiting his father to 'discuss something important that only him and his dad should talk about'. But that only made him feel more isolated. Rory did text Anon that he'd be home by the end of the day, but Anon wished he was at home waiting to help him. If there's one werewolf that could teach Anon, it's Rory.
The sun was setting, turning half the sky orange, it was a slow day at the station and Anon was getting ready to head home. Just as he was out the front entrance he noticed Nancie and Erik talking, until they noticed him.
"Hey Anon, you leavin' for today?" Nancie said. Anon didn't feel like talking to anyone and just wanted to get home and wait for Rory.
"Yeah, it was a slow day." Anon said, he just watched Youtube and listened to podcasts all day in his office. Just when his hand was over the handle of his car door, Erik spoke.
"Anon, you doin' okay?" he said making Anon flinch with annoyance.
"Yeah.. yeah. Just gonna head home, eat and then sleep." and then Anon got in his car, turned it on, and drove away as quickly as he possibly could. The sky was getting darker and while driving under the rows of orange, hypnotic streetlights, Anon knew in the back of his mind that Erik and Nancie were probably just worried about him.
But who cares. The trouble Anon was going through isn't their problem, nor would they understand. They weren't werewolves. But now that he thought about it, Rory was the only werewolf in the city back then. Up until now that is.

Anon finally reached his house. There was half a sub in the fridge and some soda left, so that'll be dinner and then it's straight to bed. It also doesn't help the fact that Rory still isn't home, even though he can smell his scent all around like he was. When Anon got to the front door and opened it, he was suddenly swept off his feet and was being bride carried by two huge, muscular, furry, jet-black arms!
"H-holy shit, Rory!!" Anon adjusted himself in Rory's big ass arms to get comfortable, "You almost made me reach for my gun."
"Heh, did you really?" Rory said with a giant grin on his face. His gorgeous face and that big smile so close to his own, Anon could feel his blood to the tip of his wolfy ears.
"W-well no, but.." Anon tried to gather himself and his words "It could've happened. But, uh.. welcome home" Anon put his hands on Rory's face and gave him a well needed kiss, making Rory's face lit up with joy.
"Oh!" Rory popped "I forgot, I bought pizza", Anon looked over to the kitchen, and there it was, a huge stack of at least eight large pizzas. Four for each of them. "I made sure to get your favorite toppings too." Anon seriously couldn't love Rory more than he did right now.
After that huge dinner, (though it still surprises Anon that he can eat so much) and the two retelling their day to each other, Rory thought it time to start with the main event for today.
"So... You ready Anon?" Rory said and Anon felt his heart skip a beat. Though Anon didn't say anything, Rory knew how much all this was troubling him and he wanted to be as gentle as he can with him. Anon nodded, "Ok, let's go."

They both headed to the forest which was consumed in darkness, with only the stars, and the crescent moon with the only source of light. This is usually where Anon trains himself to transform into a wolf at will. Though he had a sinking pit in his stomach all the way, and dreaded that this time will be like all the other times he's tried. But Rory was determined to keep Anon motivated. They arrived at their usual spot, which was a small open area in the middle of the forest. Rory looked up at the thin crescent moon and spoke.
"Okay so just-" as soon as he turned around, Anon already had his closed his eyes, standing still ready to begin. He knew the drills well enough. Anon was emptying his mind for concentration but in the very back of his consciousness, he expected that he wouldn't make any progress. It's been five whole years since becoming a werewolf and while he has gained some things here and there; not being able to become a wolf whenever he wanted was seriously something that ate him inside.
But what difference does it make now?
Why would it be different this time?
Why can't it be different?
Anon realized he's making stuff up and now it was hard just to clear his head. But just then, Anon felt Rory right in front of him and then said
"Anon.. no matter what happens tonight, I still love you and you'll still be a werewolf." suddenly, Anon's pessimistic thoughts vanished. As he reflected on those words he could feel them filling him up, giving him warmth. It was like a protective charm; a powerful ward.
"He's right' Anon thought to himself, "I'm not gonna give up. Not when Rory believes in me!" and then Anon found himself with newfound determination.
Anon relaxed and then thought to himself; what is it that he liked about being a werewolf?
Everything.
My claws. My fur. My fangs. The power. The transformation. All of it.
Anon concentrated hard on those feelings and suddenly; he opened his eyes and saw that his hands, or frankly, his claws growing before him. It wasn't just his claws but his arms too. He could feel them getting longer, bigger and furry!
Just as his arms were done transforming it seemed that that was it. It was only Anon's arms that changed completely, aside from some fur all over his chest under his shirt; and his feet! They felt tight in his shoes. It seems they changed a bit too! It may only be less than what Anon had hoped, but he could care less because in that moment he's finally made progress! Some real, visual, progress. After all those years and after all those attempts that went nowhere, he is finally on the road to completely change into a wolf, without the moon.

Anon was ecstatic. He almost couldn't take his eyes off his claws, but when he looked up he saw Rory in his wolf form looking down at him, absolutely beaming.
"I knew you could do it!" he said jubilantly 
"Thanks... for saying that, Rory." Anon said not wanting to take his eyes off of Rory's, "What you said before.. it helped." Anon put his paws onto Rory's furry stomach and eventually gave him a hug; and Rory envelopes him, forming a warm, tight, furry hug. Rory kept staring down at Anon, so close to him, and figured it was 'time'.
"Anon" he said timidly "I've got a surprise for you. I... was gonna wait till your birthday next week but I.. Just follow me." and so Rory went running ahead fast and Anon followed surprisingly quick.

Rory was standing atop a slope, his back towards the black sky and the hundreds of tiny stars all glittering behind him. Anon forgets that the woods are Rory's favorite place to stargaze due to the small light pollution, letting farther stars and objects visible to the naked eye. Perhaps they should have date/stargazing trip here. Rory would love that, especially after everything he's done for him, he deserves that much and more. Though, Anon wondered what Rory's surprise is and why he couldn't wait till his birthday which was only a week away.
Anon reached by his side where he stood. Both of them stood silently for a moment; then Rory took Anon's hands gently in his giant claws. Anon always loved the size difference between them, making his heart thump. Then, while Anon's heart kept pounding, it got even more flustered as Rory suddenly went on one knee.

?!?!?!?!?

"Anon" Rory said softly "Do you wanna get married?", and there it was, those coveted words. Anon never believed in his entire existence that he would ever hear those words and actually be meant for him. Hell, Anon just now noticed how tall Rory is while on one-
'Fuck it' he thought to himself.
"Yes" Anon said "Yes! Yes!" and Rory's small smile became a giant, fang-filled smile. Then Rory quickly let out a long and hearty howl, and Anon joined too.
"Anon, you just made me the happiest wolf in the whole fucking world!" Rory exclaimed and he lifted Anon in furry embrace and twirled around. Anon could literally feel love, thick in the air around them. "Oh Anon, I swear things will be better from here on out, and I'll always protect you! I promise!" he said. Anon believed every word Rory said. There's honestly no one in the world he'd rather spend and share his whole life with other than Rory.
"I know you will. And I promise to always be there with you and love you." Anon said caressing Rory's mane. "Sooo.. now what?" now that they both have said their pieces, Rory quickly spoke.
"Oh! Um.. I know I don't have a ring or anything." he said bashfully "But I do have 'something'! And this'll be very cheesy." Anon wondered what on earth he meant by that. "Look up there." Rory said looking at the star filled sky and then he pointed out.

He was pointing at the silvery, crescent moon.

"That's it. Right there." he said
"Heh. It's not that cheesy." Anon said trying to be honest "Well, maybe a little. But.. it's very you. I love it." then Anon lifted his left lycan arm, pointed out his ring finger and then curled it a little to make it seem like the moon was on his finger. Rory gave support with his own and gently grasped Anon's paw. Anon definitely felt like things couldn't be better. It's almost surreal. Just a few years ago Rory was on the wrong side of the law, chased by Anon for a whole month and then spend the next whole month together hiding while waiting for the full moon. How little they knew that they would eventually be each others beloved.
After they both left the forest, Rory promised Anon he'll get him a proper engagement ring. But till then, the crescent moon will do for now; and while walking back home, holding paws together, Anon thought of something.
Rory and the moon are kind of similar. They both followed you everywhere. They both have different forms and they both shine light upon Anon's world. Except now that light is Anon's fiancé. But that's enough cheesiness. 
That "light" is Rory, my werewolf husband.
