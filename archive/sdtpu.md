->Out of Place, Just in time<-

The Outlaw puts a new cylinder in her revolver as the angel walks beside her, the naturally beautiful boy keeping her company as they sit in the cabin of a river boat the Outlaw was boarding in search of a better life in the east. They walk to the small cabin as the angel offers to clean her clothes, letting the outlaw rest. She awakes after seemingly no time has passed, a white dress with a high collar and corset at the waist in the style of a well-to-do lady's dress laying at the foot of the bed. The outlaw puts her dress on with the angel's help as he compliments her beauty, putting her cartridge belt and holster on over her thin waist.

The Outlaw looks more proper, but her face remains marked with stoic anger as they step off into the smokey gray city the other passengers drudge into. It is designed with the trappings of traditional architecture; its streets both too wide and too thin as motor cars and horse-drawn carriages compete for space in the loud and irritating city. The Outlaw's ears hate this noise, her nose is disgusted by the smell of fermented civilization, and she pulls her hat down to shadow her eyes as she carries her handbag to the lodging house that her angel had found.

As they arrive at the dirty lodging house, the two spread their meager possessions out. The angel wraps the Outlaw in his wings as he assures her that she can find success here, even as her mind and body are both repulsed by the environment.

The next day, she finds work as a copyist, writing down newspaper articles that are translated from some hard-to-read language into English. Her only task is to keep copying with good penmanship, even as her wrist aches and she has to bounce her leg to let off the need for her to move. She's not even allowed to leave the building during lunch as the other women split into their own groups, with the new girl being excluded for her western looks and subpar performance. The break is too long for the meager lunch the Outlaw brought, as she feels her gun at her hip while watching the supervisor extort employment and residence fees from the other women. She could kill this scumbag, take the money, and never have to work here again. It would be a morally good action, right? Punishing the guilty was an act of virtue, right?

Her angel flies up to the window she was sitting by and notices where her hand hovers. "I know your intentions are good, but your method is one that will hurt more people in the process. If you simply talk to him and tell him why he's wrong for extorting them, he will listen in time."

The Outlaw takes a deep breath, gathering her skirts and heading toward the man. She looks him in the eye and shakes her head, refusing to pay him as the other women follow suit.

![Sally's Apartment](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120757721881391175/1120757932368338984/Gun_Nun_Apartment.jpg)
(Music: https://youtu.be/_9-SgkvM8Mw )
Sally wakes up and has a harder time than usual coaxing herself out of bed as the bright summer sun shines into her apartment. It was just after exams, and she had summer classes since she was so behind in terms of her Japanese. She had managed in her other classes, but reading the symbols that made up the Japanese language and knowing their types still made the girl's brain melt. If nothing else, she could at least express her frustration vocally in a way that her teachers could understand in Japanese.

She leans up as she notices the Japanese western on her lap, dog-earing the page she was on and reading her devotional. The verse was Colossians 3, Verses 12 and 13.

"Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.  Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

Sally smiles at the peaceful prose of the Bible as she combs her hair and brushes her teeth, her short-skirted uniform going on as she is at least allowed to leave the stuffy, orange-lined jacket at home. Her bag was packed with her books, school supplies, and a snack as she looked down the tube-shaped cavities that were her arms. It was so easy to just see them as normal compared to the mutants in her class alone, yet they were immeasurably lethal. Desolator's words from the woods in July still stuck with her. She had no face to put to his name, but her slapdash research revealed that she was in fact being scouted by an internationally wanted assassin.

At the same time, those words festered like poison, with the demonic side of Sally wanting to use them as a reason to give up all of this and learn to use her quirk in a way she already knew how. Her heart raced as she fought a mental war, interrupted only by a creaking footstep outside her door.

Her instincts took over for a moment as she loaded a pepperball round and approached the door, peering through it to see a blonde boy in a tailored suit walking away. He had left a package for her: some kind of white robe thing with flower and bird patterns in a soft gray, with a big belt in the package alongside it.

Sally narrows her eyes as she waits for Inigo to be gone for sure, then pulls the package into her apartment. She had enough time to open it and see that it was... traditional Japanese summer clothes, longer and broader than normal to fit a foreigner's frame. Sally growls as she imagines a million evil and perverted ways Inigo must have stolen her measurements as she threw them on her bed and headed to school to learn her moon runes.

!!! note 
    NoAA1633: Good Morning! Noah received a gift today, and was wondering if you did too.
    Patroit1776: Morning. A Kimono or whatever their called right?
    NoAA1633: Yeah, My mom can help you put it on if you want to go to the festival thats coming up. Noah will wear his so we don't look out of place.
    Patriot1776: I don't feel like it, honestly. This all reeks of somekind of setup since I saw Inigo putting the package at my door.  He's probably got some dumb prank planned if we show up looking like matching lovebirds, or Hoge's trying to catch us as lovebirds so we can be the only couple punished for it.
    NoAA1633: Its not in Inigo's nature to do mean things like that.  Think it over please, I'm sure he spent alot of money to get both of us matching   clothes and Noah doesn't want to just let that go to waste, unless your really not comfortable with it. 

Noah looked toward Inigo as they both stared toward the angel boy's phone inside his pristinely cleaned room, save for a few white feathers that had fallen to the floor.

"Noah is thankful for the chance to wear matching clothes with Sally, but if she's not comfortable with it, it wouldn't be right to push her into it."

Inigo shakes his head. "It would be a bigger sin to let love as pure as the kind between you and Sally go to waste. A festival scene is crucial for a good ending, especially with a girl like Sally. She'll need someone to encourage her to have fun and show her gentler side."

Noah looks at his phone and processes the advice he was being given, as Gigan looks at the phone as well, awaiting Sally's response with the same baited breath as Inigo. The angel boy did want to see Sally have a good time and relax. She was being pushed hard by the school thanks to the constant combat lessons and her poor uptake of written Japanese. A night amongst the stalls and shooting games would help her clear her head, and Inigo had insisted Noah was the only person who could get her out of her apartment.

He looked toward his angelic white yukata, with gentle birds and flowers in grey, and imagined Sally in hers, her long brown hair up in hair sticks with an obi tied under her chest and her sleeves draping down. He imagined her giving a gentle smile as he awaited her response with the patience of a saint.

1 hour later...

!!! note 
    Patriot1776: What kind of stuff is even at these 
	NoAA1633: Carnival games with masks, food, and stuffed animals as prizes. They have airgun shooting galleries that I think you'd like alot!
	Patriot1776: And your sure Hoge won't be there stalking us?
	NoAA1633: Of course. I hear she'll have her own obligations to attend to at the festival anyways.
	Patriot1776: Fine. I'll come over after my classes end so your mom can help me into this thing.
	NoAA1633: I'll make sure were ready for you.

Noah breathed a sigh of relief as Inigo and Gigan high-fived each other. "See? Like a lot of tsunderes, you just have to draw them out of their shell with a good time, and they'll be more open with their feelings."

The angel boy's wings couldn't help but flit about as he awaited his date and learned the layout of the stalls.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sally arrived at Noah's door, true to her word, right after her remedial classes. He's greeted by the boy in his own Yukata, waving toward her.
"{Noah's mom wanted to know if you brought your own makeup," he asks as he lets her in, the girl watching the folds of his outfit and biting her lip, eyes sparkling.

"{Y-Yeah, I got your call earlier about it...}" she says as she looks at the boy's cute red eyes.

Noah's mom comes down the stairs and waves toward Sally. "{Hi!}" she says in English.

"Hello, Abrams-san," Sally says with her best, most polite Japanese, causing the woman to blush at the formality.

"McCathy-San, would you mind following me? I'll help you into your outfit since yukatas can be difficult to put on," the woman says as she grabs Sally's wrist.

Sally blushes red as Noah gives her an encouraging smile. The boy's mother leads the gun nun upstairs and assists her in dressing like a traditional Japanese maiden.

As Noah sits in the living room with his father, watching the crowds of people heading to the festival, the angel's mother claps to get the boy's attention. "Come on, take small steps, or the obi can come undone," she whispers to the girl around the corner, who finally reveals herself. The grey and silver embroidery of her yukata follow her body like an artful tattoo as the sleeves down, her borrowing a drawstring bag to carry her things like she's seen some of the reenactors carry around Kyoto. The angelic white fabric highlights her soft, dark walnut eyes as her long hair is tied up in a double bun decorated with her usual owl feather hairtie and one kanzashi in blue and red on each side.

Sally blushes as Noah stands up and gets a good look at her, quickly smiling toward her. "You look very pretty, Sally. Are you ready to go?"

Sally smiles shyly and looks to his parents for permission, who smile with affirmation. "Yes, please," she says as Noah holds her hand and the couple follow the crowd.

![Festival Background](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1120757721881391175/1120799311790358649/Festival.jpg)
(Music: https://youtu.be/81hMNt451AQ )
The festival was nothing like Sally has ever seen: A local event with the population of a city arriving and enjoying the simple pleasures of carnival stalls, which included weird games like goldfish scooping that she was terrible at but Noah seemed to have a good hand at as he insisted they keep the fish for another child to win. Sally was more attracted to the "rigged" shooting games; she was eager to use BB pellets to shoot down, and she could easily tell when someone was trying to swindle her with a nailed-down plushy of Majestic or Localoca. Noah didn't seem to have her eye for shooting.

"{We should go find a firing range so you can get some practice. You still have to know to aim for your quirk.}"

"{Noah's not sure a gun range is... the right place to train that,}" he says with a humerous tone.

Sally giggles as she holds onto her large haul of prizes: "{Come ooooon, let me teach you something for once? You help me enough with my homework... It's only fair I teach you something I know really well.}"

The two look at each other, their faces getting close for a moment, before someone bumps into them, spoiling the moment.

"{Noah needs to find a bathroom; I'll meet you back here,}" he says as Sally nods, the boy flying above the crowd in the civilian airspace looking for a place to relieve himself.

Sally takes on another shooting game, this time with pop-up targets and point-based targets. An old man takes the air rifle beside her and waits for the girl to finish the run she was on. A high score of 350 points, which amazes the propietor as he fishes up the top prize for the girl: A cuddly bear backpack with a zipper for a mouth.

The old man then crushes her score, taking shots at double the rate with more accuracy, achieving the maximum possible score of 700.

"Keep the prize, please," he says as his voice reminds Sally of someone, a dark specter in her mind.

"{You know, Miss McCathy, you're hesitating with your shots,}" Desolater says as he looks down on the girl with his aged face.

Sally scowls, her makeup-adorned face still looking pretty as well as angry, as she steps closer to him. "{I would advise against a 9mm. You have much to learn about body armor and how to defeat it,}" he says as the two walk.

Sally rechambers the round; the metallic sound of a lead slug only audible to the gun nuts. "{Still hesitating, even with your boyfriend; you're not firing when you should, so to speak.}"

"{You fucking creep! Why are you stalking me? I'm not taking your offer!}" Sally whisper-screams at him.

"{I'm here on contract, actually. Damage control in case a certain charge gets too... enthusiastic tonight.}"

"{There's... going to be an attack!?}" Sally says, shocked and angry that her perfect romantic festival date is going to become a battlefield.

"{It's likely. I only tell you because you'll figure it out anyway.}"

Sally puts her hand against the soft body armor the old man wears over his vital organs. "{And how do you plan on escaping after you take that shot?}"

The girl looks at her Yukata, which is long and restrictive for running, and the thousands of people around, in addition to the predicted police presence.

"{If you wanted me dead, you should have found me somewhere clear of witnesses, with many sightlines, and with a prepared escape vehicle, with another car ready to switch to before you reach the safehouse. As it stands, you would be no more than an attempted mass shooter who simply attracts the force of the law onto yourself with an impulsive act of wrath rather than a planned and precise fulfillment of a contract.}" Desolater says, imparting a lesson onto Sally as she growls, bringing her hand down and unloading the rifle round.

"{I must take my leave. Good luck getting your angel. I doubt he'll make the first move forward,}" he says as he melts into the crowd with a practiced, comfortable walk.

Sally sits down as she sees Noah looking around for her, rejoining him as she shakes the experience off, something she hopes the boy can't see her anxiety over. Noah can, but chooses to keep the observation to himself as they get takoyaki.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, they both get a text in the group chat:

!!! note 
    IniGOAT: Yooo people  are DROWNING themselves in EAST POND. BEHIND THE RAFFLE STORE. VILLAIN??? NEED HELP!! HURRY!!!

Sally and Noah leapt into action as they set their prizes down and rushed to stop the people from drowning themselves. Noah flew and lifted them out of the east pond, while Sally fired off loud rounds to signal them away and get them away like a ballistic sheepdog. Her shouting in mostly intelligible Japanese strained her voice, and she wished she had brought ear protection like she usually did, but that's just the kind of sacrifice that heroes make.

Noah made explaining to the police that she was not an active shooter easy as they presented their student IDs, being let off of any noise complaints for clearly having helped the situation, even if the police frowned on Sally's uniquely patriotic way of wrangling the clearly enthralled individuals.

"{I was firing blanks; how many times should I have to make it clear before a COP understands that?}" Sally complains as they walk off, noticing people finding spots for the fireworks show.

"{They were doing their best, Sally. Gun knowledge is less common than it is in Montana, even among the police, so let's not be too hard on them for not understanding the distinction.}" Noah says in his usual saintly and patient voice.

Sally smiles as they find a spot on an overlooking hill, free from most people. The two sit down beside each other as Sally puts an arm around Noah's shoulder and draws him right next to her.  In return, Noah wraps his soft wings around Sally, the two warming up against the night's cool breeze, cuddled together in a gentle, feathery embrace. As the fireworks light up the night sky, they look into each other's eyes, and the couple seem to get the same idea.

It's just one kiss on the cheek from Noah, but Sally takes it a step further. "{Can we... kiss for real?}" she asks.

Noah blushes a deep, beet red along with Sally as the question remains in the air, but he nods.

A firework bursts behind the two as Sally presses her lips to Noah's for a few seconds. The sensation shocks both of them, as this was a gesture of lovers in movies when they were sure to get married...

Not that it really bothered either of them that they set that up.
