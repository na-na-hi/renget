#World(building) Of Ass Supremacy

##Where we imagine a world where ass is best.

This is an archive of the ideas that pop up in the World Of Ass Supremacy thread, so people can easily find them and be inspired to continue them (First of hopefully many [here](https://desuarchive.org/d/thread/10835247/))

Don't be afraid and have fun! Even if you aren't a proficient wordsmith, any and all ass ideas are welcome, as long as they come out on top.

I'm currently writing the set-up for a series of stories based around a party of four adventurers. The hero, Isabelle, gets addicted to eating mana buns in the tutorial area and ends up with an ass fat enough to defeat most enemies just by sitting on them. This overpowered weapon changes the course of the realm's history.
There's a sadistic mage who sees the hero's butt as a ticket to easy riches and sadistically enjoys watching Isabelle squash the experience and gold coins out of their enemies. There's a stick-in-the-mud Sage who is constantly mortified on behalf of the bandits, goblins, gnomes, and witches that have to experience getting atomically flattened. And then there's the Rogue, who hates the whole party and tries to break away to do her own thing, but always ends up getting squashed by the dopey hero.

I'm trying to think of some fun 'episodes' around this theme that would make for some good butt-squash/gts/facesitting material. If anyone has any ideas, I would love some more material to play around with. So far I've got...

- The adventurers are sent to help a village of fairies deal with a problem, but the hero accidentally sits on the village and smooshes every inhabitant into her asscrack. The party get lost in the woods, and an increasingly athletic series of trials for the hero result in an increasingly squishy set of circumstances for her butt prisoners.
- The hero goes to learn a subclass, and unknowingly teaches all of her class trainers and fellow pupils how to use their butts as a weapon.
- A group of bandits try to ambush the hero from inside a treasure chest, but she accidentally falls in and fills up the chest with her cheeks. The entire village has to come together to figure out how to get her ass unstuck and release the poor criminals from her undersides.
- In a far away land, a supervillain hears from her advisor about the hero's unorthodox new fighting style. She decides to try it for herself, practicing on her own minions.

>- The hero gets captured and thrown in jail, handcuffed to her own party member, the rogue. Unfortunately for the rogue, she's stuck face-first against the party leader's ass, flattened like a forgotten, crumpled note. The haughty hero spends the whole episode complaining more about her own minor inconveniences while the Rogue can only add the occasional grumble or grunt from her badunk.
>- The moralistic sage, sick of seeing the mage encourage Isabelle's unheroic way of fighting, decides to get revenge on her own party member, and give her a taste of her own medicine. Cue an extended facesitting sequence in which the shy blonde on top is apologizing to her own party member, while chiding her for her immoral behavior.

>- A cute young blonde merchant girl is inspired by the hero and decides to embark upon her first quest. She travels the low-level forest with a picture of a specific goblin in her pocket, politely asking the locals if they have seen the green creature.
>I think it would be fun to write a dual-perspective story, one of the girl and one of the goblin. Imagine the local cute merchant girl turning around and looming over you like this. You're about to be buried by her ass for god-knows-how-long, but for her, this is just a fun and exciting new hobby.

>The hero Isabelle meets an enemy class that she can't one-tap using her normal butt attacks and has to develop some new moves to take them down. This leads to her accidentally creating and refining an entire ass based martial art.
>Tales of the hero have travelled to a big alchemist city, inspiring the inhabitants to develop a series of potions and tinctures designed to increase the size and strength of their own butts. Cue the leader of the city challenging the hero to an ass duel.

>>Ass expansion is definitely something I want to play around with, the potion/alchemy idea is awesome. In the first story, the hero levels up while she's sitting on an enemy and the stat points go right to her ass, her panties ripping apart at the seems and her cheeks swelling and expanding all while an enemy is trapped beneath her booty. It would be fun to do a story from the perspective of the villains when an entire city of young potion-brewing witches get ass-expanding powers and a sense of DIY butt justice.
>>The butt-based martial arts idea would pair well with my subclass idea. Maybe the thing that inspires the hero to seek out the mountainous monk maidens is a villain she can't crush, but at the end of the story she returns with a squad of caked-up tomboys and they butt-judo the villain's entire squad into a writhing mass of pancakes.

>- The hero saves a village from a horde of goblins by crushing them beneath her ass. As thanks, the villagers immortalize her with a statue… of her ass, crushing the life out of some poor goblins. The heroine is somewhat embarrassed, butt the village girls are inspired, and start practicing for the day that they too can battle evil with their oversized derrières.
>- Laundry duty is a pain when you’ve got to clean the heroines giga-panties, stinking from a week of hot, sweaty exercise.
>- Heroine sits on some people, they get stuck in her ass for god knows how long. By the time they’re finally freed (or maybe farted free), they’ve become so traumatized that they cope by literally worshiping her ass as a kind of vengeful, hungering deity that must be placated, lest it comes for you. The cult of the Heroines ass spreads, often finding fertile ground in areas the heroine has already been to. Followers have a small ass-shaped talisman that they keep with them at all times.
>>How long before Isabelle the colossal caboose heroine ends up getting her cheeks chomped by a Mimic unable to even clamp its jaws around her wide load?

>I have a dumb idea about a Gulliver's Travel's scenario. Heroine sits on a stump because she's tired. The stump collapses under her weight because its a colony of tiny people. Then the tiny people tie the heroine to the ground with rope and stakes. And she has to find a way to negotiate with these tiny people.

>>Like from the tiny people's perspective they'd be worshipping a giant assed giantess? That could make for some fun descriptions
>>Her ass would form a gigantic crater (relatively speaking) that would look as though a meteor had struck

>>>Its more likey they want to keep giant ass from crushing other people's homes. Perhaps there's a way to replace the little people's houses.
>>>Also imagine the ropes sinking into her glorious ass as she's tied face down.

######Lilliputs
So about the lilliput idea. I wonder if its possible to build a lilliput village on the hero's butt. It can be part of a skirt/armor that she can remove in case she has to swim. The lilliput people can also develope a symbiotic relationship with the hero's butt to clean it, heal it if it gets hurt, to repair armor, and to defend it with lilliput siege weapons. What started out as an accident that destroyed the lilliput people's homes turns into a friendship with the hero selflessly fulfilling the liliput people's needs and the lilliput people repaying with kindness. Eventually they learn how to bake the hero's favorite sweet mana buns that makes her butt bigger. Which means more village space. Thoughts?

>Sounds good to me, like a bunch of little people get to actively work with and worship a huge thicc goddess in their eyes
>Offering food as tribute to help make her even thiccer

>>They don't woship her right off the bat. First the hero helps find building materials. Then the lilyputs get invaded by frogs. Hero uses her butt as sanctuary to keep the lilyputs off the ground so the frogs don't get them. Then the lilyputs decide to claim the hero's butt as their sanctuary and build a temple above her butt. Now hero has a small army of two-hundred ten centimeter tall people on her upper butt to take care of. Fortunately human inn food has more than enough portions to feed the entire lillyput village.

####Casste System

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1683/13/1683134331892.png)

Well obviously in this seat based society, there should be a system in place to help organise the women by sizes or other rump features. We shall call it the “Casste System”
>So basically Manyuu Hikenchou but with women being in power depending on the size of their booty?

>Not that anon, but I was thinking like...
>High class asses are ones that demand the biggest and largest of thrones, with broken benches and big houses with wide doorways (that better get wider and wider to accomodate such wide girthy hips). They're the ones who get all the riches, the attention, the status, the fame.
>If a woman can still fit into a regularly sized chair, then she's seen as not seen as desirable or anything in such a society. So, women are encouraged to eat and eat and stuff themselves to aim for such lofty, curvy ideals.

>>A Casste system is a funny idea. Whether it's a real formally-enforced class hierarchy, or just an instinctive social pecking order. Either way, a healthy bit of ass envy and ass smugness is likely typical when two girls with a significant size difference interact.

######How to Rise Through the Ranks

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1665/08/1665083533925.png)

I wonder what girls with small butts would do in this society to gain a bigger butt and gain an advantage in this Ass Supremacy Universe.

>Well, there's the old fashioned way of just eating a lot.
>Or, maybe plastic surgery could exist in such a world, but like, done so well that it's near indistinguishable from real asses, just that it obviously costs a bit.
>>The war between the naturally grown and the surgically augmented asses has raged on over social media for decades.
>>>Some say natural or nothing, others say plastic is the way to go... but surely a third camp can agree that as long as it's big, that's all that really matters.

####Christmas OL
![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1604/11/1604119503367.jpg)

I want to write a fun ass-themed short story, but I haven’t quite found a good enough setup just yet. Somebody give me something to work with over the holiday break.

>The holidays are good for that, actually-- just write about a lady who ate a LOT over the holidays and now her pants and skirts don't fit
>She's gotta still go to work, or maybe she goes to the mall to find something that does fit, either way, big assed shenanigans can ensue

>>Maybe it could be about a christmas office party, the resident big assed OL gets too drunk and starts bumping everyting over, accidentally hip-checking her coworkers, face sitting her junior, etc.

>>Big booty OL shopping for photocopiers that can handle her weight in anticipation for the office Christmas party

>>>She stars dangling a mistletoe if front of her butt, the decoration slowly embedding itself between the two wobbling orbs.
>>>"Loohk anon!~ hic There is a mishletoe here! You now the rulesh~"

>>Now I'm just thinking more about a big booty OL. Multiple even, just picture how cramped elevator rides would be with 'em. Said elevators would have to be akin to freight elevators too, stuff that can handle a lot of heavy weight.

>>- start office job
>>- ride elevator with at least two women
>>- elevator is barely enough to handle just the three of you
>>- you would be squished up against the wall
>>- or sandwiched between all that butt
>>- the ladies arrive at their floor, you're still waiting for your stop
>>- suddenly the boss, or a boss, or someone higher up
>>- an even wider, phatter, thiccer lady
>>- whose administrative ass fills up the elevator entirely
>>- you're not just pressed up against the wall, your whole body is squished up against such a massive pantsuit
>>- elevator jam
>>- "damnit, I could've sworn we had this fixed, I'll be late for the 11:00 meeting!"
>>- you are stuck
>>- "huh? oh, you better get comfy, the technicians are gonna have to take the stairs"
>>- all you can do is just wait, and wait, and weight

>>>- Taking elevator to go deliver some documents
>>>- door opens a few floors early
>>>- a very upset and very wide coworker storms inside
>>>- she doesn't even notice you
>>>- you try to alert her of your presence
>>>- slams her fat ass against the wall
>>>- you are pinned
>>>- once the doors close, she start yelling
>>>- "Jessica's ass is only two inches bigger than mine. I should have gotten that promotion. This is such bullshit!"
>>>- every stomp makes her enormous cheeks jiggle
>>>- You are stuck listening to her complain while she unknowingly smothers you

####Modern Day Sorcerass
![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1702/83/1702838493721.jpg)


- a clumsy voluptuous sorceress accidentally tears open a time portal and ends up in the modern era
- she's trying her best to acclimate to her new life
- the main issue is that none of the clothing stores have panties big enough to fit her massive ass
- on one such occasion, she asks a meek department store employee to wait outside the changing room and hand her the largest pairs of underwear they have in stock
- as the employee passes her a new pair, a stray bolt of magic snaps off the sorceress' body and transforms the employee into a pair of panties
- the sorceress then tries to put them on, complaining about how tight they are and how her ass basically swallows them up
- all while the poor employee silently suffers the stuffiness and booty sweat of her obnoxious customer

>kind of off topic for this thread but I think this is a great concept for a general fetish / slice-of-life story

>- Sorceress from a now extinct race of Antediluvian humans accidentally transports herself tens of thousands of years into the future
>- Doesn't know how to go back in time so she has to start a life in the modern world
>- Sticks out everywhere she goes due to her height, exotic complexion and ridiculously curvy body
>- Not to mention the whole "wielder of forgotten magic" thing
>- She ends up living with an anthropology PhD student who's basically her opposite in every way; shy, short, nerdy, plain
>- In exchange for lodging and guidance she tells the college girl all kinds of esoteric knowledge and lost history to help with her research
>- Technology interferes with her magic in unexpected ways, leading to kinky shenanigans (transformation, shrinking, growth, etc) alongside normal shenanigans
>- The sorceress comes to appreciate some aspects of modern life, like air conditioning, coffee, memory foam mattresses, ice cream, and electric lighting
>- But modern standards of dress are something she will probably never get used to
>- Even the most elastic yoga pants feel too confining; and baggy sweats are drab and inelegant
>- Her immense, chair-breaking derriere is a symbol of her noble blood and magical prowess; it just shouldn't be restrained by anything more than a sheet of silk
>- Nevertheless her friend and hostess insists she needs some properly fitting clothes
>- It doesn't help that the definition of "properly fitting" changes weekly
>- All those caramel macchiatos and pints of haagen-dazs have a habit of going straight to her hips...
>- So one weekend the pair goes on a shopping trip together
>- It goes about as well as you'd expect (panty transformation scenario but it's the college girl instead of an employee)
>- Sorceress quickly realizes what happened, but her "new panties" are so comfortable she decides to leave her friend transformed until they get home

>I played around with this idea some more and made a little image sequence
>Additional lore:

>- The Antediluvian humans are a matriarchal culture with magic-wielding sorceresses as the ruling class
>- Men mostly do demanding physical jobs that can't easily be aided by magic, but the highest caste of men are scholars and historians>>- They are highly respected by other castes (including the sorceresses) but aren't allowed to directly control anything outside the libraries
>- Higher caste women tend to be more curvy but it's not a universal rule
>- As a result, high caste women who are petite are often teased about it by their peers
>- Having a pear-shaped figure is an especially important status symbol among sorceresses
>- For them, a plump rear is a sign of a woman's connection to the goddess of magic (a lost deity that later cultures approximated as Inanna/Ishtar)
>- Needless to say, worship of a lady's ass is fairly common, both in formal religious ceremonies and more casual or sexual contexts
>- Figurines or icons of a woman's lower body are commonly used as decorations or charms, similar to how Romans used phallic symbols
>- When our Sorceress meets her roommate, she's initially confused as to what a woman is doing studying history
>- Eventually she figures that since the girl is as flat as a man, it's not that strange for her to do a man's job
>- The Sorceress is used to having servants around who would gladly do whatever she wanted
>- In the accursed future, she only has her roommate to rely on
>- While she does respect the girl for her knowledge and intelligence, it's all too easy for her to slip back into a dominant attitude

####The Rumpire

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1703/89/1703893546354.jpg)


Alright, I don't actually know anything about vampires or anything, buttttt

- A rumpire that lives in a huge ass castle from centuries ago mostly because it's the only place big enough to house her huge ass
- But she does need sustenance, every drop of blood she sucks keeps her looking youthful or whatever, but it also phattens up and plumps up that rear
- So having lived for hundreds and hundreds of years, her ass is ginormous, and she'd like, lure in victims somehow, feasts on their blood, and leaves them for dead
- Maybe her victims are lead into the castle for one reason or another, and she feigns being a good host, and because it's so dark in the castle, it always looks like there's a large shadow following this thicc vampire, it's hard to tell, but it's actually just a black dress that's really, really stretched out
Something like that, perhaps?

>Hmm, instead of the usual blood stuff, should a rumpire be able to drain body fat? Either in addition to the usual blood stuff, or as a replacement for it. That way they'd become like an "asset theft" type of mythical creature, and their most pleasurable prey might be busty ladies, lol.

####High School Rivalry 

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1703/99/1703997145895.png)

I like the idea of a girl with an amazing ass and mid boobs getting into a rivalry with a girl who's who's the opposite, and constantly proving her superiority over boob bitch.
Something like:

- Boob bitch is the popular girl of the school. She always dresses provocatively, is super proud of her tits and always likes to flaunt them and ridicule flatter girls.
- Ass girl enters the school as the new transfter student, and despite dressing relitively plainly, immediately starts stealing male attention with her hypnotozing rear.
- Boob bitch tries to get in her face and belittle her tits
- Ass girl responds that she'd rather actually have an ass than BB's sad excuse of a butt
- Despite being considerably shorter, AG easilly pushes the drama queen out of her way with a hip shove. The force is so great that BB stumbles into a locker
- She feels humiliation for the first time as a small audience laughs at her
- Boob Bitch tries to get back at her for the rest of the school year to similar results. All the while Ass Girl quickly gains friends and admirers to the point of becoming more popular.
- Ass girl also makes it a habit to point out how she constantly gets higher grades and does much better at all the physical sports and clubs. Most of BB's friends and simps have changed sides at this point, so AG argues that BB's a complete loser who isn't good at anything.
- Things finally come to a boil when BB catches her boyfriend eating AG out
- Boob Bitch gets her two remianing friends to help her jump ass girl, but AG's toned legs easilly beat them into submission. Ass Girl then sinks her nails into the cows tits and yanks/contorts them with such force that Boob Bitch begs for forgiveness.
- Forgiveness ends up meaning getting her face crushed under AG's superior rear

####Compression Clothes

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1704/47/1704472332899.jpg)

This raises something to think about:
Would compressing clothes exist in a world where ladies have gigantic butts and are expected to flaunt them around?
Would there be women who actually want to try and live in more confined spaces and thus would have to wear something like picrel (only for things to go awry)?

I'd imagine it would exsist for practical and work related situations, like high compression stockings and skirts for office jobs or management positions in other work environments. I say these in particular because I still imagine that personal value is determined by the size of one's ass so doing high risk, labor intensive, or menial jobs would be dedicated to men and assless women accordingly.
For even more drama of it, the clothes could be made of materials designed to stay under stress so they'd be more likely to break off of a woman without the sufficient ass to fill it out than one who does. Or other clothes designed to open and close for the sake of temporary stress relief during breaks and whatnot, as I'd imagine compression clothes wouldn't be especially comfortable over long shifts of sitting on condensed cushioning.

>In my mind, compression kind of defeats the point of a world where ass is supreme. Making your ass smaller would be unthinkable. The only kind of compression I can really think of is people wanting to hide their massive, useless tits to avoid drawing attention away from their asses.

>>Have you ever heard about "hiding your power level"?

####How to revive a Dying Game

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1704/63/1704634208852.jpg)

Consider the following:

- character/hero shooter designs getting stale
- every tank is a buff dude the size of a house or a robot
- desperately need attention again but changing the robot's nationality isn't enough
- the answer is obvious
- ass
- super-bottomheavy woman with an obscene amount of ass, upper body isn't nearly as bulky even with actual armor
- can't do a shield for the sixth time so instead, give her hip thrusts and flying peach abilities for both movement and offense, and a sledgehammer to complete the melee theme
- less health but high damage resist as attacks literally bounce off of her gigantic ass, makes up for lack of a shield with her wide hitbox being one
- on top of the hilariously massive knockback and stun all her attacks do, and being mostly invulnerable in 1v1s against half the cast, deals AoE damage any time she lands from significant height and possibly also gets a jump pad or something to further abuse that ability
- ultimate is either a brief mini-giantess mode, or an improved leap forward that does wide-ranging stun and can one-shot anyone directly impacted by her ass

might not be totally on-topic but game design is my passion or something

####Walking Advertisement

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1652/36/1652365613177.jpg)

Here's a silly idea:
With how huge asses could become, could some women just be actual walking billboards?
Like a chick gets sponsored by, idk, Burger King and wears some custom print panties or tights that's of a hamborger or something (with some gauche "now available for only [whatever price]" printed too).
It'd be a way to make some bucks, advertise borgers, and all she'd have to do is just go for a walk.

>That would be funny
>Especially if you imagine some grouchy old woman grumbling about how "back in the old days" businesses didn't need to use a woman's titantic tushy to get customers

>>I feel a job like that would replace things like sign spinning or other freelance advertising gigs

####CABoose

![Image description](https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/d/image/1651/66/1651662995031.jpg)

Let's don't be quick to judge, yeah? We're not even at the bump limit.
Anyway, check it! Imagine a girl getting a job ferrying people around on her butt! What Uber or Lyft parody name could work for this?

>Hind-Share (like ride share)
>The bigger ladies could even have one "passenger" on each cheek

>Caboose? Or CaBus, if the ass is big enough?

####The Police Force

What about the police force? How is that affected by the presence of the Casste System and all the women of resplendent rear proportions?

>The police force is mostly the same although maybe the police have a unit consisting entirely of women with large rears (and a ass themed pun acronym)

>With a big enough ass, you're basically above the law, probably because most of the top positions are also filled with fat-assed women. You might see beat cops who are men or even a flat-assed woman, but all the detectives, captains, etc are going to be women with preposterous posteriors. Who knows, maybe they prove useful in getting a confession or restraining criminals. At the very least, they have their own siren that sounds whenever they start to chase a perp.
