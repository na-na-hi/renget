#Potion Problems
Koyori set down a series of potions from her lab onto the table. The rest of HoloX looked on curiously.
"What do these potions do?" La+ asked, pointing at a series of suspicious looking flasks.
"These?" Koyori examined the ones she was poinging at. She laughed. "Oh, these affect your... gaseous emissions, if you catch my drift."
"Ehh? Gas??" Iroha said, looking slightly embarrassed.
"Yeah, this one on the left makes your gas odorless, but the sound is amplified." Koyori held up a faint greyish liquid. Then she put it down and picked up one that was an inky blac. "This one just suppresses your need for a few hours." She put that one down and picked up a red vial. "This one makes it smell rosy and pleasant, and... well, it also makes it have something of an aphrodisiac effect." She put it back and picked up the last one, which was a murky brown. "This last one's dangerous. It makes the emission much quieter, but depending on how much you take, makes it several degrees smellier than it already is, and makes the stench linger as if it was skunk spray."
"Ehhh? Why would you even make that one?" Lui asked, confounded.
"Why does any researcher research anything? Curiosity, of course!" Koyori said, proudly.
"So we all agree that Chloe should take the odorless one, right?" La+ said, matter-of-factly.
"Oh, of course." Iroha replied.
"I was about to say." Lui said, nodding along.
"EHH? You guys are just gonna decide something like that? How could you?" Chloe said, face burning red.
"I don't think I've ever met anyone with farts as smelly as yours!" La+ said, with a disgusted tone.
"And you have no tact as well. Proper manners are to find a place where nobody is if you have to do it." Iroha said.
"You really should do something about that diet of yours. I can't imagine those smells result from a healthy diet." Lui said.
"You... you... I am a woman too, you know!" Chloe walked over to the shelf and grabbed one of the flasks. "Fine, if you're so insistent!" Chloe downed the whole flask.
"Wait! Stop! is that the right...?" Lui started to say.
A dazzled expression overtook Chloe's face - though none of them saw it. She was still facing the shelf, all of her genmates were directly behind her. She felt a strange warmth in her lower belly, and cradled it. It felt so good somehow, like everything down there was lining up just right. Koyori, who had seen which bottle she grabbed properly, downed a Potion.
"Ohhhh I think I'm gonna..." Chloe said, trailing off. As advertised, it was completely silent, though they could all tell exactly what was happening. It looked almost like a wave, as a faint spray showered them all (except Koyori, who had backed away). The stench hit them like a truck, the smell of an entire septic tank dumped all over them, like being showered with rotten eggs and old cheese. Like having your nose be stuffed to the brim with used toilet paper - an odor far too strong to properly describe. Immediately Iroha grabbed her throat and tried to stop breathing it in. Lui covered her face and stumbled backwards. La+ fell to all fours and buried her face in the rug. She desperately started crawling towards the window. 
"Oh, that's not good." Koyori said, from a safe distance. "I can feel the warmth of that from over here. It must smell terrible. Even opening my mouth to talk makes me wanna gag."
Lui tried to get a few words out, but coughing was the only thing that came out.
"Oops. Teehee, I guess I grabbed the wrong one. Silly me." Chloe bonked herself on the head, but once she turned around, she realized just how bad it was. "Eep! Euchhhh."
Iroha was gagging, the smell was covering her entire body, and the surrounding room. "Gonna... die.... Smell... too... powerful..." Iroha retched. Her lunch was coming back up.
Chloe ran to her room. "Well, I think we all learned our lesson, so..." She ducked inside and quickly shut the door, hiding from the consequences of her actions.
La+ managed to get herself to an open window, as little good of good it did her, she managed to ask. "K-koyori... how long... does this last?"
"What the skunk effect? Oh, uh, I haven't actually found a good lower bound on it yet, and the last time I checked it was at least a month. Sorry about that, maybe I should have secured the bottle better."
Coughing, Lui summoned up the strength to speak. "K-koyori... how are you...?"
"Ah, I had a spare potion of anosmia on me. I can't smell anything right now. Doesn't affect my taste, but hey. Maybe I have a few more in the lab, want me to get some?"
Fervently, all the other girls nodded their heads.
"P-please-" Iroha got the word out before her stomach finally gave up its contents - she threw up all over herself and the floor.
"I-I'll do anything...!" La+ begged.
"Y-you should keep..." Lui coughed a few more times "You should keep a few of those around the house... just in case..."
"Haha, yeah. Good point." Koyori said, laughing. "Just so you know, the smell will still linger on you so you'll still smell like her rancid farts for quite some time."
"Shut up and get the potions!" La+ said, before retching and emptying the contents of her stomach out the window.
"Right, sorry. I'll be back in a hurry. See ya!" 
Koyori would hurry, but for the three suffering girls in the house, it felt like an eternity.
