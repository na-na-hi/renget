### Ever Lifting ♂
Ever Lifting, just as the day he was born. That is the name given to him by his parents. He was a gifted youth who spent much of his younger years studying under his mother and father to take thier place in the Clergy when they would become too old. Books, a cup of tea, paperwork for days. These are the things that surround Ever Lifting throughout his day. He busies himself with agreements and treaties that benefit the Clergy and its people.
Although, he does tend to disappear through long stretches of the day. Many wonder where he could be floating off to, what important matters could tear him away from business meetings and important work that lead him to performing paperwork late into the night...

Important Info | Description
---- | ----
Source of Wealth/Standing | Asset gathering. 
Family History | Ever Lifting has spent many years with his parents as they secured items of interest for the Ho'oha Clergy. He now uses the experience and the connections he made during his youth to make sure the land he calls home is not short of anything. And if a few items get lost, he knows how to cover the paper trail.
Place of Residence | Ever Lifting resides in a psychically floating tower that the rest of his lineage comes from. The tower was not built to raise them above their people, but to allow them to gaze upon their charges, and act in haste when things are awry. Although he doesn't spend as much time in it as most would think, given his disappearances.
