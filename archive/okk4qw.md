#####A man in Mareep's clothing.

*'Where am I?'*

The words echo in your head. The last thing you remember was staring into a barrel of some kind followed by a flash and then you were face up in a field. Judging by the blue sky and the sun overhead, you surmised that it was an hour or so past noon, there's just one problem: You can't move. Everything around you feels fuzzy, like a layer of bedding. Attempts to move your arms to the ground to push yourself up were met with pure air, like they were not able to go 'down'. Disoriented you attempted to 'roll' only to find the fuzzy layer to move with you. With the world now upright you realize one thing: You are no longer tall. The next thing you realize is you feel the ground through both your hands and feet. It felt 'right' but also wrong.

Memories of the past wrestle with your senses and you attempt to 'stand up' as it were only to lose your balance and tumble backwards. That soft fuzzy feeling pushes into your back and your body as you roll right back upon your 'feet'. Realization starts to dawn upon you as you pull up your left 'hand' and find it to be a blue limb with only two 'digits', manipulating them seems to be troublesome and frustrating, immediately missing having five fingers. You were no longer human.

You needed to find a reflective surface to confirm your situation. Surveying your surroundings, you find yourself in a grassy field with hills to your north and mountains to the south. Looking east and west you see mostly flat lands of grass save for the sight of what you believe is a lake to the west. *'Perfect, that will do.'* you think to yourself.  You have a suspicion as to what happened but you needed to be sure. Movement seemed to be fine, if something to get used to as you walked on four legs. The body seemed to know what it was doing which was a boon in itself.

Moments later you arrive at the lake, the flat surface is reflective enough with the sun overhead to see your face which confirmed what you had a hunch. "I'm a Pokemon. A Pokemon in the Pokemon world. Specifically, a Mareep." You say to no one in particular. Closing your eyes you focus on the events leading up to this moment.

You were at your station, looking at a display of the globe. Everything was flashing red. You had lost. Someone approaches from behind. You turn around to see the weapon with its blue-gray frame and barrel, green plasma dripping from the device, then...

You shake the memory from your mind. You have been given a second chance at life, who are you to complain? Being a Mareep explains the fuzzy layer, it was your sheep like fur. Everything save for the fact you got here makes sense. But, this is a world of legendary beings, bizarre monsters and above all else, Psychics. You've dealt with those before and the trick you used before will work the same here.

You just need to play card games in your head. Your best agent would be proud, at least, you hope he would be.

Off in the distance, you swear you saw buildings to the west, a town? Looks like a good place to start as any. Resources, food, a place to stay? If you are going to live in this world, better make the most of it. Maybe you can use your knowledge of the human globe to use here, do research, study patterns. Who knows, maybe you will find out why you are here.
