&emsp; &emsp;Slight squeeze of trigger. Loud explosion. Flash of light. Smell of gunpowder. Another demon spilling its guts out, choking on blood. The wrecked creature looked at the armoured figure in front of it, its eyes barely glowing while its screams turned into gurgling, lungs quickly filling with blood. The killer took out a smaller weapon and shot the defeated creature in the head, killing it instantly. The lifeless body spasmed a few times before the noise finally stopped and the dust has settled. “How many of them do I have to kill?” thought the nameless woman inside the suit while she reloaded her shotgun. This one didn’t fight with the typical rage of other demons – its movements were slow and its attacks were delayed, like it didn’t want to fight. “Aren’t those just mindless beasts?” flew through the mind of the only human in Hell as she cocked the shotgun before moving on, leaving the fresh corpse behind.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The fighter brought up a scorched piece of papyrus on which she over time scribbled a rough map of Hell based on inscriptions on various stones and tablets she found during her travels. She was on a cliff somewhere in what the runes referred to as the Lahkir Taiga. It didn’t look like a taiga at all, with coniferous trees being replaced by rough rock formations and floating stones emitting red lightning bolts of hellish energy. And it was cold, so damn cold, which contrasted with the clouds of yellowish air floating around. She was safe in her suit that provided many benefits, including internal body temperature regulation, keeping her warm even in case of exiting the armour, so the only way of knowing this place was freezing was because of a few curled up corpses of frozen demons lying around along with the Hell’s usual lava rivers and waterfalls turning into black obsidian. In some places lava would still be flowing before solidifying in air when falling down a cliff, turning into a constant stream of boulders.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;To the left were some mountains that looked less steep than the usual terrain of Hell, maybe there could be something worth checking out there. It wasn’t like she could do anything else; she was destined to stay here. Her suit kept her fed and energized, albeit only intravenously, but she got used to the hunger. The only thing she could do was to kill demons before they invade yet another dimension. Forever.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Several days later the soldier got to the base of those mountains and in the distance, she saw a building. It looked distinctively different from the background, yet was so similar in colour she didn’t even notice it from afar. It was made from stone and while the shape of it wasn’t too complex, it was much more polished than, well, anything around it. As she got closer, she noticed groups of demons coming out of the building. Time to kill. “Again…”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;A few dozen Imps, two Pinkies and a Hell Knight. The Doom Slayer shuddered – she hated Pinkies, they reminded her of bulls that she needed to attract with a red rug before jumping away. Except that she didn’t have a rug and this was a show for no spectators. They were her biggest problem now, too; Imps’ fireballs had a limited reach and the melee-oriented Knight couldn’t run as fast as the pink beasts. At least they weren’t particularly intelligent as they didn’t even try to hound her down from both sides; instead they just ran towards her in a straight line. The soldier waited for the monsters to get close enough before jumping away and blasting the closer one to her with her shotgun while it tried to stop when its target suddenly disappeared. The monster roared in pain, but it seemingly wasn’t really affected. It took several seconds for them to slow down enough to turn around – if they would manage to smash into the armoured woman, she’d probably fly away and break all the bones in her body. She had no intent on trying that out, so she prepared for the Pinkies to come at her again. This time, the unhurt beast was now in the back, so she couldn’t even finish the other one off. Meanwhile, the other demons arrived and the Slayer had to improvise her dance with the hellish animals, jumping and strafing to evade incoming fireballs from the Imps. But where was the Hell Knight? She didn’t have time to wonder about that as the Pinkies were running to her again, growling and spitting. The soldier blasted a few Imps around her before jumping from the beasts’ way and shooting them both. They were already severely weakened, bleeding profusely from their exposed parts on their backs and didn’t run as fast. A few scattered shots from the soldier’s trusty weapon knocked them down on the ground where they stayed, convulsing in shock from the fatal injuries. They weren’t getting up.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The Slayer shot several more Imps around her, switching to her rifle in the process when she ran out of shells. This wasn’t so bad, jumping and running around them would be a fun exercise if it wasn’t accompanied by the horrible bloodshed. And then, there was silence. The killer looked around, surrounded by dead bodies, the ground and her boots covered in warm blood. She counted eighteen small Imps and two Pinkies, where was that Hell Knight she saw earlier? They usually stormed the front lines of the Hell army, it wasn’t usual for them to stay back – Summoners did that, leading the battle from afar and calling in for reinforcements. She ejected the near-empty magazine and reloaded before cautiously going in to check out the building.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The structure looked larger from a distance but it might go deeper underground. It was made of stone blocks that were covered in runes. The whole building was shaped like square overlaid with a cross, looking a bit like a primitive cathedral, only much smaller and symmetrical in both axes. There was a stream of falling blood in each inward corner while the outward corners were adorned with gargoyles and stone tablets with more inscriptions. The Slayer doubted most of these monsters could even read, but there must have been some purpose to them. There was a large door portal and after checking the dark insides a little from the outside, the soldier carefully walked in. As she entered, she heard a shriek from an Imp and saw a light as it began charging its fireball. A few rounds from the rifle silenced it. She turned around just in time to see a big demon knock the weapon out of her arms. The gun flew out of her hands and fell down to the ground, sliding a few more centimetres. She was defenceless! She jumped back, expecting the monster to try and hit her but to her surprise it didn’t, instead it just stood there, unsure of what to do. It was the Hell Knight from before, unless there were two of them, but two Knights not killing other demons just to snatch an opportunity to fight? That was weird. No matter, she charged at the tall beast, tackling it to the ground. It barely tried to offer any resistance. She punched it in its eyeless head once, twice before it finally attacked. It just pushed her away, but it was strong enough for her to basically fly away and roll around a few times after hitting the hard floor. After she recollected herself, she looked up and saw the demon still on the ground, in the room’s corner, curled up.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;This was just too weird, so the Slayer stood up and waited for what the Knight was going to do. Its head was hidden in its giant hands; it looked… scared? It made a glance at the fighter before trying to retreat further against the solid wall. “What are you…” the soldier wanted to ask. She has never seen anything like this before. Was it a tactic to let her guard down? She walked towards her rifle that was just a few meters away and the demon didn’t do anything. She picked it up and aimed at it without any hesitation. It yelped, reached its arms in defence before curling up even more. She put the weapon down and started to slowly close down on the Hell Knight.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;With each step the yelps were getting more desperate. The demon looked the Slayer in the eyes a few times and she could notice its horrified expression. It was the only other expression other than burning rage she’s ever seen on one of those. It felt so surreal, having such a horrifying, giant, muscular creature be so scared of her when she wasn’t even pointing a gun at it. She got very near it – or him? There were no feminine traits on his body and given the possible… emotions that were distinguishing it from simple animals it perhaps wasn’t just a monster. She knelt down and looked at him. He didn’t seem injured, save for a few bruises and old cuts. She placed her gloved hand on his and looked where eyes would normally be. The quiet yelps stopped. “Why are you scared?”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;She didn’t know why she said that. It wasn’t like the demons could understand a human, right? “Do you want to hurt me?” she asked. The demon froze in place before slowly rocking his head slightly from side to side. “Are… Do you understand me?” The Slayer couldn’t believe what she saw but the monster’s reluctant nods confirmed it. The human asked more, “Why are the others trying to kill me? Why not you?” The demon curled up a bit again, but he stayed quiet. He pointed at the runes that were embossed on the inner walls of the building, too. The soldier stood up and looked at the stone panels. The suit somehow let her understand the text but she usually never read the tablets as they were just mindless drivel about spilling blood, not to mention she often had no time to do so when hordes of demons were trying to kill her. As she expected, it was more of the same: Strange connections on why the Hell Spawn need to conquer other dimensions and slaughter everything in its way. She looked back down on the Knight who didn’t even move and asked, “But that doesn’t explain why you are different.” The demon looked at her before trying to make some gestures with his hands, mixed with some growls. They were quiet and sounded somewhat melodic and more distinct than the usual screams she heard in battle. She couldn’t understand what he was saying but she picked up his general tone and with some difficulties very roughly grasped what he was trying to say with his hands. People? Shooting? Death? He pointed at her and stretched his arms before placing them on his chest, in a somewhat praying manner. Was the Doom Slayer a religious figure? She asked him that and he shook his head. He stretched his arm again, pointing at something in the distance before making the same praying gesture. “A… hero?” He nodded his head in agreement.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The fighter walked back towards him and sat down next to him. “You don’t have to be afraid of me. I don’t want to hurt you.” The demon was still breathing heavily but it slowed down and he managed to look at her for more than a few seconds. She placed her hand on his again. He didn’t look evil like the other demons.
&emsp; &emsp;“Do you have a name?” She didn’t know why she asked that; maybe because she was sitting next to someone (or something) that could think and feel but didn’t want to kill her; maybe because she could talk to someone, somewhat. The demon stared at the opposing wall, seemingly lost in thought before reluctantly producing a series of growls and clicks.
&emsp; &emsp;“Gh.. aranh…? I guess?” She had no idea how to pronounce those sounds nor how to distinguish them from the rest. He tried again, slower this time. It still wasn’t really understandable but she could hear the differences in vowels more clearly.
&emsp; &emsp;“Ghan… lakh? Ghanlakh?” It was the closest she managed to say and the demon nodded his head and made a quiet guttural sound. Was he laughing?
&emsp; &emsp;“Is it correct? Ghanlakh?” The Slayer asked, more confidently now. The Knight laughed again but nodded at her, confirming her tries. He pointed his other hand at her and looked at her with his head rolled to one side a bit.
&emsp; &emsp;“My name? You want to know my name?”
&emsp; &emsp;He nodded. The human opened her mouth to answer but no sound came out. What was she named? She blankly stared outside and tried to remember. How could she have forgotten her own name? She realised her past life was but a faint memory in the back of her mind. People she cared about, her home, there was nothing. Her heart beating more slowly and her mind clearer than usual, she tried to reminisce on anything from her history. The only thing she could remember were her past encounters with monsters, pain from her wounds and a clouded state of mind when she went berserk, fighting like an animal to survive, except she had a gun. Her hands started shaking. Was she like them, now? Was she just a beast, acting on instincts to survive? Was she even any better than the hordes of demons she fought against? With her only purpose being killing?
&emsp; &emsp;“I’m a murderer,” she muttered quietly. She tried to grab her head but her trembling hands only hit the visor of her helmet. She began feeling claustrophobic and tried to rip it off before realising she needed to unsafe it, first. When she finally undid the switches on the back of her neck, she threw the helmet on the ground. She didn’t even notice the cold, sulphurous air before she laid her head in her palms. Ghanlakh sat there, watching the scene, unsure of what to do next. He never saw a human before and even though he didn’t catch much of Doom Slayer’s visage before she hid her face he was still surprised at what he saw. The skin on her head was a single colour and it looked smooth, very smooth. The top of her head was covered in some kind of very long fur that ran down onto her shoulders and it looked fuzzy and soft unlike the cover of Barons' maldeformed legs.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;A single tear ran down the Slayer’s face before she collected herself. Still curled, she asked quietly, “Am I like them? Another nameless bloodthirsty maniac?” She looked at Ghanlakh who was staring at her. Even without eyes and lips his face was somehow quite expressive. He growled and shook his head before raising his hand, placing it on the woman’s shoulder. Now that she was looking directly at him, he could see her face and its details. She had eyes, but they weren’t glowing like those of a demon, they moved around and reflected light. They were colourful, symmetrical and sharp. Below them was a nose, the purpose of which was unknown to the Hell Knight who only had holes in his skull for breathing. And even lower was her mouth that wasn’t a giant toothy maw like his but rather two smooth, dark red lines. She looked so strange. Unusual strength radiated from her, even though her features were too smooth and innocent for a brutish fighter. Ghanlakh grunted and looked away. He got startled when he felt a mild pressure on his elbow but when he looked down, he saw the human leaned against him, followed by her wrapping her arms around his. What in the name of all unholy deities was happening?
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The Slayer didn’t notice how muscular the Hell Knight was before. She couldn’t remember when the last time was when anything that moved didn’t try to kill her and it felt like eternity since she touched another being without the intent of breaking its neck. She rested her head against his arm. She wanted to feel safe and cared for. She looked up and his face looked different. It wasn’t wrinkled as much as before and it carried a strange expression.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly, while still holding Ghanlakh’s arm, the armoured fighter rose up and grabbed his other shoulder with her free hand before hugging him, her head resting in the ridge above his chest plates. His body was hard, with parts of it covered in chitinous plates, but it was warm and she could feel his breaths and heartbeat, even through her armour. He placed his giant hands on her back and tried to pet her. His motions were jerky but they felt so… careful and gentle. She felt weird, lying in the demon’s embrace. Slowly, Ghanlakh suddenly lifted his arm and placed his rough hand on the Slayer’s face. She trembled a little and let the demon feel her smooth face with his bumpy fingers before grabbing his arm and directing it, moving it across her nose and lips. She wanted to feel him, too. She took off her gloves and dropped them on the ground before touching his scarred face. She moved her fingertips across the rough skin covered with creases, feeling his nose cavities and lipless mouth. And then, she stood up, moving her head closer while he lowered his. And before she knew it, her lips were touching his toothy mouth.
&emsp; &emsp;“What the hell am I doing?” flew through her head as she licked the demon’s teeth and moved on to his jaws that were almost scraping her tongue. It tasted salty but not entirely unpleasant. She grabbed his head from behind and after a while he understood what she wanted to do. He gently did the same and stuck out his tongue, connecting it with hers. It was much wider than hers but shorter and she managed to wrap her tongue around his, tasting both it and his saliva that was very runny, dripping out and on the cold, stone floor. It didn’t really taste of anything but it lowered the friction on his rough parts. She sighed as she tasted more of his skin and skull, licking and feeling the creases on his chin before moving lower to his chest while her hands moved to the sides, rubbing the spotted leathery skin on his shoulders. It was saltier than before and she could smell an alien musk that made her want to continue with a strange, before unseen ferociousness. She began rubbing her green metal armour against his brown and chitinous chest plates, keeping eye contact (at least with the area where his eyes should be) with the demon. Every once in a while a thought crossed her mind, “What the fuck am I doing?” but she always dismissed it, more decidedly each time, followed by even more passionate kisses on Ghanlakh’s body.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly, she felt a slight bump on her thigh. She looked down and saw something horrible, yet exciting at the same time. Looks like the demons got some human biology, after all. From something that looked like a slit in the Knight’s crotch was sticking out an exposed appendage, undoubtedly resembling a penis. She took it too far and she realised what she’s been doing this whole time. She was making out with a demon from Hell, without full armour, unprotected and foolish. It didn’t hit her that she was acting crazy – not before she managed to arouse him enough for… that thing to come out.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;But, at the same time, she felt a strange tingling in her own privates. It’s been so long since she had an intimate relationship with someone, if ever. She couldn’t remember. And love can be found in the most unexpected of places, right? Still, she couldn’t fathom being even remotely aroused by an ugly demon. A big, bulky, muscular, yet caring demon. Oh, god, it was true. Her hands got shaky again and her face turned red. The tingling down below was getting stronger and while her brain was trying to stop her, she couldn’t help herself but to look down again. Ghanlakh froze in place as the human in front of him knelt down again to inspect the result of his unexpected arousal. 
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The Slayer looked at the giant cock in front of her. It must have been at least thirty centimetres long and it was really thick. It somewhat resembled a human penis, with a shaft and a head, but with the corrupted devilish twist to it. The base was dark and spotty, similar to the Knight’s shoulders while the head was brighter, almost yellow, and visibly smoother. She noticed small bumps along the borders of the head. She uncertainly reached her arm and grasped the member in her hand. She couldn’t even put her palm around the whole thing, the girth was that big. The whole thing was covered in shimmering ooze, compensating for the lack of foreskin. The shaft didn’t feel as rough as it looked but it definitely wasn’t smooth, just enough not to scrape her. It was warm and pulsating, like the rest of the being’s body. She slowly shifted her hand to the tip. It was hot and smooth and as she touched it, she heard a low guttural growl from the hellion in front of her. He seemed to like it.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;She began jerking it a little, making a quiet wet click and getting more grunts from the demon each time she reached the tip. She used her other hand, as well, and picked up the speed turning the Hell Knight’s periodical growls into a deep unending howling. She loved that sound and she felt getting more and more aroused from it. She didn’t want to just use her hands and against what her brain was telling her, she leaned in closer, opened her mouth and welcomed the massive cock in her mouth. She started licking it and sucking on it while keeping her hands only on his shaft. His howling increased in volume when suddenly she felt pressure on the back of her head forcing her to go forwards as he grabbed her with his massive hands. She tried to resist but he was unrelenting. Even though she didn’t know if she could handle something this big, she did want to at least try it. She stopped resisting and she by herself began impaling her mouth on the big salty treat, rubbing it with her tongue. She wasn’t even halfway through when it hit the back of her throat. She endured the need to gag and slowly moved back. The Knight groaned and she could feel the vibrations through her mouth, radiating to her whole body like an earthquake. She moved in again, slowly taking it up before stopping again on the back of her throat. This time she didn’t feel an urge to choke and decided to embrace his whole length. She carefully positioned herself to reduce any bumpiness and moved forwards again. The demon cock moved and bent along the Slayer’s pharynx, tightly gripped along its full length by the surface of her throat and gradually, the soldier’s lips reached the Knight’s crotch. She gave him a small kiss around the base before moving away. The dick prevented the human from breathing in when it was very deep, but being choked from the inside made it unexpectedly even more thrilling.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;As she moved back, she spat out the throbbing cock, leaving a thick trail of saliva between it and her mouth. She suddenly felt so empty and before the beast in front of her could release an annoyed growl, she was sucking on it again with almost a hateful passion, first just the tip before deepthroating him again, much faster now. He grabbed her head again, much more tightly and began moving her head back and forth, forcing his giant rod into her neck, nudging and stabbing her in the tissue painfully. She couldn’t help but gag but she loved it. She, the badass demon killer who walked on dead bodies of thousands of soldiers from Hell, was now being dominated and facefucked by a single demon spawn who couldn’t even force himself to try to hurt her before. She felt like such a slut but her only response was a satisfied gurgle as she pressed the insides of her mouth on the cock, applying pressure on it from all sides, making her demon lover even wilder.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;But now, she felt a change. First, he gripped her head in his hands more tightly, scratching her scalp with his claws down to flesh and began pumping her head like a big toy without any wariness for her safety. She began feeling dizzy and lightheaded, but even in her weakened state she could feel the muscles in Ghanlakh’s cock suddenly tense up as his growls got louder and louder before finally he slammed her head deep to his crotch and produced an ear-shattering roar before releasing a giant wave of thick cum, flooding her throat, stomach and mouth before overflowing, spurting out of her mouth, flowing down her face and on her armour and floor. He used her head again and again, each time releasing another wave of his seed inside the human before slowing down, his climax complete. It was bitter but smooth and creamy; it tasted foul yet delicious and she couldn’t get enough of it. She had to swallow several times to clear her mouth but even then there was a small pool forming around her boots. The Slayer moved her head and released the now flaccid dick that was still leaking small amounts of semen. She put the head in her mouth again to get the last bits out.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The demon was panting heavily, blowing hot breath on the Slayer’s head, looking at the woman he was deathly scared of just a while ago, who was now on her knees, worshipping him and his organ of lust. Suddenly she stood up and looked at him, lips still covered in warm seed.
&emsp; &emsp;“You know, do you think you can go away with this?” she said in a dark voice before chuckling. She grabbed her armour by the chest plates and slowly took it off over her head before throwing it on the ground. When she looked up again, she was showing the brute in front of her a pair of smooth, perky, curvy human breasts, contrasting to her worked out figure – her abs and biceps were quite well hidden when inside the suit but now that they were out, they looked almost unreal. He reached out with his hand, trying to gently grab the tits but an arm stopped him. “Nuh-uh, not yet.”
&emsp; &emsp;He growled a bit and tried to brush her off. One moment he was standing on the ground, the other he was flying through the air before hitting the ground. She was insanely strong, especially for a being that small compared to him. When he looked up, the Doom Slayer was taking off her leg armour and boots, revealing her wide, muscular thighs. She sensually walked over to the downed demon, putting her foot on his flaccid member.
&emsp; &emsp;“I thought you were nice. Guess my body does things to you, eh?” the human spat out the words with a luscious grin while squeezing her breasts. Ghanlakh could only nod his head. The Slayer rocked her foot on the shaft of the demon’s dick, making him groan in pleasure.
&emsp; &emsp;“Well, don’t do anything stupid, boy,” she whispered and leaned forwards with her body almost level with his and her breasts hanging from her chest. She gripped the growing cock with her hand and continued, “This thing is mine, now.”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;She jerked it a bit, letting it expand to its full size. When it grew big enough, she let go of it and stepped forward, exposing her wet pussy before slowly lowering herself onto the gigantic pole, fingering her clit with one hand and spreading her lips with the other. She knew what Ghanlakh was capable of and she wanted to feel his full power. Finally, she reached the oozing demon cock and continued moving down. Damn, that thing was big. She just hoped it wasn’t too big. It was spreading her pussy so much it hurt a little. She moaned from the mix of pleasure and pain while the demon grunted in approval. She didn’t know when it was the last time she did something like this or if trying to ride a gigantic monster’s dick was the best way to have sex after a time as long as this, but she didn’t care at this point. Jesus, that thing was huge; could it even fit without splitting her apart?
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Apparently, yes, as the Slayer slowly slid down until she was squatting on the floor, her guts completely stretched and filled, even creating a slight bulge on her stomach. She began massaging it, giving the demon more pleasure while she slowly and carefully stood up again. She did this a few times, with her pussy spreading more and more to accommodate the demon’s colossal member each time. Good thing the Knight’s penis was continuously producing that slick goo as her own natural lube couldn’t keep up. He, on the other hand, was producing so much of it that it was dripping down, covering her inner thighs in it and forming a small, glistening pool on the ground. Gradually, the Slayer could move up and down more easily and smoothly and soon she was making quick squats, bringing immense pleasure to both her and her demon lover, who didn’t want to just lie on the floor and let the human do its job.
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly, two big hands grabbed the Slayer’s muscular sides before violently raising her up and moving her down, much faster and deeper than she could before. She was completely impaled and at the mercy of the furious demon. Her hair got messed up and was now freely flying in the air while her boobs bounced up and down. It hurt again, but differently – even more enjoyably. She began moaning again with her tongue out, her face twisted in pleasure she hasn’t felt in ages while Ghanlakh continued his angry, lustful growls, spit flying from both participants’ mouths while the lube was shooting in all directions each time the human’s and demon’s crotches made contact, followed by a quiet thud.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The Doom Slayer turned from a cold, dominating killer to a submissive bitch again, who wished nothing else but to be used by a huge monster and to receive more of the unholy goodness that sent waves of sweet pleasure to her body with an insane frequency as the Knight was smashing the human’s body against his. Any normal mortal would have their bones crushed and muscles torn apart but not her.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;An intense feeling started creeping up on the naked Slayer. She tried to contain it but it didn’t last long before she realised what it really was. All the muscles in her body began tensing and relaxing again in preparation for the incoming climax as her moans were getting louder and higher pitched. And then, it happened. She couldn’t help herself but scream in pleasure as she reached orgasm, immense waves of pleasure causing her whole body to tremble and spasm uncontrollably, not feeling anything else. Her demon didn’t slow down one bit, though, continuing to pump into her over-sensitive pussy, prolonging her crazed bliss even more, but before it was over, she could hear the Knight growl gradually more loudly and angrily before painfully squeezing her body in his hands and loudly smashing it against the very base of his manhood, followed by an even louder than before roar that echoed through the room while insane amounts of cum filled her womb. Almost immediately she was completely full and thick globs of white gel were shooting out of her pussy, on her body, his body and the floor. It seemed to have no end and she felt so beautifully full; she didn’t know something like this was possible. Ghanlakh slowly halted to a stop with his softening cock still inside. The Slayer slid down and laid on top of the demon’s hard chest, hugging it tightly before he did the same, embracing her with his clawed hands.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;They were in an unending bliss, two worst enemies, now in a hot, sticky embrace, both covered in sweat and other juices. His rough body felt so nice to hold on to and rest on while he was petting her head and playing with her hair, admiring its smoothness, blowing hot, humid breath at her while his massive chest moved up and down. She crawled towards his face and passionately kissed him before standing up. Ghanlakh slowly collected himself and did the same. Now he was looking down at her, his entire muscular, gargantuan figure standing in front of the Doom Slayer in all his unholy glory.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Watching the Hell Knight’s bulky carapace and the thick hanging meat between his legs, the Slayer realised she was being overrun by lust again. She began touching herself, while still looking at the demon in front of her whose bone was slowly rising. She wanted to try something else and instead of taking action, she stood in place with a luscious look.
&emsp; &emsp;“Come on, fuck me!” She yelled at Ghanlakh who started growling and snarling, his giant cock now fully erect, dripping with lube. She wanted him to tackle her and fuck her brains out and she didn’t care if she would get hurt.
&emsp; &emsp;“You know you want this, so just come at me and fu—“ she began shouting again but before she could finish, the hulking, enraged beast jumped at her and threw her on the ground. Her head was spinning but before she could do anything, she felt the familiar pressure in her groins before she was penetrated again. There was no slow warm-up this time; Ghanlakh fucked her without mercy, repeatedly impaling her on himself. The Slayer couldn’t concentrate on anything but pure pleasure mixed with pain. Soon after, she came, curling up like a dying spider as the waves of pleasure from her orgasm made her spasm while her womb was being filled again by her brutish demon lover before being dropped on the cold floor in a pool of mixed bodily fluids.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;When she collected herself, Ghanlakh was ready again and so was she. Now it was her who wanted to be the dominant one, forcing her mate on the ground and riding his cock that she craved so much for. Possessed by seemingly unending lust, the couple pleasured each other incessantly while night fell on the planes of Hell outside. Each thrust felt like the last one, each orgasm felt like the first and the frenzied human and hellion spent hours in the dark room in never-ending sinful bliss. 
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;But everything had to come to an end as not even the Doom Slayer could withstand the continuous physical strain without becoming exhausted. Losing count of how many times she was jolted with the powerful euphoria and how many times her womb was flooded by the seed of her one and only demon, the Slayer collapsed on her lover’s chest, tired, drained and used. She wanted more of him, the only spawn of Satan that would be there with her, but she was completely and utterly finished and depleted. Weakly holding on to Ghanlakh’s body, she felt slowly losing consciousness, but she didn’t mind. Her demon wouldn’t hurt her. And even if he did, what else was there in this cruel world? Only more suffering. She didn't care about fighting or other demons, she found a new goal in her brutal life; love.
&emsp; &emsp;“Ghanlakh...” 
&emsp; &emsp;

&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Her sleep was interrupted by strange synthetic blaring. She opened her eyes and found herself naked on a stone altar, with her arms chained to both sides. What the hell happened? Where was she? Who did this? She didn’t even know who she was but before she could think about that, a horrible wheezing noise turned her attention to her right side. What the fuck was that thing? Some horrible human-like thing slowly walked towards her, drooling blood and spit from its mouth. It had almost no facial features; instead there was a big spherical hole in its face above its lipless maw. It reached its arms and opened its mouth further, exposing the nasty rotten teeth. She panicked, trying to free herself from her bonds. They were made of metal but it was very rusty. She pulled as much as she could before hearing a loud clank as her left arm broke off the corroded steel. The zombie was already next to her, grappling her other arm, preparing to feast on fresh dinner but she instinctively grabbed the monster by the side of the hole in its face, stopping it from biting her. It tried to munch the constricting hand, gnawing at it and stretching its jaw, but the abomination was doomed. With an enormous strength the prisoner smashed the monster’s head against the solid stone altar. It exploded into gory chunks and blood.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Quickly, the now awakened woman freed herself from the other shackle and jumped down on the floor. By an insane luck some kind of a weapon was just lying there. She grabbed it and inspected it before noticing a few more of those zombies in the room. She aimed and pulled the trigger, and again, and again, and again. Shooting with this thing felt natural, was it really that easy or could she just aim well?
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;When the danger was eliminated, she looked around the room. She didn’t recognize anything here, yet it seemed so familiar, but not quite. There wasn’t much in the room besides the altar and a few computer screens. Computers? She remembered some things, now. Not anything about her past rang a bell but at least she knew she wasn’t completely brain-dead. There was only one door leading out of the room and staying here would make no sense. She reloaded her pistol and left.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The glass door shut behind her and in front of her was something that looked like another altar, but it was standing upright and there were pits in it, storing a suit of green armour. It looked strange and out of place, yet it was very fitting to her surroundings. She saw it somewhere, already, but where? Then she noticed a red mark painted on the suit’s helmet.
&emsp; &emsp;

&emsp; &emsp;*She wasn’t in the lab anymore. Desolate terrain. Yellow air. Stench of sulphur and rotting bodies. Monsters. Wanting to kill her. She shot them. No remorse. Endless fight.*

&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;She snapped back after collapsing on the ground, the impact waking her up. She got up again and tried to remember more. She knew she saw those places and those creatures. What else was there? She grabbed a railing to hold herself onto before her mind drifted away again.
&emsp; &emsp;

&emsp; &emsp;*More monsters. She was in Hell. She was killing demons. They never stopped. She didn’t, either. Mountains. Another fight. They were scared of her but she killed them anyway. She had to. Except one. He didn’t fight. He didn’t want to hurt her. She stayed there with him. She did things to him and he did things to her. Pleasant things.*

&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The memories ended and she was standing in the metallic room again. She felt weak to her knees and a strange, insatiable lust. She looked at the armour again and two names came to her mind. She was the murderer of demons. She was the Doom Slayer. And the other name… she realised it was the cause of her sudden desire.
&emsp; &emsp;“Ghanlakh…”
&emsp; &emsp;She didn’t need to know more. She grabbed the individual pieces of the armour and put them on. It fit her perfectly. Why wouldn’t it, it was her suit.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Days later, the Doom Slayer was slaughtering hordes of demons in her full glory, again. The robotic leader of the facility she woke up in thought she was fighting to save humanity after he fucked up. That was only partially true. She kept grinding through waves of mindless enemies, searching for her one and only demon. Every time she saw a silhouette of a Hell Knight, she got her hopes up, followed by her having to slay yet another mindless hellion. But she kept hoping, returning to her lustful memories in-between fights. She would meet Ghanlakh again, she knew it.
