# /VP/ PLAYS THREAD ARCHIVE
**Table of Contents**
[TOC2]
##Foreword
I've decided that the previous thread archive was messy and kind of a pain to scroll through, even with thread numbers, so I've decided to make something a bit more organized. I've decided to move this to rentry.org for several reasons;
1: no filter means I don't have to fugging bypass it whenever I want to make a vulgar subtitle (and so I can tell Nigger to go fuck himself for being a gay fucking leaf)
2: fancy formatting
3: I'll be able to provide links to skip to a certain LP instead of having to scroll through older stuff
goals for this were:
>add table of contents to allow quick access to recent content
>give each LP a proper summary, including the following: game name, status, description, and notable events
>revise thread subtitles because some are less funny than others
I think I've accomplished all 3 of those goals with this complete redoing. 28k characters and I'm pretty sure half are subtitles/LP summaries/whatever

If anything seems out of order, then sorry about that, it's just that sometimes I go back to a game in the middle of a LP for some reason or another, or I put a run on hiatus to do something else. If you come across a link to a thread that isn't in the archive, then there's a few possible explanations for that:
1: The thread in question got raided by underageb&s, schizos, something I'm not mentioning as to not tempt fate, or any combination of those.
2: The link was to a thread for a LP that was dropped quickly due to the game being bland and not interesting enough or it was unplayably broken
3: The link was to a LP that got purged from the pastebin (but not arch.b4k.co) during that DELETE FUCKING EVERYTHING spree after the desolation shitfest. Might overlap with threads removed due to reason 2, if it's not detergent/desolation.
4: The thread didn't really have any notable content in it. Usually threads that were mostly stalling for writefag, or threads that didn't get bumped for long enough for me to continue. cough trailer season cough
Likewise, if a thread doesn't have a "new thread" link at the bottom, then it likely died because it wasn't bumped in time for me to make a new thread.

LP summaries are color coded - green for completed, blue for ongoing, yellow for on hiatus, and red for softlocked/dropped.

##Rejuvenation V13
!!! note Status: Completed
    The LP that started it all. Probably the definition of Early Installment Weirdness - I feel like this had a bit too many forced memes, inconsistencies, disregarded GETs, tripfag drama, questionable decisions, cheese, ragequits, etc. for my liking, but maybe it's just because I was a still-underage shitposter who could still lurk just a bit more. Mostly sparked by discussions in the Reborn threads in late april 2022 about its spiritual successor, and then people making OC involving the game sparked my interest in playing the game for /vp/.
	
	In hindsight, I do find it kinda funny how these threads have somewhat mirrored Rejuvenation's development - starting as a shitty knockoff of Reborn, with a bunch of things that seemed like good ideas at the time but later became cringeworthy in hindsight, with the threads gradually becoming their own thing after enough time. Or if you're more cynical, it could be that these threads were always shit and that the new ones are just a bit less shitty in comparison. Realistically, I'm probably going to start from scratch when v13.5 comes out and start a new save, giving newbros an opportunity to catch up.
	
	Also probably the longest LP I've done, at 63+ threads. Some notable moments include:
	>The trips GET involving injecting any uber (I chose rayquaza) which ended up as mostly flamebait when it wasn't jobbing, likely being the reason I didn't use it much (hey, at least it got a cameo in Exile parts 22 and 34)
	>Accidental tripcode reveal (which is why the first few threads have a different tripcode)
	>Chuckshrew and its track record of ignoring GETs out of some combination of favoritism and deliberately pissing off that fucking leaf
	>That one time I had the wrong tab open and accidentally posted in a /vm/ roblox thread
	>Jihadbirds
	>That ragequit during chapter 11's fixed team mirror match, which caused me to take a break by realizing that randomized encounters are not good for LP formats
	
	oh and uh, cringe warning.

##Pokemon Wack
!!! danger Status: Softlocked (tripped anticheat)
    The second fangame played in my history of /vp/ lets plays, and also the one with the most content.
	Or at least, content I'd get to experience if it wasn't for several factors, one of them being that this first playthrough was a blind one (excluding the wiki's pokedex), leading me to miss a bunch of things. Another problem lied from the format I was doing with viewer participation - with such a huge fakemon dex, listing every one every time I wanted to make a new team made asking for a new party a chore, on top of it taking an annoyingly long time because lurkers can't make up their mind. 
    As it turns out, maybe having a ridiculous amount of new pokemon being accessible each progression milestone is probably not the greatest thing for an imageboard LP - a problem that would kill the second Wack LP.
   
    I also softlocked myself sometime after the fourth gym, by injecting master balls to re-catch legendaries after I fucked up by forgetting to save, since the previous game, Rejuvenation, got me way too used to just being able to press a hotkey and save after doing basically anything. A lack of quicksave ended up killing a few LPs before they started.
    I wouldn't notice that I was softlocked until the eighth gym, where several trainers straight up didn't have teams and forced me to add them via debug mode, but because Wack's internal pokemon list is fucked six ways to sunday, doing so would crash the game. While I could just debug my way past those trainers, I got hard locked at Victory Road, where I had to go through mandatory plot-important battles to get past, which didn't have teams because I tripped the anticheat, which I didn't know about until I asked a friend notable in the Wack community about the problem.
    Whoops.
   
    The Wack playthrough started during the later parts of Rejuvenation, where I needed something to play as filler while waiting for people with lower standards than me to do the bullshit puzzles/fights on my behalf. After the first rejuvenation discussion thread, the playthrough started getting its own full threads. I'll note the partial Wack threads with brackets - the first two will have some overlap with the Rejuvenation V13 LP, and the last bracketed thread will have overlap with the Opal LP. I've also skipped the threads that only have a dozen or so Wack screenshots as they're generally not important enough to list here

##Pokemon Empire
!!! note Status: Completed
    The third major LP done in 2022, and the first one to star a second tripfag, after the tauros incident. I'll save some time and just let the game's developers describe it themselves.
    ![still shorter than some cutscenes](https://arch-img.b4k.co/vp/1661962005672.png)
    It's basically a reborn clone, but with some of the edge being replaced with pretentiousness, and a lot of it, even at the expense of gameplay.
    >we're neither woke nor do we bow to the mob
    and yet we're still not allowed to have onscreen handholding with the player character's childhood friend. literally 1984
    Also includes the cutscene that combined the writer's barely disguised fetish, extreme cutscene stupidity, and shitty rewards for completing a terribly executed slog - the three things I hate the most in fangames - to cause me to ragequit, which caused an incident that lead to an anon taking up a tripcode and continuing after I burned out. It's technically a dragon monotype if you include pangolins, kaijus, and assorted reptiles as "dragons".
   
    Like the Wack threads, this playthrough also had some overlap with other LPs; in this case, the latter 2 threads overlapped with Pokemon Opal, albiet the short scrapped playthrough I did before I burnt out because the game didn't get good until like 12 hours in or whatever.
    If wagiedos doesn't return by the time I hear about the next Empire update I'll probably redo this playthrough and experience the clusterfuck myself.

##Pokemon Wack (doubles mode mono-steel)
!!! danger Status: shit doesn't work
    This was a thing that happened. After about 2 threads of fucking around with random games the thread sent me to see if they'd last more than 2 threads or if they'd just get thrown into the reject pile due to any combination of being really boring (solar light & lunar dark, infinity), being so broken it wouldn't launch twice (soulstones), or just being frustrating due to a lack of quicksave (infinity), I decided to go back to Pokemon Wack to try again in a new playthrough. There would be two gimmicks.
	>1. Doubles mode would be on, turning basically every non-wild encounter into a doubles battle
	>2. I'd restrict myself to only using steel type pokemon.
	This could have been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that Wack's doubles mode is extremely incomplete, and it's possible to softlock at the third gym just by walking past an invisible trainer without a team.
	This LP is mostly here just for completeness's sake, and maybe because it has the very, very beginning of the xenoverse playthrough, although it's nothing before the player is actually allowed to save
	
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/51548975/ 1 let's try this again
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/51577291/ 2 nevermind, softlocked.

##Pokemon Xenoverse
!!! danger Status: Softlocked due to being underleveled past a point of no return on a blind playthrough
    The fourth major LP, Xenoverse was a step away from the usual format. Instead of playing games infamous for shitty writing (rejuvenation/empire) or games known for adding a shit ton of content (wack), this game instead was pretty much an attempt to replicate the official games' formula in basically every meaningful way, except for a few minor details that ended up fucking over the playthrough, and my ability to enjoy the game. In chronological order, these were:
	>the lack of speedup, despite it being standard in literally every self respecting fangame
	>a non-toggleable EXP share, which would either lead to potentially trivializing all difficulty because of overleveling unless you regularly rotate your team, or being unable to switch in new team members without hours of grinding just so they can catch up
	>did I say grinding because not only is there no speedup, but there's also no repeatable trainers, and no meaningful way of getting exp from wild encounters without having to rely on the audino clone, because everything is at least 5 levels below the level you're supposed to be at, minimum. after the water gym, I'm pretty sure wild encounters were at least 10 levels behind the curve, which basically locked my team as shulong/sharpedo-x/that electric salmon fakemon/aggron/scovile/electric regional bird, the team an anon grinded to level 42 on right before the water gym to prevent 
	>Xenoverse pokemon (the game's main gimmick) generally had meh designs, and the only one I got to use before reaching the point of no catchup
	>also holy shit the dex was shit. most of the designs were underwhelming, and most official pokemon were only obtainable at least one badge after the fights you'd badly need them for. cough aron cough
	>the story wasn't worth going through bland gameplay for. plot TL;DR: you are the son of a guy researching some phenomenon called the xenoverse, a parallel diminension notable for being a shithole because that's where the main evil legendary resided after he was defeated by the main good legendary and the 3 starter pokemons' OP final forms. also your father is actually silver from JOHTOOOOOOO, and that he's the leader of the evil team (or maybe the second in command, no one gives a shit) and those cliche reveals basically killed my interest in continuing.
	>it probably says a lot about how bland the story is if writefag's first interest when making writefaggotry centered around this game is to completely make a new story from near-scratch (see: exile series)
	>also, there's a point of no return at the climax. if you didn't grind to have an entire party at level 60 or so just to be safe, and you don't frequently make backup saves, your save might be bricked.
	
	I *MIGHT* replay this but only if I'm bribed enough to do so. Considering becoming a wagie would be a more productive and entertaining use of my time than this shit, and assuming the game takes 60 hours to complete accounting for time spent uploading screenshots, that would be about $720 in bribes required, at $12 per hour.
	
	Not included in the archive is the thread immediately before when I'm playing random copied and pasted shit the lurkers sent me, and the thread after that which got raided by a schizo all because some retard mentioned that one of the characters looked like that schizo's waifu.

##Pokemon Opal
!!! note Status: Completed
    The fifth major LP, notable for bird spam instead of dragon spam. For the sake of completeness, the first few threads before I burnt out from boredom are included, but for all intents and purposes, this playthrough was done by Wagiedos after he finished empire chapter who the fuck knows who the fuck cares, who then disappeared after this LP.
also, looking through the archive, it seems like the lurkers and tripfags were considerably hornier than usual.

##Pokemon Violet
!!! warning Status: missing namefag
    Probably the first LP of a first party Pokemon game in recent memory, this was a short playthrough that ended about 3 threads in because the namefag running this playthrough disappeared after 3 threads.
	Because the official games are generally considered too easy, the namefag doing this playthrough set a few self imposed challenges, notably:
	>Only 1 move per pokemon at a time
	>Only 1 pokemon caught per badge/badge equivalent (gym badges, titans felled, or star bases cleared)
	>/vp/ gets to choose what pokemon he uses, which lead to the piarty being some combination of fletchinder, quaquaval, gogoat, ceruledge, dachsbun, wugtrio, drakloak, and maybe something else idk
	GETs were handled a bit differently in this playthrough, with dubs being the standard for choices, but it probably wouldn't matter much tbdesu

##Rejuvenation V13 (ground monotype)
!!! warning Status: on hiatus/abandoned
    it's basically just the rejuvenation playthrough, but with a restriction where I'm only allowed to use ground types (and then that kinda got thrown out the window with a natural shiny tangela), a new drawfag which actually has the courtesy to let me know if he's going to disappear for a while, and more screenshots from cutscenes.
	Currently on hiatus after I got bored during the very slow sixth chapter and decided to replay Wack, then when I returned so I could see if writefags would make anything for my birthday, I did a little bit before getting stuck, and by the time I finally realized that I should maybe check the island's oricorio meadow to continue progress, procrastination got in the way.
    
	probably not going to be continued unless I somehow need filler content while waiting for v13.5 to come out if the Crud playthrough somehow doesn't last long enough for Jan to finally get his act together and release v13.5

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52605557/ 6 and then the thread got raided by underageb&s and trannies
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52631120/ 7 the part where we forced keta to touch grass

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52789172/ 19 writefag returns and that's basically it

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52812179/ 21 a shiny and more walls of text
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52833856/ 22 IT'S ALL WALLS OF TEXT!
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52855421/ 23 the revolt begins
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52867133/ 24 no bumps?
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52880333/ 25 6 quads GETs, and it's still over
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52901747/ 26 only the chosen may survive
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52916965/ 27 no fugs ever given
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52934418/ 28 no such thing as overpreparation

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53431248/ 31.1 got lost, turned into a giant writefag summoning attempt

##Pokemon Wack (attempt3)
!!! warning Status: on hiatus (burnt out trying to obey rule 5)
    another wack playthrough, this time with far less debug mode shenanigans to try and not trip the softlocking anticheat
	on hold because I burnt myself out trying to catch fucking everything in a game with hundreds of available pokemon before each badge

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/52999426/ 1 wack harder
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53010615/ 2 the good battles
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53026243/ 3 birds are very important
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53034145/ 4 it's over, again.
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53065704/ 5 ez gym
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53085873/ 6 it's still over

##Pokemon Wack (dreepy solorun)
!!! danger Status: it's over (got stuck on rubber gym, burnt out, by the time I became stubborn enough to return to wack I realized the spreadsheet row used for fight level tracking was wiped)
    This is self explanatory, I just felt like doing a solorun with the mascot of the first Wack playthrough, Dragapult
	to a lesser extent, this is also for filling out someone's solorun info spreadsheet from the wackcord, which I am not linking because I don't think posting that invite on a shithole board like /vp/ would be a good idea
    also, due to a clerical mistake, the spreadsheet row I was using to keep track of levels fights were beaten at got wiped. oops.

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53347839/ 1 now it's time for the good battle
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53356135/ 2 dude, where's my writefag?
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53375847/ 3 got bored/filtered, it's over

##Pokemon Wack (woot solorun)
!!! warning Status: on hiatus (i should probably try to get a longer attention span)
    don't you love stubbornness
    this is another solorun of Pokemon Wack but with woot, but with at least 425% more legendaries murdered
	
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53705156/ 1 woot wednesday
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53737743/ 2 total legendary death
at this point it's basically just offscreen stuff at this point
currently stuck on jeeve stobs (6th gym) because of level cap & coverage shenanigans

##Pokemon Ocandia
!!! danger Status: Dropped (got bored and ran out of spite to bother continuing)
    Basically a hijacked shill thread for You Just Know: the fangame, that ended up becoming a proper LP, where I play a shitty shilled fangame to prove that it's nowhere near as good as the shill claims it is, so you guys don't have to.
    Not a LP of one of its sequels, "Pokemon Ocandia: Blood on the Ice", which is a very shittily made visual novel with about fuck-all to do with Pokemon.

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53769244/ 1 least obvious shilling attempt
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53781242/ 2 on 4chan, there's barely a line between trolling and retardation
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53791184/ 3 wow, it's fucking nothing

##Rejuvenation - Madame Moto mod
!!! info Status: Ongoing
    This was supposed to be a LP of Rejuvenation's first published version, but that didn't last long enough to get past the title screen because the game crashed on launch, with or without debug mode. Instead, someone posted a download link for what's basically a difficulty hack of Rejuvenation v13. I guess it'll keep us occupied long enough for writefag to return and for v13.5 to release.
    Oh, and the modder disabled tailwind (for the player only) which is LITERALLY 1984.
    

https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53913991/ 1 it's beginning again
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53921488/ 2 not filtered yet
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53929481/ 3 it's over
https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/53939424/ 4 procrastinating to summon another tripfag
