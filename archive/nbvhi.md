**ELIGIBLE HUSBANDS**
==High quality men worth pursuing and testing.  Ratings are only given here as they are priorities to find after a cure can be found for my people.
10=Most eligible
1=Least eligible==

>Billy Kido
Despite his unassuming looks, the radio and Kara talk about him as a deadly person, strong and capable with a sword from the old times that uses divine energy to slice things with heat and steel. Has the reputation of a death dealer, which means he bears great strength and is worth pursuing to sire children. I can teach him the proper skills to survive the trials if need be.
>Rating: 8/10

>Marcus Cassius Allen
Despite his lack of strength, his weapons are from the before times, from the hands that made the towers. Kara says he is quite the fighter, so he should be able to survive the trials. He can bring signals to dead devices, so he must have some holy connection to the towers.
>Rating: 7/10

>Magnus Wang
Strong, fast, and able to survive in the wastes on his own make him a very good candidate to father a dynasty of strong, skilled, and adaptable heirs. Comes from the frozen north, which Kara says are very inhospitable compared to the lush jungles which I had the pleasure to grow up in. This means he must be very strong to have thrived in such a space. If seen, attempt to test his stamina to make sure he can fulfill the basic needs of a husband.
>Rating: 9/10

>Quinn Chase, AKA 'The Boss'
A remnant of the old tower makers who is said to have great looks, stamina, strength, and speed. He is an ideal, a man of legend that I wish to see for myself and lightly test before I subject him to the trials of my people. If he is all Kara says he is, then he would make an excellent sire and father.
>Rating: 10/10

>Nikto
A man blessed by the towers with great power and skill, even if his strength and stamina weren't noted. Offers unique advantages to potential children, should his unique abilities be true and not some false gift from false towers. Foolish, according to Kara, which could be troubling for his chances of getting through the trials.
>Rating: 8/10

>Dr. Charles Crane
A man I hope to meet, as he is one of the three capable of saving my people from their dark fate. Has no noted physical traits but is skilled in medical arts which are foreign to my people. While he himself is not an amazing specimen, I want to spread his skills as far as I can to worthy heirs should other options fall through. Kara says he is smug, but I doubt he would say no to me if I asked him for his hand in marriage.
>Rating: 7/10

>Ultra Magnus 
Another extremely desirable man: strong, with stamina and faith to back that up. Kara says he is large, handsome, muscular, and slightly off in the head, but as long as he can think straight to complete the trials, I would be happy to join him in marriage and bring good heirs to my father.
>Rating: 10/10

>Nick
From what Kara says, an idiot who fights with only his fists, but to me, that sounds like a very courageous and forthright man who seeks to meet the challenges the towers test him with. While not ideal due to his alleged mental state, certainly a good option should more desirable men fall through the cracks or be taken by other women.
>Rating: 9/10

>Sir Philippe Dubois of New Orleans
A man with not only a title like myself but a reputation as a renowned slayer of mutants and horrors, like the Bretonnians in the old tomes! While I hear his armor does much work for him, armor made by the tower-makers must be a sign that he is blessed by them. I wish to try his stamina, should the opportunity arise. He would make an excellent mate.
>Rating: 8/10

**BACKUP HUSBANDS**
==The remaining men of note I have heard about. Not rated due to their nature as being secondary options should all the above men die or be taken.==

>Crew of the Argo
I hear it has some men on it, but they are likely weak from living in a metal boat all day. If fighting Razorheads has taught me anything, it's relying only on the miracles of the signals and towers often makes a person soft and weak. One must be tempered without the aid of the towers to be worthy of their blessing.

>Alexander S. Luther
Some kind of leader who leads without strength but through speech He seems very weak, reliant on others to hunt and gather for him while he simply gives orders. My father's father was like that; he was killed when he was subjected to the trials after he had grown too fat and smug on the throne to fight. Should he achieve power and my options dwindle, he is a possibility, not a preference.

>Mike the Driver
A man named after his miracle from the towers, thus one who bears the same crippling flaw as the Argo's crew. Possibly useful as transport across the desert when the time comes to cross to the "Big Dig" in search of medicine. Otherwise, he is another weak man graciously allowed to be a parasite to the tower's blessings.

>Ricky W. Booth
Owns and operates a flying machine freighting cargo. He is doubtlessly weaker than one who tempers themselves with journeys on foot, but makes the list for being a man who can presumably sire offspring and not being mutated.

>Aaron Cob, AKA The Ant King
Has the interesting blessing of controlling ants, using it to restore order to the land at large despite his meager physical traits. A person of interest but not prime material to choose as a mate for life. Certainly someone I wish to ask about the towers thought.

>Lance
While he does command a great deal of power within the signal's realms, I fear he is coddled by it. Only time will tell if he is more than a voice from the aether and can sweep me off my feet with his blessings. Regardless, the towers sent me a message to see him, and Kara speaks highly of him as well, so I see no reason to be rude given his gifts.

>David Wiles AKA Profit
A fast-talking, good-looking man with seemingly supernatural sense for danger. I know too little to know if this is simply a great degree of skill or a blessing from the towers that allows him this, but given his lack of strength and fitness, he is beaten by others with better traits to pass on.

>Dimir Leksirei
A man who made himself into a half-demon and offers the same to others: he abuses the gifts of the towers to make monsters. If I were lowered to having no other options, I would lay with him, but that is the only time I ever call a demon in human form my husband.

**COMPETITION(WOMEN)**
==Detailed below are strategies to chase other women of the wastes off of desirable men, for they surely want the best heirs for themselves as well.==

>Lin
A swordswoman from the mountains. Fast and deadly, but still susceptible to a well-laid ambush of explosives should she get in the way of a good marriage. I don't believe she is much of a threat, and possibly even an ally should I need more force in finding a cure for my tribe. I would rather not kill a potential ally if I can help it.

>Yuki Kikuchi
An expert on making people into half-demons and maintaining their parts, I fear her little due to her supposed lack of attention span and constant traveling. She is unlikely to find a good husband as a vagabond. Possibly useful for her specialized knowledge into half-demons, so do not sour relations with her should you need her.

>Maya Liang
A Demon with the mind of a human woman: dangerous, but likely unable to breed and likely (and hopefully) not searching for a mate. Demons are animated only by signals, with no soul to speak of, so I will need to be careful not to show weakness around her.

>Doctor Remelia Rochefort
A difficult case: She likely has suitors lined up because of her skills she can pass on to children. She is a threat, but she is one of the three that can heal my people of their plague. Angering her with threats would surely be a poor decision. Kara says she is easily angered as well, so I must act my most demure and royal around her.

>Sage
Some kind of experiment from demon-worshippers, and worse if the radio and Kara are to be believed, but she lives amongst the people of the settlements in peace. Able to create without birthing it, likely a gift from the towers she relies heavily on. I will attempt to be cordial with her, even if she has plenty of motivation to find a good man to give her good heirs.

>Lockley Aimes
Another user of flying machines. I know only what Kara says, and she believes her capable despite her lack of years. Her blessing from the maker seems wasted in my view, but I wish to follow father's example and have peace with other people, rather than war over petty trifles.

>Heli Matharom
According to Kara, a reliable warrior who leads a group of warriors like herself. Is protection is needed in our journey, hopefully the towers provide us with their presence. Given her skill and profession, she may need verbal dissuasion from seeking a high-quality mate that I have greater need for.

>Kara Ramirez
According to Kara, she says that she only likes being with other women. I have yet to grasp why, but she has been very nice to me, and I do not intend to throw that away, even over a husband, should she change her preference. It is my debt to help her and understand her, especially in my work with her however she chooses to let me repay my growing debt to her.

>Calliope
A dangerous and strong woman who also only seeks companionship with other women. It is a relief since the tales Kara tell make her seem as deadly as a rampaging mutant, with the mind of a songstress perfecting her craft. Be on guard in case she takes an interest in us.

>Queen Bee
Another storied woman who tests the stamina of all comers. Likely a dangerous challenger in courting that will hopefully not to commit to the high-quality men this land boasts. If we ever come into contact, I am doubtless she will see me as a threat as well.

**MUTANTS**
==Some may be reasoned with, but one must always remember that a mutant is an animal to be kept at a distance, even if it can walk and talk as a man.==

>Sasha the Snake
A large, strong, and deadly reptile woman: If spotted, flee. I have heard of her before listening to the blessing that is the radio, and even our best hunters took losses when attempting to hunt her. I would need a trap made of plastic explosive triggered right on top of her to make a dent, and possibly some assistance to land the killing shots. Best avoided if possible.

>Ramses
A mutant who sees himself as king of a new empire, wanting to put humans under his purple thumb. I am his natural enemy, his opposite, and I don't doubt the towers will call me someday to battle him in a war of wits. Not a stupid mutant by any means, but that just makes him extra dangerous given how scattered humans outside of Verzon are.

>The Nymphs
A hazard of the Jungle, a killer of fools and the gullible They are corrupted by false signals, and were they not dangerous and mobile, they would have already been hunted. Highly dangerous prey; avoid if possible unless you have a full hunting party prepared to blow their hideout and waterways to scrap and vapor, respectively.

>Samson
A winged monstrosity that defends the Nymphs, taken in by their charm and not yet eaten. More dangerous than his lovers by far, and capable of flight to boot. Many of our hunters have died in attempts to bring the monster down, so unless one is fully prepared with a hunting party with the best they can bring, seek cover and wait for him to leave.

>Karnak
A vile mutant which corrupts signals with his words and makes towers suffer his noise of mutant supremacy. My inevitable conflict with Ramses will likely include him as well.

>Hannah Ossus
She once wandered into our village and bested our warriors in a contest of strength; even father had to concede to her. She was placated instead of killed due to her immense strength, despite her clear mutations, which separated her from us. Not worth hunting down as prey, but a danger should she take heads and claim lives.

>Brunnea "Sunny" Brown
A mutant who works under Ramses, allegedly. One of his raiders who enforces the will of the mutant emperor, and one that with a proven streak of bodies and looted caravans according to the traders who come through my tribe. A worthy beast to kill given his connection with such mutants that sully the signals with their lies of supremacy.

>Tuma
I have only heard rumors over the radio of such a fishwoman, but if she can move with water, then she is a threat to all on it. Kara insists not all mutants are beasts, but it is a difficult notion to accept something so non-human as possessing our intelligence and wisdom. But Kara is wiser and older than I... perhaps she is worth listening to on this point.

>Dr. Acheron 
Another one of Ramses monsters, this time his demon-maker and fixer. In our conflict, he will meet either subjugation or death if I have my victory for man over beast. Kara's words do reach me, but with Ramses' messages, it is difficult to control my words and anger.

**DEMONS**
==Kara tells me I should call them Robots, but to my people being of steel and rubber are demons. They are not to be trusted, but are not as low as mutants are viewed. Excluded from Husband pools due to the lack of ability to give a child to a woman.==

>Hope
From what the radio and Kara say, my last hope should all other options in saving my tribe fail. While I dislike needing a demon for such a deed, we have been traded and been helped by demons in the past. She charges prices equal to one's own limbs, which will make her difficult to petition for a cure. However, I will likely have to try and bring all my royal charisma to bear for the occasion, tower's willing.

>Amu
A demon which flies a ship of metal in the sky, which often brings fear to the tribe. We have heard her over the signals, the towers warning us of her intentions and giving us knowledge over her we have transcribed. While she has never attacked us, I fear the day may come in this time of crisis.

>Phi
A collector of the old world trinkets, according to the radio. Dangerous if encountered, and we have something it wants. Thankfully, demons fear explosives like any being does, and I carry more than needed to send him to his false signals for good.

>Victor
A strange demon which offered to help us with a giant ant problem some time back. It roams with an honorable warrior's attitude but the shell and weaponry of a demon. A potential ally, should he still be the same demon that he was when he first visited the tribe.
