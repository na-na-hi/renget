3rd fes had ignited a fire within Myth. Being on that stage and moving the hearts of thousands of fans in the stadium and millions more across the world was a high unlike any other. The only thought that stuck with them well after the performance and into the night was *I want to do even better next time!*

With their ambitions aligned, Kiara had taken the initiative to rent out a small vacation home in the Austrian countryside to host a week long dance camp. Here they would hone their skills and take their performances to even greater heights. 

The basement had been refurbished into a dance studio and was quite modern despite the rest of the residence's rustic furnishings. It boasted a massive wall-spanning mirror on the north side, polished floorboards, a top of the line sound system, and a few benches towards the back when they needed to cool down. By most metrics it was a perfect place to practice, but trouble seemed to follow HoloMyth like a shadow and the air conditioner broke down during the first night. It was day seven now, and after housing five bodies going through dozens of hours of cardio, the room was a complete sweat box. One could smell their exertion from upstairs and the air was getting thicker by the hour.

Making matters worse, all members had agreed to wear their full debut outfits to make their practice sessions as authentic as possible. Such clothes, while visually appealing, were not designed with extended physical activity in mind and soon grew damp and heavy with untold layers of sweat and filth.

In Kiara's eyes, all this discomfort was just one more obstacle to overcome on the way to stardom and so she pushed on with her usual fiery passion. 

“One! Two! Three! Four! One! Two! Three! Four! Left foot out, hips to the side, and circle back in!” The music stopped and Kiara held the final pose for a bit longer. She could see and feel the crowd in her mind's eye, an ocean of orange lights shifting like galaxies across a dark stadium full of fans chanting her lyrics. She could have spent forever in that moment...until a 4'6" shark girl slammed into her from behind.

“Oof! Hey, watch it Fartson!” Gura pushed off Kiara's hips and lunged back into Ame.

Kiara sighed and turned around to see the two of them tangled in a mess of shirt-pulling and hair-grabbing . This marked the fourth time this morning their roughhousing had interrupted class.

“Girls, girls! Come on now, how many times do we have to go over this? This is our last day, do you really wanna spend it beating on each other?”

“She *started* it,” said Ame, while using one hand to keep Gura at arms length. “I got most of the moves down until she stepped on my shoes!”

“That's a buncha baloney, you were makin' faces at me the whole time! Ah, see, she's doing it right now!”

Kiara pinched the ridge of her nose and tried to massage away the incoming headache. The blame game didn't have much mystery to it these days since the instigator was always Gura. Whether it be butting heads with Ame, goofing off with Ina, or taking unproductively long breaks with Calli, Gura was always the one to make the first move. It was a cute, somewhat childish quirk of her personality and made for great content as a streamer, but was poisonous in the context of a focused dance practice.

“It doesn't matter, let's just get back to it, okay?” Kiara clapped her hands together and motioned for Gura to get into position. “We're almost at the chorus and then we can take a break.”

Gura grumbled something under her breath and flipped Ame the bird on the way back to her spot, to which the detective responded in kind.

Content with the temporary truce, Kiara pushed her bangs out of her eyes and planted her feet. “Okay, start the music! Three, two, one!”

* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *

“Circle back to the right and feet together! And pose!”

Panting and sore all over, Kiara reached the chorus and let her arms fall to her side. They'd been going for another 30 minutes and every member was feeling the burn to some extent.

“Yes! Good work girls, we really came together on that one!” The rest of Myth were all smiles, plainly satisfied that they kept up with their teacher's instructions. Even Ina, who previously displayed a startling lack of cardio had worked hard and shadowed Kiara's movements perfectly. They were ready to bring it in for a group hug when Kiara noticed a curiously empty spot to the right of Ame.

Kiara squinted her eyes. “...Gura? Hello? Did she get some water or something?”

Ame hitched her thumb and gestured toward the back of the room. “Nah, she's been chilling back there since the first verse. I thought she'd come back eventually but...yeah.”

“Since the *first verse?* Wh- Ah, never mind, I'll get her.” Kiara tried not to ball her hands into fists as she walked over to where Gura was lounging and playing on her phone, simmering emotions gaining more and more agency over her body. It was one thing to constantly disrupt class, but to skip out entirely? During the last day when team cohesion was the most critical? It was toeing a dangerous line between annoying and disrespectful.

Gura's phone screen dynamically adjusted its brightness as Kiara's shadow suddenly loomed overhead. She didn't even bother acknowledging her instructor's presence.

“Didn't feel like joining us, huh?” Kiara put her hands on her hips and lightly tapped the floorboards with her foot.  “Already got the dance down?”

“I got most of it, yeah.” Gura still hadn't taken out the earbuds and most of her attention was on the rhythm game playing out beneath her thumbs. “I'll figure the rest out tonight.”

“We need to do this together. How are you gonna know where to move on the big stage without any practice?”

“Geez, we still got a few days till the concert. Just walk me through it on Discord later.”

“I'm serious, get up. Now.” Kiara's glare grew darker as she pondered her next threat. “If you don't behave, I'll sit on you.”

Gura's fingers paused and she peered over her phone with excruciating smugness. “Oh nyo, is Kiwawa getting angry? Maybe you should worry more about your own performance. It's kinda sad seeing a “dance instructor” get winded after twenty minutes of exercise.”

A few seconds of near silence passed as Kiara processed her genmate's sass. This blue brat was really pushing her limits today. It was all in good fun among friends, but being exposed to this for a week straight would set anyone off.

Kiara took a deep breath and exhaled through her nose. Her mind was made up.

“Ah, you're right, Gura. My cardio is so shit and I can barely stand right now. I really should take a break...” She kicked off her shoes and stepped over the bench with a huff, Gura's stubborn little face now positioned directly below her enormous backside. It was a position most of KFP would kill to be in, flanked on both sides by Kiara's godlike thighs that ran up to meet at her deliciously meaty ass, toned with just the right amount of muscle and fat from her recent gym obsession. The whole package was wrapped tight in shiny black spats that looked a couple sizes too small and thin enough to hug every curve and crevice of her spankable cheeks and perfectly smooth pussy.

Though the heavenly eye candy belied a sinister reality, and Gura's nose wrinkled as an immense stench poured down from Kiara's crack and across her face. It was warm and uncomfortably humid, like stepping out into the hottest day of summer after a rainstorm. *Ugh...what the hell is that smell? Is this really Kiara?* The mental whiplash between Kiara's usual cleanliness and this vile odor stunned Gura into silence.

The punishment this phoenix was about to deal was much, *much* more cruel than she knew. In the hyper-focused pursuit of furthering her idol dream, Kiara had let many crucial routines fall to the wayside. Showering, doing laundry, watching her diet...these were all distractions and time sinks in the greater context of absolutely nailing the choreography. She was just going to sweat down to her socks in a few hours anyway, so why bother wiping off all the greasy, foul-smelling grime that was building up in her armpits and between her cheeks? 

The effects should have been deeply disturbing to someone who prided herself on well-kept femininity, but everyone else was in various states of disarray too so it felt like a natural product of working hard.

Besides, her spats did an excellent job of containing her ass funk. All her bodily refuse, from silent farts to copious amounts of sweat, were trapped tight against her skin beneath the slick fabric, so the only way anyone would know about the true extent of Kiara's loathsome hygiene would be if their face was pressed firmly and deeply into it.

“W-whoa, hang on!” Gura's adrenaline spiked as she realized how dire a position she was in. She started running through a list of apologies to weasel out of her comeuppance as Kiara's ass dropped lower and lower into her new seat, blotting out the overhead lights behind two dark, shiny moons. Gura managed to vocalize the first syllable of “Sorry!” before Kiara silenced her with a hefty mouthful of sticky musk-soaked spats and drove the back of Gura's skull into the cushion with a soft *whump*.

*“Hahh!”* Kiara sighed in satisfaction and leaned back in her seat, the bench slightly groaning beneath her weight. It was nice to cut the little brat off mid-sentence but even better to finally get off her feet. Hours of uninterrupted dancing left her body exhausted and in desperate need of a recharge. She reached down and massaged the tender muscles that lie beneath the supple fat of her thighs; they were tight as corded steel and barely responded when she flexed them. She briefly wondered how long it would be before she could physically stand up again.

She looked down over her shoulder, past the curves of her cheeks at the waterfall of blue-streaked white hair pouring from beneath her. “You're gonna be my throne for a bit, okay? When I get up we'll get back to it.” Kiara wiggled in place to get more comfortable (she was going to be here for a while after all) and felt the small protrusion of Gura's nose wedge nicely inside her sweaty ass crack.

Below, Gura's body was firing on full fight or flight mode. Her first instinct after shutting her eyes and mouth was to reach up and push the phoenix off her. Gura's palms slapped into the bottom of Kiara's thick thighs, her fingers slightly sinking into the doughy flesh on impact, and pushed as hard as they could. Kiara didn't move an inch. Gura was much too weak and might as well have tried to lift the building of its foundation. Her muscles reactivated, straining and pushing to the absolute limit and inadvertently huffing more of Kiara's musk into her lungs as her repeated attempts demanded more oxygen in her blood.

Nothing.

With no way out, Gura's arms collapsed and she was forced to confront her new reality as a chair. Kiara's phoenix lineage kept her body radiating heat like a furnace and sweat raced down her body in small branching streams. The spats slick material was *dripping* with a weeks worth of slimy perspiration and filth, and it smeared across Gura's pale skin every time Kiara adjusted herself. As the temperature rose, the intense swampy heat that coated her features grew thick like a layer of warm Vaseline, trickling down her upturned nose and filling the gaps of her shut lips as it teased its way further into her body. 

In this nightmarish pocket climate of humid musk, Gura's air supply rapidly fizzled out. She needed to breathe more than anything, but her mouth was entombed in sweaty phoenix ass and completely blocked from the outside world.

Fortunately, she was half shark. Instead of pulling oxygen from the air, her kind could take in water and then let their gills oxygenate their bloodstream. And as a hybrid, she had the luxury of choosing which respiratory method to use...though right now the choice was made for her.

She clenched her hoodie in clammy hands and tried to fight back tears as the task became clear. The ringing in her ears let her know that oxygen-deprivation was prodding her brain. It was now or never.

She pursed her small lips nice and deep against the phoenix's spats, relaxed her body, and *sucked* as much "water" as she could from the sodden unwashed fabric clinging to Kiara's crotch. It was a stuttering, grotesque noise like finishing off a milkshake with a clogged straw, and every liquid particle that flew past her lips was swimming with warm stale sweat and heavily stained with the heady musk of Kiara's taint. The taste made her gag horribly but she pressed on for the sake of survival.

None of this mortal struggle was apparent to Kiara, however. Yes, she could feel some pitiful movements beneath her cheeks and strange vibrations against her cunt, but she assumed Gura was simply getting grumpy about her punishment.

In the meantime Kiara still had a class to teach, so she cupped her hands and called out to the other members across the dance floor. “Okay, break time's over, girls! Let's run through the second half until lunch!”

The rest of Myth did a double take as they processed Gura's new predicament. Anything above her hoodie's neckline all but disappeared under Kiara's thick ass and thighs, and there was already a small gleaming puddle forming beneath the head of the bench. The question on everyone's lips was the same; *Can she even breath under there?*

Calli adjusted her hair and nervously tried to broach the subject. “Uh, sure, dude. But are you sure you wanna direct us from all the way over there?”

“It's fine, I just need to catch my breath for a bit. I'll join you girls later.” Kiara leaned back and prompted a pained groan from her seat. “I'll watch from here and call out any mistakes like usual. So, come on, let's take it from the top!”

* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *

Sure enough, Kiara's tutelage continued for another half hour and she was able to shore up her friends' sloppy movements even without physically demonstrating it. She got pretty into their performance and bounced up and down on Gura's face with glee when they made particularly big strides, her fat cheeks wobbling and squeezing more stagnant sweat from her spats down the sides of Gura's head.

Lunchtime rolled around and the girls shared a few high-fives before meandering over to Kiara's station. From what they could tell, Gura was still conscious and still in obvious discomfort.

“Yikes. Looks pretty *taihen* under there. Has she been chillin' there the whole time?”

“Eh? Yeah, I guess so.” There was a soft squelching sound as Kiara absentmindedly rocked on her hips. “I kinda lost track of time.”

Ina wiped her neck with a towel and spoke up on her friend's behalf. “Hmm, shouldn't you...get up at some point? She still needs to breathe, right?”

“Ah!” Kiara's face went white for a moment as she remembered that not everyone was an immortal being. “Um, of course! I-I was just about to!”

Just as she started leaning forward to potentially give Gura the first gulp of fresh air in over thirty minutes, Ame stepped forward with a sly grin and put her hand on Kiara's shoulder. “No, you're fine! Gura's an Atlantean, remember? She's got gills so it's super easy to breath even if something's, ahem, *blocking* her mouth, riiight~?”

“Oh...really?” Kiara laughed. “That's good, never mind then.” Relieved, she sat back down and took a bit more weight off her feet while Gura screamed in protest and disbelief. 

Of course Ame knew better than anyone that gills don't work like that. The only way Gura's been conscious this whole time, the detective reasoned, was by gargling and swallowing buckets of Kiara's salty, disgusting ass sweat (which was anything but “super easy”). And there was no way Ame was going to pass up a chance to keep her tiny aggressor under there even longer!

“Actually,” Ame continued, “we don't have to break for lunch right now. It's the last day, let's go all out! One more hour and I know we'll really blow 'em away on stage!” She looked around at the other members for support and their faces met hers, all eyes full of determination. They weren't use to Ame being so gung-ho about the idol stuff and it looked like they were ready to go all day if they had to.

Kiara's heart swelled at the display of before her. Something about it felt like the first true step to becoming worldwide sensations. “W-well if you insist. One more hour!”

The four girls cheered and hurried back to their formation in the middle of the room. On Kiara's side, it was nice to have more downtime. Especially since she didn't have to worry about Gura anymore.

* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * *

HoloMyth threw everything they had into Ame's encore session. Their rhythm, movement, posing-- everything was perfect, almost professional grade. Kiara couldn't be more proud. But in the middle of cheering on her friends and pumping her imaginary glow sticks, a small hot fart slipped out between her cheeks and blasted across Gura's nose.

Kiara's body froze in place, eyes wide and mouth locked in an awkward smile as a heavy red blush spread across her cheeks. She was mortified. The other members halted mid-dance and looked towards her with concern.

*Shit, shit! Did they hear that?!* Kiara struggled to keep a straight face while her internal monologue tore itself apart.

Ina broke the silence and called out to her. “Oi! Everything okay over there?”

“Y-yeah, my leg just cramped us for a second. Um, can you play it back from the first part?”

“...Sure, no problem.” Ame went over to reset the track. “You're looking really red, you sure you're okay?”

“Don't worry, I guess there's just too much excitement for me to handle right now!” Kiara forced out a laugh and clasped her hands in her lap. She seemed safe for now.

 *Thank God they didn't hear that.* Kiara looked down at the poor seat that had just endured a face full of her gas. *I guess she's had enough.* Fun was fun, but that was definitely too cruel. Besides, Kiara's bottom felt downright soggy after sitting for so long and she really needed to air it out.

But when Kiara tried to stand up and liberate Gura from her musky prison, her legs didn't respond. Her muscles were still so exhausted that everything below her waist felt like molded lead.

*Eh? Seriously?* Panic set in and fresh beads of sweat ran down her neck. Not only was she apparently locked in place but, based on the rumbling and cramping in her stomach, her body wasn't even *close* to being done.

*Fuck! Now what?*. There's no way she could hold these back, not after the generous spread of sausage, jam slathered bread rolls, and boiled eggs she stuffed herself with for breakfast earlier. It gave her plenty of energy to power through practice, but she always needed to excuse herself and “lay an egg” before lunch time, those idol meetings guaranteed to be accompanied with plenty of bassy, bowl-echoing farts.

She couldn't call for help either. What if they heard something while helping her to her feet? Or smelled something walking towards her? No...there was only one option.

Kiara pushed on the edge of the bench and slowly shifted her hips forwards. She didn't have the strength to lift herself fully off Gura's face, so she simply scooted forward and smeared her sweaty pussy and taint over Gura's lips along the way like a discarded towel. The taste of the phoenix's crotch was a rose garden compared to what came next.

*Yosh! There we go!* The weight of Kiara's fat, trashcan-flattening ass forced open Gura's jaw and her steamy anus was now flexing directly over Gura's tongue. The additional heat from Gura's panicked breath caused a few musky droplets to coalesce on the wrinkles of Kiara's spats-covered asshole and drip down onto Gura's tongue, the rancid tang making her shiver in fear and disgust.

“Ah, sorry about this, Gura.” Kiara did her best to prepare her unwilling fart cushion for what would surely be the worst hour of her life. “These are gonna be really bad...so just remember to breathe through your gills, okay?” Kiara knew firsthand how terrible these would smell. During her streams Kiara would take the time to get up and gas out the bathroom just to make sure she didn't have to sit in her own stink. So to have someone else huff it straight from the source...well, she tried not to think about it.

Gura felt Kiara's shitpipe straining on her lips, barely holding back the avalanche of gaseous waste building up inside. Her hands slapped at Kiara's thighs once more but accomplished nothing aside from leaving pale pinks marks on her captors flesh. 

Kiara needed to carefully manage the flow to make sure it wasn't too loud, so she leaned to the right and slightly relaxed her asshole. A soft hissing sound droned out from between her cheeks for a few unbroken seconds that abruptly ended in a wet, bubbly sputter as Kiara briefly lost control. Gura's entire body lurched upwards and shook the bench in the wake of Kiara's reeking ass fumes suddenly soaking the inside of her mouth. Her cries for mercy were at an all-time high.

Kiara's eyes darted nervously to her genmates. Thankfully they were none the wiser and continued practicing as usual. *Phew. Safe again. I gotta be more careful...* Kiara waited for Gura to exhaust herself and then shifted to the left cheek to try again, pushing out just enough to relieve her bloated guts without ripping obnoxiously loud ass.

It went much smoother this time and, to her relief, the noise was nicely muffled within Gura's open maw. Kiara herself could barely hear it, though she could certainly *feel* her farts seeping out of her asshole and heating up her crack to an almost uncomfortable degree. 

Confident in her fart-absorber, Kiara bit her bottom lip and pushed even harder, expelling a utterly rancid stream of hot gas point-blank into Gura's mouth. The soaking wet blast filtered through Kiara's filthy spats and dredged up a thick mist of stagnant sweat. The droplets peppered Gura's tongue and the back of her throat in waves, triggering a deep guttural retching as the sour tang burned into her taste buds. Though she didn't know it at the time, the hellish taste of Kiara's release would sit on her tongue for weeks.

Gura violently arched her back in agony and her hands flailed wildly against Kiara's thighs. No matter how much the smaller girls grabbed, squeezed and slapped Kiara's bubbly cheeks, her tormentor remained unmoved. If anything, it only further jostled Kiara's stomach and brewed up a fresh batch to pump down her throat.

“Ahhn, *Scheiße* , I needed that.” Kiara's lips fell into a blissful smile and she yanked the damp collar of her shirt, releasing visible bouts of steam from the stuffy confines of her impressive cleavage. It was so oppressively hot in that studio and she got even sweatier straining to push these out in secret. Every time Kiara ripped ass, her crack got hotter and muggier, making the following explosion that much more vile. It was both incredible and immensely cruel that Gura was still conscious under there.

Kiara went back to her coaching duties and casually let a few more wet farts splutter out her asshole to further drown Gura's tongue in foul-tasting semi-liquid gas. There was so much now that it was *pooling* in the back of Gura's tiny throat and her tongue writhed uselessly in sea of salty ass sweat. 

While her plan was working so far, Kiara still had her concerns. Based on the heat and pressure pressing up on her asshole, she knew Gura's mouth was reaching capacity. Who knew what kinds of smell or noises would blubber out if it overflowed?

Fortunately her worries were soon abated. She looked down and saw Gura's throat bobbing up and down as she finally relented and swallowed down all the rank ass sweat and spat-scented farts that had been collecting in her mouth. Gura would have been sobbing, but her face was mashed so far into Kiara's sweaty backside that there wasn't any room for tears to form.

Perfect! Kiara was free to do as she pleased for the remainder of her time now that Gura would be chugging her farts as quickly as they came out. She yawned, stretched her arms high above her head, and got back to work fumigating Gura's throat.

Such was Gura's unenviable existence for the next hour. Because Kiara was so measured and careful with dumping her waste, there seemed to be a bottomless supply of silent, greasy farts to choke down. The taste sometimes got too much for Gura and she would start violently retching and coughing into Kiara's butt. These outbursts were a huge annoyance for Kiara who had to lift her feet fully off the ground and press down with all her weight to make sure nothing escaped. After a few rounds of that, Gura got the message and performed her duties quietly.

All this was carried out with perfect stealth and not once did the other girls ask if Gura was doing alright. The only one who even really paid attention was Ame, who took many opportunities to watch the shark girl's tortured frame in the corner of her eye and drink in her misery. She might have to try that with Gura herself some time.

“Annd pose!” The song ended and Kiara, despite merely sitting in one place for the last two hours, was still dripping with sweat and out of breath after cheering them on so hard. She ushered the rest of Myth over to her and gave them some final pointers before suggesting a place to go for lunch and celebration. They decided on a well reviewed restaurant on the east side of town and started gathering their things, but there was still one small problem: even after all her silent releases, Kiara had barely expelled half the gas storm bubbling in her guts and it had been increasingly painful to keep it held in. She didn't want the girls, or herself for that matter, to deal with the aftereffects.

“What's wrong, Kiara? Aren't you coming?”

“Hm? Yeah, just...uh, getting the blood pumping again. My legs still feel asleep, this might take a while.”

“You need a hand, dude? I can help-”

“I'm fine! Go on without me, I'll catch up!” It was a bit rude but Kiara was getting desperate. Whatever was pressing against her backdoor right now was going to be wet and *loud*, no matter what she unloaded into.

Like a descending angel, Ame came to her rescue. “C'mon guys, she's had a long day.” Ame swiftly corralled the girls out the door and looked back at Kiara with a knowing smile. “Take your time, we can order ahead if you need it!”

The door swung shut, leaving Kiara and Gura as the only warm bodies in the room. The air was dead silent and still swirling with sweat and pheromones in the wake of Myth's session.

Finally, she could let everything out.

Kiara crossed her arms under her massive tits and looked down on Gura's diminutive form, thoroughly beaten into submission after being gassed out for two straight hours. A sadistic smile crept across Kiara's face and she allowed herself to be a bit haughty now that the danger of being found out was gone. After all, Gura had been acting like a real brat this past week. This was the least of what this *samegaki* deserved.

“Hahh? Wanting to get back to dance practice now, I bet?” Kiara swiveled her hips and ground her spats into Gura's face. She was sweating bullets now, every speck of exposed skin was shiny and slick and she could feel individual beads trickling down her pits and lower back.

“This is why you should just listen to Kiara. I hope-” A low, angry gurgle of Kiara's stomach cut her off. She grimaced and reached to undo the button of her miniskirt's waistband, giving the pudge of her bloated tummy a bit more room. “Ahem, like I was saying, I hope this is a-*nghh*-good lesson for you!”

Kiara grit her teeth and trumpeted out an overwhelming rancid, skull-shaking fart, surely enough to clear a room if not contained by her “cushion”. It blasted apart the pool of sweat collected in Gura's mouth and scattered it against her teeth and tongue like a mini hurricane, the sheer volume of foul winds painfully puffing out her cheeks to maximum capacity. Gura winced and sobbed as the putrid gas backfilled and traveled up her abused sinuses, saturating her nasal cavity with greasy, extra thick, nose-burning phoenix farts.

There was too much to handle. It easily broke the seal Gura's lips had been forced into making and rushed though the tight sweaty crevices where Kiara's spats met her face. With nowhere else to go, it simply erupted beneath Kiara's plump pussy lips or funneled down her ass crack and up Gura's stinging nostrils.

*“Ahhh...”* Kiara relished the warm feeling of relief as she slouched in her seat and let the rest sputter out. Her spats were *definitely* stained after that one but she was planning to throw them out anyway.

She let Gura marinate in her stench for a while in the hope that the smaller girl would swallow or snort down most of her gas. When she did get around to standing up, thick, slimy strings of ass sweat still clung to her cheeks and Gura's features.

Gura's face was a mess: Flushed red, steaming, and dripping with anal refuse. The fringes of her hair were soaked, discolored, and plastered to her skin like she'd just been waterboarded. Before she could even open her tired eyes, her tiny chest hitched and pumped a sizable torrent of saliva and sweat past her lips. It splattered against her neck and continued drooling down her chin. Gura's tears, now given the space to form and fall, mixed imperceptibly with the stinking puddle of various juices covering her face. She didn't have the strength to reach up, so she pleaded in a raspy voice below a whisper. “I'm sorry, Kiara...p-please don't-”

*PLAP!*

Without a second thought, Kiara plopped her dump truck ass back on Gura's face and wiggled into position. That breakfast *really* did a number on her and her stomach was still cramping, maybe even worse than before. Better down Gura's throat than stinking up the house or the restaurant, after all. She pulled out her phone and started browsing through her social media while Gura sobbed uncontrollably beneath her.

*Oh yeah, I should let the girls know.* Kiara's fingers tapped across the screen and sent out a single text message.

`Hey Ame im gonna be busy. Can you bring me something back for lunch?`
