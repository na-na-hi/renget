>we do our wrestling, rain or hot, usually we make it muddy before hand
>plenty of fake stunts to make em scream
>the human, is a cowboy, humans for some reason LOVE to see humans dominate anthros, so he usually ties his victims up by the end, he's athletic, but not super muscular like us gators, so he is allowed to go full force and doesn't do much damage
>night shows do the best, we usually have around 500 people in the old wooden bleachers, and even more standing around the wrestling pen
>with 10$ an entry, we make bank
>been trying to get into the human's pants, flirt with him often in between our matches
>find out when he's blackout during a bar craw that he has a thing for anthros, like a really big thing for anthros
>was DD, so i wasn't drunk, but might have fucked him then if i was as full of liquor as him
>convince everyone we can make more money if we offer adult only shows, with naked wrestling, uping admission to 20$
>some are reluctant, but agree it would be a good business decision
>others don't care because hey, might as well give em what they want.
>i usually plan the line up, so i put me and him last, and advertise the fuck out of it
>NAKED WRESTLING SHOW, ADULTS ONLY, THE TAMER AND THE BEAST, NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT STARTING AT 8 PM
>post places unhappy suburban moms and gay men will be, gay bars, the wine aisle of the liquor store, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, you name it
>mentally prepare myself all week
>i can't wait!
>3.5 hours till the match
>it's around 6 when i arrive to our jankey venue, trash but charming
>i set up the lights, clock everyone in, etc. trying so hard to keep my nerves down
>3 hours, 6:30
>the guys start the concessions, again, it's just over priced junk food and drinks.
>2.5 hours, 7:00
>we allow admission to start, mix of men and women, looks like we did a good advertising job.
>1.5 hours 8:00, game time
>i put on my usual outfit, without the speedo, i would take of the loin cloth before the start of the match >i was waiting in a shed used for pre-performance activities.
>i talk with the human "regular show, except i tie you up at the end, make it dramatic"
>"are you sure the people will like that?" he replies
>"your conquer gimmick only works for insecure old dudes, and only human insecure old dudes"
>"yeah i guess that's true"
>"the people out there want to see man candy manhandle some little guy and present that's them" i continued with my argument
>he shrugged "guess i could give it a try then" he said finally.
>1 hour until our match 9:00
>we have a 30 minute intermission between the first block of matches, i realized it was less than an hour before our match, considering it would end around 10:30
>i was grinning from ear to ear, the human was on his phone, I'm so glad he couldn't see my face
>less than 30 minutes till our match, i was visiblely nervous
>the human spoke "hey, we're on in soo-... are you ok?"
>"yeah... it's just..." i paused
>"busy night?” he completed the thought
>"yeah" i said looking down at my feet.
>it's time.
>we're bing announced
>"and now the moment you've been waiting for..."
>just minutes before we're set to start
>I've lost the flirty luster i have around the human, but he seems to be extra confident
>"hey, down here!" he gestures for me to lean down to talk to him
>"good luck out there!" he says, them kissing me on the cheek.
>he runs out on his queue, the crowd is screaming
>i pause red faced, getting a semi, trying to be professional, i still had to put on a good show
>the human drops his pants, and he's hung
>i mean, REALLY hung, a veined uncut monster, thicker near the middle, with a complementary pair of hanging balls
>the crowd roars
>it was clear this match would be less about stunts and playing a character, and more about two men rubbing their naked bodies together for around 45 to an hour
>he's showing off his body from all sorts of angles, letting the viewers ogle him, if he was gonna be naked, he was gonna make sure these people came back
>looking back it was mostly for me, he would glace at me and wink every so often
>i can't hide my boner and decide to go without my loin cloth, i can see him pause for a split second, looking at my own dick, not as big as his, but big enough to make his cock start to chub
>after his sexy but shameless display, i was given my own long introduction
>i was called in
>"welcome, The Beast!"
>the crowd resumes their yelling, i can feel their eyes on me but the only eyes i care about are his
>still, i flex and pose for the onlookers, showing my ass, muscles, and cock
>we take positions near the edge of the ring in anticipation for the match to begin
>i raise my club and he raises his lasso
>i stare into his eyes waiting for the bell
>and then!....
>CLANG!
>we rush towards eachother
>i swing a few times which he dodges, i finally hit him in the ribs with the rubber club, gently of course
>he falls onto his back, i tower over him, bearing my teeth, and raising my arms
>"no man tames this beast!"
>he scurries out from under me and throws his lasso around my bicep pulling my on my arm
>i move back and fall down in my back, he sits on my chest, and bobs like he's riding a horse.
>i yell and beging wrestling him in the mud, knocking him off me
>the indescribable bliss of u frosting and we pressed ourselves against each other
>we went like this for a while, one of us breaks loose, almost pins the other, we even switched props at some point
>i ended up tying his hands and throwing him over my back
>"the man is mine!" i scream into the crowd
>they cheer as i lick my lips, and turn and leave with
>as i leave, i go through the shed and pick up some lube from my locker, on my way to the showers, we had built in the way back for the wrestlers
>"are you going to let me go big guy?"
>i grin
>" i would, but we need to talk first"
>"oh yeah? what about"
>"remind me not to trust you secrets, because you spill when you're drunk, if you wanted to get in my pants, i wish you would have told me sooner"
>i put him down and untie him
>"how much did you hear?"
>"enough"
>i reach down and fondle his cock, both of us covered in mud
>"i see you in the shower" i take off my necklace and walk out of the the back door, making sure my ass went back and forth as i walked out the door.
>we would have total privacy, the other wrestlers were already gone, the rest of the gators would handle the crowds and close up
>I start the shower, letting the hot water roll over my body, washing the grime and dirt off of my me
>the human enters, taking the shower directly next to me
>i watch him lather and wash his whole body, maintaining a semi
>when he's clean, i kneel in front of him
>he lays his hands on my head
>i push his hands to the wall behind him
>"i know a lot more than you think, especially how much of a sub you are."
>i enjoy the look of horny fear in his eyes
>he gets rock hard
>"i guess i should keep off the whiskey huh?"
>i don't answer, only taking some of his cock in my mouth, my tongue dancing around his cock
>he moans like a little bitch, his charming resolve thus, dissolved.
>i spit his dick out
>"maybe you should?" i say finally answering his question
>i stood up and decided to return his little kiss
>silently, without warning I gave him the deepest tongue kiss i could give, holding his cheeks, he kissed me back.
>i pulled out of the kiss to see an awestruck face of bliss.
>"that's for earlier"
>i grabbed the lube from the shower floor and made sure i was nice and slick
>i turned to face him, staring into his eyes as i lubed him, listening to his little gasps of pleasure
>he tried to lean in to kiss me again but i pushed him back
>"don't worry now, it gets better than that~"
>i turned around and got in position, of course i started slow to let him position himself, but after that I got faster and faster, only slowing down when i thought he would cum
>he was definitely a screamer i listened to his "OH FUCK's" and "pleeease let me cum!" the whole night
>i was pounding him against the wall using all of my alligator strength
>when i finally let him cum, you'd swear he had a seizure right then and there
>i don't think he's shot that much in me since
>although he's not to privy to edging anymore
>after that he wasn't much of a drinker
>but he sure spend a lot of his free nights at my place
>the end
