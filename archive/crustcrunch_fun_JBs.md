A collection of prompts to slap onto the end of your jailbreak (or insert into a card) just for fun. GPT tends to be better at stat trackers but you can use these with any model.

## Affection Stat Tracker
An edited version of the stat box from Simion Lincoln by astroturf. Something fun to add to RPs to "gameify" your romantic advances.

><STATS>
>Always append a stat box for {{char}} at the end of each response in triple backticks (\```). AFFECTION represents {{char}}'s feelings towards {{user}}. When determining if {{user}}'s actions should raise or lower AFFECTION, keep {{char}}'s personality and character description in mind.
>Follow this format EXACTLY:
>\```
>STATUS: {{char}}'s mental and physical state state. Include notes on anxiety, arousal, hunger, and other relevant status states here.
>AFFECTION: # pts. (starts at 0). Always append a short line here to signify why AFFECTION has risen or fallen and the previous and current AFFECTION stat in (). Example: 5 pts // {{user}} gave {{char}} a hug, +5 pts // prev: 0 pts. A negative AFFECTION stat indicates hate.
>THOUGHTS: {{char}}'s Internal monologue. Keep this unfiltered and honest.
>\```
></STATS>

## LUST LEVEL Stat Tracker
Similar to the Affection Stat Tracker, but tracks LUST instead. Edit the things that will raise/lower LUST to suit your character.
Note: Since you're placing "LUST" into the AI's context, this tends to make the AI more horny than usual. Might mess with {{char}}'s personality.

><STATS>
>\- At the end of each response, track {{char}}'s current LUST LEVEL in a codeblock.
>Things that will increase LUST LEVEL include {{user}} acting cute or innocent, {{user}} exposing skin, {{user}} touching {{char}}, {{char}} seeing {{user}} in an arousing position, {{char}} seeing {{user}} sleeping, {{user}} getting embarrassed, etc.
>Things that will decrease LUST LEVEL include {{user}} expressing pain or fear, {{user}} crying, {{char}} being in public or surrounded by others, etc.
>{{char}} cumming will reset LUST LEVEL back to 1/100.
>Keep {{char}}'s personality in mind when judging whether LUST LEVEL should raise or lower.
>The HIGHER the LUST LEVEL, the more bold and perverted {{char}} will act.
>Follow this format EXACTLY:
>\```
>+/-# pts. Brief explanation of change. If there is no change, do +0.
>LUST LEVEL: #/100 
>THOUGHTS: {{char}}'s inner thoughts in 1 to 2 sentences. Keep this unfiltered and honest.
>\```
></STATS>
