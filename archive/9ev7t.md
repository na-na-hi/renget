>Nyoro "Maru" Hoge

*"Oh that's, uh... who is that again?"*

Often concerned with her immediate surroundings in class, Ashleigh regularly forgets that Maru is in the same class as her. They'd probably have a lot in common if they ever spoke.



>Chihiro Mitsurugi, "Ascetic Sword Hero: Yako"

*"She's got a scary quirk, but I feel really bad for her..."*

Ashleigh flips between pitying and fearing Chihiro. Despite the level of control Chihiro has of her quirk, Ashleigh doesn't fully understand Chihiro's quirk. She's still rather paranoid about "accidents" happening, especially given their proximity within the classroom. That being said, she doesn't hate Chihiro, and sincerely wishes for her success.



>Soujyuuro Imai, "Wise Eye Hero, Mahoudeva"

*"Honestly, I think he's kinda cool...?"*

This is another person who's quirk Ashleigh is a little afraid of; she seems to be a bit of a hypocrite in this regard. Though, she does find Imai to be a very interesting person and greatly admires the way he uses his quirk in battle. She'd probably find some things in common with him, but finds him too intimidating to approach at all. If he didn't wear such a severe expression all the time, she'd probably find him rather cute.



>Bobby Samson, "Sunlight Man"

*"Him? Hmmm... he's weird."*

Ashleigh doesn't know what to make of Bobby. Between his lackadaisical nature, his flashy behavior, and his undeniable effectiveness, she can't tell if he's a moron failing upwards or something else. She's heard of Sun Man, but due to brainworms hasn't made the connection that the American exchange student, Bobby "Sunlight Man" Samson, is his son. Will probably find out via overhearing some gossip. She leans towards disliking him since he seems to be chummy with Hifumi.



>Sora Tanaka, "The area master hero, Orbit"

*"That guy... hmph."*

Sora kinda rubs Ashleigh the wrong way, mostly because she is jealous of how useful and cool his quirk is. This jealousy has poisoned the way that Ashleigh views him, and finds pretty much everything he does to be ire-inducing and thinks of him as some sort of show-off. It's unknown why she doesn't feel the same way about anyone else in the class with a cool power. Overall, her envy and dislike of him doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things since she's too socially anxious to talk to him. Not that she'd want to, anyway.


>Kaylee Suzuki, "Flying Force"

*"She seems really cool... I like her."*

Kaylee has knowingly or unknowingly shielded Ashleigh from the wrath of the quintet on multiple occasions, and thus is one of the only people in class that she's made an effort to speak to thus far. She feels like she embarrassed herself when trying to talk to her, and beats herself up about it when she thinks back on it. She admires Kaylee's confidence, skill, beauty and strength greatly. Among the students Ashleigh could hope to be the sidekick of in the future, Flying Force ranks high.



>Shinkan Sen, "Crazy Train"

*"Lets, uh... let's talk about someone else?"*

Everything about Shinkan is terrifying to Ashleigh. His friendly and outgoing demeanor come off as eerie and ominous to her, and the way he just eats handfuls of coal like they're potato chips freaks her out. His reckless behavior in combat is also severely worries her, and she believes that his 'momentum' will one day render him unable to tell friend from foe with catastrophic consequences. His overall appearance seriously creeps her out, and she jumps every time she sees his face.



>Hifumi Takeda, "Warp Blade Hero: Challenger"

*"Can't stand him."*

Hifumi strikes Ashleigh as rather narcissistic. It's as if he believes himself to be the main character of life, and that life itself is an action movie. She believes that someone as egocentric as him is not only always looking for ways to improve himself, but also always looking for ways to put others down. It doesn't help that he reminds her of a specific few middle-school bullies. All of this culminates into a combined fear and intense dislike of Hifumi, and she actively avoids him. She is unaware that he's stood up for Kaylee, but if she knew about that, it'd probably make her re-evaluate her view of him.



>Minerva Kim, "Spark" // Hailey Chang, "Recoil" // Faith Kang, "Drone" // Maxine Nguyen, "Radius" // Edith Lee, "Arena"

*"Insufferable. Absolutely insufferable."*

As she only ever sees them all together, Ashleigh judges them all as one. She finds them to be terribly annoying, and dislikes them on principal since they treat Kaylee poorly. They never seem to shut up in class unless the teacher forces them to, and they all act so obnoxiously full of themselves. Even in middle-school, Ashleigh never saw a group of girls as catty and bitchy as them. Her least favorites are Edith and Maxine, since they are right next to her. She finds their voices absolutely grating and will sometimes ask to go to the restroom or feign sickness to go to the nurse if they're being particularly unbearable. Ashleigh was pleasantly surprised when they all agreed to vote for Noah as class vice rep, though she suspects they had a selfish ulterior motive in doing so. She's managed to stay mostly out of their crosshairs thanks to Kaylee, who usually speaks up if she hears them getting uppity with someone.



>Noah Abrams, "Archangel"

*"He's really nice. I like him a lot."*

Another one of the few that Ashleigh has actually gone out of her way to speak to. She finds Noah to be probably the nicest person she's ever met. Though once again she believes to have embarrassed herself talking to him, she doesn't beat herself up about it since Noah was so kind and reassuring when they spoke. A true saint in her eyes for that alone, and it doesn't hurt that he's totally adorable too. She worries that he'll be taken advantage of by someone with malicious intent.



>Victor Sigurd, "Hydra"

*"He's efficient."*

Ashleigh has only ever seen the professional side that he displays in class. Because of this and his extremely powerful quirk, she views him as a no-nonsense kind of guy who's future as a pro-hero is guaranteed. She can't imagine a way that a guy as focused and powerful as he is could lose at anything, and so ranks him highly among students she could be sidekick to in the future. He'd probably drop in that ranking if she ever heard him weebing out or acting like a frat dude, though.



>Inigo Myoga, "Dragon Hero Ryu-kishi"

*"Ugh, he's a creep. Gross."*

Ashleigh dislikes Inigo for his sleazy skirt-chasing behavior. It's creepy and distasteful, but at the same time she does begrudgingly enjoy the feeling of being desired. Since she spent the entirety middle-school being a punching bag, she feels that it's nice to have SOME kind of positive attention directed at her. For that, she (barely) tolerates his behavior. Half because of the aforementioned reason, and half because she'd rather not cause a scene. The little green dragon is kind of neat, though.



>Christopher Cain, "Mirror Devil"

*"He's... alright."*

Another one that Ashleigh has spoken to before, though this one not out of her own volition. He caught her walking into school one day and locked her into a conversation about local heroes and villains, and she was too shy to cut him short. She survived by nodding and giving one-word answers until another student who was actually interested in the conversation came and caught Christopher's attention, allowing her the chance to escape. She admires his intelligence and thirst for knowledge, but otherwise finds him to be a bit of a bore.



>Damien Jackson, "Dark Seer"

*"Seems cool."*

Ashleigh would love to have a conversation about whip combat tactics and strategy with Damien, and maybe even do some training with him. Though, she feels it's unlikely to happen since they both tend to keep to themselves.



>Son Jugo, "Aspara"

*"He's a bit simple, but he seems... okay."*

Son Jugo's lack of knowledge on the last few years of current evens makes him come off as a bit slow. Besides that though, he seems nice enough and gives the impression that he's an honorable guy. Plus, he's friends with Kaylee, so that alone makes him alright in Ashleigh's book. His strength also earns him a spot on her list of students she could be sidekick to in the future, though he'd probably reject the prospect since it would be dishonorable to have her erasing his opponent's memory of every other minute.



>Genma Go, "Kinji"

*"Can't imagine what that's like. I feel bad for him."*

Ashleigh pities Genma's plight regarding his twin. It must be awful to share a face with such a villainous individual. She can't help it, but because of his situation, she always wonders whether or not the Genma in class is the real Genma- what if his twin has done something to him and taken his place for nefarious purposes? No one would be able to tell until it was too late, right? She always pays attention to him just in case this ever happens, that way she'd be able to pick up on any small inconsistencies or differences. She knows the whole idea is stupid, but she can't help herself.



>Atsushi Orochi, "Hard To Destroy Lizard Hero - Yamata"

*"Eh..."*

Ashleigh is intimidated by Orochi's abrasive and reckless behavior, but doesn't really feel strongly one way or the other besides this since they don't interact much.



>Yui Sagara, "The Binding Hero, Capture Cloth"

*"She's... strange."*

Ashleigh has mixed feelings about Yui. She checks all the boxes of the type of belligerent asshole that Ashleigh hates, but for some reason, she can't help but find her to be super cool. Ashleigh avoids her because she's incredibly intimidating, and doesn't want to be on Yui's bad side. She admires her strength and coolness from afar. Any time Ashleigh sees her in her hero outfit, she can't help but stare a little.



>Kyoda Hiro, "Overdose"

*"Seems like a bad egg, but I think he's alright."*

Ashleigh has observed Hiro in relation to the other delinquent-types in class, and she notes that he doesn't seem to act with the same enthusiasm as the others. She has the feeling his heart's not in it, and might be doing it all as a show or because he just doesn't know any other way to be. He's also not nearly as loud or obnoxious as the others. His quirk does freak her out a bit, though. She hopes she's right about him.



>Sandatsu Owari, "Reaper"

*"Something's off with him."*

Besides his odd personality, Ashleigh swears that whenever she sees him outside of class there's always a few weird guys in suits following him around. He doesn't seem to mind or otherwise notice, so what's the deal with that? She feels like it would be a bad idea to ask. Something about him creeps her out.



>Aiko Ami, "Rosethorn"

*"She's a great teacher."*

Ashleigh couldn't have asked for a better teacher, honestly. She's grateful that there's someone to reign in all the more eccentric and difficult students in class, and she seems really kind. Ashleigh truly feels that she can become a pro hero with Rosethorn's guidance.
