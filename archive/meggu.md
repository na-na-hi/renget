Sad, genuine smile. Ch. 3.

Kanata's mood had greatly improved. She was a lot more cheerful on stream, participating more during collabs, as if she had a newfound confidence, and everyone took notice of it, her chat, her genmates, her senpai, and specially, you. She was getting along way better with Towa both on stream and off stream, or so said your girlfriend, about how she spoke to everyone more and hung out with them more often. 

The following days after your last encounter had dissipated the black clouds that once hanged above you both. Neither spoke to each other, as if nothing happened, but a certain weight had been lifted from your shoulders. In your head, it was because Kanata cried in your arms, letting out a bottled-up torrent of feelings stream down her face and you saved your relationship trusting her to keep her mouth shut, selectively shutting out what happened after from your reasoning. 

The sun rises anew, and you basked in its warm embrace.

~*~

“Nom!” Towa laughed loudly as you nibbled her tummy and licked her near her belly button. 

“Haha, Anon please stop! I can’t take this anymore!” You locked your arms around her waist but kept them loose enough just in case she really wanted you to stop as you kept assaulting her belly. Giving her a break, Towa caught her breath slowly, looking endearingly at you resting your head on her stomach, rubbing your cheek up and down against it.

Towa ran her fingers through your hair, massaging your head and scratching you with her nails. Her face turned a bright red as she spoke to you.

“Hey Anon, get up.”

“Nnno.” You pouted.

“Come on! It benefits you.” Said Towa in a cute voice. You let go of her and she told you to rest against the head of the bed, and so, you two swapped positions, with Towa snuggling you in your chest. She drew circles around your pecs before giving you a mischievous look and slowly reaching for your pants. A boner popped almost immediately, which filled Towa’s hand and made her pant.

Towa lowered herself to your hips, undid your pants and slipped your underwear down rather quickly, causing your erect penis to hit her cheek.

“Uwah! Geez, I guess you’re happy to see me Anon.” You chuckled heartily, and she was right. You could finally enjoy some time alone with your girlfriend, not only that, but you had finally gotten what you had longed for so long.

Towa was unsure of how to proceed, though, she squeezed your dick way too hard at first and made you jump in pain. She apologized immediately, trying to make up for it, she took you in her mouth, but her blowjob skills were subpar. Her teeth grazed you a bit too much at times, but you didn’t want to discourage her either, so instead you let out small hints in hopes she would follow them.

“Ah, yes, more tongue please~” You let out in a forced moan. Towa picked up on it and began slowly bringing her tongue forward, not without some shyness, as if she seemed unsure about licking your penis.

“Lick the tip, like a lollipop.” You said, and still with some timidity, Towa licked your head using the tip of her tongue.

“Not bad.” You lied to Towa. Your mind was seeing colors, shapes of green and purple, shapes of blue and white…

You told yourself to not be so rough on your girlfriend, who certainly was giving it her best.

You tapped your thighs to invite Towa to ride you, and swiftly she took off her shorts, exposing her well-toned legs from dancing and exercising, donning a purple tong on her hips, which she pulled to the side revealing her pussy accompanied by a bit of stubble above. Her thighs were impossibly smooth and milky, like a piece of the finest cloth, which feeling against your own, was enough for you to let out a huff that pleased Towa greatly. She lined your cock with her slit and slowly let you in, panting to herself every inch, and you relishing the moment you dreamed months ago.

Once inside though, Towa seemed unsure on what to do next. She moved in weird ways, her flexibility was something of notice, but often it felt as if she was going to snap your cock. You didn’t think she felt that good either, so you grabbed her waist and brought her down to your face, where you began kissing her and humping her behind yourself. Towa’s face changed almost immediately, letting out loud pants and moans.

“Ah~ Anon~! Oh~!” 

You grabbed her sweet butt cheeks with both hands and squeezed them how she liked it, a loud “*Oh-ho*!” escaped her mouth, which she covered immediately, before giggling to you as you continued.

Soon enough you were reaching your climax, before which you pulled out, hot dogged your dick between her cheeks and came on her bare back.

“*Ah! Hot!*” Towa said.

She fell on your chest and you reached for some wipes from the nightstand without moving from the bed, then began cleaning your cum from her.

Towa fell in your arms once more and you pat her head. Caressing her cheeks, you heard her speak. 

“A-Anon.” Towa muttered under her breath.

“Yes baby?” Being called that caught Towa off guard, but she didn’t dislike it, you thought, her face was beet red.

“D-Did you like it?” Towa asked expectantly.

“Eh…” You had already let that sound out of your mouth, everything coming after it would be a blatant lie, so you were sincere with her. “There’s room for improvement. Nothing that we can’t work out together.” Still, you felt like you put her down, so you added something to make her smile. “Above all, I’m just happy that I got to do this with you.” Towa’s eyes lit up, she looked at you with puppy eyes and gave you an honest kiss on your lips. A kiss so sweet and short, you could’ve easily been sent to heaven in that exact moment, by a devil, nonetheless.

“I love you Anon.” Said Towa in a voice that could melt an iceberg. You returned the kiss with much love from the depths of your heart.

“I love you too, baby.”

A few days went by, Towa tried her best, but it wasn’t enough. She was too scrupulous when handling your penis with her mouth or hands, and her awkward hip movements made you wonder how could she dance so well but be so stiff in bed. You usually had to take the lead and fuck her in missionary or doggystyle, focusing as much as you could in what you felt to get into it. Her moans were hot, seeing Towa enjoy herself was great, her body also exceeded your expectations, but every time you made love to her, it felt like a chore, one that you were supposed to like for her sake. Saying one thing about your displeasure with her could’ve easily crushed her.

You remembered something one of your friends told you back in high school, a rather extroverted guy who swept girls off their feet.

“You’re not missing out on much by being a virgin Anon, bad sex is worse than no sex, but at least as a virgin you don’t know what it’s like to need it.” 

And now those words made loud noise in your head.

One time you even pretended to cum inside Towa just to get out of it. She freaked out before you told her you’d get her some plan B, and then she finally began calming down.

Towa spooned you, still breathing heavily from the thrill and the danger she thought she just went through.

“Anon…”

“Yeah, yeah, I’m sorry. I just…got lost in the heat of the moment.”

“No, no, it’s not that, I-I’m not mad.” Towa replied. “But… what do you think our kids would look like?”

With those words, you felt yourself die a little inside.

“Hey, if they come out like you, they’d be pretty cute.”  You spurted out in full honesty.

Towa chuckled to herself in happiness, as you stared above her head into the wall, seeing an empty, endless void.

Your heart beat her name, but your body ached for someone else.

~*~

Two weeks had passed after your last run in with Kanata.

She called you out of the blue, asking if you could see each other. You fumbled with your answer, but in the end, you agreed. You went to a small café near a shopping district, she asked for some tea, you asked for some coffee, Kanata also ordered some sweets which she ate with delight.

“So, what’s this about?” You asked Kanata before sipping your coffee wondering if maybe you two had an accident during that day, pre-cum can still get someone pregnant, you thought, shivering from the thought. She seemed surprised at your question as she finished eating a bit of her cake. 

“What do you mean? I just…” Kanata couldn’t finish her sentence, she quickly ate another bite of cake and accidentally choked, washing it down with some tea.

A brief silence ensued.

“I just wanted to…spend some time with you again.” She blushed at her own answer, and you too became flustered, among all the pastries in the menu, Kanata was the sweetest thing in this restaurant. “T-There’s nothing wrong with that, right?” She added. 

“E-Excuse me” You got up and left for the bathroom. Washing your face, all red from her comments, not only that, but your heart revving up like a motorbike, with each beat you felt it getting heavier and heavier. Towa didn’t know about Kanata, and Kanata knew, but didn’t care about Towa by this point. What was she plotting to do in the long run? Sooner or later, a walking lie begins limping. 

You had dug yourself deeper into the hole, the worst part was, you had no one to blame but yourself, and yet, you wanted to feel Kanata’s touch once more. After all, what else could have dragged you into this situation? All you had to do was ignore her as you said yourself, and even then, you failed to do so.

You pulled your shirt down by the neck trying to look for Towa’s hickey, but your skin had cleared up by this point, her love mark nowhere to be seen.

“Ah, it faded away…”

~*~

Loud panting accompanied moans coming from a cellphone.

Coco was masturbating furiously watching lesbian porn on it. The two girls had a notable difference in size, which made her self-inserting easier by a long shot.

Coco watched in delight as the actresses ate each other eat out.

“Ka….Ka….” She muttered to herself in between breaths.

The scene changed suddenly as the taller one put on a fleshy looking strap-on.

Coco paid close attention as the toy entered her partner, before a sudden flash of images made her lose her focus, she moved her tongue inside of her mouth, trying to comfort herself.

Kanata’s silhouette, during the sleepover, riding you in absolute darkness. 

Coco rubbed herself harder, trying to get back on track, but the image of her beloved tenshi getting fucked by someone else set off a sad, impotent rage inside of her.

“Grrah!” Coco accidentally cracked her phone screen with her hand, the image going completely black, but she could still hear the moans of the actress through an undamaged speaker, without thinking, she crushed the device in her hand, and slowly began sobbing.

She turned to the empty spot on her bed, searching with her arms for something, finding only loneliness. Then, she began sniffing her sheets trying to find any lingering of a scent she missed so much, but her nose couldn’t tell any smells apart as it started dripping.

“Kanata…Kanata…” Sobbed Coco, nude, in a bed that had become too big for her.

“A-Aman…”

~*~

“I’m gonna stay at Coco’s place next week.” Said Kanata, putting her phone down.

“Eh? Really?” You replied, laying across the bed, spooning Kanata’s naked body in the darkness of her room.

“Yup”

You felt like asking questions, but kept them to yourself, Kanata answered them anyways.

“It’s just for a few days, though, rent is cheaper in that sector, so I’m gonna try to get an apartment over there.”

“Oh” 

For a split second you thought Kanata was trying to get back with Coco, but, even if that thought made you jealous, you were none to judge. After all, both of you were seeing each other behind Towa’s back and right under Coco’s nose.

Kanata turned over to you and gave you a smooch, letting out a soft laugh.

“I love you Anon.”

“And I love-“ Your words were caught short, as you realized that you almost said those words to someone other than Towa. Kanata took notice of this and turned back over.

“Sorry.” She said. “I got too cocky there.” You heard a sniffle and comforted Kanata.

“It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s not your fault.” You almost began crying too. “In fact, it’s only mine.”

Kanata’s sobs became worse, and all you could do was hold her, you’ve already said too much, you thought, but to her, you hadn’t said enough.

“S-Say it, please.” 

You weren’t shocked, much less agitated by her demand. Instead, you felt a void in your heart, one that had been hiding inside of you for quite some time now.

“H-Huh?”

“Even if it’s a lie, even if I’m just second to her… Please, I just want to hear you say it. Just once.”

Even thought you were already naked, you felt exposed down to your very soul, as if your chest had split open and your bleeding heart was sticking out like a sore thumb.

But then, you finally realized something.

“I love you too, Kanatan.” You had conflicted feelings about this moment. You had told no lies to anyone, not to Kanata, not to yourself, much less to your feelings for Towa, but saying it out loud, suddenly made the feelings of dread go away.

Slowly Kanata’s cries subsisted and she turned to you, giving you a heartfelt smile you could still see in the shadows.


Kanata moved in with Coco, who welcomed her with open arms. What originally was intended to be a one or two day stop, turned into a week long event, then one and a half weeks, then two. Kanata was still searching for a place in the zone after the one she intended to get was rented by someone else and apologized to Coco for overstaying, but to Coco, there was no such thing. During all that time, you didn’t see each other, you knew very well, her and Coco were having sex, you just felt it, the thought however, didn’t bother you at all. What were you supposed to say to her, to stop? Not after you yourself switched between her and Towa.

Your cookie cutter sex with Towa didn’t improve either, which only made you long more for Kanata. You told Towa you were tired from the gym, from work, that your head hurt, looking for any excuse to avoid having sex with her, over time she stopped asking and that made your life easier, but you knew she was growing irritated. Perhaps it was because you had plenitude with Kanata, and didn't hide anything when you were with her, as opposed to Towa, to whom to were always secretive about were you'd been, why you couldn't enjoy yourself with your girlfriend, despite being aware of loving her.

No one but you noticed, thought, she streamed as usual, this time her emotions didn’t shine through the screen.

~*~

“Happy birthday!” Everyone said in unison, some faster, some slower. Towa gave you a kiss.

It was your birthday. Towa insisted in throwing you a small party at her place, so you invited some of your friends while Towa invited her gemmates. Luna was sick and Coco said at last minute she wouldn’t make it, without elaborating. Only Watame and Kanata showed up.

The party was alright, bits of chat here and there, a few beers and cake. 

You found yourself in a guy group for a bit, and one of them asked something everyone wanted to know.

“Hey, Anon…” One of your coworkers whispered to you. “So, what’s like doing it with an idol?”

“Towa is so hot, she must be a beast in bed!”

You faked a cough and sneaked a quick glance at Kanata, who was talking with her gemmates.

Towa caught a glimpse of your muttered chat, so she ignored what her friends were saying and focused on listening your answer, oblivious to who you were talking about.

“Maybe not a beast…” You said. “But certainly….one I like.”

Towa almost exploded in joy in that moment. She felt funny all over. Kanata saw her joy and looked at you unconsciously, you smiled at her, and she returned it.

At some point you casually spoke to Kanata in view of everyone, but it was a completely casual chat about daily life and streaming, Towa saw you two and felt happy that her boyfriend and her friend were getting along.

“They both need some friends.” She thought innocently.

After some of the guests left, it had gotten really late. Watame waved everyone goodbye as one of your friends offered to see her home. Now it was just you, Towa and Kanata. 

Kanata was trying to get a cab, but none were nearby. It wasn’t until Towa intervened that your heart began losing it’s temper.

“Ah, you can stay in my room, Kanatan!”

Kanata jumped at the answer, giving it some thought, she agreed.

Kanata slept soundly on Towa’s bed, while Towa joined you in yours.

“Ah, I almost forgot to give you your gift, Anon!” Your head was dizzy from the alcohol, yet you could still feign a bit of excitement.

“Ta-dah!” Towa pulled out a carefully wrapped gift which you felt bad about tearing open, and inside was a plain white shirt, very good quality, thought, it fit you perfectly.

“Thanks, baby.” Towa awaited a bit of disappointment, but your expression didn’t harbor any.

“Hey, come on, I wanted a more unsatisfied face so I could pull something like, ‘Oh, but that’s not it!’ and do this!” Towa spun in place as she took off her clothes and let them fall to the floor, revealing a sexy pair of black lingerie.

“Take a good look anon, I picked it up for you~.”

You felt your eyes slowly close as Towa kept talking, trying to keep yourself awake out of respect. You felt her pulling your pants down and massaging your cock, but by that time you were fast asleep.

Towa got mad and left. She shook the shoulder of Kanata to wake her up and asked if she could help her set a new mattress.

Deep into the night, a huge thirst awakened you. Too much beer, too little water. You turned on your bedside lamp and almost screamed when you saw Kanata entering your bedroom.

She brought her finger to her mouth and made a “shh” gesture. You desisted from getting up as she came closer to you, wearing a pair of pajamas Towa had lent her.

“K-Kanatan, why are you here?” You whispered.

Kanata looked at you with an incredulous stare.

“To give you your birthday gift, dummy.”

Quickly, you put a pillow between the head of the bed and the wall so it wouldn’t creak. You reached for your lamp to turn off the lights, but Kanata let out a small “No” before you did.

“Eh?” You always had sex in the dark, you assumed Kanata was still shy about it, but this time she had something else in mind.

“I want us to… see each other.” Kanata blushed, and so did you.

Kanata took your penis out of your underpants, already fully erect, without wasting any time, she took you in her mouth, letting her sloppy tongue slob all over your head. She knew all your weak spots, and seeing her look up to you while doing it only turned you on more. Kanata too, took a sweet delight in seeing your expression shift depending on what she did, be it licking the tip, sucking on it, rubbing her tongue across your member, letting your penis rest across her face, covering one of her eyes, every little movement she made, you had to shut out a variety of sounds by clenching your teeth. It felt just like your first time together, except this time, it wasn’t a pair of idiots acting on impulses, it was two lovers expressing themselves with their bodies.

Kanata had been touching herself while blowing you, and gave you a good jerk before stopping. She took off the shirt Towa had given you and kissed your neck, while you ran your hands under your girlfriend's pajamas, caressing gently Kanata's small, beautiful breasts.

Kanata got on all fours before you and spread her pussy open with both of her hands. You let out one loud pant, which was followed by another quieter one, and so they decreased in volume. You savored the moment, rubbing your cock up and down her slit, seeing how it dripped onto the bedsheets glowing from the lamps light. You slowly began putting the head in.

“Ah…!” You let out a dry moan that you quickly shut.

“Eeeh~!” Kanata covered her mouth in a flash.

You both looked at each other and let out quiet laughs, Kanata bit the shirt she took off from you to shut out her moans. You gave her one thrust marveling yourself with the jiggle of her perky, firm ass, but also to see if the bed was loud, the pillow did it’s job, and so you began giving your love to Kanata.

You too tried to be as quiet as possible, it felt absolutely terrible to not be able to moan her name or hear the sweet little sounds she made when you reached her sensitive spots with your cock.

Kanata asked you softly to stop, and so she laid on her back, opening her legs wide apart and stretching her arms out to you. You took the invitation without any second thoughts.

Wet sounds escaped from both of your mouths, you had opted for shutting each other up by keeping your lips busy. Kanata’s tongue shamelessly reached for yours, as your wrestled her for a spot in her mouth, you both sucked on them, rubbed them together as you kept dicking her down, with quiet sounds of flesh slapping flesh echoing in the room. 

“I’m gonna cum, Kanatan…” You whispered into her ear, ready to pull out, but Kanata kept you in place with a leglock.

You were taken by surprise by her gesture, as she happily smiled to you, her eyes inviting you to shoot your load inside.

It became to much to bear, your most primal instincts had kicked in, and the sounds of your pelvis hitting Kanata’s behind became louder, you didn’t care if Towa woke up. You didn’t care about anything except giving the girl before you all of your love. Kanata bit your shoulders to shut out her cries and she dug her nails into you before squeezing you with her insides. Your free hand unconsciously reached for hers, and with intertwined fingers, they fell to the side. Soon enough as you reached your limit, Kanata reached hers, feeling your warm love juice spurt out of your cock inside her pussy. You hadn’t cum like this in ages, cumming inside a girl you love is something else. 

Kanata herself squeezed your hand so hard you felt she was going to break it, but she let up after a few seconds, and finally let go of your waist.

You took your cock out and fell to Kanata’s side, both of you exhausted, then suddenly alert, listening for a sign of Towa waking up. All you heard were her snores, which you knew well.

"Happy birthday, Anon." Said Kanata in between breaths.

With Kanata looking at you, her body sweat giving her a certain shine in the lamps glow, your cum pouring out on her womanhood, you told her how you felt.

“I love you, Kanatan.” Her eyes became watery, accompanied by a smile.

“I love you too.”

~*~

Kanata woke up extra early and also tried waking you up, who were fighting the headaches and dehydration caused by the combination of alcohol and sex.

You opened the windows to let out the smell of the room and took the sweaty bedsheets to the washing machine, you would say you puked on them. Kanata threw in also Towa’s pajamas and your clothes, disposing of the evidence. Then she went to Towa’s room, who was fast asleep still, and pretended to be asleep herself.

Towa woke up hungover as well. But instead of complaining she got dressed and left, not telling anyone where.

Kanata and you had breakfast and kissed you goodbye, as the sheets and clothes were washed and dried, you put them back on the bed since Towa hadn’t noticed them in the washing machine.

For a few days you didn’t see Towa, she was ignoring your text messages. By this point you felt you deserved it, but felt no guilt about it.

Someone however, didn’t stop talking to you.

Kanata invited you over to Coco’s apartment frequently, sometimes Coco saw you enter as she left, not asking questions, not looking at you and you would make love with Kanata in the room she shared with Coco.

You two had become addicted to each other’s touch, the smell, the sound of your names, no matter the time and place, you just had to see each other.

The first time she called you over, she tried sounding sexy and seductive, but the best she could manage to pump out was “I got a new pillow, want to try it out?” Before getting embarrassed over the phone, as you laughed heartily and she told you to shut up in a jokey tone.

You were seeing her at least three times a week, to keep up with your sexual appetite, you started taking zinc and drank lots of fresh pineapple juice, giving your cum a taste Kanata would come to love.

One day, as you were busy burying your dick inside her, someone opened the door without knocking.

It was Coco.

You were caught red handed and quickly lost your boner. Coco looked at you like if you were breathing waste. Kanata didn’t so as much as flinching.

“Oh, don’t worry, I’m just gonna pick up something and leave for the gym.” Said Coco is a forcefully disinterested tone.

“I-It’s not what you think.” You spurted out.

Coco snapped and gave you a death glare. “Oh?” She said. “Then what the fuck is it, if not what I see?” Kanata looked at you, annoyed that you set Coco off.

“I come back to an apartment that constantly stinks of sex even thought Kanatan and only…” Coco found herself struggling with her words. “And then I also find Kanata washing her clothes daily with wet stains all over, I go to my bed and I find hairs aren’t mine or hers…”

Coco began to tear up.

“I fucking hate you so much.” She said, glaring at you. Coco turned around and was ready to leave, Kanata slipped out from under you and hugged Coco from the back.

“Cocochi~.” She said Kanata. Coco didn’t protest or resist her touch, in fact, she became red faced herself.

“K-Kanatan!” Said Coco, as Kanata slowly started to undress her from behind, Coco squirmed at the feel of Kanata’s hands, sensually running across her body. Coco didn’t care that you watched, she didn’t even acknowledge you, as she was drowning in a pleasure lost so long ago for her.

Kanata brought Coco back to bed and made out with her, sucking her plentiful breasts. The fear of Coco passed, and made way for a newfound lust. Kanata stuck her butt out to you and gave you the same look she did when blowing you for your birthday.

~*~

Coco worked your tip while Kanata licked your shaft, giving Coco instructions on what you liked, she couldn’t care less about it, but she didn’t want to ruin the mood either. You grabbed Coco by the horns and shoved your dick all the way in, making her slobber over it from top to bottom. Kanata watched in delight, drooling a bit as she imagined you doing it to her.

You came down in Coco’s throat, she gargled it for a bit, before pulling away as the last bit of your jizz landed on her face, which Kanata licked clean.

Kanata swallowed you cum and looked you with delight, Coco couldn’t loose track of how she stared at you.

Next, Kanata rode you as Coco sat on your face, she liked trying to asphyxiate you more than she cared about you giving her a good cunnilingus. Kanata sucked on her breasts and she got off from that instead. Getting a hold of Kanata’s hips, you shot your load inside her and she rolled her eyes back in full view of Coco.

~*~

“C-Can’t we clean it first?” Said Coco, for the first time reluctant to eat Kanata out as your cum oozed out of her love hole.

“Please Cocochi, I want it now~.” She begged her. Coco swallowed up her scruples and shoved her tongue inside Kanata’s pussy, making her moan immediately. Coco was starting to get lost in the moment, finally getting to be with Kanata once more, to her, that was worth it, regardless of the means to.

Recovering from you last orgasm, you saw Coco’s butt before you, and without asking, you put it in.

“H-Hey!” Yelled Coco, as Kanata locked her head with her legs, shutting her up with her pussy.

You fucked Coco raw for a good while, her behind was becoming more and more relaxed as it went on, finally giving up and letting you have your way, still sensitive from your last climax.

Kanata let go of Coco, who had a bit of cum on her lip, Kanata slid down under her body and began kissing her. Seeing the opportunity, you took yourself out from Coco, dragged Kanata towards and placed your dick between both of her slits, rubbing it back and forth.

Kanata was suffocating under Coco’s breasts, she noticed and pushed you back so she could turn her over, once that was done, you began alternating between one and the other as they rubbed their clits together.

Coco saw Kanata’s face of ecstasy, but she felt if she was watching it through a glass window, feeling her drifting away with each time you thrust inside her. Coco felt her emotions flatten and her libido die while Kanata rejoiced on top of her, just as you shot your final load, partly inside of Kanata, and the rest on top of Coco’s belly, because -You said to yourself- I only like to cum inside my princess.

Kanata reached her orgasm, but Coco didn’t. Instead she felt lank and floaty. Kanata took notice of it, and gave her a kiss, which brought her back to reality.

Coco got up and saw Kanata kissing you, her expression of love and care that she once showed only to her almost brought her to tears, without either of you noticing, she quickly took her phone to snap a picture of Kanata’s face, but something got over her, and instead she took a picture of the whole scenario; You, holding Kanata, her arm is wrapped around your neck as her tongue assaults it, and both are very, very Happy. Too distracted to notice, Kanata and you paid no mind to Coco as she took the picture, both of you lost in a fit of lust and love like never before. Coco didn't notice one little detail in the picture that would come to haunt her for the rest of her days.

~*~ 

As you and Kanata walked down a park, with her holding dearly onto your arm, you shamelessly asked something that had been bothering you.

“Kanatan… about, that time…” Kanata didn’t flinch.

“You want to know why I invited Cocochi to join us?” She said, spot on. You gave your answer with your silence.

The two of you approached a pretty fountain.

“Well, I love Cocochi a lot.” The answer didn’t bother you, but Kanata wasn’t done.

“I’ve learned many things from you, Anon.” Said Kanata, blushing. “That you can love a person for wildly different reasons, that passion can make you commit mistakes.” Kanata’s words softened your heart, before receiving a guttural punch.

“But, one thing that I realized, one thing that changed my worldview, is that you can love more than one person at the same time, and it makes you confused, irrational, angry, guilty, even if everything you feel is real.” You felt as if someone had opened a locked chest from your mind and poured its contents right before your eyes. Kanata got closer to the fountain, unbothered, looking at the pretty pattern it formed with the water spurts. She turned to you with dreamy eyes and met your lost and confused stare, slowly coming to grips with reality.

Kanata buried herself in your arms, you slowly hugged her.

“But, you already knew that, since long ago too, didn’t you?” Kanata said while resting in your chest. 

At last, everything became clear, and the sins that you harbored for so long, letting them crawl under your skin had disappeared, instead you felt as if being gently washed by the flow of a river. 

It was over. The angel and devil raging inside of you became one, and you were whole once more.

Towa waited for someone to arrive in a bar, before an orange haired girl made her presence in a white suit.

“Ehh~. Cosplaying your husband again?” She mocked Coco.

“’Cosplaying’? He let me borrow it for the night, that’s all.” Replied Coco with a laugh.

They both ordered something to drink, Towa asked for vodka, Coco asked for whiskey.

Coco knew why Towa called her here, but she didn’t bring it up. Instead, she let her friend take the lead.

The silence was deafening. Coco drank a bit of her whiskey and began the conversation.

“So, what’s on your mind?” Towa visibly saddened at Coco’s words, finally letting out what she felt.

“It’s about Anon.” Coco already knew, but she averted her gaze and listened to Towa speak, who was becoming more and more honest as her drink went down.

“…and he just fell asleep on me! Do you know how I felt? I’ve tried my best to make him feel good but I always come up short” Towa began tearing up. “I even googled all this weird shit about how to please your boyfriend and such, but it’s not enough.” She sniffled. "I'm not that experienced, you know? I only ever did it once with someone, Anon's practically the only guy I've ever had a serious sexual relationship with. Most of these things are still new to me and..."

Coco remained silent, a knot of thorns forming in her throat, before remembering something. The picture she took.

Back then she didn’t know why she zoomed out of Kanata’s face, but now it was crystal clear, as she gave Towa a thousand yard stare.

Towa was still rambling when Coco downed all of her remaining whiskey in one go, slamming her glass on the bar table. Towa jumped at the gesture, and Coco turned to face her, looking straight in the eye, but quickly adverted her gaze.

“Do you wish to know the truth, Towa?”

Towa was surprised, intrigued about Coco’s vague question, but she nodded.

“Ok. I need you to text me when you get home. Trust me.” Coco didn’t want Towa to have a breakdown in a public place, so she told her she would explain everything after and only after she got home.

Coco paid for the drinks and left without saying anything else.

Towa, in turn, stared with disbelief at Coco's her empty glass of whiskey, finding herself alone in a crowded bar.

Back at your house, Kanata rested in your arms.

“So, Cocochi didn’t see things my way, now she’s not talking to me, but she hasn’t kicked me out. She just doesn’t look at me.” Said Kanata with a sad voice, you comforted her with kisses which made her giggle as she dug her face into your chest. 

“You can crash here if you want.” Kanata smiled.

Kanata felt a hand sliding down her back, stopping at her waist. She grabbed your wrist with her hand, slid it down her underwear herself.

Towa was finally home, thinking about what Coco told her, once in her room, she gathered her courage and sent Coco a text.

“I’m home.”

“Ok.” Replied Coco.

On her end, Coco fumbled with her fingers for a long time. Towa’s anxiety rose up with every passing second, which felt like hours.

Finally, she received a message after a full minute.

Coco began sobbing, saying ‘I’m sorry, Towa...’ repeatedly, not to Towa, but to herself, as she noticed her foot -with her distinct nail polish- could be seen in the image.

Towa didn’t shed a tear. Her eyes went null. The shock had been so much for her, she didn’t have any strength left to cry.
