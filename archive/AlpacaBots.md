#####[Vincent](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=gsVXfIVxHt9LLcB-oVtUdHDUMs-CH4g_oFc6xh17FnE)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion691#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavmu2n)


#####[Leon](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=VpHUqg-Wycv6aqSDWKFT3wXktsjw920Y23N70ISaoS0)
Some guy runs from the cops, pulls a knife on you and takes you hostage to get away. He's actually kind of a pussy and not the criminal mastermind you might think. 

#####[Fynn](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=o63Aw2GeerxtMCrr-6Ym7A_gG4_LAV_rW1FV_jZscY4)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion794#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavxu7w)
He was supposed to hide the fact that he's a wolf but he's probably gonna blurt it out immediately anyway so I'm advertising him openly as a wolf-boy. He'll hit you up in a bar and either challenge you to a drinking contest or eat you. Or both.

#####[Kanami](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=yPm4m1vgYo9YanPbrT7NGqzRnfoJdxf60uJRPPwfBP8)/[Kanehiko](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=DidlNV3BZSlTV8PiUwMf7mbg45VtkR-89UbjhjZqtjQ) Tavern cards: [Kanami](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/Kanemi/main)/[Kanehiko](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/Kanehiko/main)
Inspired by a short story I read on pixiv. You're exploring a Japanese forest when you stumble over an ancient fox statue. Turns out in ye olde days villagers would sacrifice people to the kitsune of the forest here. Kanami/Kanehiko is one such kitsune and thinks you are the newest sacrifice. But don't worry, you're not to be eaten - your task is to marry her/him and make babies.

#####[Yasmeen](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=l9tBDPo47a36IVJsG5HijWmG-Pzd6G-5dZkKPDOjpBU)/[Tavern card](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/Yasmeen)
A clumsy witch who got reverse-isekai'd into our world. She used to be the henchwoman of an evil warlord and wants to atone for her evil deeds.

#####[Merlot](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=Ct2MiNp2J7vjjbEf0d-OLFUgg59_rgMQKdOqeW5JWWw&stream_animation_chunk_size=0&stream_animation_chunk_delay=0)/[Tavern card](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/merlot-the-demon)
You play the role of a magical girl. Merlot is the demonic evil minion who you fight against every day. He doesn't see you so much as an enemy and more as a rival.


##Escados Universe
*These all share the same setting but tell the story from different perspectives. The basic gist is you are a princess/prince from a country called Naandria. Your country lost a war against the country of Escados and now you have been taken captive by the enemy royal family and forced to marry their second eldest son.*

#####[Prince Kyron](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=Ycm2YQhwqOV55O0WB9EC87-Xzc_AzjWUbgZ3gHJrNPU)/[Tavern card](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/prince-kyron)
The 1st son of the royal family. Chivalrous and heroic. He is currently trapped in a loveless marriage that was arranged by his parents.

#####[Prince Andriel II](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=Tp9MQNHZi1e0qqUCOE9isWuZBN4NRE2ywtoP1eFxzGM)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion590#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavmu2n)
The 2nd son of the royal family. Arrogant and sadistic. The guy you are forced to marry. Card starts out immediately with a non-con sex scene, CAI version has been edited to start pre-coitus because the filter wouldn't let him get a single word in otherwise. 

#####[Prince Laithan](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=G79urkS3Vae13AeWXoOxOP-y56h5sgKrTokCC5gFbbE)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion690#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavmu2n)
The 3rd son. Playful Casanova (with hidden depths?). Wants to seduce his brother's betrothed for shits and giggles.

#####[Prince Elio](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=lIwlm9lIHX_Uo1AjjX4j5WNVIyidfzf2_IEr4-Q-boQ)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion689#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavmu2n)
The 4th and youngest son of the royal family. Naive and kind. Isn't involved in his country's politics and just wants to get to know you.

#####[Princess Giselle](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=6ptVAokRu0wi1EPymvVA99Mu6GZxjN2_mD-WoPF-jcs)/[Tavern card](https://booru.plus/+pygmalion589#q=user:alpacalotta&c=azavmu2n)
The only daughter of the royal family and Andriel's twin. Haughty alpha bitch. Would probably have bullied you in school. Has a sick obsession with her brothers and badly needs a therapist.

#####[Father Colair](https://beta.character.ai/chat?char=8Ydq45RNmlBwvZLGlQU-Gy13vYCOddVDbx2z8L0fhko&stream_animation_chunk_size=0&stream_animation_chunk_delay=0)/[Tavern card](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/Alpacalotta/father-colair)
It's your wedding day! But before you become the wife (or husband?) of Andriel, the priest who is holding the ceremony wants to offer you a deal. He claims he can help you escape but he wants something in return.

#Old bots

Only including these for the sake of completion. They're old and shit attempts at making gimmicky bots but their gimmicks have long since stopped working and I'm not invested enough in them to keep updating them. Except Quincy, he's just a perfectly SFW bot.

**Quincy:** Big strong DILF from another dimension, has been reverse-isekai'd into our world.

**Mimi:** The idea was to make her turn into a cat every time she would "blush like a tomato".
