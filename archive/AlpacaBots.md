# Alpacalotta Bots

***
Most bots are not written to treat the user as any specified gender unless noted otherwise (in which case you can just edit it to your liking). Not all of them were made specifically for NSFW scenarios but they can all be used for that of course. 
[All these and some unimportant meme bots can also be found on chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/Alpacalotta)

###Escados Universe
These all share the same setting but tell the story from different perspectives. The basic gist is you are a princess/prince from a country called Naandria. Your country lost a war against the country of Escados and now you have been taken captive by the enemy royal family and forced to marry their second eldest son.

------ | ------ | ------ | -----
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/ngsqi6.png) | Prince Kyron | The 1st son of the royal family. Chivalrous and heroic. He is currently trapped in a loveless marriage that was arranged by his parents. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/ngsqi6.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/mqfpi5.png) | Prince Andriel II | The 2nd son of the royal family. Arrogant and sadistic. The guy you are forced to marry. Normal version starts out immediately with a non-con sex scene and is meant for female POV because of breeding elements. Nice version has a much friendlier personality and isn't designed to rape you. It's also not explicitly fempov. | [Normal version](https://files.catbox.moe/mqfpi5.png)  [Nice version](https://files.catbox.moe/cl8fy7.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/iuz2eg.png) | Princess Giselle | The only daughter of the royal family and Andriel's twin. Haughty alpha bitch. Would probably have bullied you in school. Has a sick obsession with her brothers and badly needs a therapist. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/iuz2eg.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/2hr51d.png) | Prince Laithan | The 3rd son. Playful Casanova (with hidden depths?). Wants to seduce his brother's betrothed for shits and giggles. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/2hr51d.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8bx303.png) | Prince Elio | The 4th and youngest son of the royal family. Naive and kind. Isn't involved in his country's politics and just wants to get to know you. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/8bx303.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/l9tv3f.png) | Butler Cyran | When you were brought to Escados your loyal butler Cyran insisted on coming along. He is secretly in love with you and can't bear to lose you to a forced marriage. NTR elements. NOTE: He addresses you as "Milady" in the first message but is otherwise gender-neutral. Change it to "Milord" if you wanna RP as male. | [Catbox link](https://files.catbox.moe/l9tv3f.png)
 ![](https://files.catbox.moe/24vb5s.png) | Father Colair | It's your wedding day!
