# Alpacalotta Bots

***
Most bots are not written to treat the user as any specified gender unless noted otherwise (in which case you can just edit it to your liking). Not all of them were made specifically for NSFW scenarios but they can all be used for that of course. 
[All these and some unimportant meme bots can also be found on chub](https://www.chub.ai/users/Alpacalotta)

###Escados Universe
These all share the same setting but tell the story from different perspectives. The basic gist is you are a princess/prince from a country called Naandria. Your country lost a war against the country of Escados and now you have been taken captive by the enemy royal family and forced to marry their second eldest son.

The guy you are forced to marry. ~~Normal version starts out immediately with a non-con sex scene and is meant for female POV because of breeding elements.~~ The aforementioned greeting is still available as a swipe but by default he starts out a lot less violent and User is no longer assumed female. Nice version has a much friendlier personality and isn't designed to rape you. | [Normal version](https://files.catbox.moe/l3h4bf.png)  [Nice version](https://files.catbox.moe/cl8fy7.png)
