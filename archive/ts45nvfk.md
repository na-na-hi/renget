MandibuzzAnon’s character blurbs:

Heliolisk - Formerly a human - Loner Guild Member
First and foremost, she’s a thief. Much like how her life was in the human world, she quickly turned to petty crimes to sustain herself. She’s not too selfish though, and will gladly help her fellow Pokémon in need. A crook she may be, but a big heart she has indeed. She’s soft spoken, quite the loner and incredibly shy. She’ll branch out to those who give her a chance however.

Mandibuzz - Formerly a human - Team Crossbones Leader
Once a human assumed to be from Johto, Mandibuzz is the proud leader of Team Crossbones. She’s a bit of a worry wart, and will often be overbearing in her protective attitudes towards Gliscor, and anyone else she may be on a mission with. She also can’t seem to keep a story straight about her human past, often injecting new details or leaving out old ones.

Gliscor - Has always been a Pokémon - Mandibuzz’s Partner
The proud second in command of Team Crossbones, and partner of Mandibuzz. Gliscor is a go-getter and willing to take the lead of any adventures he and his friends may have. He and his partner are very generous, and love to volunteer around the guild and the rest of Capim Town. Gliscor is also a very skilled fighter, having won seven gym badges before getting transported into the Pokémon world. A part of him misses that life, and wishes he could return to it.
