**Personal Overview**
Chiyoko Ao is a kunoichi of Shimogakure that served her village for two years as a Genin, eight as a ChÅ«nin and five as a Jonin. A veteran of the last Great Ninja War, she had taken to the philosophy of ninjas-as-warriors far more fervently than the usual for her homeland - disregarding the more commonly held beliefs in cautious neutrality through the Land of Frost. Her clan, the Ao, were once a bloodline of Samurai from the Land of Iron who were exiled for disobeying the land's Shogun over two centuries ago - since then her family adapted their long history of chakra control methods towards the shinobi world, though their preference towards their traditional weapon arts and skill in direct conflict never faded, solidifying a family role as bodyguards and security throughout their country. 

She was strong-headed and prideful, but she was also quite clever, cunning and even underhanded when pushed into a corner. She also possessed an unhealthy taste for various substances, including, but not limited to sake, tobacco and opiates - a habit she would never forgive herself for and hid from her friends in shame. Morally, she had attempted to devote herself to the codes of the Samurai and shinobi both - a paradoxical fusion only permitted by her lack of dedication, I don't think she ever truly believed in either and was looking for a purpose. In all, she never really discovered what she was living for outside the expectations placed upon her, but fearlessly gave her life to complete her mission and - perhaps more - protect her students.

**Ability Overview**
Chiyoko was a textbook example of a Taijutsu specialist shinobi. With an exceptional physical energy reserve and control she was capable of significant feats of speed, strength and durability, particularly in the confines of close combat, where her mastery of weapons - her clan's ancestral yari in particular - allowed her to manoeuvre and overpower rival combatants with an aggressive fighting style. Normally, she relied on her superior skill-at-arms to obtain an advantage - conserving her large chakra pool to better engage in protracted conflicts, which her Samurai-descended techniques were designed for - but in an event where such was insufficient she was capable of overloading her body's chakra network to extreme effect, injuring herself in return for short-lived bursts of superhuman athleticism.

In terms of Jutsu, Chiyoko possessed all fundamental and beginner techniques and had begun to branch into more advanced Yang and Lightning style Ninjutsu during her Jonin years. Her abilities with Genjutsu were considered deficient - a common trend among Samurai clans, who's disposition leaves them unsuited to deception - though she was capable of most fundamental illusory techniques taught in the academy. Overall, she chose to rely on Jutsu as little as possible, typically only augmenting her own martial prowess with streams of Lightning or bursts of physical power.

Strategically, Chiyoko possessed a mindset better suited to a true warrior than a shinobi - she was not deceptive or particularly creative, a factor that cost her in many engagements with more elusive foes. Despite this, she shined in planning, tactics, logistics and leadership, likely oweing to her academic Samurai-oriented upbringing. She was capable of maintaining composure in the worst situations and was willing to adapt to the situation - accepting failure quickly and considering better solutions in something I could only describe as a state of tactical zen.

**Proposed Engagement Strategies**
Avoidance in close conflict with Chiyoko was the first obvious consideration. Even for a Taijutsu expert, the prospect of engaging within the range of her yari carried a great deal of risk - while not averse to retreating, she was fully willing and capable of harming herself in order to better strike a superior opponent, making the risk of injury a serious consideration for even the greatest of warriors. Her abilities at range weren't much less impressive due to her expert use of kunai, shuriken and arrows, but these were notably outside her specialty and came in limited supply. Engagement at range wherever possible was recommended.

Her sole elemental nature of Lightning left a particular weakness towards Wind - without any Fire or Earth Style she possessed little defence against Wind-based attacks and such Ninjutsu were proven effective on multiple occasions. Despite this, her own lack of reliance on offensive Ninjutsu outside of charging her yari rendered many elemental defences essentially irrelevant - it was recommended that Ninjutsu specialists used their abilities to keep her at a distance with heavy offence.

She possessed little counter to more insidious, illusory or elusive tactics beyond her own speed, making Genjutsu a relatively safe option - though her strong will offered a strong barrier to mental attacks and so Illusory Arts were considered the go-to strategy. Traps, seals and other uses of the environment were of adequate effectiveness - Chiyoko was by no means unperceptive, but lacked any particular sensory abilities and was forced by her skillset to engage up-close - obvious traps were naturally ineffective, but subtler uses of the environment offered a strong advantage, particularly when coupled with rapid, consistent offensive to prevent her from analyzing her environment. This strategy would ultimately lead to her death by a thousand cuts - bleeding, poisoned, burned and suffering from multiple low-level Genjutsu applied in various ambushes across three whole days crippled her ability to fight, leaving her open for an assassin's kunai. It was my fault, I shouldn't have listened and I will never forgive myself for her death.
