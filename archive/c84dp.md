# Dare Prompt Fill
## Hailey
"Hi, mom. So you know how I got a boyfriend and you've been trying to contact me for the past two weeks but I never pick up?"
Hailey examines her nails.
"Yeah, so basically the whole family's response to that got me thinking. And that led to some realizations, so. Just wanted to let you know that I'm dropping out of school and cutting you off effective immediately. Don't contact me ever again."
Hailey hangs up, flings her phone at the wall with an incredible amount of force, and watches impassively as it breaks on impact. She looks around the circle and shrugs in the ensuing stunned silence. "Been wanting to do that for a while."
> Are you serious?
"No. I'll just get another phone."
> Why your mother?
"Because there's nothing that could possibly scare my father." ~~And he's much better at mind games than Hailey is.~~
### Context
Hailey's older siblings actually tried to escape the family in their own ways to varying degrees of success but were never able to manage a clean break. She's watched them run away and come crawling back several times, so she knows how it works. She hasn't tried doing it herself ever before, which is why her doing it for the first time would definitely scare her mother.
## Edie
"Hey, um," Edie lowers her voice to a whisper, "the school's going to call you but I just thought you should hear it from me first. Yeah, I brought my phone into the ward, I know it's not allowed, but -" She chokes back a sob with a shit-eating grin, "- I collapsed in gym and they ran some tests. I've got some sort of weird quirk-resistant blood disease, and they said - they said I've only got a year to live." She pauses, breathing quickly and audibly through her mouth to make it sound like she's crying quietly. "Can you come and take me home?"
She waits for a few seconds before backpedaling and soon has to leave the room for five minutes while her parents yell at her for lying to them.
