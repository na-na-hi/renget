#### Vector and Free Store
>*“Use vector as the default!”* —Alex Stepanov

*"This chapter and the next four describe the containers and algorithms part of the C++ standard library, traditionally called the STL. We describe the key facilities from the STL and some of their uses. In addition, we present the key design and programming techniques used to implement the STL and some low-level language features used for that. Among those are pointers, arrays, and free store. The focus of this chapter and the next two is the design and implementation of the most common and most useful STL container: vector."*
