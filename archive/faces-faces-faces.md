# Faces-Faces-Faces

[TOC2]

## Introduction

Just needed a place to store all the tags that work to change up your characters. And just other helpful stuff.

Base prompt: depends on the category
seed: 966082668
sampling: k_euler_a
steps, scale: 28, 11
add quality tags: no
res: portrait (normal)

!!! info Reminder
	Remember to mix and match! This is supposed to be a rentry to quickly show that a tag works, but it may be best to include other tags alongside it for more specific haircuts. For example, "blunt bangs" + "hair over one eye" makes something new and unique entirely!

	-> ![mix n match ex](https://files.catbox.moe/i3t3d7.png) <-

	The oddities sections are for outputs that aren't what the tag was for, but are still interesting enough to mention.

!!! note
	Moved all the files to catbox, so no more dead files!

#### Jitome & Friends

I've been told these tags work, but I couldn't get them to. I don't try to include any tags that are gacha, just things that work, but hey these get mentioned enough to drop here. Also, heart-shaped pupils works but is heavy gacha as well. +chibi helps

### 3d

3d is a really fun tag. It's stupid, funny, and weird. double weighting up 3d seems to be okay, adding "blender (medium)" makes it uglier, banning and biasing up the ban seems to marginally improve quality.

![media 3d 1](https://files.catbox.moe/ao9ujv.png)
My take on how many curly braces 3d should have? 0-1, past that you start getting weird 3d structures in the background, and the 3d degrades in quality.

## Img2Img Settings

A bunch of anecdotal reports about img2img.

>[To enhance better than the dedicated function], reduce strength to .2 - .4 and make sure noise is very low, like well below 0.05. Higher noise is only good for when you're giving the AI nothing but a really crude drawing to start with.

>If you're working from photos or previously gen'd images, use extremely low noise to preserve details of the original: ~0.04. Lower strength too, to taste. Continue to describe the subject with tags matching the source image.

>My experiences with img2img settings
>0.5 strength and less makes the output look almost exactly like the original
>0.6 for minor differences
>0.7 for large differences
>0.8 and higher makes the output unrecognizable from the original.
>Always set noise to 0.
>9 to 12 scale is ideal.

tl;dr:
shitty drawing, raise noise
good input img, zero noise
0.6 for minor differences
0.7 for large differences

## Quality Tags + Settings (NSFW)
