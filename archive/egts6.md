INTERMISSION ZONE 1
Tails makes his first playable appearance, walking in what looks to be an abandoned warehouse or some dilapidated workshop. The stage was devoid of any music, with only Tails's quiet sobbing to fill the silence. His movement was noticeably slower, and the only gameplay available was to sluggishly walk in a straight line towards whatever awaits me.

On the other side of the room was a horrible snorting noise, sounding like both a toddler coughing up phlegm and a rabid dog foaming at the mouth. I really did not want to see what was making this noise, but the game had no other options available for me but to continue my death march.

"Sonic.... please...."

Once I finished reading the dialogue box, moments after the camera moved to see Satanos, hunched over a metal desk and violently scraping his face back and forth across its surface, with rubber hose arms stretched out to hold the table in place, resembling one of those inflatable tube men you'd see outside the lot of a car dealership. 

The horrible noise became louder and louder, with coarse gibberish whispers in between each snort. Tails's sobbing became full-on weeping, horrified at what his friend was doing.

"this isn't you...."

"stop..."
 
Tails's expression in the dialogue box changed to one of teary-eyed anger, having grown the courage to stand up to his former friend.

"I've had enough. We all have. I don't know what's come over you.... but... but it needs to stop NOW."

Finally acknowledging the fox's presence, "Sonic" jerked around to face him, the entire upper half of his muzzle caked in white powder. His eyes were bright pink, and his pupils were rapidly darting in all directions, unable to focus on anything due to the amount of cocaine in his system.

"TAILS     TAILS I NEED TO SELL YOUR TELEVISION TAILS"

"I NEED THE CRACK MONEY TAILS" 

His entire body was spasming as if he were having a full-body seizure.

"Soni-"

"I SMELL  F E A R "

Before Tails could say anything, the frenzied satanos's eyes began to bulge out of their sockets, inflating like balloons. 

"FEARFEARFEARFEAR"

I figured that it would be a good idea to run, and so did Tails. With a panicked look on his face he started to build up momentum to try and escape; before he could make it out of the crack shed, suddenly my ears were punctured by a loud popping noise.

Satanos's eyes had popped open, and out of his now hollow crevices a tidal wave of black smog poured out in a jet stream, engulfing the fox.
