Orochi's tails writhe restlessly as she steals glances at Yui in her half-dressed state. The two are alone in the locker room, the rest of their classmates having headed to the cafeteria at the sound of the bell while they distracted each other with their usual bantering. Once the others had left tension started to build as their conversation slowly faded out. The reason for their awkwardness was twofold. This was the first time they had been alone together as her friend seemed to be deliberately avoiding such a situation. Today was also White Day, and a month earlier Orochi had received a box of chocolates from an anonymous admirer. It was left in her shoe locker without any letter and only a familiar ribbon used for the packaging gave a clue to who left them. They seemed homemade and were decorated to look like the squares on a DDR pad. There was no actual confirmation of who'd gifted them, but Yui's moodiness during Valentine's and her moodiness all but confirmed.

Well, Orochi was sick of it. She only waited this long because Yui had managed to worm her way out anytime she tried to confront her. If she tried to run away today Orochi was going to bite her and talk while she was immobilized. The lizard uses one of her tails to grab a box out of her bag as she approaches Yui.

O: "This is yours." She fixes Yui with a hard look, a silent warning to not run away. Yui fixes the lizard with her own glare as she frowns, daring Orochi to chase her.

Y: "You already gave me a present, Atsushi." Aside from White Day, it was also Yui's birthday. Orochi had casually handed over a supply of premium cat food and concert tickets for one of her favorite bands. That alone had her feeling overwhelmed without even counting the presents she received from the rest of 1-D. She half hoped that Orochi forgot about what else was happening today.

O: "It's not for your birthday. Hurry up and take it." Orochi grins. "Unless you're afraid of a little cake. Well, you too chicken?"

Threads snatch the box away from Orochi as Yui scowls. Her glare burns a hole through it as she mentally curses herself before opening the lid. Inside is a small cake with a white exterior, the top reading "We're a matcha made in heaven" in green. A horrible pun and presumably the flavor. Yui sucks a breath in through her gritted teeth. This was a great response, and that was the problem. She didn't know what to do.

Y: "The hell is this for?" Even if it was her closest friend, she needed to be certain. She needed to be more than certain. She needed it to be the only possibility.

O: Orochi moves closer and leans forward so that Yui is forced to look her in the eyes. Her nostrils flare. "It means I want more of your chocolate."

Y: "Your shitty jokes aren't a good way to show it. No girl wants that." She closes the lid and sets the cake to the side as she comes close enough to feel Orochi's breath tickle her lips, their foreheads pressed together.

O: "But you do, so I must be pretty lucky."

Y: "Lucky I like you enough to ignore them."

O: "Like? You really are a coward. Maybe I should leave." Orochi's eyes are hard and cold, but she doesn't move away. She'd beat a confession out if she had to.

Yui growls and pulls her head back as ribbons wrap around Orochi's neck to hold her in place. She slams into the lizard, knocking her back slightly but earning little more than a grunt. She definitely hurt herself more than she hurt Orochi, but it didn't compare to how upset the idea of being left made her.

Orochi returns the favor, using one of her tails to pull Yui in and deliver a headbutt of her own. Yui is sent to the ground, rubbing her forehead and wincing in pain as she glares at her friend. Orochi looks at her expectantly as she waits to either continue their fight or their conversation.

Y: "Fuck! Your head's too damn hard!"

O: Orochi glowers and her tails arrange themselves defensively as Yui uses her threads to pull herself up and send her body flying forward. "Not as hard as yours or we'd be eating cake already!"

Just before they collide, threads erupt from Yui to bind the tails together, allowing her fist to connect with Orochi's jaw as they're sent tumbling. It stings, but Orochi was still the stronger of the two of them and she puts that strength to use when Yui tries to back off. Her claws dig into Yui's ankle as she yanks her back to the ground where they enter a grapple. None of their months-long training and refinement of their abilities was to be seen here. There were no clever tricks or elegant outmaneuvering to be found as they punched and kicked and pulled and pushed each other around. It was the raw expression of their overwhelming passion and unbending wills, each blow communicating their desires in a language they both understood well.

Orochi's frustration had long boiled over and she was making Yui feel every ounce of it. She hated seeing her act so cagey and attempting to put distance between them. Now, Yui was being as brash as ever. She felt closer than ever. It was intoxicating and she wanted more of it.

Even as Yui tugs on Orochi's ponytail knees her ribs, she feels ecstatic. They didn't have to fight. It would have been so much easier to just leave. But here Orochi was here, trying to beat sense into her. This was proof. Every mark Orochi left was undeniable evidence of her commitment. This fight meant more to her than any of the gifts she'd be given.

Yui grunts as her back is slammed into a locker. Orochi looms overhead, panting as she holds Yui down. They're both dripping with sweat, but unsurprisingly only Yui has any meaningful bruises or cuts. As much as they both wanted to continue indulging themselves in each other, Orochi still wanted to hear words they'd started fighting over.

O: "You ready to say it?" There's a tremor of excitement in Orochi's voice as she leans in expectantly.

Yui's mouth parts but no sound leaves it. Instead, its spreads into a grin as she pulls Orochi close and rolls on top of her before their lips lock. There's nothing gentle or delicate about it. It's a messy, ravenous affair of lip sucking, teeth bumping, and tongue massaging. If she'd ever had any fear of being poisoned then it wasn't apparent as their saliva mixed. Orochi struggles to pull away even as part of her nags that she should worry. Whether it was the threads she was tangled in or her burning desire, she allows herself to enjoy the kiss until they have to come up for air.

Y: "I'm sew in love with you." The words come between panting, and once they're out Yui collapses against Orochi, settling into her shoulder.  

O: Orochi chuckles while carefully stroking Yui's head. "Idiot. Is that what took you so long?"

Y: "Why? Gonna turn me down now?"

O: "No. You're an idiot I love." She squeezes Yui and kisses the top of her head. Yui responds by planting one on Orochi's collar and snuggles against her. "Hmpp. Don't leave me tied up if you're going to make me carry you."

The sounds of footsteps alert the lovers and Yui does her best to quickly clear her threads. It hadn't been an important factor during their spat, but now Orochi was all too aware of their current state of dress. They hadn't completely covered they were even less so after going at each other. Anyone who stumbled upon the pair might get an idea about what they were doing that wouldn;t be entirely wrong.

"Orochi? Yui? Lunch is almost over!"
