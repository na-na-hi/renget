The ticking of the clock on the wall cuts through the silence as you shift in your seat. You can see a view of the street outside through the large windows behind Mr. Aldrich, late-afternoon sunlight shining in to light the cozy, humble office. The man himself sits behind his desk, chin resting on his folded hands as he looks from Eleazar to you and back again. “I realize that this is sudden, but I’m sure you can understand why I wished to speak to you in person.”

“Yes.” Eleazar sits beside you in the other chair in front of Aldrich’s desk, his hand stretching over the short span between you to rest on your forearm. The magus’ flaring, amber eye-lights glance toward you as well. “Truth be told, I had hoped to return to Eyghlewhyn sometime in the future. There are matters that I must attend to there.” His grip tightens on your wrist for just a moment. “However, I did not expect it to be so soon.” 

You stay quiet, considering what Aldrich just finished telling you. A lot of it went over your head, but the main gist seemed to be that he was offering to send Eleazar back to Eyghlewhyn; which was, apparently, easier said than done, but Aldrich had apparently made enough connections on the Other Side to make it happen. Part of you is elated for Eleazar—he gets to go home, after all—but a secret, selfish part of you doesn’t want him to leave you. 

“The offer’s open, and can be taken any time. But, if you don’t mind me saying it, I’d honestly prefer it be sooner rather than later. Especially because I was hoping you could help to take care of a certain matter for me.” 

“Oh?” Eleazar’s skeletal face is unreadable, but you’ve grown to know him well enough over the week you’ve spent together to read the flickering in his eye-lights. “And what matter would that be?” 

Aldrich heaves out a gusty sigh, and for a moment the man’s age shows in the lines on his face. Then it passes, and he looks to Eleazar with the eyes of a young, fervent activist. “The fact that you appeared at Mellycgh’s auction suggests that its influence extends even into Eyghlewhyn. There’ve already been rumors and rumblings in certain circles. Your appearance on the slave market has created a demand that it’s all-too-willing to fill.”

Does he mean more magi being sold as slaves?

“Exactly, my young friend.” Aldrich gives you a grave nod, and turns his gaze back to Eleazar. “You’ve experienced what Mellycgh does to its ‘merchandise’, you and Anon both. And I can assure you, the other magi Mellycgh gets its hands on won’t be lucky enough to have someone like Anon ready to buy them.”
 
“The Grand Magus would never allow it.”

“Not allow, perhaps, but not condemn either. At least, not without a push from one of his children who’s experienced it for himself.” The old man leans back in his chair, tapping an uneven, bitten fingernail on the desk. Aldrich is watching Eleazar’s face carefully, as though trying to read the magus’ skeletal expression. “Surely you realize what it would mean if Mellycgh could sell off your brothers at its whim. Put more magi on the slave market.”

“And surely you realize what it would mean for Eyghlewhyn to break its neutrality.” Your magus’ voice is flat, inflectionless, kind of like it was when you first met him. “The Grand Magus has long been an observer in the world, offering his wisdom, but never his power. And my brothers have long followed his example.” Aldrich probably doesn’t catch it, but you do. The slight flicker of the amber lights in his eye sockets. The way his jaw tenses, and his shoulders rise up just the tiniest bit. Something’s bothering him. 

You speak up. You don’t know anything about what’s happening in Eyghlewhyn, but you do know it’s not fair to put all that responsibility on Eleazar alone.

“I would think it’s a simple request after all that the New Abolitionists have done.”

Really? Is that what all this has been about? You find yourself glaring at the older man. Has all this—buying up Eleazar and giving you a week to care for him and grow close with him—just been so that he could have another agent? An asset? A puppet to do what he wants in Egh- Elly- wherever-the-fuck?

“Anon, peace.” Eleazar’s hand rubs the back of yours. The soothing spell tingles over your skin and settles into the bones underneath, and you let out a soft, slow breath through your gritted teeth. 

Aldrich is looking at you, his expression considering. “…I must apologize. You’re a good person, Anon; I could see as much back at the auction. I appreciate that you’ve grown close with Eleazar—“ His eyes dart down to where Eleazar’s hand still rests on top of yours, and you can feel your cheeks grow hot with a blush. “—and appreciate that you’ve taken care of him for this week. You’ve opened your home to him, taught him about this side, and made sure that he’s been able to thrive and flourish.” He bows his head. “I’m sorry for forgetting the gratitude I should be giving you.” 

You sink back into your chair and rub at the back of your head. It’s alright, you guess. After all, you wouldn’t have even met Eleazar if it wasn’t for him. So you guess you should be grateful to Aldrich, too. And hey, you should probably cut him that $60,000 donation check you promised him to go towards buying Eleazar.

Aldrich smiles, white teeth shining between his lips, and offers you his hand. “Keep the money, anon. you’ve done a lot for our cause already.” When you shake his hand his grip grows firm around yours, and the older man leans in to look you right in your eyes. “I don’t want to use Eleazar like you said, but… just think about it, alright? Think about what would happen if more like him got put on the slave market.” You gulp, thinking about it for a moment, and then nod.

A gusty sigh from your magus draws Aldrich’s and your attention back to him. Eleazar stands, stretching for a moment—he’s had to really squeeze tight into himself to fit into his chair—and glances from Aldrich to you. “…Can you arrange it for tomorrow morning? ‘Twould fit into your schedule, would it not, Anon?”

“Anon?” Aldrich looks confused for a moment, then his eyes widen. “You plan on bringing him along with you?”

“Yes.” Eleazar answers as though it should be obvious. He leans over the desk, looking right into Aldrich’s eyes the way the older man looked into yours. “And yes, I realize what that means. I will ensure Anon’s safety and comfort, as he has ensured mine.” 

Aldrich’s expression shifts; it looks like he wants to say something, but the weight of Eleazar’s gaze is keeping him silent. You look back and forth between them, trying to parse the silent conversation they’re having, but are left completely in the dark. Finally, Aldrich nods with a grunt. “I’ll arrange it.”

“Good. In return, I can see what I can do about the matter you brought up.” Eleazar’s skeletal grin is wide as he shakes Aldrich’s hand as well.

Aldrich can only laugh softly. “I see now why you had your former position in Eyghlewhyn.” The older man gives you a wink with a shining, bright eye. “Watch out for this one, Anon, he’s dangerous.”

You laugh along with Eleazar and Aldrich, but can’t help but feel like you’re missing out on some part of the joke. 

-----

Eleazar teleports the two of you home after you say your goodbyes to Aldrich, and you immediately strip out of your clothes and plop onto the couch with a gusty sigh. Well, that went well. You laugh, and then trail off into a sigh. Aldrich’s words still echo in your mind, sending your thoughts into a swirling maelstrom, and not even Eleazar slowly stripping out of his own clothes down to his jockstrap is enough to distract you from them. You ask your magus if it’s really okay for you to tag along to Eyghlewhyn with him; from what Aldrich was saying, it sounded like it would be a one-way trip. 

“It very well may be, at least through the channels that he is planning to use.” Eleazar drops onto the couch next to you, and the old thing protests with a groan at his added weight. He wraps an arm around you and pulls you against his chest; you settle against him eagerly, and let the rich scent of Eleazar’s body wash over you to drown out your thoughts for a moment. “But returning back to this side from Eyghlewhyn is a mere trifle for one of my talents.” Your magus chuckles and one of his eye-lights winks out for a second. 

So he really would want to come back?

“Of course. I will go wherever you wish me to, Anon. I will go wherever you are.” He lifts your hand, which had settled on his chest to brush through the whispy line of fur down between his firm pectorals, up to press the tip of his snout to your knuckles. “You are my master, my lover, and my husband. Wherever you go, there I shall go too.” 

You blush under his affections, and stammer out that you would’ve thought he’d want to return home to pick his life back up, since he’s getting the chance.

“Anon, you are my home.” Now his snout pushes down to press against your temple and nuzzle against your cheek. “Never before have I felt the way I do around you. This warmth is something I’ve never shared with any of my brothers. Not even the Grand Magus. I love you, Anon.”

Your burning cheeks pull up into a wide smile, and you murmur that you love him, too.  

“If you hadn’t been the one who became my master, I know not what would’ve become of me.” You can feel the humid puff of his breath against the side of your face as he sighs. “Every day, I am thankful that I have you, Anon. But if what Aldrich says is true, and more of my brothers may be sent into captivity the way I was…” 

You let out a soft sigh of your own, and crane your head to press a kiss to the magus’ jaw. You had a feeling that had gotten under his skin more than he let on to Aldrich.

“Mm.” His embrace tightens, almost like he’s clutching onto you. “The thought of another proud magus of Eyghlewhyn being put through that humiliation, brought low and turned into a product for Mellycgh’s profit turns my stomach. I truly believe the Grand Magus would never allow it, but…” 

Would the Grand Magus turn a blind eye if it happened?

“No, not him. Never him.” Eleazar’s voice is firm, assured. “…However, I’ve an idea of the contacts that Mellycgh may use to his advantage to sway Eyghlewhyn. Magi who may lend an ear to him to suit their own ends. Brothers of mine who have used my absence to grow closer to the Grand Magus.”

The ones who betrayed him?

“Yes.” Your magus’ voice darkens as his eye-lights flare.

You go back to stroking through his chest-tuft to calm him, and he rumbles and murmurs in appreciation at the distraction from the thoughts that must surely be racing through his own mind. From the sound of it, he was really close to the Grand Magus.

“I was his apprentice. Next in line to take up his mantle when his time to return to the Source comes.” His voice grows wistful as the lights in his eye sockets dim. “He cared for me as he did all the polyps who grew into my brethren, but even in my youth my talents were exceptional—I do not mean it as a boast, but a mere statement of fact. The Grand Magus could sense my potential, and hand-picked me himself when the time came for us to enter into our apprenticeships. I was able to prove myself to him, to all of Eyghlewhyn, and earned every single one of my titles and distinguishments. But…” He lowers his gaze, and his voice drops into a murmur. “None of those mattered to me as much as the pride I was able to give him in my services. I suppose I took my position for granted, and did not realize the jealousy it caused in some of my brothers.”

You tentatively ask what exactly happened.

“They drew me into a position where I had no choice but to disgrace myself. To shame myself in the eyes of all my brothers, and in the Grand Magus’ eyes especially.” He doesn’t seem to want to talk about what exactly that means, and you choose not to pry further. “They then allowed me the ‘mercy’ of giving myself to Mellycgh, to remove myself and my disgrace from amongst them. Long had I lived in comfort in Eyghlewhyn, assured of my position and power—perhaps a bit too assured. But to have it all stripped from me, to become a tool, a thing to be bought and sold and used at the whim of whoever would purchase me…”

That’s enough, you say. You caress the side of his bony snout, drawing his gaze to meet yours. That doesn’t matter anymore, because he’s not a slave anymore. He’s Eleazar, your magus. Your husband. And if there’s anything he needs to settle in Eyghlewhyn, then you’d be happy to help him. You did promise Aldrich, after all. You offer him a gentle grin, and press a kiss to the tip of his snout.  

“Master…” His eye-lights flicker out, and the magus lets out a soft groan. He turns you around in his arms, getting you to straddle his hips as you face him. “I truly don’t deserve a lover as wonderful as you.”

It’s not about deserving. It’s about you being deep in love with your adorable, sexy magus. You kiss his snout again and rock your hips against his, grinding the bulge in your underwear against the one in his jock. It’s about you wanting to make him happy. To make him feel loved and cared for. That’s what it means to be married, after all. Even if you aren’t exactly official.

“Mm… the magus’ low, rumbling croons as he squirms under your ministrations set your pulse racing and your blood pumping straight to your crotch. “Not yet, perhaps…” 

Wait, what?

The magus only offers you a wide grin and a wink. “’Tis a surprise. One you shall have to wait for our arrival in Eyghlewhyn to receive.” 

Maybe. Or maybe you could order him as his master to tell you right now. You give him a grin that matches his own, your tone playful and loving. Your hands caress his neck, down his chest, and under his arms as Eleazar’s lifts them to rest behind his head. His scent—his musk—grows stronger, more pungent, and makes your head swim as you breathe it in eagerly.

“And if I refuse?” He rocks his hips up against yours in return, and you hiss as his heavy, pendulous ballsack rubs the erection you’ve sprung through their respective cloth prisons. “What shall Master do with his disobedient servant? How will you punish me?” Eleazar’s voice is playful, too; playful, lusty, and eager.

You have a few ideas, you tell him, and then draw your magus into a slow, deep, passionate kiss.

-----

Your lovemaking lasts long into the night, the two of exploring and worshipping each others’ bodies like it’s your first time together. You huff the musk from Eleazar’s armpits while his large, clawed hands grasp and knead your ass, and your tongue traces every ridge and rise of his musculature as you work your way down between his legs. You tongue his slit, delving into the tight, musky passage and drawing his erection out, and then suckle on the firm orbs in his sweaty, leathery ballsack. Then he blows you, his tongue caressing your own cock and balls as his throat engulfs your shaft with every eager bob. 

Then you move to the bed, naked and unashamed. You eat Eleazar’s ass like a man starved, exploring his cleft and pucker and back passage in turn with your eager, wriggling tongue. Listening to your magus moan and whimper and call out ‘Master’ and ‘Anon’ in bliss. As you pump his erection and tongue-fuck his hole, you ask him if the Grand Magus ever made him feel like this. 

And as you move up behind him, sinking balls-deep into your lover, Eleazar tells you all about the ‘services’ he gave the Grand Magus during his apprenticeship. How he learned from the older magus to use his tongue to pleasure another; to pleasure his master. He groans and croons about eating the Grand Magus’ slit and ass, and eagerly lapping up the cum the older magus produced. Then Eleazar sighs about how the Grand Magus swallowed down his own first orgasm, as he does for all the adolescent magi. How it had been planned for him to take his master’s slit, push his own cock into it and cum inside of it during the ritual to pass on the title of Grand Magus.

That sounds hot, you tell him as your fingers tease the base of his cock and rub over his moist slit-lips. Really hot. Is it possible for you two to do something like that? 

“I want it, Anon. I want you take my slit, claim it, mark the font of my essence as your own. When the time is right, of course.”

And when will that be?

Eleazar just looks over his shoulder to you, winking. “Perhaps sooner than you think.” 

You then turn your focus to each other, your hand grasping and pumping Eleazar’s cock while his inner walls squeeze and milk your eagerly-thrusting shaft. You press a kiss to the nape of his neck, and the magus’ breath hitches as he whines. You go harder. Faster. Deeper. Finally cumming together and collapsing into each others’ arms. A few more kisses and softly-murmured ‘I love you’s lull the both of you into deep, restful, dreamless sleep.

The morning comes before you know it; and with it, the phone call from Aldrich. He calls during breakfast—because that’s always when phone calls come in on the weekend, of course—to tell you that arrangements have been made, and that you and Eleazar are to be welcomed in Eyghlewhyn whenever you’re ready to depart. You thank Aldrich, and are ready to say your goodbyes to the older man when he says one last thing. 

“I mean it, Anon. Be careful.” 

You tell him you will and hang up, but are drawn into the whirlwind of getting ready before you can really let Aldrich’s words sink in too far. You shower with Eleazar, get dressed—Eleazar insists on wearing only his loincloth and coat, and you have to shrug; it’s not like you know what the standards of decency in Eyghlewhyn are, anyway—and are finally ready to depart. 

“This is it.” Eleazar shifts from foot to foot, his hand grasping yours tightly. You ask if he’s nervous, and his gaze shifts away from yours. “In truth, I am. At least, a little. I left in disgrace, after all, and so know not what kind of reception we shall receive.

You smile, and stretch up to kiss his jaw. It’ll be alright.

“Mm.” Finally, the magus lets out a long sigh, and nods to you. “Well, wasting time with worrying will not get us there and back any faster. Let us go.” His eye-lights flare, and the world shifts and melts around you as his shining magic dances through the air. You have to close your eyes tight to stop the sight from making your head hurt; you miss the distraction of staring into Eleazar’s eyes while you’re being teleported. Is he not doing so now because you’re going somewhere that only he has been? How exactly does that work?

A rush of air around the two of you blows those thoughts away, and you stumble against Eleazar as the two of you ‘land’.

You hear a deep, rumbling chuckle in your ear, and feel your magus’ bony snout pressing against your cheek. “Open your eyes.” 

You do so, and can’t stop yourself from gasping at the sight spreading out before you. You’re on a large balcony of dark stone, overlooking a vast courtyard. Long pools of shimmering water reflect the starry sky above like mirrors, surrounded by exotic plants in shapes you’ve never seen before. All around, spires of the same dark stone jut into the sky, pointing at the shifting colors of the aurora high above. And in front of you, rising up from the other end of the courtyard higher than even the tallest spire, is a giant tower; lights shine in the many windows and from the balconies dotting its monolithic shaft, and you can see cloaked figures wandering to and fro along the parapets surrounding you. 

Again, Eleazar quietly laughs at your reaction to the breathtaking view. “Welcome to Eyghlewhyn, Master Anon.”
