##### `Little Spoon`
>you and waifur resting together after a long days work.
>you had personally been anxious and worried about so many things throughout the day. But in the warm and loving embrace of waifur, all of that negativity means nothing.
>hearing her slow rhythmic breathing, feeling the steady beating of her heart, it's enough to make all your worries melt away.
>perhaps in the morning, you'll have to get back to the endless grind. But for now, you intend to savor every feeling of peace and comfort you both share.
>who would've thought being the 'little spoon' in this relationship could be so amazing.
