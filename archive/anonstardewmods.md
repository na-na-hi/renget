->[\[Back to the top\]](https://rentry.org/anonstardewmods#top)->
>Cute and Funny Scarecrows (Alternative Textures)
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/9tktwx.png)
For use with the Alternative Textures mod (also included). Simply buy the Paint Bucket item from Robin and click on any individual scarecrow (only works on the default one and maybe the deluxe one?) in order to pick a sprite for it.
https://files.catbox.moe/beek85.zip
>(CP) NPC Adventures - Vincent
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/d7wu8e.png)
"Here's the Vincent NPC Adventures mod, hope his +1 speed and +100 max stamina buffs prove to be useful. If there's any issues report back and don't forget to protect the potato."
https://files.catbox.moe/gjuqjb.zip
>(CP) Anon's dialogue edits
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/5621vm.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/1t1ggy.7z - For SVE. Edited out Morgan's retarded pronoun AIDS and removed almost all of Sophia's annoying stuttering + "silly" nickname.
https://files.catbox.moe/aw0wlf.7z - For Ridgeside. Edited out the troon shit.
>Leo to Kuruminha mod **(Updated)** 221224
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/q2u1qm.png)
Update adds missing kiss and flower dance sprites and fixes her loli version's breathing animation. Turns Leo into Kuruminha. Mod has adult and loli version (change with Generic Mod Config, adult by default), dialogue is pretty much the same but with changed name and pronoun. Report back if there's any missed dialogue changes. Some extra portraits are included in case anyone wants to make her a standalone NPC.
https://files.catbox.moe/2o1rsw.zip
>Adopt Kuruminha
![kuruminha](https://files.catbox.moe/qbtcot.png)
Allows you to 'adopt' Kuruminha (turning her into a roommate but with wife dialogue) by gifting an item called Second Key, which you can buy from Pierre once you reach 10 hearts with her. Only includes new marriage dialogue, Leo's old dialogue, events and schedule is unmodified so things may clash a little.
https://files.catbox.moe/kg8n3x.zip
>Beebz mod
![beebz](https://files.catbox.moe/l0rgmp.PNG)
"there's 5 events and some hidden content. enjoy marrying the rude brat. merry christmas."

>Morgan Marriage Mod **(Updated)** 230719
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/i2q5s5.png)
>Featuring 4 new Heart Events at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hearts showing more of Jas and Morgan's friendship... and the farmer is included, of course. Unlocking them requires both girls to be at the specific heart level + having seen Morgan's regular Heart Event for that level. Also available if you're already married to Morgan.
>An extra post-marriage event available after unlocking the Shop.
>As a reminder, you'll now receive a letter from Lewis once the NPC Adventures events are available.
>SVE version only: Morgan now finally goes out to skip rope with Jas like in the non-SVE version, plus she now visits the Night Market on the first day.
>Non-SVE version only: Removed the extra basement from the Wizard Tower (the one imported from SVE), now Morgan's regular 6 Heart Event takes place in her room.

>Regular version

https://files.catbox.moe/lal5q2.zip


>Anthro Morgan **(Updated)** 230209
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/3zvpjt.png)
Now includes hybrid kids. Latest update added some missing sprites.
https://files.catbox.moe/3v935c.zip
>>Anthro Morgan extra stuff
- Allows for the main Morgan mod to add special dialogue and stuff in the future. By itself this mod doesn't really do much.
https://files.catbox.moe/38u7pd.zip

>MilkTheVillagers
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/5621vm.png)
"I modded MilkTheVillagers, it now has no restrictions and Jas has custom dialogue. I suck at writing so, prepare to suffer."

>Ashley and Spooky mod  **(Updated)** 230120
![BOO](https://files.catbox.moe/cqzr1p.png)
A small bugfix. "Made an update for the Ashley and Spooky mod, it adds a few outfits, three heart events, a few interactions with the Beebz mod and a sauna. Once you unlock the sauna Ashley, Spooky, Recette, Tear and Madotsuki will hang out in it on wednesdays". Jas now included.
https://files.catbox.moe/qmygik.7z
>Anon's Spooky booba portraits and sprites 
![BOOba](https://files.catbox.moe/rjh4oe.PNG)
You need the base Ashley and Spooky mod.
https://files.catbox.moe/hmvtc7.7z

![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/ogf5gv.png)

https://files.catbox.moe/o7zh36.7z

![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/gyb7qj.png)
https://files.catbox.moe/54zzmn.7z
>Decorative Saria & Ruto
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/q8wldh.png)
Includes multiple versions with different effects, read the text file with info on them and pick one depending on whether you're using custom farms and/or SVE or not. The main version (if you're not using either) has a short event in their favorite areas, making the girls appear on the farm right after.
https://files.catbox.moe/2l2f2h.zip
>(CP) Jas marriage mod **(Updated)** 220911
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/w7qffa.png)
The only girl worth marrying.
- This update improves Jas's patio and removes the Custom Spouse Patio Mod so it won't conflict with Morgan's update. I copy pasted in a bunch of other minor random stuff to make this a little more worth it. I'll leave it all to you to figure out what. Also fixes a major bug regarding dialogue, possibly adding a load of new dialogue in the process.

>How to enable nsfw content:
"Simply get the Generic Menu Config mod and enable the "debug" option in the mod's submenu, just keep in mind that the lewd scenes are mostly separated from the rest of the mod for now because they're a work in progress and as such they have no real triggers yet, causing them to activate automatically and out of order whenever you enter specific areas. The SFW part of the mod is completely functional otherwise."
https://files.catbox.moe/h2250n.zip

https://files.catbox.moe/bsltlj.zip
>Expanded daughterwife patios **(Updated)** 220913
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/viyqoz.png)
 Removed the Patio data for Jas, Morgan and Constanze since they all have their own now, eliminating the need for the old version of Custom Spouse Patios completely. Use CSP Redux from now if you're using Free Love.

>Improved Trinnie **(Updated)** 230223
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/c5svzh.jpg)
"This is a working version of the Improved Trinnie edit I made long ago. I suggest you add both The trinnie mod and this improved edit to change her lines and it be like before, aimed to the farmer. In the future if Ridgeside get an update, do not update it to keep Trinnie files working, unless is a very big update. Then I might do an update as well."

>(CP)Constanze npc **(Updated)** 220913
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/0pf0yg.png)
Removed support for Custom Spouse Patio, so delete the [CSP] Constanze Custom Patio folder if you have it (use Custom Spouse Patio Redux to move her patio if needed). Now includes a Generic Mod Config toggle that disables her house. I have no idea what happens if she tries to enter or exit her house like this, so be careful with it.

>The Woman in a Painting (npc)
![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/vub3zv.PNG)
"There is an invisible door in the Town Hall. Beyond the door, several works are left covered with cloth. In such a quiet warehouse, you come face to face with a new person. Will you be able to uncover the truth about the woman in the painting and set her free? Unravel the past and secrets entangled in paintings, and hold an exhibition."
Same person who created Blanche and Dr.Schnabel.
