 -> *{It's not a name (unlike how Sun Wukong / 孫悟空 is the actual name of the Monkey King / 猴王 / Hou Wang), it's a literal title and warrants being translated + spoken in English as one. Yu = Jade, Huang = Emperor. You sound retarded and psudeointellectual if you refuse to translate, unless you want to speak in full Chinese while discussing him, which I know you ~~won't~~ can't, 鬼佬人渣. 你都不明白我是怎么侮辱你的, 是吗? ~~>inb4 你需要一个翻译, 就像你是绿色的戴绿帽子一样 .~~ The Jade Emperor is otherwise nameless, as it's given that the personal name of any given Emperor is exclusively known to the court in question and out of the knowledge of ~~the peasants, commoners and plebs / mortals~~ those whose affairs it does not pertain to - the same such rule likewise applies to the Yellow Emperor, Flame Emperors or any other irl historic Chinese Emperors you may have heard of}* <-
 -> *{And despite all that, if we're just going with his name said in Chinese, it should be Huang Yu. You can't not-translate it, but still apply English grammatical standards to it}* <-
 -> *{Overall; very, very shoddily handled}* <-

 -> *~~{And that's not even mentioning how completely out of his league the Pearl Dragon and 'Phoenixes' he uses are - one is a minor water creature that even Ao Kuang would accidentally step on like a bug, ther other is a Greek mythological beast that is completely different from the Chinese counterpart of the Feng Huang. Shit's like watching the Queen of England order a off-brand Big Mac with the scraggliest mangiest looking Ingurlish 'Lion' by her side - the realest Jade nigga would be at least have Qing Long and Zhu Que at his side for someone of his magnitude. Oh and it's not a case of 'being humble' either - it would be seen as an affront to the Heavenly Court for him to be associating with such pleb-tier beasts}~~* <-
