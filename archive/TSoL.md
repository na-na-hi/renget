The Scent of Lavender

I was traveling around Hokkaido in late June when I saw them - fields of lavender as far as the eye could see. It was the height of the lavender season, and I had come specifically to take photos. Pulling out my Nikon camera, I set up by the side of the road and began shooting pictures of a particularly vibrant crop of purple. 
As I took my first few shots, an unmistakable scent filled my nostrils on the breeze. Suddenly, memories rushed back to me from another time. Two years ago, at the Dolphin Hotel, where I first smelled Hoshimachi Suisei’s panties. 
It was a happy accident of circumstance. At the time, I was working as a photographer for Hololive. They had tasked me with creating a winter calendar featuring their lovely idols wearing cozy attire against Hokkaido’s picturesque landscapes. As someone who had previously worked with NHK, my experience made me the perfect candidate for the job. Through my camera lens, I captured the youthful vitality of these charming girls on the snow-caked fields and brought them to life in each photo - precisely what people wanted. 
Although I thoroughly enjoyed taking photos of all the Hololive girls, only one stood out from the rest. Hoshimachi Suisei had a natural talent for working the camera, with the way she bent her hips and held the side of her face with her delicate hands. She was both charming and alluring, with a hint of danger - like a siren calling out to a lonely sailor at sea. 
After a day of taking photos, I returned to my hotel - the Dolphin Hotel in Sapporo. It wasn’t the most modern-looking place. In fact, it appeared as if it hadn’t been updated since the 80s, with the faded neon sign illuminating the dusty exterior of what looked like a love hotel past its prime.
Entering my hotel room that night, I collapsed onto the bed from exhaustion. The world was dead to me, and I just wanted sleep. But when I plopped onto the bed, something flew up and landed on my face without warning - a soft and silky object.
To my surprise, a sweet floral scent emanated from it. Fresh lavender, mixed with powerful earthy undertones. Though caught off guard by this sudden assault on my senses, I couldn’t resist taking one deep whiff.
It was like ambrosia had touched my nostrils. Oh, God. Where has this scent been all of my life?
“Who’s there?” I heard someone say from the bathroom. I recognized the voice almost immediately. 
Could it be...?
A figure stepped out from the bathroom door. It was Suisei, garbed in a bathrobe, with nothing else on but a black, lacy pair of underwear.
That was when I realized it. The thing on my face. I took hold of it, and in my hands, I found a pair of violet panties, still warm with spots of sweat where her dignity would’ve brushed against.
I could see the shock on her face - wide eyes, an agape mouth, but not too horrified. Her expression soon softened into one that was nonplussed, but almost neutral.
“Photographer-san?” she spoke slowly. “Why are you on my bed...?”
It was then that I started to question myself. Had I entered the wrong room by mistake? No, that couldn’t be right - I was certain that this room belonged to me. But why was Suisei here? She might have mistakenly entered my room. Or even worse - we were given the same keys for the same room.
I couldn’t tell which it was. All I knew was that I was on the bed belonging to one of Hololive’s top idols, with her warm underwear in my hands. 
“I...” My eyes darted frantically around the room as I searched for an escape. “I can explain...”
But before I could say more, Suisei shoved me onto the bed and straddled over me with such force that it knocked the wind out of me. I struggled to push her off, but found myself pinned under her unyielding grip.
“You liked them, didn’t you?” she asked me with a sinister grin creeping across her face as madness flickered in her eyes. “TELL ME!” 
Words nearly failed me as my mind raced for answers. Should I tell the truth or lie? Would confessing my love for that sweet, sweet piece of fabric result in pleasure or death?
After considering my options and staring into her eyes for what felt like an eternity, I finally had no choice but to admit defeat.
“I... I loved them,” I whispered softly.
A sly smile crept across Suisei’s lips. 
“Good,” she said. 
Suisei then turned around, toward my pants, and began unbuckling my belt. It only took her a moment before she tossed the belt to one side and revealed my blue Calvin Klein boxers. 
Suddenly, without warning, she pressed her face against them, taking in a deep whiff, followed by an audible sigh. 
“Oh God...” she whispered, her body trembling across my chest. “Finally...”
Her hands reached down and grasped my boxers, touching my manhood with such softness that it sent chills down my spine. She ran her nose along its length, taking in the scent through the fabric. 
Meanwhile, her hips gyrated above my face as her black panties slowly descended toward me. The aroma of soap mixed with lavender filled my senses, filling me with a dangerous urge. 
Unable to resist any longer, I grabbed hold of both her buttocks and pulled her to my face. I inhaled, and that godly scent filled my senses yet again, setting off sparks in my brain. Becoming almost all-consuming. 
We held onto each other as our bodies intertwined in a passion-filled dance - sweat and hormones mixing in a warm embrace that sent electric shocks pulsing through us.  
She then sat up, covering the lower half of my face with her crotch.
“Sniff,” she ordered coldly, before reaching for her phone on the nightstand. 
As instructed, I did what was asked of me, and began sniffing to my heart’s content while she typed away at her phone. She was taking notes, it appeared. But I couldn’t focus on anything else besides sniffing as much as possible. 
She then put down her phone, put both of her hands on my hips, and pulled off my boxers in one fell swoop. 
“Well, you’re not totally useless,” she muttered flatly, before planting a kiss on the tip of my member.
Suisei stood up, pointing herself directly at me. But instead of lowering herself onto me as I expected, something else landed on my dick with an audible ‘pomf’ - her black panties.
“Wear them,” she commanded with the same sharp coldness before slipping into my boxers. 
Confused, I looked down to see my erection covered in the warmth of what used to be the coverings of Suisei’s honor. She wanted me to wear those? Was she serious?
She must have sensed my hesitation because she turned around and glared at me. 
“If you don’t wear them, I’ll scream.”
At a loss for words, I complied with Suisei’s order and began slipping my legs into her underwear. The fabric was surprisingly soft as I pulled them up my thighs, and she held both of my hands while doing so. 
Once those panties covered my crotch completely, she used her own hands to tuck them tightly onto my manhood.
“Beautiful,” she whispered with an odd delight to herself, before pressing her face against the crotch area again - now covered in her underwear - and taking yet another deep sniff.
In response, I pulled her down toward me so that I could partake in a sniff myself - through the boxers that had once belonged to me. To my surprise, they also carried her pleasant aroma of lavender mixed with my own scent.
It was an unusual combination for sure, but it smelled just right. An odd, yet fascinating fragrance all the same.
After a few more moments of sniffing between us, Suisei leaned in so close that her breath was on my lips while she held onto my cheek with one hand. Her tongue slid across the upper half of her soft pink lips before she spoke. 
“When we see each other again,” she said firmly, “You’d better be wearing these panties.”
She then grasped both of my cheeks before pressing her nose against mine and inhaling deeply - as if trying to capture the essence of my very being. A scent that would last for an eternity.
After our encounter, she coldly told me to pick up my pants and leave. Embarrassed and ashamed by what had just happened between us, I chose to keep it to myself.
As time passed, I learned that the room I had accidentally walked into was hers all along - my key just happened to fit in her keyhole.
Despite this misunderstanding, in some strange way, I couldn’t help but feel happy about what had transpired between us.

As I sat on the side of my car along that windy Hokkaido road, I took one more whiff of the delightful lavender scent that lingered in the air. 
I couldn’t help but wonder. Was Suisei still wearing my boxers the same way I was still wearing her panties? It was a unique connection that only we shared - a bond I hoped would remain unbroken.  
A man could only dream... 
Perhaps, if I returned to the Dolphin Hotel, maybe then I could meet my scent-loving friend once again.
