`ENTER: A blank, black screen. Two men talking.`

`PESTILENCE: You ever watch this flick called "Falling Down"?`
`UNKNOWN: Can't say I have.`

`UNKNOWN sounds oddly jolly. There is a low, barely-audible undertone to his speech. It sounds almost like music.`

`PESTILENCE: It's an Earth Aleph flick. Basically, there's this guy who snaps in traffic and kills a bunch of people along the way.`
`UNKNOWN: I'm not following.`
`PESTILENCE: I'm getting there.`

`CUT TO: PESTILENCE, a white, middle-aged man with a receding hairline, sitting in a cubicle. The air-conditioning is shot. As he types on his clunky desktop, he mops at his brow intermittently. A broad-shouldered man, crisply-dressed in a double-breasted suit, appears, prompting PESTILENCE to look up. They have a brief exchange before the man dumps a pile of documents onto PESTILENCE's desk and strides off. PESTILENCE pinches the bridge of his nose.`

`UNKNOWN: That guy had a wife. He had a kid. He even had a car. Did you have any of those?`
`PESTILENCE: No. Not really. Look, I'm just trying to tell a story here.`

`CUT TO: A pair of cheap leather shoes stepping over a hand gone slack. ZOOM OUT to reveal PESTILENCE, still dressed in his sensible shirt-and-trousers combo. The tension is gone from his shoulders. Around him, the entire floor has dissolved into chaos as insects flood from the air-conditioning vents, biting and stinging. A number of people are slumped at their desks, unmoving.`

`UNKNOWN: Are you still employed at that company?`
`PESTILENCE: Don't really know. It all feels like a rather long time ago.`

`CUT TO: PESTILENCE entering an office. The broad-shouldered man from earlier is lying, slumped boneless, in his large, comfortable chair. His eyeballs have liquefied. PESTILENCE places an envelope on his desk labelled "RESIGNATION".`

`PESTILENCE: I think I resigned, actually.`
`UNKNOWN: Hmm. All right. I don't think there should be a problem there.`
`PESTILENCE: Yes. I'd hate for there to be anything improper about this arrangement.`

`CUT TO: PESTILENCE entering a green 1972 AMC Hornet. He turns the key in the ignition, chuckles under his breath, and drives off, revealing the Hornet's original owner writhing on the sidewalk, covered in bees.`

`PESTILENCE: Anyway, that's why I'm here. I don't think I'm a wanted guy right this instant, because I haven't seen my name or my face on the TV, but I figure I could be an asset to the company. If you'll have me.`
`UNKNOWN: I see. I see. Well, everything appears to be in order, so I'd be happy to welcome you to the organization personally.`
`PESTILENCE: It's an honor, sir.`

`CUT TO: UNKNOWN rising to his feet, revealing himself to be THE BIG CHEESE. He envelops PESTILENCE's hand in a crushing grip.`

`THE BIG CHEESE: You're hired!`
