>All Author's Note has ever been (regardless of model) is text that gets "injected" into the story context three lines up from the bottom. Because that's so close to the current generation, it can be disruptive if you put something bad or simply just too much in there.
> 
>It's fine (even extremely useful) for stuff like one line of scene direction, or style guidance, usually bracketed.

> AN is pretty brutal, and it can topple a perfectly fine context over by being so close to the bottom.
> But if you need a sledgehammer, it's the right tool.
>
> You need to keep it very short, that stuff that goes at the end is important, and that you should purge it regularly.
>
>Still seems like an overkill. Could just edit one instance into the context, instead of constantly keeping it in there.

> I know this is easier said than done, but consider retiring the Author's Note field. I see a lot of people, here and on Reddit, assume that they need to put [] instructions there, which confuses the heck out of Euterpe and Krake. That's because these models' datasets use tags only at the start of a new story, chapter, or scene. Seeing tags close to bottom of context leads the model to assume that the user is trying to start a new narrative, and disregard information higher up in the context. At best, the user's AN info doesn't have the effect they're hoping for, and at worse the AI starts giving you dumb, unpredictable output.

> Essentially, using Author's Note hasn't been a good user practice since Euterpe replaced Sigurd as the default model. It no longer does what users expect, and 99% of the time it does more harm than good. And given its very prominent position in the Story sidebar, a lot of users unwittingly sabotage their own stories because they assume it must be doing something useful.
>
> A lot of default scenarios use Author's Note, and I've seen one or two users claim to have found useful applications (which might be placebo or not) but overall, we've reached a point where the vast majority of users are better off without it.

> I just read that, and strongly disagree with the comment about the Author's Note. Which I know isn't the focus of your guide. 
> However, the Author's Note is really important for keeping the AI on track *within* a specific scene and only for that scene. 
> The three things I put into the Author's Note now are: `Setting:`, `Remember:`, and `Fact:`.
> E.g. `Setting: Blake and I are at the lake at night` (this is what I use least frequently).
> `Remember: Andrea is trying to convince David to give him the key`
>`Fact: No starships have gravity`
>
>Often I will only introduce these if/when the AI is struggling with some important element of the scene.
>
> Yeah, I agree with all these points. I wonder if it should be renamed. To something like "Immediate Direction"
