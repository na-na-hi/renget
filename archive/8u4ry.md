##### `Cold War Prompt`
>Location: Smalltown USA.
>Era: Peak Cold War Panic.
>One All-American Anon and the rough-and-tumble redhead tomboy from down the lane solve zany after-school mysteries.
>He's got the brains and the M14. She's got the nose and the muscle.
>Together they thwart the communist sympathizers who cloned Stalin's brain in a secret laboratory under the town water treatment plant as part of a dastardly scheme to pollute America's rivers with nuclear waste.
>She tries to keep him from finding out about her curse. No guy, especially not Anon, would love a monster. He fights monsters.
>But one night while they're out on a case the moonlight is too strong.
>She dives out of his Chevrolet Bel Air as the change ripples through her body. Rushes into the forest.
>He goes after her, deeply worried. Brings along his Starlight scope. With the full moon high, he can see everything through it.
>The change is harsh tonight. Buttons pop off her flannel shirt. Her jeans tear open. Claws burst from her fingers as fur floods across her body. Usually she can control it, especially when she's choosing to change, but tonight's a chiller-thriller.
>Bloodcurdling howl.
>She smells him. Hears his heartbeat. Knows he saw her. Fear and anger. She's driven by pure instinct now. Turns. Barks a warning.
>He doesn't run. Humans always run. Some terrible fear deep in every human heart makes them run. But he stands there, watching her through that scope with a little USA flag in its optic cover. These colors don't run.
>Growl, flex. Try to drive him away. For his own good. She takes a step. So does he. Then another. She leans away, barely restraining the bloodlust.
>He reaches out. Doesn't care that she's snarling. Gently scritches behind her ears.
>Confusion. Then she melts onto the ground. As he pets her, she shifts from werewolf to full-wolf.
>With her head in his lap and her tongue hanging out, they look up at the stars and Soviet spy satellites in the night sky above.
