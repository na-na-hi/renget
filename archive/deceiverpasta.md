He clutched his head in despair, sweat running down his face. How did he end up like this? Gritting his teeth, he tried to recall what happened prior to this, what led him to play this accursed game – to no avail. His mind drew a blank – rather, it was forced to. He forced it to. He couldn’t remember his friends. He couldn’t remember his family. He couldn’t even remember his name. All he was allowed to think about was the game in front of him. The monitor’s bright light was beginning to irritate his eyes. He had to do something. He started screaming at the top of his lungs, hoping someone w-

Suddenly coughing blood, the player got out of the chair, finally having control of his body again, and started slowly crawling towards the door. But it was too little, too late; his vision started giving away, he couldn’t feel his limbs anymore, and eventually all his senses went fully numb. 

“Thank-a you so much for playing! Unfortunately, that’ll be your last game with me.”   

He couldn’t see anything. He couldn’t feel anything. He could only hear his voice.

“Now… do you wanna know what happens with cheaters?”

He manages to open his eyes again. He has regained his vision. His body was frozen in place; all he could do was stare ahead at the dozen of Koopa Troopas standing in front of him. He could hear the pained whispers of the Yoshis behind him.

“**For them, my game *NEVER* ENDS.**”
