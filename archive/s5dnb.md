WARNING: LARPING INFOBROKING AHEAD
 
Shotaschizo abruptly appeared in mid-June 2023. He posted p_do fatfaggotry relatively quietly for a few weeks, only occasionally sperging out over trans Ralsei due to /pol/ brainrot. During this calm period he more readily shared information about himself, none of it reflecting on him well:

The full-on meltdown began in mid-July, July 16th to be specific, with this post that will live in infamy:

Although shotaschizo had mentioned "GJJ" and other boogeymen in passing before, the subsequent maggotposting is what broke his brain once and for all. "TC" as a phrase did not exist outside of fighting game generals, and certainly not on /utg/, until the 16th of July. After the maggot post, it suddenly exploded to being mentioned dozens of times every hour:

During the endless month-long threadshitting session that followed, shotaschizo at several points mentioned being "gone for years" and his amusement at coming back to find the evil "TC" still dominating the thread (...if only in his mind). The following posts are some of many examples:
https://files.catbox.moe/a0qhsu.png
 
Shotaschizo's seething rage towards "TC" comes from his belief that anybody who dislikes him for his grotesque sexual fantasies is, in fact, one singular person out to get him. Although the exact content of these fantasies vary, anyone who's been in the thread the past month will note his affection for three particular things: sh_ta, weight gain, and inc_st. He uses Asriel as an outlet for all three of these - morbidly obese shota Asriel, Asriel f_cking his mom (dat's how Ralsei was conceived guise), etc.
 
Knowing this, let's hop over to this e621 user by the name of "AsrielCreamer".
https://e621.net/users/312768
 
We immediately notice that his favs are full of shota Asriel AND Asriel/Toriel inc_st, including the grotesque "hyper c_ck Toriel raping Asriel" comic that was catboxed and used as a shock link for a period:

Most interesting however are the two images he's uploaded, both of which depict morbidly obese shota Asriel. Both of these images have been posted by the shotaschizo over the past few months:

What's most interesting is that the filenames of these images, as posted to 4chan, are an exact match to those generated by e6, meaning the uploader of these images is virtually guaranteed to have got them from that same e621 page:

Looking a little closer into e621 user "AsrielCreamer", we find an interesting gap in their history. Their account was created on October 28, 2017, and they favorited hundreds of images in a short timespan. Although e621 doesn't show the date that a user favorited something, we can easily infer the timeframe by seeing when the images "AsrielCreamer" faved were uploaded. We notice that "AsrielCreamer" was very active up till about the time of Deltarune's release, then vanished from the site, favoriting no pictures for 4 years:

Recall the shotaschizo's frequent posts about being "gone for years", particularly the one in which he bets his boogeyman would still be there "if [he] left for another 4 years". 
 
Something else interesting about "AsrielCreamer" - the first image he ever uploaded himself, after apparently returning to the UT/DR fandom, was posted on June 17:
https://files.catbox.moe/stzl7f.png
 
The first /vg/ post to EVER mention "GJJ", one of the shotaschizo's primary boogeyman, was made on /utg/ that exact same day:
https://files.catbox.moe/gzcsy3.png
 
On the topic of the images uploaded by "AsrielCreamer", if we look at the tag history we notice something a little unusual. The majority of people who upload images to e621 either upload the images directly from their computer/desktop, or through a Twitter/FurAffinity/etc. link. These images, however, are sourced directly from a personal website I had never seen before:
https://files.catbox.moe/zkvmp2.png
 
Mintosoft.net is a website owned by an unashamed shotafag who particularly enjoys drawing disgusting, morbidly obese Asriel images. In fact, they're even open for commissions:
https://files.catbox.moe/u0m3mm.png
https://files.catbox.moe/0lhqst.png
 
Looking at their commission info, we find - oh, how interesting! They go by the name "AsrielCreamer" elsewhere:
https://files.catbox.moe/rwa5bl.png
 
Their Steam profile is particularly humorous, showing they're a member of the "4CHAN PARTY VAN" group and have received numerous comments on their page calling them out for being an open p_dophile:
https://files.catbox.moe/h55zc9.png
 
I wouldn't be surprised if some of these comments result from their activity in games like TF2, in which uploaded screenshots show them acting like a degenerate troll and "spraying" morbidly obese furry p_rn on server walls (although, in their defense, it's not shota Asriel at least):
https://files.catbox.moe/7xiwuc.png
 
The one and only hitch preventing me from saying "Mint/AsrielCreamer is the shotaschizo" is this post made using their official tripcode, posted on the same day the maggotposting/TC spamming began. They claim they couldn't be responsible because they were "at a friend's house". As a bonus, the second post here shows the first time the morbidly obese Asriel uploaded by "AsrielCreamer" was ever posted to /utg/:
https://files.catbox.moe/0frmsv.png
 
There are two possibilities. Either the shotaschizo is Mint/AsrielCreamer themselves, or they're someone very closely affiliated with them. Mint is known to have been part of the Discord clique that (allegedly) included the evil tyrant "GJJ", alongside Pecca and other degenerates. If the shotaschizo isn't Mint themselves, there's a 100% chance it was someone in that server who knew them well - they may even still be in Mint's friendlist or mutual contacts somewhere. This is, of course, if you buy the "it's not me guise I was... at my friend's teehee" excuse.
 
Either way, hopefully this larping infobrokery leads to them f_cking off once and for all.
