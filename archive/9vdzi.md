\>If you’ve learned anything while growing up, it’s that the world is a strange place and you can’t really ever be sure what you’re going to get out of it.
\>There’s so much that you were certain would never happen as a young man that eventually came to pass that you can’t help but wonder what little surprise will be around the corner next.
\>You crack a smile and look over at the most immediate example: your saurian boyfriend, still sleeping quietly next to you and softly pressing himself into your back.
\>Or, as quietly as a T-Rex can sleep. His snore has already woken you up for the 3rd time this week, but it’s a small price to pay for the immense comfort you feel when you’re nestled beside him.
\>You figured out a long time ago that he’s so heavy anything on the bed gets drawn towards him when he tosses and turns on the old mattress, to say nothing of when he actually gets grabby.
\>You’re resigned to your role as his security blanket for the foreseeable future, and he sleeps much more soundly when he has you to hold on to; it’s a win-win situation for both of you.
\>At this point in your relationship, the surprise is less “Will I wake up in his arms?” and more “Will I be facing towards him or away from him when it happens?”
\>You still remember the first day that you woke up to find his tail curled around you after a sleepover your parents had arranged, something which gave you no end of material to tease him about.
\>He tried to swear up and down that he *didn’t* want to cuddle with you, and that he *didn’t* want your face to be the first thing he saw every morning, but he wound up tripping over his words so much that he basically confessed his feelings on the spot.
\>It came as a shock at the time, but you quickly turned the tables by giving him a quick peck on the cheek that left him stunned; your relationship has been one pleasant surprise after another ever since.

\>He was built like a truck even back then, but puberty has been *good* to him-especially because your body is almost aggressively average and nondescript by comparison.
\>You suspect that if someone could see him pressed up against you like this, they’d tell you that you looked almost doll-like in your large lover’s hands.
\>They’re each about as wide as your waist, but it just makes it all the more fun when he gets frisky and decides to cop a feel, and though your buttocks are nowhere near large enough to warrant it, he always uses both hands to work you over. There isn’t much he can do about the size difference, but little things like this help boost your confidence- the knowledge that he’s trying so hard to treat you as an equal goes a long way to helping you feel loved.
\>You suppose it comes with the territory of being an apex predator and a huge dinosaur to boot, but everything about him just *radiates* raw strength and masculinity. He’s nearly triple your height, and covered head to toe in more beef than a cattle ranch.
\>You take a moment to appreciate the finer points of your lover’s reptilian form, as you drift along in a sleepy hug that makes you want nothing more than to let your consciousness melt away and relax.
\>The arms currently wrapped around you are thickly corded with muscle and come to a clearly defined head, a feat which is doubly impressive given his species’ reputation for scrawny forelimbs.
\>When he’s not showing off or exerting himself, they’re soft and make great pillows.
\>Though you can’t see them right now, you can feel his broad shoulders, mountainous chest, and shredded stomach flex against you as he tightens the hug a little more, still snoring away.
\>But you know the real prize is what’s below the belt, as any T-Rex aficionado will tell you- his species is notoriously bottom-heavy, in keeping with their evolutionary past.
\>At their thickest point, his legs are about the size of monster truck tires; when he really gets in the mood for a run he can keep up with most cars without too much effort now that he’s fully grown.
\>And all that running and squatting keeps his big bubble-butt nice and tight, too.
\>It’s about as bulky as the rest of him, with each titanic cheek being about as wide as you are tall, and you’ve popped many a boner watching it jiggle enticingly with every thundering footstep he takes.
\>Despite its sheer size, it is firm and springy, a testament to the countless hours your lover spends maintaining his body in the local dinosaur gym.
\>Even his tail is overwhelmingly thick, allowing you to use it as a full-body pillow when he curls up around you like a dragon atop its treasure hoard.

\>His genitals are certainly nothing to sneeze at either.
\>Growing up in an area with lots of theropods (and lax laws on public indecency) made you sort of numb to the banality of it all, and you had gotten used to seeing him nude during your middle school days.
\>But once puberty hit you caught yourself looking at him differently, sneaking the occasional sidelong glance when you thought you could get away with it and blushing beet red.
\>When your dad handed him his enormous scaly ass on a silver platter, your biggest regret is that you were too much of a coward to watch the fight go down.
\>Not only because watching one of your parents fistfight a T-Rex was probably the coolest thing your young mind could conceive of, but because it would’ve given you ample opportunity to ogle him.
\>The sound of the meaty smack as fist-met-testicle and the pained roar afterward is forever burned into both of your minds, although it’s definitely more intense for him.
\>His balls were probably about the size of oranges then, but their size has always been a little hard to gauge, given that they’re internal- if he didn’t routinely start leaking pre-cum when you gave him a good tummy-rub, you’d have no clue where they were. Now that he’s fully grown, they’re probably about the size of medicine balls, located on either side of an otherwise unassuming slit where his cock hides.
\>You would be jealous, were he not an exceptionally doting boyfriend.

\>Eventually, the alarm clock sounds, and you snap from your cuddle-induced reverie.
\>Your boyfriend has other ideas, and quickly silences the alarm with an authoritative thwack of his tail.
\>You wouldn’t object, but the pressure on your body from the intense spooning has left you needing to answer the call of nature.
\>You begin to struggle against his iron grip, but it doesn’t really do much except tire you out.
\>Unable to find any sort of purchase which would let you break free of your own strength, you take a different tactic and try to get him to release you of his own volition.
\>Because your arms are pinned underneath his weight and you’re facing away from him, there’s only one real option left that you can think of; you just hope he’s not too mad when he comes to.
\>You push your leg forward, and then slam it back behind you like a horse would to buck its rider.
\>The effect is immediate and he does release you, although the aftermath isn’t quite what you expected.
\>After you’ve recovered from his point-blank roar you turn around to see him reflexively rubbing the section of stomach where you know his balls to be- but between his arms you can spot the tell-tale signs of arousal, as the tip of his ribbed reptilian cock starts peeking out of its hidey-hole.
\>You mentally file the tidbit away for later while moving to comfort him.
\>He growls “Hell was that for?!” as you approach, angry at the rude awakening.
\>Once you explain what happened, his face softens a bit and he sheepishly puts a hand behind his head
\>”We need to work on a better way to wake me up… For a second, I thought your dad had come to kick my ass for not treating you right.”
\>”Speaking of, I couldn’t help but notice you’ve gotten quite the case of morning wood since I hit you.”
\>He tries his best to regain his composure, but he’s clearly embarrassed by his body’s reaction; there’s *no* way you’ll pass up an opportunity like this, especially when it could lead to some kinky results later

\>After a bit of prodding, and a much-needed trip to the bathroom, he finally spills the beans and you both take a seat next to one another on the bed.
\>”I’m not proud to admit it, but that day with your dad really changed me.”
\>”No duh.” You say, giving him a good-natured punch on the shoulder.
\> “That wasn’t what I meant, but there’s that too. I mean, I really thought I was hot shit up until that point in my life. It was the first real time anybody had straight-out beaten me into submission.”
\> “If we’re being embarrassingly honest, I wouldn’t even consider it a “fight” because of how one-sided it was. To this day, I think he *saved* me from a dead-end life as a good-for-nothing punk.”
\>”And here I thought that Punk was your aesthetic?”, you quip.
\>”Very funny.” he says sarcastically, “But I’m trying to be serious here.”
\>”What I was getting at”, he says in a slight huff, “was that it was a *sensitive* time in my life.” 
\>”You remember what it was like to be a teen, right? All the hormones and weird urges coming up for the first time? Just so happens that having my potatoes mashed kind of stuck with me.”
\> He pauses to think of the appropriate way to convey his feelings, and you take the opportunity to go on the offensive. ”Wait, so my *dad* was responsible for your sexual awakening? And here I thought that all those sloppy make-out sessions in the boys’ bathroom were what kicked it off. But why hide it?”
\> He sighs before moving on, having elected to ignore your attempt to make light of the embarrassing situation. Whatever the reason for his serious demeanor, it must’ve been eating away at him for a while.
\>“I was afraid that you’d think less of me. You’re always going *on* and *on* about how manly I am and how much you *love* my strength, so I didn’t want to ruin your image of me by acting on my submissive urges.”
\>With a grimace, he adds “I didn’t want you to know that I *like* getting my ass kicked or that I *want* to, as your dad put it so many years ago, “get my balls busted and my ego bruised.””

\>You have to hand it to him, he’s an excellent actor. But at the same time, a part of your heart sinks to know that he was shouldering such a burden alone in attempt to make you happier.
\>It might seem like a small thing to you, but he clearly expects some huge fallout from the revelation.
\>You lean into him, resting one hand on his thigh before answering. You want to soothe his insecurities as best you can before the situation deteriorates any further.
\>”What am I going to *do* with you, you big lug? When I first told you I loved you, I meant *all* of you. There’s no way I’d think less of you for something like *that*”.
\>He eyes you warily, but lets you continue without interruption.
\>”In fact, I’d been worried for a long time that you were putting so much more effort into the relationship than I was. I praised you so much because I was genuinely *amazed* I could ever win the heart of someone so great. I don’t really know what you see in me when you look like that, and I’m just a run-of-the-mill human that you could find anywhere..”
\>At that, he places his hand on top of yours and rests his head on your shoulder. The size difference is so extreme that you can’t really interlace your fingers, but you appreciate the gesture nonetheless.
\> “It’s true that I love your strength, but it’s just one part of who you are, and I’d never want you to deny yourself something that could make you happier so long as it didn’t do any lasting harm. So, why don’t we give it a try this weekend? On one condition, of course.”
\>He hesitates briefly, before quietly asking “What’s the condition?”
\>”The next time something like this comes up, just tell me instead of bottling it up?”
\>”Deal.”

\>The week passes relatively quickly and your boyfriend is keeping himself busy at work, as are you.
\>However, you have some additional work to do in preparation of the big event, and you find yourself making a number of stops on the way home over the course of the week.
\>You can’t get everything you need at one store, so you have it delivered sporadically from various outlets; you got some smooth steel rods of various sizes from the hardware store, a pair of pants one size larger than he usually wears from the saurian clothing retailer, and some over-the-counter pain meds in case things should go tits-up.
\>Your boyfriend, on the other hand, has been preparing in his own way.
\>The fact that you were so accepting of his kink without any reservations has eased a burden of stress off his shoulders, and his sex drive has noticeably increased as a result. 
\>Likewise, the knowledge that he’s going to get to live out one of his biggest sexual fantasies is driving him into a frenzy as the week goes on. At first, it’s just a slight twinge, but it rapidly spirals into a rut-like trance- a singular and omnipresent longing for the day when you’ll make good on your promise
\>You can tell that he routinely plays things out in his head, losing himself in his fantasies while doing his daily drudgery. You’ve caught him more than once with his hand on his stomach, gently rubbing his testes in anticipation.
\>He’s admitted to you that he has to avoid getting up too fast so as to avoid knocking over important stacks of paper with his turgid boner, and you notice that whenever he disrobes after coming home the crotch of his slacks is soaked with streams of  slimy pre-cum.
\>Seeing him get so worked up only turns you on even more.

\>Finally, the week is over, and Friday night rolls around.
\>You both sit down for a nice dinner at home, but neither of you is really interested in the food as much as what you know is coming after, and you finish your meals in relative quiet.
\>The only sound as you enter the bedroom is the creak of the floorboards as you both sit on the bed.
\>In his typical fashion, he lies on his back so that you can take part in stripping him.
\>You crawl up his stomach to undo his shirt at the neck, and he takes the opportunity to lean forward and give you a sloppy kiss as you lie nestled in the valley between his pecs. “Kiss” is a bit of a misnomer- he doesn’t have lips as such and his tongue is too large by far to fit in your mouth. Still, it doesn’t keep the sparks of pleasure from catching as you lay your cheek on his.
\>Each pectoral so voluminous that you can comfortably fit most of your body between them, and you give them an appreciative squeeze as you undo the first massive button on his shirt, eliciting a pleased rumble from your boyfriend as he lays back and lets you go to work..
\>”You have no idea how much I’ve been looking forward to this.”
\>”Oh *yes* I do”, you retort. “It was my turn to do the laundry this week, remember? I had to wring out your pants before I put them in the wash so that they wouldn’t get the rest of the load slimy.”
\>”Don’t say *load*.” He groans. “This is probably the most backed up I’ve been in my life…”
\>You briefly snicker, feeling your lips curl into a playful sneer. 
\>He knows that look. It is equal parts a promise that he hasn’t seen anything yet and a comforting assurance that he just needs to relax and he’ll be in for some of the best sex of his life.
\>At the same time, your boyfriend’s anxiety promptly begins to spike at the thought of what you might’ve planned to fulfill his fetish given a week of prep time, and what he might do to you when you succeed.
\>It’s a natural part of any relationship where there’s such a dramatic difference in durability. You know that he’d never *consciously* hurt you, but accidents can happen in the heat of the moment, and he can’t really guarantee your safety when he’s thrashing around in the throes of orgasm.
\>You can tell that he’s considering voicing a doubt, but you silence him with a quick kiss on the cheek before you undo the first button around his neck.
\>”It’s been years since we first started sleeping together, y’know?”, you say, running a hand along the underside of his huge jaw. “Nothing’s going to happen to me. I trust you with my life.”
\>His slit-eyes narrow, but he remains silent. You know he’d never be able to forgive himself if something were to happen, but you’ve both put in too much effort into making this relationship work to have this conversation every time you try something new in the bedroom.
\> His nerves sufficiently calmed, you turn around and give a seductive wiggle of your hips before diving under his shirt.

\>You can smell it long before you get to touch it, but your boyfriend’s odor is heavy with the musky aroma of sexual frustration, and as you take in a deep lungful of the scent, your own erection quickly works its way to full mast in response to the heady pheromones.
\>You grind your way down his abs, unconsciously humping away at the crevices as you shimmy ever-closer to your goal. In turn, he picks up where you left off, hastily unbuttoning his shirt to try to flush you out.
\>The last push to his crotch is slippery with his copious pre, and you wind up taking a nose dive which stops just short of his underwear, something which gives your boyfriend no end of amusement.
\> Having finally managed to loosen up a bit, he gives you a playful tap on the butt, sending you face first into his loins with an audible *squelch*.
\>The smell was strong before, but up close, it’s *indescribable*; everything else is driven from your mind by the intoxicating sights and smells before you.
\>In the fiery light of the sunset, your boyfriend’s scales are dyed a crisp orange-brown like an autumn wood. Your mate has long since eased his slacks off and let himself bask in the sun as you minister to his needs, and the long shadows cast by the dying day only accentuate the pre-seed beading from his penile vent.
\>Addled by his pheromones as you are, you can only bury your face in the slime-covered scales and motor-boat the opening with a much force as you can muster through the thick fabric of his underwear. 
\>Though you can’t get directly at his unmentionables, he lets out a pleased hiss at your ministrations; you feel the cool flesh beneath you go hot as blood rushes south. His rapidly hardening cock rises to meet your kisses, and though it is too large to fit inside you by a fair margin, you can get enough of the tip in your mouth to give it a good suck.
\>The fluid, though a little thin, still possesses a distinctive masculine tang that sits in the back of your throat, sharp as the alcoholic burn of a stiff drink. As it grows to full mast, the ensuing tent lifts you back towards your lover’s chest, leaving his elastic waistband to descend on his midsection with a wet *smack*, a prelude of things to come.
\>Beneath your feet, you can feel his stomach’s curvature is slightly different, swollen with liquid virility- his internal testicles are so heavy with cum as a result of his lack of release the past week, you only hope they can weather what you’ve got planned for him. If you’re lucky, you’ll have them looking like fleshy sandbags before the night is out.
\>He lets out a soft huff before sitting up, taking the active role in order to give you time to recover; he clutches you to his chest like a parent would their child while he shimmies out of his sodden briefs.

\>In the comparatively fresh air, your head clears significantly and you get back to the matter at hand.
\>Once you have your wits about you again, you whisper “Next time I go down on you, remind me to pack scuba gear. I nearly suffocated down there.”
\>You put on your best hammy 1920s newscaster impression and smarm: “Tonight’s top story: The Cummy Catastrophe! Tragedy strikes as local mixed-species couple’s sexual escapades turn sour after the human drowns in his massive mate’s soaking slit. More at 11!”
\>He strokes you on the back with a claw and apologizes before moving to explain himself.
\>”I thought you could handle yourself- and you know I wouldn’t have let anything *serious* happen. I figured since you were doing so much to indulge my passive side, I could let you have your fun.”
“Can’t have been too shaken up if you can still make jokes.”
\>You’re just about to attempt another retort but all you can manage is a curt “kiss my ass” as you turn to face his cock.
\>Your boyfriend, eager to oblige (or alternatively, to keep you off-guard), lifts you up with his tongue and begins licking away at your hole without much warning, causing you to jolt forward and grab the nearest object- his dick.
\>You’re left clinging on for dear life as it twitches and throbs at the sudden stimulus, leading you to get an idea; you had originally planned to use the rods for this, but you might as well get yourself off in the meantime.
\>You pull yourself back, touching your feet down back onto your boyfriend’s chest and wrangling his cock into position while he watches, an amused chuckle echoing behind you. The ridges along its surface make for natural handholds, and in no time at all, you’ve got it pointing towards his face- following the curvature of his pelvis, so hard that it aches.
\>You take the opportunity to push forward, slumping atop the reptilian rod and aligning your own cock with his urethra; you’ve replaced what was no doubt a smug smile with a muffled whimper as he presses a pillow over his face to stifle the noise. 
\>Trapped as it is beneath your body weight, it is surprisingly yielding to your advance; the passage is warm, wet, and tight around you, and despite the lack of preparation, you slide in easily because of all the lubrication. 
\>You thrust and corkscrew as best you can, riding the offending cock like a tilt-a-whirl as your boyfriend lets out an increasingly loud series of grunts into the pillow beneath you.
\>You finish explosively, your own cock firing a dense series of spurts down into the depths of your boyfriend’s balls; though it’s not nearly as voluminous as the thick load he already had brewing down there, it’s still satisfying for you to momentarily watch the flow of pre-cum halt as your own cum-shot sinks down.
\>You then move to get the rods, the sexual haze having somewhat cleared from your mind…

\>Your boyfriend, emboldened by the sudden lack of pressure against his junk removes the pillow from his face and looks at you quizzically as you pore over the comparatively huge steel rods.
\>You motion to him to take the one about half the width of his cock up to the bed along with you, and he quickly manages to get you secured in one hand, and the rod in the other before laying back down on the bed and positioning you and the rod atop his chest, erection still throbbing defiantly towards you
\>He shoots you a look to the effect of “What am I supposed to do with this?”
\>You reply flatly, “It’s going inside.”
\>”What?”
\>”You heard me, big guy. This thing is going to go in the same hole that my cum disappeared into.”
\>You explain, “I plan to keep my promise, but *that* is an integral part of the plan, so I expect you to play along for a bit. If it hurts too much, we can just try a smaller one until we find the right fit.”
\>”Well, okay. But I still don’t see the point”, he sighs.
\>You put on your most mysterious voice and your smuggest smile before you say ”You will, when the time comes. Just hold your dick steady so I can fit this thing inside”
\>Gingerly, you roll the rod to the appropriate angle, and apply some pressure to the end until it meets his shaft.
\>Your lover breathes in sharply as the cool metal meets with his sensitive corona, but he does his best to spread his cock-slit as wide as he can to speed things up.
\>The lubrication, combined with the vigorous urethra-fucking earlier has left his cock-slit gaped somewhat, and the rod quickly finds its way to the base of his cock, all but stopping the flow of pre.
\>As a newfound ache begins to settle in his pelvis, your boyfriend begins to catch on to your scheme.
\>”So, you planned on blue-balling me before you got on with it?”
\>”Mhm❣ By the end of the night, you won’t even be able to tell if they’re blue because you’re pent up, or because I’ve been putting them through the wringer!”
\>”We just need to have a *little* test first to make sure that it works the way it’s supposed to”, you say, and circle around so that you’re standing atop his balls. They shift a little beneath your feet, but you soon find clear footing by leaning against the cock in front of you.
\>”Get ready with that pillow if you’re going to use it, eh? This is going to get messy.”
\>”Wouldn’t have it any another way, love.”

\>At that, you begin giving your boyfriend’s enormous cock a full-body hug-job. It’s actually a bit more manageable than usual because the weight of the steel rod prevents it from jerking itself out of your grasp.
\>He, on the other hand, is clearly struggling to maintain his composure; the alien sensation of something hard inside such a sensitive place is definitely adding a whole new dimension of pleasure to something he’d long since taken for granted as part of your sexual routine.
\>In short order he’s panting hard, but you don’t let up on him for a minute and quickly drive him over the edge as he writhes beneath your practiced hands.
\>You can feel his abdomen roiling under your feet, tightening up in preparation for him to ejaculate, only to relax as the weight of the steel rod forces the deluge of semen back down from whence it came.
\>At this, your lover lets out a sharp whine as the pressure in his stomach redoubles and they swell even further as the weight of the old load adds on to the new one already brewing.
\>”You’re a clever little shit, you know that?! I just thought you wanted hurt me with this weird rod, but you actually managed to get around my refractory period entirely while you were at it.”
\>”Don’t I know it?” you smarm.  “How does it feel to be this pent up?”
\>”Honestly? It’s *amazing*”, he gushes. ”I wasn’t sure about this blue-balling thing at first, but the pressure down there almost reminds me of the day I learned about this fetish to begin with. It’s like you kicked me and just kept your foot there.”
\>”That ache is going to get worse before it gets better.” You say, shifting your weight to put more pressure on his nuts.  “I haven’t even *started* playing with you yet.”
\>His cock gives a twitch in your grasp, as he coos “I was *really* hoping you’d say that.” 

\>You begin jumping up and down on top of his midsection, using his cock  like a perverse pogo-stick to launch yourself up and slam yourself down with increasing fervor. 
\>Each time you take off, and each time you land, your lover has to stifle a moan as your full body-weight is brought to bear on his enormous nuts, which have steadily continued to grow, swelling his middle ever further with the liquid weight of his denied orgasm.
\>He comes to another orgasm just as quickly as the first, but the intensity seems to have increased proportionally with the size of his balls. There’s no snappy comeback or witty retort as he roars his approval into the pillow, and his penis throbs and flexes in your grip for the second time.
\>He’s even started bucking his hips in time with your jumps to make sure you land extra-hard.
\>Granted, your ears are ringing since there’s no pillow in the world that can fully muffle a T-Rex, but you take it as high praise all the same.
\>You hold on for dear life as you milk him towards a third shattering orgasm and his cock jerks so hard that it nearly wrestles itself completely from your grasp.
\>The steel rod within seems to have risen just slightly from the sheer pressure of the cum forcing it upward, but it remains firmly lodged within even as your lover bucks wildly in an attempt to force it out
\>You momentarily release his cock and dismount to stand between his thighs, letting him catch his breath while you recover from the intense workout.
\>You notice that the interval between his orgasms has rapidly shortened as time passes; the inability to ejaculate has evidently made him aroused to the point of hypersensitivity.
\>He shudders and writhes beneath you, the slightest caress of his genitals making him whine in protest.
\>Your boyfriend’s testicles have grown as large as beanbag chairs, and his once-trim tummy has noticeably rounded from the size of his inflated orbs. It throbs visibly in time with his penis, the fluid within pressurized to the point that you can almost hear them audibly sloshing.
\>You don’t really want to push him too much further in that regard; if he’s managed to get to this state with raw cum production alone, he probably can’t take much more without seriously hurting something.

\>You take the opportunity to ask how he’s feeling, but all you get in return is mostly insensate moans, interspersed with one intelligible word: “harder”.
\>You worry that you might be going a bit too far, but if he really wants it…
\>Switching tactics, you kneel on his Adonis belt. You slap your palms against it as a test, and the effect is immediate; another powerful orgasm strikes your lover’s body and he roars again. Wild though he is, a studly apex predator 300 million years in the making, he is yours to do with as you please in the bedroom; watching him beg for it, and seeing him squirm under your touch is intoxicating.
\>Emboldened, you settle into a rhythm, playing his testicles like a set of bongos; it’s his turn to hang on for dear life as you pummel his sensitive jewels like an expert percussionist. Even through the cushion of his thick scales and abdominal walls absorbing most of the impact, you can still feel the cum-laden weight of his family jewels respond to your flurry of blows.
\>His toes curl, his sharp claws digging deep gashes in the mattress as orgasm after orgasm rips through him, and you can tell it’s taking every ounce of restraint he has not to give into the reflex to clutch his balls and interrupt the pleasurable assault.
\>Eventually, exhaustion calms him; his dick can no longer flex and spurt after so many back-to-back orgasms, and instead twitches defiantly at his face, tinged red by the continuous overstimulation.
\>You are exhausted too, and can barely muster the strength to raise your arms to strike his balls any further.
\>Besides, you’d probably get squished by their sheer mass if you tried to keep it going; his belly has grown to the point that it nearly smothers you, forcing him to spread his legs apart for fear of setting off another orgasm, and forcing you to change position.
\>Panting, you clamber up his mountainous form, working your way back to his cockhead. With both of your bodies slicked with sweat and pre-seed, it takes some doing to get yourself back to where the steel rod waits, dutifully holding back the veritable tsunami of cum.
\>You grip at his cockhead, determined to grant him release before you both pass out from exertion, if only to avoid doing any permanent damage.
\>You wrench at the rod with all your strength, falling backwards as you finally manage to extract it, falling into his chest with a wet plop as it rolls off his side, and the resultant force drives him to a final climax.
\>He whispers a hoarse “Thank…  you..” as his testicles begin to disgorge their load all over his chest.
\>It doesn’t spurt so much as it oozes, thick globs draining out like honey from a squeeze-bottle on a cold day. You’ve gotten him too pent up for it to do much else, the fluid almost paste-like in its density
\>The both of you can only lay there, basking in the afterglow and enjoying the fruits of your labor as his cum flows glacially down his body, staining the bed before eventually pooling on the floor. You’re so relaxed by the pleasure of release and the endless cascade of warm cum that you can’t help but give in to your collective exhaustion and drift off.

\>You awaken several hours later, still lying face-down in your boyfriend’s chest. It is still night-time.
\>His usually thunderous snore has slackened off into a quiet rumble; the poor guy probably screamed himself hoarse from your little escapade last night.
\>You’re not complaining about being able to wake up on your own for once, and without being crushed underneath his weight. 
\>His hand is still protectively draped over you, but it’s loose enough that you could easily wiggle out of it if you were so inclined.
\>However, now that you think about it you feel a familiar pins-and-needles sort of numbness from your lower body, but you can’t really turn around in your current position to figure out why. 
\>You settle for stroking your boyfriend’s chin in an attempt to wake him up. Slowly, he rouses himself from the orgasm-induced stupor, his tongue snaking from his mouth to lap gently at your face in acknowledgement, coating you in thick dino-drool. 
\>The impromptu tongue-bath leaves you flustered, but no less stuck, so you motion for him to clean your lower body as well.
\>He obliges, and you catch him wrinkle his nose, as though your taste were somehow unpleasant to him. He normally doesn’t mind licking you clean when you get sweaty after a workout session, and he even goes out of the way to savor the smell when you get particularly musky, so he should be loving this.
\>Nevertheless, he perseveres.

\>As he works you over, the feeling begins to return to your legs, and you begin wriggling to free yourself; with an audible *crack*, one leg manages to break out of the thick shell encasing it, and it dawns on you exactly why you couldn’t move.
\>You crane your neck to take stock of the situation, and find that it’s about what you expected.
\>You are completely coated from the waist down in what can only be dried semen, literally plastered to your boyfriend’s chest by the force and volume of the previous night’s ejaculation.
\>Everything in the immediate vicinity is dyed off-white, covered in a thick blanket of stale cum: the sheets, the floor, and the both of you as well.
\>You’re glad you have tile floors; no amount of washing could fully get the stains out of a rug
\>You’ve already resigned yourself to smelling like you took a Jacuzzi in your boyfriend’s balls for the rest of the week, but you might as well try to get cleaned up anyway.
\>Thankfully, he seems to have the same idea, scooping up the crusty sheets and dumping them in the washing machine before carrying you into the bathroom, still clutched to his chest.
\>You decide that a shower would probably be for the best; a bath would likely leave you swimming in your own filth as dry cum dissolved into the bathwater.
\>Kinky though it might be under the right conditions, you sincerely doubt either of you are in the mood after last night’s sex marathon.
\>He sets you down in front of him and turns the water as usual, when he reflexively hops back, letting out a very audible *HNNG* as the warm water makes contact with his body

\>He must’ve had it on the setting that he uses to get the tension out after going to the gym, because the water begins pounding his body with enough force to rival the power-washer you use to clean the deck.
\>Evidently, he’s still pretty sensitive after last night, and you can hear his claws scrabble against the tile as the pulse of the warm water rapidly pushes him towards the brink; he desperately tries to find something to hold on to in order to keep his balance (and stave off the impending orgasm), but eventually falls, hitting the floor ass-first with a meaty *slap*.
\>It’s hard to make out what happens next, as the residual momentum of his fall leads him to bowl you over, and all goes dark as you’re trapped beneath his body as the force of the impact shatters his resolve and sends him into another orgasm.
\>You’d normally be able to struggle and kick to get his attention but your body is still sore, so you 
can only explore your fleshy prison by touch, gently probing at the surrounding area for a hint as to where you’ve ended up while you wait for some opportunity to signal him to your location.
\>Your scaly lover is large; you have no doubt there are quite a few places you could hide on his lower body if either of you were so inclined.
\>You realize that the most likely place is that you landed between the firm globes of his buttocks or the small of his back, since he landed on his ass. The air is hot and moist, and your head begins to swim as the scent of fresh cum mingles with his natural odor.
\>However, deprived of your sight, your other senses sharpen. Sure enough, you feel his tail flex as he tries to right himself, propping him up against the shower walls and letting you pop free.

\>You make a desperate push towards the light, treating the drenched porcelain below you like a slip-and-slide as a quarter-ton of scaly ass falls back into place behind you shoots you out.
\> The fallen showerhead pelts you with water, and you fumble with it for a bit, trying to cover your eyes as you turn the showerhead down from “driving rain” to “fine mist”, giving your boyfriend time to recover from the harsh stimulus and actually begin washing himself, not that he really needs it
\>Having taken control of the situation, you turn around to survey your handiwork.
\>His scales have mostly returned to their natural shade of wood brown, with just a few telltale white flecks as an indicator of the previous night’s mischief, though light touches of pink show through where his belly-scales are stretched to their limits.
\>The light playing off the water droplets clinging to him casts little rainbows around the room, drawing your eye to every contour of his well-muscled body as he reclines.
\>His balls are still grossly swollen to the size of beanbags, forcing him to splay his legs as his semen oozes from the valley between them, even while his dick remains soft.
\>The memory of being trapped beneath him sends an erotic shudder through you and you begin to daydream about the future applications of your newfound fondness for extreme face-sitting.
\>Suddenly, the sound of your lover’s voice snaps you out of it, and you meet his eyes with a sheepish grin

\>”How’re you feeling?”, he half-whispers, concern for you overriding the post-orgasmic haze.
\>”I should be asking you that”, you reply flatly.  “I’m not the one who had to endure a half-dozen orgasms without the actual pleasure of release, or had my nuts smacked around like a punching bag until I screamed myself hoarse.”
\>“As I recall, I asked you to do all that, and I was loving every second”, he huffs. “I can deal with a few weeks of walking funny or going without pants, but if something were to happen to you…”
\>”You saw how wild I got once we started getting into it, right? If you had fallen off while I was thrashing around, you’d definitely have gotten squished or suffocated. We’re going to have to look into buying a new mattress, given how badly I clawed up the current one. That could’ve been *you*.”
\>You decide to omit the fact that you almost did suffocate when you were trapped under him earlier, and try to crack a joke to lighten the mood.
\>”Well, it wouldn’t be a bad way to go…”
\>”Anon!”
\>”Doesn’t everyone want to die surrounded by the people they love? It’s just that I’d be *surrounded* a bit more literally than with most others.”
\>He huffs again before ruffling your hair.
\>“If it’s any consolation, you kept your promise. I can’t really tell whether or not they’re swollen from cum or because of the bruising. Probably both.”
\>”There’s only one way to find out.” you interject. “It’s probably for the best that we drain them as much as we can so that they don’t wind up leaking at an inopportune moment.”
\>”After all, we can’t have you trailing cum everywhere for the next few days until your production normalizes again. If you thought that knocking over paperwork with your boner was embarrassing, imagine getting sent home from work for shorting out the computers with your pre.”
\> “Once you’ve done that, we can move on to the aftercare. I’ll wager once the pleasure stops dulling the pain, you’re really going to need it.”
\>”To be honest, I’m not even sure how.” He grumbles “I can tell there’s still a lot in there, but if my previous orgasms are any indication, I can’t really cum with the force that I’m used to. It just kind of dribbles out.”
\>”The other problem being that it’s basically a catch-22. If I try to wait until I can cum with the usual force, I’ll get blue-balled to the point that I leak everywhere and orgasm at the slightest provocation. If I cum, the soreness makes it so that the size decrease from losing cum is basically negligible because indulging my fetish makes me produce more.”
\>”Well, couldn’t we just squeeze it out by hand?” you ask. “I mean, if the cum is leaking out because there’s too much pressure inside, it makes a certain kind of sense that applying more pressure will make more come out. As long as we do it gently enough, it should work…”
\>”Might as well give it a shot. It’s not like we’ve got any better options.”

\>You carefully take position between his legs, warm mist still beading over you, and give your saurian boyfriend’s bloated belly a test-push. His cock almost immediately disgorges a little jet of seed, but does not harden; a slight parting of his slit to accommodate sudden increase in pressure and a sharp intake of breath are the only signs of arousal you can sense, so you decide to go with it.
\>You build up a rhythm of soft squeezes, being sure to work in ample time to relax if the cock before you starts to stiffen. You see slow but steady progress as you gently polish your lover’s family jewels, watching them deflate by millimeters at a time. However, as he teeters on the edge of arousal, the look of concern on your boyfriend’s maw slowly morphs into one of discomfort as the endorphins from his many orgasms start to wear off.  If you don’t find a faster way of draining him, you’re not going to be able to get him to a manageable size before the pain forces him to stop you.
\>Desperate, you wrangle his penis into position, press your lips into the slit and suck as hard as you can, slurping as much of his still-soft cock into your mouth as you’re able like a clam from its shell. A pleasured scrabble of claws on the linoleum heralds the deluge of semen which floods into your mouth, coating your insides in the cloyingly thick goo. 
\>You can feel each gulp of it land heavily in your stomach as you swallow, and you’re already starting to feel full after you repeat the process a second time. By the 5th cycle, your stomach mirrors his- uncomfortably swollen, gurgling angrily from the fluid pressure within. Eventually, the change in your center of gravity gets the better of you, and you start to lose your footing.
\>At this, your lover takes the initiative and sits upright, scooping you up in one hand and cupping you back to his chest. He then reaches down, gives his stomach a final, powerful squeeze, and uses his tail as a counterweight to steady his shaking legs once more as he stands.
\>He sets you down on the bed, careful of your swollen stomach before plopping himself down next to you with a grimace. You let out a cum-scented belch as you try to speak, before turning to him and motioning to the closet instead.
\>”Now what?”
\>“Aftercare.”
\>Gratefully, he pulls the massive pill-bottle from where he had stashed it on the nightstand, and grabs a couple of Advil to ease the swelling- they’re dinosaur sized, of course, a necessity in a mixed species society.
\>After downing the medicine, he pulls you back to bed, eager to end the day as it began- although this time you snuggle paunch-to-paunch. Reaching a hand up to caress one of his cranial ridges, he lets out a raspy chirp and musses your hair with his tongue. Content with the quiet affirmation of love, you drift back to sleep- ready for the next morning together, the next tender punch in the gut, and the next pleasant surprise.
