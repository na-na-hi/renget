##Woofanon's stash of (poorly) written pokemon tf smooth(ie) 

You stumble into a dark mind's collection of weird thoughts, what will you find in? Will your sanity persist, or you will be... 


###Changed? 


Ok no, dramatic intro besides, this is just a bunch of one-off Pokemon TFs i'll write to practice, as you might've noticed by my handle (And the previous dailypost, kudos to /tfg/ if you're not a lurker) i'm mostly interested in canine-like pokemon tfs, but that doesn't mean that i will always write only canine tfs (Primarina tf, maybe m/f?), i will also try to tag all stories as best as i can, but i might (And will) miss a bunch of stuff you may or may not like, so don't beat me please xoxo (Don't worry, no hard stuff like (s)cat or pee)

It was a safe bet, Erick though, just another hit and you were done, all your debts, gone
And yet, the King's face meant that it was over, he busted, he lost all his savings and even more
Outside his studio, they were waiting already, he tried to explain to them how he was going to have their money tomorrow, that he only needed more time
But there was no more time, punching him in the face, he dropped on Darkrai's realm, maybe forever, he thought, but Arceus had other plans for him
When he finally woke up, he was tied up to a chair, the room, besides for a faint glimmer from a dying bulb, was completely summerged on darkness, a small cage just outside the light could be seen
The walls, clearly intended to not been seen by the public, cracked and full of pipes, just barely let the sound of the outside be heard, a mix of a loud voice and the occasional clapping and cheering
It was the end, Erick thought, he was going to be killed there, alone, and no one would be the wiser that he dissapeared
Deep in those dark thoughts, he finally heard a door cracking, and at least three pairs of footsteps coming inside
"Good morning, sleeping beauty, do you know what day is today?" One of the voices ask mockingly
"W-where i am?" Erick asks, pretty sure that they weren't going to answer
"Straight to the point, huh? It doesn't matter, you're not leaving, the boss told us to take you here, you owe us a lot of cash, kid" Still mocking
"I- i need just one more week, i promise! I- can ge-" before he can end, a swipe across his face shuts him up
"Damn gambling adicts, always saying the fucking same! 'Ohh mister, just one more game and i will have *your* money back!" Another swipe
Erick shaked in fear, he was going to die there
"... but the boss has another plans for you, you're lucky, or not, he refuses to tell us what is he going to do with you, just to use this..." he says as he gets closer, you can see a small syringe full of a yellow liquid
"W-what is that!?" You try to squirm but the ropes are too tight 
"We will see pretty soon"
As the needle penetrate his skin, Erick shaked in fear, was it poison? Acic? Drugs? He could only wonder as the cold liquid left a burning trail on his veins, a sense of heaviness almost knocked him out again
"Let's go boys, we're done here, leave him untied"
Erick barely felt the ropes being loosened, his mind was focused on the burning feeling inside him, but another symptom rised as the fire dissapeared
A itching all over his body took over, it was almost unbearable, he wanted to scratch himself but he was still too weak to do so
"H- help" he pledged, trying to stand up, but his legs failed, making him fall face-first against the floor, even the coldness of the moisty concrete wasn't enough
With a lot of effort, Erick finally was able to roll over, the faint light from the bulb was too much for his tired eyes, rising his arm to cover his eyes, but as he did, he noticed that something was wrong
His arm was covered on a fine, white fur, almost covering the entire lenght of his forearm, meanwhile his hand was darkening, almost like a charcoal piece, his fingernails, sharp and large, now were more akin to claws
"H- Help! Please som-" He screamed before his bones started to crack
In great pain, Erick saw as his hand's bones cracked, shrinked and reformed, the rest of his body also darkening and growing a heavy and almost silky fur mane
Not only it was his body that was changing, a burning sentation in his nether parts bothered him, like it was shrinking? But there was also something else bothering his pants, it was like something was trapped on the fabric and wanted to escape
"Wh- frou...!?" His doubts were short-lived as the fabric of his pants finally tore appart, a lush white tail flickered out of the rip, wiggling happily
"Fu... frou..." Even when thinking the words, only a single one could escape his rapidly developing muzzle,Â  a dark canid nose replacing his human nose, his ears quickly growing down, almost to leg-level, not as hard now that he couldn't even stand up, his transformation almost finished
Suddenly, his nose, full of new and better nerves, could sense another presence in the room, but weirdly... it was just like him?
Unable to walk like a quadruped, Erick slowly but surely crawled to the origin of the smell, the cage
"Frou- fur?" Unsure about ehat to expect, he asked as his newly formed paw moves the lockpin keepin the cage closed
The new Furfrou finally identifies the presence, it was a sleeping furfrou, just like him! Way too much like him, almost like a carbon copy, but unlike him, the other furfrou fur was well cared and dyed, his tail fur mostly gone, instead a dyed blue star that was well known for Erick flickered
It was Prince, actual champion of the Pokemon contest on the city, but why it was there? Was the mafia the owner of one of the most famous pokemon in the region?
Suddenly, Prince yawned, stretching on place before opening his eyes to see the new Furfrou in front of him
"Frou?"
Erick wanted to ask too much, but he couldn't even understand Pokemon language, still, he tried to ask where they were
"Frou- Fur?" Instead of answering, Prince started to circle Erick, seeing and sniffing him
Erick was frozen on place, he couldn't move, there was something... almost hypnotizing on the furfrou, almost... exciting
Blushing, Erick knew well what was happening on his rear, a red tip rising outside his new canine groin, excited to be free
"Furfro-" he tried to ask Prince what he was doing, but it was quickly answered as the Furfrou mounted him, his red rod now growing ever faster and harder
"Fro!" Erick pledged, but it was too late, as Prince's rod penetrated his back, stretching it
Prince start moving on a almost methodic pace, not too quick but not too fast, every hump making his hot member go deeper, making Erick pant harder and harder, his member as hard as it could go, his mind blurry as Prince's knot just barely touched him
"Fro! Fur-" Slowly, the humping became faster and faster, almost desperate, Prince burying himself deeper and deeper, Erick panting harder, until suddenly, Prince humped harder, fully penetrating him, his fat knot swelling inside Erick, about to climax too as the first loads of hot white spunk painted his insides
Erick, panting harder than ever, was ready to let go when Prince, still unloading his seed inside him, nibbled his neck, being enough to break the dam
"Frou!" Erick howled as loads of white canine spunk shooted from his member to the floor, some even splashing on his delicate paws, dirtying them, something unnaceptable for a pokemon as beautiful as him
Tired, he finally collapses, his chest fur soaking in his own spunk, panting hard, Prince still inside him, when the door cracked again, this time another voice in a white robe entering the room
"Having fun Prince? You're in in twenty minutes, your toy will stay here"
The excited furfrou wagged his tail with happiness as he started pushing back hard until his knot finally popped free from Erick, leaving a trail of white string as he walked to the man in the robe
"And you, Duke, be ready for your debut, the stylist is coming in a hour for you" He said as the door closed down, Erick still panting on the ground soaked in his own spunk
"Fru..." The man said Duke? But his name was Erick... but Duke was classier than a common name, the Furfrou thought
Duke or Erick, doesn't matter, he thought, he was going to be the best competitor the contest world has ever seen
