- [Story] *[/Advanced: Monster Hunter!/'s Short Greentexts (Part 3)](https://rentry.org/2f8so)* was added

- [Doujin] *[Foam](https://mega.nz/file/n4hCgA7J#St2MgatII2Ze_ZGiUDI2A875RCEgs_wqs7OIZ4AHXAM)* and *[Valse](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u5vbjl7eere7tm4/AACgrFk8vPve9jhE7F-e9KIza?dl=0)* were added

#### *Previously:*

- [Story] *[Two](https://www.sofurry.com/view/1879358) [stories](https://www.sofurry.com/view/1958908/)* by Mahlzeit were added

- [Story] *[/Advanced: Monster Hunter!/'s Short Greentexts (Part 2)](https://rentry.org/sfbf5)* was updated

On December 17, 2020, Pastebin went full retard and nuked most explicit pastes, including [the original Monster Hunter Doujin/Smut Index](http://web.archive.org/web/20200530234448/https://pastebin.com/kHh6uSQu). Later down the line, some pastes were restored. A MEGA backup of most Pastebin stories and doujins can be found in their appropriate sections.

Send all inquiries/corrections/anything to ***explicitmonsterloving@gmail.com*** or if relevant, the (un)common MH porn thread on /trash/, then /scaly/. All non-FurAffinity stories have been backed up, but will continue to use their pastebin link *unless* they get axed. Links will update as needed.

This is by no means all guaranteed to be high quality nor the end-all. For doujinshi it's more of a personal tracking list, and for smut it's more for the above two 4chan generals. Feel free to share this index around.

Thanks to all anonymous who have contributed to this, from mere suggestions to uploading raw scans or digital copies of content they paid for.

Some of these stories are in need of a translation. If someone can translate them in full, then that would be great.

Stories with pretty pictures of monster sex which you read from right to left! These are the only ones [WangKerr](https://pastebin.com/u/Wangkerr) knew of that you can find freely available somewhere at least. Titles are available when possible. Feral unless otherwise stated, and this does not include the numerous doujins of huntresses getting raped since they're incredibly heavy on human focus anyway.
Some (but not all) of the doujins on MEGA [can be found in this folder](https://mega.nz/#F!fcB1TSxD!6Zkd4-dKgozG_h5hEu0I5w). Otherwise, all doujins here will have their own links at least, as with any passwords if around.
A good chunk of the doujins are in dire need of translation, even for blurbs. Typesetting can always be done by others.
