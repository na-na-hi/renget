	@Nick are there any Nick/Amelia secret lore?
!!!info nick
	- @linoone Nick and Amelia are originally from a different creative writing project which is absolutely impossible to find online at this point. The characters changed significantly from there, though - they're really only similar 'in name only'.
	- More interestingly, I suppose, earlier drafts of Amelia were significantly more paranoid/slow-to-trust (which makes a certain amount of sense given one or two things in her still-unrevealed-mostly-because-I-haven't-gotten-around-to-writing-anything--for-at-least-eight-months backstory)
	- One of my draft ideas for the Amp Plains was vaguely (extremely so) mongol-inspired with nomadic civilizations due to constantly-shifting mystery dungeons and a now-ancient-history completely-collapsed empire, but that's still vague-canon.
	- Not sure I remember anything from earlier drafts of Nick at the moment. 
	- Current iteration Nick was illiterate with regards to the native language when he arrived (but that's not really secret; I think I've said things about it). One of my ideas involved the two of them finding/tracking down a phrasebook/dictionary/translation manual written by a previous human in order to help overcome that.
	- I was also thinking of going into how the ability Flash Fire works (except I misread it, so I'm not sure if it's canon that it works oddly, or if I should just scrap that idea).
