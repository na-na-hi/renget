#A Clown Hero's Variety Hour

####I. Popsy's Apartment

Clown cars are just weird.

From the outside, it looked like Popsy’s red compact car - dubbed the Popsymobile - wouldn't fit three boxes, but after pushing in the 7th box of merchandise, there was still plenty of room for him and the girls to get nice and cozy. Was it bigger inside? Shrugging, Inigo called on Gigan to lift him back up to the apartment through the third story balcony. He could hear the lively chatter coming from Popsy's. He smiled. Sally complained loudly about Hoge buying a larger Japanese flag to compete against the American flag she had put up three days prior.

"I should buy a Swiss flag to remain neutral," he mused. Gigan just shrugged. It was one of the few things Inigo remembered about his mother. That she had come from a country he's never visited. Abandoning home and family to have him and his brothers in an arranged quirk marriage. She must've been lonely. Is that why she left?

Shaking his head, he focused on his smile through Gigan's mirror instead. Even in his clown costume he was ridiculously hot. He winked and bit his lip, shot himself a finger gun, and slowed his ascent enough to check out his new clown costume. It was a little too open for the cold November morning. He might need more insulation for the boys. He and Hoge's future children were relying on him. He had chosen a white and green number with hearts and polka dots. It matched his Ryukishi costume, and he had designed it with the help of the /P0psy/ image board online.

Of course, his online bros didn’t believe him when he announced his Popsy internship until he posted some 'undeniable proof'. ==RubyRed3821 !ZRKojmMXJs== had just about died of jealousy and begged him to get Popsy to do a Q&A. Inigo said he’d think about it. In the first week, Popsy had already given him a 20 questions per day limit. He grinned widely - out of all the Popsy superfans - he felt like a king! Still.. some of the anonymous requests had gotten pretty weird. And it was a blue board so Inigo had to be discreet. He was also careful not to reveal any information about himself and the others. They didn't want any stalkers. It was greedy but Inigo wanted to keep Popsy all to himself. The other students, except maybe Yui, didn't know just how lucky they were.

He rubbed his aching arm muscle. When he glanced back on the utter madness of their first internship weeks, he had to admit the unorthodox clown training had paid off...

That first week Popsy focused strictly on clowning foundations - juggling, pie throwing, balancing acts, applying face make-up and other comedic skills. Hoge had swiftly calculated optimal makeup times for the team. In case of an emergency, they could switch in and out of their costumes in under five minutes. Yui had excelled on slapstick physical stunts while Sally somehow mastered maneuvering on a tiny unicycle. Chihiro was hilarious with her dry and flat comedy. Inigo himself was an ace at throwing pies.

By week's end, their clowning skills had met the requirements to get their clown eggs painted at a museum. For Inigo, it was a dream come true!

The second week quickly intensified as Popsy focused on honing battle training.

***
"Step right up, baby heroes! Got a real treat for y'all today!" Popsy trumpeted, sweeping an arm dramatically toward the warehouse doors where they had their first lesson. As the doors opened, they saw that the ill-arranged carnival rides had been transformed into some sort of obstacle course. 

Oblivious to her squad's horror, Popsy merrily gestured them inside her chaotic warehouse kingdom. "Kiddos, say howdy to my ol' classmate and drinking buddy - Rika Eichi!"From behind a mound of metal poles and tarp floated up a slim hover platform. Standing calmly atop it was a dour dark-haired woman in an oil-stained tank top with a robot sheep design. She gave them a cursory inspection before turning back to the sparking circuitry in her hands.

"Yo," Rika muttered. More pops and fizzes erupted from her tools.

Inigo leaned over to Hoge excitedly. "Whoa! We’re really going in there!" Before Hoge could speak her distaste, Popsy bounced up, throwing an affectionate arm over the woman mechanic's shoulder.

"You betcha! Ain't nobody who can rig up an obstacle course faster!" Popsy proclaimed brightly. "Here, she's got robots and traps cobbled together tougher than my Aunt Fanny's five alarm fruitcake! It’s finished, right?"

"I'll get it done, quit fussing," Rika sighed gruffly. "Just make sure your trainees sign their organ donor cards first. I take no liability if they lose a limb."

Inigo laughed. “Eh, she’s playin'? I’m hyped but that doesn’t sound great."

Popsy loudly sucked helium from a balloon animal. "Yep, she's messin' around! Ain't my girl the bee's knees? Trust me. This is how my papa taught me. Now who wants fun-size candy bars?" She passed the waivers around absently. "Just some boring paperwork, don't sweat it none!"

Kaga signed the papers quickly. “I shall embrace the challenge - and the candy bar.”

Yui frowned. "Uh yeah hard pass on signing my guts away to science."

Sally squinted at the organ waiver suspiciously "No, thanks."

Chihiro stepped over broken glass delicately. "I trust you, sensei-" She was about to sign before Hoge stopped her. Hoge pushed up her glasses, scrutinizing. "You’ve lost your last connection to reality, you insane hag! We’re not going in there without a safety inspection."

“Go right ahead,“ Rika replied. “But you won’t get new equipment if you don’t finish the obstacle course.”

“-And remember, to keep a smile on your face the entire time! A happy hero saves twice as many!" Popsy cheered.
***
Inigo chuckled to himself in remembrance. Gigan shivered.

What followed was utter madness - they had scrambled desperately over collapsing mazes, wobbling poles and malicious trampolines actively catapulting victims skyward towards slime-filled dunk pools. Hoge had wondered if this qualified as a hero student bootcamp or unconstitutional torture… despite the fact that she had it easier than the others. The machines simply couldn’t detect her.

Squinted under thrown cream pies, Inigo had glimpsed Yui cursing wildly, crimson threads barely saving her from toppling off a  balance beam. Sally tried blasting her way clear of a set of hug-bears controlled by Rika. Chihiro looked frazzled, evading endless barrages of crazy strings from a demented pitching machine. Its volley nearly toppled her before Kaga smashed it furiously with a flying kick. The entire time they dodged projectiles thrown by Popsy herself. 

But oddly...it was kinda fun. Even Hoge sported a smile by the end of it as she launched projectiles back at Popsy. 

Over the next few days a method emerged from Popsy's madness. She was conditioning them to expect the unexpected - embracing unpredictability and out-maneuvering adversaries. The key she stressed? Learning to swiftly predict opponents through minimal cues.

"Villains get real irked when ya turn their own tricks against 'em!" Popsy remarked with a sage nod. "Take 'em off guard and you control the fight!"

She honed their reflexes relentlessly. Students soon dodged surprise pendulums and pitfalls adeptly, reacting to subtle visual or auditory tells signaling one wacky trap after the other. And at the end of it, they had a water-gun fight with Popsy and Rika while riding mini-tanks. That was just for fun and some kind of game show reference.

Still, they had survived week two...yet the fun wasn't over. The next step to their training, Popsy announced, was to visit her family's home at Osaka. He couldn't wait!

Inigo grinned as he stepped through Popsy's balcony and opened the sliding door. He fell into the familiar chaos.
<INIGO, she's gone INSANE!>
<Ini, use Gigan to apprehend Sally. I'm arresting her.>
<Huh? What for?>
<For child-endangerment.>
<We're all kids here!>
<I'm not. Ya'll seen Popsy's mouthwash?>
<I did what you said and threw away all alcohol, sensei.>
<Not the mouthwash!>
<Belay the arrest order. The neighbors reported us for being loud again.>
<It's Myoga's fault!>
<Hey! What'd I do?>
<Sensei, my 100 laps is complete for the day.>
<Do another hundred!>
<Hai!>
<*Meow*>
<Did Yui's bag just meow?>
<Uh- no. That was me. You got a problem with it?>

####II. A Phone Call
>>**Popsy**: Hey there, old man! How's Tricks?
>>**Strong Man**: Good good. Is good to hear from you again. What can I do for clown princess today?
>>**Popsy**: I've been itching to bring my kids down to Osaka like we talked about.
>>**Strong Man**: Ha! I tell the others, we get big top ready for Popsy's proteges.
>>**Popsy**: Aw thanks big guy! So what's our damage here? I'll wire over the cash.
>>**Strong Man**: No no. Is free! For all time's sake. Your father will haunt me if I take your money.
>>**Popsy**: Now don't give me that nonsense. I want to pay! And if Pa comes by, the more the merrier.
>>**Strong Man**: HA HA HA. Let's see...flight for seven people, circus rental, rooms at inn...comes to 2 million yen, give or take ruble.
>>**Popsy**: TWO MILLION?! <*loud bicycle horn honk*> You're killing me here!
>>**Strong Man**: Cost of doing business. Azir, he comes from Brazil. In return, we do our the best.
>>**Popsy, sighing**: Alright, it's a deal. I know it'll be worth it.
>>**Strong Man**: And how is Popsy doing, eh? Back to old self?
>>**Popsy**, *glancing behind her at the kids watching wrestling*: I'm doing better actually. Haven't felt this good in a long while. Feels nice to be useful again, y'know?
>(Inigo, sniffing: I can't believe Captain Insano betrayed Komatsu for Foreign Man)
>(Hoge: I don't get it... There are better weapons than chairs.)
>>**Strong Man**: You have warmed my heart! I look forward to meeting the little jesters. About money, are you sure I cannot help. I am ex-Russian #1 Hero. I still have endorsement deals.
>>**Popsy**, *she looks down at a flyer for something called 'Moth-A-Palooza'*: Oh don't ya worry, I got an idea.  Leave it to me, chief!
>>**Strong Man**: Good good. Is that all you need?
>>**Popsy**: Yeah uh- there's one more thing. I just...I wanted to say thanks, y'know. For everything.
>>**Popsy**: Stuff with my Pa and the circus and just...being there for a messed up kid even when I pushed ya away...
>>**Popsy**: Still there?
 >>**Strong Man**: Yes, I am still here.
>>**Popsy**: All those years I was adrift...the damn media on my tail..then being a hero lost all meaning after Pa...
 >>**Strong Man**: Little Poproshka, you know we only wished to help heavy heart—"
>>**Popsy**: But that was the problem right? I was too buried under garbage to realize what I had.. Or who I had...Pa deserved better last days than a runaway who barely visited or called enough...
>>**Popsy**: <*sniff*> I didn't even speak at his funeral, can you believe that? What kind of terrible daughter...
>>**Strong Man**: You judge too harshly. Your father adored his talented spitfire. But he struggled showing softness. 
>>**Strong Man**: He pushed you hard because he knew you could do more. Why bother with relentless drills and pushing young Poppy-shka so fiercely to get in Shiketsu, eh? He was proud of you.
>>**Popsy**, *sniffing*: Yeah that sounds like the old man alright...Shucks.. I better go, I'm running out of hankerchiefs over here.
>>**Strong Man**: Only five meters?
>>**Popsy**: twenty... but I used the rest earlier.
>>**Strong Man**: Ha ha ha. See you soon Akagi-chan.
>>**Popsy**: Later chief....


Inigo peeked into Popsy's room to find their teacher sniffling into an endless handkerchief. Concern flooded him as he entered. "Uh, sensei? You okay? I got more tissues if ya need 'em."

Popsy jerked up hastily scrubbing her face. "Who me? Nah, just got somethin' in my eyes is all..." She attempted an unconvincing grin. "Darn glitter bombs, am I right?"

Sally and Yui shuffled inside, followed by Chihiro and Kaga. "What happened?? Who's butt we gotta kick??" Yui yelled.

“We’re here for you, sensei.” Sally said. 

“I darn opened up the floodgates over here,” Popsy waved off their worried expressions even as fresh tears spilled over.


Unsure what else to do, Inigo hollered. "Guys, group hug time! Sensei needs some love!" The interns surrounded Popsy.

“Must we coddle this grown woman? This is embarrassing.”  Hoge hovered by the door uncertainty, until Inigo took her hand which she grumpily accepted.
“All this talk about Osaka….Suddenly makes me miss my Pa, something fierce...I-I’ll be okay in a minute..” Popsy muttered as her students wrapped her in a warm hug. 

“Then we got a minute to spare for our great sensei,” Chihiro said.
"Y-ya'll really think I'm a good mentor?" Popsy whispered, eyes still misty as she glanced around at the circle of students embracing her.

"Heck yeah!" Yui cheered, flopping down to hug Popsy tighter. 

Sally nodded awkwardly. "We're lucky you picked us."

Even Hoge managed a subtle yet sincere smile, gingerly patting Popsy's shoulder. "I’ll admit your lessons have been surprisingly effective."

Kaga crossed both arms, expression intense as always. "The mighty oak grew from a sprouting acorn. We’ll strive to honor your tutelage, sensei."

And Inigo just beamed brighter, keeping one supportive arm wrapped around Popsy and one around a subtly blushing Hoge. "We got the world's best mentor and the world's best team! Team Popsy rocks!"

A chorus of cheering agreement answered that bold declaration. And enveloped in such unconditional support, Popsy felt lighter. Whatever storms their future held, their little clown family would weather it together.

###III. Mobile Kaiju Observation Lab

Inigo, Hifumi, and Chris look up at the Mobile Kaiju Observation Lab. It was an impressive tower-like structure that’s able to slowly fly from one country to another. The mobile command center housed multiple scientists dedicated to studying kaijus or giant quirk monsters that roamed the world. Today, MKOL was assigned to watch the two kaiju moths that were in Kyoto. All three boys were excited, because hero students were given a pass to tour the center!

They strode down the hallway, their eyes wide with wonder at the sleek, futuristic architecture that surrounded them.

"Whoa, this place is decked out!" Inigo exclaimed.

Hifumi nodded in agreement. "Yeah, it's slick."

 "This whole thing can fly," Christopher mused.

Inigo grinned. "You know what else is cool? The juggling tricks I've learned from Popsy! How's the sword dojo goin' by the way?"

 "I've been getting better at Kenjutsu. Ryusei's suprisingly good at teaching," Christopher answered.

Inigo chuckled. "He should've grabbed more than one intern then. Is he using you as practice? Popsy has six!" he boasted, flashing a grin at his friends.

Hifumi laughed, a hotheaded spark gleaming in his eyes. "Impakt has been showing us some Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves. It's intense, but I'm loving every minute of it."

"Guess, Popsy's style is more like clown-jutsu, huh?"

Hifumi paused. "Hey Chris, did he tell ya how to do an Iaijutsu Strike yet?"

Christopher furrowed his brow. "Uh, what's that?"

Inigo's grin widened mischievously. "It's from that samurai movie we watched! It's a super move!"

"Show him, bro!"

With a flourish, Inigo transformed Gigan into a katana and executed a dramatic slash. However, his theatrics caused him to stumble and collide with a nearby machine.

"Careful with the equipment, please.." a passing lab tech scolded.

"Sorry about that!" Inigo apologized, chuckling  as Hifumi and Christopher burst into laughter.

“Thanks for your help with the presentation, boys.” Dr. Serizawa, MKOL's resident kaiju expert said - he was a tall man with wispy brown hair and an unassuming bespectacled face. The three boys carried large boxes of equipment behind him. 

“Nothing’s interesting happened in a while so this moth visit caught us off guard,” Dr. Serizawa said evenly.

“Really? Thought you’d be dealing with giant monsters all the time,” Hifumi asked.

“Well- a majority of them are in the ocean or stay away from people. It’s unlike them to visit a major population zone like this,” Serizawa droned.

“Wasn’t there a giant enemy crab two months back in Alaska?” Chris remembered.

 “Yes.. I would’ve loved to see it. But MKOL is specifically for East Asia. There are other mobile bases across the world. All sharing data. Ours is specifically MKOL #3. We’re mostly stuck with the boring jobs, but now we get the see the wonders of two moth kaijus meeting each other,” Serizawa smiled.

“Christmas is next month, doc. You got a special person you’re interested in? A moth to your flame?”

“Huh?” This caught Serizawa, off guard. “N-no. Not exactly.”

“Too bad.” Inigo grinned. “Life’s more interesting when you’re in-love.” He looked at one of the hallway monitors which showed new footage of the two kaiju moths in the park and their nest. He could see Hoge, Popsy, and Sally helping feed the moths. Various hero agencies have been scheduled to assist in kaiju moth duty, and they were in rotation.

“If only... But I’m married to my work, mind you! Besides- I don’t believe she-”

“There you are!” said a bright eyed young woman in a lab coat. “Everyone’s waiting, come on.” Dr. Serizawa has frozen up blushing.  “Huh? What’s wrong with him?”

The three boys just looked at each other and burst out laughing. Looks like it wasn’t just the two kaiju moths who needed help.

"B-boys, this is Dr. Daisen Biki. She's the second-in-command here in MKOL." Dr. Serizawa introduced his collegue. 

"You seem familiar," Christopher blinked.

Biki smiled, adjusting her glasses. "You know I get that a lot, but no time to explain- we have a presentation!"

“Alright! Where do you want these boxes?” Hifumi asked.

***

The three boys found themselves among a group of hero students, their attention drawn to Dr. Serizawa and Dr. Daisen's presentation on the MKOL and the Kaiju Watch Network. The room was illuminated by the glow of a giant screen displaying an expansive map of the world, dotted with markers representing the major kaijus under observation. As the presenters explained, there were currently 39 known major kaijus under watch, with the two giant moths in the park set to become numbers 40 and 41.

They explained that quirk animals were already rare, but kaijus also develop powerful mutations attached to their quirk which grants gigantism as well as numerous other enhancements. One slow moving unkillable snail in North America had an IQ of over 300! Meanwhile a constantly shape-shifting aquatic blob had memorized maritime routes worldwide, utilizing currents for rapid transit. 

Dr. Serizawa explained the international hero team "Stormkeepers" existed to intervene for any major kaiju attacks, like the crab incident in Alaska a few months ago. Dr. Daisen then adjusted her mic. "Esteemed guests, now we'll show you the latest updates on the Kaiju Watch Network's early warning system..."

As the presentation continued, a massive holographic world map sprang to life overhead showing all recorded kaiju migrations and incident sites to date. Inigo was surprised to realize just how many massive quirk-enhanced beasts were actively roaming about.  The presentation soon covered crisis response protocols should calamity strike.

Dr. Serizawa then announced a special treat: the appearance of the #2 pro-hero, Saurus, to share his experiences fighting kaijus.

The room rumbled with excitement as Saurus took the stage, his voice booming loudly. 
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME TELL YA ABOUT THE TIME I WENT TOE-TO-TOE WITH A KAIJU MONSTER SHARK OFF THE COAST OF ISHIGAKI! OH YEAH, BROTHER! THERE I WAS, IN THE DEEP BLUE, FACE-TO-FACE WITH THIS BEHEMOTH OF A FISH, AND LET ME TELL YA, I SHOWED IT WHO THE REAL APEX PREDATOR IS! I GRABBED THE SHARK BY THE GILLS, AND I SAID, 'YOU WANNA DANCE, FISHY? WELL, YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT RING CUZ I'M THE UNDISPUTED KING OF ALL REPTILES! AND YOU BETTER STAY IN THE WATER-' 

Inigo hung onto every outrageous detail, utterly enthralled! He had to nudge Christopher several times so he wouldn't miss the play-by-play smackdown! Though oddly enough one particular student group seemed focused on their own loud commentary...

Inigo spotted a guy in a red bodysuit with two red tendrils poking out of his head, talking loudly to a group of mutant kids. Inigo recognized Richard from class 1-E and nodded to him. 

“-how about that abominable kaiju in the Alps?” Richard stated.
“You mean Bigfoot?” A boy wearing a metal helm said or was that his face?
A cube(?) blinked and beeped.
A white-furred ball popped up behind them. “No, we don’t live in the Alps. We live in the- uh-”
The group turned to stare at her which seemed to fluster the yeti-looking girl. She balled backup and rolled away quickly. 
“Whatever. There’s a kaiju-conda in the Amazons. That I’d love to sssssee.” A girl with a black face mask stated.
The guy in a red bodysuit, his name tag saying "Rob", climbed up one of the lab's columns. “Hey, guess who I am? Huh!? I’m Kongre! That Kaiju gorilla in the US! I hear he likes blondes! SWIUUUM! Fear my might tiny helicopters!” He pounded his chest, which squirted some sort of pink goo from his costume.

Inigo nudged Chris, laughing, “Yo check it out, why don’t you copy that quirk!”

Chris shook his head. “Nah, no thanks.”

Rob seemed to have heard them. “Hey! Why not huh? Too good for you?”

“It’s mutant so I don’t even think-” Chris shrugged.

Inigo held up a finger. “Bro, nipple powers are awesome. Check it out!” Gigan sighed and transformed into a dragon with a burly chest which shot off spikes.

“Whoa!” Rob started. 
Inigo grinned. “Dude, can you do like a nipple rocket?”
“No… I haven’t tried.”
“It’s sweet! The best weapon in the game!”
“What game?” 
“It’s from his dumb maid-mech... in Mecha Core 12. Don’t entertain him,” Chris interjected.
“I'll try! Gonna need a container,” The red bodysuit guy pondered.
“Boob rockets and boob lasers is the way of the mecha future, dude!”

“Ehem..” Dr. Daisen said, shooting them a look. Were they being too loud?  “Please, follow us to the next area - for a demonstration on kaiju evacuations protocols,” she said. 

The group of students walked off to follow and Inigo found himself lagging behind. They spotted Shinkan and Kaylee chatting it up Saurus. As the pro-hero left to answer a phone call, Chris, Hifumi and Inigo siddled closer.

“Yo Kaylee! Shinkan! How’s life at Osaka?” Hifumi called out.

“Hey guys,” Kaylee nodded.

“It’s chugging along! Saurus agency runs at peak efficiency!” Shinkan chuckled, steam rising from the top of his head.

“We missed you guys in Kyoto,” Chris stated. 

“Yeah! You do any fun patrols?” Inigo asked.

“We ran into this vigilante guy. Bright-whatever,” Kaylee said with a furrow.

“YEAH! He was speedster! Faster than a bullet train,” Shinkan announced. “Kaylee tried to race him.”

“I was trying to arrest him - which I did,” Kaylee said defensively.

“After he ran into a truck full of tar,” Shinkan laughed.

“I won, didn’t I?” Kaylee growled.

“Same ole’ Kaylee,” Hifumi grinned. “By the way, those mutant kids had Saurus badges. Are they with you?”

Kaylee shook her head. “I don’t know them. But they’re part of Saurus’ ROAR charity program. They’re mutants - endorsed to transfer over to Shiketsu.”

“Huh? Seems like a fun bunch,” Inigo said, turning to see the group of hero students crowding around a make-shift model of Kyoto. One kid had started eating one of the mounds meant to be a hill.

###IV. Moth-a-Palooza

***
"Step right up folks, get yer limited edition Kaiju Kisses Moth plush here!" Popsy hollered to the bustling crowd as she balanced on a large colorful ball. "Cuddle up with your own cuddle bug tonight!"

All around Valiant Park, booths and attractions had popped up overnight paying homage to the giant moth duo known as "Orihime" and "Hikoboshi" to the enthralled locals. Dubbed 'Mothapalooza' by the media, colorful stalls and banners now populated the surrounding area as civilians flocked into Kyoto. The moth merchandise and food booths proving highly popular, there was even a moth TCG game being made. Popsy and her internships had been one of a few hero agencies willing to help with the incident. It was mostly patrol work and dealing with the occassional troublemaker. Still, with two monstrous moths nesting in the park it was good to have heroes around.

Inigo watched as a group wearing custom moth wing capes floated by on hoverboards. Nearby, Sally grudgingly handed balloon animals to eager children. And Hoge scrutinized readout charts detailing the moth duo's pheromone output. Yui sauntered over twirling her strings for the crowd, trailed by a cranky looking Fightman loaded down with plushies and t-shirts.

"This moth junk's selling like crazy! We almost have enough for our trip to Osaka!" Yui exclaimed. "We made a killing over at the merch stand. Fightman was real popular with the schoolgirls."

 Kaga scowled, looking distinctly ruffled. "They kept taking pictures of me. But as sensei stated, I will persist despite the ridicule." Unlike the others who were in clown costumes, Popsy had talked him into dressing up as a furry brown moth, antennas bobbing atop his head.

Inigo chuckled. "Looking good Fight man!" Kaga just sighed and stomped off to stand by Chihiro, who was transfixed, watching a stall filled with dancers demonstrating an ancient moth dance ritual to oohing civilians. The crowd suddenly gasped as the giant female Orihime fluttered serenely above them like a fuzzy guardian angel. 
***
***

Chainzo squinted, the sunlight was piercing and overwhelming after a lifetime under the surface. "It's so bright up here!" He turned towards Alcher, grateful when the large battle-scarred leader passed him a moth-sicle from a stall. 

!!! info Villain Name:「Chainzo」
	Quirk:「Chain Snare」
	His strong chain-like hair and fingers can extend and wrap around targets. His chains have the isoteric effect of negating flight and special forms of travel such as teleportation and intangibility. 

	Type: Mutant/Emitter

Amongst the bustling park, Chainzo, a lanky, awkward teenager, stood out with his gray chain-like hair cascading down his back. He clinked the metal extensions on his fingertips. As he glanced around at the other teenagers passing by, he couldn't help but feel a pang of inadequacy. Their styles were so different from what he was used to below the surface. Chainzo couldn't help but envy them. After his chain quirk had hurt one of his classmates, the authorities had branded him a juvenile deliquent. They treated him like he was dangerous, and his deadbeat father wanted nothing to do with him. So Chainzo ran and found his way to Tor Maju. His crew was his family now.





"Don't stare at the sun, kid," Alcher's voice rumbled.

!!! info Villain Name:「Alcher」
	Quirk:「Berserker Fumes」
	He creates toxic clouds that induce blind rage and fearlessness. Extended exposure to the toxin can cause heart attacks.

	Type: Emitter


"I'm not!" Chainzo watched Alcher scan the blustling park. Their window was tight. Failing to deliver the  eggs to their new benefactor, Frog King, meant kissing any chance of the reward goodbye for their poverty-stricken team. 

"The air up here doesn't taste like anything," Chainzo muttered. Smeckter, their long-limbed tech expert, snorted. "That's called fresh air, choomba. Better get used to it if you wanna survive topside."

The rest of the crew laughed.

"Whatever!" Chainzo growled, his attention turned to a pamphlet handed out by a passing kid in a red bodysuit. "Hey Alcher, this Saurus guy's got a scholarship program for mutants..."

"No shit? Looks like you fit the criteria, kid," Alcher's face twisted into a supportive grin. "Hell, you could be the first one of us to get to a fancy academy." 

Chainzo lowered his head, the metal chains in his hair clinking. "Nah, I could never leave the crew... What would I even do in 1-F or whatever." He gazed at the glossy images of uniformed students in the brochure. He felt a spark of something unfamiliar inside him. Hope?

"Kid. If you find a better life, you take it. We'll throw a rager in your honor." The others echoed his encouragement.

"Heh. Thanks, old man."

Door-Guy's voice cut through the moment. "Head's up! They're switching the nest guards! Let's roll!" The team moved swiftly, following a group of three pro-heroes toward the moth enclosure. Chainzo tucked the pamphlet securely into his pocket.

It was late in the afternoon, Inigo and Hoge stopped to entertain a group of visitors with their newly learned clown tricks. The impromptu street performance was the best part of clown patrol!

"Voila!" Inigo yelled, as Gigan emerged from his palm in a burst of verdant sparkles. The construct hovered at face level - a vibrant moth sculpted with glittering rainbow wings. It grew in size and then burst into a swarm of multicolored mothlings before reforming once more. Oohs and ahhs erupted from the gathered children. Gigan was, of course, hamming it up. Many tiny hands reached to pat the moth dragon. 

Leaving Gigan to entertain the children, Inigo sidled closer toward Hoge who had just finished performing magic tricks. From all the clown training Popsy's taught them, she naturally excelled at misdirection and card tricks, while Inigo settled for flashy lights and colors.

"Coru-chan! Bet'cha your tricks can't outdo my rainbow moth," Inigo teased with a wink and a fingergun. Behind him Gigan continued leading mini admirers on a merry weaving chase.

Hoge huffed. "Perhaps if one judges solely by decibel levels..." She raised one eyebrow Inigo's way. "Quality over quantity."

"Ouch!" He grinned. "It's not my fault, I learn Popsy's coin trick!"

Hoge reached behind his ear and pulled out a 100 yen coin. "This one?"

"Yes!" He blinked. "How many coins are in there? You wanna share a moth-sicle?" 

As Gigan led the visitors away, Inigo circled an affectionate arm around Hoge's waist, but before he could say more a sudden blaring siren shattered the festive atmosphere. They whirled, instantly on alert. Their gaze shot to the giant moths’ nesting area cordoned off in the middle of the park. Villains! That was the emergency warning signal!

They quickly dove into an old timey phone booth and switched into their hero costumes. A minute later, Inigo was stooping to allow Hoge onto his back, armor clicking neatly into familiar wings around them both. She wrapped both arms securely about his neck as Gigan's powerful wings shot them upward. Mid-flight, Inigo's knight armor grew incorporating his construct into a seamless combat extension of himself.

"The others are on their way," Hoge said, phone-in-hand.
"What kind of crazies infiltrates a kaiju nest!" Inigo growled, pushing them forward.
"Confident ones. Be careful," Hoge's voice echoed as her quirk flared.

They spotted the giant moths in a clearing below. But rather than protecting their nest, the creatures were smashing trees and structures indiscriminately. The armored truck and uniformed bodies slumped nearby explained why - the pro heroes on duty had been ambushed. Touching down, they barely avoided a chunk of concrete flung by the rampaging male moth’s violent tantrum. "Whoever did this struck fast. They got the guards!" Inigo shouted over the din.

"Inigo! There's poison vapor lingering here. We need to get them out," Hoge warned, gesturing urgently. His eyes followed her indication and sure enough, wispy fumes wafted up from various scattered puddles. Thinking swiftly, he expanded his armor around them. An air filter tube for safe breathing shot thirty-meters away from them.

They quickly set to work dragging the three heroes from the contaminated scene. Just as he carefully extracted the last one, an urgent buzzing filled their ears. Inigo turned to glimpse a swarm of tiny fly-shaped drones descending rapidly amidst the chaos.

"Greetings hero students - I am the pro hero, Compound," a buzzing confident voice crackled loudly from the lead fly-bot. "Apologies for the abrupt entrance, but surveillance indicates the egg clutch has been stolen. This, along with a hastily applied chemical quirk are causing the kaijus to rampage."

Inigo and Hoge exchanged looks. He whirled to glimpse Hikoboshi running to the festive booths, while the female moth, Orihime, was attacking the scientists nearby. Four scientists inside a van was clinging for their life. Inigo made a run for it.

"I do not have enough drones in the area for combat, but I shall provide support," Compound's voice rang as his drones led the way towards Orihime. The gigantic creature was snarling as its sharp mandibles tore into the armored van, shredding metal like paper. Inside, the scientists screamed and scrambled to escape.

"We gotta draw its attention before someone gets hurt!" Inigo yelled. His wings expanded, Hoge clung tightly to his back, her slight form melding perfectly against him. "Compound, get those civilians clear, we'll handle the moth," Hoge called to the hero's swarm of fly-shaped drones buzzing nearby.

"Acknowledged, good luck!" came the buzzing reply. The mini bots swooped efficiently towards the battered van, tiny robotic arms reaching to pull trapped passengers free.

Inigo and Hoge shot skyward, rapidly closing distance to the rampaging moth. Inigo formed a giant soccer ball by his foot and kicked it towards the Orihime. The twenty-foot tall monster turned.

"Got any tricks that can distract Kaiju-zilla?" Inigo asked over the roaring gusts.

Hoge's eyes narrowed, scanning the area swiftly. "Head towards those flowering trees, I have an idea!" she directed. Inigo banked sharply, angling them toward the copse of cherry blossoms.

As they darted low over the trees, Hoge stretched out one hand and grabbed a branch. "Keep going!" She shouted, as she let go of Inigo and swung herself into a crouch position on the tree's limb. Inigo nodded before her quirk caused her to vanish.

"Any chance I can talk you into calming down for me?" Inigo asked out as he met the moth's charge. He doubled his armor just in case. How hard can a kaiju moth hit?

Orihime’s scythe-like limb smashed down, Inigo caught the blow, boots skidding back through torn earth. His first layer of armor shattered. Okay. That was worth at least two Envigors or maybe.. three Maddox. He gritted his teeth, he formed gigantic gauntlets and grappled fiercely with Orihime's foremost scythe-tipped limb. He strained wildly, but still skidded cleanly through solid turf faster than a swinging wrecking ball.

Behind him civilians fled as the titanic creatures' rampage bashed maintenance vehicles left and right on their deadly slide. Somehow he managed to dig armored heels in, violently arresting their terrifying slide mere yards from a group of picknickers. KRRSSSSSHHHH 

An explosive blow bashed Inigo sideways clean through three small trees, stars bursting across his vision. As they grappled he could feel Gigan reacting the same way he did during the Popsy challenge. Green tentacles and spikes surged forth, wrapped around the moth, multiplying endlessly. Shit! He's already lost control of his quirk. At this rate, all he could do is cling on and hold Gigan back.

Another scythe-like blow crunched into his damaged armor. Dazed, he desperately looked around for Hoge. Please let her brilliant brain have thought up a moth-taming plan already! Cause he was seriously running low on ideas here!

Eyes darting, Inigo quickly spotted a wispy shadow openly sprinting right toward the furiously thrashing Orihime. She was climbing the moth! His heart jammed into overdrive. Was she nuts?! No way could he shield Hoge all the way over there! Clenching his jaw, Inigo let his quirk flare - ready to defend his reckless beloved to his last labored breath if necessary!

"ALRIGHT, GIGAN?! YOU WANNA GO ALL OUT? LET'S GO! 100% PERCENT FULL CLOWNING: KAIJU STYLE!"

With guttural roar Inigo surrendered all control, letting Gigan's power explode outwards unchecked. Howling in unison, hero and construct flared with explosive emerald light! Armor plates cracked violently open, green crystalline flesh erupting rapidly. Gigan's armored form erupted outward, scales rapidly encasing Inigo until an utterly enormous reptilian beast stomped the earth where he'd stood.

For several stunned moments, the giant moth actually paused, antennae twitching warily as she reassessed this unexpected challenger. Inigo relished the sudden extra height seeing eye-to-eye with his mammoth opponent. 

"Alright, now we can wrestle?" Inigo crowed, his voice thundering from Gigan's scaly maw. The words emerged oddly warped. He threw himself forward just as Orihime screeched indignantly and copied the motion.

Two titans crashed together, the very earth buckling violently under the new seismic event! The two kaijus grappled. Orihime shot a beam of energy into Gigan, and Gigan retaliated by picking up a nearby oyster-stickered car and lobbing it at the giant moth. Evenly matched the warring behemoths grappled and slammed against park structures,

Somewhere deep in Gigan's core, Inigo clung on. He couldn’t control Gigan, but he was mentally chanting 'Protect Hoge. Protect the City.' through the haze of fury flooding his dominant senses. Exhaustion filled him, he wasn't sure how long he could keep this form up, but he had to keep going to buy time.

Hoge dangled limply, breathless sobs mixing with slightly hysterical laughter. She pulled herself up and continued her climb. Perched atop Orihime's fuzzy shoulders, the wind tore at her but she scarcely noticed, gaze unwaveringly fixed on her target. She had tested to see if Orihime detected her through Wasuremono and for all accounts she was invisible. A pained roar snapped Hoge's attention earthward and she glimpsed Inigo battling to stall the moth. He was reeling from impacts raining against his disintegrating armor. To her horror glowing tentacles were erupting rapidly from the cracks in the construct - Gigan's fury leaking out reacting to deadly threat. Even prepared, the violent explosion still stole Hoge's breath utterly when it erupted. Inigo's armor blew apart, crystalline shards rocketing dangerously as Gigan's enormous draconic biped form erupted skyward with guttural challenging shriek.

Hoge could only cling flattened atop Orihime in shock. Hoge steeled herself. Everything balanced upon moments racing faster than her thundering heart... Whatever time Inigo bought she would not waste recklessly. Inch by inch, she carefully sidled along cracked chitin plates towards Orihime's spasming antennas. Just clearing the poison dust from the vapor pools had not worked, but the flowering cherry trees did slow it down, which meant Orihime was susceptible.

Mind churning rapidly, Hoge unlatched her Marumaru helmet and jammed her kunai into the canister keeping the mood-altering aromatic compounds safely contained. Reaching for the sticker scroll roll behind her belt, she tied her helmet tightly along the base of the moth's receptor.
"Please, you must regain control of your faculties!" Hoge entreated. She clasped a chitin plate between both palms as if trying to psychically project calm rationality directly into Orihime's brain.

But abruptly Hoge sensed peril and looked down. Both of the kaiju moth's eyes had locked onto her through the haze of battle. Terror jammed her throat. Orihime can perceive her?! With violent double thrust of mighty wings, slipping handholds were ripped away completely. Hoge plunged. Nothing beneath her boots but empty air and very hard earth! Hoge screamed, heart seized in a vice as her life flashed before watering eyes..

In response to Hoge's frantic plea sudden movement flashed from below. Through watering vision she glimpsed Gigan's colossal draconic head swiveling her way with preternatural focus - as if twin gazes had locked instantly across the kaiju battle. Then with outraged shriek Gigan's armor-plated form abruptly dissolved mid-grapple. Blinding emerald light erupted outwards forcing Orihime backward. An instant later instead of a kaiju there, soaring rapidly from the distortion hovered Inigo himself wreathed in geometric wings angling sharply Hoge's way.

He shot upwards stunningly fast. But gravity's vicious claim still dragged Hoge closer by milliseconds. Hot tears streamed her cheeks bracing for crushing darkness. She kept plummeting, the ground's rocky embrace only seconds away...

Suddenly arms closed around her torso, breath punching violently free as momentum wrenched against their paired bodies. Inigo and Gigan's barrier curled around her in freefall, wings straining to bleed their terminal speed.

With final defiant flap Inigo altered their trajectory just enough to crash them sideways into trees on the park's edge. Bone-jarring impacts juddered through them as Inigo curled protectively around Hoge, armor fragmented armor forming a barrier against unforgiving debris. They tumbled in a bruising heap across deeply furrowed earth, limbs tangling painfully before rolling to a battered panting halt.

Vision blurry with pain and dizzying relief, Hoge struggled upright on one elbow. Inigo was sprawled awkwardly on top of her, armor smoked and cracked, chest heaving raggedly. They locked gazes - and promptly dissolved into half-sobbing hysterical laughter at the absurd scene. He struggled lifting both palms to gently frame Hoge's face, eyes raking her disheveled form.  "You okay? Please tell me nothing's broken. We still have a magic show at eight and you're the main performer. I'm only the eye candy."

"Only superficial contusions," Hoge murmured. Her relieved smile made him grin. She managed to carefully sit upright. Inigo tried copying her motions but white-hot agony speared through him. Collapsing with a pained hiss, he growled out.. "I can't move my body..  I overused my quirk. Gigan's out cold too.."

Hoge swiftly knelt beside his immobilized form, her hands probing for damage through shattered outer plating. She was interrupted by an ominous shadow falling over their sheltered grove. Hoge's gaze snapped up, heart clenching as six glowing eyes focused unerringly upon them through the canopy! Orihime had followed them.

Reacting on instinct, Inigo tried rolling himself futilely between the looming threat and unprotected Hoge. Gnashing his teeth as the moth descended furiously, Inigo desperately tried summoning Gigan. He had to shield Hoge somehow! "C'mon Gigan! I know you're taking a coffee break..." Inigo glimpsed Hoge stepping forward.

"Hoge wait!" Inigo made one last heroic effort lurching upright only for screaming pain signals to promptly drop him flat again. Darkness swarmed his vision. Jaw tight with pain, Inigo's watched anxiously as Hoge lifted her chin meeting the moth's swirling gaze squarely should it charge. Surprisingly, the kaiju didn't charge at them. Winds shifted, carrying traces of Hoge's aromatic helmet still ensnaring Orihime's receptors.

"Orihime.. We're your allies. The true enemy has your eggs," Her voice emerged gentle yet resonate.

Inigo followed her lead, he yelled. "They're still out there and we need to stop them! Remember how we helped ya with your nest and brought ya food? That was us!"

For endless tense heartbeats Orihime considered them...then with creaking groan, the colossal moth landed and dipped her great head before the two of them.

"Looks like she's back!"

Hoge wasted no time helping Inigo up and climbing up on Orihime. She had succeeded...somehow her helmet calmed down the kaiju. Inigo settled behind Hoge atop their mount, he peered down dubiously. Gigan was still out, if they fell again.

“She will ensure we don’t fall - I think... But we have to go. If the eggs are still in range, Orihime can track their bio-signatures.” 

"Good enough for me! Let's get those eggs back! IKUZO!"

Inigo barely had time to slide both arms securely around her waist before immense wings elevated them swiftly skyward.

"Hey, what about the other kaiju? The larger one."

"There's nothing we can do. The others will have to deal with him."

**20 minutes earlier - North of Valiant Park**

The Mayor of Kyoto, Kenji Kawashima beamed, behind his wire-rimmed glasses, his keen eyes surveyed the stage.  He was clad in a blue tailored suit, adorned with Kyoto’s emblem pin. As an aide fussed last minute with his dark-green tie, the portly politician adopted a lean pose. Valiant Park was filled to bursting for the giant moth festival, promising fantastic publicity at the height of election season! Clearing his throat, the Mayor launched into well-rehearsed remarks as cameras hovered close.

"Welcome, good citizens! As you enjoy this marvelous event today, know that our city prospers through progress achieved under my bold leadership these past years!" Behind him his team whooped loyally right on cue.

Grinning fit to burst at his perfectly receptive audience, the Mayor enthusiastically began listing accomplishments. "Why just consider our expanded bullet train network allowing more visitors to see our great city of Kyoto !" He pointed skyward. "But it's not just physical improvements I've spearheaded, no! Under my fiscal strategies, small businesses flower abundantly as mighty bamboo shoots!"

"Yes, through my vision our beloved city is reaching its full potential! A city all of Japan others envy during this uncertain age! And I know many of you are eager to reelect my administration come December!"

His campaign manager gave discreet thumbs up signaling the speech hit all key points. Chuckling happily, the Mayor turned expectantly toward the press ready for admiring questions when abruptly everything was drowned out by a loud siren, followed by piercing shrieks and terrified screams! All faces whipped toward the ear-splitting noise as the giant moth Hikoboshi came crashing violently towards the stage, trampling everything in its path. 

"My festival!" Mayor Kawashima wailed, frozen in horror watching his perfect re-election rally smashed before his eyes! Worse, the rampaging creature was barreling straight toward him, huge jaws parted hungrily! But just as mighty fangs prepared to snap the paralyzed politician up too, a rainbow cannonball abruptly shot between gnashing teeth to tackle him away!

The odd duo plunged down into a nearby snack table. The Mayor groaned as his head spun. He was covered in bagels and coffee. Before him stood the pro hero, Popsy, in her full clown attire. She was wiping herself down and watching her interns - Sally, Yui, Kaga, and Chihiro - quickly helping the terrified civilians.

"You!" Mayor Kawashima erupted apoplectically. "Why am I not shocked to find a washed-up hero behind this disturbance?!" He shook one fat fist watching his gorgeous stage get trampled behind the rainbow-wigged hero. "I'll bury you in lawsuits for destroying my festival, you infuriating clown! You’re ruining my re-election campaign!"

Popsy shrugged off the familiar threats, already conjuring a massive bat weapon instead. "Less politics, more scramblin' Butterball!" She grinned widely. "Got myself a party animal to put down first! Save the chatter for later!" Winking, she took off sprinting back toward the furious wingbeats and piercing shrieks.

***


The Mayor stared after the clown, dumbfounded and fuming. A foreign man in a jet black suit appeared by the Mayor’s side. He carried a glowing rifle and had a jetpack. “I’m here, Mayor.”

“Marshall 7, where were you?!”
“Relax, I was grabbing a moth-sicle,” The bodyguard said.
“I was nearly trampled to death!”
“You look fine to me.”
“Shut up! Get rid of that moth! It’s crushing my voters!”
“No, thanks. My mission is to protect you, not fight kaijus. Now let’s get out of here.”

Marshall 7 grabbed the Mayor from behind and flew off with the jetpack attached to his back, unfortunately, the front of the mayor’s suit opened up exposing his large stomach to the crowd below.

“Un-hand me! This is most undignified!”
“Sorry, Mayor. Can’t stop. My mission is to keep you safe, not make you comfortable.”
“We’re gonna have a long talk with your employer when we get back, Marshall 7!”
“Uh.. so about that raise?”
“NOOOOOOO!”

***



Popsy grunted as she bounced off a wall and behind the kaiju.

Her voice resounded. "HEY! Why was the moth a bad storyteller?" Popsy quipped, frantically dodging deadly mandibles. "He kept picking holes in everything!" As it reared back, the moth found itself tripping over numerous cartoon holes, and crashing into a nearby news van.

All around, panicked civilians continued fleeing the unexpected kaiju attack. But strangely after smashing the news van, Hikoboshi had taken to the air, hovering erratically as if...waiting for something.

Wary in case this new behavior meant more tricks, Popsy raised her balloon mallet! The hovering creature reared back unleashing an ear-piercing shriek resembling steel scraping glass!

Popsy wasn't the only one cringing violently at the unbearable noise. "What in tarnation?! This ain’t Japan’s Got Talent, big guy!" Popsy hollered. Just as she contemplated a joke to conjure industrial ear muffs, a familiar voice yelled out urgently!

"Miss Popsy! Over here!" Dr. Serizawa cried, sprinting toward her waving both arms. Behind him swarms of ants, beetles, and other insects now flooded city streets!

Skidding to a panting halt beside Popsy, Serizawa urgently tapped commands into a wrist computer. His normally bland features creased with dismay. "Just as I feared! That kaiju has the ability to enrage all insects in the region! If we don’t do something soon.. Kyoto will be overrun by swarms."

He pointed a shaking finger skyward where airborne battles now erupted against incoming swarms. "I’m talking about a total entomological collapse!"

Jaw set, Popsy studied their shrieking foe with fresh desperation.

"Now I don’t know what that is, but y'all heard the man, right?!” Popsy said to her ear-piece communicator.


“Copy that,” Sally said.
“Yes, sensei!” Chihiro and Kaga answered.
“Yeah!” Yui growled, “But how do we stop it?”

Dr. Serizawa nodded. “I may have a way to change the signal using the MKOL’s broadcast system - but I need to reach the top of the radio tower.”

“I’ll take him there!” Kaga called out without hesitating.

“Good. While ya’ll do that. We’ll take care of the bug! Sally get in position! Chihiro, Yui. You’re with me? And where in the blessed biscuits are Inigo and Hoge??”
“They’re doing unearthly things, sensei!”

“What’d I say about tattle tales, Punch Man!”

***
***
Yui watched Popsy lead a group of fleeing civilians through a cartoon tunnel she painted into a wall. She needed to buy time. The white-haired delinquent cursed as her crimson threads once again snapped against the moth's armored hide. Beside her, Chihiro was keeping ahead of trampling legs with her quirk. But they couldn't play keep-away forever. There was a residential neighborhood in their path!

"Damn it, we’re barely slowing it down! Over here, asshole!" Yui growled in frustration. On cue the giant insect turned, it clearly intended to flatten them.

Reacting on instinct, Yui flung more threads wrapping Chihiro tightly to herself then yanked hard! The sudden violent motion sent them both hurtling sideways barely an instant before giant jaws crunched the solid concrete where they'd stood.

Still linked by her cords, Yui helped a shaken Chihiro up, mind racing urgently. "Okay scratch Plan A... We need to try getting on this freak and constrict those wings!" She pointed to where the giant moth was bearing down on a trapped city bus, provoking screams from tourists inside. "C'mon!"

“But how?”

“Use your quirk in full blast, Mitsurugi. We’ll go together - like we practiced.”

Chihiro nodded. Yui focused on Chihiro’s quirk. She felt her muscles get lighter and a heat filled her entire body. It was working! The duo took off, utilizing Yui’s threads to spread Chihiro’s speed enhancement between them. Yui layered more thread. Using their shared dexterity, she and Chihiro rushed in, running circles around the moth, wrapping it in threads with every lap. They’ve trapped its wings and legs like a mummy.

But abruptly the moth buckled and shook the ground. Caught off guard, the girls were sent tumbling back. Chihiro managed to roll away,  but a glancing blow from a flailing mandible caught Yui, smashing her through a wooden cart.

Yui glimpsed Chihiro desperately parrying scythe-tipped limbs, barely protecting trapped tourists inside the battered bus's shredded hull. Screaming civilians peered desperately from shattered windows only yards from being crushed.

“I got it!” A tall boy wearing a red-body suit ran towards them from the crowd. 

“Who are you - are you even licensed!” Yui roared.
“I’m Velvet Worm! I can help!” 

“Not yet! But look!” He aimed his chest at the kaiju and sprayed a pink liquid into the moth’s six eyes. The moth screeched and buckled. “I did it! I blinded it!”

“Thank you.” Chihiro paused her parrying to catch her breath.

“No problem! Hey do the string thing on me! We can all use my quirk to blast it!”

“No! We’re girls, you weirdo! And that’s not how it works,*” Yui growled.

(* = no one actually knows how Yui’s quirk works)

“...I won’t tell anyone,” Rob said.

“LOOK OUT!” Yui roared as the kaiju’s claw swung at Velvet Worm and sent him flying towards a nearby brick wall and into a dumpster.

“I’m..okay!” An arm and a thumbs-up shot up from the dumpster only to fall down again.

“Shit! It’s getting stronger. We can’t hold it for long!” Yui growled and pressed on the communicator in her ear. "Sally, take the shot already!" 

"Almost got it," Sally muttered, brow furrowed in concentration. 

Atop a nearby office building, the Popsy squad’s ace sharpshooter narrowed her eyes, struggling tuning out screaming civilians and groaning metal. The rampaging moth wouldn't stay still enough for a clean hit. Her finger tensed on the trigger, doubt swirling. 

Her fingers trembled slightly watching Chihiro and Yui dance around the moth through her scope lens. C'mon, steady...

Sally grit her teeth recalling Rika Eichi's words while prepping the custom high-density slug she has chambered. "I only have one demo unit so no mess-ups. This baby crushes tanks so watch the kick-back, kiddo. This wouldn’t even be legal if you weren’t a licensed hero." Finger hovering over the hair-trigger, Sally hesitated. Could she make this insanely risky shot?! There was a bus load of people behind the moth..  So many civilians...what if she misfired? Would they take her away again…?

"Take the freaking shot!" Yui's agonized yell roared over the communicator. Sally inhaled sharply, crosshairs finally steadying over the moth's broad chest. 

"Comin' down the mountain!" Sally called out. She tuned out the chaos and squeezed the trigger.

**KA-BOOM!** The experimental round exploded forward with concussive force that shattered glass all across the block. Even braced for backlash, the cannon's recoil nearly toppled Sally off her perch. But she glimpsed the crater-making round connect dead center on the moth’s thorax before losing sight of everything except bright bursting stars. Sally skid several feet before friction finally arrested her momentum.

She struck the moth dead-center blowing it backwards to crash against brick walls across the street. Dust and debris plumed skyward cloaking the creature's enormous silhouette. 

“Did we get it?” Yui’s coughing voice called out over the dust cloud.

“It’s still moving..” Chihiro answered.

They watched in horror as the kaiju moth slowly righted itself and started to fly away.

Sally shot a second and third time. But this time her bullets had no effect. “W-what do we do?”

"Nice shootin', Tex!" Popsy's proud voice echoed over comms. “We got it in the ropes. Ol' Popsy'll take it from here!"

###"BIG"

There, standing on top of a water tower building, was Popsy.

###"BOZO"

What was different about her was her size. The woman was enormous, looking like a parade blimp version of herself.

###"BALLOON!"

With her new size, Popsy leaped off the top of the tower and was large enough to block out the sun.

###"BELLY FLOP!"

Then with strength belying her silly appearance, Popsy slammed full-force into fuzzy thorax! The resounding "SPROING!" of ultra-flexible clown shoes meeting moth hide was audible for miles! Sally and Yui cringed in tandem witnessing the brutal midair collision.

But amazingly Popsy bounced cleanly off at the last second, sticking a perfect ten-point landing as her dazed opponent crashed down limply! The giant kaiju lay in a stunned heap. Dazed antennae twitched sporadically, likely hallucinating tiny yellow birds courtesy of Popsy’s quirk.

As their teacher blew triumphant silly strings atop her giant captive, Popsy’s interns sighed in relief. The crowd around them cheered.

####V. Kyoto Jūkan Expressway

Laughter filled the getaway truck as Alcher's crew celebrated. Their egg heist had gone off without a hitch. Chainzo tried ignoring the sinking feeling settling in his gut as he eyed the three barrel-size eggs behind them. The heroes were distracted by the rampaging moths and no one saw their escape vehicle courtesy of Door-Man's quirk. Still, Chainzo's chain fingers clinked anxiously against rusty side panels.

"We did it, right?" he whispered nervously leaning closer to Alcher. 

"Yeah, we did, kid. You did good! For your first time," Alcher chuckled.

The rest of the crew chimed in with agreement. "So guess who's paying once we get to the bar? Eh! New guy pays!" Smekter yelled, nudging Chainzo.

Chainzo chuckled along with the others. "I'll spare the coin.  You guys took a chance on me...I won't forget it!" his voice cracked slightly. The crew erupted into cheers, slapping him on the back.

But their celebration was short-lived as Alcher's expression turned serious. "Step on it, Door-Man. We're not out of the bad water yet."

"Alright' boss, five minutes until we're out of the city," the driver called out, his focus on the road ahead.

Just as Door-Man spoke, the truck began to shake violently, causing everyone inside to stumble. Alcher's eyes widened in alarm as he gripped the edge of his seat. "What the hell is happening?" 

The rest of the crew piled forward to gawk out the cracked windscreen. There blocking the road towered the giant moth, Orihime, eyes swirling furiously in front of two small figures riding atop her head. 

 "End of the line, fellas! You got something that doesn't belong to ya!" A blonde boy yelled out with surprising authority.

Chainzo's heart sank... "Shit."

***

Inside the truck, Alcher's voice brought out of their shock. "We'll fight our way out of this! My berserker toxin will handle the moth. The rest of you, deal with the kids!"

The door of the truck swung open and Alcher stepped out, his hands raised in mock surrender. But before anyone could react, his crew burst out behind him, launching themselves into the fray. Bilge and Smekter unleashed a barrage of gunfire, while Alcher released a plume of his berserker toxin.

But Inigo wasn't fazed. "We're ready for that! Orihime, whirlwind!" he commanded. The colossal moth obeyed, beating its wings with incredible force, creating a powerful gust that sent the crew and Alcher tumbling backward, along with the poison gas.

"Now! Get em' girl!" Orihime rushed forward, sharp mandibles held high. Chainzo's quirk flared and a web of chains weaved around the moth. "So that's how you stopped her before... but you're too slow!" Inigo ducked and clung to Orihime, he manuevered his mount to tackle Chainzo, but Alcher was there, pushing the mutant boy out of harm's way. Both Chainzo and Alcher crashed to the ground.

Behind him, Chainzo heard groans of pain as a half-materializing Hoge knocked out Door-Man and Smekter. Bilge made a run for it only to be swept up by Orihime's passing claw.

"Not looking good..." Alcher muttered, struggling to his feet. "Just run back to Tor Maju. Tell Frog King what happened, he owes me one. He'll watch over you, kid.."

"I can't just leave you!" Chainzo protested, his voice weak.

"I'll buy you time!" Alcher took a deep inhale of his berserker toxin and leaped into the air, punching into Orihime as the moth flew toward them again. "Do what I say, you dumb kid!" he grunted through gritted teeth.

As Alcher clung to Orihime, Chainzo got to his feet and started to make a run for it. Then he hesistated, changing directions. He ran towards the truck, just as he saw Orihime knocking Alcher out cold.

Chainzo sneered, his chains snaking out to ensnare the eggs inside. "Y-you let him go or I'll crush the eggs!" he yelled.

Inigo tensed and reared Orihime back. "It's just you left, pal.. Don't do anything dumb. You hurt those eggs and I won't be able to hold the kaiju back."

Chainzo's heart pounded. He was way over his head. "I'll do it! Don't test me..."

Hoge appeared in front of him, a ghostly presence. "Talk to us.. You seem scared. Who's Frog King?" her voice piped up.

"Our employer... and he won't be happy that you interfered with us today. You're as good as dead," Chainzo threatened.

But the voice only chuckled. "Fufufu~ You must be very new."

Chainzo's grip tightened on his chains. "Like hell I am!"

Hoge appeared again, a few feet behind him this time, her words echoing with urgency. "You really think your chains are strong enough to crush those eggs? Are you aware kaiju shells measure approximately nine centimeters in thickness with durable calcium density measuring 8.7 on the Mohs Scale. So go ahead." Hoge lied.

Chainzo's panic was palpable. "Shit shit shit..." The voice was right... He had no idea. His chains loosened around the eggs.

Inigo's eyes gleamed, petting Orihime to calm her down. "You don't want to do this, right? Were you forced into this by those guys?"

Chainzo's response was a defiant roar. "No! I'm a proud member of Alcher's crew!"

But Inigo pressed on, his voice softening. "Then this isn't your usual gig... I get it. Put down your chains and they'll go easy on you. C'mon. I can help you. We've been to Tor Maju... you guys don't get a fair cut."

Chainzo's chains quivered with uncertainty, his gaze darting between Inigo and his unconscious crew. "What about the others?"

Inigo's tone was earnest. "Them too. I'll make sure their lenient. I have connections. Just give us back the eggs..."

"Liar!" Chainzo's voice cracked with frustration, his chains whippd wildly.

"I know you don't trust me... but maybe... we don't have to fight," Inigo offered, unmounting Orihime and standing weakly before Chainzo. His muscles still ached.

"I can see how scared you are, bro..." he continued, his voice tinged with empathy.

"It wasn't supposed to end up like this!" Chainzo's admission was filled with regret.

"I know... Answer one thing. Why does Frog King want the eggs? Is it really worth your life?" Inigo's voice was gentle, coaxing.

Chainzo's growl was barely audible. "No... I hate it... It's this dumb stupid war... the Frog King is starting against-"

But before he could finish, a sharp hiss cut through the air, and Chainzo's eyes widened in pain. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed, unconscious, the eggs tumbling from his grasp but remaining intact.

Inigo and Hoge looked up to see a figure descending from the sky, a man wearing a red and white jetsuit with the number 360 emblazoned on his chest armor. It was the #7 pro hero, Three-Sixty.

"Hey pal. He was just about to surrender!" Inigo called out at the descending figure. He was a foreigner with brown hair and blue eyes.

"Was he? I don't usually hand out free lessons, but never believe what desperate criminals say," Three-Sixty exclaimed confidently, hands on his hip. "Looks like I got here just in time! Well done, but I'll take it from here!"

Inigo and Hoge shared a look, silently agreeing. What was the chain guy about to say? 

"No. We'll be taking the eggs back with Orihime," Inigo declared. 

"Suit yourself," Three-Sixty smiled. "I'll provide escort."

As Inigo, Hoge, and Orihime arrived back at the park, Three-Sixty escorted them through the gathered crowd. People erupted into cheers, their faces filled with relief and gratitude as they saw the eggs safely returned.

Taking a microphone from a nearby reporter, Three-Sixty raised his voice to address the crowd. "Thank you, everyone, for your support! Let's hear it for the Popsy team, who saved the park and Kyoto today!"

The crowd cheered even louder, clapping and whistling. Popsy, Sally, Yui, Kaga, and Chihiro hurried towards two teenagers' side. Three-Sixty turned to the students, a proud smile on his face. "And a special shoutout to these brave students who showed incredible courage and determination!"

Then, he gestured towards the police officers and emergency workers gathered around the park. "And how about an applause for our cops and emergency workers?"

As the crowd erupted into applause once more, Three-Sixty grinned for the cameras. "Nothing like a bit of action to teach us what really matters. Love, family, and heart."

"To properly thank you all for your bravery today," Three-Sixty continued, "we'll be bringing in food trucks for free, courtesy of Kurtz Industries and Supalife Vitamins!"

As the crowd cheered at the mention of free food, they turned their attention to the kaiju moths, Orihime and her mate, floating around their eggs. It was a heartwarming sight, a successful mating season for the majestic creatures.

"Now my dear citizens," Three-Sixty announced, "I'm sure you're all waiting to hear from Popsy and her students!" With a flourish, he passed the microphone to Popsy. "What do you have to say Popsy?"

Popsy paused with the mic, she turned to her interns who looked at her encouragingly. "Right. Well folks! The fun got interrupted, but we now have the villains locked up and the city is safer. As my grandfather used to say, when one door closes, another one opens. He was a smart man, but a terrible cabinet maker. <clown horn honk> We're raising money for a trip to Osaka right now. Sure would be nice if you'll check out our moth merchandise. Whoa- hang on! One question at a time!" The news reporters swarmed around Popsy and her team, eager to hear more of their firsthand account of the events. Inigo and Hoge stood side by side, holding hands and smiling as they watched the scene unfold.

Inigo grinned widely. "You alright?"
Hoge nodded, but she seemed to be deep in thought. 
"Still thinking of that kid, huh?" 
"Yes.."
"No worries. I'm sure we'll see him again. Hey, check it out!" Inigo held out two pieces of rainbow-colored scales. "Orihime, left us a present. Just in case we want to see her in the future." He looked up towards the two moths flying happily next to their eggs. 

"Gotta love a happy ending," Inigo quipped, squeezing Hoge's hand affectionately.

###After Credit Scene:

In a dimly lit alley, Chainzo stood before Three-Sixty. "Shouldn't you be taking me to prison now, or whatever. I don't plan on escaping. This was a stupid plan to begin with…but sir.. for my one phone call.. You think I can call Saurus? I want to turn myself around. They say he can help people like me..."

Three-Sixty's lips curled into a toothy grin. "Well, isn’t that nice?"

Chainzo glanced around the shadowy alleyway, a sense of unease creeping over him. "Hey uh.. "

Three-Sixty interrupted, his gaze piercing. "Do you know what my power is, kid?"

"Uh.. you control technology?"

"No. The brilliant engineers at Agency 360 make my gear. Now- they’re the real heroes." Three-Sixty's grin widened, his blue eyes gleaming. "My power is short-wave clairvoyance. I know everything that can come out of your annoying little mouth. Seconds before you say it."

"Huh?"
"Huh?" Three-Sixty repeated in perfect sync with Chainzo.

"W-where are the others?"
"Where are the others?"

"...they’ve been dealt with."

"W-what do you mean?"
"What do you mean?" Three-Sixty echoed, his voice mocking.

"This isn't funny.."
"This isn't funny."

Three-Sixty's expression turned cold as he looked at his mechanized gauntlet. Without warning, he lunged forward, his hands closing around Chainzo's throat, lifting Chainzo easily.

"Hey! W-what are you- stop please.."

"Hey What are you- stop please.." echoed Three-Sixty, his grip tightening.

"You’re a pro hero.. You’re not allowed to kill."
"You’re a pro hero. You’re not allowed to kill." Three-Sixty's face remained impassive as he continued to choke Chainzo.

"Heroes... protect people..."
"Heroes protect people."

Three-Sixty chuckled. "You're right but you’re not people… You’re a filthy. disgusting. mutant. A disease slowly killing this world… A stain to be removed..."

Gasping for air, Chainzo struggled against Three-Sixty's relentless assault. Chains whipped out to defend him, but Three-Sixty easily overpowered him, sending Chainzo falling to the ground.

As he desperately tried to crawl away, Three-Sixty delivered brutal kicks, his tech-enhanced legs crushing ribs and bones with each blow. With a merciless glare, Three-Sixty watched Chainzo's hand fall limply to the ground, a brochure for Saurus’ ROAR program clutched in his grasp.

“Help… Saurus..” Chainzo pleaded weakly.

“That's funny.. There’s no Saurus here.. And one day.. I’ll heal Japan and remove him for good.” With a swift motion, Three-Sixty brought a crushing foot into the boy's neck, and Chainzo's body slumped to the ground.

Three-Sixty calmly pulled out his phone and dialed headquarters. "Jack here.. It’s done."

A woman's voice responded, "Good. I’ll let Mr. Pax know of your success, sir."

"I have a question - about that boy who fought the kaiju. What was his name?"

"Myoga Inigo, sir. He goes by Ryu-kishi."

"And the other boy?"

"I believe that was a girl, sir. Nyoro Hoge. She goes by Marumaru."

"Why does that name sound familiar?"

“We have a Mr. Nyoro in 360 corporate, sir. I believe he’s in executive-level management.”

"Ah, yes. Bring him in, will you? I’d like to talk to him."

“Right away, sir.”
