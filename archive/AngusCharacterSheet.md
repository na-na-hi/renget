### Angus ♂
I've awoken in this unfamiliar world, but not as a human but as a... bird!? Not just that, I no longer have hands; I've shrunk down and can't remember who I am!

"'Tis not good at all..." I break out in a cold sweat.

This must be a dream; I pinch and try to wake up, but to no avail. "Tis for real, it seems," I muttered.
