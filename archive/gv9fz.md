>Running some errands with my husband and our children
>We have two so far
>And I'm pregnant with two more
>Looking for a crib that'll accommodate twins at the furniture store
>I see a professionally dressed white woman with her hair in a bun
>She looks like she hasn't slept in days
>She walks on over to us
>Looks at my husband
>Looks at him intently
>Is she planning on stealing him from me?
>She'd have better luck trying to rob Fort Knox
>She starts to speak
>"Wait... is that you..."
>"Yes, it's me", my husband responds
>"Wow... I haven't seen you since sophomore year in high school"
>"Yeah, it's been a long time," he says rather coldly. "What's up with you?"
>"Just trying to climb the corporate ladder and find that special someone", she says with an unconvincing smile. "I'm sure I can do both... eventually."
>"Well, I've found my special someone", he replies, putting his arm around me. "Meet my wife. Went to Japan as an exchange student and met her there."
>"Oh, that's... lovely."
>"She is, isn't she? Well, I better get going."
>I ask him who it was
>He says he had a girlfriend before me
>He though she loved him
>But then he found out she was cheating on him
>He broke up with her and was reluctant to date for a while
>That's why he was a bit reluctant to confess to me
>About half an hour later, we head out to our car
>I can't help but notice her in her car
>Holding her head in her hands
>Shoulders shaking
>Torn between feeling sorry for her and believing she got what she deserved
>She threw away a wonderful man with her selfish, thoughtless betrayal
>And she'll have to live with that fact forever
