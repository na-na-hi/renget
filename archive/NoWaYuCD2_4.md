Chapter 4: A Trial from the Taisha
Wa: When we were having lunch break at school, Hinata suddenly said...
Hi: Everyone! As Heroes, you must be able to deal with any unexpected situation.
Wa: That's right. Heroes must be able to act even when taken by surprise.
Ta: That's no problem for Tama. It's even less of a problem for Anzu.
An: You're raising the bar again...
Hi: I see you're brimming with confidence! How wonderful!
Ch: I'm getting a bad feeling about this again...
Hi: Well then. Yuuna-san, if you please.
Yu: Uuh, this is difficult...
Hi: I'm sure you can do it with your Hero power!
Yu: Okay! Hero power times twenty!
Ta: Hey, hey! What did you two scheme behind our backs? Spill the beans!
Yu: Pah! You want to give me orders? I do as I please!
Ta: Uh, Y-Yuuna is...
An: ...staging a coup!?
Yu: Ah, cigarettes sure taste great! Paah!
Wa: She's holding a chocolate cigarette in her mouth!
Ta: Even the dark Yuuna says no to drugs!
An: Still, what a shocking sight!
Ta: This is serious! Chikage, what are we gonna do?
Ch: You're leaving it to me?
Yu: Whew, you girl over there! You're a real hottie.
Ch: Uh.
Yu: Come see the Seto Inland Sea with me. How 'bout we check if there are any octopuses in the pots?
Ch: S-sure... gladly...
Ta: Hey, don't just let her pick you up! Alright! Leave it to Tama...
Ta: Oi, Yuuna! Where'd ya come from?
An: Why are you stooping down to her level now? Geez.
Wa: It seems like I'll have to give her educational guidance. Clash with me, Yuuna! I will take on anything you-
Yu: Bam!
Wa: Nice clash! You pack a punch, Yuuna.
Yu: So do you, Wakaba-chan.
Hi: Okay, that's enough. You've come to an understanding, which means you have passed the trial.
Ch: Trial...?
Hi: It was a surprise test to see if you could handle one of your team members turning into a delinquent.
An: That's a very specific scenario.
Yu: Phew, that was hard! I'm sorry, guys.
Hi: Good work, Yuuna. Making you the delinquent might not have been the best casting choice, but you did well.
An: Using her would make an impact exactly because she's the one you'd least expect to act this way... that's why, isn't it?
Hi: Indeed. That was a great reaction from you, Wakaba-chan. I expected nothing less.
Ta: It kinda feels like you're letting us off the hook 'cause it's Wakaba. Well, whatever. Hinata, does the trial go on after this?
Hi: Yes. The Taisha will tell us to do things like this once in a while to ensure we have a flexible mindset.
Wa: The Taisha would do something like this...?
Hi: As such, I would like you to cooperate if I ask any of you for help with the trial.
Wa: This sounds like training for astronauts...
An: These things will keep happening out of the blue from now on...
Ta: I like it! Sounds kinda fun!
Ch: I have nothing but a bad feeling about this...
Ch: A few days later, my bad feeling was confirmed.
Hi: Well then, Chikage-san, I will be counting on you.
Ch: Do I really have to do this?
Hi: It's part of your Hero training~.
Ch: I-I got it...
Ch: Hey, Nogi-san.
Wa: What is it, Chikage?
Ch: I believe we should do more to carry out the task we have as Heroes. In other words, we should give the people courage in more ways than just by fighting the Vertex.
Yu: Oh, that sounds interesting! 
Wa: Do you have something in mind?
Ch: I want to... sing! We will sing a song of hope to light up their path!
Yu: A song!?
Ch: How about all of us form a Hero idol unit together?
Wa: I-I'm not cut out for that sort of thing.
Ch: No, I know you can do it.
Ta: Tama's heard it all! I think the centa mast be Tama! I'm gonna write all the autographs by hand!
Yu: Oh, so brave!
Ta: Tama's a Hero, after all!
An: We can't do this! Fighting against the Vertex is our most important duty.
Wa: You're right. Practicing songs would cut into our training time, so...
Hi: All right, you pass! You've handled that brilliantly, Anzu-san!
Ch: Ugh...
Hi: This just now was a trial to see how you would handle a team member's suggestion to spend time and effort on a matter unrelated to your primary duty.
Ta: W-we-well, Tama knew that!
Ch: Says the one who got all excited about it...
Wa: I wonder what trial we'll have to face next.
Hi: I don't think there won't be one anytime soon.
Wa: That feels sort of dull...
Hi: In that case, may I ask for your assistance, Wakaba-chan?
Wa: Sure. Just say the word.
Hi: If you say so... fufu...
Ta: And such, some days later...
Hi: Well then, Wakaba-chan. If you please.
Wa: Ahem. Meow~! Meow~meow~.
Ta: Ueh! What's wrong, Wakaba!?
Wa: Myah... meeeow.
An: Wakaba-san turned into a cat!?
Yu: Wakaba-chan, you're cute! There, there, there...
Wa: Purr, purr... Meow.
Ta: Tama can do that, too! Meow! Meow!
An: Seriously, why do you stoop down to their level!?
Ch: ...So, how are we supposed to react to this...?
Hi: Heh, just enjoy it and shoot away like me!
Wa: Hinataaaaaaa!!
