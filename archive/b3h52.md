\>It’s been several weeks since you’ve started to work at Monsters Incorporated
\>Following the pioneering work of James Sullivan and Dr. Wazowski into the energetic potential of laughter, the once fearful view monsters had of humans has given way to acceptance and even curiosity
\>Naturally, it was only a matter of time before the ruling bodies of the human and monster worlds began to interact
\>Thankfully, the promise of sharing a near limitless clean energy source made for a rather peaceful allegiance between the two
\>You were one of the first civilians to travel to the monster's dimension on a work visa, and you’ve taken quite well to the hustle and bustle of this new world
\> Most of your monster peers seem quite friendly, and are eager to hear what life is like in the human world
\>Still, there are those within your offices who are hesitant of such rapidly developing interspecies interactions
\>Perhaps none are more vitriolic than your co-worker Randall
\> As part of a plea deal to avoid prison time due to his ties with Henry J. Waternoose, he agreed to continue working at Monster’s Incorporated alongside a human
\> You had been partnered with him as an associate to get him more acclimated to humans, but any progress has been slow and arduous
\> This isn’t too surprising, since he loves to ramble on about the beatings he received when he was left in the southern states
\> Still, you do want this to work since you feel he could be a nice guy deep down
\> Finally, after a particularly busy day, you get a breakthrough
\> It’s taken weeks of prodding, but you’ve finally convinced him to join you for drinks after work, your treat of course
 
\> Things start off as you’d expect; he’s less than thrilled to be seen hanging out with a human, and he keeps complaining about there being too many at his old hangouts
\> You do your best to pay his negativity no real mind, and order a beer for each of you
\> As he begins to drink, you start to notice that his body language seems a bit less hostile
\> He doesn’t seem nearly as fidgety, and even brushes against you as he slams his glass down on the counter
\> His scaly skin feels smooth, a bit warmer than you were expecting, and surprisingly muscular
\> In this looser state, you can see just how flexible and gracile his body is, coiling around the stool like a snake would
\> By beer two, his icy demeanor has nearly all melted away
\> No longer is he almost hissing with each word he speaks, an instead seems a bit more open and inviting
\> You feel confident enough to crack a joke, and for the first time you see him smile and laugh, flashing his spikey teeth to you
\> He seems to catch himself, and turns back to his drink, though his body begins to shift to a slightly brighter, more pinkish hue
\> You can’t help but blush a bit
\> Seems the booze may be loosening you up as well
\> As a third beer is slid down to each of you, the conversation begins to shift to more personal matters
\> Randall asks if you have anyone back home, to which you respond that you are indeed single
\> “You ever been with a monster before?” he asks
 
\> It’s at this moment that you both realize you’re looking into one another’s eyes
\> Part of you wants to turn away, to go back to your beer
\> But something else, deep down, urges you to stay
\> Perhaps it’s his emerald eyes that seem to glimmer, despite the dark lighting of the bar
\> “No, but I’m certainly not against it”
\> What feels like an eternity passes as Randall looks back at you, his body beginning to glow a soft red
\> “Well…” he stammers, ever so slowly leaning in towards you “Perhaps…”
\> The sound of a drunken monster sitting next to Randall, screaming nonsense into the bar cuts through the tension between the two of you
\> Shifting back to his usual purple-skinned, squinty eyed self, Randall spins around to glare at the drunk, before turning back to his drink
\> Whatever mood he was in before is gone, regular surly Randall was back
\> He quietly finished his drink, pushed a few bills your way, and staggered out of the bar, grumbling as he went
\> You were tempted to follow after him, but felt as if that would be a bad idea
\> Instead, you sit at the bar, wondering what exactly he was about to propose
 
\> The following day at work, Randall acts as though nothing had happened
\> Just as grumpy and upset as usual
\> Though, he seems to do his best to stay even farther away from you
\> Finally, after dealing with this for hours, you simply must get closure on the night before
\> “Hey, about last night…”
\> He glares back at you, “There was nothing weird that happened last night. I don’t like you, and you don’t like me. And it’s going to stay that way, got it?”
\> You can’t help but feel a pained twinge in your stomach at such a response, and barely manage to meekly nod back
\> A few hours later, the end of day whistle rings out
\> Randall is quick to leave in a huff, but you decide to stay back for a bit to finish up some paperwork you had
\> As you make the final adjustments to the assignment, you notice that in his hurry to leave, Randall had forgotten to take his keycard with him
\> He’s not permitted to leave the building without it, so he must still be in the offices somewhere
\> You think it a bit strange that he wouldn’t have come back for it by now, but brush the thought away as you leave the laugh floor to look for him
 
\> You check the front of the offices, then the food court storage room, and then the storage closet
\> No Randall, and no one still around to tell you where he might be
\> A bit frustrated, you decide to head to the office’s laundry room
\> As a recent perk to working at monster’s incorporated, the building has an on-site laundry center where you can drop off clothes at the start of the day, and pick them up at the end, free of charge for employees
\> Perhaps Randall was there dealing with the machines, which can occasionally act up
\> Sure enough, you make your way over there, calling out to the monster to see if he can hear you
\> As you turn the corner into the room, you notice a shirt and a pair of underwear lying on the ground near the washing machines
\> A human shirt and underwear
\> Your shirt and underwear
\> Confused, you walk up to it and notice that beside the clothes is a small puddle of a sticky bluish liquid
\> As you lean down to inspect it, a drop lands from the ceiling into the puddle at your feet
\> You peer upwards, wondering if there is some sort of leak of chemicals that you need to inform the sanitation staff of
\> Looking up, you see no broken piping, or any sort of damaged equipment
\> What you do see is a small band of the same blue liquid, seemingly suspended in mid air
\> “Randall?” you call out
\> You are only met with silence
\> “Randall, is that you? I’ve got your key card here…”
\> Without a word, Randall materializes from the air around the mystery floating liquid
\> His body is an incredibly pale white, and his eyes are wide open staring down at you with a look of abject horror
\> It takes you a moment, but you soon realize the source of the liquid
\> Randall’s cock is completely coated in it, and you can tell that it was certainly a thick glob of his juices
 
\> It takes you a moment to draw your eyes off of his manhood
\> Or rather, two, as a closer inspection reveals he has a hemipenis
\> Both long and snaky like his body
\> And both absolutely covered in his spunk
\> Neither of you can say a word, or even move
\> Your mouth opens a few times, but words fail to come out
\> Randall remains clinging to the ceiling, motionless
\> Finally, you manage to eek out the words “Is…everything alright?”
\> Keeping his eyes locked to yours, Randall scrambles down from the ceiling onto the floor
\> Keeping a low profile, he scurries to you, and snatches the card from your hand
\> “Wait, what is going on?” you demand, grabbing his arm before he can clamber away
\> You can feel his body tense up as you wrap your fingers around his thin upper arm, and are answered by a light groan emerging from his lips as his cock twitches and shoots a small wad of cum onto your work shirt
\> For some reason, the feeling of his seed on your chest seems to cause your cock to twitch, and in just a moment, you’re sporting a half-chub underneath your pants
\> Randall’s eyes widen even farther, and you can tell he wishes he was anywhere but here
\> Doing your best to pay what just happened no mind, you pull him a bit closer to you
\> “Please” you reassure him, doing your best to be as comforting as the situation will allow “You can trust me”
\> Though the rest of his body remains white, Randall’s head begins to cycle through an entire rainbow of colors
\> First light blue, then yellow, then dark red
\> A polka-dot pattern even flares up for a moment
\> Finally, it settles back to the light blue, with the rest of his body following suit
\> “I just…last night…and you…”
\> His words come out stuttered and without focus
\> Clearly, his anxiousness is keeping him from thinking straight
\> Despite this, and the circumstances as a whole, you can’t help becoming rock hard
\> He should come off as creepy, or even disgusting
\> But he just seems so adorable
 
\> Maybe it’s this feeling, or the fact you haven’t been laid in a long time that drives you forward, but without hesitation you pull Randall to your face and lock your lips against his
\> Randall’s entire body tenses at this, before going incredibly slack, turning to putty in your hands
\> His body, almost hot to the touch, presses against you, and seems to try to wrap itself around you
\> The monster’s hips begin to buck back and forth, grinding his cock against your leg, then up to your groin as he lifts his body up to meet yours
\> Soon, your tongue pushes past his teeth, and begins to explore his mouth
\> As you find his own tongue, Randall lets out a soft moan before wrapping it around yours
\> Seems even his tongue is as long and flexible as the rest of him
\> Holding him this close reflects just how different he is from a human
\> And yet, it feels so right
\> Yours hands work their way behind him, and begin to caress his back, feeling his muscles flex and move with each shift
\> While this is happening, you feel two of Randall’s hands begin to fiddle with your pants, struggling to unbutton them to free your now leaking cock
\> Finally, he manages to undo the button, and you can’t help but let out a muffled groan as one hand cradles your balls, and the other wraps itself around your shaft
\> Not wanting to be outdone, you take one of his cocks in your own hand, pausing a moment to feel his seed seep between your fingers
\> You groan again as Randall begins to stroke up and down your cock, and are met with one of his own as you do the same
\> Randall’s tail snakes its way up from the floor, wrapping itself around your midsection to hold him steady
\> You can feel just how much power he could exert with it, yet its grip is gentle
 
\> It seems that he can hold his own weight on you, which frees up your other hand to stroke his second shaft
\> The feeling of both of his cocks being touched draws a loud groan of pleasure from the monster, and he pushes a hand underneath your shirt to play with your nipples
\> As he kneads them, his upper pair of arms wrap around the back of your neck, locking the fingers together tightly
\> After a long moment of enjoying the presence of each other, Randall finally pulls his head away from yours.
\> You open your eyes to look at him, and find a myriad of soft colors splashed across his body
\> Pinks, yellows, oranges, and beiges blend together to form an artistic array
\> It looks cute enough to hang in a museum, though not as cute as the teary eyes smile the monster is gracing you with
\> The two of you say nothing, but looking deep into his emerald green eyes tells you all you need to know
\> He is ready for you
\> You rest your hands just above his tail to steady him as he lifts himself up, settling to press his hole gently onto your throbbing cock
\> He looks up at you again, a look of longing in his eyes, before lowering himself onto you
\> His ass is quite tight, and it takes a long while of gradual movement before you are even half way
\> At this point, Randall grits his teeth and lets out a sharp inhale of air
\> “I think…that’s all I can…”
\> You nod in between heavy breaths, and begin to slowly, gentle buck your hips in and out
\> Each thrust makes it clear that this is his first time taking a cock, as his fingers dig into your skin as his walls grip you ever so tightly
\> Despite this, you find each new thrust a bit easier than the last, and his ass seems to grow a bit more accustomed to your girth
\> Still, it is slow goings, and Randall seems to still be struggling to handle you
 
\> Then, as you go to steady yourself for another thrust, you feel your foot begin to slip on the puddle on cum beneath you
\> Randall, unable to catch himself, let his body fall down, and with a gasp feels the entire length of your cock enter him
\> As your balls smack against his skin, both of his cocks erupt, spilling wads of cum onto your clothes as his fingers slightly break skin digging into you
\> You look to him, worried that you may have hurt him
\> Randalls glances up back to you, his mouth open and tongue hanging out with his eyes rolled back towards his head
\> Without a word, you feel him lift himself up your cock, almost pulling it free, before slamming back down onto it with a loud smack of skin on skin
\> You let out a gasp and grip him lightly, letting him pull himself up again before taking his body in your arms and slamming him down again with increased fervor
\> The two of you scream out in pleasure, as the gradual, slow sex of before molds into rough fucking
\> The sound of your hips crashing together is met by loud, guttural groans erupting from your lips, and throaty gasps erupting from his
\> You feel two hands grip your ass, and you feel inspired to pick up the pace even more
\> It isn’t long before you feel the pressure begin to build within your cock, and you know you are close
\> Once again, you two lock eyes, and without exchanging words, you know exactly what he wants
\> For you to shoot a hot load deep inside him
\> A request you are more than happy to oblige
 
\> You pound away, as hard and fast as you can muster, and feel the pressure building until it finally reaches its peak
\> He pulls his head to yours, kissing as you cum together
\> Randall’s ass clamps down onto you as your cock erupts into him, almost seeming to try and milk you dry
\> At the same time, his cocks shoot out one last time, though unloading high enough to hit you in the chin
\> A wave of pleasure crashes across your body, and you feel an immense sense of pleasure coursing through you
\>The monster presses against you tightly, his tail squeezing you as your cock pumps the last bit of your seed out
\> Having emptied the last of his own cum, you feel Randall’s cocks begin to soften against you, yet he makes no effort to pull away from you
\> Wanting ever so desperately to hold you as close as possible
\> Your lips pull apart one last time, and he raises himself off of you, letting a glob of cum fall from his ass onto the floor
\> You do your best to set him down, and he manages to steady himself on four quivering legs, before lying his long body down onto the ground
\> It’s only then that he finally fully lets go of you, though with a sense of trepidation to doing so
\> With him finally off of you, you collapse to the floor, taking a moment to gather your breath after being winded from the force you had exerted
\> You two remain there for what feels like forever, collecting yourselves
\> Randall has shifted to a dark green color, and watches your cum slowly leak from his hole
\> He takes a finger to scoop up a drop, and wraps his tongue around it, savoring the salty flavor
\> Finally, you work up enough energy to speak
\> “That was…incredible”
 
\> Randall looks back to you “It was”
\> Slowly, his happy demeanor melts into a soberer one
\> “I’m sorry for…how I’ve been treating you”
\> Tears begin to well up in his eyes as the green bleeds into a dark blue
\> “I’m sorry for not…being more open before”
\> You gently shush him, and pull his limp body close to yours, running your fingers along his head
\> “It’s alright, it’s alright” you comfort him
\> “I’m just glad you can be open now”
\> The light watering in his eyes build to full on tears, and he clutches you close as he begins to sob
\>” …thank you…”
 
 
\> The following day, you and Randall return to work
\> Having cleaned the laundry room, everyone is none the wiser about what had happened the night before
\> Though, they seem to notice that Randall is happier and more cheerful
\> Not necessarily incredibly friendly, but certainly a step up from his usual self
\> They also notice the two of you getting much closer with one another
\> Talking much more, cracking jokes, and even congratulating one another for each full tank
\> After several months, this job has finally become one that you enjoy coming back to each day
\> You love working to provide the monsters and humans with a clean energy source
\> But you love getting to see Randall every day even more
\> Especially on the days when he takes you out for drinks, and then joins you for movies at your place
\> He seems to enjoy horror films, and cowering into your chest certainly makes him happy
\> And horny
\> Incredibly horny
\> END
