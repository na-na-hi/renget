Description: Dremos is often disguised as a handsome young humie man with black hair. His true form appears similar, but with short horns, pink skin, pointed canines, pointed ears, and a long heart-tipped tail.

Backstory: Dremos was dropped into a high-tier lewd dungeon, appearing right in the middle of a succubus community. These succubi were performing a ritual to Onoskelis and Dremos' appearance was interpreted as a gift from Onoskelis. The succubus cult used Dremos as they gradually converted him into an Incubus and eventually inducted him into their order.

After two and a half years of living in the dungeon and exploring many of its lewd hazards, Dremos eventually escaped. Now, he hopes to explore Harahel while occasionally serving Onoskelis' will.
