>"KIKKERIKIII! Welcome, welcome everyone to the first ever Final Fantasy 14 stream YAAAAAAAY! EVERYONE has been asking for this for a LONG time so I decided to finally install the game and see what has everyone clamoring for it so much. With me I have my fellow holotori..."
>"Attention please, Hololive ID 2nd generation Pavolia Reine. How is everyone doing today? I hope you enjoy the Holotori collab"
>"We wanted to invite Subaru and Mumei but both of them haven't been heard since they started the game 2 weeks ago, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.though. Now let's STARTO!" The pair start creating their characters, and in the meantime various breaks are taken as they eat food they had gotten pre steam, cakes for Kiara and doughnuts for Reine as they finalize their characters.
>"Alright! My perfectly unkillable Pheonix Gladiator is complete!"
>"As is my peafowl Rogue. I think we're going to be in different starting areas so we'll meet up when the world opens up?"
>"Yeah, see you there Rei-nee!" The pair go about playing their characters, each getting a streamer's greeting from their individual fanbases who also played the game. At level 15 the world opened up for them as they met up in Limsa Lominsa and begin their queue for their first dungeon.
>"So Reine how are you liking the game so far?" Kiara asks while partaking in more of her cakes
>"It's okay, a little slow, but it's to be expected, hopefully it gets more enjoyable when we get more skills."
>"Yeah I get yo-AH! Oh the Queue popped, that scared me!" Kiara laughs as Reine nearly chokes on her doughnut before washing it down cough off the display. The pair continue playing as they go through the first few dungeons and eventually get to their first trial of Ifrit.
>"What do you say Reine, wanna call it for now and we pick this back up on another day?"
>"Yeah, it was certainly fun playing with you and the fans." As the pair give their farewells to their viewers both notice their boxes of sweets were completely empty

>The following week.
>"KIKKERIKIII! Everyone, we're back with some more FF14! Everyone REALLY liked last week's stream so we decided to get back into it. We've still got a lot of game to go so let's see how much we can get done today. Hope you all bought plenty of snacks, I know i did." Kiara gives her usual laugh as Reine nervously chuckles.
>"I certainly did, maybe a bit too much though?" She added with a sheepish mep in there. The pair continues through their journey, slogging through the Titan storyline while eating their snacks the entire way. Finally the pair make it to the actual trial, and with the help of fans actually manage to beat it.
>"Hey Reine, mind if we take a quick break so I can order some more food?"
>"Oh! Uhm, sure that's fine...not sure how much longer we're going to play though." Reine responds sounding unsure if she wanted to continue, but did the next cutscene while Kiara purchases a pizza.
>"Okay I'm ba-"
>"KIARA, WE'RE CONTINUING, I'M NOT STOPPING UNTIL WE GET THAT IMPERIAL WOMAN!"
>"U-Uhm? Okay?" Kiara witnesses the same cutscene and gasps
>"YEAH OKAY, WE'RE GETTING THIS BITCH!" The pair go hard into MSQs, eating all their snacks to keep the energy to persevere until they defeat Luvia and celebrate, their voices sounding deeper from fullness. 
>"You *URP* Know Reine, we're so close to the end...might as well finish right?"
>"Yeah, besides I don't think I ca sleep with how..ugh...full I am..." The pair agree to push through and finish 2.0.
>"Wow, we actually did it. We beat ARR in just two sessions..."
>"Apparently chat says 'Now the real game begins'? I guess we unlocked a bunch of stuff? Guess we have a bunch to do next time we play huh?"
>"Guess we're going to need even more snacks that this stream huh?" Kiara asks, leaving Reine to chuckle as she looks to her bloated belly

>4 Days later.
>"KIKKERI*BURP*KIII! Sorry about that one chat, ever since our last stream I've been eating more than usual. Now, Reine...I believe you have something to confess?" Kiara introduced, her voice deeper and with breaths in-between
>"I...might have been grinding Gold Saucer between streams...I'm sorry! I just really wanted the mou*URP*nts." Reine embarrassingly responds with her voice also deep and more labored.
>"You good Rei-nee?"
>Maybe? I mean I am 100 pounds heavier...my tops are riding up over my stomach and my bras don't fit anymore..." Reine spoke with concern in her voice as Kiara gasped.
>"OH!? You too? Well my bra size is still the same, but it's getting quite hard to sit in my chair now!" She responded with a curiously excited tone
>"Kiara are you getting off to this?"
>WE'VE GOT SOME RAIDS TO DO SO LET'S GO!" The pair begin their journey through ARR's 2.1 content, starting with hard mode trials which they easily pass, followed by the Crystal Tower Raid having been told it's plot relevant for later expansions. then Extreme trials which prove to be their first problem as they grind progression to try and beat it, each failed run breaking for a 'stress relief snack' with blissful moans. Eventually the duo defeat the EX trials before finally making it to what chat had been waiting for. Coils
>This is where the pair had lost it. Each failure against T5, Second T4, Final T3. Chat had begged them to do with full party, echo off so they were forced to really learn the fights. They gorged on carbs and sweets to keep themselves awake as the streams had become 8 hours long with them starting at 3 hours in. Eventually the pair made it to Bahamut themselves. 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours.
>"LIMIT BREAK...LIMIT BREAK...LIMIT BREAK! YEEEESSSSS!" Kiara shouted along with a shrieking Reine as Bahamut fell, Suddenly a loud snap and crash rang out.
>"Kiara!? Everything okay over there!?"
>"Yeah, chair just broke is all...Reine I'm having a lot of fun!"
