As(s)ylum Demon:
\>Fucking huge in all conceivable ways, but also supremely bottom-heavy. You probably only come up to his knee, so be prepared to widen a few doorways if you want to bring him over. Hope you've got high ceilings and a king-sized bed, nothing else will fit such an absolute unit. Prefers to stay inside and chill.

\>His dick is also a real jawbreaker, but he uses it pretty infrequently because of its sheer thickness. If you attempt to take it, even a little, he'll respect you for trying, and Gwyn help you if you're actually enough of a size king to take the whole thing- he'll be hopelessly smitten for the rest of his life. But maybe you *want* that?

\>Probably self-conscious about his weird body-shape and fucking enormous ass, and tends to overcompensate in the bedroom as a result. Usually a powerbottom, but if you show him you like his body with lots of ass-eating and tummy-rubs, you unlock a hidden submissive streak.

\>Can fly (usually short distances because he's a chunky boy). Probably wouldn't object to giving you piggyback rides or lifts from here to there, so long as you make it worth his while by bringing in-flight snacks or keeping him company. 

\>Talks with a weird accent thanks to the triangle-mouth and his tusks, but it can be endearing to hear him try to pronounce human language. Also, he's surprisingly decent at giving blowjobs. He's trying to make the best of a bad situation. That's all he can do. 

\>Really comfortable with casual nudity because no clothes fit. Like... ever. Actually, he's pretty comfortable in general- all that chub makes for a great pillow (if you can avoid the spiky bits).

\>Will eat whatever you make for him without complaint, even if it tastes bad. He understands you made it with love, and he's had worse. Basically a live-in garbage disposal.

---------------------------------------------------------
Taurus Demon:
\>Almost as big as the Asylum demon. Even though some level of super strength is innate to demon-kind, he's the only one that actively seems to work out. His physique reflects this, and he is built like a brick shithouse even by Lordran standards: pecs that could make Gwynevere jealous, an ass you could do Estus-shots off of, and abs harder than the scales of an Everlasting Dragon. If you're a muscle-fetishist, he is your man, bar none.

\>Need heavy lifting done? Say no more. Want a spotter in the gym? Done. Miss your ride? He'll carry you, jumping from rooftop to rooftop like the goddamn Incredible Hulk if he has to. He loves exerting himself and showing off the body he worked so hard to build, so expect dates to include lots of physical activities. Don't worry if you can't keep up with his active lifestyle- he'll gladly put you on his shoulders and call it "resistance training".

\>Likewise, his /fit/ tendencies make him a real ace in the kitchen. You never knew that healthy food could taste so good, and he'll be happy to cook every night if you'll let him. Portions are demon-sized, so don't be surprised if you can't finish it all- even if he gets a little sad, just tell him you're cutting and he'll understand. 

\>Has a dick that could make a thoroughbred draft horse envious, balls that'd put any breeding bull to shame, and a demon's libido. Thankfully, he's pretty aware of how absurd it can, and tries not to trouble you about sex. Expect to find him jerking off a *lot* if you haven't been intimate in a while. On the upside, he's always ready to go, and is down for pretty much anything- when you're as horny as he is, you can't be too picky. Secretly, he wishes someone would grab his horns and use them as handlebars when he gives a blowjob, and gently bully him for his uselessly huge penis while he bottoms.

\>Despite his looks, he's actually quite affable. Even if he's a bit stubborn or slow on the uptake, he always has your best interests at heart.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Capra:
\>A manlet compared to most of the other demons, standing just a little taller than a human. Fortunately, this also means you can actually spoon with him, hold hands, buy him clothes, and attempt to bottom without being a Varka-tier anal master

\>However, years of teasing for his short stature have made him pretty aggressive. Usually a strict top, he makes for a surprisingly emotional lover- he prides himself on making his partner feel as good as possible, and accepts nothing less than fucking you into an insensate pile of bliss every time. Once in a blue moon he may even bottom if you've really earned his trust, but if you tell anyone he likes it up the ass you should expect to get hatefucked into next week. Even if he loves you, he still has an image to maintain.

\>Actually has a weakness for cute animals, even if his standards of 'cute' are fucked due to his heritage. For example, has two zombie dogs that follow him absolutely everywhere, that he loves to absolute pieces, that you have personally seen tear faces off passersby that offend their master. At least they're house-trained, and friendly enough that you don't mind petting them otherwise.

\>Has some sense of modesty thanks to his ability to wear pants. This means that he gets easily flustered by nudity and flirting, even if it's hard for him to admit how he feels. Once, he caught you walking out of the shower with just a towel, and he didn't so much look at you for the rest of the night. You were worried until he took his pants off to do laundry, and you found the entire front slimy with pre and his erection still achingly hard a full day later. When you started jerking him off right there, his cheeks were redder than the lava floes of Lost Izalith, even as his knees buckled with the pleasure of release. For someone who loves to kiss and cuddle and grope as much as he does, you'd think he'd have better resistance, but there's something cute about the way he fidgets whenever you take the initiative.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Kalameet BF:
\>Actually has a fairly lonely personality due to Gwyn and the other Lords hunting his species to the brink of extinction. As such, he loves you a lot and can even be a little clingy at times. However, his pride as a dragon makes him tsundere to a fault- there's no way he'll admit a monster like him would fall for you, even if he can't sleep without you curled up beside him, b-baka.

\>Despite subtle moments when he shows his softer side, his day-to-day personality is rather edgy. There should never be doubt in anyone's mind that he's the toughest, meanest dragon alive, and there's a good reason he survived the genocide. Although he insists you have no reason to worry about his warlike nature (thanks to his absurdly high pain tolerance), he secretly loves it when you dote on him.

\>A bit of a size king, he can accidentally make you feel inadequate. For example, he occasionally boasts that his ass is so thick even Gwyn's fabled 'sunlight spear' couldn't make it clap. Whether he tops or bottoms, you have to accept that he's in control- he's a legendary lay and he knows it, so he can be pretty uncompromising if you try to force him into anything. He will however, accept 'suggestions', so long as you phrase them properly; stroke his ego, and he'll be putty in your hands. He knows you're doing it, but he still has to save face somehow.

\>As his chosen mate, he expects you to look in a manner befitting your station. He will raze the surrounding lands so that you can have the most luxurious things possible, doing his best to provide whatever you need as only a dragon knows how. You name it, he'll get it; whoever has a problem will burn.

\>Loves flying. Although he constantly reminds bystanders that a dragon is not a beast of burden, he will fly you to and from places in a heartbeat. Furthermore, his wings are an erogenous zone, so don't be afraid to reach out give them a good seeing-to. Just hold on tight for the inevitable crash-landing and wild sex that follows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Seath BF:
\>Hard to get close to, initially. Being treated like a freak among his own kind for untold eons gives him a naturally frigid and unapproachable demeanor. He mostly just needs time to defrost. Gets more emotive once he trusts you, but still has a dry, sarcastic sense of humor and a sadistic streak.

\>The sort of shameless Slaanesh-tier pervert who revels in his own depravity- it should say a lot that he basically invented tentacle porn in his universe. Will make all your kinkiest dreams come true, and some of the nightmares, too. Don't let him get too carried away- some of the stuff he's into *will* scar you for life.

\>Very tactile in the bedroom due to his blindness; as long as you're in arm's reach, he'll be touching you somehow. Being in such poor health means that he has a somewhat low libido and requires you to do a lot of the work in bed, but he's a very enthusiastic and vocal lover when he finally gets in the mood. Variety is key- don’t be afraid to stick your dick somewhere weird just because.

\>Probably has a dirty mouth, not just because his breath weapon does Curse damage. Deep-rooted frustration at his disabilities causes him to swear often so long as no-one too important is within earshot. Also loves to talk shit about the Lords behind their back, and spill juicy secrets about their inner workings.

\>As you might expect of someone whose house is 90% books, Seath is uncomfortably smart. He'd love to tutor you in any conceivable subject (including magic), and will reward you for showing the appropriate critical thinking skills. Has a ‘hot for teacher’ thing going on- if you manage to actually surprise him or ask something he doesn’t know the answer to, he’ll get *very* affectionate on short notice. Discussing experimental design makes great foreplay.

\>Can create life out of nothing, so if you want kids he'd be more than happy to oblige as long as you let him document the pregnancy. Also open to letting you TF yourself if you so desire. FOR SCIENCE!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Everlasting Dragon BF:
\>Extremely easy to impress. Having done nothing for millennia but sit on his rocky arse and survey the endless landscape of fog, water, and Archtrees, the Everlasting dragon knows very little of the world beyond his immediate surroundings. He views his relationship with you as a novelty, something that brings new meaning to an existence old as time itself. And when you are gone and Hollow, he will carry his grief with him until time's end, as he does the scales of his fallen brethren.

\>Comes across as a bit of a curmudgeonly old man, often lost in his memories of life before the Disparity and the advent of the Lords. Will gladly tell you about it, but it can be hard for him to explain things just because of how old he is- he may be the only one alive who knows certain words and concepts, so his thought process can be ineffable and alien. Still, he immensely values having someone to talk to, even if he's not the best at communication.

\>Unnaturally calm and patient as only an immortal can be. He never gets angry, even when people outright try to kill him, but does enjoy the inevitable frustration when they fail over and again. Cheeky at times but never mean or retaliatory- it takes a lot to break through his welcoming disposition.

\>Ever wondered what it might be like to try fucking a brick wall? Wonder no longer. As a descendant of the Ancient Dragons, his scaly hide is hard as rock. He tries to make it easy on you, but only his insides and his fur are soft, so you should expect to be sore the next morning, regardless of position. Surprisingly sensitive despite his size- because his outer skin is so thick, any stimulation on his soft bits stands out. For this reason, he actually likes smaller attributes.

\>Enjoys the thought of letting you service him while he goes about Covenant business, and other casual displays of sexuality. Not particularly kinky, though, if only because he doesn't know what kinks are. Teach him at your own risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkeater Midir BF:
\>Due to his past, he's always on-guard, so expect to put in a lot of emotional labor over the course of the relationship. He might not be responsive at first, but he appreciates any time you take to spend with him on his solemn vigils watching over the Ringed City. Be patient- he doesn't know how to be a person, and Gods help him, you make him want to try. 

\>Stoic to a fault. After being raised solely for his duty, he's not good at dealing with emotions in general. Even if he's smitten, don't expect him to ever outright say it- watch for the way he smiles when you climb on his back, or the way he presses himself into hugs like your arms are the only thing that keeps him from falling apart and giving in to the Abyss. You're the first thing other than his duty that he's ever allowed himself to care about, and he treats you with that same undying devotion. It's all he knows. 


\>Likewise, a psychological mess. Not sure if he should be outraged at the gods for taking him from his race, or grateful to them for giving him a sense of purpose and meaning. He mostly tries not to think about it, quietly mourning what he has lost while the question gnaws at him as surely as the Abyss that taints his soul.

\>Can act very closeted in public, especially around members of the Church. However, as you'd expect of someone who was raised with a repressive authority looming over his head, he has a lot of *intense* emotions behind closed doors. Expect him to cry during sex, or if you give him any type of affectionate contact for long enough. 

\>Giving, to the point of subservience in the bedroom; may start out viewing you as a master rather than a lover. Loves giving blowjobs, has an oral fixation, but largely because he expects you to deny him orgasm at all times. If you give him enough TLC, he'll slowly stop thinking of himself as a tool for your pleasure- be prepared to help him work through millennia of blue-balls once he's confident enough to actually ask for sex.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bell Gargoyle BFs
\>They're suspicious about you at first due to repeated attacks by Undead going after the Bell of Awakening. Their standoffish tendencies developed because most adventurers attack them on sight, and repeated battles injured the little one's wing and removed his tail completely. They know they're not too tough in the grand scheme of things- they lack the immortality of Dragons and they can't regenerate like Undead, so they're actually somewhat careful about injuries.

\>They don't care about the bell or the prophecy of the Chosen Undead- the tower is their house, so they react to anyone that comes as if they were home invaders, and will defend it ferociously on those terms. This can get pretty cute once they like you enough to consider you a fellow resident- even if you're miles stronger than them because you've been adventuring, they'll still defend the tower and you with their lives.

\>They're fully sapient, but never had the opportunity to learn much of anything beyond the basics of fighting and survival. If you care to teach them, they'll develop new talents, but they're mostly content to just live their lives unless actively pushed to improve.

\>The shape of their mouths makes it difficult to speak human language- even if they're not feral, they very much sound it, and try to use body language to indicate what they want for fear of startling you by speaking. Expect plenty of chirps, growls, clicks, hisses, and other bestial vocalizations when they talk- you'll pick up what they mean sooner than you think.

\>They're pretty grabby in the bedroom due to their roosting instincts. As might be expected, they favor positions which can accommodate both of them- of which they know only a few. They likely see you as some sort of sex wizard when you suggest something new in bed, and will playfully compete for your nighttime affection on the regular. Keep in mind they're a package deal- they expect to share your love, no matter who "wins" their little struggles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ornstein BF:
\>Even he's not really sure what he is- a golden lion-man sticks out a fair bit among Undead and Gods. Even so, he's happy with how he looks: whatever his origins, they matter less to him than the person he's become. He's also a little bit of a show-off, wearing only a chainmail loincloth and some boots for modesty's sake.

\>Does not know how to style his fur. By default, just dunks his head in a jar of roofing sealant and shakes himself dry to get it spiked up the way he likes, to say nothing of the long red ponytail trailing down his back. Gets defensive if you accuse him of dyeing it, but will let you give him a haircut if you insist.

\>A beloved figure to the lower ranked knights in Anor Londo. Encouraging, but can overestimate both himself and others -many trainees get a nasty surprise when he tries teaching them how to split boulders with a spear. If you want to join in, expect training to take an exhibitionist turn: a simple correction to your stance can quickly turn into a "hands-on" demonstration that has him pressing his supple, masculine body into yours from behind.

\>Has no problems using his lightning powers in bed. It makes for a surprisingly relaxing massage if you're not in a lewd mood. He knows full-well that the pleasurable tingle can easily become a burn if he loses concentration, so he reserves any and all electro-stim for times when he knows he won't be interrupted.

\>As you might expect from someone whose ring raises counter damage for thrust weapons, he *really* wants you to dom him (something he learned the hard way after a chance meeting with Kalameet gave him a secret dragon fetish). He'll make you work for it, but if you learn how to push his buttons and don't back down when he gets aggressive, he will leap 30 feet into the air and land a perfect split on your dick. Okay with topping, but below average for his size; not small, but he dislikes any reminder that despite his big-dick energy, he's not packing that much heat downstairs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smough BF:
\>Morally peculiar- more of an ethical monstrosity than most of the other BFs (barring Seath). Very, very open about the fact that he eats people and grinds their bones into his food, but doesn't quite understand why it upsets anyone, or else doesn't care. After all, it's not like they're the ones getting eaten (yet). He has aspirations of knighthood, or did once upon a time, but he likes his current job as royal executioner too much to try something new. Mostly, it's just an excuse not to admit that it was the cannibalism that put Gwyn off of promoting him.

\>His personality is weirdly infectious; cheery and macabre in one odd package. Known to laugh at inappropriate times. Likewise, he tends to overshare about things he likes, whether it relates to his job, (you), or anything sexual. If you can stomach his grislier eccentricities, he's actually pretty good company and will make you laugh regularly. Just don't forget he's Chaotic Neutral- he only does as he pleases, and no mistaking it.

\>Fully embraces that he has more cushion for the pushin'. Sex with him feels decadent and intense, if you can convince him to stop just throwing his weight around and make you cum. A pillow-prince if ever there was one- he expects you to service him plenty (rimming his ass, sucking his nuts, groping his belly and moobs) before he'll be willing to return the favor. But when he does- he'll make you feel so good, it'll almost be worth trying to explain to Gwyndolin why the Cathedral is shaking. Almost.

\>Very much an opportunist, both sexually and in general. Expect him to be pushy, but mostly because he's DTF at any time if you seem even remotely interested. If he sees you with a boner, expect him to back into it right then and there. He'll happily pin you to walls, floors, or any other surface that can take the weight, just to casually show his dominance. He also gets off when you struggle, so you need to *really* make sure he knows to stop when you say so. A safe-word helps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paarthurnax BF
\>Acutely aware of his status as an outsider- a traitor to his race, and a monster to most humankind. Doesn't expect mercy, much less love from anyone, and considers you an oddity for being so fond of him. In his words: "Onikaan ni ov dovah"- Wisdom is not trusting a dragon.

\>Being alone with his thoughts for so long makes him very sociable, but also very introspective. Loves to argue and debate, and makes no secret that he enjoys talking to you about anything at all. Has a tendency to ramble in a charming old-man way, but mostly just wants you to think for yourself and understand your own feelings before you make a decision. 

\>The ongoing struggle against his own will-to-power has left him with a lot of self-doubt. Even if you get close to him, he will still ask a fair amount of time alone because he doesn't trust himself to love you. Though it may feel like he's holding you at arm's length, it's just how he is- "the curse of much knowledge is often indecision"; you should expect to take the lead when courting him if you want to get anywhere.

\>He's used to denying his appetites after having lived as a monk for so long, but is also surprisingly weak to affection; even if he can't blush, you can always tell if he's in the mood. Gets fidgety and embarrassed, or else just sinks his hindquarters into the snow so you can't see his boner. Will often joke that your time is better spent seeking love among your own kind than from an old dovah like him, even if he's head-over-heels

\>A submissive verse by choice, rather than nature. You can encourage him to dom, but you always get the sense that he's holding back no matter how rough he is- isn't named "ambition-overlord-cruelty" for nothing. However much satisfaction he gains from acting on his urges, he's always more comfortable doing sex acts that please the both of you. Likewise, gives lots of TLC after he tops: licks, 'kisses', love bites, nuzzling, etc... plus folding you up in his wings to cuddle afterward.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alduin BF:
\>Arrogant and prone to excess, but also gifted enough to back up his massive ego. He likely starts out viewing you less as a lover, and more as a slave. You may be able to change his mind with time and patience, but you'll have to go the extra mile to earn his approval, whether through submission to his will or fighting to defy his expectations. Expect compliments to be rare or indirect, but all the more noticeable because of it.

\>A dominant personality, both in and out of the bedroom. In a way, he is a victim of circumstance- he doesn't actually want to destroy the world despite being fated to do so. One could argue that he's actually helping *prevent* the apocalypse by trying to rule instead of just destroying everything- and that you're a big part of the reason he's so attached to the idea.

\>Voracious to the point of being insatiable- his stomach is made to hold the entire world (both literally and metaphorically), and his sexual hunger is no less impressive. Loves being worshiped and reveling in his own power; be sure to remind him that you don't share his godly stamina, or you'll get fucked raw every time, no matter the position. 

\>Ironically shares Paarthurnax's weakness for sensual touches despite being nigh invincible; learning how to please him rather than merely resigning yourself to be his cum-dumpster will quickly earn you special status. He'll even return the favor so long as nobody else is watching, and use his reality-warping magic to keep you going well past your limits.

\>Only after being thoroughly humiliated by the Dragonborn and abandoned by his followers will he openly reciprocate your feelings; as his chosen mate, you take a place alongside him in the realm of the gods. The goddess of love herself will plan the wedding, and Daddy Akatosh will even make you immortal to keep his wayward son motivated. Alduin will still destroy the world every so often, but only so that he can get back home to you- his world. His one and only love.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Odahviing BF
\>Doesn't particularly like either Alduin or Paarthurnax, and considers them both tyrants- has been a mere 'lieutenant' for so long that he wants to follow his own path in life and not be forced into what his superiors want. That said, he will still submit to someone he considers worthy- like (you).

\>Naturally inquisitive and enthusiastic, he loves nothing more than a good fight, and disdains those who flee from combat no matter their status (up to and including Alduin himself). However, he isn't a brute or a combat-junkie by any means- he recognized the importance of strategy, and will not pick fights he cannot win. 

\>Honorable to a fault. Even if he has good reason to be angry, he would never resort to foul play once he's given his word. Camaraderie is easy to achieve with someone so straightforward, but don't expect him to open his heart just like that. Alduin's treatment has made him guarded about who he's willing to share his innermost thoughts with- you need to demonstrate your own honor before he'll really let you in.

\>A true verse, just as eager to fuck as he is to fight. Expect him to match your demeanor note for note whether you top or bottom; he'll be gentle when you're gentle, rough when you're rough, and will delight in turning the tables on you if you should take advantage too much. Reciprocity is the order of the day. That said, he has a sensitive backside, and you can ease a lot of resistance out of him when domming if you pay proper attention to it: massaging, fingering, and rimming go a long way to a very happy, very subby dragon.

\>Wants you to experience the world as only a dragon can- whether that entails flying you from place to place, going on hunts together, or starting your campfire with his breath, he's happy as long as he gets to spend time with you. He's just as happy to learn mortal traditions that put a spin on things he'd taken for granted- cooking and flavoring his food, for example, can make him act shockingly domestic.
