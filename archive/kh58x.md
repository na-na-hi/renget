#Capitalism Ho!

Recette woke up the same way that she woke up most days; being yelled at by her assistant/friend/former debt supervisor Tear.
“For crying out- WAKE UP RECETTE!”
“G-g’morning Tear!”
“Don’t “G’mor- oh what’s the point? You’ll never get the hang of waking up on time. We’ve nearly arrived at Stardust”
“Eeh?! Already?”
Tear simply sighed. This girl would never change…

SEVERAL YEARS AGO…
“WAKE UP RECETTE!”
“Uh, G’morning Tear…”
“Don’t “G’morning” me, Recette! You have a lot of work to do today! The next debt payment is coming up, and that cargo hold of Talon equipment isn’t going to sell itself! Don’t forget, there are also the orders of Abyss scrap and Carceri Ore that are coming up, and…”

Recette zoned out as she went through the business of waking up. Tear talked the entire time, as usual, but Recette wouldn’t want her flying friend any other way. Thanks to their teamwork, “Recettear” had gone from a S47-LTM to the mightiest ship in the known universe! Yeppers, with the power of teamwork, friendliness, and capitalism, there was no limit to how far they could go! 

She finished her morning routine, dressed in her favorite yellow dress with red overalls, as she combed her hair and put in her accessories. It was her main staple of clothing back when they had started, and even though she could afford any and all clothes she could want, these made her happy (and no-one could argue with her now anyway). They had arrived at Stardust, the station at the center of the galaxy, to drop off some rich customers who had paid handsomely to ride on such a majestic ship. With pleasantries exchanged, Recette and Tear went off to examine what capitalist opportunities were present on the station. Escorting them were Archangel and Styx, whom Recette had insisted on pairing with each other at every opportunity ever since she found out there was bad blood between their “factions”. There were countless parties who were interested in meeting with the captain and owner of a Mothership-Class ship, but the presence of two such legendary soldiers meant they were wise enough to keep their distance. The other two of the legendary Horsemen of the Apocalypse were responsible with defending the ship; they had long since learned it was a good idea to always have their ship/home defended. 
Tear was handling as many of the requests for meetings as she could, but even with major assistance from the vast computational power of the Recettear, there were so many that she was barely able to keep on top of them. What was Recette’s priority? The confectionery stores, of course!
