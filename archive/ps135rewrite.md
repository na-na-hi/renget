# PS135 Rewrite
Luigi is awoken from his deep slumber by a hammer being thrown through his window. Examining the hammer, he notices a letter attached to the side of it.

"Your presence has been requested at King Koopa's castle effective tonight. Non-attendance will be punished by the King's fury."

Not wishing to upset Bowser, Luigi quickly makes his way towards his castle. As he finally makes it to the front of the building, the bright neon lights almost blinding him, he begins to have doubts as to whether this truly was a good idea to walk right up to the castle of his arch-enemy. Before being able to finish his thought he's immediately confronted by various koopas forcefully pushing him towards Bowser's throne. As he's dragged closer and closer to the throne sweat begins to pour down his face as he realizes how awful of a decision he just made.

Right as Bowser begins to speak Luigi rushes down to his knees, Italian gibberish coming out his mouth and tears moving down his eyes as he begs to be spared. 

"I always knew that Mario was a coward but you're even worse! The L on your cap truly does stand for loser! Bwah hah hah!"

As Bowser erupts with a grand cackle over what had just occurred Luigi begins to stand up as he recognizes the actual situation at hand. Bowser finishes his elongated laugh before continuing with the rest of his speech.

"As much as it pleases me picking on you numbskulls and the little idiosyncrasies of the super sissy bros I've actually invited you here to discuss an issue pertinent to the two of us. As shocking as it may be to you Green Mario there are others besides you and your equally moronic nimrod brother who pester me. This current nuisance is of a completely different variety to you, idiot #2, and your brother, idiot #1: He managed to capture both Peach and Mario.

Luigi's face again reverts back to its previous state of uncontrollable worry. He thought about how he should have tagged along Mario's journey days ago rather than stay at home.

"Now of course, though it does bring me great joy to hear of Mario's capture and I applaud this creature's cunningness in doing so, even now I still find solace in a world where I am no longer pestered by pudgy plumbers such as him and you, my main issue lies in his capturing of the princess. Does he not know that she rightfully belongs to me, the Great Bowser?"

Bowser's face begins to turn hot red and steam starts to emit from his nostrils. Luigi takes a few cautionary steps back.

"That's where you come along Luis. The Koopa Kingdom is willing to help you with the rescuing of my rightful property in exchange for the Koopa King himself looking the other way if Mario happens to return as well. Does that sound fair?"

Luigi quickly attempts to regain his composure to extend a hand over to Bowser but before doing so is interrupted.

"Just kidding! Did you genuinely think that I was gonna give you a choice? That's hilarious!"

Bowser again bursts into heavy laughter, the sound startling even his minions and further scaring Luigi.

"The only choice you have is either leaving right now to go save my princess or being fed to my chain-chomps. I've already had my Koopalings do reconnaissance, they've found traces of the two leading into the Forest of Illusions. You'll be transported over to the entrance of that forest at which point the only reason you'll be permitted to come back is because you've brought back what's mine."

Luigi, though fearful over the ginormous task that now awaits him, continues listening to Bowser's instructions.

"Who knows? Maybe it's tremendously idiotic of me to trust the bigger pushover of the Mushroom Kingdom's dimwitted duo, so far though I see nothing wrong with my genius plan. Worst case scenario the news of you failing will bring endless entertainment to me for years to come. Bye bye Greenio!"

Bowser waves Luigi away, struggling to hold in his laughter as his minions take Luigi away from his throne.

As Luigi is led towards the entrance of the Forest of Illusions he wonders what'll happen once he actually enters. Who is this person that managed to capture both Mario and Peach? Will he be able to find the two of them? Is it possible for him to learn about geography this time as well?

Either way, regardless of how bleak the task ahead looks, he's determined to save the both of them.
