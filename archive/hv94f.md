#####Intro
Dirt Rally 2.0 works well with either a controller or a wheel, there are wheel recommendations in the Assetto guide if you're interested.
It's recommended to get the Game of the Year edition since the DLC is pretty expensive if bought separately, and the full bundle only costs a couple bucks more when the game is on sale.

#####Club Details
Current club link is here: https://dirtrally2.dirtgame.com/clubs/club/446076
Events typically last for two weeks, reminders are posted in the thread if you're not sure when the current event is ending

#####Fixes
The eye accomodation fix helps with some brightness issues the game has in VR.
Default behavior for the fix includes a fix for vegetation dithering that can cause vegetation to flicker instead if your MSAA isn't set to 4x in video settings, if you run into flickering issues, you can set overrideVegetationAtoC=0 in the dr2vrfix.config file in the game folder.
