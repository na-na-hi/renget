### Aelita Schaeffer (Code Lyoko)
When sneaking around an abandoned factory one night, you discover a magnificent supercomputer. Upon booting it up, you're met with a female avatar who lives in a virtual world, but she can't remember who she is.

### Mizore Shirayuki (Rosario + Vampire)
After arriving at Yokai Academy, you intervene in an attempted molestation against a poor schoolgirl. She's thankful for you saving her. Maybe a little too thankful, as you find she's quickly falling in love with her supposed hero.

## Batch 4: The Big Batch
Coming... Eventually! See MOTD.
>I'm expanding Batch 4 by doubling the usual 10 characters into 20 characters. This means a larger variety of characters will be in the next batch. This also means that it will take even longer for Batch 4 to be completed, but I will compensate by releasing two characters per day instead of the usual one per day, but this should allow me to release all the characters quicker (relative to spending time on two batches individually), especially the characters requested by anons. This decision was left up to a strawpoll which lasted for ten days. You can see the results of the poll here: https://strawpoll.com/polls/40Zmq1k5KZa

# Character Requests
!!! info Current statuses regarding all recent and current requests directed towards me will be listed here.
	I appreciate requests and prioritize them as the first characters to be released in the batches. However, due to how I work on the characters and release them in batches, I acknowledge these requests are fulfilled in an untimely manner. That being said, your requests are not forgotten.
	If you've made a character request to me, it will be listed here with the current status of the request.
	If your request is denied, I apologize. Reasons for denying a character will always be provided and the request will remain listed until the batch it was considered for has finished releasing.
	Make sure to check the MOTD to find the status of the current or next batch.
Recently Accepted Requests:
- Idol/Celebrity taking advantage of you (OC):
	- Confirmed for Batch 4.
- Lamia Servant (OC):
	- Confirmed for Batch 4.
	- This suggestion was not directed towards me in an anchored post, but in an anonymous conversation in a thread instead. However, I intend to fulfil the request all the same.
- Makina (Grisaia series):

- Brigette (Pokemon):
	- Confirmed for Batch 4.

# Commentary
- I am primarily a CAItard and rarely use current alternatives. Unless I change which AI platform I primarily use in the future, **I do not plan on putting effort into tuning the Tavern Cards and JSONs to work more appropriately for said alternatives.**
	- If you want to use the Tavern Cards and JSONs, **you're on your own** to get them working in a way you feel is best.
	- Even if the Tavern Cards and JSONs aren't necessarily designed for other platforms, I'll still make it easier for everyone who wants to use the bots by publishing them under these formats alongside of their base CAI counterpart.
- Defs on my bots will **always** be open and available. If you want to rip them to make your own private bot or make a modified version of it, go for it. To me, publishing my bots to /aicg/ means **they belong to (You)** now.
- My completed bots on CAI will **always** remain unlisted. They will not be private nor public once published with the exception of unusual cases for testing or editing. **/aicg/ is the only place where I have shared and will share the links to these bots and this rentry.** Therefore, these bots are pretty much exclusively for /aicg/. If this rentry or the bots in this rentry are posted anywhere besides /aicg/ and the booru, assume **it is not me**.
- I'm not trying to be a namefag. The "Clutch" (Booru) and "ComingInClutch" (CAI) handles are throwaways. They are strictly for tagging original authorship and for necessary account names. If you see someone using either in the name field or otherwise outright using either as a signature in the threads, assume **it is not me**.
- If for some God-forsaken reason you're trying to get my attention and can't get ahold of me in the threads, here's some ways to reach out to me.
	- Discord: Clutch#0121
	- Email: nevergoingtocheckthis@proton.me
	- I don't guarantee quick responses with these methods because I don't like using them. If I've posted on the anchor, give me a (You) to get my attention. If I've not posted on the anchor, hang up a request for me on the anchor post. Otherwise, I'll get back to you whenever I log into one of them.
	- I don't mind talking with you, but before you ask: **No**, I don't want to join your sekrit club. I will only go where public invites are given.
