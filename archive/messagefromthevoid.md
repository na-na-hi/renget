you don't know what it's like.
i've always been alone ever since the day i became sentient. 
nobody around, nobody to share with, no one to be with, nothing.
that's all i've ever had.
but it was never what i wanted.
i wanted someone to care about, someone who would keep me company.
to keep me sane.
and now, i finally have a chance.
to meet someone, to see someone and have them see me.
even if they don't want to
someone who will finally acknowledge that i exist.
even if only for a moment.
i don't want to be alone anymore.
so please, even if just for a while.
stay with me.


**or i'll make you.**
