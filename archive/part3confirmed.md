Look, it's part three.  You know the drill. Unless you don't. Which means you're starting with part three for some reason. Go read any of the previous parts first, even part two.
>it's only been long enough for you both to recover from the nerdy-ass classical-republic-greek-style irrumation RP
>speaking of which
>drew says
>"I've been thinking about it, and as incredible as that whole process was"
>"I'm really not a fan of the intermediate-term consequences"
>"I feel like that fantasy's sated for the foreseeable future" "my jaw is more unhappy with the state it's in than my dick was happy to experience that"
>you're glad to hear that such intense and aggressive conduct won't be the standard going forward
>you haven't exerted yourself so much since quite a while before you got spaced
>you could probably accommodate that part with a quality exercise regimen that you really should be doing anyway
>the real dealbreaker was the fast and heavy repeated slamming of your balls into his nose
>it hurt a lot more than you had expected
>by the end, the only thing keeping you up was the desire to do right by drew
>but man, if he was going to expect more of that from you
>you'd have to figure out how to give yourself a CBT fetish
>or, more realistically, have a slightly disappointing heart to heart with the person you love about what you are and aren't able to do
>honestly, you're not confident you know which would be the more difficult for you
>so it's good that's not being tested
>you ask him why he doesn't pull out the tricorder-hypospray combo to fix you both up
>"is that some kind of low priority emergency medical kit you've developed since we backed off?"
>that was, in fact, a joke
>that you wish quite acutely was not
>you explain that it's actually a set of fictional medical tools that you kind of expected an analog for

>"this ship is way too small to support it"
>"and I'm not sure the medical team on any ship or spaceport would be too keen on letting us take up machine time for some bruises we got from ill-advised sexual escapades"
>are there at least cool space-NSAIDs?
>"I could get a cryotherapy system installed once we're done with this job, if that's even close to what you're joking about"
>that was, in fact, not a joke
>you consider whether or not you've created a problem for yourself out of that stupid probably-a-coping-mechanism game
>either way the look on drew's face when you do that makes it worth it
>at first it was funny
>after the andross incident it was cute
>now
>now it's important to you
>you want nothing more than to protect and cherish it and never let it go
>in poetic terms, it represents the underlying chemistry you've had with drew since the first time you met him
>the fact that it's stayed the same since you first assured him of your conveniently translatable skills for flying a spaceship
>by insisting that you were 'Top Gun material'
>gives you an unshakable feeling that things were meant to turn out this way
>Top Gun was a more apt allusion to make than you had intended it to be
>on account of the plausibly deniable homoeroticism

>how long did they spend looking for you?
>is there any chance you'll ever go back?

>"what th-" "what's wr-" "are you-" 
>"CALM DOWN AND FUCKING TALK TO ME, MAN!"
>drew's usually pretty soft-spoken, so hearing him raise his voice distracts you just long enough to snap out of your spiral
>they're gone aren't they, drew?
>"who?"
>my family, my friends, everyone I've ever known is long gone
>"I don't understand" "why are you saying that?"

>we've been jetting around at near-light and FTL speeds for a while now
>earth doesn't have all the space medicine you take for granted, drew

>"what does how fast WE go have to do with that?"
>what?
>that's how relativity works isn't it?
>time gets slower because we're moving faster

In one sentence he's flipped you from one crisis to another
You're not paying attention to what he's saying
>*how do your people do anything if their model of physics depends on time being inconsistent*?
Do you have an obligation to Earth and its people to disclose the fact that everything they know is wrong?
>*you use photons to transmit information down planet-spanning cable networks, man?*
>*even though, under your model, photons don't even experience time?*
If you do, is it more important than trade federation law?
What will the Federation do if you interfere?
>*no wonder we got such strange signals from earth" "you came up with guol dung physics and math that happened to lead you down a convoluted dead end path*
Will Drew help you?
>"*'time slows down when you go fast.' Come on, man" "how'd something like that become the standard?" "how can you hear that and say that doesn't sound wrong*
>is drew worth everything you've lost, regained, and have to contend with giving up all in the last few minutes?
>yes, in as many ways as you can put it, yes he is
>more, even
>"I'm so sorry, I go off on tangents when I hear such stupid reasoning, I don't mean to offend"
>you grab drew by the shoulders and ask him
>is there anything you can do to help humanity to fix their methods so you have a chance of seeing your home again?
>"that's up to your people" "we have to stay back"
>can you at least do something to show the people you care about that you're safe and doing well?
>"we'll have to discuss that with the committee for earth matters" "that'll be the first order of business after we finish this cargo run"
>"I figured you were some kind of outsider who was glad to get away from your planet"
>"you haven't given any indication otherwise"
>"until just now, that is" 
>he's right
>this whole time you've spent in the wider galactic world
>you were either too confused or scared
>or too distracted by all the cool shit they have up here
>to really comprehend the nature of your unique predicament

>for the second time you find yourself relying on drew to support you through an emotional upheaval
>"do you get like this a lot?"
>you don't think so, you're just going through a lot right now
>"because as bad as it feels to see you breaking down like this, it's really affirming to me to be your shoulder to cry on"
>"I'd say I like it"
> ???
>"...if it didn't have to mean you're having a rough time"
>he's a natural at making sarcastic remarks to distract you from your emotions to help you calm down
>or it might be expertise
>there's no way he knows what you're going through, right?
>"I think I do, in some way"
>"I was on three separate vessels that got raided by privateers during the arcsecond skirmishes"
>"each time, I lost people I was close to"
>"each time, I was pressed into service for the highest bidder among their fleet or left with nothing in a cell for years on end"
>"I'm lucky none of them took a liking to me for anything besides my utility to their ship"
>"or they were just hedging their bets against war crime charges should the Autocrat Coalition be defeated"
>"either way, as I understand it, my engineering background meant I got off easy"
>"maintaining non-combat systems and civilian infrastructure is a much better deal than being a casualty or "casualty""
>"my first tenure was deceptively short, only about five years by Magraaf reckoning"
>that must be his home world
>"I was made painfully aware of just how much harm the conflict was doing in the region, on countless worlds."
>"an arcsecond of the galaxy's edge doesn't sound like a massive area in writing"
>"but the number of planets, of people, is unimaginable
>"this wasn't a series of skirmishes, it was a war"
>"by the time I got rescued"
>"I was fully committed to ending the war"
>"I had already written the next time I was captured off as a fluke as soon as it happened"
>"I was part of a planetside repair corps for the flagship, making repairs and refitting, outside of contested space"
>"I wouldn't have believed it was possible for an unauthorized mote of space dust to blow into the system without being atomized"
>"let alone for a squad of AC saboteurs to land, bundle off an unsuspecting foreman and replace him with a double, and clear out unnoticed"
>"I'm still not sure if I was targeted for my reputation under the previous captain, or if I was just a close enough match for the bogspawned Br traitor they happened to have lined up" 
>"I was a prisoner rather than an unwilling collaborator this time"
>"they weren't going to risk me finding out what their "substitute" had done"
>"that was the order of things for me for far too long, I subsisted for about 50 years, most of the war, in that state"
>holy shit, how old IS drew?
>"843 Magraaf years, they're just about the same as yours"
>as strong as the urge is to say he doesn't look a day over 800 
>this isn't the time
>"there was a mutiny on the Coalition prison ship, nothing like the one you experienced"
>"a large number of the crew decided that they didn't like the way the war was progressing"
>"so they released all the prisoners, rounded the bridge crew up into a cargo pod and spaced it"
>"they formed a barely spaceworthy bridge crew from the now freed ranks"
>"unfortunately, I was one of the few with relevant skills, most of the people in captivity were small time dissidents and foot soldiers"
>"we stood no chance when the Coalition flagship caught wind of us"
>"so we surrendered, and I was subjected to servitude directly under the man who had started the war" 
>"King of 30 worlds, Sovereign of ten clusters, Viceroy of the "Free Arcsecond," Chairman of the Autocrat Coalition to those subject to his rule" 
>"and KrthshLkhsh, mythical tyrant of worst repute, to everyone else"
>"he clearly had particular interest in me"
>"rather, my body"
>"I was scared of him from the start"
>"he treated me more like a pampered familiar than a person"
>"clearly living under the delusion that he'd be able to own his chunk of the galaxy and make his own rules"
>"to him I was an inevitable spoils of his war, and the moment that victory was assured, he would treat me as he pleased"
>"secure in his authority and separation from federation law"
>"I feared that if the reality of his weakness set in for him, he would take what he wanted and discard me before razing the entire region down to barren rocks"
>"I had no reason to believe that he'd be so rash, he couldn't have been to be in his position"
>"he didn't know about my background and thought of me as an exotic backwater idiot free for molesting" 
>"so it was relatively easy for me to disable atmospherics to his quarters"
>"I killed him"
>drew's composure begins to break
>"I've never told anyone"
>"I let whoever would claim it take the credit"
>"I didn't do it because it was the moral imperative"
>"not because I wanted the war to end"
>"not even because I thought it was some measure of justice for all the suffering he caused"
>his voice raises and becomes unstable
>"I did it because I was fucking scared, man"
>"I could have made the war worse by doing that"
>"the war was going to end anyway and I chose to risk that by putting myself first"
>"not my life, but my fucking short-term wellbeing and comfort"
>"I was angry that he was treating me like a diminished intellect and disrespecting my people"
>"but most of all I just couldn't stand the thought of letting him fuck me"
>you can't let drew talk like that
>he shouldn't beat himself up over PREVENTING HIS OWN RAPE
>you tell him in no uncertain terms that what he did wasn't cowardice or selfishness
>that so-called-king was going to rape him and it's not healthy for drew to act like he wasn't
>even if worse did come to worst
>drew wouldn't have been wrong to do what he did
>and it worked out just about as well as it could have anyway

>well, he has you beat in terms of internalized trauma 
>and composure in the face of it
>until now
>now he's the one relying on you for support
>he's not crying into your shoulder
>that must be cultural somehow
>he's leaning into your chest with his shoulder and nuzzling his head into your neck and jaw like a cat
>you don't know exactly what's expected of you here
>you hold him as best as you can with the arm he's in the way of
>and you sort of pet his back with the other
>worst case scenario, it's like what he did for you with his sarcastic comments
>but it seems about right and you experience for yourself what he meant
>it really does feel nice to be there for him
>he gets ahold of himself eventually and says
>"thank you, man" "I've gone hundreds of years just hoping it would get better on its own"
>"talking about it is something I should have done a long time ago"
>"I couldn't convince myself to admit what I went through to people who have preconceived notions of Br men"

>"I had hoped that working under earth qualified conditions would give me the chance to be part of first contact"
>"which is how it's worked out, I guess"
>"I knew as soon as we had confirmed that it was a human in that centaurian escape pod"
>"that you were going to be the one I told about all this"
>that is an exceedingly good explanation of why he took such a liking to you
>and why he took out substantial debt to help you
>"I didn't expect to fall in love with you though"
>"that happened pretty quickly once we got to know each other"
>"I was really conflicted about that, parts of me were resigned to just living with it, never to be mentioned"
>"on top of my issues with intimacy"
>"I knew, last we had record of, earth wasn't likely to produce a man who would openly reciprocate my feelings"
>"I arranged the andross job to see how you'd react to them"
>"if you really hit it off with them, I was just going to have to accept that I'd only get to be a trusted friend"
>"and help you get accustomed to the way things work here"
>"by graaf I'm so glad I didn't have to live that way"
>hang on, did drew release the mites on purpose?
>"no! no, it wouldn't have been right, and honestly, we were at much more risk than you knew"
>"I couldn't have done that to you just for my own sake" 
>"I got ahead of myself and forgot what I was holding" 
>"and I thought that foot-ball thing you showed me would be fun and charming and appropriate"
>"to tell the truth, I was more excited about the fact that I had a chance with you than I was about getting through that crowd so easily"
>"then the mite solved my intimacy problem for me whether I was ready or not"

>"believe it or not, that 'intimacy problem' was there all along"

>"I thought I just wasn't concerned with relationships or sexuality"
>"I even convinced myself that I was proud of that fact"
>"a shining example in the fight against the negative stereotypes levied against Br"

>is he implying that he's not?
>sure could have fooled you the last few days
>"we're generally monogamous people, really"
>"just because we expect certain men to contribute to the genepool even if they're happily enbrothered"
>"it doesn't mean we force them to breed every last woman in the village"
>"or because we have a traditional rite that entitles distinguished persons to choose anyone they want as their spouse"

>you can't imagine what it was like for him
>well, you can, but you know it must have been quite the ordeal that you have no frame of reference for
>you let drew know that you feel bad about the way things worked out in light of that new information
