# /aids/ — AI Dynamic Storytelling General
## ->The Chat Rentry<-

->Interested in using AI models in a chat format? Or maybe you've heard of **SillyTavern**, **Claude**, or **GPT-4** and wanted more information about them and accessing them. This rentry exists as a list of resources for chatbots and chat models. Keep in mind that /aids/ is by no means the go-to place for *all* things chat. Please consider visiting the [AI Chatbot General (/aicg/)](https://boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=aicg) for more information.<-

### SillyTavern
https://sillytavernai.com/

SillyTavern is an open-source chat frontend and likely THE frontend you will be recommended by both Anons on /aids/ and Anons on /aicg/. It's a featureful fork of [TavernAI](https://github.com/TavernAI/TavernAI) with far too many things to list here that make it head-and-shoulders better than its predecessor.

SillyTavern is installed locally—you need to run one of the provided scripts in the directory where you installed it to set up a local server that you can access through your browser.

[Consider reading their documentation for more information.](https://docs.sillytavern.app/)

### AgnAIstic
https://agnai.chat/

AgnAIstic is another chat frontend that does not need to be installed and run locally. You can use it from their hosted website, though be warned, using proxies with AgnAIstic is a bit of a mixed bag. Some proxies might have measures placed against you for using it. Also, most jailbreaks expect you to use SillyTavern, which has unique features that AgnAIstic may not have.

The 'legitimate' way to use them. Expect no privacy, and model refusals.

### Locust Proxies (Use with Caution)
GUIDE: https://locustproxies.neocities.org/

Proxies forward API calls you send to them to the LLMs they have keys for. They are an /aicg/ thing, but if you want to use GPT-4 and other SOTA premium models without paying, you'll likely be using a reverse proxy.

While it's believed that you're not liable for any legal action simply by using them, **using a VPN is recommended if you're able**. And don't forget, your context still ends up in the clutches of OpenAI et. al., which means you've forfeited any expectation of privacy and logging on their end is pretty much guaranteed. This isn't even accounting for the proxy itself, which can enable logging of its own.

**In short, don't be stupid and put sensitive information in your chat logs.** Once you've set up, you're likely going to want to use a Jailbreak to bypass model refusals, and again, [/aicg/ has resources for that.](https://boards.4chan.org/g/catalog#s=aicg)
