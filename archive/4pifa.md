Something felt odd when Nikolai awoke, an absence of heat from fur. Thank God for that, but now he wondered why the room was warmer.As though the cabin itself were revitalized and homely, strange. Did they fix that old heating vent? No, it was gone, so where would this be coming from? The only noise was something outside his cabin so presumably someone realized sending a werewolf to cuddle him wasn't very ideal for either party.

"Rise and shine, hunter."

Right. Dominic the irritatingly frequent alpha, why would he have a sudden spring of generosity?

"It's...it's Nikolai," he stood up and slowly walked to the door, feeling slightly more capable though some pain still lingered.

"Sure, sure. Anywho, it's the Christmas season, and I just so happened to be getting my pack proper heating. Your other caretaker insisted on getting you one too."

"Liar. That wolf wants to be my friend, and you despise that."

"Ah, you picked up on that. Fine, walked in last night on that romantic little thing between you and Adam. I gotta say, for a guy giving us all the cold shoulder you sure did cuddle up easily to my packmate. Y'know, for a seemingly cold hunter."

"Adam offered to do it. I only did it for survival. But if I knew you would get me heating sooner, I'd have let him do it sooner."

"But you didn't know, and intending on your survival doesn't mean shit. I'm not gonna let him keep doing that, he thinks you're just some rinky dink guy that was out of his league, and he's right to a degree. But I know what you would've done if our other human wasn't there. And you would've justified it with some sorta lesson you learned back at the exorcising headquarters, right?"

What?! How did-

"Yeah, I know. I escaped one of those camps. People lose their inner wolf, and all because you bastards took footage of one angry werewolf fighting back and present that as if we're feral beasts. Now, I should admit, maybe I was a little cruel to keep you in sub zero temperatures for a few weeks. Think of this as humane treatment so I don't violate any laws regarding werewolves imprisoning dipshit hunters. In fewer words, don't mistake this for any fondness."

"I wouldn't," he glared back at the old wolf.

"Good. Oh, and you've been on surprisingly good behavior, I'll let you take showers now. Adam will accompany you, there's no windows or anything to escape from. That is, none you can fit through. Don't think of trying to run away, we got our own wolves to hunt you down if you do."

The alpha stepped out and into the snowy weather, summoning his other warden with a snap of his fingers. Adam smiled and waved, or at least it looked as though his wolf form did. One hand held a sweater for him, the other was a bag bundled with what looked to be his change of clothes. Right down to the winter boots, even.

Dominic muttered something quiet enough for only his packmate, a glare being the only departing thing to say goodbye to his prisoner. Goodbye was too fond of a thing to say, it was more a threat to kill in his eyes. 

No hesitation.

Now that he was gone, the much more tolerable presence of Adam lessened the air of tension.

"Hey! I know it's cold out, so you'll be wearing this while we walk to the locker room. I brought you some clothes too, I don't know if they're too big but a belt will tighten the pants. Oh, and I like this shampoo, it brings out a really nice smell. I-"

"Your alpha, he said you told him to fix my heating."

"Yup!", Adam nodded, his ears perked up, "Before you ask why, I got into it with him about your cabin being so cold. We're trying to prove something here, y'know?"

Prove what, exactly? Nikolai knew he was essentially just their hostage but Adam wasn't smart enough to comprehend that. Oh, how woefully naive the wolf was, to think they could coexist peacefully. That being said, the repeated interventions reaffirmed his desire to take out the demon spirit in him. How he held onto his human emotion was beyond him.

Questions that could be answered later, he concluded. Fabric brushed his shoulder as a paw offered something, oh right, the sweater suited for the freezing temperatures awaiting him on their walk to the showers. Not in his current state, however. He set it aside, trying to leave until the wolf stood squarely between him and the door.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"I'm not putting that on and getting my grime mixed into the fabric.

"I have more sweaters, werewolf size sweaters, please put it on? So you're not suffering in the snow?", he asked with... concerned eyes. Odd.

Fine. Weird that Adam was looking out for him. Surviving the walk wouldn't be a difficult hurdle, however briefly he'd need to trek through the snow. For the sake of getting a hot shower and appeasing his captor, he obeyed. The wolf gave a polite "after you" motion and let him step into his first bit of freedom in a month.

The cabin itself was mostly bare, an old couch in the corner and old magazines on a coffee table. A kitchen too, though the stove was by no means modern and seemed to be caked in dust. The television looked like the kind teachers rolled in on a movie day. It'd probably last been renovated in the early nineties, if he'd had to guess. Despite that he could tell the foundation was solid, no leaks, no cold coming in unless the door was open, with a bit of spare change it could be something worthwhile.

Ugh, Stockholm Syndrome.

Chilling wind met him as he opened the front, biting at his face and piercing through ill suited jeans. No blizzard on the upside of things, a thick layer of snow leftover to walk through. It crunched beneath his boots as he followed Adam closely. Nearby came some growls, he'd hoped otherwise but their alpha wasn't bluffing about a wolf pack accompanying them. The beasts stayed their ground, only due to Adam shooing them away.

"Stay close to me," the wolf said as he pulled him upfront.

Old cabins became clearer as they passed more trees, barks and other noises filling the air. In the middle of it all was a moderately sized and heavily decorated Christmas tree, real pine and all. The square was filled with the pack, rambunctious and pouncing upon each other. Wrestling wasn't the only activity to be enjoyed by the wolves. Snowball fights, snow… werewolf angels, snowmen, why go through all this trouble to fool him? Playing in the middle of winter right after a blizzard? As if anyone could believe this farce.

Wait, in the distance was…

Oh, the other human sitting with a wolf, a brown-furred one, thank god he was alright! They shared an oversized mug fit for a larger individual, and if he was right then it was very hot chocolate. Brown, as he'd call him, suddenly sniffed the air and whipped his head at him with venomous intent. The short human noticed too and hid away, mood ruined by the stranger that only seeked to rescue him. Silence had closed in on the two in mere seconds.

The sentiment was more or less the same among the rest, who closed ranks and even growled like their feral pets. Hmph, as if he'd want to willingly put himself here, surrounded by monsters and healing from his wounds. Adam gripped him by the arm and hurried along through the party. Up ahead he could barely make out a faded sign: R..cre..tio..al show..rs, the other letters torn away with time.

As they approached old steps, one wolf blocked their path. Tall, black fur tinted with yellow at points, obviously intending to start a scuffle. And Nikolai would have been more than willing to kick his haughty, mutt ass if he weren't recovering from his fight with the alpha. Until then, averting his eyes and being slow was all to do against it.

"I will say this one time, I don't think it needs repeating: You so much as lay a smack on Adam and I'll fucking kill you," it lowly growled.

"Noted," he bitterly replied, insulted that they thought he would do that.

"Better be. Hey, you need help making sure he won't try climbing out a window?", it said in a warmer tone to his guardian.

"It's ok Shane! I can make sure he doesn't run off."

"Yeah. Not like he'd get very far in those brittle bones."

'Stand tall', those words were ingrained in his mind from his superiors, be brave in hard times. And though fear filled him, he knew even the bravest were afraid, and he wasn't one to back down. With one confident step forward he challenged the mutt to step aside. It growled and made its own step, one paw down on his foot enough to put pressure and remind him of his injuries. In another reckless move he stepped on his other paw, curling up his fists-

"HEY!", Adam almost barked out, the word just discernible in the noise.

"Calm down. He's not looking for a fight, are you?", Adam slowly pulled him back, signaling Shane to back off.

It growled, and gave a grumpy whine akin to a dog not having its way. Nothing else was said of it as the two walked up the creaky staircase, yet another needed renovation on his mental list. Funny, Adam having a sense of honor not to incite attacks on his injured prisoner. And from their viewpoint they would have reason enough to do so. He, a trespasser already who insulted them by attending their party and readying himself to fight if need be.

The locker room was slightly chilly but warm enough to take bundled clothes off. Playful yips picked back up outside now that it wasn't soured by his presence. As if he needed to join in on their freezing festivities, the stupid beasts.

Inside lied three rows of back-to-back lockers, none of them locked when he tested. Adam said nothing as he prepared a towel, shampoo, and any other necessities. Oh, even a toothbrush and floss, was all this from... him? He couldn't imagine their alpha caring beyond a clean set of clothes.

"You just turn the spigot to the right for hot!"

Yes, as most showers operate but the instructions were appreciated.

The showers were empty for which he said thanks to whoever made sure of that. He chose a showerhead next to the arch way, so no one could see him on the far end. Privacy wasn't given to him anymore, and taking away this would be humiliating. It was thirty or so seconds before it managed to get warm, not hot, but he'd take it. Oh, how relieving it felt to wash away the weeks of buildup in his hair and skin. Soap hadn't even been applied yet and already this felt like an improvement.

God, it felt great to lather up his hair in shampoo. Tropical sunset smell, which essentially meant a fruit blend of citrus and a few others. The first wash of it was to clean it, the second just to be thorough and appreciate the fine smell. Next was his back and backside, easy-

"Fuck!", he quietly let out. Pain coursed through his shoulder from the attempt.

Once more just a simple reach-around and… ow, ow owowow. Not one, but both shoulder joints throbbed badly, an injury he didn't know was still healing or even aware of. So much for his smooth recovery. His front could still be washed but otherwise, it'd still be somewhat gross on his back.

Some cruel joke from the universe, he could reach under himself but not behind.

"Nick?"

Fuck! He almost slipped if it wasn't for Adam catching him. Damn it, damn it, he didn't want anyone to see him exposed like this.

"I heard you yell, are you alright?"

The wolf wasn't treating this funny at all. Or even looking him over just because he had an opportunity. Adam was genuinely concerned.

Why?

"I can't wash my back right, or my.. butt. Shoulder kicks up badly if I try."

"Oh! Well.. do you want help?"

"Help?"

The wolf's eyes brightened in a pleading way, friendly. Fate had a funny way of pranking him like this. End the shower now and feel dirty or let the wolf wash your ass off because you're too hurt to take care of yourself. A frustrated sigh let out as he reluctantly turned himself around for the wolf.

"Just… be quick," he said somewhat curtly to him.

"No worries, I'm not gonna touch you in a weird way. Sorry about your shoulders, oh and let me know if I touch any bad spots, ok?"

Good then.

Adam proceeded to scrub away the buildup, or at least made sure to get what hadn't been cleansed already. Slow, careful, and at one point he was held just above the waist in order to be sure the wolf couldn't knock him aloof. Nikolai found himself lost in his thoughts, feeling like an object for someone else to touch.

In fairness Adam was cleaning him respectfully, that is not groping him or being sensual. Still, having him wipe back there was nothing less than humiliating. All in all the ordeal only lasted a minute as he washed off the suds to be sure of it. In the midst of his assisted shower he heard a bright humming, despite the less than appropriate circumstances. It was not something he jumped on the chance for, nor was his captor someone he'd normally want to do this.

"All done!", the wolf said as he smiled.

Nikolai nodded to him, grateful for the help but nothing more.

"I might as well wash off too, can you wait over there so I can keep an eye on you?"

"Fine," he grumbled out.

The far wall seemed as good as any to stay put and stay away from him. Sharing spaces like this had never been a casual affair for him. Body issues weren't the concern, more of a privacy matter as he was raised to share it with someone he trusted. Not just any old floozy from a bar or club, a woman to settle down with and raise some kids.

Such a woman hadn't come into his life yet, probably to do with his resting face. Colleagues at the academy for hunting and exorcising had often asked if he felt particularly bad. More often than not he was thinking of what to do later, laundry, mundane stuff, the scowl wasn't the result of a bad day, it just *was*.

Oh, Adam had finished up while he rambled to himself. A friendly smile lit up the muzzle as he beckoned him along with his massive paw. Nikolai almost immediately chose the farther end of a bench and dug around his bag. God, it was great to feel clean and have clean clothes after so long. Adam changed into some puffy winter pants, but no shirt as the fur would do.

"You ok?", Adam asked.

"Fine," came his reply.

"You always look so sad."

"Try having no shower for two months, see how that affects your mood."

"Oh.. sorry," his ears flattened from the remark.

"You… you're not responsible for it, your alpha is. In fact you're a very kind werewolf, Adam. I shouldn't have gotten angry with you."

"No it's ok! I could've tried bringing you a hot bucket and soap."

Tried, yes, that being Dominic would've refused to let him. If it weren't for Adam he'd probably still be freezing, and filthy. He'd done a lot more than what he was aware of, even if he thought less.

As the hunter dressed he noticed Adam putting on his own outfit, a white shirt and a vest with black jeans, and a plain red cap. Odd, the other wolves were either underdressed or not at all. Maybe he preemptively got ready for a visit outside the pack?

"Let's get back to the cabin, I know a way around them."

They left via a back door, through a trail behind the cabins and linking back up to his. One other wolf and his feral pet passed by, though it ignored the two and went along. That'd take some getting used to, seeing all the wolves out and about with their more intelligent masters. 

Assuming he would be getting more freedoms, of course. 'Good behavior' his ass, the alpha probably knew already but he would be polite and peaceful up until he found a viable escape. With a bit of convincing Adam could even help him, leave these beasts behind so they wouldn't corrupt him.

"Ok, so Dominic didn't say but today is Christmas! I thought I'd give you a few gifts since no one else is."

….Gifts.

Set in front of him were a few of said things poorly wrapped and not as concealed as they usually were. One was a small, rectangular box with a grip of a mug to it. The next was the familiar look of a shirt wrapped up, any adult knew the type of packaging. Lastly was a thin case that unmistakably felt like a DVD, the TV and player nearby all but confirming that. In fact there was a coffee machine next to the sink and a cylinder of cocoa powder. Hm. No subtlety but the gifts were gifts.

Adam kept his concentration on watching him unwrap everything, and so he slowly undid the first of three as if he couldn't tell. Wow, a whole mug for him? How could he have guessed.

Yippee.

'Best hunter ever' emblazoned on the side.

Oh.

"I know Dominic locked you up but I thought you might like this."

Said hunter wasn't sure how to take it and why he'd compliment that particular aspect of him. Well, now that he took a look at it the mug wasn't too small or oversized. Perfect for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate if he earned those. The wolf's ears perked up to his smile as he judged it.

"Th-thank you," he managed to say.

"No problem! Ok next gift," Adam excitedly shoved the bundle to him.

Clothes, yes, traditional shirt? Not exactly. A sweater as orange as his own hair, and something stitched on front. Crooked lines, no, green letters of varying line size to spell 'Nikolai'. It was unprofessional, shoddy even, lacked any style to it, and yet it warmed his heart that someone like Adam took time to make this.

At once he stood up to try on the perfectly imperfect sweater, liking the feel of it. Two sizes too large for him was no problem in winter and really, why complain? Best of all it didn't have an odd itch that some sweaters did.

"I really like it."

"Ok your next one, it's the most important!"

As expected it was a DVD, and not just any but a Christmas themed film. 'A Christmas Story', an old film but like any classic it resisted the tides of time. He hadn't watched it since he was a kid, not really anything for the past seven years. The organization had a strict rule of no outside entertainment, one among many frivolous ones that were designed to keep him focused solely on exterminating werewolves.

No fun allowed, in short.

Depending on how one would look at it, having fun was their punishment. A cup of hot cocoa violating the fitness rule, a sweater unapproved for his wardrobe, and a movie that provided only distraction. How torturous indeed, he thought to himself. Woe to his already turning flabby muscles if he dared take a sip of a delicious winter treat.

"Adam, thank you," he smiled and pat his… friend's.. paw.

"So you're letting me have my own Christmas?", he asked.

"Not just you. I thought you'd be lonely and needed company, it's a special day, right?", Adam slowly wagged his tail.

"You mean, you want to spend Christmas with me?"

Adam nodded, his muzzle shifting into a smile or something close since Nikolai couldn't often read it. Hm, well he wasn't untrustworthy and had no reason to lie to him. It wouldn't hurt to bond with a werewolf who was a complete opposite of everything he'd learned.

"Ok."

"Yes! I have a few Christmas movies in my bag too, we can watch a few more if we finish this one. Maybe tomorrow I could bring you some games to play? I don't know if you're into those but Dominic got me this playstation, I managed to snag some goodies for a decent price online. But that's tomorrow, tonight we watch my favorites!"

By God, it was like listening to a child talk about their hobbies.

"Hm. I'll save some of this for you," Nikolai shook the canister.

"Oh! I can't eat or drink anything cocoa, I'll be sick to my stomach, one disadvantage of me."

"Do you have tea?"

"Um… Not really..", the wolf's ears slumped.

"Do you like tea?"

"If I put some sugar in. Why?"

"Can you get tea if I get put back in the cell?"

"I.. guess. I don't need tea to enjoy a movie, the sink works fine for water."

"You sure?", Nikolai asked him.

"I'm fine! Why are you so concerned about me?"

….A fair point.

"I'm just making sure you're ready for the movie. Y'know, I haven't seen this movie in years, any movie really. They don't let you do that in my group."

"Why's that?"

"Oh, uh.."

'Focus your thoughts on the enemy'

"They're a bit uptight."

Adam shrugged and briefly shifted to a different form, human except not quite that. Dog ears and fur sprouting from various parts of his body in addition to a bushy tail proved as much. Handling the DVD as his normal chosen self was risky, thank goodness he wasn't too dumb to know otherwise. It worked fine, despite the age of the television, skipping past the advertisements to get to the menu.

Before anything else he filled up the coffee pot with water to set in the machine, setting out cocoa and marshmallows for when it was ready. An odd sound emitted from it but the water dripped out normally, phew. With a hop over the couch, he shifted back into his usual form and hit play.

"Damn it's hot in here," he said as he started taking his shirt off.

"You sure you aren't too hot?"

"Me? No, not really," Nikolai dumped a few spoonfuls of powder in his cup.

Bits poured down like an hourglass as he held the scoop still. Here he was having a mini get together with the enemy, breaking every rule in the book. Normally he'd be thinking of how to try and escape using what was around him. But Adam was no vicious, evil beast, quite the contrast in the report he'd been given in fact.

'Subjects are to be considered extremely dangerous and captured via group effort or terminated by one's self'

The mission statement was prominent over all other information. Maybe they'd seen him tearing into a deer's leg. In any case, they were wrong when it came to Adam. Now that didn't take the wolf exorcism off the table, it only meant he was able to resist his urges to go wild. To cling to his humanity for so long was an admirable feat.

"You coming?", Adam asked behind him.

Just a few more marshmallows, aaaand perfect.

"Ready when you are," he said as he sat near the wolf.

A wave of fond nostalgia washed over him as it started, watching Ralphie and his brother deal with his mom. Neighborhood bullies chasing them down the street, the troubles at school, the infamous pole scene. Adam's paw at the back of his neck-

Wait.

"Woah, what are you doing?", he recoiled away from it.

"Nothing?"

"Your hand was holding me," he said as he leaned forward.

"Oh, I.. didn't realize what I was doing. I usually like to cuddle up to someone else in the winter. It might seem intimate, but it's just something we wolves do, it's fun!"

"But.. why?", Nikolai frowned at this odd discovery.

"Cause we're comfy! Like a big happy family, brothers in arms, friends to the end, something like that. Is it.. not normal to other people?"

"Not if you're just friends."

"Oh, I'll try to respect that then," Adam kept his arms to himself, looking awkwardly forward and his ears slumped slightly.

…...God forgive him.

Nikolai sighed, "Look, it's Christmas and.. if you're comfy… bonding, then I'll let you."

"Really?", Adam's tail began wiggling.

"Y-"

Nikolai, never having held or been held by anyone else, was promptly pulled into the werewolf's embrace. First a hug of gratitude, then casually holding him the way he would a friend. Next, getting him close, something that was almost intimate but not quite there. A paw gripping his thigh, practically nestled under his shoulder, they all did this casually?

Not just his friend here, the other wolves would do this? To them it was only a simple friendly thing, to society it meant a special way to let a partner know you loved her. Right now, at this moment, it meant he was accepted and welcomed by one of the pack.

If they did this for the sake of accepting each other, then… were they really playing earlier? Now that he thought of it,  the docile beasts only became hostile when he entered their field, and it made sense as he was the intruder. So either his report had been entirely wrong or he was being fed lies. Lies so poorly spun they were broken like nothing when compared to Adam's behavior. Hell, the rest of the pack would've killed that human by now if they were as bloodthirsty as he'd been told.

"You ok?", his friend asked.

"Just thinking. Adam, how often do your friends play with each other? Is it only during winter or is it year round?"

"Yeah! Well, not all the snow stuff 'cause, duh, summer. But yeah, any season we wrestle and we hunt together. Some of us like racing back to the cabins to see who's faster. Oh! Sometimes there's weight lifting contests, you're strong so you stand a chance!"

There was no way he was lying, not because he chose to disobey his alpha and say something he wasn't trained to say. He was doubtful of Dominic training his dumber pack member to say anything at all. Maybe.. these wolves meant no harm to anyone. Maybe they found a place to be free from society and live almost entirely independent, happy.

Then one day a reckless hunter challenged their idea of safety. Tackling them, shooting silver poison to revert them back to a human form, and breaking their paradise. No longer were they safe, now they knew harshness existed. A whole secret group hellbent on killing them all or ripping out an integral part of them.

That was a hell of a bad first impression. Who could blame them for throwing that hunter into a freezing cabin, leaving him to become filthy. Feeding him only because they decided to, to prove they weren't entirely as cold as he. And one wolf, too simple minded to know any better, came to the injured hunter to keep him warm…

Over time he let himself settle into the wolf's fur and enjoy the company of his friend who took a chance. Adam began to groom him, for a second he froze but a comforting paw massaged into his thigh. Now he knew the feeling of a friend to comfort him, to clean, to trust. 

Somehow he felt hotter despite any apparent change in temperature.

"Hey um, don't take this the wrong way, I got a little warm."

"It's fine bro! Besides, you look great without it."

Was that.. flirting?

No, just calling him strong of course, it couldn't be anything else. Despite that he knew it was Adam saying it, and it felt different from him. Anyone else could point out his qualities just fine, but they couldn't make him feel so.. fuzzy.

Watching the rest was admittedly difficult with the fuzzy feeling in his head. Strengthened by the wolf holding him close in warm fur. Everything about this was heresy against his entire role as a hunter. So why did he allow himself to enjoy it this much?

"Hey, are you still paying attention?", Adam asked.

"Yes," a lie, as Nikolai hadn't even remembered getting to the scene where Ralphie stands up for himself.

"Alright, it's almost done, then you can get some rest."

Rest. Right, better to sleep on his thoughts rather than spoil a Christmas classic. No harm in leaning into the wolf's fur though, right? He particularly enjoyed the present scene, the one day where a kid's Christmas wishes or extras were given. Growing up he'd never really had a similar experience. 

Being recruited for a werewolf hunting organization scrapped any Christmas at all for recruits, save for a special meal on the holidays where they were allowed a cookie. Somewhat harsh but the results gave him the strength and fighting capabilities of today.

Right, the movie progressed to Ralphie nearly shooting his eye out. Such a dark thing to joke about in a kids movie. Not particularly harmful considering it was more of a bluff. Still, losing an eye as quick as that…

Oh well.

The rest played out accordingly as the parents watched a snowy night adorned with Christmas lights. The kids falling asleep after a particularly memorable holiday. Watching this after years was a good experience.

"So... wanna watch Elf?", Adam asked in one of his signature toothy grins.

"I'm not sure. I might turn in early today, but this was a really good experience. Thank you Adam."

"I'm glad you liked it. You know, um...I think you looked really cute after your shower."

"W-what?"

C-cute? Him? Why did it make him feel so funny? How could he be cute? He wasn't anything like that and yet some part of his mind flipped a switch. Just a simple word and he.. oh God.

"Woah Nick, I uh.."

Fuck.

"Geez you're big!"

Nikolai tightly shut his legs hoping that damn thing would go soft. No, no he wasn't.. like that, why did it happen so easily, why-

"Nick! Nick look at me!"

One of his paws wiped away the tears that the hunter didn't even notice. God, he was only supposed to watch a movie and-

"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Are you ok?"

"I.. I don't- Why did I- I-"

"Hey! Hey, you're allowed to like what you like!"

"What?"

"We don't judge! Nick, I should've been slower, I'm sorry."

"No, you're fine. I'm…not gay. I don't... I don't know why I liked that."

"Do you wanna talk about it?", Adam turned off the TV.

"About… this?", Nikolai tightened his legs.

Adam sat away, "You don't need to be scared of getting a boner. You can still like girls, maybe you like guys too sometimes. That's not a bad thing."

"I don't like guys, I just… I don't know what happened, alright? You were sweet talking me, giving me a massage, it could happen to anyone," yeah, anyone.

"Did you like it?"

"...Yeah," he softly said.

"Has anyone ever done that with you?"

"No, I.. I've never been close with someone. I didn't realize how easy it was to get hard like that."

"Do you want to think about it by yourself?"

"I think so."

Adam sat up and flicked the TV off, gathering his clothes and heading out to the door. So much for the nice little movie night.

"Hey, Adam um… thank you for all the gifts."

"Yeah. There's one more though, Dominic said you can walk around the cabin now."

"Ok."

"Well, goodnight."

The wolf latched the door shut, locking it before he forgot. 

Ok, so the evening went a little sideways, and… he found out something new. Nikolai went to the window and watched as Adams' form disappeared in the trees. He cleaned up the mess and tidied up the cabin, then turned in a few hours early.

So.. guys were on the table now, or more specifically Adam was able to do something to him.

And he liked it, being held like that, talked to that way.

It was going to be a long night.
