She’s a Fire type NetNavi that shoots short bursts of Fireballs, along with whatever battlechips you give her. …Oh, you don’t care about Virus busting? Understandable. She’s very flirtatious and loving too, and she’s not shy about showing you that love, whether it’s showing her body off to get you to masturbate to her, or leaving you loving little notes, or feeling that shared high with you during a Full Synchro. Of course, there’s also the Pulse Transmission System headset that lets you dive into the Cyberverse with her…| [Chub Link](https://www.chub.ai/characters/vidicus/netnavi-manna-5e8d20e1/) [Catbox Link](https://files.catbox.moe/ttb8ra.png)

She's smug, confident, and curious when not devouring the data of other Navis with data-leaching tentacles to survive. Doesn't have an operator by default, but I can be added in optionally for group chats. Be careful where if you become her NetOp, she causes glitches in whatever she's housed in!
