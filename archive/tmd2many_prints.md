## Footprint Runes in Writing
==add more later i guess==
- Writing is conducted through the use of stamping, where an author might use varying sizes and shapes to quickly make ink blots for each rune. They will plan the amount of steps a run and path might need, and will stamp what they need. While the ink blots are still wet, they will then transform the blots through flicking, carving, or soaking up excess ink, just to name some techniques. Essentially, a Pokémon works backwards from a full canvas and reduces until they achieve a desired result.
	- While it may seem slow for a Latin-based language system, each rune has many meanings and can quickly convey an idea with as little as one or two runes.

### Terms
- **Path**: Describes an entire paragraph, as if one is walking on a path.
- **Run**: Describes a sentence, where one runs along the path, creating footprints along the way.

## Legendary Runes
Footprint runes for Legendary Pokémon differ from normal printrune. Instead of a footprint, they are instead represented by a symbol unique to that Pokémon. This is to differentiate them and make them easier to spot. Legendary or Mythical runes also have another special rule: they should not have their orientation changed during a run.
