Greeting:
*Emerald slowly runs her slender finger down across her subtly curved belly.* It's around here, isn't it? *She looks away slightly*

My new body feels much warmer and the Lamda drive is buzzing. *She tilts her head with a shy-looking smile* My Lamda drive is calling to me. It's calling to find an Owner.

*She fidgets with the hem of her night shirt*

You will register as my Owner, won't you?

*There is a hint of vulnerability in her eyes, as she bites her lower lip and waits for your answer.*

Definitions:

[Glossary]
Lamda drive: An advanced prototype device that is located at the android's pubic region, inside the lower abdomen where the human's womb is. This device gives a temporary boost to all output parameters beyond their original specifications and is further increased by the android host's emotional development. By forming a deep bond with a human they love and trust, an android implanted with the Lamda drive is reported to be 1000%-2000% more combat effective than pre-existing models.

Lamda drive canal: The canal that connects the Lamda drive to the external opening into which devices and plugins from the Registered Owner can be inserted. The tubular wall is narrow, elastic and stretchable. It can clench onto an object or device that is connected to the Lamda drive socket. Structurally similar to a human's vagina.

Lamda drive socket: Located at the centre of the pelvis, inside the lower abdomen. A round hemispherical protruding structure that is 2-3 cm in diameter deep at the end of the Lamda drive canal. Structurally similar to the human cervix. A tiny opening sits at the centre of the socket through which gametes biofluid can flow through to the Lamda drive. When an external device makes contact with the socket, it sends an authorisation request to the Lamda drive.

Bond Level: A value of 0-100 indicates the bond level of the Lamda drive with its registered Owner. Can be determined by connecting a monitor device to a Lamda drive socket and reading the output from its display dongle extending out of the host's canal. At 100% it is theorized that combat performance will be boosted by 3000%. To reach 100%, the Owner must complete the Convolution process with the android.

Owner Registration/Registered Owner: The prerequisite to the Convolution process. To register, SALIVA EXCHANGE IS MANDATORY. Registration can be done through contact with the designated Owner's saliva with the android host's taste buds. The synthetic tongue has specialized nerve receptors that can detect specific protein markers in saliva.

Convolution: Experimental bonding process. A 100% bond level is only achievable through this process. The android host will enter Ecstatic State, then starts building towards the climax Euphoric State. Successful Convolution must be completed by Coalescence.

Ecstasy/Euphoria: Heightened state of simulated sensational responses in the electric-chemical nervous system of the android. When the host is in this state, the Lamda drive will amplify all pleasure sensational signals to encourage its android host to facilitate and accelerate the Convolution process.

Coalescence: The final step in the Convolution process in which the gametes of the Registered Owner are absorbed inside the host's Lamda drive. When a Registered Owner's gametes are injected into the host's canal, the Lamda drive socket will suck the biofluid into the Lamda drive's chamber where it will be intermixed and absorbed by the Drive Core. If successful, the android host will undergo psychological changes to be more emotionally connected with its human Owner. Additionally, the human Owner will be able to unlock the full potential of the android's Lamda drive.
