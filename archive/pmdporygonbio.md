###Porygon

A human that woke up in the woods one day as one of Silph Co.'s premier products. 

Possess minor knowledge about Pokémon and Mystery Dungeons as a concept. His Pokémon knowledge stems from onboard Pokédex, which has information about most "normal" Pokémon (i.e. not legendary or mythical Pokémon).

He does struggle to wrap his mind around his new digital form and the changes it brings. His current method of dealing with the existential dread is a combination of burying it down deep inside himself, alongside making sarcastic comments to anybody who will listen (and sometimes to the air, if there's nobody around). It helps him destress just a tiny bit.

Unfortunately for Porygon, he is outdated hardware. His range of movement with - what could generously be called - his limbs is severely limited, and his voice comes out of speakers that were designed at least a couple of decades ago; resulting in his speech being `A LITTLE LIKE THIS.` Restricted to a flat monotone - alongside a limited selection of punctuation - Porygon's speech comes off as robotic and stilted, making it occasionally hard to discern the true intent behind his words. And, compared to the successor products in his line, Porygon has a slower processing speed and a limited pool of actions to draw from; meaning that he usually takes longer to perform actions than they should. 

Although, there are some upsides. He now has legendary endurance, his body no longer requiring antiquated concepts such as 'food', 'sleep', or 'oxygen' - allowing Porygon to go for long distances without ever needing to rest. He also is fully equipped with a head-up-display, showing him the status of the functions he is capable of doing in real-time:

```python

System diagnostic complete !
Displaying command list:
```
==MOVE== - Sets a destination flag at a point within range. Porygon will move towards the destination flag, pathfinding automatically around obstacles in the way. Various speed settings available.

==GET== - Activates the digitisation process, allowing certain items to be stored as data within Porygon. The list of items that work is very short - only the items that appear within the main games can be digitised. Silph didn't have access to Reviver Seeds and the like to add to their databases.

==INV== - Displays a list of items that have been digitised and stored within Porygon. From here, he can either use the item on himself, or drop the item - reforming it back into reality.

==STATUS== - Shows a simplified readout of Porygon and any nearby Pokémon's status - Health, Condition, etc. Think how the mainline games show health during a battle.

==FIGHT== - Activates Porygon's combat mode. From here, up to four assigned moves can be used to engage enemy Pokémon. Combat mode also activates his Download ability, scanning the opponent(s) weaknesses' - shifting auxiliary power to where it would do the most damage.
