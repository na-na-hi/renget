#***An Emperor for the Empress***
---

\>*Keep moving. Lure it away.*

\>Simple thoughts for a not-so-simple task.

\>Your overworked muscles protest the continuous running while you dash to your left, a column of brilliant blue flames erupting behind you as an attack fails to hit its mark. Not even the intense heat of the cave and lava pool can match the ferocity of these flames. Even with cool drinks, you've been sweating in your fire-resistant armor.

\>A short distance away, your target drops to all fours, snarling at its agile foe. A sea of hellfire encompasses the area it stands in, daring any foolhardy opponent to engage on its own terms.

\>You know better than that.

\>Coming to a stop, your breathing is heavy as you warily eye the elder dragon in preparation for its next move, agitated over the current turn of events. One minute it only uses physical attacks, the next it stays in one spot and forces you to sprint in circles. Your sword and shield, for all of their versatility, aren't suited for long distance combat and you quickly learned the burning consequences of trying to block erupting puddles.

\>Come on....

\>With a start, it bounds forward, covering almost the entire distance separating you in a single stride. Unsure of its motives, you preemptively side-step to avoid being knocked down, along with potentially placing yourself in an advantageous position.

\>But no tackle occurs. As it reaches you it performs an almost graceful short hop, turning itself around mid-air and coming to a complete stop in front of you, tail raised in preparation.

\>It's now you not only realize what's going on, but that you planned for this exact scenario if – no, WHEN – it occurred again. Your desire to see its rear end is at an all-time low, so you dive forward, hoping your reaction speed and positioning were good enough this time.

\>Your roll brushes past a hind leg, narrowly avoiding the sharp plates protruding past the knee. As you rise, you hear the dense slap of a heavyset tail striking the ground and wince when it scrapes your sore shoulder, the contact causing you to stumble.

\>The range of that thing is the bane of your existence.

\>Nonetheless, you're committed to the plan. A boot digs into the ground as you put all your weight into driving your shield into the empty space near its shoulder. Having failed to mop up the trash, the elder dragon turns to face you just as your attack reaches its destination.

\>It's your turn to snarl as metal noisily clashes with royal scales, your finely-made shield brute forcing its way through a dense blue mane and into the face of your adversary. For a split-second you witness layers of nigh-impenetrable natural armor cave in to the shield bash, yet its fangs remain unblemished and unharmed.

\>Thanks to its facial structure, you've been hard pressed to discern any emotions beyond raw anger and maybe contempt if you squinted hard enough. Even the few other notable strikes you’ve dealt were merely met with a flinch and livid roar. But now – while its entire form recoils from the excruciating blow – you're grimly satisfied to see the unmistakable, universal expression of pain.

\>Hours of fighting has left you exhausted far beyond what rations can remedy, and you're less attentive and slower to recover from the swing than you'd like. Before you can adjust your stance, a powerful force slams into you, the world losing focus as you're sent skidding away in a jumbled heap of weapons and gear.

\>Damn it. There's always a catch.

\>Remaining on the ground is a death sentence, so you shakily pick yourself up. While doing so, you notice your opponent's wings returning to rest. Blasted wind pressure. You're fortunate that no flames accompanied it.

\>Unexpectedly, no follow-up comes from the attack. Instead the two of you share the first stationary stare-down since the hunt started, errant fiery puddles extinguishing on their own.

\>Over the years, you’ve tangled with a variety of monsters, each more hostile than the last. From murderous Deviljho to rampaging Rajangs, you’ve grown accustomed to the bestial malice they project onto the environment. They despise everything, and that all-encompassing group naturally includes you. This monster, however, feels different.

\>The near-tangible aura of rage exuding from it. An azure muzzle curled into a perpetual snarl, baring two rows of fangs determined to give you a fatal laceration. And the blazing fury in its eyes threatening to ignite you on the spot. That scathing glare especially....

\>You're familiar with being sized up by the likes of haughty Zinogres and wary Nargacugas; beasts that merely sought to scan their target, measure your form and nothing more. Here, two scornful eyes stay affixed to yours with an unwavering presence – the careful pacing that would normally accompany similar scrutiny is absent, the elder's abnormal stillness only marred by the ragged heaving of its chest and errant tail twitches. These passing seconds stretch far beyond cursory assessment, crackling flames the only reprieve from the tense, deafening silence engulfing the cavern. *Judgement*. Your stomach drops at the revelation.

\>This elder dragon hates *you*. Not the world, nor any creature unfortunate enough to stumble upon it during its time of need.

\>Just you.

\>From this distance you're prepared for another wave of hellfire, but it never comes. You don't know how long you've been glaring at each other, but eventually the elder dragon breaks eye contact, taking to the air with noticeably labored wingbeats. You remain glued to it just in case, but just as suspected it flies off, unsteadily retreating past a corner and into a nook you don’t recall having seen before.

\>You want nothing more than to chase after it and bring this arduous and oh-so-infuriating hunt to an end, but you're in nearly as bad a shape as your target if your heavy, strained breathing means anything. Heavens above, you do NOT like Lunastra. Never met one until today, but there is zero doubt in your mind that you absolutely do not want to deal with one ever again if you can help it.

\>You practically collapse to the ground as you sheathe your weapons and sit, prying off your helmet before weakly bringing your pouch around and fishing out a mega potion to consume.

\>Although your minor burns and the odd cracked rib heal up, it does little to quash the aches and pains of your muscles, your arm and shoulder enduring crippling abuse from the multitude of emergency blocks forced onto them via quick claw attacks and debilitating tail swipes. Only a proper rest will save you from this torment, but that's not happening until you finish what you started.

\>You allow yourself a few minutes to recuperate, but its effect is negligible. Any period of downtime afforded to yourself is also given to the elder, and the last thing you need is for it to regain strength. This hunt has been a battle of attrition since the start, interludes being kept to a minimum by both sides.

\>With a sigh, you stuff the empty flask into your pouch, donning your helmet and rising to your feet with a groan that quickly turns into verbal irritation.

"Guoohhhhhhhmygoodness I am going to *strangle* this thing."

\>Your mood is borderline angry but the aggression just isn't there. You can get riled up when you need to; the blunt force trauma recently applied to the Lunastra was only possible thanks to channeling your rage, but when out of combat the most you can muster up is exasperation. Admittedly a questionable trait to hold in this line of work, but you always pull through when it matters the most.

\>You take a few rigid steps as your legs acclimatize to being used again, then break into a purposeful stride, making your way to the hidden entrance where your target fled. Passing by the lava pool, you briefly take in the newly discovered path before setting off. Magma-infused walls ooze heat, the natural corridor stretching down and around another corner to areas unknown. Just enough space for an injured elder dragon to fly in as well.

\>Normally you'd be entirely focused on the hunt, but you need to vent to yourself. 

\>Stupid dragon. From the scarce information fed to you before setting out, you learned that Lunastra are supposed to be extremely aggressive during mating season – a detail you confirmed when it tried to maul you mere seconds after being spotted.

\>So yes, she's looking for her male counterpart. An issue that solves itself – except after several days there were no signs of the elder dragon leaving the Elder's Recess. With the climate teetering towards uncomfortably warm, the locale void of wildlife and all hunters barred from entering, it became clear that something needed to be done.

\>Dumb dragon. Elders are a significant cut above other monsters - you've seen sparks of its supposed intelligence with the myriad of counterattacks you've endured, along with that silent, smoldering staredown... Yet, she still can't recognize when her knight in red armor isn't coming.

\>Some minutes later you're greeted with an exit, the path widening into a spacious open area almost completely surrounded by lava. A convenient rock lies in front of you, offering a safe, scorch-free method to reach the ground. In the middle of the natural arena lies a sleeping beast curled into a loose ball, snores pouring out as it slowly recovers from the fight. A snowball's chance in the Volcanic Hollow you'll let that happen.

\>Your body doesn’t appreciate the two sharp drops taken, short as they are – your aches flare up, reminding you of the final bout you'll have to endure. This does not sit well with you. Right now, all you want is for the hunt to be over, to lie down and nurse your tender wounds.

\>There's a grimace forming as you approach the dormant dragon, studying it while circling around. For a calamity whose very presence affects the weather, its size doesn’t quite live up to your expectations. Then again, Kirin are far smaller and monsters aren’t limited to one size. You still remember that gigantic Bazelgeuse....

\>Despite all the hacking and slashing you've done, you can barely spot any significant cuts and gashes amidst its hide. 'Resilient' doesn't even begin to describe it.

\>Eventually you come to a stop at its head.

\>Yeesh. Even while asleep, it looks pissed. That's the curse of a wicked set of tusks, you suppose.

"Wake up."

\>You don't attack sleeping monsters. Ever. Even you recognize it as foolish, giving up such a major advantage and surprise attack, but you refuse. Ridiculous as it sounds, assaulting them while they're drowsy and confused rubs you the wrong way. You want to defeat them fair and square, and it has yet to hinder you so why stop now?

\>Unfortunately this sleeping Lunastra didn't get the memo, seeing as it doesn't rise. You try again, raising your voice.

"Wake UP."

\>You follow that with a light kick to its crest, the action failing to budge its head even the tiniest bit as it continues its peaceful slumber.

\>For crying out....

\>Growling, you cross over to the opposite side of its head and bend down, opting to take a knee to ease the discomfort of crouching. A well-protected hand stretches out and through the dragon's mane to use its neck as a support, allowing you bring yourself as close as you can to a lone unguarded ear.

"Wake *up* so I can KICK. YOUR. ASS."

\>That energy could've been better spent on the kicking of aforementioned ass, but you achieve the desired result. An eyelid flutters open as it groggily searches for the offender. Then a sharp saffron eye fixates on you, and you become dreadfully aware of the horrendous spot you're in.

\>Oops.

\>You practically fling yourself backwards into the beginnings of a roll, but you're not quick enough. Even with the rapidly changing scenery, you spot a large paw swinging fast and wide.

\>Your blood runs cold when a single black claw slams into your helm, missing your eye by centimeters as it hooks against the viewport and jerks your head sideways. You're dangerously off-balance now, but not having your neck snapped is the biggest priority. In one heart-pounding motion, you reach up with both hands, pulling your helmet off and letting momentum carry you to the ground with a grunt.

\>There's no time to marvel over the flawless execution, or lack thereof. You're hyper-aware of the furious elder that jumped to attention in a flash, your precious helm still caught on a claw. With a few short swipes, your headwear is dislodged and sent bouncing away a short distance. Hardly a setback.

\>Then the Lunastra rises on its hind legs, letting out a thunderous roar that rocks your very core and reminds you of the main use for the helmet.

\>You're left dazed and disoriented, still lying on the ground as you try to remember what it was like to have intact eardrums mere minutes ago. Then common sense slaps you upside the head, yelling about the dragon not even a meter away and demanding you get up before you're turned into a well-done hunter steak.

\>You roll away and jump to your feet, putting some much-needed distance between you two while unsheathing your weapons. If only the soreness wracking your limbs would take a backseat in favor of more pressing matters like survival, you could better focus on the problem at hand.

\>The problem which, as you properly take in its growling visage, now has traces of blue dust surrounding it.

\>This... is not good. You absolutely have to slay it before that dust reaches critical mass.

\>Information on Lunastra might be scarce, but if it’s anything like Teostra, you do NOT want to be in the vicinity when it goes off. Granted, you have no firsthand experience with a supernova... and maybe you’ve never actually hunted a Teostra since they’re unusually passive in the New World – BUT – you’ve seen the scorching aftermath and its massive reach. This elder doesn’t harness the blast element the same way Teostra do, but if its supernova involves those fiery puddles you’ve grown to despise... Being burned alive isn’t a pleasant way to go.

\>You absolutely need to slay this thing. Running is useless; any prior attempts to disengage were met with a pissed-off Lunastra hot on your heels. The hunt only paused when it decided to change zones, presumably to recover energy. If you flee, the chance that you die tired goes from ‘maybe’ to ‘definitely.’

\>At least you’re not the only one with little stamina to spare. There’s no mistaking each strenuous breath that mirrors your own, the recent respite doing little to help either party. Its stance isn't as strong and firm as earlier, and even allowing you the luxury of getting up was off-character. You're confident that despite dealing with similar ailments, you can end this before things take a turn for the worse.

\>Confident. Not arrogant. You know the difference.

\----------------------------

\>Don't falter. It's running on fumes now.

\>Of course so are you, but that's beside the point.

\>How long have you been at this? Any other monster would've keeled over well before hitting this state. Despite the rapidly-worsening situation, adrenaline works but for so long; you're acutely aware of the sluggishness plaguing your movement as your weary form struggles to comply with the lone, crucial command echoing behind each thought: *Survive*. Parts of YOU now want to stop, to spare yourself from this seemingly endless torment, but when the alternative is death, why would anyone *willingly* give up?

\>...Now that you think about it, that's probably what's keeping this thing going too. Sheer stubbornness and staunch refusal to die, to the point where they give it their all. You admire such tenacity. Perhaps you'd admire it even more if it weren’t trying to kill you.

\>You pathetically back-hop away from a weak swipe, keeping to the side. Early on, you decided the safest spot to be was any area the Lunastra didn't roam. The second-best option was away from its face and tail.

\>The elder dragon turns its head to glare at you. Ocean blue blast particles radiate from it, forming a sparkling aura that – again – you'd probably admire more if it wasn't intended to be used on you. Even its crest is glowing.

\>Recently, when it began the process of charging up, you were given the opportunity to get in a few solid strikes, which you did while staying alert for the inevitable counterattack.

\>But it never came. One scornful eye bore into you while blow after blow rained into unyielding scales in a desperate attempt to make it pause and retaliate, to delay the one thing that could, in an absolute best-case scenario, leave you in grave condition.

\>That's when you realized this thing truly wants you dead at all costs.

\>A sharp inhale. A twist of its head.

\>Those tells are all you need to recognize the incoming sweeping flames. You're dimly aware of the puddles trailing behind you preventing any retreat, and you can't outrun it to the side.

\>The decision is made for you as the elder dragon expels a concentrated blast of flames, simultaneously pivoting in order to catch any attempts to dodge. Down you go into a crouch and up goes your arm, presenting your shield to the incoming blaze. Even before it hits, you can feel the immense heat and mentally steel yourself for the worst.

\>Fire strikes your defense, your arm being put under extreme pressure that slides you back and into the searing fringes of erupting puddles. While the shield does its job, it can't fully protect your bulky frame; your teeth grind together as errant flames curve around the shield, your vulnerable head subject to temperatures worse than any furnace.

\>Once you're in the clear, you momentarily waver – your waning form remains upright thanks to an equally unsteady arm that pushes off the ground as you spring forward. The Lunastra is finishing up its attack, even a short rotation taking time to recover from as it works on regaining balance.

\>Your sword swings through the air as you execute two quick vertical strikes on its foreleg, making it flinch in response. The injured limb rises, being pulled away in hopes of avoiding further abuse. Big mistake.

\>Spinning on the spot, your round slash isn't as precise and forceful as you want it to be, yet it hits home regardless. The elder dragon recoils even more, and you realize it's wobbling on its remaining unstable legs.

\>You're wheezing heavily now, but there's no time to question the new opportunity when your finishing stance left you in the perfect position. You spring forward one last time, keeping low and bringing your shield up to act as a guard in one last-ditch move.

\>Being in such close proximity to the elder isn't without downsides; the fiery aura bears down on you, not even your cool drink enough to suppress that level of rage. Pushing past the paw that's been giving you so much trouble, you put your entire weight into your rising shoulder, shielding it from significant injury.

\>A guttural, primal roar rips its way out of you as your tackle lands true, striking the Lunastra in its chest. Accompanying that is a deafening explosion that erupts from it, your view suddenly filled with blast particles that dissipate as quickly as they appear.

\>In its off-balance state, your pitiful charge is too much to bear. Three fatigued legs fail to keep it upright, the elder dragon tipping over and crashing to the ground with a pained, pathetic roar. You're nearly sent falling too thanks to a flailing claw that grazes your side, but catch yourself. Barely.

\>Right now you should be laying into it until it gets back up, but you're still recovering from the tackle, gasping for air as your muscles cry mutiny. This is why you could never get used to a Great Sword.

\>...

\>Wait a second, its aura is gone. Not only that, it isn't moving.

\>The previous scenario where you somehow made it fall over was met with flailing limbs in its endeavor to get back up. Now there's only the ragged heaving of its chest.

\>Your boots drag through the crust while you take several steps to Lunastra's head, attempting to get a better look at your downed foe. A distressed muzzle hangs open as it struggles to catch its breath, one visible eye half-closed in exhaustion. Its gaze weakly meets yours as you approach, but you can tell: it doesn’t even have the strength to move its head.

\>You’re done.

\>There's no joy to be found in your victory, but a wave of relief washes over you, nearly causing you to drop your sword and shield. No one wants to dwell on their own mortality, but when the situation grew exponentially worse by the minute, well....

\>In any case, with the sobering prospect of death comfortably behind you, your mood lifts in turn. Now that it’s not trying to murder you, you can properly respect its strength and endurance. Yes, it hates you, but hatred can be a powerful motivator. This Lunastra was a tough foe, to say the least. You admire that.

\>Right now you need time to recuperate, but there's one last thing that needs to be done. Before even that, however, something demands your attention.

\>Your gaze drifts off to the right, and you stare at the large appendage that sent you flying more than once today.

\>Hmmm....

\>Sheathing your weapons, you walk over and come to a stop at the Lunastra's tail, intently studying it from top to bottom. Should you cut it? You're almost fascinated with it. The reach is deceptively long, with weight that would put an Uragaan’s to shame. The smithy could definitely find a purpose for it.

\>...

\>No. You're tired enough as it is and for some reason, cutting off a limb post-hunt doesn't feel right. Also, chopping it would be a nightmare, if not downright impossible in your current state. Indeed, your current gear holds up well enough.

\>Finishing up your scan, you make to move when a glint catches your eye. There, near the underside of the tail base.

\>Peering closer, you're disappointed to find that it's not, in fact, a gem. Rather it's the result of... wet scales? Monsters don't sweat.

\>You take a knee, holding its hind leg for balance. Those scales aren't the only offenders. A thin trail extends to the side, where a larger pool forms and....

\>And....

\>Oh.

\>You can only stare at the partially exposed slit of the elder, the rest hidden by the very leg supporting you. Unlike nearly everywhere else, the scales surrounding it are violet in color, smoothing out the closer they are to her entrance.

\>Right... this Lunastra is female, isn't it.

\>See, you can tell because of the fluid coating her underside.

\>As you continue to gawk like a Kelbi caught in an Apceros stampede, a strand of feminine secretion leaks out like it's trying to give you a firsthand look of how she ended up in this condition. The lewd gesture is enough to snap you out of it, although you're still in shock.

\>Wha–

\>Why....

\>When?

\>During all the times she more or less presented her ass to you, not once did you catch wind of this oddity. Not that you were trying to sneak a peek at monster snatch. You, like any respectable hunter, always keep an eye out for changes of any kind in order to avoid being caught off guard. So when did she start getting... aroused?

\>For heaven's sake, WHY is she aroused?!

\>Your poor head hurts from more than the repeated blows taken today. All you've done is try to kill each other. Absolutely nothing has occurred over the last several hours that you or anyone in their right mind would ever view as attractive. Being incapacitated and completely at the mercy of your enemy isn’t exactly what you’d consider a turn-on... although the sight before you begs to differ.

\>Well, if you think about the Black Diablos, you know they're extremely hostile to everything, even a potential mate. Exactly *how* their suitor gets over that hurdle is beyond you; the finer intricacies of Diablos courtship lie far outside your area of expertise, but you suspect it involves more violence than what should be acceptable for an herbivore. Do Lunastra have a similar, more life-threatening approach? Even if they do, this doesn't add up, seeing as you certainly haven't been propositioned by the handful of Black Diablos you've dealt with. They can differentiate between you and a fellow member of their species.

\>So what's the deal with this Lunastra? Has she mistaken you for her crimson opposite? Or did you display such ferocity that in her view, you tick off all the boxes of the ideal mate despite the glaring lack of tail, wings, fangs, claws, glorious mane–

\>Stop that, you're getting off track. This isn’t a horny wyvern you’re dealing with, but an elder dragon. It’s extremely doubtful that she sees anything other than your armored, bipedal and distinctly non-leonine form. But, that only leaves the second theory....

\>In any case, you're confused. Confused because of all the scenarios that could've occurred, this was perhaps the most outlandish and improbable, and confused because you don't know what to do. Well that's not entirely true. You came here with the intention to slay or, if all else failed, repel an elder dragon. And you're all but finished with that task.

\>No, what you're drawing a blank on is not the near-motionless Lunastra assigned to you as a hunting target, but the near-motionless and highly stimulated Lunastra that apparently thinks you're The One.

\>And that's the problem. Things aren't as clear-cut when the monster is passive, and even less so when they display something like... this. So much for your personal rule: ONLY go after belligerent beasts that leave zero doubt as to whom the aggressor is. What a spectacular backfire.

\>So what now?

\>You finally tear your gaze away from her slit, glancing over to where her head lies. Somehow she's already recovered enough to lift it, head craned back to observe you. Your bewildered stare doesn’t invoke a reaction from her and as you continue gawking, you feel as though the boundless rage in the Lunastra's eyes has seemingly dissolved, leaving only the uncomfortable air of prolonged scrutiny. Unlike earlier, you can't make anything of her tired, enigmatic expression, yet her gaze again remains firmly affixed to yours with the same unnerving focus that originally caught you off-guard. *Judgement*. But this time, the result doesn't appear to be hatred. Is she expecting you to do something?

\>Eventually she lies back down, leaving you to address the situation.

\>You do not want to fuck this Lunastra, that much is certain. Something about being repeatedly slapped, burned, tackled, and occasionally bitten over the course of many hours has left an unpleasant taste in your mouth and there's no doubt in your mind that, had things gone differently, you wouldn't even be alive now. Not to mention she's a monster. Not even having the hots for you is enough to negate that.

\>No, you have no interest in dicking her.

\>...

\>*However*, you're not completely sold on leaving her as-is. Exhausted as you are, her mannerisms have sparked growing curiosity in you, along with an itching desire to make her squirm for the hassle she put you through. There's no point in brooding over what-ifs when the outcome has already been decided, right? You can consider this a weird payback of sorts.

\>Also... *mayyyybe* you’re admittedly kind-of-sort-of flattered that your hunting prowess evoked such a reaction from an elder dragon, bizarre as it is.

\>Mind made up, you quickly remove your slinger and gauntlet, placing it on the ground as you awkwardly shuffle your kneeling form until her hind legs lies before you.

\>Lifting the Lunastra's leg with a single arm proves to be an unexpected workout, and you chalk your mild trembling up to weariness as you sit and straddle her other leg, moving the lifted limb to partially rest on your shoulder – mostly for show, as the brunt of its weight remains supported by your arm. There isn’t anything left to hide now, and you take in the unintentionally suggestive display. There's hardly an area left untouched by her juices. Even the inside of her thighs are flecked with excitement.

\>Your free hand slowly reaches out, but there aren't any naughty intentions. Not yet.

\>A noticeable warmth encompasses your hand as you gently rest it on her leg, well beyond the reach of her fluids. The royal blue scales your fingers skim over have a plate-like appearance, forming rows of rough armor that can repel all but the sharpest of tools, as you learned first-hand.

\>You lightly make your way to the side, continuing to silently enjoy the sensation. For all the time you've spent hunting, you've never actually felt a monster. You prefer to keep your hands well-guarded.

\>It doesn't take long before you reach the liquid cause of your true motive. Only your palm lifts as you smoothly cross the amorous barrier to her underside, turning your ministrations from innocent into questionable.

\>There's a hitch in your breathing as your fingertips become slick, reduced friction naturally hastening their movement. You're approaching the source and, despite your recent bravado, can't help but hesitate.

\>It's not reluctance that makes you pause, but doubt. Better to take things slow...er. Slower.

\>Four mischievous digits trace a large circle just outside where the Lunastra's scales begin making their transition to an alluring purple. When you finish making a full pass, you repeat the process, tightening the circle.

\>By the third go, there's a notable rise in temperature within her violet territory. This time you apply a bit more pressure to your rubbing, and the leg underneath you twitches, your weight doing nothing to suppress the reflex.

\>Your fingers encircle her slit a fourth time, coaxing out another small dribble of feminine lubricant, the sight sending a faint jolt through you. A slumbering part of you wants to throw all forms of subtlety out the window and dive in, but that wouldn’t be any fun.

\>You're nearly at your prize now. Straying just outside where her folds begin, you perform one last circuit through the tender, glistening scales.

\>There's a moment of alarm as her thighs weakly constrict around you, her leg shifting in your strained support. Once it passes – and you're certain she hasn't regained enough strength to crush you – you remove your love-stained hand from her nethers, using it to further raise the appendage that's been blocking your view.

\>The elder dragon's head lies on the ground just barely out of sight. All you can see is the steady rise and fall of her chest, still more pronounced than normal. Then, likely sensing something was amiss thanks to your ceased actions, her head raises.

\>You have no idea why you wanted to see her face, considering the lack of expressions that muzzle can show. Her eyes are more focused now, but you still can't discern anything. What *are* you searching for? A more direct sign of approval? The answer remains ever elusive, but one thing's for certain: you wish you knew what she was thinking.

\>With a huff, you lower her leg back to its one-armed support. Your hand has a job to finish.

\>You've nearly completed the Lunastra world tour; before you lies the finish line, so to speak. After taking a quiet, deep breath, you continue.

\>Smoldering heat dances under your fingers as you carefully press down on her slit, taking care not to delve into the soaked entrance – the sensation coaxes more minor contractions from her legs. Scales fade into a smooth surface that offers no resistance while you slide across her length, keeping what you presume is light pressure applied to the engorged opening. When you reach its edge, you begin anew in the opposite direction.

\>Thus begins a soft, rhythmic clenching in the two powerful limbs you're sandwiched between as you tease the leonine elder, your ministrations starting to have a noticeable effect. A steady trickle of juices flow from her, your digits painting a
