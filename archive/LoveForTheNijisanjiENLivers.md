#Love For The Livers of Nijisanji EN 
This document is only meant to show positivity during these difficult times because any and all positive tags are currently being raided. This document is meant to shower the livers in love and support. Please know that this was created by a small group of fans and doesn't represent everyone as a whole. I'm also only including **current** livers, so any graduated or terminated livers will not be present within this list because I don't want there to be anything for haters to possibly grip on to. Another thing, I am intentionally making this very casual and unprofessional. I want it to be clear that every bit of this is mostly an opinion, and opinions can vary. You might disagree with what is said about certain livers, and I'm willing to take any and all constructive criticism. 

It will contain two sections: 
- The first section will a brief liver introduction. This section is specifically for the new fans. Any information is either from the fan wiki or other people within the community. It's fun to ask older fans about their favorite things about the livers that might pique the interest of newer fans. There are a lot of livers in EN, so it can be a little overwhelming in the beginning. 
- The second section will include anonymous fan messages. Messages can be as long as you want, but please be mindful of possible reactions. Please don't be passive aggressive in your message. We love all of the livers here, and we don't want to give haters free ammo. 

##Liver Introductions (Per Wave)
->**Lazulight**<-
!~#95c8d8;default;default;5; **Elira Pendora**~!
- (I also haven't watched very much of her, so please tell me what I should write about her.) 

!~#79cfb8;default;default;5; **Finana Ryugu**~!
- (Another person who I know next to nothing about, so anything would be much help for me. I don't want to spread misinformation about the livers, especially to possibly new viewers.)

->**Obsydia**<-
!~#ffac42;default;default;5; **Petra Gurin**~!
- (I know even less about her. I'm sorry.)

!~#e53f61;default;default;5; **Rosemi Lovelock**~!
- She's a big fan of violent games. On the topic of games, she loves Tekken. 
- She is very, very seiso. She doesn't swear, but she uses her own version of common swear words, such as "pluck you" and "binch". 
- She loves dancing in 3d. She's done more than a couple Just Dance streams actually. 
- From what I've been told, she also does all sorts of watchalong streams with members if that's your thing.  
- (More to be added later, because I also don't watch her very often, so feel free to share anything that you think should be added please and thank you!)

->**Ethyria**<-
!~#febc87;default;default;5; **Millie Parfait**~!
- (I know a little, but definitely not enough to write a full paragraph about her.)

!~#858ed1;default;default;5; **Enna Alouette**~!
- A very genuine person. She's so shy and awkward, which makes her extremely relatable, to be honest. 
- She's a natural comedian as well. She makes a lot of self deprecating jokes though, so beware. She might not be for everyone, but you can't be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who love her, they absolutely adore her. She's very.. self aware of neuroses. She makes a fair share of jokes about being depressed and stuff. 
- Her music voice is beyond simply being angelic. It's so beautiful. The first time I heard Ethyira, I genuinely started bawling my eyes out, and (at the time), I had never personally had that kind of reaction to a voice before. It's an experience that I won't forget anytime soon. 
- Also, can we talk about how skilled she is at improvising songs mid game? She can be singing the stupidest thing, but she has the vocals to back it up lol. I swear, this girl could somehow make even the Spongebob theme song angelic. 

!~#b90b4a;default;default;5; **Reimu Endou**~!
- (Please help.)

->**Luxiem**<-
!~#960018;default;default;5; **Vox Akuma**~!
- (I know *some* about him, but not nerely enough.)

!~#d4af37;default;default;5; **Luca Kaneshiro**~!
- (I don't know nearly enough about him either to write an entire paragraph.)

!~#348ec7;default;default;5; **Ike Eveland**~!
- (I will write this later, but any information is obviously very much appreciated.)

!~#a660a7;default;default;5; **Shu Yamino**~!
- If any collab needs an extra body, he's always willing to join. You never know where he'll show up next.
- He's very selfless. Also, a very chill guy. He's willing to go along with just about anything. For example, when he went along with the whole marriage thing a few months back. That story is still very fresh in my mind to this day. 
- He's a very private person and doesn't really give much in the terms of fan service either. 
- Loves Valorant and has gifted most people in EN the game Frog Detective. 
- He has an amazing singing voice and you can hear him featured on a few group covers and karaokes. 
- Overall, very seiso. He doesn't swear or anything, not even when he's malding. There's a clip from the Luxiem second anniversary that I'm specifically referencing right now. He uses words like "frick" rather than swear words. 
- Shu doesn't typically speak up about issues, but when he does people know to take it seriously. When things get real, he's very reliable. 
- He's really smart. There are many clips of him being a 'nerd'. He knows a *lot* of the digits of pi, and hearing him recite them amazes me every single time. 
- His main goal as a streamer is to create a safe and comfortable space for new and existing viewers. 

->**Noctyx**<-
!~#ff0800;default;default;5; **Fulgur Ovid**~!
- A very comfy streamer, but his rules can be a little off-putting to some. He just takes his community very seriously. Fuu-chan doesn't mess around with rule breakers. For some (including myself), the rules are actually the appeal of Fulgur Ovid streams. He's very straightforward and doesn't hesitate to call people out.
- His zatsu's are perfect for when you're doing something and could use some background noise. There is a good chance that BL will be a topic at least once lol. Listening to him ramble is extremely entertaining and honestly comforting for many. He's a man of culture, what can I say? 
- Very creative as well. He's always cooking something up.
- He enjoys analyzing things. When playing games, he'll make theories and all sorts of things, so definitely expect that if you stop by. 
- He's really good at keeping up with chat as well. 
- This man is quite literally the definition of comforting, single dad energy. 

!~#ff5f00;default;default;5; **Alban Knox**~!
- (I also know next to nothing about Alban.)

!~#fff321;default;default;5; **Sonny Brisko**~!
- (I wish I knew more about Sonny, but I sadly don't.)

!~#b600ff;default;default;5; **Uki Violeta**~!
- Overall, a very comfy streamer, especially his minecraft streams. If you ever just want some cozy background noise, you should definitely consider listening to Uki. He's a very soft spoken individual. 
- He's a very flirty individual. Shipping is allowed, but please **do not** push it upon him or any of the other livers. As always with shipping, please make sure both parties are comfortable with it. Please make no mentions of the 'harem', as mentioned in his rules (This bit is only for newer fans, so veteran Stargazers, please take no offense to this because it isn't directed at you nor anyone in particular). 
- Watching him play visual novels is always a very entertaining experience. He's so real with his reactions lol. 
- People compare his vibes to that of a tired mom. He's called Mama for a reason, you know? This side of him is especially present during group collabs. He's very tired most of the time and it's like everyone's his children lol. At times though, a more chaotic side can come out. For example, during the LuxNoc Pico Park collab, to many people's surprise, Uki was trolling. He gave up and joined in on causing chaos. 
- It's pretty common knowledge that Uki has a very pretty singing voice. I cried the first time I ever heard his debut song, Deja Vu. He's really appreciative of his fans too. I don't know many people who have a whole song about their fan base (the song being Starlight Stargazer for any people who don't know). 
- He'll do tarot card streams every once in a while as well, which ties beautifully into his lore as a Psychic might I add). 

->**ILUNA**<-
!~#e55a9b;default;default;5; **Maria Marionette**~!
- (I haven't had a chance to watch very much of her, so help would be much appreciated)

!~#fffef7;defualt;default;5; **Aia Amare**~!
- (I've watched even less of her..)

!~#6662a4;default;default;5; **Aster Arcadia**~!
- (All I know is that he's good at apex, so please help me out with him too if you don't mind).

!~#e60012;default;default;5; **Scarle Yonaguni**~!
- This woman right here is the *queen* of endurance streams, handcams, and Zatsus. She's one of the few livers who streams for really long times on end. This girl seriously terrifies me because I would personally need a break if I was her. She genuinely has all of my respect because of this.
- She's a very sweet girl and genuinely cares about people. She's a shy girlie though, which is completely okay, but she has a heart of gold. She's very down-to-earth and doesn't expect you to watch every stream. 
- (More to be added later, but I don't know what else to write about her. If anyone else knows more, please feel free to let me know!)

!~#429876;default;default;5; **Ren Zotto**~!
- (I only know about his chill vibes and great music, so please help me out if you don't mind.)

->**Xsoleil**<-
!~#429876;default;default;5; **Hex Haywire**~!
- Hex tends to lean very heavily into BFE content, so the occasional ASMR upload is to be expected. 
- He has a very deep voice. 
- Being so for real, his zatsu's have put me to sleep on more than one occasion.
- He loves discussing music. It's something he takes very seriously, and he has a whole hashtag on Twitter for the purpose of sharing music. 
- Whether it's unintentional or intentional, he reassures people that it's okay to be sad sometimes. You don't always have to be happy or in a good mood. 
- When he collabs with people, especially zatsus, he creates a whole list of questions and genuinely seems to want to get to know the person. He wants to hear all about them. He seems to care a lot about his friends. 
- Hex streams most days of the week, and he'd honestly probably be an endurance streamer if it wasn't for his medical issues that keep him from doing so.
- He also enjoys cooking too. He's actually done cooking handcams on more than one occassion. 
- Hex loves horror games. He's never actually gotten scared of one though, at least not one stream. He quite literally has no reaction. It's absolutely insane to me. He also loves Silent Hill and Resident Evil. Another fun fact, he loves Kuromi. 

!~#d5345e;default;default;5; **Ver Vermillion**~!
- Alright, Ver is a very chill guy (no pun intended), but sometimes he'll say the most out of pocket comment and it catches everyone off guard. It'll go from being really chill, but then a random unhinged comment will be dropped that'll leave you genuinely shook. 
- He's pretty shy and quiet, yet he actually does a *lot* of collabs with smaller indies, especially a lot more recently. He's helped me discover a lot more smaller vtubers. 
- This man is quite literally going all out with the content variety, and I am so here for it. He's doing it all. Ver's content can include, but isn't limited to:
  - Hand cams: They are simply to die for. He's done some where he just types on a keyboard, and he's even done some unboxing handcams. 
  - ASMR: He'll upload BF ASMRs as well, if that's your thing. 
  - Short Animations: He'll just randomly drop a cute little Villion animation at random. It's actually called Life of A Villion, and it's a little series. I just triple checked real quick to make sure. 
  - Compilations: He also uploads game compilations too every once in a while. This man is quite literally going all out with the content variety, and I am so here for it. He's doing it all. 

!~#d887b2;default;default;5; **Meloco Kyoran**~!
- (Please help. I know very little about her to be able to form a good introduction/description of her.)

!~#dc6b9a;default;default;5; **Kotoka Torahime**~!
- (uhhh anons, I need your help please and thank you..)

!~#A50082;default;default;5; **Doppio Dropscythe**~!
- A very out of pocket individual. No one ever really knows what goes on in this mans brain, but it's always entertaining to say the least. He has a special ability to always leave you questioning whether you just heard something correctly or whether everything is simply a fever dream. At some point, you'll quit questioning what he says and does and just go along with everything because it is so much better just to let him cook lol.
- He loves romance, which leads to him playing a good amount of visual novels and stuff. I remember him playing Eternights a while back, and all this man wanted was a kiss lol. He's also played A Date With Death too. 
- Doppio does stuff involving voice acting as well. He does a whole Drama CD thing. Fulgur will sometimes get him to voice act characters in games on stream. 
- He's really passionate about everything he does. In my opinion, he's the type of person who if he doesn't do it wholeheartedly, then he won't do it at all. There's not issue with that though, because there are plenty of people who have a similar mindset, including myself.
- He has an alter ego "Poco Pio" which he despises, although the Scythekicks love him (that I know of. Please correct me if I"m wrong).
- You'll see him featured in a couple of songs too, such as the Oto No Naru Hou e cover. He's also featured in the Echo cover with his wave mate, Meloco, where he both sings and says voice lines, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out. He's done an archived Karaoke as well, and his personal motto is that karaoke should be fun. In his opinion, that's all that matters, which is a great mindset to have.  

->**Krisis**<-
!~#c34196;default;default;5; **Vantacrow Bringer**~!
- Vanta plays a wide variety of games, but his favorite is Animal Crossing. He also plays Gacha Games as well. Another thing, he streams like a *ton*. At this point, most people have a playlist/folder of Watch Later content from him that will continue to grow and they'll never actually have the time to finish because of his insane schedule. If he isn't streaming on his channel, he's somewhere in a collab with someone. May burnout never affect this man o7
- He's also a natural comedian. His thought process is honestly up there with the likes of Doppio Dropscythe. Vox has actually mentioned that if the two of them are to ever be in a room together for too long, then it could be catastrophic. I don't think anyone will ever be able to truly understand the mind and thought process of Vanta Crowbringer, but I am appreciate whoever gave us this man. For example, have you came across his tweets? His Elden Ring tweet blew up for good reason. 
- He can click with quite literally anyone. He can literally match anyone's vibe, which is an amazing skill to have. 
- Truthfully, I've never seen anyone have an overly negative opinion about this man, for good reason. 
- Also, this man's Zatsus are some of my favorite things ever. It's very chill and goes back to the thing involving his sense of humour. Listening to him as background noise doing just about anything is always a trip (in the best way possible to me). 

!~#8728e1;default;default;5; **Vezalius Bandage**~!
- (I haven't had the chance to add stuff about him, but I watch Zali a pretty decent bit, but as I've said a million times by now, please share anything you think should be added about him). 

!~#f5eb28;default;default;5; **Yu Q. Wilson**~!
- A very silly guy overall. He can overall click with just about anyone.
- His favorite game is Project Zomboid, which is the type of streamer he considers himself to be, but he also really shines during his Zatsus. He will do or say the craziest things without even meaning to. 
- He's all for going along with a bit and joke. Back during the early days of Krisis, it was actually during their first collab, him and Zali gaslit Vanta into believing Obsidian was renamed Obsydia. It was a whole thing. 
- Wilson is considered to be very "bulliable", so nearly everyone in EN tends to tease him about things from time to time. For newer fans, please be careful not to take jokes such as these too far though. 
- Another game he tends to play a pretty fair amount is Minecraft. He's had so many different arcs where he does so many different things at this point. I'd say he's one of the more established players in EN (along with Uki obviously), but please correct me if I'm wrong. 
- He doesn't handle horror very well. For example, he was only willing to play the Mortuary Assistant with Vanta while drunk. Speaking of that stream, it's absolute gold. 
- Also, I know that he doesn't really make them as much as he once did, but if he ever makes ego jokes please note that they are just jokes. He doesn't actually have a massive ego lol. 
- Another thing, his favorite anime is Hunter x Hunter, so that gets mentioned pretty often lol. This one is for the HxH fans out there :) 

->**TTT**<-
!~#3D6E64;default;default;5; **Kunai Nakasato**~!
- She has the vibes of the cool aunt who doesn't take anything from anyone. She might be newer, but that doesn't mean she doesn't know how she wants things run. If people don't act right in chat, she makes sure to put them in her place. While I haven't been able to personally stop by very many of her Zatsus (yet), her vibes are so chill. 
- (More to be added later. I'm sorry, but that's all I really know for right now..)

!~#D7D2EB;default;default;5; **Victoria Brightshield**~!
- (Please, I have no clue what to write about her. I haven't really had the chance to watch very much of her). 

!~#7D3CAF;default;default;5; **Claude Clawmark**~!
- Claude is considered "one of the girls" for good reason. For example, during his A Date With Death game play, his reactions were so real. He's one of us, and that's what we love so much about him. He's so relatable. 
- His zatsus are always very comfy. He gives all sorts of useful advice. He's a very laid back and down to earth guy overall. 
- He doesn't just play Valorant, but he actually gives tips too when he plays. Also, during collabs if he sighs and grunts while playing, he's irritated more at himself rather than the other people playing. Those weren't his words exactly, but he has talked about it. 
- You can't forget about his singing voice too. He released a cover of In The Backrooms during his debut. He actually mixed it himself too, and can we talk about how great of a job he did on that? 
- He tends to join in a lot of collabs, but he doesn't always stream his POV. 
- (I'll probably add more to this at some point too, but I'm not sure what else to add, so I'm sorry.)

I love how she’s so nice to her kouhais and tries to make them feel welcome, how she tries to reach out and collab with ex-ID livers, how she stays humble (girl you seriously need to be more confident), how she’s so hardworking and loyal. She’s funny despite her elementary schoolboy-like jokes because her laughter is infectious. We love you Millie! ❤️"~!
