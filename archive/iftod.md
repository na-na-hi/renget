###*Alatreon*

===================================

**`{Transformation}`**

\>hunters everywhere slaying Alatreon and gleefully carving it's body up to make weapons and armor
\>dowhatyouwilli'vealreadywon.jpg
\>strange occurrences start happening in Astera and Seliana as these hunters start acting strangely
\>some begin isolating themselves, others fly into a rage at the tiniest slight, others begin to look down on others while seeing themselves as superior
\>it isn't long before some of them begin to look like the elder dragons they've clearly begun emulating - tiny horns beginning to sprout, dark ebony scale patches spreading, eyes turning a mixture of red and green
\>the researchers work tirelessly to find a connection, but by the time they realize that the sheer unbridled dragon energy in the gear made from Alatreon corpses is the key, it's already too late
\>as if awoken by a thunderclap, the corrupted hunters begin to rise up, shedding their hunter skins and awakening as full Alatreons of their own right
\>Seliana is destroyed in minutes, and Astera soon follows as the horde of awoken Blazing Black Dragons sweep over the New World on wings of destruction
\>after the dust has settled, as if drawn by latent memories, the dragons turn their eyes towards the world they had once left behind as hunters
\>taking wing once more, the former hunters depart across the ocean, their gaze set on the Old World and beyond

===================================

\>Alatreon fight is introduced, but players find that the final DPS check is practically impossible to pass and the resulting nova unsurvivable
\>the end cutscene for defeat shows the Alatreon staring out over the defeated hunters with a critical and unimpressed eye before turning to fly away
\>as imagined, the MH community has been whipped into a rage by this bullshit quest
\>until, after hours of hard work, some hardcore players discover that there is a way to win
\>only after individually completing certain DPS requirements and/or some measurement of an individual player's "skill" during the fight, that Alatreon can be defeated
\>once triggered, instead of Alatreon dying, the monster grabs the hunter who passed the requirements before escaping deeper into the caves
\>the other players are left to wander around during the carve timer (though they get increased end rewards to make up for missed carves), while the taken hunter is sent to a special instance
\>the cutscene begins when your hunter wakes up on a dirt floor in darkness, bewildered, lit up only by the dim light from their scoutflies 
\>"It is folly to think you could have defeated a black dragon," A sinister voice whispers from all around as a pair of red and green eyes regard you from the darkness, "But you fought well enough to catch my eye."
\>the Alatreon steps forward from the darkness into the dim green light, lazily circling your wary hunter
\>"Now come," it says, lying down on its belly and rolling to its side, its thick tail tip curls around to gently bring your hunter closer, "Take what you have earned." and the screen fades to black.
\>afterwards, you are returned to the Gathering Hub with extra rewards and a 5% chance that you gain a baby Alatreon partner who can be named and used in place of your Palico.

###*Anjanath*

===================================

\>Huntress heads out for a gathering expedition to relax from stressful Rock Fucker capturing
\>Has been out gathering and studying all day
\>Sweaty as hell
\>Goes to the open river and undoes armor to bathe naked
\>Anjanath mating season, and a male saunters toward the lake in search of females
\>Huntress washes her cunt, her scent filling the water— causing Anjanath’s miner erection suddenly peaks from each whiff
\>Starts to drool as he sees the naked huntress, cock at full mast. She turns to see him, scared, but noticing the thick 2 ft. cock somehow eases away her thoughts of danger
\>Anjanath stands over her, resting neck and shoulder on the hollowed tree
\>huntress begins to lick and suck off the massive tip before sliding the cock between her tits, and wrapping her wet thighs around his tip— shifting them back and forth for friction
\>Anjanath lets out rumbling and messy pants. His tongue sticks out and drool pools on the stone drop-off into the lake. His cock begins to throb like a beating heart.
\>Huntress moans to him as encouragement, feeling herself getting wetter by the second as her juices trickle onto Anja’s cockhead as she squeezed it with her plush legs
\>Anja digs into the ground below the water with his talons, feeling himself stiffen and swell with oncoming jizz
\>Huntress lays back into the shallow of the water, thighs spread and feet clasping his tip to aim directly at her own plump mound
\>Anja lets out a deep nasally groan as her foot stimulus causes his cock to spew out its thick seed with short, powerful jets
\>Huntress flinches and gasps every time a load shot pounds against her soaking puss, and pooling in the water as it drips down her inner thigh and asscrack
\>Anja tires out, laying its side along the shore of the lake, panting heavily as he gazes over the mess he’s made of the huntress
\>Huntress simply smiles warmly, moaning to him and cleans up before stroking his face lovingly, and nestling into his soft neck fur

###*Black Diablos*

===================================

>I suppose gossiping to the other handlers about your [monster fucker] pard’s achievements and conquests would be a tad different.
>\>“My partner took down a Barroth!”
>\>“My partner hunted a Nargacuga - at night!”
>\>“My partner defeated a Savage Deviljho all alone!”
>\>“My partner, uh... captured a Black Diablos... without any weapons.”
>\>Three pair of wide eyes gaze at you in disbelief and wordless interrogation.
>\>nervoussweating.png

\>Enjoying a meal at the Canteen with your hunter after another successful Black Diablos "hunt", only this time his right arm is in a full cast from shoulder to fingertips.
\>"Wow, what happened to you?!" Another handler-hunter pair pulls up a couple of chairs beside you and sets their meals at the table. 
\>Your hunter brightens up, always eager to talk about his adventures.
\>"So there I was, I'd already mounted her and blown my load-" he begins and you nearly choke on your Kestodon steak when you realize where this is going.
"--Of Wyrmstake Cannon!" You choke out giving him a dirty look and elbowing his side.
\>"...But I could tell she wanted more." he continues, unfazed and to your disbelief.
\>"So I plunged my arm until I was shoulder deep in Black Diablos cloa--” 
\>"C-carves! In Black Diablos carves!" You interject before he can get the two of you excommunicated from the Research Commission.
\> You drive your boot into your partner's shin with all the power your leg can muster and laugh nervously. 
\>The other handler gives her hunter a glance and laughs awkwardly with you.
\>What did you do to get paired with such a stupid, degenerate partner?

---
###*Chameleos*

===================================

>Maybe [Chameleos] is already here but you just can't see him?

\>a random Chameleos out in the wild takes a shine to you and decides to follow you home invisibly
\>sneaks into the village and shacks up in your house, unbeknownst to you
\>you find yourself wondering why things in your house are starting to randomly shake or fall over
\>figure it's just one of those days and decide to turn in early
\>that night you're trying to fall asleep only to suddenly be pulled out of your bed by an invisible but heavy force
\>get your PJs torn off and your mouth stuffed full of something long and slimy feeling before you can call for help
\>spend the night getting molested in all sorts of horrible, sexy ways
\>finally released at daylight, you try to tell everyone what happened only for them to laugh at your "ghost stories" and to take a break from hunting to get more rest

---
###*Fatalis*

===================================

**`{Vore}`**

\>The ashes of Castle Schrade swirl around you, the fires long cooled as the Fatalis' serpentile tongue, long and slender and as thick as your waist, coils around your midsection, drawing you gently close to the monster’s parted jaws.
\>Muggy wetness dampens your clothes where the great tongue applies a gentle pressure around your body, wrapping you gently in a warm, wet bear hug that is intimately tight but just loose enough that you can breathe easily.
\>Squeezed by the organ’s spongy flesh your relatively fragile human body is handled daintily by the thick, ropy muscle coiled around you like a sodden Dalamadur, equally capable of snapping your spine like a twig were it not for the monster’s tender control. 
\>The Fatalis’ body heat, degrees above your own, radiates through the tongue where it presses against you, matching the wet, humid air that rhythmically washes over you from between the monster’s jaws with its every breath.
\>A great golden eye regards you with a clear sense of affection as you’re drawn beside the monster’s face with care, where an affectionate palm laid along the scales of its snout earns you a delicate, constricting squeeze in response.
\>Your feet leave the ground as the Black Dragon rises to stand up, its tremendous weight supported by the thick, corded musculature of its hindlegs and tail.
\>Carefully dropping you into the caging claws of a forehand, you find your stomach dropping away, left on the ground as flared, coal-black wings bare the two of you away into the sky.

===================================

**`{Unbirth}`**
>No one would ever know you were there. She could keep you inside herself for days if she wished and no one would ever find you. And even if they did, there's no way they're taking you from her.

\>strip naked and stash all of your gear somewhere safe, minus a waterproof pack full of the essentials you'll need for your "expedition"
\>as planned earlier, your Fatalis mate lowers herself down on you, raising her tail high enough to spread and expose her cloaca wide, already dripping with anticipation
\>she's so large, yet her cloaca is still tight enough that you have to put a good deal of work into wedging yourself through her opening and pulling yourself inside her
\>she cums several times during this, forcing you to hold on lest you get ejected prematurely
\>thankfully her internal cloacal muscles help do most of the work once you're a good deal in, and soon you find yourself pulled into and comfortably nestled in her deepest regions, surprisingly roomy and with her excited heartbeat all around you
\>spend the next few days literally living inside her, utilizing your pack supplies to sustain yourself and even take a few notes on the experience in the process while your surroundings occasionally shift as she goes about her business
\>still, it's an incredibly hot experience for both of you - you find your "work" constantly interrupted by her rubbing the general location of where you rest with her claws, and your occasional intense bursts of libido as you rub your naked, fluid-covered body against any place inside her that can accommodate your member
\>these movements of yours also have an effect on her - just your body being inside her is enough to keep her constantly aroused and on the edge, but when you start working to get yourself off, she's often forced to drop what she's doing and let off an enormous orgasm right where she stands/flies/rests/hunts, usually accompanied by rough trashing and a muffled roar from where you are, plus a fresh dousing of her femcum, utterly suffusing you with her scent
\>eventually she pats your location in an unmistakable fashion, and you pack up to begin the work of pulling yourself out of her
\>the first breath of fresh air is like ambrosia to you, but you still find yourself sad that the fun had to come to an end
\>at least you got a thorough cleaning from her long tongue, and some comfy cuddle time with her to dry out before retrieving all your gear and heading back home

===================================

>[In response to an [image of a palico in Fatalis gear](https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1602/10/1602106661105.png)]

\>pic
\>you're meeting with the hunter leadership about the threat of Fatalis
\>unknown to them, you're desperately trying to think of a way to get what is actually your secret Fatalis mate out of harm's way without her getting killed
\>that's when your Fatalis kid wanders into the middle of them all curiously, likely having followed your scent
\>your heart drops like it was launched from a cannon when you finally notice them
\>somehow the other hunters haven't noticed them yet, focused as they are on strategizing as they stare at the battleground before you all
\>noticing you, your Fatalis kid excitedly trills and bounds up to you, their already huge tail wagging back and forth with a swishing sound as their overly large hatchling head bobs humorously at the end of their long neck
\>your sweating must be audible beneath your armor as your kid keeps looking between you and what the group is all staring at
\>slowly, carefully, you try and edge yourself around the edge of the group towards the door, quietly shushing your kid as you nudge them towards the door, praying the dragging sound of their tail and claws doesn't alert the other hunters

---
###*Glavenus*

===================================

>Why is there so little female Glavenus art that isn't dickgirl stuff? I wanna be dommed by an angry living greatsword gf who doesn't need a dick to do it. 

\>TFW you will never be invaded by a Glavanus as you're starting your hunter career and just gathering.
\>She will never see how pitifuly weak you are and easily pin you to the floor with just one of her muscular firm legs.
\>She will never threaten to cleave you in half with her large powerful tail that's nearly twice your size if you don't start fucking her wet dripping cunt right then and there.
\>She will never then drag you off to her makeshift cavern home and force you to keep breeding her for weeks with little to no breaks in an effort to train you to be stronger.
\>You will never begin to enjoy your new life as Glavenus' only mate, eventually taking the initiative in pinning her to the floor with your newfound strength over the weeks.
\>You will never eventually have your Glavenus wife hug you in the afterglow of your passionate fucking, quietly thanking her for making you the strong hunter you became.

===================================

>\>Miscellaneous everyday actions being mistaken for courting

\>be GS user hunting Glavenus
\>your weapon drops to yellow sharpness; your sword is so dull it feels like you're swinging a hammer around
\>clueless Rathalos comes around, attracted by the noise, starts a turf war with your mark
\>perfect timing!
\>you drop to the ground, off to the side, with your whetstone and start grinding back up to white
\>the Glavenus knocks the red clown away and starts staring at you peculiarly
\>oh fuck, you start grinding faster, you can't stop or else you won't get that perfect edge
\>instead the monster sits beside you and takes its tailblade in its jaws
\>it starts sharpening its blade, making a soft rumble in its throat and looking down at you still grinding away with great interest in its eyes...

---
###*Izuchi*

===================================

 \>Go out on first large monster hunt against a Great Izuchi
\>Spend the next few minutes avoiding its quick tail attacks from both it and its little minions
\>Suddenly, Great Izuchi jumps back and roars into the air
\>Roll towards it to avoid the upcoming tail slam
\>Get hit by the base of its tail, knocking you down with Great Izuchi's rear right above you
\>At least it wasn't the blade end
\>Try to get up, only for the monster to press you down on the ground with its haunches, taking all of the air out of your chest as the Great Izuchi trills at you
\>Try to wirefall out only to realize that you wasted both of your bugs on a missed silkbind attack
\>The two companion izuchis come and rest themselves on your arms, locking them in place as you realize the situation you are in
\>Great Izuchi doubles down, rubbing and grinding its backend on you with enough force to hold you still, but not too much to utterly crush your skull
\>Desperately squirm under it
\>The only thing you can see is its rear at this point, with the somewhat smooth texture of the monster's underside scraping along your face
\>Your struggles die out as you resign yourself to this punishment

===================================

>>Do monsters dream of [thicc hunter thighs](https://s2.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1622/28/1622287717774.jpg) crushing their head?
>Imagine trying to mount a monster's head in order to score a clean KO
>The last thing they felt before succumbing to blunt force trauma was your thighs crushing their head/snout/beak 

\>Be a hunter from Kamura Village
\>New stockpile from the Smithy showcase their newly featured layered armor 
\>See several semi-naked buff hunters outside flexing their guns
\>Ask how they gained such gains
\>Be led to hunting several Rajangs and be screwed by desire sensor several times
\>Several hunts later, you acquire peak perfection
\>Urge to fashion mix intensifies but you decided to be risky today and wear only the provided spandex brief
\>Strangely feel warm despite being in your birthday suit in the middle of the mountains
\>Wearing nothing more than ass-tight banana hammock somewhat makes you feel confident
\>As if you wanted to flex and nothing more...
\>Shake yourself out of your narcissistic stupor and wander around the area of the ruins
\>Swing around with your wirebug and fail to land sometimes due to being distracted at how jiggly your thighs are
\>As much as fun it was fake exposing yourself in nature, you have the urge to fight something
\>Your muscles call for battle, and they hunger for tender flesh
\>Hear various screeches in the other side of the valley and investigate
\>Landing ontop of a mountain, you see a Great Izuchi with its pack not too far behind
\>You fling your wirebug high into the air and land infront of it with a pose 
\>Flex for good measure
\>It does it signature call and the rest of its pack assemble behind it
\>All the lesser bird wyverns try to swarm you
\>Key word tried as they got face full of your gigantic Hammer
\>Again, every swing leaves you with a pose
\>You imagine everytime you flex your muscles, they sparkle with joy from battle
\>The rest of them tumble away as the Great Izuchi charges at you 
\>Dodge it with a wall run and mount yourself over its head
\>Your muscular legs somewhat hinders your grip on it due to the sweat
\>Clench them tighter around their skull as they try to shake you off
\>Start to hear heavy breathes, possibly due to asphyxiation caused by your thunder thighs
\>They start to slow down as you reel in your hammer back
\>You see an opportunity... Now!
\>With a mighty swing of your hammer, you knock it out with a solid slam to the face
\>It falls down with a pathetic groan
\>You were about finish it off but you stop yourself
\>Surely slaying this monster would net you some rewards but...
\>...but you are better than this
\>It was nothing more than a weak monster trying to survive
\>While you were a veteran hunter that slew hundreds if not thousands of its kin that were ten times strong than it
\>Striking a thinking man pose, you try think of a way of this sudden dilemma 
\>Yes! You are better than this
\>Praise this monster that fought well today
\>It satisfied your call for battle so you must spare it for trying its best
\>You point your finger as sweat glistens into the air giving you a fabulous atmosphere
"You are a worthy sparring partner!" You shout out despite the monster being knocked out cold to even hear you
\>With your declaration, you walk away to return to Kamura Village, flexing and convincing other hunters of your self discovery today

\>Be a regular izuchi
\>You just got your ass handed by a naked hunter
\>Normally your boss would be able to handle most of them by sitting on their face and letting you and the pack steal their rations and food
\>But this one manage to evade every single face-sitting setup and clonk all of you out in the process
\>Also be surprised and dissappointed that your alpha is alive
\>Dammit you were sure you were gonna lead the whole pack after their death
\>You even planned on making new face-sitting strategies
\>Nevertheless try to wake up your alpha for a good hour
\>Their eyes open bloodshot and stand up
\>See them use their front claws to massage their cheeks as their tongue lulls out, licking around their face
"Boss! Boss! You ok there?"
\>Their maw opens a bit with a stutter
"Boss?"
\>You wave your claw infront of them as their face refuses to move an inch
\>Their eyes don't respond as drool begins to leak out of their open mouth
\>Heavy breathes paint your face as you try to listen in on they are whispering
\>[spoiler]\"T-Thighs"[/spoiler]

###*Jaggi/Jaggia*

===================================

Imagine if your palico started teaching you rudimentary Monster to fill the idle hours between hunts, only for you to find out that they're all raunchy as fuck when they aren't focused on hunting.
\>jog through a jaggi nest on your way to the target's location
\>the Great Jaggi and his male cronies aren't home, leaving only the female Jaggia, who look up as you go stomping through
\>"Oh, look girls, a hunter!"
\>they all start catcalling you
\>"Yoo-hoo! Hunter-boy! Come have some fun! The Alpha and his gang aren't home yet, we have plenty of time!"
\>"They haven't given me any attention in weeks! You're not going to leave a girl hanging, are you?"
\>"Oh no, I'm so heavy with eggs. I sure hope a big, strong male claims and fertilizes them before I have to lay. It'd be such a waste, otherwise..."
\>You just keep your gaze forwards and keep running, scowling a bit as you hear your Palico snickering now that he knows you can understand them.

===================================

>That does make me think of a silly idea where a monster just one day came up to some small village and "took" it over. Nothing extreme like forcing the villagers to do its bidding but instead more like a gigantic cat that keeps pests and other monsters away as long as it's kept well fed. If the villagers treat it good then it'll just lounge around all day and not destroy your house. Other than feeding it and maybe grooming it every once in a while the villagers are free to do whatever. Don't know what current monster would fit best for this "position" though.

\>an aspiring Great Jaggi, sick of losing members of his pack to Hunters and other monsters, decided to solve the issue directly
\>one day, he bravely led his pack right into the heart of a small human village tucked deep in the forest, effectively taking over the Hunterless village simply by refusing to leave, no matter how much the villagers put up a fuss
\>over time, the uneasiness between the two species softened, Jaggi could be seen lounging in the shade of the streets, hunting packs made up of humans and monsters brought back more food than either species could alone, and farmers tending fields were aided by the Jaggi’s strength in pulling plows and defending the crops from invading pests
\>Jaggia joined the human mothers in their nurseries, caring for and defending the human and monster babies alike, while other monsters chose to live with human families as a sort of protector, ensuring no harm came to those humans they considered their pack 
\>the enigmatic Great Jaggi was given a raised, covered pavilion in the center of town, where one can often find elders playing board games in the shade, watched over by his lazy eye, lounging among his harem of Jaggia, and well-fed by the scraps given him by the village’s young children

---
###*Kirin*

===================================

**`{Male Impregnation}`**

\>Be huntress(male)
\>The other hunters make fun of you because you're small and the jerk smithy refuses to make you any male armor
\>He says that fitting it to your 'feminine' frame is too difficult when you can just wear girl armor
\>You'll show them!
\>You manage to wrangle yourself a highly prestigious quest:
\>A Kirin egg has been discovered, the first ever documented Elder Dragon egg, and you've managed to convince the guild to assign the task of retrieving it to you
\>The egg glows with a dull blue light, and it feels pleasantly warm to the touch
\>As you lug the thing back to camp, the moment you had been hoping to avoid comes:
\>The mother...
\>Father? Do Elder Dragons even have genders?
\>The owner of the egg, Kirin, is standing before you
\>If it's upset about you taking its egg, it isn't showing it
\>It softly whinnies as it slowly approaches you
\>You try and run away in a different direction, but it quickly hops in front of you and cries out, causing you to fall back onto your butt
\>Kirin places a hoof on top of the egg and begins pressing down
\>To your horror, it begins to push your flesh aside and sink into your belly
\>After it goes in a few inches, your skin starts to creep up to envelop the egg
\>Your belly seals up around it, and it's blue glow and warmth radiates inside of your abdomen
\>You reach up to feel it, and it's softer than expected
\>It doesn't feel like the hard shell of an egg, it feels like a pregnant belly
\>As your eyes adjust to the light coming from inside you, you realize that you can just make out the shape of a baby Kirin
\>The fetus from inside the egg was somehow transferred into you
\>It stirs and begins softly kicking and nudging to explore its new home as the adult Kirin lowers itself to the ground and nuzzles you affectionately
\>You're freaking out and panicking, despite Kirin's attempts to comfort you
\>How the hell is this baby going to come out?
\>If the guys find out that you got pregnant, they'll never let you live it down!

===================================

\>just have to get ahead of the cats
\>there's the cliff
\>and... done
\>you fall down to the area the kirin is in, leaving your palicoes behind as you grapple to a cliff nearby
\>they'll be alright; they'll probably go wait at the camp
\>you drop down off of the small cliff and into the shrubs near the kirin
\>it doesn't do anything, but you can see the monster's pussy, swollen and winking, fluid dripping off of it
\>you quietly take your armor off
\>carefully, with months of practice honed sneaking up to other monsters and planting bombs behind them, you creep up to her
\>as soon as you're close enough, you reach out and push your arm into her pussy
\>it's as slick as can be and you sink into it up to your bicep before you feel her cervix at the very back of her pussy
\>her head shoots up, electricity crackling around her horn and up and down her back as she whinnies, practically screams really, her body shaking
\>after nearly half a minute of her shaking and clenching around your arm, she drops her head, panting, and looks back at you
\>her hooves clatter a bit as she spreads her back legs and lowers herself down to the ground so you can reach her without help
\>you get down on your knees and push the head of your cock against her
\>and jam it up into her
\>she reacts, jerking slightly, lifting her head to look back at you, eyes half-lidded
\>as you lean forward, you grab her flank with one hand and pinch with all four fingers
\>she rolls her shoulders, stretching her neck out at the feeling
\>and then, with your other hand, you reach under yourself
\>as you pull back, you grab hold of her clit through her slick pussy and start slamming into her
\>her mouth gapes open as she whinnies, nowhere near as loud this time, and starts to pant again
\>you've got her right where you want her as you keep slamming into her, the elder dragon panting and nickering in time with your thrusts
\>her entire body shivers again and you feel her clench down on you, her pussy sucking at your cock
\>and milking one of the biggest orgasms of your life out of you
\>she lets out a loud, grumbling moan as your seed splatters across the walls of her pussy, her neck stretching out as she lays her head down
\>and then you grab the pouch you kept with you and pull out three(!) tranq bombs
\>if it ever had a chance to work, then it would be right the fuck now
\>you toss one towards the front of her, and it bursts, causing her to try to stagger up
\>the second one explodes underneath her chest
\>she's acting tired, and a little loopy
\>and the third one?
\>while sticking your thumb into her pussy under your cock and clamping down on her entire clit, you slap her flank as hard as you can with the third one held in your palm
\>she staggers, whinnying again, her legs shaking as she tries to walk off
\>and then collapses into the shrubs
\>softer than the ground at least
\>a few months later, the kirin you caught being the only one to ever be caught, they've just been studying her, and you've been paying her nightly visits
\>and she's been getting a bit fatter, lately, mostly around the lower part of her abdomen

---
###*Kulu-Ya-Ku*

===================================

\>you've been trying to hunt this kulu ya-ku for a week
\>the last time you were out here, you were by yourself
\>your palico had disappeared when you passed the palico village
\>the little bastard had a smug look on its face when it came back
\>the kulu had wrecked you, utterly
\>walloped you in the side of the head with a big-ass rock
\>you woke up sore, with it squatting over you
\>part of your armor was torn open, and your lower body was soaked, wet and cold
\>it was, for lack of a better term, fucking you
\>you'd at first thought it was male, but it didn't have a dick
\>it was riding yours, holding itself up with its forelimbs on that rock
\>it was humiliating when you had to explain to everyone that you'd failed
\>now though, a week later, you want revenge
\>you spent the last week killing every monster that crossed your path
\>people forgot quickly
\>you've got three other hunters with you as backup, now
\>worse comes to worst, if it clonks you again, they can kill it
\>and this time it won't ... rape ... you

\>...

\>you finally track it down
\>and it's just sitting in some cave off the trail you first found it on
\>holding a... rock?
\>no, not a rock
\>an egg
\>not an egg you recognize, either
\>it doesn't match any of the eggs of the monsters you've gone out to hunt
\>but you've never seen a kulu egg
\>the second it notices you, it starts cooing sweetly
\>it holds the egg lower as it saunters towards you
\>confusion washes over you as the other hunters behind you start whispering
\>when it reaches you, it pushes the egg against your chest and, reflexively, you raise your arms to catch it
\>the other hunters burst into some of the most derisive laughter you've heard since about a week ago

===================================

\>good bright
\>collection got bigger
\>1 smooth rock with nice lines and no cracks, look good with others
\>1 shiny hunter with nice fur 
\>have to collect fast, hunter still tired

\>hunter lays on my side
\>fur feels nice

###*Kulve Taroth*

===================================

>\>you'll never be stuck under a big titties kulve

\>when you broke off the gold plating protecting Kulve Taroth's "chest", the last thing you expected was an almost comically large pair of breasts to flop out
\>or her letting off a steamy looking huff of air and suddenly charging you instead of reeling back
\>now here you were, pinned under her massive, scaled breasts, each weighing at least half a ton
\>thankfully she wasn't leaning on you with her full weight, or you would have likely been smothered
\>that didn't stop her from pressing down on you a little harder whenever you tried to wiggle out from under them, however
\>so you were forced to lay here, breathing in her surprisingly pleasant, earthy scent while she cooed and lightly growled at you in a strangely friendly way
\>all while placing a claw atop each breast and kneading them gently, the motions pushing you around under her slightly, digging you into the sandy dirt below
\>you also noticed that she was very warm as well, and getting warmer by the second, no doubt getting a bit excited from playing with herself and her new hunter boy-toy
\>sweat begins to bead on your forehead, and sensing this, she leans her angular head down and licks your face, the expression on her draconic face as close as she could manage to a sweet smile
\>she surprises you when she suddenly squishes her breasts together, and you between them, before thunderously rolling over onto her back, taking you with her
\>keeping her huge sacks pressed together, trapping you between them within the miniature canyon that was their cleft, only your head remains poking out as your full body is pressed and shifted around by the elder dragon's malleable flesh
\>she lets off a happy sounding squeal as she resumes kneading, never taking her eyes off you and your increasingly disgruntled expression
\>thank gog you'd eaten a big meal at the canteen before leaving on the hunt - you had a feeling you were going to be here for a while

===================================

>I'm going to marry someone's [monster] daughter

\>You head over to the Commander's generously-sized home to pick up your date for the evening.
\>"Ah you must be Anon, I've heard a lot about you from my daughter." He greets you at the door, gesturing you in. 
\>"She's still getting ready, why don't we sit and have a chat while we wait?" He motions you further down the hall.
\>You pass an obscenely large kitchen where a Kulve Taroth is breathing fire onto a spit-roasted Aptonoth in an oven.
\>She gives you a wink as you pass by on into what must be a living room.
\>The Commander sits across from you on a couch eyeing you critically as an awkward silence descends upon the room.
\>You squirm on the couch, hoping that your beautiful half-Taroth date would hurry up and rescue you from this situation.
\>He suddenly leans forward, his steely eyes locking onto yours, "There won't be any... mounting on this date. Are we clear?"
\>Before you can choke up an answer he pops off the couch, heading toward a large, pointed object jutting out of what looks like a cannon bore in the wall and bisecting the other half of the room.
\>"Before you answer, you don't mind if I polish my Dragonator, do you?" He says, moving to lay a hand on the giant serrated blades. 
\>You can't form a reply around the lump in your throat.

===================================

>Kulve would be the monster that has that ancient prebuilt computer from 20 years ago that she never bothered to upgrade because she only uses it to order stuff online.

\>go over to El Dorado to help Kulve with tech issues
\>how bad could it be
\>pc struggles to even start up
\>after the long wait you finally see the desktop only for it be bombarded by pop ups 
\>after taking the time closing all the single hunters in your area pop ups 
\>a small rajang appears in the bottom right of the screen asking if you need any assistance
\>ignoring it you open the browser only to see it covered in search bars 
\>as you try to even figure out where to begin the computer crashes
\>afterwards you just decide to use some of Kulves gold to buy a new computer.

===================================

>That does make me think of a silly idea where a monster just one day came up to some small village and "took" it over. Nothing extreme like forcing the villagers to do its bidding but instead more like a gigantic cat that keeps pests and other monsters away as long as it's kept well fed. If the villagers treat it good then it'll just lounge around all day and not destroy your house. Other than feeding it and maybe grooming it every once in a while the villagers are free to do whatever. Don't know what current monster would fit best for this "position" though.
>>Kulve Taroth, but instead of Gajalakas, villagers. And she demands all the gold.

\>Hunter, it's me, the Commander
\>I have an urgent mission for you
\>We've been getting a lot of requests from this one village for everything gold and shiny
\>At first I thought this might have been some one-off thing for a village festival or something
\>But for the past two months they've been constantly asking for more and more gold
\>They've almost bled us dry at this point
\>Then it finally dawned on me
\>Every since we lost track of my- I mean, that Kulve Taroth two months ago that village started up with these requests
\>I've got only one suspicion over who might be causing all this
\>Naturally I would have sent any other hunter to investigate, but this is a special case
\>We're going to need your... expertise as a /trash/ fleet member to settle this problem
\>Think you can handle it? Get a team together and be ready to leave by morning, she'll be waiting

\>You arrive at the village, which seems normal like any other village.
\>With the exception of the innumerable carts with gold that continue to arrive and leave empty.
\>The locals see that you are a hunter from the /trash/ fleet, and immediately welcome you.
\>They grab you by the arms and force you to go to a large hole in the middle of the village, a kind of cavern that was made recently.
\>Everything is covered with gold, the walls, the floor, you cannot even walk well because of all the golden items that are scattered on the floor.
\>And then you see, in the middle of the chamber, a Kulve Taroth resting.
\>She is surrounded by many hunters, who perform different tasks: cleaning her gold coat, polishing her large claws, offering her some food...
\>The locals say that this time she demanded more than gold. Something that only a /trash/ fleet hunter can provide.
\>As they say this to you, Kulve notices your presence, her eyes now sparkle, she licks her own lips and you see on her jaw what looks like a smile.

===================================

\>the Commander returns to his humble abode deep within the Caverns of El Dorado after a hard week of work for the research commission
\>awaiting there is his faithful Kulve wife, already cooking a hearty meal for the both of them
\>he goes back to their bedroom to strip off the bulk of his armor only to notice a gigantic shipping box labeled "Hot Topic"
\>the box is already opened and a trail of packing nuts leads to their closet
\>sliding the huge door aside the commander finds a few new t-shirts hung up on Kulve's side
\>pulling one down reveals a graphic tee which read "One Bad B*tch" in sparkly gold
\>disgruntled, the commander drags the huge t-shirt all the way back to the kitchen
\>"Darling, what is the meaning of this?" he asks
\>Kulve lets out a monstrous roar, which roughly translates to: "Oh, some friends at Velk's book club gave me a gift card for Hot Topic a while back. I forgot to tell you about it because I had to order online, they didn't have the extra large sizes in stock at the store. I just picked whatever looked nice to me since I couldn't read what most of them said. Do you think it looks nice?" 

---
###*Legiana*

===================================

>Is the [Legiana] booty a carve, or is it just a reward for completing the hunt?
>>Capture-only reward. Strangely, you can only claim it at night once everyone in Astera's gone to sleep.

\>Nighttime in Astera, everyone's asleep
\>Take a nighttime stroll to look at your latest capture
\>The legiana is still sleeping soundly under the effect of the tranqs, twitching a bit as it slumbers
\>An incredibly degenerate thought suddenly crosses your mind and you jump the rope onto the platform it's sleeping on
\>Check that no one is watching and slowly slip your hand down between its legs
\>It's definitely female
\>She rumbles a bit at your prodding, spreading herself out a bit
\>You bite you lower lip, wondering if you should really be doing this as you push your fingers in a little deeper
\>Her legs twitch as she lets off a pleasured sounding moan in her sleep, rolling onto her back and leaving herself fully exposed, her talons raised in the air
\>Your hand is slicked with her juices now and you have a raging boner
\>Fuck it, you've come this far, might as well go all the way
\>Dropping your pants, you straddle the base of her tail as you line yourself up with her opening
\>You press yourself in and barely suppress a pleasured groan as you both shudder
\>She's surprisingly snug despite your size difference
\>She seems to be enjoying it too, given the lewd moans and growls she's letting off as you begin to thrust in and out
\>You're so pent up by now that it isn't long at all before you're ready to blow
\>Biting your tongue, you let out a suppressed groan as you cum inside her, her legs twitching and kicking 
\>Considering the implications of what you just did, you hastily begin to redress when you notice one of the researchers staring at you
\>His expression is one of utter shock, half hidden behind his clipboard
\>Wordlessly, he turns and walks off in a way that suggests he didn't see nothing
\>TFW what happens in the New World stays in the New World

===================================

>I want to see this either drawn or expanded upon, novice hunters getting trained up by powerful monsters via sex is a concept I never knew I wanted

\>It's almost scary how fast a Legiana homed in on you when you started testing out your new glider mantle and ate dirt on your first few attempts
\>Her immediate reaction was to snatch your pack of food off your back and fly away with it, leading you on a merry chase through the coral highlands
\>You're forced to use the glider mantle just to keep up with her, eventually "cornering" her in her nest
\>You're too exhausted to fight by this point, so she easily pins you down and fucks you with gusto
\>Afterwards she flies away with your pack again, leaving you just enough food to get by for the next day
\>This repeats over the next week or so, your stamina and proficiency with the glider mantle increasing with each passing day
\>Soon you start turning the tables on her during your chases and sparring matches, and one day you end up claiming her instead of the other way around
\>She rewards you with a loving nuzzle and your long-since-empty pack back, and you give her a big hug around her long neck, thanking her for the training
\>The moment you set foot back in Astera, you hit the canteen and eat yourself into a celebratory food coma

===================================

>\>there's an optional quest to hunt a Legiana that stayed behind in the Coral Highlands while all the others migrated
>Ten zenny says she has a hunter mate she's staying behind for. Truly the most loyal monsterfu.
>>Or maybe they were left behind

\>Reaching up the last few feet, your hand finds a grip on solid ground, pulling yourself up from the vines and ending the arduous climb.
\>Any plans to stop, to collect yourself, to possibly take an alluring drink of water, take an immediate backseat as you spot a large figure on the opposite side of the nest, perched precariously near the cliff's edge.
\>There it is.
\>Its back faces you, offering a clear view of the diamond-shaped pattern found on every member of its species. Wings tucked neatly to the side, its head remains motionless as it stares into the distance.
\>Despite the recent climb, it's only now that you feel your blood pumping, heart beating noticeably faster in preparation for the familiar event to come.
\>You set off. A slow, steady pace that gives you time to mentally compose yourself.
\>This one was said to have stayed behind after the rest migrated to colder pastures. The Chief Ecologist wants a specimen to study, and you're the one to get it done.
\>It'll be captured of course. No need for a pointless death in the name of science.
\>Your boots offer no form of noise reduction as you make your way forward, though it doesn't matter. Monsters never flee on first sight, and an apex predator like this is far from the exception.
\>As you near the target, you reach to your back, unsheathing your Switch Axe into its axe form.
\>The familiar sharp, metallic grating of shifting weapon parts is calming to your ears, soothing the tingling nerves that creep up on you before every hunt.
\>Not that there's any fear. You've learned to treat every adversary with respect. Arrogance and overconfidence only lead to unexpected injuries at best.
\>The act of brandishing your weapon does not go unnoticed, however.
\>The Legiana twists its head to peer behind itself, the action occurring so slowly, so deliberately it reminds you of a person who's been disturbed from their peace. Which is exactly the case here.
\>A yellow eye meets yours, and you stop, axe extended in front of you as you shift into your default stance.
\>The rest of its body follows suit, wings unfolding to steady its balance while it drops to a more appropriate height for movement. Throughout this, its gaze never leaves yours.
\>You take a deep breath as you stare down the intimidating creature now fully facing you. Its expression is unreadable, but you know its not happy to see you.
\>They never are.
\>Seconds tick by as the pair of you remain motionless. When dealing with an aggressive species, you refuse to make the first move.
\>A shift of its head tightens the grip on your axe, and you know its finished sizing you-
\>With a mighty flap of its wings, the Legiana goes airborne, producing a gust of wind that does nothing to break your steeled concentration.
\>You're familiar with flying wyverns and the advantage they hold over your grounded form. Nothing a few flashpods can't-
\>It flies away.
\>...
\>Your brain goes on hiatus as you dumbly stare at the retreating figure putting tens of meters between you by the second. However you eventually you snap out of it, literally shaking your helmet-clad head to dispel the fuzz clouding your thoughts.
\>It flew away. Legiana NEVER flee from a fight unless they're injured.
\>That wasn't even a fight. Did it take one look at you and decide it wasn't worth the trouble?
\>In any case, your target is getting away. Thanks to your elevated position you can clearly see its flight path, though your scoutflies have already attuned themselves to the wyvern.
\>Beneath your confusion is a growing annoyance over the increased trekking you're being put through.
\>You hate climbing.

-

\>Of all the places it chose to rest, it HAD to be on a piece of lone coral far above the others.
\>Your scoutflies directed you up a particularly steep cliff; you now stand at the opposite edge, a gentle breeze cooling you off as you observe the elusive Legiana.
\>Just like your first encounter, it perches on the edge of the makeshift platform, eyes trained on the unknown. It's practically statuesque.
\>For once in your hunting career, you wish you could approach this Legiana in a more subtle manner. The last thing you want is to be sent on another wild chase through the highlands, but there's no other option.
\>With a sigh, you leap.
\>The fall is over in a second, your armor and bag rattling as you execute a sloppy three-point landing. You're quick to recover, keeping a sharp eye on the Legiana who has now undoubtedly been alerted to your presence.
\>Thanks to your drop point, this time it only needs to turn its head to the side to spot its chaser. Instinct is screaming at you to unsheathe your weapon, but you remain still.
\>The flashpod loaded in your slinger is all you need.
\>Unlike before, it makes no effort to fully face you. Two sharp eyes bore into yours, inducing another silent standoff.
\>Then it growls. A low, warning hiss that bumps up your heart rate more than any marathon climb could hope to achieve.
\>You take a single, methodical step towards it. Then another. And another.
\>It's aggravated. Either it'll attempt to skedaddle again or it'll finally attempt to defend itself. Both are exactly what any monster would do.
\>...Which is why you balk when the Legiana turns back to its gazing, having seemingly lost interest in you.
\>Exposing its back to a potential threat? Something is definitely wrong here.
\>A few steps forward now places you in reasonable striking distance. You're all too familiar with the motions needed to unsheathe, morph to sword form, and slice your target. In the Legiana's current position, you could likely get a few good swings on a folded wing, crippling its flight capability.
\>But its behavior is throwing you off, making you second guess your approach.
"Hey..."
\>If some part of you planned on saying more, you'll never know.
\>You become dimly aware of something quickly approaching from your left front, and just barely bring up your arm in a feeble attempt to guard from what the lizard part of your brain recognized as a bad thing before your conscious did.
\>A navy blue tail smashes into your side, the world losing direction as you're sent sprawling into the ground and tumbling a couple meters away.
\>This is normally the part where you'd get up while swearing profusely to yourself for being dumb enough to be caught off guard by a surprise attack.
\>Instead, you rise to a sitting position, head swimming from everything BUT the tumble.
\>That... didn't hurt. At all.
\>Monsters' warnings consist of painful swipes and bites that serve as a sample of what's to come if you make the questionable decision to stay and fight. 'Go away or else!'
\>What you just experienced was the equivalent of having a pillow thrown at your face.
\>You've been stunned from nasty hits, but now you're unable to move due to sheer confusion. All you can do is stare at the unmoving Legiana paying no mind to the hunter it recently walloped.
\>As your befuddled mind starts to collect itself, the wyvern looks over to your sitting form.
\>This stare-down doesn't have the same intensity of the previous two. Still, its eyes eventually narrow but no warning growl accompanies it. Instead it faces forward, letting out a hushed warble. Following that is what can only be described as a sigh, its frigid breath crystallizing the air around its beak.
\>Any desire to fight has long since evaporated. Now you're intrigued by this creature.
\>You stand up, the action prompting no response from the Legiana. Even as you take a step forward, nothing.
\>No antsy tail whips. No warnings. Not even a sideways glance is spared upon your arrival, placing yourself next to the indifferent biped. It stands multiple heads above yours thanks to its posture, making you feel just a bit more insignificant in the world.
\>Even now, while curiosity pushes you to take questionable actions, you're somewhat on edge. Being this close to any monster without a deployed means to defend yourself can spell disaster if they decide to take a chunk out of you.
\>You must appear a fool, head awkwardly craned up to gawk at this anomaly, yet the Legiana doesn't budge.
\>Turning to face the vast reaches of the highlands, you scan the horizon for anything that could hold a monster's interest for so long.
\>It's a beautiful view, but nothing notable turns up. You know beyond the tall mountains lies the wastes; further beyond leads to Astera and the forest.
\>Breaking away from the picturesque view, you're surprised to see the Legiana peering down at you.
\>It's almost... humanlike with how it observes you.
\>Through the years you've grown accustomed to sharp eyes of anger and grimaces of pain, not this muted, soft gaze that carries not a shred of hostility.
\>Something has been nagging at you for several minutes, but only now does it demand attention.
\>It's a dumb thought. You're not dealing with a human right now. Yet with the current situation and your observations, you feel compelled.
\>The action is second-nature.
"What's wrong?"

===================================

\>Your Legiana daughter bounds into your office from the living room with a chorus of squeaks and trills.
\>She climbs up the fabric of your pant leg using her claws and tiny needle teeth.
\>Planting herself in your lap, she looks over the edge of the desk at whatever it is you're working on before climbing up and dancing and squeaking in front of you to catch your attention.
\>Laughing, you scoop her up, despite her wiggling protests, and head into the kitchen where her larger mother is carefully cutting up a steak with her talons.
\>You swipe a piece and a couple of crackers for yourself before fleeing the kitchen.
\>The two of you collapse on the couch, where she worms her way into the crook of your arm before staring up at you with warm adoration.
\>You carefully feed her strips of the meat while caressing her back with a finger.

===================================

>It's probably the best when the anon in our story makes the most logical decisions.

\>A Legiana swoops down on a low rank hunter on a gathering mission in the Coral Highlands
\>She interrupts his mining with a blast of icy wind, mantling her wings and flaring her head crests, bobbing her head to her own rhythm all while keeping her golden eyes on the frightened hunter
\>Pirouetting and wriggling her sinuous body, she ends her mating dance by flopping onto her back in front of the hunter with her legs spread wide
\>Realization dawning on the hunter, he stares over her flushed belly scales and the slit of wet, pink flesh that stands stark against the creamy white scales of her rump
\>He glance up to meet her half-lidded eyes over the curve of her frosted chest while the tip of her tail idly twitches in expectation
\>She spreads her legs wider, sharp, long, attractive talons that would catch any male wyvern's eye flex in the air while she waits for her chosen to court her
\>The hunter's trained mind quickly recovers from his shock and makes the most logical decision, pulling an item from his bag and throwing it to the ground in a puff of smoke
\>His Wingdrake appears suddenly, and the hunter catches it's dangling lanyard, returning to Astera to vomit and vow never to return to the Coral Highlands 
\>The Legiana watches the Wingdrake and her potential mate disappear over the horizon with sadness; dejectedly, she returns to curl up in her nest, alone
Logical decisions lead to unloved monsters, and we wouldn't want that, right?

---
###*Malfestio*

===================================

>I want Malfestio to trick me into fucking her!

\>After a romantic dinner at the Horns Pub, you and your Malfestio gf drunkenly stumble back to your Soaratorium room
\>She's sprawled out on the bed practically begging for the Big Hunter Greatsword
\>You bury your face into her chest as you line up your diamond hard erection with her untouched nethers
\>You get a nosefull of confusion dust
\>Your partner is left speechless as you jump off, put your clothes back on and leave
\>Some time later you come back to your senses and hear sobbing below deck
\>Another perfect night ruined

---
###*Mizutsune*

===================================

\>You've always had a passion for monsters
\>Which is why you applied to be a Hunter, so that you can stab them with swords and bash them over the head with bagpipes
\>Unfortunately the Guild's standards are very high, and your 20/30 vision didn't cut it
\>You did study as a researcher for a while, but knowing that you'll never be allowed in the field to go toe-to-toe with the monsters themselves really saps your motivation
\>You gain enough knowledge to make it in the private sector, however, and are hired by a wealthy Wyverian aristocrat
\>She owns a pet Tamamitsune, and it's behaving like the wild animal it is
\>It's now your job to train it
\>It doesn't go very well
\>The Tama is very dismissive and disdainful of your attempts to tame him
\>Your boss makes it clear that if you can't deliver results, then she'll look elsewhere
\>To make matters worse, Tama's mating season begins, and he goes into rut
\>Out of desperation, you decide to 'take care' of his lust with a little 'manual stimulation'
\>Immediately the Tama's behavior makes a complete 180
\>He's now a perfect angel; well behaved and well trained
\>Your boss is finally able to show him off for her family and friends
\>He even does tricks!
\>Behind the scenes, you've found yourself in a bit of a jam
\>The Tama is smart enough to know that your ass is riding on your ability to control him
\>And he also knows that there's nothing you can do to take that control
\>Which means that if you want him to continue to play along, then you're going to have to keep trading favors
\>As far as anyone else can see, you have successfully tamed the Tama
\>But behind the curtain, the Tama thoroughly and completely owns you

===================================

>\>slutty soap dragons going out power bottom fucking all the straight male monsters and hunters they come across 
>\>being sexually harassed by a monster that wants your dick in him

\>Hunter soloing Tempered Deviljho in the new world with hammer.
\>Hard fought battle of raw strength and quick wits/prediction, both sides exhausted as fuck. But as soon as one of them lands this final hit, it's back to the bitches for them and 6 feet under for their opponent.
\>They both go for the final strike.
\>Only to suddenly slip and slide past each other.
\>Wondering what was going on, the hunter and Jho give a temporary truce as they saw two shadows dashing back and forth through the trees and bushes.
\>"Probably a Tobi and Odo," the hunter thought.
\>Instead, two Tamamizutsune jump out from the foliage.
\>"THE HELL? SINCE WHEN DID X MONSTERS EXIST HERE?!"
\>Drawing his weapon, the hunter found out his armor slipping off. "Not good, I wasn't prepared for this shit."
\>One of the Tamas gets up close and personal, casually smacking his hammer aside, then pinning him to the ground.
\>Turning to Jho, thinking he'll get the hunter out of this mess, he's already getting power-bottomed by the other leviathan with little struggle.
\>Feeling an odd sensation rush through him, the hunter looks back, seeing his new enemy lightly sucking his dick.
\>"But wait a second, don't Tamas breathe bubbles and shit?" That's when it hits him, Mizu wasn't just blowing the hunter, he was lubing him up.
\>Hearing Jho's cries and roars of protest and pleasure, the hunter knew that he would soon join him.
\>"As long as this doesn't turn me gay for monsters, I guess."
\>It did.

===================================

Spotting Mizutsune from a distance!
Slowly moving towards Mizutsune!
Freezing in place as Mizutsune sees you!
Slowly losing fear and keep moving towards Mizutsune!
Freezing in place again as Mizutsune hisses at you!
Keep moving towards Mizutsune anyway!
Standing less than a feet away from Mizutsune!
Staring into Mizutsune's eyes as it growls at you!
Running your hands through Mizutsune's fluffy chest!
Bleeding from your arm after getting bit by Mizutsune!

===================================

\>You lay your weapon at the door of the oversized cottage so graciously provided to those heroes of the /trash/ fleet who have returned from Astera, and who, much to the Guild’s chagrin, have continued their lifestyles back in the Old World. 
\>Removing your muddy sweat-soaked boots at the door, they peel away from your aching, blistered feet like the skin of a carcass, releasing a noxious miasma that complements the BO one can only attain by sleeping, sweating, and hunting for a week in the same gear.
\>You pass through the large dwelling on sore legs on your way to the ice chest and the cold, refreshing Dragon Ales waiting there for you, mind already wandering to the hot bath you look forward to soaking your aching body in when you’re drawn by the smell of fresh blood, finding three fresh Gajau waiting to be butchered in the kitchen—your wife’s hunting must’ve gone well today.
\>Starting a fire beneath the kitchen’s spit to roast your own dinner (the other members of your family appreciating rarer meat), you emerge into the family room to find that your Mizutsune mate lays preening her long foreclaws on the stuffed patchwork of skins and blankets that passes for her personal lounge cushion.
\>The tatters of wyvern language you’ve picked up from the Wyverians make enough sense of the mix of her snarling and cooing to understand “son” and “bath” as you come close enough to be encased by her hugging foreleg within the sweet-scented fluff that lines her chest. 
\>Diverting your path into the back garden, after running a bath in the washroom, you tiptoe into the space like it’s the beginning of a hunt, yet it doesn’t require much tracking ability to spot the iridescent trail of suds that leads from the path to your cottage out into the bushes like a slug’s slimy track.
\>Creeping over to the bush that the soap trail leads to (and from which you can hear soft giggling), you suddenly brush the leaves aside, revealing a smaller version of your wife staring up at you with a surprised expression and a loud squeal.
\>Probably realizing what time it is, and being too smart for his own good, instead of happily jumping into your arms, the exposed tiny Tama tries to dart between your legs to escape.
\>However, having years of Hunter training under your belt, with expert reflexes you grab your son before he can flee, wrestling the slippery, squirmy, squealing Mizutsune from the underbrush.
\>He’s harder to hold on to than a fresh-caught fish, wiggling madly within your arms to escape, just old enough to understand the correlation between dad and the before-dinner bath, and dripping with the slick suds he has yet learned to control that make him all the more uncontrollable.
\>Dashing back into the washroom, concentration split between wrestling your slippery son under control and avoiding tripping on his dripping suds, you unceremoniously drop him into the tub with a splash.
\>His squeal at being suddenly dropped cuts off as he disappears beneath the water, only to resurface a moment later with a fresh bout of giggling, already a master of swimming despite not being two seasons old.
\>With a sigh of relief, you crouch beside the wash basin, submerging your hands into the water to scrub the soap from his body.
\>Getting him into the bath is always the hard part, but once within the tub he becomes a different monster, content to swim around happily and splash you with his antics.
\>The little Mizutsune’s built-up lather is quickly rinsed away, creating a bubble bath of suds from which he enjoys hiding within to take potshots at you with the water beam he has lately learned from his mother’s training, to your begrudging amusement.
\>Fed up with being soaked, you remove him from the water; now rinsed through, he’s much easier to control, and after drying him with a towel, you let him loose from the bathroom to go bother his mother for a bit while you take a moment to relax.
\>With a warm bubble bath beckoning, you remove the last of your clothing and slip into the hot, sudsy water, already feeling the day’s dirt loosening from your body and warm heat seeping into tired muscles.
\>Your eyes slip closed, drowsiness overcoming you as you’re lulled into relaxation in the splendid water—until a ball of white scales and purple fur scampers through the doorway, cannonballing into your bath and sending a wave of soapy water washing over your face that leaves you both spluttering with laughter.

===================================

>I want to bang a Tama!
>>Bang, or get power-bottomed by? Think carefully.

\>It's now been a month since you were paired with a promising trainee to help get comfortable with your reassignment to a foreign land; many a village hospitable towards the new hunters sent to deal with their problems
\>Everything's been going rather smoothly, a few odd jobs here, removing pesky Bird Wyverns there, stuff you're all too familiar with
\>There's just this one, tiny, itty-bitty little thing you still can't fully wrap your head around that nobody but you seems to acknowledge 
\>Your partner is a Mizutsune, a walking, talking, you-sized, humanoid Mizutsune
\>Guild sanctioned practical joke or not, you've been working with a monster, a seemingly shy one at that
\>A pleasant sunset casts your shadow towards this week's accommodation, your companion most likely already settled in while you were haggling locals for food
\>Placing an assortment of meat and vegetables on a low-lying table, you head to the bedroom to continue unpacking
\>Pulling aside a curtain reveals a lithe naked form
\>An alluring sight that provokes the inner storm
\>Both parties flustered, the silence a prison
\>One can't help but notice the penis that's risen
\>...
\>You're not a Research Commission degenerate, you wouldn't have sex with a monster 
\>But...
\>Mutual rapid-fire apologies devolve into confessions of attraction, the Leviathan no longer making an attempt to hide his erection
\>Tossing away your clothes, you slowly run you hands up his body, the feeling of lightly soaped scales and fur quickly bringing you to full-mast
\>You give the Mizutsune a quick kiss on the snout and bend him over the bed
\>Carnal desire now at the wheel, you slowly press your manhood into his surprisingly slick tailhole, the action rewarded with a moan
\>Forming a steady rhythm of thrusts, you repeatedly hilt yourself inside him, with how deliciously tight he is you're not going to last long
\>You inform the monster of your imminent orgasm and hear a faint chuckle
\>Uh-oh
\>He pushes back with all his weight, causing you to fall backwards onto the floor, completely stunned
\>Lying there helplessly, dazed and confused
\>The hunter now the hunted? This makes one amused
\>Now in full control, the dancer mounts his prey
\>"This is over when I say so" is all he has to say
\>The facade cast aside, the once timid Mizu begins slamming down onto you with renewed vigor, his cock dribbling precum
\>Unable to contain yourself any longer, you start flooding his insides, making sure to elegantly milk you for all your worth
\>Exhausted, the Leviathan lets out a sigh 
\>In a final act of defiance, you reach up with a free hand and finish him off, coating your chest in monster fluid
\>"WHEW, QUEST COMPLETE!"

###*Namielle*

===================================

>\>You will never capture an elder dragon with relative ease and question how no one had accomplished it before then
>\>You will never stare suspiciously at the tranquilized elder, wondering if your eyes are playing tricks on you or did their own peek open for a brief second...

\>You nearly drop your weapon in shock when a Namielle invades your fight with a Tzitzi, landing perfectly in your shock trap and scaring away the smaller wyvern you had been fighting before the tranquilizers have a chance to take effect. 
\>The aquatic Elder Dragon let's out a soft cry as it steps foot in the trap and the electricity paralyzes it, spreading it's wings and tail in distress and grimacing in pain.
\>The residual cloud of tranquilizer must've had some effect as the monster suddenly curls up on the trap without you even having to swing your longsword.
\>"Those researchers don't know what they're talking about, you can capture Elder Dragons easy!" You say ecstatically, turning to your Palico for a double high-five completely forgetting the Namielle's control over electricity and how every hunter you'd every apprenticed under had drilled into you that traps didn't work on Elder Dragons. 
\>While you're distracted, you don't see the Namielle, who is supposed to be asleep, discreetly glance in your direction. 
\>The Namielle looks over the Hunter hungrily, squirming on the ground in barely-contained excitement.
\>Unknown to the hunting pair, the monster's dream of being captured and thrown to the whims of a strong human hunter tickles all of it's most tantalizing fantasies sending an illicit shiver running down its spine. 
\>You're too excited celebrating to see the Elder Dragon roll over a little and lift a hindleg to expose it's underbelly and the needy, aching slit nestled there.

===================================

>what monster is the most COMPATIBLE?

Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male hunter and female Elder Dragon breeding, Namielle is the most compatible Elder Dragon for hunters? Not only are they elder dragons, which is mostly compromised of scalies, Namielle are an average of 15”03’ tall and 3.9 tons, this means they’re large enough to be able handle hunter dicks, and with their impressive HP Pool and access to Charged States, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Namielle would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn how to electrostatically stimule your penis, along with not having feathers to hide their cloaca, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Elder Dragon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Namielle turn yellow. Namielle is literally built for human dick. Ungodly attack tactics+high HP pool+Charged States means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.

===================================

\>Be a field researcher
\>Get an assignment to study the sky bugs in the coral highlands
\>Hunter assigned to escort you buggers off five minutes into the field trip

\>Namiel is distraught
\>Just wanted a hot tub date with you

###*Nargacuga*

\>Brace behind your undersized SnS shield for the Nargacuga's telegraphed tail swipe.
\>The wyvern pivots it's hindquarters on stocky legs, its thick tree-trunk sized tail whistles through the air deflecting off of your shield.
\>Droplets of a fragrant, sticky fluid splash across your chest.
\>Look down to see thick rivulets of clear liquid drip from your armor, bridging between your glove's fingers on little filaments when you experimentally touch it. 
\>Look up to see a bright pink slit peeking from between the dark scales of the Nargacuga's rear, shining wetly in the dappled sunlight.
\>You feel a familiar sensation welling up in your pants, the Nargacuga looks flustered but doesn't lower its tail.
\>Welcome to /trash/ fleet.

---
###*Nergigante*

===================================

\>You're out on an expedition in the Elder's Recess
\>Even though you're just here for mushrooms and berries, you feel like you're walking on eggshells
\>Nergigante's cries ring out, echoing through the environment
\>With the pure fury and anguish in his voice, you guess that he must be fighting an elder dragon or something
\>After a while, you notice that you can't hear any other monster's cries
\>And all of the tracks and evidence you can locate in the surrounding area indicates that there isn't anything in the environment right now big enough to cause trouble for a Nergigante
\>Eventually your curiosity gets the best of you, and you sneak down to his nest
\>The ground is littered with shattered and snapped crystals from Nergigante slamming himself into the walls, and his spines are all in similarly poor shape
\>Deep gashes in the walls indicate that he's been scraping his horns against them as well
\>Nergigante is dripping with sweat as he angrily throws his shoulder into a large crystal, and you get a good look at what's causing his frustration:
\>A turgid crimson spire dangles obstinately between his rear legs
\>As you stare at his impressive manhood for a little too long, you don't immediately notice that he's staring back
\>He snorts derisively as starts slowly lumbering towards you
\>You try to back away only to discover that you've accidently backed yourself into a corner
\>He turns around and plants his rear foot on the wall above your shoulder, dangling his cock in front of your face
\>It's a dark, intense shade of red, and you can see the prominent veins throbbing in time with his heartbeat
\>It literally looks painfully erect; you actually feel a little sorry for him
\>The look in his eye as he stares down at you says it all:
\>Either get stroking or fuck off

===================================

\>You're out in the Ancient Forest with a party, hunting a Kushala Daora
\>It isn't going well
\>You wheel around, preparing to thrust your Gunlance into the creature's face, only to taste dirt as you are slammed into the ground
\>As the Elder Dragon prepared to fire a tsunami directly into your face, you are afraid
\>Not of the Kushala Daora, no
\>You're afraid because you know that someone is watching
\>Someone who doesn't like to see you get hurt
\>A black blur slams into Kushala with tremendous force, ripping the creature off of you and throwing it against a large tree in the distance
\>Your comrades stagger back in shock from the Nergigante's sudden entrance as you roughly pull yourself to your feet
\>Kushala tries to get up to respond to the new threat only to be punched about three or four feet into the dirt
\>Nergigante sticks its face within inches of Kushala's and bellows a screeching howl at the top of its lungs
\>You clap your hands against your ears in a vain attempt to shield against the deafening cry
\>When it stops, the Kushala and your teammates are all frozen in fear
\>Releasing the deathgrip around the other Elder Dragon's throat, Nergigante turns away and saunters towards you
\>With a disgustingly smug expression, it brings its muzzle in close and gently flicks the tip of its tongue across your cheek
\>You mumble out a 'thanks'
\>Satisfied, the beast spreads its wings and takes off into the sky
\>Which of course, knocks you on your ass since you were standing right next to it
\>Your teammates silently stare at you for a few seconds as the Kushala scrambles to its feet and runs off
\>"W-what the hell was that!?"
\>You cough
"Uh, you now how it is...sometimes it gets cold while you're out on expedition in the Elder's Recess, and you stumble on a nest, and one thing leads to another..."

===================================

>Would you accept a Nerg raising you like a baby?

\>Ever since you met that strange Nergigante on that fateful hunt, she's taken a real shine to you
\>She always calls you "Sweetie" and is constantly bringing you food and other helpful items during hunts
\>Sometimes she just shows up to offer you encouragement when you're having a rough time of it
\>She also seems to know where you are all the time, almost like she's keeping track of you
\>It's a strange little setup you have going, but you appreciate her being there nonetheless
\>One day she can tell you're having a bad time, several hunts in a row failed
\>Gives you a big hug against her thick body and tells you she'll have something to cheer you up when you get back to Astera
\>You go back to town and your big mansion-like room, only to find that she's snuck into town somehow
\>She's reclining on your bed with an inviting gaze, and pulls you in close against her nude form when you approach her with some confusion
\>"Don't worry, sweetie. Mama's here to cheer you up."
\>You notice she's trimmed all of her spikes down just for you, as she pulls you onto the bed with her, hugging you against her generous bosom
\>All night, she treats you to some of the nicest, most gentle lovemaking you've ever had
\>Despite her ferocious appearance, her voluptuous form makes her very soft and relaxing to lie with
\>She's also very experienced and patient as you explore your way around her body, and gives you some pointers on what she likes while letting you enjoy what you like as well
\>As you press against her again and again, she lovingly hugs your head between her massive breasts and pets your hair
\>You're completely smothered in motherly Nerg, yet more comfortable than you've been in a long time
\>She lets out a contented sigh of pleasure as you finally come inside her, and calls you a good boy
\>You spend the rest of the night in bed with her, as she hugs herself close to you
\>The next day you wake up to the smell of her making breakfast, and she's more cheery and sweet than ever

===================================

\>Hunting Nergigante
\>The blacksmith laughed his ass off when you told him you wanted to wear a wiggler helmet just for that fight, for the sake of it
\>You finally find the creature, but trip during your first attempt at attacking
\>Wiggler helm lightly bumps on its cheeek
\>Air forced out of the helmet made it sound like a smooching sound when it touched its face
\>You get back up, and see a visibly confused Nergigante looking at you interrogatively
\>After a few floating seconds, you noticed some of the spikes on its face became light pink
\>The next second you're pinned down on the ground between the monster's soft paws
\>You get assaulted with a bunch of licks, the latter taking your helm off
\>You can feel Nergigante's thick, warm tongue covering and drenching your face
\>Unable to react, you're forced to accept a few more licks and insistant nuzzling
\>Next thing you know, Nerg picks you up by the back of your armor with its teeth
\>Your legs aren't touching the ground anymore, no way to get free
\>You accept your fate as the creature slowly walks back to its lair
\>Once you both get there, the monster lay down, and resumes nuzzling, its front limbs surrounding you
\>You're probably one of the first living beings hearing Nergigante's happy growls
\>You could swear it was also purring
\>You're not sure what will come next, but part of you is really hoping this Nergigante isn't male

===================================

>\>Wear a set of cosplay armor skins of a Nerg
>\>While on a hunt, one invades, noticing you and abducting you from the fray, having mistaken you for one of its young

\>Get abducted by Nerg
\>She brings you back to he nest
\>Other Nerglings overrun you, nuzzling and licking you
\>You decide it's safer to pretend and nuzzles back, pet them, play fetch with them, and other little games
\>Nerg mommy seems happy, laying down near her kids, watching you all, and displays what you percieve as a smile
\>When the night falls, she curls up, surrounding and covering the little Nerglings with her body and wings
\>You end up between her front paws, with her snuggling you tight
\>You smooch her cheek through your mask, and lay your head against hers
\>Soon you hear her cute, faint snoring
\>You know you'll have to escape at some point, and that makes you feel oddly bad

\>You wake up the next day, Nerg mom is still sleeping
\>Nerglings are already running around, playing with each other
\>You discover with horror that two of them are having a tug war with your mask
\>You see it being ripped in half
\>You realise you have to get away before mother Nerg finds out you're a human
\>You manage to slip out of her embrace, and start jogging towards the exit
\>Nerglings follow you, chirping and pulling the bottom of your costume to get you to stay
\>You lower yourself and give each of them a few headpats and a steak to help them to get over it
\>Before you go you take a last look at the sleeping Nergigante
\>She isn't sleeping anymore, and is looking straight at you
\>Terror seizes you as she approaches, dread making you unable to move
\>She picks you up by biting the back of your costume
\>Goes back to her sleeping place and resumes her nap, holding you between her front limbs like she did the night before
\>You're confused, but relieved
\>You could probably spend a bit more time with them
\>You smile and hug the mother's head before joining her in her slumber


===================================

>Imagine Nerg's pads being a super-sensitive erogenous zone.
>Imagine even the slightest touch from something that isn't the ground being enough to make them highly aroused.
>Imagine forcing one to give you a pawjob for all the trouble they've caused and watching them make a sticky, shuddering mess of themselves the entire time as they cum again and again without having even touched themselves. 

Imagine having a big, horny Nerg all to yourself. He's on his back, legs splayed, vent shamelessly exposed, submitting himself to your humanly desires, which as you would soon find, weren't so "humanly" after all. A single paw of his is big enough to fill both your hands, yet well-rounded enough to allow your thumbs full access to his faded pink weakpoints. You press into them deeply, watching the tough flesh slowly give way to the weight of your prodding digits, much like an expensive cushion, but of course, when a monster like this is part of the equation, who's comparing?. All the while his beautiful penis is standing tall and proud, giving a hard, near-audible throb to meet your firm kneading, the whole process seeming almost mechanical, like an industry floor being brought to life by nothing more than a single button's press, yet all the while managing to avoid your gaze as you were hard at work tending to his subtler features.


===================================

\>Carefully... carefully.
\>You slowly sit, bringing yourself to lean against the rock-face. Despite your best efforts, a sharp twinge of pain courses through you, only a small flinch betraying your composure. Armor pieces lie strewn about the ground, but you can't be bothered to collect them. As far as you're concerned, you've already hunkered in and refuse to move for anything. A soft bed would be preferable given your current state, but you're a long ways away from such luxuries.
\>A fair distance away, your partner-in-crime partakes in their daily ritual, bits of spikes crumbling away as they gnaw at overgrown pieces. You've become used to the constant preening, favoring it over the reckless alternative. As if sensing your vacant staring, the elder's own gaze shifts to meet yours, but quickly loses interest and returns to their task. You don't have to worry about them; any injuries sustained from earlier have likely healed by now. Their own spikes are presumably a bigger hazard at the moment.
\>You've been on your own for several weeks now, with potion materials growing scarcer by the day - as a result, you've taken to enduring the less grievous pains in an effort to conserve valuable resources. A detriment, but your partner undoubtedly views it as an improvement. You've grown accustomed to the scornful glare whenever you procure a flask, the elder viewing your man-made creations as a sign of weakness. No matter how many times you remind them that, no, not everyone has abnormally fast regeneration, it's always met with a disgruntled snort.
\>A stifled yawn escapes you, your afternoon nap long overdue thanks to today's hunt. Heavy eyelids nudge you into slumber, but the periodic throbbing of your injuries deny any chance of rest. You resign yourself to closing your eyes and waiting for the worst to pass.
\>Seconds meld into minutes and by some stroke of luck, drowsiness begins seeping into your weary form. Before you can properly embrace it and drift off to sleep, however, approaching footfalls snap you out of it. Talk about bad timing.
\>Sighing, you resign yourself to fond memories of sleep, though you remain still. The ground faintly tremors with each muted step, though your partner makes no attempt to stifle their approach. When you're at the top of the food chain, it doesn't matter what hears you.
\>Right now, you disagree.
\>Eventually the steps pause and although your eyes are shut, you'd be hard-pressed to overlook the immense presence in front of you. Silence fills the air once more. Piqued by curiosity, your eyelids creep up just low enough to continue feigning slumber.
\>The elder towers above you, investigating your statuesque form with unusual focus. Holding their attention to such a degree typically requires the promise of a nearby meal. You abandon your false nap, curiously staring at your partner who shows no sign of noticing - or likely caring about - your ruse. Two sharp pupils continue to scan you, and if you could see yourself from their view, you're certain it isn't a pretty sight. It's as though they're judging each cut, every scar that was forced to heal on its own. Their eyes linger, likely resting on the purplish blemish enveloping your shoulder and parts of your arm and chest.
\>Although tackling through a strike does reduce the severity of potential injuries, it doesn't remove them entirely. While you're normally careful with what you choose to endure, the Kushala had been getting on your nerves for a while - and *maybe*... you were trying to show off to your partner. To your credit, you took the massive blast of wind without trouble and gave the rowdy Dragon of Steel an impressive concussion. The consequences could come later, and come later they did. Perhaps it was not the best idea to try and out-tough the Eater of Elders.
\>You're unsure if they even witnessed the reckless display.
\>Your mark of pride, thankfully, looks worse than it feels, but it's unlikely that your partner is overly concerned about your wellbeing. You're drawing a blank on what could possibly hold their attention *now* when they’ve always been reluctant to do anything more than begrudgingly acknowledge your capabilities as a hunter. An eyebrow raises in wordless inquiry, the act going ignored as well. From your seated position, it's almost as though a frown is etched on their gruff visage.
\>With a sigh, you roll your eyes and attempt to salvage the fleeting remnants of drowsiness. Two can play the Disinterested Game; since it's not glaringly obvious as to their wants, you'd rather focus on resting. If they could talk, they'd likely belittle you on your injuries anyway. That look says it all.
\>You're granted a few seconds of tense relaxation before you're immobilized, grunting in pain as a massive paw wraps around your figure and roughly jerks you forward. Being manhandled by your partner is a first. You're left powerless but mostly confused while the elder adjusts themselves before lying down and carefully bringing you to rest against their head - albeit still trapped in a loose grip. To your questionable disappointment, their paw-pads aren't as luxuriously soft as you were secretly expecting but it's nonetheless a welcome reprieve from the stone.
\>What in the world brought forth this sort of affection?
\>You peer over to a listless golden eye, the motion causing your partner to finally return the favor and meet your gaze. Another eyebrow raise is met with a grumble that reverberates through you, the elder huffing in feigned indifference before drifting off to sleep and leaving you secured against them. Against your will, you've been reduced to an oversized teddy bear.
\>A foreign, unfamiliar feeling wells up in your chest, and you can't help but smile knowingly while staring at the slumbering form supporting you.
\>Everyone has a soft side.

===================================

\>Be Anyan, Ace Palico and leader of a Tailraider Safari
\>Despite your qualifications, your team is probably the least successful Safari available for hire, for one simple reason:
\>You keep getting raped
\>Every monster hunt, large or small, ends with you and your comrades being vigorously lewded against your will, whether it's being gang-raped by Shamos or bring forced to work together to stroke off a Rathalos
\>Sometimes even gathering missions end with unwanted anal and/or vaginal intrusions
\>Your researcher once ended up getting restrained and having his penis sucked by a Vitalilly
\>The biologist back at Astera says that they aren't even supposed to move, it's just that you're all so 'supremely rapeable' that the plant had to defy its own physiology to touch him inappropriately
\>Despite your track record of non-success, your team is one of the most often hired
\>Maybe they're masturbating to your hunt reports or something
\>Sometimes they even hire you to accompany teams of Hunters out into the field
\>Not to hunt, mind
\>Just to stay at camp and act as 'stress relievers'
\>As rough as a life of being fucked and raped for a living is, it beats your old job of stirring the soup back at the canteen
\>At least you aren't in constant danger of falling into a giant pot of boiling stew and being cooked alive...

\>Be Hunting horn user on a mission with a group in the Wildspire Waste
\>As your group is taking all of your buffing drugs, you notice a Pukei Pukei eyeing you warily from a distance
\>One of the other hunters tells you not to worry about it, it isn't dumb enough to charge a group of fully armed hunters for no reason
\>Shrugging it off, you whip your horn around and start playing a wicked Attack Up (L) jam
\>Whatever reservations the Pukei had are suddenly forgotten
\>It chirps happily as it runs up to your side
\>You and the group are surprised and on edge, but when you figure what's going on, everyone starts laughing
\>It likes your music, and is gently butting you with its head and flicking your cheek with the tip of its tongue to try to get you to play more
\>Everyone makes jokes about you picking up a groupie, and you just roll your eyes and keep playing
\>The Pukei is totally enraptured as you finish buffing your team, but looks disappointed when the music stops
\>It follows you around as you hunt, just out of the way of the action, just so that it can listen to you play as you beat the piss out of Diablos
\>It even tries to sneak into your camp after the hunt is over
\>It's all fun and games now, when there's a whole group to shoo it away, but when the group disbands tomorrow morning, you have to stay behind to complete a different assignment
\>You hope it doesn't become too much of a nuisance...

###*Rathalos*

===================================

\>Be Hunter
\>You're out on a gathering mission when a Pink Rathian swoops down into its nest
\>...wait...
\>Upon closer inspection, you realize that you're looking at a Rathalos with unfortunately weak coloration and smaller size
\>As it starts to settle into its small and messy nest, a Seregios screeches from above and drops onto the Rathalos' back
\>You think you're about to witness the circle of life, but the turgid erection dangling between Seregios' legs makes you think otherwise
\>It bites down hard enough to draw blood on the poor creature's neck as it begins lining its dick up for penetration
\>The numerous scars along the Rathalos' neck, as well as the quickness with which it resigned itself to this fate, makes you realize that this isn't the first time that this has happened
\>Welp, time for your good deed for the day
\>You leap onto the Seregios' back and plunge your sword in as deep as you can manage
\>Literally
\>You didn't fuck it
\>A short scuffle ensues, but since you had the element of surprise you manage to get a good hit on an artery
\>Killing it by causing it to bleed out was sort of satisfying in a poetic way
\>The Pink Rathalos watches nervously from the corner as you wipe the sweat from your brow
\>But when you sheathe your weapon and leave, it starts trying to follow you
\>You manage to shoo it off a few times, but you always catch it watching you from a distance
\>Hopefully it will get bored and go home soon

===================================

>\>Poison-resustance gemmed condoms for Rathians
>\>Doubles as a stimulation boost for both partners
>How can Rathalos even compete? 

\>Be hunter, still trying to do actual hunting despite the rampant degeneracy seizing hunters and huntresses in the New World
\>You're one of the few last bastions of Old-World hunters, solely focusing on hunting
\>Accept a hunt for a tempered Rathalos
\>You find him, in his deserted nest
\>Rathian tracks in the area are old, no eggs in sight
\>Find Rathalos sleeping, he wakes up when you approach
\>He notices you, doesn't get up, just looks at you while still laying down
\>You approach him, unsheathing your weapon
\>With a faint grunt, he gets on his legs
\>Instead of attacking you, he turns around and present his hindquarters to you, still looking at you
\>Just by looking at his begging eyes, you understand that he's so sexually deprived he resorted to beg his enemy
\>He'll do anything so he can have one of his deepest, overwhelming natural desires satisfied
\>You can't stand his desperation and cave in
\>Sadness vanishes as he sees you lay down your weapon and take off your crotch armor
\>Pleasure groans fill the air as you ram his ass hard
\>Shortly followed by both his climaxing roar, with both of you ejacuating
\>His seed pours on the ground, yours marks his depths
\>No matter what you do, he now follows you around
\>He keeps inviting you to breed him, licking your crotch insistantly, presenting his tailhole, or spreaing his slit
\>You realised he gave up on his alpha AND male status just so he could be fucked, and satisfy his new Alpha in the process

===================================

>Rath ain't got no hands, how else is he going to rub someone off and maintain his ever-so-important dominance?

\>fighting a Rathalos in his nest
\>time your dodge wrong and get pinned down by him, your weapon flying out of your hands
\>on your back with the massive wyvern's crushing weight atop you as it roars in your face, embers of flame licking out at you
\>you start saying your prayers as you realize you're monster chow
\>until you feel a tugging at your pants, one of the Rathalos' surprisingly dexterous talons hooked in your waistband
\>with a simple, powerful tug, he rips your armored pants off, the point of his claw catching your undergarments and ripping completely through them as well
\>you have no idea what he has planned for you - maybe he's stripping you naked to make you easier to swallow?
\>your question gets answered when he shakes what's left of your pants off and places his foot, as large as your torso, on top of your exposed dick
\>still heavy enough to keep you pinned, you're helpless to resist as he starts grinding the rough, scaly surface of it against your manhood
\>you gasp at the sensation, the Rathalos using enough force that it's pushing you back and forth slightly over the ground you're laying on
\>struggle as you might, trying to push the massive talon off yourself, you can't possibly hope to match the wyvern's strength
\>he stares down impassionately at you, continuing despite your protests, as though he could feel your erection beginning to grow from his attendance
\>the roughness isn't just limited to the grinding, either - you let out a yelp as the poisoned point of one of his claws nicks you
\>slowly but surely, the poison begins to have an aphrodesiac-esque effect on you in addition to making you lightheaded
\>your erection reaches raging levels in very little time, and now you find yourself begging for release despite your previous unwillingness
\>your rod bobs up between the Rathalos' talons every time he pulls back, before getting pushed back down beneath his tireless, *mercilessly* ongoing grinding
\>he's speeding up now, your sensitivity becoming too much to take
\>finally, after what seems like an eternity, you feel pressure like nothing else build up in your loins and cum harder than you ever have before
\>you shoot so much of the stuff out that you make a huge, sticky mess of yourself and the better part of the Rathalos' foot and leg
\>you dimly realize that you never knew you had so much in you, as you gasp and pant for breath
\>the weight finally lifts off of you, and you manage to prop yourself up on your elbows and look at the Rathalos, now rolling around onto his hindquarters
\>he spreads his powerful legs, foot still covered in your spunk, as he exposes his slit to you, his large member already beginning to poke out
\>even without any words, his continued impassioned staring says it all
\>"I've pleasured you. Now you pleasure me."

===================================

>Might be vanilla as fuck by I'm really curious at what noises and body movements monsters make from nutting really hard. With how different their physiology is in the genital region, I'm morbidly curious at what muscles in there involuntarily contract when they do, where they feel it, and how much, more often than I should. Knowing that the benis makes cums isn't enough to satisfy my curiosity and perversion if that makes sense. Tldr; how does a rath's orgasm feel? Only way to find out is to become one though.

you might try milking him with a hand job first, just to know what you’re dealing with
\>The Rathalos’ cock, heated through by hot wyvern blood, nearly burns the sensitive palms of your hands as you stroke from his spear-like tip down to the thick base of smooth flesh bulging from the scaled genital slit nestled between his legs.
\>His large exotic cock bobs in the air in time with his heartbeat, the thick rod of pointed flesh nearly the size of your forearm and almost spreading your fingers fully apart at the thick base.
\>Heavy musk permeates the air, his precum slick beneath your fingertips as your encircling fingers glide down his smooth length, rubbing along the little cartilaginous nubs and spikes that bump through your fingers on the way down.
\>You can feel his strong pulse quickening with each stroke of your hands, his member grows, swelling beneath your fingers with his rising arousal.
\>The fiery King of the Skies whines like a pitiful puppy, squirming on his back with eyes screwed shut; his shaft jumps and flexes within your grip, wickedly-clawed toes clench and shake on either side of you.
\>You can feel his orgasm coming, his whole body convulses, and his cock swells suddenly, the pointed nubs lining its length harden and spread out like the serrated teeth of a knife.
\>The Rathalos’ exotic cockhead expands, the soft spikes rimming its head flare outward, digging into your fingers as you drag them across it, the stimulation drives him wild as he squirms in the dirt.
\>His whole body spasms with a strained roar from his jaws as the first jet of creamy wyvern seed explodes from his tip, arching through the air to land across the scales of his chest.
\>You stroke his flagging cock harder and faster; it twitches and spasms in your grip with each pulse of semen travelling its length to paint his chest white.
\>Your fingers coax more and more cum from him until the last of it weakly dribbles from his quivering tip and he’s left a shuddering and sticky in his afterglow.
\>His softening cock already begins to retreat into his slit, his chest heaves for air and his head and wings lay on the ground collapsed in total exhaustion, you sit down beside his head as his scratchy tongue drags an appreciating lick across your face before moving to clean the sticky globs of cum spread between your fingers.

===================================

\>“What is a Gog-damned Rathalos doing here?!” The Hunter screamed over the wind from the descending monster’s wings, squinting against the dust and rubble kicked up from the parking lot.
\>“What do you mean? He’s our best customer!” The store clerk shouted back, holding his cap against the wind.
\>The Rathalos dropped to the ground, the sudden crash of his weight sending a tremor through the parking lot. 
\>A small coin purse around his neck jingled musically as the wyvern settled himself. 
\>“Good morning, sir, I hope you’ve had an enjoyable flight.” The clerk approached the Rathalos cheerfully, a store-branded bag of food held in his hand.
\>The Rathalos huffed and looked to the much smaller man, his hot breath nearly sent the man’s uniform cap tumbling away.
\>The Hunter could only gape in shock as she watched the convenience store clerk confidently stand just a foot in front of the monster’s face, wearing nothing but a store uniform devoid of armor or weapons.
\>“Are your mate and hatchlings doing well?” The man asked conversationally, looking up to the hulking monster.
\>The Rathalos nodded its head showing white, wicked teeth in a toothy grin.
\>The Hunter knew what damage those teeth could do against even the toughest armor, yet she watched the monster serenely interact with the clerk like any other regular customer.
\>“That’s great! I added a handful of candy for them; don’t worry about the cost, it’s on me.”
\>She nearly fell over backwards when the Rathalos butted his snout into the man’s chest affectionately, nearly knocking the much smaller man over.
\>“It’s no big deal. Just a token of our appreciation for your continued shopping with us!” The clerk laughed while pulling away from the monster’s affectionate nuzzling.
\>“Now, I’m sure you’re in a rush so I have your order right here,” The man held the filled shopping bag up for the Rathalos to inspect. 
\>“A dozen Aptonoth meat buns, and four Butterbrews. For a total of 3,200 Zenny.”
\>The Rathalos leaned down until the coin purse hanging from his neck was within reach and the clerk pulled his payment out, returning a few smaller coins to the purse from his apron pocket for change.
\>Then, stepping around to the Rathalos’ nose, he looped the handles of the bag around the first few teeth at the end of the Rathalos’ lower jaw, letting the bag hang beneath. 
\>The monster closed his mouth around the bag and with another appreciative huff waited for the clerk to move far enough away before taking off.
\>“Don’t forget to check our weekly ad for coupons!” The clerk yelled after the monster as it winged up into the sky.
\>“What the hell is a Rathalos doing buying convenience store snacks?!” The Hunter asked as the clerk came to stand beside her.
\>“Why wouldn’t he? We’ve got the best Aptonoth buns on the continent, they’re made fresh daily!”

===================================

>Can I touch rathalos?

\>"Can I touch you?" I asked, my gloved hand hovering just inches away from the red wyvern's neck.
\>The heat from his body radiated through the thick leather covering my palm, it was a miracle I had even gotten this close to the King of the Skies without being mauled.
\>The Rathalos' striking blue eye slid down to study me intently, I held my breath under his gaze, did he somehow understand my question?
\>He let out a raspy snort and his eye shot to stare out into the bushes off to our right.
\>I followed his gaze, not seeing much in the green darkness beneath the shade of the thick tree canopy, until my eyes caught movement -- a nearly imperceptible shift in the shadows.
\>Two golden eyes regarded us from within the underbrush -- a Rathian, hidden perfectly within the trees and bushes by her camouflaged scales.
\>I hadn't even realized she was there, watching; a chill ran down my spine.
\>How did this look to her? 
\>A hunter with hand outstretched toward her mate's neck, I doubted I could take the two of them if she suddenly charged, enraged.
\>Instead she turned, slipping deeper into the shadows with barely a sound.
\>In relief, I released a pent breath I hadn't even known I was holding.
\>The Rathalos too let out a grumbling, smoky sigh.
\>I felt something solid press into my hand and turned from where the Rathian had been to see the huge wyvern had shifted his weight to press against my outstretched palm. 
\>I gave the plates of his solid neck a pat and moved around to the front of his head.
\>I'd come this far, maybe the Smart Biologist would be interested to know if Rathalos enjoyed having the underside of his jaw scratched.
Only if his wife Rathian gives her ok.

===================================

>If you want to engage Rathalos in any otherwise ultra-gay activities like kissing or claw-holding, you'll need to ensure that Rathian is nearby, paralyzed or caught in a vine trap and can see the entire ordeal. It should preferably be done after he's already mounted you several times in rathian's own nest. If there are any eggs present, make sure he also bends you over one of them since they're probably Kut-ku's anyway.

\>Eventually you'll want to fly off with the King of the Skies before Rathian frees herself
\>get far enough away and rather than following, she'll merely retire to her now damp and tattered nest 
\>accompanied for the night by the scent of your sweat and seed splattered over her last clutch
\>by the recently etched memory of Rathalos's heavy breathing, jaws locked with the hunter beneath him
\>by the sight of the tremors running through his wings, his shaft arching upwards and ridges flaring out harder than they have in years

\>the two of you are long gone by now, probably somewhere on a mountaintop in the distance, still mating each other passionately under the moonlight
\>maybe you'll get lucky and catch an Azurelos at a desperate time of year, drawn in by the echoing moans from your partner's maw
\>maybe you'll spend the night pressed between crimson and azure scales, feeling two heartbeats gradually slip in and out of sync around you
\>or maybe just lying underneath your mate while the blue mounts him, watching his whole body spasm during an orgasm brought on from feeling another male buried inside him
\>he'll be shooting blanks by now, probably more spent and exhausted than Rathian ever managed
\>though even after sleep takes him for the night, his shuddering wings and bulging slit hint that unconsciousness hasn't numbed the urges any
\>he'll be breathing in the scent of two virile males until morning, working himself up involuntarily for hours
\>probably even breeding both of you in his dreams by now
\>no doubt you'll be greeted tomorrow by a drooling shaft and a load already large enough to flood a member of his own species

\>spending the night between the two wyverns, letting their smokey breath wash over you, won't be something most hunters experience in a lifetime
\>that they would admit to, anyway
\>but it might become your new life, for a while, at least.

###*Rathian*

===================================

\>Be Hunter
\>You've been sent out on a Wyvern egg delivery mission
\>It seems way too late in the year to be finding Rathian eggs
\>The sun is low in the sky as you arrive at the nest, and your suspicions are confirmed
\>Three little baby Rathians, and a little Rathalos as well
\>You can see the relatively fresh shells scattered around; they must have hatched a few days ago
\>They sniff you curiously, and you reach out to gently pet them
\>They're kinda cute when they're small and (relatively) harmless
\>Your thought is interrupted when the Rathalos bites down onto one of your pouches and starts pulling you down
\>You try to pull away, but his sisters join in and successfully pull you down into the nest
\>They pile on top of you, softly nipping and licking you
\>As you try to pull yourself out of the pile of juvenile Wyverns, a loud cry announces the mother's return
\>She's a little banged up from defending her territory, but above all else she looks tired
\>She's initially angry to find you here, but when she sees that the little ones have successfully incapacitated you, she relaxes
\>Lumbering slowly towards you, she slowly encircles the pile of wyverns and lowers herself down next to them
\>She closes her eyes as she protectively drapes her wing over her children
\>The little wyverns continue to nuzzle, nip, and lick you for a few minutes, but soon sleep takes them
\>You try to escape from the Rathian cuddlepuddle, but your attempts only result in being pulled into the wings of another sibling and being snuggled twice as hard
\>Eventually you give in and allow yourself to sink into the pile
\>You'll sneak away in the morning when the Mother leaves
\>Hopefully they don't try to eat you for breakfast first

===================================

\>Been hanging out with a Rathian for a few weeks
\>Something rare happened between you two, an unexplainable, unbreakable bond
\>You can't explain why, and honestly don't care, being with her just feels you with joy, and the same goes for her
\>You're both pretty cuddly, but the size difference usually sparks frustration for both of you
\>You found out her most "huggable" zone wasn't her neck like you first thought, but her soft, scaled thighs.
\>For you, it feels like hugging a warm, thick yet squishy and soft platemail made out of smaller green scales
\>For her, it feels kinda nice, but the real reason she enjoys it is because your hands are closer to her nether regions, and like all Rathians, she's more often in heat than not
\>After your sixth thigh hug of the day, she rolls her eyes, tired of your teasing, and sends you flying with a quick leg jolt
\>She pins you down on the ground before you can recover with one of her talons
\>You know that look she's giving you all too well
\>You comply and take your meatbone out
\>With a pleased growl, she works her tongue to get it erect
\>When you're rigid enough for her tastes, she takes position on top of you
\>Another day, another round. But this was the third for today, and knowing her and her habits, it wouldn't be your last.

===================================

\>Be a Hunter
\>You aren't a very good one
\>Killing monsters makes you feel bad, so you mostly just take gathering quests and the odd capture quest to pay the bills
\>Today you're doing an egg delivery mission
\>You are lugging the second and last one back to camp when the mother comes calling
\>It's a fucking Pink Rathian
\>You try and run, but she deftly blocks your every attempt and nearly takes your head off with a tail swipe
\>In a fit of brilliance you decide to distract her with your slinger
\>You fire a rock into a bunch of boulders ensnared in vines, and they tumble down on top of her
\>And crush her to death
\>You feel horrible
\>She was just trying to keep you from stealing her babies, and you killed her
\>As you solemnly flip through your notes on the cart ride back, you take the time to actually read the quest description
\>You thought that these eggs were going to a researcher or something
\>Nope
\>It's a restaurant
\>Son of a bitch
\>After much deliberation, you decide that there's only one thing you can do
\>You send a message telling the quest giver that you failed
\>You won't be responsible for more death, thank you very much
\>Back at your room, you strategically pile up some old laundry and bedclothes in the corner to act as a makeshift nest and throw a towel over them to hide them
\>You have no idea how you're going to keep this a secret once they've hatched, but that's a problem for future you to solve

===================================

\>Be huntress in Rathalos armor
\>Hunt Anjanath in the Ancient Forest
\>A pink Rathian keeps following me
\>Doesn't attack or anything, just follows me and tries to get attention from me
\>Fly away, dumb bitch, I'm not here for you today
\>She ends up pinning me down on the ground
\>Rubs her hindquarters against my helmet
\>Rathian juices fucking flowing inside
\>Dumb bitch is in heat and probably mistook me for a small Rathalos
\>Want to get it over with and get rid of her
\>Resort to give her what she wants and shove my fist inside her
\>Pump in and out for a few minutes, until she roars and almost break my wrist with her insides
\>Rathian turns back, nuzzles me and fucks off
\>Fuck this quest, I need a hot relaxing bath

\>Back to Astera
\>Go to see blacksmith to ask practical questions about how to thoroughly clean an armor
\>Tells me he needs more details on what kind of stain has to be cleaned
\>Tell him my misadventure
\>Him and his helpers burst out laughing
\>Keep going for 5 minutes straight
\>He ends up telling me what "Rathalos Rubies" used for my armor actually are
\>Order a full High-Metal armor
\>Never touch Rathalos armor again

===================================

>[Sung to the tune of "A Boy Named Sue"]

Sit a little closer and let me regale
Of a right funny and hilarious tale
And a fact that I know for sure
That green wyvern over there
With a neck filled with poisonous hair
Is Astera's biggest whore

Well, I can see from your expression
That you're nothing but questions
So let me settle your doubt
That wyvern's a slut
I've been balls-deep in her butt
And never once tried to pull out

She's married to the King of the Skies
But quickly came to realize
That the poor boy's dick could never satisfy
Now males come from all around
To give that wyvern's pussy a pound
And let me tell you: cock is never in short supply

Hey now you look ready to pout
I'm sure this makes you want to shout
That everything you knew was a lie
And I'm sure you may wonder
How much I've torn those cheeks asunder
But, to be honest, I'd rather not mortify

And after a day of plying her trade
With her latest lovers helpful aid
She realizes that she's too gravid to fly
For any creature, whether royalty or dregs
Is more than welcome to fill her with eggs
And yet, her thirst will never go dry

So while her husband's away
With cocks she will play
Until discovery becomes a fear
But her husband's the same
His face flushed with shame
As a Lagiacrus tongues his rear

===================================

Rathian is the best monsterfu. If you disagree well then you must be a cuck and I’m sick and tired of you asshole elitists saying that Rathian is some kind of whore. I bet youve never even seen a whore in your whole life so its unfair to label an innocent monster like that in some dumb meme way that I bet you saw on reddit. Unlike many other waifus shes also very forgiving and tries not to judge anyone before she’s sure she understands the situation. You would know this if you have evrer stumbled upon a Rathian, unless you get too close, she generally never aggros,unlike Rathalos and nearly every other monster with short tempers. No she is content to walk around swaying her tail in a mesmerizing way. Yet another plus is her beauty, her scales are the color of fresh cut grass or beautiful jade and her golden eyes are like the treasured golden jewelry of a grand queen or duchess, perfectly complimenting her natural sage coloration. Her quills are beaitful and accentuate her features, sprouting out of her neck like a upperclass womans scarf and her chin spike is like a royal’s scepter dominating her features in a commanding way that leaves me captivated. Same for her wings and the unique patterns on their creamy underside every day I imagine those wings wrapping around me trapping me against her warm body that is much warmer than any other monste’s body due to the natural and unique processes by which she produces fire. I even bought a creamy blanket from the store that I like to wrap up in and cuddle a full body pillow like its a Rathian holding me close. Also Rathians maternal role is wonderful she is a caring mother and a doting wife, aware of her chosen husband’s every need and desire. I imagine her in my life helping me do my chores, cleaning my dishes and doing my laundry, drying my clothes with her fire so I smell like her.The way she does her tail flip attack is extremely sexy flashing her underside at you lets you know she has a wild side too

###*Safi'Jiiva*

===================================

\>“---Day 3 of the Expedition to study the Elder Dragon Safi’Jiiva---
\>I do believe the monster has become used to my presence, and is even, (dare I say it) a placid creature for something so large and with such a vicious look about it.
\>In an effort to gain a greater understanding of the beast’s reproduction, I had made an attempt to study its mating ‘equipment’ (for lack of a more proper term) when I was sure the monster had fallen into the deep slumber it was wont to do in the late afternoon. 
\>I had slipped around to its ventral end, (which was thankfully easily accessed due to the creature’s peculiar habit of sleeping on its back) and had carefully crept to the base of the tail, finding that my prize was still several heads above me on such a large creature.
\>Luckily the many spikes, keeled scales, and other protrusions that make up its topography offer excellent handholds, and so I had begun my ascent when I encountered an overwhelming odor.
\>The scent was both delicate and profound, a fragrant smell that overcame me in both body and spirit, and I found myself getting excited in a way that wasn’t concerned with the ecological aspects of this discovery.
\>Encouraged, I finished the climb in a frenzy and seated myself upon the skin of the creature.
\>Seated atop it, I could feel the great rush of the creature’s heartbeat through my own loins, the warmth of its body radiated off of it in waves (no doubt due to the great cistern of Bioenergy contained within its body), and I felt as if I was seated above a magma chamber, precariously above a great and terrible power constrained if only for the moment. 
\>I carefully scooted forward, toward a great crack in the dragon’s armor beneath its pelvic boot: a ventral slit nearly as tall as I was, rimmed with the creamy scales of its belly that shrunk from those bigger than my palm to ones smaller than my fingernails.
\>I wondered at the anatomical wonders contained within and leaned forward, placing my hands on either side of the fissure.
\>The scales were imperceptibly smooth and yielded beneath the pressure of my touch, the flesh beneath filled my palms and rose up to caress my fingertips like I had just grabbed a handful of the Hub Lass’ bosom. 
\>I could feel the warmth of the flesh, nearly burning hot, and I almost pulled my hand away when I realized my research had not gone unnoticed.
\>I could feel a gaze burning into me much hotter than the flesh beneath my fingers and shakily met two great golden eyes filled with an expression I cannot begin to describe or understand.
\>The creature made no move except to stare, and I cannot imagine what thoughts occurred to such a powerful being finding something as small and insignificant as myself groping its most personal place, however I can attest that I was not incinerated or eviscerated on the spot.
\>I beat a hasty retreat then to the safety of a wayward boulder.
\>My research will continue…”

===================================

>tell me /trash/ fleet whats the most degenerate thing you can think of that'll effect the ecosystem of the world new and old
>>breeding an army of Safis and letting them loose everywhere

\>come home to your humble full-grown Safi-sized abode from another day working with /trash/ fleet 
\>the second you step off the wingdrake harness and onto your front path, half a dozen tiny Palico-sized creatures appear from the woodwork to crowd around you
\>most are still molting from their Xeno'Jiiva days, looking somewhere between your Safi wife and the larger Xeno you fought long ago, but otherwise they seemed to all have taken after your wife...
\>a chorus of "Dad's home!", "Dad! Look!", "Dad! Daaaad!" surrounds you as your children vie for your attention
\>one of your older children plants themselves in your path, looking up at you and squealing excitedly "Dad! Guess what?! I'm the best at drawing energy!" 
\>all the others complain loudly that they are, in fact, much better at drawing energy while they all spread out on the front lawn and assume their bioenergy siphoning positions 
\>above the calls for your attention, you watch, dismayed, as the last patches of what used to be your pride and joy beautiful green lawn, wilt to brown, dead husks, energy drawn up by your children that have been told a hundred times to save their appetites for dinner
\>done killing your lawn, they all bound over to you, laying a dozen front paws on your legs to bicker with each other and ask if you saw how well they gathered energy
\>stooping down and gathering your bundles of bioenergy in a group hug, you decide that maybe, next time, you should build something that your kids can't suck the life out of for a midday snack
\>something like a rock garden... or maybe, you should let them loose on the Handler's personal sweet potato garden...

\>Impossible! No one, especially some lowley human can have the will to resist your infection!
\>Dark vapors swirl around you, you hold back and slash at her again and again.
\>The dragon has no choice but to attack, your attacks continuous.
\>All she can do is defend herself as you cut away at her scales; Until finally she staggers and falls.
\>The vapors around you dissipate at that moment, the infection overcome.
\>She's never met someone so strong of will, a feeling grows within her that's she hasn't felt before.
\>Her pride broken and replaced by love. She loves this human, someone that has finally beaten her at her own game.
\>She sees you as you take the opportunity to sharpen your blade, but can't hold back, she growls submissivly at you.
\>You're taken by surprise as you raise your head.
\>The Shagaru rises up and lowers her head.
\>She's signaling you've won- and that she is yours.
\>You walk towards her, sword withdrawn.
\>She's decided that you are her master, if you wish to kill her, she would accept it with all her heart.
\>Her newfound love for you is that strong.
\>She waits with her eyes closed for her end- and feels a hand slowly pet the head.
\>You've grown to respect her as well, an elder dragon that would be so trusting of a human it was fighting would be a big shame to kill or capture.
\>The Shagaru is ecstatic.
\>She licks your face as she growls in a low tone.
\>Her head lowers so her eyes meet yours, they're soft and longing.
\>You head back to camp with your new dragon friend, unbeknownst to you that this would be the start of a lifelong romance.

###*Teostra*

===================================

>\>implying you're not one of us [a weirdo/monsterfucker]

The difference between me and you is that my kinks and fantasies are tame and reasonable.
I mean, who wouldn’t want to spar with Teostra, not just to hone your combat skills but to determine who’s the bottom when you return to his nest. It makes sense that you’d win the first few times, proving your abilities not just in combat, but also in bed as you bring him to a fiery climax alongside yours. It’s understandable that you would be surprised, if not somewhat suspicious at how he hasn’t secured a single victory after almost a fortnight of sessions, nearly all of them hard-fought. Anyone would spend the next match purposefully slowing down and making mistake after mistake to the point where his victory was all but certain, yet grow bewildered at how his actions falter until he’s performing even worse than you. It’s perfectly natural to hug his thick tail and savor the intense warmth of his scales and hole, your thrusts lightly rocking Teostra as you pound his ass after the recent loss. It’s practically expected for you to finally understand that this is what the Emperor wants the most: to bend over and be bred like a Lunastra in heat.
Yup, tame and reasonable.

###*Tigrex*

===================================

\>Be Tigrex out hunting some Popo.
\>Spot one of those humans out fighting a Giadrome.
\>One of the ones with the long poking stick and the big blocking slab.
\>Absolutely pitiful. The Drome keeps running away and the little ones pick away at the human as they slowly waddle after it.
\>Must be a cub being taught to hunt.
\>Actually it's parents aren't around, maybe you could teach it.
\>Humans are small and weak, but still manage to be dangerous, raising one might give you an advantage down the line.

\>Finish your hunting (you don't want to leave a human, even a cub, alone with your kits yet), and return to grab them.
\>Still fighting the Drome, still waddling pathetically.
\>Grab them and haul them back to the nest.
\>It panics enough to drop it's stick and slab, guess you'll have to go back for it.
\>Tell your kits they aren't food and not to let them leave (without it's stick it shouldn't be a threat.)
\>Returning to your nest with the items in tow. Hear strange sounds from your kits.
\>Panic.instinct
\>Human is running it's paw over their snouts. They seem to enjoy it.
\>It gets to live this time.

\>Training the human actually goes pretty well. Only a few attempts to escape.
\>They have problems understanding you, but eventually the message gets across and they figure out how to charge their prey rather than cower meekly behind the slab.
\>They manage to exceed your expectations too.
\>They don't have claws to let them turn a charge, but figure out a way to do it by dragging the slab on the ground.
\>Never though you'd be proud of something this weak.

\>Eventually take them out to hunt a Drome on their own.
\>Takes them a while but they kill it.
\>Time for them to leave the nest.
\>Before they go they stroke your snout too, and wrap their forelegs around your neck.
\>Normally you'd be worried about such a vulnerable area but it feels nice.

\>See them a few more time on the mountain taking on harder and harder prey.
\>Pride wells up in you at how far they've come.
\>Come to think of it your own kits are getting about old enough to take mates.
\>Maybe you should find one and try to set them up.
\>You don't know how humans are able to overcome their crippling weaknesses, but whatever it is would probably be good for your lineage.

===================================

\>Starting out as a rookie hunter, doing well.
\>Next mission is to get three Popo tongues because strange village remedy.
\>Have to climb a huge Blizzard covered mountain to find the damn things
\>Hear a large ear-piercing roar as I try to starve back the cold, with not even a second later get smacked by some orange streak
\>...
\>Wake up in a dim cave, a few lights stream from the ceiling.
\>Look down and all my armor have been torn off- and a large orange arm is over my stomach
\>Oh fuck.
\>Can't even see my weapon anywhere
\>I'm resting against a goddamn Tigrex.
\>Feel movement, notice it's head looks up at me.
\>Too terrified to even react, I just close my eyes and wait for it to be over.
\>Feel slightly rough and wet thing scrape over my face.
\>I open in disbelief, it just licked me and went to sleep again.
\>I don't know what it wants, if it really wanted to kill me, it would have done so.
\>I guess I have no choice, have to remain here for now.
\>Someone will find me, right?

---
###*Tzitzi-Ya-Ku*

===================================

\>Bone huntress is sent out to capture a Tzitzi-Ya-Ku in coral highlands
\>Finds it sleeping on one of the squishy green pads in a coral cave. 
\>prepares a surprise attack, only to notice that it’s member is slightly erect in its sleep— the bird wyvern kicking its talons idly
\>Huntress bites her lip, finding her curiosity unable to bare
\>removes her glove, giving its slick, narrow shaft a firm grasp and dragging it slowly to the narrow tip
\>Tzitzi moans in his sleep, his meat swelling and erecting from its scaled sheath
\>huntress blushes, using her strength to push him onto his back, and spreading his powerful thighs.
\>He undoes her waist, chest, and panties whilst presses her leaking snatch on the base of his tail
\>Tzitzi wakes up, screeching at the huntress and expanding his flashing membrane until the huntress wraps her juicy lips around his tip— wrapping it in the wetness of her mouth.
\>Tzitzi halts, making a low clacking noise as he’s sucked off. Its eyes narrow and tail sway on the floor
\>huntress whimpers as the wagging hops her hips up and down on his thick tail, making her hold on tighter to slurp up his wet film.
\>The Bird bucks it’s hips into her cheeks, the huntress gladly diving down to his base— tickling her throat
\>Tzizi squawks, his humps becoming erratic and rapid, leaking cum— the huntress gulping with glee
\>he’s close, and he uses his strength to turn onto his feet. He leans down, backside raised as he starts to pump the huntress like a piston
\>she moans, clasping his hips as she prepares to guzzle his load
\>Tzitzi claws the green wiggling surface as he buries his dick down into her throat, and bucks with each glob of seed that gushes from his tip
\>huntress takes it all gladly, whimpering as the sticky fluid lines the walls of her throat and stimulate her tastebuds with a salty tang
\>Tzitzi pulls out, laying atop her as they both nuzzle into sleep together— the huntress straddling his soft hips with her plush thighs

---
###*Valstrax*

===================================

>As much as I like Valstrax, I'd say it makes a pretty bad tailrider - not only do those backward-facing spikes make it impossible to sit anywhere (even with a saddle), but the fact that it breaks the sound barrier while flying means you're either falling off midway or are gonna get liquified by those G-forces if you don't have some sort of pressure suit... 

I’d hope that your valstrax partner would be aware of your fragility in things like that.
\>your valstrax ~~mate~~ tailrider is the envy of every hunter and wulg/jagras/smaller tailrider who has to bare all of their equipment and weight
\>a specially-crafted leather sling straps you tight to their soft, smooth belly, keeping their claws free for movement on the ground, (though they always wrap you securely with their fingers when they fly) 
\>trees and brush are no match for their streamlined and hardened body, they easily make trails straight toward whatever they are tracking, saving time for more cuddling around the fire later
\>once the monster is found, they blast away, but circle high overhead like a worried parent, quick to rocket down, wreathed in dragon energy and wrath to stand over you if you cart, quickly taking your unconscious body away before the cats can retrieve you
\>your failed hunts end with you waking back at camp surrounded by a living wall of scales, claws, and teeth doting over you like you’re a little defenseless hatchling
\>no amount of reassurances will calm their whimpering or their nursing licks

===================================

I want to suddenly panic and tear open the freezer door, sifting through half-eaten packages of unrecognizable leftovers and breakfast burritos, looking for something that could be potentially called "dinner" after being scared off the couch, spilling Cheetos everywhere, while bingewatching six hours of someone making elaborate aquariums set to classical music on YouTube by a text message that reads "omw home from work! love you <3<3<3" knowing that my Valstrax gf will take approximately twelve seconds to cross the city, and hoping, while I toss two HungryMonster TV dinners in the microwave, that the airspace controller fumbles his clearance directions and buys me another half minute to at least change out of my imitation cheese dust-encrusted t-shirt.

---
###*Velkhana*

===================================

>What do you think [Velkhana's] tongue feels like?-

Like unimaginable pleasure as the soft bumps of her slick tongue tease over the head of your dick, gliding over your erection as she takes you to the base. The rough scales of her nose brush against your belly and palms where you cradle her head, and while her mouth is warm her breath is cold and exhilarating, like stepping into a walk-in freezer, leaving your chest numb with her every exhalation. Her sharp eyes never leave yours as she varies her technique, judging your reaction and teasing you with arduous, brutal strokes from base to glans that drives your dick into the roof of her mouth and makes your eyes and fingers clench as you stave off orgasm.
She’s completely dominated you, not only in the earlier fight that has led to this predicament, but also in the control of your body, teetering you on the edge of release with a deft tongue and cold breath that robs you of sensation, subjecting you to more of her ministrations that would otherwise have you spilling into her maw. And though your mind is clouded with the heady fog of pleasure as you fight to keep some tiny shred of the control that has been wrestled away from you, a tiny prickling of fear has you wondering whether you can feel the tips of her sharp teeth gliding along your dick with every bob of her head or if it’s just your mind playing tricks on you…
You’re losing yourself now, awareness barely coherent as you sit on your bare ass in the forest, numb fingers digging into the facial scales of a wanton mistress, desperately pining for release.
Armor and equipment are strewn all around you, you’re a slave to the very creature you were tasked to kill now playing over your most personal place like a starved lover. Though your body has been conditioned through years of hellish training to be a pinnacle of human endurance, strength, and resilience, under the duress of her devilish tongue, you’ve been reduced to a shuddering, whimpering mess in the dirt.
Your balls ache worse than you can ever remember, sending sickening fingers of nausea up to claw at your belly. You’re being toyed with far more skillfully and mercilessly by this monster than by any seasoned, aloof barmaid, seemingly inured to your womanizing by many a past Hunter’s unwanted attention.
Every stroke of the Elder Dragon’s pebbly tongue sliding along your tender flesh curls your toes and sends stars behind your eyelids. Your dick jumps within her mouth, driving it into the soft flesh of her palate and sending you into a convulsion, but before your body can react to the stimulation, cold breath erupts from her throat to numb you to all sensation.
You grit your teeth with a choking cry as your orgasm is denied once more, leaving you to achingly become aware of the silken, heated flesh of her maw and tongue, running, squeezing, and milking your length as the numbness recedes and your feeling returns.

===================================

\>You feel as if you're being judged by the Velkhana librarian with each book she pulls from your stack to stamp.
\>Her frown deepens until finally she pauses her work.
\>"May I offer something from my recommendations?"
\>You decline, but she continues anyway.
\>She pulls out book after book of increasingly sappy romance novels.
\>Her first recommendation is innocent enough, a novel depicting two dragons whose friendship grows to love, but after a series of works diving into human/dragon friendships, ends with something titled: "Thawing Her Heart: an erotic tale of the illicit romance between a strapping young businessman and the coy ice dragon he employs in his meat packing plant. Will the young dragoness resist her boss' increasingly salacious advances or will she find that there's more than pork that gets packed at this facility..." 
\>You stare over the back cover after reading the synopsis, but the Velkhana quickly looks away with a barely concealed blush.

===================================

>[One pint-sized Velk coming right to your door](https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1596/25/1596257035789.jpg). Shipping costs extra.

"10/10 shipping speed, exactly as haughty and judgmental as described. Would buy again!"
\>Laid up on the couch, watching TV
\>Your recently delivered, tiny Velkhana laid next to you, not too far away but not too close either
\>They refused to be placed in your lap and squirmed out of your grip with a displeased glare, but with every commercial break, the distance between the two of you has seemingly shrunk
\>You notice the Velkhana eyeing the sandwich you made for your lunch and tear off a corner, leaving the morsel on the cushion between you and the monster
\>The Velkhana looks at it with disdain, obviously not amused at being fed scraps, but some time between this episode and the last, the torn-off sandwich piece disappears
\>During a commercial break, you return to the couch with a soda and a shot glass
\>The Velkhana watches you open the soft drink with veiled disinterest, but its tiny nostrils twitch to catch the drink's wafting, sweet aroma
\>You portion out a bit of the drink in the shot glass and place it before the Velkhana who, at first, ignores your actions but gradually grows attracted to the sweet drink
\>It's not long before they're happily lapping at the liquid, but not before nearly freezing it solid when they first take it in their paws
\>And so begins a beautiful friendship, the Velkhana will happily freeze anything you place in it's paws: sodas, beer, melting ice cream, so long as you give it a healthy portion, and share some of the warmth of your lap, in return

===================================

>Velk as a top is pretty hot though, just freezing you to the ground so he can have his way with you. Maybe he feels kind that day and takes you to the hot springs to warm up before going for round 2.

\>The Velkhana's frozen cock tingles your insides with its cold touch, contrasted against the soothing heat of the hot spring the two of you occupy. 
\>Rutting you against the smooth, moss-covered stones, his frosty aura cools your flushed face above the water where he stands over you, caging you in on either side with powerful, toned forelegs.
\>His lower half is submerged, deeper in the spring, tail stirring the surface of the water with waves kicked-up from quickening thrusts as his smug visage fades to a grimace, eyes screwed shut with barely-contained pleasure, lips pulled back over sharp fangs where a cute, pink tongue lolls uncouthly out of his muzzle.
\>Quick pants of breath cloud before his face while his hips feverishly attempt to sink his icy cock as far as your body can take it, pushing into you with incredible strength.
\>Grasping for the scales of his chest as you feel your own orgasm brimming, you feel him sink farther, deeper, waves of pleasure rolling through your own erection as the soft spines and ribbings of his exotic member massage your insides.
\>You feel incredibly, unbelievably full; his claws grip the stones, an assertive rumble grows stronger within in his chest, powerful legs driving him fully within you until his hips kiss your own, stretching and filling you with cold, twitching cock.
\>A carnal roar scatters curious Macaque, his claws furrow stone as his whole body convulses, powerful hips rolling forward to press you against the mossy stones, cold floods your guts as the Velkhana releases, filling you with frozen seed that erupts from his tip in forceful surges, stretching deep into your belly.
\>You groan with your own orgasm, breathless moans swallowed by the Velkhana’s orgasmic roar that spills from between his jaws, vibrating your body through his stiffening cock; your balls empty to cloud the water while your hands find a grip among cool, wet scales, the only thing you can do as you bare the brunt of his release.
\>More and more comes, his orgasm continuing far past your own, pleasure-wracked roars growing hoarse vibrate your body, half stunted thrusts lift your rear off the spring’s pebbly bottom, pumping more of his draconic cum into your abused depths, filling and stretching places deep within you until you feel ready to burst. 
\>Finally, he reaches the end, his thrusts growing weaker, and his proud head falls on a drooping neck, panting with exhaustion. 
\>Muscles twitching with effort, he pulls his softening dick from within you, overflowing seed leaks from your hole to clump in the clear water as his cold member tugs at your insides leaving a void that feels empty, unnatural.
\>The cold pit within your belly warms through by the heat of the spring as the spent Velkhana moves from above you, his flagging cock retreating into his slit as he sluggishly lays beside you in the pool.
\>Laid in the water, too tired to move, your hand finds the tail tip searching for a home through the water, a half-lidded eye meets your own, the warm, blissful look carries an essay of words unspeakable, past the language barrier of two different species as the lull of sleep finds you, nestled against the Velkhana’s chest.

===================================

\>for a fleeting moment, the thought flashed through your mind:
\>“What does petting a Velkhana feel like?”
\>it was one of those strange, suddenly intrusive thoughts, and it wasn’t often that your Velkhana partner placed their head so close--no, it was often held pridefully high and out of reach
\>but they had arched their neck down over your shoulder to curiously stare at the woodcarving in your lap
\>it was a simple, rudimentary thing, but with a few hours of work, you figured it might look less like a Jagras’ droppings and more like a Jagras
\>and in that moment, with them distracted by the carving held in one hand, you laid the other across their nose
\>the scales of their snout were soft and fine beneath your fingers, cool to the touch, and the gentle curve of their muzzle filled your palm in a pleasant way
\>a surprised exhalation blew between the fingers laid over their nostrils, and you watched the Velkhana’s eyes go wide for a beat, like a Kelbi caught in a Tzizi’s flash, snapping to your face then back cross-eyed to your hand
\>it took a moment for something in their mind to click, before they suddenly pulled out of reach with a shudder, snapping their jaws at you in distaste with a dour glare like you had just insulted their mother before they stalked away without another glance
\>it wasn’t until hours later that that head once more snaked over your shoulder, nose held easily within reach, eyes staring a little too intently over the carving you hadn’t made much progress on
\>but you held yourself in check, worried that this was some kind of test, and after a long moment the scaly nose pulled away with a soft snort, eyes flashing golden with reflected firelight as they glanced over your face with something like a dismayed look, before the Velkhana stepped around to lay on the other side of the campfire, shuffling their wings with an exaggerated yawn
\>you snickered, drawing the monster’s glare
\>for such a seemingly cold monster they wore their heart on their sleeve

===================================

>Beware the normal ones Anon
>They're usually the most batshit crazy hidden a veil of normalcy 

\>you're sent on a expedition to investigate recent disappearances
\>while in lower hoarfrost nothing seems to be out of the ordinary 
\>as you enter the upper area of hoarfrost you notice that everything is eerily quiet 
\>against your better judgement you decide to keep going further
\>as you get closer to Velkhana's lair you start to hear faint music
\>you sneak towards the entrance and see what looks to be a formal dinner party with a large ice table in the center
\>you notice that around the table are various frozen monsters and hunters all in different poses
\>there is even a smaller table with frozen Wulgs and cortos around it
\>at the end of the table is the ice queen herself telling stories to the frozen guests
\>you sneak away from the terrifying sight and begin sprinting as soon as you think you're a safe distance

\>before you can escape, a blast of icy air washes over you
\>Velkhana swoops low, swirling snow all around you and alights elegantly in your path
\>"A pleasure of you to join us, Anon." She says, supercooled air falling from her body with icy vapors that curl and swirl along the ground
\>You take a step back, fear lancing through your veins
\>"Please, I insist...." She says with malicious elegance, icicles already forming on your armor as the ambient air suddenly drops far below freezing

\>Velkhana escorts you back to the party
\>one there she quickly pushes a frozen Legiana out of the and replaces the spot with a icy chair
\>she places the chair closest to her and continues her story where she left off telling how dreadful having Legiana neighbors is
\>all you can do is nod in agreement in fear of offending the gracious host
\>as you sit on your frozen throne in this bone chilling room you look around and see the device playing music looks exactly the same as the one you have in your room in Seliana
\>you get a closer looks at the monsters and hunters and get to see exactly when they were frozen
\>some were frozen in their sleep
\>the Legiana that was pushed to floor was frozen while perched
\>There is even a hunter that was frozen mid tackle
\>as you continually look around you think how you're going to get out of here without joining the other guests
\>Maybe if you play along she'll let you leave
\>as the party continues later in the day Velkhana brings out plates and glasses carefully placing them in front of each guest at the table
\>after that she places freezer burned raw meat onto your plate
and what looks to be Velks attempt at making champagne into your drinking glass
\>you look over at Velkhana only to see her looking back at you expectantly
\>she doesn't really expect to eat this, does she? 
\>you keep looking back at her and your meal
\>there no way out of this you can't eat the solid block of meat in front of you and you can't escape

\>not even your carving knife can carve through this chunk that's more ice than meat
\>your Velkhana hostess is watching you all the while, there's no way you can just slip your meal out of sight
\>"Hmmm, something wrong with the food? I spent hours on this roast, I can assure you it is quite delicious. Now eat it quickly before it thaws."
\>she nods to the frozen Legiana who's been displaced onto the floor
\>"I'm not fond of those who test my hospitality, surely you've better manners than that."

###*Wulg*

===================================

>\>wulg mating season
>\>big badger wolves jumping hunters like usual, but more biting and thrashing
>\>except this time it's moaning instead of yelling

\>Pack of roaming Wulgs start stalking the hunter.
\>First a surprise attack that has one running around his body to to confuse him.
\>In the cinfusion they always trip and fall to the gound
\>At this point , the rest start grabbing on to his limbs to keep him grounded.
\>The one tha was on you swiftly rips off your clothes, exposing you to the frigid cold.
\>Before you have time to shiver, immediately force themselves unto your mast to keep your groin warm and grind against you, teasing you with their tail brushing across your face.
\>Each one on the limbs takes their turn to milk you, pounding down unto you every time.
\>You get used to the warmth they give and in an effort to starve off the cold, you also start thrusting into them.
\>Eventually get so exhausted from both the movement and the constant orgasms your stamina runs out.
\>At this point, they drag your body through the snow into their cave, as one Wulg remains with your cock inside them to keep you warm.
\>Wake up with a freshly killed Popo and surrounded by Wulgs.
\>You won't be making it back home for a while.

---
###*Yian Garuga*

===================================

>Teaching your monsterfu the meaning of a kiss and how to do it would be some top tier wholesome stuff. Until they barge into your study and interrupt your reading of your hunter's notes with a slimy tongue across your face, conveniently forgetting your explanation of how the tender peck on the cheek of a greeting kiss is supposed to go.
 
\>You stare at the bird wyvern that called for you, her piercing screech easily recognizable even from a distance. What could she want?
\>Your partner closes the distance in a few steps, stopping in front of you. Seconds pass by in silence, neither party moving.
\>...Is it your imagination, or is she slowly leaning forward?
\>Even as the distance closes, you can't help but shy away from the large beak drawing near. The occasional spontaneous affectionate rubbing is always heartwarming, but that jagged mouth leaves you with fresh cuts more often than not.
\>You're torn between accepting the gesture or taking a step back. If you move away, she'll probably view it as a rebuff and get angry. You're not particularly in the mood today to injure yourself just to pacify an irate Garuga.
\>...Actually, you're never in the mood for her tantrums. You've chalked it up to her nature, but do mates normally fight each other this much? Hell, at ALL?
\>At least it's not entirely malicious. Even with tails swinging, wings flailing, and swords slashing, you're careful to only use the back of your blades and she never scratches you *too* hard most of the time - once you spot that wicked glint in her eyes, all bets are off. Thankfully she still refrains from inflicting any grievous injuries, or you're good at protecting your vitals. One of the two. She's not that crazy... you think.
\>You hope.
\>On the plus side, your more intense domestic disputes always lead to... raunchier deeds. Something about beating the stuffing out of each other really gets her going – eventually claws and swords start taking a backseat in favor of wings and hands, blows soften until they're reduced to caresses, and whomever's bleeding the least usually takes charge. By the end, copious amounts of cuddling has mellowed both parties and it's as though you never squabbled in the first place. With the noise you both make, it's a miracle that no one has stumbled upon you.
\>...
\>You can't believe you're considering purposefully antagonizing and inevitably attacking your partner just for one extra-passionate session. What kind of terrible foreplay would that be? Were you always this much of a degenerate?
\>Trapped between a rock and a hard place, your internal struggle only keeps you still while your partner inches forward until their beak takes up most of your vision. This level of deliberation and control isn't completely out of the ordinary, but uncommon enough to warrant speaking up, asking her if everything is alright.
\>The beak before you parts ever so slightly – for one irrational second you expect an honest-to-goodness reply, but instead it darts forward, pressing lightly against your cheek and giving you the faintest of licks before departing, your partner taking a few steps back to properly view you.
\>That... was definitely...
\>Soft, amber eyes seem to gauge your reaction as you reach up and touch your cheek, caught off guard by the tender display of affection. Due to her deadly beak, you've grown accustomed to mainly planting kisses on it since any nuzzling would be met with razor-sharp reciprocation. Over time she's come to recognize its significance, but to return the gesture? Let alone with such a degree of carefulness.
\>Warmth and fuzziness spreads through you like a hot drink, and you grin. You're twelve again, and just discovered your crush liked you back.
\>A short warble of concern breaks your trance, your partner growing curiously uneasy at your still form. Without hesitation, you wrap your arms as far as possible around her purple-stained beak, earning a choked squawk of surprise at the sudden gesture. She remains unexpectedly still as you hug her, and for a few seconds you think she's finally realized that it's the only way you can return the favor while her beak is against you.
\>Then she shifts, pressing into you. A sharp pain drills into your stomach, causing you to wince and take an involuntary step back, prematurely ending the moment.
\>...
\>Oh no.

===================================

\>Sunshine... That soothing warmth calls to you for yet another day of action, excitement, glory and-
\>Your train of thought immediately shatters as your vision focuses, a seemingly unimpressed Bird Wyvern staring down at you.
\>"I... overslept again, didn't I?" The pressure of the claw on your chest lifting with a mild grumble, eye contact unbroken. You rise to your feet with a daily routine very much needing to be caught up to unless you desired retribution.
\>After some minor preparations, you and your partner continue adventuring into parts unknown. Your saddle empty after getting bucked off once was more than enough to get the message.
\>Time burns away as the two of you walk under an almost endless canopy of green, the forest's silence only broken by your footfalls and the occasional gust of wind.
\>You always dreamed of being a Rider. Ever since word spread of the Makili Pietru's defeat at the hands of some kid and their Rathalos, everyone you knew as a child wanted to be like Hakum's greatest.
\>Without the convenience that "muh magical friendship rocks" provide, taming monsters, even from birth, was always going to be difficult. But you never thought it'd be THIS Gogdamn hard.
\>Even before your Yian Garuga sprung from the egg, you were mocked by your peers. Many saying that the monster would kill you in your sleep if it got the chance, followed by unoriginal jokes about poultry.
\>You questioned your choice many times as the hatchling matured, its instincts refusing to be supressed no matter how much you tried. You pleaded to others for advice, but nobody wanted to be around "that kid with the Garuga"
\>Why'd you pick that stupid bird!? All those eggs to choose from and you went with the one that NO ONE else wanted, maybe you would've been popular if you just smashed it right then and-
\>A gentle nudge in your side brings you back to reality, you have been standing still long enough for your companion to be concerned. You've stumbled upon an open area, a waterfall flows onto the river below.
\>You both take the opportunity to rehydrate, filling several canteens and removing the saddle while the Garuga skulls down beakful after beakful.
\>After getting unintentionally splashed one too many times for your liking you raise the issue. In response you receive a oddly playful look... one you haven't seen in a long time.
\>"Oh... oh fu-"
\>The midsection of a tail slams into you as you're sent flying into the water, with your partner following soon after. You resurface almost simultaneously and the purple bird lets out a throaty chortle.
\>This is the happiest you've seen them in months, years even.
\>You decide to throw some unnecessary gear onto the river bank, you're gonna indulge in this. As the hours begin to pass, you start wondering if this whole "exploring the world" thing was just an excuse to finally get closer to your monstie.
\>A metallic roar ruins the mood, all eyes shift to the source. You immediately begin scrambling for dry land.
\>A Glavenus is not amused by your trespass into it's territory and fully intends to kill you both. Hastily grabbing soaked clothes, you call for your buddy to follow.
\>The Brute Wyvern closes in and spits a fireball, narrowly missing while you grab your saddle. Now you've just gotta put it on the bird and-
\>A fireball explodes at your feet, causing you to hit your head pretty hard against the ground. You're struggling to maintain conscious as blood flows from a gash and your ears ring.
\>You watch on as your Garuga proceeds to tail-flip the Glavenus, the poison having a instant effect. Undeterred, it continues its assault against your partner, every slash a potential death sentence.
\>Growing tired of the elusive bird, the brute begins grinding it's tail in its mouth, glowing with heat. Blood loss takes its toll as you begin to pass out, the last thing you hear your partner's roar.
\>...
\>Moonlight... The pale illumination that beckons the diurnal to sleep. You slowly awake once again to the sight of your pal, resting its head against your lap.
\>You slowly arise and throw your arms over its head, you can't help but start tearing up as they softy scraw at your touch.
\>Taking in your surroundings, you see the once mighty Glavenus completely savaged, almost unrecognisable besides its notable features.
\>Running a hand through its bloodied fur, you remind yourself that you'd best not ever upset your best friend if you want to remain among the living.
\>Scarred and exhausted, you've both had a long day and deserve a rest. Your Yian Garuga starts to doze off, with you not too far behind.

###*Zinogre*

>\>ywn hold zinogre's paws in your hands and watch him struggle emotionally because he has feelings for you but is too afraid to share them

\>Hold his paws, see him struggle internally
\>Softly massage them to try to calm him down, only increasing his internal conflict
\>Compliment him on how soft they are, while rubbing one on your cheek
\>He looks like he's about to cry, but you're not sure if it would be tears of anxiety, or tears of joy
\>He keeps looking you in the eyes, despite the signs of him being nervous, his tail rapidly swinging in an erratic manner, jolts of electricity running along his body
\>Close your eyes and kiss him softly 
\>Instantly dissipate his internal conflict
\>Get a deep, savage french kiss in return when he unleashes his love for you
\>It feels like the dam broke, and a powerful torrent of repressed love and passion overwhelms him
\>Tears of happiness roll down his scaled cheeks as he slowly backs his head away and looks at you, still processing what just happened
\>You hold his paws once more and smile at him, telling him that it's okay, you feel the same as him
\>He suddently put his front limbs around you and hugs you
\>Surprised at first, you indulge in his with and pass your arms around his neck, giving back his hug
\>You both stay like this for a long time, none of you willing to let go
\>He finally frees you from his embrace, an gives you a generous lick, his tongue mightly tingling your face because of the electrical tension he has trouble channelling due to the emotion
\>You both sit down under a tree and spend the next hours gently snuggling against each other

\>clever boy

===================================

####*Rathalos/Rathian*

\>A young Rathalos flew over a new world, it's just barely reached adulthood and is looking for it's own territory to own.
\>A faint smell of a female catches his attention.
\>He flies towards it, can't really claim an area without a mate of course.
\>Landing next to a cave he's sure the scent emanates from; he takes a deep breath and growls out a mating call.
\>He hears steps coming towards the entrance.
\>To his suprise- A pink Rathian nearly twice his size comes out.
\>He takes a step back in preparation, obviously she's already mated and will not hesitate to kill some upstart Rathalos invading.
\>He lifts his wings to make a hasty retreat when she growled softly.
\>The Rathalos lowers his wings, albeit confused.
\>The Pink Rathian turns around walks a few steps within the cave; The Rathalos still wary of what she's doing.
\>The Rathian returns with a dead Aptonoth, dragging it by the neck.
\>It's almost the Rathalos' size, she lays it at her talons, nudging it forward.
\>The Rathalos did not notice it till now, but in his continous search for territory, he had neglected to eat for nearly a week, as his rumbling stomach showed.
\>The Rathian nudged the dead carcass once more and softly growled, obviously as an invitation to feast.
\>Any reservation the Rathalos had ceased, his hunger was too great.
\>He nearly ran towards the food and ate voraciously.
\>Finished, he looked up, the Pink Rathian towered him a look of content on her face.
\>His eyes widened, he fell right into a trap; betrayed by his hunger.
\>Her head lowered, the Rathalos knew it would be over soon and closed his eyes, one bite and he's be decapitated.
\>At least he would be quick.
\>The bite never came, all he felt was something wet on his snout.
\>As he opened his eyes, all he saw was the Rathian licking him softly.
\>He was stunned, was she really accepting to be his mate?
\>Pink Rathian along with Azure Rathalos are the oldest of the species, being matedat this point, along with accepting a Rathalos is unheard of, there can be no way-
\>His thoughts cut short by the Rathian, she growled back an acceptance, she has agreed to be his mate.
\>Astounded, the Rathalos stood still, until she nuzzled the side of his face.
\>He snapped back, but what to do now?
\>Thoughts swirled in the young Rathalo' head, such as males are suppose to provide for a mated pair yet she obviously has more experience in hunting and protecting the area around as he's never been in a proper fight, how can someone of such low experience provide anything to a relationship like this?
\>The Rathian turned around and took a few step towards the cave and stopped.
\>She leaned forward and raised her tail before looking back towards him, a low seductive growl slightly echoing through the chamber, just before continuing forward into the cave.
\>The Rathalos now knew full well what his role in this almost reversed relationship would be with his new mate, he could definitely make it work.

===================================

####*Legiana/Pink Rathian*

\>Sign up for Snow and Cherry Blossoms quest because you need ranks
\>Follow the scoutflies to the first monster's location
\>Hear some strange grunting and growling sounds as you get close
\>Round the corner to see Legiana and Pink Rathian aggressively making out
\>Rathian is on top, holding Legiana down with her bigger, stronger body
\>Both monsters are really going at it
\>Their jaws are locked together as they messily kiss
\>Their cloacas are also rubbing together, smearing their feminine juices against each other
\>Holy shit, this is weirdly hot
\>Quickly check that no one is watching before you drop your pants and start jacking off
\>Eventually both of them start sounding like they're getting close
\>Their grinding starts increasing in speed, the Legiana letting off a shuddering cry in bliss
\>You increase your pace also, feeling like you're going to blow a gasket from the building pressure
\>Both monsters climax simultaneously, their dual roars echoing through the highlands
\>You yell out too, louder than you meant to, as you cum against the rocks you were hiding behind
\>You catch your breath for a moment before quietly sneaking another peek out
\>Both monsters are looking right at you
\>Shit, they must have heard you
\>Surprisingly they don't look that angry
\>In fact, they almost look happy to see you
\>That's when you finally notice that the wind is blowing your scent towards them
\>They must have realized you were male
\>...Well, you suppose you didn't need the ranks right away...

===================================

####*Rathalos/Rathian*

\>Your Rathalos son has somehow gotten into your sock drawer and now has your favorite pair of Banbaro fur socks in his mouth. 
\>You chase him down throughout your house, but he’s too fast to catch, often flying up high above your reach and taunting you.
\>You give up the chase, knowing he’ll get bored of them and leave them somewhere for his favorite stuffed Aptonoth
\>He flies into your room and under your bed where he greets his sister with a chirp, she’s curled up in a nest the two of them have constructed from your borrowed shirts, bath towels, and anything else soft that catches their eye.
\>Rathalos presents his latest ‘kill’ which earns a coo of appreciation from his sister as she adds it to the nest.
\>The two of them curl up for their afternoon nap.
\>Later, you’re laid on the couch catching up on your hunter’s notes when a sudden weight on your chest nearly knocks the breath out of you.
\>You lower your notebook to see your son mantle his wing and roars a challenge with all the fury his tiny lungs can deliver, though it comes out like a muffled chirp around the tiny stuffed Aptonoth in his mouth.
\>His sister gives her own hatchling roar from the floor.
\>It must be time for dinner.

####*Miscellaneous*

**`{Impregnation}`**

\>Be female hunter
\>An all-female village has put out a request for an equally female hunter to solve their elder dragon related troubles, and you happen to fit the bill
\>The village elder invites you to her home for tea as soon as you arrive
\>The tea tastes funny and it's making you light-headed
\>You black out shortly after
\>You wake up in a dark cellar naked, tied down, and with a gag in your mouth
\>You're surrounded by both the women of the village as well as a collection of monster/human crossbreeds
\>As the elder apologizes for any discomfort the ovulation-inducing drugs she's given you may cause, you can't help but notice a woman and a half-zinogre jerking off a Great Jaggi into a bowl as she speaks
\>The elder fills a dildo-tipped syringe from the bowl before she pushes it into your vagina and presses the plunger
\>You squirm uncomfortably at the sensation of Wyvern cum flooding your womb as she explains what's going on
\>She wants to make peace with the local elder dragon terrorising her village
\>She plans to do this by giving it a woman to carry it's child
\>That woman is you
\>(Even more) unfortunately for you, your body isn't strong enough to bear such a powerful child
\>The strain of containing an elder dragon's fetus would kill you
\>Which is why they're going to strengthen your womb by training it with the offspring of stronger and stronger monsters until you're ready to be bred by an elder dragon

\########################################

**`{Transformation}`**
>Why not just climb inside [the monster] to get your egg as fresh as possible?

\>Be Hunter
\>It's dark, and your body is stiff from being forced to stay in the fetal position for so long
\>You wake up to discover not the ambient sounds of nature and angry screeching wyverns that you expected, but voices
\>You've finally been rescued
\>You didn't think they'd know to look for you in here
\>You weakly struggle against your prison to get their attention
\>They respond by sharply striking the side of your egg, cracking it open and sending you tumbling to the ground, splashing loudly in the albumen that spilled out along with you
\>"Good morning, sleepyhead. Surprisingly enough, you're not the first pervert to try and crawl into a monster and end up inside an egg."
\>You cough up the various fluids filling your lungs as you reach down to the cord connecting you to whatever the oviparous equivalent of a placenta is, only to freeze when you see your hand
\>It's covered in green scales, and your fingers are tipped in claws
\>The scales continue partially up your arm, and your lower legs and feet are scaly as well
\>Your lower back is also covered in the reptilian skin, surrounding a newly-sprouted tail
\>As you feel the new scales along the side of your neck and lower jaw, the researcher who freed you speaks again
\>"If you had stayed in there for the full gestation period as intended, you would be a full crossbreed by now. It's irreversible, I'm afraid."
\>Well this is going to be fun to explain to the folks back home
\>The researcher sidles up and nudges you
\>"If you'd rather not be stuck in this half-step form, you could always go back in and finish your metamorphosis...in fact, I'm curious to know what would happen if a crossbreed was rebirthed. Would they become a full-blooded monster? I'd pay handsomely for your help in the study! ...for whatever worth money has to a monster..."
\>...you get the impression that his interest is a little more perverse than professional

\########################################

>\>His [Smart Biologist] comment when you cap an Odogaron
>He probably fugs the monsters for "research" 

\>capture Legiana
\>go to see the researcher
\>everytime you approach him, he nervously holds his clipboard tight against his chest and tells you random meaningless stuff
\>Notice he's slowly beginning to spill researcher beans over time, making remarks about how cute, or beautiful your capped monsters are
\>One day you manage to make him believe you captured a Kushala Daora right next to Astera's forest gate
\>He bolts away to see it, leaving his clipboard
\>Check it
\>Hundreds of reports on monsters anatomy
\>Half of them is a detailed description of their sexual organs
\>There's entire pages of reports about monsters G-Spots, their sensitivity to different kind of stimulation, and incredibly detailed and photorealistic drawings of their genitalia
\>There's a "Time Attack" column for each monster with a few dozen entries everytime
\>You can't repress a smirk when you see Rathalos lasts about 20 seconds when subjected to "Rear stimulation"

\########################################

\>Be Hunter
\>You were sent after a Qurupeco
\>It seemed like a simple enough task at the time
\>Now that a Great Jaggi is pulling its cock out of your ass as a Rathalos tries vainly to push its own in, you feel that perhaps that wasn't the case
\>You're surrounded on all sides by many monsters
\>All male, all with throbbing, needy dicks, waiting for their turn to be serviced
\>All the while the Qurupeco is standing on a cliff above, blowing that stupid fucking horn nose over and over again, summoning more monsters to come and fuck you
\>As a Royal Ludroth desperately grinds its penis against your face to try and find a warm orifice to plunge into, a booming cry bellows out
\>A deviljho stares hungrily at the fuckpile in front of it, drooling profusely from both its mouth and the tip of it's massive (as in larger than your entire body) erection
\>You fucking hate the Qurupeco

\########################################


\>Be degenerate Monster Fucker
\>Have devoted and loyal monster waifu
\>Another monster sees your loving relationship and decides that she wants you for herself
\>Challenges your waifu to become your mate
\>Waifu gets her ass kicked and almost dies; the challenger is unequivocally the victor
\>You're pissed
\>You grab your weapon and drive the challenger off, then begin the process of nursing your waifu back to health
\>The challenger is befuddled as to why you would choose the inferior mate
\>She starts trying other tactics to woo you, like bringing you fresh kills as gifts
\>Meanwhile, your mate is also confused
\>She lost
\>The monster that beat her is stronger; she can give you stronger children
\>Why are you staying with a weakling like her?
\>She starts to become more emotionally distant and broody as you continue to tend to her wounds


\########################################

>\>come to the New World expecting adventure and discovery and dangerous new monsters to hunt
>\>arrive only to see a tranqed Legiana being pleasured with a huge mechanical dildo machine while the Smart Biologist takes notes
>\>there's also a fainted hunter being carted into town that's missing his waist armor and is dosed head to toe in monster fluid
>\>tfw that grand adventure you signed up for was in fact an expedition taken over entirely by degenerates

\>the Smart Biologist looks up from his notes to see you step off the ship looking around bewildered
\>next thing you know, he's run over excitedly with a pile of junk in his hands
\>"Ahh, reinforcements! Impeccable timing! The flock of Legiana in the Coral Highlands have all gone into heat simultaneously and my upgrades to the Dragonthruster haven't been tested fully!" He nods to the blissful Legiana being mechanically fucked
\>"There's about six or seven of them, nothing to be worried about if you take these!" He shoves a handful of Earplugs and Resistor jewels into your hands, alongside a Potion bottle that contains a thick, clear liquid and a Mega Dash Juice.
\>"Make sure to watch your stamina, I've been told they have quite the longevity! The last hunter to sate them reported that it's better if you 'go with the flow' and afterwards they all piled around him in an exhausted heap to nap. Doesn't that sound lovely? To be surrounded by such wonderful creatures, but alas! I'm stuck here doing research..."
\>"Don't forget to get fluid samples--from both sexes!" he calls after you as you're herded to the Wingdrake stables by a pair of Palicos

\>dig into the pile of books at the Research Center to study up for the "hunt" you've been assigned
\>most - if not all - of the pages seem to be sticking together
\>with a frustrated sigh, you shove the book back in and head to the canteen to eat up
\>your meal gets passed to you, but before you can take a bite, you notice a small dish next to your drink with a tiny pill resting in it
\>look at the Meowscular Chef questioningly, who gives you a wink and says it's for "vitality"
\>realize immediately that it's a libido enhancer and sweep it off your tray in disgust
\>try focus on eating while ignoring the loud conversation behind you as a hunter boasts about his recent escapades with the local Jagras population
\>finish your preparations and go to find the wingdrake you've been assigned to
\>it's harness is...interesting to say the least, covered in lacy frills and seemingly designed to draw attention to the spot under it's tail, which you woefully realize you'll have a perfect angle to stare at for the whole flight

>What kind of situation could possibly lead to you being tied to your monster gf? Drunk with the boys, who are "in" on your little secret and decide to play a prank on you once you drink yourself under the table?

\>Be fucking monster gf
\>Getting really rough, moving around and swapping positions a lot
\>During one switch she accidentally bumps into a tree knocking it over
\>Vines growing on the tree fall on top of you
\>She panics and begins thrashing
\>As she does she (and you get more and more tangles in the vines
\>Eventually she manages break some of the vines freeing her limbs, but the ones wrapped around her torso stay
\>You're completely entangled in them, held tight against her groin
\>You can't get an arm free to untangle yourself, and she's not dexterous enough to free you either
\>She wanders around trying to find some way to remove them
\>Each step she takes grinds your dick into her pussy
\>All you can do is enjoy the ride and hope you get loose before she stumbles onto a group of hunters.

\########################################

>How would a Hunter react if their monster fling from last night actually came to their village looking for them?

\>When the hunter said he'd take care of things, you were expecting more monster wrangling and less... whatever is going on over there. At the very least they've managed to corner the invader into a less populated area, minimizing the chance of others getting caught in the eventual scuffle.
\>You also expected more clothes to be involved, but credit where it's due: not many would jump into action wearing nothing more than their skivvies.
\>"What are you DOING?!" The hunter hisses at the invading monster.
\>A small group of onlookers are starting to gather, maintaining – in their minds – a safe distance as poorly strained whispers float from the spectacle. 
\>"You're supposed to be dead! They think you're dead! They THOUGHT you were dead!" The hunter gestures wildly, the monster paying rapt attention to their every move. "Monsters have no reason to approach settlements, let alone enter them! Do you have ANY IDEA what would happen if the guild caught wind of this?!"
\>It sounds as though they're familiar with that creature. With the number of able-bodied hunters increasing by the month, what could possibly motivate a monster to willingly place itself at the epicenter of danger?
\>A sharp "ow" escapes from the hunter when a massive head nearly knocks them over, shoving its way into his torso and... rubbing against them?
\>The hunter growls, pushing the invader away to no effect. "No, stop it! You need to leave! Shoo!"
\>The monster ignores the scathing protests, effortlessly dodging each attempt to dislodge it as the hunter grows increasingly exasperated by the second.
\>"Go! Leave! Why??? Why are you here?! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?! AUUUUUUUUUUUGH!!!" The hunter throws their hands up before flopping across the great scaled head with a muffled whimper.
\>Murmurs break out amongst some of the spectators standing by. You aren't the only person thoroughly befuddled by what's going on.
\>After a few seconds, an odd rumbling emits from the monster, having seemingly recognized their acquaintance's defeat. Upon closer inspection, you spot a hand rubbing against the beast's head, a heavy sigh escaping the hunter as he appears to fight back a smile.
\>"It's nice to see you too."
\>Now you've seen it all. You're familiar with the handful of monsters that go about their business and only ask to be left alone, but a hunter befriending one? Aren't they supposed to, well, HUNT? This sort of behavior is what you would expect from a researcher.
\>"Now, why are you here? Did something happen?" The placated hunter attempts to free himself but each retreating step is met with the monster's own minuscule shuffling, a few people even chuckling at their strangely-affectionate antics.
\>The hunter's concern is short-lived, replaced by a weak laugh as every unsuccessful step jostles the monster's head against them. "Can you stop? Geez, you're like a clingy spouse."
\>Another chorus of amusement, the atmosphere losing its tinge of panic. Light-hearted words are exchanged between a few bystanders, with another handful breaking away from the congregation to resume business, having deemed the unusual event unworthy of their time. Utterly baffling, but you only spare them a glance.
\>The hunter continues to soak up their acquaintance's attention, ministrations slowing as their gaze clouds. Their soft smile slowly fades, brow furrowing for reasons that elude you while pursed lips part and a single word is uttered. What did they say?
\>Their expression falls. "No..."
\>Something's wrong.
\>"No. Nononononono." There's an increasing weight of distress in each exclamation, the shift not going unnoticed by onlookers. "Noooo, we are NOT... NO." The hunter shifts their companion's head without trouble until they're face-to-face. "Last night was a hookup. A hook. Up."
\>...
\>You must be mishearing things.
\>A few onlookers cough, the forced act doing nothing except make the ensuing silence all the more deafening. No, your head is in the gutter. Of course they meant something diff–
\>"Just because we fucked DOES NOT MEAN we're a couple."
\>Ah.
\>"Ever heard of a one-night stand???" The monster remains curiously immobile, hanging on to every word that fumbles from the flustered hunter. "Does casual sex not exist between monsters? Or was – stop it!" The hunter is nearly bowled over by another bout of affectionate rubbing, the monster uncaring of their partner's woes. A frustrated laugh slips out of the hunter, betraying their true feelings.
\>Parts of you want to continue enjoying the duo's innocent shenanigans. Who would've ever thought a monster could grow close to a human?
\>The other parts dutifully remind you that the hunter did other not-so-innocent things with that monster.
\>How? How would it work? The size disparity definitely comes into play. Would they even feel anything?
\>...Why are you contemplating the intricacies of human-on-monster sex. Do you REALLY want to know?
\>No, you do not.
\>The hunter sighs, letting the monster's scaled head support most of their weight as they mumble to themself. "I just wanted to get laid..."
\>With a grunt, they ease off of their partner, who seems to recognize the intention. "Okay, how about we find someplace a little more private before we discuss our 'relationship.'" The hunter gestures with air quotes, chuckling quietly before looking around. "Need to do something before people start wondering what the hell... I'm..."
\>Their voice trails off. You briefly lock eyes with them as they scan the mute audience, their expression impossible to read.
\>...
\>The monster growls softly, prodding their unresponsive lover in what could possibly be concern. The hunter's lips part, yet nothing comes out.
\>Time has lost all meaning.
\>"...How long... have you all been standing there?"
\>No awkward shuffling, no convenient coughing. The ensuing stillness is practically suffocating.
\>Just another day in the New World.

I hope a job at a monstie daycare has good health benefits

>[Regarding claws/talons]

It's not a sex thing, I just like the way they look. And sometimes when a monster girl is drawn with her claws up, sure maybe I'll glance at them while fapping, but no more than any other part of her body, like wings and tails, and I don't have a wing or tail fetish. I just appreciate them aesthetically.
Sure, if I'm giving a full-body massage to a tobi-kadachi girl I'll spend more than half the time massaging her feet but that's only because she's standing on them all day. And if I have a boner the whole time, well, maybe that's only because of the sounds she's making.
I mean, once in a while I'll fuck an elder dragon girl while holding her feet up and maybe run my tongue between her toes and up her soles, and nibble them a bit while I cum, but that's no different from feeling her lips on mine while we kiss, or feel her neck while I playfully bite it.
Or I'll get a clawjob from a legiana girl and coat sharp, deadly talons in cum, but that's just because they're so dexterous and nimble.

>Small monsters deserve love too. Not just to be there for the low rank hunters getting filtered by tougher monsters, but sometimes you just want to hang out with a girl monster that's more down to earth than the high and mighty apex wyverns and elders.

\>The bigger the monster, the more complex their standards are in terms of hunters
\>Jagras will love you as long as you can provide food
\>Tzi-Tzi will love to take photos of you and will spend hours teaching you how to to take good photos of the surrounding wildlife
\>Kulu will have sparkles in its eyes if you can get your hands on any sort of big, shiny rock
\>Tobi-Kadaxhi just enjoys spending time with you, likes "fish and chill"
\>Black Diablos will secure you as her mate if your pelvis, heart, and stamina can last long enough
\>Valstrax will ignore you if you're not a pilot, can't handle 20-G turns, or can't discuss aerodynamics for hours on end
\>Shara Ishvalda won't judge you worthy of attention if you can't name and place every single chakra point, how to purify them using specific gems, spiritual characteristics of said gems and how to recharge them
\>Kulve won't notice your existence if you're not Fortune 50 worldwide
Only exception to this rule is Rathian. If you're male, she'll fuck you. Fuck Rathians, they're whores.

>I’m playing through Yakuza 0 right now and looking at this thread after a session makes me wonder what running a monster cabaret club would be like.

\>new big patch where your hunter becomes the new owner of a rather strange cabaret club, where the hostesses are all monsters
\>the previous owner is convinced that his idea could work
\>but when his business started getting beaten out by the more "conventional" clubs (with human/wyverian girls), he turned to you to manage the business because he thought a hunter of all people would know how to make a monster woman be her very best
\>your starting girl is a Pukei who, while adorable, is a stuttery, almost literally tongue-tied mess who can't keep a conversation going to save her life
\>but with a new outfit, some accessories, and a bit of special training, she quickly grows to be one of your best girls overall
\>hire plenty of other monsters to fill the gaps, either through regular means or as a reward for various side stories or progressing through the game
\>like the Velkhana Librarian and the Legiana Masseuse, who both become available after completing a side story where you resolve a rather humorous dispute between their businesses
\>or the bubbly, energetic Jaggia girl in a cute maid outfit, unlocked after defeating a rival cabaret in battle, and who, despite her small size, is an absolute pro at her job
\>"Sunshine Fever" gets replaced with "Rampage/Monster Frenzy", and Proof of a Hero blares instead of the usual disco music when activated
\>"pacifying" monsters with expensive purchases of food, drink, and extended sessions is heavily encouraged for all clients
\>trouble with the clients is extremely rare since many of them are well aware that the girls can easily take care of themselves, being monsters and all
\>final battle of the minigame story is where the Commader tries to have you shut down, and you have to convince him that your business is worth keeping around with the very best service that you can provide
\>winning provides some backstory between him and his old fling Kulve, who you also unlock as a hostess for your final reward

>Okay, we need to get this set in stone: What IS the primary purpose of the /trash/ fleet?

It was meant to be a small team of volunteer researchers and hunters who would not be afraid to investigate the monsters of the New World up close and study everything about them, even their mating and courtship habits.
The turn-out of volunteers was more than "small", but the Research Commission was willing to take all the help they could get, and welcomed the group aboard.
It was a completely open invitation that anybody could answer to, no credentials of any kind needed, so it's not hard to see why a large portion of the crew turned out to be monster hugging degenerates who saw a chance to get paid to do what they love.
After the team arrived in the New World, the amount of monster attacks on Astera decreased heavily, so the Commission turned a blind eye to some of the stranger things the members of this fleet got up to.

>Why settle for some eggs when you can keep the source for easy zenny? If it lays it pays. 
>>What like a Monster farm? 

\>After yet another hard day of fulfilling requests for the village, the weary hunter retreats to the comfort of his small home
\>Crashing onto a Dodogama themed bean bag, he procures a small device and points it at a strange contraption
\>The room erupts with light and sound
\>"EGGS? EGGS!? YOU WANT 'EM, WE GOT 'EM!"
\>The man wearing Great Wroggi armor slaps the plump thigh of a Kulu-Ya-Ku (that is also wearing Wroggi attire) he's standing next to, startling it
\>"COME ON DOWN TO KULU RANCH, HOME OF THE FINEST PURVEYORS OF YOLK FILLED OBJECTS THIS SIDE OF THE NEW WORLD!"
\>"LITTLE EGGS, BIG EGGS, MYSTERY EGGS*, EGGS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, EGGS!"
\>*Warning: Mystery eggs may or may not be fertilized 
\>"GET A TROLLEY, GET SOME EGGS, GET YOUR PICTURE TAKEN WITH OUR RESIDENT KULU!"
\>The Bird Wyvern stops itself from falling asleep and strikes a pose
\>"KULU RANCH, IT'S NOT JUST GOOD, IT'S BLOODY EGGSELLENT!"
\>He mimics the Kulu's pose and the shot lingers for an awkward amount of time, palicos out of frame can be heard laughing as both man and monster grow increasingly annoyed
\>The advertisement is over and it cuts to local news, reports of a large amount of female monsters disappearing from their locales being the headlining story
\>...
\>That's enough 'wyvernvision' for one night

>What purpose [monsters capturing hunters] do you think, anon?
>>Research? They want to learn about us just as much as we do them, right? Right? 

\>get unceremoniously dumped into the nest of the wyvern that had only minutes ago snatched you up from your material gathering and carried you off
\>the ground shakes as they land heavily next to you, their monstrous demeanor looming over you as though sizing you up as their next snack...or worse
\>you can only hope that they're gentle about it, closing your eyes and shielding your vital bits as you feel something warm and wet splash against you...
\>nothing happens
\>you chance a quick peek, only to discover that what dripped on you appears to be a black splotch of ink
\>look up only to be greeted by the sight of your captor holding a crude-looking "notebook" made of dried Aptonoth hide and a large Kulu feather quill, still dripping ink
\>the wyvern, sitting on its rump and holding these objects in an almost humorous manner with its talons, stares at you impassively, clearly waiting for you to do something
\>you gingerly move to wipe the ink off of you, your movements immediately answered with a flurry of frantic scribbling as the wyvern "records" this "discovery" of your behavior
\>oh, this wouldn't do at ALL
\>you quickly stand up, ready to voice your discontent, and the wyvern suddenly gasps and quickly dives into a nearby pile of dried leaves - its attempt at a "ghillie mantle", you can only imagine, as its glowing eyes stare at you from within it
\>you decide to get the hell out of there before it got spooked enough to throw whatever its idea of a "dung bomb" was at you
