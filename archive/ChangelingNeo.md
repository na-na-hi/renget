##About Neo
Stands 5ft 6in tall and narrowly built, hair is kept long enough to reach half way down the back. Looks entirely normal for a human but the differences become apparent upon close interaction. Neo's body despite looking well toned would feel abnormally soft and springy. Someone hugging them with significant strength wouldn't feel the normal resistance a body would give and instead be met with something closer to a dense stress ball. Despite being a futanari they present themselves as male and always have their face morphed towards the boyish side, keeping their vagina hidden away through their racial abilities. How? Being about a quarter Slime they have limited body morphing capabilities. They have no way of expelling or gaining excess biomass for drastic alterations easily, having to either consume large quantities of food or working off said gains through exercise, which both have been rendered impossible due to [Fixed Physique]. At best they can become a little taller or shorter, change their frame and facial structure, alter their sexual characteristics, and are far more flexible and elastic than a normal human. Again they can't do anything wild and are limited to humanoid shapes with minimal monstrous features.

Neo started as just a plain [Humie] in concept but I figured explaining to someone the ability to survive a titans dick like a tenga egg, being penetrated all the way through by an entire tentacle beast, or stretching out the orifice Neo is currently balls deep in out far enough to make Siswet look like an amateur as being part slime instead of "Arc made me a walking hentai physics engine lol" is a lot less bizarre sounding.

Thus do we have the [Changeling] you see here. I figure being part slime affects things enough to where combined with [Contortionist] even Neo's bones have some flexibility to them naturally without applying any morphing to them, and as before just a rather convenient explanation for the odd physiology.

Could have picked Xadera but being a priority target on the arbiters blacklist isn't exactly appealing.
Could have been a Tanuki but I didn't like the thought of things being undone with a jumpscare or entrapment.
That isn't to say a jumpscare could break the mild concentration required to keep up the morphing, but it's really being trapped negating a tanuki's abilities that's keeping me away. 

> I see [Reincarnation] and co. but no [Deadman Wonderland]?
It's not that I couldn't afford it as there are many more banes I am okay with having (I also have about 20 points left to spend as is), it's more of I don't want to swim in the same waters as beings who's average proficiency score is 6 or higher. Plus the way I figure with Uzza's afterlife is that whatever mission I get sent on post mortem is like a last hurrah with the abilities I've cultivated over that lifetime.

> Why those proficiency scores?
What good is a hero's journey if you're already heroic? Neo is a gifted combatant and has a strong grasp of the essence of magic from the get-go every time they reincarnate but that's about it aside from supernatural luck. It's a compromise between being able to pick a new career path every life by being a blank slate and skipping some of the grinding on the widest reaching abilities.

> Personality?
Lighthearted, a little dumb and reckless at times.

> Are you a hero?
Not exactly, but Neo tends toward morality than amorality. Plus I'm kind of abandoning the thought of Earth which means Mastema and Onoskelis are out.

> Neo's Goals?
Their longest reaching goal is creating some sort of "Fortress of Solitude" where they can store memories and skills they've acquired into a simulacrum of sorts that can teach future Neos as sort of a shortcut, or at least store knowledge of how they cultivated an ability so that even if it has to be relearned the long way any prior guesswork is removed.

Shorter term would be practicing vocal mimicry and ventriloquism.

!!!info I took a few liberties with renaming and combining things in the spirit of not everyone getting the same options, so here are what I've renamed and what they are comprised of. As I think of more they'll be added!
[Changeling] = [Humie] + [Slime] + [Monstermash].
[Oozing Orifices] = [Everwet] + [Buckets Of Cum]. Could Add [Milky] and/or [Fluid Druid] to the mix but I have neither.
[Humbling Beginnings] = [Reincarnation] + [Aww Shit] + [Here We Go Again] + [Orphan] + [Lost]
[Scouter+] = [HUD] + [Status]
[Fixed Physique] = [Permanence] + [Man Portions]
