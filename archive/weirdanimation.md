what do you mean? the closest i think is madness day and that's not for a couple weeks.

piffblaze: Response to Weird Animation Trend
nah nah it's not combat madness related. it's the smbz inspired ones that do shit like metal mario vs donkey kong or whatever the fuck. there's some new animations coming out that got the same character in them that's called 'Executable M' that look like mario.exe with the m&l art style

[SCREENCAP OF AN UNIDENTIFIED MOVIE IS SHOWN, DEPICTING WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS EXECUTABLE M. BLOOD FLOWS DOWN HIS HAT AND COVERS THE FACE OF M. HE IS FACING OFF AGAINST SHADOW THE HEDGEHOG IN THE SCREENCAP, SHOWN TO BE AT LEAST TWICE THE SIZE OF SHADOW.]

checked the homepage and I'm not seeing anything new, maybe you're just being recommended old stuff?

piffblaze: Response to Weird Animation Trend
trust me, i'd know if this was some old shit. especially since one of the animators that's taking part in this has been someone i watch religiously and all of a sudden, he's made a video of 'Executable M vs Sonic the Hedgehog'. Pretty short one too at a couple of minutes where it's just M kicking the living shit out of Sonic until he skins him and wears him as a fur coat. he spoke at the end, something like 'THE BLUE BLUR CAN NEVER DO WHAT NINTENDOES'

[SCREENCAP OF THE AFOREMENTIONED MOVIE, DEPICTING A BLOODIED M WEARING THE COAT, STANDING IN FRONT OF A BLACK BACKGROUND. WITH THE WORDS BEHIND HIM. THE SKIN HAS TO BE STRETCHED OVER HIS BACK DUE TO HIS STOCKY BUILD.]

I think I know what you're talking about. Saw a video earlier where it was that thing fighting King Bowser and at the end he crushes the shell with a stomp and all of Bowser's guts come flying out of him. It had some weird ending words as well where it was "THE VILLAIN WILL ALWAYS LOSE".

[SCREENCAP OF THE AFOREMENTIONED MOVIE, FOCUSED ON THE FACE OF BOWSER, A BLOOD TRAIL LEAVING OUT OF HIS MOUTH AS HIS WORDS OVERLAY THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. THE TALONS ON M'S HAND ARE SCRATCHING OUT BOWSER'S EYES.]

thank god someone else saw that shit. it's fucking strange in that it's not even coolrash's version of exe, it's just some buff guy version of it

LaumblePot: Response to Weird Animation Trend
He does some fourth wall breaking stuff too, did you see the video where he went off against Mecha Sonic?

piffblaze: Response to Weird Animation Trend
shit yeah yeah, once that freak tore off mecha sonic's head he threw it at the "camera". could've sworn before the animation ended he picked it back up and looked into it with his red eyes, with no words being said. weird shit

[SCREENCAP OF TWO RED DOTS. THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BUT BLACKNESS IN PHOTO.]

shit i'm starting to see this stuff too, checked out an old animator i used to watch and he's got a movie out called "Executable M vs Devil Mario", can't even remember the last time he posted a video. pretty fucking gnarly one too, the Executable M thing grabbed the katana thing Devil Mario has and gutted him with it. then he chopped up the guy into pieces and shoved them through the katana before saying "THE HERO NEVER SUCCUMBS TO EVIL".

[SCREENCAP OF AFOREMENTIONED MOVIE, WITH EXECUTABLE M PROUDLY DISPLAYING THE CORPSE OF DEVIL MARIO. HE ONLY LOOKS AT YOU.]

LaumblePot: Response to Weird Animation Trend
Saw that movie too. Judging by the last movie he posted, he hasn't made a video in 3 years.

777111gleeful: Response to Weird Animation Trend
wait are u fucking real? what kinda organized kinda shit are they doing where they can get old guys like that outta retirement?

piffblaze: Response to Weird Animation Arend
something real fucky's starting to happen, check the users that this is happening to

LaumblePot: Response to Weird Animation Trend
Wait a fucking minute. Where did their old videos go, I can't see any of them anymore.

piffblaze: Response to Weird Animation Trend
now it looks like the only thing they've ever posted was their Executable M movies. this shit is fucking weird man, i don't even know what to think

EXM: RESPONSE
Then don't think anymore, just listen closely. 
I see that my actions have garnered the attention of some measly mortals so allow me to grace your presence and explain myself. 
The people I have taken over have committed a grave and serious crime of misrepresenting the character you know as Mario. The resilience and might of this character is ignored for the matter of favoritism for such banal characters like "Sonic the Hedgehog", "Shadow the Hedgehog" and even evil versions of Mario such as "Devil Mario" (as if the beloved plumber would ever succumb to evil). 
I've made it my duty to rectify the errors these pathetic runts have made.

piffblaze: Response to RESPONSE
okay retard, you're getting reported

LaumblePot: Response to RESPONSE
Yeah sorry but we're not believing you for shit when you say that you've messed up these guys because they made mario lose at a sprite fight.

EXEM: RESPONSE
Is that right? What would you say if I posted this then?

[SCREENCAP OF UNIDENTIFIED PERSON SITTING IN A COMPUTER CHAIR. HE CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED DUE TO THE LACK OF FACIAL RECOGNITION. THERE IS ONLY RED WHERE A FACE WOULD BE.]

777111gleeful: Response to RESPONSE
you sick asshole, i didn't need to see that today.

EXEM: LISTEN
It is what you needed to see in order to believe me. They besmirched the name of Mario so it is only fair that they are punished.
Their skills could've been used in a productive manner, demonstrating the ability of the greatest plumber in existence.
But they weren't. So I made sure they were never used in an ill-fated manner again.
Oh, before you even get the idea to do so.
There's no use trying to stop me.
I killed all of them 2 hours ago.
This is what you live with now.
This is where I take my leave.
You won't see me again.
Unless you wrong him again.
Farewell.
- Executable M
