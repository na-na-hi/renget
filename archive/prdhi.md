#Dividends Overview
***
This section is meant to represent the long-term investment quality, represented by wallet composition. ‘Last Dividends’ displays the last dividends payout, ‘Average Net Worth’ is the average of daily net worth measured at 20:00 GMT+0 on every day pre-dividends, and ‘Approximate ROI %’ is ‘Last Dividends’ divided by ‘Average Net Worth’. The data is sorted from highest ‘Approximate ROI %’ to lowest. Since it is just an approximation and concerns a single payout, you should aim for being consistently high rather than always being on the top.
The ‘Dividends’ section of the Report is a work-in-progress and thus has some limitations: it is susceptible to price fluctuations and since it only takes into account the last dividends, it will favor oshicoiners of the top coin(s) over people with wallets that are better diversified for week-by-week stable dividend income.
