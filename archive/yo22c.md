##### `Belly Scratches`
No wifwolf, however reluctant, can resist the power of belly scratches.

You and your waifur lie together in the open fields on a warm summer's eve. You were resting on top of her, as she held you close to her face and you both enjoyed the sweet serenity. While you lie there, the thought you were curious about came forth.
>"Is it a myth that if I scratch your belly in just the right spot that your leg starts kicking?"
>Her eyes go wide in shock: "W-what, no... Where did you get a crazy idea like that?" she says with a bit of a blush.
>A devious smile works its way across your face as you pull away from her: "Well then, surely you won't mind if I rub your belly... here." you say as you rub your hands across the base of her stomach.
>Her breath hitches in her throat a bit before she replies: "Ah, n-not at all."
>Hmmm, must not be here. You systematically rub and scratch her belly all over, much to her delight. She was watching you cautiously as you went, but said nothing as you worked your magic. You search and searched until your hands reach to the left side of her stomach, just slightly above her waistline. When your fingers run across there, you notice a tiny jolt from her right leg.
>"What was that?" you asked innocently perplexed.
>"N-nothing..."
>You scratch the spot again for a little longer, and just like magic, her right leg cutely starts to kick on its own accord.
>"Well well well, looks like it's not a myth after all" you declared.

>She said nothing, looking away from you as her leg instinctively kept going.
>"This is so embarrassing..." she says.
>"I for one think its adorable, as is the one trying to deny how good this feels." you said as you began to double your efforts.
>Much like her leg, her tail began to wag swiftly, indicating you were doing a good job. Her resistance to your finger assault finally crumbles as she begins to laugh aloud, placing her arm over her eyes trying to hide her amusement.
>You're practically beaming from ear to ear now. You loved when she got like this, even moreso when she tried to deny it. It was so sweet and adorable, you just couldn't help but tease her.
>Eventually, you relented your viscious assault. Her leg had stopped kicking, her tail stopped wagging, and she took long drawn in breaths to calm down. Her arm was still draped over her eyes, but her face had an exasperated but joyful smile.
>You lie back over top of her and park your head a few meters above her own. Realizing your presence, she slowly removes her arm from her eyes and stares at you in a poor attempt of being angry.
>"You can be such a jerk sometimes..."
>You slowly bring your face close to hers and you both shared in an intimate kiss. As you kissed, you gently caressed her delicate and beautiful hair. You pulled back and say: "As long as I'm your jerk."
>"You are so going to get it tonight." she said playfully. "I love you."
>"I love you too, my love."
