    Seriously, what's with all the normies making edits of his fights? It's not 'aesthetic,' it's disturbing. Let's be real here, Sandatsu's just another tall douchebag with a fancy quirk. Bet he gets all the attention from normie girls just 'cause he's tall.

    Jealous much? Sounds like someone's a quirkcel, lmao. Maybe if you had a decent quirk, you wouldn't be so bitter.

    I can't wait for that edgy faggot to kill himself. Suicide by hero is a rare treat these days.

    Man, can we please talk about something other than Sandatsu for once? Sick of seeing his ugly mug plastered all over this board

This sentiment resonated with a few other anons who were equally fatigued by the incessant chatter surrounding Sandatsu and his exploits.

    Seriously, it's like every other thread is about that guy. Can't we move on to something else?

    long live reaperposting!

Accompanying this declaration was a meme, featuring a seething Jötunn wojak and a smiling gigachad Sandatsu Owari.

    All he's doing is rampaging around like a retard. He's just a slightly more annoying villain, nothing special."

    nah i actually have a plan

Most posters in the thread ignored this, as it wasn't uncommon for other anons to pretend to be Owari himself, trying to bait others. However, there was one poster who could not resist the bait.

    Plan? Lets assume you're that faggot. You can destroy all the foreign shitholes you want, but it's clear that you're too much of a coward to face the consequences of your actions and return to Japan.

The thread went silent for a few minutes, which he used to go to the bathroom. When he returned to his room , there were no new posts. Satoru Tani leaned back in his creaky chair with a smug grin spreading across his face. The relentless barrage of Reaperfags posting had finally subsided, leaving him with a fleeting sense of victory.

Just as he was relishing in the silence, a voice pierced through the stillness of his room, sending a shiver down his spine.

"You know," the voice said, "all my return to Japan has been so far is boring."

He had long, unkempt hair which cascaded down his back in a wild tangle, with a single streak of vibrant blue contrasting against its dark color. His muscular frame was clad in a form-fitting black t-shirt with built in fingerless gloves. Tattered black pants adorned his lower half. And draped over his broad shoulders was a ragged cloth cape.

But it was his eyes that held Satoru's attention captive. Both young men had swirling irises, one blue, the other white.

Satoru's mind raced, his thoughts a jumbled mess as he struggled to process the reality of the situation. Here he was, face to face with one of the most feared villains in the world, and all within the confines of his own room. And the bastard was sitting on his bed all casual.

Satoru's heart pounded in his chest like a drumbeat of impending doom as Sandatsu rose from his seated position.

As Sandatsu approached, Satoru's muscles tensed, his body instinctively preparing for the worst. But to his astonishment, all Sandatsu did was study him with a curious gaze. With a simple nod, Sandatsu stepped back, the movement causing Satoru to flinch.

"Want to join my band of internationally wanted psychopaths?" his voice was calm, almost casual, as if he were discussing the weather rather than extending an invitation to join his group of notorious criminals.

"N-no?" Satoru spoke without realizing.

***Oh no. Oh FUCK. I'm so dead. Why the hell did I say that, why why why?!***

"Alright."

***Huh? HUUUUH?!***

Satoru was about to have a breakdown. Was that it? He just said 'no' to the most notorious mass murderer in the world.

"Sorry for messing with the thread," Sandatsu's voice broke the tense silence, his tone surprisingly apologetic. "I had my people track your address. It was a bit rushed so the server might've lagged a bit."

Sandatsu then disappeared into a portal to leave the room, casually waving goodbye to him.

After staying still for a few more minutes Satoru let out a shaky breath. Maybe it was muscle memory, but the first thing he did was reload the thread. He let out a defeated sigh after seeing that the reaperfags had taken that time to shit on him.

The room was cloaked in an oppressive silence, broken only by the soft click-clack of keys as Satoru carefully typed away on his computer. Yet, despite his outward appearance of focus, his mind was a whirlwind of anxiety and dread.

Behind him, lounging casually on his bed, was Sandatsu Owari, who came back shortly after leaving.

Sandatsu, oblivious to Satoru's inner turmoil, seemed perfectly at ease as he scrolled through his phone. On the other side, despite his best efforts to ignore the villain's presence, Satoru couldn't shake the feeling of unease that settled over him.

Satoru shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his eyes darting nervously around the room as he struggled to find something—anything—to break the silence. Even for someone like him, talking was preferred over the uncertainty of constantly waiting for the moment that psycho murdered him.

"Um... so, uh, when did you... uh, return to Japan?" Satoru finally managed to stammer out.

Sandatsu glanced up from his phone, his piercing gaze meeting Satoru's with an intensity that sent a shiver down his spine. "Hmm? Oh, a little while ago," he replied. "Been coming and going, dealing with stuff."

Satoru nodded dumbly, his mind racing as he searched desperately for something else to say. But try as he might, he couldn't seem to form a coherent thought. The room fell silent again, with Satoru, mouth open, sweating bullets, looking at Sandatsu.

"What?"

His heart skipped a beat as Sandatsu's piercing gaze bore into him, causing him to flinch involuntarily. "Uh, I-I mean..." Satoru stuttered, his words tumbling out in a jumble of panic. "Is it, uh, okay for you to, uh, chill here like this?" 

Sandatsu regarded him for a moment. Internally, Satoru was screaming.

Then, to Satoru's surprise, he simply shrugged. "Yeah, it's fine," he replied . "I'm just waiting until everything's ready. Plus, you remind me of someone I know, so it's kinda comfy."

As Sandatsu returned his attention to his phone, Satoru let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding, which he sucked in again when the villain turned to him once more.

"You want me to go away?"

Satoru's heart pounded in his chest. He felt like a deer caught in the headlights, frozen in place as he struggled to come up with a response.

"I mean, it's, uh, fine. Totally fine for you to, uh, chill here. No complaints from me!"

***God I wanna die. Fuck. FUCK! Why me?!***

Sandatsu's next question sent another jolt of panic coursing through Satoru's veins. "You wanna eat something?" the villain asked, his tone casual but his gaze unwavering.

Satoru flinched again. "Um, uh, i-ice cream?" he blurted out, the words tumbling from his lips before he could stop them.
