#Pirated Games Mega Thread

r/PiratedGames mods are not trustworthy enough to write their own thread. Don't trust them. I keep this thread up to date despite dropping out of moderation, but they feel the need to disregard it in favour of their own shit. Original thread can be viewed on [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230701162509/https://rentry.org/pgames-mega-thread). Think twice before trusting some rando site you found on whatever they declare to be their thread. Also check out the [cs.rin.ru trusted site list](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=95461).

Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Goodnight.
