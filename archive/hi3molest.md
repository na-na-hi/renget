###Molest
Molest notes (apply to SEA and JP servers only. CN was banned and NA/EU removed on release):
- Touch any parts of the valkyrie body (except the speech bubble) to have a chance to get a random molest effect to valk or team. You may need to molest a lot to get the desired molest effect.
- For base valk with awaken form, molest effect gained on one form will not affect the other form. If base valk has augment, the augment version can make use of its own base version molest effect.
- New molest effect gained will overwrite the current molest effect.
- Must deploy the valk for the molest effect to work.
- A molest effect is effective for any 5 stage entry (stage restart counts as one).
- Close/restart the whole game will remove all the molest effect on all the valks.
- Molest effect potency is affected by the hearts count (max effect at maxed bar; we call it 5 hearts and usually takes a month to max).
- Molest animation can be cancelled by clicking on the profile during the molested animation and then going back to the bridge menu: https://streamable.com/7zpx48
