#Suppressing the Urge
Suisei looked around the laboratory. Chemicals, solutions, potions of every kind lined the shelves. Near the front of the lab, a cabinet that read "consumption ready". 
"You made all of these?" Suisei said looking into one of the potions.
"That's right, senpai! All of these have been carefully crafted to have very specific uses. That one you're looking at right there guarantees me a good night's sleep." Koyori replied.
"Oh my, that sounds useful!" Suisei said in amazement.
"Of course! My potions are very reliable." Koyori said, proudly. "It can even help while streaming."
Suisei put the potion down. "In what ways?"
"Let me use an example. How often do you need to take bathroom breaks, or mute the mic while streaming?"
"Never, of course! I am a pure idol. I would never need to go to the bathroom." Suisei said.
"Ehhh? Well, if you say so." Koyori said. She gestured to a series of potions near her streaming set-up. "I take one of these, and I never have to get up to pee, poop or even need to mute in order to release gas. It's pretty perfect.
Suisei looked at them in envy. No more would the human needs bother her during her streams, if she could just have them. Problem was, she just made a big deal out of not needing them.
"Well, I guess it's a good way to behave like an idol. For me, a natural idol, it comes naturally." Suisei said with a haughty expression.
"Is that so." Koyori said, narrowing her eyes a little. "Well, you're the senpai!"

"Let's see if this works as advertised..." 
Suisei looked down at the potion she had pilfered from Koyori. She couldn't just let that go untested. She had a stream in a few minutes, and she could feel a need to go pee. She swallowed down some of the potion that was supposed to help the drinker hold her bladder. Miraculously, the feeling went away entirely.
"Incredible!" Suisei murmured.
The stream went by flawlessly. No gas. No need to poop. Having streamed in complete comfort, she felt good the entire time. She streamed for much longer than usual. She no longer felt held back by her body, at least until she got hungry.
After the stream had ended, she could feel the need returning. She ignored it for a moment, but once the potion fully wore off, the need was suddenly as strong as if she had held it the entire time. She bolted off to the toilet, but she wasn't prepared. 
"Oh no oh no." Suisei whimpered. She could no longer hold on. A warm feeling came over her leg as her piss trickled quickly down her leg onto the floor, staining her panties on the way out. She could feel a turtle head emerging from her ass, but she managed to get there in time, just barely. The lesson was well learned. Next stream, after she took some more of the potion, she went to relieve herself directly after the stream even if the feeling was suppressed. 
The potion taking continued until her next break day. But surprisingly, she still felt like taking the potion even on her off-day. Even if she properly relieved herself, it felt so much more comfortable taking the potion, right? 
Suisei partook.

It was barely a week later that Suisei ran out of potion. She had started using it habitually, and she missed the comfort too much not to go back to it. She snuck back to Koyori's lab at night. Koyori wasn't asleep when she arrived, but Suisei was willing to wait as long as she needed to. Once the coast was clear, Suisei went back to Koyori's streaming set-up and pilfered some more of the potions. Koyori could surely make as many as she needed, she wouldn't miss a few, right? And as luck would have it, there was a massive case full of the potions sitting unsecured. After taking off with them, Suisei slept soundly that night knowing her needs would be suppressed the next day.
When it came time to stream, Suisei took a dose of the potion. It felt like such a relief to take it, something positive buzzed inside her body. Except, there was a difference. Suisei's stomach gurgled noisily as something churned inside her. It was right at the beginning of the stream. The mic picked it up. Suisei panicked.
"Eh eh eh eh? What was that? T-that must have been somebody moving furniture upstairs or something."
The chat wasn't buying it. Suisei was sweating. Had she taken the wrong potion? Had Koyori mixed the wrong potion? Suisei tried to continue, but the gas was building up in a big way. The need was so much more overwhelming than it had ever been. She just needed to let off a little wind.
She eventually caved and muted. She closed her eyes and tried to let out a little wind from her ass. But to her surprise, it was much stronger than she intended. A loud, horribly smelly fart ripped from her ass. But that wasn't the worst part. No, the worst part was that as she caved, it felt so good to relieve the pressure. A warm, sickeningly pleasurable feeling reverberated from her ass, contrasting with the awful stench.
'Maybe I should cancel...? No, after that gurgle it'll look suspicious...' Suisei thought.
That wasn't all, either. As the stream went on longer and longer, she could feel the need to relieve herself become more and more intense. She was muting every five minutes or so to let off more smelly, pleasurable farts. As much as she could retain control against her toilet urges, the need was so overwhelming she could barely stand it. Her legs started to tremble.
'Oh no, there's no way I'll make it to the end of the stream... I should-' But before she could finish that thought, the dam burst in her bladder. A geyser of piss erupted from her, immediately soaking her panties, a waterfall of piss pouring over her seat, quickly forming a massive puddle. The sound was as loud as a kitchen sink. She quickly muted before she started moaning involuntarily. Giving in felt too good to ignore, she was already shaking with pleasure, her eyes rolling back.
Her chat was starting to get concerned with how silent she was being, and the strange noises that were briefly audible. She loosened her absolutely ruined, piss soaked panties.
"I'm... I'm going to have to end this stream early. There's something going on over here. I'm sorry about that." Her voice was shakey. She hoped her arousal didn't show.
She muted again as she could feel what was coming next. She felt a disgusting glow in her bowels. She tried to stand up, but there was no use. Her turd began to already push itself out of her ass. She gasped as it started to emerge, the feeling of the poop sliding against her anal walls was a more intense pleasure than she'd ever felt. The long, thick, foul smelling turd snaked out of her ass and piled up onto her chair, every inch making her convulse with pleasure. The feeling was so intense, she almost came.
"Ew ew ew! So gross!" She said to herself. The sweat from her arousal dripped from every pore on her body.

Suisei got a call from Koyori.
"Interesting stream you had today, senpai." Koyori said, smugly.
Suisei started to sweat. "It was a little strange, yes. One of my rare... technical difficulties."
"I bet. What was the issue, exactly?"
"Ah, well, it's just... It's personal." Suisei said. She could again feel her gas rising up, as it had all day.
"Imagine that." Koyori said. "Unrelated, but what do you think about taking things that don't belong to you without permission?"
Suisei gulped. "It... it's not a good thing to do."
"Oh, you think? I mean, if somebody were to take, let's say, a potion without having a way of knowing what kind of potion it was... Well, food for the thought."
"What are you getting at?"
"Oh, just making conversation. Some potions went missing."
"W-what did those potions do?" Suisei quickly muted her mic and blasted another smelly fart.
"Well, let's just say that there are some potions that do something similar to the exact opposite of the potion I showed you the other day. Except, well, let's also say these potions are a little bit more permanent, and a lot more addictive too."
"A-addictive? ...Permanent??"
"Oh, quite. The other potions just helped you stall out the need to expel for a little while. These potions change your gut bacteria completely, meaning your emissions will be a lot stronger, louder, heavier and smellier for the rest of your life. Of course, they have some interesting short term side effects, like being a diuretic, making the smell and feeling of partaking in those acts pleasurable, so forth."
"Why would you make something like that?"
"Oh, what are you worried about? It's not like it would work on someone who doesn't need to do those things in the first place." Koyori said, coyly. "Anyway, in answer to your question... hey, why not? It's fun to see what I can make." Koyori chuckled.
"Why are you telling me all this?" Suisei said, desperately.
"Oh, just wanted to warn you that my lab and equipment will be secured properly from now on. But hey, if you need any potion of any kind, I'm sure we can come to some kind of agreement." Koyori said. "Oh, and I'll be discrete about it too. Researcher's promise!" 
Suisei farted again. Koyori's giggles betrayed the fact that she had forgotten to mute this time.

By next morning the short term effects had worn off. Even as she awoke, the potion was on her mind. She could feel the temptation to just take a little, to take the cravings off. After her breakfast, she decided to get her morning needs out of the way. As she sat on the toilet and peed, she felt a profound disappointment as the orange liquid poured out of her. It felt almost prickly this time in comparison to how good it felt when it was gushing out of her. What was worse, it still took a long time to empty her bladder.
"It felt so good yesterday..."
Beyond that, the smell was absolutely awful, and had never had such a strong color before. It was clear the way she processed food was different. With the potion though it would at least feel nice...
"No! I mustn't..."
Suisei went back to her desk. She had done the bare minimum to remove the shit from her chair and wipe it down, but it was in sorry state. It stunk horribly, completely ruined. She didn't have the time to replace it yet, so she threw a couple paper towels over it. She also, just to be safe, put several buckets down next to her chair just in case she might have another accident. Whe she sat down, she saw them - right in reach of the computer - were the potions. It would be so easy to take one right now, so simple. How bad could it be, really? Very bad. She knew the answer. The craving was so strong... but she couldn't. Suisei put her water bottle down in front of them. 
"It would be terrible if I accidentally grabbed the wrong drink... I'd better make sure to take the right one..." She said, disingenuously. She burned with shame as she knew what her body wanted.
Suisei looked at her discord - her manager had sent her a message.
>Hey, Suichan. I understand you have a friend who might be having a few stomach problems. There's a small program that's been developed that can detect and censor sensitive sounds. It'll cause a bit of audio distortion of course, so if your friend uses it might be noticeable. Just thought I'd let you know!
Her Manager was always so discreet. Suisei decided to use it just in case. After all, you never know what might happen.
Later, during her stream, she grabbed a bottle when she needed something to drink. She could feel that it was the wrong one... but once her fingers wrapped around it, she didn't have the willpower to resist. Her body needed it.
She chugged far more than she had previously.
Her tummy rumbled again. This time, the autofilter caught it.
"Ah, sorry if there are any audio distortions! I've been having some issues lately." Suisei lied.
As the pressure built up in her ass, she let one rip. She almost moaned as she did so, but again the audio filter caught it.
The stream went on, she kept streaming, the whole time. Shitting freely onto the paper towels, pissing in the bucket on the floor, trying not to show her pleasure. It was so wrong, but somehow the wrongness of it all made it feel even more pleasurable. Imagine if the software stopped working... the thrill of the danger sent her over the edge. She quickly muted as she made a large moan of ecstasy, squirting hard enough to stain the underside of her desk with foul smelling piss.
"Maybe it's better if I wean off slowly..."

Weeks later, Suisei's room was in a sorry state. There was a thin layer of nasty piss coating the floor. Her sheets, her panties, her socks, her chairs, even her walls all had foul skidmarks. Loose stools were laying uncollected all over the room. The stench was unimaginable, but Suisei was now too far gone to care anymore. She popped a potion. She had gotten used to holding in her need to go constantly now, but instead of going to the bathroom, she just gave into the pleasure and started masturbating. It felt so good to masturbate while holding it in. As she sat at her chair, ready to stream, she eyed the icon of the software that had been muting all her suspicious noises. The audience had been complaining about audio distortions endlessly since she had started taking these devilish potions.
"A-a new challenge..." Suisei said, in a lust fueled haze. "I'll turn it off and hold it in the whole time... No muting..."
Suisei told the chat that she fixed her audio distortion. The game began. The whole stream, Suisei clenched and rubbed herself against the chair. The gas, the shit, the piss... it all begged for release.
She had to hold it in, it would be so humiliating if she messed up now.
Suisei's gameplay and commentary suffered immensely. The chat was asking what was wrong. Suisei came up with as many excuses as she could, but she could see the burgeoning suspicion in her chat.
She reached down to touch herself a little bit. Then she started pleasuring herself harder. It was hard to keep from letting moans creep into her voice.
What would happen if she got caught here? All of her beloved fans who loved how seiso she was would abandon her and treat her like a disgusting degenerate.
Suisei moaned, but passed it off as a yawn.
She would end up attracting a new crowd. One that only saw her as a gassy, smelly pig. People would no longer draw beautiful fan art, but art of her performing the most disgusting acts, a filthy slut with no dignity.
At this thought, she fingered herself even harder and faster. She stopped holding her voice back. She had lost control.
BRRPPPPPTT
Her bowels made a massive, unmistakable sound as she lost control of them. A monstrous fart, followed by the wet slap of a massive turd hitting the ground. The feeling of the shit coming out made her squirt and scream with pleasure, blasting her computer screen, her desk and even herself with piss. She collapsed in a pile of her own refuse in a daze. Her reputation was forever ruined. She continued to touch herself with one hand, and reached for her mouse with the other, preparing to end today's stream.
"O-otsumachi!" She said, in a humiliated bliss.
