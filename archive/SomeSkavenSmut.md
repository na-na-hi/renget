Warpstone Addict

Kreek towered over no-furs from the surface and had slaughtered plenty of man-things, elf-things, and dwarf-things. However, all that came to an end when Kreek caught the eye of Grey Seer Thrangul. 

They were introduced on the field of battle. Having skewered a dozen elves, it was one of Kreek's proudest showings. The enemy company had acknowledged their defeat and was on verge of routing when both sides were decimated by green lightning. 

Kreek returned to his feet, finding himself surrounded by a sea of twisting ashes. Both sides had been annihilated faster than he could thrust his halberd. He found the weapon impaled in the earth, reduced to a charred and smoking branch. While scrambling to find a replacement, a cackle overpowered the cacophony of war.

The wizard was diminutive, even for a non-stormvermin. Dwarfs would have stood higher than the white-furred mouse. He possessed a narrow waist and slim arms, but his hips were uncomfortably wide. They were supported by a pair of impressive thighs, his only muscular body part. If Kreek knew what one was, he would describe the wizard’s figure as bowling pin like.

But despite Thrangul’s small stature, his gestures commanded armies and magic. The soldier kneeled on instinct, just as Thrangul released another bolt of green electricity. Thunderous applause shook the earth, as well as Kreek’s spirit. That battle alone, Thrangul annihilated more enemy soldiers than Kreek had confronted during his year long career. 

But instead of passing by, along with the sea of rats he commanded, Thrangul leaned over him. 

“Ooh! Strong-Tough clanrat knows his place! He won’t be vanished into dust-smoke like his fellows!” 

The giggling grew louder while eyes wandered across Kreek’s midriff. The armor was blackened, missing a chest and shoulder’s worth of plate, but Kreek would not have noticed the damage without Thrangul’s gaze. The mouse unblinkingly studied his exposed flesh.

Kreek’s tensed muscles were as tough as armor, and he could crush a pair of surface-things with his embrace. Although a thin layer of fat coated his body, it couldn’t hide his sculpted musculature. The stitches across his body were becoming strained as he grew. Kreek enjoyed the jealous gazes of lesser rats, finding them confidence boosting, but Thrangul’s stare was disturbing. An abnormal sort of hungry. 

“Kreek would like his lord to know, he’s a stormvermin. No mere clanrat.” 

Thrangul looked to the ash, smile never leaving his face. 

“Ah, whiskers. Thrangul has made a costly-costly blunder. But the only one clever-sharp enough to duck was you! There has been no great loss. But just in case, you should wait-guard behind me from now on.”

From that point onwards, Kreek stood beside the grey-seer as his trusted bodyguard. And he could not imagine a more unfulfilling life.

The extent of his duties was standing in Thrangul’s war room, and on exciting occasions procuring warpstone dust for the addict. Even in battle, the little mouse consumed a frightening amount of the stuff. Or so Kreek assumed; His only experience fighting alongside Thrangul was the first.

That was nearly a month ago. Ever since then, Thrangul had merely lurked, gathering troops to the undercity. Every day had become the same, with one peculiar quirk. Thrangul was infatuated with Kreek.

At first it was forbidden for Kreek to replace his damaged armor, then pieces started to go missing. Finally, Thrangul dropped the act entirely and granted him a new set. Nothing covered his chest, only a band around his throat and an armored skirt. Kreek suspected an assassination at first, but his pectorals were on display for the Wizard’s pleasure.

The mouse loved ordering him around. To procure his drugs, to move his pieces on the war board, and to lift anything he considered heavy, which was most things. He would lean closer whenever Kreek bent down, fascinated by the sight of armor hiking up. Despite an obvious carnal hunger, the wizard satisfied himself by watching; Always grinning. 

It was sickening. And pathetic. And degenerate. And humiliating. But Kreek found it strangely thrilling as well. He put more time into exercise than ever before.

But despite his dedication, he gorged himself on the delicacies afforded to new his position, and the hard ridges of his abs grew soft. 

Kreek briefly felt pangs of concern about the shape of his body, but Thrangul’s interest only grew as his strength did. The mouse would salivate over his stomach, despite his faint abs, and Kreek often caught him reaching towards his increasingly wide shoulders.

Angering the stormvermin further, he found his anxieties relieved by Thrangul’s continued interest. Still, Kreek would look away, smirking, whenever Thrangul’s gaze intensified. 

Having power over the wizard was pleasant, but Kreek planned to reject any of Thrangul’s propositions. Thrangul’s vice was a weakness, or so Kreek believed, and he hoped refusing the puny mouse would finally knock the grin off his face. 

The soldier never masturbated and was quite proud of it. He saved his lust for unpleasant trips to the broodmothers. They were half rotting, bloated, barely living tools of reproduction, but Kreek was demanded due to his physique. After enough visits, relieving his urges by any other means seemed self-indulgent. 

But day after day, week after week, Thrangul never took the bait. Kreek remained eye candy far longer than it took to become tiresome. He was languishing; his talent for combat squandered to the whims of a perverted wizard. 

So, Kreek hatched a plan. 

Not a very complex one, for Kreek was not a very complex rat.

It involved taking his halberd and sticking an alone, distracted Thrangul. The wizard shunned any form of exercise and screamed in pain when his paw was nicked. He would not be too hard to kill. Or so Kreek believed. 

“Did you really think Thrangul would die to a spear-knife in the back?”

With his weapon inches away, the wizard’s ear twitched and Kreek was immobilized by an unseen force. 

It took effort to merely draw breath, as if he had been buried alive. Thrangul walked beside him, smiling triumphantly, and running his paws over the halberd’s haft. Once the digits reached his shoulder, Thrangul fell into Kreek’s chest, rubbing himself against bulging muscles with a giggle. Drool quickly began to mat Kreek’s fur. Instead of angry, Thrangul was excited. Giddy even. That awful, gloating smile remained. 

“Thrangul was so worried that Kreek was a pathetic dog-thing, eager to obey-serve. That’s no way for a Skaven to live! Especially not Thrangul’s proud bodyguard! I need you to be the pinnacle of Skavenness! You need to impress when I show-flaunt you to other seers at the council!”

Saliva covered each of Kreek’s abs now, and the wizard continued going lower. Svelte fingers curled around Kreek’s solitary piece of armor. With the telekinetic grip on his jaw released, he chose to shout

“Kreek is no trophy! Kreek is the-“

“mightiest of all Skaven soldiers,” they said in unison, although one voice had a sarcastic drawl.

The wizard yanked Kreek’s only piece of clothing off, unable to suppress a squeal as he gazed upon the soldier’s cock. Even completely flaccid it hung like a third leg. Despite Kreek’s displeasure, he still had to grin. Kreek was always the biggest, both his body and his tool. 

With the flick of a wrist, Thrangul launched his guard into the seer’s throne, rubbing his paws together; Twinkling eyes betrayed his perverse imagination. As Kreek tried to escape, an eye roll stilled him once more.

“Stay in the chair. Kreek’s betrayal needs punishment yes-yes? Would he prefer-like to be donated to clan Moulder? ”

“No…” was all the victim could muster.

“Then he won’t be! Thrangul wants to spoil-breed his new consort! Spoil-break with new pleasures!”  Thrangul cackled, dropping his own loincloth to the floor. 

The battle-hardened warrior’s eyes shot open as his commander revealed an equally imposing cock. On the grey seer’s stunted body, it touched his knees. He placed it on Kreek’s thigh, watching his face as its weight sunk in. Kreek refused to meet his gaze, but he couldn’t escape the scent. Thrangul reeked of sex. 

A heavy, slightly sweet, aroma rolled off the wizard and, shamefully, Kreek's own dick began to stiffen in response. Thrangul squeezed the two rods together, but his paws could barely handle the girth of one. The grey seer's dick drooled a copious volume of translucent green precum, reminiscent of warpstone powder. 

Even though his organ was being mashed against another stiff object, the grinding filled Kreek with jittery, rising pleasure. As hard as he tried to ignore the sensation, streams of green were joined by his own murky emission. Thrangul studied Kreek’s nervous moans, his confidence growing while his bodyguard struggled to feign aloofness. 

The soldier’s hips jerked once, and that was all his pride could take. He stood up grimacing “I’m no pleasure-toy.”

But it was no use. A flash of emerald in the grey seer’s pupils and Kreek’s muscles strained against nothing. Thrangul’s eyes locked on Kreek, and Kreek’s eyes locked on the door. Eventually, even Thrangul began to pant from exertion. 

“Sit! Sit-Sit!” 

But Kreek would not be convinced with words or magic.

So, with a displeasured huff, the seer climbed up his bodyguard, pressing his cock to the stormvermin’s lips. With a frozen body, Kreek could only observe as his mouth was filled with flesh. He choked like he had gorged himself too fast, tears welling in his eyes, but he was unable to spit out the intrusion. The seer’s cock prodded every surface inside his maw, his cheeks, his tongue, and eventually sinking into his throat. The thick shaft plunged as deep as it pleased, even crossing the curve of his neck. 

But its taste stifled Kreek’s protests. The green precum was sickeningly palatable. As the scent suggested, it had a slightly sweet, mostly savory flavor, like liquid flesh. He had fought kin over meals that tasted worse. After a few thrusts, Kreek's muscles began to relent and he sank back into the throne, basking in the flavor as he held Thrangul aloft.  

The grey seer was desperately trying to stifle a laugh while fucking Kreek’s warm, wet, lively face. Its tongue basted the intruding staff in saliva, dragging in fresh ways each prod. It payed special attention to the tip, lapping dutifully before suction claimed his tainted emission.
 
Years of ingesting warpstone by increasingly creative methods had mutated the grey seer’s body. At first, he only felt disappointment. With warpstone leaking from his veins, it was nearly impossible to reach a decent high, but there were entertaining benefits as well. For example, his cum had become a tasty, mind-altering, and intensely addictive brew. The fluid was so potent he quit demanding blowjobs from his subjects, as he was often awakened by desperate ex-lovers gagging on his cock. However, he would make an exception for Kreek. 

Thrangul was infatuated with the warrior. He was nearly as enormous as a rat ogre, but far more alluring. Every muscle was conditioned to the peak of physical performance. His narrow facial features were covered in soft black hair, aside from shining, sharp teeth. His shoulders were wide and brawny. His legs thick and scarred. The stormvermin seemed to radiate strength, easily capable of lifting catapults unassisted, but Kreek didn't realize his own might was abnormal. In addition, Thrangul barely rose to the height of Kreek’s waist.

And Thrangul wanted to breed his abs. The handsome ridges were softened by fat, but hints of their shape remained. His pectorals were a different story. They seemed to be chiseled out of stone, and they perfectly framed the rest of his body. Whenever the stormvermin exerted himself, his muscles contracted to a perfect firmness and Thrangul couldn't help but drool. In a very skaven manner, Thrangul was obsessed and more than a little jealous of Kreek. He wanted to own him.

Which is why Thrangul was extra infuriated when Kreek became the first skaven to reject his leaky cock. He held the diminutive wizard in air like a doll, giving Thrangul an excellent view of Kreek’s precum smeared muzzle, but he soon shook off the effects. Thrangul only had a moment to appreciate Kreek’s glorious intoxication. 

“No-No. No more foul magics for Kreek. Thrangul won’t enslave-break Kreek with a filthy cheat!” 

The grey seer could only express himself through a dry, painfully blank face as Kreek put him down. Even while Kreek sat, the tiny mouse had to crane his neck. His head was below Kreek’s pecs. 

“Kreek wants a fair fight, yes-yes? Then Thrangul will provide one. A battle-war of might that Kreek prefers.” He mumbled while spreading Kreek’s legs open.

Thrangul began to reciprocate the earlier blowjob, but instead of pushing him away, his bodyguard leaned into a slouch. Still, Kreek lacked enthusiasm. He hissed through clenched teeth while Thrangul’s tongue slathered the bottom of his dick in spit. 

When Thrangul’s mouth passed the halfway point, Kreek entered a narrow, pliant throat. Hacking and gasping accompanied each thrust. Two hands escorted the tightly clenched lips, their fingertips barely meeting around its girth. Any trickling fluids were smeared against the lower half of Kreek’s shaft.
 
When Kreek finally opened one eye to watch the show, he saw Thrangul scowling back up at him, studying him for any signs of satisfaction. He had to look away immediately to avoid orgasm.

The sight of his awful boss choking on his cock was hard to resist. Another wet retch brought the image to mind, and he couldn’t help but thrust, driving his dick far deeper than the wizard expected. Kreek’s balls slapped against a furry jaw, and Thrangul’s cold nose pressed into his stomach. His cockhead exited Thrangul’s neck and passed into his tighter chest. At its deepest point, the grip around Kreek’s tip loosened, as if it had poked into Thrangul's stomach. Kreek couldn’t conceal his smile as the mouse fell on his ass, hacking up spit and precum.

The moment Kreek was free of pleasure, he desperately wanted it again. His frustrated, violent mind imagined fucking the grey seer’s throat until he passed out from lack of air. But that would be admitting defeat.

Thrangul was smirking again, sordid trails dripping off his mouth. Kreek’s body yearned to invite him back up, but his spite released a snort. It took all his strength to feign irritation. 

And it finally knocked off Thrangul’s silly grin. He looked like any other skaven, a little cowardly, a little vicious. Thrangul wiped fluids from his face, hiding his disappointment, while Kreek got a moment to catch his breath. His eyes wandered to the shoddy wooden walls and pieces of tarp that formed Thrangul’s private quarters. Anything that would help him ignore his twitching crotch. 

“Thrangul’s services are not good enough for his toy, hmm? Is strong-tough clanrat too honorable to enjoy his lord’s best!? Kreek should speak up! Yes-Yes!” 

A tremor ran through Kreek’s body, bottom to top. He could be reduced to ash with a glance, but instead, Thrangul climbed back onto Kreek’s knees. In place of pain, tiny paws clamped around the soldier’s organ once more.  

The grip raised and fell in a slow, soothing rhythm, until something hot and stiff prodded against Kreek’s ass. He returned to proper posture with a whimper. Thrangul’s shaft felt even bigger than it looked, especially when it was grinding between Kreek’s tail and balls. Each time it gently poked his asshole, Kreek inhaled reflexively. A heavy ooze began to coat the entrance.  

Kreek had seen the aftermath of Thrangul’s depraved indulgences before. The wizard had no interest in journeys to the broodmothers. Aside from copious drug use, and drooling over his bodyguard, Thrangul’s entertainment took the form of other males. 

Thrangul often escorted the cleanest rat available to his quarters, ordering his guard to ‘protect the door.’ Any sounds of hesitation always melted into frenzied moans by a few minutes in, but the thumping, and pleasured squeaking, could continue for an hour. Each one limped out, leaking a thick, green goo from their backsides. Thrangul’s chosen became exceptionally eager to please afterwards, but he never chose the same one twice. 

Kreek was more aware than any other Skaven about Thrangul’s persuasive technique. Even Thrangul himself missed his lovers looking back after he pushed them out. 

Unwanted throughs entered Kreek’s mind. What would be so wrong with facing whatever they had? He didn’t really have a choice, did he? Why not surrender, and just enjoy the experience? But just as Kreek had accepted his fate, closing his eyes, and biting his lip, Thrangul pulled away.

“Too extreme for my toy-thing’s first time, yes-yes. Thrangul will make him want-beg for it first, Yes-Yes!”

The tiny mouse raised his hips up, taking a deep breath, before impaling his ass on Kreek’s dick. Even with copious precum and spit to lubricate the way, Thrangul descended slowly. The stormvermin’s senses were engulfed by a feverishly hot, narrow passage. Relentlessly clenching flesh gripped Kreek’s shaft. Every imperfection on his member dragged against insistent, soft guts.

The mouse flexed his thighs, beginning to rise and fall, but each descent only lasted a few inches. With every repetition his hips dropped a little further, as if Thrangul was pounding away with a hammer. Eventually, Kreek could distinguish when he was entering untouched depths. The twitching muscle would be as firm as the rope of a loaded catapult, resisting angrily as it spread to accommodate him. 

He couldn't resist staring at the mouse's belly, spellbound as the tip of his rod appeared as faint bulge on Thrangul's waist. It was barely visible, a tiny hill on the wizard’s narrow abdomen, but the thought itself boiled Kreek’s blood. The visual, along with the repeated sensation of breaking new ground, was making Kreek’s balls ache. 

On the cusp of climax, Kreek snapped out of his bliss and hugged Thrangul, halting the savage thrusts. Although Kreek earned a few breaths, the pleasure wasn’t completely abated. Gripping Thrangul had pressed the wizard’s cock between both torsos. Aside from flesh wrapped around Kreek’s dick, he felt the reverse of when they had frotted before; The top of his shaft grinding against a stiff companion. 

His eyes roamed upwards to find Thrangul smiling again, but it lacked the usual air of superiority. His grin was wide enough to reveal his furthest teeth, and his eyes absentmindedly wandered across the ceiling. The grey seer only looked this satisfied during his most intense warpdust binges, and it was only for the briefest of moments. Thrangul sank lower and lower, until his bouncy ass finally landed on toned thighs.

The mouse fell back, continuing to stare upwards as if he was experiencing visions. His limber cock remained pressed between Kreek’s abs and Thrangul’s own bulging stomach. A layer of transparent green pre already coated the stormvermin’s torso.

Kreek was shamelessly panting, every nerve on his dick was jolting with satisfaction. Electricity ran through his veins. Half the pleasure was from sensation, and the rest from watching his boss’s limp body twitch. Being balls deep in a responsive, tight partner dwarfed any satisfaction from fucking a rotting brood mother. 

And best of all he didn’t have to do a thing. Thrangul was fucking him with his own strength. All Kreek had to do was sit back, and his pride would stay intact.

The wizard raised his body back up, legs shivering as he strained himself, pushing until Kreek’s tip barely remained within his ass. Kreek bit his lip to pull down a smile, until his commander refused to plunge back down. He merely swayed at the peak, keeping Kreek inside of him while grinning cruelly. An uneasy silence overpowered the thudding of earlier.

“What-why are you waiting?” 

The tremble in Kreek’s voice was obvious. It took all his focus to keep still. Meanwhile, his boss was staring deep into his eyes, even more gleeful than before. He seemed to know exactly what Kreek was thinking and basked in his frustration.

“Thrangul should not force anything upon his lovely-handsome bodyguard. He can see now; Kreek has no desire for him” adding a knowing coo at the end. 

Just as he was going to remove himself from Kreek’s dick completely, the stormvermin broke. For all his combat acumen, his willpower failed him.

“No-No! Kreek… Kreek was enjoying his…” 

“Kreek is too quiet! Speak up-up!” 

“Kreek wants to fuck Thrangul.” He said with a deadpan, slightly self-conscious quiver. 

Thrangul’s grin doubled in size. 

“Thrangul is a wizard-warlord! Kreek must have more enthusiasm than that!”

“The mightiest stormvermin wants to fuck-break his master!”

With that Kreek lost control, grabbing the wizard’s hips, and forcing him all the way to the root before Thrangul could reply. Gravity was powerful, but it paled in comparison to Kreek’s well-trained muscle. His devotion to exercise over the past month had left him stronger than ever before, and now he was free to abuse his might. Muted claps of fur on fur filled the room. Kreek thrust his hips off the throne, lowering Thrangul simultaneously. 

The mouse couldn’t think straight. His guts were straining to hold Kreek’s organ, but the feeling of fullness was sublime. Nerves he had never encountered before were blaring; Every organ in his body felt like it was shifting. Lubricating precum alleviated the pain, and what little remained acted as the perfect spice for the experience. Kreek’s dramatic, full-length thrusts were jabbing his prostate, drowning out all thoughts with flashes of pleasure. It was like his brain was reduced to fizzing chemicals.

At least at first. On the precipice of losing his mind to climax, Thrangul caught himself and clenched the base of his cock. The jolt of pain grounded him, reminding that he should be in charge. Luckily, Kreek’s expression was more muddled than his own. With straightened priorities, Thrangul’s eyes flashed green yet again and the bodyguard froze with his dick still impaled in the mouse.  

“Hunh! No! Wait! More! More-more!” rambled the soldier.

Kreek’s body was released, but only enough to withdraw the lowest few inches of his cock.

“Faster! Harder! Deep-deep! Yes-Yes!” purred the grey seer.

Thrangul’s ass contracted as tightly as when it was fresh. Without the immense amount of precum Kreek produced it would have been difficult to shift Thrangul at all. Heat and pressure consumed all of Kreek’s mind, like he was successfully topping molten iron that had congealed around his cock. His monarch’s innards were so tight that Kreek swore he saw throbbing veins on the swollen abdomen. The primal satisfaction of reshaping Thrangul’s ass in his dick’s image quickly wore the rest of his endurance away. 

Meanwhile, the wizard was examining Kreek’s chest. His cock was finally running along the abs and pectorals he had long desired. Even better, at half Kreek’s size, Thrangul could control him with nothing but biological magic. All those days of watching his bodyguard flex had culminated in this, and it was well worth the wait. Green precum had completely coated the stormvermin’s front, but more continued to splatter on. 

It wasn’t long before Kreek finished, but Thrangul wasn’t prepared. With a reverberating war howl, Kreek slammed his partner down, prodding just a bit further than before. Instincts overtook all reason. His mind was consumed by the thought of breeding a truly desirable partner, and Kreek's buried cock began to pulse like a heart. The emission was thick, viscous, hot, and heavy, but the volume impressed most of all. The depths of Thrangul’s narrow passage were spread open, as if the fluid itself was penetrating another foot of Thrangul’s ass. The flood journeying around bends to slather the deepest recesses his intestines. The second wave of cum pushed Thrangul over the edge.

The tiny wizard's senses were consumed by a numbing white bliss for nearly a minute. Warmth and fluid seemed to fill his entire chest, as if Kreek’s strength was pouring into him. His whole body went weak at the thought. For once in the mouse’s life there were no schemes in his head, only satisfaction. His body fell back, impaled on Kreek’s cock, arms and head hanging over the floor.

Thrangul’s dick also convulsed, firing off ropes of fluorescent emerald cum. Thick lines splattered his toy’s chest, adding opaque strokes to the canvas of pale, green pre. With the soldier arching his back, a few strands even splattered on his face, adding some color to the black fur. Even more landed on Thrangul’s front as his dick recoiled. 

When Kreek regained his focus, the wizard was already doting upon him, running his fingers through the luminous painting their bodies had become. Thrangul’s smile was soft now, genuinely happy, rather than expressing a hideous schadenfreude. 

Without incentive Kreek spoke first. “That. That was good. Very-very good. Does his excellence really want to keep-employ Kreek as his bodyguard?” 

“Of course! Thrangul has discovered an excellent partner-schemer! Thrangul was so worried that his lovely pet stormvermin had no confidence.”

Kreek began to pet Thrangul back, scratching him where his spine met his skull. From the shivers and croons, Kreek judged his cuddling to be successful.

Nervously, he spoke again “But Kreek tried to stab you,” blushing as he recalled the utter failure of an attack. 

The hideous smile returned, “If Kreek never tried to kill Thrangul, Thrangul would constantly be worried about when the betrayal would occur! Thrangul would never know if Kreek was a pathetic thing with no self-respect, or if he was constantly wait-plotting for the perfect moment. Now he knows you’re proud-strong! Truly skaven! Now Thrangul can trust Kreek!”

The stormvermin looked around awkwardly, continuing to pet his master, but ignoring his unstable gaze. 

Thrangul continued, “So Kreek… how shall we celebrate this event! Shall we attack the surface-things tomorrow?”

“Kreek would like that, but the vermintide continues to gather. Why not wait?” There was a brief pause as Kreek did a double take, “Wise-Seer Thrangul is asking lowly Kreek?” 

“Yes-Yes! Now we are scheme-plot accomplices! Thrangul needs a counterpart to test his ideas! And a body to fill his bed…”

The stormvermin shivered at the thought. It had never crossed his mind that he would be promoted to the highest levels of Skaven society. He was the partner to one of the council of thirteen. A concubine, but a trusted concubine none the less. There was only one proper way to celebrate the event.

“How about Thrangul and Kreek share a day together? No responsibilities.”

“Yes! Yes-Yes! Yes-Yes-YesYesYes! These ideas are why Thrangul treasures his handsome guard-toy! But why start tomorrow!” squeaked the grey seer.

Now Kreek was smiling back, but the grin was uncomfortably wide. Especially when Thrangul telekinetically called a bag of warpstone dust. The wizard began to cackle madly as he tasted it. With practiced efficiency, he poured out a line of glowing green dust onto his wrist, presenting it to Kreek with his usual frightening smile.

“Some warpstone dust-powder for the two of us! Then again! Yes-yes?”
