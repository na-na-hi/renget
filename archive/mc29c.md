##### `The Arrival of Autumn`
The warm days are nice.
BUT
The cool days/evenings of autumn mean you can cuddle together without gettting all hot and sweaty.

>Sitting on the back porch with your wifwolf waif on an autumn evening, just a few degrees above freezing
>somehow got stuffed inside her oversized hooddie with her
>warm and comfy, her heartbeat faintly felt on your back
>stars and moon above
>little fire in the pit
>roasting marshmallows and feeding them to eachother

>cool evening breeze coming through windows of bedroom
>curl into eachother and share warmth all night with just a sheet over the both of you
>wake up with the sun but laze about in the comfort of the bed for a while
>kisses and no shits given about morning breath
>eventually get up together and go to the kitchen
>cook breakfast together
>pancakes, eggs, and sausage
>spend an inordinate amount of time grooming your waif, gently running a brush over and through her entire pelt
>turns out mane and tail works on wifwolves too, she's actually shiny

>'tis the season for crock pot meals
>chilli
>chilli farts
>you're both about as mature as 7 year olds and your sides end up hurting from the laughing
