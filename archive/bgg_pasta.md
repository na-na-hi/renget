\>FAQ:
\>Q: Do I need to play the previous games?
\>A: No, but you should give them a try. If you don't feel like it, here's a summary of the events: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__GI7CrYnj8
\>Q: Why aren't my companion quests/romances advancing?
\>A: Companion quests and romances tend to advance after long resting. If your romance appears to be bricked, maybe you didn't long rest \enough.
\>Q: Can I recruit Minthara without going down the evil path?
\>A: If you don't pick sides and just proceed without completing the grove questline, yes. But you'll miss out on her romance.
\>Q: Is Durge essentially "Tav+"?
\>A: Yes. You get additional content, BUT there are points where if you've chosen to resist the Urge and/or don't complete quests the "right" \way, you'll have to pass additional checks to avoid losing companions.
\>Q: Are there any consequences to tadpolemaxxing?
\>A: [spoiler]No, you can consume as many tadpoles as you want without consequence. HOWEVER, if you consume the Astral-Touched Tadpole your face will become "veiny".[/spoiler]
