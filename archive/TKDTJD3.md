On Wednesday, the border base of the IRGC in Sistan and Baluchestan province (Iran) observed the readiness of a terrorist group planning to cross the borders of the Islamic Republic of Iran for carrying out another terrorist operation, similar to the terrorist attack in Rask, last month. 

In a preemptive operation against this terrorist group, the IRGC targeted their base and headquarters in the mountain heights of the region, kilometers away from populated areas. This approach is part of the inherent duties of the border forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran to counter any terrorist threat poised to occur against the people of Iran.
