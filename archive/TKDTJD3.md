‚ñ™Ô∏è O our nation, remember how harsh the 100 days are for our popular incubator in #Gaza, those who were displaced from their homes in this open country in light of the harsh winter and hunger, in addition to the aggression, massacres, demolition, and this brutal war.

‚ñ™Ô∏èOur enemy is shocked that the Mujahideen fighters have been patient in these underground tunnels all these months.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The difference between us and our enemy is our enemy. Every day he is involved in funerals for dozens of his dead and hundreds and thousands of wounded and disabled, in addition to the psychological defeat and the dispute between them was orchestrated, thanks to God Almighty, between the #Israeli leadership and the mini-cabinet and within the government and between the Zionist politicians and military personnel.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe criminal Zionist occupation is trying to head towards the north because it has run out of time and not because the Americans are asking it to reduce its performance in #Gaza, but it has nothing left to accomplish in #Gaza.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis occupation is also trying to open a new front and implicate the American administration in it in the north, and it is like one who is looking for a moment, but the more it goes, the deeper its crisis becomes.

‚ñ™Ô∏è I lived through past wars and this is an exceptional war.. I did not find anything in my brothers‚Äô messages indicating that they were tired or looking for a way out. The summary of their repeated messages full of faith, certainty and confidence in victory is: We are fine in the field. Check on us. Do not worry. Take care of the incubator of our great people who have given us everything from Patience and steadfastness.

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat you see on television screens and videos of the Qassam heroes from the field...this is the tip of the iceberg. They told us that not all of the mujahideen‚Äôs heroics can be filmed under these harsh conditions.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Yesterday we saw half a reserve battalion in the enemy army who refused to fight on #Gaza land, so we are fine and we are close to the end of this blessed battle.

‚ñ™Ô∏è We need jihad on the ground, jihad with money, with our lives, and with everything we possess, political, media, and popular jihad, and engaging in the battle in all its dimensions.

‚ñ™Ô∏è You, people of Jordan, my beloved ones, may God bless you, may God bless you; We are filled with what you are doing and how good your brothers are, hoping for more and more from you and from their nation.

‚ÄúSince brutal attack against Israel on Oct. 7 and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip, tensions and hostilities across the Middle East have reached fever pitch. And with such a complex regional crisis playing out, it should not come as a surprise that the Biden administration is reconsidering its military priorities in the region.

It should be cause for significant concern, however, that this could involve a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. While no definitive decision has been made to leave, four sources within the Defense and State departments said the White House is no longer invested in sustaining a mission that it perceives as unnecessary.

Active internal discussions are now underway to determine how and when a withdrawal may take place.‚Äù - the media wrote.
