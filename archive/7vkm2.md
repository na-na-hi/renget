She's late.
>I sighed, thinking out loud while waiting in front of the ornate stone gate leading to the bowels of the small, pines-covered hill. The late afternoon air had a sharp chill to it, making my tall frame shiver under the school robes I was wearing, as I didn't have time to change clothes after the last class of the day. I wasn't still sure why I accepted to explore my ancestors' ruined, gloomy home with that weird Ravenclaw student; after all I've never visited it myself, as I didn't expect to find much more than dusty books and possibly some bones. But saying no to a girl is never an easy thing, and she did promise me that cool, rare wand handle for my assistance. I wondered how much she knew about the works of my blood purity-obsessed ancestor, but I quickly disregarded the thought, admiring the sculpted snakes on the stone gate, waiting for her arrival.

>>The wind whipped my copper-colored hair around dramatically as I flew close to the ground, pushing my Night Weaver broomstick to its limits. I had wanted to double-check my research before setting out, having learned from my experience delving the tomb of Edraine the Egregious. I'm a Ravenclaw, after all - and knowledge was literally power in the hands of a wizard or witch.

>>It did mean I was -slightly- late, however.

>> I had stumbled upon mentions of a secret laboratory in a book I had sneaked from the Restricted Section, apparently loaded down with eldritch secret - something right up my alley. Then, imagine my surprise when I had learned that one of the Slytherins currently residing in the school was an ancestor of the former owner of that Laboratory.

>>It hadn't taken much to enlist his help, the offer of a rare wand handle I found in a secret passage (I suspected that it was an 'elf-tunnel' used by the Hose-Elves to move around the castle when disapparating wasn't the best option) connecting the Ravenclaw restrooms to the laundry room. It was a pretty thing, the handle, but I was more than happy with my 'saber' grip so I didn't mind parting with it too much.

>>Spotting my partner standing on a hillock, before a stone gate, I slowed down and coasted forward until I was pulling near to him, hopping off and shrinking my broom until it was the size of a match-stick before stuffing it away into my pocket.

Hey, sorry I'm late. Needed to double check something before I left the school.

>>I grinned and sorted my hair, righting Herodiana's cap on my head, as it had been buffeted out of place by the winds.

0

Better late than never.

>I replied contemptuously, though the comely look of the red-haired Ravenclaw, her face still flushed from her quick flight, could not be denied. I quickly disregarded such unseemly thoughts, and turned towards the stone gate. Remembering my old granduncle instructions, I placed my hand on the large snake head ornating the center of the gate. The charm woven into the stone instantly activated, upon recognizing the familiar, pure blood.

Lumos.

>I muttered, my wand instantly turning bright and illuminating the dark tunnel leading into the hill.

Follow me. By the way, do you know the story behind this place? The complete one, I mean?

>I asked her. I knew that some rumours about my famous ancestor, an accomplished alchemist turned dark wizard, could still be found in some libraries. But they referred only about his blood purity obsession, not about his...works, and goals.

0

>>Grimacing at the tone, I did my best to reply at my most friendly.

I only know what the book said, a hidden repository of secrets and knowledge. A Library and Laboratory where he performed his experiments. Given that he was a well-known Dark wizard, I imagine such work wasn't the most wholesome...

>>I silently flicked my wand and ignited the tip, casting pale rays into the gloom before us.

Any information you're willing to share would be appreciated. In my experiences, dealing with the protective enchantments of dead Dark wizards usually involves the screeching of inferius and a lot of fire.

0

Well...no, I wouldn't call it wholesome.

>I brushed a short, blonde fringe away from my forehead, my skin a bit sweaty from the peculiar nature of the topic at hand. Dusty, rotten libraries decorated the widening walls of the rocky tunnel, as we went deeper into the lair.

He was obsessed with maintaining blood purity, you see. He found the idea that his fellow pureblood wizards and witches would rather copulate with halfblood, or even mudblood, just appalling. So the rumours are that he, well, invited such unruly purebloods here for the purpose of...well, correcting them, and...well, making them-

>I stammered, as a large clearing opened up before us. White, trembling lights fired up around the opening; the secret lab, at last. But it didn't really look like a lab. More like some kind of ritual room. Small and circular, its walls were decorated by statues of half naked wizards and witches. In the center stood a stone slab, directly under a particularly intricate sculpture of gleaming, silvery snakes.

What in Merlin's beard…

0

>>I was disgusted by the tales of Jacob's ancestor, especially as a Half-Blood with a muggle father, so much so that I almost flinched when the lights suddenly turned on in their sconces, but instead I forced myself to take in all the Slytherin imagery, frowning in concentration, doing my best to listen for the shifting rumble of loosely packed earth that announced the arrival of giant spiders or inferi. When nothing immediately appeared, I did my best to ignore the décor and I raised my wand and swirled it overhead, golden wisps of magic gathering around its tip and then dispersing in a ring around us as I incanted...

Revelio!

0

>Nervous, I looked as Penny cast the revealing charm. Nothing happened again, until the spell finally revealed a small, gleaming silvery object on the stone slab, just under the intricate metallic snakes' nest sculpture that hanged over the slab. Possibly some kind of bracelet?

Maybe we should go away.

>I told my companion as she walked towards the slab, my tone this time less sharp, but urgent, as I readied my wand just in case.

0

Just a moment...

>>I let out a quiet hum, but I didn't want to touch that silvery object with my bare hands just yet, instead opting to remove my cap from my head and reach my arm into it, sinking in up to my elbow, then shoulder as I dug through the obviously expanded interior dimensions with an expression of concentration on my face, eventually removing one of my spare silver stirring rods, a straight cylindrical shaft roughly an inch thick, and nearly a foot and a half long. Replacing my cap, I stuck my wand behind my ear for a moment and threaded the stirring rod through bracelet. I looked over at Jacob, silently asking if he was okay with me removing the silver bracelet - it was technically his ancestor's after all…

0

Penny, I don't think that's a good idea...

>My voice died out, as the silvery bracelet, most likely charmed to be activated upon being removed from the slab, suddenly moved. It quite literally snaked around the stirring rod until it reached the witch's hand, before coiling lazily around her wrist.
>I took a heavy breath, as nothing happened after.

What did I tell you? Now, let's go befor-

>I stammered again, as now the elaborate sculpture above Penelope activated as well- several silvery, gleaming coils reaching for her before I could do so much as to lift my wand.

0

>>I gasped, dropping the stirring rod where it hit the slab with a clear ringing sound, pulling my hand back automatically, even as the silvery bracelet settled around my wrist, but I didn't have much time to pull my wand from behind my ear before those coils grabbed for me, holding my in place. I gasped, as they were strangely cold, and tried to struggle free.

>>Restrained as I was, I couldn't help by flashback to the tomb of Edraine the Egregious and I swallowed nervously.

Not again! Get me out of this thing!

0

>"Again"? I thought to myself, quickly dismissing my thoughts as I pointed my black lacquered wand to the tangle of snakes.

Petrificus tot-

>My cast was interrupted as a huge stone snake, the size of an anaconda, coiled around my leg, making me fall to the ground. As that happened, its maw opened, hissing as a steamy, pale gas released, quickly filling the room.

What..how...

>I murmured, suddenly feeling lightheaded, but not sick as I feared, expecting it to be some kind of noxious gas. On the contrary, my body started to feel quite warm despite the cool, damp air of the stone room.

Penny?

>I croaked, trying to get up as I turned my head to see how the Ravenclaw witch was faring. The cloud had reached her as the silver snakes effectively lifted her upon the slab, starting to coiling and snaking around her limbs. Some slightly thicker snakes, their oval heads polished and ribbed with scales, started snaking further, down inside her robes.

0

>>I did my best to struggle, but those strange vapors were wafting in my face, and I couldn't access my wand to perform a bubble-head charm...

>>The snakes wriggled under my short jacket, popping the clasps open and then one thinner one slid up from between my legs, burrowing under my leather vest before raising itself up like a cobra about to strike, ripping the lace holding it closed.

>My chest heaved, and I grimaced as that thinner snake prodded around my mouth, eventually wriggling passed my lips and working its way inside, causing me to choke at the sudden intrusion.

MMMPGH-Urkrrghk!!

>>Several more snakes slithered around my legs, pulling taut and forcing me to lay flat on the stone slab like a sacrificial offering…

0


>I watched as Penny struggled, some of the snakes starting to enter her in her different holes. I could see the bulge on her throat as the thinner snake slid in, her plush lips forced open by its silver, scaly body.

>I was supposed to be horrified, but the pheromone-rich gas was making me feel extremely light headed, and them some more. I could feel my shaft starting to pulse slightly, my ball sack distending as my face flushed.

P-penny...

>I whispered, as the stone snake uncoiled, letting me wobble slowly towards the slab in the middle of the room.

>The metallic, living snakes, on the other hand, were still busy at work; as Penelope was now mostly disrobed, two of the bigger ones were sliding freely further up her legs, their maws dripping some kind of strange liquid, its composition not dissimilar from the gas lingering in the room. Even the slimmer one in her mouth was spilling that concoction down her throat, forcing her to gulp it down.

0

>>Through the haze of unnatural arousal starting to build in my mind, I recognized that the gas, and the fluid gushing down my throat was some sort of magical aphrodisiac, and that it was well on its way to fulfilling its work. Laying naked except for my high-leather boots, my ensemble piled around me, my pale skin was flushed and my breasts were breaking out in gooseflesh, my nipples stiffening, pointing to the ceiling. The snakes around my legs held them open, my labia parting and dewy fluid starting to gather there, dripping out in shiny rivulets, making my thighs and the slick - though no snake had penetrated my quim or rear-end yet - and my pubic hair damp

>>My eyes rolled up, though with the heat my body was producing my half-moon spectacles were fogging up and then a thin serpent coiled around itself in front of my opening, making a circle before my slit, as though giving a goal to shoot for...

Urk-Urk-Urk-!!

>Wet slurps and gagging filled the chamber and I felt tears building in the corners of my eyes. I was just barely able to take the occasional breath, but I was already light-headed from the aphrodisiac and the lack of oxygen was making it harder to think.

0


>The bigger snake was prodding around the meaty lips of Penny's gash, its silver head now shiny with her juices coating it. It hissed, spilling pheremone-rich fluid, and with a smooth movement entered her, making her shudder violently.

>The second snake, slightly smaller, also rubbed slightly against Penelope's winking anus, its head snug between her soft cheeks. Soon enough it also started to push its way in, dripping fluid as her sphincter started to swallow the metallic reptile's length.

>I was now closing in to the slab, my member now almost as hard as the stone sculptures surrounding the room , its veins pulsing as my obscenely full ballsack dangled, my mind filled with a sole goal, to breed the witch on the slab.

>Smaller, slimmer snakes descended upon Penny, their tiny, dripping maws opening and nibbling, almost tenderly, around her hard, bright pink nipples, her shapely perky breasts trembling as she suffered- or better, enjoyed the ministrations of metallic serpents.

0

>>All the stimulation caused my back to arch, even as I let out a muffled groan around the snake fucking itself into my throat, my inner labia gripped at the textured surface of the silver serpent inside me, and the one in my ass was deeper than anything had ever been before besides, perhaps, the tendrils of the 'special' Devil's Snare from Edraine's tomb, then suddenly, without warning, my nipples started leaking milk for the first time in my entire life, several spurts fountaining upwards before slowing to a dribble that pooled beneath me on the altar - some strange effect of the fluid I was being forced to drink...

>>I let out mixed moans and sobs and a noticeable bulge appeared about halfway between my pelvis and my navel in the shape of the snake's head wriggling inside my passage, then the unthinkable happened and the that serpent opened its mouth and flicked its tongue out, tickling my very cervix itself, causing my toes to clench and unclench wildly, before that vibrating tongue slid into my uterus itself.

0

>I noticed the snake occupying Penny's mouth sliding away, its deposit done, and letting her free to moan and grunt loudly, as the other snakes continued their work on her, with their potent fertility fluids now dripping freely from all their maws.

>I could even see Penny's perky jugs dripping milk, as they kept getting stimulated by the smaller serpents, working tirelessly around her now oversensitive, bullet-shaped nipples.

>The thick silver serpent inside her sopping vulva continued prodding its ribbed, cold head against her cervix; the tongue, strangely softer and warmer, wriggled inside of it, spilling fluid and coating her insides with it, preparing them and her quivering, young body to an imminent, vital job- to be bred.

>After what felt like an eternity, I finally found myself looming over the slab, my body positioned in front of Penelope spread, pale legs. Most of the snakes started to slowly, almost tenderly exit her, with several of them still holding her still and keeping her well-stimulated.

0

>>As the serpent left my mouth, my jaw aching and my throat raw, I glanced towards Jacob, my breathing harsh.

J-Jacob...

>>My voice was raspy and harsh, but very quiet, almost breathy, and then I let out a grunt as the silvery snakes penetrating my pussy and ass slithered out, leaving my orifices gaped somewhat and leaking aphrodisiac, even as my whole body shivered, primed and ready to fuck...

P-Please... get me out of here...

>>I begged, but I knew it was a token resistance, and that whatever was about to happen was inevitable…

0

>I said nothing, my eyes glassy and stuck upon her pale, glistening body, as I shifted my robes and undid my breeches.

>I vaguely remembered to be decently endowed, but the grotesquely long and veiny shaft now hanging between my legs, was quite a different story. My distended balls ached for release, and I finally positioned myself between her legs.

>I rubbed my painfully sensitive glans between Penny's outer lips, swollen by arousal and glistening with slimy juices. I sighed as my frenulum rubbed against their soft, torrid skin, before I finally locked eyes with the helpess, fellow student.

Penny...I...

>Her face awakens a part of your conscience, as you stare at her deep blue eyes. Still, you don't move away, the silver snakes still holding her in place, the slimmer one gently coiling around her lactating breasts and slithering around her flat, pale tummy.

I...I need this. I need to be inside you.

>I groaned to you, almost pleading.

0

>>My eyes fluttered closed and I swallowed, getting an aftertaste of that aphrodisiac but then I nodded and sifted my hips as much as I was able to, pussy presented and ready for your engorged manhood.

>>It was hard to think, but I was almost positive that fulfilling the terms of the enchantments, having sex, was required to progress or retreat, much like casting crucio to seek Salazar Slytherin's secret scriptorium... Besides, the snakes had done their work almost too well, and the chemical cocktail sloshing around in and on my body, and the physical stimulation I had been subjected to had me more than ready for this and I found myself whispering,

D-do it... F-fuck me, Jacob…

0

>I nodded, panting heavily, as I finally started pushing my hips forward, gently but firmly, the urgency of breeding not completely contained. The heat and softness of your entrance made me grit my teeth, as I kept pushing my swollen member inside you, your meaty lips clinging around my veiny, pulsing length.

G-Gods, this is amazing...

>I grunted, as I placed my hands around your hips for support, your skin creamy and soft under my digits. I groaned as I slipped further in, my sensitive tip now almost reaching the place where the silver snake has recently been, with still some of my length left out.

>I started grinding my hips closer against you, as I bent over you, my face close to yours, your green eyes wide behind your foggy lenses, and your cheeks utterly flushed and almost the same colour of your hair spread around the slab.

0

>>I groaned as your cock spread my pussy, my rippled sleeve stretching to accommodate you, drawing you in, savoring the heat that came from a real cock, rather than magically animated silver, and when you grabbed my hips I clenched down as tight as I could, shifting my hips as much as I could to drag my walls around you.

Fffuck...~

>>I laid back, relaxing as much as I could against the altar. I was sure that when the effects of the aphrodisiac faded I would be concerned with how often I ended up in situations like this, fucked by a near-stranger after getting caught in a perverse magical trap, but for now, all I really wanted was to wrap my legs around you...

>As if sensing my submission, the snakes snaring my legs loosened and then slithered away, freeing me to do just that, slender legs encircling your waist and drawing you in as deep as physically possible, wide blunt head kissing against the back of my sweltering pussy, your pelvis grinding into my engorged clit.

Yess~

0

>I started panting hard as my lean body laid over yours, my hips now pumping steadily, your inner walls trying their best to fit my swollen cock in and massage it thoroughly.

>I couldn't believe what I was doing with the Ravenclaw student; one day ago I could barely stand that newly met, witty know-it-all, and now I was trying to breed her like my life depended on it.

>My thoughts left my quickly as I caught a glimpse of your bouncing, shapely breasts. My lips quickly latched around the stiff nipple, tasting your freshly released milk, as my veiny member manged to slide even deeper, finally bottoming in- with my engorged, sensitive glans rubbing against the spongy texture of your cervix.

T-this is too much. I'm..I'm getting...close. Nggh..
0

>>I nodded feverishly, letting out whimpers and straining groans, my chest heaving even as you drank my milk. My ribs were visible with how hard I was gasping and though I knew it was physically impossible you felt so deep inside me that it was like your cock was tickling the bottom of my heart.

>>Normally I hated blood-purists - they were literal ignoramuses so focused on the past that they misinterpreted the future. Willing to strangle the potential in their genes with repeated inbreeding, but right now, stuffed ful as I was, I didn't care that Jacob had looked at me with contempt not even an hour ago, only that he do his duty as a man and flood my body with his seed.

M-me too! Cum inside me! I need it~!

0

P-Penny...I..

>my voice broke, and I never finished that sentence. My swollen balls tightened, and my shaft throbbed painfully as it released the first rope of thick, warm seed against your cervix, splattering against it, inside it.

Oh G-G-Gods!!

>I moaned loudly, collapsing against your, my face nuzzled against your neck, my hands still clinging hard to your waist, kneading your flesh, keeping you still in a domineering way as I inseminated you.

>I grunted, as I stayed still, hilt inside as deep as I could in your spasming cunt, my cock pulsing regularly as it spurted what felt like an endless amount of potent semen in your welcoming depths.

0

>>Normally, it was hard to feel the actual semen when a man came inside me (the twitching, and extra burst of 'hardness' notwithstanding) unless, like now, he was under the effects of some strange magical aphrodisiac that made him shoot such thick spunk with such force that it felt like a hose letting loose inside me. My body shook with my own orgasm, lights popping in my eyes as I locked my legs around him using my ankles, thighs squeezing him as my spasming cunt milked his seed into the waiting reservoir nature blessed my gender with.

>>I let out keening groans, unable to form true words and I cradled his head to my chest, smearing milk and sweat and the remaining aphrodisiac between us.

>Soon though, my uterus ran out of space for his cum and it washed backwards, seeping around the shaft plugging my entrance, tripping down my thighs and rose-bud and pooling beneath my ass, a thick, sticky, slimy, glorious mess.

0

>Finally the throbbing stopped, and only the afterglow remained.

>I stayed still inside her for a few minutes more, the extra post-climax sensitivity preventing me from moving, her quim still weakly contracting around me, as Penny panted just as hard as me, trying to get her breath back.

>Finally, my head cleared, and the haze in the room gone -just as the serpents-, I slid out of her with a wet, soft sound.

W-well, that was something, Warwick.

>I cleared my throat, trying to regain my composure. But the tone in my voice, despite the aloof wording, was warm, and my eyes were smiling.

0

I'll say...

>I giggled headily and propped myself up on my shoulders, the movement forcing a fresh deluge of semen from my slightly bruised pussy, before I slid off the altar, bracing myself on the edge due to my weak knees,

>>Grabbing my wand, which had miraculously been held in place behind my ear by thick copper hair, I performed a complicated gesture and tapped the tip of my wand against my pelvis before dragging it down until it was just over my clit, forcing the remaining cum deep inside me to eject itself noisily, the goop splattering on the stone ground around my feet and protecting me from the unforeseen consequences of magically-induced lust.

I never saw that spell getting as much use as it has when my mother taught it to me, but I guess she knows best...

>>Shaking my head, I gather my clothes and cast a few charms to clean them and myself before I dressed, turning to you with a genuine smile and flushed cheeks as the whole situation had settled within my mind with the permanence of a stone - something to be fretted over later on in the privacy of the Room of Requirement.

Do you want me to clean you up too, Jacob?

0

>I shifted away from the altar too, the cold air of the stony room prickling my exposed flesh.

Y-yeah, mums always know best.

>I chuckled nervously, trying to be polite and not look at the ordeal, but being unable to do so, as my eyes followed every movement of her wand.

>As I heard her question, half distracted by her tossing her soft, coppery hair, I looked down at my own mess. My cock, luckily returned to its average size, was gleaming with a mix of our juices, slightly dribbling.

That would be...very kind, thank you.

0

>>I giggled and stepped closer, raising my wand when I suddenly dropped to my knees, my face even with your cock, close enough that my breath was ghosting over your sensitive flesh. I grabbed it by the base and raised it up, leaning in to kiss you on the the tip of your rod before I waved my wand and cast a gentle spell that quickly and efficiently cleaned away the cocktail of juices covering it. That done, I stood, kissed you on the cheek, and smiled teasingly.

So, do you think there's anything more to your ancestor's 'lab' than this Palace of Debauchery? Do you want to continue on, or shall we return to Hogwarts?

0

>I let out a contented sigh as I felt your soft lips on my over-sensitive tip, before the spell cleaned me up. A bit frustrated, but happy, I lifted my breeches back up, patted my robes and looked around warily.

I don't know. Do you think there's something more to this?
(on one hand, I want to continue, on the other it's quite late here and I don't know if other anons are okay with us taking all this space up. Then again, I was really tempted about switching to backdoor action on the altar part, and really want to explore that in the future)

0

>I sighed, as I noticed the insistence in your green (I remembered) eyes.

...I guess we can continue exploring it, yes. Just don't blame me if this kind of... stuff happens again.

>I added in an uncertain tone. I wasn't sure, after all, if I didn't want it to happen again. No one could deny that it felt good beyond belief, and that last kiss on my tip left me a bit flustered.

You lead the way, this time.

>I prompted you, gesturing torwards a narrow corridor sneaking further in the depths of the stony cave. As we approached it, weak white flames appeared on its dark, stony walls, and I could see how long and boring of a walk it was going to be.

0

>>I nodded and smiled reassuringly at you, patting you on your shoulder, and even though I had cast that special 'morning after' spell and cleaned the semen from my body I still felt loose and stretched out down there - 'well shagged out' as the muggles say.

It'll be fine. This was probably where your ancestor made Pureblood wizards copulate. I imagine it's probably the only place here with those enchantments. But who knows, maybe when we get out of here we can continue some sort of arrangement back at the castle - exams are right around the corner and stress relief will be important for us both. Let's continue on, eh?

>>That said, I swished my wand and once more cast a Revealing Charm and I saw a slight glow around a brick on the far wall. Walking over, I knelt down to get a better look, and could see that there was no mortar between that brick and the others, and that the stone itself was worn down slightly. Reaching out, I pressed on the brick which sank into the wall with a smooth click. There was a moment's silence and then that entire section of wall rumbled before, much like the entrance to Diagon Alley, the bricks started to move out of the way with dull clinking sounds until there was an opening wide enough for two wizards to step through abreast.

>>I hummed to myself and looked over at Jacob with a grin, flicking my wand overhead like a whip, I incanted...

Lumos Maxima!

>>and a pale light formed at the tip of my wand and the shot away, a small glowing orb that raced through the door, revealing a long dark hallway with arched ceilings that was lined with large vertical tubes, each filled with a strange greenish liquid that shone from underneath with a pale green light. I heard squeaking in the distance and straining my eyes showed rats scurrying around in the gloom.

0

>I watched with a frown as you knelt for a while, seemingly studying a brick. That's a Ravenclaw all right. Admiring a brick. I thought to myself, before you pressed it, activating the mechanism.

How...how did you..

>I blabbed, as you hummed and grinned at me before casting the enhanced light charm.

>The hallway seemed suspicious enough, especially with that liquid scurrying through the tubes; but I couldn't show cowardice as you walked surely ahead, so I followed you as you led the way, the light of your wand making your coppery hair shine with a brazen shade.

>My eyes then fell a bit down, captured by the swaying of your shapely hips under your robes, a part of your body that I had the pleasure of discovering not long ago, and that still made my member twitch a bit under my own robes.

>I shook my head, trying to disregard the thought, as I followed you in the damp, eerie corridor.

0

>>I was distracted by the tubes and the way that mysterious fluid burbled with bubbles of some sort.

I wonder that that is? Maybe this was where your ancestor stored the aphrodisiac that the silver snakes used on -

>>A wet splat made me jump and I twirled around, wand at the ready, to see a fleshy tendril, as thick around as my thigh, slap against the interior of one of the tubes before it slid down through the bottom of the tube, disappearing from view.

I-I guess these tubes all meet with a common reservoir somewhere else...

>>Swallowing nervously, I approached that tube, a shield charm on the tip of my tongue and glanced down to see that yes, there was no visible bottom to the tube, the glass seemingly sinking through the floor to places unknown, and I rubbed my chin murmuring,

Remarkable…

0

Remarkable?

>I repeated, concerned.

Penny, there's...something inside there.

>I said redundantly, as you were obviously quite distracted by the discovery. I looked around, the hallway empty: whatever creature was lurking around was inside in the tube system, and hopefully without the possibility of escaping it.

>I put an hand on your shoulder, turning and forcing you to look at me.

What are we looking for exactly here? Do you know how risky this could be?

>I said hoarsely, a bit scared and a bit frustrated

0

>>I blinked, surprised, but then I laid the hand not holding my wand on one of Jacobs and smiled.

You said it yourself. That creature is in the tube system. I imagine there's a charm on the glass to make it unbreakable if that fleshy thing hasn't managed to smash it.

>>I leaned up on my tippy toes to kiss your cheek, ruffling a hand through your blonde hair.

It's fine. I'm the leader of the Hogwarts Expeditionary Guild for a reason. I live for these kinds of situations. Besides, this place was built by -your- ancestor. Can you honestly tell me you're not the least bit intrigued by what we could find down here? I imagine there's all sorts of books on potions, alchemy, and complex enchantments and charms in here, not to mention strange relics!

>>The fervor of possibly gaining new knowledge was shining in my bright green eyes - Ravenclaw indeed.

0

I...I supposed I am.

>deep down, the strive for power was not a an unknown feeling for me; the idea was starting to feel tempting in your mind. Inheriting my ancestor's knowledge...but I still needed more convincing.

>just the feeling of your lips on my cheek made me gulp, my member tenting a bit under my robes, I didn't know how noticeably. Surely this was a remainder of the effects of the pheromone-rich miasma and fluids we've encountered before; its effect on my, well, size gone, but definitely lingering in my mind.

0

>With how close I was to you, I most definitely felt you twitch against me and I smiled coyly. I could work with that.

How about this... You help me fully delve this place, learn its secrets, and I'll... be yours one night a week for the rest of term. Anywhere, anytime, -ANYTHING- you want to do to me - so long as it doesn't impact my classwork or grades.

>I didn't need to think much about it. A pretty, smart, tight girl to give me relief once a week whenever I needed it? At the moment, excited as I was, it seemed quite the reward, for a small price such as exploring some dusty, potentially lethal dark ruins.

I...fine. We can keep explore my family's dungeon. But first...

>I added, now in a low, husky voice.

I think I need a taste of that reward.

>I whispered in your ear, as my hands grabbed your hips firmly, pulling your body tightly against mine, to let you feel how hard I was in that moment.

>I giggled, pressing into you and kissing up your neck and nipping at your jawline to whisper in your ear, lips ghosting over your earlobe.

After everything we just did you still want more? Very well. Consider this a down payment on my end of the bargain - you Slytherin's love bargains, yes? Now, what do you command of me, Jacob?

urn around.

>I simply said. I watched as you grinned and turned, bending against the stone, cold wall. I took in the sight of your shapely rear, smiling excitedly, the previous vapors still somehow clouding my mind

>I slid down your pants, the cheeks of your butt jiggling as I freed them from their fabric prison. I knelt as I finally pulled down your panties, your privates fully revealed to me.

>I could see your holes winking ever so slightly, you quim still a bit bruised from our previous encounter.

Does is hurt?

>I asked, before gently blowing some tepid air against it.

>>I enjoyed the man-handling a bit, feeling a perverse thrill at being 'used' to sate someone else's desires. Maybe it was the residual effects of the aphrodisiac, or maybe all the experiences I've had since losing my virginity was simply turning me into a pervert, but then you blew across my heated, sore pussy and for now I put those thoughts to bed.

It's a good sore. The serpent and your cock did its work quite well, I'll have you know, of loosening my up for the moment. I'll tighten back up eventually, though, once I heal up down there.

>I grinned at her forwardness, quite enjoying it. Her soreness was not in small part due to my previous attentions, and I absurdly felt a bit guilty for a moment, before disregarding the feeling just as quickly.

...let me make it up for you, a bit.

>I murmured, before planting a wet kiss against your soft, puffy outer lips. The low sigh I heard prompted me to keep kissing it, the reddish pubes tickling my chin as I started using my lips and tongue more passionately, tasting more of you as my saliva dribbled through your labia.

>I kept my hand around your creamy soft buttocks as I focused on your cunt, before noticing your winking anus.

>Grinning, I lifted my face up just a bit, before prodding the tender ring with my slimy tongue

0
>>I couldn't help but moan at the tongue wriggling through my sore folds, but when you moved onto my ass I let out a yelp and subconsciously pushed my ass closer to you, wanting deeper, harder contact, my hands clenching into fists at the slimy feeling. A jolt of warmth lit in my stomach and I pressed my forehead against the stone wall, my eyes fluttering closed as I let out a heady, but not at all displeased giggle.

E-fffuck~ So it's my a-arse you want a crack at?

I don't hear you complaining...

>I replied as I briefly stopped, before returning to my work. My hands spread your plump cheeks nice and wide, making your tight ring a bit larger and allowing the intrusion of my tongue inside it.

Mmmh..

>I pushed my slimy appendage as deep as I could, feeling the tightness of your sphincter muscles around it, making sure to lube your ass as much as I could with my warm saliva.

>I groaned with my mouth pressed hard against your crack, as my cock started throbbing wildly and needy.

Oohh~ I'll never complain about this...

>>The first time I had anal, neither me nor my partner knew what we were doing, though later attempts were much better and revealed a liking for sodomy that I hadn't expected, but Jacob seemed used to this and I wondered just how many witches he's buggered.

Y-you're pretty good at this...

>I said, my hips twitching and my pussy clenching at the thought of what was coming (and cumming) to me.

You would be surprised at the stuff that happens in the Slytherins dungeon.

>I replied cryptically, before judging your anus lubed and tender enough.

>I gave it a sloppy kiss, before rising to my feet, and quickly undoing my robes and breeches.

>my warm hands kneaded hard around your round bottom. I leaned against you, my face at the side of yours. I could smell your sweet hair and your sweat, a combination of scents that did nothing but make me throb even harder.

Ready for it?

>I whispered in your ear, before gently nibbling your lobe.

>I pointed my pulsing, veiny cock directly against your now spasming sphincter, and firmly pressed my engorged head against the tender ring.

0

>>I grinned, my head still bowed, and I automatically arched my back to give a better angle, timing my breathing low and slow so I wouldn't subconsciously clench up and make the penetration more difficult than it needed to be, before whispering only two words.

Do it~

>I pushed, hard, not as gently as I should have done, but the urgency to get inside your arse prevailing over me.

>My tip, after little resistance, slid right in your rosebud, the rest of my shaft soon swallowed as well under the pressure of my thrusting hips.

D-Damn.

>I groaned, feeling how hot it felt. After the tightness of the entrance, it felt soft, just as good in a different way

0

>>I breathed out as your tip pressed in - a little known secret to anal sex was exhalation made the penetration easier, but it was still enough to make me let out a little yelp as your tip popped passed my ring and started sinking in deeper. I held still. With my pants down, my white shirt was draped partly over my ass, like the veil of a harem-girl, the fabric tickling the top of your cock before it slid inside my the tight depths of my back-door. My body shivered, and gooseflesh was crawling up my bare legs from where my trousers were crumpled at my ankles.

Fuck, Jacob~ Y-you sure your cock is back to normal? That feels big~

0

>I grinned at the comment.

I'm glad it does~

>I grunted, before starting to finally thrust rhythmically. My hands shifted from your hips, now grabbing against your chest, still covered by your shirt. Nonetheless, I could still feel the hard nipples under the fabric, and I clutched at your perky breasts, my fingers pinching the stiff, sensitive nubs, feeling your ring clenching harder at my base as I did so.

>>I felt my eyes start to twitch in response to that perfect mixture of pain and pleasure, the discomfort of having a hard cock up my arse, mixed with the thrill and 'shame' of being such a naughty witch was heightening the pleasure. Jacob was sawing himself into my ass, my ring gripping him every time pulled back, the vacuum-like suction produced by the motion pulling him back in.

>>I felt his hands on my breasts - I had always been nervous about their size, but the way his fingers seemed to completely envelop them made me feel small and 'defeated', in a certain way that felt good, rather than annoying, Almost like in this moment at least, he had somehow 'conquered' me.

Unghh~unff~fuuck~

>>My breath hitched on every deep thrust into my guts and I couldn't help by close my eyes to savor the experience, my entire body starting to rock in time with the buggering.

0

>the moaning and whimpering from you only made me thrust harder. The sound of flesh slapping against flesh filled the hallway, as my thrust became more urgent and deep.

>at this point, the only goal in my dizzy, still altered mind was using your ass, your body, you, to achieve my ultimate pleasure.

>the feeling of your asshole gripping my base, almost pulling me back in everytime I slid out, the warmth of your insides, combined with your moaning, quivering body I was clinging and holding so desperately, quickly sent me over the edge.

Nnnnghhh...

>without saying anything but a loud, final grunt, I hilted myself in you, my hips slamming against your soft asscheeks, as my member pulsated harshly and started flooding your guts with my warm, thick seed.

>>The feeling of Jacob's animalistic lust filled my mind, like it was a cock fucking my brain, and did my best to hold on - trying to prevent my own orgasm for as long as possible. I hadn't realized when I worded our bargain that what I was doing was essentially prostitution, trading my body, my dignity, my 'services' for aid in a bit of dungeon delving. I felt like one of those failures of a witch that skulked around places like Knockturn Alley making money on their backs or knees...

>>And in that moment, I realized that I LOVED it.

>>I felt Jacob hilt himself inside of me and felt him start to twitch and I let my own pleasure go, a knot of happiness unraveling in my gut. My knees nearly gave out as my climax ripped through me, my arse spasming around Jacob's cock. My thighs were once more slick with my arousal and the spunk that dribbled around his shaft and passed my ring.

I'm such a slut~

>>I moaned/whispered, sounding for all the world like a happy drunk, full of cum and once more sated.

Yes...you are.

>I whispered back in your ear, not without a certain warmth in my tone, my breath still heavy as I was panting against your pale neck, not ready yet to dislodge myself from you.

>Finally, I slid out of you, globs of thick seed escaping your gaping hole as your body shuddered, panting just as heavily as I did.

>I contemplated the ordeal for a moment, catching my breath.

That was...it was...well, let's just say we have a deal, Penny.
