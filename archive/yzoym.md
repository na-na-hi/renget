>He's so much unlike me

>No, it's probably wishful thinking

>But I'm still shy
>He asks to talk to me one on one
>Kami, I probably look like a tomato
>He tells me he can speak Japanese fluently, but he has trouble with written Japanese
>He wants me to help him learn
>I almost have a heart attack
>Alone with him
>In close quarters
>Probably touching each other
>Part of me wants to refuse
>But he doesn't deserve bad grades
>Alright, I'll bite the bullet
>"As you Americans say, 'no probrem'"
>Crap, I forgot the L-R thing!
>He probably thinks I'm an idiot!
>He laughs

>It's a sympathetic one
>"Looks like we have something in common"
>You could probably fry an egg on my face
>Still, at least I have a chance to help him
>...Who knows what that might lead to?
