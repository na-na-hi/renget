**2** paste it in an embed 
**3** ctrl+f or find in page and type `div id="float"`, beside it is an closing tag `</div>` right?
**4** between that div, put `<img src="image link" width="50%">` or just `<img src="image link">`
**5** and between the quotation marks, paste your image link there

-> format should be like this <-
->`<div id="float"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ogMK3ZO.jpeg" width="50%"></div>`<-
