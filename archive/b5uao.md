Summer...

Summer is finally here but Kel's poor planning skills have screwed him over yet again, now he is every parent's worst nightmare, a kid with free time and nothing to do

Truly a fate worst than dead... for those around him

After playing a few rounds with Hero. the cards became boring for the hyperactive kid. Was this truly the best he can think of on such a lovely day? a card game in their bedroom like convicts, they don't even have a harmonica for Pete's sake!

As usual, the answer was yes, but Hero had a simple idea that may fix the dire situation.
Bored out of his mind he asked "wanna go to the park?"
"DO I?!!" Kel bountiful energy could finally be spent on another thing that his hands, without losing a moment the personification of a hurricane got up and rushed to the main door at a speed that made Hermes blush
"W-Wait up Kel, geez.... where are my shoes?" scanning the room Hero prepared as fast as he could, today was gonna be a busy day as usual

"Cmon slowpoke we losing sunlight over here" Kel looked at his nonexisting watch trying to imitate what he watched in the movies, rather quickly, Henry descended from the stairs
“Get some water bottle, I don’t have that much money left”
“Way ahead of you bro” Kel throws a can to his brother, which gave him a look of absolute disappointment hitting him like a wet towel in the face “I was donating you my orange joe to save you from the boringness of water! geez”
Softening up, Hero expression became more friendly “I going to take the boring option them”
“Fine” Kel confiscated the can from such an unenlightened individual and gave him his water “but don’t come back crying when you miss the power of orange and coffee!”
“I keep that in mind”
Opening the door the little troublemaker got quite the idea “Mmmmm… Hero you have your running shoes on?”
“I don’t ha—“
“Race you to the park” like a madman running from his wrangler, the younger brother sprinted ahead
“Hey! No fair” the older brother started running as well

------------------------------------------

*Where did he go?* taking another sip from his can Kel waited next to the vending machines for his brother, he was fast but Hero was taking his sweat time, the question if he was too fast or hero too slow was still up in the air *maybe both?*

Eventually, a blue and red figure was visible at the distance, jogging at a snail’s pace while fighting for air as he gets closer to the finish line
Kel taunting victor's speech was mentally canceled when he look the state of his brother “d-doing alright bro?

Hero just got enough energy to give a thumbs up, before collapsing face-first to the ground

“Henry!” the sporty boy ran to his brother side grabbing his bottle in one swift motion “what the? You drank all already?, we are not that far away from the park, no, wait we are in Faraway but the park is not…. But it is..” the semantic discussion was cut shot for the loud huffing sounds Hemry was doing “shoot, alright plan b it is then” Kel flipped his brother so he could breathe easier

Kel was about to make his brother drink his orange joe but a meek hand try to prevent such fate

“Look is this or dead” after some soul searching Henry accepter the cursed beverage, his body fighting like we were drinking the strongest poison known to mankind
“*huff*on second *huff* thought *huff* I should have chosen dead*huff*”
“Don’t be like that, we are orange pals now”
"Never*huff* again *huff*

Searching in his pocket, Hero gave some money to his brother “colasy *huff* please”
“don’t you want a nurse pop instead?”
“*huff* anything but *huff* joe’s again”
“Rude” grabbing the money Kel rushed to the machine, only coming back when he had two cans in hand “okay open wide” Hero raised his torso so we wouldn’t choke in cheap cola

Stabilized, Hero and Kel decided to chill there, backs landing in the fence around the park sitting, in the part that wasn’t burning cement

The question of what to do this summer was yet again in their mind

“I think I will learn how to play chess, you know it helps to learn critical thinking and long-term planning? We could both got in a group and learn together”
“Pass, I want to play some sport this summer or maybe just explore the forest, anything to no be indoors like in school days“
Henry made a little smile “you still have no idea of what you want to do this summer don’t you?”
“AAAAAA there too many options” Kel scratched his head in desperation “basket, softball, football…”
“We are in the first week yet, no needs to rush thing Kel, good thing come for those who wait!”
“you are right… I didn’t expect this second orange joe can but here we are” the younger boy proclaimed happily raising his can

“…? Wait a minute, where do you get that?”
“you give me 5$ and your’s only cost 3$”
a more stern look was present in the older brother “you own me a dollar”
“make it two” Kel rushed to the vending machine once more
“Oh son of a….”

----------------

At long last, the brother made their way into the park, just a tiny little pro--- it was full, it was absolutely full, turn out summer days and parks are a natural combo in peoples minds

Swings, sliders, pretty much all the benches, the right part of the park may as well be closed from how many persons are there...

Poor Kel sighed at the shattering of his summer hope of a fun day in the park, however, Hero came pretty quickly with a plan

"Tag!" Hero shoved Kel to the ground and started jogging in the opposite direction, at best he hoped to find a nice tree to laze around while Kel tries to catch him

"Oh, now you have done it! hehe" Kel started to run like a hungry cheetah with a rocket in his back but he stopped

A boy is about to throw a baseball but Kel doesn't see him, his gaze is looked at the batter striking a perfect pose while reading her bat, her eyes filled with determination but something more, that is making him unable to look anywhere else

Kel is dumbfounded at such a scene, a choir of angels cloud his mind as he looks at her hitting the ball in slow motion, such technique, such finest, such beu--
a fast baseball approaching?

a fast baseball approaching?!?



oh oh...


With a blurry vision, he hit the ground cold
