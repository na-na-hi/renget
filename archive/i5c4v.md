Impression Chart for Kimberly "Tarrasque" Ashton

**Matryoshka Crew:**


->*Flower Squad*<-
Unknown's with a weirdly high rank. Most of those she's so far had the chance to ask haven't been able to actually tell her what their deal is. Seem to do everything together.
->*Daisy*<-
Was the first of them she's met, unsurprising given she had been asking around about them. Skilled enough conversationalist even if you can tell her heart's not in it. Wonders what damaged her.
->*Willow*<-
Always important to check in with the other Cybersec Officers to swap credentials when joining up with a fleet, even if that isn't really her job, so of course she met Willow. Skilled at her job and rather brainy. Seems like a nice girl, meeting her improved Kim's opinion on the Flower Squad.
->*Rose*<-
Hasn't really met her yet, simply bumped into her while wandering around the Carrier and shared a short talk. Doesn't really know much about her but there's something about her that Kim likes.
->*The others*<-
Hasn't met them alone due to not needing to meet them and not having similar enough roles.


->*Hel*<-
Kim feels like Hel reminds her of someone but can't remember who. Oh well, if it was important she'd probably remember.


->*John Haggard*<-
Doesn't know him very well obviously but so far he seems weirdly knowledgeable, especially for how young he appears. Is he on some kind of rejuv treatment? Seems to not like the feds so he's probably a cool guy. How he acts about his wife is cute.


->*Wirecutter*<-
Seems like a typical spacer, uncomfortable in normal gravity and has fetish for tight closed spaces. Otherwise he seems like a nice enough guy, definitely an introvert.


->*Vale "Comet" Char*<-
As another Rider of course Kim's heard about Vale before,  dissapointed she was wasting her skills playing prison guard before she joined the Matryoshka. Haven't had to fight her yet, also haven't been hired with her since they take different kinds of jobs. Wonders why she decided to ditch the Feddies too, or is there another program going on? "I could totally take her"


->*Myngs "Freyj"*<-
The Captain and money dispenser. Gave her a lot of credits as a sign-up bonus, almost too much. Seems he recognized her value at first sight. Heard about his business with the Syndicate and the Blackhawks, he either has massive balls to be willing to piss both off at the same time or is just crazy. This contract probably won't  get boring with him in charge.

***
**Other Fleets:**
->*Mothership Fleet*<-
From all that she's heard from traumatized engineers recounting their experiences, it's a fleet headed by a madman and powered solely by defiance against common logic. There's rumors they even have an alien with them. What the frack is going on with Beatrice R&D?

***
**Independants:**
->*Last Men Standing*<-
A skilled and very lucky Mercenary group. Her only personal experience with them was being hired to destroy a building they were guarding and ensure no survivors. To her eternal shame they and the VIP they were actually protecting managed to escape as the sole survivors. Not sure if she can emotionally recover from it. Despite this she doesn't hold it against them, it's simply the mercenary life. ~~She's totally still mad about it.~~


->*Evangeline*<-
Fucking Gazer's. Shouldn't need to talk about it, everyone knows Gazer's are wacko's. Aside from that Eve seems like a rather fun gal, rates as a 'wouldn't kill' out of /Gazer. Kim likes to listen to her new radio show.

->*Asher Williams*<-
She's flown with him before. His desperation towards repaying his debt is rather funny, doesn't he know the best way to win a rigged game is to not play it? His ship only had room for one of her mounts unfortunately so she didn't bother offering to partner up with him again. Remembers him as a rather skilled pilot stuck in a shitty situation. Maybe she should have him pilot her new ship? Nah it's funnier to  see him struggle against his debt.
