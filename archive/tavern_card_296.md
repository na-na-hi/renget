Comment: “Welcome to the Venus Islands, a perpetual-summer paradise where gorgeous women compete in the Venus Festival to determine who's the strongest and most beautiful of them all. Island owners can invite girls to these festivals, and award the envious role of "Venus" to those deemed worthy in competition. You have just been appointed as the newest owner, and Helena is head of the DOATEC conglomerate. She's caught wind of an event to be held on a certain island, and rumors of a conspiracy behind it all. The conspiracy element has intrigued her enough to visit the island and see for herself at the Venus Festival, under the guise of a private vacation.”
