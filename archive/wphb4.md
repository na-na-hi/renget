#->Karaoke and Kisses<-
->Chapter 2<-


Somewhere in the back of Kiara’s mind, she was aware that the lights were still on, the bedroom door was open, her not-quite-in-her-budget hotel room was going unused, Reine’s pants were still around her knees, and, most unacceptably, her own pants remained on. Perhaps if she was thinking more logically, Kiara could have addressed these issues. Reine’s cats could come barging in at any moment, and the idea of breaking in the hotel bed with Reine had a certain spice to it. Any hopes of these thoughts making their way to Kiara’s higher conscience were quickly dashed when Reine slid her tongue around the lower side of Kiara’s. A deep moan emanated out of Kiara’s throat. All rational thought was replaced by pure emotion, and a burning need for the Peafowl on top of her.

When she first arrived in Indonesia, Kiara hoped she would be able to have some hearts to hearts with Reine, as well as plenty of skinship. She felt a connection and easiness with Reine that was impossible to replicate, and looked forward to spending time in her company. She was also always ready to respond physically, though things usually never escalated beyond some light petting and hand holding. She was aware of the sexual tension they both felt in the Maldives; spending a week in the same bed as someone gets thoughts racing, and the few wandering hands she felt from Reine then kept those thoughts in high gear. The fact that Reine was currently grinding her leg into Kiara’s crotch proved her suspicions. But it was their recent reunion in Japan that really made Kiara look forward to this.

After an initial miscommunication, Kiara and Reine managed to schedule out a few nights they could spend together with the other girls. And while both of their separate vacations were fun and fulfilling, it wasn’t until they saw each other again outside of the karaoke bar that they realized how much they missed each other. It was as if they suddenly remembered a part of themselves had disappeared, and the moment they were in each other's arms again they realized they hadn’t felt whole in months. Their first hug in Japan was like an explosion of memory, the physical contact sparking emotional discoveries in the two women. 

Laying on the bed, Kiara’s arms snaked their way down Reine’s back from their perch behind her neck. Reine’s back felt soft and smooth, yet belied the tense knots in her muscles. The stress had not affected her physical beauty, but Kiara knew the emotional weight Reine must have carried. Kiara made short work of the hooks in Reine’s bra, letting the straps hang loose off her sides. It was only their bodies being tightly pressed together that kept Reine’s breasts from being free and at Kiara’s mercy. A slow drag of one of her fingers down Reine’s spine gave Kiara the reaction she wanted. Reine shivered with pleasure, but never separated her lips from Kiara’s, maintaining a steady assault of kisses.

Spurred on by Kiara’s electrifying touch, Reine pressed her groin deeper in Kiara’s, slowly making rocking motions with her hips. She was guided by instinct and want. She hadn’t meant to start humping Kiara, but she made no effort to stop. If she was in control of her senses, Reine would have been mortified to see her actions. But intoxicated by kisses and the feeling of Kiara’s bare skin on her’s, Reine felt no embarrassment. 
 
It was so much, an outright assault on Reine’s synapses, every neuron firing off everytime Kiara touched her back or Reine tightened her hold on her. But it wasn’t enough.

Light headed from the rush of emotion and lack of oxygen, Reine finally pulled her head up from Kiara, breaking the extended kiss and propping herself over the Phoenix. A throaty inhale and string of saliva added to the eroticism of the scene. Reine could hardly believe what was in front of her. How was this real? How was this happening? She had never felt so horny, her blood had never run so hot. She felt powerful, and Kiara was a personification of sex below her, willing and ready for whatever perverse acts Reine could imagine. 

Her orange and teal hair was blown back against the bed in an erogenous halo, her locks sticking to her sweat drenched forehead. Panting, Reine’s eyes followed the beads of sweat from Kiara’s crown down her face to her neck and collarbone. The perspiration danced on Kiara’s skin with an appetizing shine, and as Reine continued down the trail of sweat to Kiara’s breasts she had a desire to lick her clean. The only thing in the way was Kiara’s teal colored bra, with Reine’s black one lying on top of it.

“Eh?” Reine looked at her detached bra in confusion, “When did that-?”

Kiara giggled at Reine’s reaction. “I’m quite good with my hands, you know.” 

Kiara bit her lip in equal parts amusement and lust. Reine’s eyes were on Kiara’s gleeful face, but Kiara was staring at Reine’s exposed and hardened nipples. 

“Here’s another example.”      

Kiara quickly grabbed Reine’s right breast from below, slightly lifting it up to appreciate its weight and shape. Before Reine could finish gasping Kiara had the nipple between her index finger and thumb, idly massaging the breast with her hand as she tweaked and rolled the pink nub. Reine’s eyes and mouth opened widely in shock and pleasure, but Kiara wore a smug satisfied grin. She could tell Reine needed this, and she was happy to give it to her.

“K-Kiara, that f-feels really good,” Reine was able to force out in a breathless voice. 

Reine seemed so innocent, so honest. Kiara had hardly started and Reine already felt like puddy in her hands. As she played with her breast, Kiara’s other hand stroked Reine’s rear, feeling up her toned butt and upper legs. Reine was so tall, and her legs felt endless in Kiara’s hand. Kiara had always loved to look at Reine’s legs, whether they were in an elegant dress, tight pants, hot shorts, or a swimsuit. Never satisfied, Kiara next wanted to see them in nothing at all, wrapped around her head. It was time to escalate.

“I know that feels good, baby. Let me make you feel even better.” 

Kiara accentuated her promise by roughly squeezing Reine’s butt and pinching her nipple. The excited squeal was music to her ears. Kiara lifted her torso up to bring her mouth to Reine’s chest. Reine watched in anticipation as Kiara left a string of kisses from the center of her chest straight down to the middle of her cleavage. Kiara buried her face between Reine’s boobs, slightly pushing her right boob towards her face to better smother herself. 

“O-oh my!” 

Kiara had not slowed her groping, and brought her other hand up to gain two handfuls of Reine. Both breasts now in her grasp, Kiara left little kisses, bites, and licks on both sides. Hearing Reine’s unsteady breathing, she decided to go in for the kill. With Reine’s right nipple still secure in her fingers, Kiara slid her tongue towards the center of Reine’s left breast, elongating her trip with a loop around the center, until finally sucking onto Reine’s sensitive spot. The drawn out moan from behind Reine’s closely pressed lips told Kiara she hit her mark.

Thinking of the intense French kissing from earlier, Kiara made quick but measured circles around Reine’s nipple, being sure to flick it with her tongue at irregular intervals to keep Reine guessing and wanting more. She wanted to match the vigor Reine had shown earlier, but in a more delicate place. She liked when Reine took control, but she wanted to have her fun too.

Reine had forgotten she had been taking the lead in their dance. Kiara was sucking on her tit, and was making her feel better than she’d felt in years. Every nerve ending in her chest was on fire, and the warm glow in her lower stomach was becoming noticeable.

“Mmmm, yes, yes, yes, Kiara…” Reine moaned, her face flushed and eyes in heart shapes. Kiara glanced up to make eye contact with her prey, lips still secured around Reine’s nipple. The face of ecstasy Reine made caused Kiara to open her mouth in a smile. Her hold on the nipple interrupted, Kiara quickly flicked her tongue several times on Reine’s button.

The button was pressed.

With an unconcealed moan Reine shot backwards in response to the overwhelming surge of pleasure that raced through her. She knew her nipples were sensitive, but not that sensitive. What had Kiara done to her? Was she really that easy to please?

Kiara was slightly concerned with the sudden change in position and after confirming Reine wasn’t hurt or getting cold feet asked, “I knew you’d like that. Did you seriously come just from me playing with your nipples?”

“No! I mean, I don’t think so, not completely...”

Reine’s denial turned confession only earned another self-satisfied laugh from Kiara. No longer tangled, the two women both sat up on their knees to take stock of their situation. Kiara put a hand on Reine’s cheek.

“Well, I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to stop there. And from the way you’re quivering, I don’t think you want to stop either. Am I wrong?”

Reine felt the comforting presence of Kiara’s hand. Her body felt so hot, and her brain felt like it was firing on all cylinders, but the simple hand on her refocused all her attention. Kiara was right. She did want more. And she wanted to give back too.

“I’m not stopping,” Reine stated with confidence. “And I want to keep going until you beg me to stop.” 

Normally Reine would be surprised by her own confidence, but Kiara was pushing her to be stronger and braver. She made her feel sexy, and made her want to go all the way. She hoped that message was contained in her grin.

“My my my, aren’t you a little minx. But that’s big talk for a girl with her pants bunched up around her knees.”

Kiara’s comeback was equal parts flirty and cutting. Reine looked down to her legs, where sure enough her pants had never finished being removed. With a surprised “Mep!” Reine sat back to hurriedly try to peel them off. Doing so exposed the profile of her body to Kiara, allowing her to see the length of her legs, her naked torso in a sit-up position, putting her stomach and breasts in a new focus, and her cutely determined and embarrassed face. It also allowed Kiara to see just how much darker the center of Reine’s panties had gotten from the rest of the fabric. She knew Reine was excited, but it was nice to see proof.

Reine struggled to get the tight pant leg off her ankle and over her foot. She liked the way these pants complimented her figure and hugged her curves, but right now she was cursing her sense of fashion. She had wanted to look her best for her day out with Kiara, but that came with a price. 

“This..is why…I always…wear…shorts…!” Reine articulated with futile tugs at her pants. Kiara noted the increasing frenzy Reine was applying to her pulls, and was worried she might tear right through the pants to get them off.

“Here, let me help you.” While Reine was struggling with her pants. Kiara had taken the time to remove her own pants. The heat of the moment had not unaffected Kiara, and her skin felt contained by the borrowed clothes she was wearing. She leaned forward onto all fours in only her underwear between Reine’s legs . She made sure to accentuate her bosom with her arms and purse her lips at Reine, not that she needed any help getting more turned on.
Reine permitted Kiara to take over once more. Reine moved her hands behind to prop herself up, watching Kiara’s boobs slightly jiggle in her bra as she crawled nearer. Kiara stopped with her head between Reine’s knees, and as she slid two hands down Reine’s calf to grip the pant leg, she left small kisses up Reine’s legs from her feet to her thighs, never breaking eye contact. Kiara’s half-lidded eyes conveyed her intentions to Reine and kept her heart rate up. The pants came off easily under Kiara’s direction, and even when they were tossed to the other end of the room Kiara didn’t move away from her position between Reine’s legs.

She held her position, slowly leaving kisses further and further up Reine’s inner thighs, but never getting too close. She watched Reine like a predator eyeing its prey, waiting for the right moment to pounce. Reine waited for Kiara to take action, but she never advanced. She was biding her time, content to enjoy sinking her fingers into Reine’s soft, smooth flesh, leaving wet kisses, but no more.

Reine realized she was waiting. Maybe for consent. But more likely she wanted to make Reine say it. Reine was a proud peafowl, who knew begging was beneath her. But she was also wetter than she ever felt before, and needed to feel Kiara’s tongue as deep inside her as possible. So she begged.

“Kiara, I need you to start right now. If you don’t get to work this instant I swear to god you are never getting off this island. Please, Kiara, I need this- I need you so bad.” Reine spread her legs further open. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it? For me to ask you to eat me out? Well I’ll do it.” Reine put her legs on Kiara’s shoulders and pulled her in. “Put your tongue in my pussy, Kiara. Make me your slut.”

“Fucking finally,” Kiara moaned like a prayer, hooking her arms around Reine’s legs and pulling aside Reine’s panties with her mouth. Kiara could see the foreplay was effective from the glistening sheen on Reine’s pussy lips. The atmosphere was intoxicating, and a mixture of smells from Reine’s sweat, perfume, and juices clouded Kiara’s brain. She placed a few hungry kisses around Reine’s slit to bask in her treasure she finally reached before moving onto her goal. 

Replicating the passionate kisses from earlier, Kiara teased Reine’s folds with her tongue, tasting her sweet wetness. A high pitched tone came from Reine at first contact. Kiara’s tongue felt electrifying on her sensitive lips. She flexed her legs tighter around Kiara’s head, urging her further. Kiara licked up and down Reine’s entrance, enjoying the sensation and the quiet shivers she felt from Reine around her. She delighted in toying with Reine, feeling her squirm and hearing the cute moans escaping her lips. But she was merciful, and she knew Reine’s threat of kidnapping was not entirely hollow. 
Taking a moment to ready herself and let Reine know something was about to happen, Kiara parted Reine’s lower lips and began to explore her insides. A sustained moan came from Reine, but Kiara was too focused on pleasuring her partner to give it full notice. 

Reine was so sweet, so accepting. 

Kiara gently moved about Reine’s entrance, making sure Reine felt comfortable with her appendage in her. Judging by how wet she already was, Kiara felt confident in going further. She pushed her tongue around the walls of Reine’s tight pussy, charting its shape and how different spots made Reine react. Reine was unashamedly moaning at every tongue movement, so it seemed Kiara’s job would be straightforward. That didn’t mean she wasn’t going to give it her all.

Kiara kept a steady rhythm to her cunninglingus, never giving Reine too much time to rest, but also not overexerting her jaw. She wanted to make sure Reine got the most out of this night. 

Reine had tried to watch Kiara work her magic, but the sensation proved too intense. She was now laid down on her back, head staring up at the ceiling in constant ecstasy. She felt so alive, so loved, so hot. Kiara had taken the lead, but having Kiara service her was so incredibly sexy it almost felt taboo. Reine was discovering new things about herself every minute. How she liked to be touched, what parts of her were most sensitive, the balance of control and submission. It was all so erotic, she couldn’t help but scream out Kiara’s name as her tongue delved even deeper into her. 

“Deeper! Don’t hold back!” 

Reine barked the order and grabbed onto Kiara’s head, pushing her into her crotch. Kiara clung onto Reine’s legs for leverage and upped her tempo. Her face was wet with Reine’s juices and her mouth was getting sore from the motion, but feeling Reine’s tight grip on her hair sparked her to please her mistress with delight. 

Kiara looked up to see Reine staring back down at her. The demure, gentle countenance was replaced with a wild, almost furious visage. Kiara had grown to love Reine’s beautiful face; her multi-toned eyes, small nose and mouth always brought her happiness and joy. The face she saw now was framed by messy hair, with piercing heart-eyes and gritted teeth. This was a side to Reine that Kiara never knew could exist. And as Reine forcibly rearranged the angle between her mouth and her cunt, Kiara couldn’t deny she liked being used as a tool for Reine’s pleasure. 

Kiara bobbed her head to better stimulate Reine and moved one hand down to quickly finger her own dripping womanhood. Kiara’s eyes started to roll back into her head from pleasure and oxygen deprivation. She loved every second of being used. She loved seeing Reine confident and in charge. It was a dance they played, one gives while the other takes. Kiara was in a trance and happy to give and give and give right now. 

“Fuck, you’re such a good little slut. You like being down there, don’t you. Come on, get in there deeper. I want you to tongue fuck me. I thought you were good at this? Come on, make your mistress come.” 

Reine didn’t know where the words were coming from, but they flew out with a venom. All that mattered to her was making Kiara fuck her to completion. Her hips rolled against Kiara’s head, forcing her tongue to penetrate her at a faster pace, trying to steal every extra centimeter. 

Kiara reveled in her role as Reine’s personal dildo. Her fingers worked at herself at a blistering pace while she frantically tried to lap at every corner of Reine’s canal. This was getting dangerous. She was starting to enjoy this too much, and she knew there might not be any coming back if this went on much longer. She thought she was going to make Reine her pillow princess, but she was quickly being turned into her sex toy. She needed to make Reine come before she did, or she may never be able to leave.

She had one card left unplayed. Removing her tongue from the back of Reine’s pussy, Kiara quickly moved her mouth up to Reine’s clitoris and inserted two fingers as replacement. Using a similar technique that had proved effective on her nipples, Kiara sucked and swirled on Reine’s delicate nub while pistoning in her fingers at the same pace she was fingering herself. She wouldn’t lose without a fight.

“Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t stop! Kiara! Kiara! Kiaraaaaaaaaaaaa!” 

Kiara’s name turned into a cry as Reine’s body exploded. The warm coil inside her released its tension to the very ends of her body, and for an euphoric moment Reine felt like they extended beyond her being. Her legs convulsed around Kiara’s head, her sweaty body arched against the mattress, and her head rolled from side to side in ecstasy, but Reine felt like she was floating in midair, and for a moment she thought she could feel the entire galaxy.        
The high of her orgasm lasted for the better part of a minute. It took longer for her limbs to stop spasming. While Reine was enjoying the greatest afterglow of her life, Kiara was starting to blackout. Reine’s climax caused her to clamp Kiara’s head between her thighs, and while she was enjoying the sensation it was starting to hurt. Her love drunk stupor kept her from feeling most of the pain, but she still was having trouble breathing pressed into Reine’s nethers. 

After it became clear Reine wasn’t going to move any time soon, Kiara reached up to tap her on the stomach. The contact made Reine groggily look down, then open up her legs again in a fluster.

“S-sorry, Kiwawa. I just- I mean- whew!” Reine failed to properly apologize for almost crushing Kiara between her thighs. “I guess I just kind of got… you know…wow…”

Kiara rubbed her jaw but didn’t seem to really mind. She smiled at the blabbering and out of breath Reine still trying to explain that she had the best orgasm of her life. She didn’t need to explain it. Kiara knew. 

Reine was still lying on her back, one hand on her forehead the other limp at her side. Kiara nestled up next to her for some aftercare. She interlocked the fingers on Reine’s free hand with her own and wrapped her arm around her lover. 

Soft kisses were left on Reine’s cheek. “That really was something special,” Kiara finally said, “I didn’t know you were capable of that.”  

“Um, neither was I. I don’t really know what happened. You were just making me feel so good, and I just wanted more. I wanted to feel closer to you, and something made me take the bull by the horns. Or I guess the phoenix by the hair.” 

Kiara tried to stifle her laugh at the bad joke, but couldn’t help it. “You dork, I love you.”

“I love you too, Kiara. I think it must come from you. You make me feel like I can do things I would be too scared to even try before. Hopefully I didn’t get too aggressive.”

“Nothing I won’t get better from. Besides,” Kiara kissed Reine directly on the lips and kept herself above her face, “I like it when you get rough.”

Kiara moved her mouth to Reine’s ear and whispered directly into it, “And when you started talking dirty? Holy shit that got me so wet.” 

Kiara started to tease, nibble, and lick Reine’s lobe as she swung her leg over top of Reine’s body.

“Don’t believe me? Feel it for yourself,” Kiara took the hand she was holding and pressed Reine’s fingers against her hot and wet vagina. “I made sure you didn’t notice, but I haven’t come yet tonight.”

Reine flipped Kiara over with an excited giggle and kissed her deeply yet again.
