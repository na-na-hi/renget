Today is going to be the best day of your life. You’ve planned this day out for an entire year and have spent thousands of dollars in preparation. This will probably be the crowning achievement of your entire life. Today is the day that Kurokami shits down your mouth.

You couldn’t keep yourself still throughout the entire flight. You were giddy with excitement. The thought of Kuro’s poop sliding down your throat made you ecstatic. Throughout the flight you wondered if her shit would match her cold personality. You imagined it tasting foul and smelling like a skunk farted on a dead body. It was hard to control yourself. Anytime you entered the restroom you thought about joining the Half-mile High Club and by the time the plane landed in Tokyo, you were salivating like an excited dog. You bolted off into the airport as soon as you could, causing quite the disturbance.

Now on Japanese soil, it was time to collect your gear. For over a year you had bought plumbing equipment and stored it inside of a storage container. From overalls to PVC pipes, you had it all. Your plan required you to look like an ordinary plumber on a routine call to fix some pipes. You donned denim overalls, filled your toolbox with spanners and screwdrivers, filled your pockets with laxatives, and grabbed the keys to the truck you had bought. It pained you just to think about all the money you had spent but you convinced yourself that it was worth it. There was no other way to get close to Kurokami without a disguise since Fubuki, her roommate, had surely warned her about any fans with an interest in scatology.  

Like any good fan you knew where they lived (221 Oda Street to be exact), so getting there was quite easy. The hard part was waiting for Fubuki to leave for work. She would have recognized you on sight and a year of planning would be flushed down the drain in an instant so you’re forced to wait. Finally, Fubuki left for work. From the truck’s window you watched Fubuki wave good-bye to Kuro then walk down the street. Your eyes became transfixed on her fluffy tail which bounces with each step and you’re reminded about how great her asshole looked when she shat down your mouth. Right then and there, you promised yourself that you were going to eat Kurokami’s poop no matter what.

Several minutes passed, you looked out the truck window but could not see Fubuki. She was long gone. Grabbing your toolbox, you hurried across the street constantly looking every which way in case Fubuki came back. There was no reason for you to be so paranoid. Everything had been accounted for and you knew that the hard-working Fubuki was always on time. Then why were you afraid of your plan going awry? Why was there a pit in your stomach? You knew why. You weren’t worried at all. That feeling in your stomach was caused by how excited you were. The pit in your stomach was filled with fluttering butterflies. The fruit of your hard work was about to pay off in the form of fecal matter. You just needed to act naturally in order not to choke.

The front door swung open before you could knock. Kuro stood in the threshold; her forearm resting on the door frame. She snarled at you with contempt. Her red eyes, partially covered by frizzy black bangs, were filled with hatred. The top half of her body was cloaked in an oversized tank top that was black enough for her hair to blend in. She wore a pair of white panties but that was covered by her tank top which gave her the appearance of not wearing any underwear making her long, slender legs more pronounced. You stared a little too long at those long legs of hers. In a cold voice, Kuro asked, “What do you want?”

This was your first test.

You paused for a moment, your palms were sweaty knees weak arms heavy mom’s spaghetti, then said, “I’m the plumber that Fubuki called.”

She rolled her eyes, “Ugh, you must mean Shirakami Fubuki. She just left too,” Kuro sighed, “Well, if it’s urgent then I guess you can come in and do your thing.”

“Thank you. I didn’t quite catch your name earlier, what was it again?”

“The name’s Kurokami Fubuki but most people just call me Kuro for short.”

“Nice to meet you,” you said, extending your hand.

Kuro tsked and wrinkled her nose but at the same time shook your hand over the threshold (a taboo in some cultures). Unlike most people living in Japan, her grip was firm and she never broke eye contact. If she were American, her handshake would be the example to follow.  

You walked into her house taking in your surroundings as you slipped off your shoes. You were in a plain white kitchen that also served as the dining room and laundry room as there was a large wooden table with paw prints impressed on tablecloth opposite the sink and oven; past the table was a door where the whirring and swirling sounds of a washer could be heard. On the stove sat a tea kettle above a small electrical flame. That was how Kuro was going to ingest the laxatives you brought. Speaking of Kuro, she left you to your own devices innocently assuming that you were an actual plumber. You got to work.

The first thing you did was to turn off the water, after that you sprinkled crushed laxatives into the still boiling teapot. So far so good. To Kuro’s surprise, you walked into the small living room that was connected to the kitchen. Only two things were of note in the living room: an expensive looking rug in the middle of the room and a sign on the wall that read ikiru, warau, aisuru. You told her, “I’ve turned the water off. Can you show me where the restroom is?”

Kuro groaned, “I thought you were just working on the sink.”

“No, Fubuki paid me to fix your plumbing and that includes your toilet.”

“It’s down the hallway to the left and hurry up today is supposed to be my day off.”

You nearly lost control of yourself. Her sour attitude was one of the reasons why you desired her shit in your mouth and listening to her berate you almost sent you over the edge. Blood flowed into a cock that was gradually increasing in size. Pretending not to hear her, you went to the bathroom where you drained the toilet of water and loosened the pipes. Your heart was beating in your chest a million times per minute. Beads of sweat formed around your receding hairline. Every second that passed felt like an hour as you waited for the teapot to whistle. Then it happened. An ear-piercing whistle erupted from the kitchen and into every corner of the house. You licked your lips, slowly dragging your tongue and savoring the feeling.

Kuro was sitting on the couch sipping tea from her teacup when you walked in. She took a long swig of rich black tea before setting the teacup down on a saucer that rested on her lap. Clearing her throat, Kuro said, “I made some tea if you want some.”

You replied, “No, I’m good.”

“Are you sure?” she sipped from her teacup, “I make really good tea. Even Fubuki, who prefers green tea over black likes the tea that I make.”

“No, no, I insist.”

“Your loss.”

That made you smile. A smile that you quickly forced to disappear.

Unbeknownst to Kuro, she was ingesting four pills worth of the strongest laxatives you could buy (the Pipe Cleaner 9000 was the name of the brand). Suddenly, her stomach growled so loud that it sounded like a lion’s roar. Her eyes grew wide and cold sweat dotted her face. She stood up, carefully setting her teacup and saucer on the couch. Kuro was looking worse every second. The laxatives were taking effect. The moment of glory would soon be upon you. Trying to stay calm, she asked you, “Am I able to use the toilet?”

Slowly, almost menacingly, you shook your head.

“Can you fix it super fast? It’s an emergency.”

Again you shook your head and a sinister smile spread itself on your face. That was when Kuro understood who you were. She looked at you in disbelief and her breathing grew heavy and erratic. Her pale skin now appeared as sickly pallid. The fiery anger in her red eyes extinguished under the fear of what was going to happen next. The strong woman who met you at the door was gone and was replaced by a pitiful creature whose shit, you imagined, tasted delicious. You spoke at last, “You have three options, Kuro. One, you run outside, unleash your bowels, and embarrass yourself forever. Two, you use the toilet or bathtub which I’ve sabotaged. Or three, you take a dump in my mouth and this remains our little secret.”

She whimpered, “Will it be over fast?”

“Yes.”

“Are you going to do anything else?”

“No.”

Kuro sniffled as she pulled down her white panties which were stained brown. Now that’s a souvenir. She took off her tank top but you didn’t see much since you were already lying on the ground waiting. Kuro squatted over your face, spreading her ass cheeks. Her pink, soon to be brown, asshole was mesmerizing. You grabbed the root of her tail, causing a cute gasp to expel from Kuro’s mouth, and lifted it so poop wouldn’t get caught in it. Her asshole widened and she farted in your face. Several short bursts of hot air slammed into your face which you quickly breathed in. It smelled horrible and you loved it. The smell was like garbage that had been shat out of an obese bear. Already, this trip was worth it. Then came the appetizer.

A brown stream of liquid shit poured out of her ass and into your mouth. It tasted as horribly as you had hoped. It was like all her bitterness was condensed into fecal matter which was now running down your throat. While shit was streaming into your mouth, you pressed your lips around her asshole and drank the liquid shit. You sucked hard and fast not wasting a second. You chugged Kuro’s smelly poop like there was no tomorrow. Your esophagus burned at the touch of her delicious brown liquid but that was the feeling you wanted, the feeling you desired. You could drink her shit for days on end. It was better than Fubuki’s, it was better than drugs, it was the best liquid you ever drank. When Kuro was done shitting, you smelled her nasty asshole and got as high as cloud nine. Time for the main course.

Last night’s dinner came out next in big mushy orange-yellow clumps. Your mouth was full in seconds so you had to resort to holding her slimy shit in your hands while you feverishly chewed her feces. You could’ve sworn that you could make out what she had for dinner. One mushy clump which had some hard parts had the aftertaste of carrots while another had some crunchy apple seeds in them, but it mostly tasted like chicken which smelled like sulfur so you concluded that Kuro must’ve had a delicious oyakodon dish before going to bed. The last bit of shit that was shat out was her midnight snack. It looked browner than the rest and tasted sweet so you guessed that she had a scoop or two of chocolate ice cream late at night. In just a few short minutes you were done. Kuro could shit no longer and your hands were covered in an orange-yellow slime which you happily licked off, but for some reason Kuro didn’t move an inch.

“I’m done,” you said, “you can get off me now.”

Kuro whimpered, “I’m still dirty done there. C-Can you clean me?”

“Gladly,” you licked up the glistening brown shit that was on her ass cheeks with a smile on your face. Your tongue twirled around her asshole, restoring it to its original bright pink color. Almost done, you spat in her asshole and said, “Now you can call me Bidet.”

After you were done cleaning her, Kuro collapsed on the spotless rug in a pile of tears; traumatized for the rest of her life. Her tears quickly stained the expensive-looking rug that you had worked so hard to keep clean, but you didn’t care. Your cock was so erect that it hurt, but you didn’t masturbate in front of Kuro because that would’ve been weird. You got up, fixed the pipes you had sabotaged, and left feeling like the king of the world. In the end, all the time and money spent on this little project of yours had been absolutely worth it. You flew out of the county on a red eye never to be seen or heard from again. You lived happily ever after. The End.
