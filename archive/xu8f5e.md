#Orochi’s to-do list - Training to defeat my old Friends Edition

##Rui:
- Rui has a complicated quirk to deal with. No one in my class has a quirk close enough to how hers works. Maybe Chris can help me with it?
  - It  turns out Chris can’t help me, but he can try to find someone who can control Earth and copy their quirk
  - Update: He didn’t find someone with a quirk like that. Bloody hell.
- Find someone who can punch me hard
  - It is easy, Kaylee and Bobby.
-  It turns out Bobby and Kaylee will be helping me the most…

##Sasha:
- Sasha is a complicated mess. I won against her because she couldn’t do meaningful damage when we were brats. Turns out she grew and can do nasty stuff with her quirk.
  - Once again, Bobby and Kaylee are my go-to. Bobby hits fast, and Kaylee hits hard. Sadly I cannot take them simultaneously to replicate how Sasha's quirk works, but the endurance training and how to deal with faster opponents is working quite nicely.
- I’m glad Sasha is simple to deal with. I have to exploit a gap, and I will be free to punch her for a minute. It is easier said than done.

##Umi:
- I went to Chihiro, Hodge the Hedgehog (If you ever find this list, Hodge, the nickname was Inigo’s idea!), and Hifumi, who are the class’ swordsmen.
  - When I said I wanted a rough training, I didn’t expect Chihiro to be so brutal. Well, I know I asked for her sword, but still… it was unexpected. 
-  Umi is fast, very fast. While Hifumi can teleport, Chihiro’s fighting style is the closest to Umi’s from what I saw when we… dealt with a sticky situation.
- Hifumi pointed out how to deal with sword fighters using my stature. He said my tails are thick and hard to cut, so I should use them to parry more instead of my arms and legs and rely on my blood to paralyze their hands if I ever got cut.
  - Adding to the above note, it was kinda of freaky when he spoke about my blood. Good thing Hailey smacked him in the head.  Honestly, boys…
- Talking about Minnie, she is helping me “endure” high voltages. Umi won’t hold back when we fight. I should be ready for anything she can pull.
- She was surprisingly amicable. It surprises me how we never talked about and interacted before. She can put out some nasty voltages. 
- Hoge was great too.  She made me expect anything when fighting. She was unpredictable and hard to fight, perfectly undetectable. She was on the defensive because of my strength, like that time on the dojo, so it was hard to break her out of her shell, but when she did, oh boy
  - I’m kinda glad I’m durable. She managed to land very hurtful hits. What is she doing in her free time to hit me like that? Playing vigilante?
- Once again, Umi is her own can of worms, huh? I have the inkling she is going to give me a headache.

#Individual notes:

##Kaylee:
“Honestly, Kaylee went as hard as I expected her to go, even harder, actually. She took on herself the duty to “rough me up real good” for my endurance and counterattack training. I WASN’T ready to fly out of the ring and go through a wall.
She almost knocked me out, seriously! What a crazy girl! But this is what I need. Rui and Sasha aren’t going to play around, and Rui can toss me around like that if she has the space to.
I had never seen Kanburan too much before, but she was fuming that day. We almost got a detention. Since then we sparred on the sports field.
I couldn’t afford to hold back against them, so I  went out against Kaylee. She was thrilled since my punches “hurt for good”. She tossed me around like a ragdoll, my tails held on her for dear life.
That extra foot in height she has is an unfair advantage. Never have I been so humiliated in my life! Ahem, it helped me build more muscles too. I kinda slacked off through the year regarding my muscle training.
Kaylee helped me gain some strength and muscle, she was my first friend, except for Umi who knows my parents somehow, to go to my house so we could schedule workouts and whatnot.
I think my father liked her training diligence. Kaylee talked about how I started to “withdraw from my shell” while fighting. What the hell does she mean by this?
Anyhow, I’m glad she helped me. It won’t be as useful with Sasha, but the strength training and endurance will help me pull through against Rui.”
>Total score: 42 victories for me, 58 victories for Kaylee. Her victories happened more at the start of the training when I was getting the hang of myself and the rhythm I wanted to dance.

##Bobby:
“The sparrings with Bobby happened right after or before Kaylee, gods bless my endurance and regeneration to keep going. Our spars happened in broad daylight, so Bobby was at his peak. He punched hard, but not Kaylee hard.
What he lacked in strength compared to the She-Gorilla, he made up in speed, oh boy, he was fast. We ran circles around me and used that damned multi-punch technique of months ago. It was a good stand-in for Sasha's quirk.
Minnie also joined our training after I asked her too many times, hitting me with sparks while he sparred. Bobby and herself were dumbfounded, but I said a lightning girl once defeated me soundly, so I wanted to build up my endurance against sparks. This did the trick.
It was unbearable to fight Bobby while my skin was zapped, but I managed to pull through. It was hard to land a solid hit on him. I had to use my Hydra heads for that most of the time. Minnie’s help didn’t make the fight any easier. 
Good thing they are dating. It helped bring them closer. Although the whole “resistance train your friend” was offputting for them. Sometimes Kaylee joined our spar too.
Bobby made me learn that I can’t solely rely on counterattacks against speedy foes who can endure my attacks, it was hard… but I managed to lash out more often against him. he said I looked scary when going on offensive because of my claws and Hydra heads…
 I’m sorry for ruining his shirt uniform with my claws.
I’m not sorry about the view that came after that, tho.”
>Total score: 22 wins for me. 56 victories for Bobby. All the 22 times Kaylee joined our training, she had beaten Bobby and me soundly. GAAAAH

##Chihiro:
“Chihiro was angry when I said to train… on how to deal with opponents who wield a sword. Good thing it was “Chihiro angry”, so it wasn’t that bad. She whined about Sandatsu asking the same thing in the past, how to deal with sword fighters.
Bobby was fast. Chihiro was a spark when we clashed. She used her quirk on me, but I couldn’t feel anything amiss, but oh boy. She was the fastest thing I have ever seen. My skin and claws are tough. 
I matched her sword on impact, exploiting the gaps when the sword hit me, and the time Chihiro withdrew it for another attack.
It wasn’t easy, and she was too fast for me, so I just scratched her. I don’t think Umi will ever be as fast as Chihiro, but it hardly mattered. Avoiding and blocking Chihiro’s sword was nearly impossible, and her sword didn’t seem to be the same thing as Umi’s…  those red sparks were not normal.
Chihiro didn’t put faith in my endurance to tank a sword hit until I showed it to her. A normal blade will hardly pierce my skin. Feral’s chainsaw and Umi’s sword don’t appear to be normal, however. And the sword Chihiro used was different from the one she used as a hero in training.
The tsuba and handle were different. Well. I think her hero sword may be different from the one she used in our training(?)
Anyway, Chihiro was a stern and rough teacher, but I learned a thing or two about parrying a sword, or trying to.”
>Score: 42 fights. All my losses.

##Hifumi:
“He was overeager on how to train me in dealing with sudden and as hits from a sword. He didn’t want to use his sword, however. A thick bamboo stick did the job. Somehow, the guy with the literal teleporting quirk was easier to predict than Chihiro. It was freaky, honestly, but Hifumi agreed with me about how scary Chihiro can be as a teacher.
His attacks while faster, had time to be perceived. My hydra heads made sure of that. He taught me about positions and attacks from kendo and iajitsu, and about how to see the patterns and movements.
He taught me the theory, and Chihiro made sure to smack my brain with it. He was a better teacher than Chihiro, though.
Gave some ideas about screwing sword fighters if I ever got cut, mainly using my blood to cover their hands, paralyzing them, and nullifying their sword fight. He begged me to never use it on him since that would be gross.
It made me unease a little bit, but Hailey smacked him well, so we were even. Although the idea about blood is not that bad…”
>Score: 23 victories for me. 23 for him… we had a draw… Dammit.

##Minnie:
“My training with her resumed on tanking hits and electricity, she fights nothing like Umi, so it was only endurance training. When we didn’t do it with Bobby, she took me out with the rest of the Korean5 to kill time… they are quite nice. I should hang out with them more often.”
>Score: We didn’t fight, so no score. 

##Chris:
“He tried his best to find an earth-manipulating quirk but failed. If I didn’t know him, I would swear he was whipping his back in shame because of the tone he used. Damn, Chris is always so attentive. He knows I’m preparing to face someone. It was hard to get him out of my hydra heads, harder was to make him not call you Yui and the others in my mess.
I like you, Chris, I really do, but you can be a pain when you put your mind to something
He didn’t believe me when I said I would be okay…”

##Hoge:
“Oh, I almost forgot about her! Hehe, sorry, Hodge. She was the scariest of them all. She vanished without a trace and then hit me out of nowhere. I couldn’t see her, feel her, or hear her until the attack landed. 
When she stopped holding herself back, was like fighting a ghost. She attacked as she pleased, and I could only react. Her attacks came out of nowhere. There was no way to predict them. I just reacted the best way I could when she landed the hit. It was terrifying to not know when the next attack would come, and where she was.
I won’t say I am ready to face someone like her, but it will make it easier to know I have the shortest gap in existence to counterattack when they make their movements.”
>Score: 4 victories for me. 17 victories for Hoge.
