Leanne Pierpont hailed from a distant and foreign land, her lineage tracing back to a family of esteemed aristocracy. Born into a family that valued the mystical arts and ancient traditions, she was raised with all the privileges and luxuries befitting her noble status. However, her path in life took an unexpected turn when it became clear that she had no talent for traditional magic, an aptitude highly prized by her noble lineage.

Instead, she displayed an incredible talent focused on being a flag bearer, a role that nobody had expected her to excel in. Her grace, poise, and the unwavering determination she exhibited on the battlefield were truly exceptional. To complement her skills as a flag bearer, Leanne had also developed a unique aptitude for body cultivation. Her physical prowess exceeded even those who had spent their lives honing their bodies. This combination of attributes marked her as a rare and extraordinary individual in her homeland.

Upon completing her training, her parents presented her with a magnificent banner, a powerful gift to carry into battle, for it was a magic treasure of the highest quality.

Leanne's life took a tragic turn when her homeland was ravaged by a relentless barbarian known as the Northern Scourge. He decimated the army she rallied as if they weren't even there. How was she supposed to lead peaople with courage when faced with something like that?

Leanne decided to chase after the man that took everything away from her. Now, she stood alone in a foreign and unfamiliar realm, a land where her noble lineage and regal bearing held little sway.

Determined to continue her role as a flag bearer and rally allies to her cause, Leanne carried with her several ancient and powerful scriptures that she referred to as "Honors." These scrolls, imbued with extraordinary knowledge and potential, were meant to be granted to the allies she sought to lead into battle.

>Attack Technique: Heavenly Banner Strike
A technique that causes Leanne's banner to vanish, only to appear form another direction, rushing at the enemy and targetting their weakest spot. It delivers a very strong impact, and then gracefully returns to her hand.

>Footwork Technique: Mystic Glyphshift
Simple footwork technique that enables Leanne to instantaneously move to the location of her mystical banner.

>Endurance Technique: Beacon of Fortitude
A technique that reinforces Leanne's body, while also making her actions and movement specially hard to disrupt and stop. This technique beocmes stronger the more allies she has.

>The Honors

Leanne's Honors are revered scriptures that house martial arts techniques of immense power and grace. These techniques encompass Qi Cultivation, Body Tempering, Soul Refinement, and Supporting, each with a distinct purpose and influence. Leanne possesses the unique ability to bestow these Honors upon allies she deems worthy. What makes these Honors truly remarkable is their adaptability, as they scale off the natural talents of the recipient, unlocking their latent potential.

Honors of Qi Cultivation - "Resonant Harmony"

This sacred scripture imparts the "Resonant Harmony" technique, a Qi cultivation method that transcends boundaries. The essence of this technique is its adaptability. When granted, it resonates with the recipient's innate elemental affinity, and allows for incredible cultivation.
"Resonant Harmony" enhances the efficiency of their Qi cultivation, empowers them to wield more potent techniques, and makes their synergy with their element so profound that they actually start to become one.

Honors of Body Tempering - "Adamantine Endurance"

The "Adamantine Endurance" scripture reveals the technique of body tempering that adapts to the recipient's physical prowess.
Those who embrace "Adamantine Endurance" find the strengths gained throught cultivating with this technique actually merge with their bloodlines, becoming inheritable traits. If they do not have any bloodlines, it could be the beginning of a very powerful one.

Honors of Soul Refinement - "Ethereal Ascension"

The "Ethereal Ascension" scripture imparts a technique that resonates with the recipient's unique soul qualities. This Honor is the key to a profound soul refinement journey, where the individual's natural talents guide their path.
Its focus lies on the growth of the spirit, manifested as perfect replicas of one's own soul. Producing one every time you go up a realm, these copies are as strong as your own, essentially decreasing cultivation time as they help you refine the main soul. This means that the higher your soul refinement realm goes, the more copies you will have, and the faster you will cultivate.

Honors of Support - "Unyielding Unity"

"Unyielding Unity" is a sacred scripture that empowers the recipient. Every time the user goes to a higher realm, it causes their Techniques to slowly rise to the default strength level of that realm. Though it doesn't aid with cultivation speed directly
