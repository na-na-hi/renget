**1.** I do not support multispectrum lesbians and gays , or any other "good faith" identity in general. This includes but is not limited to transrace/rcta/ecta, transability or whatever yall call yourselves, transmasc alters in perisex amab bodies and transfem alters in perisex afab bodies, etc. etc.
**2.** I do not support nor believe in endogenics systems / any non-traumagenic system, system hopping (the endogenic meaning of it), alter pregnancy, alter death, and POC alters in white, non-indigenous/native bodies
**3.** I do not support nor believe in IRLs, doubles, introjects = source, disorder abuse, and uncontrollable typing quirks
**4.** I am a diagnosed DID system, autistic, have ADHD and suspected BPD. I am also a college student.  Because of these reasons, I do not guarantee I will be able to be online and chat with you 24/7 on Discord.
**5.** Please be aware I *will* block you if your rentry/carrd or whatever isn't accessible.

**1.** Please ask to DM and Friend request. I probably won't share my Simplyplural account with you unless I know you. The only exceptions to this is if you want to DM for server matters, moderation purposes, or simply wanna talk about DC/Batman with me!
**2.** Do not make suicide jokes unless in private settings and I consider you an extremely close friend. Things like "I am gonna explode", "I am gonna die" or whatever are 100% fine, I only have issues with stuff like "I am gonna kill myself" "I am gonna jump off a bridge/cliff/roof" "I am gonna overdose" like just dont !! Lol
**3.** Avoid talking to me about medication pills in private settings. By that I mean unnecessary talk about them, or overly detailed. Stuff like "I am gonna take meds" is 100% fine. Also don't make "go take your meds" jokes with me either !!
**4.** Avoid questioning me about my religion and what I believe in. Don't try to convert me either I don't know why you would even do that???
**5.** Do not flirt with me with romantic or sexual intent. Platonic affection is fine. Public Displays of Affection depends but is generally a no unless I say otherwise.
**6.** Please do not misuse tone tags around me. Stuff like "im gonna die /srs /gen /real" like, I don't *need* tone tags to be used around me but if you are gonna joke around with them I *will* get confused.
