>Lockley: This is Lockley-2, calling all stations. Do you copy? Over.
>Air Traffic Control (ATC): Yeah, yeah, we copy you. What's your deal? Over.

>Lockley: Lockley here. I, uh, just wanted to introduce myself to everyone. It's my maiden flight and I'm embarking on a personal scavenging mission. I'm great with machines and know how to find valuable loot. um, Nice to meet you all. Over.
>ATC: Oh, great. We got a wannabe treasure hunter here. We've got real pilots out here doing real missions, and you think you can waste our time with your little treasure hunt? Well, don't expect any special treatment. You're authorized to fly solo, right? Give us your estimated time of return. Over.

>Lockley: I-I'm sorry, ATC. I didn't mean to bother anyone. I'll be careful and, um, I'll make sure to stay out of everyone's way. I am flying solo. As for the return time, it's uncertain due to the nature of my scavenging mission. I'll provide updates as I progress. Over.
>ATC: Uncertain? What kind of amateur are you? You better hope you don't cause any trouble. Don't make us regret authorizing your flight. Over.

>Lockley: I understand, ATC. I'll make sure to maintain regular communication. Lockley-2, signing off. Over and out.
