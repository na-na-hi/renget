##### `Red Riding Wolf`
>You go around the bend in the road and find 'little' red riding hood coming at you down the path.
>Initially, she's excited to see you, but that energy rapidly fades into annoyance.
"Wait," you begin, "I thought I was going to red riding hood this time."
She just stares at you in disappointment for a moment before quietly saying, "I wanted to be red..."
You can't meet her gaze, "Sorry love, I forgot."
>With your averted gaze, you don't notice her approach until she's a foot away from you.
>As you jolt back, she lets out an amused laugh that gets her left ear to flick.
"Don't worry, I saw that you forgot and I put your costume in my basket."
>You're caught on the back foot and she tosses you your costume from your basket and turns you around.
"I was a bit annoyed that you forgot, but on my walk over I decided that I could play it up for fun. I'll meet you down the path my big bad wolf," and she sends you on your way with a pat on the rear.
>With your new role in mind, you start looking for good places to ambush her... and change.
>It's not what you had in mind, but that's alright.
