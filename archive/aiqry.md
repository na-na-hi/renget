"But not... unwelcome.", another, less gravelly voice purred.

Miranda and Penelope turned on their heels in one swift motion to behold two men, each one at least a head taller than them.
One had hair the shade of rich ebony reaching his shoulders, framing an angular face set in a sharp-teethed, wolfish grin. Dressed in flowing thin azure robes, lined with silver thread, he had a dandy air about him. His companion appeared less elegant, with heavy features of a more primal handsomeness and a shock of red hair that settled in a windswept mane. This one wore a fur lined leather mantle, marked with arcane symbols.

And their eyes drew the most attention. It seemed as if they gleamed with a crimson glint.

Two wands flicked out, pointing at each stranger, as the two witches realized just what these men were. Vampires.
"Wouldn't do anything reckless, little morsels.", the gruff one says lazily, taking a step toward Penelope and Miranda. The other continued in his sweet-as-honey voice, "Indeed, it's already bad manners, breaking into someone else's home. You don't need to pick a fight with the owner, eh? But!", he clapped his sharp-nailed hands together. "-you are *welcome* still." A tense expression formed on Miranda's face as she narrowed her eyes at the dandy vampire.

"You're the ones responsible for that-", Penelope asked, only to be interrupted.

"...music? Yes we are. We're travelling entertainers. Of a sort. And if you would kindly... lower your wands, perhaps we can give you a demonstration."

Reluctantly, the pair of witches decided to give in to the invitation, after a moment that seemed to drag on forever. The lull of the melody played stronger in their minds now, easing them into relaxation. In response, the vampires introduced themselves with a flourishing bow.
"I am Bardon Hurst, and my friend here-", the dandy vampire gestured to his companion, "Is Conrad Ehrling.", to which the other gave a nod, fixing his eyes on Penelope.

After their introduction, Bardon turned to the harp, and with an open palmed flick of his wrist shifted the lullaby into something else.
A kind of melody that was suited for a slow dance, but with an otherworldly aura to it. The drowsiness that Penelope and Miranda felt creeping up changed as well. At once they felt more awake, but as in a dreamy state of consciousness, where the mind slipped to let go of all its troubles.
It was less than compulsion and still more than a tug that either of them noticed building up, just as Bardon offered his hand out to Miranda for a dance, while Penelope didn't protest when Conrad pulled her closer for the same.

They whirled around the spacious burgundy tent, light like feathers on the wind, held by strong arms. As their bodies ground upon and closer to eachother, their partner's hands wandered around fondling their figures. Giving in to the dance's lure, the two witches slipped into wantonness, barely noticing that the same searching hands slid off their dress piece by piece, exposing soft skin.

"What kind of *entertainers* are you...?", Miranda muttered groggily. From the corner of her eye, she saw Penelope's hands riding down Conrad's mantle, gripping and massaging the noticably large bulge with a giggle before wresting it free from its constraints.

"The *kind* that makes sure witches don't come short and are thoroughly satisfied."

Without warning Miranda was swiftly lowered onto silk sheets, eliciting a gasp from her as the next moment, the vampire's face peaked out from between her legs. His lips traced kisses up her inner thigh and trailed along the length with his tongue whenever his mouth wasn't pressed to the heat of her skin. All the while his hands carressed her abdomen and hips, working himself up. Her moans mixed with moist sucking noises just off to her side. The gruff vampire had grabbed her fellow Ravenclaw's braided copper hair and pushed Penelope on her knees. A sultry expression played on the guild-leader's face as it was buried in the brute's lap, mouth firmly wrapped around the thick member. She bobbed her head, slowly advancing to the base as she gave it a spit sheen, with the excess drooling down her chin.

"Mmh~ hm~ hnf~" Back and forth, back and forth, finding a barrier just shy of three quarters the length her mouth already conquered.

Intoxicated from the lustful atmosphere, Miranda parted her legs some more for Bardon's advances. He reached her sex, greedily lapping and twirling his tongue around her most sensitive parts, saliva mixing with her own growing wetness. Placing a hand on his head, she stroked the ebony tresses and ran her fingers through them, while using her free hand to guide his to all the spots where she desired his touch. Panting, moaning and slurping accentuated the tune, creating a blissful cascade.

Suddenly, Conrad yanked Penelope down to the hilt of his shaft in one motion, either out of impatience or a strange sense of chivalry, helping the witch with the final struggle. "Glck~ gmmh~." Her cheeks puffed out as he invaded her throat, though instead of withdrawing, she obliged by circling her tongue around his girth, making it throb harder than before. At the same time, bearing witness to the raw display of sexuality, Miranda dug her heels into the back of Bardon's head, forcing his face deeper into her lap and exclaiming her orgasmic climax. "Ah~!"

Emitting an audible pop, the brutish vampire withdrew from Penelope with a groan and promptly shot plentiful jets of sticky sperm on her face, 
some of it landing in her open mouth. She licked her lips and pushed herself up, smiling slyly at the still hard erection, twirling around to grind her back on it like an offer. Or a dare. Still quivering from Bardon's tongue, Miranda now felt something different rubbing against her. The dandy vampire teased her wet and wanting entrance, sliding his hard penis over it, slick with her juices. Up and down in a steady rhythm, making her ache for an even sweeter release.

Up and down.

Deciding that the time for the main *event* had arrived, the vampires once again displayed their overpowering strength by hoisting the witches up into different positions. For Penelope, that meant being pulled off her feet into the air, her legs held aloft between bulking biceps each, as she's slowly lowered onto the girthy member. Miranda, however, sat on her vampiric lover's lap, her shins on his thighs, facing him directly while he rested his hands on her hips. 

Accompanied by the resulting wails of pleasure, they slipped into the witches, their insides forming a tight mold around the pulsing shafts.
Penelope quickly gave in to the heavy and fast thrusts into her, eyes rolling back and her tongue hanging out, mouthing. "Yees~!"
The wet slapping noises of his hips hitting her rear echoed throughout, together with the gushing of their mixing fluids.
Able to ride out her pleasure more actively, Miranda took deep strokes down, lingering and wiggling her hips. Once another great tide washed over her, she leaned in closer and stifled her moans by softly biting into Bardon's neck.

For hours their writhing, squirming ecstasy continued and spiraled into near-rapture.

Until at last, spent and dazed in eachother's arms, the two Ravenclaws received a final sticky warm glaze across their bodies, before drifting into sweet blissful slumber.

The next morning they awoke, perfectly dressed on conjured sleeping mats within the ruined courtyard. No trace of the tent was to be seen.
"Was it real?", they wondered, only to find at least some proof of that last, dreamy night. A letter sitting on some wrapped, thin package.

*"To our dear 'Invaders',
we wish to express our utmost gratitude to the lively, riveting company this past evening. It seldom occurs that our kind isn't met with suspicion and outright fear, we hope to have proven a different case. As a parting gift to such lovely adventurous spirits, we leave you this woven cloak of Thestral hair.
When all the doom and gloom of the world pours forth at you, wear it, and you will know that the taste of death does not always mean the loss of life."*

*Esteemed regards,
Signed
C. and B.*
