##### `Cabin Inn(awoo)ds`
>Going innawoods might be the best idea you'd ever had. You managed to buy off a quaint cabin pretty far from town, at a reasonable price to boot. In fact, that old coot you bought it from was practically fidgeting in excitement at selling it off. In fact he started to laugh hysterically as you slid the last of the bills in his hands and he took off running.
>Didn't think much of it, and decided to get settled in. The cabin was honestly great, lots of like new furnishings, a stone fireplace, and a immensfully soft king sized bed. After setting most of your gear aside, you took off outside to explore a bit.
>The cabin was surrounded by low green grass and rather tall timber. The cabin sat a few meters away from a big and refreshing river, perfect for fishing or swimming when days just get to hot. You inhale the biggest breath you could, soaking in that fresh, warm, Summer air. When you exhale, you gather your hand axe and get prepared to gather firewood for the fireplace.

>On your very first day here, swear not even 40 minutes of being here, you realize why that old coot seemed so eager to get some sucker to buy this cabin. That fact became apparent when you spotted a pair of blue eyes staring at you from afar under the cover of the bushes. You pretended as if you didn't see it and began nonchalantly rummaging through your bag.
>A glance over your shoulder allowed you to spot the tall and grey furred figure emerging into the clearing. A "neighbor." A rather tall wolfess, as a matter of fact.
>You'd only seen wolves from afar, they never seemed to stray too far from their territory. And that's when it dawns on you, this cabin must be a part of their territory.
>She certainly didn't take her time making her way over to you, when you turn around again, she's standing right before you, hands on her hips, tail slowly wagging behind her, and leaving her welltoned nude body on display.

>You instinctively gulp, grab your "trusty tool", hide it behind your back and stand up to face her. Not so much "face her", moreso having to look upwards at the smirkish, toothy grin of your neighbor.
>"Well, what do we have here? Another human... in my woods." she stated in a low, smooth tone.
>"Well, *ahem*, I live here. Just purchased this fine home from the original owner. I guess we're neighbors then." you reply back, extending your free hand to express good faith. "I'm *...*, who are you?"
>"You may call me, Skyla, alpha of the pack." She doesn't accept the handshake. "While I'm sure you mean well, but you can't stay here."
>"Come again?"
>"It's nothing personal, it's just that we can't afford to have any humans get mixed up with any neighboring packs. So that's why it's best if you leave while you can." She says, as she turns away to leave.
>"Now wait just a tail waggin' second!" This catches her attention, and she turns back around to face you. "I bought this home fair and square, hell it's not like I can even get a refund. And this here's a free country ma'am. So you can take that "get off ma land" nonsense back home." You bite back, with a noticeable scowl.
>Skyla doesn't seem amused, let alone phased from your response. "I won't ask nicely again."
>"Is that right?" You say, as you ready your "weapon". You pull out the spray bottle filled with water and start spritzing your neighbor. (How's that for a first impression.) "Take this!"
>You squirt the water at Skyla's face, she winces a few times, but merely stares at you. You stop spritzing when you realize that tactic didn't have the intended affect. ("It works on dogs you know, I guess not on wolves huh.")

>She grabs at your wrist and forces you to drop the bottle, with a noticeably peeved look on her face. "You know, it's not nice to attack someone you just met with a weapon. If you aren't going to leave willingly, I guess I'll use force." She says as she licks her lips hungrily.
>"Err, is it too late to say sorry?"
>Skyla holds onto your wrist and thinks for a moment, seemingly pondering what sort of punishment you deserved for your poor attempt at intimidation. Her expression soon becomes a devious grin. "You're really sorry, huh? Well how about you make it up to me."
>Before you can even ask how, she immediately pushes you on your back on the open field. She swiftly and effortlessly pulls off your boots and pants, miraculously not scratching your legs. Before you can move away, she pins down your arms with her incredible strengh, and stares deep into your eyes.
>Skyla then kisses you forcefully, her strong tongue wrestling yours into submission with ease as she eagerly explored your mouth. There was nothing you could do except lay back and let it happen. In all honestly, the feeling may be rough, but pleasing at the same time. Definitely the most aggressive kiss you'd ever had.
>She pulls back from the kiss, and begins to move herself lower to your groin. She begins to inhale deeply at your growing member, practically fixated on your scent. When she opened her mouth and you spotted those pearly white chompers, you began to squirm uncomfortably. This caused Skyla to dig a nail or two into your arms, even gingerly pressing her canine to your member, and all topped off with a low growl, warning you not to resist.
>The combination of pain, fear, and arousal caused your cock to stand at attention immediately. You relaxed as best you could. Noticing this, she relaxes her claws and begins to give long and sensual licks to your manhood. You grip at the grass to try and stave off an orgasm but by God this lady was relentless.

>She plunges her entire maw over your manhood, resting her nose right into your crotch. Skyla stayed like that for a moment, but you could feel her swirling her long tongue around your engulfed member. She then pulls back slowly, revealing your member covered entirely in her saliva, with her hot breath blowing at it.
>You both stayed there for a moment, mainly giving you a chance to catch your breath.
>"That should do it. Now, you're ready for a proper apology" Skyla declared.

>She rises from off the ground, and pulls your legs upwards, positioning you both in the amazon position. "I don't care if you cum before I do, your gonna be my plaything for as long as I see fit. Only then, will I fully accept that apology" said Skyla.
>Without warning, she plunges down entirely on your shaft, sending an immediate bolt through your whole body. She throws her head back at the sudden sensation and holds like that for a moment, savoring how good it feels. Skyla then rises herself half way up your member, before burying your cock deep inside her needy pussy.
>She keeps up a rhythmic pace with a smug grin on her face. It doesn't take long before you shoot your first load into her. Even after cumming, she still rides you even harder, giving that odd mixture of pain and pleasure.
>Not long after, she let's out a howl indicating her own orgasm. This hardly slowed her as she relentlessly rode you for all you were worth, bringing you to your second orgasm.
>At this point, you were practically teetering between sensual bliss and a strong need to rest. You reached a hand up to her, trying to get her to slow down, but she paid no mind. In fact, you squirming, looking so out of it and helpless merely egged her on to go even harder. And after her second, your third, nonstop orgasm, you were finally at your limit.

>Your eyes began to grow heavy from exhaustion, and before long, you drifted off completely. Slowly taking in as much air as your lungs could, trying to recover.
>Seeing that you finally blanked out, Skyla decided she had her fun. She rises fully from off your dick, three orgasms worth of cum dripping down from her honey pot, and let your legs crash to the ground.
>Skyla began to ponder what next: "Well, I can't just leave you here and get snatched up by another wolf. And since you seem adamant on staying, I'd best stay here for a while. Just to make sure no one else bothers you. And... so I can have you all to myself."
>She picks you up off the ground, seemingly ignoring 170 pounds of man, and carries your passed out ass back to the cabin. Looks like this humble abode just got one more member. This was going to be one helluva summer for sure.
