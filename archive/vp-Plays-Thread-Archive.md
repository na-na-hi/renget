***
After Musk went scorched earth and wiped his Rentry in the Rejuv Multi LP, I ended up making a pastebin for the threads, but only for the Multi LP.
This is so that we don't have to deal with Musk's Rentry being wiped again.
At the moment, not all of the LPs are here, but I'll add more as time goes on.
[Until then, here's a link to a mirror of Musk's Rentry for the older shit](https://rentry.org/sk6dvr)
