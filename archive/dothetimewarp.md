>is there a problem? are you not committed to this?
>are you even gay? 
>have you made a terrible misguided mistake in the pursuit of intimacy with someone, anyone?
>no, you're just caught up in your own head
>as your other is forced into direct control with the influence of drew's lightest contact
>first by the incidental brushing past of his black fur
>then by the very intentional
>but also surprisingly gentle wrapping of his hand around your dick

>the skin on his penis is different 
>really nice
>there's a silky yet supple and elastic quality that you're not familiar with on account of all the fur in the way everywhere else
>that's obviously thanks to the extra 'personal care' you caught a short glimpse of

>wtf

>you're interrupted slightly by your own noises and gasps as you say there's nothing to be sorry about

>drew's cum drips onto your stomach and mixes with your own and the product of his hypercowperism
>without thinking about it you dab your finger in to try it
>a year ago you wouldn't have done this even if it was just your own
>you would have hesitated if it was your own dripping from a woman who was into that
>now though it's automatic
>it's not good by any objective measure
>like a salted raw egg white
