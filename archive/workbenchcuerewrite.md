# Workbench.CUE (2024)

At some point while I was asleep, a brand new never seen before cancelled version of Sonic CD was leaked and dumped to the Internet. It was of the 1995 PC port, but according to the leaker it was a "special edition" that was meant to come out in 1997, around the same time as the 3D Blast port. The leaker described it as having not much changed outside of a new menu and a few sprite enhancements, but he also said it had fully 3D special stages, which interested me. Unfortunately, by the time I found out, any downloads were scrubbed off the net. Luckily, my friend came in clutch and had sent it straight to me through e-mail just an hour ago, claiming that he "didn't want to play it" as it "gave off a weird aura". I swear that dude was always on some bullshit so I disregarded anything he said and just downloaded the damn game. 

Extracting the .zip to the desktop and opening the program, yeah it's Sonic CD, the same game I've played to completion way more times than I wanted to. The title screen looked no different, though it was using the original Sonic graphic instead of the one from the released PC port, which was weirdly redrawn slightly for no real reason as no other version of the game used it and it looked off. Pressing Enter, it showed a pretty nice looking menu based off the Visual Mode menu, which made me think. Was the Taxman port's menu based on this, or was it pure coincidence? The buttons obviously weren't the same, being more-or-less just basic fonts. They probably didn't get around to finishing this before it was canned.

Enough, I thought it was damn well enough time to get to the point. I hit new game and just skipped the intro cinematic. Heading straight into Palmtree Zone 1, I sped through it ensuring I grabbed 50 rings because I wanted to see the special stages. I reached the end, made Sonic head straight into the giant ring, and I was quite pleasantly surprised to find out that the special stages were indeed fully 3D! It was actually amazing, and it's unfortunate that this was never seen by anyone outside of SEGA, at least until now! Unfortunately I got distracted and ended up failing the stage. Sonic had a unique animation for failing, showing him being pulled into the ground, and..that was it. That was pretty neat.

I decided to keep playing through the game, which went pretty swimmingly, collecting a fair amount of the Time Stones through the really good looking special stages, up until Wacky Workbench Zone 1. The level was mostly fine as normal, I just hated the round as a whole. I don't know why, but this level was acting a bit strange, the collisions were a little screwed, I died 2 times as a result but I still managed to get through it, even managing to keep 50 rings to the end, getting the last Time Stone I needed (In Quartz I somehow managed to fuck up both zones). Wacky Workbench Zone 1 was unfortunately the last normal zone I ended up playing.

Starting zone 2, I made Sonic walk to the right, and the launcher that was normally there was just missing, which I thought was a bug, but no no no! I just kept moving to the right, and suddenly, a purple clone of Sonic appeared on said launcher zooming towards the right of the screen, knocking Sonic out of the level to his doom. This strange clone of Sonic then jumped off the launcher which had stopped on a dime, turned to the screen and wagged his finger, and out of nowhere, the game closed after emitting a high-pitched noise. I had headphones on at a pretty high volume so it hurt a lot.

I was trying to comprehend what the hell just happened, Windows Defender wasn't flagging anything, so I decided to just re-open the game. Everything seemed normal with the SEGA screen, but then the title screen popped up and Sonic was colored completely wrong. Dude's eyes were black with purple pupils, his fur was purple, skin yellow, gloves were a light blue color, it was just like what I saw before the game crashed, so I assumed he had yellow shoes too. I'm sure a normal person would probably delete the game at this point but I was thinking "Finally, something interesting!" so I pressed on.

The menu had no options other than to continue, which now said "Play" which considering there were no other options, yeah that sounds about right. So I pressed enter. The game restarted at Wacky Workbench, with the title card's Zone number instead replaced with the symbol for infinity. I wouldn't quite understand this until later. Unfortunately, it seems Sonic was no more, instead I was now playing as this purple doppelganger of him, who had some pretty interesting quirks. He doesn't jump as high or run as fast, and roughly every 5 seconds he would turn to the camera and yell out a random insult while his eyes glowed a pulsating red, which was pretty loud coming through my headphones despite how low my volume was now set. You just know that this is going to be pretty fucking irritating.

Whatever, I started playing the level, and suddenly spikes came out of the ground out of nowhere and killed me. One life gone, this Sonic turns to the camera and calls me a faggot, which actually took me by surprise since the usual insults seemed pretty tame! The whole damn level was full of these damn Syobon Action-esque traps, the floor falling out, ceilings randomly coming down to crush Sonic, the fucking ANGEL STATUE from the Past version of the level came down on Sonic to crush him somehow, it was just so fucking annoying I wanted to beat the shit out of whoever at SEGA did this. Come to think of it that was probably what got the project killed to begin with this damn fucking annoying fucking shitty ass fucking easter egg! Thank god though the game enabled infinite lives.

Eventually I got to the end of the level, but then, as I watched in sheer horror, the signpost was whisked away like Classic Crisis City from Generations, and the level looped on itself again, but this time the layout was...different? Was this game randomly generating new layouts for Wacky Workbench specifically just to fuck with me! It was then it dawned on me, the title card zone number being infinity...great. This is an infinitely looping Wacky Workbench. I feel like Sherlock Holmes coming to that conclusion. I played through it for a few more minutes before getting pissed off and closing the game, not before this Sonic (who I'm just gonna call Workbench after the level for sake of distinction) could tell me to "HANG YOURSELF FUCKWAD"

I wanted to see if I could undo this easter egg, so I looked everywhere for the savedata of this game, eventually finding it under AppData, labelled "Sonic CD Special". I deleted it and re-opened the game, and to my surprise, the easter egg was still in effect! So I kept looking for folders of the savedata, even going as far as to worm through my registry for anything, deleting what I could, and still having the game borked. So I just ended up deleting it, wrote my friend a rage-fuelled hate letter about this game, and went to play the 2011 version instead.

I stared at my computer screen with a thousand-yard stare as I found out that it too was messed up. This shouldn't be possible, they're two completely different versions of the game, how could it..how could it? That shouldn't...no... I started to panic a bit as I immediately went to Vimm's Lair and downloaded the Sonic CD version to play, opening it in Gens, and...ARE YOU SHITTING ME IT'S HERE TOO? Running out of answers and starting to feel more and more afraid I decided to just back-up everything on my computer and wiped the hard-drive clean, installing Windows anew, re-installing everything...and
and

and

It was no good. Workbench had somehow permeated deep into my computer and every single copy of Sonic CD I could locate was just permanently bricked. I started hyperventilating as I couldn't even fathom just what the fuck was even going on at this point, but I quickly calmed down and decided to just play a different game. Installing and opening Sonic Mania, and opening my completed savefile to Green Hill, just wanting to do literally anything else but play that level again...

"SONIC * MANIA - WACKY WORKBENCH ZONE - ACT âˆž"

No
No no no no no no no no, no no no no no no
NO NO
FUCK
WHY
HOW
WHY IS THIS
FUCKING
HAPPENING TO ME

I screamed, like, at the top of my lungs as I was damn sure I was going mad. I felt hopeless, like I was gonna be stuck playing this zone for the rest of my life, but then I thought, why don't I just play on my console, surely that won't be HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I can't even finish that sentence. I think all my 2D Sonic games across any platform I got are just done for, so hey let's play Sonic Forces, it sucks but surely it's immune, right? ...right?

No. All the levels on the world map just said that they were "Wacky Workbench". Even the modern ones. 3D versions of Wacky Workbench that never existed, but here I sit seeing evidence of them before my very eyes. Every game. Every  FUCKING GAME god  god why   why. oh fuck this I'm going to bed I can't deal with this, maybe I'll feel better in the morning.




Do I even need to say what my dreams were? It was just that Round over and over, I woke up multiple times during the night only to drift back off, that same dream continuing over and over. When I turned on my computer, it just went straight to Wacky Workbench so I unplugged it, but it didn't stop. I tried going outside, but when I looked through the front door all I could see was Wacky Workbench. I noticed a gun on the living room table that belonged to my father, and without hesitation I pressed it to my head and pulled the trigger. It just clicked, nothing came out. I checked the magazine and it was just pull of pictures of Wacky Workbench. I should probably feel lucky that it didn't work, but I didn't feel lucky.

I slumped down onto the floor and sobbed as all I could hear was the Present music for Wacky Workbench.

It has never been more over than it is now.
