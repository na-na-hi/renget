#Jan’s Wish

Jan and Marissa sat atop a sandy dune in Area C. A flickering fire kept the chill at bay. Night had fallen and Marissa’s familiars kept a tight cordon as Jan rested. While Marissa thought of the best approach to manipulating the other competitors to her own ends, Jan busied herself flinging small flecks of sand into the fire.

Marissa studied her servant. She knew precious little about Jan Žižka. She knew he—she was a Czech hero that had somehow managed to fight off the entire Holy Roman Empire plus every fool willing to answer the call of the Cross, twice. She had been aware that Jan was an option to be summoned, but didn’t think she’d be the one to actually answer her.

“I feel your stare.”

Marissa flinched as Jan’s single blue eye locked onto her lilac eyes.

“You have question?”

“If I did I’d ask.”

“I have a question.”

Marissa snorted. So that’s what sparked this frivolous exchange? “Ask.”

“What is the lady’s wish?”

Marissa frowned. Her eyes wandering into the fire. “Why would you care?”

“I don’t.” Jan acknowledged. “But the night is cold and I’d rather not dwell on the inadequacies of this meager fire built of my horses leavings.”

“Well if you must-- wait, of what?!”

“… what did you think I made the fire out of?” Jan motioned around her indicating the sandy expanse. “Do you spy a tree?”

Marissa’s eye twitched as she stared into the fire, the dark lump at the center sent a shiver up her spine. She shook her head, desperate to forget the suddenly unmistakable smell. 

“I seek the power of my rivals.” Marissa answered, deciding there was no harm in revealing that much.

“Ah, turn the strength of your enemies against them? A good strategy.”

“More or less, what of you? What is your wish?”

“To seal my noble phantasm.”

Marissa sputtered. “You mean to seal your own strength?!”

“Ne.” Jan answered in Czech. “I mean to free my men from my weakness.”

Marissa laughed. She’d gotten a foolish servant. “You know those aren’t actually your men yes? They’re no more than copies.”

“Ano, but they bare their image.” Jan stared into the fire. “When I lay dying I made a foolish wish. I wished I could lead my men after death.” Jan frowned. “It seems that wish was granted. Now my men, my poor beloved faithful peace-loving fools that followed me to defend their homeland, seem to follow me for love of battle. It is not right.”

Jan looked up to the sky. Her tone changed. She spoke like she’d gone to live among the stars, that she was an outside observer that saw herself for what she was. “Jan is the one who loves battle. Jan is the one too weak to refuse the call. Jan is the one who cannot help but summon her men so that she may taste victory once more.”

Jan plummeted back to earth. “My men did not love battle. They were wonderful, faithful, boys who fought for Bohemia. Their memory should not be victim to my weakness.”

Marissa was silent at that. She couldn’t understand such a stupid hangup. To waste a grail’s wish just because the images of your men might be seen as loving battle? Marissa saw that as nothing but foolish. But… at least it wasn’t a wish that would interfere with her plans. “I think it’s a waste, but so long as you don’t hesitat--”

Jan barked a laugh. “Weren’t you listening girl?” Jan smiled. She met Marissa’s eyes through the flickering flame. “Jan is weak. She will fight.”
