# Sanctify - V2

Sanctify is a set of cards to create a generalist RPG, using fun HTML to create interactive messages. Sanctify is a backbone to facilitate a story, NOT a story maker. Things happen in Sanctify, not because of it. With that said, have fun!

Disable once finished with character creation. | Enable once finished with character creation. Make sure to enable your jailbreak in the prompt manager, and make sure the jailbreak is empty. | Fancy status monitor. From my testing, only works on non-chromium browsers. Enable once character creation is finished. Feel free to disable for a few messages each time to save tokens. | Simple battle system. Only enable when in a battle. | Image cover for the group. Also the original Sanctify card, if you want to import it and see how this used to be done.
