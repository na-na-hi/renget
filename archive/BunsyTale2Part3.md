#Bunsy the bunny in Summer isn't Everything. (PT3)
##Despite everything, it still features Riley the Racoon

**Spagonia, South West 16:34 Riley perspective**

In the span of 2 minutes, a robot has caught the Racoon before she could react in time, it had a directive to prison intruders and in the the circumstances of attempted hacking, **choking them to their cell**.
However on their way to put Riley in cell, an explosion happend in the gas tubes, leading the robot to get a quick decommision, and some systems being broken, Allowing cells to open up, a lot of beach goers who were imprisoned looked out in the events and eventually witnessed a fellow who they think they were trying to save them.
They help Riley get up, and drops the snarky comment:
R:"You called that chocking?" *cough cough* "My brothers could strangle me harder."
Afterwards she notices the beach goers.
R:"Oh shit i nearly forgot you guys were there... uhh..."
The beachgoers didn't understood what she was saying, but one of them spoke up.
BG:"You... uhh... girl... are, you ok?"
R:"Oh... right you guys don't understand me, uhhh... Yes, me fine, give 1 second."
BG:"ok..."
R:"Tails, respond are you there?"
==T:" My signal with you is slightly damaged but i can hear you Riley, what happend?"==
R:"A big green robot shaped like an hourglass choked me into the cells but an explosion destroyed the robot and the bars of the cells, the prisoners are fine."
==T:"That's good news, there are drop pods in the area for the robots but they can be repurposed for multiple people to get out of the area!"==
R:"There is a problem tails, I don't speak spagonian."
==T:"Il got you covered, amp up the volume of the walkie talkie if you can, il send the message in doubles"==
*A TTS Voice reads out loud in spagonian to the beachgoers to go the drop pods to escape the area 2 times in a row*
The beachgoers thank Riley and Tails (Or rather mostly tails because they have heard of him.) and head to the drop pods.
With no time to waste Riley heads to the Internals and starts planting the bomb.

**Spagonia, South West 16:36 Riley perspective**

The distraction that bunsy has set has built enough commotion in the robots that they stopped aiming to Bunsy, as such, Bunsy succeeds on entering
the wheelhouse after doing a big jump and after a couple of tries that is.
==T:"Bunsy status report? are you ok?"==
B:"I am fine, you picked a good moment to come in, i am about to set in the USB."
==T:"Should be great timing, i helped riley on getting the prisoners out of the Eggcarrier, the access port should be close to the wheel!"==
As bunsy heads to the wheel and start looking for an access port, she hears footsteps.
E:"So this is the one who has been giving me trouble."
Bunsy looks arround and sees the Doctor Eggman, alone... with a flamethrower.
E:"Funny how the tables have turned, have they ..."
Bunsy does a gest of "DUDE I HAVE A 8 YEAR OLD IN THE FUCKING WALKIE TALKIE, CALL ME BY PROPER NAME"
E:*Clears throat* "Uhh Bunsy... yes it was your name, i was mistaking you for someone else."
==T:"Eggman?! What is the meaning of this?"==
E:"Oh it's quite simple you 2 tailed fox, i just needed a break from the events that were unfolding, and i though that Spagonian beaches were a nice place to relax."
B:"But why kick everyone else out of the beach?... actually i know why, but Why Couldn't you choose a deserted island instead, wouldn't that be more calming?"
E:"The site of uncivilized land that isn't roboticized wasn't going to fit, but the site of a civilized and technologically inferior land would have been a good way to inspire me, get my though in order, and then build a theme park around it! besides if i were to stick a deserted island, Sonic would be there bugging me even more."
==T:"...Are you serious with this?"==
==S:"I do that all the time."==
==T:"Sonic, did you just return from holoska?"==
==S:"Yup, those bots from eggma'am were tough but not tough enough."==
E:"**ENOUGH WITH THAT COPY CAT! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR HER NAME EVER AGAIN!!!**"
*Eggman goes from angry to Fuming mad, which doesn't mean anything to Bunsy.*
B:"And i don't want your annoying mustache bugging me about working on your commisions, but we both can't have nice things, can we?"
E:"... You better work on those commisions or i am going to have Bunny roast with Omelettes."
R:"Funny you say that..."
*Riley enters the wheelhouse through the staircase looking smug to the silent surprise of Bunsy and the confusion of eggman.*
R:"I was planning to have one **Hard** boiled egg for lunch... or Dinner."
*Silence fills the room making his confused maddening expression into Frustration*
E:"... Do i know you?"
R:"Maybe..."
While Eggman is distracted, Bunsy looks for the Access port.
E:"And what makes you think i do?"
R:"Does the words Roscoe robotics, ring any bells to you."
E:"...mhh.... Oh yeah... i wanted to own that company but it was a long time ago... now i don't care about it much anymore, but what has it with you?"
R:"YOU FUCKING KILLED MY FATHER AND MY BROTHERS TRYING TO GATHER THE OWNERSHIP YOU ROTTEN THAN A DEAD CHICKEN PIECE OF SHIT."
E:"oh oh oh, did i touched a nerve?" 
Eggman exclaims with smug sarcasm.
R:"You won't be laughing after seeing what i have in my hand..."
*Riley shows off the Detonator to the explosives*
E:"Oh, how amusing, were you the one who caused the recent damaged to the eggcarrier back then?"
B:"Oh that? that was me..." 
*Bunsy exclaims as she deploys the USB*
B:"But what my patner has is something that has a little bit more punch than what you would expect."
E:"And what did you put inside my egg carrier controlls."
==T:"Oh that? a firmware update."==
B:"RILEY, NOW OR NEVER!"
E:"WHAT?!"
*as soon as Bunsy gave the signal, Riley Triggers the explosives to the internals of the ship, causing it to begin crashing into the water.*
*While the tremors of the explosion started to begin, Bunsy shoots a way out of the Wheelhouse windows, while Riley decides to drop a cheap shot at the doctor by a sweep of the legs, impeeding him to attack Bunsy and Riley.*
*Once outside of the wheelhouse, they run on getting a parachute each to get out of the ship as it was heading down the water*

*after a landing in the water and swimming to the shores, both Bunsy and Riley return on the spagonian beach, tired as all hell, however the beachgoers arrive just in time to celebrate with them as a thanks from saving them from the EggCarrier and getting rid of it along with the robots, who there were no sign of or even Cubot and Orbot either. regardless our heroes decided to enjoy the sun for the hard day they faced*
*After an 2 hour tails arrives in the area and heads to Bunsy and Riley to congratulate them.*
T:"You 2 did a good job on stopping eggman, even if it didn't come out as planned!"
B:"Thanks Tails, we are also fine too."
*Tails giggles to Bunsy Comment*
T:"Oh and Riley, i am sorry to hear about what happend with Roscoe Robotics i didn't know eggman was that evil that early on."
R:"Oh i appreciate your thoughs Tails, but the one here apologizing is me, i shoud've watched my language back there."
T:"Oh it's ok, it happens all the time, Just maybe don't take this as a road to revenge, as much as many heinous crimes eggman did, aiming to kill him will make you loose you more than what you have lost already..."
R:"...You know tails... i think you should also keep your nose outside of where it shouldn't be, but i appreciate the tip."
T:"Fair point then, Oh and by the way, let me know when you 2 need a ride back home!"
B:"We will thank you!"


**Ocean, Middle of nowhere 18:00**
O:"Dr.Eggman, after analyzing the firmware update, they changed the directives of the ship along with it's robots to to be drowing in the ocean, and there is no way we can recover any of them back."
E:"I am not that surprised, good thing i limit my controll in situations like these."
C:"It's such a shame that the egg carrier got destroyed, it looked kind of cool."
E:"Eh, i can rebuild thousand of these in no time at all, this events that have happend in the spun of an hour have been a much needed way unrust my gears after so what has happend before."
O:"So let me guess, are we going to counterattack soon enough?"
E:"Soon is a big word to say, but as a certain rabbit as taught me, art takes time and when the time will come, we will deliver something much more menacing."
C:"What about those unidentified threads? shouldn't we be worried about them?"
E:"Not that much, they may be well equipped but for what i have in mind, they won't be a problem for me to deal with."
*Eggman begins giggling, followed for some laughts and then erupts into an evil laugh as they reach a deserted island in the distance*
