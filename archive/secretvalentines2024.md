##HOW IT WORKS
1. **Botmakers submit themselves as recipients. ***THE DEADLINE FOR THIS IS JANUARY 31.*****
Send the following to [robosaintv@proton.me](mailto:robosaintv@proton.me):
> What I'd like to be known as:  *(Your usual handle or just a psuedonym unique to yourself. Something where an anon can say "this bot is for [INSERT NAME HERE]" and you'll know that it's you.)*
> My chub/rentry/neocities/other, if applicable: *(A plaintext link is preferable over a hyperlink, here. Make it easy to copy-paste. You don't have to link something if you don't want to, but it'll help your botmaker know you better.)*
> What type of bot I'd prefer to make: *(Maybe you're great at malebots, or really like writing foxes? Maybe you're actually into various more niche or undesirable fetishes, and would have fun writing NTR?)*
> What type of bot I'd prefer NOT to make: *(e.g. NSFW, SFW, malebots, loli, furry, NTR.)*
> What type of bot I want to get as a present: *(Try to be a bit more specific than just "cute girl, please", as there were complaints about vague prompts during the secret santa. Try to think about how you'd react if told to make a bot following the same request. ***THIS WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOUR VALENTINE WITHOUT EDITING.***)*
> What Large Language Model you typically use, if important: *(Usually one of Claude, GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4, or various local language models. This lets the botmaker know whether or not they can include complex logic, what context size to aim for, and so on.)* 
Clean template:
> What I'd like to be known as: 
> My chub/rentry/neocities/other, if applicable: 
> What type of bot I'd prefer to make: 
> What type of bot I'd prefer NOT to make: 
> What type of bot I want to get as a present: 
> What Large Language Model you typically use, if important: 
You can write more than that if you want, but unless specified otherwise it's for the robo-saint's eyes only. Please make sure to include the template somewhere, though, or your application will be discarded.
Again, **the deadline for getting in is January 31.** You'll need time to make your bots, and two weeks should be more than enough.
2. **Robo-Saint V figures out who gets who as their valentine.**
Currently the plan is that this won't be *completely* random. The robo-saint will try to match people up with bots they'd actually like to make and, more importantly, keep people away from the bots they *don't* want to make.
3. **The botmakers who submitted get a return email from the robo-saint.**
The email will contain the name of the person you're gifting to, their request (verbatim), as well as their chub/rentry/etc. so you get a better idea of what they're into. Note that Protonmail has a 50/day email limit, so getting the emails out might take a little while.
It'll look something like this:
>**Name**: Robo-Saint V
>**Sites**: https://rentry.org/secretvalentines2024
>**Models**: Built-in MoE GPT-4.5-Turbo/Claude 2.4 implementation
>**Request**:
>> I'd be fine with almost anything, but I'd really like a cute girl with *massive* stacks of RAM and a fat triple-fan GPU who's excited to make some bots with me. I wouldn't mind a greeting that skips straight to the assembly line, but the default one should probably be something like a meet-cute in Robot Maths Class.
If a requests end up being a bit too vague, Robo-Saint V will do its best to calculate some extra suggestions for you. Don't be afraid to send a mail to [robosaintv@proton.me](mailto:robosaintv@proton.me) and ask for help if you get stuck!
4. **Botmakers make bots according to the specifications.**
You've got a bit more than a week to do this, so don't get too extravagant in your plans.
5. **On Valentine's Day, February 14, the botmakers post their gifts in the threads!**
Write who the gift is for so that they know. To try to avoid drama and gossip shitting up the threads, the robo-saint would prefer if you posted anonymously and *didn't* say who you were.
4chan strips metadata from posted images, so *remember to post a link to the bot on an external website.* To upload files anonymously, use [catbox](https://catbox.moe/) or simply set the upload as anonymous on [chub.ai](https://www.chub.ai/). (Note that the latter still lets you see all the downloads and reviews on your personal profile view, so you won't miss out on that number-based dopamine.)
Bots posted during Valentine's Day will be listed below.

Wait until Valentine's Day!

##Q&A
###Newcomers
**I'm not a botmaker, can I join?**
Sure thing! This is a great way to flex your writing muscles and get started. If you're unsure how to write bots, study the bots you like and check the /aicg/ OP for some guides and tools.
###Deadlines
**What are the deadlines?**
Applying to be a part of this: [Wednesday January 31, 23:59 UTC-12](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/valentines?iso=20240131T235959&p0=3399&msg=Secret+Valentine+Entry+Deadline&font=cursive&csz=1).
Robo-Saint V figuring out who gets who and sending out emails: within 24 hours of the last applications, hopefully.
Posting your bots: during Valentine's Day, February 14. Don't post your bots before Valentine's Day!
**What timezone are we counting for Valentine's Day?**
From 00:00 UTC+14 to 23:59 UTC-12, if it's Valentine's Day *somewhere* then it counts. Try to post when it's Valentine's Day in your local area.
**Are late applications allowed?**
Botmakers need time to write bots, so unfortunately that won't be allowed.
###Requesting Bots
**Should I expect high-quality gifts?**
No. Expect homemade chocolate from someone's who's never done it before. Set your sights low and you might get pleasantly surprised, but don't get disappointed if it's worse than store-bought chocolate. What matters is that it was made with love.
**What if I ask for something nobody wants to make?**
The robo-saint will send some emails back to see if you have alternative requests. If you seem genuine but can't find something more appropriate then the robo-saint might slop out something themselves, but if you're a troll you'll just be excluded. (Don't expect high-quality bots if the robo-saint has to make them, though, especially if it needs to make several of them.)
**What makes for a good request?**
>Honestly, that's a tricky one. You want something that gives the botmaker actual inspiration and direction, so I'd say that at minimum you need a hook.
>"Hot girl" is uselessly broad. "Hot MILF" is a slightly narrower niche. "Hot MILF mother" gives an instant hook through the established relationship with the user and associated clichÃ©s. "Hot MILF mother wants to join you in the shower" has character, relationship, and a half-decent suggestion for the initial scenario/greeting.
>Generally you also want to consider what you DON'T want from your greeting. Consider the "Hot Milf mother" request, with nothing else. How would you feel about {{user}} being underage there? Would you prefer a shrill domineering mother, or a gently comforting one? Did you actually have an opinion on her appearance, or your family status - is Dad around?
>The botmaker writing for you will ultimately have to make a lot of judgement calls, probably by reading through your rentry/chub and thinking long and hard about what types of bots you seem to enjoy making (and perhaps playing). If they ask for a mommybot, for instance, they might check your chub to find that it's full of femdom - that sets some thoughts in motion.
>One thing you could do is to take a step back and imagine what type of character you would write if YOU got the request. Then do it again, but try to make different choices at every step and figure out where the botmaking could go "wrong". Work to reduce the odds of unpleasant surprises but leave space for pleasant ones.
>Focus on the important things, the details that you actually want.
>Odds are that most requests are going to be either frustratingly vague or annoyingly specific, so who knows. I'm not sure that I know myself.
###Making bots
**Help, the request I got is too vague!**
Go check out their links, if possible, and see what types of bots they've written that feel similar. When in doubt, assume the more "normie" option. If they wanted something "weird", they'd probably ask for that.
###Bad actors
**What if I'm an asshole and don't give a gift?**
You'll be publicly named and shamed for it, while the person who got snubbed will probably get some make-up gifts from other anons.
**What if I'm not an asshole, I just got unexpectedly busy and couldn't make it in time?**
Send an email to the robo-saint (robosaintv@proton.me) and they'll tell your valentines what's going on.
###Matchmaking
**Will the person I gift to be the person making a bot for me?**
No, it'll hopefully be a big ring of people giving gifts to one another (or possibly some smaller rings, if the preferences don't line up nicely).
**But I wanted a cute couple gimmick!**
To quote an anon, "everyone making bots for each other on Valentine's Day is extremely cringe and is a recipe for disaster."
So to avoid that, it's just a Secret Santa run two months later since there was an outcry of FOMO after Christmas.
###Miscellaneous
**Are you the anon who ran [/aicg/ Secret Santa 2023](https://rentry.org/botmakersecretsanta)?**
No, the robo-saint is just inspired by our jolly friend.
**Are you a botmaker?**
Yes, but probably not one you've thought of much. The robo-saint won't be participating unless it needs to.
**Can I ask you a question?**
Sure! Send it to [robosaintv@proton.me](mailto:robosaintv@proton.me).
