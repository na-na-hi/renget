Nishtar is an opportunist at heart. A few parlor tricks and honeyed words secured her place in court, acting more as entertainment than anything. When her lord died all it took was showing off a fancy shawl (though getting that had taken some greased palms and knives in the back) to take his place in the peoples' eyes. The emperor's death is just another opportunity she won't ignore.

For her, the throne is like a rare jewel. She could very well live on without it, but she doesn't see any reason why it shouldn't be hers. Despite her less-than-altruistic reasoning, she's set her sights on earning favor by enriching her homeland and the rest of Tamriel.

!!! info General Plan & Methodology 
	Schmooze and endear herself while playing nice with anyone willing to parlay. Nishtar is trying to present herself as a safe option by promoting public works and taking whatever opportunity she can to portray herself as a hero. If possible, she'll try to make good candidates look bad and bad candidates look worse )and if she thinks she can get away with it, get rid of them entirely). With her pursuit of the throne being more of a vanity project than anything, her interest and plans for it are malleable. She's open to the ideas of allies and may even settle for being a "trusted companion of the emperor" if she finds a competitor too risky to eliminate and her desire for adoration adequately met.

>Agents 
Anahita: A Sword Saint, and estranged Nishtar's sister. Although they suffered the same cruel upbringing, their lives would take very different paths While Anahita would escape their fate and make a name for herself as a tool of justice, Nishtar (from her perspective) was left to rot and would only escape after honing her skills as a killer. As word spread of the other's deed, each would become warier of reuniting and only did so shortly after Nishtar organized her court and sent a formal invitation to the saint.

Although embittered by feelings of abandonment and having to make the first move, Nishtar's feelings for her sister are more complicated than pure indignation. She seeks to prove herself superior and win the approval of her sister - ideally while enjoying even greater renown. Anahita is simultaneously relieved that the sister she knew is not unrecognizable and dismayed at how easily she's slipped into the role of manipulator. She's sworn not to abandon Nishtar's side again but also hopes to serve as a guiding star and steer her away from her worse impulses.
!!! info Role
	Bodyguard and Champion. While not strictly necessary, she prefers to stay relatively close to Nishtar and act defensively against attempts to interrupt her plans.

Dar'saahni: A "friend" of Nishtar met during her time as a blade in the dark. She may not be as steadfast as Anahita, but she still answered the call and Nishtar considers her no less of a sister of sorts. It wouldn't be exactly true to call their friendship a falsehood, it was initially born of convenience and their bond has stayed one of mutual benefit. One might wonder how such a relationship isn't plagued with doubts, but both find the honesty in their intentions quite liberating.
!!! info Role
	Spymaster and Assassin. Focused on Intelligence gathering and disseminating misinformation about rivals while making sure every great deed of Nishtar is widely known.
