Joseph Goebbels:
>The greater the number of Jews liquidated, the more consolidated will the situation in Europe be after this war.
-03/06/1942

>The procedure is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only about 40 per cent can be used for forced labor.
-03/27/1942

>Short shrift is made of the Jews in all eastern occupied areas. Tens of thousands of them are liquidated.
-04/29/1942

>At bottom, however, I believe both the English and the Americans are happy that we are exterminating the Jewish riff-raff.
-12/13/1942

>We are now definitely pushing the Jews out of Berlin... On the Jewish question, especially, we have taken a position from which there is no escape.
-03/02/1943

>Hitler approved of my measures and specifically ordered me to make Berlin entirely free of Jews.
-03/09/1943

>There is therefore no other recourse left for modern nations except to exterminate the Jew.
-05/13/1943
