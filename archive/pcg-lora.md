# Phase Connect models
!!! note
    I'll add example prompts/activation tags (that I know of) to the files that have only have catbox uploads available.

- V2

-> ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/qn5ri9.png) <-
   > from OP: *"The most flexible I can get it while still having it remain mostly accurate. I'll keep an eye out for all the art she gets and try to slowly work a better one out, but that'll take time for artists to give me more art. The paizuri hole and double buns have sadly become a casualty some of the time. Prompting them fixes it though."*
!!! info Example Prompt
    kaneko lumi, blonde hair, hair bun, double bun, blue eyes, long hair, star hair ornament, halo

- V3

-> ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/zp2s01.png) <-
> from OP: *"New Lumi lora. Good accuracy with high flexibility, typically only really needs "black star hair ornament" added since it likes to make that yellow like her old model. Otherwise, gets her normal outfit done well with minimal conflict with other outfits, and doesn't put her in "streamer pose" nearly as often if at all so long as you're not just prompting her completely plain. If she is missing anything just prompt it and it appears with very good accuracy. Took so long since I wasn't rushing to get one done as fast as the first few, plus the limited dataset (Thank you to Lumi for tweeting more art of hers since I asked her, it helped a lot) and minor adjustments required to get it just right were micro heavy. This should largely satisfy everyone, especially Lumi. WILL occasionally generate Gloomi, albeit rarely. Just ignore that."*

# Phase Invaders - Second Wave
!!! warning
    Another anon has created a rentry for the LoRAs they've trained on Ember, Dizzy, and Jelly. It includes the proper prompts for each member.

    There were two made, first link being the most recent. I haven't compared the two, though. The activation token for the second link is Himemiya_Rie

##Amanogawa Shiina

-> ![Image description](https://i.imgur.com/pVO5yao.png) <-
> from OP: *"The BREAKS are a tag weighting trick, but I find I get better results with them. Mess with prompt weights as needed. The Lora seems to function pretty well between .5 and .7 weight. I think it's more likely to add the stars in her hair on higher weights. It also loves to put the bow on her neck, but it can be removed via negative prompting collared shirt and purple bow. Also the Scissors hair ornament is pretty RNG. I haven't got it to generate her giant scissors yet either."*
-> https://files.catbox.moe/miviiw.safetensors <-
!!! info Example Prompt
    amanogawa shiina, blue eyes, (blonde hair, very long hair, bangs, white hair bow, hair ornament), BREAK 
    small breasts, revealing clothes, (transparent crotch veil, black panties), dress, detached sleeves, exposed stomach, navel, ribbon

##Makina Erina
!!! note
    Just found out that there was another Erina LoRA uploaded to civitai. Haven't tested it, but I heard it's more flexible than the first link.
