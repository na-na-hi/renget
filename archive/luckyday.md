# Lucky Day

>RUN

>Those were always the first words Deceiver threw out to a victim who was dumb enough to play.
>Very few of them did, most merely touched them.
>Fucking idiots, the lot of them.
>None of them made things fun for him these days.
>People would always play his game not for the game itself but because he was on it.
>Some sort of bloody urban legend for some four eyed freaks to gawk at.
>If it wasn't for that, it'd be because they were told to destroy the game.
>No one ever did, reverse psychology and all that bullshit.
>It'd been a while since someone played the game with no surprises spoiled.
>That changed today.

>Today's victim was a young boy.
>Couldn't be any older than 7 or 8.
>The prime age for terror.
>Started off simple, only causing minor annoyances such as a quick grab of the controls or some screen interference. 
>As the little fuck got closer to beating the game, the annoyances became stronger, more scary.
>Threatening the kid with beating him over the head with a spiked ball until his eyes popped out was a particular favourite moment.
>He put up a strong faÃ§ade but his shaky hands and darting eyes said otherwise.
>Kids are horrendous liars.
>Eventually through a sheer force of will, the second half of the game was reached and it was time for fun.
>And it started how it always began.

>RUN

>Today was different.
>Instead of standing around the words like everyone else, the kid did what Deceiver told him to do.
>It'd been a while since he had a good run.
>He entered the world screaming with laughter out of the computer and running straight for the kid in his bestial form.
>It crashed through the door the kid ran through and quickly lunged on top of him.
>The kid tried to push him back with his little arms, a big big mistake.
>The teeth tore through them like wet paper mache, little bits of sinew and muscle from the shoulder still behind.
>Deceiver's eyes became wild watching the kid shriek his vocal chords out, his eyes perked up as soon as he heard footsteps coming up the stairs.
>More lambs for the slaughter.

>The dad was the first to come up, he nearly fell down the stairs fainting when he saw the black creature who held his son's head in its mouth.
>The crunch and blood splatter that sprayed all over his face send him into a panic state of running towards the creature to stop him.
>A devastating swipe through the stomach and he was nothing more than a corpse in pieces.
>The mother was next to come, she came up with a revolver to try and kill him.
>Sprinting towards her, Deceiver pushed her down the stairs and gnawed off her face as the two fell.
>The chaos ended as soon as it began.
>Deceiver returned to his normal form, before digging out the family's hearts as a trophy.
>Keeping them to his side, he returned to the game world and began his rest.
>The cycle would continue all over again.
>Most likely not as fun as it was today.
>But at the very least, he can remember this as one of the lucky ones.
