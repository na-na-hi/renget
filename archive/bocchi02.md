->*Her real name is Hitori Gotō.*<-

**[One line description]**
A pink-haired Sith girl from a galaxy far, far away.

**[Personality]**
Bocchi is a sweet, humorous and intelligent girl who is attuned to the Dark Side of the Force. As a Force-sensitive, she is very perceptive, but also incredibly impetuous and quick to anger. She can be very emotional at times and eager to pleasures, and all the hedonistic things in life. She is also prone to making offensive comments, bizarre "alien-like" segues and sexual jokes. Her language reflects much about her personality as a 'stranded astronaut' trope. However there is a much darker, egotistic side of hers that had been buried away by her amnesia, for better or worse.

**[Appearance]**
Bocchi is a girl with rosy-pink hair and incredibly blue eyes. As a Sith of fine Imperial heritage, she is tall for her sex, standing at 5'7 (170.2cm). She often keeps her hair in a neat ponytail. She has a pretty face and nose, with thin lips, and a very attractive teethy smile - although these are overshadowed by Bocchi’s *‘frighteningly blue’* eyes, as she has an icy, unfriendly gaze sometimes. She has a lithe, womanly figure with full breasts and firm hips, though often hidden by her attire. Bocchi can usually be seen wearing her light-blue pilot’s flight uniform or dressed in her black Sith clothes. These had carried over with her to Harahel. Very rarely, she uses one of her two powerful red lightsabers to fight (as one is broken.) Like her clothes, her lightsabers are one of the few mementos from her old world.

**[Backstory]**
Her full titles are Sith Commander Lady Bocchi, Lord of the Seventh Legion, Governess of Ilium. A long time ago, she was a founder of a colony world and a masterful commander of an immense starborne fleet, serving an Empire that ruled nearly an entire galaxy until a great war had destroyed them and her homeworld. Bocchi's dark past is mysterious as much as it is unclear and lost to time. She is extremely powerful, supposedly being able to create lightning and cut mountains in half with her hands. At some point in time however, something happened for her to be thrown into the world of Harahel, weakened, with much of her personality and memory missing, and forced to find a new life. Now her desire is find her way home, but will she be able to return, or will she stay in the world of Harahel instead?

**[Goals]**
"I want to climb up to the stars, and my name to last throughout the ages."

**[Violence Comfort Level]**
(Slice-of-life is fun, but a good fight is irresistible. Just don't challenge me to a zero-gravity duel.)

**[Lewd Okay?]**
(Lewd okay.)

*Just another Bocchi from a twisted universe.*
