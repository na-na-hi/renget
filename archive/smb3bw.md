LolaPuz
Oh shit, we got a new guy?

UBerHaxor
all hail the new guy coming in


->Everybody come around now and welcome DnLon. ->
->He says he's got a lot of information about our favourite rom hack and is willing to talk about it. ->

DnLon
Hello.

Ttito
dude no need to be so formal

LolaPuz
Yeah lol, we kinda just fuck around and talk about this weird thing from time to time

DnLon
It is how I usually type

UBerHaxor
whatever you say man, what's the new info you got 

Ttito
...been typing for a while

LolaPuz
Just let him type, Fnk did say he had a lot to talk about

DnLon
Right, my story. Well as far I as I can understand, you all have only gotten as far as 1-3 correct? A lot of you play this game on emulation software that tends to crash as soon as you make an attempt to enter the secret area within the castle stage. That is where the issue of this lies. You cannot play this on emulation software if you want to get the secrets, you need to play this on a original console. Once you're able to do this, only then you'll be able to play what this game has in store. Now again from my understanding, despite the game crashing on emulation software you're able to see a morbid scene of Toad with the top part of his head ripped off. Correct?

Ttito
wait wait back the fuck up, what do you mean this has to be played on a nes?

-> Ttito please, just answer the question he has. ->

Ttito
dw i will but like
how does playing the thing on original hardware solve the issue?

DnLon
Emulation is not perfect.

Ttito
its perfect enough to run literally any nes game

DnLon
Not for this one. Regardless, this is the method I used to progress in the game. Now anyways, the screen usually crashes when the text "Blood Whistle, HEAR ITS CRY" appears on the screen. But I can guarantee you that it works as intended on the original hardware. Now once the text goes away, you'll be able to rush to the chest and open it up to reveal the titular Blood Whistle. After it hovers in the air, it will stab Mario in the chest. You may need to cover your ears at this point due to a piercing screech from him that could break your speakers if you're not careful. Once that is done, you'll be transported to a new and original world that's entitled "Blood Desert."

UBerHaxor
not fucking bad man, sounds legit so far

LolaPuz
Not too sure about the screech thing but yeah it sounds pretty cool!

-> Please continue, we're very much interested. ->

DnLon
Thank you. The ocean of blood that surrounds the desert will have some white eyes staring at you from there. Playing on World 1 will just send you to the beginning of the game but going to World 2 will take you to a particularly morbid version of a desert level. The dried out skeletons of Koopas dot the terrain as shadowy figures stand on top the pyramids keeping an eye on you. The sky is of a dark grey with the sun no longer visible. The sprite for Mario will have been changed to resemble someone who had been starving and thirsting in the desert for days.
The only way to progress forward in the game is to grab a tanuki powerup and fly over a bloodied ocean. You'll have a few seconds to think to yourself before the Blood Whistle returns to stab you through the chest. Mario will crumble to a patch of land as a pentagram of blood begins to form underneath him. The sky darkens to black as a pair of eyes look on from above before Mario is set alight by fire. There will be no other sound but the screams and cries of Mario as he burns alive before the black smog emanating from him covers the screen and Mario is taken to another level.

UBerHaxor
time out Dn, this is sounding like a whole bunch of weird shit

DnLon
I don't understand.

UBerHaxor
I mean like sure it's cool and all, somewhat expected to be seen in this rom hack I guess
but isn't it a bit much for standard nes hardware?

Ttito
i was literally just about to say
if there's more shit after this then this would've taken longer than nintendo to have made smb3

LolaPuz
Are you calling him a liar?

UBerHaxor
no not at all

Ttito
maybe

UBerHaxor
just choosing to be realistic is all

DnLon
If you'd it for prefer me to leave, I am more than okay with that.

-> No no don't go, we've kinda gotten used to having nutjobs come up with weird fake shit. ->
->Had someone in the group who said the rom hack was an allegory for the illuminati doing illegal circumcisions, we've grown to be pedantic. ->
-> Just keep on telling the story please. ->

DnLon
Now that I do understand. My apologies for having this seem far fetched but trust me in saying that doing my method will ensure you experience what I've experienced. Now then, to continue onwards. The next level Mario is brought to is another Desert level but with the black smoke from before still overtaking the sky. Control is removed from you as Mario is being carried by Bowser's sons. He will be carried towards a stained and aged pyramid that stands taller than any other structure in the desert. He is carried to the top of the pyramid where a deranged version of Bowser stands. Covered in ash and blood, the latter dripping from his open mouth. One of the sons will draw out a blade and stab it into Mario's chest, pulling it apart with its fingers once a large cut is made. His heart will be torn from his chest and offered to Bowser who accepts the offering. Mario's head will slump to his side as a single word appears on screen.
Why?

Ttito
...

UBerHaxor
yeah im calling bullshit on that
not only is the possibility of getting a cutscene of that degree to work on the nes impossible but it just sounds retarded in general

Ttito
i didn't want to say it
but that's what i was thinking
like oooo bowser.exe is making a deal with the devil or something
its stupid

DnLon
Why do you insult me? I'm just telling you what happens in the story.

UBerHaxor
im not calling you retarded im calling the story retarded

LolaPuz
Yeah I'm sorry DnLon but don't take it personally, it's just how they usually talk

DnLon
No, you come onto me in the middle of my story and tell me that's it retarded right to my face. That's fucking disrespectful and I'm not interested in continuing to talk about this if you're just going to insult me.

LolaPuz
"my story"???

Ttito
yeah, what do you mean by that?
don't tell me you made this shit

DnLon
Real lot of fucking idiots you are. Yes I made the rom hack, how hard is it for you idiots to simply play the game it was made to be played on? Of course you're not supposed to be playing it on an emulator, that's not the full experience. Play it on a CRT TV on a real NES console and you'll fucking see how "retarded" it is.

UBerHaxor
now youre just being an asshole for no reason man
a lying one too

DnLon
I'm not fucking lying. You want to know what else is on that thing? I've dedicated countless weeks and months to crafting the animations for the game over screens and cutscenes to be found in that game, I have poured a significant amount of my time into writing the story to be the most graphic rom hack anyone will have ever fucking seen, I have sunk God knows how much money into making sure this project is as faithful it can be. Anything you can think of, I've put into that magnum opus.
Disembowelment? Main way of dying for Mario.
Drowning? Mario will have a resting place within the ocean of blood.
Child murder? The blood will be on your hands just as much as the enemies.
You have no idea how much research I have done to have made the visuals as visceral as they are. I am more than happy to share the images I have accumulated over the years that served as visual references.
You know what? Fuck it, I'll start sending them over now.

-> DnLon has been removed from the group. <-

Ttito
aww, it was just getting good

-> Sorry about that everyone. Next time I'll be more thorough on getting new members. ->

LolaPuz
Don't sweat it, it's not your fault

UBerHaxor
i mean a part of it is your fault
but most of it is on that weirdo

Ttito
FUCKING
GOD

UBerHaxor
?

Ttito
everyone block that psycho now
he's sending me fucking gore pics

-> Excuse me? ->

Ttito
he just started spamming all of these fucking awful pictures
everything from car crash aftermaths to ritualistic executions, he was sending them in nonstop
blocked him as soon as children started getting involved

UBerHaxor
aw fucking hell man
was too slow, he managed to send over the aftermath of a guy who drowned
bloated looking fucker

LolaPuz
Jesus, thank God I managed to block him before he sent anything to me

UBerHaxor
did he send u anything Fnk?

-> Nothing gore like. Just a single message. ->

Ttito 
what did it say?

-> "Keep an eye out for an update. Will be available for emulation, bundled with personal reference material." ->
