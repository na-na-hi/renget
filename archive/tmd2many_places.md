A quiet, sleepy place out in the depths of the Mist Continent. A prime example of a frontier town, with a small population that occasionally sees itself swell on busier seasons with the arrival of teams and adventurers looking for a place of respite in an otherwise civilization-barren landscape.

## Shops and Services

**Sneasel's Shop**
Location: Anywhere
*Move Relearner, Minor Stat Reallocation*
- The appearance of the hastily erected structure with nothing more than two runes to describe itself definitely does not fill you with any level of confidence. Sneasel's mysterious attitude and aura don't help, either. Yet, you do have the benefit of knowing she's legit. Although you doubt her methods are less than... well. You're not sure, actually. At least the services are on demand.
- Sneasel offers you the ability to remember moves, even ones that you haven't learned! That one might be a little difficult, though. She can also knock some sense into you.

**Hawlucha's Slam School**
Location: Major Towns
*Move Tutor, Egg Moves, General TM Vendor*
- Colorful and evocative, it's hard to miss the tent of Hawlucha's Slam School whenever and wherever they might be in a town. The energetic nature and rambunctious sound of hard work is definitely one way to quickly locate this particular group of vendors.
- Representatives of Hawlucha can help guide you through learning difficult moves, unlock the secrets of your bloodline, and even offer some quick methods to a move, for a price, of course.

**Mystics of Marshadow**
Location: Major Towns
*Complete Stat Reallocation, IQ refunding*
- Identified by their dark aura and even darker appearance, the presence of these tents seem to swallow up the surrounding light. With nothing but cryptic words and confusing rituals even for the most well-read arcanist, these practicing mystics help you to forget and forgive.
- Mystics of Marshadow can help you to move around your whole stat table and refund IQ points by removing IQ skills.

**Kecleon Mercantile Clan**
Location: Anywhere
*General Adventuring Supplies*
- Almost every Explorer, Adventurer, and Rescuer is familiar with this green tent in a town, or a carpet full of wares deep within a dungeon. How is it that they're everywhere? You're not quite sure, but their prices can be fair, given you're Ranked enough for their tastes.
- They sell almost everything you need for adventuring, even while you're adventuring! Try not to steal from them. It never can end well.
