## Secondary List of NPCs
Listed below are all the non-player characters not significant enough to have a character sheet created for them, either due to their role as a background character or simply because you couldn't be bothered and found no need to. They may be prominent enough to be reoccurring and can "graduate" from this list. You can even include larger teams here, as well.

Group/Name | Pokémon | Description
:----: | :----: | ---- 
Team Rangers | Mudkip and Pikachu | A strange duo hailing from the Air Continent, they are an independent rescue team operating near the area of Pokémon Square.
Team Stainless | Rookidee and Tinkatink | A duo of newbie explorers from the Globetrotter's guild. They're little, but they always give it their all! They currently reside in Baram Town, where their mentor, Kleavor, is.

## Important Locations
Below are all the reoccurring locations that players may be expected to travel back to or visit on multiple occasions. More will be added depending on the stage and progression of the story

### ->Baram Town<-
->**Location: Air Continent**<-

->![please hold experiencing difficult](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/84apclmojj4.png)<-

A thriving coastal town in the Air Continent, it's known for being exceptionally windy, with a constant cool breeze flowing over the region. The responsibility for this area falls to Clan Beryl. The wind is harnessed for the processing of berries and the town has a prominent bakery.

->![please hold experiencing difficult](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/lIITxHMzokzuTtmVHHWkvyuA)<-

A quiet, sleepy place out in the depths of the Mist Continent. A prime example of a frontier town, with a small population that occasionally sees itself swell on busier seasons with the arrival of teams and adventurers looking for a place of respite in an otherwise civilization-barren landscape.

## Shops and Services

**Lilac's Wares**
Location: N/A
*Basic Adventure Supplies, Local Specialties & Odd Jobs*
- The most eye-catching advertisement you will see for Lilac's Wares is the proprietor of the shop himself. A shiny Delibird with a huge backpack, always open for business regardless the time of day despite what the grumpy salesmon might say.
- Always sells the very basics an adventurer might need, along with goods found in the current region, but the price and payment methods may vary depending on need. The ex-traveling merchant turned supplier still has plenty of contacts, and some contracts, to keep the merchandise flowing despite where he finds himself in the world.
- Lilac is always on the lookout for certain items and artifacts. When he hears rumors on the wind on where to acquire them, special contracts become available for sale. These contracts will send adventurers on a mission that will unlock new and more powerful items for sale, albeit in limited quantities.

**Sneasel's Shop**
Location: Anywhere
*Move Relearner, Minor Stat Reallocation*
- The appearance of the hastily erected structure with nothing more than two runes to describe itself definitely does not fill you with any level of confidence. Sneasel's mysterious attitude and aura don't help, either. Yet, you do have the benefit of knowing she's legit. Although you doubt her methods are less than... well. You're not sure, actually. At least the services are on demand.
- Sneasel offers you the ability to remember moves, even ones that you haven't learned! That one might be a little difficult, though. She can also knock some sense into you.

**Hawlucha's Slam School**
Location: Major Towns
*Move Tutor, Egg Moves, General TM Vendor*
- Colorful and evocative, it's hard to miss the tent of Hawlucha's Slam School whenever and wherever they might be in a town. The energetic nature and rambunctious sound of hard work is definitely one way to quickly locate this particular group of vendors.
- Representatives of Hawlucha can help guide you through learning difficult moves, unlock the secrets of your bloodline, and even offer some quick methods to a move, for a price, of course.

**Mystics of Marshadow**
Location: Major Towns
*Complete Stat Reallocation, IQ refunding*
- Identified by their dark aura and even darker appearance, the presence of these tents seem to swallow up the surrounding light. With nothing but cryptic words and confusing rituals even for the most well-read arcanist, these practicing mystics help you to forget and forgive.
- Mystics of Marshadow can help you to move around your whole stat table and refund IQ points by removing IQ skills.

**Kecleon Mercantile Clan**
Location: Anywhere
*General Adventuring Supplies*
- Almost every Explorer, Adventurer, and Rescuer is familiar with this green tent in a town, or a carpet full of wares deep within a dungeon. How is it that they're everywhere? You're not quite sure, but their prices can be fair, given you're Ranked enough for their tastes.
- They sell almost everything you need for adventuring, even while you're adventuring! Try not to steal from them. It never can end well.
