Research Project: Studying the Mysteriosity Phenomena in Mystery Dungeons

Investigators: Stargazer the Meowstic & Larkspur the Zorua

Prepared by: Iris the Leafeon

__Statement of Purpose__
This case study is designed to examine how the concept of Mysteriosity works and is realized. The notion of how these phenomena could be further understood and be used for Explorers' benefits is the focus of this study. 

__The study__
Mysteriosity is the Mystery Dungeon's "engine" itself. There are five levels of Mysteriosity, with effects varying from stage to stage. Level one is the tamest, and level five is the fiercest. Each level is cumulative, meaning that a level two dungeon can have level one and two effects in place. The following lists the possible effects on each level:

Level 1 - Abnormal weather changes within one floor, endless enemies of feral Pokémon will appear
Level 2 - Pitfalls, simple traps, occasional spontaneous combustion of surroundings
Level 3 - Monster Houses, traps that scramble the senses
Level 4 - Unknown
Level 5 - Mirage enemies will appear, biome may change randomly, enemy types may change randomly, teammates in distress may temporarily turn feral and attack other teammates

All Mystery Dungeons have Mysteriosity—most are either level 1 or level 2. Tougher dungeons such as Purity Forest would be labeled as a level 3. Level 4 and 5 cannot occur naturally.

Additionally, there's the Mysterious Distortion Effect, these are categorized into four outcomes with various conditions. The first category, labeled as Blue weakens the enemies while Red strengthens the enemies. Yellow disables the usage of items, and Green affects the floor layout of the Mystery Dungeon. A more detailed observation is listed below:
 
Blue | Red | Yellow | Green 
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
Enemies' Speed is Slower | Enemies' Speed is Faster. | Explorers are unable to digest any consumable. | The floor will contain only long corridors.
Enemies will be asleep throughout the floor.  | All forms of healing are disabled. | Explorers are unable to use Wonder Orbs and Wands. | The floor contains special tiles.
Enemies' strength are weakened. | Enemies' strength are enhanced | Explorers' held items loses their effects. | The floor will form a random weather.
| | | Only one of the items that can spawn on the floor will appear.      
| | | Only one kind of Pokémon that can spawn on the floor will appear.
| | | Abilities' effects are disabled.

Sometimes a floor can be affected by two distortions; the second one will always be of a different group.

Lastly, there's Mysterious Forces—once enough is accumulated, this "energy" will randomly warp an Explorer's team into a different plane from the Mystery Dungeon they're in. There are four locations where the Explorer could warp into: 

-A Gilded Hall
-An Uncharted Road 
-An Illusory version of the Mystery Dungeon they're in 
-A completely separate Mystery Dungeon

The Mysterious Force effect varies: it may last only one floor or throughout the journey. This phenomenon is guaranteed to end right before the original Mystery Dungeon's final floor.

For level 4 and level 5 Mysteriosity to occur, the investigators' teacher hypothesized that harnessing the Mysterious Force within the Mystery Dungeon through the Entercards will cause the entire Mystery Dungeon to distort to the point where entire floors will make no logical sense whatsoever. Only one time in history accounts for a "level 5" Mysteriosity Mystery Dungeon, but those were only known by word of mouth for generations, so this poses some skepticism on its validity. 

This research has been carried out in twenty-seven Mystery Dungeons from the Mist continent, Air continent, and Water continent. 
The study was conducted from 07/01/XXXX to 07/02/XXXX. The investigators' teacher is present during the whole ordeal.

Notes: 
-Mirage enemies are enemies that appear to be real but in fact don't exist. They won't harm the Explorer nor can the Explorer harm them. It's just to mess with their senses. 
-Feral Pokémon usually populate the dungeons, feral means that these Pokémon have no ability to speak and are usually mindlessly violent.
