Gmad Artists to Check Out
Version 0.5
Need to:
- Need to add artist from twitter and FA on the list that do not appear, or were missed when adding from e621.net the first time. 
- Adding Tags/descriptions of what an artist makes
-Finish gmad artist tips
You're new to the general? Welcome! Take a look at some artist making gmad content that are popular here. This page includes e621 links, and other sites; obtaining, saving, & sharing art, and advice on being a gmad artist/writer! 
Pastebin mirror: https://pastebin.com/LGDXXu7u 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The majority of the artists on here will be to e621.net. This is done because of three reasons:
1. No account is needed to view the pictures.
2. E621 has a wiki tab on the left which has all the sites the artists is at.
3. E621 is more of an archive site. If an artist leaves, expect their art to be on there forever. Unless they make the decision to make their art to DNP. Then, fuck em, or at least make them kindly reconsider. I will talk more about what to do if this situation happens, or if their art are hard to find.
Otherwise, I will put a link to the artists page if they're not on E621.net for any other reasons. Like not being to well known to be added. If that happens, make sure to have them added on e621. 
Using Scripts for Browsing E621
So, there are something called scripts that can change how a site works. And there are a lot of convenient scripts to make browsing e621 easier! I made a mega link to download all the scripts I used, even one outside e621. Some for YouTube, Hentai, and many more.

First, download Violentmokey here. https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/ 
Second, once installed, download the zip file containing the scripts, and extract the file onto your desktop: https://mega.nz/#!ZVNnAIAA!R6X0kCZ_fm4D7AsL1pnmW2j0-Cm5zCtsGu6aNZXDo-Q 
Third, open the dashboard 

Fourth, go to setting, and click import. Select the folder, and press enter. Or select the ones you want to install. Then just use the sites that the scripts are for. They will activate and show up when you click on the icon.


I would like to list where to get more scripts after using the file. 
GitHub
Openuserjs
Sleazyfork (scripts for NSFW sites)
Greasyfork (scripts for SFW sites)

Sites
Sorted by usefulness, top the most essential, and the bottom being no longer as good. As a note, the sites on the lists are subject to change positioning. Especially new/obscure sites I will need to check out. 

E621.net: As stated above, E621.net is really reliable to get links, or browse art. Other than misleading tags, or occasionally mod-fuckery that happens, it's still a really solid site. Make sure to use the search tools to your advantage,  make a use of the blacklist, and always download the full image. That is done by going to download, and saving it!

Furaffinity/Sofurry/Weasly: Furaffinity is the most popular site to furry users. However, it does not have a tag system, and it requires an account to see mature-adult content. However, it's gallery, and page style is more than convenient for browsing art.

Twitter: Also a highly popular site with furries artists. Especially for traffic, or using it as a portal to other sites; most commonly their Furaffinity or Pixiv Pages. Sadly, the site wasn't geared towards being an art gallery. So infamously, Browsing an artists account can go one of two ways. One: it's just exclusively their art, with very minimum side content unrelated to their art posted in the media tab. Such as food, games, GIFs, etc. Or two, they use their "art accounts" like a message chat. Endless GIFs, food pics, games, and no art to be seen. Personally, keep a guideline of things to do before following an account, like checking through it. Or even just following them on their other sites.

u18chan: The furry counterpart to 4chan. Huge catalog of various furry topics, content, and art that spans over a decade. Community might be maximum autismo for most when browsing. 

Yiff.Party: Controversial in nature, the site is used for posting patreon content publically. Usually using bots, or people that purchased from the patreon, and shares the content. Extremely useful to get in conjunction to u18chan. It is pretty hard to upkeep the server, why it needs donations every month. Not to mention, even though this was intended to be a scrapping site for furry patreons, the site now takes any patreon account. Which means cam girls, and other patreon stuff. Not to mention, some patreon accounts loaded there may or may not be updated frequently. Also be aware there is a forum to talk in.

Ex-Hentai: 

Pixiv: Japanese version of twitter, except that it's geared towards posting art. Other than the language barrier, premium features, and the fanbox system if you want free stuff, it's really solid.

Telegram: AKA, furry Wattsapp. It is a messaging service that has more advance privacy features, and settings. Groups and channels are made to host art. Includes an automatic media download feature. So that way you automatically download pics from a channel or group. This is the most effective way of grabbing smut, it start immediately as soon as you click & scroll through. This is also available on desktop. Let it be known that to access a chat, you would need an invitation code, so expect some artists to have exclusive chats to their content as a patreon bonus. However, most are simple for chatting. I will be linking an image of a chart about how to make good use of patreon, and avoid it becoming a paywall in the "being an artist section."

Discord: Popular messaging service among furry communities, and art chats. I am personally in a couple of good porn dump channels to link, and know a lot of great folks. It can also be used for exclusive patreon chats for content. So keep that in mind when looking out for an artist chat link.

Picarto: Streaming site. Very popular with furries. Can be also used to find where an artists hosts their art. Or to get even more close and personal with your favorite artists!

Deviantart: Ah, the famed deviancy of deviantart. There are a couple really great artists. However, the accounts may be used as a backup. With them not being updated for a while. It’s great to keep aware of a backup account, but it might not be as important as an active account on another site. 

Hentai-foundry: Don’t let the anime tiddies fool you, there's a couple of artists on here that do gmad content. And a dozen more M/F content if you’re into that. 

Artstation: For the ones with an art career. This is one of those sites that mainly have 3d modelers, concept artist, illustrators, and more. NSFW is allowed, even without account you can access it. However, its not a nest of graciously sexy gmad husbands. But it can be later down the road.  

Other/Personal sites: Here is going to be a list of other sites that I’ll come across. 

Tumblr: where to begin? If you never heard, Tumblr use to be a social media site used by artists of various kinds. But it has been dropped by many due to the site banning any NSFW content. The tl;dr of the situation was that the tumblr app on iOS was at risk of being banned due to the NSFW content. After the ban, a mass exodus of artists returned to the other popular sites. Especially Twitter and FA. It drastically lost a lot of members, and was sold from yahoo to another site. As of writing, the NSFW ban is not lifted, or even changed yet. Before this all happened with Tumblr it had some issues with “illegal” content being posted, shit moderation, and general fuckery in the community. But even then, this site didn’t deserve a fate like this, or any site period. Let this be a lesson in covering your ground when following a page. Save the art that you like; share it with other, post it on e621 or another Booru, get onto yiff.party to get access to an artist patreon for free via peer to peer sharing/scrapping. Do anything to save it before it’s lost. The same goes for any artists reading this. Keep a backup of some form, before everything crashes down.

Being an Artist
What counts as gmad in art?
    Usually anything that is usually different from a standard humanoid form. Either with some or no human features left. Refer to the chart as to what level you would like to be at, keep in mind that most anons on the thread post art that is a 3-7 on the scale. 

 I want to draw my prevented fantasies! Where do I start?
    First, you will need to study. Courtesy of the art improvement thread on /trash/, use this guide as a resource: 
Q: I'm a total beginner. Where should I start?
A: Do the exercises in either "Keys to Drawing" by Bert Dodson or "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" by Betty Edwards. Additionally, you can try the first few lessons of http://drawabox.com/ for building up muscle memory and confidence.

Additionally, you will need tools to draw, unless you do most thing using traditional mediums. I may link to art supplies if you would like. 
    Second, practice. Take the time out of your day to create. If you have difficulty with time, sort it out, I believe you can create free time. You can do once every week, every three days, daily, etc. 
Third, send. Your first artwork doesn’t need to be great, because you’ll make better art overtime. You would need to keep uploading. You can receive praise for your ability to provide great content to people, and even make a living out of it! Just don’t get burnt out. Take a break when you need to, but don’t leave.
 I want to write my perverted fantasies! Where do I start?
Check out the pastebin I made on writing fantasy stories. /Gmad/ Fantasy Writing Bible (Ver. 1.2.1) 
Additionally, there should be resources to talking about writing tip. I will add them eventually if there are some that go in depth about writing techniques. Here's some stuff that isn’t from me:

Basics of Being an Artist
Comfort & Health:
Take a break every 1-1 ½ hour. Stretch, walk, and take a bathroom break.
Get a 24 hour dispatch chairs/CEO chairs with headrests
If you would like, get an adjustable standing desk to switch between standing and sitting. This is also optional, but get a balance board with rubber pad to stand on for extended periods of time while working. It’s generally healthier to stay standing than sitting. 
Image of man using board while working.  
Be ergonomic with your desk space:
Average desk height is 29-30 inches (~76 cm), adjust the height of the chair; keeping elbows at 90 degrees. 
If your feet are hanging midair, get a foot stool or something to rest your feet on. 
Adjust the monitor by keeping the screen at arms length away. Adjust it so you do not need to strain the eyes, or bend forward to use the screen. Use a stack or paper or books if the monitor is none adjustable. If you use two monitors at the same time, line them up so you are in the middle of them. Finally, use a kickstand for laptops to apply this ergonomic tip. 
When using your mouse, move from your elbow. Moving from your shoulders will cause strain and soreness.

SAI: goes on sale often. 

Do’s and Don’t’s
Do make it convenient to see your content, while having a patreon. 
Don’t make it a paywall. 
Do listen to the commissioner on what they want. And make corrections to the piece, if the commissioner bring them up.
Don't stonewall the commissioners from getting their commission. Or have bad communication habits towards your clients. 
Do have reasonable prices. 
This can depend on how much you need to make, and how long you work for per hour. Even as a freelance, don’t get underpaid for how much you work. 
Setting how much you charge at 20 dollars per hour is a good start. As that can help to measure how much each commission will cost based on how long you’d think you will need to work on them. - Thanks to Anon No.28263184
For example, a sketch might be 40 dollars a piece (2hrs) while a full shaded painted piece with a background would be 115 dollars (4 hours + 35 dollars for the detailed background). Keep in mind that some projects won’t have a fixed pay rate. This can depend on of the complexity of the work (line art, shading, number of characters). - Thanks to Anon No.28263143
Always allow negotiations of the price. Don’t be too stingy with prices, unless the client is trying to bullshit their way into getting free art. At the start, you will need to build up a gallery, THEN you can determine what price you want commissions to cost. Most people have certain types of commissions at flat fees, then add stuff as they get more complex. For example: Black and white sketch, Sketch + Color, Animated. - Thanks to Anon No.28263416
Do be private and discreet about your life. It is good to talk, and let your audience know how you are doing, and any problems that come up. But putting your life on full blast for everyone to see is going to have it’s downsides. Especially when it comes drama, talking about politics, etc. You don’t want to divide or alienate people from following you. Or even towards your own audience. 
Don't
Do
