Pre apocalypse, Yuki came from a line of cybernetic artisans who left Japan to start a business elsewhere. Somewhere along the line, she got stuffed into a luxury bomb shelter, learned the tools of the trade, and eventually clawed her way out. Only to discover that she was way out of her league in the new world.

It's a miracle someone as adventurous, reckless, and greenhorn as her even survived the area. Thankfully, she's a good mechanic and a somewhat proficient master of the sword. Just don't ask her about the latter skill, the origins of her learning it are quite embarrassing.

Yuki herself is a bubbly and friendly woman, who MAY get a bit touchy-feely. Rest assured she knows her distance, but anything goes in a fuck-all world. Of course, she's also determined to pay back any help she gets and is an exceedingly loyal friend (or lover if you're willing to bear through her crazy escapades) . May be very curious on the more outlandish parts of the Wastes so if you're travelling with her, keep on your guard.
