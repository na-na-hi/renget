A drifting vagabond that carries neither past not future with him; a passing phantom, though for what reasons to his reputation are unknown. His decisions are best described as...esoteric? As if he has some grand design that is truly and completely impossible to divine through natural means. 

All that is known is that when staring down the barrel of his gun, he's a professional. Not an assassin, just a simple man doing simple jobs. He wields a revolver made by his trusty pack mu— companion, Jazz Faraday. 

Speaking of, the mazoku in question is a real piece of work. A scam artist of the highest order, for some goddamn reason she's one of the finest smiths on Harahel. Practiced in making firearms and bound to Quinn as a result of a mistaken contract with Arc, she's the sort that won't do shit until her force her.

But once she does... What a sight to behold. That said, she can't shoot for shit or make the ammunition by herself...
