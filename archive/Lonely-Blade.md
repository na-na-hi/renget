===Techniques===
[Soul Refining] Soul Like Steel - To best wield a blade there must be no separation between warrior and weapon. Through combat, the warrior's soul will take on traits of the partner until they are spiritually indistinguishable.
[Attack] Body And Blade As One - Any great warrior will feel his weapon is an extension of himself, but this technique makes the warrior become more like an extension of their weapon. Before all else, a blade's purpose is to kill. Thus, the students of the Honest Blade believe that the truest way to strike is to let your blade guide you.
[Barrage] Four Cherry Blossoms Fall; Fourteen Land - A relentless assault that attacks weak points in one's body. Like cracks in their being, even the slightest force can cause these weak points to spread until it causes their body to shatter.
[Ambush] (-10) To Invite Death - The blade is sheathed and the warrior takes on an apparent calm regardless of their current circumstances. Once their enemy attempts to take advantage of their lowered guard, they redraw and attack without hesitation. This technique sacrifices any semblance of defense to cut an opponent down.
[Trump Card] A Blade Weeps Crimson Tears (-10) - The blood spilled during a fight is condensed and sharpened into daggerlike forms that chase down an opponent, acting like a stream to bend and twist around attempts to stop them.

[Footwork] To Draw Is To Kill (-10) - A movement technique of unyielding speed and aggression. The user's body moves as if possessed as they cut down all in their path to strike an opponent.
[Stealth] A Blade Feels Not - A deceptively simple technique that suppresses the ill intent of the user. The desire to harm is divorced from the act, making an approaching blade seem no more alarming to the senses than a leaf drifting in the wind.

[Profession]
Bloody Blade Construction - Just as their spirit is nourished by the anguish of the fallen, their blade feeds too. With flesh, blood, and bone of fine warriors, masterworks might be made. This alone makes betrayals within the sect quite common, as those who have trained to become weapons make the best materials.

>Bio
Jian was orphaned at a young age and taken in by the Honest Blade Pavilion, an ancient sect that forsakes any suggestion of nobility that most cultivators make of their weapons in pursuit of perfecting their true purpose: the utter destruction of whatever crosses its path. Disciples aspire to master the art of killing by using their techniques to close the gap between man and tool. For Jian, this union has proven as effective as it is troublesome. Before her blade is drawn, she is a quiet and somewhat naive girl who would much prefer to wield a brush than a blade. But once she is moved to draw her sword, she acts as if possessed by a spirit of slaughter and relentlessly pursues her foe. The only remedy she has found thus far is isolation. Yet, the enemies inherited from her sect would have her strike them down, only encouraging more to pursue her and giving her sword more purchase.

--Flashy Heroics
XXX
--Nameless Heroics
While the spirit of her sword is devilish, it doesn't particularly care who it cuts down. This leads to the odd good deed here and there.  Scores of bandits and similarly wicked individuals have met their end because they desired to involve Jian in their misdeeds. A case in recent memory was that of a group of brigands harassing a poorly guarded merchant carriage. They'd intended to take both the wares and the merchant's daughter as well and believed themselves quite fortunate when another victim wandered upon the scene. If it was only what little coin she carried that they sought, then they might still draw breath with purses a little heavier. However, one made the mistake of attempting to scare Jian into compliance by brandishing his weapon. She drew and struck him down on instinct, the rest of the brigands soon joining him. The merchant and his daughter were too stunned by what had transpired to properly thank their savior before she left. A good thing, as she may have turned her blade on them without a second thought.
--Battlefield Brother
Just as swords are tested, disciples of the sect are sent out to killing fields so that their worth may be measured. Such places are also attractive due to being ripe with materials. Those days are a haze in Jian's mind as they were filled with endless bloodshed, but one thing stands out amidst it all. She crossed paths with a fellow butcher and, in a rare instance of restraint, fought alongside them until it came time to part ways. Although taught coldness and introverted to an extreme degree, Jian carries a desire to reunite with the one her sword spared. For if she cannot find reprieve from her isolation in them, she has little hope to call any other a friend.

--Mind Sea
An unwelcoming forest of blood and steel where the only vegetation is that which blossoms from the endless sea of corpses. The spirit that lords over this land is none other than that of the very blade Jian wields.
