##### `Annie`
==(Part 1)==
>Your gf wanted to go out for a late night walk
>not exactly something you were in favor of but she really wanted to see the harvest moon
>mercifully you two seemed the be the only ones at the park when you arrived
>between the starry night, the crisp chill in the air, it was actually kind of a pleasant walk
>the conversation was mostly small talk
>in your head you kept debating when was the best time to propose to her
>you’d be dating long enough
>was now the time?
>you didn’t get a chance to ponder the matter further as rustling in the bushed to your right caught you attention
>you barely had time to look over when something full body tackled you with the force of a linebacker on steroids tied to the front of a car
>you were launched a solid seven feet before you head slammed against the cold dirt
>you barely had a chance to lean up and appreciate the daze you were in when you heard a sound that shook you to your core
>a sound you hoped you’d never hear
>your girlfriend’s bloodcurdling scream
>you looked over to see a horrid beast over the top of her
>clawing at her clothes and flesh with the same ease and ferocity
>you didn’t know what this thing was
>you didn’t have time to care
>fumbling in your pocket you procured your 10mm
>you lined up the sights just as it bit down on her
>the first shot struck it in the ribs under its arm
>the second destroyed it’s left shoulder
>by the third it had snapped around to regard what was attacking it
>It let out a roar only to have a round strike it square in the neck
>and yet it didn’t drop
>instead the roar turned into a croak as it flopped backwards and scurried off into the woods
>no time to ask questions
>you got up and hurried over to you girlfriend
>she was covered in claw and bitemarks
>nevermind the blood
>she looked like she was going into shock
“Oh God! Just hang on!”

>You turned and went for your phone
>your hands were shaking as you booted up the screen
>9-
>a sound behind broke your concentration
>almost like bone cracking
>you snapped around pistol raised incase whatever the hell that thing was had come back for round two
>it wasn’t there
>it came from your girlfriend
>her back was arched to the sky
>her arms stretched out beside her on both sides
>her eyes were wide and full of fear
>but they weren’t blue anymore
>they were a bright amber
>inch long claws erupted from her fingers as her arms and hands elongated
>her face stretched forward into a muzzle
>her mouth was locked open in a silent scream as her teeth grew into fangs
>the wounds across her body healed as her body was enveloped in a layer of fur
>her muscles bulged and toned
>and then without warning she snapped upright
>head pointed to the sky as she howled to the moon
>you dropped your phone
>the sound was enough for it to hear you
>it’s mouth was open, fangs bared and eyes wild
>you still had your pistol out
>you weren’t sure what to do

>against your better judgment you took a gamble
>you holster your pistol and held your arms out
>she was growling and starting to crawl forwards
>her body was primed for a leap
>you knew you probably only a few seconds before you got mauled
>now or never
>you took a breath and said a single word
“Annie”
>you saw her body suddenly seize
>like her body was fighting itself
>her amber eyes locked onto yours
>a newfound clarity glinted off them as they darted around before looking down
>slowly she looking over her shaking clawed hands
>it was hard to read expressions on her new face but her widening eyes and shaking her head back and forth told you all you needed to know
>with a wail she covered her face with her claws
>terrified or ashamed of what she had become

>you felt like you were making all decisions against common sense right now
>but then again nothing made sense right now
>your girlfriend just turned into a werewolf
>carefully you approached the sobbing thing
>it was almost amazing how something like that could go from terrifying to absolutely pitiful at the drop of a hat
>she didn't react to you closing the gap
>you were even sure she was aware of you at this point
>you knelt down in front of her
>slowly you reached out with one hand and make contact with one of her large clawed hands cupping her face
>still no real reaction
>you brought around your other hand and cupped the underside of her cheek
>you heard her sobbing quiet a little
>after a minute she brought her hands down
>her eyes slightly bloodshot from all the crying
>but still there was something in them now
>uncertainty? surprise? you weren't sure
>you tried to think of something to say
>some elaborate way to say you weren't going anywhere
>that you weren't going to leave her
>instead she brought up one of her larger clawed hands and embraced yours
>message received

>After taking her hands and a bit of coaxing you got her to her feet
>she wasn't exactly short as a human but now she was absolutely towering over you
>at least her fangs weren't out anymore
"Come, not like I'm just gonna leave you out in the woods"
>It looked like she was trying to smile but was having trouble with her newfound muzzle
>you led her back to the car
>and then a new problem reared it's head that hadn't crossed your mind
>you got in the driver side no problem
>only to look over and see your girlfriend awkwardly squished in the passenger seat
>even hunched over her back was pressing into the roof
>her almost glowing eyes giving an uncertain "now what?"

>Ok, the front seat clearly wasn't going to cut it
"Hang on, got an idea"
>you got out and carefully eased her out of her wedged position
>you opened the passenger door
>after a confused head tilt her eyes lit up as she realized what you had in mind
>carefully, she leaned forward and climbed in
>her fingers up the whole time and only her palms touching to keep her nails from puncturing the upholstery
>Once she was all the way in you carefully tucked her tail in and shut the door
>maybe not carefully enough seeing as you hear a faint yip from the other side of the door as the door impacted her butt
"Sorry!"
>you hurried around to the driver side
>you took your seat and looked up in the rearview mirror
>Annie was looking back at you
>given her size she was stuck on all fours back there even with the additional space
>and she was looking right back at you
>clearly less than amused
>you gave your best shrug before starting the car
>you looked back at her through the mirror
>you couldn't just drop her off at her house
>not like this
>couldn't leave her alone
>you spoke up
"My place?"
>she looked down before giving a nod
>with a nod you put the car in reverse, pulled out of the park's parking lot, and went on your way

==(Part 2)==
>The drive was mercifully uneventful
>Though there was something hilarious about looking back and seeing what looked to be a massive wolf looking more akin to an uncertain puppy during the drive
>she'd on occasion stick her head between the driver and passenger seat to get a better view of the front
>though she'd hastily duck down whenever a passing car got too close
>you weren't sure if you were acting out of line but you did once or twice pat her head
>she didn't seem to mind though
>eventually you arrived at your place
>opening the back door you carefully coaxed her out by getting her to walk on all fours backwards
>inadvertently sending her backing into you for a moment when you thought you'd need to help pulling her out
>unlocking the front door you flipped on the lights
>the sound of claws clicking on the tile floor followed behind you
>you weren't sure what your next move should be as you went and shut the door as she passed.
>She was probably tired, lord knows you were
>but she was also still covered in blood from the attack

>you were both tired
>but honestly you figured the two of you would probably appreciate not waking up to blood in the bed tomorrow
"You wanna try and clean up a little?"
>Annie tilted her head a little
"You're...still covered in some..."
>you pointed
>she looked down
>realizing the red stains on her front
"Here, I'll set something up"
>you passed her and went into her bathroom
>it was setup about how you last saw it
>tub with a shower head over the top
>At her size you weren't sure if her head could fit under the shower head
>nevermind if she could maintain balance on her new legs while wet
>you closed the drain and started filling up the tub
>rummaging around the side you found a container of bubble bath
>lavender scented
>didn't have any dog shampoo on hand so you were going to have to make do
>you popped the top and poured some in
>before long you have a frothy mountain of bubbles
>you popped open the door
"Your bath awaits" you called in your best fake posh accent
>Annie poked her head in and surveyed the scene before stepping inside
"Now if you want some privacy I can step-"
>WHAM!
>You looked over to see that she had shut the door behind her
>a raised eyebrow on her face
"...that's ok too!"
>she trotted ahead and started to strip down
>it was admittedly a bit of an odd thing
>everything was where you'd expect it to be
>it just now had a layer of fur over it
>it probably would have been more enticing if it weren't for the blood
>she sat on the rim of the tub and beckoned you over with a finger
>the message was clear
>your turn

>You started to strip down
>did she just growl?
>not a "I'mma rip your throat out" kind of growl
>something else
>when you approached the tub she gestured for you to enter it first
>you weren't sure exactly what she had planned here
>you got in the scented bubble bath
>for her to immediately follow in after you
>more or less sitting in your lap
>it'd maybe be a bit romantic if she wasn't so dang heavy
>With something akin to an "Awoo" she pointed to her back
>there was indeed some blood splattered back there as well
"Alright, alright, I get the picture" you said as you grabbed a bottle of shampoo
>drizzling it directly into her tan fur
>you looked up to see she was holding her hand out over her shoulder making an open and closing motion
"Oh! One sec!"
>You squeezed some of the shampoo into her hand
>Satisfied she started to work on her front while you worked on her back
>you went slowly fearing hitting wounds
>but strangely enough when you washed off the area of blood it was devoid of any punctures or bites
>the hell?
>were they all on her chest?
>you leaned over her shoulder
>no her chest was clean too
>then mammal brain decided to switch on and had you to look a bit further down
>right at her breasts
>and an amber eye glancing back confirmed she caught you staring
>you snapped back behind her
>you couldn't quite describe the noise she made
>you think it was laughing

>With that embarrassment out of the way you hastily finished cleaning her back
>you swore she was grinning now every time you chanced a look
>she got out of the tub first
>and promptly shook herself like a dog
>sending water all over the place
>you opted for just a towel
>you half expected her to grab the sports bra and throw it back on but she passed over it on the floor
>the bloodstains probably didn't make it very appealing
>she scampered off into the main part of the house
>you followed after getting your clothes back on
>you found her in the bedroom
>setting a towel on the bed to try and absorb whatever moisture in her fur was still left
>she crawled onto the bed
>her ears and eyes drooping with a sigh
>she'd been through a lot
>you approached
>a lazy amber eye glancing towards you
"Do you want me to leave you alone or-?"
>you got your answer when she grabbed your hand
>you gave a nod and got in on the other side
>you suddenly had a damp werewolf wrapping her arms around you
>she made a whining sound
"I'm not going anywhere, don't worry"
>you weren't sure how long the two of you laid there
>before finally the call of sleep took you

==(Part 3)==
>you started to stir awake
>you brain for a second was trying to figure out if everything that happened the night before was some fever dream as it started to switch on
>You got your answer as your eyes finally crept open
>this wasn't your bed it was hers
>your eyes immediately locked onto the other occupant in bed with you
>it was Annie
>human again
>she started to stir
>a hazel eye cracked open
>a tired but genuine smile formed on her face
>she reached out and cupped your cheek
>words weren't needed the appreciation on her face shown like the morning sun touching her skin
>"Anon"

>she later recounted it as feeling like a "something primal" trying to override her brain
>trying to lash out at anything near her, in that instance, you
>had you not called out, she wasn't sure what she would have done
>she feared what she was, whether she'd could control it next time, if she ever could
>but you weren't dissuaded
>you told her you weren't going to leave her

Epilogue:
>Your lives changed after that night
>it took time but Annie seemed to eventually get the grasp of her new form
>the first few changes were rough, but you helped her through them
>now she sees it less with fear and more as a power rush
>granted chasing her around once a month is a bit hectic, but you don't care, she's happy
>you've debated on and off on letting her bite you, to join her in all this
>you haven't quite made up your mind
>one day, maybe
>all that mattered was she was happy, and so were you
