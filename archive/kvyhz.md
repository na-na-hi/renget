Okay, the current situation with Anthropic:

- They have implemented temporary bans on keys for violating their Terms of Service.
- This means that if your JB was unsuccessful a few times in a row and you received a message saying, "Sorry, you are too lewd," then this key will be temporarily hard-filtered.
- After some time, the key will be reset to normal.

Now the funny part!

- On the proxies, we all share the keys. Say we have five keys and twenty anons.
- We might have an idiot who will use an ineffective JB or use that key for some hardcore stuff.
- And Anthropic will filter his prompts a few times on different keys.
- Then you prompt, and -boom- you are hard-filtered because of some morons who used that key before you.

In other words, if you use a proxy and get hard-filtered, then it may mean that SOMEONE before you broke that key with their bad prompts, and it may not be your (or your JB's) fault at all.
