##Extra: Midnight Walk

Alone on a wintery evening, a frail Hufflepuff walked along the Black Lake's beaches, daydreaming.
Blushing slightly, the girl let her mind wander about, imagining outrageous what-ifs, desperately hoping they would come to truth while dreading them at the same time. Overwhelmed with conflicted feelings of longing, self-doubt, despair and hope she felt stabbing sensations in her chest; stomach; lower back and loins, followed by an unknown feeling rushing through her loins, spine and heart.

Completely lost in thought, she wandered along the beach, slouched and shivering as time passed. She walked back and forth, her heart begging for her wish to come true as the moon's pale glow started illuminating the lake's surface.
Snapping back to reality, the girl panicked at the sight; her blue eyes quickly looked towards the Castle: the lights were already out, she was in big trouble.

Surely sneaking in wouldn't be a problem with her unique ability? She rushed towards the castle haphazardly... Slipped and tripped.
Red with embarrassment and hurting from the fall, she held back tears as the whole night replayed through her mind; she felt punished for being a fool and not knowing her place; she wanted to drop out and run away; to disappear forever; to-

A warm, blue glowing shape slowly approached the sobbing girl covered in sand, she slowly looked up, eyes read but not crying yet as her gaze met with a beautiful Thestral. She had no idea what she was looking at but she felt at peace; she felt her worries melt away; she felt compelled to follow it as it walked slowly towards the cabin next to the pier.

The Patronus stopped in front of an upturned flowerpot and sniffed it, showing it to the freezing girl; she slowly approached the Thestral with the intention to caress its eerie face, but he majestic beast dispersed as her shaking hand went through it, surprising and saddening her. 
Lifting the pot, she found a small faintly glowing key, still slightly warm; she felt excited, and scared.

Opening the lakeside cabin's door she found herself inside a cozy cottage; she was welcomed by a crackling fire, the faint smell of lemon and a warm bath. In a slight panic, she looked around, expecting a trap, a benefactor, a large spider... Nothing, not even a note.
She was alone and she was awarded a peaceful rest.
