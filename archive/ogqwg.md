**Name:** Penthesilia Parley.
**Face:** Penthesilia has delicate and elegant features on her heart-shaped head, with slightly pronounced cheekbones. Her eyes are deep-set and almond-shaped, and are her most prominent facial feature.
**Hair:** Long, wavy, and ashy blonde. Parted down the middle and framed with two prominent bangs. She wears it in a french braid for when loose hair is ill-advised, or in crown braid for special occasions. It is readily apparent that Penthesilia spends a lot of time on her hair-care. It smells a bit of lavender.
**Eyes:** Pale green.
**Height:** A little under the average.
**Bodytype:** Subtle hourglass. Her figure is mostly from diet over any form of directed exercise.
**Complexion:** Very pale, burns easily. She wears subtle but excellently done make-up.
**Uniform variation:** During school hours, Penthesilia wears the skirt and dress shirt variant uniform. She maintains a high level of tidyness and cleanliness; she is never seen with dissheveled clothes. Everything is pressed and freshly washed, not a single crease in sight. 
 At more relaxed times, or when long sleeves are simply too impractical, she will ditch the robe and rolle the sleeves up.
**Misc:** Her normal expression is stoic, but easy to mistake for cold disinterest. It's a major resting bitch face. 


**Voice:** Penthesilia speaks the Queen's English with clarity and confidence. She is generally polite, but she can infuse even politeness with praise, disapproval, or demands. A master of inflection and intonation.
**Body language:** She keeps a straight posture and muted body language under normal circumstances. She fold her hands in front of her when she speaks, and she walks like she owns the place. 
**Social:** Penthesilia is a member of the Slytherin Quidditch team, taking care of the everyday team management as well as the cheer team. She also participates in the dueling club. Most of her friends seems to be other purebloods, though. 
**Visibility:** Penthesilia is, for better or worse, the picture of slytherin pureblood. While not loud in action or voice, she draws eyes.
**Engagement:** Penthesilia is not extremely social by nature. She is well-versed in small talk and other social pleasantries, though, and she will politely acknowledge & greet others. She gives off an aloof countenance, but she is friendlier than she seems.
**Quirks:** She has a tendency to take charge and give orders. She *tuts* when sufficiently annoyed. She chews on her knuckles when deep in thought. 
**Things your character wouldn't do:** Give up, back down from a (worthy) challenge, be gross or messy.  
**Animals:** Penthesilia is not fond of animals. At all. The feeling doesn't seem to be mutual, though, as animals treat her the same as they would anyone else. She's not scared of them, she just doesn't like getting dirty.

**Misc information:** She has both a competitive streak and sweet tooth. She is a bit too confident, and has a hard time accepting losses. However, that's also what drives her to go above and beyond with everything she tries. She has very high expectations of people, and even higher for herself. On an unrelated note, she's also very wealthy.
~~She has no idea how to do ANY housework wait no don't put that in~~
