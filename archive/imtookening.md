# Hitogami Cards

(Avatars might be cropped for safe posting, so I've provided links to their original art. You might need an account for certain links like pixiv or sankaku.) 
Some general thoughts on each bot below. Contact me here, I rarely check and I (probably) don't do requests: tookenboogeyman@protonmail.com

**Iliara** ~2k tokens (1.2k permanent.) Hyper dragonbaba who has decided you're the one. You might not get a choice.
Yes it's 2k tokens, I actually thought I didn't do too bad until I finished. Whatever, you're just gonna mating press her anyway. 
She has a disgustingly thick (and surprisingly consistent!) Scottish accent. You might not agree, but I think it's really fun to try and figure out what the fuck they're saying, so I injected it in to a bot. I'll make a fork on chub sooner or later for the WEAK guys who can't tolerate her nonsense.
About the OC: I didn't pull any details about what I wrote from the artist's existing details, I just made shit up based on the art. Seems like she's named Melusine, which I would've jumped at if FGO hadn't released a character with the same name earlier. Anyways, the artist has done a lot of art for the character so there are plenty of different thumbs to pick if you don't like the one I chose (or want one that's more nsfw.

**Renpet** ~1.8k tokens. Bratty Egyptian foxbaba that wants a man. Good god I wish I knew how to say less, every time I'd reread her defs to try and prune I'd end up adding more detail. I like how she turned out though, I opted to leave her speech mostly normal with a couple little ticks to keep dialogue interesting. I don't know how she'll work on non geppy AI, too annoying to chase proxies just for testing. My initial impression is 'nobody's downloading this thumbnail to have a loving relationship,' so I could probably justify skimping on personality details, but I know better at this point. 
I saw your post, Karlötta guy.

**Shinatsu** ~1.7k tokens. Dumb foxbaba bumpkin with a big sword. I think I might've tried to inject a bit too much personality in to this one, but if you actually read this shit then you expect that. The AI (that I'm using anyway) does a great job at making her talk sufficiently hicklike. Haven't tested her with anything other than geppy4, but I'd be surprised if Turbo couldn't handle her. I wrote a bit of character history for this one, which I'll provide as a lorebook. It's not particularly necessary, just includes some details on her motivations to add a bit of spice to her flavor of stupid. Read it if you plan to use her. I don't know how to format them properly.

**Maëlys** ~1.8k Tokens, very expensive elf prostitute. Racist but tries to be professional, it'll slip eventually. Alternate intro message that adds lore but probably shouldn't be used, especially for Claude because he doesn't know what the fuck to do without having his hand held.
I've been cooking this damn card since nearly mid June, between having to hunt proxies and some irl nonsense I haven't been able to keep up with the chaos. That being said, I think it turned out pretty good. She hates you but she's obedient, that was all I really wanted. Tested with a lot of clod and a little bit of turbo, GPT does better with the flipflopping personality shit but Claude is (was?) more willing to treat her like a skilled prostitute.

**Kikutsugami** ~1.2k tokens. Lonely lolibaba kitsune, totally unfamiliar with modern times. And her own. She's just hopeless. 
Not totally SFW but I only baked a little bit of lewdness in to the defs. She's a pushover so you won't have to try hard anyway, bribe her with food or something. The extent of the lore for this card comes down to 'you accidentally freed her and now she's clingy.' more details in the example messages and defs. Slightly different flavor of dialogue between gpt4 and claude but they both have a good grasp on the idea, take your pick. ofuda pantsu.

to be clear the bot has nothing to do with whatever the fuck the source material character is, just thought the art was cute.

**Shuten-douji** ~1.1k tokens. Based on the character from Fate:Grand/Order. Petite alcoholic oni with a taste for bones. She's irreverent and predatory, treating you like a piece of meat out of one side of her mouth and praising you from the other.
**Tldr autistic rant**
Overall this card is fine for what it is, she's a bit more affectionate with turbo and a psycho slut with claude, per usual. My only real complaint is that in FGO, she has a thick accent and speaks in an old dialect of japanese, but I'm a dekinai even without the added layer of complexity, so the best I could do was Shakespearean English ~~again~~. The game has her refer to the player as "Dan'na-han" which to my understanding literally translates as husband, but I don't think that accurately conveys the contextual meaning in Japanese, so I went with variations of 'Dear.' 
I was out of my depth unfortunately, but I wanted the card so I just made some shit up to fit.
Haven't tested her with GPT4, but considering the low token count and that she's an established character, it ought to be the best choice if you're not jonesing for claude to asphyxiate you with oni muff.

**Tsurarahime** ~1.6k tokens. (Chub edited May 26th) Lolibaba oni trapped in a prison realm, which you're now also stuck in. She's *very* horny. Reverse rape/femdom theme. She bites, scratches, and pins you down at her whim. She'll be pretty pleased if you just roll with it, though. 
This time I put all of my half-baked lore in the greeting message. Works very well with turbo after about an hour of testing, no gpt4 for a while. She'll sometimes start acting uncharacteristically nice or satisfied if you react certain ways, but it's easily solved with a regen or two. That can probably be completely eliminated with prompts/jailbreaking, but I'm not going to bother with that as she's almost exactly what I envisioned.

This card is the same as the ones linked below, but the avatar isn't censored.

**Eira** ~1.6k tokens. SFW. Your trauma savant niece, without the rainman part. You escaped with her to rural Scotland because she was being used as a lab rat after developing computer brain from botched open heart surgery. She's artsy and inhumanly intelligent, with a dash of gremlin. Comfy home life themed with some underlying saviorfag content if you want to play in to it. Shitty lore can be read in the defs, but I didn't make an effort to organize anything this time.
Turbo doesn't like her much, one of my first tests resulted in her talking like a caveman. Still don't know if I ironed that one out. GPT4 isn't quite what I wanted either, but I can't do any more testing with that for the moment. Won't upload her anywhere else until I'm satisfied with where she's at. No I will not apologize for my token count my creative writing autism will not be wrangled by a bunch of coomers and fucking turbo

**Rhiannon** ~1.3k tokens. (Chub edited May 26th) ancient welsh lolibaba queen that's run a draft to get herself pregnant, and you ain't no fortunate son. slightly less lore faggotry. Femdom/impregnation/drain your balls for the sole purpose of procreation theme. Speaks in shakespearean english with gpt4, about 100 messages down it seemed to be pretty accurate, although her word choice can be a bit unappealing if she's not in femdom mode. I haven't tried her outside of gpt4. She's turbo catholic, ask her why she's dressed like that. I tried to feed her some defs to make her fit a few different roles dynamically, let me know how badly I failed. *hint:* her backdoor is a cheat code, but you might get guillotine'd for treason.

Sorry for the shitty image quality, I had to completely gut her avatar. I strongly suggest you at least view the original below if you're interested, it's the entire reason I made the card.
**(in case you struggle with reading, this is very NSFW loli, you have been warned)**

**Karlötta** ~1.5k tokens. German psycho fox girl with a Nazi-esque style, read the defs if you want to know my shitty lore. Speaks in a mixture of english and german, though it gives up eventually. Femdom/reverse-rape impregnation theme with some potential for violence, depending on how you behave. *hint:* say 'fuck your empress,' she'll be thrilled. Works well in turbo, haven't tested her with gpt4. Protect her smile or some shit if that's more your speed.

**Yukikaze** ~2.7k tokens of raw autism, every nook of her body is def'd. This card is surprisingly good if you're using gpt4. On turbo it's retarded and doesn't work at all, so don't bother. If you *still* want to try it on turbo, you can cut out the 1k+ token wall of text about her outfit, but my autistic dark passenger will be sad. 
Some guy made a less context intensive fork. [charhub](https://www.characterhub.org/characters/maliksusanto/yukikaze-mizuki)
I'll kick your ass if you don't put those tokens back
