>quick rundown?
-Iochilds bow to Yagdonoffs
-In contact with aliens
-Possess psychic-like abilities
-Control the realm with an iron but fair fist
-Own castles & banks globally
-Direct descendants of the ancient royal blood line
-Will bankroll the first cities on the Moon (Yagdangrad will be be the first city)
-Own 99% of DNA editing research facilities in the Realm
-First designer babies will in all likelihood be Yagdanoff babies
-both sisters said to have 215+ IQ, such intelligence in the Realm has only existed deep in ascension monasteries & Area 50-Gob
-Ancient Skadrin scriptures tell of two angels who will descend upon the Realm and will bring an era of enlightenment and unprecedented technological progress with them
-They own Nanobot R&D labs around the world
-You likely have Yagdabots inside you right now
-The Yagdanoffs are in regular communication with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, forwarding the word of God to the Cult of the Pyre. Who do you think set up the meeting between Furia & the Pyre high command (First meeting between the two organisations in over 1000 years) and arranged the Pyre leader's first trip to the Aico Tundra in history literally a few days later to the Yagdanoff bunker in Wilkes land?

-The twins are about 7 decades old, from the space-time reference point of the base human currently accepted by our society
-In reality, they are timeless beings existing in all points of time and space from the big bang to the end of the universe. We don't know their ultimate plans yet. We hope they're benevolent beings.?

>Cards
Maw's Embrace and Sharpened Resolve are her bread and butter; Embrace is fun all around, and keeps her mobile both on aggro and escape, Resolve boosts her chunky survivability further. Dance with Fate if you're running Presence talent
What May Come, False Idol and all her Obliteration cards are noob traps (WMC is ok, but it's an escape card, not an initiate; and Otherworldly Tether does it better); the rest of her cards are to taste. I like to run Unified in Purpose, Broken Path and New Purpose, but again, it's cards, nobody really cares but you.


>Talents
Deafening Silence is shit, don't use it
Relentless Presence is fun if you use her tendrils a lot, and works well on the larger maps for being even hard to pin down (plus spiderman memes if you chain them), but takes a lot of her bite by not being Unyielding Pressure
Unyielding Pressure is her go-to, and what you should be using most of the time, and it plays into her stacking her DoT's to omae wa shinderu [Yuu ar awready dead....] motherfuckers gameplay


>Abilities
Obliteration is shit, don't use it. It's only a way to instaground yourself after a high tendril, or like, a 2-3m iframe dash/hop. It locks you out of your attacks/abilities so long that you're silencing yourself more than damaging the enemy. That, and you shouldn't be close range anyways.
Tendril is both your infiltration and escape - I say infiltration because you're using it to get to / around their backlines, not the middle of the teamfight. 45'-70' upward is what gets her the most distance/height, it will always disconnect at half it's distance indicated (so attach to farther things if possible) and like Ruckus's jets, jumping before notably extends it's distance / momentum.
Siphon is the main chunk of her sustain, it's 300 every 6s + up to 500hp with cards (800's a bit overkill, 550-600 is enough). Land 'em or die, these things are Vora's shitfilter, like an easier version of Damba's healing.
Ult is a deceptive one. On the surface, it's an execution - wrong. It's a quick charging 7s (?) long (if you count startup), movement and DR buff on command (or whatever the numbers are on the current patch), which refunds up to 50% of it's charge if you're finished with it early and makes the enemy shit themselves and fuck their positioning if they're low because global announcement. Maybe use it to execute a opportune tank (Terminus especially, because he can't rez while executed), but otherwise it's wasted on squishies over just shooting them; its better used as a get out of jail free card if your Tendril's on cd or if you're really caught with your pants down (waifufags pls leave with your implications) - or in short, use it more like a Fernando ult that can kill over a Drogoz ult that can save. Takes some getting used to not being greedy and going for kills with it but a really nice tool otherwise.

>DAHKNESS
DAHKNESS NIGGA

>Items
Caut 3 because you're retarded and didn't know that already. Any order / items after is personal taste.
Haven and Nimble both work well on improving her survivability, Morale Boost is good once you get used to abusing her ult.
Life Rip boosts her already insane sustain, but is shut down by them Cauting, so don't prioritise. Down to personal preference if you choose Life Rip of Kill2Heal (Vora's case is just that LR is equally viable instead of outclassed by K2H)
Don't take the match-specific reds, you shouldn't be attacking Shields/Deployables anyways, and if you are, you want to do minimal damage to charge your passive up


>Gameplay
Cover is your best friend, peek in and out constantly, and be an overall nuisance that they have to deal with - it will destroy them if left unattended to (like a ninja, not a hitman). Her projectiles have a really long range (with no falloff), so you can find a pretty out-of-action corner to camp and still land hits.
If they let you play without contention, your DoT's will stack, getting you kills - if they chase you, you'll have broken up their backline, which should let your team follow up. You're not in it for trades or dives, so really try not to die.
On the topic of not dying, Vora is a real earlygame limpet, and can keep herself topped off all by herself / sustain until the caut's start showing up and ruining her day; so you should get most of your legwork / aggro done in the early rounds and not sweat if you have to pull back a bit in later rounds. Deceptively bulky, but you should still zigzag behind a wall, not only to be a nuisance that they'll have to chase but later on to cleanse the caut (you're not a frontline though, at best a soul collector seris in terms of bulk).
As for killing shit, while a high IQ move is to deliberately whiff her first (or first three) shots in her chain, the main thing is to just stack them on one target. Spreading them will have the entire enemy chase you (which is bad), while a well placed Siphon on top of a focused target can doom (not kill, you need to wait for the DoT) a squishy before they notice. Avoid frontlines, and figure out who's doing the peel for their team so you can focus them first before the support (if anyone's even doing that)
Don't focus on her charge mechanic while shooting, it's just a passive buff for her Siphon. If you're out of combat / can't see an enemy and see something like a leftover deployable, charge up from there.

Overall, she plays way more passively than the other flanks (nowhere near ones like Buck or Talus just chewing backlines up), but at the same time don't fall into the mental trap of playing her 'too' passively. She's still supposed to do damage and get kills, it's just that playing her more conservatively will mean you're the trademark piece of shit pain in the neck to have to try to deal with.
