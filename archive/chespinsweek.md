I awaken early in the morning, the light of dawn shining through my bedroom window. Wooper is snoozing next to me as usual, and the bed feels as comfy as ever. Yawning, I stretch out my arms, climbing out of bed. The movement wakes Wooper up, and it isn't long before he's standing up as well. “G'morning, Arthur!” He's got that big ol' smile on his face again, a look that never fails to cheer me up.
“Morning, Wooper! Looks like another beautiful day outside. What're we gonna do today? Relax in the garden? Head into town for some sweets? Got any ideas?”
“Oh, I got one! How about going over to that one lake? We could pack some food and spend the day there snacking and swimming!”
“Great idea, Wooper!” I fetch my bag, slinging it around my shoulder. “Let's grab some breakfast and begin packing.”

After breakfast, we start towards the storeroom before being interrupted by a familiar voice. “Team Cozy! Good to see you.”
I turn my head, spotting a Quagsire and Gastrodon near the guild's entrance. “Team Marsh? Wooper and I were just getting ready to take a little day trip. What're you doing here?”
The two approach us, Berry beginning to speak. “Mmm, we've heard tales of a special treasure far away, and are going on a little expedition. One that'll be longer than the one we all took to Mt. Thunder, hmm?”
“Really?! That's awesome!” Wooper sounds thrilled at the prospect.
“Are you sure about this?” I look down at my bag. “I mean, we just had a long trip not too long ago.”
Squishy takes over speaking this time, saying, “Oh, you don't need to worry about it, Chespin. The treasure is deep within a dungeon in the sea.”
A sea dungeon? “So uh, how am I gonna go with?”
Berry gives me a concerned look. “Hmm, how do I put this...You aren't. Or rather, you can't come with because you can't breathe underwater. We're here to take Wooper with us.”

I hear a small thud as my bag slides off my shoulders, hitting the ground. “B-but...Wooper and I are a team...We've done e-everything together since I found him! We haven't been apart for even a couple hours after we met! He's...always at my side!”
My reaction catches Squishy off-guard. “Worry not, Chespin, it'll only be for a week.”
The former good mood I had before is completely shattered, the plans for the day ruined. Now I feel nothing but worry and fear. “But what if something happens to you guys? What if Wooper doesn't come back?! Isn't there some kind of berry I can eat that'll let me breathe underwater? Some seed or orb, anything!?”
Berry shakes her head. “Hmm, nothing like that exists, sorry Chespin.”
Wooper nudges me. “We'll be okay, Chespin. You've seen how strong my parents are, remember?”
“B-b-but...” I look around frantically, trying desperately to think up a way to talk them out of it.

Wooper steps in front of me, a look of concern on his face. Lowering his voice, he says, “It's a dungeon in the ocean, Arthur. Our enemies are going to be a bunch of fish. Water heals us, remember? We can't possibly fail.”
I lower my voice as well, whispering. “But...what do I do?! I'm so used to doing everything with you that...”
“It'll be fine, promise! Besides, you can get to know all the other guildmates even better! ...Just trust us on this. I've never let you down, have I?” Seeing me shake my head, Wooper continues with, “I'll be sure to bring back some treasure just for you, okay?”
I let out a long sigh, relenting. There's no way I'm going to win this one. “Okay...Just, please, be as careful as possible.”
“Ah, but of course, Chespin! A family of explorers is a force to be reckoned with, after all!” Squishy motions towards the exit. “Let us be off! We have much swimming to do!”

I give Wooper a tight hug before setting him down. I watch wordlessly as my best friend leaves the guild with his parents. Once they're out of sight, I reach down to grab my bag, still expecting to see Wooper next to me. But he isn't. It's only at that moment that the true gravity of the situation slams into me like a ton of bricks.

I'm alone.
