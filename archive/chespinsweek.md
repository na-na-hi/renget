I awaken early in the morning, the light of dawn shining through my bedroom window. Wooper is snoozing next to me as usual, and the bed feels as comfy as ever. Yawning, I stretch out my arms, climbing out of bed. The movement wakes Wooper up, and it isn't long before he's standing up as well. “G'morning, Arthur!” He's got that big ol' smile on his face again, a look that never fails to cheer me up.
“Morning, Wooper! Looks like another beautiful day outside. What're we gonna do today? Relax in the garden? Head into town for some sweets? Got any ideas?”
“Oh, I got one! How about going over to that one lake? We could pack some food and spend the day there snacking and swimming!”
“Great idea, Wooper!” I fetch my bag, slinging it around my shoulder. “Let's grab some breakfast and begin packing.”

After breakfast, we start towards the storeroom before being interrupted by a familiar voice. “Team Cozy! Good to see you.”
I turn my head, spotting a Quagsire and Gastrodon near the guild's entrance. “Team Marsh? Wooper and I were just getting ready to take a little day trip. What're you doing here?”
The two approach us, Berry beginning to speak. “Mmm, we've heard tales of a special treasure far away, and are going on a little expedition. One that'll be longer than the one we all took to Mt. Thunder, hmm?”
“Really?! That's awesome!” Wooper sounds thrilled at the prospect.
“Are you sure about this?” I look down at my bag. “I mean, we just had a long trip not too long ago.”
Squishy takes over speaking this time, saying, “Oh, you don't need to worry about it, Chespin. The treasure is deep within a dungeon in the sea.”
A sea dungeon? “So uh, how am I gonna go with?”
Berry gives me a concerned look. “Hmm, how do I put this...You aren't. Or rather, you can't come with because you can't breathe underwater. We're here to take Wooper with us.”

I hear a small thud as my bag slides off my shoulders, hitting the ground. “B-but...Wooper and I are a team...We've done e-everything together since I found him! We haven't been apart for even a couple hours after we met! He's...always at my side!”
My reaction catches Squishy off-guard. “Worry not, Chespin, it'll only be for a week.”
The former good mood I had before is completely shattered, the plans for the day ruined. Now I feel nothing but worry and fear. “But what if something happens to you guys? What if Wooper doesn't come back?! Isn't there some kind of berry I can eat that'll let me breathe underwater? Some seed or orb, anything!?”
Berry shakes her head. “Hmm, nothing like that exists, sorry Chespin.”
Wooper nudges me. “We'll be okay, Chespin. You've seen how strong my parents are, remember?”
“B-b-but...” I look around frantically, trying desperately to think up a way to talk them out of it.

Wooper steps in front of me, a look of concern on his face. Lowering his voice, he says, “It's a dungeon in the ocean, Arthur. Our enemies are going to be a bunch of fish. Water heals us, remember? We can't possibly fail.”
I lower my voice as well, whispering. “But...what do I do?! I'm so used to doing everything with you that...”
“It'll be fine, promise! Besides, you can get to know all the other guildmates even better! ...Just trust us on this. I've never let you down, have I?” Seeing me shake my head, Wooper continues with, “I'll be sure to bring back some treasure just for you, okay?”
I let out a long sigh, relenting. There's no way I'm going to win this one. “Okay...Just, please, be as careful as possible.”
“Ah, but of course, Chespin! A family of explorers is a force to be reckoned with, after all!” Squishy motions towards the exit. “Let us be off! We have much swimming to do!”

I give Wooper a tight hug before setting him down. I watch wordlessly as my best friend leaves the guild with his parents. Once they're out of sight, I reach down to grab my bag, still expecting to see Wooper next to me. But he isn't. It's only at that moment that the true gravity of the situation slams into me like a ton of bricks.

I'm alone.


==A Week Without Wooper==

[TOC]

####Day 1:
Day 1:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EXItBeo288


Even if he's with his parents... losing Wooper is my biggest fear! He's the reason I've been able to fight past my anxieties and go on adventures. He's the heavy hitter in our team, an unending source of cheer, and my best friend! I know him better than anybody I've ever known in my life, he's somebody I can trust with anything and everything. But now that he's gone for awhile, what am I supposed to do?! I clench my eyes shut as I try to think of something, tears beginning to form. I guess I'll just... go back to bed.


I try not to look anybody else in the eyes as I make the agonizingly long walk back to my room. I feel incredibly exposed and vulnerable without my trusted partner at my side, and I find myself tightly clutching my bag against my chest.
Finally in front of my room, I look up as I reach for the doorknob. Before I can open the door, I hear a gasp from nearby. Whipping my head towards the noise, I spot a very worried Toge.


“U-Umm... a-are y-you okay Che-Chespin?” He fiddles with his hands, a look of concern on his face. “W-where's Wo-Wooper?”
Trying not to look directly at him, I stare at the ground. “Wooper's gone... he w-”
Toge cuts me off with a loud, terrified gasp. “G-gone?! What happened to him, why didn't you save him?!”
His sudden outburst causes me to yell back at him. “I COULDN'T stop him! His parents came and took him on a... treasure hunt. In some place called Miracle Sea. Where I can't breathe. So I couldn't go...”
Toge's face shifts to one of horror as he realizes he just shouted at me. “I-I u-u-umm... d-didn't kn-know... s-s-sorry...”
I let out a sigh. “It's fine, honest...But what am I going to do? Apart from an hour or two a couple times, Wooper's NEVER left my side since I first woke up in this world. He's the second half of the team, and he always helps cheer me up. Without him... there's no Team Cozy.”
Toge's lower lip begins to tremble upon hearing this. “N-no Team C-cozy...? B-but... th-that can't b-be true!”
Before I can respond, Toge runs off, his hands covering his face as he quietly sobs. 


Entering my room, I crawl back into bed, feeling incredibly lonely. Without Wooper, the only thing I have to hug while falling asleep is his pillow. Why did his parents have to show up? Why couldn't they have heard about treasure in a forest or something?! I let out a frustrated groan as I stare out the window, trying to fall back asleep as my thoughts only serve to make me feel sadder.
I'm finally snapped out of my gloom by a knock at my door some time later.
“What?!” I yell, frustrated.
“Ch-chespin, o-open the door!” 
I'd know that stutter anywhere. Still laying in bed, I reach a vine over to turn the doorknob. Throwing the door open, I let out a gasp at what I see.

Toge stands there wearing a light-blue cloak over his body, with three horizontal dark-blue lines crudely drawn across the front. I can also spot a light-blue “tail” hastily sewn onto the back. Over his head, he wears a bag sloppily painted light blue, with eye holes poked out and a large smile drawn over the front of it. Sticks poke out the sides of the bag, completing the ensemble.
I do a double-take, not believing what stands before me. Getting to my feet, I say, “You... made a Wooper costume?”
“Y-yeah, haha... J-just trying to ch-cheer you up.” Toge tries to walk forward, bumping against the doorway. I-I was th-thinking... m-maybe I could be y-your p-p-partner for a b-bit?”
Even through my gloom, I can't help but crack a smile at the homemade Wooper costume. “heh... Great costume, Toge. You seriously went through all that effort to try and make me feel better?”
“Y-you r-really like it? I-it was hard to make it l-look good on s-such sho-short notice.”
I nod. “It's kinda funny, actually. But uh, maybe don't wear that when we head out, alright? We might get some weird looks if you go out dressed like another guild member.”


“A-aww...” Toge takes the bag off of his head. “S-so um... wh-what were you and W-wooper going to d-do?”
I glance over at my bag. “We were going to spend a day at the lake. It was one of the first places I visited with him. I had even packed some food for the trip.”
“M-m-maybe we could g-go there a-anyways?”
It's not a bad idea, but there's still one thought in the back of my mind. “Uhh... What about that psychopath you used to call a partner? What if he found us?”
Toge stares down at the floor. “I-I know Dewott... A-after his last a-appearance... and how s-so many fought h-him, he's l-likely too w-wary of showing b-back up for a little b-bit. W-we'll be okay, but p-pack an O-Orb just in c-case.”
“Gotcha.” Reaching into a nearby drawer, I grab a Petrify Orb. “Alright, time to head for the lake.” Deciding to indulge him, I say, “Ready to head out... 'partner?'”
“Y-yes!”

Toge and I head out across the fields as I lead the way to the lake. He flies alongside me, looking around nervously. I keep looking to my other side, half-expecting to see Wooper, but of course, nothing.
To my surprise, Toge is the first to break the silence. "S-s-so u-umm... c-can you t-tell me ab-about how you met W-W-Wooper?"
I look up at the sky as I recall my first day. “When I first woke up here,  I was near a pond, so I went to go take a look at myself. Wooper emerged from the pond right then and there. He pretty much forced me to take him along, actually.”
“S-so how d-did you two b-become so cl-close?”


I rub the back of my head. “Well... It just kinda happened. At first it was me aiming him like a gun, then  I'd help him eat, we'd share a few drinks, and eventually it turned into me protecting him from harm by using my own body as a shield. Then there was a... turning point of sorts.”
Toge lets out a small gasp. “A t-turning p-point?”
I nod. “You remember a little while back where we were in each other's bodies? Well, the guy that did that to us was an outlaw once. When we tried to catch him, he swapped us as a way to escape.” I let out a long sigh. “Those were some of the most stressful days of my life. Then that night I tried to sleep and it was too cold, a-and...” I let out a loud cough, too embarrassed to say any more about it. “A-Anyways, you know what happened. We've done basically everything together since we've met.”


Surprisingly, Toge doesn't respond. I look to my side, finding him to be lost in thought, and...is he drooling?! I tap him on the shoulder with a vine, saying, “You alright?”
“W-wha?!” Toge looks around quickly, startled. “O-Oh! U-U-Uh... S-Sorry... I-I g-got caught u-up in y-your st-story..." 
Something about that seemed a little unusual, but I'll let it slide. “Do you have any other questions?”
“D-did you have o-other friends before w-Wooper?”
“In my old life, sort of.” I cringe a little, thinking on my past. “I don't like thinking about that, though. They weren't very good friends. I can trust Wooper with my life, but... I couldn't even trust them enough to show up.”
“I-I can relate... S-so Wooper's the b-best friend you've e-ever had?”
“You bet! I'd be crazy to think otherwise. But... he's not here now...”


Toge's voice takes on a more serious tone upon hearing my sadness returning. “I-I know I'm no replacement for W-Wooper... b-but I'm still your friend! A-A lot of us at the guild are... I know you can make it through this w-week, Chespin!" 
I let out a long sigh. “Thanks for trying to cheer me up again. I just... have to try not to dwell on it for now, right?”
“R-right!” Toge flies upwards, putting his hand on his forehead as he gazes out across the field. “Th-the lake is coming up!”
“Finally!”

The two of us pick up the pace, not stopping until we're at the lake. Light shimmers off of the water's surface, flowers bloom along the shores, and the only sounds are that of the water lapping against the shoreline. Eager to rest my legs, I set my bag down near a tree, picking a spot in the grass to lie in. The sunlight washes away the mild soreness from walking for so long, forcing a sigh of relief out of me as my green spots begin to glow from the sun's energy. 
I hear a small gasp from nearby, followed by a  “Th-that's cool... w-what's it feel like?”
Turning my head, I see Toge looking at me. Running one of my hands over my quills, I say, “Oh, if only you knew how great this is. Wipes out soreness and pain of any kind, wakes me up, makes me feel happier... It's a real pick-me-up in every sense of the word!”
“K-kinda like my joy dust, then?”
“Sorta, only the sunlight heals as well.” 

-----

Standing back up, I stretch out my arms and vines. “Alright, time for a little swim.” Turning to Toge again, I ask, “You remember that thing we did that one time? Can you throw me into the lake?”
“A-are you sure?!”
“Yeah, I'm sure. Relax, I can swim.”
“O-Okay...”
Toge grabs hold of my hands, lifting me upwards. I feel the wind pick up a little as we ascend, Toge's wings flapping faster and faster. Once we're up high enough, Toge asks me if I'm ready. I nod, and he throws me down at the water! I curl up in midair, plunging into the water with a big splash!
The water ends up being colder than I had anticipated, causing me to freeze up as I sink deeper into the water! Shivering a little, I swim back up to the surface, taking in a deep breath as I spit out some water. “Ugh, colder than I thought...”
Toge gently flies downward, dipping into the water nearby. “I-it's not that cold.” I see him shiver a little.


I tread water for a little while, growing accustomed to the temperature. I start to swim slowly, the water feeling pleasant as I do so. Getting a little curious, I wonder if swimming with my vines is any easier. I let out my vines, beginning to do breaststrokes and backstrokes with them. It doesn't feel any faster than simply paddling with my hands, but it certainly seems a bit more manageable. Toge floats nearby, looking up at the sky. Rolling over in the water, I do the same as I watch the clouds pass on by, thinking on the situation.


Toge's friendly and all, but he's not as cheerful as Wooper is. He genuinely seems to enjoy my company, which is nice, but watching Wooper jet around in the water, swimming circles around me, leaping into the air and doing flips, holding onto him as he ferries me around at high speeds... That's half the fun of going for swims! I can't help but feel guilty for wishing that he was my current company instead. When Wooper comes back, maybe Toge can come along for swims as well?
Toge swims alongside me. “W-what's wrong, Chespin? I-is it Wooper?”
“He's so much fun to watch on swimming trips, I can't help but think about it. You should come with us for another one sometime.”
“Th-that'd be nice...”
The two of us spend roughly an hour swimming and splashing around in the lake. I try to dive down and touch the bottom a few times, but never end up making it. From time to time, I catch glimpses of real happiness underneath Toge's normal timidness, something I rarely see back at the guild. It still feels a little awkward having someone look up to me so much, but it's not a bad feeling.

-----

Eventually, I start to grow hungry, and we climb out of the lake to dry off in the sun. Once we're dry, I begin to dig out the food I packed earlier. Sandwiches, cookies, and assorted berries are there, as well as some bottled berry juice. As we eat, Toge is the first to speak.
“I-it's really pretty out here...”
“You got that right. If the guild didn't pan out, I'd have tried to get a little house built out here, a place for me and... Wooper...” Finishing my sandwich, I reach for the cookies. I take a bite, but the taste catches me offguard. “These aren't chocolate chips, they're RAISINS! Oh, come on!”
“I-I like oatmeal raisin, though...” Toge bites into his cookie, gasping at the taste. “Th-these aren't raisins, they're chocolate ch-chips!”
“Are you serious?!” I rummage through the bag once again, taking a closer look at the cookies. They all look identical at first glance, the slight rumples on the surface the only sign of oatmeal raisin. “Great, we've got chocolate chip cookies and mimics for dessert.”
“Th-they're not that bad, h-honest. M-maybe you like them now and don't know it, Chespin?”
Shrugging, I take another bite of the ruse cookie, focusing on the taste. Now that I know what it truly is, it's... actually not that bad?? “That's weird, I HATED these stupid things as a human, and yet... Maybe that old woman's got a few tricks up her sleeve.”
“Sh-she seems good at b-baking...”

The food finished, I dig out the best part of the picnic. “Ever have a Gummi drink? Got a few sodas here.”
Toge shakes his head. “N-no... I-I usually stick to normal j-juice.”
I hand him a bottle filled with a light-blue liquid. “Here you go, this seems like it'll be up your alley.”
“Th-thanks.” The two of us pop the corks off our respective bottles, clink them together, and take a sip. Toge gasps at the flavor. “I-It tastes like really fizzy cotton c-candy?!” Taking another drink, he says “This is r-really sweet... I-I don't think I've had anything this s-sweet since I've b-been here.”
“It's pretty good, ain't it? I was thrilled when I saw this stuff for the first time.”
“M-Maybe I should get a few bottles for the st-storeroom.”


We continue sipping on the sodas. After a minute of this, Toge turns to me, his expression shifted to one of comfort. “You know, Chespin, you're a really good friend. I wish I had a friend like you when I was still human. If I did, I'd actually have a reason to want to go back.”
“Hey, thanks, that's...” Wait a minute, he didn't stutter? That's the first time I've ever heard him speak without stuttering, outside of one of his trademark rants that is. Is he that comfortable around me? Is it the drink? Deciding not to draw attention to it, I say, “Yeah, my friends before all this were pretty lame. Most of you guys at the guild are pretty cool.”
“Yep, but Team Cozy's the besht of the bunch in my eyesh.” He's slurring his words already?
“Glad to have a fan, in that case.”
“Yesh, true blue Cozy fan riiight here, betterrr believe it... Hey, waitta minute, are 'dese drinks alcoholic?”


...Yep, it's the drink taking away his stutter. “Oh uh, forgot to mention that little bit. Whoops!” He hasn't even drank half of his bottle! Talk about a lightweight.
“Youshe betta know I's ain't old enuff ta drink, Cheshpin.” Despite this, Toge takes a big sip of his drink instantly afterwards.
“Ah, relax, as far as I know there ain't a legal drinking age in this world. Besides, ain't like I had to show an ID to pick these up.”
Finishing the bottle, Toge stands up, stumbling from side to side. “Jusht another crime... ta add to da lisht...” Losing his balance completely, he falls forward, lightly landing on the grass.
Finishing the last sip I had left, I say, “Uhh... Toge? You alright?” I walk over to him, turning him over. He's passed out drunk. “I can't believe this, really? From a single bottle? Guess I gotta carry you now.” Sighing, I wrap my vines around him, lifting him up as hard as I can... and end up almost flinging him into the air as a result! He's way lighter than I had expected! Least it'll make carrying him back easy. With Toge in tow, I grab my bag and begin the walk back to the guild.


The silence on the walk back is deafening. Worry creeps back into my mind like a weed as I realize that I'm out in the wide open, carrying someone who passed out. I've never even been outside of town on my own, but being in this situation somehow feels worse than being purely alone! What if someone comes to try and rob us? What if Dewott is lurking about and catches us like this?!
I can't handle being all alone. Toge's gotta wake up! Shaking him in my vines a little, I say, “Umm... rise and shine?” Nope, nothing.
Screw this, I might have something stored away that'll help. Looking in my bag, I spot a green and white seed with a yellow spot at the end of it. Perfect! Lowering Toge to the ground, I open his mouth and drop the seed into it. Seconds later, he stirs awake, and I let out a sigh of relief.


“Ugh... h-head h-hurts a l-lot... d-did I hit my h-head again?”
I let out a nervous laugh. “No, but... how do I put this? You had a gummi drink and I kind of forgot to tell you they were alcoholic?”
“I-I g-got d-d-drunk?!” Toge covers his face with his hands, looking away from me.
“If it makes you feel better, it happened to me the first time I got ahold of some Gummi drinks. Didn't even realize until Wooper started giggling at what I was saying.”
“I-I'm s-sorry Chespin... I p-probably looked like a c-complete moron... Agh...” Toge clutches his head, shaking.
“Must be a hangover, but that seed I fed you is supposed to cure them. Maybe it's different because you were asleep?” I look through the bag for another seed, but find none. “Think you can tough it out until we return to the guild?”
“M-mhmm...” Toge mumbles, his voice sounding pained.

-----
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iskv6DyiSXs


I begin jogging back to Capim, still carrying Toge in my vines. I don't want to be caught out in the middle of nowhere after dark, especially without Wooper's glowing ability. Toge is light enough to not slow me down too much, and we manage to get back to the guild by sunset. The other guild members give us strange looks as I run to the storeroom, digging out a Heal Seed for Toge. He eats it, letting out a long sigh of relief as I set him down.
“Phew... T-today was nice, even despite... y-you know.”
“It sure beat my plan of laying in bed all day, that's for sure. So uh... Now what?”
Toge fidgets with his hands. “H-have you ever seen the sunset from a-atop the guild? It's really n-nice.”
I shrug. “Nope, but I'm up for it.”
“G-good!”


Once back outside, Toge flies me up to the roof of the guild, where we sit and watch the sun set over the ocean. The ocean... “Wooper and his family are somewhere out there... Are they okay?”
“I-I'm sure they're f-fine, Chespin! H-his parents must be very powerful if th-they even outrank Team B-Buckler...”
“I think it's because Wooper's parents hunted down outlaws for a long time? You know... If Wooper's father met someone who actually did save the world, he'd be floored. Then he'd want to see their power firsthand.”
Toge gasps. “H-he'd fight them?!”
I let out a tiny laugh. “Absolutely. Seeing him in action is something else, but he doesn't seem to go all out unless he knows someone hurt...Wooper.”
“Oh! S-so Wooper MUST be pretty safe, e-even out on his adventure right now!”
I look back over the ocean, a hint of sadness in my voice. “Maybe you're right...The things I saw his parents do to that stupid filthy CHILLER Abomasnow could probably be considered war crimes back in the old world.”
“W-what'd they do to that... ch-ch-chiller?”
I hold back a tiny chuckle upon hearing Toge say my made-up slur. “Well, I probably shouldn't say, because it was pretty heavy. Just know that it absolutely destroyed that CHILLER'S spirit, and he had it coming.”
“O-oh my! U-umm...” Toge flies up from his spot, hovering nearby. “Y-you probably don't have to worry about Wooper i-in that case.”
“I know, but... I miss him already.”


-----


The orange skies slowly blend into a purplish-pink color as the sun sets over the water, followed by a dark lavender. Darkness falls as night arrives, and I can see tiny lights come on throughout the town. Toge flies me back off the roof, and we head back inside.
Once inside, I cringe at the sight of one specific guild member. Cyndaquil. He eyes the two of us up, a grin coming across his face.
“Ooh, Wooper's gone for not even a day and you've already got a new boyfriend? Is it gonna be my turn next?” A blush forms on his face.
Upon hearing what he said about Wooper and I, I snap.


Without even thinking about it, I shoot my vines towards Cyndaquil, holding him in the air as I squeeze my vines around him, with one thought on my mind. Choking him unconscious. 
“We're ***NOTHING*** like that! How **DARE** you say such vile things about Wooper and I! Oh, but I bet you still want 'your turn' despite that, huh?? Well, here it is, you filthy ***BURNOUT!”*** I squeeze the vines tighter, hoping to try teaching him a lesson. “*NEVER* say anything of that sort about Wooper **EVER** again, got it?!”
*“A-aaack... what's my... s-safeword...”* I hear Cyndaquil struggling to breathe in my grasp. 
Figures, this degenerate is going to be a degenerate until the very end. “Your safeword is 'I'll never talk about Wooper like that again.' Well? Are you gonna say it?”
*“A-are you... still... fair game?”*
I launch Cyndaquil into a wall as hard as I can, the impact rattling a nearby shelf hard enough to send a couple books falling to the floor. “Disgusting half-black creature, get out of my sight.” Cyndaquil lies on the floor, dazed and gasping for air.


Retracting my vines, I shudder. “Ugh... I feel dirty just laying my vines on him.”
The look on Toge's face shifts to one of excitement. "Cyndaquil had it coming, only a TRUE patrician could understand the purity of Team Cozy's perfect friendship!" Uh oh, he's ranting again. “Why, there's absolutely NOTHING wrong wi-”
Cutting him off before he can go any further, I yell, “ANYWAYS, Toge, I'm going to bed.” I begin walking towards my room.
Toge follows alongside me. “O-oh right, s-so um... m-maybe I could c-come? Y-you know, s-since Wooper isn't a-arou-”
“No.” Looking around, I whisper to him, saying, “It's awkward enough having you know about that, but doing what you're implying?”
“Y-yeah... I-I was only k-kidding a-after all, h-haha...” Toge says, letting out a very nervous laugh.
Getting to my room, I climb into my bed. “If you want to help out, can you help me fall asleep some other way?”
Toge lets out a loud, long yawn. “Y-yeah... does that help? The y-yawn, I mean.”
I can't hold back a yawn myself. “I actually feel... really sleepy now?”
“Th-then it worked! U-umm... goodnight Chespin.” Toge closes the door behind him, and I'm left alone in my room.

-----

Even with Toge's help, I don't fall asleep right away. I feel really uncomfortable without Wooper nearby, and I try to make up for it by hugging his pillow, but...it's not the same. The only sounds in the room are my own thoughts as I look out at the starry sky.
I can't help but wonder, Is Wooper having trouble sleeping without his normal bed of cotton and blankets? Is he worrying about me as well? I hope everything will be okay for him.
As I drift off to sleep, I think back to the things Cyndaquil said, and what I did in retaliation. One thought rings out stronger than the rest.


I hope I sent him to the infirmary.
####Day 2:
“What?! You CAN'T be serious!!”

I find myself stood before the guildmaster, who just moments ago gave me an unthinkable task for today. “Surely there has to be someone else that can do this, literally ANYBODY else but me!”

“The outlaw is a dangerous one and everybody else is on their own jobs for the day. Team Misfits will surely need your help, kyukyu~” He twirls a wand around, as if to rub it in. “Besides, you should be able to easily take on that Marshtomp and bring them to justice~”

“But...They're the dregs of the guild! The ones that give us a bad rap! The reason the feds were so antagonistic towards us! The ones with that SICKO Cyndaquil!”

“Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles. Speaking of which, looks like they're here~!” I turn around, my heart sinking at the sight I see before me. A Phanpy with a Torchic walk up to me, accompanied by a Totodile drinking something out of a bottle as well as that degenerate from last night with a bandage around his head. This group is such a downgrade from Wooper that it borders on parody. I look back at the guildmaster, but he's already gone.

The Phanpy looks me over. “You're the one that put him in the infirmary?”

"I don't know what he thought would happen," the Torchic says bluntly. At least these two seem somewhat sane.

Cyndaquil looks at me, without a hint of shame or remorse on his face. “You know, I thought if I was ever going to go to the hospital for asphyxiation that it would be self-inflicted.” Totodile merely stands nearby, drinking from one of his many bottles.

“... You've got the right idea, Totodile. What do you have?” I ask, eager for anything that'll numb the pain of being around Cyndaquil.

“Whiskey, vodka, scotch, that kinda stuff!” Totodile holds a bottle out towards me. “Want some?”

“Too strong for me.” Shaking my head, I run to my room, grabbing a couple Gummi drinks. I walk back to the others, taking a long sip from one of the bottles. “... Let's just get this over with. Where's this outlaw hiding so I can hurry up and feed him a Solarbeam? I got things I'd rather be doing like NOT hanging out with Cyndaquil.”

“Hey, I'm not that bad! You could come to my room where I could show you my s-OUCH!”

Phanpy had smacked Cyndaquil in the back of the head with his trunk. “Keep it to yourself before he puts you in the hospital again.” 

“Okay, okay, sheesh... did you have to hit my bruise?” Cyndaquil rubs the back of his head, wincing in pain.

Torchic looks at me, rolling her eyes. For a moment, we share a silent moment of understanding. Opening her beak to speak, she says, “The outlaw is holed up somewhere on Mt. Bristle. It's a couple of hours away, but if we leave now we might be able to get back without having to set up camp.”

I nod. “Alright, let's get moving then.” I finish off my drink, stuffing the empty bottle back in my bag.

The five of us begin the trek across the plains towards Mt. Bristle. The drink from earlier does its work, washing away my (merited) fear of being stuck on the same team as Cyndaquil. Though I only had one drink, Totodile seems to already be working on his second drink, showing no signs of stopping.

“Do you always drink this much?” I ask.

“You betcha! Makes trips a lot more fun!” Totodile shows me another bottle from his bag. “You sure you don't want one?”

“~~More like makes trips with Cyndaquil more tolerable... ~~I'll stick with the Gummi drinks.”

“Please don't get completely wasted until after we bring the outlaw in, Totodile.” Torchic says.

I let out a small sigh. “So apart from burning forests down, how good are you guys at fighting?”

“I'm a lover, not a fighter,” Cyndaquil says. “But if we have to fight, I know how to use items.”

“Torchic rides on my back and shoots fire at foes, while I charge the enemy head on,” Phanpy says.

“I can shoot water at them, and there was also that time I smashed a bottle over someone's head!” Totodile says, jingling his bag of bottles.

While none of them sound even remotely as capable as Wooper, I find myself liking how Totodile thinks. “I smashed a bottle over a chiller's head once myself. ~~Score one for the good guys.~~”

Torchic gives me a curious look. “... Chiller? Oh, right, you're the guy that really hates ice.”

“You don't know the half of it,” I grumble. “At least this mission doesn't involve one as an outlaw. Anyways, I've got vines, Solarbeams, and sharp quills.”

“Then we should be able to make short work of the outlaw with your help,” Phanpy says. “Speaking of which, we're almost there.”

I pick my head up, the base of the mountain only a few minutes away now.  The sight of Mt. Bristle fills me with anxiety, not because of what we might find on it or how the outlaw will fight, but because of how my current 'team' may fight.

-----

The five of us begin our ascent up the small mountainside. The crag and rocks form paths and 'rooms' as we work our way higher. I let my vines out, keeping them at the ready in case I need to grab or throw some dungeonmon. The four give my vines curious glances, but don't comment further on things, returning their focus to the dungeon. It isn't much longer before we find our first foes, two Starly.

Morbidly curious, I say, “Let's see how you guys fight.” Phanpy nods, charging the Starly on the left. The bird flies out of range, but Torchic keeps shooting small fireballs, eventually scoring a hit. The Starly falls out of the air, landing before me. I kneel down to punch it in the face, my fist crackling with electricity as the foe poofs into dust. Out of the corner of my eye, I spot Totodile getting smacked by his enemy's wings as he tries to reach into his bag.

“Need a little he-”

I'm cut off by the sound of shattering glass as Totodile smashes an empty bottle over the Starly's head, the opponent dissolving into nothingness. “All good here!”

“Not bad,” I say. “From what I've heard of you guys I was expecting a lot worse.”

“Gee, thanks.” the Torchic replies, annoyed.

Realizing what I said, I respond with, “I-I didn't mean it like that!”

“We've done harder missions than this,” Phanpy says.

Totodile pulls out another bottle, taking a long sip from it. “C'mon, Chespin! Lighten up, live a little!”

“It's okay, Chespin. Maybe after this I could give you tips on talking to chicks,” Cyndaquil says.

I clench my fist, letting it spark again. Though I'm extremely tempted to hit him, I know it'd just make the mission more annoying if we had to lug around a knocked out teammate. Taking a deep breath, I say, “... We had better keep climbing.”

As we progress, we take on more Starly, as well as some Spinarak and Machops. Further on, we spot a room with several orbs and some cash scattered across the floor. I shoot out my vines, pulling the others back before they can enter it. “Look out, that room's a trap!”

“We know,” Phanpy says. “But the orbs look helpful, and the enemies we've fought seem weak enough.”

“And the cash'll let me get more drinks!” Totodile says, taking a swig.

“Besides, there's no other way forward,” Cyndaquil says in a rare showing of sanity.

“I hope you guys know what you're doing...” I say, retracting my vines and bracing for the inevitable.

-----

The instant we enter the room, roughly a dozen enemies leap out from behind the rocks, surrounding us. To my left, Phanpy charges a Machop head on as Torchic shoots tiny fires at the Spinarak nearby. Totodile shoots water at a couple of Geodude while Cyndaquil hides in the back and throws rocks at a few other foes. As I pull in a Starly of my own to slam my electrified fist into, I find myself thinking that maybe they aren't that bad at dungeon dives after all.

I hear a thud nearby, along with an “Oof!” Looking over, I notice that Phanpy had tripped over a hidden trap, sending Torchic flying. Both of the others run over to help, getting themselves surrounded even more. Well, that thought didn't last long.

“What are you guys DOING?!” I yell as I smack a Geodude with my vines.

I hear somebody yell “Screw this!” as I see a blue light shine from the cluster of Pokemon. A bluish light surrounds the dungeonmons, causing them to vanish mere seconds later! Just like that, all the foes are gone, Cyndaquil standing there with a shattered orb before him.

“~~Surprised you even know how to use those things...~~ That looked more like you warped them away than beat them.” I say. I reach a vine over to some of the cash lying on the ground, pocketing it for myself. It's only fair that I get some small cut of what we find.

“Hey, a win's a win.” Cyndaquil says, pocketing an orb with a picture of a sunny sky on it. The others grab up the rest of the loot as well, and we continue onward.

-----

Near the summit, we spot a campfire with a strange Pokemon near it. They have several fins along their bluish body, and pointy orange gills on the sides of its head. I can also see a black scarf tied around its neck, as well as a blue-orange bracelet around its right arm. Hoping to get the drop on them, I hold my hands skyward, focusing my attention on the sun. My body begins to glow a bright green... and the light alerts the outlaw! I try to shoot a beam at them, but they leap out of the way just in time. I curse to myself, this could have been over just like that!

“Ah, another gang of do-gooders trying to get me? Well...” The outlaw grabs their bag, slinging it around themselves. “Come and get me! You've got no chance against Marshtomp the Malicious!”

The villain fires a jet of water at us, the attack barely missing as all five of us leap out of the way. Trying to keep my voice low, I say, “Distract him so I can get a good hit on him! Do anything it takes!”

Phanpy nods, charging them head on, zigzagging as he closes the distance. Totodile runs just behind him, while Cyndaquil hides behind a rock and takes potshots with more rocks. I remain stood in place, charging up energy for a second shot. All I need is one good hit...

Phanpy narrowly dodges one final blast of water, slamming into the Marshtomp head-on! The impact is so forceful it causes an explosion! My jaw drops upon seeing this, and I yell out “Phanpy's that strong?!”

I hear Cyndaquil's voice from nearby. “He's never done anything close to that before, something ain't right here.”

As the dust clears, I spot Torchic and Phanpy scattered across the ground. Marshtomp stands there with a smirk across his face, barely harmed. “Ahaha! First time seeing an Explosive Band, huh?” The outlaw holds his hands out, waving towards himself. “C'mon, just TRY to make contact with me! Take your best shot, if you dare.”

“Take my best shot?” I yell. “Alright, FINE!” With a shout, I unleash a beam of energy directly at him! I hear a faint gasp just before the beam hits home, kicking up a cloud of dust as it collides with the foe. Exhaling, I say, “Alright, that should be all we gotta... do...”

The outlaw still stands, somehow seeming even less harmed than before! He raises an arm up, his bracelet shimmering in the sunlight. “Thanks to this bad boy, all your little attack did was heal me. I have no weakness! You should all just give up and go home, you don't have a chance against me!”

“~~of all the rotten luck...~~ We gotta get that bracelet off of him!” I yell. “Keep him busy!”

As fire, water, and rocks fly through the air, I look in my bag for something that'll help. Heal Seed, no... Pecha Berry, no... Quick Seed... yes! Stuffing it into my mouth, I feel energy flow into my limbs. I circle around the Marshtomp, who is too busy trying to keep up with the barrage of small fireballs, rocks, and empty beer bottles to keep track of me creeping closer. Hiding behind a nearby rock, I snake my vines out towards the outlaw... who turns around just as they reach him! Thinking fast, I restrain his left arm with one vine, while stealing the bracelet from the other arm with my other vine! I rush to pocket the item, the effects of the seed beginning to wear off.

“I-Hey! Give that back! I stole that fair and square, you can't just go stealing it from m-OW!” One of Cyndaquil's rocks finally meets its mark, bonking him in the head. 

The bad guy's concentration momentarily broken, Torchic and Totodile unleash their attacks into them! Noticing an opening, I leap out from my hiding spot, giving it all I've got with my vines! As I begin to beat our foe into a corner, I see his scarf begin to glow orange! I quickly turn around and run, but end up blown forward by the explosion! I tumble across the rocky ground, wincing as I stand back up, legs wobbly. My 'armor' seems to have helped, but it looks like the other three fighters got caught in the blast. Torchic lies on the ground, while Phanpy and Totodile seem to be having trouble standing.

“Now I've got you guys!” The outlaw laughs, following with, “Now, to take out that annoying moron with the vines!” He inhales, and just as I manage to stand fully upright, he shoots something truly horrifying. An icy beam of energy.

“NOOOOOOOOOO!” I cry out in pain and horror as the beam hits home. But this time is worse than all the others. I try to move, but I can't. Everything is agony. I'm frozen in a block of ice, and all I can do now is watch. Is this how I'm going to die? Fear dominates my mind as I think back to Wooper. What'll he do if he comes back to the guild and I'm gone?

I... I can't let that happen, I have to try and endure! All I can do for now is watch as the outlaw digs out an Oran Berry from his bag, eating it. He fires a blast of water at Phanpy, slamming him against a wall. Out of the corner of my mind I can spot Cyndaquil creeping closer, using me as cover... or at least I hope that's what he's doing. I see him reach into his bag, pulling out the orb he picked up early... Wait! That's a Sunny Orb!

Cyndaquil smashes the orb on the ground, causing bright sunlight to stream into the arena. Even though my icy jail, the light shines onto me, and I focus my entire being on the light. My body begins to glow green once more... will this really work? Cyndaquil throws more rocks at the villain, but he finally takes a direct blast of water! He tries to stand back up, but falls.

“Ahaha! Five of you couldn't even take on one outlaw?” The Marshtomp heads for Cyndaquil's bag. “Pathetic. Just means more loot for me. He begins rummaging through, looking for valuables. 

The green glow is all-encompassing now, the crook is in front of me and distracted, this is my chance! I focus all of my energy into my hands, warming them up. Finally, my beam of light is unleashed, shattering the block of ice entirely! I hear a faint “Oh n-” from the bad guy as my beam hits home, the attack sending him flying into a rocky outcropping hard enough to shake the arena! I gasp for breath as warmth slowly returns to my body, the agonizing pain subsiding as I stuff my face with Oran Berries.

The others manage to pick themselves back up, but the outlaw looks like he's down for the count. I throw berries to the others to help them, and the five of us surround the crook.

“Looks like we've won,” Phanpy says.

I want to celebrate, but deep down, I'm enraged. This enemy FROZE me! My hands begin to shake as I look at the downed foe. Stealing his exploding scarf, I say, “Oh, really? Let's make SURE!” I punctuate my comment by kicking the Marshtomp in the stomach, eliciting a low groan of pain from them. “How do you like that, huh? This'll teach you to freeze me!”

“Relax, Chespin, we won!” Totodile puts his hand on my shoulder. “You know, drinks usually help warm me up when I'm cold. Want a sip?”

I open my mouth to say no, but I hesitate. “... Screw it, why not.” I swipe the booze from Totodile's hand, chugging the small remainder of it down. I cringe at the horribly bitter taste, but it does make me feel a little warmer.

“Alright, Chespin!” A smile crosses Totodile's face. “We oughta go drinking some night!”

“Maybe that wouldn't be a bad idea...” Holding the bottle in my hand, I get an idea. “Hey Totodile, wanna see something cool?”

“Totally!”

Gripping the bottle in a vine, I stretch it up higher and higher into the air... before slamming the bottle over the Marshtomp's head. “Take that, you good-for-nothing thieving **CHILLER.**”

“... Chiller?” Torchic gives me a strange look. “He wasn't even an ice type.”

“He was every bit as bad as one. He got what he deserved.”

“We had better get this guy back to the cops,” Phanpy says.

-----

We make the trek back to Capim, the still KO'd outlaw riding atop Phanpy. Along the way, I realize something. I only broke out of the ice because of that Sunny Orb. The one that... Cyndaquil used. It just had to be him, didn't it?

I take a deep breath, bracing myself. “... Hey, Cyndaquil? Uh... Thanks for using that Sunny Orb. I'd probably still be frozen if you hadn't done that.”

“You're welcome. It also helped us beat the bad guy.”

“Yeah... Thanks for that, too.”

“So, now that I've helped you out, maybe you could return the favor and come pick up chicks with me later tonight? You could learn the tools of the trade from a master pickup artist.” Cyndaquil gives me a little smirk. “Or we could just have a lad's night out, just the two of us.”

“I think I'd rather remain encased in ice,” I say bluntly. “You seriously can't resist taking any chance you get, can you?”

“You miss 100% of the shots you don't take, Chespin.”

I roll my eyes. “From the sound of things it seems like you miss 100% of the shots you *DO* take.”

“You should learn to live a little, Chespin. Come join Team Onlyphans on a night on the town sometime.”

His team name catches me completely off-guard. I stifle a chuckle at Cyndaquil's made up name, saying, “I thought you guys were Team Misfits?”

“I like my name better,” Cyndaquil says with a smile.

I glance over at Torchic, who says, “It's a good thing he doesn't get to decide those things.”

-----

The five of us dump the outlaw off at the sheriff's office, a Druddigon there handing us our cash reward Taking it back to the guild's dining hall, Phanpy splits it into 5 sections, sliding one towards me. “Couldn't have done it without you today, Chespin.”

“Thanks.” I pocket the coins, wondering what I'll buy with them. “Well, today has been... interesting. But a team like this is a little too... big for what I usually work with. It's usually just me and... Wooper... He's off with his parents on some expedition.”

Torchic takes note of my tone of voice, saying, “I know you're probably worried about him, but if a team like ours can manage to tackle outlaws and missions, then Wooper will be fine.”

“I hope you're right, can't stop worrying...” Letting out a yawn, I say, “I had better get to bed now, good night.”

The others wave me off, Cyndaquil surprisingly not slipping one final comment in, much to my relief.
