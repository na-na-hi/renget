#Intro to the Clover Guild (F.A.Q.)

[TOC2]

##Good lord what is happening in this thread?! Are you roleplaying?!

~~Aurora borealis~~
It's not actual roleplaying, but collaborative writing. The gist of it is that we imagine what would happen if a bunch of anons got transported to the PMD world and decided to form a guild (Clover Guild). Then, we create characters, write stories, and make art about them. We also discuss the setting and what kind of shenanigans these characters would be involved with. It's similar to how the SCP Foundation community started, if you're familiar with that.

##Interesting... I want to learn more.

You can go [here](https://rentry.org/vpmdclover) to read some of the stories written by us and get a feel of what this is all about.

##There are so many stories! Where do I even start?

It's recommended to start with [Gathering](https://rentry.org/h3fdu) as it is the "origin story" of the Clover Guild and is where several of the characters meet each other.

After that there are some good options:

- Read them in the [order of publication](https://rentry.org/vpmdclover#list-of-stories-sorted-by-time-published).
- Read them in the chronological order shown in the [story timeline]( https://rentry.org/vpmdclover#story-timeline). (Some stories aren’t lsited there yet)
- Got to the [list of stories sorted by author](https://rentry.org/vpmdclover#list-of-stories-sorted-by-author), pick an author, read their stories, then move to another author.

##Sounds fun! How do I join?

Just imagine what Pokémon you would want to be transformed into and come up with a story for them. Or, if you don't want to make a self-insert, you can create a character and come up with a personality and traits.
You also have the option of not creating any characters and just draw/write stuff involving the existing ones.

##But I suck at writing/drawing!

==**That's fine!**==

We have authors/artists with varying levels of skill, and even people who never wrote or drew anything before taking part in these threads. We also have people who only write and people who only draw. This is all for fun and we enjoy seeing different writing/drawing styles.

If you've never written a story before, now is a good time to give it a try!
If you've never drawn anything before, just grab a piece of paper or download a drawing program like Krita and give it a go! One anon here made a [Sketching Tutorial](https://rentry.org/CloverGuildDrawingTutorial).

##I'm having a hard time coming up with a character!

The first thing you should keep in mind is that **this is 4Chan**. What this means is that you don't have to feel pressured into creating super serious and deep characters. To give you some examples of how *unique* our cast of characters is, we have:
- A coomer Cyndaquil.
- A drunkard Totodile.
- A former McDonalds employee Numel who can't leave old habits behind.
- An autistic Togetic.

That's not to say that you have to make a meme-spewer joke character. The point is that **you can make whatever kind of character you want!**

Now for some tips:
- You don't have to make only one character. Some authors create multiple characters to use in their stories (usually Character + Partner).
- The characters don't have to be part of the guild. We have a Linoone and a Delibird who work in postal services, and a Noivern who is part of an independent guildless team.
- The characters don't have to be former humans. To give you some examples, one anon's character is a cook Munchlax, while another anon's is an aura specialist Combusken, both being natives to the PMD world.
- Making an OP flawless character can make it difficult to write about them in the long term. On the other hand, giving them flaws and goals can open up many story possibilities.
- There is no set rule against having your character be a legendary/mythical Pokémon, but be aware that it takes a skilled writer to make the character not come off as a "muh super special OC" unless we're talking about the "low tier" ones, like Shaymin or Manaphy.
- We have an [idea bin](https://rentry.org/cloverIdeabin) where people put ideas that they don't feel like executing or don't feel competent enough to pull off. Reading through it might give you some inspiration!
- Some of the characters in the list are inactive/undeveloped and not used in stories at all. So, if you want to use a certain species that is already in the guild you can ask around to see if that species is "free to grab". But there's no rule against the guild having more than one character of the same Pokémon species, so don't stress over it.

##I want to include a character from another anon in my story. Is that okay?

It’s more than okay. People here love it when their characters make cameos in other people's stories, and we haven't had any problems regarding that yet!
Just avoid adding them into questionable stuff like edgy or sexual situations (unless it's Cyndaquil).

If you are worried about writing someone else's character wrong, you can ask the author for pointers like "How would X act in this situation?"
Usually, you can find several of them hanging out in the Aggie drawboard.

We also have [personality blurbs](https://rentry.org/vpmdcloverpb) to help with that.

##This all sounds cringe AF. I don't want to take part in this!!!

That's fine. We are still a PMD general, so feel free to discuss the games or share art ~~~or grieve over no new PMD game again~~.

***

##Is there even anything left to discuss about the games?

Yes! Several romhacks are finished, though most of them are short story hacks. One anon wrote [reviews for several of them](https://rentry.org/pmdglph) (also linked in the thread OPs).
We also have an anon in the thread (Wooperdev) who is working on a Sky Quality of Life romhack nicknamed Project Orion.

Also, feel free to share your PMD playthoughs in the thread.
