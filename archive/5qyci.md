Section 8 Orgy



Rent kept rising and pretty soon, Tray, the raccoon, couldn’t keep up. Even with his bank-telling job there was no way he could stay in the downtown apartments he had become so used to. He did manage to find a place in the suburbs, but while it was affordable, it was full of strange characters. People would hang around outside, doing seemingly nothing but drinking and chatting about who-knows-what. A lot of them were on welfare.

This didn’t set Tray back. He kept going to his job and started carrying pepper spray in his work bag when he set out. Sometimes the apartment’s shady cast would wave to him or beckon him over to where they stood around by the tall grass, but Tray knew they were probably just trying to peddle drugs. He wouldn’t be able to find money for the shitty weed they were selling anyway.

A group of people started becoming familiar with Tray. They would wave and eventually ask about his work. Among the shady apartment-dwellers, they came across as less-threatening somehow. One of them was an alley cat man, who always wore giant T-shirts with 2000’s looking graffiti on them. The next was a crow who seemed perpetually stoned and wore beanies and the signature woven sweatshirt. 

Lastly was the dragon. It was shocking to Tray that a dragon even lived here. Most dragons he knew were fairly financially successful, lawyers and businessmen. At least that was the stereotype. This one looked almost-too comfortable in the ghetto. He was a tall, green-scaled dragon man who went shirtless, showing off a decent, but not oversized set of muscles and (tray knew he was staring) a single copper necklace. 

He had nice definition everywhere, which brought Tray to what little he was actually wearing. The dragon was in a really baggy pair of basketball shorts, which were worn low enough to reveal two (wait, two?) pairs of boxers. One of them had pot-leaf on them, the other was plaid. The whole outfit drew way too much attention to himself, and if he weren’t a dragon, probably would be too embarrassed to wear it. But dragons didn’t exactly do shame.

Tray would stand on the balcony of his apartment and watch the dragon, Ivern, shoot hoops in the halfcourt. Between shots the dragon would put his hand on the front of his shorts to adjust. Tray could tell he was hiding a huge surprise there. 

One day he went down and passed by the basketball court. Ivern threw him the basketball. Tray dribbled and went for a layup, nailing it. Even being gay, Tray hadn’t forgotten his basketball skills from high school. Ivern seemed impressed.

“Damn. I had no idea you could play, man. You're good!” The dragon coughed. His eyes looked tired. Tray smiled back.

“Yeah, you want a 1v1?” Tray offered, taking off his shirt.

The dragon grinned and pulled up his layered outfit. He approached Tray, who could smell his distinct dragon musk. “Winner gets a favor, though. Aight?” The dragon admired Tray’s body, then the two made eye contact and the dragon winked at Tray. Tray lit up inside, suddenly wanting to earn that favor. 

—

The basketball swished through the hoop, landing with a broken thud. The thing had seen some abuse. Unfortunately, Ivern had gained a slight edge over tray, who tried to outmaneuver him. Somehow Ivern had kept his pants up enough to stay aggressive. Both were covered in sweat and breathing heavily. 

“Tray. Bro, we should have played earlier. Didn’t peg you as a player, tho.” 

Tray was out of breath and just nodded along, he was watching the dragon’s green tail swish back and forth. 

“Hey…I got some gatorade at my place. Let's chill there. Plus, I’m not sure what I want for my favor yet, but I kinda have an idea.”

“Yeah, sure. Probably wasn’t going to beat a dragon anyway.”

In the living room of Ivern’s apartment was a low, used leather couch. Tapestries were hung up around to dim the light and it smelled like…you guessed it.

“Take off your shoes please. We ain’t living like savages.” Ivern pulled off his flip flops but kept his sweaty, white socks on.

 Tray recognized the two guests currently making out on it, the cat and the crow. Both were half-dressed and touching each other. Neither looked up as the dragon strutted along to the kitchen. 

“Looks like they started without me. Not fair.” Ivern commented.

 He grabbed some blue gatorade for the two of them. 

“You’re staring at my cock, dude. I mean…you must be horny as fuck, right?” 

Tray spit out his drink and became a stuttering mess. Who the fuck was this straightforward? Even though they didn’t have jobs, the dragon had the confidence of a CEO. The dragon shook his head and kept his smug look. 

“Hey. I was n-n-not staring, just. Admiring? Shoot. Sorry, you probably think I’m fucking weird now.” Tray stammered.

The dragon walked right up to Tray so that their chests were nearly touching. Ivern was about a half a foot taller than him. “See for yourself.”

Tray licked his lips and then reached under Ivern’s waistbands. He did not have to dig far though, as the nearly fully erect cock was ready to spring out. The dragon guided Tray’s hand in, then he felt its size and girth, it felt amazing. Ivern leaned right into his neck, licking sweat from their game earlier off Tray’s fur. “Pretty, impressive, right?” He asked.

Tray couldn’t even answer before Ivern had picked him up and set him on the kitchen counter. They were madly licking, kissing, sloppy, sweaty kisses. They were deep breathing on each other, and the dragon was pressing his covered, erect member, right up against Tray’s groin. They exchanged gatorade-tasting kisses and were feeling each other’s bare upper-bodies. Both kept going at this for a while, both still registering and gauging the other’s willingness, but both finding the other more and more eager. 

“I’m so fucking…” Ivern gasped for air. “Horny, man.” He breathed again. “Let’s move this to my room or at least the couch.”

The dragon took off his clothes, fully undressed and threw himself on the messy bed. Tray followed suit, but decided to sit on the dragon’s lap, playfully gyrating his runt against the dragon’s cock. The dragon laughed. “You want to get straight to it, don’t you, slut?” 

He laughed and nodded. “I’ve always wanted to take it from a dragon, but the ones I know were always taken.” 

“Don’t worry, dude. I’ll show you what it’s like.” 

Ivern held Tray on his lap, letting his ribbed cock rest under the raccoon’s ass. Ivern licked his ears and began petting the Raccoon’s own member. It was already full erect and leaking precum. Ivern quickly rubbed the length of his shaft and then playfully and obsessively, teased the head, first with two fingers, then the palm of his hand. 

The dragon slowly jerked off Tray, using a handful of hemp-based lotion on the bed stand. The raccoon thrust into the dragon’s lubricated hand. Right before he was about to cum, Ivern removed his hand. Tray held his orgasm while Ivern reached for something else: a fleshlight. “Hey…I want to get off with you. Sorry for making you wait.” Ivern said while he lubricated his own engorged cock. 

While he was playing with the dragon’s balls and getting ready to lick the dragon’s shaft, Ivern’s two friends walked in. 

“Hey. We got bored, Ivern and wanted to—wait. WHY DIDN’T YOU WAIT FOR US? You know we wanted to ride his cock too, bro.” The stoned-out-of-his-head cat shouted. The crow nodded in agreement and both approached the bed.

Tray couldn’t help but laugh as the situation became more absurd. He had had a thing for the dragon for a while, but didn’t mind the other two joining in. After an awkward silence, the two joined them on the bed, all four were erect and excited. The four of them compared sizes by forming a circle while sitting on their knees. Then they began touching each other and frotting. Tray lightly touched the cat’s junk and the dragon was jerking off Tray and the crow. 

“Hey bros. Want to see if we can all fucking fit in my fleshlight?” Ivern asked with a huge grin.

“There’s no way, unless it stretches.” Tray responded. But all four knew they had to try. They helped each other lube up and they had to move around. The other two had to position themselves awkwardly sitting on Tray and Ivern who had layed down cock to cock. Still, there was too many logistic issues and though they managed to frott four ways, they couldn’t fit it in the fleshlight from the different angles. They did relish in each other’s pleasure though and kept leaking precum on each other. 

Instead of fitting four cocks in the fleshlight, Ivern and Tray continued to lay down with their legs scissoring and balls and cocks touching. The cat and the crow sat on the two’s respective faces and Tray got to rim the crow while he and the cat jerked each other off. They were rock hard and it didn’t take long for them to spurt cum all over the four of them. Then the two returned the favor by sucking off the close-to-cumming dragon and raccoon. Everyone’s cum was on everyone else’s bodies and they were all spent. 

Epilogue:

The three of them invited Tray into their now four-way relationship and helped the raccoon loosen up. He started smoking weed with them and quit his job, funneling his income and savings into helping out his new partners. He soon found out none of them had their own rooms in the apartment, but that each room with a bed was open to anyone. Everyone’s closet was also open to everyone else and Tray found himself wearing their shared clothes and even sharing sex toys, paraphernilia, and a lot more. 

He formed a deep connection with each of them, in different ways as well. Ivern he found, had the biggest heart for him and they opened up about their hard lives. The dragon lived the way he did because he grew up with insane expectations. With the cat, who’s name was Pete, Tray had the most adventurous sex with. The cat had a huge collection of fetishes, including sounding, exhibtionism, pup-play, underwear (he hoarded all of the underwear in his own closet), musk, and was a hungry bottom on top of all of that. He even let Ivern and Tray double penetrate him. 

And Rodric, the crow, was quieter but was always making art, music, and entertaining the other three. He also liked the physical affection that Tray provided and often joined him in his bed at night, even if Tray wouldn’t see the crow throughout the day. Rodric also cooked most of the meals and would make tea for the others when they were sick. And he loved when the four of them fucked as a group. 

Tray had never found a more compatible group of addicts before. Eventually, they were more addicted to each other than with the drugs. Somehow, the raccoon provided some mental and emotional stability to the others. Soon, the other three would fight over who got to sleep with Tray and if one felt particularly jealous they would join anyway. Among the cat and crow, the two would fight over who got to wear the outfit the raccoon wore the previous day. Tray even caught the cat huffing his underwear and would leave pleasant surprises in them. Reality became an intoxicating dance between the four section eight residents.
