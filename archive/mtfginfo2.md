I see so much misinformation here and elsewhere online regarding what dysphoria is or isn't, or whether or not it is necessary for transition. Here is a link to the APA website which contains the DSM-5 criteria.

In adolescents and adults gender dysphoria diagnosis involves a difference between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, and significant distress or problems functioning. It lasts at least six months and is shown by at least two of the following:

**-A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
-A strong desire to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics
-A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender
-A strong desire to be of the other gender
-A strong desire to be treated as the other gender
-A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender**

So you're AMAB and "want to be" a girl and treated like one? Does it perhaps cause you depression? That is textbook gender dysphoria. You don't have to hate your genitals. You don't have to want to kill yourself.

Can you transition without gender dysphoria? Why would you? If you are AMAB and want neither to be a girl or be treated as such why on earth would you transition?
