A petite girl pulls her cap down over her purple-haired bangs as another group of commuters boards the train car at the station. She's doing her best to make herself invisible and blend in with the mass of people.

Standing in front of her, a pair of high school girls rub shoulders and share a set of earbuds while they stare down at a smartphone. From her vantage point the diminutive lady can just make out on the screen the brightly coloured avatar of a pink shrine maiden playing a video game. She unlocks her own mobile and mindlessly swipes through apps on the home screen, pretending to be busy while listening in on the conversation.

"Mikochi is hilarious!"
"Yeah, but have you seen the clip of Peko-chan with the TNT cannon in Minecraft?"
"Which one?"

The train slows down to a stop once again. The top of a pint-sized figure can be seen weaving through the crowd and slipping out through the open doors onto the platform. The girls' noses crinkle at an odd scent lingering in the car.

"Gross, did you fart?" one of them accuses the other as the door shuts and the train continues to its next destination.

Feeling safer now at the street level, Minato Aqua reseats the brim of her hat and looks up to the bright sunny sky. It's a beautiful summer day, but this 2nd generation Hololive member has no desire to stick around in the outdoors. She's had a long morning of recording sessions at the studio and wants nothing more than to head straight back to her downtown Tokyo apartment to be alone again.

She tugs at the bottom of her panties to unstick them from her sweaty butt before continuing her walk. The idol has one last stopover today at the conbini near her home to gather some supplies.

The store clerk looks up from the counter but doesn't notice the small woman behind the stack of energy drinks until she steps out from behind them to pay. He watches bemusedly and wonders if she'll make it wherever she's headed as she wobbles away from his view on unstable legs.

When she reaches the elevator of her apartment building, Aqua sets the package on the flooring to catch her breath and presses the button for her floor. The electric fan in the elevator doesn't do much to cool her off, but it causes the fabric of her open blouse to flutter, exposing her ample cleavage to the steamy air. Aqua watches the digital display increment impatiently.

A bell dings and the elevator stops just a few floors shy of her own. The doors open and a man briefly makes eye contact with Aqua. She blinks and steps to the side of her goods to make room. The man enters, presses the button for his destination and walks to the opposite corner. Aqua resumes trying to make herself invisible as she waits for this introvert hell to be over with.

In short order the bell dings again; this time it's Aqua's turn. She awkwardly spins around to face her pile of belongings and bends over to grasp them at the bottom, with her back to the open platform. Her heavy breasts dangle between her arms as she reaches around the base.

The small woman lifts and her elbows lock out, but the package doesn't rise. Aqua could swear the thing was glued to the ground somehow. Her mind starts racing frantically.

_Why can't I lift this? Is this guy staring at my chest? Why couldn't I just be alone? Can he smell my sweat? Maybe the elevator is actually a gravity chamber. How long is the door going to stay open? What if it closes again? What do I do then?_

With redetermined effort, Aqua once again tries to hoist the groceries, putting her weight into her thighs and lower back. She grits her teeth and musters everything she's got.

Aqua grunts and then her eyes widen. Her pink butthole gapes wide and blasts out a noxious fart that echoes in the metallic room. The subsequent silence is enough to hear the bead of sweat drip from the tip of her nose.

Panicking now in her embarrassment, Aqua's adrenaline spikes and she gains retard strength.

The package rockets upward and an overcompensating Aqua pendulums backwards out the doorway. She skids rearwards a few times, almost tilting over before regaining her balance. When she unclenches her eyes, her glance once again meets with the man in the elevator. She thinks she caught a glint of tears in his eyes before the doors slide shut.

Without looking back, Aqua runs straight to her room, unlocks it and slips inside, closing the entry and leaning her back against the wall to catch her breath again.

_Did that really just happen? Who was that guy? Will I ever see him again? He must live in the building, right? Maybe I could become a full hikki and never show my face outside to avoid bumping into him again. I could have all my food delivered and ask Cover if I can do my recordings from home. This could work—_

_Nyaa~_

A sand-brown cat enters the room from the adjacent hallway.

"Oh Komugi, come here!"

Seeing her beloved neko drops Aqua's heartrate and anxiety level significantly. She holds out her hand and Komugi rubs the top of his head against it. Living on her own in the big city for the first time, having a feline companion helps Aqua not feel so alone.

Aqua kicks off her shoes, her sweaty feet form-fitting to her white stockings. Kogumi bends his head down and gives Aqua's toes a sniff. He shudders, jingling the bell on his collar, and wisely moves on.

Aqua puts away all the energy drinks save one in her refrigerator, then carries it and the bags of snacks into her bedroom, where she has her computer desk set up.

Empty carryout containers, instant noodle cups, water bottles, and energy drinks cover every flat surface except for the neon pink gamer chair in front of the desk. Its seat is worn and white, and accomodates Aqua's fat ass like a glove.

The marine maid stacks some empty cups to make space for her beverage and bag of chips, then boots up her gaming PC. She uses the remote control to turn up her air conditioning unit and unbuttons her blouse, stripping down to her bra.

Aqua won't be streaming today. In fact, she doesn't plan to stream at all this week. Once she learned she'd have to wear the communal pair of Hololive panties, she resolved to take the whole time off. Today's recording session at the studio was an unfortunate last-minute concession for a sponsorship deal, but now she was free until next Saturday.

In an effort to forget about the stinky, itchy underwear on her ass, Aqua plans to focus on solo ranking up to Master in Apex Legends. Aqua unclasps her bra and tosses it over her shoulder, landing on a pile of dirty clothes near her bed. She peels her stockings off, balls them up, and throws them likewise. Now as naked as she was allowed to be, Aqua could fully feel at home. She cracks open her energy drink can and settles in.

-> * <-

The sun sets outside the apartment window and Aqua's tired face is illuminated by the glow of her monitor. Three new empty energy drink cans are now lined up on the desk, and Aqua sips from a fourth. She stares unblinkingly at the screen and her mouth slacks open. She nervously bounces her left heel up and down as she feels a growing pressure in her bladder.

She slurps. The air conditioner has done its job splendidly; the topless Aqua is now shivering cold. Goosebumps spread on her breasts and areolas—fine, light-coloured body hairs stand on end against her pale skin.

Aqua slides one knee over the other to cross her legs and clench tightly. She's mid-match in a ranked game with only 2 squads remaining. If she can just secure this one last win she can take a break and use the toilet.

The ballooning feeling in her gut is almost painful now. It's getting hard for her to make fine movements with her mouse cursor. She's going to need to rely on her squadmates to have any chance of making it out alive. She squeezes her pelvic muscles rapidly and her breathing shallows.

The safe area on the map begins shrinking down to a small circle, corralling in the remaining players. Aqua works her way through a warehouse building, but turns a corner and runs face-first into the enemy team.

An intense firefight breaks out. One of Aqua's teammates is downed and she rushes over to revive them. Two of the enemies are dead, with one remaining. A smoke grenade obscures the battlefield and Aqua is taking damage. At last Aqua and her rival meet eachother in the fog. They both go for the melee…

An overlay flashes across the screen: "YOU ARE THE CHAMPION"

A wave of relief washes over—and under—Aqua. Her overburderned bladder has burst and Aqua's aqua floods her panties and puddles at the base of her chair. Three cans worth of piss pour out and Aqua is so elated she doesn't even mind.

Komugi steps out of the shadows, sniffs the liquid tentatively, and scurries off again into the darkness.

-> * * * <-

Korone twists both ends of the panties in opposite directions, wringing out the liquid and shaking it. When she lets go, the resilient fabric retains its coiled shape.

She picks up one edge and whips it hard to unfurl the underwear, lightly spattering fluid in all directions. She steps into and pulls on the off-white undies. The cool, damp fabric would almost feel refreshing if it were only water instead.

Korone is getting ready to start her daily morning kickboxing regimen, and once again is incorporating this new addition to her regular gear. Normally Korone doesn't wear anything under her compression shorts when she's working out, but the stipulations of her contract require her to have these panties on against her bare skin for the rest of this week.

She steps out of the locker room and into the gym.

Korone heads over to the stationary bicycles to warm up with some aerobic exercise. She sets the resistance on the dial and steps into the pedal, swinging her leg wide to reach over the saddle and plopping her plump ass down. She adjusts her headphones and scrolls down her phone to her athletic music playlist.

Shifting her weight to her right foot she steps up and lifts her butt from the seat. Her right leg swings to the bottom as her left pops up in tandem and she begins pumping in cadence.

Up and down, the dog girl's rear bobs and her tail waves from side to side to the beat. The friction of the panties rubbing under her shorts heats up her privates and she starts working up a sweat. Instead of the compression shorts wicking the perspiration away from her skin, the cotton drawers absorb and retain it.

When the timer for her warmup goes off, Korone sits down on the saddle like a boulder on a wet sponge. Reflexively, she just as quickly hops off the bicycle. Glancing around, Korone subtly sticks her hand down her shorts to unstick the wedgie, glazing her hand in glistening sweat. In an effort to brush it off, she pinches her hand under her armpit and wipes away. All this really succeeds in doing is making her pit smell like ass and her hand smell like pits.

She glances around one more time before leaving the machine, a small puddle pooled around the base.

Now that she's warmed up, Korone can start her kickboxing routine. She walks over to the area with the free standing punching bags and sets down her phone.

Much like the skits she acts out on her streams, Korone's exercise involves beating the crap out of something.

To limber herself up more, Korone does some quick jabs and uppercuts to the bag, bouncing around with light footwork. Soon she starts doing a set of kicks: knee kicks, jumping, roundhouse. Every impact of her leg with the bag rains a shower of salty sweat to the mat. The perspiration precipitation falls from her shapely thighs and drains from her doggy derrière when she resets back to a neutral stance. Sometimes the motion of a kick wedges the mushy panties into her crack, but Korone learned that a roundhouse kick unsticks them again.

After an hour of exertion, the pupper is too pooped to continue. She packs up her things and heads back to the locker room.

Korone peels off her compression shorts and the undergarments cling to them, exposing her sodden cunt and arse to the open air, a haze of stench emanating from them. Once again she wrings the shorts out, hanging them over the bench to dry while she takes a shower. When she gets out of the shower they're still moist, but it's not as noticable putting them back on after the wet bath.

To finish, Korone dons on a pair of striped thigh highs and a yellow sundress and goes about her day like customary. It wouldn't be until later that night when Korone would have to deal with another change in her habits.

-> * <-

Usually Korone only sleeps in a nightgown or long T-shirt with nothing underneath, but she was now obliged to also keep the undies on while she slept. Unaccustomed to the new twilight restriction, Korone woke up in a sweat multiple times per night.

Casting open her futon covers, she reaches down and uses the cloth to fan the heat from her crotch. Having canine characteristics, Korone's tail region was quite fluffy, and over the years she realized the futility of trying to shave. This meant her asshole was sweltering in a jungle of brown hair, and her pussy perspiring in a patch of pubes.

The panties keep the radiating heat localized and despite fanning off, by morning there is a greasy puddle left on the sheets. By the second day, Korone had reasoned that she should wait until the week is over to change the bedding, because otherwise cleaning would be in vain. As she tosses and turns in her slumber, the sticky pants matte the fur of her tail, infusing the stink deep into it. It would take nearly a month for the stench to fully dissipate.

In her fitful sleep, Korone dreams of Okayu's hot breath on her loins, and she grinds into the oily linens with her snatch, drool collecting on her pillow.

Her phone alarm goes off. She haphazardly reaches out of the futon for it and swipes the dismiss button on the illuminated screen.
