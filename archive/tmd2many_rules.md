### What are we?

*The Mystery Dungeons is a collaborative /qst/ text-based role-playing game based on the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon spinoff series. Organized by two QMs, Players find themselves isekai'd to the world inhabited solely by Pokémon, intending to play on long campaigns.*

· | ->· ->
---- | ----
Most Players are expected to show up to play the part of the intrepid ex-human adventurer, answering the desperate plea to rescue the world from the clutches of world-ending evils. Here, each Player participates as a rolled Player Character of a [Randomized Species](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_pokemon) in the Main Quests and Sidequests, leveling up and proving they have the strength to take on the challenges ahead of them. | ->![Do you yearn for adventure?](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/6yxkc266e7w.png)->
![Or just a moment to have a break?](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/b49zczqqdyw.png) | However, that's not the only option available for participants who just want to hop in and play as a Pokémon. Participants can roll a species to gain the benefits of being a Player Character, or simply choose what they want and act it out as an *NPC*. Villager, Law-mon, Elder, Outlaw... someone who runs the local shop, or inn, or service to adventurers is always a choice Participants can make to play as! They can even hand out Sidequests and do a bit of game-mastering themselves, should they stick around long enough.

### Participating
We are split into both /qst/ and Element. Major story elements are concentrated on the board while everything else is handled off-site to keep things tidy. We have two weekly sessions, normally held on Tuesdays and Saturdays on /qst/. These are the Story Quests, missions that progress the campaign. 

A majority of us are American and thus follow our timezones, but we do have a small handful from around the world and insomniacs. If Participants feel as though they can't make it to these events, that's okay; players can host their own Sidequests (with proper GM-permission) and chat at all hours of the day between themselves in locational rooms in Element.

The one thing we uphold is randomness in using a rolling system for selecting player characters. While it's obviously not perfect, and sometimes an individual might end up with Pokémon they despise, *cheating to reroll isn't banned and no one can prove that you did it, anyway.* Unless you rolled on /qst/. Then we'll obviously see all your attempts. Regardless, it's done this way to keep the members diverse from the normal Riolu-Shinx-Vulpix whatever go-to's are popular. We still get them, despite it. Guess they're popular for a reason, huh?

Here is a [List of All Pokémon](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_pokemon) and the finer details of the [rules](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_pokemon#rules) revolving around rolling them. 

### Rules
The one thing is that we expect some validity and truth to each Player's roll, but to be honest, if they're not using /qst/ already, it's not a big deal. It's not something we can verify nor are we particularly sticklers about upholding this rule. However, there are some others we do care about:
- We are a SFW group. Swearing; adult concepts, vulgarity, and harsh language is fine, but delving past that into sexual acts is **banned**.
- It's also asked that we keep the relative content of adventures and activities reminiscent of a game with a T for Teen rating. General edginess and blood or injuries are tolerated in reasonable amounts, typical shonen stuff. Meanwhile, gore, brutal horror, and murder are *not acceptable*. Death can be utilized (should be used *very* sparingly) for pivotal moments in a plot but is generally left untouched. We're still here to play Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, not a grimdark fantasy.
	- Remember, ask this question in the context of a game: 'Will this action/event/detail change the rating from T to M?' If the answer is yes, do not do it. While things might not be so cut-and-dry, the basic gist is there.
- While a Character may be allowed their memories, it's required that any knowledge of constructing advancements in technology are forbidden. Sorry, Genius Backstory Character, you *can't* start another Industrial Revolution, the consequences would be disastrous! A Character can still remember everything if that's part of the origin, but no constructing things to throw the world forward a tech level or two.
	- Don't go building any engines, advanced machines requiring power, computers, or most mechanical devices past the industrial revolution. Medical knowledge and practices, for example, are fine.
- When listing powers a Character might possess, it's alright to use Pokédex for inspiration, but not to take it as gospel. There are a lot of inconsistencies (heights, lore-powers, weights, etc) that just don't mesh correctly when taken into account. For heights, feel free to ask a GM, or reference the anime since they usually have a basic understanding of scale given that they have to place Pokémon next to humans all the time.
- Ex-Human characters (or those with a human backstory) are to be kept as Player Characters only.

### Gameplay Rule Summary 

First things first, TMD 2e is a D20-based system with limited mechanics in the way of modifying rolls. Most tasks in and out of combat will be accomplished by rolling 1D20, with exception varying from quest to quest.
For the rest of this summary, Sparks the Cartographer will help in providing gameplay examples for what is discussed from hereon.

Say hi to him.


#### Level Summary

As a Player Character levels up, they get access to an expanding variety of species-based Moves, an increasing resilience for taking hits, a larger range of skills, and more.
Sparks' Ability is Lightning Rod, which he got when he evolved. He's had Thunderbolt since level 36, and at level 56, his base HP is 36, he has 14 Stat Points, and all of his attacks have their damage increased by 2.

#### Abilities, Moves, & Stats 

#### Actions



### Leveling & Ranks
*Level requirements may be found [here](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_characters#level-table).*

A Player Character can earn Experience and Rank Points as they participate in questing. This allows them to unlock stronger Moves, better rewards, and cooler Items to buy from shops. XP and RP are normally rewarded at the end of a main session or at the conclusion of a quest. Some missions might only reward one or the other.
- All Player Characters start at Level 5, regardless of their species.

NPCs are separated from the normal level progression and can start further (but may remain stagnant as they cannot earn XP through normal means) depending on how appropriate it is in regards to their origin.
- When creating an NPC, they can be any reasonable level. If they're just coming from humble beginnings and have lived all their life as a villager, they might be in the range of Level 20-40. If they're not a seasoned farmer and instead an aspiring adventurer, maybe they might even be less than Level 20.
	- Avoid making NPCs of the Level 90-100 category.

### Abilities & IQ Skills

*Every Pokémon has access to at least one Ability. Only one of a Pokémon's potential Abilities may be the active one at a time. Players have a limited amount of space they may allocate active IQ Skills to, but Players are not limited to what IQ skills they would like to obtain.*

[List of All Pokémon Abilities & IQ Skills](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_abilities)

Players are allowed to choose which Ability they may start off with, even including the Hidden Ability some Pokémon have. However, in order to change this selection after character creation, they must visit a vendor.

IQ skills are "purchased" with IQ (costs are listed next to the skill), which is obtained a variety of ways during play. The most prominent method is consuming Gummis or Honey, which grant a varying amount of points. Sometimes, they may be rewarded through play.
- There are three tiers that separate IQ skills by their general usefulness. A higher tier is more expensive.
- A Player can roll from a special vendor (number displayed on the left side of the skill) to attempt to obtain an IQ skill for cheaper. Be sure to roll somewhere it can be verified! 
	- Tier 1 Discounted Roll costs 20 IQ.
	- Tier 2 Discounted Roll costs 70 IQ.
	- Tier 3 Discounted Roll costs 140 IQ.

Once an IQ Skills is acquired, there are several things to take note of. 
 - Each character has a Max of 10 IP (Intelligence Points).
 - Each IQ Skill requires a certain number of IP to equip.
 - There is no limit on the number of IQ Skills one can have equipped, only a limit to how much IP is available to use.

### Team Badges
*Rank requirements may be found [here](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_characters#badge-ranks).*

A Character's Rank is shared with their Team, and rewards from the end of missions and rank-ups are to be distributed between all Team members. Joining another Team and being promoted to their Rank does *not* grant extra rewards to the Character (their Bag and Storage are still increased) as it is only given once per promotion. In the case a team might dissolve, the highest rank you have achieved will be maintained.
A team:
- Consists of a minimum of **two** Player Characters, with a maximum of **four** in one.
- Has a designated Team Leader. This might not mean anything during play, it just means they're the boss! Sort of.
- Has members who all contribute to Rank progression. If multiple Team members are on a mission together, each of them individually contributes their Rank Points to the next promotion.

**Rewards for each Rank:**

- *Rookie Rank:* 
	- Allows purchasing from Kecleon Shops.
- *Normal Rank:* 
	- Blast Seed ×4
	- Tiny Reviver Seed ×4
	- Oran Berry ×4
- *Bronze Rank:* 
	- Sitrus Berry ×3
	- Perfect Apple ×3
	- Type-Gem ×4 of choice.
- *Silver Rank:* 
	- Reviver Seed ×3
	- Heal Seed ×3
- *Gold Rank:*
	- Z Crystal ×3 of choice.
	- Unlocks Kecleon Super Selection.
	- Increases Storage Space by +1, for a total of 3 slots.
- *Platinum Rank:* 
	- Razz Berry ×4
	- Sitrus Berry ×4
	- Increases Inventory Space by +1, for a total of 5 slots.
- *Diamond Rank:* 
	- Encourage Seed ×3
	- Vitality Seed ×3
	- Increases Storage Space by +1, for a total of 4 slots.
- *Ace Rank:* 
	- Heart Seed ×3
	- Unlocks Kecleon Ultra Selection.
	- Increases Storage Space by +1, for a total of 5 slots.
- *Master Rank:* 
	- Joy Seed ×4
	- Heart Seed ×3
	- Increases Storage Space by +1, for a total of 6 slots.
- *Grand Master Rank:* 
	- Wonder Gummi ×4
	- Empowerment Seed ×1
	- Increases Inventory Space by +1, for a total of 6 slots.

### Damage Formula
!!! note ( BP + Combat Effect + STAB ± Resist ) - ( Opponent Def or Sp.Def - Atk or Sp.Atk Penalty) + CRIT = Damage Value

- **BP**: Base Power of the Move used. Taken from the normal BP of a Move divided by 10, rounding up. I.E., Drill Peck at BP 80 becomes BP 8.
- **Level Damage Bonus**: This represents the Character's natural strength improving as they gain experience. The damage bonuses can be found [here](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_characters#level-table). 
- **Combat Effect**: The Character's [Stat](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#stats) of the associated attack property combined with any positive values not directly related to Stats. 
	- *If in the fringe case it occurs, they can have a negative Stat subtracted from the formula instead.*
- **STAB**: [Same Type Attack Bonus](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#stab-resistance). If the Type of the attack matches one of the Types of the Character, they gain a STAB boost. 
- **Resist**: [Resistances](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#stab-resistance). This represents the Type match-ups between Attacker and Defender. Sometimes, it might be favorable. Other times, it might not be. 
- **Opponent Def/SpDef**: Reduces the damage of the Move by the Opponent's associated Stat value. Sometimes this may not be provided and the GM will be expected to handle it.
- **Atk/Sp.Atk Penalty**: This occurs whenever a Pokémon has their Offensive Stats lowered. It may also be self-inflicted either through a Move itself or choosing [multiple targets](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#multi-target-moves). 
- **CRIT**: If the Move is a Critical Hit (Rolled 20, 1d20), the attack immediately gains damage equal to the AP cost of the Move used. The move now ignores Defensive Stats/Boosts and Atk/Sp.Atk Penalties.

#### STAB & Resistance

*Using a Move with a Type corresponding to one of the User's will grant a Same Type Attack Bonus, while using one the Opponent is weak to will make it Super-Effective. Inversely, using a Move that the Opponent resists will make it Not Very Effective.* 

AP Cost | STAB | Not Very Effective (¼) | Not Very Effective (½) | Super-Effective (2x) | Super-Effective (4x)
-------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------
4 | +1 | -6 | -4 | +4 | +6
5 | +1 | -6 | -4 | +4 | +6
6 | +2 | -7 | -5 | +5 | +7
7 | +2 | -7 | -5 | +5 | +7
8 | +3 | -8 | -6 | +6 | +8

### About Stats
· | ->· ->
---- | ----
With a limited number of Stat Points, a Player may want to focus on their Character's specialties; specialize rather than generalize. This isn't a bad or less-viable way of building Character, but it would be wise to consider what looking deeper into the six different Stats and their purpose. | ->![Which Is Your Favorite?](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/dbsTLjqbvxykOYgEYJhCvefK)<-
Each Stat is an integral part of the way a Pokemon interacts with the world, and how the world interacts with them. Whichever Stats a Player chooses to invest in, and whatever archetype they embody, good Stat allocation can enable many different play styles. | Stats, their importance, details on how they work, as well as examples of them in use and other niche cases are covered here.

#### HP
The **HP** Stat is a Pokemon life force, and their body's natural progression from frail and fragile to strong and durable. 
 - Each Stat Point increases Max HP by 2.
   - Max HP also increases by 1 every few levels, regardless of Stat allocation.
   - When a Pokemon's Max HP is above 30, damage from some Status Conditions is increased.
 - A high HP Stat pairs well with other Defensive Stats.

#### Attack
The **Attack** Stat represents physical prowess, the strength with which a Pokemon can punch, kick, and throw. 
 - Each Stat Point increases Physical Damage by 1. 
   - Physical Damage given by Attack increases the damage dealt by the User with Physical Attacks by the same number.
 - Physical Moves are often melee attacks. 
 - Most **Multi-Hit** Moves (Icicle Spear) are **Physical**. 
 
#### Defense
The **Defense** Stat is an overall resistance, tolerance, & mitigation which a Pokemon has against Physical damage. 
 - Each Stat Point increases Physical Mitigation by 1. 
   - Physical Mitigation is used to decrease the damage taken by a Pokemon by Physical Attacks by the same number. 
 - *Cover your weaknesses*; Most **Ground**, **Fighting**, and **Dark-Type** Moves are **Physical**.
 - Not many Moves can ignore Defense.
   - Status Moves and Items can easily tear through the guard of a bulky target.

#### Special Attack
The **Special Attack** Stat represents magical prowess, and the strength with which a Pokemon can spew flame & frost. 
 - Each Stat Point increases Special Damage by 1. 
   - Special Damage given by Special Attack increases the damage dealt by the User with Special Attacks by the same number.
 - Special Moves are often ranged attacks.
 - Special Moves are likely to have varied Secondary Effects which sometimes inflict Status Conditions. 
 - Major Status Conditions don't weaken Special Moves like Burn weakens Physical Moves.

#### Special Defense
The **Special Defense** Stat is an resistance, tolerance, & mitigation which a Pokemon has against Special damage. 
 - Each Stat Point increases Special Mitigation by 1. 
   - Special Mitigation is used to decrease the damage taken by a Pokemon by Special Attacks. 
 - The majority of **Multi-Target** and **Room-Hitter** Moves (Dazzling Gleam & Blizzard) are **Special**, making Special Defense a great Stat for less-tanky builds to invest in. 
   - A frail backline Character may have to rely on their bulkier allies to defend them from direct Physical attacks.
 - *Cover your weaknesses*; Most **Electric**, **Ghost**, and **Psychic-Type** Moves are **Special**.
 - Not many Moves can ignore Special Defense.
   - Status Moves and Items can easily tear through the discipline of a bulky target.

#### Speed
The **Speed** Stat signifies the ability to move swiftly and decisively in battle, using quick thinking and reflexes to succeed.
 - Unlike other Stats, Speed only increases Max AP by 1 at 1, 3, 5, and 10 Stat Points invested.
 - Most **Priority** Moves (Quick Attack) are **Physical**, and many Physical Moves are less costly than Special Moves.
 - At Max AP, it's possible to use two weak Moves in one turn.
   - One strong Move will *always* beat two weak ones when facing an Opponent with high Defensive Stats.

### Stat Allocation

Pokemon come in all shapes and sizes. Be them tiny and weak, big and strong, or anywhere in-between, through hard work and dedication in familiarizing themselves with the world, Player Characters can grow stronger than ever and find their niche through Stat Allocation.

 - Pokemon acquire **1** Stat Point every [**4** Levels](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_characters#level-table) starting at Level 5 until reaching **25** Stat Points at Level 100. 
 - Everyone starts out with **1** Stat Point they can allocate to *any* Stat they choose.
   - They also start out with **1** Stat Point *dictated by their species* which they cannot choose, called a [Species Bonus](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_pokemon#rules).
 - Each Stat has a Stat Point cap of **10**, but through [Training](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#training-for-stats), such limits may expand. 
 - N/A

#### Stat Allocation Example
Stat | Points: 6 (+1) | Modifiers | Combat Effect
------ | :----: | :----: | :----: 
Health Points | 0 | Level 25 (26HP) | 26HP
Attack  | 2 | Level Damage Bonus **ɪ** | +3 Physical Damage
Defense | 0 | ɴᴏ ʙᴏɴᴜs | +0 Physical Mitigation
Special Attack | 2 | Level Damage Bonus **ɪ** | +3 Special Damage
Special Defense | 2 | ɴᴏ ʙᴏɴᴜs | +2 Special Mitigation
Speed | 3 | Species Bonus | 6AP

Shown above are the Stats of a Level 25 Raboot. It has a round, even spread of 2 Attack, 2 Special Attack, 2 Special Defense, and 3 Speed, making use of every last Stat Point it has.
 
 - It has no investment in the HP Stat, meaning its Max HP is unchanged from the norm for its Level.
 - The damage of its Physical and Special Attacks is **+3**; **+2** from Stat allocation, and **+1** to both from reaching Level 25.
 - It has no investment in Defense, leaving it vulnerable to Physical Moves like Close Combat.
 - It *does* have investment in Special Defense, meaning it takes **-2** damage from all Special Moves like Dazzling Gleam.
 - With **3** Stat Points in Speed, **2** from Stat Points, **1** from Species Bonus, it has a Max AP of **6**.
 - **6** Stat Points are given from the Raboot's Level, while **1** is given to it by its natural [Species Bonus](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_pokemon#rules), leaving it with **7** Stat Points in-total. 

![Raboot Roll](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/LsGNQPViZiCQBxBYmHFfweMn)

A Pokemon's Species Bonus may vary- every Pokemon is different- however, all Pokemon, no matter what, are given the same amount of Stat Points dependent on their Level.

### Fainting & Getting KO'd

*When a Pokémon's HP reaches 0, they enter a state of exhaustion, unable to battle!*

After a Pokémon faints, they're no longer capable of fighting, and unable to use Items or Moves. However, if one of their Allies were to grant them a Reviver Seed, they could get back on their feet and keep the pressure up!
- When revived via Item usage, the Pokémon in question may act on the same round they were revived with no penalties.
- Reviver Seeds are *not* automatically used when someone faints, even if they have one in their inventory. They must be used by an Ally. With permission, an Ally can use a Reviver Seed from the fainted party's Inventory to revive them.
- If they have not been revived and combat has concluded, they are automatically revived at ⅓ Max HP.

### Changing Stats in Combat

Some Moves can increase Stats for the duration of a battle. These are called Stat Changes; they stack and cannot be increased above 6 in a single Stat. In these cases, they behave similarly to Stat Points, with the exception of *Speed*. *Do not* assume they are completely-identical to Stat Points, instead refer to this when needed. This section is heavily under construction as we still seek to find a balanced way to represent Speed increasing Moves.
- Accuracy is added (or subtracted) to the Move's Accuracy value.
- As Crit Ratio increases, the range on a D20 needed to land a Critical Hit is expanded.
- Evasion Range decides what number roll the a Pokémon must achieve in order to land a hit on an Opponent.
- Speed can be modified similarly to other Stat increases and decreases, with AP increasing or decreasing by 1 for every stage, regardless of one's actual Speed Stat. Uniquely, increases will always tick back to 0 by 1 every round after they are applied, while decreases will not.

Stage ↑ or ↓ | Offense/Defense Stats | Accuracy | Crit Ratio Range | Evasion Range
------ | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:
Stage +6 | +6 | +8/20 Accuracy | 2 to 20 | 1 to 13 
Stage +5 | +5 | +5/20 Accuracy | 5 to 20 | 1 to 11 
Stage +4 | +4 | +4/20 Accuracy | 10 to 20 | 1 to 9 
Stage +3 | +3 | +3/20 Accuracy | 14 to 20 | 1 to 7 
Stage +2 | +2 | +2/20 Accuracy | 16 to 20 | 1 to 5 
Stage +1 | +1 | +1/20 Accuracy | 18 to 20 | 1 to 3 
**Stage 0 (Default)** | ɴᴏ ʙᴏɴᴜs |  Roll 1 (Player Critical Miss) | Roll 20 (Player Critical Hit) | Dodges on 1 (Opponent Critical Miss)
Stage -1 | -1 | -1/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +2/20 Accuracy
Stage -2 | -2 | -2/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +4/20 Accuracy
Stage -3 | -3 | -3/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +6/20 Accuracy
Stage -4 | -4 | -4/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +8/20 Accuracy
Stage -5 | -5 | -5/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +10/20 Accuracy
Stage -6 | -6 | -6/20 Accuracy | - | Opponent gains +12/20 Accuracy

#### Decreasing Speed

If a Character's Speed Stat is lowered in combat with Moves like String Shot, they will lose 1 AP, down to a minimum of 4 AP. If a Character is at 4 AP and a Speed-decreasing Move is used on them, they instead become easier to hit by 1 on a D20, making ≥2 accuracy Moves never miss them.
Each +1 to hit on a D20 is equivalent of 1 (5%) Accuracy, meaning a Character with a maximum AP of 4 will be automatically hit by all ≥6 accuracy Moves while at -6 Speed. 

Stage # | Speed (Default 4AP) | Speed (6AP) | Speed (8AP)
------ | ------ | ------ | ------
Stage 0 | Dodges on 1 (Opponent Critical Miss) | 6 AP | 8 AP
Stage -1 | Opponent gains +1/20 Accuracy | 5 AP | 7 AP
Stage -2 | Opponent gains +2/20 Accuracy | Dodges on 1 (Opponent Critical Miss) | 6 AP
Stage -3 | Opponent gains +3/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +1/20 Accuracy | 5 AP
Stage -4 | Opponent gains +4/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +2/20 Accuracy | Dodges on 1 (Opponent Critical Miss)
Stage -5 | Opponent gains +5/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +3/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +1/20 Accuracy
Stage -6 | Opponent gains +6/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +4/20 Accuracy | Opponent gains +2/20 Accuracy

### Action Points

*AP represents the precious few actions a Character is swift enough to make in a fast-paced combat situation. A good way of thinking is that the timescale is only a handful of seconds at best. Make every moment count.*

Each Character starts the game with 4 Base AP, which determines how many actions they can take in a given turn. AP can be increased through  investing Stat Points into the Speed Stat at a 2:1 ratio, with exception, (See [Stats](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#stats)) or increasing Speed via Moves or various Items and Abilities throughout the course of a battle. The Maximum AP of a Speed Stat-invested Character is 8.

**Attacking Move AP Cost**

*If a Move has an unusual PP value, I.E. 25, 35; round up.*

- **40PP**: 4 AP
- **30PP**: 5 AP
- **20PP**: 6 AP
- **10PP**: 7 AP
- **5PP**: 8 AP

The AP cost of any given Attacking Move is based on its mainline PP cost. Stat-increasing or decreasing Moves have their cost determined by their overall effectiveness. (See [Status Moves](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#status-moves)) Status Condition Moves may have a flat cost associated with them. Some Moves may cost more than others at similar power due to their Additional Effects. 

Moves that have a higher AP cost than the Character's AP Pool can be Trained to be used even when they lack the AP to use them. (See [Training](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#training)) In these cases, the Move's AP value is ignored and instead costs their total AP Pool, meaning they can ONLY afford to use that Move on a given turn, taking no other actions.

#### Single-Turn Actions

*If a Character has enough AP to act multiple times in a single turn, they can. However, there are limitations to performing multiple actions.*

- The total AP costs of the actions performed *cannot exceed* the Character's Maximum AP.
- All Actions must have the same *Focus*.
- Only *1* Status Move can be used in a single turn.

##### Choosing Focus

*A Character attempting to take multiple actions in a single turn must choose a Focus. There are two to choose from: Opponent & Allies. These may also be considered Offensive or Defensive actions.*

- **Opponent Focus ᴏʀ Offensive Actions**: The Character must direct *all* actions on *Hostile Targets*, whether a single enemy or several.
- **Allies Focus ᴏʀ Defensive Actions**: The Character must direct *all* actions on *Themselves or other Friendly Targets*. 

Environmental actions are also considered Allies, unless the Environmental Action directly affects an Opponent. 

##### About Turns & Rounds
*In combat, a turn will be a Pokemon's chance to act. *

A round is split into two turns: (Ally) Turn and (Opponent) Turn. When it is either side's turn, all Characters on the aforementioned side will be prompted to do whatever they choose to, but only within their turn. Whichever side goes first may vary, but each side always gets 1 turn. After both sides have had their turn, the round ends, and the next one starts. The cycle repeats until combat ends.

### Moves

*A Pokémon's methods of interacting with the world may differ from those of others, but one thing is always consistent; Moves.*

[List of All Moves](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_moves)

Moves are separated into two categories: 
- Attacking Moves, which directly deal some form of damage to an Opponent. Sometimes, they might also have a Secondary Effect which can apply a Major or Minor Status Effect to the User or Opponent.
- Status Moves, which are not meant to directly deal damage to an Opponent. These usually interact with Stats both positively and negatively, states of the battlefield, or other niche uses.

To hit an opponent, the Player must roll a d20 to determine if the attack lands. Unless otherwise stated, most Moves work like this:
- A Critical Fail (Rolled 1, d20) results in a miss. 
- 2-19 results in a normal hit.
- A Critical Success (Rolled 20, d20) results in a Critical Hit. 

The Miss and Crit ranges can change depending on the Move used. The Move's Accuracy is determined by the number not included in the range, which cannot exceed 20. Moves that are originally 100% Accuracy can miss on 1, and are represented as ≥2. Otherwise, Moves that might have a ≥7 Accuracy have a miss range of 1-6.

#### Damage Over Time (DoT)

*Sometimes, a Character will be afflicted with damage that isn't immediately noticeable, but if they just ignore it as the time passes by, they'll certainly start to feel it.*

DoT Type | Max HP 1-30 | Max HP 31+
-------- | -------------- | ------
Burn |  2 |  4
Poison |  2 |  4
Badly Poisoned |  4 |  6

#### Recoil & Screens

*Certain Moves hurt the User almost as much as their Opponent, while others negate some of the damage of Moves before they land.*

Damage Dealt/Received | Damage Recoiled/Reduced
-------- | ------
1-10 | 3
11-20 | 6
21-30 | 9
31-40 | 12
≥41 | 15

#### Multi-Hit Moves 

*Not all Moves are as strong as others, but sometimes, quantity may beat quality.*

These are Moves capable of hitting a single target multiple times at once. Multi-Hit Moves only apply the User's damage modifiers once, and each hit has its damage decreased by the Opponent's Defensive Stats.

Multi-Hit Roll |  Multi-Hit Roll (Tamper Scarf) | Multi-Hit Amount (15BP) 4AP | Multi-Hit Amount (25BP) 5AP
 --- | --- | --- | ---
Rolled 2  | *N/A* | Move lands 1 hit (1BP) | Move lands 1 hit (2BP)
Rolled 3-7 | Rolled 2-5 | Move lands 2 hits (2BP) | Move lands 2 hits (5BP)
Rolled 8-16 | Rolled 6-12 | Move lands 3 hits (4BP) | Move lands 3 hits (7BP)
Rolled 17-18 | Rolled 13-16 | Move lands 4 hits (6BP) | Move lands 4 hits (9BP)
Rolled 19-20 | Rolled 17-20 | Move lands 5 hits (8BP) | Move lands 5 hits (12BP)

#### Multi-Target Moves

*Not to be confused with Multi-Hit Moves.*

Moves that can target more than one Opponent at a time and hit several different Opponents at once, such as Blizzard, are called Multi-Target Moves. However, for each additional Opponent targeted after the first (Opponents targeted by move >1), a damage penalty of -3 is incurred, subtracted from the final damage number.
- When the User uses a Multi-Target Move, they can choose how many Opponents they would like to hit with the attack, up to 3 possible targets.
	- The only moves that are exempt from the damage penalty are Explosion, Self Destruct, and Misty Explosion. Instead, for each additional Opponent targeted, an Ally must also be selected to receive damage in return.

Moves that always target all available Opponents, such as Earthquake, are called Room-Hitters. The penalty is applied differently compared to Multi-Target Moves.
- When the User uses a Room-Hitter Move, they will always target the maximum amount of Opponents present in a battle. This means they can bypass Multi-Target Moves' limit of 3, however, the User does not have any control over what and how many Opponents get hit.
	- In the case of Moves that damage Allies, they do not count toward increasing the damage penalty. Allies will still get hit, of course.

#### Priority Moves

*Some Moves are more graceful than others, and are not only easier to use, but also often unexpected.*

Moves that have AP Costs lower than what they would normally be, such as Quick Attack, are called Priority Moves. When they are used on an Opponent who has not been damaged by an attack before, they deal increased damage as the Opponent is caught by surprise. 

![Eevee used Quick Attack!](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/CnPIGYaIaCuasYlJnrczplsY)
- When the User uses a Priority Move, they will deal increased damage 1:1 with the decreased AP Cost of the Move when targeting Opponents who *haven't been harmed yet*, I.E. Quick Attack will deal +1 damage, and Extreme Speed will deal +2 damage. This is signified by the (-x) next to the base AP cost of the Move, such as Quick Attack's 5(-1) AP.
	- This effect **only** activates when the Opponent *has not* been damaged by an Attacking Move or Status Condition. If they have been damaged by Weather Conditions, Traps, or otherwise, the effect *still* applies.
	- When Priority Moves **lose their Priority**, be it due to Psychic Terrain or Queenly Majesty, their AP reduction is **removed**, and with it, the surprise attack mechanic.


#### Healing Moves

*In a world as hectic as this one, a little peace and tranquility is needed where there is usually only pain.*

Original % | HP Healed
-------- | ------
25% | 2
50% | 4
75% | 6

#### Status Moves

*Moves that deal no damage are called Status Moves, and the effects may very greatly between each one.*

[List of All Status Moves](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_moves#status-moves)

As stated earlier, A Character may only use one Status Move during their turn, even if they may have more than enough AP to use several. Choosing to use a Status Move prevents the User from being able to utilize other Status Moves in conjunction, but does not prevent the use of Items or attacking Moves, should they have the AP for them. These also are still affected by the choice of [Focus](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rulest#choosing-focus):
- Status Moves that are intended to lower an Opponent's stats or apply a bad condition, which normally target Opponents, Adjacent Opponents, or Adjacent Pokémon, are considered **Offensive Actions.**
	- Status Moves that directly affect an Opponent through the environment, such as Trick Room or deploying Spikes, are also considered **Offensive Actions.** 
- Status Moves that apply a beneficial condition to the User or their Allies, which normally target Self, Adjacent Allies, or All Allies, are considered **Defensive Actions.**
	- Status Moves that affect the environment but are not normally intended to target an Opponent, such as Rain Dance or Grassy Terrain are also considered **Defensive Actions.**

##### Status Effects

*Some Moves cause Status Conditions. There are Major Status Conditions and Minor Status Conditions. Only one Major Status Condition can be active at a time on a single Pokémon, while Minor Status Conditions are near-limitless.*

- **Major Status Conditions**

	- **Paralysis**: The miss range of the Afflicted's Moves is increased (1-6) and their [Max AP](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#action-points) is decreased by 2. The accuracy penalty ignores unusual any accuracy effects of Moves, I.E. Swift. Lasts 4 turns.
	- **Confusion**: The miss range of the Afflicted's Moves is increased (1-6). However, instead of missing, they will instead target the closest ally. A critical fail will cause the Afflicted to damage themselves. Lasts 4 turns.

A Wish can be interacted with at any time, and can be used as a bonus action at no cost, healing whoever uses it for 4 HP. There is no limit to the number of Wishes that can be made. Can be stolen by Snatch.
    - **Pain Split**: For 4 rounds, the Afflicted stores the damage they take. At the start of the 4th round, the User may use Pain Split to inflict the stored damage on an Opponent. Effect ends early when the Afflicted faints or they don't use Pain Split, losing the stored damage.
	- **Commanding**: The User cannot attack, but in-turn, using a Move before Allies causes subsequent Ally Attacking Moves of the same Property to deal +1 damage, increasing every successive use until +6. If the User's Move was a Status Move, subsequent Ally Status Moves cause a +1 to either Defense of Special Defense, whichever is lesser. If both Defense and Special Defense are equal, both are increased. All increases are doubled for Dondozo. If an Ally does not use the correct Property, their increases are nullified. 

##### Awakening & Berserk

*Characters can temporarily increase their power beyond their normal limits for a session or combat scenario by using a specific item.*

Consuming an Empowerment Seed will grant the User the Special Status Condition, **Awakening**. While under the effects of **Awakening**, the User's Stats are greatly increased, and if they have access to a *Mega Evolved Form*, will automatically change into that form. If the Pokémon has multiple *Mega Evolved Forms*, they can choose which one they would like to use.
- If the Pokémon has a *Dynamax* form, they can also cosmetically use that appearance during the duration of **Awakening**. No, you do not become giant. Or get the weird cloud thing.
- Outside of combat, the user may roll twice for a given action and take the higher of the two.

The highest stat determines what kind of bonus is given. All bonuses can exceed the normal limits. 
- *Any investment into HP is not counted and will instead default to the next highest stat.*
Category | Primary Bonus | Secondary Bonus
----- | ----- | -----
Offensive (Attack and Special Attack) | +10 to both | All Defensive Stats are bypassed and Moves cannot miss.
Defensive (Defense and Special Defense) | +10 to both | Becomes immune to unfavorable Status Moves and Secondary Effects of Moves. Gains +20HP.
Speed | +4AP | In addition to their normal attacks, one move can be used for free (no AP cost). All moves that roll <10 in accuracy will miss.

**Berserk State**
*(Only in Battle)* This is another effect that occurs when consuming an Empowerment Seed and happens after 2nd Player Turn in combat. Those under the effects of **Awakening** must beat an increasing **Berserk** check.
- Every Player Turn, the Critical Fail chance (Rolled 1, d20) increases by +2 and reaches its maximum at +12. Accuracy rolls that fail this check will instead randomly attack an Ally.
- This can be mitigated by taking a [Break](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules/#non-move-actions), which resets the **Berserk** check back to 1.

- **Psychic terrain**: For five turns, doubles STAB for Psychic-Type Moves. Priority becomes negated.

##### Battlefield Hazards

*Sometimes, the environment may prove more dangerous than it seems. These cases are Field Hazards and Traps. Some may be intentionally set by a Move, Item, or Ability, while others appear randomly in a dungeon, and may catch a Pokémon off-guard at any moment.*

**Hazards**
Hazards are placed in battle by Pokémon  and only affect those with an Offensive Focus. Rolls within the effect ranges afflict the User (or whoever has the Hazard on their side of the field) with the effect. They can be applied up to three times.
Hazard | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3

Sticky Web | 1-6: Speed decreased by 1. | 1-7; Speed decreased by 1. | 1-8; Speed decreased by 1.

**Traps**
Traps are triggered during battle whenever they are introduced prior to combat: *"There are Traps on this floor, beware!"* The first lowest roll below a specific threshold (default of ≤5, can be dictated by the GM) activates the trap and uses it up.
Trap | Description
-------- | ------
Blast Trap | When stepped on, causes an explosion that randomly affects two combatants.
Mega-Blast Trap | When stepped on, causes an explosion that randomly affects five combatants.
Apple Trap | Whoever steps on this gets pelted by a pile of apples! The Activator takes 6 true damage and receives a Big Apple.
Grimy Trap | Whoever steps on this gets a face-full of Nasty Food!
Hunger Trap | When stepped on, causes immense hunger! The Activator is afflicted with *Hungry*.
Sandblast Trap | Whoever steps on this gets a face-full of sand! The Activator's Accuracy is decreased by 1.
Poison Trap | Whoever steps on this gets nauseous! The Activator is afflicted with *Poison*.
Shutter Trap | Whoever steps on this feels like they're forgetting something! The Activator is afflicted with *Disabled*.
Lethargy Trap | Whoever steps on this suddenly feels heavier! The Activator's Speed is decreased by 1.
Spiked Trap | Ouch! Sharp spikes just popped out! The Activator takes 6 true damage.

Cleanse Tile | Whoever steps on this feels a sense of relief! The Activator's Status Conditions are removed.

### Non-Move Actions

*AP can also be used for Non-Move actions, such as defending another Character, using Items, or other environmental actions.*

**Guard**: Reactively take an incoming hit for a teammate. This uses a turn.
**Brace**: Increase Defense or Sp.Def by +4 for the turn.
**Environment**: A Character can interact with something in the environment around them.
**Break**: Take no actions for a turn to reset both positive *and* negative Stat changes to their neutral state. It returns to neutral in increments of ±1.
**Dodge**: A Character can elect to use their AP to Dodge. 1 AP spent Dodging decreases the Hit Chance of an incoming attack by 1, at a ratio of 1:1. (Needs to be tested at different values.)
**Item**: Use an Item. Items have varying AP costs.
**Hazard Clear:** The player can roll to attempt to remove any Hazards in battle or to uncover any hidden Traps.

#### Items

*During battle, a Character may retrieve a useful Item from their Bag to change the tide of battle.*

Items go into a Character's Inventory/Bag or Storage. Each Item takes up 1 slot of space unless otherwise specified. Some Items are Consumable, while others can be Worn/Held by a Character and thus, do not take up space outside of the Worn/Held Item slot. 
- A Player Character starts off with 4 Inventory slots and 2 Storage slots. This can be increased through Team Rank.
- Picking up a dropped Item or equipping an Item during battle costs however much AP the Item would require to use.
	- Giving an Item to an Ally grants the Item's effect to them as a free action (with no AP cost) if they do not consume it immediately on the turn it was given. 
- Moves or Items which target a Character's Items target their Equipped Item first, then Worn Item, then Inventory Items, unless otherwise specified.
- When an Ally is revived through the use of an Item, they may act on the same turn they were revived.

[List of All Items & Effects](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_items)

**Item AP Cost**

- **Berries & Medicine**: 2 AP
- **Wands & Seeds**: 3 AP
- **Orbs & Others**: 4 AP
- **Worn Items**: 4 AP

##### Worn & Equipped Items 

Items, I.E. Expert Belt and Pecha Scarf, can be worn on or around a Pokémon's body and do not take up an Inventory slot. 

Basic Attack Items, example being an Energized Wand, are held in a Pokémon's hand as an Equipped Item, and provide interesting options when wielded. 
 - These do not take up an Inventory slot. 
 - They allow unique actions based on the Item in question.

Sometimes, however, Consumable Items can act as an Equipped Item.
 - When a Consumable Item such as a Fire Gem is held in a Pokémon's hand as an Equipped Item, it will be used immediately when they use a Fire-Type Move. 
 - If the Consumable Item is instead a Pecha Berry, it will be eaten the moment the User is afflicted with *Poison.*
   - Consumable Items held in a Pokémon's hand are **unable to be manually-used,** and are solely and automatically activated upon their respective usage prompt, I.E. Move usage, Status Conditions, damage taken. 

Only **one** Item can be held in one's hand, even if the Item can be grouped, like Berry Leaves.

Does a Player wish to improve their Character in ways beyond just fighting, honing their craft in other endeavors so they aren't just meatheads duking it out all the time? Now, everyone can teach their Character to be an egghead. Or... they could have them Train to be an even *bigger* meathead.

Every week, on the same day a session will occur (every Tuesday and Saturday), each and every Player is given the chance to Train their Character. Here, they can dedicate their Training time to whatever field they want to be work towards improving. 

The Player may choose to Train and switch between any Attribute, Battle Attribute, Move, or Stat without losing any progress. It is recommended that each Training Session is logged in everyone's respective Character sheet. Example provided below.

### Training for Attributes

Attributes are almost anything a Character can reasonably learn, Train, or practice for. These are generally mundane life skills, and provide the Character a greater level of mastery over others in a particular field. They are added after the end of a D20 roll to boost its value. While the Player may select any skill they can think of, it should be a specific word to describe what niche they want the skill to be able to benefit.

For example, while "Tending" might be too broad, something more applicable would be: Parenting, Gardening, or Repairing instead.

Some skills might require less time to hone (-1 Training Session) due to their inherent simplicity. Since the available Attributes are 'basically *anything* the Player can think of,' it is advisable to *ask first* before working toward an Attribute for a specific concept.

Requirement: 3 Training Sessions ▯▯▯
ᴏʀ
Requirement: 4 Training Sessions ▯▯▯▯

### Training for Battle Attributes

Similar to Attributes, Battle Attributes can be Trained for. Where they diverge, however, is in the way they function past the need for Training. While Attributes are relatively mundane, Battle Attributes are skills that can be used to improve one's technique with the Moves they know, and are able to be utilized in combat scenarios. More complex and time-consuming to master when compared to their less tactical sibling, these take longer to Train than a normal Attribute.

As a Pokémon gets stronger and more familiar with their capabilities, they may try to push their previously-established boundaries and forge a set of tricks unique to them. Each new step in a Pokémon's experience with such tactics is not entirely clear, but everyone will come to know the difference between a novice arsonist and an expert pyromancer.

Example | Current Tier | Progress Bar | Description
------ | :----: | :----: | :----:
Battle Attribute: Precision Telekinesis | Tier **ɪ** | 3/3 ▮▮▮ | The User feels comfortable with this Move.
Battle Attribute: Precision Telekinesis | Tier **ɪɪ** | 4/4 ▮▮▮▮ | The User is experienced with this Move.
Battle Attribute: Precision Telekinesis | Tier **ɪɪɪ** | 5/5 ▮▮▮▮▮ | The User is skilled with this Move.
Battle Attribute: Precision Telekinesis | ᴍᴀx | 6/6 ▮▮▮▮▮▮ | This Move is an extension of the User's will.

These upgrades in the ways one may impart themselves onto the world through their capabilities may not be immediately impactful, but will show their usefulness over time.

### Training for Stats
The final tier of Training necessitates the most effort out of all of the categories, requiring a considerable amount of investment from the Character in order to improve the Stat they are trying to improve. These are permanent and are not beholden to the limit of 10 from allocating Stat Points gained through Leveling up. Once Tier **ɪɪɪ** has been achieved, the maximum Stat Points in one Stat can be +13.
- A Character may Train **Attack, Special Attack, Defense, Special Defense,** and **Speed.**
	- Players cannot train **Health Points.** You can find items that increase it or to simply level up.
	- Unlike the other stats, **Speed** only receives its Bonus when it reaches Tier **ɪɪɪ**, at which point, adds +1AP to your AP total.
- A Character may only focus on **one** Stat to improve at a time. They cannot begin improving Speed and decide to switch to Attack instead.

### Training for Moves
A Character can *still use a Move if they do not have the proper amount of AP to utilize it*, but doing so incurs a *penalty* on the User of the Move. However, it is also possible to Train to use a specific Move of the Player's choice *without* investing in Speed to remove this penalty and use the Move normally. (See [Action Points](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_rules#action-points))

#### Missing AP Penalty

*Although a Pokémon may still use a Move with an AP cost higher than their Max AP, some Moves with higher AP Costs will suffer an Accuracy penalty when used by someone who isn't well-equipped to handle them.*

AP Cost | Untrained | Training Tier **ɪ** | Training Tier **ɪɪ** | Training Tier **ɪɪɪ** 
--- | - | - | - | - 
4 AP | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty
5 AP | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty
6 AP | -2/20 Accuracy | No Penalty | No Penalty | No Penalty
7 AP | -4/20 Accuracy | -2/20 Accuracy | No Penalty | No Penalty
8 AP | -6/20 Accuracy | -4/20 Accuracy | -2/20 Accuracy | No Penalty

If a Move is Trained to be used in spite it's AP, the AP cost may be changed to: '{AP cost} (*ᴛʀᴀɪɴᴇᴅ*)'. Trained Moves can be used at their original value, but if the Character lacks the necessary AP, they can still use it at the expense of all they have.

### Learning or Relearning Moves

A Player Character has four options to choose from when building their moveset, unique to their rolled Pokémon. Each one has different methods to acquire a move. You can have up to four Moves at a time, accompanied by a [Typeless Move](https://rentry.co/tmd2many_moves#attack-arts) for a total of five.
- **Standard Movepool**: These are the moves that a Pokémon can learn whenever meeting a specific level requirement. Each one will be different and can differ in the evolutionary line. 
- **Technical Machines**: Moves that Pokémon can learn from programmed discs. Each species has a differing list of what TMs can be compatible.
- **Egg Moves**: While not immediately applicable to the Player Character if they have a human origin, this is a list of moves a Pokémon can have when they hatch from an egg, which changes based on the parent. In order to access these moves, a player can obtain a part or piece (such as a scale or a feather) of the parent donor and then take that to the appropriate shop to gain their move.
- **Move Tutor**: The final list of moves which can only be learned from another, who might be willing to teach you for a price or favor.

As they level up, Players might also replace moves with better, stronger ones now available to them. However, they might still want access to those old Moves. These can be regained at a shop that specializes in Moves.
- A session at a specialty shop can be expected to cost 650₽, in which case, the Player can freely select Moves in their forgotten Moves list to relearn. 
	- **Forgotten Trained Moves**: These can be relearned for free at any time.
	- **Moves Never Learned**: These are Moves a Character has never picked up to begin with but might have had the chance to learn (this does not include Moves that have not had their Level requirements met yet). This can include Moves that are in their species' evolutionary line that might have not been accessible if them rolled a later stage Pokémon. Learning these will cost an additional 250₽ for each move.

This is a special form of participation that does not utilize a Player Character to participate. Instead, Players are inserted into predetermined roles in major leadership positions. They are still given the freedom to create their own character and backstories, but they must fit the narrative of their country. Players are expected to act out their parts while making their decisions, which can affect how the world is experienced in the campaign.
- Forego protecting popular routes in exchange for extra pay? Expect to encounter more bandits or pirates while traversing the world. Want to crack down on crime? Expect mercenaries or soldiers roaming the streets of cities. Your choices as leadership can change quite a few things.

The "meetings" can happen at any time the Player chooses to participate as their leadership character. Updates to the world and confirmation of their decisions only occur twice each week (on the days of the sessions, Tuesday and Saturday). 

### Resources
Your decisions may not be entirely influenced by what your character might want to do. Instead, scarcity of resources or the current sociopolitical climate might demand they act differently: either because they have no choice or because it would better appease the people. There are three major resources to control:
- **Funding** is naturally acquired from areas that the country controls and accumulates over time into the country’s treasury. 
	- Funding can be increased by expansion (however rapid expansion may decrease Stability), which can mean more resources to harvest. Facilitating trade with other countries will also increase funding.
	- Emergency Funding can be increased by temporarily taxing citizens, however, this may decrease Stability.
- **Stability** represents the political and social climate of the country, revealing how the population feels about their current environment and living status. 
	- 0 represents total anarchy, while 100 represents idyllic peacetime. 50 is your baseline number.
	- Stability can be increased or decreased through the use of Assets and events that may occur.
- **Assets** can be purchased through Funding or acquired through Stability. They can be used to respond to certain events to increase their success rates or start other ventures. Assets may represent a mundane thing such as construction materials, or even up to hired artisans or workers to utilize those construction materials.
	- Assets may be lost or destroyed in events, or even acquired if things happen successfully.

### Expansion & Map
``=placeholder=``

### Events
Players can expect each update to include an event for the leadership to make a decision over. This may be something as simple as deciding what kind of resources to purchase or planning a celebration, to something as dire and time-pressing as a famine or drought.
- Leaders might request the ruling council to follow with their ideas or suggestions on how to act. Listening can result in a Stability bonus.

### Countries
There are five in total across the campaign world, however, only four are accessible for Players to act as leadership for.
