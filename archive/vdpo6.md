>living in a sleepy border town meant there was nothing to do
>word around town was a lucha show came up up south
>wasn't the biggest news every but here it might as well be the president coming to town
>it was a break from typical weekend shenanigans 
>which was usually nothing
>so you and a few friends went to the show
>you'd heard about way back when wrestling started they did audience exhibitions
>you'd get in the ring with the wrestler and try to win
>in this day and age no one risks being sued
>Mexico however, very different 
>they had a heel by the name Mariposa taking all comers
>he was famous in his territory for his gimmick
>the gimmick was Mariposa was a 4 foot tall lynx dressing in the most homoerotic display possible
>he was up in the ring as you walked up
>flood lights kept the matches going this late into the night, and gave the contestants a spotlight
>trash talking the town after a few successful pins
>a pink feather boa around his neck threatened to swallow his face
>his spandex was a singlet that rode his ass like a thong
>didn't hide the bulge in front all that much either
>butterfly cutouts all along the bright neon pink uniform
>drab brown fur was drowned out in pink but there was so much not left to the imagination
>his body was definitely short but not chubby, just enough muscle to do what he could
>he was built for flexibility over power
>high heeled wrestling boots gave him just a little more height but not much
>a shimmering silver and pink mask in the shape of a butterfly hid his face
>it verged on clownish 
>his attitude likewise
>very much the bratty diva
>very very much openly gay without a trace of shame
>played into the spectacle of the whole thing
>you could tell he was very comfortable playing a crowd
>you were surprised to see him as a villain
>a local farmer clambered up to the ring and you'd swear he was fighting lightning for how fast the luchador moved
>a dropkick sent the farmer flying back and then a lariat caught him unawares when he got up
>the pink blur overwhelmed the guy in minutes
>and then pinfall
>after seeing Mariposa in action and with a stomach of carnival food you felt confident 
>patiently you waited your turn for an attempt
>all the while you watched and made mental notes of how he fought
>if all else failed you had your secret weapon

>every few minutes he chewed through another guy
>it always started slow
>then he'd push them 
>sort of a way to get them to get their guard down and then swoop in
>why could no one else see it?
>he at least varied up his moves
>the size difference meant he always always attacked low
>a lot of kicking people's feet out from under them
>he usually went for whatever could keep people off balance
>had to work fast to compensate for lack of reach
>the other guys were sloppy and that didn't help matters
>a lot of overextending themselves
>in high school you were part of the wrestling team
>true, very different animal to the lynx's lucha libre 
>however it did give you a better grasp of the other man's moves
>how he made use of his energy
>this was part survival match
>as soon as his stamina would start flagging he might step down
>granted a heel would probably cheat too
>you figured there wouldn't be weapons used on random folks though
>he was certainly vicious in how hard he pressed the advantage
>thankfully you had a few factors in your favor 
>he loved the double jumping drop kick to get people off their feet
>those little boots had to hurt
>he put enough speed into it to kick like a mule
>bouncing around the ring was a terrible way to economize his energy
>however the footwork was designed to burn out others
>he was racing to seeing he'd burn out before his opponent 
>considering he was a trained athlete he would have the advantage there 
>occasionally his opponent had to be carried out
>this didn't dissuade you
>in fact it made you want to show him who's boss
>your turn was soon
>his tiny frame ricocheted off the ring ropes and he got another pin
>his breathing was ragged and soon he'd call an end to the exhibition 
>you had one guy ahead of you and you hoped it was quick

>the guy in front of you was pinned in no time
>he was totally sloppy
>there was a weakness you noticed Mariposa had
>he didn't do holds of his own
>it made sense though for his size
>however if someone managed to get a hold of him
>he might not have a counter to it
>thankfully you were able to wrestle next
>you saw his reaction when you entered a low stance
>he wasn't striking you so easily
>heel or no heel
>instead of letting him dictate the match you pressed him
>you were aggressive 
>he was still fierce 
>his speed still a terrifying thing even with fatigue set in
>he was experienced and tried not to get close
>but all you needed was one shot
>a side kick was the perfect opportunity 
>your arms instinctively seized it
>his leg was trapped in your grip and he wasn't getting it back
>you'd taken his speed
>you felt pretty confident until a spin kick caught your shoulder
>that sacrificed his footing though

>there was grin on your face when you saw him floundering on the mat
>just like you thought 
>once you took away his footwork and speed he was at a disadvantage 
>he was struggling to counter from his position 
>he was constantly try to wriggle out of your grip
>his boots occasionally made contact with your arms and chest
>he was trying to knock the wind out of you
>he was like a panicked fish
>you hoped this would burn him out faster
>one small issue
>he broke the hold by grabbing a ring rope
>referee got you apart and you realized all that panicking across that may have been him getting to the ropes
>clever girl
>he was smart enough to keep back this time
>but he'd need to reach you somehow
>you took a few blows but rolled with it
>what you hoped had happened 
>he started to get desperate to finish it quickly 
>tried bouncing off the ropes and using the momentum for a big strike
>his telegraphing it earlier meant you were ready to sidestep it at the last second
>your arms wrapped around him like a python
>you were face to face and he was trying to knee you in the bread basket
>he had one free arm and he was trying to strike you with it
>the bear hug held tight
>though he was chipping away at the hold enough you'd have to act quickly for a win
>all the while he cursed up a storm in Spanish 
>you could tell he wasn't used to this
>now was the time to unleash your secret weapon
>the crowd, the referee and even Mariposa himself were stunned into silence 
>you'd planted a kiss on him
>taking advantage of the distraction you fell forward and moved to pin
>his arms were pinned at the shoulder to the mat
>you pressed him down hard onto the mat
>the referee broke out of his stupor and did his job
>and with that Mariposa lost

>you earned the 100 dollars in prize money 
>the promotion owner tried to insist he meant 100 pesos
>you weren't dumb 
>Mariposa was still shocked when you hauled him up by his paw
>the heel act seemed to maybe just be an act
>he wasn't reacting like other luchadors you'd seen
>maybe you legit humbled him?
>you didn't keep up with this specific promotion so you didn't know his record 
>it takes a lot for a trained wrestler to break character
>OK so using the gay thing right back at him wasn't exactly fair and square
>you wanted to get the match finished before he got free again
>there was a chance you wouldn't have gotten him into a third hold
>plus it's not like any of the other guys would have done it
>that outside the box thing won the match for you
>the quiet from Mariposa was strange
>you waved to the crowd that had recovered 
>perhaps they just thought you were being spontaneous 
>truth be told you were going to kiss the twinkled regardless 
>the crowd didn't need to know it was completely premeditated 
>all part of the big song and dance after all
>you had driven separate from your friends that evening
>it wasn't a bad neighborhood so you figured you could walk to your truck just fine
>you were caught off guard by tiny boots on your back

>you stumbled forward into a car
>"you… you maricon!"
>you recognized that voice
>quickly you spun around
>sure enough there was the pink kitty
>you scoffed at him
>really
>maricon 
>from him
>he stood there 
>pouty
>paws on his hips
>"that wasn't fair!"
>he pointed a finger towards you
>you pointed out neither was attacking someone from behind in a parking lot
>then added maybe he was used to rear attacks but you weren't 
>that got him running at you
>he tackled you into your truck
>that knocked the wind out of you briefly
>in his anger he forgot something
>he put himself in arm's reach
>another bear hug
>issue was he'd had a break so holding onto him now was harder
>like trying to hold a snake 
>you weren't letting him have a tantrum all over your face though
>this is about when you decided to troll him
>another kiss 
>he almost chomped at you before pulled back
>"hijo de puta!"
>"down! put me down!"
>fat chance
>he got a couple lucky hits in but taking ground away from him meant he had little power
>he hissed in your face out of frustration 
>his cat eyes narrowed 
>yeah you weren't putting him down
>not until he learned to behave himself
>you'd won the match
>he should accept that
>"you're not supposed to kiss me, goddammit!"
>you asked why not
>after all he was cute and it worked didn't it
>he stooped for a millisecond at cute
>then went back to wiggling and cursing

>this went on for close to a minute before he seemed to tire out a little
>you were worried this was a faint
>however you hoped he had tuckered himself out
>he still glared at you through his mask
>setting him down maybe a bad idea
>you mulled it over and decided what the hell
>you set him down with all the care of dismantling a time bomb
>you had just enough time to breath in before the brat was trying to maul you again
>this time you dodged and grabbed him into another bear hug from behind
>he cursed at himself 
>he fell for the same trick twice in a row
>you weren't setting him down this time 
>you pointed out he had one loss and this is how he acts
>"it's not… about the goddamn loss"
>he struggled but you had his arms squeezed to his sides this time
>his strength was flagging
>"who the hell just kisses a guy like that?!?"
>the femboy lynx in the pink spandex was angry about a kiss from a man
>how could you not kiss him?
>you hadn't considered the issue though
>maybe he was just playing an act?
>you asked him
>"yes! I've been with more pussy than you've dreamed of!"
>doubt
>especially with how shaky he was
>maybe the flamboyant act was a way for him to enjoy the gay thing without guilt
>maybe
>you were no armchair psychologist though
>the ears on his head laid flat against his mask now
>he was still grumpy
>after a while he stopped wiggling
>maybe he thought you were dumb enough to set him back down again
>he huffed 
>yeah you weren't that dumb
>he was cute like this though
>you were close enough to smell nothing but him
>vanilla oil almost covered his natural scent and gave his coat a shine
>all the recent activity had ended up mixing the two together
>it was a pleasant mixture 
>he eventually ended up slack in your arms like an oversized plush toy
>you asked if he was OK
>"yeah," he admitted wearily
>that was good to hear
>you set him down softly and to your surprise he didn't choose violence again
>out of curiosity, before you released your grip, you rested your head on top of his
>he didn't react in any fashion you noticed
>just sort of stood there 
>eventually you felt a paw on your arm
>he didn't pull you off
>instead it just rested there
>he was soft
>to your surprise you felt a soft vibration 
>he was purring

>"it's not fair," he murmured
>you wondered what he meant
>didn't break the hold on him though
>at this point it was more an actual hug
>he leaned back against you eventually 
>this was a world of difference 
>you had no idea what was going on but his warmth was nice in the chilly parking lot
>it was hard not to just cuddle him but you were scared to spoke him
>after about five minutes he pushed your arms up and you let him free
>"look, just forget this happened."
>before you could say anything he dashed off into the night
>how he got his energy back to do that you didn't know
>his fluffy tail above those pert cheeks would be a memory to last
>you walked back to your truck and let the ache from earlier ebb from you
>no doubt you had bruises
>but nothing broken
>it was rough getting home 
>you did it though
>the rest of the night was boring as hell and you passed out
>waking up, you felt like a freight train had hit you
>getting dressed hurt like hell
>however you needed breakfast badly
>as fun as carnival food is its not very satisfying living off it
>you decided to grab breakfast at a tex mex down the road
>you did a double take when you walked in
>and the effeminate lynx boy at a booth table practically shoved his menu in front of his face
>you didn't get a good look but you had a feeling you knew who it was
>even squeaked

>you told the waitress you were having breakfast with a friend
>so you walked up to the quivering menu and sat down across from it
>you asked for coffee and said how rough you had it last night
>your companion across from you flinched
>the lynx looked like his fondest wish was to disappear at that exact moment
>at least from the reaction the back of the menu was giving
>why he didn't bolt you didn't know
>it was fortunate he didn't 
>his behavior confirmed what you already knew though
>this was Mariposa
>after the waitress brought you coffee you decided to strike up conversation with your new friend
>first that you were surprised
>those lucha guys always seemed to wear their masks everywhere
>"I-I wouldn't know"
>that was his voice, minus the obscenities he hurled around last night
>sure sure
>playing oblivious would work if he wasn't trembling now
>you grinned
>you had an idea
>you remarked maybe you had him pegged for someone else
>you asked if you had seen that Mariposa lose last night
>the menu came down just enough for two amber cat eyes to wish you a death by cock and ball torture
>at least that's what you assumed the deathglare meant
>this was your man
>and his eyes shot open when he realized he'd given himself away that easy
>now you were surprised he didn't bolt already
>in fact he set the menu down and seemed to concede
>"fine"
>the glare became a worried look
>"just don't tell anyone"
>you promised
>the waitress came back and you both ordered like nothing unusual happened
>he ordered two of the biggest rare steaks on the menu for breakfast and that was it
>tiny thing like him that impressed you
>your conversation was almost whispers while you waited for the meal
>he wasn't forthcoming with details but you expected as much
>at least he wasn't kicking you now
>you apologized if you insulted him which did seem to put him at ease
>"I'm sorry for how I reacted in the lot"
>you asked if that's the worst thing he would do with you in a parking lot
>he shielded himself with the menu again

>you could swear he would have melted under the table if he got any more flustered
>he kept trying to hide
>however you got the idea to gently pull the menu down yourself 
>shyness turned into a pout
>"why are you here?"
>you explained they had cheap tacos
>plus you lived within walking distance
>so why wouldn't you
>you asked if he was staying in town
>you even offered him the chance to crash on your couch
>the pout lost to flustered resurfacing 
>this boy was very very complex
>"that won't be necessary."
>you said it would be a shame not to take in such a cute kitty
>that earned you a whack to your shin
>the folks in the booth behind you looked at you after that yelp
>you played it off
>sure you might come off as a creeper at the moment but you figured this was your best chance
>he was hot and you figured you'd shoot your shot
>he was still shy about it all but you gathered bits and pieces
>he certainly wasn't the bad boy he was in the ring
>at least you guessed
>here he dressed rather conservative too
>very masculine, a sharp contrast to last night
>his build was a dead giveaway it was Mariposa though
>breakfast itself was pretty good
>for such a little guy he wolfed down his meat in no time
>he relaxed a little when you were busy eating
>probably felt like he could let his guard down
>he was still a little skittish though
>when he tried paying you told the waitress you'd cover it
>she handed you both the bill and you were quicker on the draw
>played keepaway for a few seconds while the lynx tried reaching across the table
>after all this morning was your treat
>he was pouting again after giving up
>even had his arms folded to his cute chest
>refused eye contact completely 
>he left after paying but not before you snuck a paper with your phone number in his back pocket
>now it was his move

>a couple days passed
>you figured your shot missed
>however, much to your relief, a number you didn't recognize sent you a text
>at like 2 AM
>good thing you were a night owl
>"you up?"
>you replied
>"this is easier through text"
>weird but OK
>you asked to make sure it was Mariposa
>"yes. I'm insane for even sending this"
>this was curious and you wondered where this was going
>"I want to meet."
>oh hello
>you didn't think you'd won him over
>though it could just as easily be to drop kick you again 
>it was worth the risk
>you agreed on a time and place
>he was hesitant at first
>a quirk you noticed was the second you started typing he stopped
>he waited for your responses 
>you were surprised he even texted yourself
>no doubt you'd find out what this was all about soon enough
>the time was Saturday night
>the place was over the outskirts of town, this really out of the way motel
>you were either going to get lucky or lose your kidney
>you asked for proof he was genuine
>he posted a picture of his mask
>well at least it was him
>the weekend couldn't come fast enough
>over text he did seem much easier to talk to though
>perhaps it was dealing with things face to face that spooked him
>a professional wrestler spooked by interaction
>strange guy
>he wasn't giving you nudes or anything like that
>just yet, you hoped
>but it was far more controlled on his end
>it was hard to mix together the foul mouth luchador, the scaredy cat at the restaurant and this guy on the phone together
>he wasn't egotistical enough to give you a ton of info about himself
>but you gleamed a bit here and there
>with the Mariposa thing he was a hell of a lot more confident 
>maybe the mask was liberating
>more importantly, you hoped he wore vanilla oil on his coat again
>that was very memorable 
>the day arrived and you practically raced over to the hotel

>you still didn't know what to expect at the motel
>still treated it with all the enthusiasm of a kid at Christmas
>he was hot
>you could possibly dick him
>what was there to hate?
>you saw how perky his ass was
>whole thing had you at half mast the entire drive
>took about a half hour
>you cleared work tomorrow just in case you got lucky 
>hopefully no one stabbed you tonight
>that was the least of your worries at the moment though
>what if he was just playing and you wouldn't score
>that would be the tragedy
>so your journey to the motel was brief
>felt like you could have plowed through a stop light at the rate you were going
>patience was its own reward though
>you pulled up to the parking lot and texted your new friend
>a simple reply
>"106"
>you practically dashed to room 106
>at the door you composed yourself and took a few deep breaths 
>didn't want to seem too desperate 
>you knocked and the door slowly creaked open
>there was Mariposa 
>same blinding tight pink everything
>his eyes darted around and he yanked you into the room
>then used your body to slam the door shut by jumping up into a powerful kiss
>looked like you'd get to keep your kidney 
>hooray

>he manhandled you pretty well for such a little guy
>paws grabbed at your clothes as he shoved his tongue into your mouth
>you kissed and grabbed right back
>he was already hard when you came to the door
>you could feel that and you were pretty sure the spandex would show that
>he made you go from half mast to hard in second
>you could feel him purring deep in his chest
>the lynx was fucking adorable
>you made the right call tonight
>he broke the kiss first and pressed himself to your chest
>"fucking maricon," he breathed out
>his voice was ragged
>all the while he burned up in your hands
>"fuck I'm not supposed to need this."
>you felt his hot breath on the layer of sweat on your skin
>"fucking kissing me."
>he muttered against your shirt
>"fucking kissing me twice."
>he struck your chest feebly
>then looked away from you
>his ears slicked back as if he was embarrassed 
>he wasn't angry like before
>maybe 
>"just because i have a lot of fun playing one"
>he kissed the sweat off your shoulder and neck
>"it doesn't mean I'm supposed to be one"
>good lord he was in denial
>you gripped his ass cheek with a firm smack
>"maricon!" 
>he just about leaped away from you if your other hand wasn't on his waist
>"I said I'm not fucking gay, fuck!"
>it was your turn to practically shove your tongue down his throat 
>you took his denials as a challenge now
>he was gay 
>very goddamn gay
>even if your cock had to take permanent residence next to his prostate to prove it
>you weren't letting someone this damned cute and secretly eager off easy
>he knew he wanted it
>he just hated that he did
>it would be adorable if it wasn't hold him back from riding your dick
>the kiss weakened his knees
>his paws tugged you close
>he was so bipolar
>you'd set him right soon enough
>the purring didn't stop
>you even felt his nub of a tail twitch next to your hand on his ass
>the urge to just mating press him on the hotel bed right this instant was strong
>all you could smell was vanilla and hyper aroused kitty 
>this adorable little shortstack of drab and pink purring in your grip was amazing
>he just had to give in and admit it was amazing too

>his body knew what it liked 
>he was tight springy muscle in a short little package
>you could feel as much with his ass
>he yelped when squeezed his cheek 
>his blush was adorable
>however, he muttered a string of curses immediately after
>still trying to hold out
>his erection said otherwise
>your fingers were so close to his hole and he knew it
>his breath was ragged against your chest
>he was fidgeting in your grip
>you weren't going to force him but you were going to make him a mess
>you were comforting him through the whole thing
>he yelped again when you picked him up like a toy
>he ended up gently tossed onto the mattress
>he whimpered when your hands ran along his stomach
>his body seized up when you pulled his singlet aside and let his cock spring free
>he tried stuttering out a denial or a curse before you started stroking him
>his head peaked out of your fist
>that sight seemed to make him groan out
>"I'm not gay"
>he whined as you pumped his cock
>his cock throbbed in your grip as his body tensed and relaxed
>he was enjoying this but couldn't admit it
>your other hand found his chest and you teased his nipple
>"fuck!"
>his hips bucked and he clawed the sheets under him
>you weren't going to push him he liked men just yet
>but he seemed pretty gay from where you stood
>pinned to the bed and making whorish noises
>really hard to deny he was gay like this
>he was mumbling all his little curses
>didn't take the initiative now
>he just let you be assertive
>he was adorable like this
>he climaxed without warning all over himself
>the girlish squeal as the load came was adorable
>his chest rose and fell hard as his remaining seed trickled down his hand
>after a few minutes the indignation returned to his face
>"I said I wasn't fucking gay." 
>he pushed away and made for the door
>not one for pillow talk it seemed
>so you did something drastic
>you clamped down on his hips and pulled him back
>he was shocked
>still cursing though
>you landed on your back and he was small enough to lift
>you plopped his perky ass right on your face 
>before he could protest you slid his thong to the side and started eating out his boy pussy
>"Jesus fucking Christ!" 
>he curses turned into drawn out loud moans
>for someone that insisted he wasn't gay he had cleaned himself flawlessly 
>it was almost like he hoped he was going to get what he really wanted

>his noises were adorable
>he quivered above you
>his body like a tense spring and he ground his ass against your face
>he couldn't even finish his insults any more
>he was just babbling
>his thighs gripped your head as his loomed over you
>his paw gripped your hair as he gave himself over to riding your face
>the purring came back
>as much as he denied it himself his body told the truth
>his cock was working back up to hardness
>you could just barely see from under him
>his thighs felt like a vice
>for all his talk he immediately loved this
>your hands held his hips in a deathgrip
>tongue fucking him made him make highest pitched cries to no one in particular 
>he desperately grinded back against your face
>"not fair"
>that was the first complete words he got out
>well of course you were going to fight dirty
>why shouldn't you
>when you redoubled your efforts on rimming his tender boy pussy he lost it
>his half erect cock shot cum onto your face and the pillow
>you didn't let him just submit though
>you were merciless 
>he got no reprieve after the climax and you kept attacking his hole
>after a while he just turned into a drooling mess and wouldn't surrender your head back to you

>what felt like eternity passed
>he recovered and you fully expected him to be angry
>it was a big risk but you figured this had a chance to win him over
>being pressed into thick cat ass didn't seem so bad at least
>two orgasms seemed to pacify him a little at least
>he wasn't so angry 
>or throwing denials out there
>he'd mellowed out
>still had you in a headlock 
>he wasn't letting you go it seemed
>granted, you needed air eventually
>you picked him back up and despite how he clung to you he relented
>you could tell the fight was out of him for the moment
>he was weary
>you'd burnt him out again it seemed
>he was reclining on the bed
>despite all his protest he did clean out his ass in preparation 
>so it would be a shame to waste the opportunity 
>especially since you were still hard
>so you pinned him to the bed
>there was that purring
>his legs up in the air 
>he felt so small under you
>he actually felt vulnerable now
>like a barrier was completely gone
>there was a lot unspoken at the moment
>he definitely wasn't all angsty at the moment
>you didn't know exactly how much to push
>well you knew what you wanted
>however, you weren't all for it unless he was
>so you finally spoke up
>said the gay thing wasn't as bad as he made it out to be
>at least you hoped
>"I-I know"
>you asked what changed
>"that's my own business"
>fair enough

>he wasn't so resistant to you now
>you could tell he was troubled in his eyes
>when you said you two didn't have to do this and started to reel back his eyes flashed with anger
>his paws grabbed your shirt collar and he looked you in the eye
>"don't you fucking dare pussy out now!"
>his resolve swung back again to kick you in the face
>while you could tell he still had some buried doubts he tasted too much to go back
>through the spandex he could feel your swelled erection
>you could tell from how he slightly twitched at feeling your dick against his
>well that was an endorsement I anything
>you unzipped your pants and slid them down enough 
>boxers followed right after
>your cock slapped against his and you fumbled with your wallet
>"what the hell are you doing?"
>you said you were fetching a condom
>the second you fished it out of your wallet he slapped it across the room
>"don't half ass fucking me. you did this so you take goddamn responsibility"
>well, it was risky
>but you were hard right now
>fuck it
>thankfully from the ass eating and your precum he had enough lube
>he wanted dick he was getting dick
>you were relentless 
>no warm up 
>just straight to mating press
>his anger vanish and was replaced by his screaming into your shoulder
>paws clawed at your back, shredding your shirt to ribbons and leaving future scars
>you growled into his neck 
>he took it like a champion
>in fact his legs locked behind your back in an attempt to drive your manhood further in
>balls slapped together 
>it was gay now if it wasn't before

>you just violently stuffed this pussy
>he didn't deny you and if anything encouraged you
>"oh fuck!"
>his cursing and moaning mixed together now
>your shirt was ruined 
>pulling out was impossible now
>not that you wanted to even dream of that
>his ass was such a tight squeeze 
>felt amazing on your cock after all the teasing
>occasionally he'd scream/moan a "maricon" 
>whether that was pointed at you or him by now was a mystery
>the scent of vanilla and the other man's natural scent filled your nose and mouth
>you tasted his most intimate of places and now it's all you could think of
>you couldn't help yourself from breeding him like an animal
>his meaty ass took every inch and you filled him like a goddamn handpuppet
>all the teasing and frustration let loose 
>the bed rocked and smacked against the wall
>you had him pinned and you weren't letting up until he completely submitted 
>his teeth sunk into your shoulder and his toes curled as he splattered cum onto your sandwiched stomachs
>if anything the rough stuff drove you on
>like a horse kicked with spurs
>your cock shaped his asshole as you kept mercilessly hammering
>he kept climaxing, screaming into your ear
>a fourth, a fifth, a sixth
>for someone that wasn't gay he needed to be fucked in the ass
>on the seventh orgasm his body finally milked you enough and you growled as you painted his insides white
>you collapsed on him
>buried like that and pinning him to the bed
>him feebly mumbling "fuck" and "fucking maricon" were about the only things to break up his ragged breaths 
>you made sure to grab a fistful of kitty ass and push yourself deep as possible 
>then you passed out on top of him

>you awoke a hour or so later
>Mariposa was looking at you with a glare
>"really?"
>he nipped at your shoulder
>you were about to pull out but he kept his legs locked
>"you're taking responsibility for all this. I told you I am straight."
>you laughed 
>he tried to interrupt but you just kept laughing
>you were entangled after practically abusing his tight hole
>and he still tried to insist
>he pouted and glanced away
>no one who came that much from what you two did was straight
>you pointed that out
>you were aware of your soft dick just barely in him
>you felt yourself harden inside him and he groaned next to your ear
>an idea occurred to you
>he squealed when you grappled him and flipped so you were on your back and he straddled you
>you'll give him a chance to totally prove he wasn't gay by giving him an out of riding cock
>given how he didn't seem to hop off you made the right call
>he just sat there for a moment, impaled on dick 
>you awaited his next move but we're confident you knew what it would be
>all the while his tongue hung out of his mouth
>he watched you as you watched him
>when your cock twitched inside him he whined

>this time you relaxed
>he looked a little unsure now with things under his control now
>it would be an admission on his part that he likes all this
>you had no idea what made him like that but you'd hope to quell that in him
>you'd like to do a lot of things in him
>he ended up accidentally wiggling on your dick
>that made his cock twitch in reply
>you knew his body craved what his mind denied it
>and frankly you'd hope to keep giving it
>you gently rested your hands on his thighs 
>you weren't forceful at all
>you wanted him to want this so that he could keep wanting it
>his singlet was a mess now
>more and more brown fur was exposed
>he actually looked down at his costume and clicked his tongue
>you insisted you could pay to replace it
>"better" he said with a defeated mutter
>he was slow to start moving but eventually he did
>it was still like a vice on your dick
>he hissed through his teeth as he moved
>his paws rested on your chest for leverage 
>you went in for a kiss before he shoved you back on the bed
>"your breath probably smells like ass. no"
>well at least the sass stayed the same
>he took a while to get used to you again
>he slowly pumped himself at first, refusing to make eye contact all the while
>it wasn't like you to be lazy but it was important he do this
>filling him was as amazing as the first time
>he bit his bottom lip and slowly increased his tempo
>"make no mistake, you did this."
>strange to see someone this stubborn
>a clawed finger aggressively prodded your chest to make the point clear
>what that point was you didn't know
>was he still trying to claim heterosexuality 
>while riding your dick after the last load made a mess of him
>it was honestly funny
>so yes, you'd take total responsibility for this
>by making a mess of his backdoor again and again
>jackhammering sounded good for later
>his tempo was slow
>no doubt his ass was a little sore from earlier
>all the more reason to let him set the pace this time
>you rested your hands behind your back after a while
>he was using you as a dildo now
>the look on his face was adorable
>not that you said as much
>you wanted him to keep going and you didn't want to jinx it
>so you let him take initiative and he did
>after all this was his chance to prove he wasn't gay
>he was doing a poor job of it
>you noticed his ears weren't down like they were forever
>maybe he was less embarrassed 
>despite not wanting to look at you he certainly behaved shamelessly 
>the urge to speak up was hard to reel in
>however you didn't want to spoil it
>you just had to appreciate what you had
>hopefully it led to more
>his legs flexing were kind of hot to watch
>as were watching his abs
>despite his soft looking frame the barest hint of muscle peeked through with every move
>despite being weakened by military climaxes he was working hard, just with the occasional wince
>his body was beautiful and tight and you enjoyed the front row seat
>occasionally he'd moan and twitch, clearly enjoying himself
>but he'd put that back in the bottle the second he could catch himself
>still insisting he wasn't gay it seems
>he tried cursing when you stroked his dick but he couldn't formulate a thought when he shot off seconds after
>he clamped down hard on your cock
>it didn't take long to cum inside him aside yourself with that cocksleeve
>it was his turn to collapse and you pulled him close as he passed out
>the lynx slept comfortably in your arms
>a thought had occurred
>you were tuckered out from your first orgasm
>why didn't he just kick you off of him
>maybe he was more affectionate than he let on
>it took you passing out to make him sweet
>right now you felt his heartbeat 
>his breath was soft
>you laid there, content
>frankly you hoped it wouldn't end
>this guy was fun for all his protests and sass
>couldn't call him boring
>occasionally, his nubby tail twitched in his sleep
>it was peaceful
>God you'd need to get a shower after all this
>but that could happen when Mariposa woke up
>you watched his face and just enjoyed the moment 
>eventually you fell asleep too
>the morning came and you were surprised when you reach out
>nothing
>your eyes shot open and you looked around for Mariposa 
>nowhere to be found
>you snuck around the room and checked the bathroom
>no one, though the shower was still wet
>you went for your phone
>no texts
>so you texted him
>you hope he didn't just ghost you
>you saw he was texting in response 
>the three dots hovered there for a while 
>then finally a response 
>"next Saturday, same time"

>your body ached but you guessed his ached more
>he probably wasn't sitting down any time soon
>it had been forever since you came that hard
>you definitely wanted more
>shower cleared your head and felt goddamn amazing
>that was twice you won a wrestling match with the fabled Mariposa
>after the shower you nabbed a cheap breakfast and texted him
>he took a little while to respond but it was cordial
>none of the harsh edge from last night
>you started to see a pattern to his behavior and the heel act was how he dealt with the physical face to face encounters
>at least that's what you go from playing armchair psychologist 
>whether that was true remains to be seen
>however, through text he was a bit more affectionate 
>it wasn't quite at "I love you" level
>but he wasn't so bratty through text
>you could feel he was warmer
>maybe he was growing to accept things
>if he wanted more that had to be it
>you asked how he was feeling
>"sore. very sore"
>to be expected
>the rest of your day was relatively uneventful 
>you conversation with him was sort of mundane compared to how you both were last night
>you decided to start looking more into the career of Mariposa
>at least gleam as much information as you could
>the promotion was small bit there had to be something
>sure enough you found phone footage here and there
>it seemed like he was fairly recent, the oldest videos on a couple years old
>you started diving down the rabbit hole a little
>Mariposa wasn't forthcoming with his own history but you found a couple similar lynx luchadors that didn't pull the whole flamboyant gimmick
>it wouldn't be unheard of
>wrestling tended to be a family business
> you'd have to ask him gently but you had a feeling why he acted so strange about all this

>he was adorable at least
>there were no encounters in town while you waited for Saturday 
>it was a letdown in all honesty 
>you were hoping on catching him off guard again
>however, it was a decent week either way
>helped you had Saturday to look forward to
>the texts helped
>he was actually warming up to you
>at least it felt like it
>you tried not to push things too hard
>you didn't want to just be a side fuck though
>you wanted emotional contact
>sure that sounded super duper gay
>but you didn't even know Mariposas name
>well his real name
>you figured you'd get it from him this time
>hopefully
>went through the same rough greeting at the door
>this time you decided to shake things up
>he was thrown on your shoulder
>the protests in Spanish were cut short with a smack on his ass
>you noticed he had a new singlet 
>bright yellow this time
>at least that's what the thong indicated 
>his paws feebly smacked your back while he insisted to be put down
>you weren't even holding him tight
>all for show
>you playfully poked him in the rump and delivered an ultimatum 
>you needed a name, a real name
>he stopped with his tantrum and a silence fell over the room

>you could sense the gears were turning in his head
>the room was dead silent but there was a tension in it
>it wasn't hostile but it was most certainly tension 
>you explained his secret was safe with you 
>you liked him 
>you wanted this to be a thing 
>you two to be a thing
>his tail twitched
>well he couldn't hide body language 
>"dammit"
>you could sense the frustration in his voice
>he slumped against you
>it was hard to read him
>must be dealing with a lot mentally 
>you offered to listen if he wanted to vent
>"well I wanted you to fuck me raw again"
>there would be time for that later, you countered
>right now it felt right to a little honest with each other
>you knew he liked this stuff
>he knew he liked this stuff
>there was no harm in it
>"you don't understand"
>you asked if it was family issues and he froze up
>at least that's what it felt like I your grip
>he had to be mulling over things
>you tried to get him on your side by saying you dealt with family about this stuff too
>that did seem to relax him a little
>you went to the bed to continue the conversation and moved him to your lap
>you pointed out if he really didn't want this he could have run at any time
>he rolled his eyes and clicked his tongue
>"I didn't think I was that fucking obvious"
>he was an open book
>he wasn't ready just yet to give you an infodump but he wasn't hostile at least
>instead he sort of curled up in your lap
>"it's complicated" 
>you felt like maybe you called it right
>he played Mariposa up because he was in the closet to his family 
>it was a release valve
>would explain why he got so aggressive 
>you asked if this was right and he slumped forward towards your chest
>he looked defeated 
>"yeah," he weakly replied
>you embraced him 
>you said you would be his confidante if he'd have it
>that made him cuddle up to you a little
>"still calling you maricon,"he mumbled

>he slumped against you and you both sat there 
>the soft glow of the hotel lamps gave his drab fur a sheen 
>your hand roamed his back, the muscles across his shoulders reminded you he was sort of still maybe possibly manly
>just a bit
>basically a sporty tomboy
>but male
>very niche
>a niche that you happened to appreciate 
>"fine," he huffed
>he hugged you tighter
>"it doesn't fucking leave this room"
>you swore it was safe
>"I find out you said something, you're going in a ditch."
>this was serious
>"and I'm not fucking you"
>oh OK very serious 
>you promised it wouldn't leave the room
>"Carlos"
>Carl
>this girly thing goes by the equivalent of Carl
>you started laughing before he punched your arm
>"goddammit"
>you pulled him close to your chest while he went back to muttering
>you swore that name wouldn't leave the room
>you did ask if you two could get to know more about each other like that
>it would be nice, you remarked
>he was quiet but held onto you tightly
>you might be the only one he can be his real self around
>not the crass Mariposa
>or however straightlaced he had to be around family
>he just got to relax in your lap and be himself
>and he was purring again

>well with that settled you relaxed a little 
>even just a name showed maybe you were getting through to him
>he was starting to be comfortable with you
>hopefully also with himself
>he was way too angsty 
>this time you'd kiss the hell out of him
>seemed to hush him up quickly enough when you went for thr first kiss
>he wasn't shocked but took a second to lean into it with you 
>his tongue wrestled yours timidly
>there wasn't a lot of fight in him this time around
>you decided to push your luck
>your hand went for his mask
>he flinched but your hopes were right on the money
>he let you pull the mask back
>there was that same face you saw across the table
>you broke the kiss to get a good look at him
>his ears flicked and folded down onto his head
>he looked very submissive 
>quite a lot of fight out of him
>he squeaked when you fell back on the bed and dragged him back with you
>he didn't fight your grip though, even when you squeezed his ass
>"you know I'm only letting you do this because…"
>you gave his ass a playful smack
>that cut off his doubt
>he pouted and gave you a glare
>well at least he wasn't trying to fight you
>you asked him if this was really so bad
>he glanced away
>he liked it
>you said if he didn't like it he wouldn't have invited you
>he didn't have a defense for that
>"just go back to kissing me dammit" 
>well you couldn't disagree with that idea
>you went back to kissing him 
>you'd melt him down soon enough
>the way his heart hammered in his chest mixed with his purring 
>this time you took the time to strip him of his singlet
>it slipped off easily and he looked actually vulnerable 
>he cuddled back to your side

>struggling out of your own clothes made him whine
>the lynx hated to separate from you 
>he wouldn't admit it but he was growing attached
>he was extremely helpful in getting your shirt off
>sure it ended up partially shredded
>"now we're even on the clothes"
>you'd forgotten about his pink singlet but it seemed he did not 
>whereas last week you practically demolished him, you took your time 
>this time it just felt right to do this >pulled him under the covers and he seemed to actually relax
>you asked if he had off tomorrow 
>"why?"
>you wanted to hang out 
>promised you wouldn't get all… handsy in public
>that seemed to put him at ease
>everyone would just assume you two were friends
>good friends
>"I guess there's no harm."
>he had a slight grin
>"no touching though"
>you swore you wouldn't
>for now
>the you months from now couldn't possibly make such a promise
>but for now, no touching
>that seemed to satisfy him
>it wasn't quite at boyfriend level but it was a first step
>sealed the deal with a kiss and he seemed to instinctively to straddle you under the blankets 
>his fur was smooth against your skin

>while he was timid, that didn't mean he was unreceptive 
>you felt his toes curl when your hand roamed lower on his back
>it was a subtle cue but it was there
>you chuckled and his eyes utterly refused to make contact with yours
>his paws felt soft against your chest, the softest feeling of his claws on your skin catching your attention
>he twitched his tail
>his body was far more honest
>it was endearing
>the drab color fur shined in the light of the room lamp
>occasionally Carlos flicked his eyes to you
>you took the initiative now
>spinning him around brought forth an "eep" 
>he was pinned under you now
>but with enough freedom his paws went to hold you in return

>at least he was getting it
>all his anger seemed like it was gone
>he just relaxed and got to be himself
>you didn't say as much, figuring you didn't have a good way to talk about this
>just focused on the physical 
>some things didn't need to be said
>when you kissed along his neck he groaned and wrapped his legs around your back
>he definitely was gay
>his body just reacted to your touch like that
>no doubt in your mind he was made for this
>he bucked his hips when your cocks touched
>"do me from behind," he whispered in your ear
>he pointed out the small bottle on the nightstand
>you didn't need any more instruction 
>he was still shocked when you grabbed him and flipped him
>gave a few shy glances over his shoulder as you got lubed up
>he even gulped
>you heard a gulp
>that gave you a laugh and you could practically see the pout as his muscles tensed
>he almost jumped when you lubed up his hole
>then grabbed the pillow to smother his noises
>definitely gay
>he took two fingers easily
>you asked if he practiced on himself a lot and that prompted him to stammer into his pillow
>sounds like you weren't going to get too clear an answer 
>you carried on, fingering him smoothly and working a nice pace
>he moaned when you spread your fingers
>after a while you couldn't help yourself though
>he watched your cock bob before you lined up
>his own cock throbbed, pointed back
>you sunk in and he practically ate that poor pillow
>your right hand rested on his lower back, feeling the muscles flexed
>he was a wiry little thing
>meanwhile his juicy ass took all of you greedily

>you decided to compliment him the best way you knew
>remarked he had a girl's ass
>"don't say that shit" 
>kind of hard for him to sound angry when his outburst ended on a high note as you buried back in to the hilt
>like a sort of squeak
>really took all the menace out of him
>you fucked him but not at the ragged pace of last week
>instead just powerfully thrusting forward 
>the bed shook every time you bottomed out
>the poor pillow would not survive his assault
>Carlos had shredded the poor thing
>you surprised him with kisses along his shoulder blades
>his orgasm hit him like a truck, his body freezing up
>all the while his hole milked you for all its worth
>just goaded you on further
>his cum splattered against you legs as you kept thrusting
>his ass really was goddamn inviting 
>so damned bottom heavy for a guy
>your hand went for his head, pulling his head back from the pillow
>now you hungrily kissed him
>your tongue wrestled his easily
>those same teeth that made shreds of the pillow were gentle in a kiss
>you felt him cum again after 10 more minutes of pumping and his body wrung your climax out of you
>just like last week you dumped a load of baby batter in his fat ass
>and just like last week you decided to rest on and inside him
>you asked him if he still had any doubts
>"you wouldn't understand"
>so you asked him to help you understand 
>if it was family they should at least not be hostile to him
>supportive might be too much to ask
>but at least not disowning or abusing him
>it was hard to read his reactions from the back of his head
>eventually his family would figure out there was a glimmer of truth to Mariposa
>hiding actual homosexuality behind extravagant gayness as sort of an subversion
>it was sort of clever but there's no way it would last
>if someone in his family didn't already figure it out
>you pointed this all out to him
>you had physical evidence he liked this dirtying the bed sheets 
>so why shouldn't he feel good, feel like himself
>he hugged the pillow and sat there, deep in thought

>his body relaxed under you
>it was like his muscles went slack
>you could hear him wince when you pulled out
>you apologized if you were too rough
>"bit late for that now isn't it?"
>fair point
>you laughed 
>he pouted into his pillow
>you pulled him against your chest
>eventually you'd get a shower but right now it felt right to cuddle him
>you pointed out if family didn't want him happy maybe they didn't have his best interests at heart
>but you also didn't want to break up the family too
>plus you knew your place was tedious at best, you were essentially a complete stranger at the moment
>but you hoped that would change
>you kissed him on the forehead
>you knew from experience these things weren't easy but it was worth it
>you suggested a shower after about ten minutes
>"that sounds good"
>he was about to rise up on his own when you picked him up in a princess carry
>he tried protesting for all of a millisecond before he hushed himself
>at least he was learning

>he made himself comfortable in your arms before disappointment came from setting him down
>then you slipped into the bathtub and got him to sit in front of you
>the tight quarters of the bathtub meant you were cramped together
>warm water felt great
>he realized he didn't bring any actual toiletries 
>you remarked you were a little disappointed 
>you liked his smell
>"bah. don't say shit like that."
>he cradled his knees and tried to hide behind them
>"so weird"
>you remarked he liked it
>he didn't have a counter
>just tried bathing in silence 
>while pretending not to notice your erection against his back
>his tail twitched all the while

>you couldn't help yourself 
>before the bath was filled you picked him up
>a look over his shoulder showed he was hard again too 
>round two
>he panicked to shut the water off 
>so considerate 
>"stop thinking with your dick first"
>you whispered in his ear that was impossible when you had something this hot on your hands
>he fumbled through a response that ended up dying prematurely
>your cockhead against his ass made him squeak
>you knew he wanted you thinking with your dick
>you teased him by not pushing further up
>"why did you stop?"
>you wanted him to think with your dick too
>he wanted it, he just had to admit it
>thankfully the water hadn't washed away the mess of earlier love making
>made reentry easy
>you replied he'd just have to take what he wants this time
>he huffed but you felt his ass slowly impale itself
>"God I still can't believe I'm doing this"
>feeling him swallow your manhood was wonderful as is
>it was like your cock was home
>the lynx gasped when you held onto his slender core, fingers buried in his fur
>he'd have to milk your cock all by himself
>that didn't mean you weren't going to be grabbed
>like when you right hand ventured lower and stroked his own cock so very slowly
>that vanilla scent faintly on your nose as you buried your face in his neck
>he moaned quietly as he bottomed out
>"maybe, maybe this isn't so bad"
>you asked if you were allowed to call him maricon now too
>"do you want your huevos intact?" he groaned out

>you did value your huevos 
>hopefully he did too
>he rode your cock gently 
>after using his foot to turn off the water prematurely, you grabbed his thigh 
>his leg was left raised in your grip
>his legs were really fun to touch
>maybe Mariposa needed someone to provide pre match rubdowns
>the right amount of girly combined with muscle 
>despite the leg up in the air he had no problem riding you
>the soft splash with every thrust down was rhythmic 
>you felt him throb in your hand
>pre cum leaked into the bath as he squeezed you
>kissing his neck made him actually swoon
>his hand gripped your head
>all the while gently riding you dick
>you pondered if it would be too early to throw around the l word
>probably 
>romancing the little kitty was easy enough though
>your cock felt amazing in his walls
>that thick ass was a dick milking machine
>seems like his little closet act meant that talent went unused for all this time
>you were clapping those cheeks now though
>you started singing open praises of his tight ass
>"s-stop that"
>also hoped he liked your cock as much
>they seemed to be a perfect fit after all
>"dammit"
>that's all he could weakly reply with
>his cock was sort of hefty, average size but not as big as yours
>right now it was furiously throbbing in your grip
>his nuts must be aching to empty now
>you decided to reach down with the hand on his thigh and grab them 
>he whined
>all the while you didn't stop stroking him
>you asked if he loved that
>"goddamn you know I fucking do. it's not fair."
>you told him what's not fair is he had this dump truck all this time and you only just now got it in your hands
>"don't call it a 'dump truck' fucking maricon"
>you promised you wouldn't 
>it was clearly your cum dump

>you didn't say that part out loud for fear of your huevos 
>best not to test him too far
>time for that later
>you thought with the last trist and him setting his own pace, he'd have gone gentle
>instead he built up the speed until his meaty ass was smacking against your thighs 
>your hand stroked him harder in retaliation 
>then he countered by riding your shaft that much harder
>it was a competition now
>trying to hold out was getting impossible 
>his ass just felt too good
>his ass was definitely winning and you hated to admit that
>despite all his protests to the contrary it was made for this
>despite your best efforts his ass got the best of you this round
>you growled as you pumped your seed in him
>for what it's worth he was quick to follow, the act of refilling him actually pushing him over the edge
>at least that's what you saw as
>his body trembled as his own seed splattered everywhere
>you'd probably take a shower now at this rate
>for now you embraced him from behind and he embraced you from within
>your breath harsh and hot on the nape of his neck as you both recovered

>lifting him up was easy
>now there was an honest attempt to clean up
>felt good on your aching muscles 
>couldn't even imagine how Carlos felt
>still smacked his ass without mercy
>which earned you a smack upside your head
>and a string of Spanish curses
>other than that cleaning went off without a hitch 
>you almost got handsy again while drying off only to get a scowl 
>"don't you dare"
>his claw prodded your chest
>"not going to be able to wrestle right for a week" he muttered
>"can't believe I let you talk me into that"
>you pointed out he was in control last time
>he waved his paw dismissively then folded his arms
>then you remarked how hard it was to look tough, being nude and all
>he almost protested when you nabbed him again, plopped him back on the bed and then scooped him into your embrace
>he admitted defeat after a while though
>or passed out
>didn't know which
>you were eager to sleep too
>next morning you were pleasantly surprised he was still cuddled up to you
>his body heat noticeable even under the blanket
>you woke him up softly and he mumbled
>then wiggled out of your grip
>trying to look all frustrated wasn't a good look for him
>didn't help his tail twitched as he went to clean up in the bathroom
>you might have smacked his ass again if you weren't sure you'd get to keep the hand afterwards
>his energy was wonderful though
>seemed to be much more of a morning person
>he had packed a spare set of street clothes and came out looking almost unassuming
>a sporty tank top and worn jeans 
>you pointed out his pants hugged his hips like a girls 
>he told you to shut up
>very much a morning person
>you cleaned up and you both headed over to the diner across the street
>breakfast would feel great right about now

>he was definitely more in control of himself on this outing
>maybe the sort of promise of you being on your best behavior did it
>he wasn't using the menu as a shield this time at least
>you offered to pay and he was actually taken aback
>breakfast was pretty basic diner food but after last night it really recharged your batteries
>the urge to tease him about that was strong but you held back
>he was talkative and you didn't want to spoil that
>"so what do you do for a living?"
>"do you live in town?"
>a lot of questions directed to you that you were happy to answer
>you hoped this would establish more trust
>you were as honest as possible
>he seemed pleasantly surprised you weren't a NEET
>"explains why you're in shape"
>very restrained compliment but you'd take it
>physical work did have its benefits
>he'd already appreciated you far more openly before but the words were at least a nice cherry on top 
>you asked if he'd ever seen the town
>"never really actually walked around it"
>granted, not the most exciting tour
>a trek around town would at least count as a date in your eyes
>you warned him ahead of time about town being a little… underwhelming 
>"my family were farmers before the showbiz thing worked out. I think I'll survive."
>you didn't think he'd have been snooty honestly
>more like you were setting up that it was good luck finding a lot of stuff open on Sunday afternoon
>"I figure we'll find something to do"
>oh you hoped that was true 
>with breakfast done you set out with him riding shotgun in your car
>your attempt to mistake his thigh for the ability to take your car out of park earned you a slap on the wrist

>touring around town was about as humdrum as you thought it would be
>true to his word he wasn't snubbing your town
>it made sense really, he'd seen towns like this all on the road
>that did make you want to address the elephant in the room
>you asked if he was staying around
>"why do you ask?"
>he knew why and you said as much
>he tried to not look at you
>"so you'd want me back?"
>of course
>he looked taken aback 
>by now you'd parked 
>it was a lot to expect on what was essentially a handful of meetings
>but you saw the chemistry you two had and you hoped he did too
>he considered things for a moment
>"you're sure?"
>he looked to be scrutinizing you 
>yes you were sure
>very sure
>"I can take at most a month off before I have to go back to the promotion."
>you could work with that
>you'd just have to dazzle him enough he'd keep coming back
>you told him he wouldn't regret it
>was he flustered?
>he looked adorable
>you'd been parked for a while 
>an idea occurred
>he could save money staying at your place
>"you're not going to do anything weird are you?"
>you asked to define weird
>"trying to get me in some maid outfit or tie me to your bed or some shit"
>you looked away then said no that wasn't the intention
>besides the Mariposa thing was more than enough
>he scoffed at that
>taking him to the local park was a good way to change the subject
>at least he didn't say no
>you could see he was looking around a lot
>maybe nervous around people
>you didn't try to push but you did reach out for his paw
>initially he was timid and a little confused
>but eventually he reciprocated and gripped back
>it would be ok
>that seemed to calm him
>it was obvious this was all new to him
>being this open without it being a character
>thankfully no one was at the park this hour
>had the place to yourselves 
>that's why you felt confident pushing him against a tree and kissing him
>he was shocked but you broke the kiss before he could really react
>he was a stuttering mess now
>but wasn't hostile to the idea
>you continued your walk without even addressing it
>aside from a query that that wasn't so bad, was it
>"no"
>he still looked baffled
>"it's just… a lot to think about."
>maybe he had an easier time accepting quasi-anonymous sex than genuine affection like that
>might have never guessed it would be like this
>probably just assumed it was like some grindr hookup
>you were more sentimental than that

>Carlos did take you up on the offer to stay at your place
>hell, the idea he was willing to pay for a motel the entire month just to stay was sweet
>but there was no reason for it
>he grabbed his stuff and checked out
>thankfully, it didn't seem like his family was part of the same wrestling promotion
>no one really was worried he took off for a short while
>he insisted he crash on your couch 
>you insisted you'd be a bad host if he didn't share your bed
>"we both know you're going to just try touching me"
>and your retort was an honest yes but also to point out he didn't seem to mind you touching him
>he brushed off the remark and unpacked 
>he seemed to go overboard on the hair care products 
>you wanted to ask how his family didn't already know he was gay
>but thought better of it
>he was already stepping into uncertain waters so you'd didn't want to spook him
>though honestly his little flamboyant side couldn't be more obvious
>the lynx was cute, mannerisms and all
>he just had a hard time showing it
>you wondered just what his family told him for him to hide like that
>still, that was hopefully something in the past
>you hoped 
>at least you could maybe work him through it
>your tour of your place was rather short
>granted how were you to impress someone with a studio apartment 
>his motel room might have been bigger
>but he at least wasn't a snob about it
>he offered to pay for pizza at least
>there was only one pizza place in town
>so selection was pretty limited
>he got meatlovers
>the jokes write themselves 
>while waiting on pizza he sat on your couch
>the diminutive lynx practically sunk into the seats
>he sat there in silence, possibly deep in thought
>you sat next and decided now the time was ripe for mischief
>or more realistically 
>making him a nervous wreck
>or getting slapped
>either or
>it was time for the old yawn and stretch your arm maneuver 
>instantly denied
>"I'm not a girl dammit"
>you remarked he sounded like one last night
>the pizza boy saved you from whatever Carlos was about to do
>you smacked his ass on his way to the door and his eyes said you were lucky he was occupied 
>he didn't bother with formalities and handed over the cash and tip
>the pizza box was plopped onto the table unceremoniously 
>perhaps the ass slap was too far? 
>you apologized and he waved it away before sitting back down
>"you're impossible"
>you told him having a boyfriend like him made it easy
>his ears flattened and he looked at something interesting on the floor

>you offered him a slice and kicked back
>he took it and ate quietly
>never seen someone delicately eat pizza before
>you asked if this was so bad?
>just two guy hanging out that happened to be much much more intimate 
>quiet little moments like this
>raucous sex whenever
>even love
>you pointed out how these weren't bad and he knew
>you couldn't force him one way or the other
>but you pointed out if anything happened with his family he had a place here
>"this is a so fast"
>you put your hand in his paw
>put on your best face and told him you had plenty of time
>he seemed actually melt at that
>now you were able to drape your arm around him
>all the hostility was a front
>he ended up leaning on you and relaxing
>you dared not eat pizza right now
>just kind of cuddled there 
>over the next week you seemed to get to him
>he got softer
>maybe because he was expecting just pump and dump
>the whole friends aspect helped
>he eased up considerably
>maybe the idea that he didn't have to hide it
>for someone who initially was so uptight he sure loved waking you up with blowjobs
>you could get used to busting a load down his kitty throat every morning 
>at least took the edge off for work
>whenever he wore the Mariposa outfit it was an unspoken sign to rail him
>degrading him verbally seemed to turn him on
>as did all the wrestling
>you even finally got to jackhammer him
>bent nearly in half into the couch while you mercilessly pounded it
>hardest nut of your life
>full on collapsed onto the couch
>made you happy he was slowly growing to accept himself
>eventually he got less tense about it all
>accepted himself
>no idea if his family would but that was a problem for later
>the month seemed to fly by but in a fun way
>so when it was the last day, Carlos was a changed man
>or maybe this was how he was without the fear
>you'd managed to show him it wasn't all bad being a "maricon"
>still earned you an arm punch when you jokingly called him that
>when he left for his promotion he texted you whenever possible
>phone calls and photos back and forth
>he was far more outgoing through text
>even though he was still worried about family he liked what you two had
>he eventually agreed to go steady
>you remember the day you got him to admit he loved you too
>a formality because you two just kind of clicked
>still nice to hear
>every couple months he had off and immediately made a beeline for your place
>the tiny lynx was eventually a fixture in your house
>even moved into a local promotion despite it paying less
>slowly, very slowly he moved in
>became comfortable 
>became your boyfriend
