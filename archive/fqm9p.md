Dark, dilapidated, perilous. Hoskin Manor was all of these, among other adjectives. And Sunny wouldn't have it any other way. No matter how much he begged his parents or Mari to bring him there, they would all refuse. No matter who he asked, he was given the same excuse.

Without fail, it was always some variation of 'It's too dangerous'. His folks would try to dissuade him further by telling him stories of those who ventured into the Manor, either never to be seen again, or scarred for life with what they saw. 

Sunny stood steadfast, despite all of that. He was going to Hoskin Manor to see it all, and no one was going to stop him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

10:32 PM.

Sunny was supposed to be asleep, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't. He made a mental note to finally check out the manor whenever possible. Tonight was finally going to be the night, it seemed. 

Sunny did his best to stay quiet while getting out of bed. He grabbed a backpack loaded with 2 flashlights, spare batteries, a camera, and other assorted tools. Now, he was ready.

Sunny sneaked his way out, and headed Hoskin Manor as fast as he could without being spotted by anyone. After a close call with a police cruiser, he finally made it.

Hoskin Manor.

Sunny stood in front of the main doors, in awe of what he was seeing. Many of the windows were shattered completely, others still standing. Much of the wall was decaying, owing to decades of neglect.

Sunny gently opened the doors, took out a flashlight, and went inside. *click*

The main hallway was illuminated, decay on full display. Bugs scattered from the bright light, scurrying to their nests. Every footstep our little explorer took echoed through the building.

As much as Sunny didn't want to admit it, he felt rather creeped out at the sheer loneliness he put himself into. He glanced into every room, every crevice, trying to find something of note. After several minutes of searching the first floor, he found nothing. Only bugs and dust.

As Sunny climbed the spiral staircase to the second floor, he felt a chill up his spine, upon seeing a void dissipate like fog in the hallway. No matter how much Sunny wanted to flee the area, a part of him wanted to press on. He wasnt going to leave empty handed now, was he?

He combed the hall to his left, exploring it. He found a dusty book, written in a scribbly language he didn't understand. As he picked it up to put it in his backpack, he felt a sensation.

A sensation as if he was being watched. When it became too much to bear, he whipped back, flashlight in hand. He saw...

Nothing. Looks like this place was taking a toll on him. Sunny jammed the book into the backpack and headed towards the spiral staircase, when he spotted a faint red glow coming from one of the rooms on the opposite hallway.

Something about that glow was different, however. Something about that glow was... comforting to him. He trudged closer and closer to the room where it was coming from. Sunny took a peek inside.

Inside, was a tennis ball sized glowing orb, laying on the floor, alongside a busted display case. Ornate markings were etched onto the orb, glowing a darker shade of red. The orb was alluring, prompting Sunny to inch closer and closer.

Sunny put his backpack down, and reached out to the orb to pick it up. The orb was extremely hot to the touch, and melted into a mercury-esque substance. Sunny experienced an extreme burning sensation in his hand.

The substance rushed towards Sunny's hand, and began seeping into it. The burning sensation spread towards his whole body, making Sunny feel as if his insides and skin were on fire. 

Sunny let out screams of agony, as his insides felt like they were churning. As the sensation intensified, his body began to transform. His skin turned extremely pale, almost being white as paper. His teeth grew tougher, with some even becoming fangs. Sunny's eye's turned from a shade of brown, to crimson. He could even feel his soul malform.

After a few minutes, the sensation dulled, allowing Sunny to stand on his own two feet again. Sunny grabbed the backpack, and ran as fast as he could, towards the front door. Much like his body, his mind was racing.

"WHY DID I DECIDE TO COME HERE THAT WAS SO STUPID- OH GOD, WHAT IF THAT PAIN CAUSED SOMETHING WORSE- IF MARI AND MY PARENTS FIND OUT ILL BE DEAD- WHY DO I FEEL SO WEIRD"

were a few of his thoughts as he raced home, eager to be safe & sound with his family after what he had come into contact with.

For once, Sunny felt as if he should have listened.

-----------------CHAPTER BREAK--------------------

Finally. He was back home, after the most arduous running session Sunny had in is life. He did his best to re-enter the house without disturbing the sleep of his parents. Those two slept like logs, which would be no problem. Mari was a different story, however.

Somehow, she could tell when Sunny wasn't in his bed. Gotta be an instinct of hers. Sunny slowly trudged the stairs and headed towards the bedroom. When he opened the door, he found Mari fast asleep. Must've gotten lucky.

Sunny slinked into bed, and went to sleep. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunny awoke to the smell of eggs permeating the house. Looks like Dad was cooking breakfast today. As he let out a mighty yawn, he felt something puncture his lip. A quick hand rub shows it drew blood.

Sunny ran to the bathroom to assess the damage. He gazes into the mirror, and flips his bottom lip down. There's a sizeable gash, bleeding profusely. 'Oh dear. I have fangs too!? What did that orb do to me?!' He thought to himself.

Just as panic began to set in, the lip wound regenerated, and sealed up, preventing any further blood loss. Sunny stood silent in amazement for a minute, processing what just happened.

'What the hell, I can heal faster now?! This is, unexpected... Maybe that orb did some good for me..."

Sunny stood there, lost in his thoughts for a minute, before being startled by a frantic knock on the door. 'Sunny, please hurry up in there, I have to pee!' Sunny drabbed the leftover blood with toilet paper, and flushed it down. 

'Jeez Sunny, what took you so long!?' Mari said. Sunny headed downstairs without saying a word. Mari immediately noticed Sunny's stained lip. As much as she wanted to say something, she had more important business to attend to.

Sunny headed to the dining table, and sat down, waiting for Dad to finish cooking. 'Hey Dad. Making breakfast today?' 'Yep. Ma had some errands around town to do, so I'm filling in for her. Had a good nights sleep yester...'

Mr. Suzuki turned to face his son, skin much paler than normal. When he squinted, he could make out blood on his lips too. Whatever was going on, it wasn't good. 'Um Sunny, you feel alright? You don't look too well.'

'I feel fine, dad.' Sunny said, with shakiness in his voice. 'You clearly don't look or sound too well, Sunny. Go get some rest.' Mr. Suzuki demanded.

'Can I have breakfast first?' 'Sure, Sunny, but after that, you're going back to bed, and getting some rest.' As Sunny ate his breakfast, he noticed that it didn't taste as well. Perhaps the orb did something to his taste buds as well. Wouldn't surprise him.

Sunny finished his breakfast, and went back to bed. After the father finished serving Mari, he went to the phone, picked it up, and started dialing.

*ring* *ring* ring* 

'Hello Mr Suzuki, this is Dr. Ross, you want to schedule an appointment?'

'Yes, for Sunny. Are you free for tommorow?'

-----------------CHAPTER BREAK--------------------

Sunny's first day as a vampire was shockingly uneventful. One would be forgiven for expecting otherwise, but our resident concerned father stood in the way of that. Aside from laying in bed, counting as the hours flew buy, the only other thing Sunny did was have dinner with his family.

---------------------3 Hours Earlier---------------------

"Sunny, dinners ready! I know you aren't feeling too well, but you can come down if you want to." said Mrs. Suzuki. "Coming, Mom!"

As Sunny exited his room and went into the dining room, Mrs. Suzuki could see why her husband was concerned for Sunny. His skin was extremely pale, just a few shades away form being as white as paper.

Mrs. Suzuki quietly mumbled to herself. 'Oh dear.' 

"Sunny, please sit down." Sunny takes his seat, and braces himself. "Sunny, you have a doctor's appointment tommorow. You are going to have to wake up earlier than usual, at around 7:00. We leave at 7:30, the appointment is at 8:30. So, get some shuteye earlier, okay?"

Sunny nods back. "Okay." Mrs. Suzuki was sure that she saw fangs in Sunny's mouth. Dinner isn't the time for more worries, so she sweeps it under the mental rug.

The Suzuki family finish their dinner without incident, and continue resuming their activities. Sunny returns to bed, and sleeps for the rest of the day.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunny's second day as a vampire begins. He wakes up early, gets dressed, freshens himself up for the doctors appointment.

During the short drive to the hospital, an unusual feeling in Sunny grows. He can't quite put his finger on it, but it's like a twisted cross of hunger and arousal, burrowing in his stomach. It calls for him to latch onto anyone, anyone at all, to perform unspeakable acts.

Sunny suppresses the feeling and dismisses it as stress. After a lengthy wait, the nurse calls for Sunny.

'Sunny Suzuki?' "Yep, that's for us." Mr and Mrs. Suzuki say. The nurse gives her introductions to the family, and asks Sunny some questions. 'So, Sunny, what brings you here?'

He hesitates to answer, but eventually buckles. "s- Since two nights ago, my skin has gotten pale, and I've been feeling tired all the time." The nurse nods while taking notes. "Have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary while this has been happening?"

Sunny and his parents shake their heads. The nurse steps outside to talk to Sunny's doctor for a few minutes. When all that's said and done, the doctor enters.

After the doctor gives his greetings, he tells the Suzukis what the plan is for Sunny. "He going to be placed in the ICU for 3-4 days, they're gonna run tests on him every now and then to see what is afflicting him." 

Mr and Mrs. Suzuki's eyes widen at the news. "O-oh my! It's that bad?!" The doctor tells Mrs. Suzuki to calm down. "We don't know that yet. As I have stated before, we will be testing him to see what it is, and how bad it is. As always, we'll notify you if anything happens."

As Sunny is hauled off to the ICU, the feeling in his stomach grows.

-----------------CHAPTER BREAK--------------------

After a change from his usual shirt, vest, cargo shorts, into a hospital gown, Sunny was hauled off to the ICU wing, where he could be monitored and taken care of. He was sedated, and put on various IVs.

When Sunny woke up, he asked where he was. 

"Well Sunny, you're in the Intensive Care Unit. We monitor you to make sure your condition doesn't get worse. If you need anything else, I'll be right here." His overseer said to him. Sunny nodded his head and laid back down.

After a few hours of him dozing off, he returns to reality when that feeling in his stomach returns, stronger than before. The previous time, it was shouting to be quenched. Now, it was yelling. Sunny had to work hard to keep that urge down the previous time it appeared. He wasn't confident that he could manage the same for this occasion.

Sunny took deep breaths to calm himself down. 'Breathe in... Breathe out... Breathe in...' 'Whats that smell?' He thought to himself. It was an aroma similar to freshly cooked beef with an obscene amount of seasoning. Said smell was getting closer, accompanied by the sound of footsteps.

The smell and feeling intensified as the footsteps drew closer, overwhelming Sunny. Another nurse came in. 'Looks like that's where it came from.' Sunny thought. "Hello Sunny, I'm just here to take some measureme-" Sunny, overwhelmed by his feeling, lunges at the nurse, and draws blood.

As Sunny feeds from the Nurse's neck, euphoria pulses through his veins and muscles. He hasn't felt so alive in years. In his mania though, the screams of onlooking doctors, nurses and other staff didn't register to him. The only thing worth considering to him at that moment, was feeding.

After several minutes of feeding, the voice of a shouting man finally registered to him. "GET OFF THAT MAN RIGHT NOW, OR I WILL SHOOT! DO YOU UNDERSTAND!?" Sunny stood up from the nurse, and walked towards the man shouting at him.

Without hesitation, the man took the shot, and the world went dark.

-----------------CHAPTER BREAK--------------------

Sunny lapses in an out of consciousness. One second, he's in a metal container, inside a cargo plane. The other, he's transported by truck to heaven's knows where.

Eventually, he properly wakes up. He's in a cell with metal floors, walls and door. He feels a tightness around his neck, and uses the reflective walls as a mirror. Sunny is fitted with a thick collar, with a pulsing blue and red light. His regular clothes were swapped with a mustard yellow jumpsuit. 

Sunny barely has time to think before his cell door opens.

"EV-J756, do us a favor and step out of your cell."

Sunny, stuck between a rock and a hard place, can only comply. The guards take him out of his cell, and escort him. The guards take Sunny to a door, and hush him inside.

Two more guards are inside the room, accompanying a middle aged man with greying hair. "Sunny Suzuki, take a seat."

Sunny takes a seat, and braces. "Suzuki, do you recollect how you obtained your current form?" 

"I-I touched this, o-orb, I think it was an orb, it melted and burned a lot, then seeped into me." The man takes notes, and proceeds with the questions. "And where did you find this 'orb'?" Sunny stutters before giving a clear answer.

"Hoskin Manor. I found it while exploring it." "Where is this Hoskin Manor?" "Just outside Faraway, Maryla-" The interrogator cuts him off.

"That's about all the information we need. Guards, escort him back to his cell."

Sunny is escorted back to his cell without incident. With the interrogation over, nothing is preventing Sunny from realizing the situation he is in. 'I-Im stuck here.... Forever... All because I decided to go to that stupid Manor!'

With the gravity of the situation making itself apparent, Sunny curls into a fetal position, and sobs. His cries can be heard throughout the cell block he's located in.
