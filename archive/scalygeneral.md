This is a temporary solution unless Rentry proves to be a reliable platform or if a better place is found.

##General

**OP Template**
This didn't get nuked (it's technically newer and meant to be more compact and remove the FAQ, but has never been adopted - up to the rest of the general otherwise).

Regardless, we don't like to use /trash/'s subject field because it leaves gaps on archiving websites as a result of it coming in *almost* six years too late.

**Reverse Searching Basics and High Resolution Image Saving for /trash/men (and other fine Anonymous)**
A fairly old Pastebin giving advice on finding the source and getting higher quality images where possible.

An ongoing list to document games that might be relevant to the general's tastes.

Also got nuked and so was also moved to another solution.

**/scaly/'s Index of Argonian Mods for Skyrim**
Elaborate lists of Argonian-related mods for TES5 but also contains a little TES4 on the side.
