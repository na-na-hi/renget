######Filtering
When you find something you don't want to see, you can simply filter it by pressing the dropdown button near the post's number. If you don't like a certain namefag, you can hide all their posts by clicking Name. If they are anonymous or have non-standard image dimensions, you can filter for those by clicking the corresponding button. If the image is commonly posted, you can filter it's MD5 too. If you want to filter by filenames, you will need to set up a regex for it. ChatGPT can help you make one, or feel free to ask in the thread for help.

######Recursive hiding and stubs
You can filter replies to filtered posts by enabling recursive hiding. You can remove the stubs that tempt you into clicking them entirely by unchecking the show stubs box. These settings are found in the "Main" section of the settings.
