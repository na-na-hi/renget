For a /degen/-lite experience, install 4chan X and use it's filter.

4chan X is a browser extension that enhances your experience on 4chan by adding various features, including customizable filters. Filters help you manage and tailor your browsing experience by allowing you to hide or highlight specific content based on your preferences. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install 4chan X and set up filters:

######Step 1
Click this link and install the extension. https://www.4chan-x.net/
For mobile, you can use Clover for simple filters. https://chandevel.github.io/Clover/

######Step 2
When you find something you don't want to see, you can simply filter it by pressing the little dropdown button near the post number. If you don't like a certain namefag, you can hide all their posts by clicking Name. If they are anonymous and have non-standard image dimensions, you can filter for those by clicking the corresponding button. If the image is commonly posted, you can filter it's MD5 too. If you want to filter by filenames, you will need to set up a regex for it. ChatGPT can help you make one, or feel free to ask in the thread for help.

Click on the dropdown menu and select the filter type, then delete the corresponding line.

######Recursive hiding and stubs
You can filter replies to filtered posts by enabling recursive hiding. You can remove the stubs that tempt you into clicking them entirely by unchecking the show stubs box. These settings are found in the "Main" section of the settings.

######Dealing with trolls
If a particular user is repeatedly bothering you, just filter and ignore them. You won't see their posts and they won't get the satisfaction of you seeing their posts. Remember, when the community filters a particular user, they get no replies and are essentially forgotten. Even if they don't go away at first, they will eventually move on to a different community with easier targets.
