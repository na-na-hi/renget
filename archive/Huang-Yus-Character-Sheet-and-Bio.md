Heavenly (175) 
Heart Force (165)

 - Tao Qi Root (120) (Earth Affinity) (Upgraded through Ancient Sect)
 - Mortal Body Talent (120) (Lightning Proof Body)
 - Divine Soul Talent, Soul Scenery (65) (The Thousand Mountains Reaching Nirvana)
>Personal History:
Orthodox Sect
Ancient Sect (45): *The Polished Grains form The Immortal Peak* has a history reaching back to the original Taoist sages and their attempts to achieve immortality, it is even said that it was the first Earth-based sect to be formed, even before the *Flying Stone Escapes The World* and *Emperor's Golden Ascent* sects.
Steep Decline (55): The sect was nearly wiped out while Huang Yu was off on his adventure and upon returning to it's destroyed state he has been attempting to salvage and if possible revive the sect using what few materials were left behind.
>Life Encounters
- Unusual Encounter (I spent a few years travelling with a Buddhist sage and his demonic companions, it expanded my mind and allowed me to momentarily reach Nirvana, thus reaching the seventh realm)
- Accidental Guidance (While not a Buddhist myself, I have come to respect the teachings and see the world from a more grounded perspective due to my time with said Buddhist)
- Silly Mischief (I was dragged into the antics of the Buddhist's demonic companions and have, through osmosis, developed a love of minor pranks and a thicker skin to such japes)
>Fated Encounter:
Immortal Scripture: Of the few pieces of undamaged sect belongings that were left behind following it's destruction was a well-hidden cache of ancient scrolls, each bearing an incredibly powerful technique, all of which must be studied by Huang Yu to try and reverse engineer the weaker variants that were taught to initiates of *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak*.
>Fighting Style:
Kicks
> Comprehension:
Immortal Grade (25)
>Techniques:
Cultivation:
 - Qi Gathering (Earth): *The Bottomless Pit Draws In The Land* (Orthodoxy Technique)
 - Support Technique (Spiritual): *Infinity Is A False Number*, learned from my Buddhist companion, it reinforces Spiritual Techniques and allows one to enter a Zen-state that is nigh-impossible to unbalance (Immortal Scriptures Technique)
Offensive:
 - Barrage (Spiritual): *Diamond Rain Pierces The Soul* is the most violent of *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak's* Techniques, as it is quite literally a form of "Death by a thousand cuts", as each blow of glowing flying crystal will pierce through and damage the soul of it's target, and in the most severe cases, seals their cultivation. (Immortal Scriptures Technique)
 - Attack (Earth): *Mountain Rises to Pierce The Heavens* is a direct, yet obvious attack that combines both the surrounding qi and one's inner qi into a golden aura around one's strike, before delivering a crushing blow that shatters mountains. (Orthodoxy Technique)
 - Trump (Spiritual): *Bow and Scrape* is a powerful two-hit kick attack based around forcing one's incredible spiritual into the tip of one's foot then delivering a powerful binding attack through contact, locking the opponent into a deep bow, one they can't break without expending massive amounts of qi, then delivering a second massive blow that has never failed to send an opponent flying. (Kicks)
Defensive:
 - Barrier (Earth) *Impenetrable Jewelled Fortress* was made to mimic the fortresses of great Martial Empires, it does so by surrounding a chosen spot with a crystalline aura that can stop even the most destructive attacks. (Orthodoxy Technique)
 - Endurance (Earth) (35) *Toil Under The Sun* is one of the first techniques learned by initiates to *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak*, as it is learned while performing menial labours for years in the Sects large gardens and formerly grand palisade, it is also often copied by other sects due to it's ease of use and understanding.
Movement:
 - Footwork (Earth) *The Dust That Clouds Beneath You* is the second learned technique of initiates of *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak*, it focuses on creating sharp and hard movements that obscure your location and direction with sheer speed. (Kicks)
- Travel (Spiritual) (15) *We Never Left The Buddha's hand* was a partially self-discovered technique that Huang Yu fully realized after studying a story from one of The Buddhist's demon companions, upon ruminating on it, and finally reaching the end of his journeys with them, Huang Yu came to the realisation that where they were now, and where they where when they started, were all in the palm of the Buddha, and that the distance between one point in a palm and another, is no distance at all, and in one step, returned home, only to see the remains of his destroyed sect.
Auxiliary:
 - Profession (Earth) *Growing Jade Vine* Is *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak's* most economically minded technique, as it is one of the only recorded techniques that can replenish and even grow mineral-based substances, like Jade, Gold, Diamond, and even more mystically endowed materials, this allowed the clan to become a major trade power all on it's own. (Immortal Scripture Technique)
 - Detection (none) *Acknowledge the Land* is one of the most effective detection techniques due to it's ability to detect any and all alterations in the world over an entire country's size, the only real downside being that it's improper use will permanently seal the eyes of whomsoever uses it, making most users appear blind to anyone without the ability to sense qi. (Immortal Scripture Technique)
> Skills and Wealth:
 - Excellent Teacher (10): Apparently spending so much time around sages has rubbed off on Huang Yu, and he is fully capable of passing on knowledge and teaching others about both the Tao and Buddhism.
 - True Wisdom (0): Reaching Nirvana, even if only temporarily has left an undeniable mark on Huang Yu's mind if not soul.
>Gatherings and Major Events:
 - Immortal Alliance: Though he was not there when the oath was sworn, Huang Yu's clan agreed to join the alliance against the heavens, as for how Huang will uphold this oath is up to debate, as he is more focussed on restoring his sect first.
 - The Heavens Abyss: Huang would only go here after gaining a good crop of initiates, at which point the only reason he'd be down there is to obtain rare materials to grow.
 - Alliance Catacombs: Huang has no reason to go here save finding promising young Cultivators who have bitten off more then they can chew.
 - The Eternal Necropolis: Huang is strictly hear to gather info from the spirits, and, if possible, find a way to aid them in escaping this stage of the samsara cycle so that they can escape the cycle altogether and become as the Buddha.
 - The Throne of Heaven: Another recruitment site for Huang Yu, also a decent training spot for facing off against Tribulation.
 - Teleportation Arrays: *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak* once had one of these arrays, alas, much like most of the sects' grounds, it has been damaged beyond repair.
 - All Secrets Pavilion: A good place if one wants information, Huang would only go here under duress though, due to their exorbitant fees for even the simplest of truths.
 - The War God Index: Huang Yu is solely here to find promising youths who will likely be downed in the qualifying rounds.
 - The Grand Auction: Whilst *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak* is currently only one member, Huang Yu would be a fool to not show up for the auction to offer what few mystically endowed materials he could grow, after all, whilst he might not care for material things now, his sect's teaching can only grow again if their prestige rises once more.

>Personality:
 Huang Yu is often mistaken as a kindly, if harried man, and while this is true for the most part, he is in fact a calculating and barely present individual, more commonly referred to as being "Galaxy Brained", due to his understanding of the "True Nature" of the world. Of course, this mindset is at odds with his desire to revive his sect, a material world's attachment that greatly weakened his sense of Nirvana, indeed, it is this desire that drives him to continue his cultivation and to acquire students to train so that they may take over the sect from him.
 Huang Yu is often prone to making puns and minor jokes, a trait he picked up from his travels with a bunch of ornery demons, this trait also comes with a seemingly ever-present smile upon his face.

>History:
 Huang Yu was born in one of the Mortal, formerly Martial Empires that dots the border between the Central Territory and the Unknown Expanse, seemingly doomed to a life of mundanity, it was only by striking out on his own one day out of sheer boredom that he would stumble upon the Cultivator Jian Fen. Jian Fen was on his own travels for undefined reasons, but seemingly didn't mind having the eager young Huang Yu following him, indeed, it seemed at that point that the cultivator had what he wanted and lead the youth back to *The Polished Grains Form The Immortal Peak* sect, and promptly put him to work.
 Following a span of five years of intensive Farm-work and small moments of qi-training, Huang Yu had finally broken into the Cultivation Realms, and began a reasonably paced ascension through the realms. This would have been his lot until, at the age of 49, he learned that he would face Tribulation from the gods in his 50th year for his attempts to cultivate immortality, shaken from this, Huang Yu asked what form the Tribulation would take. The Tribulation, at this stage, would take the form of a heavenly lightning that cannot be weakened or blocked, only dodged, and furthermore, going by cultivation standards, Huang Yu would be dodging the lightning for a full year. Understanding the inherent dangers and potential collateral damage of mystical lightning, Huang Yu left for the Lost Territory, believing that the only things that could have been caught in the ensuing chaos would have been demons and evil cultivators.
 Huang Yu's tribulation would be a terrible blight on the Lost Territory, not that he would care, until the last month of it, wherein he would meet the group of strange individuals that would change his life. Namely, he would meet a Buddhist Sage and his attendants, a gaggle of three demons and a dragon, being shamed by the monk for brining his tribulation upon anywhere that was inhabited, regardless of the nature of the ones being caught up in it, Huang Yu would be conscripted into the Sage's service, and following the final month of his tribulation, Huang Yu would begin his travels with this strange group.
 Following a century's worth of adventure, trials, and battle, the group would finally reach the fabled lands of the west, and obtain the legendary Buddhist scriptures. Huang Yu, having learned much, achieving not only the seventh cultivation realm, but unlocking Nirvana after studying under the sage, would finally bid farewell to the group, as he headed home.
 Alas, even with his newly achieved inner peace, Huang Yu was not prepared for the sight that awaited him, finding his Sect, once bristling with life and activity, now in ruins, with no sign of his fellow cultivators, or even any of the initiates. Huang Yu would scour the rubble for anything to explain what happened, only discovering a secret cache of clan scrolls, and a signed scroll detailing the acceptance of his sect into the Immortal Alliance. His understanding of Nirvana damaged, Huang Yu would turn his attentions towards repairing the damaged grounds, all the while ruminating on whether he should restore the sect, or let go, and embrace Nirvana once more.
 Huang Yu, after restoring the sect's grounds, would meditate on this decision for a full year, before deciding that whilst the mortal realm is but an illusion, it is his illusion, and therefore, his responsibility to fix.
