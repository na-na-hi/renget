#Welcome to the Build Archive for Harahel v0.7
The Archivist constructed this repository to house information discovered about Earth-Origin Harahelians (henceforth EOH, pronounciation: ayy-yo.) I, Camilla (or Milly), am the current maintainer of the archives. Most of what is below is the work of my forebear, with additions made sporadically by means of my own observations and meetings. 

Please make yourself comfortable, and remember these files are the personal information of the individuals in question, I — as current maintainer of the archives — know nothing of how they work or mentality so if there is a question you'll have to try and catch them in the guildhall or perchance run into them in the world. Harahel is currently in a state of flux so records may not be accurate, information is from recent observations.
Names in "quotes" never gave their name, at least that I could find, so I have taken time to give them one as a means of reference.
So tell me, who would you like to know about?
