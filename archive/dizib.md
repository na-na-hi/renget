**A friend.**
It hurts. This is your first thought as you regain consciousness, you didn't know where you were and how you got there. Your last memory was fighting a Brazilian man, and losing your arm. It was dark, and you couldn't see anything looking around. Your arm was still bleeding, and as you wonder why you haven't died of blood loss yet, you hear a figure approaching you. You panic and attempt to get off the bed, but the figure grabs your arm and comforts you. 

"You will be okay." The figure says as it's eyes start glowing and analyzing you. The golden eyes examine your body, especially taking notice of your arm.  You hear beeping, followed by the lights turning on, allowing you to see the appearance of the figure. She had long, smooth-looking, brown hair. Her arms were black, and with a closer look you see that it's made of metal. You come to the realization that she is a robot. After processing the information she got from scanning your body, she turns around and walks to a nearby monitor. 

After a few minutes, she walks back to you and feeds you some pills. Curiously, you ask what they are for as you swallow. You see her mouth moving, but you are unable to catch what she said or what she sounded like, as the pills quickly kick in, and you black out.

You come to again, only this time you're no longer feeling the pain in your arm. You look over, only to find a metal arm, connected to a bunch of wires, keeping it in place and providing power into it. The woman from earlier comes rushing to your side after realizing that you have woken up.

"You're finally awake", she says as she sits down on a chair next to your bed. She looks exhausted, her voice both shocked you and put you at ease, you felt as if she wanted nothing more for you than to be okay.

"My name is Roboco." she says, looking at you all the while. "I'm sorry for drugging you earlier, I didn't want you to be awake while I was treating your arm." You look at her and smile, not knowing what she did but thanking her for relieving the pain. "How are you feeling?" she asked, while she was caressing your now-metal arm. You tell her that you feel great and powerful, like you had just discovered new strength within you. Her eyes beam with joy, happy that she was able to help you.

*Or so you thought.*

She stands up excitedly, and runs outside the room before you could ask where she was going. She comes back a few minutes later with several boxes of parts. You look at her in confusion as she giggles, before she runs up to you and offers you the same pills that you had earlier again. Trusting her, and thinking that she was going to upgrade your arm.

You wake up to be greeted by the sight of Roboco attaching a part on your other arm, which was completely fine. You ask her what's going on, and she stares at you, for a split second you notice her eyes glow red before turning back into gold again. 

"You told me you felt great and powerful, so I'm going to give you even more strength. I am going to make sure you feel great again." You insist that you're fine with the strength of one robot arm, and didn't need another. She stands up, and grabs a syringe before you could say anything else.

"You don't understand, I wasn't asking." Roboco says as she injects you with the syringe, which makes you start feeling sleepy.

"This is a lot more effective than the pills, you'll be out for longer. it gives me just enough time to finish." You see her face once more, before you black out again.

You wake up, but this time you weren't in your bed anymore. You were inside a glass casing, surrounded by wires. You no longer had a human body, and all that's "human" about you now is your head. The rest of your body was inside a dock, which what you assumed was a charging station. You were able to break free, and the casing opens. You felt dizzy looking around, as there was a scanner around your left eye that you couldn't remove. It was able to analyze things around you and saw things your right eye couldn't. You walk around, trying to get used to your vision while also looking for Roboco. You hear a bang to a room on your left, followed by things falling to the ground. You run inside and see Roboco, who almost cries in joy as she hugs you. You look at her wondering why she's happy, when you have a reason to be mad at her. Before you could express how much you don't appreciate being turned into a cyborg by force, she opens her mouth.

"Thank you." she stands puts her head on your chest, and holds you tighter. You look down and return the hug before asking her why she turned you into a cyborg.

"I've always been alone here. Everyone on the outside hates me and sees nothing more than a tool, a piece of metal they can order around and throw away."

"I wanted someone to be here with me."

You feel her start crying. You hold her closer to your chest, telling her it's okay to let it out and that you are there for her. You pat her in the back and tell her it will be alright.

"I just.." she pauses. You tilt your head in confusion as you wait for her to finish her sentence.

*"I just wanted a friend."*

All your anger dissapears into thin air as you smile and tell her that you'd gladly be her friend. You break the embrace and you two start picking up the items that she dropped on the floor, as you start to accept that you'll be a cyborg for your whole life now, and imagine what kind of life is waiting for you now that you chose to stay with Roboco.
