Steti wasn't the biggest bird on his team.

No, in contrary, the 5'3" Vox weighed in at under 130 pounds and was by far the lightest and thinnest, the very most lithe. This, and a few other factors including some unearned confidence and goading from his Raider buddies, made him a prime candidate for this scouting mission. They'd landed the Skipjack at an obscure port in the far reaches of the station, and its armor ensured it wouldn't get seen in a scan-- letting Stetikekiak exit into a hallway not far from the main bit of the station. He tapped on his headset to ensure it was working and then watched the airlock door close.

Once he was on his own, however, he started to pay especial attention to his equipment. He'd been given a chameleon projector to stay sneaky, and it was apparently a pretty quiet day on the station, but his main saving grace was the 'stealth suit' he'd specifically requested. The thing was mostly made of flexible rubber... truthfully, latex, and it didn't hide a damn thing about his figure. From his flexible legs and fairly thick thighs terminating in supple ass-cheeks to his soft, slightly tucked-in member, up the rest of his slender body, he had very little armor and would have to rely on its black, slightly shiny exterior to stay hidden. ...wait. He thought about it a moment. Why did he have a shiny suit if he was trying to stay hidden?

No, no. He had to keep his cool for this. All he needed to do was prowl the station an hour or two and get a good inventory on what was stored, and what sorts of personnel would be valuable to abduct. He was far from a skilled operative in the thieving or kidnapping department, but his buddies would always compliment him on his 'people skills'. They also tended to stare at Steti's ass when they said that. Regardless, that's what he would use-- deception and people skills, and most of all the projector. It'd be smooth sailing throughout!

He started prowling the first hallway in front of him. His slender figure crept forth, sidling along a wall as he approached an airlock titled 'art storage'. A quick peer through the window confirmed that it did, indeed, have crayons. Stetikekiak proceeded on and on until he'd whispered the contents of several low-security rooms into his headset, with a quiet chattering of response for each one. He finally reached Tool Storage, with a bounty of easily-accessed goodies, which he couldn't help but enter to get a better look. The airlock slid open, and Steti slipped inside, but in his quickness he realized that the suit had, in the moment of hurried movement, made a sound. A rather noticeable /squeak/. And once he had clambered into the center of the room, he noticed he wasn't alone. In the corner was a fairly buff, bald, grey-jumpsuited human, staring with eyes wide at the vulnerable Vox.

Steti's first instinct was to immediately slap the button for his chameleon projector located on his collar plastron. But he was not suddenly hidden from view-- the damn thing suddenly fizzled apart and fell to the ground, scorched and broken. He squawked in panic just as the Assistant lunged at him.

He was pinned immediately against a wall-- his short stature and thin proportions were nowhere near a match for the capable greyshit. His suit squeaked again and he felt a weak crow from his beak escape involuntarily as he struggled to keep his breath. "Gotcha," the Assistant spat, grinning a bit, clearly amped up on new adrenaline.

The Vox quietly creeled into his headset. "I'm caught," he squawked, "it's o-over."

"You speak Common at all, eh?" the Assistant said, not loosening his grip at all, even pressing further into Steti, keeping him up against the panel. "Might need it when you get a trial."

Steti groaned a little, struggling to take a breath, and tried to recollect his best Common. It wasn't much, though he'd had a little... experience. "Y-Yes," he muttered. "Please... please... do not tell of this. To anyone."

The bald man squinted a little. "Why not?"

"I do anything to... for you not to tell," the bird croaked. "...they give you nothing for tell. Please..."

He suddenly backed up and gave Steti some space, still pressing his hand somewhat against the bird's throat, but allowing him to finally breathe. The Assistant bit his lip and began examining the bird from head to talon, checking out each individual detail with scrutiny. An idea came to him, one he wasn't expecting, and he finally tilted his head back up. "Anything."

"Y-Yes," Steti muttered. "Well, but... not if death, or that bad kind of thing, yet almost anything."

"Well, I don't got death in mind. But I do wanna use you for something."

After a brief discussion, Steti became suddenly mortified. Or, at least, the revelation of his situation came over him in such force that he was struggling to stay level-headed with it. However, he took a deep breath and decided to go along with it. He brought a rolling chair out from one of Tool Storage's tables as the Assistant began to strip down slowly, setting his jumpsuit, full-to-the-brim grey slim-belt, and identification on his side of the room, in very plain view. He got down to a pair of white undergarments, which he also removed, leaving himself in the brimming nude with nothing but a pair of white socks, and a budding erection. Steti watched with a great bit of worry as the Assistant swiveled the chair once, let out a mighty sigh, and sat back. His dick was propped up straight and pointing outwards, starting to bob up and down in anticipation. The Vox gave it a long moment's thought, tried to reconsider, failed, and then approached. He swiveled around, revealing his plump latex-clad ass and thighs, and began to slowly maneuver his way onto the human's lap, butt-first. His slender legs made room and his toe-talons clenched. With almost nothing between him and the Assistant, he could nearly feel his skin shifting and getting goosebumps. Finally, between Steti's thighs, he spotted the Assistant's dong, which he began to- begrudgingly, at first- nestle between his thick, slick legs.

There was plenty of length to travel, and the human let out a deep, guttural sigh. Stetikekiak began lowering himself further and further, bringing his warm latex-clad thighs down his apparent captor's length. His tail budged out of the way, but his own hardening length was now acting as another part of the thighjob-- every inch traveled down the Assistant's sensitive flesh was another one he was frotting against Steti's dick contained within the Stealth Suit. Undeterred, the Assistant sat back with pleasure rocketing through him, and let the Raider do the moving from here on out. Each movement began to arouse both of them at once, though Steti tried to quietly muffle his sighs of embarrassment and lust. He could tell each heavy breath and soft moan would be picked up by his headset, straight to the Vox skipjack's comms room, but they'd never even told him how to turn the damn thing off-- and in the moment, he was too distracted to care.

The Assistant's arms and legs had gotten a bit limp, but his rod was made of diamonds-- throbbing and leaking a few long beads of precum as Steti massaged it timidly with his thighs. Still, he seemed to notice some hesitation, and spoke up, his tone snide. "Hrff. You upset about something, bird?"

Stetikekiak responded with a shaky huff. "This... is embarrassing. Am embarrassed, annoyed...?"

"Pshhh!" The human chuckled, blushing a bit as he felt Steti land in his lap fully, asscheeks rubbing up against his thighs, cocks frotting at their bases. "I don't know what the hell ya expected, showing up in a /kink suit/."

The bird cawed suddenly. "Is not a kink suit! Stealth suit!"

He responded by grasping Steti's asscheeks suddenly, groping him through the latex covering. The thin material was incredibly malleable and the feminine Vox could feel every bit of it, blood rushing to his dick. The human said, "The thing's made of rubber without any armor, squeaks when ya move too quick, and feels good when it's around my dick. You sure?"

Steti's head crooned a little, and he let out a soft groan of pleasure, starting to grip the Assistant's length more tightly and moving quicker. There was a pang of anguish and frustration in his voice. "Oh, /god/. It /is/ kink suit. Why..."

"Who knows? I don't really care. Just keep making /use/ of it. Damn." The human's grin widened and his face became flush as the thighjob increased its pace. With more determination and drive, now, the bird really started to get into it-- his meaty thighs were squishy and glided with very little effort around the Assistant's member, and it was easy for Steti to start gyrating his hips, making it an entire lapdance. His large Vox tail was jittering and swiveling around, now, and he couldn't help but keep getting more and more turned on, every soft squeak of the suit and loud moan of the human driving him just a bit crazier.

Still, the fact that the human was moaning loudly now wasn't that great for Stetikekiak's cover, and as things began to ramp up, he tilted his foggy helmet back, speaking in a lighter tone. "...Quieter, p-please."

The Assistant chuckled a breathy, taken-aback laugh, panting heavily as his groin boiled up with heat. "Sorry, eheh, just. Y'know."

"If you be quiet," the Vox creeled, suddenly more confident, "might let finish..."

That was enough. The bulky 6'1" Assistant suddenly zipped up, his moaning and panting now conveniently muffled. Each slick movement of Steti's dexterous thighs brought more precum out of his jittering tip until the whole process was immensely smooth. Smooth, tight, and now brimming with wetness. The bird continued slapping down his asscheeks against the Assistant's legs, frotting the both of them together, his own avian dick beginning to get wet inside the latex. But this whole process would come much sooner for the human than for the bird, and with a few over-exerted gruff moans, he suddenly started to finish. Steti pressed his latex-clad thighs together one last time, mostly burying the Assistant's length in tight embrace, and heard him suddenly burst out in a pleasure-filled moan.

The human grasped the office chair tightly and began bucking his hips up and down, pumping out thick strands of cum which began to splatter gratuitously all over Steti's thighs and groin. He struggled to keep any sound in, just panting and groaning with his jaw hung open in awe. It took a good twenty seconds for the glow to start to fade, and by the time he came to, he'd coated Steti's crotch in steaming cum, which was now leaking onto the floor.

"...that enough?" Steti asked. He was nervous, sure, but also a little addled-- his own cock was buzzing with need, but he forced his hands away from it for the time being.

"Yeah, hell... Jesus... fuck," the Assistant breathlessly replied. He put a gentle palm on the bird's back to beckon him off, which Steti did with some quickness, his own beak hanging open within the helmet. They looked at each other a moment, the human breaking out into a drained and amused laugh, but his expression suddenly disappeared as he spotted something behind Stetikekiak. The Raider immediately noticed, and turned around, dick waving in the open air, and froze once he spotted both the Head of Security and another Officer waltzing right into Tool Storage.

"No," Steti squawked.

"I mighta actually told 'em you were here right before we started," the Assistant muttered. "Probably shoulda let you know."

Before he had a chance to properly react, Stetikekiak found himself being paraded through the station in cuffs. His dick was now pressed tight against his belly, still encased in the suit, and a steady stream of the human's cum continued to drip from his utterly splattered groin. The Assistant eventually started to follow not far behind, having quickly thrown his clothes back on until he joined the capture party. Steti simply kept his beak shut, cawing silently in horror for what he'd gotten himself into. Embarrassment filled him, and although he couldn't hear anything on the other end of his headset, he was sure that the rest of the Raiders were chiding him about it. As he was paraded through half the station on the way to Security, he felt eyes drilling holes into him, humans tilting their heads and dropping their jaws, staring in disbelief that a cum-splattered Vox had just been arrested. Steti wasn't certain, but he could swear some of them were giving his private parts violating glances.

He'd finally reached a stage of acceptance once he was brought past the Security lobby and straight into an isolated Interrogation room. His anxious breaths had grown weak, and as he was brought in and seated rather roughly by the Head of Security, then buckled to the metallic chair with his tail pointing back, Steti became a bit limp. Well... most of him became limp.

The Security Officer was a terribly feminine-looking one, with semi-short fluffy hair and a flipped-up helmet, but both him and the suited-up Head of Security were clearly male, brimming with confidence. The Assistant stood a bit further away, biting his lip and eying the scene cautiously. Stetikekiak broke the silence at last. "...You arrest me, so now you question. I don't have things to say."

"Really?" The Head of Security raised his brow, stepping forth. His intimidating stature loomed over Steti like a brick wall. "Nothin' about how you got in here? Where your pals are?"

"Other birds left to make lone operative," the bird stated in a wavering voice. "I got... seen... very quick, by Assistant. Not very sneaky. I was just scout."

The gruff man nodded stiffly. "Mmm. And what in God's name is /this/?" He brought one of his gloved hands forth, clasping at Steti's bobbing, splattered cock within the latex suit. Instantly, there was reaction, a jittery moan from Steti and a clear pulse of precum from his covered member. His suit squeaked as he readjusted in the chair, legs spreading unconsciously as he tried to get further away.

Steti sputtered, "I-It is... was... I am... was just..."

"You're one-a those sick birds who just come to get their rocks off." The bird shook his head feverishly, but as the HoS leaned forward again, giving the somewhat tapered head of Stetikekiak's Vox dick a light rub, the reaction was clear-- he was needy beyond belief and his whole body, especially tail, started to shiver.

"A-Ah-- ...d-don't," he muttered in protest.

But the Head was not the least bit fooled. "Enjoying this, are we?"

Steti shook his head again, glass viewport fogging up again. "No!"

"Oh, I can tell you are, squeak bird." He chuckled deeply, and the Security Officer began to do the same, clasping his hips and guffawing at the trapped, trap-like Vox buckled into the chair, gently gyrating his hips in needy, unconscious desire. "My subordinate and I are gonna coax every detail out of you."

The next few minutes were absolutely unbearable. Steti felt his propped-up length contained within the latex, felt every little brush of air and brush of skin against it, bucking his hips up and down with desperation. The HoS and Officer seemed perfectly coordinated, and were watching him like a hawk, detecting when he was getting ever-closer to orgasm and denying it completely. Even rubs up against his legs or shoulders began to induce some intensely sexual vibes, all the while Steti continued to beg for it to stop. At some point, though, over the course of five minutes, his begs grew more vague... the Vox would simply creel a sputtery 'please' under his breath, approximating and straying further and further from Common with each moment. When the Officer began asking questions, he struggled not to respond.

"So you got the Assistant to fuck you so you could get free, right?" he asked, fingers lingering near Steti's tip.

"Y-Yes!" Steti responded, panting desperately. "That was... deal!"

The Officer gave him a little love tap, with a mix of pleasure and anguish in response. "Get free back to your /ship/?"

With a little hesitation that he immediately discarded, the Vox nodded again. "Docked... s-somewhere... cloaked. Will leave at first sign of trouble."

"Leaving you behind?"

"Y-Yes," he moaned softly. "If do not get free... leaving behind."

The Officer giggled a bit, leaning into it and continuing to toy gently with the Vox's dick, brows furrowed mischeviously. Within the contours of his red jumpsuit, Steti could spot him starting to sport a tent of a bulge, leaking some himself from the power-play. This didn't help the Vox's desire one bit, and he found himself jerking a bit against the chair, Still, all he got was gentle touch-- just enough to drain him and leave him utterly dazed, with no help to be found. The HoS came by again, and began to grip Steti by his neck, craning his head up and staring needles into him, letting the bird choke a bit. "Then I'm willing to bet they're leaving you behind, squeaky."

At the bird's lowest moment, filled with terror and arousal, a sudden piece of hope entered the room. The Assistant spoke up at last, approaching from his corner of the room. "Hey, y'know... I'm just some asshole, but the bird likes deals, right? Why not give him another one?"

"What?" The Head of Security snarled, turning back around to stand over the relatively powerless-looking Assistant. "He's got no rights. He doesn't get a deal."

"Yeah, but," the Assistant murmured, clearing his throat a little. "I made one, and I gotta say, he ain't all useless."

The Head furrowed his brow. "What are you proposing?"

He grinned. "If he can get all three of us off, in this room, without his hands, we let him run back to his shuttle." Steti and Officer turned to look at him, while the Head remained utterly incredulous. The Assistant elaborated. "Look, if he's as bad at getting out as he was at getting in, he probably won't do any more sneakin' around. And if he does get outta here, I doubt he's gonna last any longer on a second visit."

A few moments of silence hung in the air. The Head of Security turned around to face the buckled bird and aroused, lithe Officer, then back at the Assistant, who was now sporting a little erection of his own, newfound. He clenched his teeth a moment, then stood up straight, letting out a gruff sigh. "Alright. Fuck it. You heard the deal, bird. Start making these two chucklefucks happy-- I'm gonna get a drink first. Jesus." He immediately started to stomp out, muttering, "Goddamn sex fiends."

"Y-You've got it, boss!" the Officer announced, his voice suddenly filled with glee as the Head went to his office.

The Assistant approached slowly, breathing more easily now. Steti eyed him, and his viewport cleared a bit-- the bird was sobering up, at least for the moment. "Ey, don't thank me. Just trying to make a good trade, eh?"

Steti shuddered, tilting his head a bit. "...but am thankful, anyway."

He just shrugged in response, starting to take off his jumpsuit and peripherals for the second time, more casually this time. "Alright, what's it gonna be? Gonna have to be clever on this one, seein' as you're seated, and..." The Assistant found his voice slowly faltering as Steti made a move-- his matching slender and prehensile tail began to swivel to face him, poking out through the back of the chair and tightening and untightening. The message was clear, and the greyshit realized it rather quickly, his wide grin growing to a smile. "Gotcha." He slipped off the last of his things and brought himself to full mast, naked save for his socks and more aroused than even before.

The bird took a deep breath, steadying himself a bit. He was still debiliatingly horny, and he'd been edged nearly to oblivion, but the show of some good faith had given him confidence, buried in that lithe, feminine body. As the human maneuvered behind him in range of his dexterous tail, he tilted his head back to start positioning. Within only a few moments, he'd managed to start grasping at the Assistant's member, tail similarly slick and contained within the stealth suit. With a little help and encouragement, the Assistant managed to get Steti's tail fully wrapped around his dick-- and from there, it was a very easy process. He simply stepped a bit closer to put his hands on Stetikekiak's shoulders, clasping him tightly as he fucked the newly-formed 'hole' with gentle thrusts, and spoke between soft moans. "Sorry for... hhemh, rattin' ya out earlier. Hope this makes up for it."

"Some," Steti admits, then thinks on it a moment. "...plenty."

After finally having slipped off his clothes, the Security Officer cleared his throat to get the bird's attention. However, it seemed that he wasn't entirely... naked. The rather well-dressed Officer had a pair of pink stockings running up the length of his legs, terminating in garter belts attached to a pair of panties. His expression still demanded some respect, and his folded arms indicated he hadn't loosened up at all, but Steti couldn't help but be completely incredulous. He stared blankly at the Officer.

"What is it?" he asked, tapping one foot. "You're gonna judge /me/? I got /so/ much more going for me than you, shitbird. You're in no position to be a dick about this."

"This just odd," Steti quickly murmured.

The Officer tilted his head down a little, looking at the Vox's legs, then... further down. His gaze seemed sure, and he glanced back and forth between Steti's helmet and his talons, before finally the bird realized what he was indicating.

He shrugged softly in the chair, arms buckled to the back and tail jerking the Assistant off with fever. He supposed he'd just better get on with the weirdo's desire. With a raised brow of surprise and sudden eagerness, the Officer began to squat and then sit with his ass flat in front of Steti, pulling free his cute-looking dick from the pair of panties, and staring impatiently at his latex-clad talons. "You really want?" Steti asked.

"Not gonna get a better opportunity that doesn't get me clawed to bits," the Officer huffed, blushing slightly and glancing away. "...Might as well see what it's like."

"...well, okay," the bird murmured. With a bit more caution than he needed, he spread his legs, brushing up briefly against his own needy and throbbing erection, and brought them around to plant his feet on the Officer's groin, much to the human's... immediate, intense pleasure. It only took a little bit of awkward guiding to get his latex-clad talons wrapped around the Officer's dick, and the contours of the stealth suit made it surprisingly soft. Even any clumsiness didn't seem to matter to the Officer, though, who was practically drooling over the experience, legs folded and body jittering with every little movement. Stetikekiak barely had to get into it, legs gently gyrating as he nestled the human's sensitive length between two toe-talons at a time.

Behind him, his more familiar movements with his tail began to pay off. The Assistant was really resting against the bird's weight, now-- even though he weighed fifty pounds more than Steti, he was clearly being flattered with every little movement. The twisting and untwisting, pulling and unpulling, and dexterous squeezes of the tailjob were a sensory overload, and the bald human was panting desperately, pumping his hips forward with regimented, pre-generating thrusts. "You done this be-e-fore, bird?" He felt the soft latex covering on the tail form a perfect hole, and his tip began to grow feverishly sensitive.

"Yes," Steti said, then he scrambled in a deeply-aroused state to correct himself. "O-Only practiced! Never... thought would really... do. Did not come to do, that."

"Hey, if ya did..." He gyrated his hips forward, groaning as Stetikekiak's winding tail began to grope his balls. "...if ya did, I get it."

The bird just shrugged again, head tilting back. "Really didn't. Just am stupid enough to come and fail."

The Assistant grinned. "Haven't failed yet, eh-hh?"

"Failed at scouting." Steti panted a little, his contained dick wagging up and down with the combined talonjob and tailjob he was trying to keep track of.

"Not completely. I mean, you learned that our Security force is pretty much just..." He motioned towards the Officer, who was currently lost in some kind of trance, rubbing Stetikekiak's suit-covered legs and humming softly as his dick pumped out an avalanche of precum onto the latex-clad talons.

The Vox couldn't help but laugh weakly, glancing right back at his apparent savior. "Well, is something." With that, he turned up his movements some, no longer just massaging the Assistant's needy and wet member, but completely jerking him off, coiling his tail like a fleshlight and moving contrary to each thrust, turning up the pressure. The bald human wasn't going to last a minute longer, and sure enough, he clasped Steti's shoulders even more tightly as he clenched his teeth and began to shove his hips forward, pumping in and out. Orgasm came again, though slightly less pent-up this time, spewing a hefty load of ropey cum into the cock-trap that was Steti's tail and even splattering towards his asscheeks.

The Assistant continued panting for a while, a wide grin plastered on his face as he pulled away slowly and started to wipe off, nodding with approval towards the bird as he gathered his composure.

In front of Steti, the crossdressed Security Officer continued to do his odd little gyrations in place, eyes tilted up and head bowed down, sliding his palms along the bird's legs and moving with every little jerk of the talonjob. Once it was just him remaining, he leaned forward with neediness, craning his head down and butting his head against Steti's groin, while taking his hands off Steti's legs, letting the Vox take full control-- which he did, rather eagerly. The Officer's dick leaked while his jaw slid open and he began to lick gently at the bird's length contained within the latex, panting and moaning timidly while acting completely submissive.

He couldn't help himself, the bird. He decided to be a bit coy, especially for the earlier teasing. "You like, weirdo?"

"Nnhff," the Officer grunted, "...yes."

"Good."

Steti forced his legs down and up with pace, feet interlocking in a decisive jerking movement as he beckoned moan after moan out of the Officer. It was only another half-minute of breathy and desperate gyration until he finished at last, spewing cum in extremely pent-up droves, splattering over his half-naked self and the bird's latex-clad talon-toes. He continued spewing for a good while, groaning and shaking with his jaw hung open, until he collapsed back a bit, stunned. All the Officer could do was scoot along the ground until he was free, staring up at the bucklecuffed bird with a mix of admiration, disgust, gratitude, and shame. "Do not thank," Steti said.

The Officer nodded slowly and took a long breath. "Okay."

"Er, but you could thank if you wanted."

He started to wipe his panties and stomach off. "No, actually, you're a prisoner, so that was almost assault on an officer, so-- you're getting off easy."

Both the Officer and Assistant stepped forward, gathering themselves with glances of vague distrust towards one another, when both them and Steti turned suddenly to face the door as it swung open-- the Head of Security, looking significantly more frazzled, his coat torn off and jumpsuit discarded, while his hat, glasses and boots remained firmly on. He carried a half-empty bottle of whiskey, which he forked over to the Security Officer in an angry-looking motion. "Take it, you jagoff." 

"...yessir!" The Officer gently tucked his half-hard, cum-splattered dick back into his panties as he stood at attention, took the whiskey bottle from the Head, and struggled to try and keep his composure, blushing a deep red throughout.

Steti retracted a little in the chair as the Head of Security stomped forward, but had no defense as the bulky man stood over him, unbuckled him, and brought him up to a stood position, throbbing dick sitting mere inches from the Head's own protruding member. "You better have a hole to fuck, squeaky." He clapped his hands, and the ceiling unfurled a bit, revealing some kind of... winch mechanism.

The Vox tilted his head a little, sucking in air. "...well, y-yes, but suit has no open."

"Eh." The Head of Security grunted, and his fairly lengthy cock bobbed up and down with him. "I'll figure it out." He clasped both of his hands around the Vox in a brief and rough embrace, and took the metallic cuffs off-- only to lift Steti's hands back up over his head and begin tying them to the lightweight winch on the ceiling. Suddenly he felt himself suspended slightly, only able to stand on the tips of his wet toe-talons, hung a bit like a pig. The HoS circled slowly around him, stepping with a bit of drunken clumsiness, and the nearly-naked Assistant and Security Officer both gave Stetikekiak a brief look of sympathy. 

As the Head came around the bird's back, Steti lifted up his tail, suddenly coiling it a bit around his new assailant, even holding him by his shoulder some, trying to estabilish some bit of dominance. The swaying, heavy-breathing human responded by gently groping Stetikekiak's ass a moment, then starting to press forward, his dick aching for some kind of contact. Before he reached it, though, he murmured quietly, "You cum any earlier than me, it's a year in Perma. Got it?"

"G-Got," Steti stuttered. He glanced over to the Security Officer who'd been teasing him for the last half-hour, and the man just glanced away a bit in shame, trying to hide his still-persistent erection in undersized lingerie.

This was gonna be a tough one. The only way the Vox surmised he was gonna get through it was with a whole heap of self-control and some absolutely thunderous thighs.

He felt himself lowered a bit into the HoS's weight, and the human immediately began grinding and groaning-- his leaky cock-head slipped suddenly against Steti's latex-clad, ridiculously soft asscheeks, grinding between them and poking against the base of the bird's dick with every little gyration. He bit down and started slipping his dick up and down, hot-dogging with drunken fever, feeling his tip slip right up against Steti's covered, puckered asshole and back. The base of his tail retracted down a bit, making the contours of the suit into a slick, wetted hole, which he started to feed off of with every thrust, bouncing on his feet and grunting. The grunting, in particular, sounded both fervently horny and deeply angry.

Stetikekiak was having... a moment. His mind was being utterly flooded with feel-good chems, and every movement made him pant and squeal under his breath like a chicken, fogging up his helmet once more. Everything in him told him to seek sweet release, but he relented, trying to breathe easy as both of the other humans watched in awe and arousal.

The Head of Security continued pressing himself into it. "S-Such a... shitbird," he moaned deeply, "coming to /my/ brig, trying to make s-some fucking plea deal..." His movements got more sluggish and heavy, and Steti felt his whole body rocked into the thrusts of each movement, hole teased and dick frotted as the man stuck his business anywhere warm and cozy. He couldn't find a hole, so he kept slipping back and forth against cheeks, soft latex acting as a lane, continuing to get more lubed-up with every movement. The bird's tight, supple figure was approachable in so many ways, and the Head of Security found himself nearly pounding at the base of his tail.

Eventually, it became too much to handle, for the both of them. The human groaned and nearly lost his balance, clinging to the suspended Vox for support as he reached climax. His thick dick was slotted between two squishy asscheeks and a massaging, buzzing tail, and his tip began spurting out sloppy, white cum like a fountain. He nearly exploded with released pressure as he started painting Steti's underside in a solid coat of seed, frotting against him and letting out air.

Steti found himself with the chance for true relief, and he took it before his brain even knew. Cum boiled up in his internal balls and began flooding out of the overworked tip of his dick as he swung his beak open, crying out loudly in pleasure and a bit of pain, finally allowed to finish. Sperm dripped in oozing beads from the end of his latex covering, as the suit simply wasn't capable of containing it, and his already-wet stealth suit was suddenly drenched in the groin area, splattered and dripping wet with ropey cream. Stings of white goo hung from his engorged member.

Him and the Head of Security suddenly clung to each other's weight and warmth as their shared cum began to pool on the floor, loads finally blown, needs finally handled.

The moment lasted for what felt like an eternity, but finally the HoS reached a shaky arm up, undoing Steti's binds, and letting the Vox topple to the floor, almost too drained to properly stop his fall. He landed down softly, tail wagging gently in afterglow as he pressed his hands on the floor, struggling to stand up. The Assistant was there in moments, offering Steti a hand of help, which he accepted with a breathy, thankful... satisfied laugh.

"Please tell if... was... good enough?" he stammered, glancing back, panting a bit as he gently fondled his fading erection in the latex suit.

The Head of Security had sat down in the chair, staring off a bit as the last few bits of cum drooled from his tip. He tilted his Security HUD glasses down a moment to glare at the bird, then squinted. "...Are you goddamn stupid? Of course it was. Fuck." He let out a long breath, and Steti began to as well, but noticed a familiar sight on the man's face-- one of sudden realization. He lifted a hand to point at the window out of Interrogation, and all four sex-exhausted men turned to face it.

Not far from the station, a space ship floated, wearing camouflage and humming softly with blue engines. Within a few seconds, it'd begun jetting away.

"Looks like your ride's gone," the Head of Security said, chuckling weakly.

Steti stared in abject horror, but before he could say another word, words in Pidgin began to flood in through his headset-- the headset he'd forgotten amidst his moans and seduction.

"Ey, apologies for the quiet earlier! We had to mute the mics-- we were laughing our ASSES off!"

"Yeah, yeah-- haha, haha, wow! You didn't even CHECK the chameleon projector to see we'd sabotaged it?"

"Be happy, cousin! We all knew this was what you'd always wanted!"

"Call it a favor. You've always /wanted/ to be under Nanotrasen's thumb."

"We're bettin' you don't have a choice!"

"KREEHAHAHA!"

"SKREEEEE!"

"CRAAWWW!"

He slowly tilted his head back down, wordless for a few moments. He glanced back around to the other humans in the room-- weird fucks, sure, but at some level, maybe this was the best future he'd get. Steti supposed he was never even half-competent as a Raider, and it seemed that his 'friends' had known the same since the start. That'd certainly explain a lot of things.

Steti threw his arms up in the universal sign of 'fuck it', and backed up slowly towards the pushed-away interrogation table, sitting on it a moment for some balance. The Assistant glanced at him with a degree of genuine sympathy, but the bird waved it away and laughed softly. "Never was thing I did good anyways."

"Aren't those shitbirds your ride out?" the Security Officer asked, head tilted. "We're certainly not giving you one of /our/ pods back."

"Eh," Steti murmured, glancing one last time at the window where the skipjack descended into space, far off, until it wasn't much but a dot in the distance. "I'll figure out."
