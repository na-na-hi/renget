>What if Ame helps you shed
>You are sick from fever in bed. This always happens when you start shedding
>What sucks even more is that you can't even see that well as your outer eyelids had hardened and turned opaque.
>"Is my lovely investigator feeling any better?" It's Ame's voice.
>Even though the old skin dulls your sense of touch, you can still feel the Ame's hand on your chest.
>Heck, you could even sense the her fingertips running through the rough texture: wherever they touch seems to spark a little tingling sensation you seldom feel otherwise.
>Constriction of the shed prevented you from even breathing heavily, less so speaking, so all you could let out is a weak moan.
>"It never takes this long huh~ Want some help?"
>You feel Ame's arms on your neck, and before you could react, the few small openings on your lips that you have been relying on to mouth-breath are blocked by Ame's lips
>Ame pushes herself against you, and gently nibbles at the thin shell covering your mouth
>Your body froze, not just from the not-so-great range of motion of joints during shedding, but also from the mixed feeling of exhaustion, arousal, and happiness clashing into the instinctive fear and subordination that triggers in situations like this.
>Finally, you start to feel Ame's tongue stuffing through and touching your teeth.
>"Alright, this might hurt a little~"
>Instead of the gentle gnawing, Ame now bites firmly into the shed that is starting to come off and starts peeling it away.
>She did it swiftly and without hesitation.
>Before your freshly exposed lip could feel any pain, Ame spit out the shed and again covered your mouth with hers.
>That slippery warmth is the very first thing your skin is able to feel in days, and you just want to indulge in it as long as it lasts
