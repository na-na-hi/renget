Smutty changeling tail 3/3 unformatted

You smile, finger the camera you've got tucked away in a strappy little handbag you've got slung across your dynamite body and stand up.

You saunter through the moaning and desperate crowd who are slowly beginning to disperse. You even catch sight of the punky girl who got transformed by Daybreaker looking around, dazed her new, bright red hair glowing softly as she stands on shaky legs, hugging Daybreaker's dress to her chest possessively and breathing in the scent of the towering, fiery haired woman.

It doesn't take long to find out where they went, there's a small breakroom that's slightly ajar, the pull of Flash's magic guiding you as you hear grunting and sighing coming from behind the door. You see movement in the corner of the room, shadows dancing on the wall and unsling the camera, selecting [BULLY] and then as a lark, selecting the "MULTIFLASH" function.

The thought of turning the nice, guileless guy into a perfect, mean stud for Sunset really heats you up and you throw caution to the wind and push the door open a little wider, camera raised, magic charging around it and sight Flash, expecting to maybe catch Honourheart in the frame as the slutty little bug sucks his big dick.

Which is why it's surprising to see Flash, sitting on a coach, fully clothed and staring at the door while making suggestive moaning sounds into his hand.

His eyes meeting yours and the flicking to the side is the only warning you get before Honourheart flings the door open, bashing the camera out of your hand and almost garrotting you with the strap as you stagger back.

You swiftly gather your vast magic reserves, gather in what you had left after Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon and began to-

Honourheart punches you in the face.

Hard.

No banter, No hesitation.

You feel your nose crunch as her small but powerful fist impacts.

Your legs turn to jelly and your head smacks heavily on the wall behind you as stars dance in your vision. 

Your magic cuts out as  concussed sparks rocks your mind, you try to stand but your legs don't seem to be working and-

Honourheart drives her foot into your stomach and the wind is blown out of you in a wheezing whoop as she grabs you by the collar and spins you around, shoving you against the wall and drawing a black and green band from her inside her jacket-

'No-' You manage to gasp out before it locks around your neck and you feel your magic go dark, cut off by the null band and the squeak in pain as Honourheart *yanks* your arms hard behind your back painfully and *click,click* another set of bands, this time hard iron snap around your wrists.

'Magus Gossamer Wing, You are under arrest on the authority of King Thorax of the Free Hives for the crimes of sedition, Illegal Mental Coercion through magical means and unauthorised physical alterations by Magical Means. You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you fail to mention somthing you later rely on infront of a High Tribunal. Do you understand your rights as I have just read them to you?'

You whine, salvia and blood leaking down your lips and jaw as she presses you into the wall.

'Good enough.' She grunts and drags your forcibly towards the firedoor at the end of the hall.

'Flash, get the car.'

 You hear Flash hurry to keep up and crane your neck to look at him and catch sight of a worried and frightened face before Honourheart twists your head forward,
'Eyes front. Don't look at him.' She says, voice professional and clipped, her smaller form forces you to hunch slighty, adding to the discomfort as she shoves you through the firedoor and into the cold night air.

This wasn't supposed to how it went!  You couldn't get *arrested!* This wasn't how the game was played!

'How did you know?' Flash asked,

'That she would come?' She says, the grimace in her voice, 'Same reason I made a show of feeling you up. Changelings-' She says, the lip curl blatant in her disgusted voice,

'Never fail to exploit a weakness. Never miss a chance to kick someone when they're down. Never take any less than you can *squeeze* out of someone.'

She punctuates this with a tight shove that causes the painful knot in your back to cry out again.

'Is this necessary?' Flash's voice sounded somewhere behind you along with the jangle of keys, his voice scared,

'Yes.' Honourheart says tersely and then you hear her sigh, her voice softening, 'I'm sorry Flash but you've seen how dangerous she is. In three days she's turned Princess-Principal Celesta and Luna from the absolute *best* of us into...*that.*' Her grip tightens hard on your arm and you splutter painfully as the hold grows tighter,

'I'm not going to waste time, days or weeks pretending to be a student, trying to win a crown or a gala or a battle of the bands or some shit so we can all learn a lesson in friendship while this *monster* ruins the school.'

She breaths out, breath fogging and it's silent as he unlocks the car and Honourheart strips you. She's thorough as well and not gentle either, snatching your [phone], [the camera] and [the shorts.]

'I will not.'

There's another pause, 'I am sorry about the blueballs though. Any other time I'd be delighted to follow up but maybe later?

The joviality is forced as is Flash's quick, nervous laugh 
'Yeah, Yeah, I get it, There's a time and a place-'

'and why ever not right here and right now?' A familair voice purrs out and you feel Honourheart *tense* behind you.

You look up through teary eyes and see Starveheart walking across the lot towards you.

A younger Starveheart. She's...*perky* in every sense of the word. Her long legs are clad in a pair of pink jean shorts, her pert butt and slim thighs not disturbed by the cold night air although her nipples are diamond points as they drill through a tight baby blue shirt, three cartoon parasprites dance on the front as it clings to her small boobs. Her hair is still matte grey but now has a soft pink strip running through it and her lips are glossy as she sucks on the end of the pink pen.

'Hello Honour-It's been a minute! You've caught yourself a worm!'

On either side of the small evil changeling,  Sweetie Belle and Thunderlane step into the light.

Thunderlane looms, his already athletic frame enhanced, his upper chest *rippling* with muscle, the collar around his thick neck straining as he rolls his shoulders and glares at Flash who gulps but to his credit stands his ground. He too doesn't seem to be bothered by the chill air, wearing only shorts, his massive cock hanging out of one leg hole.

Sweetie Belle's changes are *extensive* as she grins at you with a hungry sneer. She's taller, taller than Rarity now and even taller for her heels. Her perfect hourglass figure, huge heaving tits, a tight, taut waist and massive hips and a pavement shaking ass is perfectly proportioned, her pale skin clear of all blemish.

She's wearing a tight purple dress that extends down to her knees, the sleeves going down to her hands. On it's own it wouldn't be promiscuous in the least but several artfully and carefully placed circles of various sizes are missing from the material, showing glimpses, tantalising hints of the luscious body underneath.

Her two tone hair is *beautifully* made up Her grin eyes glitter in the dim light as she stares down at you.

'You've saved me the problem of digging her up myself!'

Honourheart grits her teeth and glances over at Flash, giving him a look you can't make out before speaking in a clear voice,

'We're not doing this right now Starve...'

'Why not?' The young Starveheart bubbles, advancing while her two sexy goons split, surround the car and the three of you,

'You can wait. It's better for both of us if Wing's out the way first then we can settle this.'

'Oh but I just "can't" wait ' Starveheart whines, her eyes wide and intense as she sucks on the glowing pink pen again, her hand sliding into her shorts as she looks wantonly at her sister,

'Starve-What the hell are you doing?' Honour says, recoiling at her formerly stern and upright sister's actions as she fingers herself infront of her Sister during a major sting.

 'I've been thinking about you *a lot* Honour...Late at night, early in the morning...Whenever I have a spare few minutes and Sweetie's tongue is free~' She giggles drunkenly, the pen throbbing in her mouth as she moans around it.

'Hive~She's mad-' You moan as you look at her properly. She's twitching and writhing, unable to sit still, her shorts are soaked and the smell of her arousal slams into you as she walks closer. 

You missed it before because of the band around your neck and the fact she doesn't *look* like a bimbo, merely a bubbly senior at the local school but she is *streaming* with magic, gulping it down as she sucks on the pen which crackles with magic.

But she should have tits three times the size of her head!

Then you remember she's the hives best infiltrator. Her discipline was legendary. She never broke character. 

You only managed to make her younger by slipping the spell beneath her notice but all the other stuff that should have caused her to be a figure 8 in changeling form she was actively resisting.

The magic didn't fade though. Not while she still held the pen so it simply built up inside her, pressing into her indomitable will and decades of intense training.

But she's cracking.

Oh Hive, Luna and Celestia was she cracking.

Pink flames burst into place on her body before extinguishing, her clothing singed and straining as she would start growing or shifting only to tamp down, pulling back on herself and her tongue lolled out, a needful moan bursting out as the Lust Trap modified pen dumped pure bimbo into her. 

Hive alive, she's *edging* the bimbo magic! Does she even *know* what she's doing? It may not have effected her body yet but it's sure as hell addled her mind.

Her eyes briefly changed to the slitted ones of a  highborn but instead of green the were bright, glowing pink and her voice was pleading as she spoke,

'I-I want us to be closer Honour-So close~I wasn't the best sister but I can be now!' She breaths in, smelling sharply, 'I smell the love for me on you Honour~ I know it's there-I always thought it was a weakness but~' Starveheart presses her thighs together, fingers working furiously  'We could be so *close* Honour-W-We could learn about "friendship" together-' She continuies ranting, hips bucking now as she stares at her sister with such *intense* want that Honourheart's grip on you loosens as she recoils

'What the fuck-' Honourheart breathes, barely audible, meant for herself more than anything,

'The pen.' You say, spitting out blood from your busted nose, 

'It's the pen-She used it and it's used her.'

You twist to look at her and see the camera, your phone and the shorts tucked under her arm as she looks at you and then turns to look at Flash who has one hand on the handle of his door, squaring off against an approaching Thunderlane.

Starveheart arches her back as a full body orgasm begins to bloom from between her legs,

A drop of rain hits the floor infront of you, the first of many fat drops as it begins to rain hard.

Everyone makes their move.

Everything happens at once.

A) Make a break, You are no longer the priority in this situation. You think you can grab *one* item from Honourheart before ducking under Sweetie Belle and running clear. 
A1) Your phone. Not massively important on it's own but it's got all your correspondence on it. Your aura of normality has shrouded a lot of things from Honourheart but if she cracks that she'll know who you've effected and who you've tampered with. Sunset would be outed as your accomplice, as would Fluttershy
A2) The camera. Probably the most valuable item you've acquired so far. 
A3) The shorts. 

B) Stick with Honourheart and Flash. You're in pain and soaking through and you really don't want to have to spend all night running from Yandere'ling and her servants.

C) Side with Starveheart, You better have good fucking argument.

D) Other?

[Sorry, this is a bit heavier than previous. Won't stay like this I just needed to set Honourheart up as a credible threat who isn't going to fuck around after being MIA for the story thus far and Starveheart kind of just bloomed out after I thought I what would happen if  she was carrying around a potent magical item she had overclocked to busto level]

[Locked in B]

For less than a heartbeat you lock eyes with Honourheart and you share a desperate look then a grim one.

She lets you go and you dash forward just as Sweetie Belle lunges from the side.

Starveheart makes a crazed noise that is both dissapointed beyond measure and gleefull beyond reasoning at his sister's resistance. Starveheart leaps past you, cackling madly, fists and hands a blur as she meets Honourheart.

Flash who had been looking to square up with the buff Thunderlane, decides discretion is the better part of valour and in one smooth motion, opens the car door, slides inside and shuts it again, clicking the lock shut for good measure. 

Thunderlane looks baffled for a moment and then his face twists in rage and he advances on the car. Flash flips him the bird until Thunderlane's fist cracks the driver side window and Flash revaluates, staring the engine,

'Fuck!'

Leaving you with Sweetie Belle

You're a hot and sexy mage,  You're not a melee fighter and you literally have both your hands tied behind your back and your face hurts.

Sweetie Belle is a hot and sexy student, She is also not a melee fighter and her new big boobied body is not exactly built for balance *and* she's in very tall heels.

You suspect that she's going to need a fair amount of magic to scrap wearing those things.

So while the other four are having a life and death struggle, your fight with Sweetie bell . She squeals and hits you with what you later reflect was probably s a rather limpwristed blow given how she cries out in pain and clutches her wrist after the fact.

However, You've not really been in a proper fight before either and the blow sets off some primal thing in your mind and you panic and go bugwild.

You end charging, almost bent double in a waddling, off balance, no armed trot and headbutt Sweetie Belle's rather large rack. You experience a brief blissful moment of being engulfed in between two fat warm globes of happiness before Sweetie Belle topples back and lands on her ass.

Hey you won!

Honourheart grabs you by the back of the neck and throws you bodily into the back of car and you land awkwardly on the back two seats as Honourheart boots her sister away and slings the passenger side seat back and slides in, slamming the door shut.

'Fly.' She says and Flash guns the engine and you peel out of the parking lot in a blaze of burned rubber. After a tense moment, the three of you at the same time let out a sigh of relief, the rain smashing down on the windscreen, the wipers and the engine the only sound for several moments.

Honourheart turns around in her seat and glares at you,

'Okay. Explain. Everything. I need to know how my sister became whatever the hell that was.'

'Also what happened with the Principals.' Flash adds before swearing as he realises he's just done a good third of the Canterlot ringroad in the pitchblack with no headlights on.

You're actually to tired to disassemble or bullshit so you tell them what you know,

[This is more a Meta question here in how we want to approach Honourheart as by diving in the car with her we've kinda allied ourselves. What I need to know is this a marriage of convenience and we're hoping to go back stabby at some point or do we want this evolve into True Freindship'TM?

A) Fuck her, this town is yours and she and her sister will be yours in time as well.
B) You *may* have got in over your head here but all you did was make a bunch of people sexy, and horny, and two of them are quote unquote *evil* now but they're super hot and probably still good Principals!

[Locked in A with two votes]

You smirk inwardly, resting your head against the leather interior of the car and wipe your face as best as you can on your shoulder.

'I told you, It's the Pen. That pen she was sucking on like a prize cock? It let's her bind people to her using contracts. But it's enchanted with a new type of magic. One I've never seen before and it's *changing* her.'

'She didn't look that much different than when I last saw her. Shouldn't she have revealed her "final" form and grown batwings and starting shooting fire?' Flash queries and both you and Honourheart shoot him a look, 

'Changeling, Flash We change, it's in the name. She's covering whatever's happened to her ' Honourheart says and with a puff flame changes her mohawk to a bright pixie cut, almost causing Flash to crash the car in shock.

'He has a point though. This magic is *specifically* focused on physical changes as much as mental ones. *I've* noticed changes that I can't hold in, these things-' You shake your large chest theatrically, hoping to cut another rise out of Flash, '-are about as small as I can make them without causing problems. My real ones are *much* larger~' You say and grin at Flash in the rearview mirror and you're dissapointed that you only get a small swerve for that one...

'But Starveheart-'

'Starveheart's been holding it in, Hive knows why, Personal pride maybe, you of all people know how much of a stuck up prig she is.'

'She was...' Honourheart says, her tone unreadable and you shrug, carrying on,

'Yeah. But she's *boosted* that  pen to all hell and it's *pouring* magic into her. She *should* have changed and because she isn't it's melting her brain out her quim-'

'Where did this magic come from? Who gave her the pen?'

'That...I don't know, I've been trying to track her down myself. No one can remember quite what she looks like other than she's a *she* and she's hot as all hell. Those other widgets you got there-' You nod towards the shorts and the camera, 'They're her's as well. She's doling them out like Candy to random people and the stuff *catches* like a badland's flashfire.'

Honourheart who had been inspecting the camera lets it go quickly.

You're really tired and you're probably giving away more than you should but you really don't think you're going to be able to bullshit well enough in you're current condition and you don't really want to get hit again.

You also have to resist the urge to smile like an idiot when you see that at a traffic light, Flash has updated Sunset on the situation, as long as where you're going...

They're not going to throw you back through the mirror until they have everything they can get from you and the longer you keep them talker the longer Sunset has to rescue you.

'And the Principals? That was *you* I saw you!' Flash said, pulling up the statue outside the school,

You shrug and grin ruefully, 'I guess...I mean, if we want the real truth, The two of them did it along with every man and woman in that club, they chose what they wanted to choose and I just supplied the magic...'

'Bull, How do we change them back? Make them right again?'

 'You don't "Daybreaker" and "Nightmare Moon" *want* to be that. It feels right to them. Come on Flash, Day in and Day out dealing with Canterlot High, not just the snotty, shitty students but all the magical shit that flies out of that mirror? I can't blame them for cutting loose.'

You do grin this time, feeling a familair tingle in your boobs that you've never felt before but instinctively *know* what it means.
 
'Don't worry though, I'll keep them on the straight and narrow!'

'You're wrong! You're going away and Sunset will know what to do!'

'Oh, I'm sure~'

'Shut it Wing, Flash's right, You're little vacay in sunny Canterlot is over.' She drags you out of the car and you coo as the cold air once again hits you but this time, it tingles over you sensetive skin as you feel your *closest* subject "Flutter" above you.

Flash doesn't hear it but Honourheart sees your smug expression and recognises you have another card up your sleeve, even if she doesn't know it's an ace.

Then she makes a mistake. She grabs you by the throat and at the same time, looks up to see a black, buxom leathery winged changeling hovering above the three of you, teal blue eyes glaring.

Honourheart tries to shove Flash and you back into the car at the same time as Fluttershy dives and you swiftly and cleanly sink your fangs into her wrist and she curses.

Normal changeling venom wouldn't effect her, being a changeling herself.

But you're *isn't* normal and Honourheart frowns at the thick pink substance oozing around her forearm and then-

'Ooooh Ffffuck!' She moans, her legs going wobblily as your lust filled venom blazes through her. She misteps, expecting Fluttershy to go for her but you're not here for a fight.

Just a ride.

Fluttershy's arms wrap around you and you're glad she's swapped her bug wings out for batwings as with one strong flap of the broad leathery wings you're soaring through the sky, Fluttershy's big tits and hard nipples pressing into your aching back as you, against all reason and odds, you begin to nod off.


[Where are you spending the night?

A) Daybreaker and Nightmare's?
B) Fluttershy's
C) Lightning and Rainbow. Not sure how you're going to explain this one.
D) Harshwhinny, Included for completeness. I assume Fluttershy just leaves you at the door and dashes or drops you through a skylight or somthing.
E) Other

(Last one for tonight so not a hugely important decision.)

[Mana restored 9/9]
Camera lost

Phone lost

You wake up the next day resting on somthing that is both soft and firm at the same time. It's also warm and appears to moving in slow regular moments. You crack your eyes and turn slightly but a pair of large hands push you back down and you moan as your head sinks between Gilda's huge tits, your body writhing on top of her massive form, her firm, shredded abs performing very well as a bed. In fact, your back has never felt better-

Oh wait no, there's all the aches and pains of the night smashing back into you like the firm bitchslap of a vengeful goddess.

You moan in discomfort and Gilda sniffs, 'It's not great for me either. As much as I now love being "really big" spoon, we didn't manage to wash you last night so you're not exactly fuggin fragrant you know?'

You moan again then sigh as Gilda  easily stands up, Fluttershy's small bed buckling slighty as the amazon leaves it then ducks under the door, carrying you in her beefy arms as easily as if you were a ragdoll.

Sunset is waiting outside, beams and opens her mouth to say somthing but Gilda twists and shoves her aside with her large ass, 'Move Slutset, Ms Wing needs a bath-'

Sunset recoils slightly, pressed into the wall by Gilda's rock solid ass her face twisting,

'Stop, Let me see her!'

'You don't give orders here firebush. Only Fluttershy-' You feel Gilda's breath hitch and her thumping heartrate increase as she mentions Fluttershy, '-and Fluttershy wants her washes and pampered-You're not needed for that.'

'Mmmph-Let her in-' You murmur quietly into Gilda's funbags, 'I need to know what's going on.'

Gilda grits her teeth then steps into the bathroom, ignoring Sunset's smug smirk as she brings you into a steamy and fragrant smelling bathroom where Treehugger is waiting, wearing only a two piece bikini top, familair looking cartoon leaves plastered across the tight white fabric and she gently stirs the bathwater with a long nailed finger, occasionally dropping petals, fragrant liquids and other mad and exciting looking things into the steaming tub.

She takes a gentle toke on an actual to god hookah, her eyes surprisingly sharp despite the haze you know must be fogging her mind,

'I've like, got the measurements down to like, the last millimetre brah. This bath should totally, like be the best thing you've ever felt-.' She breaths out a large billowing breath of pink vapour that hangs in the room and sends shivers up your spine even as you feel your limbs grow heavier.

'Oh Hive!' You mewl as Gilda lower's you into the bath.

It feels *amazing* your aches and pains sapped by the steaming water as whatever Tree has added to it seeps into your pores and reinvigorates you and you go boneless in the tingling water as Treehugger gently lifts your arms, her deft hands dancing over your body as she takes another drag from her hookah,

'You don't like...mind if I smoke right? It's my own, like special formula that I designed while Gilda was pounding my ass yesterday-It helps mull me over brah, otherwise I'd be fingering, like all the time yeah?'

You're too blissed out to even say anything as Tree washes your body and you hear Sunset's voice come from far away,

'Gossamer-Hey!' You look up to see Sunset attempt to step into the room and Gilda place a hand on her shoulder and gently but easily pull her back into the large, silver haired woman. Gilda loops her large thighs around Sunsets and locks them in place, pulling Sunset back between her tits,

'You can talk from here Sunset.'

Sunset squirms but all this seems to do is stimulate the naked Gilda who chuckles and takes the hookah from Tree and takes her own drag on it, sighing as she relaxes,

'This is really good shit Tree-It's like it calms me down but "revs" me up at the same time-'

'Mmm, I think when it like, wears off and flushes out your bloodstream or whatever you're going to jump the first person you see so like, stay near me okay?'

'Hah-Maybe Sunset can stay as well-She doesn't seem to want to go anywhere do you Sunset?' 

Sunset struggles against Gilda's immense strength before giving up and just glaring up at her before turning to you,
'Gossamer, I'm glad you're okay. Fluttershy's with Zephyr at the moment. She said she should be done soon but that was an hour ago-'

'She's just getting started then.' Gilda supplies helpfully, slowly grinding her pussy up and down Sunset's back and watching the firehaired woman squirm.

'Anyway, Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon made it back okay and have been blowing up my phone but we've hit a snag there. Honourheart got your phone and she's cracked it so she knows about me being on your side. I don't think she knows about Fluttershy though as she was in disguise last night-For fuck sake! That's it!'

Gilda has just pressed her nipple into Sunset's cheek while she was in midsentence and Sunset's eyes glow white, her hands crackling ass she wraps her hands around her back and *spanks* Gilda's ass hard.

Gilda lets out an explosive grunt of pleasure, the sharp sound of the spank like a thunderclap as Gilda squeals, her legs springing open and Sunset spins like a ballerina and slides her middle and ring finger straight into Gilda's pussy and does *somthing* magical enough that her fingers are briefly sillohette inside Gilda as she fires somthing off.

Gilda moans and Sunset easily pushes her back into the hallway where you lose sight of them but the sound of crashing and quick wet noises follow for an extended period of time while Treehugger finishes soaping you off,

'They need more "mellow pink bunny" she says, holding up the hookah and sucking on it again, shuddering in pleasure as she grabs a fluffy towel for you.

Right. You feel *amazing* but you still need a plan of attack. Tommorow is Monday and you can't help but feel that's when it's all going to kick off.

Starveheart is officially mad as a spoon and Honourheart is taking no shit so you're going to have to hit the ground running today.

You've lost all your cool trinkets, You'll have to try and find some more seeing as you have no idea where Honourheart is and Sunset tells you that Flash's house is deserted. However when Sunset hands you a new albiet shitty phone you *immediatly* get a text from someone, it's a photo albiet grainy due to the shittiness of your phone. It's a picture of a pair of *massive* tits in an purple bra. A series of coordinates have been sharpie'd onto the left breast while on the other is three letters [S.H.L] then a smiley face.

Seems legit.

It's actually not. You have *no* idea how this scary lady got the number for a phone that Sunset literally opened fresh from the packet infront of you and she even knows your stupid nickname for her. But you really want some more goodies!

A) Go check out the coordinates.
B) You could gather all your allies in once place and hash out some kind of game plan. Then again, this might be better left to later if you wanted to sway a few more people to your cause first.
C) You may not know where Starveheart is, but the thralls are easy to find. You wonder how the apple family is doing with Applebloom and Diamond Tiara under the same roof.
D) Lighting Dust+Rainbow Dash or Harshwhinny
E) Did Treehugger say she had *made* formulas? You remember boosting her to super brainy levels, maybe the smart stoner has somthing you can use.
F) Other?


[Locked in E then A]

You want to check out the coordinates but you're not going in half cocked. Treehugger has obviously been busy as you sit on the coach and watch Gilda and Sunset hatefuck on the kitchen counter, you quiz Treehugger as she rubs some heavenly oil or lotion into your calves and thighs causing your black, changeling skin to glisten.

'So you mentioned you'd made some things up?' You as Gilda pushes Sunset hard down on the kitchen counter, legs spreading to mount Sunset's face when she's engulfed in red gold magic and flipped upside down, her own face being shoved into Sunset's pussy.

'Oh yeah-'  Treehugger says, the two of you scooting over slighty as Gilda's foot clips the light and it rips itself off the ceiling and embeds in a wall as Gilda wraps her hands around Sunset and hauls her into her floating body, bending over wrapping her large thighs around Sunset's head as the two do a vertical 69 in the air, grinding against eachother vigorously.

''C'mon, I'll blow your mind brah~' She standing up and leading you into Fluttershy's garden, 'I've never seen anything like, like it man-Even before Sunset expanded my entire horizons and concept of hydroponics and how it reacts to arcane energy...Man it was like doing a fat hit but the huge boobs didn't go away at the end-' She says, groping her boobs as she saunters through the garden naked before getting to a small greenhouse nestled in amongst various animal homes.

You're impressed as she opens it, several high tech looking lights dim and brighten and the soft sound of automated watering sprays hiss along side automated timers on sleek looking waterproof tables, as you walk past floral scents bombard you as several healthy looking plants envelop you.

*Very* healthy infact. Some of the vines curl and reach out suggestivly as Treehugger brushes past them with her naked body, lurid red and purple blooms open and shut as if tasting the air as you go by.

'This set up is amazing!' You say, decorum lost as you gape at the regulated and smoothly running hydroponics system. If you had this kind of setup in the hive! 'Did you do all of this since yesterday?'

'Nah brah, This was a setup me and Fluttershy have been working on for a while although we've only been able to get the big stuff wired up when Gilda came along. She's like, totally a babe of many vocations y'know?'

They did all this without Treehugger being a genius?

'Yeah, now that I'm, like, a rocket scientist or whatever I'm thinking of overhauling the whole system for synergy and streamlining and stuff y'know? Aw yeah-Here we are!'

You reach the back of the greenhouse and several *beautiful* plants meet your gaze.

Although it's the kind of beauty that radiates a subtle sense of danger as well.

Or maybe it's because one, a thick white and brown with thick, pulsing tendrils is acutally *chained* down.

They all seem to have *started* as marijuana plants but they don't *smell* like the marijuana.  No these smell nice and floral, more like a bouquet than gange but the smell of Bimbo Magic hangs thick in the air, soft pink residue clinging to the glass panels of the greenhouse.

However they now look *much* different, most likely due to the fluid tanks above them that every thirty seconds spray a fine mist down onto them. 

Each tank is marked and as one sprays out, a familair aroma reaches your senses and you realise it's not water that's dripping onto the plants.

'You're watering weed plants with your cum?' You say incredulously,

'Yeah man, I noticed that are juices are like, still juiced-heh-then, when we were fucking blazed we wondered what would happen if Zephyr spunked over a weedplant-

'As you do...' You snark,

'Right? So yeah, right on-it worked-' She nods over to one of the weed plants, one slightly to big for the pot it's in which quivers in the breeze and seems to be *sweating* a clear substance that sets your pussy a quiver.

'This one's the bunny we were smoking before, it takes the edge of for a moment but when you crash you're fucking, like-super horny-' You hear a smash from the house and a long drawn on scream of pleasure 'Oh, I think they've crashed...' She carefully collects the clear substance in a small vial and hands it to you, 'This is the real, like, good stuff though-it like, super retains magic, I've been pumping it through the other plants and like, take a look dude:

She "introduces" you to the others

Treehugger: A soft green and blue plant, the actual stem is thick but the various "branches" are quite delicate, the leaves seem to glow softly pink while bright blue veins thread through the leaves. 

'Man, this is like-the uber weed, I feel really [Bubbly] but also like, *super focused* when I use it, I gave some of it to like, some of my friends and cross referenced it using like, a scientific method and they were like, notably smarter at the end? Also their titties grew and they shrunk, And also they got really horny.


GILDA:
The plant bucks and strains against several small but tough chains, several thick vines writhing and twisting as it shoots out silver and gold spores, it's large white leaves *fan* the spores around and as you grow closer, you swear you see veins pulsing in the shaft of the plant as it's roots strain out around it's pot.

'This is like-the opposite of mine I guess-' She deftly reaches out, dodging between vines and brushes her hand gently across the thick stem of the plant. The plant shudders violently and then relaxes, the leaves softly wrapping around her arm and massaging it gently as she rubs the stem gently,

'Yeah- Gilda's a big softy~' You hear another room shaking crash from the house and the plant twitches, 'Yeah, like they become super energetic and buff but also kind of mean. She turns and shows you several red marks across her ass, 'I gave some of this to one of my guys whose normally as chill as me and I guess he had a hidden spank fetish?' She shrugs, 'He was fucking *buff* at the end though and also really horny.'

She stops and carefully holds you back as you approach the last plant, donning a set of heavy gloves and a mask and grabs a large glass wand.

Fluttershy: This plant outwardly looks pleasant, with several bright, pale blossoms in various soft hues but closer inspection reveals several lurid pink thorns set against a deep black stem, obscured by the flowers. The thorns leak pink venom when Treehugger pokes them with a long, glass prod.

'Man, I thought I'd made a mistake or somthing but nah, this is Fluttershy's, makes people super docile and suggestable when the smoke it on it's own and the pink stuff makes them *really, really, really* horny and it takes ages to wear off. I have to wear a mask and gloves when we touch it. I accidently pricked my finger on it and it took Gilda and Zephyr to pull me off his big dick and then they had to fuck me all night until I went to sleep and check it out-' She turns and spreads her lips, showing her clit which is a deep, neon purple the same colour as the venom leaking out of the thorns, 'Man, it still hasn't gone normal and I've *so fucking horny* all the time now-' Her voice changes slighty at the end, growing hungrier and more urgent and the next look she throws at you sends warning bells in your head before she quickly sucks down some more calming vapour and her smiles becomes dreamy and bubbly once more.

'There was like, one more thing I guess-' She says, pulling out a  large beaker with a familair looking glowing green liquid in it. '

The Royal Milk that Sunset had collected from you when you were turning Fluttershy,

'So like-We thought about adding this stuff it the mix but Fluttershy was, like, worried that you want to decide? We could, like add it to any one of the mixes and I'd make that plant like..."super strong".

Sunset wanted to like, keep it for use with somthing else but, y'know, I was kind of wondering what would happen if we just dripped it over a normal plant and see what came out?'

A dangerous idea sprung to your mind and you grinned,
'What would happen if we spliced all the mixes together and *then* added my blessing?'

Treehugger actually looks scared at that, even as her thighs clamp together,
'I think that would be dangerous.' She says quickly, all fogginess gone as she imagines the unholy hybrid of her smarts, Gilda's strength, Zephyr's potency and the overwhelming lust that Fluttershy seems capable of now all supercharged by your power.

Ah well, choices and choices,

All plants give one dose a day and must be ingested or smoked

A)Boost Zephyr's - Plant gives a stronger version of HIMBO juice letting you stack [THREE] spells with no mana cost into it. Spells can stack. No boost is just one spell with no mana cost.
B)Boost Treehugger's - Enhanced effects of Bubbly and Brainy. Changes happen immediatly and you think about raiding the librabry for nerds and hotboxing them, if you can wrangle the bubbly bimbo's together you could create one hell of a think tank...
C) Boost Gilda's - Enhanced Strength and aggression and a massive boost in the need to fuck. Very susceptible to trance and gentle conditioning in the first few stages. Boosting this is self explanatory and simple. Just a *stronger* version of this. You could quite easily make a big, buff army with these things...
D) Boost Fluttershy's - Smoking makes people docile and suggestable. Free [MINOR] Trance followed by causes large increase in arousal [FREE INCREASE AROUSAL] Boosting this allows free [MAJOR TRANCE] and a massive permenant [INCREASE AROUSAL]. 
E) Create a whole new plant using your donation and boost that?
F) Mix them all together and make an ungoldy little shop of horrors nightmare plant. This is the Discord threshold and will probably do more harm than good. Would be cool though
G) Keep the jelly. Unboosted is strong enough and you get one from each plant anyway
H) Other?
[Locked in [D]]

You look at the small, soft looking plant marked Fluttershy with it's nice, safe looking leaves hiding sharp, lust infusing thorns and smile. 

'That one.' 

Treehugger nods and dons her heavy protective gear again as she carefully tilts the supercharged milk onto the plant. The effect is instantaneous as the plant seems to *suck* the milk deep into itself as it shakes. The softly coloured leaves grow deeper in colour, fantastic swirling patterns begin to dance around the leaves and remarkably you feel a slight pressure on your mind as if the *plant* is trying to trance you, the leaves with their mesmerizing patterns swaying hypnotically despite the lack of breeze as the plant grows larger, the roots overspilling into the [GILDA] & the [TREEHUGGER] pots and digging into their soil as well. 

The roots *pulse* and seem to begin sucking in their nutrients as well, the large Gilda plant and the wide, soft Treehugger plant begin to twitch and shake and the Fluttershy's leaves, already strobing softly gain the same, lightning blue veins as the Treehugger plant, the softly shifting lights *almost* begin to look like vague, eye catching shapes that catch your attention and hold it before you shake yourself free as the plant becomes beefier and thicker, now resembling a small tree or thick bush rather than a pot plant.

'Aw man~ Treehugger says, the voice muffled beneath her mask suprisngly placid as she *rapidly* shunts the other two plants away from the middle one, saving them from the rather *invasive* plant. 

You swallow, suddenly fearful as you see the leaves and flowers reach over to the [ZEPHYR] plant, tiny tendrils questing from the blossoms for that sweet, supercharged residue that is leaking out the himbo plant. You grab the Zephyr plant and haul the heavy pot away as the petals seem to slowly open and close at you, as if snapping.

You break eye contact from the alluring pattern and are suddenly glad you didn't mix any more together given that the Fluttershy plant got a *tiny* taste of the other two and has almost tripled in size and potency.

'Man~I had a shirt that looked just like this~' Treehugger said, pulling a set of welding goggles from somewhere and sliding them over her eyes as she pokes at the plant with the glass rod, the thorns seem to have *swelled* into fat, pulsing purple bubbles which *squirt* a small jet of purple juice when prodded.

Treehugger gathers some of it in a vial along with a snippings of the mesmerising leaves and gives them to you in a little baggy. She also takes cuttings from the other plants and a vial of the himbo residue from the Zephyr plant:

Acquired:
4A)The Mesmer- Incredibly Potent leaf that blazes the user in a [MAJOR TRANCE] state followed by a massive increase in libido.

4C)The Greedy Griffon - Brown leaf with white and gold flecks. Boost in energy, fitness and confidence/aggression

4D)Blue Brainy - Light green leaf with electric blue veins - Increases focus and intelligence as well as boob and ass size. 

4E)Buff Bunny Breeze - Thick leaf that seems to "sweat" a thick white residue - Increases calm and arousal. Can be enchanted with a spell for free.

You think all leaves might be able to be mixed into food or drink with a bit of effort if your target isn't a stoner.

You walk back in to find the house trashed, and a sheepish and horny Gilda and Sunset quietly tidying the place while avoiding eye contact apart from the occasional nervous glance.

Fluttershy sits on the sofa, legs crossed under her in her changeling form looking perfectly poised and smiling softly but you sense a certain *tension* in her bearing that coupled with Gilda and Sunset's shifty bearing implies she was none to happy when she discovered her house trashed and had "words" to say.

Kind, gentle words of course.

She probably didn't even raise her voice.

Her smile deepens as she sees you and stands up quickly beaming and you watch the other two sigh in relief as the tension eases, 

'Oh~My queen!' She stands and bobs over then does a weird half bow/curtsey/kneel, the curvy changeling unsure how to greet you before you pull her into a hug, running your hands down her smooth, black back and trailing your hands over her ample ass. 

'I'm so sorry I wasn't here to greet you when you awoke! I was busy making sure Zephyr was well cared for before he left to go on a run with Spitfire-You know what she's like, She'll have him fucking half the team, all those sporty, large chested nymphos in tight lycra, all clambering for his big poor dick with barely any rest at all!' She says sorrowfully, shaking her head, 'I tried to get him to stay so I could at least rub lotion into his cock but he said he was already late...'

You smile down at her reaching out to tickle the base of her wings and they flutter madly as she coos in shock,

'Ooh!' She sighs and melts into you, pressing her head against your rack and purring at the joy of your presence, she looks up, eyes wide and devoted and you stroke her soft hair.

You both give small start as Treehugger sucks on a bong next to you, sucking on the tip of it and exhaling a cloud of soft pink vapour,

'Oh! Good morning Treehugger, were you showing the Queen around the greenhouse?' Her voice is friendly and warm as she even returns the fistbump Treehugger offers but refuses the bong.

You're glad you kept her as she is rather than changing her into a more submissive or aggressive version. She's nice and personable and you have a feeling even Twilight Sparkle would struggle to dislike her.

'Yah-Oh, by they way we're gonna need more chains-'

'Oh goodness, For the Gilda? I've had some problems with the one in here as well.' She says it softly, her cute, onyx face smiling softly but you watch the large amazon behind her tense up, shooting a worried look at Sunset who just shrugs helplessly, a sympathetic look on her face.

'Nah man, we boosted your plant with the milk and it got pretty wild-' She takes another hit, eyes crossing slightly before she sighs out again, 'Yeah, it's kinda like, trying to hypnotise you'll water it or fuck it or whatever, I don't know, I'm gonna do more tests on it, I reckon it's molecular structure is all wacky as hell.' She blows smoke out, trembling as her pussy leaks slightly, 'Yeah, also maybe some tinted glass or uh-a reckon I could rig up a smart screen to filter out the hypno stuff so we can water it without fucking it.' She shrugs and sits down on the couch, looking around under the cushions before pulling out some potato chips.

Well this seems to be all in hand. You're off to meet the cause of all this madness, do you want to bring anybody a long?

A) Go alone. You don't know if you're going to spook whoever is there and you're fully charged now!
[Pick one or more]
B) Take Sunset
C) Take Fluttershy
D) Take Gilda/Treehugger
E)  Call Daybreaker and Nightmare moon
F) Fuck it, call Lighting and Rainbow. They're pretty ride or die anyway and they might stumble into a bimbofication pod or somthing?
G) Other?


[Locked in E]

After some time passes and everything is cleaned up, which you, much to Fluttershy's chagrin help out with.

You're going to be a Queen of the People!

You also order Sunset to get as blazed as she can on Greedy Griffon and Blue Brainy while Treehugger monitors. You want her smarter and stronger for Monday and she bites her lip, partly in arousal at the idea of the bimbofying smoke but also-

'I've um-I've never done it before...' She admits, a little abashed and nervous and Gilda guffaws, wide eyed and suprised. Gilda has got dressed in a pair of white jogging bottoms that she's commandeered from Fluttershy and the size difference means the normally baggy bottoms are pulled tight round her thighs and ass, riding up her firm carves. Her huge tits strain a hoodie, "Breezie Migration 2020" to it's breaking, the hem exposing her cobblestone abs.

'The big bad Sunset Shimmer has never done a bit of puff? Fuck me, even Fluttershy's more hardcore than you!'

'I was a model student for years! Princess Celestia would go *spare* if she found me with anything like that!'

'Maybe not~' You muse, finger to your chin, 'I've heard things-' You say musingly, wondering if any of the things that your version of the Princess has told you carries over to the Equestrian version.

'I try not to be "hardcore" I prefer to be soft and fluffy~' Fluttershy says looking embarressed as she slowly but firmly massages Gilda's thick thighs and the big woman sighs softly, leaning back, 'But it's okay Sunset, You're here with friends and we'll make sure it's as enjoyable as it should be!'

'Uh-Thanks Fluttershy, really I mean it...So, What do I do?'

Gilda leans over, deliberately and obnoxiously pushing her massive boob into the side of Sunset's head as she reaches for the bong and filling it from a small baggie in her pocket, grunting softly and smirking as Sunset softly shoves her fist into Gilda's boob.

'Right, first you fill the bowl, this is Griffon cut with Blue and a little somthing of my own-'

'What is it?' Treehugger asks, clip board out and glasses on, waiting to take notes,

'Well, you guys were all messing about with cumming into flower pots, I called some friends who owe me favours and got some extra nitrate fertiliser-'

'What?' Treehugger says, frowning, 'I thought you had to have a license for that-'

'Ah, Not with my friends, It uh...fell off the back of a truck~' She says, trailing off as Fluttershy gave her a look, 'Anyway, I did some experiments with growth compounds and density and-What? I can't do science stuff too?' Gilda exclaims as she catches everyone's suprised looks, 'Just cause Treehugger's got as much brains as tits doesn't mean she got the corner on science!'

'Oh Gilda! That's amazing!' Fluttershy says, hopping up and straddling Gilda's leg, hugging the beefy woman tightly, 'I'm so proud!'

'Yeah, you guys inspired me I guess, My original plan for the fertilizer was to make pipe bombs out of it and go night fishing with my old dumb friends-' She cuts off, coughing and continuies packing the bong,

'Wicked brah, So what did you learn?'

'Oh. I uh, got distracted-' She says, nudging Sunset, 'In the end I ended up making Sunset cum into a flowerpot so...yeah-*Inspired*' She holds a bright red and gold leaf between her fingers and it glows slightly with magic.

Sunset recoils, 'Wait, What's that going to do?'

Gilda shrugs, 'I dunno, I'm not a botanist or a fucking wizard so maybe it'll boost your magic-' She grins again, 'Or maybe it'll make you a good little pussy eater-Unf-'

She cuts off as Sunset digs her in the chest again, 

'So what are you going to call it?' Fluttershy asks, head cocked, to which Gilda grins her widest grin yet and turns to Sunset, shit eating grin in full force,

'Firebush.'

She giggles, almost spilling the bong as Sunset shoves her awkwardly, Sunset's small hands planted and sinking into a massive boob.

After that ruckus and a soft but *stern* word from Fluttershy, everyone get's settled down again as Gilda sparks up the bong,

'So here's what you do-Hold this just here, position your hand right and suck like this-'

Gilda takes a deep inhale, filling her broad chest and powerful lungs with the strong magical substance and soft blue and red smoke leaks out of her nose and mouth as she holds it in and tries to speak at the same time,

'Then-You hold it and do this-' She grips Sunset by the back of the head, running her fingers through the red and gold hair and turns her, pressing her own lips against Sunset's and exhaling, expelling as much magical smoke as her large lungs could hold.

Sunset gasps, eyes wide but doesn't choke, instead she groans, pressing her legs together and leaning into the passionate kiss. Her chest swells in her purple croptop as the magically charged smoke fills her lungs but then it keeps swelling even as they break the kiss.

Sunset looks absolutly dazed as she raises her hands to her growing chest and even Gilda looks a little punch drunk as her body flexes as if hitting a limit on how much more she can change.

'That felt...reallly good~' Sunset says dreamily as her large chest begins to spill out of her crop top and her flat stomach tenses and releases. She spreads her legs, still smiling drunkenly as she jerks, a small micro-orgasm running through her as her flexes stomach begins to partition itself into a firm muscles as a set of toned abs begin to rise against her smooth skin. Her hair rises slightly, small static bolts of red and orange magic arcing across as an astral outline of a pair of wings float into being behind her.

The sharp tang of magic is in the air as Sunset's power grows with her chest and height.

You smile and leave them too it, quickly phoning Daybreaker and Nightmare on your shitty burner phone. They're delighted to hear your voice and are almost beside themselves with regret and not being there to bail you out and so they practically *jump* at the chance to *redeem* themselves.

The last time you saw them they were naked and despite glowing, they were not in the best lighting. You almost soak your panties when the two of them meet you meet them by Whitetail in a twist of fate at where you and Luna had your heart to heart while Celestia did pull ups and eavesdropped. 

Daybreaker was wearing a pair of white slacks that *cling* to her large, long legs, a blouse and a matching white jacket combo that pulls *tight* against her midriff while her huge tanned chest *spills* out the deep plunging neckline. The jacket has gorgeous and detailed gold and orange embroidery and several gold bracelets, bands and even a large topaz ring cut in the shape of a sun and set with diamonds. The whole ensemble seemed *far* finer than anything Celestia would have worn and despite walking through the muddy track on huge, white heels , not a speck of mud or dirt seems to stick to her as she glides across the track, hips and booty swaying, her fiery hair trailing behind her in a billowing wave.

Nightmare's is somehow more sedate but just as eyecatching despite having gone for a more minimalist approach.

In that she's barely wearing anything.

Her pale, jacked legs are encased in a deep black and blue pair of walking shorts that might have been baggy once but now seem *painted* to her ass and flexing thighs. If that wasn't enough, underneath that she's wearing a black leotard which judging by her visible camel toe is hitched high into her box as it stretches tight around breasts before diving back down into the crack of her firm ass. The top if which, along with the upper portion of her mons is super visible due to how low she's wearing her shorts.

The leotard is *tight* as well, her nipples and each individual ab on her stomach is visible, her cut arms on display, her body softly glowing pure white *in defiance* of the golden rays of sunlight beating down on her. 

Both her softly sneering stoicism and Daybreaker's resting look of smug and gleeful superiority vanish as soon as they see you, replaced with concern, shame and worry before they cross the gap between you in several quick, long strides and you're suddenly crushed in a very *boob-filled* hug and if you didn't know any better you would have thought the two tall, busty amazons were trying to smother you as they held you in powerful arms.

You force them to let up by smacking them both on the ass and they both jump and look at you chagrined.

'We're so sorry-'
'We should have been there!'

The two both begin to babble, all haughtiness fading, replaced with deep shame and worry and that more than anything lets you forgive the two of them.

Having such powerful, sexy bitches grovelling makes you *incredibly* wet.

'It's fine-' You say, smiling at them and resting your hands of the small of their backs, 'I ordered you to have fun and *distract* yourselves. It's not your fault I got jumped and Fluttershy was more than accommodating so if you really want to make it up to me, then maybe you can *thank* Fluttershy properly after we investigate this.'

Fluttershy seemed to have a knack for handling big, needy sex machines and you *did* kinda want to see the small, slight cutie be *worshipped* by the two sister's, both of which were almost half again her height and built as all hell.  

Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon both seem enthralled with the idea and as you walk, you strike up a conversation about how they were "distracting" themselves after the stripping competition.

'I have a new assitant if we don't get Raven back!' Daybreaker says gleefully, eyes afire with lust and ambition, 'The cute Punk that held my dress, she's mine now.'

She shows you a photo on her phone, the girl's hair was now streaked with fiery reds and oranges, pink eyes now glowing golden and filled with adoration and her slim, pale body was now deeply tanned and noticeably buffer. You wonder it appeared that Daybreaker had a type and it was herself...

You're actually wondering how far she'd take it. With enough effort would Daybreaker just create a whole bunch of sexy mini-mes?

'I have two, although they're less assistants and more two guys I spent several hours last night teaching 
on how to properly worship my body.' She shows you a picture of two slim guys who were eagerly massaging, kissing and licking every inch of her pale body as she took a selfie, an unimpressed look on her flushed face as her long dark hair pulled the guys closer to her body and whoa mama-Those were not *natural* cocks.

It turns out Nightmare's type was delicate, pretty guys with massive schlongs and a subby streak. She had one cock in a long nailed hand, it's owner looking up at her impassive and regal face in desperation while the other was pressed into her huge, ivory tit, his mammoth dick hugged between her defined thighs.

'They were very good, especially once I got the knack of growing their dicks.' She closed her phone and stuffed it into her wobbling clevage, 'If the continuie to learn as they do in the next few nights and I will permit them release, for now they must spend every spare minute of their waking lives thinking of ways of improving and when they sleep, they dream deeply and vividly of me and only me.'

'Moony's *greeedy!*' Daybreaker giggles, nudging her sister who nudges back, laughing loudly,

'Says you slut!' She says and pinches Daybreaker's ass and you have to quickly refocus them on not wrestling it out on the forest floor.

You finally make it to an old abandoned shack in the middle of the woods, tucked into a hollow and approach carefully. In fact, your two companions go first and you realise that whatever freaky athletics and spec ops abilities Luna had has only been enhanced in Nightmare Moon and either Celestia had  similar past experiences  or the LINK has shared that over to her, the two move with *startling* ease in a covert and potentially hostile situation.

You actually lose sight of the two giant, sexy as all hell and *glowing* women before they pop back up several metres away from where you thought they should have been and swiftly wave you over.

You are once more glad you started with these two.

'Place is abandoned, We've also scanned for obvious traps and found this-' Nightmare Moon holds up a deactivated tripwire mechanism entwined with a pressurised cannister of roiling pink gas and you swallow.

'The make is professional and the materials high end but it wasn't hidden very well, We think either we're dealing with a very technical person whose not good at fieldcraft or it was meant to "deter" anyone not expecting it while being obvious enough for the likes of us to disarm it.' Daybreaker says, slowly pushing open the door and squinting inside as her glow filled the shack.

'Or both.' Moon shrugs, not having to squint to see inside the dark cabin and walking in carefully, casual but eyes scanning for more traps.

Those were some...interesting deductions that two school teachers have arrived at and you are once more *curious* about what these two did for a living before they became teachers...

Another time though.

[AQUIRED-BIMBO GAS - As said on the tin, literally, Bimbofies those that inhale it. You might be able to get Treehugger to reverse engineer it or just throw it into SugarCube Corner at rush hour.]

You walk in after your two guard bimbo's have cleared the way and found some lights to turn on.

The shiny and sleek interior vastly differs from the abandoned look of the shack outside. All the interior walls have been knocked down to make room for what a cross between a insane magus's study and a mad scientist's lab.

You've never seen human technology fused with Equestrian magic like this before. The heady aura of bimbo magic infuses everything. 

The whole place is *fascinating* but a few items stand out,

A pink bike helmet with a *bunch* of technical doodad's secured to it, lights and vacuum tubes and crystals all secured around a dial with 3 options on it: A bright smiley face with bright, poofy hair with a pair of massive boobs, A neutral face with massive boobs and an annoyed looking stoic face, also with massive boobs but with dark, muted hair colours.

An actual bimbofication pod. It can't be anything else. It's a huge vertical tube with a glass front and several large tubes arching around it. It doesn't appear to have anything more than a ON/OFF button but you guess finesse is not this things deal.

A set of rose gold hair sticks that appear to be almost purely magic in nature. They're a fairly simple design compared to the other stuff in here but the real interest is the small note beneath it with two different sets of handwriting on it.
'Teaching aid for Harshwhinny.'
'No good anymore, The cute changeling has got to HW'
'I mean, we can still give it to her or you know, anyone? It's not like HW *needs* to be the "sexy domme" teacher.'
'We should give them to Pinkie Pie.'
'Yes!'

Hmmm...Curious.

'Gossamer, Have a look at this.' Moon calls over to you and you walk towards the her and gasp as her light illuminates the wall. 

A huge corkboard dominates the wall, ribbons and string crisscrossing it in a dizzying array of colours and patterns. Several photos of Canterlot residents dot the board along with several notes beneath them,
[LIGHTNING DUST - FITNESS SHORTS - BESTOWED ON XX/XX/22 - LIMITED EFFECT(SHORTS GIVEN TO GOSSAMER WING(SEE 6A)

A green ribbon goes from Lightning to a picture of you.

In both forms. 

Fuck, wait, No...

They've got you in *every* stage of since you got here, from twiggy student to fit TA to busty Queen that you are now...

How?

You've got a *bunch* of lines heading off you to everyone you've transformed or used along with a list of changes you've made to them, Luna, Celestia, Lighting and Rainbow.

There's a small note beneath Sunset in one of the neat scripts you saw beneath the helmet,
'Do you care about this?'
'Why would I? She's a completly different person and Gossamer seems to have her on the right track anyway.'

They seem to tracking Honourheart and Starveheart as well and you're delighted to get a read on where the two of them are staying, even after Honourheart moved out of Flash's house. This was primo intel.

They seem to refer to you three as "wildcards" but you can't help but notice they've dedicated a *significant* and greater proportion to you, probably as you've been a one changeling wrecking ball of transformations.

-'How haven't we *met* this girl yet?'
-'I've been keeping to the outskirts, we agreed not to go near any of the big places like the school in case we get a friendship beam to the face, if she's not going to come search for us, we probably not going to meet and we're both operating on different bits of the town, it'd be easy for her to slip between out notice.
'-That's a shame. I wouldn't mind just unloading a bunch of my latest inventions on her and letting her go *wild* where we can't! She's perfect!'
'-Steady, She's made it clear she's pretty unscrupulous but you're right, we did underestimate her, I wish we'd given *her* the pen instead of Starveheart...'

There's a few more scribbles and excited notes, mostly regarding your changing of Fluttershy which they seem *very* interested in and then...

-'I've just had a thought, if there's a Gossamer Wing spat out on this side, is it possible we have one on *our* side?'
-'Shit. Yeah, Keep doing what you're doing, if *this* Gossamer is this much of a deviant bitch it would be just our luck to have a "good" version messing things on our side just as we turned out back.'

More scribbles and a few measurements of Beefy Gilda and then,

'Fuck, Yeah, She's on our side and she's already got to Celestia and Luna. Stop doing what you're doing and go back through now, I'll meet you on the other side, either burn it all or ping off a text to Gossamer. This experiment was fun but we've got to get rid of this slut before she undoes everything we've worked for back home.'

There's no more notes after that and you swallow, processing all of this before Daybreaker calls you over, a grim expression on her face as she points to the very back wall.

A huge mirror, surrounded by wires, tubes and glowing runes, multiple trashed control consoles surround it along with two huge magic infused capacitors. Although the tech is alien to you, the mirror isn't.

It's almost identical visually and in the *feel* of the magic to the one you crossed through to get here although it *is* different. This one looks newer, it doesn't *feel* old either and you're sure if you translated those runes, they would be directions to a dimension that *wasn't* Equestria.

Daybreaker nods to the central panel and you squint, not quite sure what you are looking at for a moment then you flinch,

'It appears to be some kind of prosthetic but much more advanced than I've ever seen.'

It's a robotic arm. Sleek and purple with a series of exploding starbursts etched down one side, the palm of it emanates a strong pink light and you see the casing of the forearm is open showing a container inset in the middle of it, the last few wisps of swirling pink magic contained inside of it.

Held gently in it's slender, hand is a burner phone that on close inspection reveals itself to be the one that sent you the coordinates and the boob shot. There's an unsent text on it.

'Dear Gossamer,
Too late!

Sorry we had to leave early before we got to meet you, have the shack and it's contents as a conciliation. You can keep the arm as well, It should jump your planet's general tech level a few hundred years at least.

Also S wanted you to have a booby shot of her as well so see that attached.

P.S. Please try and keep detailed notes of everything you do! We'll be back someday.

Love
SS & TS'

Huh.

You imagine that you could have most of this shifted out to either Fluttershy's or Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon's house but it's going to take most of the day. You would quite like Sunset and Treehugger to have a look at some of this stuff.

You could of course skive off and leave them to do all the figurative and literal heavy lifting and do somthing else, you know where Starveheart and Honourheart have gone to ground and you have acquired:
[STRANGE HELMET & MOMMY DOMMY HAIRSTICKS OF LEARNING]

You do have a vision of Pinkie Pie as a MILF but struggle to reconcile both having her hair actually *tamed* and her being *strict* in anyway, shape or form.

Compels you though...

All of this would also help take your mind of the *worrying* implications of what you've learned in this shack though,

You look into the mirror and think you see, just for a moment, a colourful and wide eyed changeling, smiling joyfully in naïve and trusting wonder and you look away quickly at the gateway to the Mirrorverse.

A) Stick with the gang, you might dig up more stuff if you're here when they're shifting it. 
B) Track down Honourheart and Flash, You know where they are and they have your stuff.
C) Starveheart, You've got a bone to pick with the crazy slut.
D) Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash. You left them half finished and they've spent an entire night stewing on the post hypnotic suggestions you left in them.
E) Harshwhinny. Why not, You have her hairsticks after all.
F) Pinkie Pie. It's only fair after...*they*... gave you their stuff to do as they wished and properly observe and document the bubbly woman's transformation into a MILFY, Draconian Domme of a teacher
G) Other?



You decide to stay for now, there was indeed a *bunch* of stuff here that on closer inspection might be a bit to delicate to move right away. You spend a bit of time desperately trying to remember Lightning's number as all your contacts were on your old phone before Nightmare Moon helpfully supplies it from the school's registry.

You quickly send off a quick text,

'Hey, I've found somthing in Whitetail, sending you the deets, might be able to help!'

There's a tick and a few ellipsis before Lightning actually calls you,

'Hey, How do I know you're really you because this seems like  full on "Daring Do Trap" material right here.'

Oh shit, that's a good point. Your honest and guileless mind has one again tripped you into and then immediatly back out of a pitfall as you rattle off your first meeting, the next meeting and for a good measure, a few of the small [TRANCE] post hypnotic triggers you left in her mind.

You smile as you hear her breath hitch slightly in a soft gasp of pleasure and smile even wider as you hear another, *quieter* sigh from Rainbow standing a little ways off,

'I-I um, Told Rainbow everything when we um...camped together last night.'

*Camped together hmmm?*

You don't mention it but smile, you're not that mad about Lightning telling Rainbow, it was too be expected especially as your previous session with them damn well primed them for some intimate pillow talk when they were alone.

You wonder who initiated it, This new mature Lightning seems much to professional but you can't see Rainbow, despite her gumption, to be the one who initiated that level of intimacy.

But who knows what could happen in a cramped tent under a starry night after a long day of physical exertion...

'Good, Bring her too, I think I've found the Shadowy Hot Lady's lair and it is wacky. I think we might be able to reverse engineer some of this stuff, I know a few smart cookies.'

You hang up and turn to see the two sister's grinning wickedly at eachother and apparently playing a game that involved testing eachother's knowledge of the school administration and also slapping eachother's tits when one of them get's it wrong.

Or right, you're not quite sure.

It's obvious that their mental acumen and retention seems to have grown though or maybe been unshackled or perhaps it's their unwavering devotion to your goals. You want two dedicated and sexy Captains and they've obliged.

You're really glad that their "little" boost has only enhanced their skills as school administrators as well as their general intellect. The two seem *very* sharp and you wonder how well that would translate to other ventures.

You wonder if they would stay satisfied running the school now. I mean, they would be content doing anything you told them to do but they seemed to *really* like the strip club as well.

You wonder, considering the bimbomagic and your own actions seem to be guiding you towards MILFY teacher anyway, could you supplant them as a Principal? 

Send them off to run the Flank, although maybe they could rename it? The Palace perhaps...

Daybreaker's school for gifted sluts?

Mmm, Maybe not you think Moon might get upset at her sister hogging all the glory. This thought was punctuated by a resounding *slap* across Daybreaker's tanned boobs as the red hot principal had, with a cocky grin just asked,

'Which Principal won the "Administrator of the Year" award five years running-Ow! Heeheee!'

Nightmare Moon was scowling at her sister but it soon melted when Daybreaker pressed her lips against her sister's in a passionate makeup kiss before pulling back and looking into the pale woman's wide, loving eyes.

And then Daybreaker smirked that naughty grin again and pressed her plump glossy lips against Nightmare's large boob and blew and *incredibly loud* raspberry, leaving a clear imprint of her lips in orange and black lipstick.

Nightmare moon squealed in outrage that barely hid her giggling delight and struggled to pull her sister off of her boob just before the buff woman could give her a big ol' booby hickey.

Nightmare pulls her off before burying her own face in Daybreaker's tanned canyon, hands gripping the large bronzed mountains hard but thankfully the rest of your motley crew rock up at this point, sparing you the hassle of breaking the two up.

It's beginning to be a cycle with the two of them you see, Teasing, followed by petting, followed by heavier teasing and heavier petting followed by sharp but playful barbs and groping and slapping then fully tearing into eachother like only sisters can and then hot, passionate "make-up" sex. 

Treehugger and Gilda walk in, Gilda first to size the place up much like Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon had for you while Treehugger sauntered in, smoking a joint and looking around in interest at all the cool stuff.

Gilda freezes when she sees the two new Principal's and her mouth drops open, the two literally glowing beacons of womanhood smaller than Gilda, who had to hunch slightly to even stand in the shack,

'Whoa-' She says, her gaze almost going wall eyed as it immediatly tries to focus on two sets of perfect tits at the same time before a ingrained, well honed instinct kicks in and she coughs *loudly* and nudges Treehugger and makes a vague gesture to the short curvy woman's joint and then the two teachers.

'Oh, Now worries brah, I got a license.'

Nightmare Moon raises an eyebrow and Daybreaker's face is completly impassive and Gilda shifts uneasily but Treehugger seems totally unaffected, gently prodding through a pile of wires and coils.

'Yes Ms Treehugger, I am aware that you have a license to *grow* marijuana plants, I'm not so sure about smoking them however.'

'It's like, quality testing, to make sure the soil fertility is totally, like, y'know in the acceptable gradient for optimal growth and potency.'

The two sister's share a look before Daybreaker nods towards Gilda's ear, where a rather *large* doobie is currently tucked behind,

Gilda coughs again, 'It's uh...a shared license? Like a freinds pass-'

'Nice try, hand it over.'

'GAWD fine!' She flicks the joint at Daybreaker who snatches it deftly between two long, orange nails, 'Everyone looks like they've been thrown into the horny bimbo machine several times and you guys are still on my case-Wait, What are you-'

Gilda's rant cuts off as Daybreaker holds the roley up and lights it casually with a fiery whip of her hair before delicately sliding it between her lips and breathing in, to the astonishment of all around.

'Sister!' Nightmare Moon says, both disbelieving and a little impressed as Daybreaker takes a long, long, *long* drag, filling her lungs.

'Yeah! Go Principal!' Treehugger says, wide eyed in wonder as the fiery ember at the end slowly but surely closer to her glossy lips as it burns down.

'She hasn't breathed out-She's one timing it!' Gilda said hoarsely as she watches the joint burn down, Daybreaker sucking it in with a *practiced* ease that causes your eyes to narrow somewhat in amused suspicion.

The white clad MILF finishes it and smiles, holding the pink vapour inside her lungs for a few seconds before breathing out slowly, the smoke shooting out of her nostrils slowly like some huge titted dragon.

'Ooh~I haven't been able to do that since my college days, Remember Moony?'

'Yes. I...I remember-'

Treehugger's face shifts slowly as her sharp analytical mind fights through her intrest in the shack and a fog of her own placid bliss, morphing into one of mild worry that only grows when she sees the *horrified* expression on Gilda's.

'Hey uh, Gilda-My girl, Uh, what was like, y'know in that?'

'Zephyr cut with Firebush cut with Blue cut with like, y'know, normal weed and I kind of dipped it a little in that pink stuff the Mesmer was leaking, I mean, watered down ALOT though...'

'Why on earth would you make somthing like that?'  You ask, bewildered,

'It was supposed to last me the whole day! I wasn't going to do it in a fucking ONER'

Nightmare looks at Daybreaker a little warily, 
'S-Sister? Are you feeling okay?'

Daybreaker flicks the stub out and snaps her hair back over her ear, grinning arrogantly, 'Please, I used to do that half a dozen times with stronger, rougher stuff than that!'

'You have not done that in over a decade and you seem to be forgetting the aftermath where I had to carry you home.'

'We'll come back to *that* later...' Gilda says, side eyeing the two teachers, 'But um, yeah we should probably get you some milk or cheetos or...I don't know, somthing...'

'Honestly, I fine!' Daybreaker says, still smiling as sweat begins to pour down her face, *hissing* as it runs down her golden skin.

With a start, you realise that's not a metaphor anymore. It's not just the sweat that's causing her skin to glisten and shine, patches of it appear to be *acutally* turning to a coppery gold metal, spreading out like high quality body paint.

'I'm-I'm barely-Hahhh-' Her hair begins to flicker and whip madly and her tight white suit begins to *creak* dangerously, -'Barely buzzed~'

Her bright amber eyes glow and the temperature of the shack begins to climb as you can start to see solar flares and supernova's in her large, dark pupils.

'Ms Gilda, there's a bed in the back, Help me.' Nightmare says urgently and with enough authority that Gilda snaps to it immediatly, grabbing Daybreaker and with Nightmare's help begin to hustle her into the backroom,

'God she's fucking hot!' Gilda grunts as she shifts the not inconserdable amount of sexy sun goddess into the other room, stripping off her large leather and fur jacket and using that as a set of *mitts*.

'It should be fine! She's already oversaturated with magic!' You call out, helping the two out as best as you can with your magic. The three women are so beefy and booby and *curvy* that you can't actually do anything physically without getting in the way or stuck between a pair of boobs, instead you try and cool Daybreaker down so that she's actually carriable .

Her hair though. Nothing can be done about Daybreaker's mental, mind of it's own, several metres long fiery locks.

Nightmare gasps and moans as her tight body is caressed and squeezed and brushed by her sister's long mane and she has her own magical hair *and* a certain resistance built in. Gilda doesn't have either of these and is only wearing tight brown work shorts and a "Junior Speedsters" tanktop that fits more like a boobtube now, her unprotected abs vulnerable.

'Ffffuck!' Gilda shrieks as the impossibly silky hair begins to work at every inch of her exposed body , each caress bring an explosion of eye rolling pleasure as the begin to gently lash and whip at the large woman's body, 'WHO THE FUCK MADE HER THE FUCKING MANE-I-AC!' She roars then squeals as the long tendrils fight to get into her shorts before *ripping* them in to and pressing between her thick glutes.

'I'm fine~fine'really really fine...' Daybreaker says, body heavy and limp, between Nightmare and Gilda, a calm dopey smile on her face even as her hair goes mental, 'I'm barely-barely horny-Ooooh!' She squeals suddenly, flashing with a brilliant burst of sunlight and her clothes *explode* off of her as she *jerks* violently in their grip as a galaxy exploding orgasm smashes into her with the force of a meteorite. Her *entire* body shakes, shredding what's left of her clothes as she squeals and writhes before-

It cuts off as  suddenly as it started, Daybreaker blinking blearily as the after shocks run through her and faint, glowing femcum runs down her thighs in streams and her hair falls still.

'I-I think that was it.' She moans out, still twitching erratically, 'That wasn't so bad-I feel fine-OOOO!' 

Her entire body bucks a geyser of femcum shooting out of her screaming, flashing body as another orgasm, twice as powerful as the first one wracks her body as she soaks Gilda her has both her thighs in each hand just as the hair begins to thrash again.

'I'm fineI'mfinem'Fine!' Daybreaker squeals and giggles, her words turning to slurred moans as a *third* orgasm punches into her, overlaying the second one.

With a *desperate* bellow, Gilda piles forward and with Nightmare Moon's help tosses, Daybreaker into the back room and with a heroic sacrifice, slams the door shut a bare instant before she's ensnared by Daybreaker's locks.

They'll be fine.

All three of them are so *pumped* full of magic that they're pretty much oversaturated now. They're very good at spilling magic onto others but for themselves, they've hit the upper level of any changes so Daybreaker should *hopefully* revert back to normal and Gilda and Nightmare Moon should stay *roughly* the same after they've fucked it all out of her system.

You hope.

As you weave a silence spell around the room, you wonder what would have happened if you had thrown someone who was a totally blank canvas in there instead of Gilda and Nightmare. Probably a dozen lesser Daybreaker's running around, all slavishly devoted to the Mommy Daybreaker...

You're glad she's slavishly devoted to you...

'What did we miss?' Sunset asks, striding in with Fluttershy, arms around eachother's waists, large breasts squished against eachother.

'Daybreaker smoked some bad stuff and turned into The Maneiac, her hot queen of the night sister and Gilda are dealing with it.' Treehugger summarises with another drag.

'Um, Okay...' Fluttershy says, jumping slightly with an *Eep!* and clinging onto Sunset as the bedroom wall *buckles* slightly and silently due to your spell. as someone is pressed into it *very* passionately.

Sunset pulls Fluttershy in possesivly and palms the curvy changeling's ass hungrily. Sunset was taller, the tight black jeans she was wearing showcasing her long, well muscled legs and bubble butt and wide, cocked hips. She was wearing a black croptop with a stylised version of her cutie mark on it, it ended just below her boobs, pulling tight around the two large, perky globes and above a defined sixpack. It's secured by a series of string like straps, two superficial buckles on the shoulders before the straps looped around her uncovered and toned back, her back was totally visible and Fluttershy appeared to be tracing the soft lines of muscle on her back needed to haul her giant tits around.

Her hair fluttered softly in the non existent breeze and her eyes glowed softly with unreleased magic as she slung her leather jacket over her shoulder and cracked her neck,

'So, How we doing this? I don't think we'll have any trouble just yeeting them into the pod if that's what we're hoping for?'

'Oh no Sunset!' Fluttershy mewls, looking up at the taller woman with wide eyes, 'Rainbow is our friend and Coach Dust is *really* nice! Maybe we should talk it through first?

Sunset snorts, the Greedy Griffon having done it's work, she's smart, incredibly smart but not one for long drawn out plans anymore when a simple one would do,
'I don't know why it matters, They'll be thanking us once it's done!' Sunset grins salaciously, rubbing her thighs together.

They've both got good points, 

1A)You think Fluttershy could probably spin it as a good thing actually seeing at how fit and gorgous the three of you were, especially if you framed it as "Either you change yourself into somthing *you* want or Starveheart will change you into somthing *she* wants"

1B)Then again, Sunset was right, The three of you are strong enough, magically and physically that you could probably overpower the two sporty babes.

1c) Finally, You've already *primed* them to love being tranced by you. You could easily just walk them down that path and then decide what to do after the fact or just spell the Tartarus out of them as soon as they cross the threshold.

3H) The hairsticks? You can't *imagine* Rainbow Dash as a severe but sexy academic but hey-

You give Treehugger, Sunset and Fluttershy a knowing nod as Lightning and Rainbow rock up, the older woman wearing a aquamarine shirt and pair of navy blue tracksuit bottoms.  Rainbow's wearing a hoodie and shorts and starts when she see's Sunset, practically glowing in the middle of the clearing.

You decide to run the show this time and seeing how well it's gone so far with Lightning Dust, You decide to be as honest as you can while painting yourself in a positive light. You do wonder how you're going to broach Rainbow Dash though, Lightning said she'd told Dash everything but you're not sure how the energetic girl would react-

'Jeez, Sunset! When did you get so *hot?*' She blurts out with characteristic tact, staring critically at Sunset's radically changed bodies, even gearing ready to do some "Platonic"exploratory groping before Lightning pulls her away gently but firmly like a mother duck with a duckling, gently taking her under her arm and shooing her forward.

You and Fluttershy share a knowing look as Rainbow melts into the older woman's embrace, a goofy smile spreading across her face as she leans into Lightning who absently pulls her tighter and rubs her on the arm. Both you and your changeling servant could sense the timid but blossoming love there even if Lightning's was mixed with a fair degree of nervousness given her position.

Despite that, you didn't need your senses to tell that they were absolutly smitten.

You notice Sunset looks a little dissapointed not to have her new body admired and Fluttershy giggles at the tall, toned mage pouts and Rainbow almost gives herself whiplash when she sees Fluttershy,

'Whoa-' She says, jaw dropping as she her eyes graze over Fluttershy's new luscious body and Fluttershy blushes furiously before Lightning rolls her eyes and nudges Rainbow with a bit more vigour than necessary, 'Ow-What? Oh.' Rainbow frets slightly at Lightning's scolding look before Lightning cuffs her playfully over the head and steps back letting the two young women converse while she leans back against the wall of the shack next to you.

'So-Uh, Fluttershy...Um, Magic?'

'MHm...' She mumbles slightly, fidgeting with her tight sweater, sinking into the poofy neckline of it slightly. You're really not sure how much of it is an affectation. You don't think it is bizarrely enough as you sense Fluttershy makes a effort to tamp down on her lust inducing pheromones while talking to her freind. She's totally natural in her abashed meekness while paradoxically always being up for any and all types of sex. You reckon if Rainbow asked her for a quick fuck she'd blush and squeak and immediatly set to work with enthusiasm.

For now though, the two are keeping it fairly platonic despite a lot of gulping, blushing and determined eye contact,

'So-Uh, 'Lights, I mean, Lightning, I mean, Coach told me about what's happening. Magic again Huh?'

'Yeah...' Fluttershy says, eyes darting about nervously as she tries to downplay her incredible body by hiding behind her incredible body when Rainbow blurts out the same time as Fluttershy hurries out,

'I'm sorry I wasn't here to stop-'
'I'm sorry we didn't call you sooner-'

The two voices overlap and before stopping at the same time then starting again,
'No! I get it, Lightning explained, Shapeshifters and stuff.'
'Oh no, It's not so bad I really like it actually!'

'You *like* it?' Rainbow gapes and Fluttershy goes *scarlet* trying to disappear into her sweater that's already snug around her curvacious body before Sunset bursts out laughing and loops her arms around the two of them,

'Hell Dash, If you think she's bad, Wait till you see *Gilda!* Mmmm' Sunset shivers and makes a pleased sound and Rainbow gives her an odd look,

'Wait, Gilda's here too? And *changed?*'

'Oh yes- She's very cute now!' Fluttershy bubbles excitedly and Sunset laughs again,

'That's *really* not the word I'd use to describe her!' She tosses her long hair back, 'Maybe, *Big*, *Beefy*, needy in bed!'

'That's three words-' 

'Wait WHAT?!' Rainbow wriggles free, gaping at Sunset, 'You've *fucked* Gilda?'

'Yeah, Fluttershy has as well!'  Sunset says with a lusty smile, you think she's getting off on watching Rainbow squirm.

Rainbow looks like she's about to faint, looking at Fluttershy with bewildered eyes who coughs and plays with her sleeves,'

'Technically, I normally just join in half way through-'

'Normally...*join in*…'

You decide to cut in before Rainbow either passes out or runs for the hills and Lightning is looking a little more uncomfortable than you would like.

You hadn't planned on your two minions being *that* honest but this was still doable.

You step up behind Rainbow and place your hands on her shoulders, fingers instantly finding the primed pressure and trigger points you'd discovered last time and swiftly manage to cool Rainbow down.

Thankfully due to the LINK between Rainbow and Lightning, the relaxation Rainbow feels is  passed over to Lightning and as you guide them inside the shack.

'I'm afraid the physical changes have some um..*potent* mental effects as well which is why the two of them are so...you know'

'Oversexed?' Lightning says while you hand Rainbow a drink of water and sit her down on the coach, 'Did Starveheart do this?'

You shake your head, 'No, I'll be frank this was mostly on me.'

It's a credit to Lightning's level headedness and the trust she has in you that she doesn't freak out even as Rainbow does a spit take much to Sunset's amusement and Fluttershy's worry as she bounces up with a cloth and a helping hand to the spluttering Rainbow Dash.

'Okay. You want to explain?'

You lean back and sigh, twiddling your fingers as if thinking of the best way to phrase somthing,

'The third kind of magic, the "Sexy Magic" I told you about? It's *everywhere* now.' You wave your hand at the cabin, 'This place belonged to a pair of...not very good people whose main goal was to throw as many different types of items, such as your shorts against Canterlot and see what would stick and what would happen.'

'Why?'

You shrug, more or less truthfully. You really have no idea what the Mirrorverse duplicates of Twilight Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer's plan was in the long term. Fuck you don't even know if they had one or if this was just what passed for fun for them.

'Not a clue but the stuff is *all* over Canterlot by now, Look,' You jerk your thumb to the corkboard behind you, a mess of string and post its and laminate overlays showing the *level of bimboness* of different parts of the city. Canterlot high is a massive hotspot, surrounded by several more spots. The biggest ones seemed to be caused by Starveheart's thralls and you wonder what Sweet Apple Acres and Rich Manor look like right now.

They're not the only ones though, Crystal Prep Academy, Griffonstone Community College and Everfree are not as intense as Canterlot High but still significant.

The Flank is a huge blotch of pink outlined by deep blue and orange gold, two high quality of Daybreaker's and Nightmare Moon's cutie mark stuck to the laminate.

'Holy shit...' Rainbow says, eyes wide, 'Does this all *belong* to someone?'

'Not any more, not really, the two who were here before scarpered as soon as we started to get close but as you can, damage is already done. This stuff is all ambient at the moment but it *can* be used by any magic user with an agenda and Sunset will back me up, this is a *whole* lot of magic to be harnessed.'

'Yeah, Like Battle of the bands *and* my little demon tiff combined levels of magic and that's just in Canterlot High.'

'So we get rid of Starveheart and everything goes back to normal?'

'It would get *better* but it wouldn't just go, It'll start seeping into people, changing things, sometimes small changes, sometimes *big* ones but if it's not being guided it'll be a whole lot more random than if someone like Starveheart or...myself, *guided* it into somthing a little more manageable or desirable.'

'So...You want to...*inoculate* us against Starveheart's brand of bimbo and the random bimbo factor?' Rainbow asks, and your a little suprised at how astute the observation was and you're not the only one as she shrugs, 
'What? I payed attention in biology, I know what a *vaccine* is guys.'

'I...hadn't actually thought of it like that before...' You say musingly, suprised at how apt the metaphor is. 'But yes, that's accurate, there will be uh-' You indicate Sunset and Fluttershy and also Treehugger who you've only just remembered is here as she bites into a particularly crunchy chip,

'Sup.'

You hurry on, 'There will be a certain, erotic bent to the transformation but this way we can guide you into-'

'Into having a rocking set of abs to go with your huge sexy ass, rather than boobs too big to run with and a brain that's drooling out of your pussy.' Sunset finishes, licking her lips and you shoot her a look before turning back to the two sporty ladies,

'Would that be okay? I can't promise I'll get it totally down solid but as Sunset so...vividly put, It'll be less risky than being struck by a random bolt of coalesced bimbo magic or whatever Starveheart will do to you if she catches you unaware.'

Lightning bites her lip and looks at Rainbow, protective and reluctant desperate to protect her Rainbow haired student and lover. Rainbow taps her finger on her chin and shares a quiet discussion with Lightning before,

'Yeah, Sure, I'm game.'
'Okay then, I trust Rainbow's judgement in this, I'll sign up as well as long as I don't end up too much like Spitfire.'

'Just like that?' Sunset says, a little suprised and Rainbow shrugs,

'I'm not going to turn down a free sixpack Sunset-' She says, nodding at Sunset's trim midriff, 'I guess it kinda feels like cheating but it's not like I'm not going to stop working out and look-' She points to the Crystal Prep part of the map, 'It's not like *they're* going to be lacking either! I'm not going to let Crystal Prep of all places beat me because they won the lucky dip with magic they didn't even *know* about! I'll handy cap myself if I'm ever up against anyone with less than a C cup.'

Lightning still looks a little hesitant but it's more for Rainbow's sake than her own. In fact she seems a little excited to be changed herself.

Cool.

Cool Cool Cool.

First though. You wonder if it's a good idea to get rid of the LINK between the two of them if you're experimenting, you don't want to skew the experiment but on the other hand, 

*Double the Bimbo, Double the fun!* Sharing is caring and all that.

A) Break the Link, have the two ride solo for now.
B) Keep it, you're interested.
C) Boost the link, -1 mana. The two are *probably* going to end up looking and acting *very* similair no matter what happens.

 [Locked in A]

You swiftly break the link as Lightning claps her hands together and taking a deep steeling breath as she stands, 'Right. Where do we start?'

'Well, We've found a few gadgets that we think we wrangle.'

Rainbow sniggers, 'Goddamn it, We're Guinea pigs as well?'

Sunset speaks up as she holds the helmet in her hands, 'We'll be here by your side.'

'Great.' Rainbow snarks nervously as the helmet is fit snugly over her head but reaches out and squeezes Sunset's hand as Fluttershy leads Lightning over to the huge pod.

'Do I need to undress for this?' Lightning says awkwardly,

'Oh, I don't think so. You can if you want?' She says, holding out her hands to take Lightning's tracksuit jacket. 

'I might as well. I'd rather not bust out of my jacket...'

She swiftly strips out of her sports gear as if hoping to get it over with quickly and hands her clothes to Fluttershy, her cheeks red as covers her lithe body, 
'Sorry about this...I'm very carful with my clothes on account of being broke ass poor for most of my life.

'Oh, It's okay Miss Dust! You're very attractive-' Fluttershy cuts off at Lightning's raised eyebrow, 'I mean-You were always very nice to me. I can see why you and Rainbow as so close.' Her eyes widen and she puts a hand to her mouth before looking away swiftly at Lightning's groan,

'Oh god, Is it *that* obvious?' She moans, shooting a nervous look over at Rainbow who was busy comparing flexes with Sunset.

'Oh~I mean, only because I know Rainbow so well...I think it's sweet! I really like you Miss Dust.'

'Really? I always thought you were terrified of me, didn't I make you cry once?'

'Oh-' Fluttershy says, folding Lightning's clothes deftly and carefully, 'Yes-I mean, you were never as um..."open" as Coach Spitfire-'
This garners an amused snort from Lightning,
'-but you seemed to really care about *all* your students rather than only the Wondercolts like Spitfire does. I mean, you helped me prep for that tornado run even if you were um...'

'A bitch?'

'...Firm. I wouldn't worry about the "responsibility" side either. Rainbow graduates soon anyway and then you're free to hug and kiss and screw wherever you want!'

Lightning chuckles, rubbing the back of her neck,
'I guess I'm just worried I'm hogging all her best years for myself. She could do better than me with someone her own age...'

'She could do much worse!' Fluttershy says with a firm conviction that suprises Lightning, 'You're a good role model, senseible and with a good head on your shoulders and it's *obvious* that you care for her a *great* deal or you wouldn't be naked infront of me, doing this right now!'

Lightning lets out a violent breath of air, sagging in relief to be validated before squaring her shoulders and opening the door to the pod,

'You're right. Thanks Fluttershy! Let's get this over with then...' She finishes grimly but shuts the door behind her with a little flourish before waving at Rainbow through the glass and giving a thumbs up to Fluttershy.

Rainbow smiles and waves back and gives a thumbs up to Sunset.

'Smiley or Frowny?'

'Fuck it, if we're doing this why not both?' Rainbow shrugs, 'There's a "normal" face there as well so you might as well do smiley, zap me back, then do frowny then I guess decide after that?'

'Sounds good to me.' You say and nod and Fluttershy hits the big pink button on the pod while Sunset flicks the helmet to *smiley.*

Lightning's body is *bathed* in pink light and she immediatly *moans*, hand reaching out to steady herself on the wall of the pod as several pink beams trace across her body. Her other hand shoots between her legs, eyes wide as her pussy immediatly gushes with arousal,

'O-Ohh fuck! That's *really* good-Ffff-' Her fingers *squelch* into her pussy as several beams of light focus on her tight quim and it *plumps* around her fingers, nerve endings forming and enhancing and she lets out a *guttural* sound as she slams her thighs together which only heightens the situation as her swiftly swelling thighs rub together. The yellow tuft of hair above her quim shudders, most of it falling out until there's only a small, lightning bolt shaped patch, pointing directly to her throbbing clit.

Her worry lines fade as years of stress seems to slide off of her body, her widening hips and growing tits still ensure she's got a MILFY body though and a few beams of light ensure she has a mature but sensual face as her shock of bright yellow hair fights against it's scrunchie.

The scrunchie gives it it's all however, also boosted by the pink light as it becomes a bright teal band with Lightning Dashs's cutiemark as a buckle. The hair gives up, remaining a ponytail but shooting down Lightning's defined back, trailing long past her large ass and finishes barely an inch away from the floor, never seeming to touch it and retaining it's long, straight shape.

Lightning squeals, pressing her huge tits against the glass and grinding across it as the lights strobe across her body, eliminating all her remaining body hair below the neck apart from the small lightning bolt above her quim. You're sad to see some of her *leaness* go but despite a bit more extra padding, she's still very fit although now where near as beefy as Gilda and Daybreaker or as cut as Nightmare Moon.

You try out a theory and press your hand against the pod and cast a quick [IMPLANT FANTASY], giving her a large appreciation for the changes in her body and a desire to see more of the same! The pod *sucks* the spell from your hand and several more pencils of light shoot into Lightning's head and Lightning presses her body fully against the door of the body, fascinated by Rainbow's changes...

As soon as the helmet was activated, Rainbow's eyes rolled into the back of her head as the helmet began to buzz and crackle with energy. Her fingers grip the arm rests of the chair in a white knuckle grip, tongue lolling out as she helmet begins to tweak her neurology.

'Hnnnnng!' She groans, hips jerking as she cums hard, a spreading dark patch of arousal on her shorts before she cums again, hips spasming. This one seems to be much more...*intense* than the already formidable pod. Rainbow starts giggling, her voice high and airy unlike her usual coarse tone,

'Heehee! Wowie this is r-r-really goooood! My cunny w-wooooo-Woon't stop cumming! Cumming Cunny! Hee Hee!'

'Shit, I hope we're not just melting her brain-' Sunset said, a little worried,

At first you're wondering if it just does mental changes as she's sounding more and more like an airheaded bimbo, then you spot her nails, almost carving grooves into the fabric of the seat as they slowly begin to fill with colour.

One for each colour of the rainbow with three left over which have been painted, incredibly delicatly with her cutie mark, Lightning dust's mark and the last one appears to be Rarity's. 

'Ooooh-' She squeals, her hoody riding up as her non existent chest begins to grow, revealing a trim stomach that's twitching in a very familair way by now as it goes from trim, to taut, to defined and onwards. Rainbow kicks her long legs out gleefully, flinging her shoes off and you're treated to her wiggling toes, each one painted with another freinds cutie mark. 

God she must have spent ages on Fluttershy's! The level of detail was insane!

She rises up a few inches as her toned ass plumps and she finally releases the armrests and stands, pressing her fingers into her round derrier as she shimmies the shorts down her now wide, powerful hips. 

'Wow!' She says, still bubbly and impressed before she goes slighty cross eyed, looking at a strand of hair that's spooling out between her eyes.

'Huh-' She gently tugs on the small lock and squeals as the rest of her hair *explodes* out from under the helmet they curl and twist into two vibrant pigtails that grow almost past her ass but the *colours* were what did it.

It was like you had dropped acid and then were yourself dropped into the big vat they make Rainbow's in at Cloudsdale.

The hair doesn't seem to be moving but the *bright* colours seem to deepen, vibrant and eyecatching as they shift and bleed into eachother even when she's stationary.

Which she's not at the moment you have to admit. She's gently hopping down and giggling as her tits slap her in the face  before spinning rapidly around in a circle, running her hands through her own soft, luxurious hair as it twirls around  her before she get's really dizzy and almost falls over before Sunset catches her.

'Thanks Sunny! Honk!' She reaches up and squeezes one of Sunset's boobs before bursting into giggles as Sunset squeaks in shock.

The door of the pod hisses open and Lightning staggers out before catching herself with remarkable grace, fingers still idly fingering herself as she looks at you and cock an eyebrow,

'You call this *controlled?*' and you shrug and make a face. Lightning's not really upset, in fact she looks to be exploring her new body with interest, shivering as she runs her hands over her smooth sensetive body and looking at Rainbow curiously as Sunset lowers the grabby Rainbow onto the sofa before sitting next to her.

Rainbow quickly slides onto Sunset's lap and beams at with several brilliant white teeth and continuies to grab and rub Sunset's body. Sunset grins and puts up with this invasion of her space with a real trooper's spirit.

'How do you feel?' You ask the two of them and Lightning "Hmms" to herself,

'Well...I feel like I've gained a few pounds-' She says dryly, palming her tits and thicc ass and waist, 'But I also don't feel weaker, In fact I think I might be in better shape than I have been in years and quite a few stress injuries I hadn't even noticed seemed to have fucked off which is nice...' She pauses and frowns and then reaches down, grabs her calf and straightens, pulling her leg up almost perfectly vertical in an astounding display of flexibility.

'Huh, *never* used to be able to do this...Hold on-' She does a series of other stretches and manoeuvres which you're pretty should not only be impossible to her being as curvy as she is, but just straight impossible period.

She places her hands on one of the work benches and with the skill of a professional gymnast, swings her legs in a wide circle several times before flipping off gracefully, voluptuous body shifting hypnotically .

She lands and grins, 'Always wanted to be a gymnast you know but I got injured and pushed down a more athletic path-Not quite what I thought I would look like though...' She says palming her tits before walking over to Rainbow whose plump, questing lips were leaving rainbow coloured kissmarks up Sunset's chest.

She snaps her fingers infront of Rainbows face and the giggly airhead stands up quickly and wraps her arms around Lightning in a deep hug, pressing her face between Lightning's funbags and blowing a muffled raspberry before Lightning pushes her back to arms length.

'What about you Rainbow? How do you feel?'

'Totes amazing!' She bounces up on her heels to kiss Lightning on the lips. It's a bit of a struggle as the already short woman seems to have shrunk even more, her curvy body a little out of proportion with a kind of *squashed* look that only accentuates her tits and ass.

'I mean, mentally, really think about this-Stop it!' Lightning says and delivers a swift slap to Rainbow's plush ass which causes her to squeal and pout, eyes wide, 'Listen Rainbow, this is important. Okay?'

Rainbow nods swiftly, prismatic hair shifting, 'Um-Well, I guess I feel like everything is either *really funny* or makes me *really horny!*. She slides a finger between her lips, sucking on it in thought for a moment as she adjusts the helmet over her mass of hair, 'I don't *feel* dumber either and I *know* who all you guys are! I *can* focus and I think I could still do solid lap time coach but I think I might need some ducttape!' She giggles, hefting her boobs before 'Ooohing' at her fingernails, whichever hand she's not inspecting currently digging into her thick, dripping pussy.

There's a small crash from the otherside of the room as the door bangs open past the silence spell you put on it and a very haggard, slightly tanned but mostly sunburned Gilda steps out.

She swears as she almost tears the door off it's hinges before shutting it gently and you catch sight of a victorious Nightmare Moon astride a Daybreaker who is face down on the bed, asleep but still softly twitching and moaning as her sister carefully and smugly binds Daybreaker's arms behind her back.

The door shuts with a click and the massive woman leans against it, huge chest heaving as she breaths heavily and wipes sweat from her brow,

'Anyone got any fucking aftersun?'

'GILDA!' Rainbow's off like a shot, demonstrating that despite her shorter frame and new additions she's still more than able to get a *very good* turn of speed as she barrels into Gilda like a very colourful cannonball.

The colourful shortstack can only really press her face into the top of Gilda's midriff but tries her damndest to scale Gilda so she can wedge her head between the two *mountains* that make up Gilda's chest.

'What the fuck-Rainbow?' Gilda says, cupping Rainbow's ass and lifting her up with one arm, much to Rainbow's excited giggling as the small, rainbow haired sex imp tries to grope as much of Gilda as she can.

'Jeez, What the hell did I miss? How was wrangling the fucking insane sexy principal with her equally insane and equally sexy sister not the wackiest shit that has gone on in this shack in the past hour?'

[having a short break, Will do other side of Rainbow's helmet sharpish. Hope everyone likes short, airheaded rainbow]

'So what about the other setting?' Sunset asks,

'Man, I don't know, if this is happy I don't want to see sad...'Gilda says, squirming as she tries to keep the energetic Rainbow from climbing all over her body. Already most of her upper torso , neck and cheeks are already covered in glossy rainbow marks and smuges where the smaller woman has planted her lips.

Despite her size and curves, Rainbow is apparently as athletic and flexible as Lightning is as is currently hanging off Gilda's arm by her legs and rubbing some helpfully supplied aloe vera into the minor sunburn across Gilda's body. She's hooked both her legs around Gilda's large arm and is now hanging upside down, massaging Gilda's pink ass with gusto, long pigtails tickling Gilda's calves.

'It's not so much sad more...angry?' Sunset says and Gilda shudders and not just because Rainbow's questing fingers are trying to work themselves between her tight buns.

'God that's even worse, I've just spent an hour getting thrown around by the Sunny psycho , let's not make another monster right out the fucking gate.'

'I think it looks more bored-' Fluttershy says pointing and Lightning pipes up, 'I wonder if the colours mean anything. The smiley face was bright while this one is the opposite.' She's still stretching her body out , looping her leg around one of the roof beams and rotating around it like a stripper pole, other leg extended and you have to admit, out of raw technique she might be better than the two sister's albiet, totally blown out of the running by their sheer presence and stage domination.

'An angry, sad, bored muted Rainbow Dash-Brilliant. I don't think this is a good idea.'

'It could be an annoyed face-'

You're begining to agree with them but then again-

'I'll do it!' Rainbow Dash said, sitting up and sliding around to perch ontop of Gilda, one leg over each shoulder and before anyone can stop her reaches up and snaps the switch to the much debated upon face.

One again, her magenta coloured eyes roll into the back of her head and Gilda quickly grabs her thighs as she goes boneless, squinting slightly as Rainbow begins to grind her soaking quim across Gilda's back and neck.

The first thing you notice is her skin, which had become tanned and coppery with a smattering of freckles with the first setting seems to *leech* of colour. The dark dusky skin pales considerably, all colour vanishing until her entire body is a pale, uniform white, nearly to the point of albino. She slumps forward ontop of Gilda, slimming down, most of her fluffy plushness vanishing or at least, relocating into her breasts and thighs, her waist slims down to waifish delicateness. 

Her long, long slender legs curl around Gilda's chest, her cutie mark changing from the lightning cloud with a beaming sun behind it that it was in her bubbly personalty to a black, thunderous cloud white a dark, muted rainbow bolt.

Her colourful nails grow longer, the pictures staying the same but the vibrant colours of the backdrop drop a few hues.

A prelude to what would happen to her hair which is also darkening. The bright vibrant colours become darker, the red  becoming a maroon, mixing with a dark burnt orange which mixes with a dark honey yellow, the purples and indigo's deepen, becoming more vibrant by contrast and her entire colour pallet darkens as the two pigtails unwind themselves into a long, obscuring curtain the pitches down one side of her body. When her eyes refocus, the magenta is deep and swirling and focused and indeed, slighty unhappy, slighty bored, slightly angry and slighty irritated as she softly rubs across Gilda's body.

She looks down at herself and lets out a long, put upon sigh then speaks, her voice unimpressed but eloquent, almost refined,

'Well, this is an improvement over the my old self and the bimbo but I'm still very horny.' She nimbly swings herself around and shoves her pussy in front of Gilda's face,
'So, are you going to eat me out or not?' The new Dash says somewhat hauntingly before groaning softly as Gilda, possibly due to reflex or possibly due to the  Rainbow's Goth's arrogant authority compelled her to.

'Oooh...Good girl~' She sighs, stroking Gilda's hair with her hand, her tremendous ass quivering with each stroke of Gilda's tongue.

Cool, Airhead or Goth helmet...

Each one super sexy and just a *little* difficult to deal with.

Treehugger interrupts as the atomizer on her vape crackles, drawing your attention,

'So this is cool.'

'Yeah...'

'...'

'Was there anything else?'

'Oh shit, Uh yeah-I've been digging through some more documentation while running diagnostics on the equipment while it's been running. So, I think both the helmet and the booth are like, not totally finished, there may be like-more features I could unlock with some help but we only like, have enough stuff to mess around with one of them in the short term?'

'Right, What kind of features?'

'Well, the helmet I think I've got a read on, We could like, unlock more personality's than just smiley and "Goth" I think we could use it to like, scan personalty matrices and like, overlay them over other people?' 

'Wait like, clone personality's?' You say in wonder and a little worry, god what if you had a dozen people, all with the personalty of Daybreaker or Starveheart? One is more than enough...'

'Sorta, yeah maybe, in the lesser term you could also like, scan Lightning, call it [Fit Stripper] or something and paste that ontop of someone's existing personalty. It's really versatile as well, I think it was someone's magnum opus, I've found a bunch of data chips which I think have like, entire libraries of data on them. It's in some wacky file format but I think it's like...knowledge that can be beamed into someone's mind.'

'Hang on, Like, how to change a tire?'

'Brah, like how to change the tire, fix the weird rattle in the engine and build a whole other car.'

'Whoa...What else is there?' 

'Man, like I said It's in some weird file format but most of it's about sex because yeah, of course it is but I think there's some magical stuff on there as well.'

'Really?' *That* was worth thinking about. You're not totally set on the whole *brainwashed* army route nor having a whole city just made of other yous but it would be interesting to download your mind into another person and *play with yourself* for a bit...

But that instant learning thing. Imagine downloading the entire Hive acadamy's library into a small data chip and them beaming it into your head...

You could also upload the entire shared sexual abilties of your entire harem...

'And the pod?'

'Oh man, that's like, even wackier-' She takes a large hit before walking over to the pod, 'This thing can do it all I think, like, fuck the robot arm this thing is totally a world changer.'

'What do you mean?'

'This is even freakier than the helmet in some ways but not only could we program like, any type of change we wanted into this bad boy but like-' She waves her hand before moving in closer, voice hushed and intense, 'I'm pretty sure this thing was meant to be a *cloning pod*'

'...'

'I'm not shitting you, in fact I think it can go the other way to. I think she was like, trying to potentially merge with her partner into one like, super magic bimbo or something!'

'And then clone herself?'

She shrugs but looks worried despite her blazed facade. A few days ago she was a mildly decent botanist trying to grow weed in her freinds greenhouse, now she's one of the smartest people in the country dealing with...all this...

'There uh, is a third option as well. *I* might be able to cook something up from all the spare parts.' She waves the purple robotic arm at you, 'There's a *bunch* of this stuff which I think both our mutual freinds started on and then never finished and I'm pretty confident I could clag some of it together.'

Jeez. Big decisions

A) Have her work on the helmet. You have an image of getting a snapshot of all of Fluttershy's most subservient traits and her dedication to you and then just slapping the helmet on your two rivals.
B) Then again, a clone army or some kind of all powerful omnifusion would be a *powerful* advantage
C) Have Treehugger make something. It might be less ambitious but it'll certainly be less *mad scientist* as well.
D) Do nothing. There's a whole lot of power in this shack that you don't want to rush into while the threat of Starveheart and Honourheart are clouding your decisions
E) Other?

Also, as it probably should be mentioned, What are you going to do with Rainbow Dash?

A) Stay as Goth.
B) Revert to "normal" Treehugger and Sunset inform you she'll probably retain her *bimboness* but will be much closer to her original personalty
C) Stay as Bubbly

(This one got a bit freaky in terms of *weird science* Feel free to bow out of making a decision.)


Rainbow Dash shudders, pale hips squeezing Gilda's face as she cums, eyes rolling before she chuckles throatily, running her long dark nails through Gilda's mane of white hair,
'Good Girl.'

Gilda lets out a muffled cooing sound, hand going down to her own pussy before Rainbow intercepts it, one dainty hand of her large bicep. 

'No. Not yet Sweet Girl, Not yet. I need a few more before I decide when you should release.'

Surprisingly, Gilda merely mewls in assentation, legs quivering as Rainbow lightly drags her nails across Gilda's shoulders and upper arms.

You guess maybe Fluttershy's maybe trained the normally cantankerous amazon to have a subby streak when it comes to small, delicate, soft-spoken but commanding women.

Good to know but you see Fluttershy purse her lips in dissatisfaction at this quiet but demanding Rainbow playing with *her* toy.

You wonder how she would react to a *Changeling* Rainbow Dash. She was certainly versatile enough now and you have a mean little fantasy of pitting them against eachother in a little "friendly" rivalry.

You wave that away as best as you can. That smacked a little too much of Chrysalis's shitty little games and you can only marvel at how effective Fluttershy has been as a changeling just by *being* Fluttershy.

Albiet, a very lusty Fluttershy.

Right, It's probably best to turn Rainbow back now, you have a feeling both of her alter ego's are going to be a bit *much* for more than small periods or special occasions.

'Hey Rainbow-' You're answered with a long, loud sigh of irritation as her focus is drawn away from edging a now, truly well sexed and exhausted Gilda who has sank to her knees, still supporting Rainbow Dash on her shoulders where she's perched like a queen.

'Yes?' She asks, slender eyebrow cocked in royal condescension and arrogance and you're a little ashamed to admit the minor negging sets you off a little as much as it annoys you.

'Can you change back? To "normal" Dash?'

She rolls her deep, dark purple eyes, 'I guess.'

Then, without even touching the dial, her eyes roll back into her head and her body crackles with magic as her pale white skin regains some colour, not the deep tan of Bubble Dash but a healthy glow one would expect from a fit, young athlete.

Her tits and ass shrink significantly although they are both still a large handful and perkier as her pectorals firm behind her sweater puppies. Her waist and legs fill out with muscle, compensating for their short length. Her cutie mark returns to normal as well, although slightly larger over her big tight peach of an ass.

Her hair regains it's vibrancy although doesn't slide all the way back into Bubble Dash's headache inducing acid trip pigtails. Instead, it shrinks into a mid length curtain over one side while being cut short into a fade on the other side, each colour fading into the other as her eyes brighten before darting down at the softly sighing Gilda and yelping, arms flailing backwards with none of the quick gracefulness of her two counterparts.

She rocks and slips off of Gilda who is thankfully still kneeling and falls onto her ass, toned legs spread. Gilda, still obeying Dark Dash's last will, slides forward and buries her face in Rainbow's snatch, following Rainbow as she squirms.

'Fuck-G-Gilda!' She squeals as Gilda wraps her hands around Rainbow's toned midriff and drags her forward, 'I-It's fine, You can stop!' She whines before remembering the other Dash's previous command, 'I mean, You can cum, Cum now!'   

Gilda moans, legs quivering and she kicks a hole in the wall as her legs spasms out erratically before she finally goes limp and after a moment, a loud, snore begins to emanate from between Rainbow's toned legs.

Fluttershy rushes over, fretting over the massive woman like a mother hen but Gilda, having spent the majority of today wrestling with either Sunset, Daybreaker and whatever variation of Rainbow Dash was scaling her body at the time is totally conked out, a blissed out, dreamy smile on her face.

'Ooh! You're just like Zephyr and Gossamer! Am I the only one who knows their limit!' Fluttershy turns to you as she slips one of Gilda's large arms over her shoulder and wags a disapproving finger at you, blowing her pink bangs out her eye,

'You're setting a bad example Gossamer!' She huffs with the quiet disapproval you haven't experienced since you were hauled in front of The Academy's commandant for an incident involving The Academy's graduating class of Infiltrators, a 3 metre tall exquisitely painted oil painting of Princess Celestia eating cake and half a ton of poison joke.

'You work *far* too hard and don't take *nearly* enough time to rest and everyone's rushing to keep up with you!' 

You feel yourself quailing a little despite the fact she's supposed to be *your* subordinate as the finger of god waggles at you. Maybe it's because the tiny Fluttershy is having a *far* easier time dragging the much bigger Gilda than her petite frame should really allow. It's most likely due to how well fed she is given the work she's been putting in.

Still though she has to conscript a slight stunned Sunset to take Gilda's other arm as she lays down the law, 
'So we're all going to go to the Principal's house as it's the biggest, we're going to grab as much stuff as we can from the shack and hide in there and have nice "relaxing" night! With Baths, and cuddles and some decent, filling food! No Sunset, her grab her like this! Yes, that's right, There we go, turn her so we can get her out the door, be carful her boobs don't get stuck in the frame-Oops, well the wood was rotted anyway and we'll probably not be back. Coach lightning, can you grab her legs? Thank you.'

Fluttershy pokes her face back into the shack and after another intense stare and finger wag at you, turns to Treehugger, her face softening and her voice melding it a delicate tone as if Treehugger might bruise at her words,
'Oh, Treehugger, I'm sorry but is this okay for you? I know Gossamer asked you to work on the helmet but I'll make sure your bath has *extra* bubbles and I'll make sure you're well looked after once you're done!'

'Cool Brah. This shouldn't take me to long but if you got some more chips or like, a club sandwich about I'd be totally all over that buisness.' She says, voice distant as she takes another drag on her vape while fiddling with the helmet, still on Rainbow's head who is staring at this commanding Fluttershy in a mixture of stunned awe and aroused fear.

Fluttershy gives a swift, smiling nod and a thumbs up then a quick, warning finger jab at you and a look in her eyes letting you know "You Will Not Overwork Yourself" before she darts out and you hear her organising outside.

'W-Whuh-' Rainbow says succinctly before shaking her head and working at unstrapping the helmet and shakily standing up and examining her new body, blinking slowly as she runs her hands up her toned abs and large, perky boobs and then slapping her firm ass experimentally.

'Okay, so *this* is what I was expecting when we started.' She does a few stretches and even a few experimental squat jumps, 'The other stuff was fucking *wild* though-' She says, eyes wide as she bends down and touches her toes.

'What was it like?' You ask, genuinely curious of her experience, Rainbow seems borderline unchanged mentally until she sits down on the armchair again, spreads her legs and slips a few fingers into her pussy as she thinks about your question,

'Hmm-Well, It was weird obviously but I didn't feel *out of control*, like they weren't split personalities more like, extensions of my own?' She licks her fingers and sighs appreciatively at the taste before diving back in, both to her pussy and the explanation, 'Which again, is fucking wild because I never knew I had a superslut version of pure liquid happiness in me or anything even like dommy posh Dash!'

'Did you like, feel any preference for any of them or like, a draw to go back to any of them now?'

'Yes! I mean...hm...Can I borrow that? Thanks.' She gratefully accepts the screwdriver from Treehugger and gripping it by the head, slides the thick handle between her legs, 'Like, I feel a *draw* to be one of them but it's not any more than my draw to stay as "myself"' She says, making air quotation marks at that then frowns, 'Huh-I *know* this was my "original form" I guess but I don't have any more attachment to it over either of the other two *me's* I feel they're *all* me!
Which is *really freaky.* Oooh fuck!' Rainbow says, biting her lip as she cums.

'Anything else?' Treehugger says, still fiddling with the helmet but obviously deeply interested, 'Yeah-I think it's either beamed some more knowledge into me or like, *unlocked* stuff I already knew about somewhere because goth me really cared about her appearance and now I suddenly know *way* more about clothes and makeup than I did before.' She blushes, a little embarressed, 'In fact I kind of *really* want to talk to Rarity about a whole *bunch* of stuff I would normally tone out if she was talking about.'

'Huh, so you can still feel them, draw on their knowledge?'

'Bro, I don't just feel them, I *am* them I'm just like, showing a different face if that makes sense? I feel like I could just flip a switch, hell, I want to as much as I want to stay as Rainbow Classic I'm just looking for an excuse.'

'Try it.' Treehugger says, eyes intense as she cradled the helmet in her hand, 

'Bro, I don't have the helmet.'

'I noticed you like, didn't use it the last time you changed. The switch was still on goth not neutral when you gave it back. Try to like, *visualise* a switch or something man, I don't know...'

Rainbow looks between the two of you then shrugs, brow creasing in concentration before her eyes open wide in realisation,

'Oh shit! I think I CAN you know! That's wild!'

She squints harder and then-

'WOWIE! SO COOL!' Bubble Dash squeals as she cups her swelling boobies and licks her multi coloured lips.

You watch her poke and prod herself for a few moments before looking at Treehugger for an answer.

'Hell I don't know, maybe they couldn't be bothered to make more one helmet so just built this in as a feature?'

Hive, with a bit more tinkering you won't even need to "changeling" people, they would do it themselves!

It seemed the change was both *much* deeper than you first thought, while essentially expanding Rainbow's personalty by a multiple of three while simultaneously being much more superficial as well. 

There wasn't some cackling evil Dash lurking in the back of her mind waiting to grab control which was a relif, more like...a trio of hotdesking Dash's?

Man, what in the name of fuck was the Mirrorverse like if this was something they were just doing on a lark?

You order Bubble Dash back into Rainbow Classic. Bubble Dash was a bit to erratic to trust at this delicate point and Dark Dash was more of a bitch than you could deal with given that you had like, a whole harem of aggressive manipulators devoted to you at the moment.

You contemplate everything after shooing Rainbow and Treehugger out to help Fluttershy load up as much as they could.

Your moment of quiet contemplation is interrupted as the door the bedroom is booted off it's hinges, the triumphant and immensely smug Nightmare Moon standing, legs spread heroically with the large, *tightly* bound form of Daybreaker slung over her shoulder.

A series of thick leather straps bind Daybreaker's ankles, claves and thighs together, her heels pressed into her ass, her wrists bound the same way and pulled behind her back. The large MILF quivers silently, her eyes blindfolded and a large gag pressed between her lips. Her huge flowing mane of hair is bound tightly into a single, long, thick braid that is held beneath Daybreaker's arms, still trying to writhe but only managing to slap Daybreaker's huge ass futility, much to the Sun MILF's whining and gagged protestations.

Nightmare Moon's lips curl into a proud smile, eyes shut as her voice bellows out arrogantly,

'DEFEATED IS THE MONSTER. SIC SEMPER TYRANIS, NO LONGER SHALL THE BLAZING SUN HOLD DOMINION-Hey where did everyone go?

Jeez, What a fucking day.

Is there *anything* else we want to do before we close this day out?

[Opening the floor and accepting suggestions. This feels like a good point to end the day but tommorow will launch into the final stretch and you still have a whole heaping of mana and resources which I feel shouldn't be wasted. Really enjoying this though so If it comes to it, we'll just extend this day or knock back the final showdown to Tuesday as I don't want to rush the ending and leave people unsatisfied.]

[Demon Sunset]

You *finally* make it back to the sister's house and sink into the luxuriously bubbly bath, your changeling form revealing itself in a hiss of steam as you have moment to contemplate the day and meditate. 

With Lightning and Rainbow "exploring" their new bodies in the spare room, Treehugger tinkering in the garage, Fluttershy carefully and gently putting Gilda to bed and tending to her aching body and Nightmare Moon venting several years worth of frustrations onto the bound and gagged Daybreaker you find yourself washing yourself and you feel  a pang of unfamiliar loneliness.

You frown at the feeling as you lean back in the bath and wiggle your toes, still a little fascinated by them. Changelings, especially changelings in Chrysalis's Hive were always a very isolated bunch despite the crowded conditions.

You worked together out of necessity because no other bugger was going to help out a changeling, not out of any form of trust or fellowship.

You wonder how false that mindset had been, You wonder if that was why so much of the Hive had jumped ship, welcomed friendship as an alternative as soon as Spike and Thorax had been brave enough to take the first blind step.

You wonder if Thorax, the naïve oddball had actually been onto somthing, way ahead of the curve that even you were...

After all, you had bottled it when it came to the choice, by all accounts you were one of the fence sitters albiet, ambitious enough to want to sit on the *tallest* fence above all the other little people...

Maybe friendship was as pervasive and catching as the bimbo magic. Once you let it kept picking away at you...

Maybe you're going soft.

Or maybe the sex was just *really* fucking good.

You sigh in a melancholy king of way and lean back, your long, multihued hair spreading out around you as you shift, boobs squishing against the side of the tub.

'Room for one more?'

You look up and Sunset is standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame and hip cocked, eyes roving up your body and you shrug, returning her smirk and spreading your arms around the tub.

'Not really.'

It wasn't a *small* bath but everyone had *grown* considerably in the past few days and it was no longer really fit for your outrageous body but Sunset grins and throws the gown she was wearing off, revealing her athletic, buxom body, kneeling down next to the tub and trailing her fingers through the water and across your glistening black thigh, red and gold nails sending tingles up your spine as her fingers wiggle, dancing with magic as she holds her other hand out to you, affecting a bold young woman asking an equally spunky lady for a dance

You raise your eyebrow but take it gently, carrying on the charade and looking suitably abashed, one hand raised to your chest at the *forwardness* of the daring Sunset and the two of you giggle as she begins to weave a spell and you join in a moment later, following her lead, adding your own magic as she traces arcane shapes around the surface of the water and the porcelain of the bath.

She *really* is a marvel. She's got oodles of power but also an level of *innate* talent for magic that you've seen maybe *once or twice* in your entire life. One of those was when you went to a seminar (in disguise) run by Twilight Sparkle but you think that despite Sparkle's deftness and own improv abilities, the purple Alicorn's *real* talent lay in adapting and applying things she had already learned, devoured from a untold amount of tomes and books she had feasted on. You would *really* not be suprised to learn that if Twilight Sparkle wanted to turn a bath into a hot tub, she would have learned a spell *just* for that very purpose.

Hell, she probably had several in that encyclopaedic brain of hers!

You'd really enjoyed the lecture actually and you're pretty sure you would resonate much more closely in *style* and *method* with Twilight Sparkle than Sunset.

You also had a feeling,(an annoying regretful feeling) that you would probably get on *really well* with Twilight Sparkle and now you've just remembered with a smile that you'd actually snagged a signed copy of one of her published works on advanced thaumaturgy from her. This was followed by a pang of annoyance and regret as you remember you had been forced to leave it behind during your flight...

Fuck that had been before she had been an Alicorn as well. In fact that *might* have been before she had saved the world, the brainy unicorn had been well known as a rising start before she had blasted Nightmare Moon.

With a guilty *hipsterish* thought that you quickly quashed you release you had followed Twilight Sparkle before she was cool.

Tangent aside, you still recognise that despite all of that applied learning, neither you or Twilight Sparkle could do what Sunset was doing now. You *know* that she's never learned a hot tub spell because why would she? She wouldn't have deemed it *useful* to know and even if you cut the ambition away Sunset Shimmer was a very pragmatic person.

So you know, for a certainty that Sunset Shimmer is casting this spell compeltly off the cuff and making it look *easy.*

Hive, it *was* easy for her, she barely looked like she was concentrating as she wrote a whole new spell for this one situation!

You realise this isn't a *hugely* difficult spell, you imagine she would have much more trouble changing for example, a car into a carriage and viceversa but you were still *stunned* as you tried to keep up as the bath shimmered and grew.

The floor creaks and you're a little worried about how big the tub is becoming but with barely a sniff, Sunset compensates as well, strengthening the floor.

And then compensates for that as well as she effortlessly strengthens the entire support network of the house.

Fuck, maybe she wouldn't have top much trouble with the car...

'You're amazing~' You breath, now finding yourself in a *huge* hot tub, bubbles rising from several small jets built into the side and you wonder how she knew how to do the plumbing?

She grins, wiggling her eyebrows saucily and with a little added flourish she changes the colour of the water into a soft pink and you feel her magic tingle across your body as the soapy bubbles redouble.

'You're not so bad either.' She flirts, still holding your hand and grinning cockily, 'I mean, not as good as me of course-Hah!' She splutters and laughs as you splash her, water running down her face and matting her hair as she slowly steps into the water, opposite you, deftly sliding entwining her legs with yours and leaning back herself, palming her big boobies and appreciating them as the bounce.

Your body feels a little electric and you coo a little and fan yourself,
'It's been a while since I've dual casted with someone before, first time with a Unicorn even, I forgot how *intimate* it can be.'

'Well, that makes a change for us.'' Sunset grins and slides forward, gripping your thighs as she glides her pussy against yours and you sigh in spine tingling pleasure. She gives you a look of such burning intensity you flinch slightly as she purrs out, 'Was it good for you as well babe?'

You snort and she bursts into laughter, still slowly scissoring you, 

'Seriously though, I've had to *link* with the girls every time we use the elements, although that's a little more *platonic* than what we just did but you...your magic was *twisty.*'

'Is that because you're a changeling? It felt kind of similair to when I became a screaming demon bitch but more...natural I guess? Fuck-right there~' 

She bites her lip and your breath hitches and wish all discussions on magical theory could be conducted like this.

'Marefriend, I don't know, Changeling's aren't to hot on *sharing* anything let alone magic, maybe it says somthing about my *adaptable* nature which is just a nice way of saying I've lived a life of pulling wacky shit out of my ass.'

Sunset giggles then moans, legs squeezing yours, 'I think the Principal's have a few things we could shove back up there if you want! -Ah~Oooh~What about me? Was I *twisty?*

'You were pretty good, I mean not as good as me-' You echo before squealing as Sunset pinches a bright green nipple and you both spend another thirty or so seconds giggling and slapping eachother before,

'Spicy. You were Spicy.'

'Mpphh~I'll take it-' She moans as you find you rhythm and seize the initiative, your tempo increasing as you press into Sunset and she grips the edge of the bath tightly, eyes squeezed shut.

'D-Do you miss it?' You say and are glad when Sunset grasps your question without any follow up, pressing her breasts into yours,

'Being a bitch? No.' The answer comes quick and firmly between a gasp and a trembling groan as she presses her face into your shoulder, trembling in a small but powerful orgasm.

She breaths heavily against you, clinging to your back and still grinding against you, hair matted by the steam and sweat before continuing slowly, weighing her words carefully,

'I...liked feeling powerful, like I was *better*  than everyone else but It's been revealed to be, quite painfully and humiliatingly that I was in fact *not*.'

She breaks for a moment, leaning back, breathing heavily, 'I *loved* the feeling of superiority and I'll be honest, I still have dreams about the demoness. Some of them are nightmares but more than I would like to admit are pretty hot and I usually wake up *soaking* even with the nightmares come to think of it...'

Her voice gets contemplative as she works through her own feelings, 'Sometimes *I'm* the demon, Sometimes the Demon is *on top* of me or *holding me* and in a few *kissing me*, a few rare times I've been like I was when fighting the Sirens, bright and beautiful and *I* was the one *teaching* the demon a few things.' She bites her lip and begins grinding again your pussy's folding over eachother as you both sigh and moan.

'But honestly, I *like* where I am now, I like my freinds and the feeling that I'm accepted without having to *fight* for it, to *prove* I'm worthy of my own persona and I wouldn't trade that for anything, not even a rocking hot demoness body and an almost infinite level of self confidence and shit, that demoness body felt *amazing*'

She moans at the memory, gripping her tits

'I mean, I know I was getting ass pounded for most of it but Sweet Celestia, It was like every nerve ending was on fire! Sexy fire! But still. I wouldn't trade it for my freinds even I do want to see all my friends sexified!'

'What about Daybreaker and Nightmare Moon? They've change quite a bit.' You counter, enjoying the little debate but Sunset just rolls her eyes,

'I mean, have they? They still *obviously* adore eachother, When I was jilling myself listening at their door, Moon was promising Daybreaker that tommorow they could swap and Daybreaker could "spank her pale ass red."

'Alright, I sorta guided them into being friends, I didn't want them scrapping after all-'

'Yeah, but then they both agreed to only start ravishing eachother after they've finished timetabling who was going to pick up Mr Doodle Donkey's classes while he was away on paternity leave *and* if they're able to reschool The Dazzling's and find a home for them after me and the girl's found them living rough a week or so ago.'

She carries on, 'I mean, Fluttershy, you've barely changed-'

'I compleltly changed her species!' You retort hotly and Sunset scoffs,

'Oh no! She's an incredibly sexy being that no long needs to eat, exercise and is twice as durable and strong as she was before, how will she ever cope-Oh yeah-She can fucking shapeshift.' Susnet says, giving you a flat look, 'She's *still* Fluttershy, I mean, a super oversexed version of Fluttershy but yeah, she eats sex so I mean...' She shrugs,

You can't help but feel that despite her describing others you're the one being judged here and you're not to comfortable with it,

'Gilda is *jacked* as all hell and sexier than even that so I don't think she gives a shit, Treehugger is probably going to revolutionise the world, I've seen her idly doodling efficiency multipliers for superfarms in less well developed countries and I'm not a botanist but her math checks out.

Rainbow Dash is pretty much unchanged mentally, well, one third of her is unchanged at least and I suppose you could make an argument of the ethics of creating two more whole people inside of her but I've been talking to all three of them and they're pretty adamant they're the same person just different uh...facets I guess?'

She gives you a kind look and kisses your shoulder and neck.

'I mean I suppose the quote unquote "worse" thing you did was age Lightning up a few years-Yeah, I caught that once I knew what I was looking for-but I mean, you then threw her in a pod that fixed all her physical ailments and pretty much put her in peak physical condition so whatever years you "stole" from her I'm pretty sure you have back with interest.'

You bite your lip, suddenly guilty at the mental fuckery you pulled on Sunset and open your mouth, ready to blurt out about the change you whammied her with-

'and I mean, I'm not complaining to much, even if you did throw the mother of all bimbofication kinks on me.' She says and you go rigid in shock for several moments before Sunset sighs and pinches your nipple hard and you cry out in pain, rubbing it,

'Aw-Did widdle Wingy nipple get hurt because she made Sunset Shimmer into kinky oversexed slut?' She says in a mocking voice before leaning down and planting a kiss on your sore nipple and continuing in a unimpressed voice,

'Gossamer, I'm one of the most skilled Mages Equestria has produced in the last hundred or so years, I know when my mind has been fucked with although I didn't get a full read until you let me look at your magic just then so thanks for that-' She snorts before tonguing your hard nipple again, 

'Fucking "Spicy"'

'What-Are you, What happens now?' You say, mouth dry and Sunset sighs and pulls back,

'Well I thought you might show my tits a little love seeing as this is getting pretty one sided...' She jiggles her boobs and grins suggestivly, waggling her eyebrows in time with her boobs but her face softens when she sees yours,

'Look Gossamer, If I was going to banish you or turn you to stone or blast you into a million billion little bits I would have *bolted* from the bathroom as quickly as I could make up an excuse, round up the gang and Honourheart to boot and *done* that.' 

She folds her arms and smiles at you again, 'You may have noticed that I *have not* done that and I want you to know that I *could* do that, like I said, Fluttershy and Rainbow are not that different to how they were before you came along and I'm pretty sure that whatever crazy shit Starveheart has done the others are still in control of themselves. They're tough.'

'W-why not?' You ask, fidgeting and Sunset rolls her eyes again and playfully flicks your nipple and explains in a put upon voice,

'Because I *like* you Gossamer. You're sexy and smart and also nowhere as devious as you *think* you are and, I'll admit to a slight bit of narcissism here but you remind me a lot of myself and it turns out my type is a tall mirror or a sexy shapeshifter.' She wraps herself around you again but this time in a tender hug which you have *no idea* what to do with.

You actually can't remember a time where you've *been* hugged properly.

Not a passionate embrace or a flirtatious closeness but an *actual* hug.

Have you ever been hugged before?

God, that's a fucking depressing thought for anyone to have.

Fucking Sunset, Fucking Friendship.

It never lets you go once it's sank it's claws in.

You feel her feelings seep into you and gasp, your large tits feeling tight once again as they fill with more Royal Milk. You feel a reluctance to make Sunset a changeling however although an reckless, desperate idea does come to mind as her magic mingles with yours her desires twirling around with yours.

You shudder noticeably and Sunset pulls back from her hug and looks at you, 'Are you crying?'

'No!' You say quickly and god you hope you're not crying. You've got so many *feelings* inside you now! You're not sure if it's the magic or just how wild the past few days have been but *Hive* you need to vent!

And you know just who to *vent* too.

Sunset was such an amazing person but you knew she could be so much more!  

She didn't want to sacrifice her freinds and her happiness for the feeling of being powerful and dominant but maybe she didn't have to?

'W-What if you didn't have to?' You breath, eyes fluttering slightly as her love begins to pour into you and maybe it's because she's such a *powerful* and *caring* woman but *god* it feels good.

'What? Hey, I liked being "super OP, Plz nerf"  and the demon form *is* sexy but I don't want it to be a full time thing and I feel like it might put a crimp on some of my friendships. Including this one, which would *really* suck because as I said, I really like you!' She brushes you long, multihued hair behind your ear and gives you a kind smile and you let out a embarrassing little sigh as she does

*FUCK-she's so hot!* 

And not just because she's a toned, sexy bombshell.

You wouldn't want Sunset to change either but you think you could make her stronger *without* her becoming a rampant she bitch.

Well, not *much* of one at least.

Your mind is full of dirty little images and you feel them drain down into your big milkers which seem *twice* as sensetive as they were a few moments ago! Rivulets of water run down them and Sunset's hard nipples dragging across them is sending shock waves of pleasure up and down your body and you tremble despite yourself and Sunset uses that to seize the top position again, pushing you back and leaning over you with a hungry look in her eyes.

'Oops-Someone is getting randy again! Huh, do you have some kind of freindship kink or somthing? Some people get off on being *taken* by a nice domme and you almost cum from a few sappy words? Is that a thing with changelings?' She giggles, snorting slightly 'Do you want to cuddle?'

'Ooooh fuck you Sunset!' You squeal and your tits *surge* forth, two giant black orbs of restrained magic and you go boneless as you cum, rocking against Sunset's body as her eyes go wide.

Hive, your tits feel *really* big and the thumb with powerful magic and Sunset looks down as a desperate mewl bursts from your throat, your boobs begin to leak vibrant green liquid.

'Whoa-Should I...do somthing or uh...get someone or...' Sunset looks a little panicked, standing slightly, water running down her body before you take her hand and pull her back,

'No~' You moan as she stumbles ontop of you, her hands landing on your boobs and squeezing softly causing another little spurt of glowing magic milk, 'D-drink please! I need you to drain me!'

Sunset winces and bites her lip, 'I-I don't think-I don't  want to become a changeling, as sexy as you are!'

'Ooooh fuck!' You mewl, amazed and aroused at how desperate and needy you sound as her words make you *even more* desperate. You think it might be some kind of "Friendship" magic filtered through your own lusty ass magic and it's driving you *wild!*

Or maybe you do have a freindship kink. Hive, what an embarrassment!

'S-stop fucking complimenting me! It's making it worse!' You whimper, wrapping your thighs around her leg and grinding against her and scowl at her smug little smile,

'Sstop smiling, just *drain* me! Please, You won't become a changeling! I promise!'

'What? Why not?'

'Because I don't *want* you to become a changeling! I want you to become a super sexy, super powerful demonslut who still loves her freinds but also wants to fuck them! You can have it both ways just pleeeasse-It's *worse* than before! You're *spicy* fucking magic has done something! Fucking freindship! I-I'm so fucking wet! Please!'

You tits quiver and you moan and whine and you try to adjust yourself to pleasure yourself on Sunset's leg but she grabs your firmly and immobilises you,

'Okay, I'll drain your, big, bouncy boobs and risk turning into a slavish little slut like Fluttershy-' She purrs, looming over you and her confident, dominant tone sends you wild as magic crackles around you as Sunset leans in close, her lips inches from your ear, her hair draped across your face and her breath hot on your cheek,

'And you want to know why?' She says in her most sultry tone and there's more than a hint of amused giggle in her low, dangerous voice, 'It's because I *trust* you.'

Before you can process that admission of togetherness, the freindship magic flows into you, mingling with your own depraved magic and the bimbo magic to boot and like the needy lonely slut that you are, you drink it in, body rocking with pleasure at the satiating magic as you feel yourself grow more powerful and yet stay totally vunrable beneath Sunset.

You go to say somthing, to cry out in reciprocation but before you can, Sunset grins evilly and shifts her leg, grinding against your pussy and your sensetive slit sends a powerful orgasm through your body just as Sunset wraps her perfect lips around a fat nipple and *squeezes* hard while sucking for all she's worth!

Your eyes bug out, bliss blossoming from your tits as Sunset *moans* into your smooth, black breast, her throat working furiously as your powerful milk flows down her throat and she begins to grind against you, her pussy burning with lust and her eyes crackle with magic as she breaks, gasping and breathing heavily as she stares at you with half lidded, intense eyes.

'This stuff is good~ Maybe I should *give* you to Pinkie!, She's *really* friendly-Of course, I'll make her Pinkie Promise to give you a good milking whenever you feel full or maybe I should just keep you for myself?' She massages your full tits and you mewl beneath her, 'Would you like that? I'll love you and care for you and suck your needy tits you'll be my horny little milk cow?'

Oh Hive, you're not sure if she's joking, her eyes aggressive and her smile hungry and worse, you're not sure you're totally against the idea. 

You whine legs kicking, splashing soapy water as Sunset dives back down, latching on, her grinding increasing, her moans and grunts of pleasure growing louder and you feel her soft lips swell, pressing into your areola and sending bursts of pleasure through you as she *hums* into your boob.

She squeezes harder, her own hips jerking and you feel her pussy spasm against yours as she drags you into her, one hand gripping your thigh tight as she totally takes control. Splotches of red begin to creep across her firm body, and her nails begin to dig into your sensetive flesh as they become longer, sharper and you *squeal* as she tweaks your throbbing nipple with her teeth before rearing back, sclera of her eyes darkening while her teeth gleam as she rolls a long tongue across her lips.

'Fffuck!' She says, reaching down and pressing her fingers into her pussy, leaning back down and running her *growing* tongue across your nipple and then jamming it between your lips in a passionate kiss, swirling it around your own, her hand griping the back of your head while your lips mash togehter and she groans again as her fingers sink deeper into her folds before she breaks and jams them into your mouth.

Your eyes roll as you suckle on her juices, your own magic altering her fluids to taste *amazing* to you,

'Oooh look at the little slutty bug-You like the taste of my pussy?' The water seems to be steaming off her now, her scarlet breasts swelling as she pushes them against your face, squashing you against the side of the tub and holding you in place as she begins to grind against you again,

'Yes!' You breath, voice garbled by her fingers stuffed between your lips and she laughs, her hair flowing out behind her, the reds and yellows flowing like crackling embers and she removes her fingers from her mouth and trace them down her large tits and tight, ripped midriff,

'Tough, because it's still my turn and I want *more!*

She dives back down, latching onto your other breast and-Hive, *how long was her tongue!*

Sunset throat works furiously, drinking down more supercharged milk, her skin deepening while her hair *crackles* with light and she *squeals* into your chest, her toned back working as the dark outline of a pair of huge, leathery wings begin to materialise before *exploding* into reality. They give several instinctual flaps, scraping the wall, smashing several bottles of nice looking body washes and shampoos before swooping down and *enveloping* the two of you in their massive wingspan.

'Hah~You're mine now-' Sunset giggles from between your tits.


You're engulfed in warm, hot darkness, the steam of the bath creating a pitch black sauna only lit by the hot glow of Sunset's hair and her glowing emerald eyes and the tightness in your tits finally go down and Sunset's beautiful face curls into a bright, Cheshire cat grin, sharp teeth gleaming, her long tongue running over her plump lips.

Her voice is a throaty purr, Sunset Shimmer making up your entire world in that hot darkness and you mewl as she seems to grow larger. You're not even sure she's bigger physically but now she seems to *dominate* the tiny space, her hair crackling and sparking as she chuckles darkly then her breath catches, eyes rolling and long tongue lolling,

'Aah-Hah-Ah fuuck!' She jerks into you, trembling in pleasure and you feel somthing *thick* press into your thigh and you feel it begin to *curl* around your leg, sliding into the cleft between your ass cheeks and tease your tight asshole with the thick, flared tip of a fleshy tail.

'Oooh-This is new~well, Sort of...I missed having a tail but this ones a bit more-Hah-*Sensetive!* Ooooh~' Her words trail off as if on instinct, the tail *pushes* up into your asshole and the two of you *moan* loudly and you cling as best as you can in a while knuckle grip to Sunset's wings and jacked midriff, grinding your pussy frantically against Sunset who returns the favour, the two of you frantically scissoring while she fucks your tight ass with her new sensetive tail, her eyes crackle with energy, wide and frantic while a set of long, pointed ears burst from her flaming hair, still the only thing illuminating the dark cage Sunset has to two of you in.

Her voice is guttural and husky as she breaks from a aggressive kiss, her hands gripping your multihued hair tightly,

'You're mine.' She repeats, her lust filled voice possessive and your mouth gapes, body tense as she rocks you with a world flashing orgasm, your ass clenching around her thick tail, your huge tits crushing against hers while she pins you,

'I'll do whatever you want out there, be a good little minion for you but when we're alone, when you're stressed and horny from fighting Starveheart and Honourheart and leading all day, you'll come to me and *surrender* yourself to me. You pussy will be mine, your ass will be min and these big fat titties will be mine and I'll keep them nice and full and leaking because *I want you and I'll take you because you're mine and I love you!*

She *squeezes* your tits in her taloned hands and *pushes* magic into them, pushes her feelings and her love and your body jerks and rocks, unable to even form words just primal noises, your forked tongue lolling and splattering drool across Sunset's face as your over stimulated body is *saturated* with energy.

You're unable to regulate it in your state and the sheer volume of it overpowers you, crashes over you like tsunami and wave after wave of mind numbing bliss *blasts* over you. You moan, eyes popping as your empty tits once more *strain* with royal milk and only continuie to grow, squirting glowing green elixir across Sunset's own huge tits. Her tongue darts out, licking it off her chest and shuddering before entwining her tongue with yours in a aggressive, dominant kiss.

You feel your power reserves grow, you connection to Fluttershy strengthen and *pulse* as you grow taller, your thicc ass cheeks *engulfing* Sunset's tail and the darkness is lit by the multi coloured strobing hue of your own hair, soft but deep colours dancing against Sunset's fiery red and golds and oranges on the insides of Sunset's wings.

One long, sensious leg spills over the side of the hot tub, the smooth black limb kicking erratically as it lengthens, thighs *thick* and plump as you enter your final stage of maturity and become a *proper* queen. But not like Chrysalis, stick thin and gaunt no...

You were thicc! Plush and womanly and powerful and larger than life in *all* the right places and *so* horny!

'Hah-ooh-I've always had a thing for older mare's as well, personally I blame the Princess but look at this-' Sunset says with hungry and evil tone and you realise you've got a strange, throbbing sensation just above your eyes.

'Always liked a mare with a big horn as well-'

'Ohh noo, Sunset I can't take any-anymore!'

'Not a fan of hornplay? I'll fix that-I notice you're not dispelling it!' She giggles as she wraps her long, tongue around the throbbing, slender horn. Judging the sensations, it *was* longer and barely seem to have any of the jaggedness of Chrysalis's and-ooooooh!

'Please Sunset-It's too sensetive-I can't-I can't-Please, P-please!'

Sunset's glowing green eyes are devoid of mercy and say only one thing,

'I love it when you beg.'

And then in one fluid motion, drags her entwined tongue off and around your horn and stars explode behind your eyes.

You come to perhaps a minute or so later, barely coherent and body not working properly, jerking and twitching in the aftershocks, mumbling and whining in pleasure.

You blink blearily against the lights and moan, body boneless and the only reason you're not sinking into the hot steamy water is because Sunset is keeping your propped up with a foot on your chest, her tail pressing between your legs as she soaps her arms.

'Hey~You guys, like okay?' Treehugger says, short curvy body naked apart from a pair of weed panties, a towel under one arm while the other holds to no one's suprise, a joint.

'Yeah.' Sunset says, flicking a tiny rubber duck across the water and inspecting her crimson hand before tucking a burning lock of hair behind her pointed ear, 'Fluttershy was right, Gossamer just needed a bit of destressing, isn't that right Gossamer?'

'Muh-Wuh-Ooh!' Your body still wasn't cooperating, in fact it's only just realised it's not supposed to be cumming anymore.

'Aw, cool man, good to hear-I normally just vape watch cartoons but it's cool you help each other out.'

'Mmm, You know me Tree, Hey you want in?' Sunset says, spreading her arms to indicate there was plenty of space left

'Nah, I'll wait, bath times a super zen time for me. I use it to meditate, centre my chi and fingerblast my pussy. Hey, you done somthing with your hair? You look different.'

'I-Uh, No-' Sunset seems taken aback, squinting her deep black and green eyes at Treehugger, 

'I mean, I have done somthing with my hair, this shampoo is different from mine but I've also turned into a towering, winged demon woman...' She says slowly and stands, showing off her powerful and curvy body in all it's luscious detail,

'Ohh fuck~' Treehugger says with dawning realisation before taking a deep inhale, 'Looks good man. You like, evil now or what?'

'No...' Sunset says thoughtfully, tapping her chin, 'I'm pretty sure it's just a cosmetic thing, I still treasure our freindship Tree and all my others and I don't really want to take over the world either but I *do* want to hold you down and make you my little subby slut through copious amounts of spankings and orgasms so swings and roundabouts...'

'Aw, cool man-Maybe later though because Miss Moon doesn't want us to use all the hotwater and Fluttershy was getting a bit scowly that I was staying up so late so....you gonna be much longer?'

'Shit' Sunset says, a little panicked at the idea of confronting Fluttershy. She quickly bundles you up and carrying your tall, curvy body easily out of the tub. Her long, powerful strides carrying you past Treehugger and out onto the landing.

There's a few awkward moments where Sunset is trying to find somewhere to put you and you both take a moment to sneak a peek at Nightmare Moon sitting naked on a plush chair in her room with a glass of wine in her hand while she reads a Daring Do novel.

Her feet resting daintily on Daybreaker's back who is still bound, gagged and blindfolded, body *vibrating* almost as much as the several Egg Vibes strapped across her body.

'Yeesh, I wonder what Daybreaker's going to do for payback when it's her turn...' Sunset mutters as she closes the door and takes you to the spare room you were in before which is thankfully empty.

'Lightning, Gilda, Rainbow and Fluttershy are all sleeping in a big pile on Daybreaker's bed seeing as she won't be needing it tonight.'

She lays you down and swiftly crawls under the sheets with you, wrapping her legs around yours and nuzzling into your back as you play little spoon, her wings wrap over you, pulling you into her and they're surprisingly soft and you coo in satisfaction as you're hugged.

How to play tommorow though...

You're pretty sure Starveheart is going to be at school and she's got 4 fully charged thralls there. She's not a mage but *that* amount of barely restrained magic under her influence could be *really* damaging...

She *does* have that teacher kink that you slid into her though and you're certainly MILFY enough now...Then again, she's a lust crazed zealot...If she's as bad as you think she is, everything might be a kink for her now! Still, it's an opening...

Honourheart has shown she's not messing about though. In fact, given what she said, she might not even *be* at school. You don't think she's one to let others choose the battlefield if she can help it. She *is* still a changeling though what was it she said?

"Never fail to exploit a weakness..."

She knows you and Starveheart both have considerably more firepower than her, she might try and wait it out and then come in when you're weakened.

Still, you're not sure if you even *want* to duke it out with her anymore, you're feeling a strange sense of contentment at the current state of affairs as well as a gut knotting sense of fear of possibly losing it all.

You shiver and Sunset instinctively grips you tighter, pulling you into her safe embrace and you bite your lip. Sunset doesn't want to go to war with Equestria either and you don't want to go to war with Sunset...

Maybe there is a diplomatic option?

God you just wanted to escape from Chrysalis and Thorax, do your research and maybe have a bit of sexy fun! How did this happen?

You think you have just enough time in the morning to do only one thing before school starts,

A) Starveheart first. Go to school and set up to try and get the jump on Starveheart. She's by far the wildest card here and you don't want her to get a foothold. Maybe you could lay some traps for her before she arrives.

B) You know where Honourheart is thanks to the cabin's map. Dealing with Starveheart can wait, she's a sex mad slut whose bouncing around Canterlot like a magically charged pinball, she's damaging yes, but directionless. Honourheart is the real heavy here and you really don't want to give her the initiative. 

C) Other?

You wake up to a face full of...feathers? You turn over and the feathers are replaced by tits. Sunset's tits. They're not red anymore, instead normal skim colour with a healthy glow.

More than a healthy glow in fact as small motes of light appear to be issuing off of her and as her eyes flutter open, they glow with a soft golden light. Her fingers dance over your large ass, soft light emitting from her fingers and you *groan* as it sends bursts of pleasure through your ass. 

'Well good morning~' She grins, resting her head on her hand, no sign of the demon anymore. Sunset's face is human although the white light issuing from her skin and the way her hair is floating behind her in a fiery red and gold halo dazzles you slightly.

'Sunset-Wha-' You say groggily as she flaps a pair of large bright golden wings and she giggles, her voice musical,

'Hell if I know but check it out-' She beats her wings, going from horizontal to vertical in one powerful motion which would have been much more impressive if the draft hadn't blown your long bed hair in a face obscuring curtain that made you look like a particularly vibrant mushroom.

'Oops-Sorry!' She says, bending to brush the hair out of your eyes and her feelings billow off her in waves, a bright series of streams that only you can see, reds and pinks and purples and you're momentarily entranced before Sunset snaps your attention back,

'So-I *think* this should work-' She frowns, concentrating and white flames erupt over her body and your mouth falls opens as an angelic Sunset burns away to reveal the sharp fanged demon Sunset, soft feathers giving way to dark leather and she bares her sharp teeth at you,

'Grrr' She says, actually says the sound and you smile before making a show pulling the sheets up to your chin, wide eyed and scared before the two of you burst out into giggles again.

'So I can switch between the two of them, a bit like Rainbow's thing I guess but I think mines based more on mood rather than you know, having a whole other personalty or two in my head.'

She spreads her arms and with a flash she's back to normal Sunset before she drops down onto the mattress bouncing slighty as she sits infront of you,

'So what's the plan?'

You open your mouth but before you can say anything Sunset's stomach *growls* loudly and she blushes, chuckling awkwardly,

'Uh, maybe tell me over breakfast, not all of us can live of love and sex after all!'

You decide to actually shower separately to prevent any more unneeded tax on the hot water bill and so it doesn't devolve into a massive orgy again and you can actually get changed and ready before midday.

You walk down stairs to see the bizzare image of Daybreaker, making breakfast while wearing a white apron with smiling suns on it and absolutly nothing else. Her large, thick ass still has a few red marks on it from her sister's "tender ministrations" but she seems in good spirits although a little dejected that the BOONED fruit have finally run out.

Fare the well sexy fruit. You served well but you're actually kind of relived, you feel if everyone had got a dose of that we wouldn't be leaving the house at all today.

'Ah, Gossamer~' She beams, literally brightening the room with her smile, 'Moonie has already gone off the school with Gilda and Treehugger, they're hoping to get things prepared for Starveheart.'

That was good. You wanted someone running damage control while you dealt with Honourheart.

That leaves you with Daybreaker, Sunset, Rainbow and Lightning and also the helmet that Treehugger left.

'Treehugger explained it to me-' Rainbow says proffering the helmet to you, 'Well, technically she explained it to Dark Dash but I think I can make it work! Jeez, is this what Twilight feels like all the time?'

'I have a feeling she's considerable less randy than you are...' Lightning grins, placing her hand on Rainbow's tight ass, squeezing as Rainbow pushes back and returns her grin.

To Honourheart's then!

The cabin map points you to a modest hotel and you scope it out from a safe distance, back in human form and although you don't see Honourheart, which makes sense, she's tricky enough to never use the same disguise more than she needs to but you *do* hear somthing that twigs Sunset.

'That's Flash.' She says, listening to the soft strumming of a guitar coming from one of the first floor windows.

'You're sure?'

Sunset nods, 'Yeah, He used to play for me.' Her voice is strangely wistful.

You're pretty sure getting to the room won't be a problem, the receptionist is obviously coming off the night shift and you have a feeling she's *barely* engaged in her job on a good day.

So how are you going to approach this?

Sunset wants you to just knock on the door and come clean. 

Things *kind* of got ahead of you but you've not done anything unforgivable and if Starveheart keeps going unopposed than she and Thorax are going to have a much *bigger* than you. You don't think 

Honourheart is going to totally believe you but you saw her in the parking lot, she was just as worried as you were and even if she arrests you after, Sunset's willing to speak on your behalf and thinks she might be able to swing the Princesses. 

You're actually the most scared of this option. Sunset *claims* that she's fought through most of the *overt* mind control elements you threw on her and only kept  as she said "the ones she likes, mainly the ones where I get to fuck you whenever I want!"

But will that stand up to a proper Princess deprogramming? You're also not sure how much of it is you anymore. Your own magic is so tangled in the bimbo magic, hell you're a walking wet dream and magically boosted past anything you could have dreamed.

"Then again..." A dark, ambitious voice in the back of your head purrs, one that sounds quite a bit like Starveheart,

"You could always deal with her in a more...classically changeling way...You're a bastion of power, A queen! She's barely more than a drone and only managed to get to where she because those better and smarter than her had paved the way for her! Think of all the spells you have!"

The bags of magically charged weed feel heavier in your pocket as you see the hotel's easily accessible ventilation block groans to life. It would be easy to flood the whole hotel with your little stash!

Also, You just craving to test out the upgraded helmet! You're delighted to see that Treehugger has programmed in a few personalty traits, chief of which is Fluttershy's submissiveness. Or maybe you could just upload a copy of *your* mind to her! You could be a diarchy just like Equestria, well, obviously the new you would know her place but the idea of a duplicate you running about, slavishly loyal to the "Gossamer Prime" makes your pussy boil.

"And, I mean, what's stopping you from reverting the annoying little insect *after* the fact...

If you wanted of course." The voice purrs and now it sounds a little more like your own but drained of compassion, pure ambition and ego.

"Sunset would be upset though..." A different, smaller but just as powerful voice calls out and your heart squeezes at that thought,

"Fuck her, She's your creature. You can *tweak* her if needs be, fuck it throw studly Flash at her and she'll get over it. With her on your side you don't need to worry about Equestria!' The dark voice hisses and you feel your power surge as your pussy gushes.

'Sunset would be upset.' The small voice repeats, quietly but firmly, like a tiny little Fluttershy on your shoulder.

You remember what Sunset  said last night...She'd almost convinced you, hadn't she? You were a decent person, a little flawed maybe but that's why you were on this side of the mirror with her, rather than in perfect Equestria.

You feel like this would be crossing a line though. Either way, you'd be committing to a path and pulling your harem after you.

Decent or Self serving?

Your heart or Your pussy?

Friends or Slaves?

A) The High road. Turn yourself in and stop Starveheart with Honourheart and Sunset by your side.
B) The Low road. Show Honourheart that there is a new queen to kneel too, Sunset can either be with you or under you, preferably with her tongue up your pussy.
C) Other?


 


Locked in 1B - 11111

You shudder in pleasure and let out a little moan as the darker, lewder part of you fills your mind with smut and ambition and it's almost as if the fog lifts before your eyes and you sneer,

Freindship. What a joke.

You didn't need friendship. You had all the power in the world at your fingertips. You didn't need friends, you had subjects.

And you were about to get two more...

'Hey, Everything okay?' Sunset says and you supress a devious grin as the compassion and love flows into you, filling you and you're almost giddy with energy. The fact that Sunset was giving you the power to corrupt and twist her friends was *amazing.* Your nipples were diamond hard beneath your tight, black office shirt and your glad you wore a pair of lacy panties under your jade green dress because you were *dripping.*

You had fooled her. She had almost wriggled away out from under your control and had almost convinced *you* not to follow your true nature.

You smile back at her, 'Yeah, just thinking on some things...' You purr, palming the helmet in your hand as Sunset who turns away as Rainbow and Lightning jog up.

'So what's the plan?' Rainbow says and Sunset blows air out of her mouth and nods decisively, 
'Alright-We're going to go up there and knock on the door and try and form an alliance-'

'Actually, I've had a change of heart.' You say, wiggling your fingers as you wrap some of Sunset's own magic around yourself and *LINK* the three of them together before plant you plant the helmet neatly on top of Sunset's head, crank the power up and press the newly inserted *BLANK* button.

Thank you Treehugger you dumb, dumb genius!

The helmet hums and pulses, blasting Sunset's mind with pleasure and she instantly orgasms, mind blanking pleasure shooting through LINK to Lightning and Rainbow who fall on their ass, squealing and moaning, fingers questing into their tight, sports shorts now, instantly soaked as the two of them squirt their minds away.

'Gos-Gossamer-' Sunset falls back into you, body trembling in pleasure, eyes wide and pleading as rivers of femcum run down her toned skirted thighs.

'Oooh Sunset, no panties? Maybe you were hoping somthing would happen?'

'W-what-' She's hanging on, her hands squeezing your forearms as you grope her large tits. They're all yours, as is the rest of her. She just needs a little reprogramming first!

'What arrreee yooou doing?' She moans, her voice slurred, eyes struggling to focus on your as she jerks, a gushing fountain shooting from her quim and her mind grows foggier.

'Don't worry, it's only temporary but it feels good doesn't it!'

She moans and the other two women moan in unison, the air thick with their shared arousal. Lightning's face is totally blank, her mouth hanging open and her body twitching and her blank acceptance is dragging the fighting Rainbow Dash down like a lead weight, Rainbow's abs flex and tense rapidly, her teeth gritted as she tries to stand only to fall forward, legs spread as she moans into the floor, rocking her hips against her fingers before they too slip free, leaving Rainbow blank and empty

'I-ooooh-Friendship-I-I love youuu-' Sunset gasps out and you *coo* in sympathy,

'Aw I know Sunset. I think I love you too and I'll keep you around to domme me when I'm feeling particularly subby but I don't just want you to *love* me, I want you to *worship* me.'

She slumps against you and continuie to stroke her hair, 'In fact, feel that love, that loyalty and feel it *growing* inside of you as you look at me.' You change back into your natural form, perfect and sensious and Sunset's eyes go wide, mouth working silently,

'That's it. Just keep looking at me. It feels good to look at me, to listen to my voice. All this pleasure you're feeling now is only a *fraction* of what you're going to feel the longer you look at my perfect form. You can't fight it' You take her head in your hands and force her to look at you and she whines as the adoration in her eyes only grows despite her resistance,

'The longer you look, the better it feels, The better it feels to more your love grows as I bestow this pleasure on you, the more you love, the more you want to look!'

Lightning and Rainbow are looking at you now, mouths still open and eyes wide and vacant apart from an all consuming adoration

'O-Oh Celestia!' Sunset moans and you grin, pinching her nipples, 'Good, let's think of your precious Princess, Keep looking at me though.' You lean in close, your long hair covering Sunset's face as she stares into your glowing eyes, 'Focus on all that faith and admiration and love you have for her, for Twilight and for all your other little friendships, Imagine it's a glowing white ball! Hold it *tight* in your grasp.

Sunset gasps and groans, beginning to fight against you weakly as her conflicting loyalty's battle against your control but you're drunk on power and she's drunk on *you* and you have her in the palm of your hand.

'I-I have it!' Sunset breaths, grim fight in her voice as she visualises all her relationships in her hand and she's just about to fight you off when- 

You place your hand on the helmet and crank the power to *max* and then *curve* the adoring energy you're getting from the three of them *back* into the helmet creating a *powerful* cycle as you *spin* Sunset in your hands and *slide* your long horn down between her lips and *blast* her brain with your all consuming will.

'Give it to me. All of your love, everything you feel for those sluts, the admiration, the love the trust, I want it all!' Your voice thunders into Sunset's head, her eyes *beaming* with green light which *surges* along the link and you cackle as Rainbow and Lightning transfer all their loyalty and devotion to you, both kneeling, legs spread with nothing but *devotion* on their face and Sunset *screams* around your horn as the overwhelming feelings of trust and love filling her brain cause her to *cum* harder than she has in her entire life.

'All of it! You feel *nothing* for them any more, friends, family, everyone! Nothing but contempt or whatever I *want* you to feel. My Satisfaction is your Obsession, My whims are your whole world and will change whenever I want them to. Your emotions and mind are mine!'

Sunset shudders, trembles violently and then with a long, guttural moan begins to giggle around your horn, her hands trailing around your ass as she sucks and pleasures your horn devotedly before you draw it out.

She moans as she looks at you, lips wet and purrs, Oooh. *Twisty* magic...' She giggles and you see pure, undiluted devotion in her eyes and the eyes of Rainbow and Lightning.

'Kneel Slut.' You say and she drops to her knees instantly, groping her large tits and Lightning and Rainbow mewl and crawl up to kneel next to Sunset as well, all the be closer to you...

Good. 

Very good.

Now, to deal with Honourheart and Flash. Your hand crackles with pure power, fed by the obsessive love of your three slaves while you heft the large back of Greedy Griffon in your other hand.

[ABILITY UNLOCKED - UNLIMITED POWER! All spells can now be BOOSTED with more mana for added strength. There is no cap on the amount of magic you can push into a spell and the implant fantasy cap of 3 mana has been removed]

A) Spike the ventilation with Greedy Griffon, will effect the whole hotel which should be *fun!* It occurs to you that you  might be able to expend mana(specify how much) to BOOST the potency of it, maybe add a dash of milk? You wonder who would be the winner between Honourheart and Flash if they were both pumped full of Uber Griffon!

B) Why bother with any kind of subtly at all? Show them your magnificence. Implant a *powerful* Gossamer Wing Fetish into the two of them and then just walk in naked! Specify how much mana you want to use on each.

C) Other?

[Two different ideas were floated about, One was throwing some Greedy Griffon in the vents and I think the other was to implant a fantasy of yourself into the two of them? These were just the ideas that I remember, let me know if you guys have any others! Between Lust tap and your large reserve, Mana is swiftly becoming less and less a problem and we're nearing the end so feel free to cut loose!]




 [- 4 mana, Remaining mana 8/12]

You pull out the bag of deep brown leaves and smell them and get a *burst* of energy and grin at the glistening leaves leak gold fluid and seem to *pulse* in your hands. Still, Gilda's finest could do with a little *upgrade.* You *were* dealing with the best Thorax had to offer after all and you owed her a little somthing for that bloody nose she gave you...

Well, if she wanted to be the big changeling on campus, you could oblige...You need some warrior drones for your new hive after all!

And Flash...Well, Sunset had been useful, she deserved her own personal fuck machine...In fact, you wanted her input on this. You call her to stand along with Lighting and Rainbow, their experience in the gym would help you buff these leaves!

You hold the leaves in your magic, *infusing* them with power and the golden veins that run up the leaves *glow*.

'Right, I need your pussies, you're all charged with enough magic that your able to manipulate things and now I want you to make these leaves as potent as you possibly can. Finger yourselves.'

The three rush to obey, all three fit sluts gathering around in a circle with you around the glowing leaves and there is a chorus of sighs and moans as you all begin to slowly finger yourselves. Their magic slowly begins to form, rising off all of them like wisps of smoke.

'Think about every gymslut and stud you can. Think of raw primal fucking and thick, bulging muscles and fat cocks and huge wobbling tits and sheer, unyielding power. I want Gilda and Zephyr and whatever pathetic shit Starveheart has to wilt when they see what we're going to make now.'

All three of them moan, Sunset grinning with depravity and Rainbow squirms and blinks slowly, 

'Oooh-G-Gossamer-I don't like dicks-'

You cut her off by pinching her hard nipples through her tight top and she squeals as you hiss,

'Yes, Yes you do. Now you do because I command it. You're as horny for cock as you are for Lightning's pussy.' Rainbow's eyes flutter rapidly and she moans as you simply *change* her orientation, such is your control over the three of them.

They all gasp and sigh, fingering themselves faster, their own depraved minds honing in on your implanted fantasies and building on them. Every hour Rainbow spent under Spitfire and alongside Zephyr now taking on a new, eager light. Lightning superimposes every horny gymbro that's leered at her or fit slut she's leered at over the leaves and Sunset just grins, tongue lolling as she uses her own fit body and horny pussy as a base template for every women in the hotel, pouring in arousal and her own deep seated bimbofication kink.

You instil a certain suggestibility into the leaves as well, ensuring that they'll be more vunrable to your spells in their dulled, sex filled minds! The women moan and you grin,

'We all thinking our very beefiest fantasies? You especially Sunset, I imagine you want Flash *extra big?*

'Y-Yes Gossamer-Oooh!' She says, licking her lips and the other two moan their assent so you give yours,

'Good, Now cum.'

 The three squeal, eyes wide as the magic surges into the leaves and out their pussies. You catch their juices in the leaves and the plants writhe and twist, thick and deep, the golden veins *vibrant* as they ooze a steady stream of golden oil. You grin and recollect them in the baggy before adding *your own donation* and squeezing a stream of powerful royal milk into the bag.

The leaves *surge* and grow inside the baggy, pushing together and reforming and growing and you have to hurry across the road to stuff it into the ventilation machine. By the time it's become a swirling, angry ball of brown gold light that *explodes* into a *thick* cloud of golden flecked smoke that is instantly sucked into ventilation system.

You grin as you hear the soft guitar playing inside suddenly stop...

You give it a few moments to let it really spread out before hopping down and entering through the reception. You don't even bother to disguise yourself.

As soon as you see the receptionist you realise you don't need to, you walk in naked as well, glorying in your perfect, onyx body.

She was a cute if a little mousy and plain young woman whose main thought was the end of her shift and despite her antipathy for her job would always go out of her way to be as polite as possible.

Now though...

'Hey slut, Come suck on my clit!' She leers, spreading two long, thick legs as she jackhammers her pussy with two fingers. Her chair creaked under her large, jacked form and with a large *surging* grunt she fully rips one of the rests off the chair as she cums, her body shaking and firming her flabby stomach replaced by a set of *killer* abs beneath a huge pair of tits, bigger than your head. Her body glistens with sweat, defined and beefy and her pale skin is *flecked* with golden, griffon flecks.

'You want a fucking room-Hah-You can sleep between my legs-' She guffaws loudly then moans, eyes rolling as her dark hair spools out behind her, thick and flowing and you smile before raising your hand and *trancing* her and *instantly* slumps, face slack and blank as you easily slide into her mind, her fingers still work her pussy which is engorged and soaked between her jacked thighs but despite all her new strength, her mind was mushy and pliable.

Oooh, If only you had more time...Then again, this place was spacious...You could create a nice little training camp here. A whole army of strong, devoted slaves...

'I need the keys to the room the blue haired idiot and the Mohawked slut are in.' And your new servant rushes to obey, still blank but obedient hands them to you. 'Good. Now go stand by that airvent and do nothing but think about getting bigger, stronger and sexier for me. You may not cum until you're as big as possible.'

The Greedy Griffon appears to have come to rest *everywhere*, golden flecks on the walls, on the floor and you hear several loud, sexual noises, grunts and squeals coming from inside the various rooms but there is only one you care for.

This time you have someone else open the door and peek in and are *delighted* to this time actually *see* Honourheart and Flash *fully* effected. Honourheart is on the bed, trying *desperatly* not to touch herself but totally immobilised by the *surging* waves of pleasure that power over her, her body *bursting* into ecstatic flames for half a second and causing her to *moan* loudly as she fights to retain her petite, toned body and she's *losing.*

Flash has no such choice, he's already huge, as big as Zephyr, his shirt *torn* in several places, *hard* bulging muscle showing as he *furiously* beats a dick as big as a forearm, his huge balls pulsing and swelling as he grunts loudly, leering at Gossamer's pleasured body as she mewls and whines,

'F-flash! We nnee-OoooHive!-We need to l-leave nooooowwww!' Her eyes roll and she grows at least half a foot, her colourful changeling body revealed before she squashes herself back down, her jeans unbuttoned and soaked. 'C-ccarry me!'

'Need to cum!' Flash grunts, still beating his dick which is now forcing his fingers apart, fat throbbing veins pulsing madly, 'If I cum, I can think clearer but-' He roars in frustration, his hair growing darker and longer, spooling down a pair of *huge* shoulders, 'Can't cum. Need to fucking cum but I can't!'

You wonder who's going to break first, Flash's will or Gossamer's...

It could go either way really but you might be able to give it a little shove, both of their minds are *wide* open right now, resistances drowned in lust.

A) Push Gossamer, Bigger, More dommy Gossamer and a giant Flash who knows how to take orders.
B) Push Flash. Flash becomes a titan of a stud with a knack for breaking sluts, starting with Gossamer
C) Push both? Hey they've been working well together so far although you'll probably have to hit their loyalty button quite hard which shouldn't be difficult given how mush their minds are right now. 
D) Let them "fight" it out! [I'll flip a coin]
E) Other? You've got a bunch of spells and they're as open as they're ever going to be here...
