>Gura urgently shakes you awake
>whispers that someone is in the house
>you pause and groggily listen for a moment
>you can distinctly hear rustling coming from the living room
>this wakes you up instantly
>get out of bed
>grab the pistol that Gura didn't know about and load the magazine
>chamber a round and tuck it in your belt
>leave the bedroom despite Gura's protests
>she hesitantly follows
>spot the intruder in the dark
>turn on the lights and shout
>his fight or flight kicks and he bolts for an exit
>he runs right into you
>your own fight or flight response kicks in
>start swinging on him wildly
>after taking a few blows, he gets a couple good hits in
>Gura shrieks
>you feel nothing and continue to pummel the thief
>start to tire
>the intruder slips away from you and runs out the door
>you attempt to chase
>Gura grabs you by the wrist tightly
>the tears in her eyes stop you from pursuing the criminal
>she's in hysterics
>you sit down to take a breather
>Gura grabs a phone
>calls for an ambulance
>you wonder why she's not calling for police
>look down
>there's far more blood than there should be
>snap out of your primal response
>apparently, you've been stabbed
>immediately guide Gura through first aid
>she's getting more distraught by the minute
>you reassure her and tell her comforting things
>she rides with you in the ambulance
>the doctors say that the knife missed your vital organs
>but you've lost enough blood that they want to keep you overnight
>Gura climbs into your hospital bed as soon as they leave
>the morphine drip cant hold a candle to the loving, caring words Gura whispers into your ears as you fall asleep.

>wake up to a loud bang
>Gawr is awake too
>tells you she thinks someone is in the house
>another noise comes from outside the room
>Gawr jumps out of bed
>immediately grabs a bat and leaves the room
>follow her
>before you can stop her she's right behind the intruder
>cracks the guy right on the jaw as he turns around
>he drops like a sack of bricks
>she picks him up by the collar
>"YOU THINK YOU CAN FUCK WITH ME? BREAK INTO MY HOME? STEAL FROM ME?"
>starts mercilessly beating his already limp form with her fist
>a second figure suddenly darts in from the shadows
>kicks Gawr in the ribs with all his strength
>she makes a horrible sound you've never heard from her before
>you tackle him before you even process what happened
>pin him on the ground
>furiously pound his face
>your vision goes red
>your next memory is the feeling of a tiny form tugging at you
>the next sensation is that your hands hurt
>a lot
>Gawr is staring at you
>breathing heavily and genuinely looks concerned
>there's a figure lying on the floor and groaning
>his face is already swelling and changing colors
>another figure is lying on the ground nearby in a pool of blood
>his face is no longer a face
>the sputtering, gurgling sounds it's making aren't human
>call emergency services
>spend the night in the ER for multiple fractured bones in both hands
>the police pay you a visit
>it turns out that the one guy didn't make it
>stay up for hours talking to the cops
>Gawr is extremely timid and quiet the whole time
>she looks at you in a completely different way after that
>she now knows that you would kill for her in the most literal sense possible
>it's a good look

>authorities arrive on the scene
>they believe it's justified after observing the area
>your hands are too bloodied and broken for you to be any danger to them
>they consider cuffing you due to protocol
>they move to grab your wrist
>the look Gawr gives them makes them reconsider
>officers deem you as not a threat to anyone
>they don't bother you again until after the man you beat passes away
>they don't even take you to jail once you get out of the hospital
>the death of another human is always serious business though
>end up in court later
>Gawr despises the bureaucracy
>she comes to every hearing regardless
>the prosecution makes a fruitless argument for second degree murder
>your defense explains how the events clearly show self defense
>Gawr's two cracked ribs support your case
>you are also protected under castle doctrine
>the judge rules your innocent of any wrongdoing
>you go home with Gawr
>exhausted after such a long day
>plop down on the couch
>Gawr tells you to sit up
>you oblige
>she hugs you tightly
>softly admits how happy she is that you aren't in prison
