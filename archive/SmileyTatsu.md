## Smiley Jailbreak

### Why?
I got tired of changing presets for every model I want to use, and also how schizo they can get with certain messages, so I decided to use a new jailbreak for everything by modifying it, I ended up combining some Jailbreaks and changing certain things and ended up with this. I will also be creating/updating my bots based on this jailbreak.

### Preset
Copy the prompts below or [click here](https://files.catbox.moe/t6osh9.json) and download the preset (need to manually set the regex).
The preset should work with Claude 2.1, GPT 4 and Furbo.

!!! warning
	Currently the preset is **output** token heavy, using a "thinking box" strategy for the response logic, when I have a light version ready, I will update the rentry.
	At the moment the Jailbreak is still being tested, and while I like the current results, it is prone to change at any time.

	Credits to HMage and Cheese, this JB was built based on their presets and modificated by me.

### Regex

I recommend the use of Regex to delete the "thinking box"
```
Find Regex: /(`){0,3}(\n)?(\[thinking].*\[\/thinking])(\n)?(`){0,3}/is
Replace With: (empty)
Only Fomat Display: Disabled
