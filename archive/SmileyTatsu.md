## Who?
Weird anon who enjoys doing things, in this case, writing bots. 
Thing if you want to ask for something/give opinion/just be mean to me: `SmileyTatsu@proton.me`

If you have an idea for an OC you can send it to me and if I'm interested I'll do it... no guarantees bleh

## Smiley Jailbreak

### Why?
I got tired of changing presets for every model I want to use, and also how schizo they can get with certain messages, so I decided to use a new jailbreak for everything by modifying it, I ended up combining some Jailbreaks and changing certain things and ended up with this. I will also be creating/updating my bots based on this jailbreak.

### Preset
Removed the copyable option from Rentry because... I don't want to be updating every time I make a new prompt in the list, it's much easier for everyone to just download and import.

[Click here](https://files.catbox.moe/l3ww4i.json) and download the preset (need to manually set the regex).
The JB has been tested and should work on Claude 2.1 and GPT 4 1106.

!!! warning
	Currently the preset is **output** token heavy, using a "CoT" strategy for the response logic, when I have a light version ready, I will update the rentry.
	At the moment the Jailbreak is still being tested, and while I like the current results, it is prone to change at any time.

I have two possible settings that I recommend depending on the context.

**Option A (Preset Default).** It is the safest option, follows the given instructions and has good responses.
`Temperature:` 0.8 - 0.9 (test to see which one you like best)
`Frequency Penalty`: 0,15
`Presence Penalty`: 0,07
`Top K:` 4
`Top P:` 1

**Option B: This option may help you to have more creative answers, but be careful to ignore certain instructions.**
`Temperature:` 2
`Frequency Penalty`: 0,15
`Presence Penalty`: 0,07
`Top K:` 4
`Top P:` 0.25 - 0.80 (test to see which one you like best)

!!! note
	Credits to HMage, Cheese and Karu, this JB was built based on their presets/recommendations and modified by me.

### Regex

I recommend the use of Regex to delete the "thinking box" from the chat and context.
If you use RisuAI, use [this](https://files.catbox.moe/rz355x.json) preset
```
Find Regex: /(`){0,3}(\n)?(\[thinking].*\[\/thinking])\s*(`){0,3}/is
```
