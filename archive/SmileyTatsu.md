## Smiley Jailbreak

### Why?
I got tired of changing presets for every model I want to use, and also how schizo they can get with certain messages, so I decided to use a new jailbreak for everything by modifying it, I ended up combining some Jailbreaks and changing certain things and ended up with this. I will also be creating/updating my bots based on this jailbreak.

### Preset
Copy the prompts below or [click here](https://files.catbox.moe/ko7zo4.json) and download the preset (need to manually set the regex).
The preset should work with Claude 2.1, GPT 4 and Furbo.

!!! warning
	Currently the preset is **output** token heavy, using a "thinking box" strategy for the response logic, when I have a light version ready, I will update the rentry.
	At the moment the Jailbreak is still being tested, and while I like the current results, it is prone to change at any time.

The prefill was moved directly to the JB, it will have the same effect as if it was put in the prefill box.

**Prompts Order**

!!! note
	Credits to HMage, Cheese and Karu, this JB was built based on their presets/recommendations and modified by me.

### Regex

I recommend the use of Regex to delete the "thinking box" from the chat and context.
```
Find Regex: /(`){0,3}(\n)?(\[thinking].*\[\/thinking])(\n)?(`){0,3}/is
```
