Heart Domain - Suffering Krill Torture
His Heart Domain manifests as pure evil; it has the ability to corrupt animals into beings with similar power to Barrage or Summoning (when focused on quantity) Techniques. It is unique in that, while it is technically affecting his surroundings, it is localized to his stomach.
Exotic Spirit Root - Glutton's Hell
An element based on hungry, devouring flames. The flames created by this ability are unique in that they are "hungry" in a way. They seek out things that the user believes will "taste good." These flames usually coat the corrupted animals he barfs up. Also, these flames are incredibly hard to put out, and can even "eat" other flames.
Royal Bloodline - Demon Whale
Other than being as huge as a demonic whale, his stomach is a pocket dimension. He uses this dimension to breed small animals that he eventually barfs back up. It's incredibly painful to be in this pocket dimension. Despite this, it contains pheromones that cause krill and other small crustaceans to instictively breed anyway, merely suffering through the torture. He's also a really good swimmer.
>Techniques
Cultivation - Three Course Cultivation
Grade 10 Qi Gathering - Glutton's Hell Loop
Grade 10 Body Tempering - Demon Whale Feast
Grade 10 Soul Refining - Krill Tyrant
These Cultivation Techniques are based around what he constantly does. Glutton's Hell Loop improves his inner world based on his flames burning, Demon Whale Feast is based on the pheromone production in his stomach, and Krill Tyrant is simply all about eating souls and causing suffering. Funnily enough, it all boils down to just eating things, especially crustaceans.
Attack - Crushing Slam
An incredibly simple attack. He just slams people with his weight.
Footwork - Impossible Cruise
Despite his seemingly slow appearence, he actually moves quite fast. Effective in water.
Barrier - Blubber Brace
He just braces for impact, but really well.
Trump Card - Hell Gas
There's no other way to put this; it's a burp. He gathers gas in his stomach, sets it alight, and it ends up being similar to a beam of pure demonic energy erupting from his mouth. He can use it from the other end, but no one has seen this happen for over a million years.
>Bio
Everyone hates this fat buffoon, and for good reason. He literally does nothing but go around eating things and killing people. What's worse, is that he does this constantly. For about all of recorded history. He even met the people who invented cultivation; they didn't like him very much. Every time he gets too strong, he reincarnates. No one even knows how he does it. No one even knows his origins! He's in the middle of another reincarnation, and woke up really recently. He's already made crazy gains, at just 21. A good anount of those years were spent sleeping, too. What pisses some people off is that he's really stupid. Like, sub-30 iq. He can barely talk, and doesn't know how to wear clothes. Thankfully, by some twist of fate, a loincloth ALWAYS covers his privates. Once again, no one knows why this happens. As for his Life Encounters, he once tracked down a travelling merchant who managed to escape a village he attacked, he once teamed up with a Devil Sect who were too stupid to realize he would just eat and kill them, and he once got scammed. In a rare attempt at being normal, he attempted to figure out how money works, but couldn't purchase a feast with two twigs and a boulder. In his rage, he killed everyone in the area, and vowed to never try and figure out money again. Some Sects realized he woke up recently, and have put a MASSIVE bounty on his head. Everyone wants him dead. His usual combat is barfing up a bunch of fire and krill and then just slamming into someone until they die. He can go on land by the way, he just flops.
