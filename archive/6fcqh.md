#Freya macro green (part 3)

>months went by, just you and your burmecian goddess, and life was amazing
>but then it all changed
>it all started with Freya being pointed toward a dragon of immense power that was attacking a neighboring country
>a dragon the size of a damn city
>so naturally Freya made good use of her growth spell
>she was still dwarfed by the damn thing, but she was used to fighting larger beasts
>even without a spear, she found ways to hurt it
>mainly ripping off one of its horns and using that as a spear instead
>the problem arose when, despite trying to keep safe, you came into the line of fire
>you didn't even get hit, just the impact of one of its claws sent you sprawning
>bones shattered and you could feel you were dying
>Freya managed to heal you, but that was enough to fuel her rage
>and, for the first time since you'd known her, she entered her trance
>she'd explained it before
>she would be able to leap even higher than normal, pelting her foes with spectral spears as she all but flew above them
>this... was different
>her pale grey fur turned pale blue
>and her hair luminous white
>but instead of empowering her spearwork?
>that hundred foot growth limit came to an end as she shuddered and enlarged further
>Freya was already winning the fight, however hard fought
>but by the time she hit two hundred feet, her makeshift spear became just a big dagger
>one she had no problem jamming into the eye of the dragon
>and as she grunted and grew ever larger, she soon used her impossibly strong legs to kick the dragon so hard in the head, its neck snapped
>"Are you alright, my love?"
>her voice is overpoweringly loud, and you have to shout to compensate
"I'm fine! Nice work!"
>she sighs with relief
>but she's still growing
>the ground cracks and ruptures as she grows to four hundred feet
>Freya struggles and clutches her arms around herself
>then gasps and blinks down at you
>"I... I can't stop it..."
>"I can't stop growing!"
>her eyes burn fiery green as she continues to struggle against her swelling form
>at a thousand feet tall, she falls to her knees with a massive quake and closes her eyes
>even through her eyelids, you see the green glow
>but despite whatever she's trying, her body continues to grow at an ever increasing rate
>"R- run! I can't stop it!"
>you barely get to your feet when some sort of magic surrounds you, and you suddenly find yourself at a mountain pass you crossed some two days ago
>once you get your bearings, and head around a cliff, you look across the landscape to where Freya should be
>just as her pointed ears stick over a hill
>she winces as her growth continues, unabated
>despite likely being a speck on the landscape, she stares at you
>her voice causes the clouds to be blasted backward, squeezing them into sudden downpours from the air pressure
>"I'm sorry... I have to leave before I endanger you, and everyone."
>she stands, her body writhing as she undergoes a spurt that rockets her height to what must be miles high
>the mountain your're on doesn't even reach her thigh
>which bulge and flex as she crouches
>and she leaps
>the ground craters
>magma sprays like blood from the devastation of her goddess-powered jump
>and your lover leaps clear into the atmosphere
>the eruption and dust-cloud blankets the area and stops you seeing her as the landscape shatters
>the damage to the planet grows worse, and a wall of searing heat forces you to shield your eyes
>you're being cooked!
>then... all's well again
>as if nothing had happened
>but it soon becomes clear your Freya is gone
>weeks go by as you seek any sign of her, but eventually find yourself alone
>you resign yourself to returning to your lover's nation of Burmecia to help out there
>it was still repairing and repopulating from the events that made your lover famous
>she kept working to send money back home
>they welcome you with open arms
>but when you have got over your grief enough to mention what happened to Freya, they seemed unconcerned
>and you find out Freya's been here all along
>you're confused, naturally
>and seek her out one night
>you find a tall, strong, white haired, pale grey furred burmecian woman
>green eyes, sexy as hell
>she's a dead ringer
>but oddly she's... younger?
>your Freya was a seasoned knight
>this one looks about twenty
>you catch her by surprise
>she swiftly points a spear at you
>she moves just like your Freya
>"Who are you?"
"Are you Freya Crescent?"
>she nods
>then suddenly seems dizzy
>her eyes glow green as she covers her face and staggers
>and you gasp as a vast 'sun' of green fire fills the sky
>you wonder if it's a cloud or something
>but then you notice there's stars in front of the green
>"My love..."
>the voice echoes in your head
>"Do not be alarmed. I have ascended."
>you realize it... that enormous green sun?
>it's one of your Freya's eyes
>so vast, it makes the stars between you and her look like grains of sand
>she must be beyond galactic in size
>hell, Freya probably fills up most of the universe
>"I could not stop growing. I still am, but it has slowed. I have gained so much power over everything that I have become the goddess you always called me, but I could not restore myself."
>the younger Freya in front of you suddenly walks over to you, and kisses you
>it's just like how she would always kiss you
>"This is the smallest fragment of myself I could create. She does not have all my memories, just figments... she is an extension of myself."
>the Freya continues making out with you
>"I will always watch over you. Love her as you loved me, and she will soon learn how special you are to her. Farewell."
>the galactic eye of your Freya closes, as the Freya all but sticking her hands down your pants seems to snap awake and releases you
>"I- I'm sorry! I don't know what came over me!"
"It's alright. No harm done."
>"Um... I don't know why, and maybe this seems a bit forward, but... would you go on a date with me?"
>you stare at the sky for a moment, then this new Freya
"Sure. That sounds great."

>as true as your goddess said, this Freya is literally her avatar
>she must have just appeared when Freya saved you from the eruption and reset the world
>and she's every bit as wonderful as your goddess
>dates turned to passionate lovemaking
>passionate lovemaking led to living together
>and living together gave way to marriage
>and on the night of the honeymoon...
>you pin her to the bed
>Freya's moans are musical
>but as you ride her as hard as she likes, she suddenly shudders
>"W- wait. Something's wrong..."
>you pause and watch as she looks at her four fingers hands, confused
>and you both go wide eyed as her hands suddenly creak bigger
>she looks down at her chest just as her tits swell a few cup sizes larger
>you feel Freya's body shift under you as her height creeps higher
>"What's happening to me? Wait, am I growing? Oh hell, I'm growing!"
>she moans as her legs extend off the bed
>and you notice her eyes are glowing green
>you just smirk and begin kissing her body as it buds ever larger
>the bed soon gives way and she yelps, hugging you like a soft toy against her swelling tits
>you struggle free and begin to massage her inner thighs as they begin to dwarf your whole body
>"What are you doi- ahh! Ooohhh!"
>she smirks at you as she starts getting into it
>"I could... mmmh... get used to this."
>to no surprise, just like your goddess, this new Freya quickly finds herself developing a size fetish
>you begin using both arms to massage her cunt as her feet hit the other side of the room
>and she huddles in as her head threatens to burst through the wall
>she stops growing as she fills the room
>and you relentlessly pleasure her until her scream shakes the floor
>she shrinks a little as she rides her orgasm, and hugs you between her bed-sized tits
>"It's funny... this seems so familiar..."
"Yeah, funny that."
>"In fact, I just had a weird idea."

>Freya giggles as she places you on the floor between her legs
>raises her foot, which is as big as you are
>and gently presses it down on you
>as your dick stiffens against her soft paw, you relish in how this takes you back...
>the huge claws overhead as you're thoroughly but harmlessly smooshed beneath her
>the scent of her soap and shampoo mingling with the smell of rain and her gentle musk
>but she suddenly trembles again
>"What now?"
>the pressure is released as she shrinks
>and shrinks *fast*
>so fast that as she stands up, you hold onto her and she dwindles onto your chest
>now only a few inches tall
"Okay, that's new."
>"No kidding," she admits
>but she looks down your chest
>and at your still throbbing erection
>"Maybe I should return the favor?"
>you don't argue as she crawls down your body and hugs your dick
>and her athletic body presses against it as she squeezes and writhes against you
>she's insatiable as you pant and grunt
>and climbs on the end as you hit your climax
>Freya's launched as your cum hoses her
>she grows back to normal height, and you cuddle against her
>both covered in each other's fluids
>under the eye of a watchful goddess, you and your loving wife couldn't be happier
>you raised a family and a dozen kids
>that was just the first litter
>apparently being an avatar of the all-powerful goddess of rat people, she was hyper fertile
>also the fact that, while you never figured out how it worked, Freya would grow and shrink in a way that wasn't quite random
>but neither of you could directly control it
>apparently your goddess liked to play games with her avatar
>days walking hand in hand with her, only to find her shrink into her clothes
>or that time you were out on a picnic, only she suddenly grew until Burmecia was sheltered under a single toeclaw
>most of the time she grew or shrank whenever you were making love
>it kept things interesting
>and that was how you fell in love with two Freya's
>and lived happily ever after
