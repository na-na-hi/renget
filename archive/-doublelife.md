forget to respond to messages, if this
happens, you're free to dm us or remind
us that we didn't respond.

**OO2**. we have a hyperfixation on mcyt/dsmp.
we've seen the plenty of google docs, carrds,

**OO3**. we are very bad at using tone tags
or expressing our tone. if you need
clarification, feel free to ask us! in that
same boat, sometimes we struggle
with reading tone, however we don't
require tone tags unless if we directly
ask you.

**OO4**. we have a very bad social
filter sometimes, so if we say something
out of pocket / shouldn't say, please tell
us! we 9/10 do not mean the things we say. <-
