PTSD Sangheili BF greentext
\---------------------------
\>While he keeps his hard exterior in public and stays collected and firm in most of the time he spends private with you, he's just hiding the truth.
\>The war left him scarred; physically, he got healed, mentally, he's been cast away.
\>When sleeping with you, he feels the most vulnerable to the outside and does an awkward combination of wanting to protect you and curling up into a ball.
\>Which he does because of the nightmares and stress.
\>Why did he and his comrades be the cannon fodder? Why did they die and he did not?
\>He's scared, confused, doesn't know if he wants to live or die and he doesn't trust anyone besides himself.
\>Except this little human; you.
\>You like his overall personality, sometimes a little rough but still pleasant, albeit somewhat cynical. He certainly knows who's and what's good and bad.
\>You can't leave him like this. You care too much for him. And you don't know how many nights you've spent embracing him, softly whispering words of comfort to him.
\>Sometimes, they just calm him down and he either falls asleep with his massive head on your chest or he lovingly spoons you, hiding and protecting your naked body.
\>Other times, you go a little too far in the best sense possible and he starts weeping tears. Of happiness, of course.
\>He's been getting visibly better. He's less gruff and when he laughs, he's not hiding depression behind the happy mask.
\>He's not there yet, but the feeling of giving that guy back a reason to live and enjoy it is wonderful.
\>You feel this content warm fuzziness in your chest whenever you cuddle with him, hearing him grumble contentedly.
\>He loves you.

\-------------
Imagine over-ripe bananas, but not off-putting, so some just agree it's regular, fresh bananas. There's a bit of a sour citrusy musk undertone. It's a strange scent but it's also oddly intriguing.
Surprisingly, the taste has nothing to do with the former part of the scent. No bananas, it's more of that citrusy musk mixed with some pleasant saltiness. But it's also mildly aromatic, like a foreign spice you don't know from your local cuisine, more on the sharper side of the spectrum but without any burning.
The sensation morphs on your tongue, tingling it with a bitter aftertaste before you take another fresh lick. The organ itself seems to be the source of the saltiness while the various preparatory fluids seem to contain the rest of the taste. So the closer the alien is to being done, the more he releases for you to enjoy.

I wonder what the final product tastes like.

Its physical properties seem to change at will. The first shot will almost bounce off of anything, leaving only a slight spot behind, but it very quickly turns into a very, very sticky substance. Not more difficult to remove, but it will make long trails. Sometimes it's funny when you're with a partner, but the aliens aren't fond of it when pleasuring themselves as they find it a bit annoying.
But on the plus side, it doesn't have negative anomalous properties like curdling, yellowing or the smell turning foul with time. Wow, humans are pretty disgusting, aren't they?

As for the taste, it's overpoweringly spicy. Just like with the organ, it doesn't burn, but that mild exotic seasoning flavour you remember? It's gone up to 11. There is some sour-sweetness to it, too, like not fully ripe plums.

\>His irises expand and contract slightly when talking.
\>He flicks his noodle tongue occassionaly, similarly to snakes.
\>He flicks it much more drastically when you make him feel good.
\>He grabs your head from the back with one pair of hands and gently holds your chin/cheeks with the other.
\>His pleasured hisses mix with his strange, smooth voice.
\>It does smell and taste strange, but it's very good. Reminds you of bananas and lemon zest but without going in any sweet/sour/bitter territory,
\>His tail wraps around your body when he's close to finishing, maybe even your neck if you're into it.
\>He lets out worbly, gargly moans as he reaches climax, his dick pulsating and thrashing in your coated mouth and pharynx.
\>He tenderly wraps his arms around your head afterwards as his member slowly returns to his body.

His harder plates are more rigid and colder to the touch than a normal skin, but they're quite wonderful to explore with your fingertips. They're also smooth, so they're not uncomfortable to rest against. The lighter tissue that his arms, sides, tail and neck comprise of is more interesting. His musculature is a bit deeper underneath the skin and his fat reserves form more defined shapes. He's strong, but his skin is pretty damn soft and smooth, unless you press on to spots that cover joints and bones, like around fingertips, since those are pretty hard. It makes for an interesting contrast. Most of the soft parts are similarly warm to a human, but those close to his protective plates are much warmer and also more sensitive, so he likes when you gently scratch/rub him there. The same applies to his underchin, but it's a bit of a finnicky matter since that spot seems to be very intimate for him. When he lets you pet him under his mouth though, you know he feels really close to you.

When he's not aroused, he smells mild, but still nice. There's much less of the unsweet banana scent and more of the lemon zest, mixed with some fresh dirt. Salty ozone, perhaps? Not airy or -really- fresh like citrus, definitely more musty and comforting than that. Given his biology, he doesn't sweat, so there is no place for bacteria to make his musk foul and the scent gets stronger mostly when he's in certain situations like being with people close to him or when aroused, possibly both. If you lick him, the taste is a difficult thing to explain. It's a great way to take in more of his aroma but he doesn't actually taste much of anything, maybe a tiny bit salty and bitter in parts?



Sangheili
\---------
Way too deviant things aside, butts are comprised of two smells. The natural scent that can then be "enhanced" with some sweat. Sangheili differ from humans in that, somehow, bacteria don't form in their sweat. Therefore, their musk doesn't turn progressively foul like with humans. It is much stronger on its own, but if you like what an Elite smells like, him getting enervated with some exercise will only make it better, not worse.

The natural smell that you can recognise even as they freshly come out of a shower (unless they use a crapton of scented soap) has their honour and tradition written in it. Humans mostly recognise it as an earthy, a bit (literally) dirty smell. Generally, it's quite mild and neutral, but in the nether regions, it is slightly saltier and definitely more intense. It's a very comforting smell, especially if it's that of a long-time partner. It's strangely inviting, rustic and cozy. This, combined with the fact that the butt is the smoothest part of any body, Sangheili being no exception, makes the bollocks the best place to rest your head, face or tongue.

The sweat brings out the saltiness. There is no bitterness and the smell is empovering and lust-inducing for partners. Probably some useful pheromones. If you didn't want to give the insides of your Sangheili boyfriend's cheeks a good lick, you will now. It also tastes salty, but it's not dehydrating or thirst-inducing (besides the thirst for more). It's slick, but runny. Not as much as water, it is a bit thicker than that, but it's nowhere near a goo territory. It is arousing to feel it stick to your face and tongue, though.




Turians
\-------
Turians prefer warm climates. So if you want to cuddle with one, you better not mind higher temperatures because their bodies are warmer than humans'. The natural smell differs from each other, but in general, their scent is more fresh and sort of sour but with slight dustiness to it. In most situations, it's also quite dry, because their sweat is minimal with the exceptions of softer areas. Therefore in public, turians usually don't smell at all.

To avoid chafing, nether regions of turian bodies are softer and almost devoid of scales as they progressively turn thinner, softer and smaller. The natural scent is stronger, muskier, almost husky here, but not overwhelming. The dusty part beats the fresh part of the smell. For protection from the harsh sun of their homeworld, turians have slits from which their organ comes out. The natural lubricant enhances their whiff with more humidity and warmth. It seems to twist in the air and on your tongue, shifting between sour and salty when licked. It can also be slightly coppery, like licking a battery, but this sensation mixes well with the rest.

Preparatory fluid is similar, but there is some slight coldness to it, even though it's actually warm. There is some bitter aftertaste to it, but not unpleasant. It's closer to bitter drinks like coffee and beer rather than foul poisonous fruits. It is an acquired taste, but it's easily suppressed by getting some more to override it.

Of course, the most interesting part is the final seminal product. The color is white, but it can have an ever so slight blue tint. The previosuly mentioned cold taste is much stronger here and it pleasantly burns through your mouth and throat. Otherwise, the taste is quite neutral and pleasing. It's very creamy, easily covering all parts of your mouth before being washed away, leaving it both warmed and cooled.

\>You always crawl for some time through the caves before finding his lair.
\>The place is dark but as cosy as a cave room can be; not damp, clean and with smooth surfaces.
\>He's there, waiting for you.
\>Here, in the deepest, darkest pit of the world, there are no taboos.
\>You try all sorts of positions, techniques, kinks and fetishes, your carnal noises accompanied only by quiet hum of the underground.
\>Sometimes, you commit the wildest, most aggresive sexual acts imaginable, making you wonder when it would become rape.
\>Other times, you sit on his lap, in his embrace, in strange silence of mutual understanding and serene lust.



Xenomorph Chat
\--------------
(based on https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1536/07/1536071136995.jpg)
\>It's 2 AM again.
\>You often chat with this fella and completely lose track of time.
\>He's really nice and cute even though, as an alien, he has some interesting thoughts.
\>When you reveal a problem to him, he has often the strangest of solutions; he doesn't jump to conclusions, he just kind of... jumps over some of the consequences.
\>But he learns quickly and it's funny to talk with him about the differences between your and his species and cultures.
\>You've met with him a couple of times but nothing had happened between the two of you, yet; just some café dates and meet-ups.
\>Back to present, you've been chatting with him for some time now. You wish you could meet him in person right now, even though you're currently lying in bed and should be asleep to wake up for work in a couple of hours.
\>You've been exchanging some pics, too. Mostly him, since he's more awake than you are. He looks so cute in all of them.
\>A bit sheepishly, deep into the night, you ask him for something more... uncovered.
\>His messages stop for a moment. Were you too direct?
\>After a while, he asks you if you really want to see him.
\>If he's comfortable with it, yeah, you reply.
\>He sends you that pic, nervous smile on his face supported by his spiky tail and the erect dick of the perfect shape and size.
\>Well, you didn't expect to get this horny now.
\>Shakily, you type out a reply, telling him how handsome? Hot? Cute...? He looks.
\>He's flattered, sending you a photo of him looking off to the side with a goofy but endearing grin. He'd be blushing if he was able to.
\>"Would... you send me yours, now...?"
