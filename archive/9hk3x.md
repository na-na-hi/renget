>Here I am
>I'm having trouble sleeping
>Wee hours of the morning
>Sadboi hours is the term, I think
>One thought's been running through my head and won't leave
>My husband and I are getting old
>We're aging gracefully
>But we're still aging
>Yeah, it's flattering one of the neighborhood boys called me "that Japanese MILF"
>And I've seen younger women checking out my husband
>Even so, I'm still feeling my age
>Getting winded more easily
>Not as flexible as I used to be
>We might have to take it easier on our morning jog
>You can't ignore the passage of time when your kids start growing up
>Our youngest is applying for colleges
>Kami, it feels like both a short time and a lifetime since our oldest was born
>I'd like to think positive things about the future
>But since its sadboi hours, a disturbing thought question comes to mind
>What will I do if I outlive my husband?
>We've been together for so long
>I can barely imagine being alone again
>Will I even be able to go on without him?
>But I don't want to leave him alone, either
>I know he loves me just as much as I love him
>And if we died together, our children would be even more devastated
>There's no good scenario for a death in the family
>Tears start coming from my eyes
>I bury my face in my hands
>"What's wrong, honey?"
>I hear my husband's voice and see the light turn on
>"...What are you doing down here?"
>"I went to get some water and heard crying from downstairs. You know you can tell me anything, so don't hide your sadness from me."
>"I was having trouble sleeping, so I went downstairs to try and make myself tired. Then I started thinking these dark thoughts about aging..."
>I tell him about my fears through my tears
>He starts looking sad too
>But still has the strength to comfort me
>He really is a blessing
>"You're right, that IS sad. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do, except try to make sure things don't go completely off the rails."
>"Think of it this way. Even if I'm gone, a part of me will always be with you. Same if you go before me."
>He's right
>Even when he's gone, the impact he's left will always be felt
>By his friends
>By his family
>By me
>I can't imagine where I'd be today without him
>Probably be a completely different person
>And nowhere near as happy
>"Besides, we don't have to be separated forever"
>It's a bittersweet thought
>But a comforting one
>And the idea of spending eternity with him is a wonderful one
>He's made my life worth living
>I have no doubt he can make my afterlife wonderful
>Our love will last forever, even after our bodies become dust in the wind
>I start crying again
>But they're tears of happiness
>Thank Kami our youngest is at a friend's sleepover
>I don't think either of us want to explain why mom is up in the middle of the night crying
>"That's... that's such a..." I stammer through my sobs
>"Remember: I'll always be here for you. I made that promise, and I intend to keep it."
>We spend the rest of the night holding each other
>Eventually fall asleep like that
>When my youngest gets home, we don't bother explaining why we were sleeping on the couch in the den
>I can only imagine the theories as to why
>But we know the truth
>And we know we'll be together forever
>Even if one of us can't see the other
