A man, who saw better days during his time in the war, steps out of the boxcar. The sun was setting and the cold was starting to make its presence known. The trip was long, and it made him skip all his chances to eat throughout the day.
He had no idea exactly which town he had found himself in, but it was far enough away from the problems back home.

It had a few amenities here and there, like restaurants and what have you, but a quick look into his wallet revealed nothing that could let him enjoy his stay in the new town.
He knew no other choice could be made, so the dumpster behind one of the eateries would have to make due.
It seems though, he was in luck! One of the cleaners stepped out of the back door with a bunch of food in bags. The worker made a few complaints about some people leaving before the food was done, before throwing the food in the dumpster and storming back inside.
The tired vagabond quickly made his way towards the dumpster and flung it open. Revealing a smorgasbord of scrapped goodies. Probably the freshest he's had in a while.
Somethings like the bread he pockets for later, but everything else is a free meal here and now.

During his meal, some rustling crosses the man's ear. He knew it had to be on the staff and quickly turned around. To only be greeted by a tired Trubbish. He grumbles a bit for getting worked up over a literal walking trash bag and goes back to eating.
A brief moment is all he got before the Trubbish an audible scream. The man almost fell of the dumpster from the sudden sound and was ready to give it an earful, but the Pokemon was preoccupied with a Grimer slowly trying to absorb it and turn it into its next meal. 

The purple sludge monster slowly moved over the entire trash like body and started to tear it down with its strong toxins.
The man listened as the screams only got louder and louder until he couldn't take it anymore, so jumped up and grabbed a nearby bottle. With all his might he smashed the bottle onto the side of the Grimer's head. It really didn't do much damage, but it scared it enough to let go of the Trubbish and scurry off.

As the plastic bags that make up the Pokemons body are usually a bit ripped, it took a double-take to see that it was partially melted. It was just the plastic so thankfully it was none the worse for wear.
After confirming the Pokemons condition, the tired man just turned around went back to his dinner.

The Trubbish still lay in fear and trembled a little before it realized the Grimer was gone. Its little eyes reopened to see the saviour of the day digging in the trash close by.

With a little skip in its step, it walked over to the human and tried to give it a heartfelt thanks, but was promptly ignored. There was no way the Pokemon was going to go anywhere without a proper thank you for saving its life and starts climbing up the side of the dumpster.

In the corner of the man's eye, the Trubbish slowly comes into view. Waving its little trash-filled appendages. A scoff is all that comes out of his mouth before ignoring the Pokemon once again.
At this point, the little trash pile is getting frustrated and jumps onto the back of the dumpster diver's back. Gripping tightly on his shirt.

The human can't ignore it now and slowly grabs the Pokemon off his shirt and sits back down next to him. He tells the Trubbish if it behaves it can sit with him.
It happily obliges.

The two spend time together over the course of an hour. Becoming closer and closer with each minute. 

The living trash bag can not remember when it had last had a nice day like this. Simple laughs and some trashy food was enough to make an entire day worth it.
The sandwich with the bite taken out of it hit the spot, but the man could still go for more. So he stands up and checks the dumpster. Most of the edible food at this point was gone, leaving only moldy trash and dumpster soaked leftovers. He didn't want to get sick, so the rest was left to the Pokemon.
As he was trying to say his goodbyes, the Pokemon grabbed a hold of his pants leg and tugged. Trubbish didn't want the fun day with its new friend to stop.
The man had to apologize and warn about the sun almost being completely gone and the next staff member could arrive at any moment.

The Pokemon starts to panic. Within the course of an hour, somebody not only saved their life but also became a friend. Its mind races trying to find a way and make him stay. Then, a little idea pops into its head.
As the human started to walk away it jumped in front of him. Gesturing for him to stop and stay put. Of course, a resounding no comes the man.

The Trubbish at this point was almost in tears and the guilt sets in, so he promises to stay put for about another hour. After that, he was going to be gone. The Pokemon seems very thankful and quickly runs off. Promising a swift return.

---

Roughly 35 minutes pass and the Trubbish was nowhere to be seen. The man almost fully considers just leaving, but the door to the restaurant flung open. Making him panic and jump behind the dumpster to not be seen.
By the voice of the person walking out, it sounds like the same cleaner is back, but he is talking to someone else.

Thieves, a break-in, and something about a local pharmacy? Whoever the cleaner is talking to it's starting to sound serious, and a little peek around the corner reveals a cop. Looking over the area with his flashlight.
As the situation dawns onto the human, he very quickly looks around for a place to escape. No dice, the only entrance is completely blocked off by the two other people.

With a slump, the man just sits on the ground and waits, but his heart is soon pushed up to his chest when something solid landed on his lap. He almost lost it and ran before realizing it was just the Trubbish. It looked at him with a certain intensity he could not place, and it made him feel uneasy. The man tries to talk to the Trubbish but it immediately pushes its trash like appendage up to the human lips to silence him.

As the appendage sat on the now confused human's lips, it's slowly secreted a fluid that mixed in with the saliva. Making it almost undetectable when it slid down the human throat, drop by drop. Within a matter of minutes, the man became feeling stranger and stranger. Maybe the food wasn't sitting right?

The two other people having a conversation kept talking and talking. Seemed like they were going to be there for a while.

The strange feeling eventually encapsulates the man's body and turns into arousal. His breathing became heavy fast and an uncomfortable amount of pressure quickly filled his jeans. In the confusion, he almost didn't catch the cop explaining he wants to look around the alleyway while they talk. Making the human turn his head to listen intently.

The Trubbish took no chances and saw the opportunity to make its move. The sharp front teeth dived down and ripped open the man's pants enough so his meaty member could plop out of the fabric prison.
Of course, this makes the human almost completely jump up in fear, but the Trubbish's little appendages slowly wrapped themselves around the now throbbing cock. Moving slowly around sending a wave of pleasure through the man.
He grits his teeth trying to fight the feeling, but it's pushing back. The Trubbish's grip tightens more and more as the speed increases making little noises as some fluids escape the tiny Pokemon.
These fluids seeped into the skin, and pushed whatever hope of fighting this strong feelings of sexual emotion way completely. Making him give up the fight entirely.

The Trubbish could see its plan was working and stopped tugging on the human dick. Taking in the sights of its pleasure-filled friend made it want to feel the same with him, and with what little bit of courage it mustered a simple hop is all it took to get on to the man's chest.
The Pokemon reached down, ripping open the bottom of its bag before letting gravity do all the work to push the throbbing fluid covered cock inside of it.

The human grabs a hold of the Trubbish in defiance, but the fluids have completely worked their magic at this point. The face of the Trubbish tells the human it might be in a little pain, so he pulls it in close and gently kisses the top of the Pokemon's head.
The living trash bag sunk its face into the warm chest sitting in front of it and started moving up and down the human shaft with the tiny feet attached to it.

It squeaks. A little too loudly, getting the attention of the cop close by. So the defiled man grabs a hold of what he assumes is the ass of this Pokemon and kisses it deeply to dampen the noises of pleasure escaping the Pokemon mouth.

The kiss makes the eyes of the Trubbish open wide before sinking into it completely.

After they pull back from the kiss, a warmth fills both of them. The Trubbish gives a small nod and signals to the human it's nice and comfortable. So the hands started to move the Pokemon up and down the human dick.

The man couldn't handle all this slow movement and flipped the Trubbish over onto its stomach. Its little bunny-like ears looked perfect as he used them like handlebars while pushing himself as deep as he could go into the Pokemon.
It covers its mouth to try and cover up any noise it might make.
As skin slapped against bag, the little crinkles it made grew louder and louder. Each thrust filled with an ever-growing intensity. Until a warmth built up inside this Trubbish and purple like fluids exploded all over the man's cock.

The thrusting stops, so the Pokemon could enjoy its orgasm. It twitched in place, letting the overwhelmingly positive feeling flow around. It smiles, knowing that it did this with love.

After a minute of waiting, the man decided it was his turn and picked up the Trubbish by one of its ears. It panted and twitched while being suspended into the air.

The purple fluid covered dick was forced into the Trubbish's mouth and pushed as deep as it could go. The torrent of cum filled its open maw and made it choke a little. The human pulled his dick out and enjoyed the sight of this Trubbish dripping with both its own and his fluids. Its little twitches as it dangled in the air was almost enough to send the man over again.

But both the Pokemon's and the man's hearts completely stopped when they heard the cop yelling at someone to freeze. 

Some harsh sounds of metal and glass can be heard tumbling. Another peek around the corner shows that the Grimer came back with some friends at the wrong time, and the cop chases after them. The restaurant worker just scoffs and walks back inside.
The man looks back at the Trubbish to watch it swallow his semen and smile.

He slowly lets it down and caresses it. The two share this feeling of togetherness. After some shifting around, the Trubbish feels something push up against its chest. It looks down and sees a Pokeball was pulled out and offered to it.
The Pokemon could no longer hold back its tears as it slaps the button in front to go through with the capture.
