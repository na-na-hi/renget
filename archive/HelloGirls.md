Hello Girls
 
I wonder how many things will spring to mind when I close my eyes. They're all my treasures.
Out of the blue, I started whistling
and hopping around lightly SKIP SKIP LAN LAN
HELLO HELLO
"How are you?" Or something
Better make it more casual
and friendlier. Yaho! Yaho!
 
What's wrong? Try raising your head
and let me know what made you cry.
 
I will
Hi Hi stamp you
a special mark of energy.
Hi Hi Let's hold hands
and think together, okay?
Let's work with each other
and do something about it.
 
A troubled look. At this rate, I'm gonna get sad with you, too.
Okay now, let's just fill up
our stomaches with delicious foods.
 
Nothing will come true if you give up.
If you don't give up, everything will come true.
 
I will
Hi Hi make you smile.
Even for just a little bit, I want to make you feel better.
Hi Hi My neighbor,
let's sleep while cuddling together, okay?
The dawn is gonna break soon.
 
Starting from the moment everyone gathers together,
everything that you can't do alone all look like they can be done easily.
See, it's such a miracle, isn't it?
 
I will
Hi Hi stamp you
a special mark of energy.
Hi Hi Let's hold hands
and think together, okay?
Let's work with each other
 
I will
Hi Hi make you smile.
Even for just a little bit, I want to make you feel better.
Hi Hi My neighbor,
let's sleep while cuddling together, okay?
The dawn is gonna break soon.
I'll always be with you.
