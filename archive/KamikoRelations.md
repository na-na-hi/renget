##->Team 3<-

It's been awhile, hasn't it? It feels like the last time I picked up this diary was a lifetime ago. It could have belonged to a different person at this point, but it is still my own. I've been given a responsibility by the village leaders. They want me to take care of three young ones and train them into the next line of Chunins. I've already met them. I can see all the pain that they are carrying with them... but that's why I think they'll become excellent shinobi and kunoichi. Knowing the cost of a life taken means they won't be hasty to disregard the wellbeing of others and themselves. Once you've experienced that kind of loss, you shouldn't want to inflict it on others either...

#####Masukuda

Sometimes the burden of life makes you want to hide away from it all. I can't give her anything but a space for her to go to when she feels safe enough. She may shy away, but her sense of duty keeps her returning day and day again. There's no doubt that she's an exemplary kunoichi in nearly every regard but I fear that working in a team may prove troublesome for her. She's been taking all of these responsibilities, and I want her to ease her workload before it breaks her. I've seen Ichika make attempts at friending her which seems to be making slow progress. My main worry is that she feels as though the others are competition rather than allies she can lean back onto at any time. Her fear and trepidation show no signs of waning. Patience is key. I'll always be there to make sure she doesn't have to be strong at all times.

#####Ichika Chinoike

Her clan has such a terrible history, but somehow a brilliant young girl has managed to come out of it. She does well to bring her teammates together and outside their shells. Her ability to see the good in everything makes her one of the strongest genin I've seen. It will be that attitude that makes the difference between accepting a certain defeat or grasping at the shimmering hope up ahead. I'll have to be careful to foster this nature to the others without causing her to slip into a sense of naivety. She shows the greatest signs of becoming a top Medical-Nin, even at such a young age she's gained a mastery over her own recovery. It was a good idea to pair her with Masukuda, as they can both learn alongside each other while nurturing their individual talents. She seems to be struggle with indecisiveness but that's not irregular for those her age. As long as she always places belief in herself and those around her, the decisions she makes will always be the right one.

#####Kita

I've heard he was taken in by a Medical-Nin before. It must be so hard on him thinking that the cycle of loss will repeat itself once again. She must have been a truly special person risk herself on the frontlines. It may be hard to understand at his age, but one day he'll know why she did it. To love your fellow person and value their lives above your own is something that cannot be taught. I think he already knows that sort of love already, even if it isn't fully realized. I don't think he will walk the path of a Medical-Nin, but the path he walks down will intermingle with those groups no matter where he goes. I'll make sure that he's prepared for everything the world throws at him before he leaves my care. I will teach him to the best of my abilities, so that he can save the people he loves.


##->Team 1<-

Even among the rest of this exceptional generation, they stand at one of the highest levels of skill. This must be in thanks to their mentor. He's trained them well, as far as gems go they must already be shining. Even with their frequent clashes within the group, those genin are always at ready to fight side by side without second thought. Their bonds run deep even if they pretend it doesn't.

######Natsuo Uchiha

The prodigious "Scorching Haze" of the Uchiha Clan. I'm well aware of his feats during the war, and on what earned him his moniker. I've heard even amongst his clan his eyes are especially fearsome. There is something I cannot discern about our war hero however... I can feel another presence alongside his own. The only feeling I've ever gotten like this was with my own beast, but there is nothing of that sort that seems to imply his case similar to my own. Still, the tailed beast inside me stirs whenever I get close to this man. It's a mystery that not even my senses can pierce the truth of. Something to be excited about, or cause of dread? Whatever the reason may be, I'm sure it will reveal itself in due time. After all, it seems as though no one else worries about it.

######D

Another one from the Uchiha lineage, yet he doesn't take their name? Curious, but not my place to pry. It seems like this team is full of mystery. I've only ever encountered him a few times in passing, but in every meeting I can see such an intense turmoil inside, constantly looking to be stirred up in a drive to be better then his peers. I can only wonder what he has been through to push himself to such lengths yet unbowing to whatever circumstances he's been placed under. Whether or not he is successful in what he seeks, there is unlikely to be any better genin at kenjutsu across the entirety of Konoha.

######Himari Miko

A Medical-Nin, is that correct? Quite a unique method I've heard she uses. If Divine Arts is a proper substitute for the Mystic Palm technique as I've heard it to be, I'd love to see her work sometime. The youth of this generation keep surprising me with the evolutions of past techniques. Perhaps in another world it would have been her working under my watch, but I'm sure their mentor understands the value of the medical-nin even if he doesn't practice the art himself. She really is a little troublemaker, isn't she? Reminds me a lot of Ichika, except she brings her team closer by introducing friction. Very clever...

######Takeru Suzuki

I haven't ever met him myself, but the rumors of his genius have fluttered by the windowsill of my temporary residence from time to time. Putting Himari and him together seems to be a dangerous decision, who would be able to predict what they'll get into? The speed of his mind is the primary concern, but in conjunction with that kinjutsu he's learned... truly troublesome indeed. You've got a rowdy bunch, Natsuo. It shouldn't be too much of a problem for someone like him to handle that trio though. If Suzuki plays his cards right, he could earn the status of being truly untouchable, especially seeing as how his team is already learning to work in combination with each other's strengths.


##->Team 2<-

A group of oddities, although I'm sure that man is the reason behind most of it. I can see no rhyme or reason behind their selection... is there something more sinister behind his choices? Although I know I said I shouldn't pry into these kinds of things, it's just too odd to ignore. What does a young girl, an old man, and someone from the Douji clan have in common? Every aspect I look at leaves me with more questions than answers...

######Osamu

I have no doubts that he's hiding something... but why? I see the way he looks at his students... it's not an intent laced with malice, but unnerving even still. He clearly masks whatever he's feeling around others, but such a trick doesn't work against me. I don't know what his game is, but keeping my charges away from him will likely be the best choice. Someone who shrouds himself in such mystery even among his own village isn't to be ignored without some degree of caution.

######Kichona

His daughter? It is strange that there isn't much similarities between the two. Only their shared strangeness connects them together. She seems to be... disconnected in some way that I can't explain. On the outside there is nothing too outlandish about their appearance or personality, but I can tell that something about the way she behaves is staged. Her emotions do not waver even the slightest when I look at her but can switch on a dime from joy to anger. Odder still, no one seems to really know much about their family's history...

######Shimabukuro Fumio

Konohagakure's eternal Genin, yes I've heard about him. Apparently this Chunin Exam is his first in decades. I don't quite understand how he has managed to avoid success so far, but his years of study must have paid off for him to try yet again. I worry that there isn't much time for him to progress past that point in his old age. Despite his setbacks, I hope that this is the year he passes. His spirit is yet to be swayed from the path of a shinobi, and I believe there isn't anything more important then the will to carry forth and bring your dreams into reality.

######Nodao-Douji

I am unfamiliar with the Douji clan on a personal basis, but their allegiance or rather alliance with Konohagakure is well known. Fearsome warriors, battle runs in their very veins. It's no surprise that I see a member of the Douji clan indulge in drinking even at a young age to dull their senses. Their livers are supposedly tenfold that of any other which gives them extraordinary tolerance to alcohol. I am worried about the village's ability to control those urges of theirs though... especially through their mentor. I'm starting to sense some pattern in the malleability of their students... all their negative emotions still seep through their thinly veiled fronts... why would the village choose to cast such a volatile lot with this man...?

##->Team 4<-

I've heard that this team is especially harsh on training... must be a sign of their mentor's battle experience. I don't agree with pushing your students so hard that they lose out on their limited chance to enjoy their childhoods, but I understand the need to arm them with the knowledge and skills they need to survive. War will find a way to take those sort of joys away whether you seek it out or not. Maybe its better to have it restricted before it is stolen instead. I'll still hold out on the chance that life is worth more then the constant fights on the battlefield, but I'll ensure they'll be able to live long enough to do so as well.

######Kiko Inuzuku

She doesn't like me very much, I can see it even without reading beneath the surface. She keeps most people beyond arms length so I don't feel too offended, seeing as I am a villager outsider as well. She's even taken steps to make sure we don't cross paths both in and out of training our students. Very close guarded. I don't plan to try and take down those walls of hers, but I'll still be respectful. I may not know what she went through but the scars on her soul make it very clear it is something that no one would want to go through again.

######Remilia Orochimaru

I've only heard that they are an exceptional medical-nin with a unique heritage. It would be nice to introduce them to my own squad so they can learn from each other, but I know I can't have the monopoly on all medical-nin. Still, I'd be very interested in seeing their talents with medical jutsu and poison style.

######Itami Nanae

It's hard to keep such talent in Wind Release from being talked about. Their immense ability is only rivaled by their dedication towards getting a lifepartner...

If I had one piece of advice to give him, it would be to enjoy every moment you have with them and never let them go. I wouldn't give the burden of trying to get strong enough to protect them, as the world has a funny way of stealing them away from you despite all efforts. It's unfair, but one day there will be the choice... to protect the one you love at the cost of your own life or the lives of everyone you know... I hope it never comes about again.

######Kazen Uzumaki

Such skills in sealing alongside deep chakra reserves points to one clan, the Uzumaki's. Even with my experience medical jutsu, it's hard to compete with their members, as their raw vitality flows through every one of their unwavering hearts. He has a great lineage to live up to if he wishes to match some of the greatest shinobi who have ever lived. It's a long and difficult journey, but the Uzumaki have never been one to give up so easily.

##->Team 5<-

Out of all the teams, I think Team 5 has the most eyes on them. A Hyuga, a Divine Monk, and a mysterious girl possessing the Sharingan. Each of them on their own can be considered a prodigy in their own regards, but together they make up a force to be reckoned with. It'll take a rather exceptional mentor to fully develop their wide array of skills, but I think Konohagakure chose the right person.

######Ezaki Tuto

He's really much kinder than his appearance would suggest. Even though he struggles so much with those bandages, he doesn't seem to have looked for a medical-nin to take care of his injuries. Maybe those wounds are far beyond what normal shinobi can provide for. It doesn't seem to slow him down much however... as long as he's able to avoid tangling himself up, he's still able to weave handsigns at a blurring pace. Maybe I should send him some medicinal gel as a gift... I'd like to get closer to his team to practice their skills at avoiding shinobi with great perceptive abilities.

######Jin Hyuga

Even as a part of the branch family, he shines brighter than other members of his clan, main or otherwise. The Hyuga's system of hierarchy is the reason behind their strength, but I can't help but to think it will be their downfall by denying the potential of those they deem lesser. The techniques he holds pulls out far more power than I've ever seen a Hyuga achieve... is it the manipulation of his own chakra pathways? Seems dangerous, but his will doesn't falter in the slightest when faced with that sort of hazard. It seems he's already mastered it to a degree, who knows what heights it will take him once he advances further. That is, if he's allowed to advance any further. I know better than anyone else what it is like to see a rising shinobi beyond the expectations of anyone else, only for them to slaughtered in fear of their full abilities. He must know it as well, being born into the Branch Family...

######Shinro Kamotai

The monk who hails from one of the temples outside Konoha... their teachings are much different then those of typical shinobi, but no less effective in their own ways. I haven't seen anyone who has the techniques they possess, an interesting usage of the Ink Style to apply numerous effects with calligraphy. The limitless applications of such a technique gives him any range of answers for every situation. To pair him with Jin who searches for further limits to exceed while Shinro seeks to learn all that he is capable of makes for a very intriguing pair. I'll have to keep my eye on how they develop, as they'll certainly turn out to be a powerful Jonin.

######Yuma Kouda

She's so alone, even in her team. Even compared to all the other students, she doesn't fit in with them, just like how her Sharingan doesn't fit her. I can the difference between those chakras flowing inside her... poor thing. Do the others know about it? I can't believe that she'd be able to obtain one on her own, but that leaves numerous unknown possibilities on the how's and why's of such an event. Not being one of the great clans yet having an eye of such power always spells disaster. Wars have been started for less than stolen clan pride. I can't help but to see events playing out all too similar to back then...


##->Team 6<-

They are a very enigmatic group aren't they? Aside from their skills I know next to nothing about them. Unlike with Kiko's involvement in her team, it just seems as though they let little slip from behind their masks naturally. They were all born to be fighters whether they liked it or not. If Tsugumi can shield these children from those who covet their power... then I feel that she would fulfill her obligations as their mentor. They don't need to be taught in the ways of a shinobi, as they already had that forced onto them long before she took them under her wing.

######Tsugumi

She seems far older than the other Jonin... at the very least her mind is. That eye of her's is rumored to be able to see everything in the past, present, and even future. I'm not sure how much of it is simply legends sprouting up and what is actually a part of her dojutsu, but I don't doubt she can see many things the rest of us cannot. It's curious that she chooses to stay here rather than anywhere else when she can spectate the world from where she sits. Maybe it's just attachment to this place, or because Konoha acts as the hub where everything occurs. If I had those same eyes of hers, I think I'd just stay back in Kirigakure. There's just no place like home...

######Ghidorah

Another from Kirigakure... and I see that he's already been put through something terrible for their sake...
It's difficult... to accept one's role and responsibility in protecting your village. I would have given the world to live a life away from the troubles it gave me, but unfortunately there was no choice to deny the burden. To let others live their lives, that's the only thing we can do. Make sure that there will be no circumstances to create people for our role by living up to their expectations. I know it's a heavy weight to bear at a young age, especially when a child can't understand why fate led to this, but in time you learn to accept it.

######Junki Takenaga

Wood release is something I have not often seen in the hands of a genin, especially one who uses it so proficiently. I don't know what is more troublesome, to be born of great talent and forced into the life of a warrior, or to be molded into one by any means necessary. He takes the thought of enjoying life beyond the expectations of others. I am glad that he's able to even when those others try to make him use it as a weapon. He reminds me a lot of someone I knew, who wish to use his powers to create a world of peace not through destruction, but creation. His dream wasn't ever realized, but maybe now in this time of peace and with this generation...

######Sen Yamamoto

I thought that I had met a kindred soul today. When I walked past this young girl, she had looked at me with an expression I had never seen before. One of deep empathy, as though she could read my soul. Of course, it couldn't have been true, as she would have been repulsed by the beast sealed within me. Still, to see someone who can take notice of the tolls placed on their fellow shinobi... it is nice to see. It takes a great amount of courage to open your heart to a world who is just waiting to strike it. To be kind requires you to be strong, but in a paradoxical nature it is always the strong who trample on the weak. Its not really so strange when you consider that having such kindness is what is abnormal, but even so, I wish that it could have been something considered the default state of things...
