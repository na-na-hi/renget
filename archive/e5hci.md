BECOME: Repercussions of Sake

The Janny waited. The hot pocket spun in the microcwave. There were Lamys on the board. He didn't see them, but expected them, now for weeks. His warnings to the Mods were not listened to and now it was far too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
Janny was a Janitor for fourteen weeks. When he was a noob he posted and said to dad "I want to shitpost daddy"
Dad said "NO! YOU WILL BECOME LAMY!"
There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now on the front page of /vt/ he knew there were Lamys.
"This is the Mod," the readio crackered. "You must fight the Lamys!"
So the Janny gotten his hot pocket and went to his computer
"HE GOING TO BAN US," said the Lamys!
"I will make him become," said the Lamy and she threw sake. Janny tried to ban her. But no one could do capcha
"NO! I must kill the Lamys," he shouted!
The radio said "No, Janny. You are the Lamys."
And then, the Janny was a Lamy.
