>Ywn move to White-Tail, USA
>You'll never guess what species forms 94% of the population
>Deer chase you on your morning run because they want to lick your sweat and some of them only half jokingly call you "the walking salt-lick"
>You have to break up random antler-locking fights unusually frequently and it's not even really the season for it
>This only seems to happen around you
>Ywn get really under the weather and go to the doctor's
>Sure enough you've contracted Lyme's disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis all at the same time
>The Sound of Music and Bambi play in the local theater on rerun every week
>The crossing lights are a suggestion and you've come dangerously close to hitting a bunch of deer about 10 times now (you've been here for 9 days)

>Jokingly call a deer's antler's "blowjob handles"
>Fully expect to get gored for the comment
>Instead get a flustered (but not necessarily offended) rebuttal

>Deer bros ask you to rate whose horns are the nicest
>Intense arguing breaks out
>Eventually turns into an enormous brawl and all hell breaks loose
>You haven't said a single word yet

>Go to local bar for a drink
>Two stags are about to walk over to you when they suddenly lock eyes
>Oh man here we go...
>*CLONK*
>Two have locked horns and are yelling profanities
>"WHAT'D I TELL YOU TWO?! TAKE IT OUTSIDE! NO FIGHTING IN MY BAR"
>This is the 8th time the bartender has had to break up a fight (You've been here for an hour and a half)

Do you think human could make bank starting antler cleaning business in that area?
Imagine the velvet shedding season rush

>"Wait didn't I just help you with velvet shedding last week?"
>Deer, wringing his hands nervously with felt glued to his antlers
>"n-no"
