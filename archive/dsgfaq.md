#/DSG/ - Demon's/Dark Souls General
->**(and also bloodborne and sekiro and elden ring sometimes)**<-

To get the most of your enjoyment while browsing /dsg/, consider the following advice:
## General Info

- The game series is ancient, so don't expect too much PvE lore discussion or meta exploration. 

- This is primarily a PC general, and we mainly do PvP. Invaderphobia is not tolerated.

- Most activity in the general comes through invading, or doing fight clubs. 
	- FCs are mainly done in DS3 through **undead arena at sl125** (password **/dsg/**). Invasions can be at **sl90** or **sl125 pontiff**.

- People aren't owed replies, so don't get upset if someone responds without handing out a (you). No being selfish.

- We love our thread personalities... but if you don't, consider adding them to your filters.

## Useful things you should know before you start posting
**Webm making for retards**
- In order to easily make optimal webms, first download [Webm for Lazys](https://argorar.github.io/WebMConverter/) (shiny new version) or [Webm for Retards](https://gitgud.io/nixx/WebMConverter) (old 4cuck version). 
- To make your awesome webm, select your footage and then . First, use the tools to resize your footage to 960x540 resolution, and trim the time down to only the important moments. You can bump the resolution up to 1280x720 for shorter clips, although your bitrate may suffer. Next, enable VP9/Opus and set the filesize to about 4mb. Don't enable high quality mode unless you want the end of your clip to be cut off...

**Handy Resources**
- [Fextralife](https://darksouls3.wiki.fextralife.com/Dark+Souls+3+Wiki), whilst shoddy, is generally your best bet for basic information. Their wikis cover all the games to a decent level of quality. The comment sections can also be checked for info that the page might not mention. Do note that they shove their own twitch stream onto every page, and also pay to be the first result on google. 
- [Wikidot](http://darksouls3.wikidot.com/) is older and *much* less maintained than cuckstra, but also doesn't have any of their bullshit. Is a bit lacking in the visual department, but has overall better writing.
- For any bloodborne fans, use the [bloodborne-wiki](https://www.bloodborne-wiki.com/) over fextra or anything else. It has the highest quality by far.
- If you want to plan a build, [SoulsPlanner](https://soulsplanner.com/) is by far the best site. [MugenMonkey](https://mugenmonkey.com/) is objectively worse, but can be used for Bloodborne and Demon's Souls since soulsplanner lacks those.
- If you want more technical info, the [useful links google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cPyuF_Rjc5nSKPAXTCjSs4hFCf_N4BRsE4tLjDWAmoY/edit) contains an assortment of links to data sheets, breakpoint lists, calculators, builds, and more. And don't worry, it's on anonymous viewing mode.

**What mods should I download?**
First off, these mods will not get you banned so don't be stupid.
- [**Honest Merchant**:](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/607) Lets you effortlessly create builds from firelink shrine by selling every item in the game for a single soul, as well as providing respecs, infusements, and arena access. You should into the mod's settings to enable the experimental options and also make sold weapons scale with your upgrade level, which will save you a LOT of time. 
- [**Wex Dust**:](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/405) When alone, this mod turns your repair powder into the Wex Dust item. Using it allows you to search every area in the game for an invasion at once. This can also be done anywhere, meaning you could invade from the comfort of firelink shrine.  
- [**Blue Sentinels**:](https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723) This is a QoL cheat detection mod to help spot hackers with invalid stats or suspicious actions. It also automatically backs up your save files, and displays player information on the screen.
- [**DS3 Connection Info**:](https://github.com/tremwil/DS3ConnectionInfo) Useful program that displays character names, associated steam name, location, and ping of people in your game with a customizable overlay. Also allows you to enable borderless full-screen, although you need to have ds3 in windowed for it to work. Also has a basic ping filter to avoid invading people with subhuman net.
## Game Questions

- Read the relevant Pastebin or Google Doc for the game you are having trouble with. It'll probably answer your questions, although it is a bit outdated.
 
- Be specific as possible when asking questions, so that others know how to help you. No getting upset if you don't like the answer that you receive.
 
- If you're going to post a build, posting it through a Soulsplanner (or mugenmonkey if you're weird) screenshot is preferred. 
 
- If you want in-game help in any games, state your soul level, location, and what platform you're playing on. Beware that most users are PC players, and you'll probably be out of luck if you play on console.
