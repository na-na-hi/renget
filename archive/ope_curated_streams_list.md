!!!info -> ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png)  **/ope/'s Curated List for streams**  ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) <-
    This is a curate list of streams made with the collective effort of the Jailbirds from /ope/ after polling the general. The reason of why Jailbirds fell sticked to is multiple: the premises, the interactions with the other holomems, her voice, the dorkiness, the general calmness during the solo streams or the element of fun added during collabs and of course, a big part of the experience is watching her grow and improve over time. This is the reason why this list for the most recommended streams to watch was made for the coming new jailbirds - in order to fully appreciate the evolution of Nerissa from the 'Demon of Sound and Lover of Idol' to a full-pledge idol.

### ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Her debut
-----------------
[![](https://files.catbox.moe/8oyixc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg3SrFzHn9M)
Already presented at the front page of the library but still a good start to get yourself introduced to Nerissa and to gauge your expectations. To add on the first impressions that most of the Day 1 Jailbirds experienced, we'll advise you to also go listen to her first cover Love Me, Love Me, Love Me.

------------------
### ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Her core and gimmick content
While her content is focused on music with regular release of covers, stream-wise Nerissa leans into a rather chill approach of games choices, Nerissa also plays a lot of of horror games made on RPG Maker or associated. Each week so far, there has been at least one entry of horror game - mainly on Saturday thus the 'Spooky Saturday'. This includes so far [Hololive ERROR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ExD43Qo_9s), [The Witch's House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BdUa7aAgnM), [Mad Father part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0O6bMV2QSc) [& part 2](https://youtu.be/4qh-fL7EGLY) and finally [Resident Evil 8 : Village](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P05eG6iN4E)

#### ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Gaming
#####One-Off Stream
For the stream featured in the list so far, needless to say that two of them are garnering early legendary status with one finishing Getting Over It in one setting (despite having played on it 11 hours while never passing Orange Hell) and the other one giving birth to the general tendency to create [sound-posts](https://rentry.org/c793m) during and after each stream. One-Hand Clapping is also recommended as being a showcase of her vocals capacity before the first karaoke happened and after the release of Love Me, Love Me, Love Me.

#####Multi-parts / Series
Quite possibly the most chill form of content there is on Nerissa's part. It involves tons of farming, tons of fishing, tons of Nerissa's sound-posts too and most of all a sprinkle of zatsudan. While the Terraria streams should absolutely be in the collab section, Nerissa initiated a whole arc surrounding Terraria before Advent could go to Minecraft due to the collab ban for Advent regarding JP & ID and the servers (old and new) being all-in-one. Terraria also permitted interactions will other ENs aside from Advent.

#### ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Karaokes
While music-producing will be her core content outside of the conventional streams, karaokes is also a feature that will be expected and scrutinized. Those are also a good mean to follow the effort of Nerissa to the 'Road-of-Becoming-a-Full-Pledged-Idol' as per gaining confidence in front of a big crowd and seeing her having fun with it despite the scuff. Also see [Demonry of Sound](https://rentry.org/karaokes_songs_v0) rentry for the other karaokes and the music production.

#### ![Image description](https://files.catbox.moe/f9inkg.png) Solo - Variety (Zatsudan)
While there is yet to be a purely focused stream or there bits-and-pieces of zatsudan in pretty much every stream so far (be it in the middle of it and in the closing parts), the Unpacking is the closest we got for a purely focused Zatsudan with all the current stream available. With a post-debut Q&A during the stream and while it's still the very first stream, it might still be worth a watch for the Q&A parts.
