#Bunsy the bunny in Summer isn't Everything. (PT2)
##Still featuring Riley the Racoon

**Spagonia, South West 16:10** 

Inside the egg Carrier, Eggman prepares himself to enjoy a nice relaxing beach all alone for himself with orbot and cubot following him.
O:"Dr.Eggman Sir, our robots report no more creature in the beaches, it's can be considered succesfully been emptied."
C:"There have been some who have been rebelling, these people, as ordered,  have captured inside the carrier as prisoner."
E:"Aaaand? i don't see you 2 saying it as a satisfying result so i am assuming you have more to say."
O:"Well... out of curiosity, why do all of this to enjoy some sun when you can just grab a deserted island?"
E:"Quite simple Realy, after everything that is happening i need to sit down and take a small distraction from my current unsavory situation to get my thoughs in order."
C:"But, wouldn't still making it on a deserted island be less costly?"
E:"What's the fun in that? and besides there is the chance that Sonic could be there behind me are pretty high."
O:"But... Dr.eggman, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever"
E:"Trust me Orbot, I had too many events where that happens, way too many to count."
*Cubot and Orbot look at each other in confusion then return to Eggman.*
E:"Oh and... I though maybe enjoying having ancient Spagonian architecture behind me could lead me some... inspiration." *Eggman says with an evil grin*
C:"Oh... t-that makes sense..."
Orbot shrugs... sometimes he even wonders why did he bother to build him in the first place.

**Spagonia, South West 16:25 Riley perspective**

Riley the racoon climbs the trash of the egg carrier, in her search has lead to find a lot of Trash compacting systems, eventually after dodging many of these she ends up a Supply warehouse area of the egg carrier.
R:"This is Riley, I am inside to what it seems to be a warehouse, i am seeing crates of equipment."
==T:"Excelent Riley, try to get a map on the area to see where you are to your objective, you shouldn't be too far."==
R:"Roger that, FoxBoy, il see to get you some info if i can."
As Riley exits the so called warehouse, sensors sends signal of movement in the area...
a robot seems to have recieved this signal and as output... it turns itself on.

**Spagonia, South West 16:26 Bunsy perspective**

Bunsy the bunny after succesfuly searching for a safe spot, starts to head wheel house.
However things don't go well as soon as she's out of her safe spot, robots found her, and start to aim on her.
With quick reflex she notices the alarm, Bunsy doesn't have much choice in the matter. 
Bunsy has to move in instinct, not the one that attracts the males though, the other well known one.
***Run fast***
and as quick as a rabbit can get, she moves the robot firing line to be directly into the alarm system, and then jumps
out of the way as soon as the robot fires, the alarm was out of commision, allowing bunsy to bring up the real guns.

**Spagonia, South West 16:29 Eggman perspective**

Eggman is enjoying a relaxing rest in the beaches of spagonia, with the screaming of people still in the back, though not as much to bug him.
However not everything seems to be going right, or at least that's what it seems seeing the expression of Cubot as he arrives.
E:"What do you want Cubot?"
C:"Some Imput sectors to drink liquids so that i can enjoy how tea tastes?"
E:"No, no, no you got it wrong, what do you want to tell me is what i asked."
C:"Oh, uhh i have heard some target reports from the eggcarrier defense system, It reports that Tails was flying nearby the tornado."
E:"WHAT?!"
C:"I haven't got into the weird part yet, it reports to have used an arm to throw 2 unidentified threats in the ship."
E:"Did tails enter the EggCarrier?"
C:"Well no sir but-"
E:"Then we are fine, The EggCarrier has witnessed worse back when i tried to control chaos, and the new defences should be able to deal with the intruders."
O:"Didn't chaos destroy the eggcarrier with a laser?"
E:"That was the EggCarrier2, not the first, Now don't disturb me with this information unless it really becomes a problem."
C:"Sir, yes lord eggman sir!"

**Spagonia, South West 16:31 Riley perspective**

Riley has been exploring the area but no success on finding the map, or the internal system in the area, looking around she sees some computers in the area, then she gets an idea.

R:"FoxBoy, come in!"
==T:"Something wrong Riley?"==
R:"Nope, rather i have an idea on how to get us a map of the area."
==T:"What's your idea here?"==
R:"If i use the USB you handed me to allow you to access the area database, maybe you can find a map of the area from there."
==T:"That... can work actually, but i fear it might increase security for Bunsy, speaking of..."==
==T:"Bunsy come in how is your situatio-"==
==B:"TAILS I AM IN KIND OF A RUSH RIGHT NOW, IL CONTACT YOU LATER." the message is heard with the sounds of bullets and missiles being fired.==
R:"Well sh- i mean poop, if Bunsy is in trouble i need to help her now, il have to connect the USB."
==T:"Wait, we could make it worse if we do it."==
R:"Pleasure BEFORE Business, Tails, i don't care if this makes our problem worse, Bunsy might be tough egg to crack for the robots, but i will be the one to crack it open!"
==T:"... okaaay..."==
R:"I connected the USB, see if you can see from this."
==Tails takes a deep breath T:"Alright, nobody said it was going to be easy anyway..." Some typing sounds can be heard on the radio.==
==T:"Okay, i got a map of the area, you are 2 floors under the internals, you should be able to catch up with Bunsy as there is a staircase leading to the wheelhouse."==
R:"Alright, thanks Tails, il move in quick so be ready."
==T:"Ready... for what?"==
R:"What else than the fireWOAH"
==T:"Fire what now? Riley what happend there? RILEY?"==

**Spagonia, South West 16:32 Bunsy perspective**

Stopping the alarm did jack shit apperently because the number of robots just increased, The best option Bunsy is to run in the wheel house and PRAY that the robots can't keep up for long.
Admittedly that is just a very generous possibility and Bunsy isn't the kind of gal to test that faith.
So the best way to approach the situation is to bring in the big guns, she held her Burst Rocket launcher for moments where shit hits the fan, but before the consequnces of said shit hitting the fan would arrive, she is going to be needing a good target to make good use of the moment and quick, Bunsy doesn't know how much she can keep up, but the closer to stop, the better.
She runs towards the wheelhouse, dodging projectile being shot and then she sees her way out.
There is a Gas pipe, (probably for the captains quarters), Bunsy aims at the gas pipe and fires.

**Spagonia, South West 16:33 Eggman perspective**

C:"DR.EGGMAN SIR, WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS, WE HAVE CAPTURED 1 OF THE 2 THREATS IN THE ARE-."
*Cubot gets punched in the head*
E:"**STOP SHOUTING!!**"
*after a small pause*
E:"Alright... as i said to you two tincans about the EggCarrier, with their new and improved defenses, this kind of events can be dealt with itself, leaving me to relax in peace and..."
*The EggCarier does an incredibly loud explosion behind eggman turning his proud expression into a maddening one.*
E:"...quiet."
*Silence fills the beach as residents look shocked and scared of the events that are unfolding*
E:"Orbot, get the flamethrower... i am not feeling myself today."
O:"Y-y-yes master Eggman."
Orbot drags CubeBot with him.
E:"Alrigh, your rodents... i don't know who you might be, but let there be know, you have decided a bad day to test my patience."
