 I have a typing quirk that mainly has me replacing words with numbers, shorting word, spacing out punctuation, typing exactly how I speak, and maybe double spacing. My typing quirk fluctuates and is either mostly never used or changing *constantly*.

 I make kms/kys jokes ( mainly only with my friends ) but if you're uncomfortable I will stop. I don't use tone tags that frequently but I will if you need them. I am dsylexic please ask me if I type something and you didnt understand. I can be very blunt and miss social cues. I am very offstandish and very nervous around new people and that can lead me to lash out of anxiety/fear please be paitent with me and approach me gently.
