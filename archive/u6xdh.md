#Relationship Chart

Inatsu Hikuhei, "The Bull of Konoha" -
*Ray is standing silently in Inatsu's office.*
"As you may know, Lord Third, I have no reason to bother you unless you ask for me to speak first!"
"...That's nice, Ray."
Of course, Ray respects Inatsu more than anyone else.  This is because of how inspiring Inatsu is, and also how he feels that he relates to Inatsu. I believe that we decided that the Second Hokage was the mentor of the current generatiom, and the Third was his mentor, so Ray obviously respects him a lot. Ray will never offer to help with his paperwork, though. If Inatsu asks, he'll do it. But he'll never offer. He also hasn't submitted the "Geanology Team" paperwork, and probably never will.

Akuryoga Mitiru, "The Old Demon" -
*At Lord Second's Grave.*
"I'm glad that monster is dead..."
Aluryoga is *not* dead, apparently. Ray probably hates him a whole lot because he killed the Second, so when he learns that he is alive he'll probably want him dead very badly. Let's hope Inatsu gets his get back soon.

Yusuke Hiramatsu, "The Third Kazekage" (he deserves a better title, how about "Worm Bearer"? That sounds cool) - 
*He met Yusuke while he was at Suna.*
"It is my pleasure to meet you, Kazekage. I must thank you for keeping the sand worm attacks to a minimum!"
"...You're welcome."
Ray thinks Suna is MESSED UP. He didn't exactly know that Yusuke was a puppet, but after his stay he has a suspicion. He feels a bit bad for him, because he is obviously not having a good time, but Suna and Konoha have been a little bit nicer lately, so he doesn't want to make the people in charge upset. He'll just silently shame the Suna elders just like he does Konoha's.

Taiki, "The Trunk Thrower" -
*After a mission that Ray helped with.*
"It was pretty smart of you to put an explosive tag on that log!"
"It was my pleasure, Taiki."
Ray and Taiki have a coworker relationship. They get lunch every now and then. Ray honestly hates him less than other people. Even after he makes a comment that (is normal to everyone else) upsets Ray, his comtempt levels will go back down to normal in due time. However, he does NOT want Taiki to be Hokage. If he does become Hokage? Ray will forever curse the village elders.

Konna, "The Shady Foreigner" -
*The first time Ray and Konna ever met.*
"So... I heard you're from Ame. What's it like?"
"Wet."
"Good to know."
Ray has no strong opinions on him. He's fine with foreingers, as long as they aren't obnoxious. But... they really don't get a chance to talk much. I'm sure Ray will appreciate that he will never have to go to Ame to do his geanology, because Ame probably hates Konoha. If Ray realizes he's gonna try and kidnap a kid he's gonna get the other A Ranks to jump him, though.

Mika Katsumi, "Opioid Smoke Girl" -
I'll update this for when she gets a rival and picks a village.

Hakumo Ikari, "Kitsune Vixen" -
*After one of his meetings with the Hakumo.*
"Have a nice day, ladies."
"Aren't you going to say goodbye to our little friends, as well?"
"(*Are they not **ladies**?*) Uh... have a nice day... friends."
Ray and Ikari have a hostile relationship, but he at least respects her from a business standpoint. He doesn't go out of his way to see her on his own time, but he doesn't whine about it when he has to for business. If they end up on the same mission, he'll be as complacent as he can. He knows not to mess around on a mission. He'll be upset if she becomes Hokage. He's already upset because he knows she has a chance.

Kurumi Yamagumo, "Prideful Puppeteer" -
*A meeting about her clan, where Kurumi happened to be present.*
"How do you like Konoha since you've been here?"
"...Hm? Oh, don't mind me. I'm leaving, I have important things to do!"
Ray can tell when someone is speaking down to him. He harbors quite some contempt for Kurumi, for a couple reasons. The first is that she brought an entire part of a clan that he is now supposed to chronicle. The second is that she's a foreinger that is, in his opinion, quite obnoxious. The final reason is that she has NEVER stayed for a meeting with him. Not once. He always finds her going out the door whenever he enters. It annoys him. He understands it, but it annoys him.

Amami Kai, "The Tide" -
*Ray once went to Yashino on a mission, where he met Kai and teamed up with him.*
"You did good out there!"
"Yes, and you did fine as well."
Ray has nothing bad to say about Kai. They met once, and worked together on a mission. They fought on the same side. It wasn't really eventful (except for the fact that he enjoyed the pineapples), but Ray is not opposed to going back to Yashino and working together again. He's also very impressed with Welcoming Approach!

Mutsuo Aburame "Hopeful Fourth" (I am NOT calling him "Bug Guy") -
*After a mission that Ray helped with.*
"You did well, Mutsuo. The Aburame truly have an impressive technique."
"You bet!"
Ray is all for Mutsuo's dream of boosting the Aburame above the other clans. He doesn't hate them, because they don't have a kekkai genkai! They still have important elders, however, and he hates them to death. He would be fine with Mutsuo becoming the Fourth Hokage, but he's DEFINITELY not doing his paperwork, even if he asks. He also thinks bugs are cool, if a little gross.

Goro Tsuchigumo, "Snare Spider" -
*After a misison that Ray helped with.*
"(*Don't puke, don't puke...*) So... is it difficult having six arms?"
"Not really."
Ray has a distaste for Goro. He sees him as spoiled due to his carefree attitude and being a prodigy to a clan with a kekkai genkai, but he respects him as a ninja anyway. He really dislikes the Tsuchigumo because he thinks bugs are a little gross, and he finds the fact that they produce webbing and have six arms *really* off-putting.

Nara Suzura, "Cowardly Dragon Host" -
*During a tutoring session.*
"Suzura-san, I know you can do better, right? Just a little more!"
*She didn't say anything.*
Ray has helped her with her Typhoon Style occasionally. So, he knows that she is quite impressive for a genin. However, he HATES the Nara. Those high and mighty buffoons are always going on about their "importance to the village." He hopes they die out. He especially hates Suzura's father, because he's a child abusing scumbag who he has to actually talk to. He has some sympathy for Suzura, but it's overshadowed by his pure hatred for the Nara. If a Nara becomes Hokage in his lifetime he might do something drastic. He knows not much about the Chakra Beast, but he suspects that it's a scumbag as well. ~~He totally doesn't see himself in Suzura in any way at all.~~

Oscar, "The Outlander" -
*They met exactly once.*
"So... did... you catch a lot of fish?"
"Yes."
"...I guess I'll leave you be, now."
Ray wasn't even sure Oscar was real when they first met. He just saw some weird looking guy fishing. He told what he saw to some people at Konoha and they just said "Oscar? He doesn't do much." Anyway, he doesn't really have anything to do with him.

Kambara Soue, "Frosty Kunoichi" -
*During a tutoring session.*
"...Kekkai tota... I can't believe such a thing exists..."
"...Are you alright?"
Ray is amazed at kekkai tota. He has the same opinion on Soue that he does on many young clan members with special genetics; he thinks of them as spoiled brats. He is especially envious of her Frost Style because he knows that it is something he can't replicate as well as he can others (Dollar Store Style!), and he can't learn about it as easily because the Kambara are so secretive about something so rare. He does respect how profesional she is.

Tengu Yumiko, "Corvine Archer" -
*Guess what? During a tutoring session.*
"Yumiko-san! You have amazing eye sight! For this test, you must find a needle I have hid somewhere-"
"Found it."
"...G-good job."
Usual opinion on a kid with a kekkai genkai. He's a bit annoyed by the Tengu clan, as they are foreingers WITH kekkai genkai, but he finds them about the same as other clans. He can tell that Yumiko doesn't like him and her elders very much, and he thinks it's hilarious. He also can tell that she has a rivalry with other clans, and is completely fine stoking that fire. Although, maybe he would try and stop her before it goes to far ~~and she ends up like him.~~

Takatsui Inukasai, "The Infernal Painter" -
*TAKE A GUESS WHERE!*
"Takatsui-san, to pratice Blaze Style, burn some mud!"
"That's it?"
"Yep, just.... work on your stamina!"
Another kekkai genkai kid. The Inukasai have gained no particularly egregious scorn from him, just the usual. He dislikes Takatsui a whole lot, personally. He's been on the receiving end of a few fits once or twice. Ōbun once ruined his tea, as well. Ōbun better keep one eye open. He can tell that he has an envious streak. It reminds him of himself...

Eisei Hokan, "Timid Grinner" -
*At a meeting with the Hokan clan, he talked withe Eisei.*
"So... you guys got a lot of wealth, eh?"
"Yes, sir!"
"...Lucky..."
The Hokan are wealthy. Surprisingly, Ray isn't that envious of wealth. Of course, he doesn't like such a powerful clan for the same reasons he doesn't like other powerful clans. He is completely fine with Eisei, they don't interact much, but when they do he's fine with him. He can tell that he needs some fight in him, though. Maybe he'll try and work on that with him, if he gets the chance. Ray didn't have much fight in him when he was younger, either.
Kazuo, "The Unarmed" -
*Tutoring.*
"...We can work at your pace, Kazuo."
"Thanks, I guess."
Poor kid. Doesn't even have a clan for Ray to be upset at. He doesn't know where he got... unarmed, but he's willing to go on a mission to find out the truth! When he gets the time.
Sarurata, "The Retarded Orphan" -
*At Sarurata's favorite fishing spot!*
"I lo~o~ove fishing!"
"That's nice, Sarurata."
I don't think anyone knows about Uchihajang? Otherwise, the village wouldn't be sending him on missions. I imagine Uchihajang would be a massive threat if he ever went on a rampage. As for Sarurata, Ray doesn't bother him with anything, really. It's another issue he has with the village elders that they force the poor kid to go on stealth missions, but he is impressed with his camouflage.

Zeiji Gorobuyo, "Toad Nemesis" -
*Tutoring.*
"I heard you don't like toads, Zeiji-san! For this test..."
*Dumps a box of toads on him.*
Zeiji is one of the easiest kids to mess with. Just, throw a toad at him on occasion. He kinda feels bad about it, but... he's gotta get over it eventually. He thinks the Gorobuyo clan is idiotic for their petty rivalry, and he secretly hopes they would just make up. When two clans hate each other, they definitely slow politics down.

Kenzo Nakamura, "Gluttonous Dragon" -
*At a ramen vendor.*
"Geez, kid! How much more are you gonna eat?"
"Mmf, I dummo."
He has nothing in particular to say about Kenzo. He thinks he's a good kid. He gets a bit annoyed when he cleans out his favorite ramen place... but it's his money.

#Speciality Jutsu List
Because why not?

"Earth Style: Lava Imitation Burning Mud Jutsu!"
Using Earth Style, he creates mud! Adding Fire Style... he heats the mud up! Then he shoots it as a wave! Very impressive. He can also do other things, like cover someone in it!

"Earth Style: Slime Imitation Sticky Mud Jutsu!"
He just makes some particularly sticky mud. He can make someone stick with it... he can... use it to stick things to other things...

"Paper Style: Ice Imitation Heat Shield Jutsu!"
One of his jutsu that he became known for in Suna. You produce a parasol made of paper! He actually can use it in combat, by hiding paper seals inside the parasol. Filling it with paper seals that contain water for use to help with his mud is actually a common use of it for him. Another use is hiding paper bombs or shurikens in it.

"Muddy Paper Style: Ice Imitation Hail Freeze Jutsu!"
He shoots out very fast paper shurikens! However, his "freeze" function of it is quite interesting: by storing mud in paper seals he uses to make the shurikens, he unleashes the seals and covers the opponent in mud, "freezing" them. He patted himself on the back for this one.

"Paper Style: Magnet Imitation Dust Storm Jutsu!"
Ray takes out a paper seal, and it unleashes a bunch of little pieces of paper that are sharp enough to cut things. He can also use a variant that unleashes mud instead, in order to crush things. He calls that one "Earth Style: Magnet Imitation Dust Storm Jutsu!"

"Snail Fang: Bone Imitation Pulse Dance Jutsu!"
He copies Shikotsumyaku, by erecting metal spikes on his body, and using them to attack. He knows a good deal about taijutsu, but he isn't a master. Don't get the wrong idea, he isn't a slouch either. This is also how he copies Steel Style and Carbon Style, due to the similar toughness.

"Snail Fang: Crystal Imitation Cutting Prison Jutsu!"
He erects metal spikes around the opponent, trapping them in a hard and sharp prison. His Snail Fang is incredibly durable, on par with the real Crystal Style. It is also made of metal, so he can course lightning through it if he has enough chakra.

The following are his "unique" moves, that aren't really an imitation of anything. He uses plenty of paper seals.

"Snail Fang: Sealed Cutting Bomb Jutsu!"
Basically a paper tag filled with sharp spikes.

"Earth Style: Explosive Dome Bomb Jutsu!"
Put himself and the opponent in a dome of mud, so they can't escape. He then detonates paper explosives. He tries to avoid the part where he's in the dome, if he can.

"Paper Style: Shade Cover Jutsu!"
He throws up a large amount of normal paper in the air, and they float there for quite some time. He usually uses this in case the sun is in his eyes, but he occasionally uses it offensively, like having some of the paper be sealed with sharp spikes.

"Earth Style: Shaped Mud Wall Jutsu!"
Normal Mud Wall Jutsu, but with a twist! He is far better at shaping the mud.

"Snail Fang: Sealed Metal Coffin Jutsu!"
His ultimate technique. After covering his opponent in paper, he skewers them with metal spikes. An added benefit is that if the opponent survives the spikes, they then have to get out of the tight paper!
