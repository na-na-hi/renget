#Heaven, Hell and the USDA 2: Divine Intervention

"Well yes, but I'm not evil or anything! I'm neutral, you know!" Towa pleaded as she looked Kanata in the eyes and folded her hands, but she only got a cold stare in response. 
Towa shifted herself around in Kanata's arms to make herself look as non-threatening and pitiful as possible as Kanata's face began to shine and she spread her wings. They had been pitifully small before, but now grew to be much wider and longer. The angel would have looked more beautiful than dangerous - if it wasn't for the many eyes that began to open on her star-shaped halo.

Towa, in turn, had her heartbeat become inhumanly erratic. She also felt itchy in the spots where her fangs, horns and wings would be - if she unleashed herself. Her tail emitted a dark aura, her eyes began to light up with green hellfire, her instinct screamed at her to prepare for battle...but Towa suppressed the urge, just in time. She had sworn to never be a violent devil, to leave hell and all that it stood for behind. And this wasn't just some random loyalist, either - this was Coco's close friend. Towa lowered her eyes, whose fire went out as she managed to keep herself untransformed.

Kanata wondered whether Towa was more of a weakling or more of a coward. But she couldn't exactly go around and harm defenseless beings, so she decided to grant the devil in her arms mercy - for now.
"Neutral? We'll see about that...don't try anything now, or it'll be over with you." Kanata's sounded even more menacing than she looked as she bent her legs and lowered her arms. Towa didn't offer any rebuttal or resistance as she was put on the floor like a doll, her naked back and butt coming in contact with the cold tile floor.

"Lay on your stomach."

Towa obeyed, turning around and laying down as submissively as she could. Now her other side felt like it was freezing, but she did not dare to move or talk; only her thoughts were racing. What was Kanata planning? Was fighting back the only way to get out of this, after all? Would Coco help her little devil slut out? 

"Spread your limbs, then freeze from the head downwards." 

Towa's quickly obeyed the command, stretching her arms and legs out as if she were tied to the X-cross in the bedroom again. Towa being humiliated by being made to lie on the floor in one of the most pathetic poses possible should have been very arousing, but the danger of serious violence ruined the mood for all three.

Coco's brows had furrowed and her tail had stopped moving as soon as Kanata's mood had changed, but Coco's ignorance of divine politics and her trust in Kanata had kept her silent - until now. 
"Come on, pissy prideful tenshi! If you want Towa to leave, fine. But don't judge her in the name of God or something - she's a good girl, ya know? I trust her, and I'm not a naive dumbass. Not all devils-"

The dragon was much larger and spoke much louder, but even without seeing the scene Towa could tell that the angel was somehow more imposing. Kanata placed her right foot on Towa's back and tail before shifting her attention to Coco. Towa groaned, feeling her tail squished and her body pressed against the floor as Kanata fixed Towa to the floor as strongly as she could. At least Kanata wasn't very heavy. 

"Coco...you just forgot, didn't you? The one rule, the one I told you right from the start?" Kanata stared into the dragon's eyes, reading her roommate like a book. Coco was often worse at hiding what a mess she could be than Kanata was herself...stupid sexy dragon.

After a few seconds, Coco's eyes and mouth sprang open in shock only to go back to a feigned normal - just like Kanata expected. The dragon avoided the angel's gaze as she tried to shuffle past Kanata into the kitchen, speaking in a voice that was very cutesy for her standards. Few, if any, male dragons could have tamed Coco so successfully that she would have sound meek like this.
"Well...I don't know all this heaven and hell stuff, you know?" Coco's demeanor caught Towa's attention despite the circumstances. "I'm a dragon from overseas, so how about I make us some nice burgers while you and Towa sort out your differen- OWWW! KANATA, PLEASE! OW! FUCK!"

Kanata had stopped Coco in her tracks by snatching her snatch and giving it a hearty squeeze, eliciting an unusually high-pitched and pathetic squeal from Coco. Towa was reminded of how she usually sounded when Coco played rough with Towa's sensitive parts.
"Don't play dumb. There was one rule - no creatures from hell. Did you forget it, or was this harlot just too hot?"

"Ahh...I forgot, 100%! It's hard to remember rules when there's always new ones, y'know? No devils, no one dressed up as a banana, no males, no one dressed up as an axolotl, no one dressed up as a male, no escorts pretending to be one of your 3D waifus, no...OWWW!!! I MEAN IDOLS! One of your amazing, admirable, awesome idols!" Coco caught her breath, continuing with a bit more calm. "Look, I'm sorry! It was my fault. Just have some mercy on Towa...and my clit, too. Kanatan, this isn't as fun as how we usually play!"

"That's because this situation isn't entirely play, Coco. Sorry." Kanata didn't look upwards too kindly, but she released the dragon's punished pussy from her grip. "Go into the kitchen and make those burgers. I'll get to your punishment after the devil is gone." 
Kanata delivered a meaty slap to Coco's ass before it disappeared into the kitchen. Even though Towa couldn't tell how much of it was playful and how much was genuine punishment, hearing Coco scream and beg made Towa forget the foot on her naked back, the position she was in, and even the danger for a moment.

Once Coco had left, one hand closing the kitchen door and one between her legs, Kanata knelt down next to the prostrate devil. She shoved her right hand between Towa and the floor to grab Towa's left breast; Towa braced for a painful squeeze like the one Coco's crotch had been subjected to, but the grip was only mildly painful.

"What are you doing? Please, I didn't know you lived here. I'm an honest devil! I'm the least evil devil in the world!"

"You might be that, after I'm done purging. Maybe your hellish heart isn't sinful enough to burst."

Towa controlled herself as best as she could, closing her eyes and clenching her teeth as her life flashed before her eyes - was her heart of Evil? She had never really done much in hell. In the human world she had been mischievous, cowardly and selfish a few times...but that wasn't especially evil, wasn't it? That's just how humans were, Towa told herself. It would be unfair to jud-

"aaaAAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHA! OH MY GOD, WHAT'S THIS? PLEASE, HAHA, STOP! PLEASE! AAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!" Towa's thoughts were rudely interrupted as she felt like legions of the softest feathers imaginable were passing over her body, making her laugh harder than she ever had. It was wave after wave of an unbelievably brutal tickle assault on her whole body, something Towa was weak against to boot.
And this was much worse than the tickling Coco had used to justify a need to "correct" Towa's "disrespectful attitude" before (the correction was usually done through spanking Towa in all kinds of places, or torturing her most sensitive areas with clamps that felt much more evil than Towa could ever be). 

Kanata's divine tickle torture felt so much worse, in fact, that Towa escaped it by fainting after only thirteen seconds. 

Kanata, puzzled by the devil's reaction, removed her hand from Towa's left breast. Towa's elegant mediums were almost as fun to grope as Coco's massive milkers, and the begging just now had tickled Kanata's fancy. But the angel didn't have a hard time pushing her naughtier thoughts to the back of her head, given what had just happened. Why had her divine judgement worked like this on Towa? Had Coco been right - was this really a non-evil devil?

The small angel touched Towa all over, somewhat succeeding in focusing on her sixth sense rather than what she saw and felt. But there was still little Evil to be found. Kanata stood up and took a step back, in the corridor and in her mind. Did this actually turn this bad situation into something...good? She had technically purged any Evil as she was required to, and having to study this unusual case was a perfect reason to keep an eye, and more, on Coco's newest catch. She couldn't exactly be friends with a devil, but she could certainly oversee and discipline one...
