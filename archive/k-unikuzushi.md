-> Scaramouche, also known as Kunikuzushi (Japanese: 国崩) or by his Fatui codename "Balladeer," was the Sixth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers and one of Genshin Impact's antagonists. ([Source](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Scaramouche)) <-

-> Urban Dictionary: [Scaranation](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scaranation), [Scaramouche](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Scaramouche), [Kunikuzushi](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=kunikuzushi), [Kabukimono](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Kabukimono). <-

-> Affiliations: Fatui. Formerly the sixth of the eleven Fatui Harbingers. <-
-> Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/mBj7WDsMhvc) explaining his whole story until version 3.3 of Genshin Impact. <-

-> One of his names, Scaramouche, comes from [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche), just like the other Fatui Harbingers' names come from other [commedia del'arte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte) characters. <-
-> =="Which I do like how him being a puppet of sorts ties into the idea of the old theater Scaramouche, because apparently there was a show that used puppets and a Scaramouche character got his head punched off so much it made the term mean (somewhat) puppets with extendable necks. Imagine punching Scaramouche (which you probably can’t lol) and his head literally just popping off." *- I just copypasted this from my friend Castiel idk how to rephrase it. Thanks Castiel shoutout*== <-

-> Here is an explanation of **Scaramouche in puppetry** for clarification: <-
-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/rqcffv.gif) Scaramouche is one of the great characters in the Punch and Judy puppet shows (a performative art with roots in commedia dell'arte). In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term scaramouche has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks. ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaramouche))<-

-> ~~Oh, also, he was described as beautiful by the game before so if you think he's ugly you're just wrong. Leave my man be he did no wrong to deserve being called that.~~ <-

->｡ﾟ•┈୨♡୧┈•ﾟ｡<-

##### -> Here are the full consequences of his deletion from Irminsul: ([Source](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Scaramouche))<-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Ei and Yae Miko's "About Kunikuzushi" voice-overs and Tartaglia's "About The Balladeer" voice-over are removed. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Nahida's "About The Balladeer" voice-over is not removed, even temporarily. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Mikhail and Lyudmila's dialogue regarding the recent events in Sumeru is slightly altered to discuss Signora instead of Scaramouche, and Mikhail mentions that the Sixth Harbinger's seat has been vacant for hundreds of years. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Viktor's dialogue about Scaramouche in the World Quest Equivalent Exchange is changed to instead talk about Tartaglia. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Viktor's mention of Scaramouche in the Mondstadt Commission Return to Days of Winter is removed. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Tatarasuna's known history from 400 years ago, including the Tatarasuna Mystery, was changed to eliminate the kabukimono's presence. The extra tragedies related to him that Dottore brought about due to the mission arranged by Pierro and his interest in the Kabukimono, which Scaramouche erased himself to try and prevent, still occurred but through slightly different means (as Dottore had already been ordered by Pierro to sabotage the operations of Tatarasuna). The Traveler personally verifies many of these changes during A Dance of Destruction and The Kabukimono's Finale immediately following Scaramouche's attempted removal of himself. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Text regarding a "wandering eccentric" from the Rather Aged Notes in Inazuma is removed. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) In Aqaba's report, the suspicious figure changes from from the "puppet" to a mechanic from Fontaine (Dottore as Escher). <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Niwa Hisahide is known to have died with another swordsmith, both having jumped into the furnace to purge Tatarasuna of its filth and stabilize the furnace. In the original version, Niwa intended to sacrifice himself to stabilize the furnace using Dottore's device, only for Dottore to murder him and extract his heart from his body to power the device. Niwa's fate remained a mystery to the general populace, who believed he had fled with his family. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Interestingly, Aqaba and Sawada's documents still regard Niwa as having disappeared under mysterious circumstances in the revised history, even though Amenoma Tougo gives a clear story regarding Niwa's fate. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) The fall of most of the Raiden Gokaden, including the Case of the Eccentric, was heavily altered. The Traveler personally verifies many of these changes during A Dance of Destruction immediately following Scaramouche's attempted removal of himself. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) The fall of the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju and the near-fall of the Isshin are now attributed to an indiscriminate murder spree by the head of the Hyakume Clan, who was a descendant of the swordsmith who died with Niwa Hisahide in the revised history and inherited the swordsmith's son's resentment towards Inazuma. In the original history, they suffered from various seemingly natural misfortunes orchestrated by Scaramouche. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) Kaedehara Yoshinori's Letter, a quest item from Hues of the Violet Garden, is changed to describe the encounter with the vengeful Hyakume bladesmith instead of the encounter with Scaramouche. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) While not confirmed, it is possible that the Case of the Eccentric is no longer referred to as such, as "eccentric" was used to describe Scaramouche but not the vengeful Hyakume bladesmith. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) While he could not eliminate himself from Teyvat and continued to exist as the Wanderer, he did lose his memories of his previous identities since those were successfully removed. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/neb34v.gif) The Wanderer still knew himself to be a puppet even before his memories were restored. Further details on his and others' perceptions, such as Ei's perception, of the Wanderer's existence as a puppet are unknown. <-

##### -> Regarding Scaramouche and [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Rhapsody) ([Source](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Scaramouche)) <-

->![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif) Various aspects of Scaramouche's character, particularly pertaining to his appearance during Unreconciled Stars, reference the lyrics of the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" by British rock band, Queen, which has a famous line that goes "Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?" <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif) The soundtrack that plays during Scaramouche's first appearance in the event is named "Ominous Fandango." <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif) The lyrics mention "Beelzebub," an alternative form of Beelzebul, who is Scaramouche's creator. The song's speaker addresses his "mama" several times, which may be an interpretation of the type of relationship between Beelzebul and Scaramouche. <- 

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif) "Thunderbolt and lightning" are mentioned in the lyrics, which is symbolic of Inazuma, the Electro region, where Scaramouche originates from. <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif)The lyrics "Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?" show the song's speaker having doubts about the natural order of the world. The song also makes reference to Galileo Galilei, who was known for challenging beliefs about the astronomical model during his time. Towards the end of Unreconciled Stars, Scaramouche makes a discovery that prompts him to declare: "The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie." <-

-> ![](https://files.catbox.moe/8ymq9v.gif) The lyrics "I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all." is referenced in his attempt to retroactively prevent his own birth in the Archon Quest Inversion of Genesis. In the Wanderer's character teaser, he specifically says the line "No, in fact... I wish I'd never been born at all" in despair after the death of his third friend due to his illness. <-
