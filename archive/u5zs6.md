##My Mods

Here's all the mods I've made personally. The exception are my patches. Don't use the ones on my nexus account. Anything else if you needed it you already have it.

A Small Winterhold Overhaul: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67034
A small overhaul of Winterhold adding some custom houses where ruined houses used to be. Intended for light load orders with minimal city overhauls. I want to make patches for it some day but for now it's standalone and quite incompatible with things. Originally made by request of an anon.

Lucien - Extremely Cursed Replacer: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65651
Replaces the appearance of the dorky and talkative Lucien follower with the appearance of the Adoring Fan.

TESG Menu Replacer: https://mega.nz/file/ENQgXCaD#telF4r3CugVa6dubGMVH5_RD0KgCmiK2c-RZiVjwCEI
Replaces the main menu in Skyrim with a number of memes from /tesg/ over the years and a cover of Call to Magic by HoneyBee on Otomotone

Lorekeeper Follower: https://mega.nz/file/5IxHGCDI#dNvg3L7OrOCM4l8mwTgUd8IKGPwPwPjteSFM8QvrB5A
Moth Priest turned Kroger Gandalf follower with her own confusing web of semen covered lore.

Knight of Order Follower: https://mega.nz/file/9EQCgTiD#oG-ndFa7Arpyy4WGnlYQGG10AXx4wXn6jNnAWza6Y5E
A summon-able Knight of Order named Sir Janus the Grey to fight at your side.

4thUnknown Golden Saints: https://mega.nz/file/FNRXGSCR#8seuWAP7FL55CtfrGD-DInUZNFTHQoaD0gHuYixuUlU
Adds several Golden Saint summons to Skyrim for appropriate NPCs based on the leaked models by 4th Unknown.

Arena Box Are Shitfu Follower: https://mega.nz/file/8dAjQBpD#38JXJ7jCAph7rVvR3xqgZpNRxAl5fosg6j4SPdAATpk
Skyla Winters is a garbage shit-fu created to make anons seethe. She comes with her own Lore friendly outfit, a beautiful face and a massive pair of tits! She can be found in the Whiterun Barracks!

Kassyra Follower: https://mega.nz/file/JM4FDJAC#e25ajNBGv7Z7JptdmiSOFdm7-USFZEC1TEpnZKaC3lY
A bosmer executioner with a checkered past. She fights with an Ebony Rapier and wears the mask of a deer skull! The perfect follower for those looking for more than just your average Wood Elf Rouge! She can be found on the Center Isle of Leyawiin at a small campsite on the shore or at the Pale Pass Gate.
WARNING: Kassyra Requires Animated Armoury. There are two versions of Kassyra. One requires Beyond Skyrim - Cyrodiil (Not Bruma) and has an extra little camp you can find Kassyra in. The other version just places her at the Pale Pass Gate. Choose what version suites you best!
