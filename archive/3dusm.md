The Joy of Acceptance.

~*~

I let her do it because she liked him, and I'm no one to deny her such pleasures. She moved in, and he moved in. They were evasive for some time but soon enough I found her sneaking glances at him. When we kissed, I could see that she was somewhere else. Her body ached for him as well.

*"Ha... Ha~!"* A faint voice echoed through the halls, escaping a poorly closed door. Exalted mewls came to a sudden end as a tiny, labored voice began to giggle. *"My legs...? What do you-?"*

So during breakfast, I confronted her about it. I told her I knew how she looked at him, how she touched him with her emerald eyes. She tried to deny it at first, but I was more sly than she gave me credit for. When she brushed her hair, she passed by him, hoping he'd notice. She'd dress in cute clothes that flashed her slim legs and that pronounced her perky buttocks, little pieces of eye candy, and ask for my opinion with her eyes darting off elsewhere. Asking me, as if she wasn't trying to catch someone else's attention. Towa-chan is always so roundabout.

*"W-Wait! What are you-? H-Hey! This pose is too lewd!"*

Still, she seemed to long so dearly for his embrace. I sighed. At first, I was enraged. The thought of having her getting ravaged by him, it filled me with disgust, with anger. I would've screamed at her, telling her to get out, but I couldn't do that. I had no right to. And he too, there was something off about his voice, about the way he greeted Towa. Perhaps he had been planning it before I even thought about it. 

*A bed creaks, a bed bumps as Towa gets hammered into the mattress. She's holding to his shoulders as if she's holding to dear life, and her eyes look into his, lost in a trance of pleasure and love. My heart hurts as I see him locking his lips with hers, and still, I felt my loins burn hotter. Those lips are mine... But still.*

Slowly but surely, the idea seduced me. I left them alone for extended periods of time, letting their intimacy grow, letting them 'get to know each other' without me interfering. The thought of what they were doing behind my back, it filled me with an insatiable lust, and immeasurable was my disappointment when I could come back home and see them avoiding each other like complete strangers. 

But still, I caught them a few times, and they didn't catch me. 

I woke up in the middle of the night, and to my surprise, my bed felt empty. No one slept to my side, no one cuddled me in their arms. I knew exactly what was going on. Nimble as the shadow of a ghost, I stepped out and I stood outside her room. The house was so perfectly still and quiet, that I could hear them whispering and murmuring, but I couldn't make out the words they pronounced. Even then, by their color and their warmth, I could tell they were intimate, that they were meant only for each other. 

And suddenly, I heard a kiss. Then another, and yet another. The pauses between the wet pops were getting longer and longer, and their tongues were getting louder and louder. I imagined them there, sunk in the darkness, whispering sweet nothings into each other's ears, and then my mental image was stripped them of their clothes. 

Towa giggled with a shine I can't quite describe. It was a meep of happiness, like a child getting praised. Then I heard her say, very clearly, *'You like my butt?'* With an awkwardly sultry voice, like she wasn't intending to sound that seductive. More wet sounds escaped from their love nest, and I knew they weren't kissing. Someone was sucking something, and Towa was mewling in pleasure, trying and failing spectacularly as concealing her voice.  

*"T-They're not that big..."* She pouted, right before she sucked air through her teeth the next second. Oh, I got hotheaded, and with my sleepwear under my hips, I pleasured myself behind their backs. 

At last, they were growing closer, and I knew because Towa acted colder around him if I was watching. She didn't know that I knew. She didn't know that I had caught a glimpse of a love bite, or that I I knew when the two sneaked out. She didn't know I had received those sultry dresses in the mail, and that I knew they weren't for my eyes. 

So, at last, I confronted her again. I told her I wanted to watch. Her expression tried to play innocence, but no words of denial tried to fool me. I received my answer a couple of days later. The two were rather uncomfortable, I had to give them a hand.

I sat on a chair so I wouldn't obstruct them. Towa-chan was laying on her back, so tense, so nervous. It saddened me, I was here to watch her enjoy herself. So I gave a few kisses, I let my tongue at her neck and my hand at her lower lips. Forward crawled our friend, and his dick had already taken a more confident shape.

"Spread yourself for him." I whispered. Her hands jittered with reluctance, but the more I purred into into Towa's ear, the more obedient she grew. I spread her pretty pink pussy wide, ready to take the man she so desperately wanted. Her hands copied mine, and their movements presented her as the whore she was to the man she chose.

He rubbed her a couple of times with his head, and as Towa sucked air through her teeth, her feet tapped on the bed impatiently, but her knees tried to close together. Poor little Towa, still unable to give herself in. So I caressed her hair, I locked my fingers with hers, and even I didn't notice when he sunk himself into her. I only did because of the shift in her expression. Her green eyes stopped looking at me in a split second, and instead they looked into the ceiling, they looked into nowhere. He held her there for a few seconds, grinding her, getting accustomed to her insides, and I bit my lips as he got a steady rhythm going. He's a beast, a master. Even I felt hypnotized by looking as his shaft plunged in and out of Towa's pretty pink pussy.

Still Towa tried to lock her eyes with mine, but I didn't want to hinder her. Instead I just gave her a few genuine smiles. I arched himself over her, and Towa, that little slut, her arms drew around his shoulders. Even if she was killing her pants and moans inside her throat, her body was more honest than she was willing to admit. Her hands caressed him with such tenderness, with such care, I was reminded that those two were dating before I took him from her. 

I'm not one to be left out, so I climbed on top of the bed, told Anon to give me some space. I slid my shorts off, and I sat on top of Towa's face.

"Kanatan..." Anon lifted my shirt by reflex. I grinded my behind on Towa's face, where she first gave me her cheek instead of her tongue, but her mouth understood its purpose soon enough. A few shy kisses on my pussy, a few nervous and shy tastes of my womanhood.

"Come on, Towa-chan!" I begged. "Don't leave me hanging..."

Anon grabbed her hips as he locked his lips with mine, giving me a furtive taste of Towa's lipstick. The purple devil's hands landed at my buttocks, and finally she lost the scruples she had held so tightly to. As her tongue plunged inside me I could feel Anon exert a number of moans from her, all which reverberated through my body. Anon grunts and pants as I lick his neck, as I touch him in the weak spots that Towa herself didn't know. His thrusts become more erratic by the second, and I what his expression means. 

"Towa-chan~!" I smiled. "Anon's going to knock you up!" I lifted myself off her and I sat against the wall of the bed. Her cheeks flushed, her mouth making a tiny, curious 'o', and her eyes beaming with a nervous curiosity, Towa watched as our Anon sank himself into her neck, grunting in her ear.  I didn't need to give her the instruction to close her legs around him, such a good girl for a devil. At last, Anon shot his seed inside her, Towa's moans dying into his shoulder. I caressed her belly, I kissed my Anon. Now it was my turn.

Bending over the exhausted Towa, I kissed her furtive tongue as Anon regained his strength. He slapped my butt, groped it, and I swayed it for him. At last, Towa stopped treating me like a stranger, and her hands caressed me with the same familiarity I did our man.

We'd lick the batter off the stick after we were done, and as withdrew from Towa's mouth, I finally saw her green eyes beaming with a million little stars inside them, beaming with the joy of acceptance.
