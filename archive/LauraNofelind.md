####F.M.S.U.
**[Milky], [Love Nectar]**
"It's not so bad, although I sometimes need to wear two shirts. Eden takes most of the milk, so I'm not usually, uh... Bursting... M-moving on."
**[Nosebleed]**
"Took some getting used to when it first started to happen. Now I just look away when people are being too lecherous, and carry a blindfold for, um, private use."
**[Breeding Season]**
"A little scary, hasn't happened to me yet. I guess it might be kinda fun, it's just that I don't quite want to have a baby yet, but... M-moving on again!"
**[Localized Regen]**
"H-hurting a bit is good sometimes. E-even all the times."

####G.R.M.
**[Unusual Aesthetic], [Bio-Immortal]**
"Of course I look special, I am special! Forever young! J-just, uh, if some Concurso-dungeon-raider-looking types ask about me, you don't know me, okay?"
**[Kyuu], [Claws]**
"But this, this is all-natural! Having your main weapons be a part of your body means you can never be disarmed. Unless, you know, you get actually dis-armed, but uh... Let's talk about something else."

####U.T.T.
**[Perfect Pussy], [Contortionist]**
"Have I ever... My own... No! N-no! I-I mean the, the thought had c-crossed my... No, no no shut up!"
**[Porn Physics], [Mr Clean], [Tamed Shark ]**
"Never leave home without it! Safety first, especially when you're the small one in the equation, and cleanliness is next to uh... Arbiterliness? Arbitrarity? Anyway, I'm not sure anymore if a life where you have to poop is worth living."
**[Divine Pregnancy], [Lovers Lab]**
"I thought the womb tattoo was just Eden signing her work, but apparently it's functional too. O-only if I get pregnant though, and um... Moving on! Yes, again! A rolling stone gathers no babies!

####Banes
**[Nyaa], [Bestial]**
"F-feline is beautiful! Honestly, there is a *lot* of upside to this, when someone scratches the right spot in the right way... N-no I won't tell you where! That's private! Stop guessing!"
**[Fate Dynamo]**
"This is even better than starting trouble, it's starting trouble with *deniability*."
**[Damsel]**
"I mean, who would want to kill a cute little kitten? I'm a master of escape, this just gives me more opportunities!"
**[Dere Dere], [Ahegao], [Masochist]**
"This stuff... I've made some mistakes involving one or more of these banes in the past. I'm not gonna lie here, I'm probably gonna do it again. It just... Doesn't *feel* like a mistake at the time."
**[Lightweight]**
"I call wine 'Mistake Juice.' Okay, I don't, but maybe I should. In fairness, usually when I drink I just fall asleep somewhere, like in a tree or a church spire. It's just, occasionally I do pick a fight or say something I really shouldn't. Well... What's life if you only do sensible things? It's boring!

####Boons
**[Permanence], [Man Portions]**
"Another part of the eternal youth package! I can eat as much as I want, I could even get swole as hell, but I'll always stay small and cute."
**[Inconspicuous], [Darkvision], [Ooga Booga], [Itâ€™s Free Real-Estate]**
"The skills of a master thief! Blending in, never losing your way, operating under the cover of darkness and above all, beating any security measures, physical or magical."
**[Flavour Flay], [Sensory Overdose]**
"Another side effec- I mean natural gift! Helps keep spirits high when the cuisine is low."
**[Unbreakable Mind]**
"Another important ingredient in practical immortality. Always use protection when getting involved with psychic monsters, or just... Having a little too much fun."

####Items
**[Starting Bonus - Skeleton Key]**
"I could pick most any lock by the time I got this, but it still saves a lot of time! It's also got a lot of sentimental value, being a gift from Eden and all..." 
**[Infinity Bag]**
"Of course, sometimes in the course of burglary you realize you're trying to pinch more than you can carry. That's where the infinity bag comes in, no weight limit whatsoever! I could empty out a royal treasury and carry it out on my back!"
**[Riftgate Licence]**
"If I have to travel a long distance in a short time, I prefer to ask Eden. But if she can't get me where I need to go, this still works. To be honest, I still don't fully trust these things but hey, it seems to work. Just don't forget the stupid ring..."
