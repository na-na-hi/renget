# Daily Life in the City of Orario

Early in the morning, just before the sun rises, a member from the house of Athena quietly sneaks out of bed and goes out into the dark, empty streets of Orario. The house itself still rests soundly, with many members of the humble home asleep under thick covers and warm cushion. None sleeping more slovenly than the head of the house herself, Athena. Betraying her usual demeanor amongst fellow gods, she was all over the place. Limbs hanging off the bed, unkempt hair tangled about, and even a bit of drool pouring out. The bed itself was equally all over the place. Blankets strewn from pillow to pillow as though making a fort. A basket of yarns and hooks coalescing into a night of hard work for just the extra bit valis for tomorrow. The night lamp's oil completely burnt out from illuminating another hundred patterns. Yet through the loud, unladylike snores, there was another member wide awake under her own sheets.

A minute past the sunrise. Olivia had gone to the edge of town yet again to look towards the eastern path. Orange lights painted the usual green leaves of where she had once been, and of a life left behind for a better one. Despite this, maybe this life really isn't for her. She never had a fragile touch. Her hands would frequently untangle knit after knit, even with the guiding hands of her goddess. Her fellow demi human in the familia could out weave her with all her eyes closed. All she had was fighting. Calloused fingers could never provide the soft touch necessary for the arts, yet Athena would encourage all her members to make something for themselves. These wandering thoughts were interrupted when a presence had made herself known to her. Whether it was due to excitement or nervousness, Tomo couldn't sleep well last night. To be paired up for an assignment after so long left her tossing and turning all night. Is it even to be believed? Can such an opportunity be possible for someone like her? At least whoever she was going to be paired with wouldn't be able to refuse. What do they know, how much do they know? As questions raced across her mind, she had at least planned to make a good impression. Tomo walked up to the alerted demi human with a tankard in each hand. Never making a sound and avoiding each and every twig unconsciously as she approached. Olivia herself didn't expect anyone to follow her so early in the morning, not especially a famila member. At first, they both sat awkwardly on the tree stump. Neither of them having the intention to make the first move. A few moments pass until finally Tomo remembers to offer the cup to Olivia.

"Drink?" Olivia asked her still silent dungeon partner.
"un." Tomo responded with a small nod, avoiding every bit of eye contact.

Opening the top revealed a sweet-smelling brown liquid still steaming from having been freshly prepared. Olivia could only tilt her head at the sight, then looking towards Tomo and making the same gesture towards her.

"It's hot chocolate. It's good, I hope." The drink was still foreign to Tomo, but she could recall one of her old teammates offering one to each of the members. She at least seemed to follow the maid shop's recipe to a tee.

Olivia brought the cup to her at full tilt before flinching from the heat of the beverage and spilling some of its content as she yanks it away from her mouth. Tomo could only be perplexed by the situation.

"Y-you're supposed to sip it like tea!" she said. Hoping that her response was due to having her tongue burnt rather than due to how bad it tasted. 

"Tea?"

"Yeah, you've never drank tea before?" Though it started off shaky, they were able to find something to talk about as the sun rose over head.

In the morning, with the sun halfway towards it' peak in the sky. The house of Lassie was diligently at work. The laundry had been hung up early to dry, newly washed under the twilight sky. Lotta had been cleaning the windows, while Cerise had been preparing each of the cutlery and dinnerware to be used for the tea party tomorrow. Lassie herself had poured over ledgers, making sure her schedule was open enough to accommodate any delays or changes, especially since a specific god had been invited, much to her dismay. Berry and Kyara were already out, so they were the ones to pick up groceries on their way back. Berry had worked late at another familia to maintain all the arms and armor of her teammate, while Kyara had been dragged in by the party she was with to celebrate the success of the expedition. Despite this, they still looked at peak form. Dresses and suits without wrinkles as though recently pressed, and neither a speck nor soot staining the pure white highlights of their uniform. It was easy for them to spot each other at the early morning wet market. Kyara had a dignified look to her that made her stand out from the crowd, while Berry, though surrounded by plenty of fans, could be identified by the large pack of sparkling gear she flaunted as she walked. 

"Right, with how much you're carrying with you, it's best if you pick up the coffee grounds and tea leaves to avoid any further crowding while I handle the vegetables and meat."

"Oh, willing to handle most of the work? You really know how to serve a lady despite being one yourself." Berry responded in jest, yet Kyara's expression did not change at all.

"Fine, but before we split, you should wear this." Berry then swings the backpack around and presents her with a set of pauldrons and greaves for her.

"What for? Lady Lassie has commanded that we decline any dungeon task for both today and tomorrow."

"Think of it as a little peace offering from me to you. Plus, you'll be taking a load off my back." Despite this, Kyara looks reluctantly at the gear offered. A bit too flashy for a butler such as herself.

"Huuuh? What's wrong with a little flair while you're out on a walk? It's the perfect thing for a high level adventurer such as yourself." still speaking in an exaggerated tone. Eventually, Kyara accepts the armor and both go their separate ways.

…

As Kyara gets the last set of vegetable on the list, the sun enters midday. The crowd has gone thicker now that most of the residents of the city are up, and it'll only get worse as time passes. In order to ensure a quick return to her familia, Kyara takes to the alleyways to avoid most of the traffic. Just as she passes each building, she notices an altercation happening at a secluded corner. A group of men standing over a single guy with weapons drawn at him. Immediately, Kyara puts the bags of produce behind a few crates and rushes towards the group to interrupt their hold up. 

"Excuse me, gentlemen, but what seems to be the problem?" Kyara says, while trying to be as diplomatic as possible.

"Oh, this? He just owes us a little-"

"They're trying to rob me!" the man on the floor shouts before one of them could finish their sentence.

"Ah, well. It was worth a shot. Guess we'll take whatever you have as well, starting with the silver on you." Each of the robbers now preparing for a fight.

First, eliminate the two closest to the victim. Kyara grabs both of their heads and smashes them together, knocking both out. One of the thugs tries to swing at her but was blocked by the shin guards kicked away before he could get closer. Next, take out their leader. These guys wouldn't survive a gang war, even if they were babysat through the whole process. Kyara dodges swings and stabs on her way to the most armed fighter, not a single attack even landing a scratch on her butler uniform. Their leader of course had other plans. Throwing down a few smoke bombs filled with poison, also blocking the other members’ escape route in the process. A futile effort as Kyara passes through the smoke completely unscathed by the paralytic effects. She grabs him by the back of the collar, slams him behind her, and goes for the killing blow as he bounces off of the floor from the impact. As the smoke clears, the silhouette of Kyara could be seen adjusting her collar with their leader out cold beneath her dress shoe. Out of desperation, one of the thugs grabs their victim and threatens him at knife point.

"Stand back, or w-we'll paint the streets with his blood!" The other robbers follow suit and stand closely towards the hostage. Kyara could only comply as they slowly back away from the scene.

Of course, an adventurer like her wouldn't let them get away without good reason. Before they could make it pass the corner, the hostage taker was knocked out cold, and soon after the others flanking him collapsed. Berry now stood behind the man, sword still in its sheath. All it took was two strikes to clean up the escapees. A pomel to the head, and a blunt slash to those remaining.

"As if we'd let a bunch of lowlifes get away with it. You're centuries behind if you want to go toe to toe with us."

"What took you so long?"

"The pack was heavy, okay. Didn't think you'd go back to your old ways so easily." Berry said while taking a glance at their leader, who's face was firmly planted into the ground. Kyara could only scoff at the implication.

"Anyway, this would've been great if you took it out to the streets. Imagine that, a crowd of onlookers watching as a maid and butler duo from the Lassie familia sweep up the crime scene!" But before Berry could finish her spiel, Kyara was already heading back with the groceries in hand.

"W-wait a minute! You can't leave yet! We've gotta make the most out of this situation!"

"The guards will handle the rest. Besides, we're going to be late if I'm going to let you prance around some more." Kyara responds while smiling just a bit at her annoyance.

"Fine. You owe me an extra round once this all blows over, y'hear?"

With a silent agreement, Berry then takes one of the other bags and skips ahead, while Kyara maintains the brisk yet poised pace back to the house.

Late at night, with the moon high in the sky, the pleasure district of the city of Orario is alight with red signs and the glowing nightlife from all manner of vices imaginable. Within one of the biggest gaming halls of the city resides the house of Mammon. A glorious palace of revelry, perfect for a god of beauty such as himself. Despite its name, the Suck Ya Dry! casino is one of the go-to places for the rich and powerful. Walls and pillars gilded in gold, tigers chained on pedestals as simple furniture, and a throne made of valis where the titular Mammon himself would've sat to overlook all the cheers of success and the wails of failure. But right now, he sat in his office, to manage yet another bumble fuck who thought he could make it rich from playing against the house.

"I don't know what kind of shithole you came from, kid. But wherever it was, you really forgot to bring any luck with you!" Mammon takes out his cigar and lets out a hearty laugh that echoes through the quiet office space. 

"Like I said, a deal's a deal. You signed your life away, not me." Mammon takes another big puff before blowing it all towards Gen's face.

"However, I can be quite the merciful god. I'm taking pity on your situation and granting your wish in the process." Mammon then takes one final puff and grinds the half used luxury cigar on the magical contract on the table to seal the deal.

Gen felt small. Smaller than he'd ever felt back home. If this was going to be his new life, then he was better off daydreaming back at home. The deal was done. There's no going back, or anywhere for that matter. There'd be no food to eat, no shelter to rest his head upon. He wouldn't even have the fare to ride back home.

"There's just one more thing we like to do to new recruits. Hey, meathead! Why don't you give shit-for-brains here a bit of the go around in the arena?" From the equally large door behind Gen came an equally tall man. Rippling muscles, half dressed, with a sleeve of scars on each arm. 

Mammon went ahead and stood up himself, prompting Gen to stand up as well. With a pat on the back, Mammon makes one final remark before heading back out to the throne. "Oh, you're going to like this. I'm going to make you a hero."

The roaring crowd is deafening. While the announcer sets up the next fight, both Oakly and Gen head down below, where all the other participants wait.

"I, uh, don't know how to fight." Gen said in order look for a lighter sentence.

Oakly, still high on the latest poison he's ingested, makes a nod and leaves without saying a word. I'm sure it'll be fine, right? Without warning, his name could be heard from above, and he was pushed onto the stage for the world to see. The arena was an octagonal cage with rows upon rows of seats at each of the eight sides. On the opposite end stood another victim of the arena. An amazonian with sparse armor and simple sword, while Gen only had the clothes on his back.

"Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen for tonight's opening act!" Even as the announcer hypes up the crowd, Gen can't believe the situation he's in. Is he really going to pay back his debts like this? Not long after, his opponent closes in the gap between them, making as many sharp blows as her stamina could muster. All Gen could do was dodge as best he can while his only set of apparel gets torn to shreds while it's on him. He can't even fight back, not like this at least. After a few more strikes, his opponent stands back to rest for a bit. The opportunity's at hand. Hoping to catch her by surprise, Gen steps towards her offhand side and makes a clean blow with his fist. Sadly, it does absolutely nothing, even the amazonian was completely unfazed by his attempt. With a snap of a finger only audible to Gen, his opponent begins to crumble before him. To the point where she couldn't even put up a fight against a child. Gen was a decisive winner, and he did absolutely nothing to her. Then the next match started and without fail, they would fall to the ground after taking a few superficial hits. That's when he realized that the matches were set up. He didn't know what to do in melee, but Mammon was going to bring a career to him without even lifting a finger. For a bit, he could live the dream. Whatever he faced, he'd beat easily with a single punch. As he rose through the bracket as a new rising star, and there was only one more opponent to face.

The typical cheers he's heard all night rang throughout as he entered the arena. Lots of valis was on the line, but they weren't betting on him. The crowd grew quiet as the final opponent was being revealed. Mammon himself rose up to the mic and made the announcement. Not a single murmur wondered out loud who would be the final boss. The machines outside the main hall were barely a chirp in the abyssal silence that consumed the whole house. One final verdict until Gen could rest easy, even just for tonight.

"It's me!" Mammon shouted from the top of his lungs. The crowd roared back in excitement as the god was handed his hammer and jumped straight into the arena. All Gen could muster was a simple "O-oh."

His landing sent waves across the hall. His hammer has ended the careers of countless promising fighters, and this was going to be no different. Just before match start, he beckoned Gen closer. Making a whisper in the tiny human's ear.

"Play along just like I've shown you. It's not that hard, is it?" Gen could only make quick nods, as his voice could barely peep out another word. Each fighter raised their hands together as a final service to the crowd. This being their final gesture as someone was likely to leaving the arena on a stretcher. When the fight began, it was no contest. Gen didn't even bother with any pretenses and braced for impact as soon as possible. He prayed to some other god that his passage to the afterlife was a peaceful one, as everyone cheered for his loss. With a single swing of the hammer, Mammon sent the human across the stage and into the steel bars of the octagon. Denting the reinforced walls and causing the hapless opponent to slump down without a fight. A deafening celebration could be heard just as Gen was about to lose consciousness. With the last bit of life left in his eyes, he could see the face of god right before him.

"Welcome to the familia, rookie." Mammon spoke to him before grinding his face beneath his heel and gesturing to the crowd before him. A fitting end for the final battle of the night.
