#/vp/ Plays Shit

This rentry is mostly for games that died for one reason or another. Though not every ded game will be put here, probably.
Not gonna really bother with sprucing this one up like the main one, so these will likely keep Musk's descriptions, outside of the ones I've added/edited already.
[TOC3]

###->Pokemon Wack<-

!!! danger
	After the first Rejuvenation playthrough, Musk went and played Wack. 
	**Cause of Death: Musk's short attention span/inability to get around the anticheat, depending on the thread**

###->Rejuvenation Ground Mono<-

###->Eternal Order<-
!!! danger
	The start of the Bingoshit Musk wanted to do. Never really caught on, though.
	**Cause of Death: Musk got filtered, and Orevald's PC kept crashing the game**
[**[1]** *Musk gets filtered, not unusual*](https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/54597569/)

###->Uranium<-
!!! danger
	Eternal Order kept crashing for Orevald, so he played Uranium instead
	**Cause of Death: Uranium being a boring as fuck game**
[**[1]** *Lots of shit designs*](https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/54604396/)
[**[2]** *Aren't nuclear meltdowns fun? Thread dies*](https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/54623584/)
[**[3]** *The radiation poisoning finally catches up to Orevald*](https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/54636740/)

###->Myth<-
!!! danger
	**Cause of Death: Being a shit game with somehow even shittier balance**
[**[1]** E-Speed Rufflet at lv.15 should tell you all you need to know about this shit. Normal mode isn't much better, either. On to Empyrean](https://arch.b4k.co/vp/thread/54934705/)
