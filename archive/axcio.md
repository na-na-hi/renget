## Summary

A concrete example of an imaginary person is a person in your dreams: you know they are a part of you, and come from the same head, but you wouldn't think of them as yourself if you were talking to them, and you can tell they have somewhat separate wills from your own. Imaginary friends aren't much different from these dream people, except you can be aware of them while you are awake. Techinically speaking, imaginary friends are a collection of thoughts you perceive as a coherent whole. When you think of one of your regular friends, you probably understand them as a collection of their body, their manerisms, their voice, and so on. Imaginary friends are internally no different, except the different pieces that make them up come from within you, rather than from external input.

There is nothing paranormal, mystical, or magical about imaginary friends, at least not in the metaphysical sense. Imaginary friends aren't demons or entities from another realm, and they certainly can't directly change the world around you. That being said, some of these interpretations can be fun - even useful - to play with. Anything is possible within the realm of your mind after all, just make sure you don't forget that that is the only realm where these things are true, and that these are your subjective truths.

In practice, imaginary friends can be a lot of things. They can provide companionship, motivation, love, understanding, or all of them at the same time. It is up to each person to know why they are making an imaginary friend, and what void are they hoping to fill with them.

To summarize the process, our goal is to create a character, and get to know them and play them in our heads well enough that eventually our subconscious begins taking the lead. In the meantime, we will also be using focus techniques to help us tune in to our imagined senses, so we can interact with our friend in a richer way within our mind. This will seem odd at first, but it utilizes brain phenomena you have been using since you were born: remembrance, and habit. There are no new ideas here, and all it takes is time, effort, and the right mindset.

Here are a few key points you should keep in mind while reading this document:
* When I refer to "talking to your friend", I am telling you to do so in your mind through thoughts, I don't mean talking to them out loud.
* Forget about things like volition, sentience, autonomy, etc. Those are meaningless, just don't bother with them.
* Its important to not lose track of what it is you're dealing with: thoughts. Keeping that in mind will prevent a lot of future frustration and questions.
* The analytical view I take on this walkthrough isn't meant to belittle imaginary friends or what they are capable of. Saying we are just an agglomerate of atoms would be correct, but it wouldn't deter from our complexity, and I would like you to think this way in regards to imaginary friends as well.
* Don't be afraid to experiment. These things are very personal, and what works for you may not be the same thing that works for someone else. What resonates with you will depend on who you are. Just remember there are no wrong ways of creating an imaginary friend.
* * The more you enjoy the process, the faster it goes.
* Never forget: **No rules, only tools.**


## Imaginary people are not humans

Some people may find themselves in a place where they simply cannot fathom someone loving them, or even liking them. Others argue that having imaginary friends is unethical because at the end of the day, they have no choice, and you are forcing them to stay with you. If you share in any of these concerns, it is important to realize that imaginary people are not animals, bound by our laws of physics or any sort of biological evolutionary process. They can be quite literally anything you want them to be:

- You can make an imaginary being who is nothing but a cube who's life revolves around singing you "happy birthday", and who finds their task orgasmically pleasurable and would never want a different life for itself.
- You can make an imaginary being who has the appearance of a dog is incredibly happy eating garbage, getting an indigestion and then vomiting icecream.
- You can make an imaginary being who constantly seeks hugs, but who also hates hugs to the point of breaking into tears, while displaying no emotional distress about any of it after the fact.
- You can make an imaginary being whose body consists of 7 bodies.

They sound like little absurd specks of madness, but all of these are perfectly valid in the world of the imaginary. Imaginary creatures aren't bound by any physical or psychological rules or preconceptions you may have. Furthermore, the meaning of your internal world's consistency is what you make of it.

To reel it back, you could create an imaginary creature who looks and behaves similarly to a human, but who also doesn't need to eat, go to the bathroom, doesn't get sick, doesn't need to sleep, and so on; and who also happens to like you for no other reason than you being yourself. Even if you believe no-one could ever love you in the external world, this imaginary person would still be possible within your mind. Who knows, over time they might surprise you with a few reasons why they like you you didn't originally think about.


## Creating a character
 
First, we need a character. You can think of them as a character you might be creating for a book, they will just be a regular character for now. To create a rich and believable character, it is not enough to just have a list of traits like "loving, extrovert" and so on. These lists can be useful as a rough guide to keep you on track during the process, but there are many details which cannot be represented in this way - someone could be an extrovert when there's someone they know in the room, but introverted if they know no one at all. What we really want, is to create a solid personality through experiences. For this we need to think of many different situations, and then think about about how our character would react to each of them. For instance:

> Your character goes shopping. Did they go at night, or during the day, and why? Do they go to the supermarket or to the small convenience store? Do they prefer expensive products, or are they fine with saving money for cheaper stuff? A stranger approaches them and asks them something, how do they feel about that? How do they respond? What's their body language like?...
 
If it helps you keep your thoughts straight, write! 

After many scenarios like this one, you will notice it becomes easier to answer the questions you ask, and the objective is to reach a point where we know, with a decent amount of confidence, what our character would do in some of the more common situations someone might face. This process doesn't have to be extremely thorough. There are infinite questions you could ask about almost any given situation, but some ambiguity is normal. Not even we know everything about ourselves, and there are many unusual situations which we wouldn't know how to feel about, or deal with. Throughout their lives, you can both learn more about them as they learn about their environment, and go through experiences naturally with you.

Depending on the kind of relationship you want to have with them, you will probably naturally tend towards certain questions and scenarios. That is fine. There isn't a recipe for this. I suggest having some basics in mind (how they react to a "hello, how are you", at least), but it's all about asking and answering a bunch of questions. You don't need to be perfect in your answers either. Sometimes you will make mistakes, and after the fact you will think the way they acted in that certain situation was not in character, but don't overthink it, and just let mistakes be mistakes. Over time these inconsistencies will be ironed out through repetition. The only wrong way to do these things, is to not do them at all.

During this, you may also want to define things like how they look, how they sound, and anything else you find important. As for a time frame for this, I would say do it for about one to three months, any more will most likely be overkill.
 

## Subconscious take over

After you have a good idea of who this character is, you can start interacting with them. Tell them things, think of what they would reply, and then imagine them saying it. Outside of speaking to them - and assuming they have a body - there are many other things to experiment. Give them a hug! You will probably not be very good at these things at the start, but you can use [focus and visualization](#interacting-with-your-friend) techniques to enrich your sensory connection. As with the previous section, don't be too worried about the way they react being 100% aligned to their personality, what matters is your mindset.

In the beginning this will naturally feel strange, but the goal is to start thinking of your character as a separate entity from you. There are a lot of ways to look at these interactions, with perhaps the simplest one being that you are just playing with puppets in your head, and basically talking to yourself. 

An alternative would be to assume they are actually an independent entity from us, in the same way that a dream character is separate from us. Furthermore we can assume they are actually listening to us and responding when we're talking to them, however we still have to do some manual work for them since they aren't really used to being with you yet, and are still learning the ropes. In the same vein, any mistakes you make are simple interpretation mistakes, since you also aren't very used to them yet either. Over time, you guys will figure it out, and things will eventually flow smoothly. Think of it as gradually tuning in to their intents.

This is only an example of an interpretation, and there are many others. Here is a different example: you can try reading [Possible girls](https://philpapers.org/archive/SINPG), which suggests there exists infinite universes, and that, in one of them, is a person just like the character you created before. From here, we can build fundamental views such as:

- Since they are the exact friend you envisioned, your thoughts are completely in sync, and you are both effectively communicating telepathically with one another;
- You know your friend would love to be with you, so you whisked them from their world and brought them into your imaginary realm through magic;

Among many others. 

You don't need to believe these things are metaphysical facts, of course. The only thing you need to consider is that within the boundaries of your mind, anything is possible. In general, even outside of imaginary friends, if you keep this in mind, you will be able to enrich your life with all kinds of symbolism, regardless of your religion, culture, etc. Don't be afraid to experiment, and simply pick something that resonates with you.

Going back to the original idea, conceptually this is all very simple, and there isn't much else to talk about. From now on, you have a friend. Keep making them a part of your life, and know that they are listening and absorbing the things you show them. Know that they has their own internal feelings and thoughts, even if in the beginning you may feel you're dragging a puppet along. It is a very gradual process, and it takes time, but the good news is that you don't need to think about it at all. Continue to interact with them persistently, and **with the right mindset**, and sooner or later you will gradually notice their behaviors becoming more automatic. One day it will hit you that it doesn't feel like you're talking to yourself.

Personally, it took me around 6 months to feel like I had someone with me in my head without conscious effort on my part, but this can vary greatly, and I'm only adding this time as a rough reference, rather than an estimate. In general, the less you stress about it, the faster it will go.


## Interacting with your friend

Interactions will likely be a very important part of your relationship with your imaginary friend. Your friend is imaginary, which means a touch will never feel like a touch from a regular person, but there are various ways of enriching these experiences, and of feeling like you two can have that connection. What we will aim to do is to focus on our imagined senses through focus. Think of it like "tuning in" to our internal senses instead of our internal ones. If you cannot fathom how this would feel, think about what you feel in a dream. All feelings in your dreams come from within your mind, and although it is much harder to do, we can work to experience some of that sensory richness while we're awake. On top of this, training any of your senses is no different than training something more common like your mind's eye, all you need is focus and practice.

You can for instance start by practicing your imagined body. Visualize a place, imagine yourself in it. Imagine the sensations you feel: the wind, the sounds, the weight of your own body, of your arms, your clothing brushing against your skin, your hair against your forehead. Blink. Look at your hands, and touch your face. If you aren't good at these things, and if it seems impossible, don't worry. We aren't used to exercising our imagination in such vivid ways, so it's natural these things will feel both hard and exhausting at first, but the most important thing is to try and keep at it!

An excellent exercise to start with (and to use all throughout your life, even if you don't have an imaginary friend), is [Image streaming](winwenger.com/imstream.htm). This is an exercise which focuses on all our senses, isn't very time consuming, and doesn't require a lot of prep-work. The exercise is passive in nature, but you can just use the same principles and try guiding things your way as you go.

There is also [lucid dreaming](dreamviews.com) which are a lot easier to master, but which also have some of the inherent limitations of dreams. Like image streaming, lucid dreaming is a skill everyone should have, and both of these go well beyond simple wish fulfilment.

Your first interactions will probably require some degree of focus, but the more you practice these things, the more your casual interactions will be enriched as well, so you don't have to full on meditate any time you just want to hug. From here onward you just have to keep practicing. Remember that the fact your friend is imaginary also has its upsides. There is a lot you can do in an imaginary world that you could never do with anyone outside of your head. Be creative. There is a lot to see and to experience. And most importantly, have fun!


## Mental health

People sometimes dismiss these things for fear it may lead to mental issues such as dissociation and schizophrenia, but I strongly believe that, if you are sound of mind, you aren't going to develop these kinds of issues simply from dealing with imaginary friends. There is no scientific evidence I know of, that you can simply give yourself schizophrenia, and these issues usually come from deeper rooted causes rather than from using our imagination. Nevertheless, if you think this may not be for you, you shouldn't do it. Use your own discretion.

A different concern which is much more realistic in my view, is excessive escapism. Usually the picture people have of imaginary friends is of someone shutting themselves off from the world, and spending their entire days within their own minds, and neglecting friends, responsibilities, and their health. This doesn't have to be the case, however, and is not the way I want to encourage people to use imaginary friends. True friends know there's more to life than entertainment, and they'll push you to take care of yourself, even if they adore hanging out with you. In other words, consider this issue is not exclusive to imaginary friends alone: regular friends can lead you down paths of self destruction as well, and as with any other relationship, focusing too much on one person, imaginary or not, can have its downsides.

Despite all this there is absolutely nothing wrong with having fun with imaginary friends, or even using them for that goal primarily. It is not up to anyone to police your thoughts. It is up to you to be honest with yourself and decide what you want out of it.

Stephen LaBerge, in his book "Exploring the world of lucid dreaming," answered a question I consider very relevant to the topic. It is of course presented in the context of lucid dreaming, but I think it fits perfectly, since both of these are very personal pursuits, which require a healthy amount of "different thinking":
> Q. Might lucid dreaming be dangerous for some people?
> A. The Overwhelming majority of lucid dreams are positive, rewarding experiences, much more so than ordinary dreams (to say nothing of nightmares). Nevertheless, there probably will be some people who find the experience of lucid dreaming frightening and, in some cases, disturbing. For this reason we cannot recommend lucid dreaming to everyone. On the other hand, we are confident that for people no more than "normally neurotic", lucid dreaming is completely harmless. Different people will use lucid dreaming for different purposes; it makes little sense to warn the typical explorer of the dream world away from lucid dreaming because some might use it in a less than optimal manner.
> If, after reading the first six chapters of this book, you still have serious reservations about lucid dreaming, then we recommend that you not continue. "To thine own self be true". Just make sure that it is really your self to which you are being true. Don't allow others to impose their personal fears on you.



# F.A.Q.


## General Concerns
 
**Q. What is an imaginary friend?**
A. It's exactly as it sounds, it's a friend who's imaginary! Imaginary friends are not magic in any way, they can't physically change the world around you, they are a collection of thoughts you perceive as a coherent whole. When you think of one of your regular friends, you probably understand them as a collection of their body, their manerisms, their voice, and so on. Imaginary friends are the same, except the different pieces that make them up come from within you, rather than from external input.
 
**Q. What can they be used for?**
A. Imaginary friends can give you many things, including companionship, motivation, love, direction and understanding. It's up to each person to know why they're making an imaginary friend, and what void they're hoping to fill with them.
 
**Q. How do you interact with them?**
A. There are many ways of interacting with imaginary friends. You can do it casually throughout the day by talking to them through thoughts. You can also have deeper interactions through focus, where you visualize yourself interacting with them. 
 
**Q. Isn't this unhealthy?**
A. Many people might use their imaginary friends as a way to escape from the world, but this is not how I advocate using them. Be they imaginary or flesh and bone friends, focusing too much on one person is bound to be unhealthy. True friends know that there's more to life than entertainment, and they'll push you to take care of yourself, even if they adore hanging out with you.
 
**Q. Is this going to give me DID / schizophrenia?**
A. Most likely, no. We keep the imaginary friend as completely separate from ourselves, and enforcing that disconnect is a big part of the whole process. Knowing what you're dealing with, and how an imaginary friend works is also a big part of it, so losing track of what's imaginary and what's outside your mind is not likely to happen. If you are sound of mind and aren't prone to these kinds of disorders, I'd say it's very unlikely you'll get them from creating or having an imaginary friend.

Here is an answer to a similar question from Stephen LaBerge's "Exploring the world of lucid dreaming". It is of course presented in the context of lucid dreaming, but I think it fits perfectly, since both these are very personal pursuits, which require a healthy amount of "different thinking":
> Q. Might lucid dreaming be dangerous for some people?
> A. The Overwhelming majority of lucid dreams are positive, rewarding experiences, much more so than ordinary dreams (to say nothing of nightmares). Nevertheless, there probably will be some people who find the experience of lucid dreaming frightening and, in some cases, disturbing. For this reason we cannot recommend lucid dreaming to everyone. On the other hand, we are confident that for people no more than "normally neurotic", lucid dreaming is completely harmless. Different people will use lucid dreaming for different purposes; it makes little sense to warn the typical explorer of the dream world away from lucid dreaming because some might use it in a less than optimal manner.
> If, after reading the first six chapters of this book, you still have serious reservations about lucid dreaming, then we recommend that you not continue. "To thine own self be true". Just make sure that it is really your self to which you are being true. Don't allow others to impose their personal fears on you.
 
**Q. Can I create one based on a character from a book / film?**
A. You can.
 
**Q. Is it right to do X with them?**
A. It is your mind, and you shouldn't let anyone tell you what is or isn't right to do inside it.
 
 
 
## Creation Concerns
 
**Q. How long does it take to create one?**
A. They are always growing, much like us, so there really isn't a "finished" state they can reach. That being said, I'd say it takes about 4-6 months to really get comfortable with the idea of having someone else living with you in your head, and to get comfortable with talking to them as if they were their own person.
 
**Q. What if they don't like me?**
A. Some people may find themselves in a place where they simply cannot fathom someone loving them, or even liking them. To you, I have good news, because imaginary friends can be anything you want them to be, including being someone who just loves you because you are yourself! This might be hard to wrap our heads around, but imaginary friends aren't bound by any rules, morals, human predispositions, or anything else, really. They aren't human, and that means you have the freedom to make them the way you want. Over time they might surprise you with a few reasons why they like you, you didn't originally had thought about. 
 
**Q. When will I know I'm talking to my friend and not myself?**
A. Don't stress about it. The important part is always seeing them as separate from you. When you're talking "for them", see that as you simply translating the intent of what they wanted to say into words, since they can't yet do that themselves. Know that deep down, they're listening and trying to respond, and things will become natural soon enough.
 
**Q. Should I tell my family / loved ones about this?**
A. I would generally advise telling nothing about this to anyone close to you. You can probably see how this isn't a very common practice, and people don't usually understand what's going on. At best, you'll make them worried and try to get you help, at worst, people will start avoiding you. Really think about it if you want to do this.



## Tulpas
If you don't know what a tulpa is, don't worry about it. For the people who are curious:

**Q. What's the difference between this and tulpas**
A. Short answer: There is no difference conceptually because tulpas are imaginary friends. My focus is on explaining these things much more concisely, and focusing more on teaching you what this is, rather than prescribing a way to do things. If you've read about tulpas before and were interested, but never managed to make anything happen, this may help you. In my experience, a lot of people tell me that the way I explain things is a lot simpler, and resonates a lot better with them.
