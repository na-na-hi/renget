->Birds of Feather<-
"Have a good day everyone! Remember to brainstorm a team name for the basketball game!" Miss Rosethorn says to her class as the last bell rang.  Most of 1-D shuffled out slowly, but Sally was quick on the draw to the principal's office. She clutched her bag with an iron grip as she had a look of utter rage on her face. Her assignment UNDER Inigo for this game was a step too far. She wasn't even allowed to threaten him with a shotgun blast to the face anymore or she'd get reported for "Misuse of a Deadly Quirk". When she heard another pair of footsteps behind her and saw a blonde haired kid she naturally felt a .50 cal barrel forming in her arm.

"What do you want now?!" She yells back at him, not even turning around to see Inigo.
"Cool it, cowgirl, just wanted to say I'm excited to-"

A loud gunshot goes off and a large bullet crashes into the floor of the school, thankfully not piercing the floor.
"Oh you're *excited* to see me dress all skimpy and listen your fuckin' orders?! And then if we win say you it's *your* victory!?" Sally growls at the boy as she turns around slowly. 

The boy tries to hold his nerve: "To be fair, your legs are lovely, McCathy, certainly worth marveling at" 

Sally closes her eyes, and draws all the patience she could possibly have left, biting down on her tongue to suppress all American insults she had ready for this kid. He has hit on her all semester, and this was the breaking point.

She stares the boy down as he seems to think he's disarmed her: "Look, I know this really nice coffee shop-"
Sally puts her hand forward as a metal tube shows up in her palm, a live round gleaming off the setting sun as the round is getting chambered in front of the boys eyes.

Thankfully, an Archangel show came across the scene.

"Sally, what's wrong?" He asks gently as the girls attention snaps to the short boy.

"I'm... having a talk with Inigo, a very peaceful talk." She says with a slight blush, lowering her arm and folding the barrel back into her arm.

"Inigo, you were just complimenting her like usual, right?" Noah says, trying to create an understanding the between the embarrassed American and the slightly terrified Japanese boy

"Yeah, I meant it, you should take more pride in how you look, and... a lot of other stuff too."

"And as I was saying, there's this really nice café where we can work this all out, ok?  Best espresso I've ever had, and you look like you need it McCathy-san." Inigo says with a cheerful smile, with Noah nodding in a agreement. Sally growls lowly, but gives it up.

"Fine... but you're paying." She says as she follows them out of the school.

Helene Lysingen stretched out a bit as she fixed Old Lady Shirogane's radio.  She didn't have any customers to attend to, and felt the urge to tinker with radio the old woman dropped off. She could make it way more efficient, pick up more frequencies, and replace some of the components that were hit with battery acid from when she dropped it to break it in the first place.

She heard the bell on Thanks-a-Latte's door ring as she tied her apron back on, seeing two familiar customers and a foreign girl who looked thoroughly upset, probably because of the blonde Casanova that got her here.

"Hey Myoga, Abrams" the proprietress says to the two she recognizes, looking up at the slightly tall girl from the West.
(TL note: All dialouge spoken in English will be done in {Fancy brackets} )

"{Welcome to Thanks A Latte, what can I get you?}" She asks gently as the girls seems surprised that she speaks English.

"{Thanks. Black coffee please, only a tiny bit of cream.}" Sally says, her eyes darting over to a slice of cheesecake. "{And one of these for Noah.}"

It was written all over Sally's face that she was invited out as the boys order beverages, with Noah insisting on picking up the bill.

"Darn, I just remembered! This place has a 2 person per booth limit!" Inigo says as they look for a seat.

"Really? Why?" Sally questions.

"To make sure you pay attention to the people you came with! Trust me, me and Lysingen-san are pretty tight."

"So, I'll leave you two to chat!" Inigo says to Sally's surprise.

"Oh... and I'm interested in seeing you play, McCathy-san, not just seeing your ass during play." He says to anger the girl, as if testing how much she really wanted to sit down with cutest boy in class. She gives him a mean look that says "Fuck off" regardless of what language you speak. Inigo laughs it off and sits near the counter.

================================================================
Sally sits awkwardly as she sips at the coffee. It tasted too sweet, not like dad's back home.

"Sally, I know Inigo can seem rude at times, but he doesn't mean harm." Noah says to break the ice.

"But I've heard he harasses every girl in the school when he gets the chance. How's that not harmful?"

"He doesn't mean to harass, he means to compliment you on your beauty. And you are very nice looking, Sally, I can tell you put in a lot of effort to fit in here." Noah says with a good natured smile toward the girl which starts to melt her heart a bit.

"I'm just... not used to all this formality. I used to wear sweatpants and hoodies to school and hit the range after to blow off whatever steam I gained during the day, but now I've gotta dress nice and act nice or I get written up." Sally with her frustrations coming out.

"And to be seen as eye candy for guy in class who feels me up!? You want me to just leave that shit *unpunished?*"
Noah puts a hand up to try and get Sally to calm down: “Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you."

"...That's in Matthew..." Sally says with a guilty voice.
"If anything, Inigo is a trial to overcome, but not one of firepower or skill." Noah says.

"But of self-control."
Sally looks at her tired eyes in the window's reflection. She couldn't use jet lag as an excuse anymore.

"Yeah... I've not been sleeping well anyways." Sally says.
"I usually stay up till... 2 or 3 AM playing shooters on American servers just so I can feel like I'm at home for a few hours... I miss Montana a lot."

"It's ok to be homesick. Just try and control it for your own sake, ok?" Noah says as he sips at his hot chocolate.
"If you're tired and irritable, then the Devil in you wins more often than not."

Sally smiles a bit, sipping at her own coffee.  The sweetness didn't taste as bad now.

=================================================================
"Let me guess, Myoga: Girl from your class you pissed off." Helene asks the boy as he sips on his espresso.
Inigo nods as he watches their booth.

"So why aren't you over there giving her a mock therapy session? Seems like the perfect date idea."

Inigo shakes his head. "I can tell when I see a good couple. These two are birds of a feather."
"Really?" Helene says with a chuckle as she washes some glasses out.

"They're both Christian, and while Sally is fiery and determined, Noah is calm and cute in his own way. It's like peanut butter and jelly, and I'm sandwiching them together." The boys says.

"So she's not gonna get any more compliments at school?" 
"Never said I wasn't gonna keep trying my own luck." Inigo says with a wink toward the proprietress.

"You'll ruin their wholesome little schtick if you go too far, lover boy."
"Hey, I think that anyone who can use scripture to calm the gun nun down is the one." Inigo says with a chuckle.

"Gun Nun?" Helene asks, being quickly shown pictures of Last Rite and told of her exploits as the class 1-D's best sharpshooter.

==================================================================
Sally sits in her pit of a room at midnight, lying down on her mattress.  She hadn't changed the sheets in a few weeks and could smell it as she watched her fan whirl besides her. 

She sends a text to Noah:

"Are you available sometime after school? I need some help sorting something out." she types, quickly setting her phone down and closing her eyes.

Her head hurt, both the cowardly side of her that's afraid of seeing animal guts and the violent side that killed two crooks debating over whether or not it's okay for her love someone as nice as Noah. Even if it was just hormonal bullshit, it felt real. And even if he didn't love her back... she realized she needed a few things before she could ever go home any better than she left.

Firstly, she needed to clean up her act and stop wallowing in regret. This is her life for the next year at least, and God made her come here for a reason.  Taking that out on others was just as much a sin as tagging them in the leg with .22s for schoolgirl bullshit.

Secondly, she looked at her apartment; A mess in every right. Her parents were convinced by her that she was responsible enough to not live in a dorm, and when they come to visit, this place needs to look like someone who doesn't play Milsims till 3:00 AM every night.

Noah said that started with a good night's sleep, so she turns her computer off and lays down, hoping for pleasant dreams of heaven...
