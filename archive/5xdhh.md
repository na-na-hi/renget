## Reincarnated as an OP micro

>Got isekai'd by van-kun
>goddess is going to send me to a world mostly populated with anthro animals of varying species
>get to pick out a bunch of cool powers
>strength, durability, cool magics, whatever seems fun
>goddess has one last thing before I go
>I have to spin the "wheel of handicaps" and take whatever one I land on
>none of these look fun, but I guess my powers can compensate for most of them
>wheel clicks past Blind, 80 IQ, no legs, and it slowly clicks one more to land on 1/12th
>goddess giggles as I ask what that means
>few seconds later and I'm a six inches tall and everything fades to black
>goddesses laughter echoes as I appear in a massive forest
>I sit down on a mushroom to contemplate situation
>a hungry looking rat (actual rat not a rat person) begins to approach me
>try out fireball
>well the rat is gone
>and most of the forest that I could see
>so at least magic power doesn't scale to size
>unfortunately the explosion seemed to draw over some anthros
>some peasant rabbits being led by a trio of adventurers
>a large tigress in full plate with a war hammer
>a vixen wearing robes and carrying a spell book
>and a weasel girl in a cloak with a bow
>hopefully I didn't just destroy the kings forest or something
>I hide in a burned out tree trunk to be safe
>vixen is making a chant
>I hear hushed whispers followed by the heavy steps of the tigress approaching my hiding spot
>better use the teleport spell
>should get me a mile or so away
>shadow of tigress falls over my trunk as I poof away
>I screwed up
>teleported into the middle of the sky
>falling over the burned out section of the forest
>I didn't think I burned that much and as I'm falling I look back
>yeah, I'm maybe 200 yards away from the trio
>so some of my magic scales, super
>teleports on cooldown, falling quickly now
>vixen is pointing at me
>an arrow the size of a telephone pole barely misses me as it flies past
>that weasel manages to launch three more before I hit the ground
>each one was way too close given my size and her distance
>durability and ashes mean that I at least land uninjured
>tigress and weasel are approaching rapidly
>wall spell, good ole reliable wall spell
>fuck, a 12" wall 6' wide isn't stopping them and it marked exactly where I am
>an arrow flies and that war hammer blocks out the sun
>I flinch
>an arrow bounces off an invisible barrier and the tigress drops her war hammer
>I open my eyes and see that some strange transparent box with glyphs on it has encased me
>the vixen is approaching slowly and as she finishes the chant the glyphs disappear
>so I'm stuck in a magic box as my three captors stand over me
>"must be some kind of fae creature" said the weasel
>"not ugly enough" said the tigress with worryingly hungry look in her eyes
>"we'll were not taking it to the guild hall until we found out if it burned down this forest or not" said the vixen
>she made a motion with her hand and my box floated upwards
>"ladies if I may..."
>now I had their full attention
>"I did burn down the forest, but it wasn't on purpose"
>"see there was a rat, and I used the wrong spell, which I'm very sorry about"
>"you should be" said the vixen "there's a little village on the other side of that grove"
>"they thought a dragon was attacking and we're here to deal with it"
>"wait" said the weasel "you did all this over a rat?"
>"mistakes were made"
>"well that's too stupid to be a lie" said the tigress
>as they discussed what to do with me I went through my spells
>I had a disillusion spell to get rid of 'illusions and magical constructs'
>I used it on the box which instantly shattered
>before I could even start to fall the weasel grabbed me out of the air
>she had a knife twice as long as I was tall next to my throat
>"woah, woah, woah, I'm not going anywhere" I said
>"I just tried a little spell and it worked too well" I said with a smile "again"
>"that was my strongest binding" the vixen said sounding very off put
>before any more conversation could be had a deafening roar was overheard
>a huge shadow swept past all of us
>"of course the real dragon shows up when we're stuck without cover" said the tigress
>"she thinks your fireball was a challenge on her territory by another dragon" the weasel spat
>"after she comes for us she's going after that village"
>the vixen had her spell book out "let him go, we need your bow now"
>I was thrown to the ground but my teleport had refreshed by now and i used it
>I reappeared on the vixens open spell book
>"let me try to make amends, I can help with the dragon"
>the dragon was circling overhead
>she was going wide and clearly planning to bear down on our position
>the tigress looked back "forest dragons are vulnerable to fire..."
>"I doubt he could manage another one like..."
>she didn't get to finish her sentence as I unleashed fireball, level 2
>everything turned orange as it rocketed toward the diving dragon
>on impact the conflagration erupted
>the weasel, tigress, and vixen squinted or shielded their faces
>a thoroughly charred dragon skeleton crashed into the earth and its skull rolled to our position
>all three of my new companions starred down at me
>"so now that that's taken care of, could you three possibly tell me where I am?"
