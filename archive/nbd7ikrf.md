#Masukuda Rarime Non-standard Jutsu List

(Light Release is made by forming the lightning release handsign with both hands joined together in the manner of the bird handsign).

###Light’s Anathema: Cloak of Night
Masu causes light to slide off of her rendering her effectively invisible. The opening handsign for this and the two jutsu directly below is an inverted light release seal.

Rat

###Light’s Anathema: Congress of Night
As above but Masu extends the range of her jutsu to cover her allies. This causes a more obvious distortion than just covering herself.
>handsign
Rat, Hare, Snake, Bird

###Light’s Anathema: Sun Eater
The pinnacle of her Light’s Anathema techniques, Masu devours the light around her to plunge her immediate area in complete darkness. 
>handsign
Rat, Hare, Snake, Bird, Boar, Light

###Light Release: Radiant Arrow
What it sounds like, this is a blast of light.
>handsign
Snake, Dragon

###Light Release: Star’s Reverie
Masu unleashes her chakra in a blinding burst of light to blind and temporarily disorient her opponents (this is not a genjutsu, it’s actual light)
>handsign
Monkey, Dragon, Bird, Dog, Horse, Tiger, Dragon, Boar, Bird

###Light Release: Heaven Splitting Sword
Masu materializes a blade of solid light. She is not very good with it yet, but its cutting power is incredible. Intended for imminent assassinations, the handsigns needed are so complex that she probably can’t use it in an actual fight and would instead start forming her handsigns from concealment before leaping for the kill just before the last ‘Snake’ sign.
>handsign
Snake, Monkey, Tiger, Snake, Horse, Dragon, Snake, Dog, Ox, Snake, Bird, Rat, Snake

###Moon’s Mirage
A simple illusory art designed to be used with only half a handsign. The illusion is usually of Masu making a fake strike, used to open the target for a killing blow.
>handsign
One-handed Monkey

###Light Refraction Dance
Masu’s full-strength visual genjutsu. She eventually intends to mix that with light-based constructs to confuse her opponents. 
>handsign
Monkey, Rat, Dog, Bird
>What constructs?
She’s working on it okay?!

###Warning Bells
Masu constructs a simple barrier to alert her when its area is breached. The cost of maintaining this barrier is negligible. Masu constructed this jutsu to guard her while she slept.
