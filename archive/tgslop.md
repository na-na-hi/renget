## FAQs

>{feature} isn't working!
Put the statement early in the prompt, put it in scare quotes, find redundant ways to state it throughout the prompt. Eliminate any prompts that might contradict it or cancel it out. If necessary you may have to change the style/artist to one with more precedent for the feature.

>It only does portraits, not full body!
Describe the footwear in detail, describe the floor/ground around them, describe their surroundings in a way that forces it to zoom out, describe actions, like walking, that want to show the legs/feet. In general prioritize the surroundings primarily and the subject secondarily.

>{artist} isn't working!
In general, artists have to have a certain high volume on the internet to affect the robot. There also seems to be a bias against living artists, probably to avoid lawsuits. Start with the simplest prompt possible to make sure you're not contradicting the artist's style with other prompts. Please point out artists that work well so they can be added to the artists section.

>Negative prompts don't work!
Yeah, they don't unfortunately. Maybe in a future update. Until then you need to find positive ways of saying the same thing. And yes, Bing will try to tell you things like using double hyphens before a prompt will eliminate it, but it's lying.
