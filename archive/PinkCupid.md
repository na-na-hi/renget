#Profile

Quinci "QT" Trinquet

##One line description

##Physical description
I'm a cute shortstack with pink hair~ 6 wings~ halo~ not much clothing~ and heart-shaped pupils in my pink eyes~

##Personality
It doesn't feel honest talking about my little self~ Why don't you talk to me and find out~?

##Backstory
I came to this world as a non-celestial woman in the despairing deeps of a high-level dungeon overestimating the difficulty. I was such a fool~ Leaving Arc to shape my fate for a month was another stupid mistake. I wish no one what I experimented in that month that ended up being way more than that. When I finally escaped I was a changed woman with a holy mission that Mastema approved.

-Enjoy lewd shenannigans from time to time.
-Chilling~
-Maybe experience a non-tragic romance for once~

##Status
Single but Dere Dere for Pandora at the moment~

Silly talks and non-serious adventures and chosen missions~
Open to casual lewds~
