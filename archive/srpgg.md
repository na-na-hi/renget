#FAQ/Q&A
###What is solo role playing?
Solo role playing is a form of role playing where you play completely by yourself as both the player and to a certain extent the GM. Many solo RPG systems use oracles, which are tables of words and ideas, to answer questions and give inspiration to the solo player so that they can focus on playing instead of being the GM.
 
###Why should you play solo?
Unparalleled freedom, allows forever GMs to experience being a player, lets people unable or unwilling to find a group experience TTRPGs.
 
###What does solo play have over say writing or /qst/ing?
- "Well the randomness from the dice, tables, and other systems take the game in directions you wouldn't think to, so it's unpredictable. That's pretty much it: randomness."
- "Would necessarily use the term "over." Soloplay has it's own sets of challenges when compared to writing, running or playing in a /qst/, or cobbling together or using a CYOA. Oracles are not always kind, neither are the dice or cards. A lot of times you're forced to push forward with non-optimal choices, and in a lot of cases you have to accept loss or defeat. It can be a lot closer to a solitaire wargame, like the pocket ones they sell for travel or camping."
- "Solo play is what you want it to be - it can part writing, part rolling and interpreting within an oracle and system, or it can be mostly rolling and going through the scenario in your head. You could play something similar to a /qst/ that goes in ways you don't expect - without voting - because of the dice rolls; you could face a bad situation that gets worse, then the character performs poorly, creating tension and twists where you wouldn't find it writing. Some of the quality will depend on how you setup your random tables and game, some on your interpretation and imagination - it's not something you can pick up and do at a high level without some experience and practice."
 
###How do I get started?
Play Ironsworn or use a system alongside Mythic GM Emulator, Conjectural Roleplaying Gamemaster Emulator, or MUNE. If you struggle to get things moving watch the first episode of Me, Myself and Die which demonstrates how solo play works (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9ag6U3a8eM )
 
###What systems/tools are available?
There are all sorts of different systems, tools and play aids available. Da Curated Archive has some solo troves with plenty of them, and you'll also find some in the rentry: This document has a list of various tools and systems, keep scrolling down.
 
###What do you recommended for Systems, Oracles, and Games?
- "You want to play fantasy? Ironsworn."
- "Mythic is kinda fiddly and some people don't like the chaos mechanic - I think the newer oracles that use clocks for interrupts on No results have better elegance. The rest of the system is solid and the variations are good but roll heavy and require some system expertise to work, so it's not just pick up and play. It does have a lot of good supplements you can use with or without Mythic, such as the Adventure Crafter, Location Crafter and Creature Crafter. MUNE, Zathrum, Apocalypse Oracle are all simpler and effective oracle systems. They work best when tacked onto an existing RPG system, though. For these, you generally want to find other tables and - I'll call them themed oracles because I'm not sure what to term them - tables that have specific outcomes that you find lacking in your game (dialogue, encounter, scene, seed, etc). UNE is a good example of these and the author has a few other short books that are solid. I suspect most of people use a mish-mash of stuff they like if they play for more than a few sessions."
- "Oracles like 9 Questions and Perilous Intersections are solid and very useful if you feel your solo play is directionless or you struggle with making your adventures feel dramatic."
- "Journaling solo rpgs lean on a mixture of oracles and prompts in order to progress the story. The nice thing about most of them, such as the Wretched & Alone series, is that it is a very fluid and quick system, with a lot of variations--however the prompts are usually limited, so you get more out of these types of games if you're willing to include your own prompts if you enjoy a particular game or setting."
 
###What games are/aren't solo friendly?
- "Crunchy games. It seems like most people like simple games. So avoid things like Shadowrun, GURPS, HERO, or any kind of majorly crunchy game."
- "Technically speaking you can run any system you want solo. However, crunchier systems can be challenging to run alone and generally aren't recommended for beginners to solo play."
 
###How do I create scenes?
- "A scene is created by either randomly generating a prompt from a generator/oracle (The Adventure Crafter, Picture Dice, Word generators, etc) and then interpreting the results to fit the game currently being played; Or alternatively by manually thinking of a scenario for your characters to find themselves in during play"
- "Either use a prompt from an oracle/random table or think of a scenario on your own."
 
###How do I conduct combat?
- "Combat is conducted through the same means conducted during group play of an RPG. Your system will outline the rules of combat and you follow those rules the same way you would if playing normally, such as assigning each character initiative or tracking positions in battle. Any aspect of combat can be simplified, skipped, or expanded on to your liking at any time during play such as simplifying combat to just one or two rolls or treating a combat encounter with the same depth as a tactical game"
- "In terms of mechanics the normal combat mechanics of your game should work fine. As for deciding what NPCs will do during encounters, you can either consult an oracle or make the decisions yourself. You can find a simple, universal oracle for NPC behavior below. https://drive.google.com/open?id=17JMSEmxMh_icbepdc4ej070yzWAp2Mko "

###Writing Tools
Obsidian, a note taking program with hyperlinks https://obsidian.md

Useful plugins for Obsidian:
-5e statblocks- comes with everything in the SRD but you can load this one with statblocks downloaded from 5e.tools and other places
-Admonition- allows you to customize cool collapsible text boxes that clearly separate what you put in them from the main text. Great for oracle rolls, combat details, skill checks, etc. in-line with your adventure but kept completely separately.
-Advanced Tables- lets you navigate tables with the arrow keys
-Dataview- not RPG specific but important plugin
-Dice Roller- nuff said
-Obsidian Leaflet- allows you to embed images as maps and set a custom scale which lets you drop pins on the map, measure distances between points (if you set the scale), and create routes
