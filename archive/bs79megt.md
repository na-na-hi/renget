#Everything Wrong With the Two of Them 2
The hall was dimly lit by the soft glow of a single lamp, casting long shadows across the walls and floor. 

The villa lay in disarray, its once grand halls now silent and empty save for the faint echoes of their footsteps. Mio and Sandatsu wandered aimlessly through the deserted corridors, their movements slow and languid.

Eventually, they stumbled upon the room they were looking for, its entrance partially blocked by fallen debris. Sandatsu moved forward with a casual grace, effortlessly clearing the way with a wave of his hand. 

The kitchen was a mess, utensils scattered haphazardly across the countertops and cabinets left hanging open. No way Mio was eating there. The pair meandered through abandoned rooms and shattered doorways as they kept looking.

Sandatsu yawned loudly, his eyes half-lidded as he shuffled along beside Mio. "You'd think this place would have more than one kitchen," he muttered, more to himself than to Mio.

Mio shot him a sideways glance. "Well, if you hadn't trashed the place, maybe we would be having an easier time looking for it," she snapped.

Sandatsu merely shrugged, unaffected by her barbs. "%#69748c%It was necessary,%%" he replied nonchalantly, his tone betraying no hint of remorse.

Rolling her eyes, Mio continued to lead the way.

As they rounded a corner, Mio suddenly halted, her gaze fixated on a door at the end of the hallway. "Ah, finally," she muttered under her breath, a hint of relief in her voice. This kitchen had been unaffected by Sandatsu's rampage.

Mio wasted no time in rummaging through the cupboards. Sandatsu watched her with mild interest, his gaze drifting lazily around the room as he waited for her to find what she was looking for. However, Mio soon gave up with a groan. "Ugh. I'm too tired for this. Cook something already so we can go back to sleep.".

"%#69748c%Alright, what do you want?%%" he asked, his tone resigned but not entirely unwilling.

"This kitchen is probably filled with expensive delicacies. Just make whatever, you idiot."

"%#69748c%Works for me,%%" he replied with a shrug.

He moved around the kitchen with a fluidity, using his quirks to move ingredients around. Psychokinetically lifting pots and pans, using embers to control the heat himself, sprouting more arms to multitask...

As the aroma of cooking filled the air, Mio watched with interest, her gaze following Sandatsu's every move. Despite her usual demeanor of indifference, there was a flicker of curiosity in her eyes as she observed him at work, her arms folded across her chest as she watched Sandatsu with a mixture of annoyance and grudging admiration.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity,he turned to Mio, who was lounging lazily in a nearby chair. He had a platter of steaming food in each of his many hands. 

"%#69748c%Voila,%%" he declared, gesturing grandly to the feast before them.

Mio couldn't help but steal a longing glance at the mouthwatering spread. She tried to suppress the growl of her stomach, but it was no use. The aroma was too intoxicating to resist. Her appetite won out, and she eagerly dug into the hearty meal.

"%#69748c%So, what do you think?%%" he asked, his tone teasing. "%#69748c%Not bad, huh?%%"

Mio shot him a glare. "Shut up. I'm trying to forget you're here or else it'll taste like shit."

"%#69748c%I guess you really like it.%%"

 She chewed thoughtfully for a moment.

"It's... tolerable," she finally admitted, her tone grudgingly conceding a hint of approval.

Sandatsu chuckled, delighted by her reluctant praise. "%#69748c%Tolerable, huh?%%" he repeated, a playful gleam in his eyes. "%#69748c%I'll take that as a compliment.%%"

"Seriously, can't you like, go look for a corpse to chew on or something?"

"%#69748c%Already did, there aren't that many left.%%"

"Just shut up you're ruining my breakfast!"

"%#69748c%Alright, alright. I'll let you enjoy the 'tolerable' breakfast I made that you seem to love so much.%%"

"AUUUGH!" She threw a fork at him.

As Mio reclined on the floater, the water of the indoor pool gently lapped against the sides, creating a soothing rhythm. The soft glow of underwater lights cast a tranquil ambiance, illuminating the serene scene. With a drink in hand, she savored the moment, basking in the luxury of the untouched pool area.

"This is the life." she muttered to herself, filled with satisfaction. "All this luxury, all this peace, just mine for the taking."

After a while, she felt the water stopped flowing.

"Hey, idiot, make more waves," she commanded.

Sandatsu had been floating nearby, his body weightless as he lay on his back, eyes closed, allowing the water to support him. With a casual wave of his hand, he used his 「Psychokinesis」quirk, sending ripples coursing through the tranquil pool. 

They spent quite a bit just like that, floating, relaxing in silence.

After quite a while, as the waves gently rocked their surroundings, Mio shifted her gaze towards Sandatsu. "There's nothing left for us here, you know? You've recovered already, and this place will be swarming with heroes soon."

Sandatsu nodded in agreement, his gaze fixed on the undulating surface of the water. "%#69748c%Yeah, you're right,%%" he replied "%#69748c%What's the next move you have in mind?%%"

"Aren't you the leader?"

"%#69748c%Damn right. That's why I'm ordering you to suggest something.%%"

Mio sighed softly, her mind already racing with plans and possibilities. "What about Kovak?" she asked. "He helped us out after you returned his precious D-78, but I doubt he'll be joining us."

"%#69748c%He can go rot in some lab for all I care.%%"

"And the surviving organizers?"

"%#69748c%Already planned what to do with them.%%"

"Did you really come up with a solid plan? Have you finally learned how to use that mushy piece of trash you call brain?"

Sandatsu shrugged nonchalantly. "%#69748c%Anyway, maybe we could return to Kyoto? There's some stuff I want to do there.%%"

"Oh my, does hobo boy miss his shitty tent?" Mio's fingers trailed lazily through the water as she spoke. "Wait, be honest. Do you miss school?" she asked, her tone curious.

Sandatsu shrugged again, his gaze fixed on the rippling waves he had conjured. "%#69748c%Not really,%%" he replied, his voice casual. "%#69748c%But hey, if we return maybe we could see your sister.%%"

"Why did you bring her up out of nowhere?"

"%#69748c%Oh come on. When I used「Blood Puppet」on you I took the chance to go through your memories. I think it's pretty clear how obsessed you are with her.%%"

"That's absolutely disgusting. Don't ever do that again. Seriously."

"%#69748c%I expected you to get angrier.%%"

"I'm trying to dissociate, retard. Same thing I do to forget half the disturbing shit you do."

"%#69748c%Huh, fine. What about you. Do you miss Kyoto?%%" He watched her closely, waiting for her response with a hint of amusement in his eyes.

Mio hesitated for a moment, her gaze drifting away as she considered her answer. "Kinda," she finally admitted.

Sandatsu grinned, seizing the opportunity to tease her. "%#69748c%Missing all those stuffy hero wannabes? Acting like one of them?%%" he quipped.

Mio shot him a scathing glare. Sandatsu was floating near her, and he used the chance to deliver a heel kick to his face. Sandatsu sank slowly, but laughing.

 "Shut it, idiot," she retorted.

Despite her initial defensiveness, after a while Mio's demeanor softened as she reflected on her time in Kyoto. "But... pretending to be someone else," she admitted, her voice trailing off slightly. "It was... kind of fun. Exhausting after a while though."

Sandatsu raised an eyebrow as he resurfaced. "%#69748c%Well, what a surprise. The psycho misses ruining lives by manipulating and subverting others while acting all innocent.%%"

Mio bristled at his words, but before she could complain Sandatsu kept talking.

"%#69748c%Don't you miss your sister?%%"

"Don't you miss your mother? You psychopath." Mio said. Sandatsu however, was unfazed and just shrugged.

After a short silence, Mio was the one to continue talking. "It's not... exactly like that," she finally responded, her voice tinged with a hint of uncertainty. "It's more... I feel uneasy when she's out of my reach."

Sandatsu nodded pretending to understand. Without a word, he extended his hand towards the water, his fingers curling slightly as he summoned his psychokinetic abilities, lifting the mass beneath them into the air.

Mio, who was probably thinking about her sister, failed to notice Sandatsu's antics until it was to late.

Mio's heart skipped a beat as they were suspended above the pool, a rush of adrenaline coursing through her veins. "Sandatsu, I swear—" she began

But before she could finish her sentence, Sandatsu released his hold on the water, sending them plummeting back into the pool below with a resounding splash. The water enveloped them, swallowing them whole as they crashed back down with a wave of frothy bubbles.

As they resurfaced, gasping for air and sputtering with laughter, Mio shot Sandatsu a glare, her eyes alight with bit of amusement despite her earlier protest. "You're such an idiot," she chided him, her tone a bit softer, though still exasperated.

Sandatsu grinned in response.

"Stop fucking around," Mio snapped as she settled back onto her floater, her brows furrowed in irritation. "And get me another drink."

She watched as he climbed out of the pool and made his way towards the nearby bar.

With a heavy sigh, Mio leaned back against her floater, her fingers gripping the edges tightly as she tried to shake off her frustration. "Is he braindead or something? Never taking anything seriously, for fucks sake..." she muttered to herself, her annoyance evident in her tone.

Sandatsu emerged from behind the bar, carrying a tray with two drinks balanced carefully upon it. He settled onto the edge of the pool, his gaze meeting hers as he handed her a drink.

"%#69748c%Here you go,%%"

Mio accepted the drink, obviously without saying thanks, taking a sip as she listened to Sandatsu's words.

"%#69748c%It's not that I don't take things seriously,%%" Sandatsu began, his tone gentle yet firm. "%#69748c%It's just that my priorities are different than yours.%%"

He paused, taking a sip of his own drink before continuing. "%#69748c%You need to take it easy for a while. Stop overthinking things and just say what you want.%%"

Mio's brow furrowed, but she just took another sip instead of talking back.

"%#69748c%You see, if you want to take it easy and not be on the frontlines anymore, I'll make that happen. And if you want to visit your sister again, I'll make it happen too.%%"

Mio remained silent for a second, before finally speaking. "Alright, I'll take it easy. But on two conditions."

"%#69748c%Yeah?%%"

"First, you better really take care of everything. Because the main sources of stress for me are **you** and your fuck-ups. Got it?"

"%#69748c%Yeah, yeah. And the second?%%"

"The second is don't ever talk all reassuring like that, ever. It creeped me out."

"%#69748c%Thank god, yeah, it felt disgusting for me too. Calling you a bitch and annoying you feels way more natural.%%"

The home bowling alley was a hidden gem within the sprawling villa, tucked away in a secluded corner where it had remained safe from the destruction. Mio and Sandatsu stood side by side, each holding a bowling ball in hand as they surveyed the polished lanes stretched out before them.

Mio stepped forward, her movements careful as she lined up her shot.

But just as it seemed she would achieve a strike, the ball wavered in mid-air, its trajectory altered by an unseen force. Mio's eyes widened in disbelief as it veered off course, missing the pins by a narrow margin. She turned to Sandatsu with a scowl, her annoyance evident in the furrow of her brow.

She whirled around to face Sandatsu, her cheeks flushed. "What was that?" she demanded.

Sandatsu flashed her a playful grin, his expression unapologetic as he shrugged. "%#69748c%Whatever are you referring to?%%" he replied, his tone casual.

"You cheated!" she accused.

Sandatsu chuckled, raising an eyebrow in mock innocence. "%#69748c%Really? Aren't you just a sore loser.%%"

"I'm literally seeing your memories, retard."

"%#69748c%Guilty as charged,%%" he admitted shamelessly. "%#69748c%But I only did it because I knew you'd feel worse if I beat you through pure skill.%%"

Mio scowled at him, her lips forming a stubborn line as she crossed her arms over her chest. "You're insufferable,"

As they continued their game, Mio explained her plans for the group. "We're going to pillage everything we can from this place to finance the Wild Hunt. I've already given Ivan the order to set everything up."

"%#69748c%You really micro managing everything, don't you?%%"

"Excuse me?! I'm the only one bothering to plan things like these! Have you done a single thing besides act all high and mighty?"

Sandatsu raised his hands in mock surrender after throwing his ball. "%#69748c%Hey now, I've been doing plenty of thinking,%%" he protested, his voice tinged with feigned hurt as he scored another strike. "%#69748c%Like about the next quirks I'd like to steal.%%"

Mio scoffed at his words, shaking her head in disbelief. "Of course, always thinking about yourself," she remarked. "You're quite the bad leader, you know that?"

"%#69748c%Well, lucky for me, you're here to keep me in line,%%" he replied, his voice tinged with amusement. "%#69748c%Someone's got to keep this operation running smoothly, right?%%"

"Ugh, you're a lost cause..." Mio glanced out the window at the desolate landscape that stretched before them, a mixture of awe and unease flickered across her features. The destruction wrought by Sandatsu's power was evident.

"So, what quirks are you after?" she finally asked, tearing her gaze away from the scene outside and turning back to Sandatsu.

Sandatsu chuckled at her question, his expression light and carefree. "%#69748c%Oh, just a couple I decided to go after on a whim,%%" he replied nonchalantly, as if discussing the weather rather than his insatiable thirst for strength.

Mio raised an eyebrow in disbelief, her skepticism evident in the arch of her brow. "Just a couple?" she repeated incredulously. "Do you even need more? You're already disgustingly overpowered as it is."

Before she could press further, Sandatsu's mischievous grin returned, and with a flick of his wrist, he used his psychokinesis to make her bowling ball veer off course once again, missing the pins by a hair's breadth.

"Hey!" Mio exclaimed, her frustration evident in her tone as she shot him a glare. "Cut that out!"

As she delivered a few frustrated kicks against his legs in retaliation, he merely chuckled.

The frigid air whipped around them as they stepped out of the villa, greeted by a vast expanse of snow-covered landscape. The towering mountains loomed in the distance, their peaks shrouded in mist, while the dense boreal forest spread out beneath them like a sea of green and white.

Mio grumbled under her breath, her irritation evident as she stomped through the thick snow. "There's no way I'm hiking all the way there," she muttered, shooting Sandatsu an annoyed glance.

Sandatsu chuckled, his breath forming wispy clouds in the chilly air. "%#69748c%Don't worry, I'll take you,%%" he said, his tone teasing. "%#69748c%But no flying, right?%%"

Mio scowled at him, her cheeks flushed with anger. "Yeah, no flying," she snapped.

With a grin, Sandatsu suddenly lunged forward, wrapping his arms around Mio's waist before she could react. And then, in one swift motion, he launched them both into the air with a powerful leap, leaving the ground behind in a flurry of snow and chaos.

Mio screamed in surprise and outrage, her protests drowned out by the rushing wind as they soared through the sky.

The biting cold air stung their cheeks as Mio and Sandatsu landed near where Drekus was located. They found him standing in front of the makeshift tombstone, his silhouette barely visible beneath the thick blanket of snow. His breath formed frosty clouds in the air as he turned to acknowledge their presence with a solemn nod.

Sandatsu approached him without hesitation, his steps crunching in the snow, while Mio followed closely behind. Drekus remained silent, his gaze fixed on the crude outline of flowers etched into the tombstone.

"%#69748c%So? How you holding up?%%" Sandatsu reached out with his hand, fingers crackling with faint embers, and began to melt the snow that surrounded Drekus. The icy flakes sizzled and evaporated as they came into contact with the heat, revealing more of Drekus's form beneath.

Meanwhile, Mio shivered in the cold, her breath visible in the air as she hugged herself tightly. Without a word, Sandatsu turned his hand towards her, the embers dancing at his fingertips. Mio approached, holding out her hands to soak in the warmth radiating from the flames.

"Tired." Drekus finally spoke.

Sandatsu let out a chuckle. "%#69748c%I get you. But no worries, I'll take care of everything.%%"

"%#69748c%You see, Drekus,%%" Sandatsu began, his tone measured yet earnest. "%#69748c%We've been through a lot together, and I want you to know that I've got your back, no matter what. You want to take down the doctor and completely destroy all of the research you were involved in? Sure. You want to simply go away, do your own thing? I understand. Hell, if you asked me to put you out of your misery I would, buddy.%%"

Drekus nodded slowly

"%#69748c%You know, Mio here could probably erase all those painful memories of yours if you wanted.%%"

"Don't bring me into this conversation. This is between you schizos." complained Mio.

"%#69748c%Can it.%%said Sandatsu, before directing his attention back to Drekus. "%#69748c%Anyway, there's another option on top of those. Or rather, a mix of the other choices.%%

"Secret option?" mumbled Drekus.

Sandatsu nodded. "%#69748c%Yeah. I'll carve out a little corner of my new world just for you. No heroes breathing down your neck, no schemes to unravel. Just you, doing whatever the hell you want. Trust me, I've got it all figured out.%%

"Comrade is crazy. Mushy brain." said Drekus.

"%#69748c%Oh come on, have some faith in me.%%said Sandatsu. "%#69748c%You see, the way things really are you will never find peace. No matter where you go, problems follow right?%%"

"Drekus like to travel. But always heroes come. Hurt Drekus," Drekus muttered.

Sandatsu nodded solemnly. "%#69748c%That's right. No matter what you do, the heroes will keep coming. No matter how many times the experiments stop, there will be new psychos to pick up the baton. It's like a never-ending cycle of pain and suffering, and you're stuck right in the middle of it.%%

"But... what can Drekus do?" Drekus asked.

"%#69748c%Well, for starters, how about whatever I tell you to? Anyway, think about it, Drekus,%%" Sandatsu said, his tone light and unconcerned. "%#69748c%You've got all the time in the world to decide. For now, let's head back to the villa. There's a storm coming, and I'd rather not get caught in it.%%"

"Comrade... you are crazy, really mean those words," he exclaimed, his voice tinged with equal parts admiration and incredulity.

Sandatsu's laughter rang out across the desolate landscape, the sound echoing against the towering mountains and whispering pines. "%#69748c%The crazy ones are them, man. The world is already mine. It's just that they haven't realized it yet.%%"

---

The shattered remnants of the once-grand hall echoed with the sound of Sandatsu's arrival, his presence commanding attention as he strode confidently into the room. Debris swirled and shifted around him, coalescing into a majestic throne upon which he seated himself with an air of authority.

Ivan, the epitome of calm amidst the chaos, sat serenely at a makeshift table, savoring a cup of tea as if the destruction around them were nothing more than a minor inconvenience.

On the opposite side of the table sat Mio, rollig her eyes after seeing Sandatsu's entrance. Ookami Shizuka stood firmly by her side.

Feral leaned nonchalantly against a broken pillar, and near her, perched upon a rugged boulder, sat Drekus, his form hunched slightly.

The atmosphere in the hall grew tense as Ivan's henchmen ushered in the defeated figure of Amatsu, his once proud demeanor now replaced with a simmering rage that seemed to radiate from him like heat from a furnace. His eyes blazed with fury as he glared daggers at Sandatsu, who regarded him with a cool detachment that only seemed to stoke the flames of Amatsu's anger.

Sandatsu reclined in his makeshift throne, a lazy smirk playing at the corners of his lips as he addressed the disgruntled villain before him. "%#69748c%Well, well, well, look who decided to grace us with his presence,%%"

Amatsu's lips curled into a snarl as he shot back, "You think you've won, boy? You may have bested me this time, but mark my words, I'll have my revenge."

Sandatsu chuckled dismissively, waving a hand as if swatting away a bothersome insect. "%#69748c%Save your threats for someone who cares, old man,%%" 

Mio, for her part, watched the exchange between Sandatsu and Amatsu with a satisfied smirk, reveling in the defeat of her adversary.

Amatsu bristled at the dismissal, his fists clenched at his sides as he seethed with frustration. But before he could retort, Sandatsu continued, his tone laced with a hint of amusement.

%#69748c%"However,%%" Sandatsu added, "%#69748c%I could use someone with your... experience.%%"

Amatsu's voice reverberated with anger and frustration as he spat out his words, venom lacing each syllable. "Go fuck yourself, insolent brat! You killed my next vessel, condemning me to wither away and die like some feeble old man!"

Sandatsu's expression remained impassive, his eyes cool and indifferent as he regarded Amatsu with a detached curiosity. "%#69748c%Is that it? That's why you tried to kill me?%%" he remarked, his tone nonchalant. "%#69748c%Well, isn't that a shame.%%"

With deliberate languidness, Sandatsu rose from his makeshift throne, the debris beneath him shifting and rearranging itself with a faint hum of psychic energy. He took slow, deliberate steps towards Amatsu, his movements almost leisurely despite the tension.

Amatsu's muscles tensed as Sandatsu drew closer, his hands curling into fists at his sides. Despite his anger, a flicker of fear danced in his eyes as he watched Sandatsu approach.

"You think you can just waltz in here and do as you please?" Amatsu growled, his voice defiant even as he braced himself for whatever retribution Sandatsu might mete out.

"%#69748c%Why not?%%" he replied with a shrug. "%#69748c%After all, it's my world now. You're just living in it.%%"

「No Tricks, No Gimmicks」+「Charge Up!」+「Conduit」

Sandatsu's lips curled into a smirk as he unleashed the full force of his rewind quirk. Time itself seemed to bend and twist around Amatsu, his form flickering and warping as the effects of Sandatsu's power took hold.

In an instant, the aging villain was transformed before their eyes. The lines of age faded from his face, replaced by the smooth contours of youth. His once grizzled hair turned lustrous and black, his muscles bulging with newfound strength.

As the process reached its climax, Amatsu staggered, his body trembling with the strain of the transformation. He looked around in disbelief, his eyes wide with wonder at the sight of his rejuvenated form.

As Sandatsu's hand made contact with Amatsu's shoulder, a surge of power pulsed through him.

「Hijack」

The quirk factor within Amatsu's body was reignited, sending ripples of energy coursing through his veins. Amatsu gasped in shock as he felt the familiar sensation of his quirk awakening within him once more.

 "%#69748c%Consider it a bonus,%%" Sandatsu said. "%#69748c%You should be grateful for my generosity.%%"

Amatsu could only nod mutely in response, his mind still reeling from the sudden turn of events. He cast a wary glance around the room, his gaze lingering on the faces of the other members of the Wild Hunt.

Sandatsu's gaze bore into him. "%#69748c%That should be all,%%" he said, his voice low and menacing. "%#69748c%No more complaints. Understand?%%"

Amatsu nodded weakly.

"%#69748c%And now we can talk for real.%%" said Sandatsu as he returned to his throne. "%#69748c%First things first, I want you to contact Marshall again.%%"

Amatsu struggled to answer. "You killed him. Made the hivemind collapse."

Sandatsu's eyes narrowed as he stared down Amatsu, his patience wearing thin. "%#69748c%Don't play dumb,%%" he growled, his voice laced with menace. "%#69748c%You know exactly what I'm talking about.%%"

Amatsu recoiled slightly.

"%#69748c%I may have killed *most* of the hivemind. But I've seen how he operates, I've been in his shoes.%%" he continued, his voice low and dangerous. "%#69748c%He's the kind of man who always has a backup plan, always has a contingency in place. He's not done yet, and is probably rebuilding his operation as we speak.%%"

He knew better than to underestimate Marshall, to dismiss the possibility that he had left behind something to ensure his survival.

After considering the situation, Amatsu nodded. "I'll make sure to establish contact as soon as possible," he promised. "Contact might be established in two days, but it will take longer for him to be fully operative."

Sandatsu leaned back in his makeshift throne "%#69748c%Two days, huh? Not bad,%%" he remarked, his tone tinged with approval. "%#69748c%Anyway, before I continue. You know the situation you're in, right old man? You have two choices: cooperate or suffer the consequences.%%"

Amatsu's jaw tightened, but he remained silent, his eyes fixed on Sandatsu with a mixture of defiance and resignation.

"%#69748c%If you try anything, I'll know,%%" he continued, his tone still casual. "%#69748c%And believe me, I'll find you. And when I do, you won't live long enough to regret it.%%"

"%#69748c%But,%%" Sandatsu said, his tone softening slightly, "%#69748c%if you do as you're told, there'll be benefits for you. Wealth, power, protection. Everything you could ever want.%%"

He knew he had no choice but to submit to Sandatsu's will if he wanted to survive. And if there was a chance he could gain something from it, perhaps it wasn't all bad.

With a resigned nod, Amatsu lowered his head, his defiance crumbling in the face of Sandatsu's overwhelming dominance. He knew he would have to play by Sandatsu's rules if he wanted to survive in this new world order.

Sandatsu's lips curled into a satisfied smirk as he watched Amatsu's surrender. "%#69748c%Anyway. As for our next step. Well, you all are heading back to Kyoto,%%" he declared.

Feral's brow furrowed in confusion as she processed Sandatsu's words. "Wait. 'We'? Are you staying?" she questioned.

Sandatsu nodded in affirmation. "%#69748c%Yeah, I'll stick around for a bit longer,%%"

Mio's reaction was immediate and visceral. She spat out her tea in shock, her eyes widening in disbelief. This was the first she had heard of Sandatsu's plans to remain behind, and the news caught her completely off guard. "What?!" she exclaimed, her voice rising in astonishment.

Sandatsu held up a hand to quell any further interruptions. "%#69748c%I want everything prepared for my return to Kyoto,%%" he continued, his tone leaving no room for argument. "%#69748c%Before I go back, I plan to go hogwild myself.%%"

He turned to Ivan, designating him as the field leader. "%#69748c%You'll be in charge while I'm away,%%" he declared, his eyes meeting Ivan's with unwavering resolve.

Feral and Drekus exchanged surprised glances at Sandatsu's decision. It was usually Mio who took care of the management side of things, and they couldn't help but wonder at the sudden change.

Mio, however, was the most taken aback of all. She stared at Sandatsu, disbelief written all over her face.

"%#69748c%Oh, and bring the old man along,%%" he commanded, his voice carrying authority. "%#69748c%And help organize the contact with Marshall again.%%"

Feral nodded, her expression serious as she mentally began to strategize. "Understood," she replied, her gaze flickering to Amatsu, who remained silent, a simmering anger burning behind his eyes.

Sandatsu continued explaining his plans. "%#69748c%We'll need to gather resources from Amatsu's yakuza clans,%%" he stated matter-of-factly, his confidence unwavering. "%#69748c%Though I doubt money will be a problem after our little adventure here. But, their connections could be useful.%%"

 "%#69748c%I trust you to manage the funds of the group accordingly,%%" he added, turning his attention to Ivan again.

Ivan's response was immediate and unwavering. 

"You can count on me," he affirmed, his loyalty to Sandatsu evident in his every word.  "With the upheaval you caused on the criminal scene, my cult has found a chance to expand exponentially."

Sandatsu listened intently. Ivan's gestures were animated, his hands punctuating each word with fervor. "We're seeking to grow and claim more and more resources," he explained, his voice rising with enthusiasm. "Cannibalizing the territories of the villains that you've killed or scared away."

Sandatsu leaned back in his makeshift throne with a satisfied smirk. The plans laid out before him were promising.

The moon hung low in the night sky, casting a silvery glow over the sprawling landscape below. Sandatsu stepped onto the balcony, his footsteps muffled by the soft carpeting beneath him. His eyes fell upon Drekus, who stood at the railing, his silhouette outlined against the moonlit horizon.

"%#69748c%Hey there, pal,%%" Sandatsu greeted casually, his voice cutting through the quiet of the night. "%#69748c%Mind if I join you?%%"

Drekus turned to face him, his expression still weary.

"%#69748c%You see, brooding is a hobby of mine, actually.%%"

Drekus nodded. Sandatsu moved to stand beside him, leaning against the railing as he gazed out at the landscape spread out before them.

"%#69748c%You know. Having been in a situation close to yours, I can say, you've got it hard.%%" he said. 

Drekus nodded in understanding, his gaze thoughtful.

"%#69748c%We have a lot of things in common. The color blue, we snatch the quirks of dead people, our brains have given us more problems than our enemies... But there's one more thing.%%"

"What thing?"

"%#69748c%We both like beautiful scenic locations.%%"

The topic brought up by Sandatsu made Drekus subconsciously focus more on the kind voice inside him. Ever since they had arrived, the voice had been barely audible.

"%#69748c%You see, I remember this one place,%%" Sandatsu began, his eyes distant as he recalled the memory. "%#69748c%It's hidden deep in the mountains, far away from the chaos of the city. During the summer, the sky there is unlike anything I've ever seen.%%"

Drekus listened intently, his expression softening as he allowed himself to be drawn into Sandatsu's tale.

"Place sounds pretty." Drekus remarked, a hint of wonder in his voice.

Sandatsu nodded. "%#69748c%Yeah, it really is,%%" he agreed. %#69748c%"And hey, once all this is over, we could go check it out together. You, that nice little voice in your head, and me.%%"

"It sound good," Drekus said. "But how does comrade know about the little voice?"

"%#69748c%Don't worry about it, really. In any case, I can't say I like most of the other voices that much. So I thought the least I could do is shut them up for you.%%" said Sandatsu, as he produced a small vial full of a grey liquid. A modified version of the antipsychotics he had used himself.

"%#69748c%You know. That kind voice inside you isn't the only one that wants to see you happy.%%"

Sandatsu turned away from the balcony, and it was then that he caught sight of Feral, leaning casually against a nearby pillar, her sharp eyes watching him with a mix of curiosity and amusement.  She raised an eyebrow as he approached.

"Well, well, look who's playing the role of the wise leader," she remarked. "I was just about to have a little chat withhim out there, but it seems you've beaten me to it."

"%#69748c%What can I say? Sometimes I like to take matters into my own hands,%%" he replied.

Feral rolled her eyes, pushing herself off the pillar. "I'm sure you've got everything under control."

"%#69748c%Damn right I do.%%"

They strolled through the dimly lit hallways of the villa, their footsteps echoing softly against the polished marble floors.

"%#69748c%So,%%" Sandatsu began, casting a sidelong glance at his companion, "%#69748c%you really seem to treat Drekus like family.%%"

Feral nodded. "Damn right I do."

Sandatsu chuckled.

"%#69748c%And speaking of family,%%" Sandatsu continued, "%#69748c%wasn't there another girl with us in Kyoto?%%"

"Yeah. Karma. Why?"

"%#69748c%Maybe you could ask Karma to arrange a meeting between me and the Night Parade leader. It could be... enlightening.%%"

Feral let out a hearty laugh at his suggestion, the sound echoing off the walls of the hallway. "Sure, I can try," she replied. "But no promises. Karma can be a bit... unpredictable."

Sandatsu laughed. "%#69748c%Hey, it's worth a shot, right?%%"

Feral nodded in agreement, her gaze lingering on Sandatsu for a moment longer than usual. "You know," she mused, "talking to you like this feels way different. You seem lucid."

"%#69748c%Ha! What do you mean? I wasn't that bad before,%%" Sandatsu quipped with a playful smirk.

"Oh please," she replied. "Let's not forget the time you ripped off my arms to clone me."

"%#69748c%Okay, fair point,%%" he conceded. "%#69748c%But in my defense, I needed a little extra muscle for that job.%%"

"Heh. Not sure if it's worth having my arms chopped off, but having you around definetly made things more interesting."

"%#69748c%Well, I'll take that as a compliment.%%"

"Has it been as fun for you? Being king of outcasts, I mean. Don't you miss life on the other side?"

"%#69748c%Do I miss life on the other side?%%" he echoed, reflective. "%#69748c%Parts of it, I suppose. There were moments.%%" He paused, his gaze drifting to the distant horizon beyond the window. "%#69748c%But overall? I'm not so sure.%%"

"And your days as a hero student?" she prompted, her curiosity piqued.

"%#69748c%Maybe? I definetly miss my friends a bit.%%"

Feral crossed her arms casually as she continued the conversation with Sandatsu. "Actually, I had a run-in with one of your classmates once," she said, her brow furrowing in concentration. "Can't quite remember her name, but she had this thing with poison and hydra heads. You know who I'm talking about?"

Sandatsu's eyes lit up with recognition as he nodded. "%#69748c%Oh, that's Orochi, she was the only other regenerator in our class.%%"

Feral's face lit up with excitement as she recalled the encounter. "I gotta say, I liked that fight. She put up quite the challenge. Like nothing else mattered except survival, a pure interaction between predator and prey."

"%#69748c%You and your opponent, stripped of all distractions... those are the ones that really get your blood pumping.%%" Sandatsu said.

"Oh, so you get it?"

"%#69748c%Nah.%%"

Feral laughed. "Then shut up."

Sandatsu pushed open the door to Mio's room, expecting to find her lounging lazily. However, before he could even utter a word of greeting, Mio was on him like a whirlwind of fury.

"What the hell, Sandatsu?!" Mio spat as she stormed towards him, her eyes blazing with anger. "You think you can just waltz in here after forgetting about me during that damn meeting?"

Sandatsu raised an eyebrow. He held up his hands in a placating gesture, trying to calm her down. "%#69748c%Whoa, whoa, chill out,%%" he said, his voice calm and monotone, which annoyed her even more. "%#69748c%I didn't forget about you. I just had some other stuff in mind.%%"

Mio scoffed, her lips curled in a snarl of frustration. "Other stuff? Like what, huh? Making plans with those lowlifes while leaving me in the dark? Real classy, retard."

"%#69748c%I just had other plans for you,%%"

"Don't give me that bullshit. I don't need you to make decisions for me. I can decide what to do for myself."

"%#69748c%I wasn't trying to order you around," he said. "I just thought%%—"

"You thought wrong, you goddamn retard!" Mio interrupted, her voice rising in anger. "I don't want your plans or your orders. All I want is to be kept in the damn loop, to know what the hell is going on around here."

Sandatsu leaned back in a chair, his gaze fixed on Mio as she continued to fume. Despite his attempts to defuse the situation, her anger still simmered beneath the surface, like a volcano on the verge of eruption.

"%#69748c%Damn,%%" Sandatsu said, shaking his head in disbelief. "%#69748c%You've got enough fire in you to light up the whole damn town.%%"

Mio's eyes narrowed dangerously at his comment, her fists clenched tightly at her sides. "You think this is funny?" she spat, "You're lucky I don't punch your sorry ass right now."

"%#69748c%Yeah, that'd be as high as you could hit I guess.%%" he teased.

"Shut up."

The night air was cool as Sandatsu and Mio stepped out onto the balcony after arguing some more. The soft glow of the moon cast long shadows across the rooftop.

"%#69748c%You know, I gotta admit, I was surprised when I found out you were getting along with the others,%%" he remarked casually.

Mio scowled, her arms crossed tightly over her chest as she glared at him. "What's that supposed to mean?" she snapped.

Sandatsu shrugged, unfazed by her hostility. "%#69748c%Just saying, you seem to have a bit of a soft spot for them,%%"

"I don't like those freaks one bit."

Sandatsu raised an eyebrow. "%#69748c%Really now?" he replied, his tone taunting. "So you've just been pretending to get along with them this whole time?%%"

"It's not like that," she muttered, her voice tight with frustration.

"%#69748c%Sure sounded like it,%%"

"You're such a goddamn prick, you know that?" she said, her voice laced with venom. "Always poking and prodding."

"%#69748c%You know you love it. The attention.%%"

Mio's anger boiled over as she unleashed a tirade of complaints. "For fuck's sake, Sandatsu!" she exclaimed, her words punctuated by sharp gestures. "You're always so goddamn annoying, constantly poking your nose where it doesn't belong! You really think I like you that much?"

She paced back and forth on the balcony, her fists clenched at her sides as she continued her rant. "And don't even get me started on this whole mess you've dragged me into," she said, her eyes blazing with fury. "I had to leave everything behind, participate in fucking assassinations, and drag your sorry ass all the way to Europe when you got your dumb ass got your quirk factor damaged!"

Her voice rose to a crescendo, echoing off the walls of the empty villa as she vented her frustrations. "I even fucking overdosed for your sake!" she shouted. "And what do I get in return? More of your bullshit!"

"%#69748c%You must really like me a lot if you've done all that for me.%%"

This caused Mio's anger to explode again, going on another speech about how that wasn't true. Sandatsu watched her tirade unfold, his expression unreadable as he listened to her grievances.

"I can barely stand you and I being on the same planet!" As Mio's fury gradually subsided, she stood before him, chest heaving with exertion, her eyes blazing with pent-up rage. "So what do you have to say for yourself?" she demanded.

"%#69748c%Don't you ever stop complaining?%%" he said.

Mio shot him a glare. "You want me to shut up? Then make me," she retorted, her tone defiant.

With a flick of his wrist, Sandatsu unleashed a burst of psychokinetic force, silencing Mio's protests as her mouth snapped shut. She struggled against the invisible force, her muffled grunts of frustration barely audible.

After a moment, Sandatsu released his hold on her, allowing her to speak once more. Mio shot him a scowl, her cheeks flushed with anger. "That's not what I meant, you idiot,"

Sandatsu chuckled. "%#69748c%I know,%%"

"I doubt it." Mio's eyes narrowed. "Prove it."

He really knew.
