#Reine Rises

The morning sun shines on a prosperous kingdom. The light bathing its many vistas and settlements. One can hear sounds of people and their establishments going about their morning routines in preparation for their business of the day. While in the less populous areas, the gentle sounds of the local flora and fauna sound the start of nature's day-time cycles. And on one hilltop, lay a grandiose castle of fine white marble and dark azure decor. 

Upon this castle too, the sun shines upon. Casting its light across its surface, and through its fabulous windows, where one could see the movement of plenty of servants and menials. The windows show the halls busy with such people moving back and forth. In the rooms and chambers, the work is much slower but no less busy. Figures of authority both bellowing orders and meticulously inspecting the work of their subordinates occupy those large spaces.

Though many of these windows reveal the hectic state of affairs within, some show little in the way of activity. Through one of these windows is a gleaming white bedroom. The sun casting its light through the room, and the white interior letting the light spread throughout, failing to reach only the interior of a magnificent bed curtained by dark azure fabric, and the princess that lay asleep within. The dark canopy and the soothing silence of the room combined with the masterfully tailored bedding kept the princess comfortable in her slumber.

That is until...

*CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG*

“EEEK!?”

The loud clanging of wood and steel breaks the soothing silence of the room and effectively scares the Princess awake.

“Good morning, Princess Reine. I hope you had a good sleep.” The servant greets.

“I was having a good sleep until you ruined it!” Retorted Reine, still dazed from being suddenly woken up. “Why'd you have to do that!?”

“Well we don't exactly have the luxury right now to figure out a way to wake you properly, your highness. We all have things to prepare for today.” The servant answers, to which causes Reine to calm down and remember.

“Oh, right. So today's the day, huh?”

------

Reine was given a quick breakfast and a thorough bathing with the help of her personal maidservants. What transpires today would not be of her choosing. The Princess had an obligation to follow, and now her maidservants were meticulously grooming her in front of a mirror, ensuring that Reine looked beautiful. Her hair brushed finely, so not even one strand stood out, then tied and braided beautifully. Her clothes as well, were being put together meticulously, ensuring that they were not only a perfect fit, but also a sight to behold. The maidservants could be heard telling each other that some articles of clothing were no good for even having a single kink on them, needing to either retrieve a substitute, or find a way to fix it with haste.

Reine, meanwhile, was staring at the mirror. Not inspecting her appearance, but looking deep into her own eyes. Because she knows that starting from today, things will never be the same again.

“Something in your mind, dear?” A woman's voice asks from the side.

Reine breaks her trance and turns her gaze to the woman.

“Nothing important, mom.” The Peafowl Princess replied. 

“Your face says otherwise.”

Reine sighed. “Like I said, mom, its not important.”

“Not important for everyone but you, perhaps? Dear, don't be like that. You can be open with me. What is it that is bothering you?” The Mother asks as she moves closer to her daughter.

“...” Reine returns her gaze back into the mirror again. “Its just... all this... its so sudden... Today marks the end of being a princess and... becoming Queen... My whole life... instantly changing like this, its... overwhelming...? I don't know...” 

A commoner would think of ascending to the throne to be marvelous, but to Reine, it was different. Sure, she may gain unquestionable authority over the realm, but what is weighing on her mind right now, was not the throne, the coronation or anything one would typically associate with a monarch.

It was everything else that made her life fulfilling until today. Her passions and hobbies, fun personal projects, and most important to her, is her friends. Once Reine becomes queen, there is no doubt that most, if not all of these would be forced away from her. Not only because of her responsibilities as the sovereign, but also the strict rules that came with her rank.

Reine has to leave behind her life as a princess, as part of ascending to queenhood.

“Dear...” Her mother steps in front of her. “I know you have things that you don't want to leave behind, but you can't be a princess forever. I've been in your place before, I know what its like.” She smiles at her daughter. “And I can assure you, dear, that its not as bad as you are thinking. What you might miss when you become queen, will not vanish from existence. It will not be the same, yes, but you will have moments to revisit those old pleasantries. And when you do, you will have newfound appreciation of the life you lived.”

Reine felt her mood lighten a little. Her mother made a good point. Her princess life wasn't vanishing like a book being burned. All her passions and friends will still be there, somewhere. And if they are still there, she can still visit them, even if for only a moment. But the most important bit was the last. Her mother was right. She was not going to forget her past. She made many memories with everyone and everything thus far in her life.

Reine smiled a little. She may want to be a princess a little longer, but one thing is certain. Reine will forever cherish her time as a princess.
