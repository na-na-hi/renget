Another Royal Marriage by anonymous

>Be Prince Anon XII
>Your predominantly-human kingdom is bordered by another with a dynasty of wolves
>Because you two do so much business together, the families are well acquainted with one another, including their son
>You remember when you first met he was super shy, along with being at least 4ft shorter, but overtime he became way more friendly
>Maybe a bit too friendly
>It was around when you two were teenagers that he started getting touchy-feely with you, constantly making excuses to hug you, stroking (sniffing) your hair, "accidentally" squeezing your rear
>Then the games started
>Apparently hide-and-seek is a huge game back home, and naturally, he wants to share it with you
>You probably wouldn't have too much a problem with it, except that you're always hiding and he's always seeking.
>Whenever you ask why, he claims he's just giving you the advantage because you're so "tiny" and "flexible"
>Also he always insists on being naked, says that all his fancy clothing just gets in the way
>He keeps suggesting for you to do the same but fuck that
>The game's not even fun anyway, it lasts like 5 minutes tops due to OP wolf senses; you're batting 0-213
>He can't ever just tag you either, he'll yank you from behind, pick you out from a tree, full-on pounce on you, etc.
>If that wasn't enough, he likes to gloat over all his wins as well
>Gripping you tight in his arms, claws dug in barely enough to not draw blood, shoving your entire body into his fur as his hot breath steams down your back, repeatedly calling you "his"
>You wanna make a complaint, but you're too worried about accidentally offending his culture and souring a relationship between two powerful monarchies, so you just hold your tongue.
>You hope that he eventually grows out of it someday, but you're both in your 20's so you're not sure when that's supposed to happen
>Maybe when you both become king and get married off to some princesses he'll be too busy to play
>Every time "marry" or "the M word" is brought up near him, however, and he becomes visibly uncomfortable
>And even clingier during your "play" sessions
>Fast forward a few years
>That whole marriage thing wasn't working out well for either of you
>Your parents kept trying to set you up with suitors, each of them turning you down with ever-increasing blows to your self-confidence
>Weirdly enough, every single one of them had audibly mentioned during your time together that you reeked of dog, even the humans
>You obviously knew the source of it, but there wasn't much you could do about it; no matter how much you showered, the scent of the wolf prince lingered on
>Speaking of him, his dilemma was the exact opposite of yours
>He had turned down every single advance from potential brides, his harem of spurned women spanning the entire animal kingdom
>You figured he had high standards, which was fair, being as handsome as he was (no homo), but you felt that something else may be at play
>As the meetings between your two families shifted towards discussion about their respective perma-virgin sons, you tried to ask him about it, but it never went well
>He'd either dodge the question or flat-out ignore it, unable to hide the frustrated look on his face, only for him to take his displeasure out on you during your hide-and-seek games
>He never really hurt you per se, but he sure as hell was getting rougher, either knocking the wind out of you or almost leaving your with whiplash when he caught you
>Without even a chance to breath, your face would be shoved into his chest, choking on his thick fur as he wrapped his massive arms around you, smothering you
>His mocking remarks were now laced with tinges of a deeper, snarling tone, sometimes even growling as he spoke
>The few times that you had caught a glimpse of his eyes, his almost feral glare sent tingles down your spine
>You weren't sure what kind of blue balls this dude had, but by now you were really hoping he'd settle down with someone real soon
>You made silent prayers for the poor soul who'd end up with him as a husband
>Finally, you had a stroke of luck; someone had finally agreed to marry you!!
>Some feline lady from the land of whogivesafuck, at this point you were desperate for anything with a hole, and you and your parents were relieved knowing their son wouldn't be ending their bloodline
>You were originally worried about telling the wolf prince about it since he had yet to find his match, but it's not like he was in the same situation as you to begin with, plus he was gonna figure out anyway
>You regretted your decision the minute it left your lips, as you were pretty sure you just watched his heart snap in real time
>For the first time in your life you saw weakness in him as his expression deteriorated into unmistakable sadness
>You tried to reassure him, telling him that his one true love was just around the corner for him, but your negotiations were for naught
>Even after offering him the position of best man, he excused himself in a choked up voice, not before you caught a glimpse of tears welling in his now glossy eyes
>He even left without his usual game with you, something you never thought you'd feel so awful over
>The following few meetings with the wolf kingdom, you couldn't help the prince was absent, along with overhearing gossip from his family mentioning his sudden onset of depression, which really didn't help with your own emotions either
>Even as your parents and future bride began to ride your ass over the approaching wedding, the feeling of guilt had yet to escape you as you worried that you'd soured a friendship forever, no matter how odd it was
>Soon, however, the overwhelming burden of politically-sanctioned marriage overtook every waking thought and action, as you tired endlessly to meet the needs of your current and future family
>You started to get cold feet, as it sunk in that you were gonna sign your life away to some girl you didn't even like
>Maybe the wolf prince had the right idea with his stubbornness
>God, you really missed him
>It's now a week from the wedding
>If there wasn't heavy makeup covering the dark circles under your eyes, you'd probably get mistaken for a raccoon
>The past few months have been the most draining you've ever had in your life, all for the reward of a loveless marriage and responsibility
>You're tailor's making last-minute touches on your wedding suit when you hear a knock at your door
>It's your father, telling you that the wolves are hear to deal with some issues regarding the future alliance with your fiancee's country
>It's the last thing you wanna deal with right now, but you don't really have a choice
>You make your way down to the conference hall, mentally preparing to check out during the upcoming snooze-fest of a discussion, not bothering to pay attention to your surroundings
>Or right in front of you, you realize as you run headfirst into a brick wall of a figure
>You're about to let loose weeks of pent-up stress on whoever's sorry ass wasn't looking where they were going when you do a double take
>Holy shit, it's him
>Before he can even speak you're embracing him in the biggest hug you can manage
>The role reversal shocks the both of you; you feel fur brush against your hands as his tail wags happily
>You've never been so happy to see him before, and it looks like he feels the same
>After the shock wears off, you two begin chatting once again as you make your way down to the conference hall
>You wanna ask him if he's okay, but you figure that can wait until the conference is over
>For now, you just wanna act like things are back to normal
>Coincidentally, just as your thinking this, he prompts you with a game of hide-and-seek
>You want to say yes, but the conference was gonna start soon, plus you were wearing an incredibly expensive suit
>He promises that it'll be quick, and that he won't get you dirty
>Fuck it, this would probably be the last bit of fun you two would ever have again
>As you agree, a contented grin forms on his face
>The evening sky is tinted with orange hues as the sun begins its ritual descent into the horizon
>You hope that he was being truthful about the quick part, if you stayed out here too long there was no way you would be able to find your way back on your own
>He give you your head-start as you dash into the dense foliage
>You try your hardest to not dirty your suit, as you flee from the inevitable
>You find a decent spot, and hunker down for a while as you wait for him to come searching
>And you wait, and you wait
>Seriously, what the fuck was taking him so long, it was gonna get dark soon
>"Soon" comes, as oranges shift to purple, and purple becomes soaked in black
>That asshole lied to you, didn't he?
>As you're busy fuming over him, the sharp crack of a branch snapping makes you jump
>You turn to face him, though it's not really helpful when you can't see 10 feet past your face, but it's definitely him, right?
>You call out his name; no answer
>You're pissing your pants in fear now, a second snap sends you into an adrenaline-fueled flight
>Fuck your suit, it ain't worth the life of royalty
>As you stumble through brush and branch, tripping over stones and roots, you hear the footsteps draw nearer, their heavy thuds growing louder
>Your throat burns, and your muscles are aching, yet you push on
>The once rhythmic footsteps take a sudden gap, and as you turn around instinctively, you feel a heavy mass ram into your chest, sending the both of you into a pile of mud
>Once he's on you, you recognize the weight and fur texture immediately; it really was him, that dickhead
>He has you pinned, one arm holding the two of yours above your head, the other by your side as support as he sits the rest of his weight on your legs
>You start shouting at him; he doesn't say a word
>He's not moving either, it's like having a building on top of you
>As you futilely try to free yourself, your shouts are interrupted by a wet piece of flesh invading your mouth
>By the time you realize it's his tongue, it's already been shoved down your throat, choking you
>It feels like a millennia before he takes it out, leaving a trail of spit that breaks off onto your cheek, tears in your eyes from gag reflex
>You ask him what the hell he's doing, this time responding with a growl that leaves you with goosebumps all over your body
>You hear him muttering to himself, something about it being "about fucking time."
>His free hand begins to pull at your suit, his claws effortlessly ripping it to shreds, leaving you completely exposed except for your underwear
>The cold air hits your naked body, making you shiver, the only heat source available being the wolf's hot breath steaming on your face
>You feel a claw softly drag against your chest, the tickling sensation eliciting an unwilling whimper from you
>He laughs in a low, husky tone, calling you a "pretty little thing;" you feel your stomach twist and your heart skip a beat
>You don't know why, but you want him to call you pretty again
>His teasing claw reaches one of your nipples as another comes together in a slight pinch, as they softly caress the sensitive skin
>The sensation makes you gasp, and his hot breath becomes focused on your neck as his massive jaws close in on your throat
>Even without his breath, you feel your face become flushed as his tongue drags against the smooth skin, sharp canines poking the tissue
>You try your hardest to stifle the noises from your mouth as the onslaught of strange pleasures torment you; your breath becomes heavy and hot as you reach your threshold
>When his jaws clench down on the bridge between your neck and shoulder, barely enough to draw a trickle of blood, you break as a labored moan escapes you
>It was embarrassingly girly
>He releases his grip on your throat, slowly bringing his jaw to your ear, whispering:
>"How do you expect me to stop when you make those cute little noises"
>You can't help but whine in response
>You suddenly became aware of a foreign appendage resting on you bare stomach
>Oh god, is that what you think it was?
>It was near boiling hot, and just from what was laying on you, you knew it was massive
>Shamefully, your first thought was how good it would feel to have his warm member steaming your insides
>As if reading your mind, he calmly states, "not yet, little one"
>Even if he wasn't pinning you into the dirt, you'd be waiting obediently like he told you to be
>He releases his weight off your pelvis as he brings his dick up to your lips
>"Kiss it"
>You close your mouth around the tip, tasting already-leaking precum
>"go deeper"
>You start to explore further down the shaft, tip nearing the back of your throat
>"deeper"
>You gag as you reach your limit, unable to go any further
>Understanding this, he responds by thrusting it down into your esophagus as you can't help but choke
>The tears really start to flow now, and the makeup that concealed your eyes' fatigue begins to run down your cheeks
>You hear him comment about you cute you look when you cry, as he repeatedly drives his thick slab of meat down your throat
>It hurts, but it feels oh so good, you can't help but enjoy taking it
>He picks up his pace, and you feel a twitching sensation as he begins to grunt and moan
>Faster and faster, until you feel his hand on the back of your head, slamming your face into his crotch
>You get a whiff of his musky scent as he savagely growls, his twitching cock now pulsing as ropes of sticky white fluid shoot down your throat
>It's a bitter, salty taste that you can't help but swallow in compliance
>The surge of fluids eventually finishes, and he brings his dick out, allowing you to gasp for air
>It's only a short breather before his paw is gripping your face, slamming you back into the muddy ground
>"I'm not even fucking close to being done with you"
>You lay face-down in the mud, ass pointed up to him as an offering
>His paw trace up your behind as it reaches the seam of your briefs, pulling it down your legs in a swift motion, now fully exposed to his whims
>His impatient paws start toying with the new skin, your ass being barraged by pinches and firm squeezes, along with a few spanks that made you yip in reaction
>All the while you can hear him softly giggling to himself
>Guess that ass-fetishist stereotype was true; fucking wolves
>You begin to feel warm, humid air condense your cheeks, and before you realize the source, sharp canines drenched in drool poke into the tissue
>As his teeth grasp into your backside, his tongue begins to coat his canvas with a layer of saliva
>It works its way towards the center, inching towards it's destination
>Tracing around the entrance to your hole, you whine as you brace for the inevitable, the slick flesh spearing the cavity
>As his tongue snakes his way through your insides, you try and embrace the odd experience with as much dignity as you can
>You feel it brush up against a specific spot, making your whole body clench involuntarily
>The prince takes note of this, and begins to focus the tip of his tongue on it, having fun with his new toy
>The overwhelming pleasure sends you into shock, once reserved moans now bordering on screaming as you start to lose control
>This only makes him go faster, of course
>Your dick was begging for attention, shaking as much as you were as precum dripped onto the wet soil below
>The pressure builds and builds; you can feel the rush of your oncoming climax, and you can't wait for it
>But just as you reach your peek, his tongue quickly retreats from it's assault, making you wail in frustration
>Of course he had to be a god damn tease
>Gently, like holding a pup, he lifts you up from the dirt, now sitting on his lap as he traces his tongue over the flesh wound on your shoulder
>The main event was about to begin
>You feel his dick poking your orifice, eager to play
>He asks you if you're ready
>You can only cry and nod your head
>As the tip slides it's way in, lubed by his drool, you shake uncontrollably, leaning back into the safety of his chest
>One arm wraps around your torso, the other softy rubs your head, running his fingers through your silky hair
>As his rod travels deeper, pain mixes with pleasure as your screams echo through the woods
>When it finally reaches the knot, he continues to console you, whispering praise into your ear about what a good boy you were, how good you were taking it, how pretty you looked right now
>You tried to respond back, only managing slurred gibberish in a shaky, high-pitched tone
>He chuckles, giving your earlobe a soft lick
>He pulls out slightly, rubbing your prostate as you moan
>Like an engine warming up, his dick starts softly pumping up and down
>His speed accelerates, force increasing as your neurons send fireworks to the brain
>As the shaft starts hammering your g-spot like a battering ram, your eyes lose focus as you appear nearly comatose
>The sensory overload fires any form of manual control; your hips instinctively buck up and down on his fat cock
>The wolf begins to growl as the two of you regress into feral animals, rational thought overran by instinct
>The familiar twitching feeling inside you starts once more, foreshadowing his second climax
>As the two of you reach the breaking point, you brace yourselves with each other's bodies, his claws digging into you as he starts to ramble:
>"Ffffuck you little whore, you have no idea how long I've waited for this--as if I'd let that bitch get anywhere near my fucking property--oh god, i fucking love you, I-"
>He interrupts his speech with a blood-curdling howl, as his knot breaches your insides, waves of hot cum flooding your one-virgin hole
>His force sends you into your own orgasm, crying out as you drench yourself with your own load
>You both take a few minutes to catch your breaths, lucky that you hadn't gone into cardiac arrest
>Clarity returns to the brain, as you begin to realize what you (he) had done
>You not only let your best friend fuck you, but you may have just forever tainted a centuries-old alliance of nations
>Imagine each other's kingdoms going to war over royal buttsecks
>You tried to free yourself from his knot; that wasn't happening anytime soon
>As you tried to formulate some sort of plan, a wave of drowsiness crept over you
>Fuck, you couldn't fall asleep, not now
>But man, you felt soooo comfy right now
>Your friend's(lover's???) body was like a radiator, his fur softer than fine silk; his rhythmic breathing a cradle rocking you back and forth
>You eyelids grew heavy, your body drawn to his warmth like a moth to flame
>No, not now, you can't succumb to desire once more, you had to--
>snore.wav
>Your dreams were particularly raunchy that night
>It was you and him, standing at the alter under an arch of vines and flowers, as a priest read you your vows
>He looked almost as handsome in a suit as he did without one, you yourself in clothes not torn to shreds
>As the ceremony ended, the priest asked each of you the big question
>"I do"
>"I do"
>He tells you to kiss your new husband
>As both your lips draw near one another, you heart flutters in anticipation
>You wake up in a sweat
