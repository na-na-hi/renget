#Too Good to Be True

The light of Yui's phone illuminates her tired and anxious expression. Her eyes carefully take in the names of each contact on her phone. It was **bizarre**. It couldn't have been more than a few months ago that the only numbers she had saved were Nocti's and the closest vet's. Now, there was a steadily growing list of her classmates forming. They were people she'd joked and laughed with. Who she worried over and had allowed herself to be vulnerable with. They were **friends**.

**Even that b- Hailey is here. Damn kids.**

Things seemed like they were going well from all angles â€” and that was the problem.

Belonging was an unfamiliar feeling. It was warm and dizzying in a pleasant way, yet it filled the delinquent with a sense of dread. The distrust street urchin in her couldn't help but wonder when the other shoe would drop. She'd had to fight tooth and nail to keep anything good in her life from being snatched away, and she didn't see why this would be the exception.

**What am I gonna do if it is?**

License exams weren't far off and eventually, her peers would start internships. She didn't expect to get one, but that wasn't the point. if things continued to go well she might actually graduate. She could be a Hero.

**Do I want to? I didn't even want to be here.**

The icy pit in Yui's stomach only grows at the uncertainty of how far she was willing to take her probation. Worse than that, it felt like she was lying to every name glaring at her. They were all moving toward something while she was just doing what was convenient.

"Meow!"

The soft, white fur of Ako's belly blocks Yui's vision as her phone is knocked away. It clatters on the floor as the delinquent grumbles beneath her cat, a bundle of thread shooting out to retrieve the device. However, Ako lets out a hiss as she pounces at the phone and snatches it away.

"Hey, give that back!"

Yui springs to her feet and chases after Ako, the cat squeezing herself into every nook and cranny she can as she leads her master around their quaint home. The small room only had a few pieces of worn furniture, but there were dozens of half-finished projects lying around that served as an impromptu obstacle course. While it usually wouldn't have been much of an issue, Yui knew fumbling around in the dark with her eyes unadjusted wouldn't end well.

Instead, scarlet strands follow the light of the phone's screen. Ako manages to deftly dodge threads for a while thanks to practice from pulling similar stunts in the past. However, with only so much space to run, the cat eventually finds herself gift-wrapped as Yui finally recovers her device. Just as Yui settles back into place, Ako lets out a yawn and curls up on her master.

Yui lies back and puts the phone away with a defeated sigh. It was late, and chasing Ako had distracted her long enough for her head to clear. She might as well quit while she was ahead.

"Yeah, yeah. I've had enough tonight too."

**I should get you a new toy.**

A victory tune plays and Yui clicks her tongue as Orochi shoots her a cocky grin.

"Whatever. It was close. I'd have had it if you weren't a cheater."

The delinquent snorts dismissively while the hydra proudly flexes her tails.

"What will your excuse be when I still beat you, Sagara?"

"I'll think about it while I cream you."

Yui flashes her own grin back, but the game in front of her is hardly a concern. A win **would** be nice, but what she really wanted was an opportunity to talk. That might have been easier to find if she knew what good a time to talk about her shitty feelings looked like. Her late-night worries were still gnawing away at her, and there was only one way to clear up her fears.

"You're doing it again."

Orochi's voice snaps Yui out of her thoughts. She narrows her eyes at her companion.

"The hell do you mean?"

"Overthinking. Just say wahtever it is, Sagara."

The delinquent rolls, more annoyed at herself than anything. Regardless, now was as good a time as any.

"Fine. I just wanted to know if..."

**If you'd hate me for not becoming a Hero.**

Her fist unconsciously clenches and she winces at the thought. She was sure she could word it better, but that was what she really wanted to know. That she even thought the answer could be 'yes' filled her with revulsion. She hated that she needed to ask. She hated that she couldn't just trust her friend.

"I, uh, wanted to know if your tails get cold."

Orochi shoots Yui a questioning look, unconvinced.

"Look, I need to know for somethin' special."

That much was true. Amongst her projects was a set of tail warmers she planned as a gift. Still, she glances away from Orochi and towards the cabinet's screen.

"Sometimes. You weren't hoping that the cold was my weakness, were you?"

"Pfft. Like I'd want your help kicking your ass." 

Yui grins and shoots Orochi a look as she selects a character for their next match. Somehow, it felt like she'd already lost.
