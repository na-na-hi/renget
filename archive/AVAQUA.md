Part 3: Coming soon ETA before the New Year (EDIT: Delayed. I've kind of needed to rework some shit to add more worldbuilding via conversation. I'll see if I can make it on the 7th)(... Yeah this has ballooned a lot. I'll probably split it off into another two parter I'll release later this month).

##Explanation
***

> Hey, this isn't an fic about Minato Aqua from hololive Gen 2 starring in an adult video!

Yeah, this originally started as a shitpost based around a joke that bounced around the thread about chuubas driving AVs, animal themed vehicles; more specifically this chain of 'this but' posting >>33148098 . I wanted to do something in the vein of that Animal Vehicle monster truck thing, but since I know fuck all about cars and driving I decided to make it about mechs instead

Originally this was just intended to be a bait and switch with the first part being entirely in dialogue without context, and the second being watching Aqua fighting in an AV (mecha) battle. It ballooned way past that due to me getting bit by the worldbuilding bug. I'll probably keep posting this when I get the inspiration for it.

>So what is this?
It's a sci-fi mecha fic about Minato Aqua piloting an Animal Vehicle, a biomechanical warmachine on two legs.
