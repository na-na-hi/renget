>Adorabella
Adorabella is a Pen from the other side of Pen Island, where the ground is flatter and so there are more farms and thus more conflict with Vaslen clans. She is from an old farming family that gradually took control over many lands and hired other families to work it, becoming pseudo-gentry through bloody landlording instead of bloody warfare. She spent her entire childhood on an enclosed estate with her cousins and the staff and was frequently bored to tears.

The only people allowed within the gates of the estate were the mercenaries that would act as guards and bounty hunters, the trusted delivery men in their burdened carts, and seasonal tutors for subjects the house ladies couldn't manage. (Belle had to sneak around to eavesdrop on many of those lessons, because the girls of the family were taught boring things like literacy, accounting, needlework, and music, instead of fun things like alchemy and history.) So it was a lot of seeing the same few faces constantly and being directly related to half of them.

Locally, it was a lot of rice in the wetlands, barley in the plains, and sheep where neither crop would grow. Turtle Clan in particular was usually causing problems from the land they were losing to Pen development, and Rabbit Clan would act as intermediaries sometimes and be accused of being spies at other times. Between that and the competition among different Pen families, that side of the island is more tense.

Belle had to cross a lot of ground to get to this side when she came of age and ran off from her arranged marriage. She still has both friends and enemies among the Vaslen because of that time. She has since sent money home as an attempt to buy forgiveness and considers it a success since there's been no angry letters (or professional assassins.) Plus she has an uncle that likes her and he might have helped smooth things over a bit.

Someday she might even sail the trade circuit back there and visit, but it won't be any time soon.

>Fio
Fio was not born in a village, but in a very prosperous landlocked city state far, far away from Pen Island. The main population were mostly mundane humans incapable of any special feats or magic, aside from her people. Their head-of-state was a king.

> Momo
Momo lives in a shack on the edge of the village after she was booted out by her parents for her continued backtalk and general misbehavior. Its furnished with clumsily-made furniture made out of the bones of her kills. It smells vaguely of weak alcohol and burnt meat inside.
