-> Coraline was originally a children's novel written by British author [Neil Gaiman](https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/neil-gaiman). The writing of Coraline began in 1990, yet wasn't published until 2002. When he first wrote Coraline, it was in honor of his at the time five year old daughter that enjoyed scary stories.  It was awarded the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novella, the 2003 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 2002 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers. Director [Henry Selick](https://movingimage.org/programs/henry-selick/) met Neil as he was finishing writing Coraline. Gaiman was a fan of Selick's [The Nightmare before Christmas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nightmare_Before_Christmas), so he invited him for a film adaptation of Coraline. [Laika](https://www.laika.com/who-we-are) produced the 3D stop-motion dark fantasy horror film in 2009, where it aired in theaters on February 5th at the [Portland Inernational Film Festival](https://portlandfilm.org/festival/), then on February 6th where it was then aired in the United States. <-

-> Coraline's budget was $60 million and box office was around $131 million. The animation style was stereoscopic 3D and made out of clay. It took around four years for the animation to be made. To create Coraline's world, they divided the LAIKA lot into 150 mini-sets. Spanning 183,000 square feet (about twice the area of a Manhattan city block). The crew spent over 800 hours painting 250,000 pieces of popcorn—pink on the outside, red on the kernel—to stand in as blossoms for the nearly 70 trees, which can be seen below. <-

-> 1. The two men that help Coraline’s family move reference to Jerome Ranft and Joe Ranft. The movers are modeled after these real life brothers, who worked with director Henry Selick on The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. Their van reads, "Ranft Bros. Moving Company." <-
