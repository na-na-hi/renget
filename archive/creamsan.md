##PROMPTS AND SETUP
***
Most of my cards contain <rules> tags, for formatting and instructions to the AI.
Add to your JB: `See the latest <rules> tag for instructions.`

Some of them use CoT. To remove those thoughts, add a regex script in SillyTavern:
Script Name | Find Regex | Replace With
--- | --- | ---
Anything you like | `/<thinking>[\S\s]+?<\/thinking>/` |

Tick in Affects:
- [ ] User Input
- [x] AI Output
- [ ] Slash Commands

Tick in Other Options. Choose A or B.

A. Complete removal of thoughts.
- [ ] Disabled
- [ ] Only Format Display
- [ ] Only Format Prompt
- [x] Run On Edit
- [ ] Substitute Regex

B. Retain thoughts, but filter them out of context.
- [ ] Disabled

##SCRIPTED CARDS INITIAL SETUP - QUICK REPLIES AND REGEX SCRIPT
***
Updated on **Jan-7-24**
Updated for the new ST QR setup. This new system is pretty neat, like you can now add your own QR set on top of mine. Requires the latest ST staging.
I still can't turn off the red /abort warnings though (dw about those).
Also, a more flexible regex setup. Only one script needed.

## Setup here:

1. Download the **card's QR preset and Utility preset** above.

2. Paste these json files in your **st folder/public/QuickReplies.**

3. In SillyTavern go to Extensions > QuickReplies. Enable Quick Replies. Click the Global Quick Reply Sets plus icon. And then select **creamsan**.

![1](https://files.catbox.moe/3tmuvj.jpg) 

4. For the regex script, go to Extensions > Regex. Click Open Editor.

5. Make the script from the table, copy and paste accordingly. **Only tick Substitute Regex in Other Options**, and save.

Script Name | Find Regex | Replace With | Update Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
`regexreplace` | `/{{getvar::regex}}/{{getvar::regexflags}}` | `{{getvar::toreplace}}` | Jan-5-24
 
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/rps10n.jpg) 
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/vsw2tp.jpg)

**And done.**

You'll know it's working if you get an initialization message when you select one of my scripted cards.
You may notice a new Send button in the input field. Use the **QR Send button (green) for scripted inputs**, and use the **normal Send button (yellow) for normal inputs**. For example, with Ms. Keyes' card, use the QR Send button when you want to automatically append your time and grade, and use the normal Send button when the test is over and you want to interact normally.
I would recommend using QR Send all the time though.

***
##IMAGE GEN SETUP
This is for my cards that have image gen.
I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to image genning though, let me know what's the best settings for this.
***

Go to Extensions > Image Generation. Follow my settings (especially the marked ones), pic related below.

![1](https://files.catbox.moe/b66okj.jpg)

Negative prompt:
`worst quality, low quality, EasyNegative, bad anatomy, bad hands, cropped, missing fingers, missing toes, too many toes, too many fingers, missing arms, long neck, Humpbacked, deformed, disfigured, poorly drawn face, distorted face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, out of focus, long body, monochrome, symbol, text, logo, door frame, window frame, mirror frame, multiple girls, revealing clothes`

**Some things to note (Gacha Lolis):**
- I have added some anti NSFW in my prompts, like "sfw" in the prefix or "revealing clothes" in the negative prompt. This is to prevent from being censored for "CSAM". Not that I know if it works.

***

Let me know if you find anything broken with my scripted cards.
