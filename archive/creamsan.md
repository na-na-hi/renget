##PROMPTS AND SETUP
***
Most of my cards contain <rules> tags, for formatting and instructions to the AI.
Add to your JB/prefill: `Follow the <rules> closely.` or something like that.

Some of them use CoT. To remove those thoughts, add a regex script to SillyTavern. Download this: [Regex script](https://creamsan.neocities.org/files/presets/removecot.json). Once downloaded, go to Extensions > Regex, click on Import Script, then select the file you downloaded (**removecot.json** should be the filename).

##SCRIPTED CARDS INITIAL SETUP - QUICK REPLIES AND REGEX SCRIPTS
Updated on **Feb-9-24**
Regex scripts can now be imported. Requires the latest ST version. There are some fixes in there too, like the pipe symbol is now properly escaped. If you're still in older versions, regex will probably break.
The red /abort errors are still annoying. No, nothing's broken, I think.
Extra setup further below for Image gen and JS.
***

### Setup here:

1. Download the **card's QR preset and Utility preset** above.

2. In SillyTavern, go to Extensions > Quick Reply. Enable Quick Replies, then import the files by clicking the import icon and selecting the downloaded files.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/srtb12.jpg) 

3. After importing, click the Global Quick Reply Sets plus icon, and then select **creamsan**.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/zj8p7d.jpg) 

4. For the regex script, download this first: [Regex script](https://creamsan.neocities.org/files/presets/regexreplace.json)

5. Go to Extensions > Regex. Click Import Script, then select the downloaded file (**regexreplace.json** should be the filename).
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/0zojv8.jpg)

**And done.**

You'll know it's working when you get an initialization message when you select one of my scripted cards.
You may notice a new Send button in the input field. Use the **QR Send button (green) for scripted inputs**, and use the **normal Send button (yellow) for normal inputs**. For example, with Ms. Keyes' card, use the QR Send button when you want to automatically append your time and grade, and use the normal Send button when the test is over and you want to interact normally.
I would recommend using QR Send all the time though.

##JAVASCRIPT SETUP
This is for my cards that use JS.
Follow carefully or you'll get mustard gas (jk, worst case, the card will not work)
Huge thanks to stscript anon for sharing how to enable JS with STScript: https://rentry.org/stscript
Be sure to check the link as it explains more about why we do this setup. I also copied some of the codes there.
***

###Browser extension:

You'll only need to do this once.

1. First, install a user script browser extension. I use ViolentMonkey. Other similar extensions should work too. Just search the Firefox Addons page or Chrome Web Store. These are all the ones I know:
- Violentmonkey
- Tampermonkey
- Greasemonkey

2. Open the extension settings. Look for a plus sign or something that allows you to add a new script.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/i0ed83.png)

3. Change the name, match, and the script:
- **@name:** Whatever you like
- **@match:** The url when you use ST, mine for example is: http://127.0.0.1:8000/*
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/uxk884.png)
- **User script:**
```
const sanitize = DOMPurify.sanitize;
DOMPurify.sanitize = str => str.startsWith("#STSCRIPT") ? str.replace("#STSCRIPT", "") : sanitize(str);
```
- What it should look like:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/8wb6gz.png)

4. For added security, replace `#STSCRIPT` with anything you like. This will act as a sort of password.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/xmud9i.png)
Even better, something like this:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/vo1b3q.png)

5. Save and close.

**Browser extension done.**

###Cards:

You only need to do this once per card.

1. Go to the card description. Look for the `{{setvar::pass::PASSHERE}}` macro.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/2hhwlw.png)

2. Replace `PASSHERE` with the same password you've set in the browser extension.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/9rdeg1.png)
.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/w3azsl.png)

**JS done.**

My cards have checkers to make sure your user script is working.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/7brflm.png)
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/jam3zk.png)

**Some things to note:**
- For cards with CSS styling within the chat, you should turn this user script off, or you'll miss out on the fancy stuff.
Here's an example of a card with css:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/a78kw3.jpg)
Pic below shows the <style> tag sanitized with the script on.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/e0fet5.jpg)
To turn it off, just press the toggle switch and reload.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/bhj8a3.jpg)

Please let me know how to fix this.

***
##IMAGE GEN SETUP
This is for my cards that have image gen.
I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to image genning though, let me know what's the best settings for this.
***

Go to Extensions > Image Generation. Follow my settings (especially the marked ones), pic related below.

![1](https://files.catbox.moe/b66okj.jpg)

Negative prompt:
`worst quality, low quality, EasyNegative, bad anatomy, bad hands, cropped, missing fingers, missing toes, too many toes, too many fingers, missing arms, long neck, Humpbacked, deformed, disfigured, poorly drawn face, distorted face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, out of focus, long body, monochrome, symbol, text, logo, door frame, window frame, mirror frame, multiple girls, revealing clothes`

**Some things to note (Gacha Lolis):**
- I have added some anti NSFW in my prompts, like "sfw" in the prefix or "revealing clothes" in the negative prompt. This is to prevent from being censored for "CSAM". Not that I know if it works.

**Image gen done.**

***

Let me know if you find anything broken with my scripted cards.
