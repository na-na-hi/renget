##PROMPTS AND SETUP
***
Most of my cards contain <rules> tags, for formatting and instructions to the AI.
Add to your JB/prefill: `Follow the <rules> closely.` or something like that.

Some of them use CoT. To remove those thoughts, add a regex script to SillyTavern. Download this: [Regex script](https://creamsan.neocities.org/files/presets/removecot.json). Once downloaded, go to Extensions > Regex. Click on Import Script, then select **removecot.json**.

##SCRIPTED CARDS INITIAL SETUP - QUICK REPLIES AND REGEX SCRIPTS
!!! note Updated on **Mar-16-24**
	Fixes and updates on Quick QR importer.
	Note that you will still need to update the Quick Import preset itself by manually importing it. It is not included to be automatically updated.
	If you don't want the UI stuff, just add the regex script. Then go here: [Console copy paste](https://rentry.org/creamsan#console-copy-paste).
	Huge thanks to stscript anon for providing the code. https://rentry.org/stscript#making-stscript-cards-easy-to-set-up. **Requires JS setup first.**
***

### QR preset and regex script:

1. Download the **Quick import** above.

2. In SillyTavern, go to Extensions > Quick Reply. Enable Quick Replies, then import **qr-quick-import.json**. Click on the Global Quick Reply Sets plus icon and select **qr-quick-import**. Do the same if you want to update this preset.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/9l75tz.png)

3. For the regex script, download the **Regex script** above.

4. Go to Extensions > Regex. Click Import Script, then select **regexreplace.json**.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/0zojv8.jpg)

### Browser extension:

Check out the link as it explains why we do this: https://rentry.org/stscript#html5-minigames-and-hacking-stscript
Thanks again to stscript anon for sharing how to enable JS with STScript.

1. First, install a user script browser extension. I use ViolentMonkey. Other similar extensions should work too. Just search the Firefox Addons page or Chrome Web Store. These are all the ones I know:
- Violentmonkey
- Tampermonkey
- Greasemonkey

2. Open the extension settings. Look for a plus sign or something that allows you to add a new script.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/i0ed83.png)

3. Change the name, match, and the script:
- **@name:** Whatever you like
- **@match:** The url when you use ST, mine for example is: http://127.0.0.1:8000/*
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/uxk884.png)
- **User script:**
```
const sanitize = DOMPurify.sanitize;
DOMPurify.sanitize = str => str.startsWith("#STSCRIPT") ? str.replace("#STSCRIPT", "") : sanitize(str);
```
- What it should look like:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/8wb6gz.png)

4. For added security, replace `#STSCRIPT` with anything you like. This will act as a sort of password.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/xmud9i.png)
Even better, something like this:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/vo1b3q.png)

5. Save and close. Reload ST if open.

### Quick Import:

Notice that there's a new button **Update Presets** in the message box. You can click it and start updating.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/b0uo7e.png)

You should see the following popups:
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/4kcsmq.png)
.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/fztp2i.png)
.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/8ekwt2.png)

**The ok button will eventually appear when done, followed by the message below. Reload ST after.**
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/y35czc.png)

After reloading and if all goes well. You should see the updated/new presets.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/fqo3uj.png)

Don't forget to add **creamsan** to the Global Quick Reply Sets.
To hide the **Update Presets** button, simply uncheck the **Buttons** checkbox. You can check this again later to update QRs.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/sz50ay.png)

### Adding/Removing presets:

Eventually, you may want to add a new QR preset collection from someone or yourself, or remove a collection from the selection. You can do this by editing the Quick Import preset.
Go to Quick Replies > Edit Quick Replies and select **qr-quick-import**. Once selected, click the three dots next to Update Presets to edit. You'll see the links at the beginning of the script. When adding a new collection, just add a **"URL"**. Don't forget the comma if it's not the last entry.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/1qjvmd.png)
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/g3sp8k.png)

Collection json should look like this.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/8m3x46.png)

### Console copy paste:

If you just want a very quick QR import without the hassle above, go to the ST tab, open console by pressing F12. Then paste and enter the code below. You can modify the QR json urls by removing/adding links. Reload ST afterwards. After reloading, make sure that creamsan is still in the Global Quick Reply sets.

###Cards:

You'll know it's working when you get an **Initializing** message when you select one of my scripted cards.
You may notice a new Send button in the input field. Use the **QR Send button (green) for scripted inputs**, and use the **normal Send button (yellow) for normal inputs**. For example, with Ms. Keyes' card, use the QR Send button when you want to automatically append your time and grade, and use the normal Send button when the test is over and you want to interact normally.
I would recommend using QR Send all the time though.

##JAVASCRIPT
Some of my cards use JS. You only need to do this once per card.
Be sure to complete the [browser extension](https://rentry.org/creamsan#browser-extension) part above.
***

1. Go to the card description. Look for the `{{setvar::pass::PASSHERE}}` macro.
![1](https://files.catbox.moe/2hhwlw.png)

2. Replace `PASSHERE` with the same password you've set in the browser extension.

**JS done.**

My cards have checkers to make sure your user script is working.

**Some things to note:**
- For cards with CSS styling within the chat, you should turn this user script off, or you'll miss out on the fancy stuff.
Here's an example of a card with css:

Pic below shows the <style> tag sanitized with the script on.

To turn it off, just press the toggle switch and reload.

Please let me know how to fix this.

##IMAGE GEN
This is for my cards that have image gen.
I'm not that knowledgeable when it comes to image genning though, let me know what's the best settings for this.
***

Go to Extensions > Image Generation. Follow my settings (especially the marked ones), pic related below.

![1](https://files.catbox.moe/b66okj.jpg)

Negative prompt:
`worst quality, low quality, EasyNegative, bad anatomy, bad hands, cropped, missing fingers, missing toes, too many toes, too many fingers, missing arms, long neck, Humpbacked, deformed, disfigured, poorly drawn face, distorted face, mutation, mutated, extra limb, ugly, poorly drawn hands, missing limb, floating limbs, disconnected limbs, malformed hands, out of focus, long body, monochrome, symbol, text, logo, door frame, window frame, mirror frame, multiple girls, revealing clothes`

**Image gen done.**

**Some things to note (Gacha Lolis):**
- I have added some anti NSFW in my prompts, like "sfw" in the prefix or "revealing clothes" in the negative prompt. This is to prevent from being censored for "CSAM". Not that I know if it works.

Let me know if you find anything broken with my scripted cards.
