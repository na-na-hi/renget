##Heroes

>The Rooster
!!! info “A nice chap if half of what he promises is truth. Like, can he protect everyone? Even when vicious villains attack? Dunno, only time can tell about it.”
!!! note Sighing, the young man sets aside a picture of the hero, the one who “will bring peace” to Brockton Bay. How ludicrous is it, to think one can bring peace to that place just by being a hero?
!!! info “Aaah, this hard. Why can’t things go simple? He will destroy more things than save if he fights a villain…”

>Nemian:
!!! info “Hot, really hot. I can put my head between her legs and let ‘em strangle me. A tad old sure, but hot. Sad she makes machine for war and not love… I pretty sure if I try hard enough at the right  spot I can ge ta glimpse of her as—”
!!! note She is hot but he has no misconception about it, a CEO is something far beyond of what he can achieve in a lifetime, or two, or three… several lifetimes. Although he hardly says he values her as anything but hot, being against her mechas hovering above people’s heads.
!!! warning “But her ass…”

>Triumph
!!! info “What they are putting in America’s food? I have to bring it back home! I have never seem a girl so thick! Please, Miss! Smash my craniu— Not with your fists! I mean with your thigh— I’m no pervert, just an enthusiast of women! And sometimes men too!”
!!! note Hot hot hot hot hot very hot hot hot hot red hot chili peppers. Dodge, dodge. Is she trying to kill the young man? At least her spirit is as strong as her body!
!!! info “You are quite good, but you know if you continue to hold back like that someone will gonna take profit of it and end you, right? How do I know? I hold back too! Hey, something is blocking my view over here. How they can be so big?”

>Undertow:
!!! info “This is bad. Is like a kaiju coming out of the waters… Can’t say I like her. She is too dangerous, I remember saying that shark octopus thing too far away from the bay before putting it down.”
!!! note People don’t choose their powers, or they do, he doesn’t know, but he knows some people are very dangerous by existing. How can someone find her thrilling, and God forbid, “hot” is beyond his understanding.
!!! info “People are strange…” A pitiful woman in a pitiful world in a giant pound.

>The Undertaker:
!!! info “Gracious Buddha, what is what I’m saying? Is there an onmyoji around? An exorcist? Oh no, it looked at me! Keep your distance, fiend! or I will make sure to send you to a hell you won’t be able to return!”
!!! note The young man turns away from the monster and flees the supernatural sign. Not only are people gaining powers, but the dead are returning too.
!!! info “This is straight out of a nightmare!”

>Blastrix
!!! info “Bellatrix and I have quite a history. Every time we meet up it becomes a mess. She tries to capture me, I try to run away and beat up some asshole with powers, and we entangled in a three-way problem. Does she have a radar to annoy me in the most prejudicial of times? Really?”
!!! note She knows how to not cause damage or too much havoc, but she has a habit of annoying him in the worst times when he can’t afford to play games or run a game of mouse and cat.
!!! info “What a problem.”

##Villains:

>Hurt steal:
!!! info “That man cannot be called a doc. He is trash of the highest kind and a proof justice doesn’t work. People like him should be executed the moment they are captured. If they cannot die, then give them cement shoes and throw ‘em in the ocean.”
!!! note Putting aside another note, he sighs. Good thing he was captured, no need to worry about this monster roaming the streets for a while.

>Maw:
!!! info “Have only seen its “workings” before police got to them. Nasty stuff. Don’t think I can take that one down even if I find it, some other superhumans were already turned into mush by it. Maybe I should try to find friends to help me…”
!!! note There is only so much he can do by himself, and this is beyond his capacities. Someone who kills and eats people, even the ones with superpowers. How dangerous is it? There is no way to know.

>Freya:
!!! warning “You should choose your work well. This cannot end well. If you find yourself with problems with other superhumans, just give me a call… I will answer if I’m home. What I’m speaking about? C’mon. I am an airhead but not blind, you can say I have Hindsight.”
!!! note She is a good student and a good person, one of the few who doesn’t ignore him and even tries to socialize, despite his social status being the lowest possible. This work is a dangerous one, one she shouldn’t be engaging him.
!!! note If it comes back to bite her hand, then he will do what he can to help.

##Vigilantes

>Alex Lidel:
!!! info “A crazy student. I’m not one to say it given my homeland but even we don’t abuse that type of chemicals, we go natural. That guy will drop dead before he hits mid-twenties, mark my words.”
!!! note Another crazy American, nothing new. Abusing drugs? No problem, he will clean it after calling the cops. That guy still looks at him like one looks at a fat and big turkey.

>Athena:
!!! info “I like thicker women but this is too much. I bet she uses steroids twenty-four-seven. She must be sweating raw testosterone right now. I have seen bodybuilders more feminine than her. This is not something normal.”
!!! note Steroids aside, she is also a problem in potential.
!!! info “I have a feeling she is the type to go out of control. How do you take down a triceratops of a woman being a normal human? I will invent a way if the push comes to shove.”

>Shinobi:
!!! info “Hm, a familair face. Although our methods are… far too different, we have run on each sometimes. I think she doesn’t like me, the last time we met I was beating someone blue and purple. I think it gave her a shock…”
!!! note This was of a bad taste, too much of a bad taste. His stomach feels sick, no matter how unintentional it was.
!!! info “Guess I should police myself more, don’t want to go out of control like the ones I fight…”

>Roachbait:
!!! info “An oddball, but not a bad one thus far. He can go wrong, but he didn’t yet, thus doing oddities here and there. If he ever goes bad, then I will take him down.”
!!! note A villain alone is bad enough, a villain group is a nightmare, better to nip them in the bud when there is time left. He knows there are differences between being a villain and being a “villain”. While they stay in the latter, they won’t be a problem to be dealt with.

>Kirigiri:
!!! danger A Buffon, he is someone who is biting more than he will ever chew. His death on this path is assured but he still has hope of fighting this fate, of crawling above the gutter after running away.
!!! danger Why does his life have to be so hard? Why does he always find himself in other’s problems? Why can’t he simply turn his back on others like many people do in his homeland and here?
!!! danger But he already made his choice. To fight this fate is everything he can afford while alive. There will be enough time for regrets in death.
