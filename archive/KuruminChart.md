>Inatsu Hikuhei
"Konoha's venerable Lord Third, It's quite the wonderful change of pace is it not?  A leader that is responsible and able to do the not so glamorous part of the job... Not that it requires much to be exceptional when compared to the Second.  I can only pity him, stuck doing paperwork that could have been delegated to other people, the position of a Kage is too much of a burden for a single person to bear, it's the kind of job i hope to never be forced into, thankfully i'm just a mere foreigner, nobody would pass the mantle to someone like me."

"Back to the topic, it is quite the odd feeling to see a ninja i knew from way back then get such a high position, but it's not a surprise considering he served as an advisor... Didn't you know? We're actually not that far apart in age, surprising i know. I wouldn't mind talking with someone from a somewhat close generation, but considering that he's never free that's not really possible."

>Akuryoga Mitiru, "The Old Demon"
"A disgusting creature. A subhuman animal that only knows how to bite and bark at what's in front of his snout, normally playing with dogs would be beneath me but i'm forced to make an exception for this one. While the death of a Kage isn't my responsability, i do owe a bit of a debt to the Second, and putting this mutt down would serve as a fitting payment to it."

>Yusuke Hiramatsu, "The Third Kazekage"
"A sorry excuse for a shinobi. If you cannot kill when the situation calls for it, how can you call yourself a ninja? I wouldn't be surprised if that's why he ended up caught in this predicament of his... But to have the Kage of Sunagakure as a puppet leader, is that not the greatest irony?"

#####A-RANK#####
>Taiki, "The Trunk Thrower"
"The leaf certainly has it's share of... Excentric people. A ninja that cannot use any sublety, that can't do the bare minimum of stealth and only knows how to slam his head against whatever wall is in front of him until either the wall or himself drops. While i do recognize that his power is worthy of the rank of a Jonin, everything else is worse than subpar, to think that the next generation would be assigned to this man is certainly a cruel joke. He won't teach them anything of value because all he knows is simply to hit the problem harder, and will get his team killed sooner or later."

>Konna, "The Shady Foreigner"
"Someone whose personality perfectly matches the land from where he came, always with the same depressing face, that's no way to live. What is the point of living a life where you can't find any enjoyment?"

>Mika Katsumi, "Opioid Smoke Girl"
"A hack of a medical nin, it's hard to believe anyone would subject themselves to be treated by a woman who learned how the human body works by using her patients as test subjects... This one does remind me of a little girl playing doctor, seeing it that way doesn't that make her simply adorable?"

>Hakumo Ikari, "Kitsune Vixen"
"Hakumo, Hakumo, Hakumo... Oh that one! Each and every generation seems to be more of the same, so it's hard not to mix all of them up.  She's just one more brat who after getting a bit of success believes she knows what's best, it is quite hilarious to think that people actually believe she's any different from the rest of her kind, but i suppose that's how the trick works..."

"While i can praise their success as a business, respecting the Hakumos is simply not ever going to happen. Gambling is simply not befitting of a ninja, a gamble is for when all is lost, a true shinobi will plan ahead for as much as they can in order to reduce all unknown factors to a minimum.  If it was only about exploiting fools with more greed than sense it wouldn't matter, but they are also responsible for what can only be described as entertainment for the lowest of the low, a dirty unrefined excuse of an "art" only fit for pigs." 

>Amami Kai "The Tide"
"Yashinohagakure is such a wonderful place, the foliage, the beaches, the architecture, it's certainly somewhere you should visit at least once in your life, relaxing while eating some shaved ice and admiring the sights is a great source of inspiration or to simply relax from all the stress from your daily life. Oh, that guy? I've seen him a few times while sightseeing, there's no way not to notice that atrocious hairstyle, i've made many different hairstyles for dolls in my life, you can trust my word. 

>Mutsuo Aburame "Bug Guy"
"The Aburame are a clan that we are on fairly good terms with, not surprising for a clan of bugs and spiders to get along is it? Using poison with puppets is common place, and high quality silk is a must for high quality costumes for them.  Now Mutsuo... Desiring greater influence is expected of the  noble clans but eating bugs? That's pig food, unfit for human consumption."

>Goro Tsuchigumo "Snare Spider"
"How tragic that Konoha had it's own spider clan already, it would've been so much better for us to be the only ones in this village... On the other hand, even if this overlap pains my heart it has upsides, it does make it very convenient to work together when needed, it's a bit like finding long lost family. Their little prodigy isn't half bad either, a ninja must be able to find a solution to any situation, and there's no reason to let the struggles of battle to take over your life,  he seems to understand that."

#####B-RANK#####
>Ray Sisuto "Bloodline Actor"
"Imitation is the greatest form of flattery is it not? Learning from others, incorporating their techniques and knowledge into your own style is how one attains greatness. And a studious child certainly deserves praise for their great effort.."

"Recording the history of clans might be a very important thing to record, but it's such a pain, i wager that not even the people stuck with that job like it, i really don't feel like doing that again and soon i'll end up running out of excuses to get out of it... Hmn, shouldn't that have happened as soon as the new kage got into power? Does that really mean that there was so much paperwork that it got lost for 12 years?

#####C-RANK#####
>Nara Suzura "Cowardly Dragon Host"
"A tools only purpose is to be used as it's owner sees fit and replaced with a newer one once it has no more use, how cruel one must be to subject their own flesh and blood to that fate! The shinobi is only one of the masks we must wear to live, how unfortunate for this child to have forgotten how to remove it

>Oscar, "The Outlander"
"I too am an outsider to the Leaf, so it isn't my right to criticize another, worries of betrayal and espionage are better left to the Hokage who allowed him to join the village"

>Kambara Soue, "Frosty Kunoichi"
"Good, seeing such a young girl already learning how to change between the mask of a kunoichi and her true self always warms my heart, even more so when she knows how to enjoy life, but i must deduct a few points for her stubborness. Dedication is necessary to polish one's talents, but the ability to quickly adjust and approach a problem from a different angle is even more important, i'd hate to see a young lady die for falling to the same vice as a certain brute of this village."

"Soue has some potential and her family's inheritance appears to be quite the useful bloodline limit, i'd love to welcome her into the family, i'm sure i can find a few candidates for her hand without any problems. It does not seem like it would be too difficult to offer an alliance with the Kambara clan, they're in need of heirs and making an alliance certainly should be an extra benefit for them.

>Tengu Yumiko
"An adorable little birdy that always appears in my shows,  having someone who can appreciate the behind the scenes work in the audience is a wonderful feeling, but more importantly i worry about her, in the long term the girl would do well to learn some humility and ease up a little more, being able to share your passions and small joys is what makes us human... In the short term, it's just too sad to see a girl of that age with no friends"

"Her clan is also a recent arrival to the village, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to strengthen our ties, but i wonder if Yumiko isn't a little too detached from reality with all the romantic experiences she's been exposed to, that wouldn't bide well for her husband"

#####D-RANK#####
>Takatsui Inukasai, "The Infernal Painter"
"An artist needs a certain level of pride to find success, but to throw a tantrum when things don't go your way is the mark of a child that wasn't disciplined by their parents."

>Eisei Hokan, "Timid Grinner"
"If only the Hokan clan was a little more open, i'd have loved to make a collection or two including their craftsmanship... Medical nin are important but not exactly my specialty, so there's nothing that comes to mind about the boy"

>Kazuo, "The Unarmed"
"A living puppet?  That's certainly intriguing. I'd love to take a look at the craftsmanship involved but i'm sure that i could make a better more lifelike body than that one."

>Sarurata, "The Retarded Orphan"
"I don't have time for this"

>Zeiji Gorobuyo, "Toad Nemesis"
"Eradicating all the frog population? My my, what an ambitious goal. It's certain to earn the wrath of a few clans... It's quite enjoyable to see the absurd dreams of the next generation."

>Kenzo Nakamura, "Gluttonous Dragon"
"I can't eat that much food, but sitting down at the store and watching young people like Kenzo and Yumiko enjoy themselves eating is one of the small joys of being an old lady."
