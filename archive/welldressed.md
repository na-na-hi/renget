>Be Anon the Jade Hunter
>Be called like that since you steal jewels and you're green
>Pretty sure that's racist but hey it's growing on you
>Have two of your lackeys Rib and Rob picking on the safe as you lookout for the police
>"I told you the last number was 86!"
>"Nu uh! The cute teller told us it was 36!"
>"Well maybe he could've told us for clarification if you didn't threaten him to 'blow him to kingdom come' as a reward and he fainted!"
>"He thought it was a literal blowing!"
>You really should ditch these two after the job's done
>Two bullets wiz to your side and you duck in cover, shooting back at them blindly
"You two just pick a number and get the cash out of the safe now!"
>You duck out and start shooting back, quickly noticing more of the police in horses arriving
>"Ah gaddamit the safe reset! I knew it was 86!"
>"Told ya!"
>A vein was starting to pop on your forehead as you continued to listen to more of their bickering

>"We're sorry?"
>"Really sorry boss! We swear on our mama's hearts it won't happen again!"
>The two are currently lassoed tight with their perky asses up in the air
>You bear down on them like a predator about eat his first meal
"Sorry isn't enough."
>Your fingers dig into the two as they gasp and wriggle into the ground like fishes
>Their anus tightened around your knuckles as your fingers viciously assaulted their prostate
"You two could've just picked the two numbers out of the time we had before more of the police showed up."
>You pull back and thrust inside them as their cocks twitch
>Their faces tearing up in pleasure as their backs curled and attempted to move closer to your hands
"But instead you two bickered like a bunch of idjits and costed me the score of a lifetime!"
>"Ah~ Boss we're sorry! Hnggh!"
>I'll promise to be good boss!"
>You take note their cocks twitching and leaking pre due to your rough treatment
>Before they could feel their orgasm come, you pull out

>The two lied down on their sides as they silently pleaded you to finish them gasping
>You just walk away and pull out a set of clothes from your horse
"Here"
>You toss the clothes towards the mice on the right. Rob was it?
>He eyed the dress and then to you
>"W-What is it boss?"
"You're going to put that on for a special occasion."
>The two were able to untangle themselves and Rob pulled up the shirt revealing an intricate dress
>"Hey how can he gives you a gift?!"
>"B-Boss... I didn't think you'd be into this sort of stuff. But if it makes you happy I will-"
>You turn to him with a brow raised
"What? No. You'll be wearing that tomorrow as bait. We'll be robbing a carriage of a rich womanizing snob."
>You lay down in front of the campfire, putting your hat on your face for a good nights rest.
>But a hand pulls your hat and you see Rob looking at you with a nervous look.
>"Uh boss. If the job goes well. Will you, uh, do it while I'm wearing the dress?
>The mouse was obviously waiting for your answer and you sigh
"If it goes well."
>You pull down your hat to rest for tomorrow.
>Though you could still hear the sound of the mouse jumping for joy 
>The sounds of the disgruntled brother fill your ears as you drift off into sleep

>It was around noon when the job took place
>According to your contact, the rich man's carriage is gonna ride along this long stretch of road away from any town or city
>Perfect for a stick-up
>You and Rib hide in a thick bush while Rob was waiting alongside of the road under the hot sun
>His make-up consisted of tomato paste for lipstick and crush blueberries for eye liner
>Though you could tell he's sweatin' up a storm judging from the way he keeps fanning himself
>You hear hoofsteps in the distance
>There it was, a fancy schmancy freshly painted carriage carrying the fat man himself
>You watch as the carriage stops right in front of your subordinate 
>Signaling to Rib, you two carefully approach the back, eyeing the lockbox containing the loot 
>"Well now aren't you the brightest sunflower in these parts missy."
>Go time

>Rob was currently batting his eyes at the portly man in front of him
>"Aw shucks mister, I don't think I could call myself that~"
>"Nonsense! A lady like you, especially an exotic one is quite the looker!"
>He peaks behind his fan to see you picking the lock
>The carriage driver was obviously used to this situation and decided to look somewhere else
>"Well then, I guess you don't mind me talkin' here about my day then?"
>"Of course! Though I hope you'd be welcoming to share a seat in my carriage no?"
>Your eyes quickly darted towards Rob, signaling him to keep the man's eyes away from the cab
>The mouse pulled the man closer quickly
>"No no its fine! Just uh... How about we talk about what like then?"
>"Oh if in that case little lady."
>The man's hand mousies on over Rob's ass, giving it a pinch
>The mouse gasped as his rod twitched a bit under the dress
>"I like a woman with a bit of junk in the trunk~"
>"Y-Yeah junk in the trunk!"
>Speaking of trunk, you were able to open the lid off and spot the wads of cash
>Rib got close and opened your satchel as you steadily pulled in each bundle

>The man got closer to Rob's face and looked at him up and down
>"I don't mind taking you home actually. I promise a life of luxury if you were willing to come with me."
>"R-Really now?"
>"Of course you might going to have to share me with the other women in my lodging."
>Rob closed up his fan
>"...SHARE?!"
>The mouse dug his heel on the man's toe
>The rich sucker fell to the ground in pain as he held his foot 
>The driver was shocked and brought up his rifle aiming at the angry mouse
>"If you think I'm gonna share with some hussy, you better think twice mister!"
>"The only time I technically share is with my brother! And even then, we only share our Boss Anon because he doesn't pick favorites!"
>The man's head looked up in realization from the mouse said
>"Wait... You mean that outlaw Anon?!"
>He looked up to see You and Rib hauling away the goods 
>The driver tried to switch targets but already found his kneecap torn by a bullet
>He fell to the ground in pain as you slowly approached the wimpering fat man gun in hand
"Well now, this is quite the conundrum we have here Mister Flask."
>You take a look at Rob who was looking at you in admiration from your shooting and then at the wailing driver
"I best ask you straight to the point then. Money or your life. Which is it?"

>Today was a success in your opinion
>Five-thousand all minted Benjamins were safely tucked somewhere only you know
>But the day isn't over since you have a promise to keep
>Lying in front of you was a petite mouse, all dressed pretty for you to ravish
>You may be an outlaw, but you still keep to your word
>Crawling towards him like a cougar, you appreciated how the dress truly hugged his figure
>Seeing the stockings and eluded to a pair of legs any man would kill to touch
>Your hands glided over to them, earning a soft mewl from your partner tonight
>But you are getting impatient
>So with a swift pull, you tore off the front part of the skirt, leaving him only with his socks and panties

>His barely hidden penis was already leaking in anticipation
>You pull him closer to you with his legs as you slowly take off your pants
>The cold night was immediately apparent as you let your cock go free
>Your partner hitched as he eyed your log and spread his legs even further
>"B-Boss please~"
>Yeah yeah you were getting there
>You pulled the string panties to the side to expose his anus and positioned yourself for penetration
>Even without going inside you could feel his heat on your head
>You didn't even get to let your partner have a chance to brace before you went all the way to the base
>The mouse's body curled as he shot a quick load on his stomach and dress
>You hate to admit it but he was the tightest snatch you've felt so far
>Quickly pulling yourself back with your tip inside, albeit with difficulty, you went back in harder
>Your partner lolled his tongue with each thrust, alongside repeated orgasms thanks to you punching his prostate
>In a rare case of him taking action, he pulled you in and gave you a possessive kiss
>Not that you didn't mind, in fact it made you go faster 
>Your tongues danced in the air as you continued rib his entrance, every so often giving him another orgasm
>His hand reached for your own and intertwined as his legs locked to your waist
>You finally pulled out of your make out session, seeing him look at you with a lovestruck face with his "make-up" running down due to the sweat
>"Boss I-"
>"HMMMGHH!!!"
>You and Rib's lovemaking were put on hold as you two looked towards Rob who was tied against a tree
>Why the switcharoo you ask?
>Well name dropping you ended up having some consequences in the long run as authorities were now in search in the area of your prime hunting grounds
>That, and not sticking to the plan as always
>You see his face dripping with tears and snot as he watched you and his brother fuck like animals
>But the erection and stain on his pants prove another side you just learned

>Where were you? Oh right, the fucking like animals thing
>After like several times Rib painted his stomach and dress white, you were finally close to finishing
>You lied on the petite mouse's body, stuffing him into your shoulder as you continued to piston against his ass
>With a growl, you hilted against his plush ass and basted him like a Thanksgiving turkey
>Rib was spouting nonsense as he hugged your body like a squirrel while you continued to fill his guts with your semen
>At the same time, you heard Rob scream from his gag as he came again inside his loins
>All three of you lay still for a few minutes to catch a breather
>You were the first top get up and look at your handiwork
>Couldn't tell if Rib's face was gonna stay like that judging from the ways his eyes are rolling and his lolled out tongue
>The dress was practically unusable thanks to him and you, his semen was dripping all over the center and no anthro in the world will mistake him for a woman due to the smell
>You turned towards Rob who was catatonic and the only thing keeping him standing was his hands tied above his head
>His legs were twitching while his shorts were dripping with his cum
>In any case you dressed yourself and started counting all the cash you three collected
>"Yeah Rob you see this~?"
>You hear Rib in a drunken state taunt Rob still unresponsive 
>The smug mouse turned around and presented his creampied ass towards his brother 
>"This proves that I'm the better brother, and that I am Boss's favorite!"
>You knew this was gonna end badly but you still ignored it
>Suddenly, Rob came to life and snapped his restraints
>He seized his brothers ass and started devouring your cum, getting it deeper to scoop it all out like a possessed beast
>"AH! Stop! B-Boss! Guh! Please! Make him stop!"
>You continued to count your money as the cross dresser bemoaned at the fact his brother was stealing away your cum
>Such is life in the west
