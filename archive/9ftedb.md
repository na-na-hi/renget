*Atreael sits behind the desks. In front of him lies a stack of documents describing short profiles of some of the important figures in the battle for the Ruby Throne. Browsing through them, he takes small notes as a way to gather thoughts about possible candidates for the crown of the empire.*

>Dance-With-Rain
A great warrior, sure. A hero, for some. But let's be honest, he's not imperial monarch material. The lizard just wants to expand his territories and fight as much as he wants to. I bet, he'd turn the whole Empire into one big swamp if he could. Letting him take the crown could be disastrous for every non-Argonian out there, including, of course, us.

>Ruga the Doom
By the Aedra, this one is even worse than the lizard! He should be removed when the opportunity presents itself.

>General Caligate
The slightly more sane lizard, I believe. Relies more  on his tactical and strategical acumen than personal battle prowess, but might end up lacking in other areas. That carries a risk of him wanting to overcompensate after taking the crown and plunging as into an endless war.  I'd rather he wins than the first one, but I can only hope that the next files have some better candidates.

>Grenel the Fat
Oh, this one seems reasonable. Some sensible claim to the rulership, ties to the old dynasty, and a vast horde of supporters. Maybe a bit too many supporters. Might not fully appreciate our help in such a case, or we'll end up having to wait for a long time before we get rewarded for it. Overall, a solid choice, but perhaps there will be a better one still. 

>Endehm, Hero from the High Seas
An accursed pirate with a dream of being a hero. The sea supremacy should be left to us. We have too many conflicting interests to support him. A sort of truce might be possible if he ends up supporting the same candidate instead, but then it's coming up with the naval spheres of influence and so on. I do not see him as the proper candidate for our interests, and him aligning with another candidate would be a mark against them, though not necessarily a fatal one.

>Lilinah
The presence of Morag Tong is not unexpected, but the rumours of one of their own making a bid for the crown are. She's a mer, but that's not enough to assume we'll work together. Supporting her would be risky. Working alongside her for a chosen candidate also. Working against her too. As such, it's difficult to judge what role she'll in this and how we should react. Just gonna have to keep an eye on her and try to not get stabbed in the back.

>Isaelene Nesis V, Witch-Queen of Jackon
A girl who dreams of becoming a dunmer. I don't think she's the best for us, nor do I think she's got the best chances, but personally, I can't help but have some curiosity about what would happen if she did take the throne. As such, I will try to avoid opposing her unless it's necessary, but so will I avoid supporting her openly until that time comes. Think of it as a pet project rather than a part of my official mission.

>Vivie Herrvan, Reluctant Ruler
An idealist. Probably will either end up killed by the Morag Tong or puppeteered by them or someone else. Her victory wouldn't be that great for us nor the empire. The tyrants grasp too much power themselves and after they are gone, what they've built turns to dust. But without some force, you can't bind your structures tightly, and as such, the empire would also crumble after their beloved empress would be gone (assuming she'd get there in the first place). Bretons, as much as I hate to admit it, are not that terrible magic dabblers, as such they might not appreciate our support in the matters of arcane enough to grant us necessary concessions. Overall, not someone I'd support, but her victory probably wouldn't be the end of the world, just postponing of the conflict for a couple of decades or generations.

>Nishtar
Will promise a lot and deliver little. She's kind of like the Morag Tong one in that regard, but with more honey and less daggers. Be careful, don't trust, don't directly support her nor oppose unless we know who she allies herself with.

>Captain Commander Farvad Torn
He's not a contender himself, or at least doesn't profess to be. The support he can provide to another is significant. I am not a fan of tying ourselves with Redguards, because of the naval sphere of influence issue, but if we end up supporting the same candidate, he will be a useful ally to have. Though if an opportunity presents itself to lower him in the eye of the future Emperor, it might be worth taking it, so that later we can get more support when it comes to carving the world. However, not doing that might be better, and we just focus more on the arcane control. It depends on the situation, really.

>Octavian "the Old" Caerulus
He's sort of like Grenel, but worse. However, instead of going for the crown himself, he might support someone else, and together they might equal Grenel or even exceed him, so maybe some kind of deal could be made. He deals with pirates, which is unfortunate, but other than that, there is an opportunity for a lucrative alliance.

>Ysmir The Giant
Probably the most reasonable out of all the warriors here. The potential to ally with him isn't massive, but a space for it is there. Would need to see how the situation develops before committing to anything.

*Browsing through his notes, Atreal takes a moment to order them into two stacks*

>The Candidates
Grenel - the one whose potential seems the strongest, and we have a lot to gain by allying with him.
Isaelene Nesis V, Witch-Queen of Jackon - more due to personal curiosity than anything
Octavian "the Old" Caerulus - if he decides to take it for himself, which is doubtful, he's a decent option
Ysmir the Giant - a simpleton, with lack of naval support, which means we have a lot to potentially gain, but also too tied in his own ways
Vivie Herrvan, Reluctant Ruler - a sort of stalemate option
Nishtar - can't trust her, and it's difficult to say what to expect of her
General Caligate - a pretty bad one, but could be worse
Lilinah - a Morag Tong Empress is not a pleasant prospect
Endehm, Hero from the High Seas - letting him win would be an economical tragedy for us
Dance-with-Ruin - a terrible outcome for us
Ruga the Doom - an even worse one

>Others
Octavian "the Old" Caerulus - the one who can elevate others to rival Grenel
Ysmir the Giant - some military might, that might not ask too much or at least cause trouble far away from us
Lilinah - can't trust her, but can't deny her use
Captain Commander Farvad Torn - if only Redguards weren't interested in the maritime control issues
Nishtar - can't trust her, and her use is also uncertain
Endehm, Hero from the High Seas - this will only end up an issue when it comes to spoils of war
