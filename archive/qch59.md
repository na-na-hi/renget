>It's mid summer, and youre finally putting yourself out there a bit trying to get a gf before the fall semester at uni starts

>go on nice movie date. lucky for you she has the same taste in movies so its actually pretty nice
>grab milkshakes after, she's home by 7:50, but she lets you stay awhile into the night so it's fine

>fast forward to mid december
>you and cutie have been together for about 6 months now, she's really sweet and you think this could be a long term thing
>uni has had both of you cooped up so you decide to go on a hike for a date this month
>you're both up by 8 and on the trail by 9. her early sunset-based curfew has shifted your sleep schedule and made you a morning person

>she takes you to one of her favorite trails. it's a longer one but she says the hike is worth it
>you two trek though increasingly dense forest, sometimes having to hack through underbrush, for the better part of 2 hours, but it finally gives way to a clearing encircling a river flowing over a small cliff, feeding into a pool of clear water before continuing down stream more or less the way you came

>you have a picnic with the lunch she packed, it's too cold to swim right now but you skip rocks across the pool to see who can go the farthest, you have deep conversations about the philosophical and hypothetical, its an absolutely great time. the best date you've ever been on
>So great, in fact, that you both lose track of time
>"wait, anon, what time is it?"
>"about 4:30"
>"shit! we gotta go, anon, like now"
>before you can protest, she's already stuffed the picnic stuff in her pack and is running back down the trail
>sunset approaches, you try to tell her shes already going to be late home, just accept it and slow down
>she seems to ignore you and keeps running

>"anon, what time is it?"
>you struggle to check your watch while trying to keep up
>"5:00"
>as the forest gets dimmer, you swear you can see her changing
>is she getting taller? she's starting to run a little weird
>wait, what's that in her pants? is that fur poking out from her waistline? has she somehow hid a tail plug from you all day or something?

>"Fucking dammit!" she shouts as she comes to a stop
>"what's even... the big deal anyway?" you pant, almost running into her
>she starts furiously stripping in front of you, cursing the entire time. It's pretty dark now, especially under the trees, but you can swear you see more fur all over her body. And what is up with her face?
>exhausted and somewhat panicked, you fumble to find your phone. as you turn the flashlight on you hear clothes ripping. you shine it up at her
>your cutie gf is no longer in front of you, instead replaced by a 6ft tall werewolf wearing boxers and a sports bra, both half ripped
>she has arms and thighs twice as strong, tits a cup size bigger, and all the fluff you could hope for in a puppy
>and she's pissed
>"anon, you KNOW I have to be home before dark! We've been together SIX MONTHS now, you KNOW this! I just got this underwear too! how are you gonna get me home now? I have to sleep like this, you know. I don't change back until sunrise!"

>she continues to shout at you but you aren't even listening anymore. She can't see your face behind your phone's flashlight so she doesn't notice and keeps ranting
>you don't hear it anymore, though. You're too awestruck by what stands before you
>because at this moment, you know
>this is it
>she's the one
