# 6 Stars 
All 6 Star units get increased base stats and a UB+ that enhances that skill. Some 6 Stars get better UB+ upgrades than others. 
Ratings will be given for Bond story, Max level and low level priority rating. This goes from: **Top > High > Med > Low > Luxury**

Top - Rules the meta in relevant category.
High - Great choice if you're running low on top priority picks
Med - Can wait if you're trying to manage resources, but good
Low - Not super important, but nice to have
Luxury - Collection purposes only if you have extra resources to fluff about with

PvE is defined as a general category for anything that isn't Arena or CB such as Event SP, Dungeons, Luna Tower, Special Dungeon, etc... 

Last Updated: May 10th (Kokkoro to Ayane have been updated with the latest JP thoughts. If you have a different opinion, reply to the OP in the thread and discuss why.)

[TOC2]

## -> Kyaru <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Does not see any usage, a stat stick for her other versions. 
- UB+: Gives her double damage and a fear debuff that prevents units from using their UB.
- CB:  Do not use in CB, as she is extremely powercrept by the plethora of mutli-target mages actually designed for CB.
- Arena: Can be a very poor man's mage in Arena for Luna cannon comps, but is extremely outclassed. Do not use outside of having a pure love for the character.
- PvE: Not going to be used in any sort of content 
- Unless you've unlocked all other 6 Stars or have some sort of undying love for Kyaru, her only worth is in bond stories. Not advised for new players, as there are better units to unlock.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for O.Kyaru, Pyaru)
Max level Unit priority: Luxury
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not help clear EX3+ faster)

## -> Kokkoro <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Can be a decent stop-gap for tanking and healing if you're missing some, but definitely an outclassed support.
- UB+: gives her a big party heal, increased buff values and gives units +10 TP boost for 18s per UB and stacks.
- CB: Outfclassed by her own Princess version, which is currently outclassed by other units. A victim of power creep.
- PvP: No CC as a support and no reason to use, her skills are not very good in PvP.
- PvE: Nice heal if you don't have decent options for healing and TP buffs, but just overall outdated.
- You can find limited, cope use for her since she has TP Boost, but will always be a sub-optimal choice. There are simply too many supports that are just better. Bond story tier, like Kyaru.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for C.Kokkoro, NY.Kokkoro)
Max level Unit priority: Luxury
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher,  unless you have no healers)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Pecorine <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Still has a niche in Arena offense, but no longer relevant in a meta sense. 
- UB+: Gives her a P.Atk buff that increases based on HP and increases the values of current defensive buffs gained from it
- CB: Skillset is not appropriate for CB, do not attempt to use. 6 Star does not change this.
- PvP: Has some niche usage against those Summer Hatsune comps where they try to burst squishy targets, but isn't pivotal to those.
- PvE: Tanks generally need some sort of reason to be used, but Peco has none over options like Nozomi.
- Peco has no taunt or utility for her team, which many other tanks do. She has a lot of nodes early on, but you can blow through story with borrows and get other key 6 Star units to farm.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for P.Peco)
Max level Unit priority: Luxury
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Rino <- (JP release date: Year 2, September 30th)
Extremely niche and outclassed, not worth grabbing over other B.Arena units.
- UB+ gives an increase in damage and a x3.5 modifier for crits.
- CB: No chance as she's heavily reliant on crits and offers nothing outside of damage. Does not circumvent the damage cap.
- PvP: Very niche usage against full squishy teams without Ames, or other barriers. Thee issue is that the meta does not lend itself to that on defense or offense. P.Aren would be your best bet if you're a huge Rino fan with a diehard desire to make her work.
- PvE: Most PvE units are HP sponges, which Rino cannot deal with. Could deal a bit of damage in panic comps to clean up mutli-target dungeon bosses, but there are better options by far. 
- A running theme for the first few batches of 6 Star units - There are just better options, especially with Monika/Tamaki/Hiyori sharing the same store. Can still shred squishy teams, but so can many other units.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Rino has no good versions to note for this)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Rima <- (JP release date: Year 2, October 31st)
Even after all these years, Rima is still here and plays a part in Arena.
- UB+ gives increased damage, increased p.def buff and a physical barrier. 
- CB: Not worth looking at anymore, there are simply better tanks that offer actual utility like Action speed or TP restoration. Rima doesn't.
- PvP: Not as omnipresent because NY.Muimi is in side stories, but their roles are still critical in eating up a MS.Kasumi snare. Rima's barrier still continues to help block physical damage, but her role in defense is long gone. Every slot is precious in PvP, so you need a very good reason to leave your Pos 2 unit exposed to an S.Misogi/Inori/Mifuyu stun. In addition, her running in late does also manipulate positions for opponents due to her needing a spot to run to and changing up where units stop in relation to the enemy team. Certainly one to grab, or grab NY.Muimi.
- PvE: Not worth anything, unless MS.Kasumi pops up in some strange EX stage
- Rima will always be relevant to PvP, she's just tailor made for it. Everywhere else, she is nothing more than a joke.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Rima has no bonds worth speaking about)
Max level Unit priority: Med
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)

## -> Io <- (JP release date: Year 2, November 30th)
Io 6* is another Arena unit that is required to fight for top spots in a comfy manner. Still used defenses & offense, though in fewer comps. 
- UB+ hits opponents with TP Boost reduction, increased damage, 1s increase on charm and drains TP from damaged units. If her skill does 0 damage because of shields, the charm and TP reduction do not take effect. Charm lasts 5s.
- CB: TP steal is nice, but zero reason to use her when other TP steal units like Noir Io do it better.
- PvP: Still a great PvP unit, just in choice defense and offenses. As metas have changed, Io has remained a stable part of most for her charm and TP steal.
- PvE: Can be used to watch units murder each other, but requires a lot of investment into having Io UB as often as possible. This can help lower level players clear individual Luna Tower floors, VH fights or main story nodes they may have been struggling with, but it's incredibly gimmicky. Other than this small niche, nothing of note.
- Arena enthusiasts should aim for Io, as she's a good part of a healthy box for offense solutions. Everyone else, just avoid her unless you enjoy running funny comps like the one mentioned above.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for Noir Io)
Max level Unit priority: High
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Yukari <- (JP release date: Year 2, December 31st)
Yukari is still going to show up and there's nothing we can do about it. Her TP charge is too valuable to fall out of meta in at least Arena.
- UB+ now heals, provides a m.def buff and increased shielding. 
- CB: Not very good use, but could be made to help in sub-optimal comps. Or you can just hit T3 instead.
- PvP: Yukari + good Arena unit (Ex. Anna, Ames) on offense/defense will never not be a good combo, as she can instantly fill a TP bar with a S2. Usually charges pos 4 unit, but this is dependent on positioning and gets weird because positions are strange in this game sometimes, especially with NY.Muimi or Rima involved.
- PvE: Similar to Ames in some ways, but a specialist against magic damage. She and Ames make for a good duo to protect your units, provided you can run 3 DPS. Very useful in comps for dungeons or Luna Tower, where you need a quick TP charge and a tanky position 1 unit to do it.
- Easy to farm up since she's a Dungeon shop unit and always relevant, she's a top priority to assist in clearing content for new players. If you're not a new player, you most likely have her. If not, then go get her.

Bond story priority: High (Relevant for X.Yukari, herself)
Max level Unit priority: Top (Why wouldn't you have her?)
New player Unit priority: Top (Can help clear EX3/4 if missing units that provide TP)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Maho <- (JP release date: Year 3, January  31st)
Still used in CB, still causing level autism, good Arena unit and worst of all - Extends timelines to incredibly high times because of how often units will UB. Another unit that has never left the meta and continues to see usage in all game modes still. There is no reason to not get this unit ASAP.
- UB+: Gives increased M.Atk and P.Def. The big upgrade is that her UB also gives a flat 120 TP to all units and restores 10 TP per second, for 10 seconds. Both the 120 TP & 10 TP per second are increased by the receiving unit's TP boost stat. 
- CB: Consistently seen in comps and mostly for her UB's huge TP restoration, but is the worst offender of level autism. Just go and look at any Wyvern Rider month and you'll see, but because increased defensive stats still affect TP Gain, she will always have some form of autism in timelines. We have a ton of TP boost, so her UBs will be granting a large amount.
- PvP: Niche PvP usage, but still does help with a blind and UBs in tanky comps to help lighten blows from hard hitting physical attacks. 
- PvE: Excellent for the reasons above, but just applied to all other modes. 
- Candidate for 1st 6 Star choice, she's just always going to be relevant. Her in combination with TP Boosters like Neneka are examples of why we now have a TP Boost stat cap. Even through that, Maho is a top tier pick in most parts of the game.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for C.Maho)
Max level Unit priority: Top (Why wouldn't you have her?)
New player Unit priority: Top (Necessary for early EX3/4)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Yui <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Mostly not used, but easy to farm with so many nodes.
- UB:+ Gives increased heal, physical barrier, p.def buff and an added buff to action speed.
- CB: Not relevant anymore, Ames is a better support in every imaginable way aside from action speed, which we can get from units like Karin or Monika.
- PvP: Outside of very cheesy full tank comps with shields and healing, Yui doesn't see much use in PvP due not having any CC.
- PvE: Can help clear against physical damage where folks may have struggled - But at that point, you can just Ames and a better unit. Seen sometimes in SP dungeon, but the first two boss floors and be cleared by many things and is not an indication that Yui is really strong.
- Past her prime, but has enough nodes to easily farm up when done with other units. Supports these days are just filled to the brim with utility and Yui does not compare. Obtain out of pure love, or do not touch until much later.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for S.Yui)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can assist for early EX3/4 comps, but not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Hiyori <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Hiyori has been relegated to niche Arena solutions, but at least it's something.
- UB+ increases her damage by double for the main target and triples it for the units who are hit by the multi-target portion, with an extra bit of range on the multi-target parts
- CB: Not relevant, just make sure you don't mistake her portrait for Piyori.
- PvP: Can see some usage in comps where there are many squishies and she can reach them with her UB. Not an Arena staple by any means, but a real niche is better than nothing.
- PvE: See CB, just don't. 
- There are better borrows for new players like Chris or Akino, so that's not something for her at this point. If you like having a flexible PvP box, grab her after key B.Arena targets like Monika, Tamaki. Helps Piyori's P.Atk though.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant for Piyori, maybe S.Hiyori)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help in a pinch for EX3/4 comps, certainly not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Rei <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Rei is just okay, but no longer has a spot.
- UB+: Gives a massive increase in damage, alongside a unique buff that doubles the values of her skills. 
- CB: No usage, aside from maybe some T3 comps. But almost anything can do T3.
- PvP: Not built for PvP, she's too busy getting stuck in counter-slash. Many better options.
- PvE: Can help in some dungeon comps early on due to her UB+, but those are resources you could be using for another, better 6 star.
- The biggest thing Rei 6 Star contributes is having her bond stories apply to P.Rei and maybe S.Rei when her UE rolls around. She's now retired and won't be seen, unless something crazy happens.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for P.Rei, possibly S.Rei)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help in a pinch for EX3/4 comps, certainly not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Hatsune <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, March 31st)
Do well in P.Arena to farm Anna instead, because Hatsune is on the bench.
- UB+: Gives an increased amount of damage damage vs physical targets, a m.def debuff and a 6s stun against anything physical.
- CB: No niche anymore, as we have many better options in magic damage multi-target damagers. Was mostly only used in loops anyway.
- PvP: Still sees some usage, but Misaki/Anna are mostly used in the magic space for PvP. Can still smash physical teams without proper magic barrier protection thanks to her stun, but that's usually just the enemy having a poor defense.
- PvE: Requires too much support for little return, so just avoid her for this purpose.
- The meta has naturally gained lots of ways to deal with Hatsune. From CC to shields like S.Chika, magic units need a bit more punch if they're going to break maxed out units running around with barriers.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for S.Hatsune)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help clear lower level physical 6* quests)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Tamaki <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, April 30th)
Tamaki's still kicking, just in a minor role.
- UB+: Gives nothing against physical units, but gains a few new buffs against magic attackers. A massive increase in UB damage and large p.def debuff.
- CB: Has had niche roles as TP stealer/debuffer against Rairai & Madame Electra in the past, but is slowly fading away due to better units appearing in these roles. 
- PvP: Can be used to snipe Ames in comps where stuns will not prevent Tamaki from hitting first. Not a mainstay, but is reliable for sniping key magic units when you can't find someone else to do it.
- Tamaki's got a weird case of being designed for Arena, but being relevant in CB. As her stun does not offer a defensive debuff or any team utility, she will most likely continue to fall behind in cases where her TP steal is not enough to make her relevant. She lives on through her hat alts.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant for Ca.Tamaki)
Max level Unit priority: Med 
New player Unit priority: Med (Can help clear lower level magic 6* quests, assist in alternative anti-magic solutions in Arena and CB)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)


## -> Mifuyu <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, May 31st)
A quick 1st action stun means Mifuyu will always have some relevance, just varying degrees in both Arenas.
- UB+ Gives increased damage, increases the stun time to 4s and adds a condition that if the target being UB'd is already stunned, her UB will deal damage to and stun every other unit in the party.
- CB: I've tried.and it doesn't work. She's an Arena unit, so don't even think about it. Bosses can't get stunned anymore.
- PvP: Excellent lead or 2nd position with Inori or S.Misogi. Really shines in P.Arena, but can be used in B.Arena in certain solutions. Less dominant due to the release of S.Misogi, Miyako 6 Star and other factors, but still a force in both modes.
- PvE: See CB.
- Unless you're a PvP kind of person, you'll want to avoid her. And since stuns can miss thanks to being lower level, do be careful when using her if you choose to grab her early. Having a large amount of nodes means you CAN farm her quicky, but doesn't necessarily means you should prioritize her.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Mifuyu has no relevant alts)
Max level Unit priority: Med 
New player Unit priority: Low (helps in Arena efforts, just watch level difference for unexpected stun % chance misses.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Shizuru <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, June 30th)
Niche in both Arena and CB, you can't really go wrong with Shizuru.
- UB+: Increase the damage by a ton, adds a p.def buff, physical barrier and HP regen to all units within 300 range of her.
- CB:  Shizuru is actually pretty important when she's called upon, but these are usually the smallest of niches that come around infrequently. 
- Arena:  Shizuru helps stuff physical damage dealers, provide healing and is a nice contributor to shutting down those S.Hatsune/R.Rin style compes that are meant to explode units. She can also smash squishy units with her UB, if the occasion presents itself.
- PvE: Sometimes called upon for the same reasons called out above, but again - It's an extremely rare moment when it does happen.
- Solid unit that has some usage in several game modes when needed. Mostly a physical damage wall that can also offer heals, her usage in CB is usually the smallest of niches.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Relevant alts: Noir Shizuru)
Max level Unit priority: Med
New player Unit priority: Low (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Ayane <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, August 6th)
Supposed to be an Arena unit, but just doesn't have enough tools to complete with power creep.
- UB+: Increased damage, makes it an AOE damaging skill that applies stun to units within 375 range of the initial target and increases the stun time to 3s
- CB: No, as bosses do not get stunned.
- Arena: No, there are many better stun options.
- PvE: Unless you're trying to do some fancy position manipulation for fun or in Luna Tower, there's no reason to use her.
- Ayane is outdated and just can't keep up with the meta of Arena. You can try to make anything work in P.Arena and there are certainly opportunities that could work, but that's just a theory.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant alts: Ex. Ayane)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)

## -> Saren <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, September 7th) **Next to be updated**
Excellent unit that provides a buff at lower HPs, Saren role is more of a supporter.
- UB+: Deals increased damage, including another increase based on missing HP and a Magic & P.Atk buff for all friendly units.
- CB: 
- Arena: 
- PvE: 
- 


[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Akino <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, September 7th)
From absolute shit to absolutely necessary, Akino's legendary 6 Star release is one you need to be ready for. Her S1+ was also buffed when they gave her a 6 Star, most likely to ensure she's not trash by increasing the TP it gives.. Wyvern/Goblin rank autism is very real.
- UB+ is a massive damage increase, including the fire field it leaves behind. It also buffs her P.Atk and gives her a dual barrier.
- Akino's role in Arena is not as impressive as you'd think, but she is a great tank killer due to the consistent chip damage from her burn, while chipping other units so your canon unit can have an easier time crushing them.
- Akino in CB is consistently strong, but usually only against specific bosses like Goblin and Wyvern. A must have for CB, as Wyvern and Goblin are not very friendly to any alternative solutions due to their sheer power. Like the rest of T4/T5.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZTbVphDBBM
- Akino's revamped tools allow her to actually tank and shit out damage, though her comps usually come with the warning that you need specific ranks and equips for CB. In Arena, she takes a backseat but can be used in P.Arena very rarely.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Ninon <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, October 7th)
The Devs clearly knew that Akino and Ninon were pathetic 5 Star units, as they decided to make them both ridiculous, for different reasons.
- UB+ bring Ninon increased range, an increase in damage and condition to do even more based on enemies fought. It also buffs her P.Atk for every UB, alongside granting her 100 TP that can be affected by her TP Gain. Meaning The lesson here is that if she kills 2 units with her UB, she gets another UB instantly. 
- As stated above, Ninon can ramp up extremely quick. Her range is so large, that she'll pop any team not carefully crafted to withstand her UB spam. Maho can only really stop her with blind, IF she is 2nd slot. Kasumi can slow her down if she's the front unit, but this is a risk, considering it means you're running a squishy backline team to get Kasumi's snare out fast. She can only really be stopped by Inori/Mifuyu comps that can pop her, if she's first slot. Absolutely necessary for Arena lovers. Enjoy finding out that your P.Arena team got railed by a Ninon comp, when you couldn't see it.
- Not used in CB
- Ninon throws the meta in the trash and becomes it, thanks to how close she stands to Saren. With a Yuni shield, Magical Girl Kasumi CC and a Yuki CC, she is tough to shut down on offense. Not amazing on defense, unless the enemy makes a small mistake - She'll turn around and fuck the entire offense.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Mahiru <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, November 5th)
Unfortunately, all Mahiru versions are laughable except in some Arena niche cases. At least she's adorable.
- UB+ turn it AOE, gives an increase in damage, increased Stun time to 5s, knocks back and applies confusion to anyone within 300 range of that first target hit.
- Her UB+ sounds great for Arena, but in reality she is incredibly niche on release and is only carried to popularity briefly because people didn't know what she did. It was quickly realized that Mahiru's 1st action being only damage and a self buff is extremely shit in a meta where the first action can decide an entire match. She had a tiny niche in P.Arena, but only for getting cheesy wins against ill-prepared blind parties.
- No use in CB, ever
- Mahiru wasn't even that great on release, then fell when people realized that she had zero impact on the first skill. But if she can avoid getting 1 tapped, she does have niche scenarios that she can contribute.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Suzuna <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, December 7th)
A forgotten DPS that get a bit of a resurgence during her initial window, Suzuna's 6* quietly fades away.
- UB+ Increase the damage she deals and gives a 25% P.Crit damage boost for 18s
- No real arena usage to speak of, aside from some silly Arena comps where she double UBs with Luna to pop unsuspecting Yukari frontlines. IF she gets the right matchup.
- Sees an okay amount of CB usage in niche scenarios, but quickly falls off when it's realized that only her initial UB hit is a guaranteed crit. Her S1+ & S2 are so shit that she might as well not have any skills. It doesn't help that her S1+ animation takes forever, for a small amount of damage. Briefly an OF monster. Luna + Suzuna allows Suzuna to actually abuse her +25% crit damage buff, due to Luna's decline in the meta for T5. This niche is VERY brief.
- Overall, Suzuna fails to impress outside a few performances. Not necessary, but nice to have. 
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Akari <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, January 7th)
This 6 Star breathes life back into Akari's Nyaru niche and allows her to tank even better.
- UB+ greatly increases the value of her M.Atk buff, increased Magical crit rate and now has a M.Def debuff.
- Not an Arena unit, nothing to see here.
- An amazing Nyaru CB unit, as she was previously. Keep her at rank 11 untill rank bonus is in play. Sees lower usage as bosses get more damage and Akari's stats are not enough to tank, while providing no damage of her own.
- As she's a dungeon unit, definitely one to prep for the January CB as she provides excellent support during her usage window.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Yori <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, February 8th)
Get used to seeing double Yori UBs pop your arena team, because she's here for a while.
- UB+ increases the damage deal, range and adds a a damage modifier based on missing HP.
- Yori goes from shit to a great Arena unit and destroyer of worlds. If she can get a UB off after her initial skill and not die, she's gold. If she takes damage and isn't killed, her missing HP modifier will make sure the opponent dies if they don't have a shield. Brings Rin back into meta, because the squirrel packs a buff strong enough to absorb the damage and turn it into TP for the opposing team.
- Her CB usage is quite limited to one decent Glutton comp, but nothing too special. Not necessary.
- A 6 Star must for Arena folk, Yori provides an excellent option for Arena offense solutions and P.Arena blind insta kills. 
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Misogi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
Who?
- UB+ gives and increased amount of damage, P.Atk/P.Crit Rate/ P.Crit Damage of all units struck. 
- While Misogi seems like a unit that could have a niche as an anti-Ninon/Rino unit, in reality you aren't going to run a Misogi canon comp because of her position and shit damage. No place in either P.Arena or B.Arena
- No use in CB
- Outside of a single use in an event rank in 2022 JP, Misogi 6 star has seen zero use. Barely even worth the story bond increase for H.Misogi EX4 tomfoolery.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Mimi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
Mimi was useless, now she isn't... Kind of
- UB+ turns her 2 hit UB into a full on multi-target move, with increased range and a 2nd hit that deals more damage in a smaller range.
- Mimi sees decent usage in P.Arena, but not amazing in a world where she can't be the 4th slot in a Yukari boosting comp. However, with support later on - Mimi becomes an effective offense against choice defensive Rin 6 Star setups. A niche is a niche and this one is nicely carved out so far.
- Sees initial usage in some decent comps, but never really wows anyone in CB due to lacklusture skills. A common theme amongst older units.
- Mimi is a nice 6* to have for the Dungeons and sometimes in arena, but not really a must have. Unless you're a diehard Arena player who need to have every possible solution available to you.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Kyouka<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
The most popular of the three, KMR clearly knew what he was doing to bring her back.
- UB+ give Kyouka a massive increase in damage and a new x4 multiplier if she crits.
- Kyouka actually has the distinction of being the only unit in the game that can crush any tank that doesn't have a m.def boost and Yukari shield. With a boost and one debuff on the target, her UB will punch through anything. Unfortunately, Luna is in front of Kyouka - So no optimal Kyouka canons. The only one who can really survive through this, is Peco.
- Kyouka's back in the CB scene, but not as dominant as she once was before Nyaru. She's quite good in OF comps, however. A great unit to have for versatile usage.
- Kyouka is a fantastic 6 Star to have, but not 100% necessary for any game mode except for some Luna Tower floors, but you can borrow from there.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Nozomi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, April 7th)
The original tank unit comes back to reclaim her throne in non-CB modes.
- UB+ upgrades the P.Atk buff a decent bit, increases her taunt to 11s and increases the values of her defensive buffs. She gains a stun on all enemies and a dual damage barrier that gets granted to all friendly units.
- Arena isn't exactly Nozomi's strong suit, but she can squeeze into niches where you need to need to have your units survive something like a Summer Hatsune cheese strat and then murder all the squishy units involved in it.
https://youtu.be/qXb4CMDndr4?t=402
- CB is not where Nozomi excels, but she can be used to do poverty B1 hits if you have her.
- Nozomi is amazing in PvE content that isn't CB and one of the greatest tanks in the game. Definitely raise yourself a 6 Star Nozomi if you're ever having issues clearing story, especially for new players.

## -> Suzume <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, May 7th)
No more RNG, Suzume's got an actual function now.
- UB+ Increased damage, a new m.def down debuff, higher debuff values and a complete removal of Suzume's 67% chance of only shredding for half, Suzume's UB+ gains consistency.
- Not seen in Arena, move along.
- CB is not really her thing, but can be used in very specific CB multi-target poverty comps.
- Suzume's real purpose is in Dungeon clearing, where she will provide another great multi-target option against EX4 & 5. Also seen quite often against SP Dungeon, but these are quite a ways away. Clan coins are scarce, so make sure you farm appropriately for your needs.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Kurumi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, June 7th)
Dogshit unit turned into Arena tank, Kurumi actually serves a purpose and carves a niche.
- UB+ gains a bit of damage, AOE stun, dual defensive party buffs and a heal to friendly units within 225 range of her.
- Kurumi lives for Arena, stalling out enemies and absorbing damage. She finally has the stats to back up her tanking and CC bot dream. Sees a good amount of usage on release, simmers down into a more niche offensive solution after she gets solved defensively.
- No use in CB
- If you like Arena, you'll like Kurumi as an option. While not the most earth-shaking unit, Arena is about finding solutions. Kurumi facilitates that, so Arena autists should have her ready to go. Otherwise, massive skip.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Kaori <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, July 8th)
Kaori's reign returns, as she once was in CB. But this time, with even more dominance over physical in more than just CB.
And then Eriko put her into the dirt
- UB+ gives Kaori extremely high damage increase and a permanent P.atk buff on every UB.
- Not much use in Arena, as she can't really break physical teams and there are much better options.
- CB is where Kaori used to really shine. However, bosses have received stronger mechanics and units require some absurd damage, breaking through the soft cap or utility in order to function in team comps. Kaori's extremely forward position also hurts her quite a bit.
- Kaori's purpose is to tank boss hits and lifesteal, no matter what game mode she's in. Unfortunately, [Eriko](https://rentry.org/Six_Star#eriko-jp-release-date-year-5-august-8th) can break through the damage cap and does what Kaori does. Now she's dead.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Aoi<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, August 6th)
Aoi's always had one niche, now she gets to do more cool poison things in Arena.
- UB+ gains a poison clause, where if any of the targets are poisoned - She does a lot more damage on UB. If not, she applies Venom to the targets damaged. Note that Poison is different than Venom, as her UB also inflicts poison to anyone hit by units by the UB, with a decently potent DoT.
- Aoi isn't really suited for the short 1-2 action meta of Arena, she moreso shines on offense where bust tanks by throwing poison and whittling away, while other units can finish them off. Either that or they eat a shit ton of poison damage and die. 
- Not used in CB, nice stats for the Aoi alts if nothing else.
- Aoi's niche is more or less the same, but her whole kit now works, instead of having a shitty UB. A skip for anyone that doesn't care too much about Arena, or isn't too concerned about tip top Aoi damage in CB.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Djeeta<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, September 7th)
KMR gave us a very special gift for 3.5 Anniversary, because Djeeta got a massive rework (Job change) and has been used in every game mode ever since.
- UB+ does a significant amount more damage and grants Djeeta a stacking P.atk buff that lasts 18s. She also had her skills reworked, so let's highlight them as they're the real reason she's so ridiculous.
- S1+ is now a 5 hit damage skill that gives herself 200 TP and 100 TP to teammates, adjustable by TP Boost.
- S2+ is now a triple hit attack that restores a very high amount of TP to Djeeta, based on the skill level. 
- Djeeta has a small niche in Arena, but in comps where she doesn't get stunned, she can start to soften up tanks while gifting TP to other units. Still, not an amazing Arena unit as more units get released.
- Djeeta absolutely dominates CB. Just by reading her rework, 2 skills that give TP AND do damage is a sign of great success. This works extremely well with her UB, as she can stack up to easily hit the damage cap. She now has enough stats to tank, giving her even more TP and can play into the lifestealing tank role. 
- Djeeta and Kaori pair up extremely well for physical comps, as Kaori's only issue is getting enough TP to keep UB'ing. Djeeta is so dominant that you'd do well to farm her every month from the moment you start reading this sentence, in order to prepare to max her UE and LB her. She's going to see usage in all modes. In the conversation for the best unit in Princess Connect! Re:Dive.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Nanaka<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, October 7th)
Not a bad unit, but just doesn't compete for what her role is in the meta.
- UB+ Increased damage and a m.def debuff to the unit struck. Still targets highest HP unit.
- Arena isn't where Nanaka is used, as her highest HP unit-based targeting and buffed UB+ won't net her any kills, unless you're facing some garbage comp. Which will die to anything else anyway.
- Nanaka's reputation as a budget magic debuffer continues, as she struggles to really find her spot. Her S1+ Debuff does zero damage, is AOE and Neneka already covers AOE debuffs at this point in the meta. Her S2 is a shitty stun that does pitiful damage. Her UB+ cannot carry her other two abysmal skills.
- Nanaka is a miss, not a unit really worth getting to 6 Star if you have to choose.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Arisa<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, November 8th)
Rishes from the ashes, Arisa's got a solid role with a 6 Star in hand.
- UB+ Increases the damage dealt and adds a new function where her counter multiplies her damage dealt, once she crosses the threshold of 5 counter stacks. 
- She's not really worth anything in arena by this point.
- Arisa is amazing in CB, because of her S1+ providing her constant UBs to quickly stack up her counters. She also is very far back, that she can safely fire damage without her frail Archer stats getting her popped. She gets used fairly often in comps where others tank for her. Not as dominant as Djeeta, incredibly important to have when she's called upon. Especially during her release window and vs Goblin.
- Arisa is a CB machine, so start farming her nodes now before you forget. Don't get tripped up and have to waste Whale Tears on a permanent unit.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Monika<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, November 8th)
Monika now having an actual UB means that she gets to be useful as a support. Or doing 130 million damage.
- UB+ increase range, gained stun and increased  damage are quite nice. The real prize here are the P.atk, M.atk & Action speed buffs she gains and provides.
- Provides a nice mid option on release, good usage in defenses. Sees an okay amount of usage in Arenas afterwards, for the stun and buffs. Not a staple, but can offers solutions to defenses. 
- CB is where Monika made her name, as she is famous for her 1 hour Loop comp that 1 shots a 130 million HP boss. Other than that, she provides good but won't always be seen. Still useful to have.
- She's an Arena coin unit, so definitely recommend as a high priority to farm up and get ready for her release. That CB will be a memorable one for anyone doing the T5 1 shot loop. Also good for PvE content like Luna Tower and Dungeons.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Misaki<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, December 7th)
Another previously useless unit pulled into relevance, due to the upgrades. 
- UB+ Increased damage and now applies curse. It a unit is cursed or hexed, they will now be charmed if hit by her UB. If all enemies are hexed when this UB hits, units will have Curse applied. If **even one target is  hexed**, then Hex will be applied to all units. Hex damage is increased by 30% from the base damage per second, for 19 seconds.
- Getting Misaki to UB twice in a short period is the name of the game here, or at least getting her to apply her Curse and charm over the course of the fight. The DoT from them are incredibly powerful. However, the fact that even one missed Hex means you missed out on Curse & charm is a hard condition. A great offensive Arena option, Misaki is here to stay. 
- No use in CB
- Get farming, as she'll want LB, max UE and max rank to work at peak efficiency for the Arena folk. Anyone else, skip her because she's worthless in any other mode.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Chika<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, January 7th)
Just don't level her shitty S2 & EX skill. A nice support to have in the roster, sees some niche usage.
- UB+ gives a stronger heal. New additions are a P.Atk buff, 28% P.Crit damage and applies an HP Regen for 18.5s
- Nothing to see for Arena, move on.
- A nice support unit in CB that doesn't see as much use for top tier comps, but helps out quite a bit in the 2nd tier range of comps. The 28% increase in P.Crit is quite nice, as it breaks through the soft cap a bit easier.
- Overall, not a necessary unit to have. As she's clan coins store, it's hard to justify farming her early over Io, Suzume and X.Saren. But if you do, you'll be happy about it. 
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> S.Kokkoro<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, March 7th)
Amazing support for physical comps, good thing side stories are a thing.
- UB+ now heals all units, but heals the lowest HP units for a larger amount. New additions are a p.def debuff for all enemies,  20% increase in P.Crit damage, TP Boost increase and P.Atk increase for all friendly units.
- No use in Arena
- Amazing CB unit, she's everything you want in a physical support. With 6 Star stats, she's able to withstand hits from bosses that deal party-wide damage. The buffs listed above speak for themselves, especially when paired with Djeeta, Kaori, P.Rei, etc... Not having her is a pretty big detriment to your physical routing. Was thought to have EX level autism, so best not to level it
- While S.Kokkoro is only 4 months old, she's proven to be an exceptional unit in several events, Luna Tower and CB. If you aren't farming her, then you should be - Her impact is immediately felt.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> S.Kyaru<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, March 7th)
Able to push the soft cap higher, S.Kyaru breaks out in a big way.
- UB+ adds a m.def debuff and a new mechanic, where the condition is if the enemy is having its m.def reduced, it will take additional damage.
- Very small niche where she can pop tanks if she can get going, but not really worth for the general Arena usage.
- S.Kyaru is back to get involved in magic CB comps. The debuffs and damage she outputs means that she has very good usage. In particular, against T4/T5 Wyvern and Goblin. Similar to Nyaru in that you can build comps around her, but she does not require any ramp up for her UB to start shitting out damage. She needs the buffs from other units like NY.Neneka for the ramp up period, however.
- CB players should get her ASAP and expect to use Whale Tears to do so. Either that or farm her in the Master Shop every month, but just make sure you get her.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> S.Pecorine<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, March 7th)
Excellent physical multi-target unit that needs to tank.
- UB+ gives a slight increase in UB range and offers a p.atk buff to self based on damage dealt that is capped.
- Not very useful in Arena, get blasted by magic in particular. Ninon is just better.
- A multi-target specialist, S.Peco needs a lot of support to work. However, the sheer amount of damage she puts out is ridiculous. Peco's role is similar to Muimi in the past, where she eats damage to do damage consistently. Instead of keeping up her TP for UB form, she wants to keep getting TP to keep her buff up. 
- S.Peco is an excellent unit for her CB usage, but requires a ton of investment as she's a frontline unit. This also includes her UE, which has TP retention on it. Since she UBs so often and sometimes pairs with Saren for double UBs, this stat is incredibly important. Another must have unit for CB.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Kuuka<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, April 7th)
Doesn't change much, aside from updating her to be a massive magic wall again.
- UB+ grants a bigger shield, same HP restore value, but cuts incoming magic damage by 25%.
- Kuuka's great if you're facing magic teams that don't have a way to slice through her on the physical side. Other than that, she's more or less the same unit that is slightly tankier for defense. Offense, she's alright.
- Kuuka is useful for some PvE content that requires taunts, but mostly only against magic. If not, you'd just use Nozomi if the taunt being delayed isn't a problem. She's not extremely important, just a nice to have unit.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Rin <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, May 9th)
Brings back a taste of CB level autism, you needed to have ignored Arena or Rin to have prepared for this.
- UB+ grants a stronger P.atk buff, M.Def buff and the same heal value. New additions are +15 TP boost, increased P.Crit rate and HP drain effect (Same as Akari's UB).
- Rin was used in Arena to ward off Yori because of her 1st action m.def buff, but now does it even better while providing an even better UB buff. Seen in decent defenses, Rin's role is more or less the same as a blocker of magic burst comps. 
- Her usage has only been for 1 CB, but anything with TP boost is immediately hailed as a great unit. The issue with Rin is that she was primarily an Arena unit up to this point. As her TP Boost is a flat rate no matter what level she is, the goal is to have her tank against a boss and constantly provide TP boost, heals and be able to survive while taking the maximum amount of damage possible. Enjoy your level autism
- While Rin has only 2 CBs of usage under her belt, the impact she had was felt pretty quick on a magic team with S.Kyaru vs Wyvern. This comp was the highest damage comp available, so it was important to have her. Max level alternatives offered less damage, but still worked. A good start for her niche, but it remains to be seen if she'll have more use cases.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Miyako <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, June 6th)
If you hated Miyako's reign in EN, you'll hate her even more now.
- UB+ gives her increased damage and a new permanent dodge increase.
- Miyako faded off due to her stats not being high enough to absorb anything in most cases, but that's no longer an issue. She's an excellent defense unit. You don't need her, but most top Arena defenses do include her and make it more difficult for shit players to solve her. Back to being an impossible physical wall.
- No CB usage.
- Miyako won't help you break defenses, but will help you break the mentality of those not able to solve her. People actually need to prep comps for her,  because she can stall an entire physical team by herself. A nice addition to an Arena player looking to always maintain top 10.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Misato <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, July 6th)
Nice budget option, as predicted.
- UB+ does not change the values of her heal or m.def buff. New additions are a M.atk buff, M.Crit damage increase and an HP regen effect, 18s each.
- Misato has not seen any successful Arena usage so far on defense or offense as of yet, but this could change.
- Based on her 1st CB performance, Misato is a decent full auto safety option for those looking for budget comps in T4/T5 or non-max players looking for a way to survive. 
- Misato is a nice budget option in the dungeon for newer players to get easy access to, but that's about it. Her 6 Star challenge is probably pretty easy with a strong physical team, too.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Eriko <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, August 8th)
After 3 months of data, can confirm that she's pretty good and quickly becoming a staple of physical CB teams.
- UB+ increases damage and removes the "if target is killed" buff branch with a new "If target is not killed" buff branch. If her UB does not kill, she gains a 40% P.Crit damage buff. New effects are an increase in P.Crit damage taken by targets hit by her UB for 18s, a permanent P.Atk buff to self on each UB and her UB is split into two damage calculations. The last part is extremely important, because it means her UB can bypass the softcap of around 1.125m per UB, allowing for her to hit 2.25m UBs total.
- A decent choice in arena against full tank teams, since she can buff herself to a point where she 1 taps them. Niche as heck though.
- Kaori is dead because of Eriko now
- We have little data to back this up, but Eriko's 6 Star is similar to what we saw with Kaori - A revival of a former dominant unit. She has 7 farmable nodes, good luck.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Shinobu <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, September 7th)
Not a great unit so far. More of an arena unit, but doesn't see too much usage there anyway.
- UB+ gives increased 150 range, damage. New effects are an action speed decrease by x65 of original value for 12s and a guaranteed fear for any unit hit by the UB.
- Not seen in September or October CB, most likely due to skull dad fucking up things. She may be used for specific bosses, so don't count her out completely. Also S2 being 38 def down per target is a joke.
- I haven't seen too much of Shinobu in Arena, but that could just be my bracket. Posisbly used in some niche offenses, but does not offer much outside of the fear. Skull dad also is a free TP gain for enemies given the nature of Arena.
- Doesn't really have a place anywhere currently, but maybe in the future. Other units just have better def down options and aren't stuck between being Arena/CB viable.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Ilya <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, September 7th)
No longer can crit herself to death, Ilya's got use now.
- UB+ gives increased damage, increased HP restoration and gives her a stack of her S1+ mark (Buffing m.atk, up to 4 stacks on UB). New effect is that she now gains 50% reduced crit dmg from herself for 18s after every UB.
- Used in September CB, Ilya was quite good vs the new Wyvern Rider B2. If she isn't constantly targeted by autos, Ilya can self-sustain even in T5 vs multi-target bosses.
- Not seen in Arena as of late, probably because her skills suck and she's too far forward to kill anyone. 
- Great in EX5, especially Mode 1 of the boss since it has so many targets for her to crush.
- A very nice unit to farm up for Dungeon bosses and has some niche usage where P.Yui cannot function. We'll see more of her once Wyvern Rider comes back, though there are higher damage comps. Add to your collection as 2 nodes permits, no rush.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Tomo <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, October 5th)
Action speed buffs are amazing and Tomo's got one. She also does damage, unlike Monika.
- UB+ increased damage by x2. New effects are that Tomo's buffs off UB are now applied to all units who are within 150 range of her, meaning she now grants Actions speed & P.Atk to teammates for 24s.
- Tomo had a great showing in T3/T4/T5, being a part of a T4 B1x2 team. She has a similar role to Monika, where applying an Action speed buff overrides any debuffs previously given to your units. This was on full display against Wyvern T4/T5, as Tomo's UB cancelled out the debuff from Wyvern UB.
- No Arena data usage on my end or to report. Probably because she's so far forward and her skills are all damage.
- Excellent in dungeons, due to 6* stats, multi-target nature and team buffs.
- Overall, Tomo had a good 1st month. Although she cannot tank like Monika can, she's able to find her spots in team comps when needed so far. She's got 5 side story nodes & 1 hard node, so good luck farming her. She needs max UE too.
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Shefi <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, November 7th)
Pretty good so far
- UB+ Increases damage, increased mark stacks from 10 to 20, counter stacks from 10 to 13 and increased gain in marks from 5 to 7 per UB. New effect is increasing all units TP gain by 10 x number of marks (can go up to 30) if Shefi has her field up. 
- She's done well in her initial CB, but only really against Goblin. Look forward to future usage, as she's good in longer fights.
- No Arena usage from initial looks, seems doubtful given how much she needs to ramp up.
- Probably great in PvE content like dungeon, but not necessarily necessary given the miriad of characters available. 
- While Shefi looks quite good, she also requires a lot of investment to maximize her full potential. She only has one node and requires maxed UE as well, since it has TP Boost. Definitely an every day farm unit.

## -> Mitsuki <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, December 7th)
A reliable debuff attached to her UB, probably a unit to keep an eye out for in the future.
- UB+ doubles damage dealt and adds a new p.def debuff that is equal to Mitsuki's level +1. Still requires a kill to heal her for the 20% per kill. **Her UB+ debuff is applied before damage calculation, which seems to be a 1st.**
- Could see some fringe usage in Mutli-target physical comps, but magic has been winning that war. Mitsuki probably won't change that, just might improve it a bit more since 6* stats help her out. Unless they neuter magic MT comps, you won't see her.
- Somewhat effective in Arena defenses, but nothing mind-blowing. Can get away with not having her, but good for some solutions on offense.
- A debuff is always welcome in PvE modes and various SP stages with her curse on S1+, but is still not amazing.
- Since Mitsuki is easy to farm, she's a welcome addition to a roster that is building towards more options, but not a must-have. Could change if magic dies in multi-target though.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Jun <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, January 5th)
UB went from whatever to fantastic. When you need a tank, Jun is a good choice.
- UB+ Increases the barrier value to Jun. A new effect is that she spawns a field that buffs units P.Atk that are within the field. The range is 300 for the field. The field also increases action speed by 155%. This effect can stack with other action speed buffs.
- Has seen some good usage against bosses that require a tank and in some OF comps, a solid choice overall.
- Not really  a good Arena unit, since her skills are not built for that mode. Maybe you can cheese out some wins with a 5 stack of tanks, but doubtful.
- Will most likely prove useful in PvE modes, where you will need a tank.
- Jun has two nodes, definitely worth farming. A unit with two action speed buffs and a def down is pretty rare. Does zero damage, so will be situationally good.


[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)


## -> Ayumi <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, February 6th)
The bane of physical Arena comps is back and she's here to stay.
- UB+ Deals increased damage, doubles the confusion duration from 4s to 8s, doubles the blind duration from 6s to 12s. New effects are a TP boost reduction by 50 for 12s, having a counter on UB that increases by 1 every time she UBs, capped at 3. This counter increase the UB damage done by the amount of counters she has.
- She's not a CB units, don't do it.
- Probably the most obnoxious defense units to be released in the past few months, Ayumi pumps out so much CC that it's nearly impossible to fight her with a physical team. However, she does not do well into magic teams that can stop her antics. Like other CC, hers do not apply if the unit's barrier does not break from the damage.
- Comes from the dungeon shop, so if you're an Arena enthusiast - This is probably a girl you want to target. Outside of Arena, she is not useful. But so far, she's proven to be a thorn in the arena meta that won't be leaving any time soon.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)

## -> Christina <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, March 5th)
Ultimate Chris domination so far, welcome back. Another damage cap circumventor, you're gonna hear her UB voice line a lot.
- UB+ Splits her UB damage into two different damage calculations, allowing her to deal up to 2.2m damage on a single UB. In addition, her UB now applies a p.def debuff.
- Absolute monster in her first CB showing, flattening bosses and dodging all of their attacks. Christina tank comps are back in a big way. Definitely a must-have 6* for any CB enthusiasts.
- Most likely not an arena unit, due to her lack of utility and inability to dodge magic damage. Maybe you can get some wins against full physical teams with an S.Misogi in front of her in P.Arena.
- Overall, she's slated to be a CB star. With only one month of data, there's no telling what the future holds for Christina. But if that single month is a good indicator, she's not going anywhere.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)


## -> Anna <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, April 5th)
She's a giant nuke now. Either she kills everyone, or she'll explode due to lose 100% of her defenses after UB.
- UB+ increased damage by nearly x5, no changes to reducing defenses by 100%. New addition is that she buffs her M.Atk for 8 seconds for a large amount.
- Probably not suited for CB single target comps anymore, but could actually be a Multi-target damage dealer. Most likely would need support from units that give defenses, because having 0 M/P Defense is not great for CB. I doubt she'll have a spot, this is mostly just hope. Still worth keeping an eye out for, given the amount of barriers/heals in the game.
- Some early testing shows that she can [carry an entire arena team](https://twitter.com/leonmaru_pcrd/status/1643449297026023425). She's a stall breaker and the hope is to nuke everything, then the 2nd UB finishes off any stragglers. Any squishies can get wiped off the face of the earth. Her positioning means she's difficult to snare with MS.Kasumi as well. Yuki can charm her if she's in the 2nd position, so be careful. Finally, she needs a M.Atk Debuff to help her UB wipe enemies, so something like an NY.Homare with a 1st action M.Def Down works. 
- Overall great in both Arenas on the defensive and offensive side. Think of Ninon, but on the magic side and stronger. CB is a pipe dream, maybe in some sort of wacky OF comp.

[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star/edit#6-stars)


## -> Muimi<- (JP Release Date: Year 6, May 8th)
More damage with damage cap circumvent, a CC immunity and 6 Star stats means Muimi might make a return to her former glory..
- UB+ will now give Muimi a mark, giving her a complete immunity to CC [as displayed in the Cygames demo](https://twitter.com/priconne_redive/status/1655407423233069057). The UB damage is now to all front enemies, instead of just the first one. She also receives an additional damage calculation on her SP1+ & SP2 if she has a mark, meaning these skills will be able to circumvent the damage cap.
- While the demonstration was shit, Muimi's niche of tanking as 1st position, keeping her UB up and spamming her SP1+ > SP2 > SP1+  loop in UB form may return with an Ames and increased 6* stats behind her. Her biggest concern will always be to stay in UB form and not exploding while pumping out damage. Lots of bosses have ways to drain TP or don't give TP on their UBs, so that's something to keep in mind.
- Could see some P.Arena usage or niche Arena solutions like Chris, but most likely won't be a common unit. Being immune to CC certainly helps, but she does not dodge things like curse from Misaki and will still take damage.
- With Twin Pigs this month, a physical 1st position unit that always want to take damage may also hold great value. With tons of barriers, TP gain and heals available to Muimi compared to when she was previously meta, don't be surprised to see her run over bosses that can't 1shot her. Maintaining her TP values should be easier with stuff like X.Miyako, Laby, Ames. Similar to how GreAnne require the team built around them, Muimi will most likely need a team built around her. For Auto players, Muimi is very auto friendly due her UB draining instead of needing to be re-activated constantly.
