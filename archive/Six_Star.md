# 6 Stars 
All 6 Star units get increased base stats and a UB+ that enhances that skill. Some 6 Stars get better UB+ upgrades than others. 
Ratings will be given for Bond story, Max level and low level priority rating. This goes from: **Top > High > Med > Low > Luxury**

Top - Rules the meta in relevant category.
High - Great choice if you're running low on top priority picks
Med - Can wait if you're trying to manage resources, but good
Low - Not super important, but nice to have
Luxury - Collection purposes only if you have extra resources to fluff about with

PvE is defined as a general category for anything that isn't Arena or CB such as Event SP, Dungeons, Luna Tower, Special Dungeon, etc... 

Last Updated: November 5th, UE2s have been taken into consideration, so units will be re-considered during their release.
[TOC2]

## -> Kyaru <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Does not see any usage, a stat stick for her other versions.
- UB+: Gives her double damage and a fear debuff that prevents units from using their UB.
- UE2 stats: +6000HP, +2400 M.Atk, +120 Pdef & +120Mdef
- S2+: With UE2, debuff to P&M def increase by 316. New effects are paralysis for 3s and increased Crit damage received by units affected by S2+ within 300 range, by 20%.  
- CB:  Has seen some usage in T2 1:30 OF comps, but isn't a must. Better for Pyaru bond stories though.
- Arena: With actual CC and increased stats from UE2, Kyaru has been a fairly consistent performer in Arena since its release. Fairly strong in P.Arena defenses and double Kasumi/Kyaru (Ex. Kyaru, Pyaru, MS.Kasumi & Kasumi + Karin) offenses, she is certainly a force to respect when building a team.
- PvE: Not extremely useful overall, but has a decent debuff that could sneak in some usage.
- Kyaru is a prime exame of how strong a UE2 can be. She's gone from complete trash to a nice Arena unit in no time. Worth farming up, given how easy it is if you want to get a good bit of leverage in Arena.

Bond story priority: High (Relevant for O.Kyaru, Pyaru, TS.Kyaru)
Max level Unit priority: High
New player Unit priority: Med

## -> Kokkoro <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Can be a decent stop-gap for tanking and healing if you're missing some, but definitely an outclassed support.
- UB+: gives her a big party heal, increased buff values and gives units +10 TP boost for 18s per UB and stacks.
- CB: Outfclassed by her own Princess version, which is currently outclassed by other units. A victim of power creep.
- PvP: No CC as a support and no reason to use, her skills are not very good in PvP.
- PvE: Nice heal if you don't have decent options for healing and TP buffs, but just overall outdated.
- You can find limited, cope use for her since she has TP Boost, but will always be a sub-optimal choice. There are simply too many supports that are just better. Bond story tier, like Kyaru.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for C.Kokkoro, NY.Kokkoro)
Max level Unit priority: Luxury
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher,  unless you have no healers)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Pecorine <- (JP release date: Year 2, August 31st)
Still has a niche in Arena offense, but no longer relevant in a meta sense. 
- UB+: Gives her a P.Atk buff that increases based on HP and increases the values of current defensive buffs gained from it
- UE2:
- S2+
- CB: Skillset is not appropriate for CB, do not attempt to use. 6 Star does not change this.
- PvP: Has some niche usage against those Summer Hatsune comps where they try to burst squishy targets, but isn't pivotal to those.
- PvE: Tanks generally need some sort of reason to be used, but Peco has none over options like Nozomi.
- Peco has no taunt or utility for her team, which many other tanks do. She has a lot of nodes early on, but you can blow through story with borrows and get other key 6 Star units to farm.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for P.Peco)
Max level Unit priority: Luxury
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Rino <- (JP release date: Year 2, September 30th)
Extremely niche and outclassed, not worth grabbing over other B.Arena units.
- UB+ gives an increase in damage and a x3.5 modifier for crits.
- CB: No chance as she's heavily reliant on crits and offers nothing outside of damage. Does not circumvent the damage cap.
- PvP: Very niche usage against full squishy teams without Ames, or other barriers. Thee issue is that the meta does not lend itself to that on defense or offense. P.Aren would be your best bet if you're a huge Rino fan with a diehard desire to make her work.
- PvE: Most PvE units are HP sponges, which Rino cannot deal with. Could deal a bit of damage in panic comps to clean up mutli-target dungeon bosses, but there are better options by far. 
- A running theme for the first few batches of 6 Star units - There are just better options, especially with Monika/Tamaki/Hiyori sharing the same store. Can still shred squishy teams, but so can many other units.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Rino has no good versions to note for this)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Rima <- (JP release date: Year 2, October 31st)
Even after all these years, Rima is still here and plays a part in Arena.
- UB+ gives increased damage, increased p.def buff and a physical barrier. 
- CB: Not worth looking at anymore, there are simply better tanks that offer actual utility like Action speed or TP restoration. Rima doesn't.
- PvP: Not as omnipresent because NY.Muimi is in side stories, but their roles are still critical in eating up a MS.Kasumi snare. Rima's barrier still continues to help block physical damage, but her role in defense is long gone. Every slot is precious in PvP, so you need a very good reason to leave your Pos 2 unit exposed to an S.Misogi/Inori/Mifuyu stun. In addition, her running in late does also manipulate positions for opponents due to her needing a spot to run to and changing up where units stop in relation to the enemy team. Certainly one to grab, or grab NY.Muimi.
- PvE: Not worth anything, unless MS.Kasumi pops up in some strange EX stage
- Rima will always be relevant to PvP, she's just tailor made for it. Everywhere else, she is nothing more than a joke.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Rima has no bonds worth speaking about)
Max level Unit priority: Med
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Io <- (JP release date: Year 2, November 30th)
Io 6* is another Arena unit that is required to fight for top spots in a comfy manner. Still used defenses & offense, though in fewer comps. 
- UB+ hits opponents with TP Boost reduction, increased damage, 1s increase on charm and drains TP from damaged units. If her skill does 0 damage because of shields, the charm and TP reduction do not take effect. Charm lasts 5s.
- CB: TP steal is nice, but zero reason to use her when other TP steal units like Noir Io do it better.
- PvP: Still a great PvP unit, just in choice defense and offenses. As metas have changed, Io has remained a stable part of most for her charm and TP steal.
- PvE: Can be used to watch units murder each other, but requires a lot of investment into having Io UB as often as possible. This can help lower level players clear individual Luna Tower floors, VH fights or main story nodes they may have been struggling with, but it's incredibly gimmicky. Other than this small niche, nothing of note.
- Arena enthusiasts should aim for Io, as she's a good part of a healthy box for offense solutions. Everyone else, just avoid her unless you enjoy running funny comps like the one mentioned above.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for Noir Io)
Max level Unit priority: High
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Yukari <- (JP release date: Year 2, December 31st)
Yukari is still going to show up and there's nothing we can do about it. Her TP charge is too valuable to fall out of meta in at least Arena.
- UB+ now heals, provides a m.def buff and increased shielding. 
- CB: Not very good use, but could be made to help in sub-optimal comps. Or you can just hit T3 instead.
- PvP: Yukari + good Arena unit (Ex. Anna, Ames) on offense/defense will never not be a good combo, as she can instantly fill a TP bar with a S2. Usually charges pos 4 unit, but this is dependent on positioning and gets weird because positions are strange in this game sometimes, especially with NY.Muimi or Rima involved.
- PvE: Similar to Ames in some ways, but a specialist against magic damage. She and Ames make for a good duo to protect your units, provided you can run 3 DPS. Very useful in comps for dungeons or Luna Tower, where you need a quick TP charge and a tanky position 1 unit to do it.
- Easy to farm up since she's a Dungeon shop unit and always relevant, she's a top priority to assist in clearing content for new players. If you're not a new player, you most likely have her. If not, then go get her.

Bond story priority: High (Relevant for X.Yukari, herself)
Max level Unit priority: Top (Why wouldn't you have her?)
New player Unit priority: Top (Can help clear EX3/4 if missing units that provide TP)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Maho <- (JP release date: Year 3, January  31st)
Still used in CB, still causing level autism, good Arena unit and worst of all - Extends timelines to incredibly high times because of how often units will UB. Another unit that has never left the meta and continues to see usage in all game modes still. There is no reason to not get this unit ASAP.
- UB+: Gives increased M.Atk and P.Def. The big upgrade is that her UB also gives a flat 120 TP to all units and restores 10 TP per second, for 10 seconds. Both the 120 TP & 10 TP per second are increased by the receiving unit's TP boost stat. 
- CB: Consistently seen in comps and mostly for her UB's huge TP restoration, but is the worst offender of level autism. Just go and look at any Wyvern Rider month and you'll see, but because increased defensive stats still affect TP Gain, she will always have some form of autism in timelines. We have a ton of TP boost, so her UBs will be granting a large amount.
- PvP: Niche PvP usage, but still does help with a blind and UBs in tanky comps to help lighten blows from hard hitting physical attacks. 
- PvE: Excellent for the reasons above, but just applied to all other modes. 
- Candidate for 1st 6 Star choice, she's just always going to be relevant. Her in combination with TP Boosters like Neneka are examples of why we now have a TP Boost stat cap. Even through that, Maho is a top tier pick in most parts of the game.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for C.Maho)
Max level Unit priority: Top (Why wouldn't you have her?)
New player Unit priority: Top (Necessary for early EX3/4)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Yui <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Mostly not used, but easy to farm with so many nodes.
- UB:+ Gives increased heal, physical barrier, p.def buff and an added buff to action speed.
- CB: Not relevant anymore, Ames is a better support in every imaginable way aside from action speed, which we can get from units like Karin or Monika.
- PvP: Outside of very cheesy full tank comps with shields and healing, Yui doesn't see much use in PvP due not having any CC.
- PvE: Can help clear against physical damage where folks may have struggled - But at that point, you can just Ames and a better unit. Seen sometimes in SP dungeon, but the first two boss floors and be cleared by many things and is not an indication that Yui is really strong.
- Past her prime, but has enough nodes to easily farm up when done with other units. Supports these days are just filled to the brim with utility and Yui does not compare. Obtain out of pure love, or do not touch until much later.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for S.Yui)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can assist for early EX3/4 comps, but not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Hiyori <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Hiyori has been relegated to niche Arena solutions, but at least it's something.
- UB+ increases her damage by double for the main target and triples it for the units who are hit by the multi-target portion, with an extra bit of range on the multi-target parts
- CB: Not relevant, just make sure you don't mistake her portrait for Piyori.
- PvP: Can see some usage in comps where there are many squishies and she can reach them with her UB. Not an Arena staple by any means, but a real niche is better than nothing.
- PvE: See CB, just don't. 
- There are better borrows for new players like Chris or Akino, so that's not something for her at this point. If you like having a flexible PvP box, grab her after key B.Arena targets like Monika, Tamaki. Helps Piyori's P.Atk though.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant for Piyori, maybe S.Hiyori)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help in a pinch for EX3/4 comps, certainly not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Rei <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, February 29th)
Rei is just okay, but no longer has a spot.
- UB+: Gives a massive increase in damage, alongside a unique buff that doubles the values of her skills. 
- CB: No usage, aside from maybe some T3 comps. But almost anything can do T3.
- PvP: Not built for PvP, she's too busy getting stuck in counter-slash. Many better options.
- PvE: Can help in some dungeon comps early on due to her UB+, but those are resources you could be using for another, better 6 star.
- The biggest thing Rei 6 Star contributes is having her bond stories apply to P.Rei and maybe S.Rei when her UE rolls around. She's now retired and won't be seen, unless something crazy happens.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for P.Rei, possibly S.Rei)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help in a pinch for EX3/4 comps, certainly not a main piece.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Hatsune <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, March 31st)
Do well in P.Arena to farm Anna instead, because Hatsune is on the bench.
- UB+: Gives an increased amount of damage damage vs physical targets, a m.def debuff and a 6s stun against anything physical.
- CB: No niche anymore, as we have many better options in magic damage multi-target damagers. Was mostly only used in loops anyway.
- PvP: Still sees some usage, but Misaki/Anna are mostly used in the magic space for PvP. Can still smash physical teams without proper magic barrier protection thanks to her stun, but that's usually just the enemy having a poor defense.
- PvE: Requires too much support for little return, so just avoid her for this purpose.
- The meta has naturally gained lots of ways to deal with Hatsune. From CC to shields like S.Chika, magic units need a bit more punch if they're going to break maxed out units running around with barriers.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant for S.Hatsune)
Max level Unit priority: Low 
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help clear lower level physical 6* quests)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Tamaki <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, April 30th)
Tamaki's still kicking, just in a minor role.
- UB+: Gives nothing against physical units, but gains a few new buffs against magic attackers. A massive increase in UB damage and large p.def debuff.
- CB: Has had niche roles as TP stealer/debuffer against Rairai & Madame Electra in the past, but is slowly fading away due to better units appearing in these roles. 
- PvP: Can be used to snipe Ames in comps where stuns will not prevent Tamaki from hitting first. Not a mainstay, but is reliable for sniping key magic units when you can't find someone else to do it.
- Tamaki's got a weird case of being designed for Arena, but being relevant in CB. As her stun does not offer a defensive debuff or any team utility, she will most likely continue to fall behind in cases where her TP steal is not enough to make her relevant. She lives on through her hat alts.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant for Ca.Tamaki)
Max level Unit priority: Med 
New player Unit priority: Med (Can help clear lower level magic 6* quests, assist in alternative anti-magic solutions in Arena and CB)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)


## -> Mifuyu <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, May 31st)
A quick 1st action stun means Mifuyu will always have some relevance, just varying degrees in both Arenas.
- UB+ Gives increased damage, increases the stun time to 4s and adds a condition that if the target being UB'd is already stunned, her UB will deal damage to and stun every other unit in the party.
- CB: I've tried.and it doesn't work. She's an Arena unit, so don't even think about it. Bosses can't get stunned anymore.
- PvP: Excellent lead or 2nd position with Inori or S.Misogi. Really shines in P.Arena, but can be used in B.Arena in certain solutions. Less dominant due to the release of S.Misogi, Miyako 6 Star and other factors, but still a force in both modes.
- PvE: See CB.
- Unless you're a PvP kind of person, you'll want to avoid her. And since stuns can miss thanks to being lower level, do be careful when using her if you choose to grab her early. Having a large amount of nodes means you CAN farm her quicky, but doesn't necessarily means you should prioritize her.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Mifuyu has no relevant alts)
Max level Unit priority: Med 
New player Unit priority: Low (helps in Arena efforts, just watch level difference for unexpected stun % chance misses.)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Shizuru <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, June 30th)
Niche in both Arena and CB, you can't really go wrong with Shizuru.
- UB+: Increase the damage by a ton, adds a p.def buff, physical barrier and HP regen to all units within 300 range of her.
- CB:  Shizuru is actually pretty important when she's called upon, but these are usually the smallest of niches that come around infrequently. 
- Arena:  Shizuru helps stuff physical damage dealers, provide healing and is a nice contributor to shutting down those S.Hatsune/R.Rin style compes that are meant to explode units. She can also smash squishy units with her UB, if the occasion presents itself.
- PvE: Sometimes called upon for the same reasons called out above, but again - It's an extremely rare moment when it does happen.
- Solid unit that has some usage in several game modes when needed. Mostly a physical damage wall that can also offer heals, her usage in CB is usually the smallest of niches.

Bond story priority: Luxury (Relevant alts: Noir Shizuru)
Max level Unit priority: Med
New player Unit priority: Low (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Ayane <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, August 6th)
Supposed to be an Arena unit, but just doesn't have enough tools to complete with power creep.
- UB+: Increased damage, makes it an AOE damaging skill that applies stun to units within 375 range of the initial target and increases the stun time to 3s
- CB: No, as bosses do not get stunned.
- Arena: No, there are many better stun options.
- PvE: Unless you're trying to do some fancy position manipulation for fun or in Luna Tower, there's no reason to use her.
- Ayane is outdated and just can't keep up with the meta of Arena. You can try to make anything work in P.Arena and there are certainly opportunities that could work, but that's just a theory.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant alts: Ex. Ayane)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Luxury (Does not improve clear for EX3 or higher)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Saren <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, September 7th)
Saren is purely a TP battery who sometimes cleans up enemy teams if she's lucky enough.
- UB+: Deals increased damage, including another increase based on missing HP and a Magic & P.Atk buff for all friendly units.
- CB: The tiniest of niches if there is an S.Peco OF comp that she is required to change her in, but even then we have alternatives that work better. Outside of that, nothing.
- Arena: Used to charge the closest unit towards her, usually in Ninon comps. Her TP restore is a 2nd action, so do look out for that. She can wipe squishies if she gets to low HP and doesn't have to cut through barriers.
- PvE: Largely useless, unless you have no other options for TP restoration and need to charge a specific unit close to her.
- Purely an Arena nich specialist, at least her other versions can benefit from her bond stories. However, not a bad unit to have in your Arena arsenal. Just dont look at her S1+.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant alts: Ex. Aki/Saren. X.Saren, S.Saren)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Low (Could make EX3/EX4 clears easier by charging P.Rei, but not much else)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Akino <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, September 7th)
The former borrow queen, reduces to nothing but bond stats or a new-player band-aid towards while building towards other units if you somehow get lucky on her shards.
- UB+: Massive damage increase, including the fire field it leaves behind. It also buffs her P.Atk and gives her a dual barrier.
- CB: No longer required in specific comps, just useless. Her niche is irrelevant in an era where we have Ames
- Arena: Not relevant either, maybe can burn tanks with the DoT from her UB. However, this requires her surviving.
- PvE: Used to be very good in clearing other content, but other units becoming tankier and have better utility means that her niche has died out. Borrow Chris in most cases, but Akino 
- Her skills are shit, but her UB+ is very nice. Unfortunately, there are many other units that have good skills and and UB+ so she's outclassed. She can still perform for those who get her, but there are simply better options that put her to shame.

Bond story priority: Low (Relevant alts: Ex. Aki/Saren)
Max level Unit priority: Low
New player Unit priority: Low (Can help as a cleanup unit, but not a main piece)
[Return to Top](https://rentry.org/Six_Star)

## -> Ninon <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, October 7th)
She's still good in Arena, but no longer the Meta-defining unit she once was. UB+ is the only reason she's worth anything.
- UB+: Gains increased range, an increase in damage and condition to do even more based on enemies fought. It also buffs her P.Atk for every UB, alongside granting her 100 TP per unit killed that can be affected by her TP Gain. 
- CB: Move along, don't even consider it. 
- Arena: Fallen out of the meta. but can still insta-pop anything that doesn't have a lineup of tanks, or can stun and kill her instantly. An ok blind P.Arena attack/defense, but definitely prone to failing.
- PvE: Not really suited for this outside of crushing pre-boss nodes in Dungeon. Units are just too tanky for her to utilize her UB+ buff.
- While Ninon has fallen off in Arena, she can certainly punch through a team that isn't properly built to counter her. The reason she's fallen out, is because of a few different factors, but mostly due to the meta getting tankier. In solutions where she works, there are now other solutions as well. This applies to offense and defense. The fact that her other skills outside of UB being completely worthless doesn't help, of course.

Bond story priority: Luxury (No relevant alts)

## -> Mahiru <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, November 5th)
Mahiru is pretty shit aside from some silly defenses that get shit on normally. She's actually used for her bonds, because X.Mahiru has CB niche usage.
- UB+: turns it AOE, gives an increase in damage, increased Stun time to 5s, knocks back and applies confusion to anyone within 300 range of that first target hit.
- UE2:
- S2+
- CB: No use in CB, ever
- Arena: Her UB+ sounds great for Arena, but in reality she is incredibly niche in a meta where the first action can decide an entire match. She has a tiny niche in P.Arena, but only for getting cheesy wins against ill-prepared blind parties.
- PvE: Outside of confusing enemies in some funny comps, not worth it.
- Mahiru wasn't even that great on release, then fell when people realized that she had zero impact on the first skill. But if she can avoid getting 1 tapped, she does have niche scenarios that she can contribute. X.Mahiru bond-tier, but X.Mahiru is also slightly niche.

## -> Suzuna <- (JP Release Date: Year 3, December 7th)
One of the more useless 6 Stars at this point. Selfish archer DPS with zero actual impact when compared against the best units.
- UB+: Increased damage she deals and gives a 25% P.Crit damage boost for 18s
- UE2: +4200 P.Atk, 420 P.Crit Chance
- S2+: Massive increase to P.Atk buff (over 20k P.Atk) that is now permanent. New effects are increased P.Crit dmg of self by 15% permanent and 150 TP to self.
- CB: UE2 did not save her and probably never will.
- Arena: Nothing worth using, just are better options that aren't even 6 Stars for what she could potentially do. What can she do? Nuke a single enemy.
- PvE: Enemies are too tanky for her, many better options most likely exist win your box without a 6 Star. See above.
- Even with an extra bit more P.Crit chance and TP restoration to self, Suzuna simply pales in comparison with other physical attackers, even other Archers like Arisa. Her skill loop is complete shit outside of the opening, so there's very little reason to want her. Maybe you'll see her in some OF comps one day, but don't hold your breath.

## -> Akari <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, January 7th)
Many better supports exist, so Akari is no longer used in most cases.
- UB+: Greatly increases the value of her M.Atk buff, increased Magical crit rate and now has a M.Def debuff.
- CB: May pop into a magic OF comp, but outside of that - Other magic units that are meta, will offer more value.
- Arena: No utility for arena, better options for debuffing that offer more than a debuff.
- PvE: Despite her VH node being a bother for new players, she isn't super useful for reasons listed above.
- Akari is a victim of ridiculous magic units being buffed by UE or new releases. This created an upper echelon of usable characters, which she is not a part of.

## -> Yori <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, February 8th)
Yori has her niche in Arena offenses and blind P.Arena defenses.
- UB+: Increases the damage dealt, range and adds a a damage modifier based on missing HP.
- CB: Magic damage dealers need to deal damage at all times, not just at low HP. So don't use her.
- Arena: Yori can be a surprise defender in P.Arena, since she can pop defenses that aren't ready for her. She also has her place in some Arena solutions, but isn't as dominant as she was in previous metas. Still a good unit to have in your toolbox.
- PvE: Having a unit function at low HP isn't good for clearing content, but she can probably assist in cleaning up dungeons when you need.
- Yori is still slightly relevant in both Arenas, but has the added bonus of having two alts that do see some usage in CB.

Bond story priority: High (Relevant Alts: A.Yori, X.Yori)
Max level Unit priority: Med

## -> Misogi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
Stat stick for S.Misogi, nothing else.
- UB+: Gives and increased amount of damage, P.Atk/P.Crit Rate/ P.Crit Damage of all units struck. 
- CB: Not a CB unit, just don't.
- Arena: Built for Arena, but blind doesn't hit magic units. Even against physical units, she's still pretty worthless.
- PvE: Just no.
- Misogi just doesn't cut in in the single niche she was designed for. Her only saving grace is that S.Misogi is an amazing arena unit, meaning 6 Star Misogi's bonds are worth a decent amount.

Bond story priority: Med (Relevant Alts: S.Misogi)

## -> Mimi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
Mimi was useless, now she isn't... Barely, in Arena.
- UB+ turns her 2 hit UB into a full on multi-target move, with increased range and a 2nd hit that deals more damage in a smaller range.
- CB: Many better multi-target physical units. Mimi is just a relic due to her ineffective skills. 
- Arena: Can be used in some niche Arena solutions, where she can isntantly flatten a team. But there are tons of 6 Stars worth building over her.
- PvE: Not worth starring in PvE content, but can help in dungeons when you're trying to clear a multi-target dungeon and are missing a decent physical damage dealer.
- Having 8 farmable nodes means that new players can get Mimi pretty early on. The unfortunate part is that her 6 Star quest will flatten you if you're not ready, meaning you farmed a useless unit for nothing.

## -> Kyouka<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, March 5th)
The most popular of the three, KMR clearly wanted her to return and she has.
- UB+ give Kyouka a massive increase in damage and a new x4 multiplier if she crits.
- CB: Some niche OF usage, but is dwindling in most cases.
- Arena: Kyouka actually has the distinction of being the only unit in the game that can crush any tank that doesn't have a m.def boost and Yukari shield. With a boost and one debuff on the target, her UB will punch through anything. Unfortunately, Luna is in front of Kyouka - So no optimal Kyouka canons. Unless she runs into a buffed up Kuuka 6 Star and has no support, Kyouka can pop anything with a single UB and enough crits.
- PvE: Can be good in some Luna Tower floors to absolutely maul tough units, but is fairly niche. As long as she doesn't die, she can pump out massive damage.
- Kyouka is a fantastic 6 Star to have, but not 100% necessary for any game mode except for some Luna Tower floors, but you can borrow from there. As with any damage dealer, you'll need to adequately prepare for her 6 Star Quest, or face the wrath of getting flattened over again.

## -> Nozomi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, April 7th)
The original tank unit comes back to reclaim her throne in non-CB modes. Easy to farm up.
- UB+: Upgrades the P.Atk buff a decent bit, increases her taunt to 11s and increases the values of her defensive buffs. She gains a stun on all enemies and a dual damage barrier that gets granted to all friendly units.
- CB: Can help with some weird cope comps on bosses that only damage the front target. Not actually good in CB.
- Arena: Not exactly Nozomi's strong suit, but she can squeeze into niches where you need to need to have your units survive something like a Summer Hatsune cheese strat and then murder all the squishy units involved in it.
https://youtu.be/qXb4CMDndr4?t=402
- PvE: Nozomi is amazing in PvE content, as she shields your entire team, stuns, heals, buffs p.atk and taunts enemies while soaking up damage. If you're having trouble clearing a particular story node due to death, a Nozomi UB could very well be the difference. Especially for new players, you'll want a tank. Being a dungeon shop unit means that there is a very easy path to her, even if you didn't initially roll her.

## -> Suzume <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, May 7th)
No more RNG, Suzume's got an actual function now. Too bad she is only clan coin shop farmable.
- UB+: Increased damage, a new m.def down debuff, higher debuff values and a complete removal of Suzume's 67% chance of only shredding for half, Suzume's UB+ gains consistency.
- CB: Just no. UB+ is nice but her skills are shit.
- Arena: Not seen in Arena, move along.
- PvE: She will provide another good multi-target debuff option against EX4 & 5. Nice if you don't have Creditta, for example. 
- Clan coins are scarce, so make sure you farm appropriately for your needs.

## -> Kurumi <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, June 7th)
Dogshit unit turned into Arena tank, Kurumi actually serves a purpose and carves a niche.
- UB+: Gains a bit of damage, AOE stun, dual defensive party buffs and a heal to friendly units within 225 range of her.
- CB: No use in CB, bosses don't get stunned.
- Arena: Kurumi lives for Arena, stalling out enemies and absorbing damage. She finally has the stats to back up her tanking and CC bot dream. Has a small niche in offensive solutions.
- PvE: Stunning isn't very necessary, but could act as an ok tank that throws out a lot of stuns. Or you could just use Nozomi.
- Kurumi is an Arena specialist that is nice to have. Another example of a decent unit with tons of hard nodes to farm, so nothing too impressive.

## -> Kaori <- (JP Release Date: Year 4, July 8th)
Ousted from her role, because selfish DPS units need at least some sort of reason to be used. Kaori does not have one.
- UB+: Gives Kaori extremely high damage increase and a permanent P.atk buff on every UB.
- CB: Cannot function as a 1st position unit anymore and only has one damage calculation against the damage cap. Sees some extremely sparce usage in OF comps, but is more of a poverty unit than anything.
- Arena: Not relevant, all she does is damage and stands so far forward to do nothing.
- PvE: Unless you have not acquire a single other physical 6 Star, there's no reason to be using Kaori over other popular choices like Djeeta, Tomo, etc..
- Once again, Kaori is just outclassed. Her dominance ended quickly, mostly because of units being able to circumvent the damage cap and providing better utility in the 1st position for team comps.

## -> Aoi<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, August 6th)
Aoi's always had one niche, now she gets to do more cool poison things in Arena.
- UB+: Gains a poison clause, where if any of the targets are poisoned - She does a lot more damage on UB. If not, she applies Venom to the targets damaged. Note that Poison is different than Venom, as her UB also inflicts poison to anyone hit by units by the UB, with a decently potent DoT.
- CB: Useless
- Arena:  Shines on offense where she busts tanks by throwing poison and whittling away, while other units can finish them off. Either that or they eat a shit ton of poison damage and die. Her higher M.Def does require max investment, but she's a good choice against NY.Homare defense comps.
- PvE: In modes where you need to do DoT/poison a unit instead of traditional debuffs/buffs, Aoi excels heavily. Otherwise, not extremely useful.

## -> Djeeta<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, September 7th)
 If you want the short version, Laby UE + X.Miyako + Christina may have pushed Djeeta out of the meta.
- UB+: Does a significant amount more damage and grants Djeeta a stacking P.atk buff that lasts 18s. She also had her skills reworked, so let's highlight them as they're the real reason she's so ridiculous.
- S1+ is now a 5 hit damage skill that gives herself 200 TP and 100 TP to teammates, adjustable by TP Boost.
- S2+ is now a triple hit attack that restores a very high amount of TP to Djeeta, based on the skill level. 
- CB: Slowed down in recent months due to high competition for spots. When every unit can give themselves TP, Djeeta's TP restoration and lack of other buffs for teammates begins to stand out. She's still a great choice, but may not be the top tier we used to know her as.
- Arena: Has a small niche in a few offense comps where the enemy doesn't simply try to pop you, but not too relevant.
- PvE: Consistently has seen usage in these modes, but may slip due to power creep. 
- Crazy as this could be, Djeeta is starting to fall off a bit all around. A lot of this can be attributed units like Laby/Piyori/X.Miyako/various supports having TP restoration in their kit, on top of other parts. Christina's return to the meta means that she will stand behind Djeeta, which has not proved desirable as of the writing of this guide. Despite all of this, she's still a strong unit in her own right and can easily slot back in based on boss lineups.

## -> Nanaka<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, October 7th)
Has no place in any mode unless you're sniping non-shielded units in Arena.
- UB+ Increased damage and a m.def debuff to the unit struck. Still targets highest HP unit.
- CB: If you somehow have her farmed up ahead of other 6 Stars, decent M.Def down choice if you're low on units. But outside of some massive cope or love for Nanaka, don't.
- Arena: Can snipe some squishy targets in Arena, but this requires a lot of work. 
- PvE: See CB. Not much different, really.
- Nanaka is a miss, not a unit really worth getting to 6 Star if you have to choose.

## -> Arisa<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, November 8th)
Risen from the ashes, Arisa's got a solid role with a 6 Star in hand.
- UB+ Increases the damage dealt and adds a new function where her counter multiplies her damage dealt, once she crosses the threshold of 5 counter stacks. 
- CB: Used a decent amount in good comps, pumps out good, consistent damage from the backline. Faded a bit overall, but an appearance every now and again is more than can be said for others.
- Arena: No usage, not really designed for Arena.
- PvE: Can see usage in certain SP events or Dungeon SP, decent in assisting as a consistent damage dealer when handling dungeon as well. Not exactly a star.
- Overall a solid damage dealer that spams her full TP bar gaining S1+ often enough. When she's in the best CB comps, can't be replaced/substitued due to this.

## -> Monika<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, November 8th)
Monika now having an actual UB means that she gets to be useful as a support for both magic and physical teams.
- UB+ increase range, gained stun and increased  damage are quite nice. The real prize here are the P.atk, M.atk & Action speed buffs she gains and provides.
- CB: Provides a 1st position unit with a large amount of utility listed. In addition to being able to override AS debuffs from bosses with her UB, she is tanky enough to eat hits and buff other squshiy units to make sure comps can run more damage, while Monika shores up the difference. Used fairly often.
- Arena: Can work in tanky comps, to provide an AOE stun and survive cheesy S.Hatsune/NY.Homare offense/defense teams. UB stunning helps as well and can snipe squishy targets. 
- PvE: Used in a lot of comps to clear things like SP Events, Luna Tower & Dungeon for more of the same reasons listed in the CB section.
- A must have for all game modes,

## -> Misaki<- (JP Release Date: Year 4, December 7th)
Another previously useless unit pulled straight into the meta of Arena.
- UB+ Increased damage and now applies curse. It a unit is cursed or hexed, they will now be charmed if hit by her UB. If all enemies are hexed when this UB hits, units will have Curse applied. If **even one target is  hexed**, then Curse will be applied to all units. Hex damage is increased by 30% from the base damage per second, for 19 seconds.
- CB: No use in CB
- Arena - Getting Misaki to UB twice in a short period is the name of the game here, or at least getting her to apply her Curse and charm over the course of the fight. The DoT from them are incredibly powerful. However, the fact that even one missed Hex means you missed out on Curse & charm is a hard condition. A great offensive Arena option, Misaki is here to stay. 
- PvE: Similar to Aoi, her Hex/Curse is nice for the bosses that have ridiculous defenses and need DoTs to fight, like the Super Luna Tower gem boss. Outside of that, not too useful.
- Get farming her 8 nodes, as she'll want LB, max UE and max rank to work at peak efficiency for the Arena folk. Anyone else, skip her because she's worthless in any other mode. The bond stories do help ST.Misaki quite a bit.

## -> Chika <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, January 7th)
Not very useful as other supports are just more effective.
- UB+ gives a stronger heal. New additions are a P.Atk buff, 28% P.Crit damage and applies an HP Regen for 18.5s
- CB: A very outclassed physical support that has decent buffs from UB+, but shit skills and missing any sort of TP restoration/Barriers/TP Boost buffs
- Arena: Nothing to see for Arena, move on.
- PvE: Can be an okay poverty choice, but there are better options.
- Given the fact that she's in the clan coins shop, isn't used at all and there are better options - Just avoid using her and consider her once you have a lot of the other key 6 Stars.

Amazing support for physical comps, good thing side stories are a thing.
- UB+ now heals all units, but heals the lowest HP units for a larger amount. New additions are a p.def debuff for all enemies,  20% increase in P.Crit damage, TP Boost increase and P.Atk increase for all friendly units.
- CB: Incredibly useful in physical comps, as TP boost UB buffs generally are.
- Arena: Nothing to see for Arena, move on.
- PvE: Can be an okay poverty choice, but there are better options.
- Given the fact that she's in the clan coins shop, isn't used at all and there are better options - Just avoid using her.

## -> S.Kyaru<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, March 7th)
While able to push the soft cap, S.Kyaru's been made mostly irrelevant in the game by the fact that magic has better units.
- UB+ adds a m.def debuff and a new mechanic, where the condition is if the enemy is having its m.def reduced, it will take additional damage.
- CB: Can be decent in OF comps, but does not have a fit with the magic meta revolving around buffing each other, rather than being a stand-alone, selfish magic damage dealer (Unless you're GreAnne)
- Arena: Do not consider
- PvE: Can be a nice luxury piece in comps, but there are other, cheaper options to consider when building a team.
- Had a short stint in relevance, then shot down by changes and magic units being more focused around helping each other deal damage, being Neneka or GreAnne. A limited 6 Star that can only be purchased through the mater shop/adventure mode means that you can slowly farm her for fun.

Excellent physical multi-target damage unit that needs to tank.
- UB+ gives a slight increase in UB range and offers a p.atk buff to self based on damage dealt that is capped.
- CB: Can shine in very specific comps for physical mutli-target. Not always used because she needs to be tanking/surviving like Muimi, but is a good unit to have in the box to whip out.
- Arena: Not very useful, but can wipe teams that aren't prepared to stun her and cannot tank a 1st UB.
- PvE: Not terribly useful, but if you need multi-target damage - S.Peco can fill a good slot with some TP batteries/shields being provided to her.
- Has her niche usage, but a limited banner only unit and can only be farmed in master shop/adventure mode means that unless she's a meta-defining powerhouse, you need not rush her.

## -> Kuuka<- (JP Release Date: Year 5, April 7th)
Doesn't change much, aside from updating her to be a massive magic wall again. Still worse than Nozomi in most cases.
- UB+ grants a bigger shield, same HP restore value, but cuts incoming magic damage by 25%.
- CB: Not used, better tank options that have actual utility exist.
- Arena: Niche defensive tank comps that only work in P.Arena. Even then, those teams are not great. She can shut down Kyouka with a bit of support though.
- PvE: Can certainly help tank against damage with her consistent taunt, but really shines against magic damage. This is moreso relevant to story maps, not really other PvE Game modes
- Not a worthwhile unit unless you're getting ran over by single target magic damage.

## -> Rin <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, May 9th)
Mostly an Arena unit, there's no place for her in CB at this time.
- UB+: Grants a stronger P.atk buff, M.Def buff and the same heal value. New additions are +15 TP boost, increased P.Crit rate and HP drain effect (Same as Akari's UB).
- CB: No usage anymore.
- Arena: Has a good niche on defenses and offenses that require a quick M.def buff. Not terribly necessary, but nice to have in the roster.
- PvE: Can help in situations where a m.def buff and healing are required for physical units, but not necessary. 
- While +15 TP boost sounds incredible, Rin's only usage would be tanking for backline units. Maybe if a strong arsenal of backline physical units is amassed (She's in front of Laby) and she's right to tank, she'll see CB usage again. As for now, it simply isn't in the cards. Her Arena usage is strong enough to warrant a consideration, especially since she comes from dungeon.

## -> Miyako <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, June 6th)
If you hated Miyako before, you'll hate her even more now.
- UB+ gives her increased damage and a new permanent dodge increase.
- CB: Unless you're using her for a poverty 3rd team and need a tank that won't fold, just don't.
- Arena: Fantastic on different defenses and offenses, a must have if you're going to do Arena in some sort of serious capacity. Can 1v5 stall on defense against physical units by herself.
- PvE: Not very useful aside from the specific call-out in the "CB" section. This niche is a bit more useful in things like unlock quests, so long as it isn't magic damage.
- Miyako's just become better at what she did before, which is shut down physical damage and heal herself. If you can't CC her or tag her with magic damage, you're in trouble. Arena specialist by far.

## -> Misato <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, July 6th)
Has not seen any sort of relevant usage.
- UB+ does not change the values of her heal or m.def buff. New additions are a M.atk buff, M.Crit damage increase and an HP regen effect, 18s each.
- CB: Maybe low levels can make her work, but has not seen any sort of real useful usage. Bonds are useful for NY.Misato, who is used in CB.
- Arena: Can work in those super cheesy stall P.Arena comps, but not a staple by any means
- PvE: Similar to Rin except for magic units, but still just not worth anything. Positioned too far back to be a 1st position unit, as well.
- Mostly just a stat stick for NY.Misato at this time, at least she's easy to farm.

## -> Eriko <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, August 8th)
Reduced to an OF unit, because she only brings damage and nothing else.
- UB+: Increases damage and removes the "if target is killed" buff branch with a new "If target is not killed" buff branch. If her UB does not kill, she gains a 40% P.Crit damage buff. New effects are an increase in P.Crit damage taken by targets hit by her UB for 18s, a permanent P.Atk buff to self on each UB and her UB is split into two damage calculations. The last part is extremely important, because it means her UB can bypass the softcap of around 1.125m per UB, allowing for her to hit 2.25m UBs total.
- CB: Mostly seen in T3 or OF comps. Her time as a dominant CB physical unit has passed, mostly because comps require units to be absurdly strong and able to contribute more than just damage.
- Arena: A decent choice in arena against full tank teams, since she can buff herself to a point where she 1 taps them. Niche as heck though.
- PvE: Can do a decent job in clearing enemies with her huge buffs, but requires the team to be built around her.
- Eriko requires a team comp to be build around her to shine, but this isn't very promiment because of her only bringing damage. Her skills are pretty shit as well, especially now since her UB+ is the most effective buff she has. She has 7 farmable nodes, good luck. Her unlock quest will most likely require a tank + Ames to properly beat, like Miyako.

## -> Shinobu <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, September 7th)
Not a great unit so far. More of an arena unit, but very niche.
- UB+: Gives increased 150 range, damage. New effects are an action speed decrease by x65 of original value for 12s and a guaranteed fear for any unit hit by the UB.
- CB: Not useful for anything related to CB, unless you have no other choice.
- Arena: Can do a job in using her new UB+ to fear units, but her skills are useless. So unless you're building the team around her to get that UB off quickly, she struggles. Skull Dad also feeds the enemy TP by being fodder, which is never useful. P.Arena blind defenses help her usability though.
- PvE: 
- Other units just have better def down options and aren't stuck between being Arena/CB viable

No longer can crit herself to death, Ilya's got use now.
- UB+: Gives increased damage, increased HP restoration and gives her a stack of her S1+ mark (Buffing m.atk, up to 4 stacks on UB). New effect is that she now gains 50% reduced crit dmg from herself for 18s after every UB.
- CB: Can see some use against mutli-target bosses, but isn't very fitting compared to the staple MT magic damage units like Neneka, NY.Neneka, Ames, 
- Arena: Not seen in Arena as of late, probably because her skills suck and she's too far forward to kill anyone. 
- PvE: Great in EX5, especially Mode 1 of the boss since it has so many targets for her to crush. 
- A very nice unit to farm up for Dungeon bosses and has some niche FA/Set options for MT Magic damage comps. We'll see more of her once Wyvern Rider comes back, though there are higher damage comps. Add to your collection as 2 nodes permits, no rush.

## -> Tomo <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, October 5th)
Action speed buffs are amazing and Tomo's got one. She also does damage, unlike Monika.
- UB+: Increased damage by x2. New effects are that Tomo's buffs off UB are now applied to all units who are within 150 range of her, meaning she now grants Actions speed & P.Atk to teammates for 24s.
- CB: She has a similar role to Monika, where applying an Action speed buff overrides any debuffs previously given to your units. Can tank with support, but with Christina behind her in positioning, it has hampered her usage a bit.
- Arena: Not really useful.
- PvE: Excellent in dungeons, due to 6* stats, multi-target nature and team buffs. Can be a good piece in dungeon runs, SP comps and other areas.
- Although she cannot tank like Monika can in most situations, she's able to find her spots in team comps when needed so far. She's got 5 side story nodes & 1 hard node, so good luck farming her. She needs max UE too. As noted above, Christina meta means that Tomo would need her to not be usable in order to shine.

## -> Shefi <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, November 7th)
Niche self buffer that can buff P.Atk for all teammates within range.
- UB+: Increases damage, increased mark stacks from 10 to 20, counter stacks from 10 to 13 and increased gain in marks from 5 to 7 per UB. New effect is restoring TP to herself by 10 + number of marks (can go up to 30) if Shefi has her field up from S2, lasting 10.5s (100 TP, not affected by TP Boost). 
- CB: After a good few months, Shefi is left on the backburner due to her ramp up time and lack of use compared to other units. Most of her buffs are selfish, including the TP restoration. Can provide a very nice P.Atk buff and consistent damage from her though.
- Arena: Not an Arena unit, requires too much ramping up.
- PvE: A decent choice as a P.dmg attacker, but more useful in longer fights.
- As we've gotten more ridiculous physical units like Christina, Laby UE, Shefi's fallen off in favour of their utility and damage. She could still pop up in CB, but the chances of that aren't as high as before. She only has one node and her UE has TP boost on it, so she requires large investment to be primed for her time to shine.

## -> Mitsuki <- (JP Release Date: Year 5, December 7th)
A reliable debuff attached to her UB, probably a unit to keep an eye out for in the future.
- UB+: Doubles damage dealt and adds a new p.def debuff that is equal to Mitsuki's level +1. Still requires a kill to heal her for the 20% per kill. **Her UB+ debuff is applied before damage calculation, which seems to be a 1st.**
- CB: Due to having shit skills, Mitsuki is a walking UB that doesn't contribute anything to MT physical teams.
- Arena: Somewhat effective in Arena defenses, but nothing mind-blowing. Can get away with not having her, but good for some solutions on offense. Decent in blind P.Arena defenses/offenses with one of her alts, O.Mitsuki.
- PvE: A debuff is always welcome in PvE modes and various SP stages with her curse on S1+, but is still not amazing.
- Since Mitsuki is easy to farm, she's a welcome addition to a roster that is building towards more options, but not a must-have. Mostly for Arena.

## -> Jun <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, January 5th)
UB went from whatever to fantastic. When you need a tank, Jun is a good choice.
- UB+: Increases the barrier value to Jun. A new effect is that she spawns a field that buffs units P.Atk that are within the field. The range is 300 for the field. The field also increases action speed by 155%. This effect can stack with other action speed buffs.
- CB: Has seen some good usage against bosses that require a tank and in some OF comps, a solid choice overall.
- Arena: Not really  a good Arena unit, since her skills are not built for that mode. Maybe you can cheese out some wins with a 5 stack of tanks, but doubtful.
- PvE: Excellent pairing with physical teams for clearing fights that required an incredibly tanky 1st position unit with utility. 
- Jun has two nodes and 3 side stories that are definitely worth farming. A unit with two action speed buffs and a def down is pretty rare. Does nearly zero damage, so will be situationally good. Her range on UB+ may not be all encompassing, but it gets the job done.

## -> Ayumi <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, February 6th)
The bane of physical Arena comps is back and she's here to stay.
- UB: Deals increased damage, doubles the confusion duration from 4s to 8s, doubles the blind duration from 6s to 12s. New effects are a TP boost reduction by 50 for 12s, having a counter on UB that increases by 1 every time she UBs, capped at 3. This counter increase the UB damage done by the amount of counters she has.
- CB: She's not a CB unit, don't do it. CB bosses don't get CC'd.
- Arena: Probably the most obnoxious defense units to be released in the past few months, Ayumi pumps out so much CC that it's nearly impossible to fight her with a physical team. However, she does not do well into magic teams that can stop her antics. Like other CC, hers do not apply if the unit's barrier does not break from the damage.
- PvE: Similar to Io, she can use her blind and confusion can cause a disturbance in fights that would normally flatten units. 
- Comes from the dungeon shop, so if you're an Arena enthusiast - This is probably a girl you want to target. Outside of Arena, she is not useful. But so far, she's proven to be a thorn in the arena meta that won't be leaving any time soon. Bring magic damage and/or physical shields to her unlock quest, or get flattened.

## -> Christina <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, March 5th)
Ultimate Chris domination so far, welcome back. Another damage cap circumventor, you're gonna hear her UB voice line a lot.
- UB+: Splits her UB damage into two different damage calculations, allowing her to deal up to 2.2m damage on a single UB+. In addition, her UB+ now applies a p.def debuff.
- CB: Flattening single target bosses and dodging all of their attacks, Christina tank comps are back in a big way. Definitely a must-have 6* for any CB enthusiasts and we haven't even seen her against Goblin Great yet. Has somewhat warped the meta to revolve around how you can abuse her in 1st position, but that's also entirely boss dependent.
- Arena: Most likely not an arena unit, due to her lack of utility and inability to dodge magic damage. Maybe you can get some wins against full physical teams with an S.Misogi in front of her in P.Arena.
- PvE: Excellent overall, the devs are very aware of her dodging and clearly are attempting to balance around that. Super Luna Tower's a great example of her dominance.
- As expected, Christina has put her stamp all over the game in nearly all game modes. Dodge is a powerful mechanic and she shits out damage like no one's business, thanks to S1+. For anyone wondering, yes X.Christina is still relevant for that +3 TP. A difficult unlock quest compared to others, so grab some magic units and a Miyako. Priority 1 for master shop coins, as she needs max investment.

## -> Anna <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, April 5th)
She's a giant nuke now. Either she kills everyone, or she'll explode due to lose 100% of her defenses after UB.
- UB+ increased damage by nearly x5, no changes to reducing defenses by 100%. New addition is that she buffs her M.Atk for 8 seconds for a large amount.
- CB: Probably not suited for CB single target comps anymore, but could actually be a Multi-target damage dealer. Maybe could get used for a quick OF comp, but her going to 0 defenses means she instantly explodes to any damage after her 1st UB.
- Arena: Either she wipes 2+ units and explodes again, or you stall her out with m.def buffs like Yukari and generally tanky units. Pairs well with Yukari+ N.Io as an example. Saren also works in certain setups, but the goal is always the same - Get Anna to blow up the enemy team. Incredibly effective overall, so Arena players will want to add her to to the collection ASAP
- PvE: Not very suited for PvE, as they're usually damage sponges - The exact kind of unit that Anna is not good at dealing with. 
- Overall great in both Arenas on the defensive and offensive side. Think of Ninon, but on the magic side and stronger. CB is a pipe dream, maybe in some sort of wacky OF comp.

## -> Muimi<- (JP Release Date: Year 6, May 8th)
More damage with damage cap circumvent, a CC immunity and 6 Star stats means Muimi might make a return to her former glory..
- UB+: Gives Muimi a mark, giving her a complete immunity to stuns [as displayed in the Cygames demo](https://twitter.com/priconne_redive/status/1655407423233069057). The UB damage is now to all front enemies, instead of just the first one. She also receives an additional damage calculation on her SP1+ & SP2 if she has a mark, meaning these skills will be able to circumvent the damage cap.
- CB: While the demonstration was shit, Muimi's niche of tanking as 1st position, keeping her UB up and spamming her SP1+ > SP2 > SP1+  loop in UB form may return with an Ames and increased 6* stats behind her. Her biggest concern will always be to stay in UB form and not exploding while pumping out damage. Lots of bosses have ways to drain TP or don't give TP on their UBs, so that's something to keep in mind.
- Arena: Could see some P.Arena usage or niche Arena solutions like Chris, but most likely won't be a common unit. Being immune to CC certainly helps, but she does not dodge things like curse from Misaki and will still take damage.
- PvE: Absolutely destroys dungeons and stages where she can survive. Will most likely see usage in new content like SP dungeons and whatnot.
- With Twin Pigs this month, a physical 1st position unit that always want to take damage may also hold great value. With tons of barriers, TP gain and heals available to Muimi compared to when she was previously meta, don't be surprised to see her run over bosses that can't 1shot her. Maintaining her TP values should be easier with stuff like X.Miyako, Laby, Ames. Similar to how GreAnne require the team built around them, Muimi will most likely need a team built around her. For Auto players, Muimi is very auto friendly due her UB draining instead of needing to be re-activated constantly. She does get charmed and knocked back, despite her CC immunity.

## -> Yuki <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, June 6th)
More CC, tankiness and an interesting way to let his charm land more consistently, sort of. A decent threat in arena, moreso than before.
- UB+: Increases damage by roughly 400%, doubles his P.Def down. New additions are a 4s charm to any damage enemies and his UB converting to physical damage if a unit's P.def is lower than its magic defense. If not, it stays as magic damage.
- CB: If ever, his near full TP restore S2 combined with his P.def down on UB+ could be somewhat useful in multi-target comps for physical teams. That's a fairly large IF, because his S1+ is completely worthless, since blinds don't work on bosses. 
- Arena: His role has not change too much, but just does actual damage with his UB+. Can make tank fights tip in your favour, as his TP restoration, shred, charm and ability to hit on the weaker defense side means that he now does damage. 
- PvE: Most likely has a place where Io would, since his Charm will allow you to cheese fights by not having enemies attack you. Could be useful in LT/Nodes players are having difficulty with. A borrowed Yuki could certainly help with backline targetting enemies, as his new tankiness will absorb blows.
- Unless KMR has a hard on for Yuki, we probably won't see him in CB. He'll continue to be an Arena character as he always has been, but with more firepower overall. He's got 8 nodes to farm, so not a bad choice for arena players who are looking for a good 6*. If nothing else, his bond stories will be nice for Ooedo Yuki, who never truly dies.

## -> Tsumugi <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, July 7th)
More damage and increased CC on UB+, but nothing else. Potentially some defense usage initially, but underwhelming.
- UB+: Increased damage and increased bind effect from 2.5s to 4s. New addition is that the damage gets an 0.5 x # of targets modifier.
- CB: Just don't, this is an Arena unit. 
- Arena: With an increased bind time and more damage, Tsumugi could be an asset on teams that need to eat some damage and bite back with a hit. Usually against the Natsune/NY.Homare explosion teams. The ability to pull backline units forward to make AOE land when it normally wouldn't is a nice edition, but that 1st action is slower than the majority of all 1st position CC teams (Ex. Kasumi, S.Misogi, Inori, Mifuyu, Monika). Probably helps out in P.Arena defenses for the most part, where an ill-prepared team will eat binds constantly and shuffle positions of units with UB+.
- PvE: Might be of some use to tank and bind for your squishier teammates, but certainly not the most effective strategy. We have seen summer Tsumugi yank the further target back in things like Luna Tower or Super Luna Tower, so 6 Star Tsumugi could pop up there. Extremely niche usage at best.
- They didn't add much aside from some more damage, the extra 1.5s of bind time is nice for stalling out enemies. Not a meta breaker, but could be a nice add. Until people start figuring out how to deal with her, then she may fall off a cliff. Arena meta always shakes and turns, so she may find a good spot if her damage is enough to break barriers and consistently land her bind.

## -> Matsuri<- (JP Release Date: Year 6, August 7th)
From the most useless unit in the game to a potential niche, there's certainly some hope for Matsuri. Not a lot though.
- UB+: Increased range from 300 to 450 for damaged units. New additions are a Magic & Physical shield on UB and a buff to the damage and shield based on missing HP.
- CB: Just don't, this is an Arena unit. If you need more explanation, just read her skills as a whole.
- Arena: A good choice in comps where you may need to re-direct attention for skills that land on the clostest target and hit within a certain range to mess then up (Ex. Saren 6 Star UB), but her 1st action a simple damage skill from S2 means that her usage comes from being a counter punch after taking hits. This is doubled down on, because her UB gives her shields and damage based on missing HP. Certainly could be a threat in P.Arena comps, but on the defensive side for the most part. Especially given her natural bulk and deceptive survivability from shields.
- PvE: Unless you need to attract some skills towards a single unit to avoid the rest of your party getting hit, Matsuri has no real usage. This could be something in the future, but certainly not now.
- Positioning and pulling targeting towards herself to protect her team has always been Matsuri's only strength, but now she actually has the ability to tank hits and survive to make use of it. This doesn't maker her a meta breaker, but she will certainly see usage in prolonged fights where she can either run a train on the backline squishies or soak up damage for her teammates to avoid taking damage.

## -> Makoto <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, September)
Similar to Rei's unique buff, her UB gives her a timed mark that improves her S1+ & S2. Definitely worth keeping your eyes on. because she's a shred specialist.
- UB+: Damaged increased by a large amount, shred increased by a large amount. New Mark system ads a mark to Makoto after UB for 18s, that enhances her S1+ & S2:
		S1+: If Makoto has a mark, damage is doubled and her P.Atk buff is increased by base x 8.
		S2: If Makoto has a mark, shred values is increased by 25%
- CB: Most likely going to see some usage, but also is positioned far forward enough that she will need some support as a pos 1 unit or needs a tank like X.Jun or Muimi to eat hits for her. However, the amount of shredding and damage she does is more or less unmatched as a full package against a single target. If defenses go up for bosses, Makoto may start to work her way into a staple position. With increased stats from 6 star, she may no longer suffer from her problem of exploding to damage.
- Arena: Could do decently into tanky teams that don't do a lot of damage, but most definitely an extremely niche character for any sort of Arena usage.
- PvE: Similar to CB, she will get used as boss defenses go up.
- Overall, Makoto's role highly depends on how much shred is required in fights, with balancing damage and survivability. We may see her start out as an OF/CO unit due to the high amount of shred she has on UB alone, but there is certainly an opportunity for her to return to the heights she used to reach in the past.

## -> Kasumi <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, October)
Kasumi was great in arena before and just gets better with this 6*. 
- UB+: Increased range on field that shreds and lowers TP Boost, alongside 20% more Action speed reduction. New effects include changing the TP Boost number to 0 and damaging units after 5s.
- CB:  No real usage scenarios for the moment, mostly because all her other skills are useless against bosses. Unless you are going to need a massive def down, probably will not be seen.
- Arena: Here's where Kasumi shines. Her CC and def down have always been incredibly useful, but the the buffs and TP boost reduction to 0 mean she's got more tools in order to to help in elongated fights. Her Pos 1 slot snare still loses out to Inori/Mifuyu/S.Misogi in terms of 1st action snare, but the increased tankiness helps a lot in surviving fights to continue dishing out CC and debuffs.
- PvE: Decent option for CC on your magic teams, but not really necessary. 
- An Arena terror, but she always was. It's just that now in the lead slot and others, she can continue to pump out CC and actually deal damage.

## -> Shiori <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, November)
She's finally got hope, but how often will she realistically get to UB?
- UB+: Increased damage dealt, increased perma P.Atk buff. New effects include two separate damage calculations on UB+, each of which now debuff.
- CB: If there is somewhere that Shiori should be seen, it would be CB. Having a backliner that can pump out  consistent damage, debuffing and buffing self while having a lot of TP restoration to self means that Shiori will be able to UB more often than most other backline physical units. She'll most likely see usage against single target bosses, but it'll be completely about her UB landing every few actions. Other units can help her with the less than stellar P.Crit stats, but there are quite a few units to help support her in this department. 
- Arena: Probably not worth it, she's pure damage and not terribly tanky. Not going to eat hits and dish out damage, more likely to simply explode.
- PvE: See above.
- Archers are notorious for being shit, especially because of buff ranges. However, there is a certain boss in November that could mean we see Shiori do well. Other than that, it really becomes a question of how unusable the likes of Christina/Muimi/Djeeta and other frontline units become against certain bosses. in the future. When that does happen, Shiori will be a good consideration for comps. With quite a few nodes, is not terribly difficult to farm the shards for her.

## -> Inori <- (JP Release Date: Year 6, December)
Another unit that was good in Arena before, but this just helps her even more as a 1st position unit.
- UB+: Increased UB damage. New effects include her burn damage increased based on her P.Atk, increasing her P.Atk & P.Crit Rate permanently 
- CB: Most likely will not see any usage here. Short version is that she offers nothing to anything relevant to CB bosses, unless we need to use burn damage one day.
- Arena: Inori has one of the fastest stuns in the game, but was fairly squishy and offered a bit less when compared to other units. Now that her UB+ gives her an opportunity to apply burn and get stronger of the course of longer fights, she'll pose a massive threat outside of simply being a stun/knocback bot, or just a "win the 1st action" unit. These kind of DOTs ignore defensive stats typically, so she'll be a great choice into tanky units as well. Inori has been meta since UE release, so this is simply expanding on her usage.
- PvE: Unless burn damage is required for a fight, won't see too much usage outside of maybe Dimensional Luna Tower comps. 
- Like Kasumi before her, Inori's importance in the Arena metas will only grow. Depending on how tanky she can get from other units and her 6 star stats, she will certainly become a defensive staple and potentially a wall breaker for tankier units. So long as they're not shielded of course, but there are ways of dealing with shields. Very scary unit to deal with. Reminder that she has TP Boost on her UE, so you'll need to farm that up.
