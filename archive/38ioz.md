Messenger of Hatred

She waited in a green clearing in the middle of nowhere, and it was getting cold. Maybe she wondered if it was just a prank, if that message about a grave danger for all of mankind coming from beyond this world was false, but she patiently looked up, waiting for signs of anything unusual to come. She was told by a suspicious message to wait there, and curiosity took over her.
Why did she accept this message and come there, to this otally-not-an-obvious-ambush? Maybe she just wanted the thrill of risk, or she was just that naive? She didn't really know, she was too buy contemplating the ominous red star that shone on the night sky, alone and alien to the firmament.
As she wondered if the mysterious light was a bad sign, suddenly a crimson ray appeared by her side, and before she could even jump in surprise, a large figure materialized, resembling a mechanical man with angelic wings covered in blood.
After the initial shock in this unexpected appearance, a voice, warm and incredibly human, brought her back to reality.

"Are you the Setsuna Reiko that I've been contacting?" She had been talking with someone over the internet, a friendly and weird stranger to which she made a roleplay, acting like he was some sort of alien who knows nothing about humanity. She added things up, and came to a revelation.

"Y-you are Razor? The whole "alien RP" site is true? Are you... An alien?" She couldn't believe her demonic eyes, she was the leader of a group of demon hunters using infernal powers to fight the supernatural forces, but speaking to an extraterrestrial intelligence was too much even for her.

"Yes." He removed his helmet, showing his handsome face (Completely indistinguishable from a regular human) and making Reiko almost pass out from excitement.

"T-this is incredible! Pinch me and tell me I'm not dreaming!" She was too euphoric, her curiosity was too much, especially when she noticed something that made her eyes sparkle: This alien had a demonic aura just like her!

"I'm afraid that you're not in a dream, but in a nightmare. Your world is in great danger, and I've come to help you. My name is Razor Tesfonn, and I'm here to stop the imminent destruction of your world."
Reiko composed herself, quickly returning to reality to listen to Razor's warning. "And you've arrived directly to me. Why?"

"I just sensed that you have something more than what meets the EYE." Reiko flinched at the emphasis on the "eye" part, and realized that he had not just an aura, but also eyes: He was exactly like her colleagues. Probably his eyes must've been powerful if he could sense her special power from space.

"And what is your warning, space man?" She barely contained herself, she was too eager to listen to his story.

"Once upon a time, I was a king of an almighty empire that spanned across the constellations, the echoes of my conquest could be heard to the edges of the galaxy, when she arrived.
You call her Orihime, the Star Crossed Lover, the girl who was separated from her lover and banished to the stars. She gathered an army of cybernetic soldiers and in her mad quest to find her lost lover she ravaged countless planets, scouring them and destroying their stars.
My empire tried to stop her, but everything I love was destroyed in her crusade. I am the last warrior from my world, and in my mission to avenge my world I gathered the souls of my brothers into my body, and made a desperate, infernal pact, awakening a new power in my soul.
Now, with this demonic force by my side I've managed to anticipate the Lover and I've arrived here to ask for your help. An invasion is coming, and no one is safe."

They continued the discussion, talking about his past, the upcoming threat, and the role that Reiko would have in saving Earth. Of course, the demon hunter organization was mentioned.

"Let's make an accord, Razor. Your powers could be very useful for my organization. What if you stay with us for a while, until the Lover's invasion is defeated, and help us with dealing with... other issues?"
"And what will I get in exchange?"
"The death of your mortal enemy isn't enough?"
"I can accept that, human."

"Well, therefore from now on I declare you a member of the Demon Hunters! May your kills be many and quick, and may your eyes always show you the truth!"

It was a the end of a short, cold day, the sky looked like a painting, with strokes of clouds and orange lights on a red background, and only few stars littered the air above the countryside of Yakura, a small village in the outskirts of Tokyo. On the top of an hill a few men were celebrating, dancing around a bonfire and singing weird tribal songs. They wore furs and their bodies were covered in tattoos, and the sounds coming from their mouths resembled guttural howls more than words. As the sun retreated behind the mountains, a huge, silver, full moon took its place, and they greeted its spectral apparition screaming at the top of their lungs twisting and turning their arms. The men's forms were turning more and more warped in a crescendo of roars, until they were fully turned into hulking wolfmen. Their howls signaled their lost humanity and their terrible intentions: In a moment they would descend upon the nearby town, wrecking anything around them and feasting on its inhabitants' flesh. But as they started running towards the lights of civlization, a red lightning stopped them into their tracks.
A loud boom heralded the arrival of Razor, who crashed right in front of the beastly horde looking like a scarlet angel of retribution. Upon sight of the intruder, many werewolves lunged at him, but suddenly, with a red glint, they stopped again, shaking and petrified. The others tried to run, but Razor blitzed in front of them.
"Where do you think you are going, you filthy beasts? Your miserable life has gone on for too long."
One of them clawed at the red knight, but he just grabbed it by the arm before tearing it from its body without breaking a sweat. The beast's howls of pain sounded like music to the alien's ears, who laughed maniacally before grabbing it by the neck and slowly holding it tighter and tighter, until the dying creature's twitches of pain eventually stopped.
"Who's next?" Razor's voice sounded like he was having the time of his life. "Any volunteers?"
The biggest wolf in the pack lunged at razor, trying to pounce on him with his crushing weight, but it could do nothing as Razor punched through him in mid-air, ripping his still beating heart out of his chest.
What happened to the other terrified monsters was a massacre: One had its skin torn apart, others got vaporized into red mist with a single punch, some were decapitated and burnt to ashes, until only two of them still remained.
"Let's make a pact. I will spare the one who will kill the other in a duel..."
Before he could finish the sentence the two surviving beasts charged at each other, brutally fighting to gain a chance to live. They slammed each other on the ground, they clawed, they bit, until in the end one fell lifeless while the other, covered in wounds, barely stood up, panting and dripping blood.
When it started limping away from Razor however, he let out a loud laugh and grabbed it by a shoulder.
"Did you really think that I would come to terms with a disgusting beast like you? When I meant that I'd spare you, I meant that I would spare you from a long and torturous death, instead you will have the privilege to witness my true power!"
Suddenly, the last werewolf was chained and powerless, unable to do anything but look up, when it saw that one of the stars was slightly bigger.
"Great chorus of the astral ocean! Heed my call! May the shining justice of your flames smite down my enemy! COSMOWRATH ANNIHILATION!"
The last thing the werewolf saw was a light brighter than a thousand suns as the astral ray came from the heavens to utterly annihilate it. A persistent lightning of hatred, that didn't leave anything of its victim, not even the ashes.
"That did feel good. Time to report to Reiko."
Razor spread his nanotech wings before soaring into the night sky, resembling a crimson meteor, and returned to the Demon Eyes HQ that became his new home. He landed on the roof, removed his mech-suit, and descended back to his bedroom. A screen showed the countdown to the beginning of Orihime's invasion, and he added today's hunt to the list of completed missions, writing the kill count with red ink. "I'm starting to like this new role." He remarked.
