So guys, what's your stance on "Doom" transformation? I.e humans becoming demons (which we saw directly in "Doom 3" in particular, like the Commando cut-scene). 

\>Demon puts penis into human mouth
\>Human swallows a ton of sperm
\>The more he consumes, the more transformed he gets
\>New demon created

\>demon integration happens
\>you get a mortally challenged bf
\>doom eternal happens
\>people are getting killed, humans are now mere prey
\>your bf wants to keep you safe
\>go into hiding, give him blowjobs constantly
\>a few days later, you're a demonic version of yourself
\>you look pretty lit actually
\>your voice is a bit weird but you can at least speak demonic
\>other demons see you as their own

\>\>Demon puts penis into human mouth
BAH, needs more female demons! 

Well theoretically fucking a demoness could result in demon transformation too. 

-----

\>male summoner
why is this allowed 

because they're total twinks 

\>he doesn't like male Summoners
Wow look at this total homo. 

Male summoners are the best. Floating bondage twinks, what more could you ask for? 

This.
I want to become Lord of Hell and have a harem of cute floaty boys. 

And a little bit of the Bara boys if I get bored. 

Big fat demon cock, just begging to be worshipped forever. The best possible afterlife. 

Theory. Knights are Dominant, Barons are Submissive. 

I like this theory. So you'd be getting your ass rammed by a knight while you rim a Barons fat sweaty pucker. Yes please. 

Nah, considering their characterisation in 2016, with HKs posing and taunting more often they're not nearly as dominant as the Barons who act like they own the place
However power bottom Barons are 110% acceptable, especially if they degrade and humiliate the sub 

-----

Honestly to me, the best version of a Cacodemon would be like the original design.....but with a custom and unnatural mouth made to be the perfect simulator of cock. Akin to a floating, living fleshlight. 

Stimulator of cock, correction. The demon can even adjust the size of its mouth for a variety of shaft sizes. Unsurprisingly, Cacodemons are complete sluts. 

Cacodemons use absurdly strong pheromones to weaken human hesitance about being blown by them. Then they get in close. The mouth interior is lined like silk and always as slick as KY. The tongue is hyper-flexible, and the teeth can retract into the gums when needed. Through demonic power, they can make their mouths smaller or larger as necessary.
But once they get a cock in their mouth, it's pretty much impossible for them to not get the sperm they desire. They are the ultimate givers of head, and they'll pleasure a shaft until the male literally can't hold his sperm in any longer. 

Their eye is hyper-sensitive, capable of picking up and processing multiple spectrums simultaneously. This allows them to find shafts to pleasure quite easily.
Their saliva has a double-function. It acts as an aphrodisiac (getting absorbed into the skin of the shaft being pleasured), as well as a sperm-production booster. The "victim" 's balls will swell up to maximum capacity with as much semen as possible. 

I'm going to assume they milk tea "victim" for hours at a time, until even they cannot extract any more cum. 

Pretty much. They leave the balls completely and thoroughly drained. It's why Cacodemons are solitary. Greed for sperm.

You'd better have a HUGE dick, anon.

Typically when a Cacodemon's mouth gets really big, it's going for a Cyberdemon. 

-----

gay demons best demons 

Indeed. Especially if they pull some closeted human into their web of hedonism. 

only if they make me lick their bodies clean 

Well, the Cyberdemons have their own harems of gay submissive humans so they're always game for more. 

(Incidentally that's something I wish "Doom" porn would explore more. The humans who sexually service demons in their respective territories. When the demons got unleashed, they found a lot of subby humans to bring into their harems). 

I don't mean like evil humans BTW. They're just submissive sluts who have figured out demons make the best doms.

I'm getting pre-emptively annoyed.

I wonder if hellknights like to cuddle 

https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1534/96/1534966579283.png
Yes.

He's beautiful. I want to hug him and kiss his boney eyeplates and love him forever. 

-----

\>The Cyberdemon entered the portal last, and surveyed his new domain with great pleasure
\>Almost a year of work had come to an end
\>He looked around
\>A shameless scientist was fucking a Cacodemon from behind, moaning wildly
\>Another scientist was sandwiched between two Imps, enjoying their new human
\>A two-headed demon was blowing two marines at the same time
\>And before the Cyberdemon, multiple humans were pleasuring his shaft with abandon
\>It was a paradise of hedonism. All the humans on the planet were the sex-slaves of the demons. The Cyberdemon had every intention of keeping things exactly the way they were now.
\>The Cyberdemon turned around, and fired his arm cannon at the portal control. The gates to hell sealed behind him, cementing his betrayal of his masters. Better to rule on Mars then serve in Hell.

Very yes. Next Mars starts up a sex tourism business with Earth. Get your Argent Energy via demonfucking. Or maybe the new ruler of Mars demands continuing tribute in the form of more Martian "colonists" or he shuts off the power to earth. 

Mars pretty much becomes the demons' playground. They run it like a sexual paradise, quite deliberately.
The better to lure in more humans from Earth, which is far more sexually repressed. When Mars offers sex tourism, they get quite a few new humans to add to their harems.
Cut off from and essentially independent of Hell (as well as interacting with humans a lot more), the Mars Demons form their own society. Demons are on top, but the humans are quite happy and hedonistic servants. 


Because the demons have full control over Mars (all portals, etc.) and leverage over Earth via they have all the Argent energy, they're soon able to reach an arrangement with Earth. They'll continue to send Argent energy to Earth in exchange for humanity leaving Mars to the Demons and their human allies/sex-slaves.
The cultural exchange flows both ways. The humans on Mars adapt fast to the new hedonism, while the Demons there become far more sophisticated than their counterparts in hell.
Monogamy is replaced by a harem system, with multiple humans for each demon. 

I mean as long as I wasn't actual property and was a servant I'd be on that ship to Mars in a heartbeat. Find myself a handsome summoner or something to serve and live the good life. 

Although they have harems, the humans on Mars aren't considered property. They're basically partners-in-crime, assimilated into the culture of Demon-run Mars.
The harem system is mainly to keep things manageable to a degree. 

I imagine their is fierce competition to be the Top Human of a harem. Is it totally unheard of for a demon to only take one human as a partner or simply seen as very strange for demons? 

Typically it's unusual for just one human to be taken. But some humans rank higher than others in harems. They actually get to share the demon's bed, rather than sleep next to him. 

Using a lot of imported material from Earth, the Demons gradually turn Mars into a series of interlinked sexual facilities. Orgy rooms, harem areas, mass gloryhole spots, pleasure battery concentrations, intimate one-on-one bedrooms for special personal rewarding, etc. 

What are the general kinks or depravities of each kind of demon? Summoners into BDSM, Mancubi into foodplay, Imps into gangbangs. That sort of thing.
I need to know what kind of demons harem I'm going to enter and rise to the top of. 

The Demons are like humans. Individual tastes vary. You're bound to find a Mars Demon to your liking. 

This is my new favorite AU. 

-----

I'd want small tops and big bottoms. I get off on the irony. Get mounted by an Imp, mount a Baron, etc. I'd kinda be half and half with the Cyberdemon. I'd do the pleasuring but be subby about it. 

\>your baroness mistress will never make you fucker he while her imp slave has his way with you
\>she will never call you a pathetic whelp as he nuts inside you

-----

Would you rather sexually service a Demon from Mars or Hell? They look the same but have spent time in different environments.
I imagine Mars' Demons are more civilized. 

I'll take Mars any day. Less animalistic, but more open to communication and having sex with me and not just using me as a living sex toy. Preferred demon pictured. 

I love the idea of Demons on Mars forming a separate culture from the environment they came from. They learn a lot of stuff from humanity, including sexual concepts. 

I want a baron to fuck me on a bed of coals 

Keep the coals, but same. Barons are fucking hot. Towering pillars of inhuman strength and raw sex appeal. Impossible masculinity and virility. They could fuck you for days at a time. And they will, if you let them. 

Hell Demons are a lot more brutal and primal when it comes to sex. Very rough and mean.
It's not an accident the two groups don't speak the same language anymore. The Mars Demons are in a much more pleasant environment.

I wonder what demoness milk is like. Probably slick and lewd in texture, yet sugary sweet. 

Oh shes cute. 

She's $666 an hour honey, got enough to pay to sin with the best? 

I'll take out a loan. I want 6 solid hours of that demon ass in my face right the hell now 

https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1534/98/1534989814778.jpg
Reminder

I'm kinda surprised Size Difference porn isn't more common in "Doom" stuff. Like a bunch of humans sexually servicing the same hell knight. 

Im well aware. I want to see how far my face can go inside her.
Pussy and ass. 

\>implying she'd let your pathetic mortal flesh anywhere near her perfect immortal warrior body

I mean this is assuming I'm paying her. 

who said you could pay for full service?
$666 is only the starting fee, look but don't touch, if you touch yourself you're straight outta there.
I know these high level hellspawn may be tempting but are you sure you couldn't settle for something more economical? 

Are you kidding me? Look at her!
She's fiery damnation given smoking hot form. She is the unliving embodiment of raw sex! What other demon could compare?
I'd buy a few hours a week and hope she eventually decides to play with me on her own.
If not, what are the other options and pricing options and what do you recommend? 

Cacodemons are probably cheapo sluts. 

True, but due to their round, bulbous form they are not widely popular. They lack much in the way of eroticism and are more of a niche appeal.
Perhaps Pinkies are more up your alley? Purely bestial in form but fully ecstatic in action, you'd be a fool to miss out!

Pinkies seem like they'd be real hump-sluts, capable of going on for hours and hours on end. 

beware, the cheaper ones may not clean out well beforehand. Luckily we ensure all our She-Devils are up to SSS regulation. Safe-Sanitary-Satanic!

\>due to their round, bulbous form they are not widely popular
You stupid bitch. 

The newer UAC forms are harder to employ these days. They see their now bodies as 'liberating' and freely waste their services on anyone available. As you can understand this makes it harder for them up uphold our SSS policies

second choice? Lets go with a hell knight of either gender, then third would be a summoner also of either. 

Wonderful choices! Hellknights have all the ferocity of Barons but less aftercare. I hope you're ready for their forcefulness, but it is their most popular attribute.
Summoners are less brutal and more erotic. Very teasing and seductive but give them (male or female) enough encouragement and you can make them melt 

Alright what are the pricing ranges of Summoners and do you have any special treatments or recommendations? 

Well 300 starting to 700 full service
However if you wish to have them summon others during their service you will have to pay full price beforehand and magical services will not be available while restrained 

Magical services? I'm intrigued what are those. 

Conjurations or various demons for services, as well as fortune telling, hypnotism and vision journeys

No anon, that would be too easy. You must live a life of sin and debauchery and earn your demon husband.

Why are Barons so hot?

Because that dick is going to find out just how deep you can take it.

-----

\>You wake up in his embrace, wrapped in his wings, his mandible-like chin gently pushing into your head.
\>Now, Summoners are fairly mannerly demons, so tightly hugging his human bf doesn't necessarily get him sweaty and going.
\>But he can't really help himself with the... morning... problem.
\>He gets all embarassed about his stiff member rubbing on you - disregarding that the exact same thing is happening to you.
\>Sleepily muttering that it's okay, you slowly and lightly start frotting with him.
\>Not too much to get anywhere too heated nor it to be considered edging. Just some mild fun with an occasional shiver of pleasure.
\>For the next half hour, quiet grazing against the blanket and soft gasps from the Summoner are the only sounds you hear.

aight lads, which one do we pick, lLoyal tight hell baron ass or huge hot cyberdemon ass

\>Loyal tight hell baron ass
everyone knows barons are size queen powerbottoms 

Nah, he's the imposing commander, watching you from above on his throne, dictating your actions. He might seem brutish and apathetic at first, but he appreciates loyalty and honourable manners. Do as he says, and you'll soon build a strange but positive relationship, with him treating you with a certain respect. You're just a small human and he knows it, so he's much more forgiving of honest mishaps and is willing to let you learn how to properly service him. For a cold leader of Hell, he has a way too warm gaze in his eyes as he looks down at you during servicing while gently stroking your cheeks with his claw. 

I may be in love

HELLO FOURCHAN
I AM GLAD YOU THINK WE ARE ATTRACTIVE

Imagine being the lucky guy who volunteers to help these women with their demon-cock research.

Your job is to help maintain a constant output of demonic fluids. However the Head Researcher will be responsible for the actual extraction. You must keep the subject titillated and aroused as long and often as possible. You are given free reign of the subjects body and have the full use of Argent Technologies Sextoy Devision at your disposal.
Get to work.

I can't help but wonder....who is really in charge of that room? The humans or the huge-cock demon?

Does it matter?

-----

What do you like about demons?

The overall designs, probably. I don't know why, I just love how they look in general, so I guess that's a severe case of teratophilia, eh?
In the AU from the /aco/ threads, I also like the Mars residents' disillusion or epiphany of Hell, them turning from bloodthirsty monsters to nice beings. But then I realise it's pretty weird because that's like liking a concentration camp guard after they realise they were evil. Like, no shit. I don't know, it's weird.

No I feel you. I like the Aco threads myself. I love the idea of demons living among humans and just being like "shit this was an option the whole time? This is awesome!" My only little bit of headcanon is that the demons stay on model for the most part. None of that generic monstergirl shit. Or monsterboy for that matter.

\>regularly engage in homosexual acts 'cause its both a sin and its fun
I remember a line in one of the doom novels that had someone ask why demon statues were sculpted with hung, erect cocks.

  \>Hell invasion happens.
  \>You're not slaughtered, instead, you wake up in Hell.
  \>At first, you're being prepared for some gorification and being turned into a living dissected cadaver.
  \>But the demons are pretty damn hot, so you offer them different uses for your soul and body.
  \>They accept.
  \>They try you a couple of times right there, mostly Imps and an overseering Archvile.
  \>While a bit rough and leaving you sore, they're not really brutish. You don't feel pain, so that's nice.
  \>After that, they let you go to wander around with the mark of an unkillable.
  \>Your body is somewhat strengthened so that the abrasive nature of Hell doesn't kill you.
  \>Exploring the arcane dimension is like a slightly hardcore trip.
  \>Oftentimes, you pass by other demons. And oftentimes, they (in a rather unquestioning way) ask to have fun with you. It's not like you can say no.
  \>Nothing like a quick fuck with anything from an Imp to a Hell Knight against a cold and sharp rock or an obsidian pillar of a blood temple.
  \>After satisfying themselves with you, they even reward you a bit by licking a wound or two you had before finding them, their infernal saliva healing those who are cursed. You're not immortal after all.
  \>Having explored the areas closest to you, you've become aware of several interesting-looking landmarks where you can choose to go next:
  \>1) The Blood Keep, from which a Baron commands the local forces.
  \>2) The Crimson and Obsidian Temple, place of dark worship for the more spiritual residents like Archviles and Summoners.
  \>3) A cave that looks at least a bit inviting, certainly enough for a pack of Imps to settle inside.
  \>4) The Sinew Pits, an ancient arena and training grounds for Hell Knights.
  \>5) Keep wandering.
Dunno why I'm giving choices here and why I wrote almost to the 2k character limit, I just had an idea of expanding the Anon's idea of demons having casual sex in Hell.

  \>You approach the cave, a campfire and lots of movement around it visible from afar.
  \>You're quickly swarmed by the pack of Imps, the fast and agile kind.
  \>At first, it's because they see a harmless-looking walking meat, but then they notice your mark.
  \>So instead, there's a lot of non-sexual groping and 'hi's and 'welcome's as they almost carry you to the cave.
  \>Having someone like you is very useful. Sure, you're not good at hunting, but from a purely practical view, you're great at discouraging bigger demons from attacking the clan.
  \>You become a strange part of the pack pretty quickly.
  \>You do general helping out stuff - keeping the fire alive, preparing the food (they might live in a cave but they don't eat meat raw like savages), tending to the wounded (soft and nimble five-fingered hands are really useful here), that sort of thing.
  \>And, of course, since you have the ever-present and omnipotent mark of the unhurtable and lustful, some other ways to help out the pack.
  \>Since the nights are cold, Imps sleep in big piles of warm flesh to preserve warmth and for an occassional grope or moan.
  \>With you there, it often gets more heated and at least once a night you're woken up by an Imp tightly hugging you in a less than platonic way.
  \>Other times individuals or small groups from the pack approach you directly during the day.
  \>If it's in a public space, other Imps who don't have too much work on their hands join in as well.
  \>Sex is a fairly common sign of gratitude too, except more relaxed and with the Imps being more cuddly and submissive towards you.
  \>And again, that ranges from individuals you've healed and saved the lives of or the entire pack after overseeing the cooking of a particularly good dinner.
  \>Fun fact: For some reason, bacteria don't exist in Hell. What's the source of bad breath? You've guessed it. Most Imps ironically have better teeth than many humans. Did you know that they like to kiss you a lot? They taste of spicy roasted meat.
TBC?

  \>Even though most Imps in the pack are very similar to each other, they're obviously all unique.
  \>One of the ways to quickly distinguish them is clothing.
  \>Most only wear rags with runes, probably "borrowed" from a nearby temple.
  \>It doesn't really serve to cover them up, more for them to have a multitool at hand.
  \>But there's one who wears a... hoodie?
  \>Yeah, looks like it. Grey, stylish, with a full hood and not too rough holes for spikes.
  \>Apparently he once found a dead human with his clothes lying around during a scout watch in the coldness of night.
  \>He doesn't wear anything else and usually leaves it unzipped, so his slim body is uncovered at all times - and don't forget that he has no underwear nor pants.
  \>He's still more of a scout and less of a hunter as he's more knowledgeable about the surrounding areas, even all the way to the borders with Kadingir and the Stone Taigas.
  \>You like talking with him, sharing knowledge - he tells you of some of the culture and interesting places around while you acquaint him with human ways and culture.
  \>Just like you're surprised about seas of semiliquid sulphur, he's blown away by tales of giant oceans of water.
  \>He's not that talkative, especially when working on something like sharpening a spear, but he's really friendly when he does engage in bigger chat with you.
  \>You accompany him to low danger recon missions during calm times, which is mostly an excuse for a cuddly fuck on top of a high rock, where it's only you two and the howling wind.
  \>Other times, you sneak out to the depths of the home cave and have fun there, his glowing eyes the only your light source.
  \>He's not really a bottom; quite the contrary, but he's very gentle while playful and nagging.
  \>For a member of such a communal race, he sure likes to cuddle with you alone afterwards in his soft, fuzzy hoodie.
  \>Once, you got startled by a sudden feeling of teeth on your neck before realising he's gently nibbling on you without hurting you.
  
\>Delicate neck nibbling
muh dick

https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1537/87/1537872110548.jpg
What demon would you want to do this to. For me it's definitely a massive Barron, dripping with sweat and musky enough to addict you to him.

he certainly looks sweaty and musky there. I want to lick him clean!

You would make an adequate servant

The air around him is so warm and humid it would put you to comforting sleep. If it wasn't for the pheromones that make your hormones go wild.

That's my perfect level of musk. So thick that it forms it's own environment.

Hell Knight.

What do you like about then so much you want to worship ones ass and have him fuck you into Oblivion?

Think it's the build mainly. They project strength. Also they're that right mix of humanoid but still demon.

Good taste. I'd happily rim any demon I could honestly.

I wouldn't mind a slimm and agile demon either, like an Imp, Archvile, Summoner or a Prowler.

-----

Is such a thing as a submissive Baron personal bodyguard bf possible in DOOM canon.
Hell Knight is good too.

I could see it happening. A Baron that was a sub all his life but had to hide it to survive in hell. He gets to Mars and goes absolutely crazy with the freedom to finally submit.

In actual canon, I imagine the demons would act like they have no personality, only obeying commands and silently despising the human. In the AU however, sure, why not. It would be mostly Hell Knights since Barons would probably be on higher, more administrative positions, but either would act more naturally.

Yeah I have to agree that actual cannon that demons wouldn't give a shit about sex. I much prefer the sexed up AU.

I like to think, culturally, Mars Demons are a lot different than Hell Demons. They spend more time around humanity, are in a much more comfortable environment, and have a lot more freedom.

That's true. One of the reasons I'd love to go to Mars. A different demon every night, new and exciting kinds of sin. Sign me the hell up. Fucking a pack of imp twinks one night, then being used as a barons personal cocksleeve the next. Maybe an elaborate BDSM scene with a Summoner, or some oral worship of a sweaty hellknight after a workout. So many options.

What about a monogamous relationship.

Also perfectly valid if you happen to fall in love and find the demon you want to spend eternity with. But you need to do a lot of looking to find them. And maybe they enjoy playing with others as well?
Tell me about your demon husband anon.

I'm a depressed lonely gay virgin, I don't know what my demon husband would be.
Not creative enough for that.

Well what would your dream husband be? Surely you have a fantasy. From one depressed gay guy to another, good luck with your struggle.

Just an all around perfect person like any other person who has never been in a relationship imagines relationships can be. I'm in too much of a sadposting mood right now, maybe if I get into a horny one later I can give a better answer.

I'm thinking about my imaginary Summoner bf unhealthily often.

Same. I like to imagine he like to pet my head and play with my hair while we cuddle together and float. Whispering sweet nothings in his rumbling demonic voice and promising to be with me forever, to guide and nurture my soul so we will have each other for eternity.

\>TFW when you will never transform into a Hell Knight, but retain your humanity so you're still you....albeit with a lot more physical power
(I don't mind changing into something else, provided I'm still myself in personality)

How would you use your new demon body?

First I'd revel in it, masturbating wantonly for days. Then I'd seduce humans, using my old training to my advantage to be stealthy. I'd also keep my old ID badge, figuring eventually people would figure out my true identity. Because of my strong pheromones, it wouldn't be hard for me to make humans my submissives. Gradually, I'd form a secret harem within the facility.
As for my sexual approach, I'd use a mixture of raw demon strength and my human intelligence to really make my submissives moan and writhe in bliss.

Overall how would you treat your subs?

Depends on the submissive. I adjust my technique for each other. But I treat them well, being an ex-human. I have my demon instincts and urges, balanced by my human memories and intelligence, so I'm a mix of both. Some humans I'm pretty firm with, but only because they want the rough sex.
My main constant is how I make them mine. Long poundings with multiple orgasm-denials, stretched out over hours. I thrust into them until they're absolutely begging for release. Being a demon, I have an absurd amount of stamina.

If being a demon was more open, say a lewd mars AU, would you let people approach you on the street and just ask for a fuck?

Very likely. I'd be honest about my intentions (wanting submissive humans to add to my growing harem).
And ultimately, I'd establish my harem in a large room within the facility. Enough to hold all my gay human sluts.

Sleep on a pile of gay boys?

Yup. Big strong demon, surrounded by a ton of human guys.

-----

Out of curiosity, does anyone else fantasize about turning into a "Doom" demon? And if so, what type?

No, I mostly just want to fuck them all.

Summoner so I can float around and do black magic for my bf

hey its me ur human bf

id totally summon tea for you and heat it up with hellfire and love.

That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever told me. I'd be the best human bf I could for you, telling you how wonderful you are and how much I appreciate you. And kissing your cute eyeplates to show you that you are beautiful to me.

What about cuddling and reading and pondering about strange philosophy?
Careful, he'd be a little confused at first before doubly returning the flattery. Anywhere you'd go in the apartment, he wouldn't break the hand holding.

You say that like that isn't exactly what I'd want from a lovely summoner BF!

He's still a bit unused to kissing, both because of not doing it before and also because he's still getting used to having lips. So when he plants a kiss on your hand, forehead, neck or your own mouth, it's either just a small bump or a sloppy lick, the latter of which leaves him flustered and nervous because leaving you covered in drool is ever so slightly indecent. You don't mind, of course.

Aww he's so adorable. Of course I don't mind him showing me affection however he's comfortable with. Besides, a nice sloppy lick on the mouth is a good way to start some slow and tender make out sessions.

I like the Imps' face, they look like someone just told them "Fuck me right here" after they've gone without a rut for a while. I certainly wouldn't mind one looking at me like that.

That look he gives you after you've had a lovely date, and you ask him to take you home so he and his pack can run a train on you all night. At least that's what I'd do. On the second date of course, I have standards.

  \>You're looking in each other's eyes and you can see mischievous sparks in his glowing gaze.
  \>It probably started way back when you met up here - he complimented your Bloodying Storm t-shirt, you complimented his hoodie with decorated, runed holes for his spikes.
  \>You got your steak medium, he got his rare.
  \>You try not to think of dirty things when you see him eat the noticeably juicier bits of meat.
  \>The conversation throughout the dinner is great, he's pretty chill about things but he likes to laugh, too.
  \>Well, snicker would be a better word. He sounds and looks cute while doing it.
  \>After finishing your meals, you bring up that one could go to the other's place.
  \>Now, this is your second date but it's not the second time you've seen him.
  \>You've met him and his pack several times already at his place.
  \>They're good people too, friendly, funny and cute. He's the cutest and funniest and friendliest of them, of course.
  \>(Let's not mention how you've had to awkwardly cross your legs while at his place because of his pack's very casual clothing choices when at home)
  \>Back to the restaurant:
  \>His smile shifts between hearty and romantic, and dirty and naughty.
  \>He counts on his fingers how many of his mates should be home or get home easily upon being notified.
  \>Four fingers on each of his hands is not enough. Oh boy.
  \>You can barely contain your legs' trembling.
  \>Walking through the night city, him staring at you from his hoodie to his home, you two can't contain it anymore.
  \>Before arriving at your destination, you jump into a dark alley. They're actually much cleaner than many main streets back on Earth.
  \>You quickly suck each other off on the ground there before, your libidos barely affected, quickly continuing to your date's place. The backstreet is a good shortcut too, since it's very close.
  \>You hear muffled music while approaching the apartment door.
  \>Easily a dozen Imp guys and a couple of girls greet you and your date.
  \>This is gonna be fun.
  
Oh sweet Icon I think I'm in love. The snickering is too much, he's perfect. Now all he has to do is gently nibble on my neck with those teeth of his and it's done, we're a thing now.

  \>You're immediately taken in to the familiar apartment, many voices greeting you while you feel hands touching you.
  \>Hell, you can feel your arms getting kissed sloppily.
  \>You're brought into the lived in and always comfy looking main living room, a table in the corner stretching underneath snacks and drinks, including alcohol.
  \>The night was wild, to say the very least.
  \>One moment you're standing in the middle of the room, the next you're lying on one of the sofas, passionately making out with your partner.
  \>Sometimes a pack member rides you, other times you're being plowed, both your bottom and member being played with by someone else during the former and latter respectively. Your face is also busy, both with males and females. Mostly males, though.
  \>A few times you and your boyfriend, still hoodied but unzipped, spitroast another Imp.
  \>It's taxing on your stamina and there are occasional breaks, too, with gentle kissing, teasing, nibbling, sweet-talking and stroking with your one demon while the room is filled with exhausted sighs.
  \>At some point, the orgy gets less heated until you eventually pass out in a warm embrace.
  
  \>You wake up, feeling warm pressure from all around you.
  \>Your face is resting against soft fabric.
  \>You're inside a pile of sleeping Imps, loosely holding on to you, with one of them cuddling with you with most of his body.
  \>Soon, the demons around you start moving as well as they're slowly woken up by your groggy movements.
  \>Each one gives you a small kiss on the cheek as they go do stuff, except one who stays.
  \>Your bodies are too tired for any dirty shenanigans, so you just lie there and talk to each other.
  \>You realise you're almost completely naked, but that makes the hug more intimate.
  \>At least, as intimate as possible with a pack of almost naked Imps running around.
  \>You're brought a set of clean clothes and resolutely invited for breakfast.
  \>Some leave for work afterwards, some, including you and your boyfriend, stay.

\>slutting
\>bisexual slutting
To each their own I guess

\>implying having fun with the pack is slutting
  That's not how Imps work. While each Imp is an individual, the packs are much more homogenous than any type of group of humans. At least in the western civilization since that's the only one I can at least pretend to know something about. Packs share food, share goods, share feelings, comfort each other and oftentimes share partners. You're not dating just one Imp guy, you're dating his whole pack. Of course, this depends if it's a blood pack (an actual family) or unrelated pack, but the ones on Mars are mostly the latter with strict ethical rules to avoid inbreeding in case of there being siblings.
  Most other demons are obviously more solitary, but to a lesser degree this behavior can be seen with Barons of Hell where there are sometimes seen two unseparable "bruiser brothers" (a slang, so they're neither related nor brutish). Dating one often means dating both of them.
  
Of course, this anon may simply desire a single monogamous relationship and there's nothing wrong with that. Summoners and Archviles are very good for that sort of thing. But as you said, date the Imp, date the pack! And the Imp has me thoroughly charmed I must say. I'd be very happy to try out dating his pack and see how it goes. I wonder how you handle marriage with an imp pack?

\>monogamous loving relationship with hoodie wearing imp is impossible
Barons and Knights seem like ultra super chad only tops who only do rough sex which just isn't for me and Summoners look like they want someone who's not below average in everything including intelligence.
I think I had four dreams destroyed today. Maybe we can hit a five, who knows!

  Marriage with an Imp pack is an interesting one. Back in Hell, there actually was something a little bit reminiscent of that, except it was mostly for practical uses. Not monetary like arranged marriages in human cultures but rather for work management. Any married Imp would have his place in the pack's workflow and hierarchy set, for instance someone specialises in hunting Trites, or Bloodworms, maybe preparing the meat, etc.
  This has carried over to Mars slightly, except in a much more pleasurable way. Marriages are from actual love and not need, but that "your work is set" ethic sort of applies here too. Someone is assigned with preparing the food during celebrations (Glihkrr makes great blood goulash, Krinkra is the only one whose beer always tastes great, etc.), someone else does partial cleaning of the lair, and so on.

  You're talking about stereotypes here. There are many solitary Imps who prefer the free life without the frankly sometimes aggravating community aspect to packs.
  While most Knights like to work out and build their muscle, saying that they're all mindless chads who only like to fuck you like a slab of meat is slightly offensive - most don't like that even as a roleplay in private. The ones on Mars are usually big softies inside. Many Barons love the newfound casual life without being expected to coldly command others and are great pals to go for a beer with.
  And Summoners aren't some Rick and Morty copypasta spergs, what the hell. They do like intelligent people, but that doesn't mean smarty pants but rather someone with good morals and who likes to talk with them about stuff. They like to explain things to someone interested and to be in a relationship where one comforts the other.
  As varied as humans are, so is each and every type of demons - and there's many types of demons, so don't let your dreams get crushed by some assumptions.

I doubt I could even take demondick but I'd spend eternity lapping at those sweaty balls if I got a whiff of them

Fuck I bet demon balls are amazing. Potent sweat, exotic texture (just the right mix of soft and firm), constant refilling, lewd but subtle sloshing, perfectly pendulous and round, and both balls excellently defined. Not to mention powerful-as-fuck pheromones.

That's perfect. You get his balls and I'll spend my afterlife making out with his fat demonic asshole.

Even as a Hell Knight, I'd probably bury my face in other demons' balls.

-----

What genre of music would each demon species mostly prefer? Hard mode: What metal subgenres would they prefer? Not sure if fitting but...
\>Imps: Power or black metal (power's nice to listen to and kinda cheesy while black is wild)
\>Knights: Heavy or thrash metal (rhythmic, angry and kind of a classic)
\>Barons: Doom or sludge metal or on the contrary, grind (former for rulers commanding from their throne, latter for angry warmachines)
\>Archviles: Speed metal (does that need an explanation?)
\>Summoners: Post-metal (artsy)
What about folk metal, symphonic metal, melodeath, etc.?

I thought that Summoners would really be into symphonic metal. Very complicated and can have that intellectual pull that classical music has.
Cacos would totally be into synthmetal, as for folk I'm not really sure.

Look at this cutie

I like that he has still a fairly toned body and arms with some muscle on -and- stone-crushingly thicc thighs.

He will never take the place of hoodie imp in my heart for he is my true bf. But I think he's adorable and would happily be friends with him. Maybe even mess around if BF is down for it.

but hoodie imp is a murderer. you can see the hand of the corpse he stole the hoodie from

HI had a rough transition to Mars. Many regrettable things happened before proper negotiations could be opened. I mean from his point of view he was kidnapped and held hostage, it's forgivable that he would defend himself!
He's my boyfriend and you'll never make me not love him to death.

Wait, would all those deaths just be completely ignored?
How would that even fly at all.

I mean, we forgive war crimes in the real world pretty often. Not always, but hey the US forgave a lot of Japanese war criminals.

I certainly wouldn't. Demons that comitted murder should be forced to give reparations.
Sexual reparations.

That's certainly an option

So, let me hear this right: you can find a demon in the hell, that's quite gentle and laid-back with you? Is that right?

That’s how I understand it.

M-marvelous to hear. I ask nothing, except a very loving demon, that can cuddle me for hours, have calm and tendering sex with me, and give me a few kisses for every once. Well, I hope theses brilliant traits doesn't has any problem to fit with any kind of demon.
But, which? What demon should I choose to be as my good-hearted kind demonfriend? I can't decide it. Do you have any recommendations, buddy?

  My recommendations are as follows,
  A summoner. Look at them, so delicate and graceful. It's fairly well established cannon for our sexed up DOOM setting that they are intelligent, witty and charming on average. They would absolutely love to hold you close and cuddle with you for hours as they float above the ground, wrapping you on their fleshy wings and barricading you against the outside world with themselves. Gently kissing you, occasionally nibbling on your ears and neck, and whispering to you how much they care, how wonderful they are and how happy they are to have found you Anon. They really do love you, and they never want to let you go.
  A hellknight. They were rescued from a life of absolute misery, fighting and dying in the arenas of hell for amusement. Never feeling the touch of another except to hurt and be hurt. Won't you show them anon, what it means to be gentle? Show them how to love someone and mean it? They would do anything for you, their savior. You found them lost and lonely on the streets of Mars and you didn't run and scream like the others. You helped, and now they want to help you.
  Imps. See the above stories about hoodie imp. You'd be a member of an imp pack. And entire family that loves and supports you as one of their own. Your blood to them, and they'll always have your back.
  Of course any demon could be your beloved soulmate but those are the three that seem most likely to me.
  
  It seems I will go for a hellknight in a heartbeat. With this unfortunate destiny hellknights are forced to take, it touches my warm heart, and my melancholic emotions. I had no idea theses big innocent knights have to suffer through this misery, and I won't stand there doing nothing.
  It's decided. I will go adopt a hot, beefy and tall manly hellknight right away, and take it to my home, and treat him with care and affection, as much as possible, like a son of mine, washing away the horrible memories he has on his mind. I can't wait to witness my lovely hellknight, learning to feel sentiments, adapt to be a timid, lazy and laid-back monster, and redistribute the love back to me. I can't wait to, especially, witness him discover my private parts, and feel horny for the first time. Truly, a true poor demon to comfort and protect.
  Alright, thanks much. I admire your knowledge on theses intriguing lovely monsters, buddy. All I have to do now, is to wander around the hell and find a hell knight.

Anyone else really like Hayden? That was one sexy robot.

Sexy robot body but not much of a fan of his voice. VEGA's voice is ASMR material, though.

It is very soothing. Imagine being suspended in some kind of crazy sci fi BDSM pod with Vega being the voice telling you what's happening and why. Calling you a good test subject while he explains the importance of stress testing the human body like this before allowing the new resident demons to use you on your work shift as a cum dump.

I'm thinking about writing a story about two uac scientists. A test gets out of control and turns one of them into a summoner. The other is a specialist on summoners and is made the newly turned demon scientist roomie as he helps him understand and live with his new powers. Oh and plenty of increasingly gay activities happen while they learn.

I am incapable of expressing just how amazing that sounds. Gay, slice of life, summoners. It has literally everything. Please, for the Love of the Slayer DO IT

Farewell everyone. It's been a good thread. I look forward to the next, and someone should copy all the stories so far so we don't lose them.
	
Farewell to you too. I have been here since a few threads before, and I can't wait to get build up a collection of DOOM demons on my new folder of DOOM. May all of us find the boyfriend demon we all profoundly dream and wish to have

In time, dearest anon. I have already found my soulmate in Hoodie Imp. But I'm sure others will find theirs in time.

\>TFW you will never be a Hell Knight eating out Cyberdemon ass. 
 
I'd prefer to stay a human but gimme dat ass. Eating ass is not degenerate enough though, how about some lip on lip kissing? With lewd handholding? 

I like making out with demon asses, that's like kissing. Always hold hands though, they like that kind of degeneracy. 

\>they grip your hands tightly when you hit the good spot
\>because of their claws, they sometimes leave some scratches on yours
\>nothing too deep or painful, though occasionally some blood can come out
\>they often freak out at the sight and worry they might have severely injured their human partner
\>these scars on top of hands are pretty much a public sign of affection towards your demon though, so you don't mind
I swear I'm not trying to sexualise scarring or, by extension, self-harm, I just got the thought of a demon gripping one's hand in bliss. 

I love that idea. It's just who they are and you still love and accept them for it. They might trim their claws for you but still, it will happen sometimes and you understand. It's adorable, you walking hand in claw with your demonic love. 

It goes both ways. You like how gentle they are with the razor-sharp claws, being careful to not hurt you when petting you - but they can give you a good scratch if you can't get rid of that pesky itch. And on the other hand, they're amazed at your softness as a human. Rubbing your silky palms against their chitin-like cheeks or using any large enough area of your body as a pillow makes them melt. 

Imps would be the best boyfriends for those reasons. I need to cuddle one. 

https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1537/65/1537657794878.jpg
Imps are great and cute and agile, but have you seen the nails on a Summoner? 

Oh my God yes, they are my other true love. The eyeplates, the sweet grin. The delicate and elegant motions. I cannot chose I would need them both to hold and love and cuddle and kiss.

Awesome and cute. What's the story here? 

Nothing specific, but generally, he is an imp obsessed with proving how much of a powerful and strong demon he is, but ALWAYS fails. The thing is that this imp may or may not actually want to fail.

\>You're roused from the sleep by something unknown in the middle of the night.
\>You feel thin warmth across your chest and pressure on top of your shoulder.
\>Groggily looking around, you see your Summoner resting his head against your shoulder, his arm lying atop your stomach.
\>"You're sleeping."
\>"What? So... You're not here?"
\>"I am here but I am not. You're sleeping."
\>"So when I wake up, you'll be gone again?"
\>"Possibly, but you're awake. And also sleeping."
\>"How is that possible?"
\>"I have no idea."
\>"So if I don't wake up, you'll stay?"
\>"Yes, but you're already awake. Sort of."
\>His voice has a strange mood to it, though that might be just because of him whispering quietly.
\>You rest your chin against the top of his head and sigh, slowly drifting back to sleep again.
\>"I don't want you to leave..."
\>"It's alright, go to sleep."
\>"Didn't you say I'm sleeping?"
\>"Yes, but... Just go on, trust me."
\>You wake up in the morning, this time it feels much more real, without the muddiness of an otherwise confusingly convincing dream.
\>You start stretching around, reminiscing about yesterday and planning for today.
\>There's...
\>You feel something pressing on your shoulder and something warm lying on your chest.

\>5'11" vs 6'1"
Freedom units are weird. 

The wonderful options you have when fucking a Cyberdemon. Worshiping a cock as big as you are. Grab an oxygen tank and be a living buttplug. Size difference yo 

What if I just want to fuck his ass with my normal sized cock oh wait I can't.
Demons a shit 

Yeah, I guess you'll have to go with a less drastic size difference demon, then. Even Barons, who are still over twice as big as an average human, are a good deal, good time and good boyfriends.
Don't pay much attention to them speaking in a somewhat domineering manner, they see you as an equal and love you unconditionally. And when it comes to duh ass, it's still an ass. A tight one.

A Baron speaking to you at all is a sign of affection. After all they are used to ruling in hell, having something small and soft to protect like a human is a very new experience to them. Give them a few years to get the vocabulary down and they might even admit how adorable they think you are.

\>You're lying on the floor, completely drenched in sweat.
\>These workout session with your Hell Knight are killing you.
\>They do seem to be getting slightly easier though, so it's probably working.
\>"Ninety-five... ninety-six..."
\>You look at him, doing his last set of push-ups.
\>"Ninety... crap, where did I stop?"
\>"Six, four more to go."
\>A few seconds later, he's finished and lies down on the floor next to you.
\>He plants a short kiss on one side of your head covered in wet hair and starts to do some stretching.
\>"Your posture was much better during that plank," he comments while doing a mix of weird horizontal postures, "and your legs aren't shaking anymore from lunges."
\>You listen to him while your heartbeat slowly calms down from the exercise.
\>Even though you feel sweaty, you're nothing compared to him.
\>You use a big floor mat to not have to swab the floor each time; the workout makes him emanate immense heat and his rough skin glisten with sweat.
\>He likes his showers, but there's something strangely appealing about his worked out form after a session. Might be some pheromones, who knows.
\>As he ends the stretching, he stays on the floor for a while and looks you in the eyes with wherever his eyes would be.
\>"We could really use a shower..." he groans softly.
\>You have a better idea.
\>Rolling around, you sit up and climb on top of him, your slick bodies stickily coming into contact.
\>The humid warmth radiating from him is intense. It makes your head spin as it plays with your brain.
\>Your mouths meet in a sloppy but incredibly hot kiss while his large hands gently hold your body closer.
\>You want more of him; you lick him, grind on him, smell him, pet him. Damp clothing gets thrown away immediately.
\>Very quickly you feel his arousal tap on your thighs.
\>"You -did- ask for it," he growls playfully, "not even waiting for the shower."
And then you had super awesome sweaty sex with lots of cummies, went to shower and then to cuddly sleep. The end.

Cute boy. I want to seduce him. What do you think trash, can I date this demon? 

Of course. He's very sweet and loving, but he is a bit of an odd one when it comes to Imps. He's a lone one. The history of his pack back in Hell is tragic and he arrived on Mars without anyone else. He's mostly gotten over it, deaths of large parts of packs being a common thing in Hell. Still doesn't change the fact that he's, well, alone. "I don't want to join a pack of my kind," he says, "THAT would bring up some memories. But I want company, someone to have," he explains while looking at you, a bit unsure. 

I'd gently take his claws in my hand and tell him I'd like that. And that I'm happy to be there for him however he needs me, as a friend or maybe something more.

  \>Having a great time, when a thought crosses your mind
  \>"You get a lot of suiciders?" You ask, popping his cockhead out of your mouth.

  \>He chuckles.
  \>"No, not really. Most just run away carelessly, screaming, and get eaten by the lowlies." Probably Imps or some other frequent demon type.
  \>He continues, "Or if they do want to die, usually they just run up at me and they're mush before they think of, well, not dying. But I -have- got a few polite ones."
  \>He nudges your face with a thigh slightly to get you to keep going. You put his slick cock in again while listening carefully.
  \>"They just come up to me and ask me to end it," he shrugs, "why not. Humans are silly."
  \>He looks down at you.
  \>"You're silly too. But I like that kind of, uh, silliness."
  \>He softly taps your head twice with his unbelievably sharp claws.

  \>You pause, giving the demon a particularly rubbing suckle that makes him dig his claws into the dirt below you audibly.
  \>"So, you're gonna kill me?"
  \>He chuckles again, "Oh no, quite the opposite. I'll make sure you're -not- going to get killed. But you probably realise that I'm not letting you go."
  \>You lick the underside of his dick playfully, getting more of his taste.
  \>"Yes, I'm counting on that."
  \>Suddenly, a gentle but firm push on your back with what seemed to be the demon's heel pushes you forwards.
  \>"Well, get this done now. My lair is nearby. I'll require more servicing of you when I come back from some...," he looks at his claws and arm muscles, "...hunting, I suppose."

  \>You mumble some agreeable noises at his explanation, and his headpats.
  \>Shit are you a headpat slut? 
  \>Eh, there's worse things out there you think as you slurp down some glowing precum and nuzzle your check into his thigh.
  \>After a few minutes you pop free and lick your lips clean
  \>"This place makes people strange. I've been dying to do this ever since we started studying your kind. Something about you all is just so attractive" you purr up at the demon as you stroke his shaft and fondle his sack.

  \>With one last nuzzle against his scrotum, he lets you stand up. You wipe your mouth.
  \>"Your kind is... interesting too," he says, "cute and needy. So very fragile too; physically at least."
  \>It's awfully cold out here. A part of you wants to sit back down and bury your face in the Knight's crotch again, but he's already standing too.
  \>"Let's get going," he half notes, half commands while offering you a hand, motioning you to stand on it.
  \>You do and he raises you up and lays you on his shoulder, stomach down.
  \>He holds you down to keep you from falling with his firm, rough hand. Sometimes he nabs you with a claw but he seems to be careful not to hurt you in any way.
  \>It shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to reach the hideout.

  \>Enjoying the ride and the power of your new demonic... partner? Owner? Boyfriend? Whatever, you let your hands idly roam his body while he carries you.
  \>He's surprisingly warm, and smooth. Not his bony skull though, that's pretty cold. 
  \>Smother ride though, great view. If demons are all this relaxed you really should have just invited a few over to Mars for some fun years ago. 
  \>Still, you have a burning question you need to ask him, before it's too late.
  \>"So...I'm cute?" You hazard at him.
  \>"Fragile I can understand, especially compared with something as... robust as you. But cute is new to me."

  \>He seems to smile a bit.
  \>"You're soft and your hide has a simple but pleasant color. I find the, uh... eyes also pretty in how colorful and glossy they are."
  \>Your cheeks go warm.
  \>"And the squishy fragility plays a role in it too. We like to fight and maim. But we also like to protect. Something small and, well, cute makes me more inclined to protect it."
  \>You rest your head in the place above the greenish chestplate. You give the softer inner skin a kiss.
  \>"You make me wonder if I should leave for the hunt now that I have you," he growls in pondering,
  \>"Why?"
  \>"To show you around the place, my and now also your home and teach you some... basic knowledge," he purrs in a way that makes your bones pleasantly rattle. It's a very comforting sensation.
  \>You look around and see the ruins of a small house.
  \>"Is that it?"
  \>"Yes and no," he says, "I have got a proper lair, rebuilt from one of those cave rooms humans build. The top layer is just old remains."
  \>"A basement?"
  \>"Blah, no. It's welcoming and livable, you shall see."
  \>He shakes his head.
  \>"I don't live in over-opulence like some of the Barons, but no fighter, let alone one who would bring a worshipper... or partner maybe, would live in a damp burrow."
  \>His smile rises again.

  \>Partner or worshiper. Both sound nice, as long as he stays this way.
  \>You really like it when he smiles.
  \>Without eyes to light up it seems more honest somehow. 
  \>You wonder what his hideaway is like. Do they consider bleeding skull fountains opulent and just regular skulls tasteful decor? Guess you'll see soon.
  \>"So what are you hunting?" you ask as he carries you through the ruins. 
  \>Damn this place got gutted, nothing left standing.
  \>"Going looking for more humans or...?" You let the question linger as you kick your legs idly in the air and nuzzle into his chest.

  \>"It depends. Sometimes it's food and oftentimes, it's trophies. Skulls or memorabilia, I don't make a difference," he growls, "though I follow a rule of not taking a trophy from a non-assailant. Some of my brethren... don't follow that rule."
  \>He stops, flicking out his meaty tongue to taste the air. A second later, he continues and soon you're right in front of the house.
  \>Foundations seem to be mostly fine but they're covered in uins and rubble of the rest of the house. He crouches a little and finds a staircase to what looks like a basement.
  \>Except, after making a few twists and turns in the decripit, claustrophobic hallway, the place opens up.
  \>A massive-looking wooden door with runic inscriptions, slightly taller than the Knight, is suddenly right in front of you, with two high candelabras on each side.
  \>The damp smell of a basement is already replaced by neutral, warm and dry scent with something almost undetectably spicy in the background.
  \>"Excuse the way here, I did mention it being a hideout," he says, looking at you.
  \>He opens the door with a push and a somewhat large hall greets you.
  \>It's also illuminated with fires, this time with ones embedded in the walls behind metal bars. They produce warmth and pleasant crackling.
  \>The floor is made of stone but in many places is covered in rough but pretty carpets.
  \>Directly opposite of you is a throne or a seat, and behind it, a large collection of various things on shelves and cupboards; probably the trophies.
  \>There are two doorframes leading out of the main hall, probably to more private quarters and something else.
  \>The Knight sets you down. Again, he's careful and gentle but he also leaves you to make a small jump down.
  \>"This is my lair and your new home. I hope it's to your liking."
  \>It is nice. Sure, it's made of stone, but it looks cosy and lived in. You like it already.
  \>"Would you like to see the trophies, or...," he looks down at you and you realise you're facing his... crotch. What now?

  \>Thank God you approached what appears to be one of the better demons, it's always a risk but the only unholy thing you want tearing up your guts is a cock.
  \>And he's being very kind to offer you a choice in the matter of what happens now. 
  \>And this place *is* very comfortable. You want to see if you can get him blushing with pride before anything else.
  \>"This is wonderful! So much nicer than the horrible housing we had back on the base. Did you make it all yourself?"
  \>You lift a hand to his groin and gently pat his monstrous member.
  \>"But if you're being kind enough to give me an opportunity to choose here, why don't you show me around? Let me see all of your trophies and the new living space before we get back to anything...too fun" you say seductively.

  \>You feel the shaft twitch under your touch and leave a small kiss of precum on your palm.
  \>"Or how about...," he says, "we do the fun stuff right here," he points on the carpet below your feet, "I'll show you my lair afterwards," he crouches down as you sit on the floor, "and then figure something else out."
  \>His voice is husky and like gravel covered in velvet. It -makes you- go down and throw your clothes away but it's comforting and loving.
  \>He grabs your legs shaking from excitement and pulls you up. His clawed fingers are firmly wrapped around your legs.
  \>You look at his cock that's now grown to its full size. Oh boy.
  \>It looks very glossy and slick though. And delicious.
  \>You feel your thighs get covered in precum as he slowly makes his way in your exposed bottom.
  \>The first few pumps are slow and unsure as you're getting used to being stretched by him.
  \>Soon though, he speeds up. And doesn't really stop speeding up.
  \>Your back sliding across the carpet back and forth as he keeps pulling in and out, you latch onto the soft floor.
  \>You moan and he growls in response. He's glossier now, both from the warm lighting and from him sweating.
  \>It feels really good. You didn't think you could take him this easily, but his cock is very round and smooth at the end - it's the shaft that's rougher and bumpier - great for massaging your ass.
  \>Suddenly, he speeds up, slapping his balls against you. His growls get louder and rougher.
  \>And then he roars, his shout echoing in the room.
  \>You feel him throb inside you before your guts are flooded with sticky, hot seed.
  \>The sensation pushes you over and, with a short scream, you cum too.
  \>You're incapacitated for a few seconds from the bliss.
  \>When you regain senses, you're covered in your jizz while your ass is overflowing the demon's cum.
  \>"Feeling better?" you ask him breathlessly. He nods, shooting a grin with his slimy tongue in-between his teeth at you.
  \>"Let's go get cleaned up," he motions to a door.

  \>"Aw, I kind of like the mess" you pout as he helps you up
  \>With a gentle lick on the side of your face he helps you up and towards the door.
  \>"If you like it you can earn more later" he growls and makes you weak in the knees again. Something about that voice just cuts right through you.
  \>You're dripping a bit as you stand. Apparently he doesn't like that. Before you know it you are picked up and help upside down, your face in front of his dripping infernal cock and your legs splayed out.
  \>You cry out as you feel his massive slimy tentacle of a tongue lick between your cheeks. 
  \>"No leaking on the rugs little Mortal" he orders. You feel your flagging manhood throb at that. Apparently you like taking orders.
  \> "Now you clean me while I clean you and show you to somewhere more comfortable" he says as he let's his messy cock rub against your face.

  \>You're taken to one of the side rooms while working your tongue on the shaft in front of you.
  \>Suddenly, you smell a change in the air. It's much more humid.
  \>You arch your head backwards and see what looks to be a stone bath on the upper side of your vision.
  \>Blood rushes out of your brain as you're turned around again and put on the floor.
  \>"There will be lots of cleaning of other kinds later on, especially on my throne, but for now...," the Knight says as he steps into the water. It's steaming but doesn't seem to be too hot.
  \>The pool is large enough for both of you and when he motions you to step in, you do.
  \>"Now, clean me," he says, nodding at a rough brush in the water.
  \>You grab it and start rubbing him with it. It gives you a good opportunity to touch every part of his body.
  \>You like his quiet rumbling of satisfaction when you clean his softer parts.
  \>And then he turns around to let you clean his back and ass. You feel your nethers stiffen at the sight of it.
  \>"How did you get in this shape?"
  \>He chuckles, his voice strange with it being muffled and reflected off the water surface.
  \>"Lots of fights in the Hell Pits, and I got good at hunting the best-looking sources of meat."
  \>When you're done, he turns around again and focuses on you.
  \>"This thing might be too... detrimental for your physique, no?" he holds the brush you were cleaning him with.
  \>"Yeah, it'd probably take the flesh right off my bone."
  \>"Ah, good to know, then."
  \>He starts rubbing you with just his rough hands, avoiding scratching you.
  \>Sometimes he hits a spot that makes you giggle from the unexpected tickle, other times you lowly groan under the massage.
  \>"You're so soft," he purrs.
  \>"Wanna cuddle later?" you ask him teasingly.
  \>He laughs, raising waves in the bath, "We will."
  \>Feeling tender and much cleaner, he pulls you out of the water and on your feet.
  \>"Towels are over there," he explains as he himself gets up, water dripping from him and his... extremities...

  \>"What about clothing?" you ask after you dry yourself and help the Knight with hard to reach areas.
  \>He stops and ponders for a second.
  \>"I am not sure. It's warm here and I myself prefer being naked, but if you don't like that... we will figure something out. Might be an interesting trophy."
  \>He snaps up.
  \>"Trophies! Come, I'll show you," he says as he leaves the humid room.
  \>Back in the main hall, you feel the fires warm you from all around. It feels nice; you might not even need clothes, it seems.
  \>Trying not to focus on the hanging member on the demon, you follow him behind his throne.
  \>There's a lot of interesting items to be found, ranging from skulls through jewelry to technology.
  \>"H- How big was this thing?" you ask, pointing at an angry-looking skull that's bigger than your torso, proudly bolted on the wall in the middle.
  \>"That was a Baron. They often think stealing supplies from a Knight won't do any harm, and this one was wrong," he chuckles, "he left me with an arm broken three times over, but it was worth it."
  \>"And what's -that-?" you nod at a big, complex weapon.
  \>"I'm not sure. It made green light, destroyed anything it hit and nearly boiled all the blood in my other arm. The human wielding it was tough to kill."
  \>You look at the Knight's arms, they're both healthy, but one looks ever-so slightly crooked and the other has a pattern of lighter and darker skin on it.
  \>You can barely let out much more than a 'wow'.
  \>The rest of the trophies is also interesting. Many a skull of a creature you don't know; ring, armlet or armor with runes and brutal imagery; and also eye-catching computers and gadgets, some of which your nerdy ass recognises.
  \>"This is amazing, there's so much stuff here!" you say as you inspect the semi-rare Paintari 9600 computer and the Integrated Domestic Demonisation QD neural interface.
  \>You turn around and look at the demon. He's grinning with barely contained pride.

How about a human domming for once. Maybe one of the big guys even?
Doesn't have to be aggressive or anything. 

I want to see a human asking out a demon in a sort of Nu-mars setting and seeing how dating and starting a relationship goes. Demon of your preference of course. 

  \>What an evening this was.
  \>You didn't expect to find someone but... you did.
  \>With a friend you go to a bar and, as it oftentimes happens, a demon stumbles upon you.
  \>An imp. A cute one, you instantly think to yourself.
  \>Says he likes to hang out and if you don't mind if he grabs a drink with you two; paying for himself, of course.
  \>Sure, why not.
  \>He's pretty chill, too. Easy-going, has snarky humour without coming off as an asshole and generally radiates a pleasant aura.
  \>Some time and a beer or two later, your friend gets a call, apparently some Cacodemon accidentally breathed plasma into a plasma rifle and the following EMP shut down the whole building.
  \>At this point, you and the Imp are already sitting very close next to each other, more than slightly tipsy.
  \>"I uh... once sent a fireball into a computer. They weren't really pleased with it," he says, chuckling a little.
  \>"I kinda... I once plugged in a mainframe cable in a laptop, not sure how. It went boom," you reply. He laughs.
  \>"Hey, you... you're nice... and all. Maybe, would you like to come over to my place?"
  \>"You wouldn't mind that? What about the pack?"
  \>"Oh, I..." he looks away for a moment, "I don't have a pack. 'Isa long story. And, well, I said you seem nice. We could watch... a movie? And I could be in a place where they don't mind me crawling the walls."
  \>"You can crawl walls!?" you quickly ask, barely letting him finish, "That's neat."
  \>"Well, most Imps can do that, I... I'm not sure why I mentioned it, it's not important, but uh, wanna come or stay here a while?"
  \>You look at the rest of your beer. This Mount Karindgar'un is much stronger than the standard Olympus Mons and you're feeling quite woozy. You down the last gulp and nod at the demon.
  \>"I live just a bit away from here, let's go."
  \>The journey is short with the nice talking happening between you two. He tells you about how he got to Mars and what funny mishaps he did at first, you mostly just nod and laugh.

  \>You arrive at his place.
  \>It's fairly small but lived in and cosy.
  \>Instead of a bed, there's a wide couch. Actually wide, so that it doesn't really matter.
  \>Some clothes are strown about.
  \>"Oh, fuck, lemme just..."
  \>He runs around and throws the clothing on one pile in the bathroom.
  \>"I forgot about this."
  \>"Hey, you should have seen my flat," you say before freezing with a thousand yard stare, "oh crap, I hope I put that noodle box in the fridge."
  \>He laughs at the sight of you.
  \>Not just chuckles like he usually does. Actually laughs.
  \>It's cheery and bright but with a deliciously mischievous demonic undertone.
  \>"So, uh, heheh," he calms down, "what do you want to do? I've got a screen, or we can play something, or I've got some more beer or stronger stuff in the fridge."
  \>"I actually don't... really know," you say, feeling somewhat awkward. Continuing a convo from a dead point has never been your strong suit.
  \>"Hey, we can just watch a movie while talking and drinking, that always works!" he says and goes to the kitchen that's a part of the living room, "I'll just get some water, what about you?"
  \>You look at him for a second before realising that demons find the refreshing neutral taste of water much more appealing after they realised they don't need to drink the metallic-tasting blood.
  \>"Yeah, sure," you say as you sit down on the sofa.
  \>You wait for a moment.
  \>Suddenly, a voice from above startles you, making you jump and thrash, "Hey, here it is."
  \>You look up, he's reaching to you with a glass of water.
  \>"How in the... how did you get the glass up there without spilling it?"
  \>"Eh, it's natural."
  \>"Are you gonna stay there like that?"
  \>He unglues himself and lands on the floor with a muted thud on the cheap but nice enough carpet.
  \>"'Course not," he laughs and jumps to sit next to you while reaching for the remote.
  \>You quickly place your hand on his arm with a "No, the quiet might be nicer after the club."
  \>He stares at it for a second.

  \>You quickly pull it away with a quiet 'sorry'.
  \>He smiles, "No! Put it back!"
  \>You unsuredly place your palm back on his leathery arm.
  \>"I... I like that."
  \>"Like what?" you ask bluntly.
  \>He takes a sip of water and grabs your hand with his other arm.
  \>"The touch, it's so... nice. Uh...," he looks at you, "do you wanna, heh, cuddle?"
  \>You're still kinda drunk, but he probably is too.
  \>"Sure," you say.
  \>A moment later, you're lying on the sofa, him on top and pressed on you, sharing warmth with you.
  \>"This is so nice."
  \>"What, you've never...?"
  \>"Oh, I have, I just always forget how pleasant it is."
  \>"You're nice to cuddle with, too."
  \>"Really? I imagine the spikes don't help much."
  \>"They add to the appeal," you say, making him giggle.
