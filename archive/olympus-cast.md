##Major Secondary Characters

>Marie Karmenov (Pheme)

Atë's only current ally, a tech-savvy conspiracy-theory peddler and incarnation of the titaness of rumors, Pheme. While seemingly lacking in combat capacity, she makes up for it with top-notch surveillance capabilities and the talents of a natural schemer. 

>Jane Matthews: (Ceryneian Hind) [Deceased]

A dorky former track star with a love for Gundam almost as great as her love for... someone who never existed.

Three entered the grounds of her execution, and only one left.

A former member of the German police and Braun's past and future right hand man. Maintaining a chipper and playful demeanor despite the brutal realities of their line of work, Chen serves as both the heart and the muscle of Braun's task force.

Rosa was taken in by Braun and Chen after she was caught in the wake of her showdown with the incarnation who killed her mother.

##<Spawn of Discord>

>Ashley Lambert (Eris)

Once the object of countless envious gazes, her life and outlook changed completely upon her disfigurement. Now, spiteful, insecure, but still wracked with narcissism, she plans to bring the entire world to its knees after decimating the population. Despite her misanthropic tendencies, she seems to gravitate towards people she sees as kindred spirits. De facto leader of the pantheon.

>Jennifer Byrne (Neikos)

Oldest of the pantheon (but still younger than 40), Jen is Eris's right-hand woman. However, she shares Ashley's narcissism and would likely pounce at any opportunity to take her throne. Incarnation of a <Plural> daimon of quarrels.

>Saanvi (Pseudologos)

She claims to be an Indian national who immigrated to France at an early age, but you can't trust a thing she says, not even her name. A serial fraudster and exceptional liar, it's very difficult to ascertain the truths from the lies when it comes to her. Incarnation of a <Plural> daimon of deception.

>Isabella Lopez-Colón (Amphillogos)

Despite what one might expect from a war profiteer and incarnation of conflict, Isabella has a warm, empathetic demeanor which, while she can usually ensure no detrimental effects upon the mission, gives the other members some pause. While you aren't intimately familiar with her abilities, she seems to be something of a combat specialist based on her words and demonstrated abilities.

>Dorota (Algos)

The sado-masochistic incarnation of the goddess of suffering. While the extent of her abilities is unknown, her primary abilities seem to be tentacles that induce excruciating pain in the target and exemplary regenerative capabilities. She creates a sense of foreboding or discomfort in most who interact with her, you included, but she seems to be quite fond of you.

>Helena Preisinger (Lethe)

Once old and senile, Helena regained her youth and vitality at the cost of her memories when she became the incarnation of the incarnation of the river Lethe. She has been working for the Austrian government, wiping the memories of problematic individuals. She has not joined the Pantheon.
