DNI / [back](https://rentry.co/byakuyatogami)

-> basic dni criteria, pro/comshippers, thinspo, ed/shtwt, ddlg, anti agere, anti recovery, those freakstarries, if you negatively generalize large groups of people (ex. "cishets dni", "oh.. yourw white, dni"), overly critical, "cutegore" gorecore likers <-

->these are more personal ones but fans that dumb their faves or any character down into one fandom joke and dont actually delve into the character PISS OFF pjsekai fans are on thin ice most of the time just be normal <-

-> its very hard for me to actually "hate" someone and at most ill just be very irritated, dont be an asshole or a weirdo and we shouldnt have a problem <-
