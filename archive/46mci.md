!!!note -> 🪶  **Library (of /who/LEXandria as anon coined it)**  🪶 <-
    Here's the list of all the multimedia projects that /who/ collectively worked on for the past year, relative to Mumei - be it streams, outright content or proper creations from anons that are not artworks. It is not only limited to her karaokes, a list of recommendation for the newfriends or a list of collabs that happened in the other holomems channels - you're going to also find the tools in order to record said karaokes and twitterspaces if such occurrences happen in the future (they will and you're going to need it).

!!!Warning Some of the pages and links are not completely up to date.
