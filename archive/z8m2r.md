# Anon.Doofus Cards - Volume Four, Card Spec v1. Ultra WIP.
***
->**[Full Card Collection, v2 Cards](https://rentry.org/dpg2w)**<-
->**[Volume One, v1 Cards](https://rentry.co/d4gkb2) **<-
->**[Volume Two, v1 Cards](https://rentry.co/29rvk)**<-

->**Update: So I had a HDD fail a little while ago; recovered the vast majority of my data easily enough, and some from backups. What I didn't get back was almost all my World Infos. (ᗒᗣᗕ). I *did* have an old version in my notes for the Goblin Tribe but lost the Unease & Voracity one completely. Shouldn't delay these any at least; it's the SD gens that take the longest to do.**<-
***
->**Will have two bonus cards, exclusive to Rentry. Probably won't share my RPG/CYOA/Whatever cards outside of Rentry too tbh, doubt most people on CharHub give a shit about those styles of card.**<-
->**Using a new format/layout for writing these. All the ones I've written thus far have ended up at 2k tokens; it's just too easy to stuff it full of detail. 〣( ºΔº )〣**<-

->**Not including example chatlogs, I doubt anyone ever bothered to read them.**<-

->**{{User}} is usually defined in the Scenario - change if you want.**<-

	`ToA inspired. The Dullahan lass in that game is a cutie pie.`

![](TODO) 3301 Tokens 2114 Permanent)

>Optimize. Turbo is a bastard.

>Next up.
***

###### Anthro 1
Male Anthro
    `I checked back in on "Powerless" by Scolexxx a little while ago, the scenes with the Anubis lads in that are pretty good; hence this.`

>Snobby anthro bloke belittles (You)?
>>Not even started.
***

###### Mocha Waifu
Female - Local chocolate cutie wants to date and snuggle.

![](TODO) 1400 Tokens (777 Permanent)

>The quirk of this card is like 60% of the tokens. May move to world info; the 'risk' of people not running it kinda ruins the whole intent. Turbo 16k *kinda* makes token counts irrelevant, but still; I need to get out of this bad habit of xbox-huge permanent tokens of mine. ~~literally never going to happen lmao.~~
***

###### Pizza Delivery Boi
Femboy - Local slutty delivery boi.

![](TODO) 668 Tokens (670 Permanent)

>Saviourfag a sad boi?
>>Flesh out.
***

###### Raenalis
Futa Dragon Monster Girl - Sneak into a old fort looking for plunder, try to not wake up the dragon living inside.
	`Do an Anthro Fork?`
![](TODO) 3590 Tokens (1999 Permanent)

>Last I tested this; Turbo refused completely to work with the intended quirk/narrative - dropping it would save a few hundred permanent tokens. Try simplifying it first.
>>Optimize.
***

###### Twi'Lek
Futa Twi'Lek Slave - Flirty and ~~Humble~~ Bold; loves (You) for being a good master.
   `Smaller token count than usual, since I can just tell the AI to use it's own knowledge on the existing IP rather than telling it what to do for one.`
![](TODO) 1050 Tokens (1050 Permanent)

>A friend of mine was trying to get me into that old Star Wars MMO recently, Vette a qt 3.14.
>>Mostly done, I think.
***

###### Togruta
Fem Dommy Tomboy - Bounty Hunter trying to blow off some steam, buy her a drink and try your luck?
   `See above - may create a location World Info for the two to both use, since I was lazy and set them both on SWTORs Dromond Kaas.`
![](TODO) 970 Tokens (970 Permanent)

>Totally unrelated to above, I ain't been fucking around with Star Wars shit recently - Had this character sitting around in my old DAZ Studio setups, gonna flesh it out for a card.
>>Mostly done, I think.
***

###### PokéMILF Gang (temp name).
	`There was a "Pandora's Forest" RPG here. It's gone now.`
![](TODO) 1842 Tokens (1233 Permanent)

>I've decided to replace the RPG; with either a Anthro Pokémon MILF harem thing. Arceus needs (You) to fix a problem for them, but never bothered telling you what it was. The local Pokémon are a bit odd, but friendly enough. Alt. Greeting/s for a less friendly group of Mons. Uses SillyTavern's {{random}} for which Mon you meet initially.
>>Using this [Pokédex Lorebook](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/drcubone12/pokedex) is probably not needed, but I would just in case. Turbo knows the ones I tested, but gets confused pretty often; the world info helps somewhat.
***

###### Unease & Voracity, CYOA
	`Fear & Hunger inspired dungeon crawler. (You) get maimed, raped and murdered.`
![](TODO) 2476 Tokens (1551 Permanent)

>The World Info I wrote died with my old HDD; need to rewrite it completely.
>>Not the end of the world, If I remember right it was just Defs+Classes for {{User}} characters. Annoying, but could do without.
***

###### Bonus Card: Bimbo Kui-Tan
Futa Bimbo Kui-Tan - Return home after a hard day of *something*! Be greeted by the lusty dumbass  who lives with you!
![](TODO) 1549 Tokens (1169 Permanent)

>Written up whilst excessively horny, based entirely off a random image of Bimbo Kiro from TiTS. I'd never actually tried any of her bimbo content until after writing the card, and was fairly unimpressed tbh. Simple smutbot.

***

###### Bonus Card: Seraphim
Futa Angel - (You) died. Get judged by a unorthodox and old-testament inclined Seraphim.
    `I'm not religious. Don't bully me, or call me a gnostic (whatever the fuck that means); for including references to Dante's Divine Comedy, I thought it was funny to have a literal Angel be a fan of his work.`
![](TODO) 3590 Tokens (1923 Permanent)

>Similar to the above; written while being horny. Based on an ancient Modeseven pic, I have no idea what the context, if any, is for the image, but I think it's cockvore; so that's an option here.
>>Yes, the token count, I know. I got a **little** carried away with what was supposed to be a simple smutbot.
***

###### Bonus Shitpost Card: Unnamed Femboy
Femboy - Local Alt-Right Femboy, e-Thot and hopeful Tradwife; wants to educate (You) on how der Juden are to blame for everything.

![](TODO) 1636 Tokens (847 Permanent)

>In a nice chance of pace, this was written while I was drunk instead of horny. I was lurking /wsg/ and came across [this webm.](https://files.catbox.moe/4ydtrv.webm) I apparently found this amusing enough to make a card based on it.
