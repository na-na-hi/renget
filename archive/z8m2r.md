->**[Volume Two, v1 Cards](https://rentry.co/29rvk)**<-
->**[Volume Three, v1 Cards](https://rentry.org/gikdw)**<-
***
->**Will have two bonus cards, exclusive to Rentry. Probably won't share my RPG/CYOA/Whatever cards outside of Rentry too tbh, doubt most people on CharHub give a shit about those styles of card.**<-
->**Using a new format/layout for writing these. All the ones I've written thus far have ended up at 2k tokens; it's just too easy to stuff it full of detail. 〣( ºΔº )〣**<-
