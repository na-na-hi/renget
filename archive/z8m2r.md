->**07/09/23: 5 WIPs uploaded. Klymhessa, Ilofa, Cillamuna, Kheoloee, Cervoel. | I would very much like feedback on them, particularly outside OAI models.**<-
>probably put 1 or 2 up *tomorrow*. >uploads over two weeks later.
***
->**19/08/23: Not going to support v1 Card Spec anymore, pain in the arse. Just going to put WIPs up here every now and then when I'm mostly happy with them, probably put 1 or 2 up tomorrow.**<-

->**19/08/23: Picking these up again soon. I rewrote/saved the world info and everything else a while back. Need to finish writing 3 or 4, and pickout a name for a few; otherwise just art to do. I seriously need to figure out a better workflow or something for doing SD gens, takes forever to get results I'm even remotely happy with.**<-
***
->**Update: So I had a HDD fail a little while ago; recovered the vast majority of my data easily enough, and some from backups. What I didn't get back was almost all my World Infos. (ᗒᗣᗕ). I *did* have an old version in my notes for the Goblin Tribe but lost the Unease & Voracity one completely. Shouldn't delay these any at least; it's the SD gens that take the longest to do.**<-
***
->**Will have ~~two~~ some bonus cards, exclusive to Rentry. Probably won't share my RPG/CYOA/Whatever cards outside of Rentry too tbh, doubt most people on CharHub give a shit about those styles of card.**<-
->**Using a new format/layout for writing these. All the ones I've written thus far have ended up at 2k tokens; it's just too easy to stuff it full of detail. 〣( ºΔº )〣**<-
***
->**Not including example chatlogs, I doubt anyone ever bothered to read them.**<-

###### Klymhessa
Futa Dullahan - Have a fight, go on a date, fuck her, get fucked... 
	`ToA. The Dullahan lass in that game is a cutie pie.`

![](https://files.catbox.moe/o3xq0y.png) 3301 Tokens (2114 Permanent)

>Optimize.
>>Turbo is a bastard. The 'quirk' of her either being a head without a body, or a bodyless head; doesn't work reliably with Turbo; lots of the head trying to move around by itself or the body giving you a look, that sort of thing. Annoying, but not the end of the world; inflated the token count hugely trying to fix it if I remember right.
***

###### Ilofa
Fem Gobbo Shaman - Wants you to breed her; and her Tribe!
	`Based on an idea I originally had for Amarlieve's world info.`

![](https://files.catbox.moe/waraxc.png) 2118 Tokens (1455 Permanent)

>Shared World Info with Tired Succubus, several side-characters for both the Goblins and Succubae. Currently 3190 Tokens across 16 entries, 9 extra characters.
>>World Info should be embedded, only lightly tested. 

***

###### Very Tired Succubus (todo: rename)
Fem Succubus - Very tired Succubus reluctantly manages a farm; help her relieve some stress, do her job, or just fuck around with her awful employees.
	`Based on an idea I originally had for Amarlieve's world info.`

![](TODO) 1391 Tokens (1395 Permanent)

[todo: World Info](todo)
>See above.
***

###### Cillamuna
Futa Equine - *Big* girl with **big peepee**. Feminization or Bimboification, Size Difference. 

![](https://files.catbox.moe/68bodi.png) 4353 Tokens (2085 Permanent)

>(You) interview for a job as a helper to a needy Mare, with a few extra job requirements and perks.
>>Optimize.
***

###### Kheolea
Female - Local chocolate cutie wants to date and snuggle.

![](https://files.catbox.moe/cp4ldq.png) 2946 Tokens (2323 Permanent)
	`1400 Tokens (777 Permanent) if pruned to use World Info instead; need to check how viable that is.`
>Somewhat similar to Hariera. Not the same type of content, but the same meta-theme. *hink hink wink wink nudge nudge*.
***

###### Pizza Delivery Boi
Femboy - Local slutty delivery boi.

![](TODO) 709 Tokens (711 Permanent)

>Saviourfag a sad boi?
>>Flesh out.
***

###### Raenalis
Futa Dragon Monster Girl - Sneak into a old fort looking for plunder, try to not wake up the dragon living inside.
	`Do an Anthro Fork?`
![](TODO) 3600 Tokens (2005 Permanent)

>Last I tested this; Turbo refused completely to work with the intended quirk/narrative - dropping it would save a few hundred permanent tokens. Try simplifying it first.
>>Optimize, Turbo is **a bastard**.
***

###### Togruta
Fem Dommy Tomboy - Bounty Hunter trying to blow off some steam, buy her a drink and try your luck?
   `See above - may create a location World Info for the two to both use, since I was lazy and set them both on SWTORs Dromond Kaas.`
![](TODO) 963 Tokens (966 Permanent)

>Totally unrelated to above, I ain't been fucking around with Star Wars shit recently - Had this character sitting around in my old DAZ Studio setups, gonna flesh it out for a card.
>>Mostly done, I think.
***

###### Twi'Lek
Futa Twi'Lek Slave - Flirty and ~~Humble~~ Bold; loves (You) for being a good master.
   `Smaller token count than usual, since I can just tell the AI to use it's own knowledge on the existing IP rather than telling it what to do for one.`
![](TODO) 1315 Tokens (1318 Permanent)

>A friend of mine was trying to get me into that old Star Wars MMO recently, Vette a qt 3.14.
>>Mostly done, I think.
***

###### Anubisian (todo: rename)
Male Anthro Jackal.
    `I checked back in on "Powerless" by Scolexxx a little while ago, the scenes with the Anubis lads in that are pretty good; hence this.`
![](TODO) 1707 Tokens (1709 Permanent)

>Snobby anthro bloke belittles (You)?
>>Still WIP.
***
###### PokéMILF Gang (temp name).
	`There was a "Pandora's Forest" RPG here. It's gone now, somewhat reused for Very Tired Succubus.`
![](TODO) 1844 Tokens (1230 Permanent)

>I've decided to replace the Pandora's Forest RPG; with a Anthro Pokémon MILF harem thing. Arceus needs (You) to fix a problem for them, but never bothered telling you what it was. The local Pokémon are a bit odd, but friendly enough. Alt. Greeting for a less friendly group of Mons. Uses SillyTavern's {{random}} for which Mon you meet initially.
>>Using this [Pokédex Lorebook](https://www.chub.ai/lorebooks/drcubone12/pokedex) is probably not needed, but I would just in case. Turbo knows the ones I tested, but gets confused pretty often; the world info helps somewhat.
***

###### Unease & Voracity, CYOA
	`Fear & Hunger inspired dungeon crawler. (You) get maimed, raped and murdered.`
![](TODO) 2581 Tokens (1654 Permanent)

>The World Info I wrote died with my old HDD; need to rewrite it completely.
>>Not the end of the world, If I remember right it was just Defs+Classes for {{User}} characters. Annoying, but could do without.
***

***

###### Bonus Card: Bimbo Kui-Tan
Futa Bimbo Kui-Tan - Return home after a hard day of *something*! Be greeted by the lusty dumbass who lives with you!
![](TODO) 1548 Tokens (1168 Permanent)

>Written up whilst excessively horny, based entirely off a random image of Bimbo Kiro from TiTS. I'd never actually tried any of her bimbo content until after writing the card, and was fairly unimpressed tbh. Simple smutbot.

***

###### Bonus Card: Cervoel
Futa Angel - (You) died. Get judged by a unorthodox and old-testament inclined Seraphim.
    `I'm not religious. Don't bully me, or call me a gnostic (whatever the fuck that means); for including references to Dante's Divine Comedy, I thought it was funny to have a literal Angel be a fan of his work.`
![](https://files.catbox.moe/39tvw0.png) 3590 Tokens (1923 Permanent)

>Similar to the above; written while being horny. Based on an ancient Modeseven pic, I have no idea what the context, if any, is for the image, but I think it's cockvore; so that's an option here.
>>Yes, the token count, I know. I got a **little** carried away with what was supposed to be a simple smutbot.
***

###### Bonus Card: Princess Rescue Quest
Female, Princess. (You) need to rescue a kidnapped Damsel.

![](TODO) 1822 Tokens (1717 Permanent)
[todo: World Info](todo) | Fairly small, just a optimization to cut down on token counts, relates to the "ending" you get when saving the Princess.
***

###### Shitpost Card: Unnamed Femboy
Femboy - Local Alt-Right Femboy, e-Thot and hopeful Tradwife; wants to educate (You) on how der Juden are to blame for everything.

![](TODO) 2773 Tokens (1534 Permanent)
    `how the fuck is this 1.5k tokens?`
>In a nice chance of pace, this was written while I was drunk instead of horny. I was lurking /wsg/ and came across [this webm.](https://files.catbox.moe/4ydtrv.webm) I apparently found this amusing enough to make a card based on it.
