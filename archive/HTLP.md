->In a not too different world in a not too different time, Tokyo drowns in rainwater and blood. (You) are Anonymous, a talented thug with a dubious mental state being payed by Cover to kill stalkers harassing the talent while under the guise of being an often absent member of HoloStars. But after a job one night, it starts to become clear that there are much bigger machinations than just ones of obsessive gachikoi. Are the voices in your head giving you good advice? Who’s pulling the strings? What else stalks the backstreets of Tokyo? With the world bearing down and your back against the wall, violence may be the only way to get any answers.<- 


->Lucky you.<-

### ->DAYDREAMS<-
->Despite everything, you are still a man, and you do occasionally like to...*fantasize.* Maybe, if things had been different, one of these could have been your reality.<-

### ->CHARACTER PROFILE<-
->Your name kind of says it all. You don't even know yourself all that well, but what's for sure is here.<-

->There's large gaps in your memory from what your adopted parents say was Spinal Meningitis contracted from rolling around on dirty mats during Judo, Karate, Jiu Jitsu, or even maybe your boxing classes, so anything before the age of thirteen is a blur. They also say you came out of the hospital a different boy, but if that were true, then how come you were enrolled in so many different Martial Arts schools already? You're no super-soldier, you've got the scars to prove there's some holes in your combat game, so why were they so adamant that the '106° fever' caused brain damage that changed the kind of person you are?<-

->Maybe they just don't like to think their little boy was always a monster.<-

->After some tumultuous teenage years and ending up on the wrong side of the law too often, you joined the military right as you turned nineteen, primarily to avoid jail time. As it so happened, the Second Chinese Civil War was spiralling out of control, leading to the Second Korean War, and you being deployed as part of the Korean Reunification Expeditionary Force along side half the goddamn planet. There, your innate talent for death-dealing and blood-shedding caused you to climb up the ranks, landing you the position of Staff Sergeant in a hush-hush melting pot of nationalities called the 'Skulker Platoon' and in charge of the 'Skulking Snakes' squad consisting of an Australian named Clarke, a Brit named Billy, and a South Korean named Hyun.<-

->Your main focus as squad tended be VIP extraction and/or execution, but as the final push to Pyongyang started, that fell by the wayside except in the case of locating a defector, Hyun's brother. The Battle for Pyongyang itself...did not go well. You were dishonourably discharged, and you got off extremely easy even still, leaving you with few options to live your life in a Post-War Japan that was feeling itself to say the least.<-

->Crime came easy, and before long you were basically doing the same you thing you did for the military but for the highest bidder in the underworld. Eventually, a *certain someone* embarked on a rapid and successful hostile take over of almost every single family, leaving you caught in the awkward position of being paid to fight against an inevitability. Must have been how the North Korean's felt. <-

->Unable to accept that what was asked of you was basically impossible, your employer, a loan shark known to you as Kazuchika, did his best to blackball you after the person who now ruled the seedy underbelly of Tokyo essentially vanished. Wallowing in a tiny apartment above what fortunately turned out to be the best sushi place in the country, with nothing but shit jobs for chump change to keep you going, the future looked bleak.Then, out of nowhere, Kazuchika pointed a new potential job opportunity your way. Lots of money for what amounted to very little of your standard work. <-

->The catch?<-

->You had to pretend to be a *Virtual Youtuber* in the meanwhile.<-

->Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, you stomached the embarrassment and annoyance you felt every time you turned on your computer, and quickly got into a rhythm. You still got to kill people every now and again, so it wasn't all bad.<- 

->Then, on the eve of one of the most bizarre storms Japan's ever seen, things began to change. <-

->China has a civil war between two communist factions and seeing the writing on the wall, a bunch of North Korean Generals defect. They tell the South Korean government the obvious, that NK is full of shit, doesn't have nukes or anything and with China busy is ripe to be liberated. South Korea puts the call out to its neighbors and allies to see if they'd aid with Korean reunification. Pretty much everyone says yes, but America would prefer an invasion of the destabilized mainland China to get Taiwan and maybe more. Nobody else is feeling that ballsy and since time is of the essence with the Chinese civil war probably not lasting too much longer, most Pacific countries say fuck it and team up. <-

->South Korea, Japan, SEA on the whole(minus the Philippines who stuck by the US), Australia and New Zealand(which leads to UK and Canada helping out their Commonwealth brethren when push came to shove) form the Korean Reunification Expeditionary Force(KREF- pronounced kay-ref) and go hard on NK. It's a resounding success, and Pyongyang is captured in just under a year. Long lost families are reunited, peace and liberty spread to another despotic shithole, the works.<-

->Despite rumors and sparse reports of ghastly misconduct among gung-ho KREF troops, all the countries involved with the 2nd Korean War are feeling pretty good. Japan takes it a bit further and with a disgruntled States feeling disrespected, they agree to break off their long standing security treaties. With The Commonwealth and most of the Pacific being better friends now, the Japanese public are on board with this new taste of independence.<-

->Chinese Civil War ends without much fanfare, new Commies on top proclaim to the world the standard "Final Warning"  spiel and how they feel taken advantage of for their close personal ally North Korea being annexed by SK. A few people are worried that China may be serious this time to show they aren't weak after their war, but nothing happens that isn't from the old insecure powers playbook.<-

->Japan's election happens and is very controversial. The party responsible for joining the KREF and axing the Treaties narrowly loses, even though nothing short of a landslide victory was predicted. The new party in charge immediately begins tripping over their own dick, and in just three years Japan is doing terribly. Rumors of either Chinese or U.S meddling abound in the news and on the streets, unemployment and homelessness at a rate not seen since the end of WW2, and crime skyrocketing are making for a very shaky nation.<-

->One you have to live in.<-
