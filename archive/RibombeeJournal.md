####Introduction

My name is Booker—once a human, now a Ribombee.

Recently, I awoke from uneasy dreams to find myself transformed into an adorable insect. Not only that, I had somehow been transported to a place I once thought was only a work of fiction: the world of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. At first, it was a frightening situation, but things improved when I met a certain Sneasel. Although she was rather brash and headstrong, we quickly became best friends and partners due to our shared interest in getting stronger.

After traversing a forest full of feral monsters, we set out to the town of Capim. There, we unexpectedly meet a large group of other humans who had also been brought here and transformed into various Pokemon creatures, just like me. We quickly decided to form a group called the Clover Guild to stick together, support one another, and make a living by doing good deeds in this new world. Along the way, we also hoped to learn why we all came here in the first place.

At the time I’m writing this, I’ve been with the Clover Guild for about three months. Every day here has been exciting. Being a timid introvert, that isn’t exactly to my liking. But to my surprise, I’ve found that I don’t mind it. I’m definitely having more fun here than I ever did on Earth, and making more friends than I had as a human. And even though I dearly miss my family, along with many of the conveniences of modern human civilization, I’m still enjoying this new and unexpected phase of my life.

To commemorate all this, and make sure nothing is forgotten, I decided to start writing about my everyday life. I’ve already written several larger accounts of more important events, like when I first met Sneasel, when I tried to build a slingshot, or when I set out on a quest to learn to fly with my new wings. But I feel like some other incidents, despite being less significant than the rest, still deserve a mention. I’ll attempt to write these in order, as they happen, but I may add new entries out of order if I remember something from an earlier date that I missed. Either way, I’ll try to be as accurate as possible in recounting things.

So, without further ado... I present this work-in-progress anthology of short stories to anyone who’s able to read my tiny handwriting. Whether you’re a human like me, or a native Pokemon like Sneasel, I hope you enjoy reading about the assorted things that have happened to me during my time at Capim.

It was a sweltering day early in summer, and I felt terrible. My insect body couldn’t regulate its temperature very well, so now that the weather was getting hotter, it was crucial (yet difficult) for me to stay cool. Fortunately, my partner Sneasel could help with that. As an Ice-type, her body constantly exuded a faint cold energy, so simply staying in contact with her (such as sitting on her head, my typical perch) felt nice. However, this world lacked such wonderful climate-controlling technologies as air conditioning, and Capim Town was located in the subtropics. So even with Sneasel’s help, it was sure to be an unpleasant summer.

“Unpleasant” certainly was the right word for how I felt this day, the first truly hot one of the year. Sneasel and I needed to travel around the town to complete some guild-assigned errands, and the angry sun refused to stop beating down on us. My wings and antennae drooped. My head ached. I felt weak and lethargic all over. Even Sneasel was uncomfortable, judging by her occasional frustrated grumbles and bouts of panting. Her natural ice abilities could only help her cool off to an extent. And having spent most of her life on a remote frozen island near the north pole, she wasn’t accustomed to this sort of climate.

Halfway through running our errands, she decided it was necessary to stop by a frozen dessert shop for some help keeping cool. I agreed, and we went right for the closest one. The small store was built into a tree like most other buildings in Capim. Multiple customers were gathered outside, sitting on benches or rocks as they ate, and there was a line going out the door. This was clearly a popular spot. But Sneasel knew this place, and insisted it was worth the wait, so I resisted the urge to complain.

After silently suffering in the summer heat for a while, we finally got inside. The shop’s interior was mercifully cooler than outdoors, though it was small and cramped. It only had a few seats and tables, all taken. At the other end of the shop, I saw a Snover behind a row of a half dozen earthenware jars. Each jar sat on a block of ice, all held in a long wooden tray to catch any ice that melted into water. A sign hanging above the row displayed paintings of multiple tropical fruits, explaining the flavors on offer. I frowned deeply as I realized I didn’t like any of them. Sneasel would surely find something to enjoy—she loved tropical flavors—but I would likely have to skip out.

And my frown grew even more as I watched Snover blow a gust of frigid air over the ice blocks to keep them from melting entirely. The sight made me shiver and realize another problem I’d neglected to consider until now. Just like how my Ribombee body couldn’t tolerate hot or cold weather well, it was possible that these ice-cold treats would be too much for me to handle. I could get hurt by eating something like this. Still, I didn’t speak up, not wanting to bring down Sneasel’s mood.

When it was our turn to order, Sneasel said to Snover, “Gimme one of those mango sorbets. Booker, what do you want?”

“Um... nothing, I’m good,” I said.

“You sure? You’re feeling hot, right? I’m buying, so you can get whatever you want. You’ve gotta keep cool.”

“No, it’s fine. I can stay cool enough just sitting on your head.”

Sneasel shrugged. She paid for her mango sorbet and took it outside. She sat on a nearby bench, and started messily eating her food. She never did have good table manners. At least she made sure to keep her head steady so I wouldn’t fall off.

As she ate, the sun resumed its assault on me with a vengeance. With a slight groan, I got on all fours and leaned forward over Sneasel’s forehead, peering down at her dessert. I was now second-guessing my decision to skip getting anything. Even if it was dangerously cold, and not a flavor I liked, it looked especially appealing right now.

My partner seemed to notice me moving around. She asked, “You sure you don’t want any?”

“I’m kind of worried it’s too cold for me,” I replied.

Sneasel chuckled. “Huh? You’re telling me you’re afraid of a little dessert? C’mon, I’m sure it’ll be fine if you just eat a little bit. Have some of mine. I don’t mind.”

“Well, another problem is: I’m not really a fan of mango.”

“Really? How long’s it been since you tried it?”

“A couple years.”

“That long? Maybe you’ll change your mind if you try it again. Also, you’re not a human anymore, so maybe it’ll be different now.”

She had a point. After becoming a Ribombee, my new favorite foods were nectar and pollen, despite the fact that I’d never eaten them as a human. I’d also noticed I appreciated fruits even more than I had before transforming. As a result, I’d come to the conclusion that Ribombee naturally gravitated to sweeter foods like nectar, pollen, and fruit. Despite that, I’d avoided any fruits I used to dislike during my time as a human. That list included mango. Still, with a combination of Sneasel’s friendly encouragement and sun’s relentless heat, I finally decided to give the frozen treat a try.

“W-well, if it’s alright with you,” I said, “I guess I can try some. I’ll try not to take too much, though. I want to make sure you have enough for yourself.”

“Seriously?” Sneasel said with a laugh. “I eat more in one bite than you eat in a whole meal. Don’t worry about it.”

She brought up a hand to the top of her head. I climbed onto her palm, then she brought me down alongside the orange-colored dessert. Despite being half-eaten, it was still bigger than any bowl of sorbet I’d ever seen, which was both intimidating and amusing. I looked at it with some hesitation, then used my fingerless hands to scoop up a large chunk from one spot Sneasel hadn’t reached yet. It felt somewhat rougher than ice cream, and not as moist. It also didn’t seem as cold as I feared. Maybe my exoskeleton was providing some insulation against it. In any case, the cold sensation made it seem even more appealing. I braced myself and took a small bite of the dessert.

I froze—not because it was cold, but because it tasted so unbelievably delicious. The sweet citrus flavor was clearly recognizable as mango, and I could tell it was the same thing I disliked as a human, but now it seemed to trigger a totally different response in my brain. I held it in my mouth and savored it. Sneasel was right: my new body had actually changed my flavor preferences. That was slightly disturbing, as if I had lost a part of myself. But that feeling passed quickly. I had changed in some ways, sure, but I was still me deep down. Besides, gaining the ability to appreciate more flavors and foods was undeniably a benefit.

Not only that, but the coldness of the dessert washed through my body in a soothing wave, even more effective than the ambient chill radiating off Sneasel. I felt the sweltering rays of the sun fade away, beaten back by the sorbet. Best of all, it didn’t cause me any pain. The cold food and the hot sun appeared to be balancing each other out, helping to maintain my body temperature at a perfectly acceptable level.

All these thoughts ran through my head as the sorbet melted in my mouth. I swallowed it, and despite my best efforts, I couldn’t stop myself from gobbling up the rest of my handful in record time. I immediately regretted it, and flinched as I prepared for a painful brain freeze. But nothing happened—another effect of my new anatomy, perhaps? Maybe bugs were immune to brain freeze.

“Are you okay?” Sneasel asked.

I looked over at her, struggled not to laugh as I finally noticed the messy spots of sorbet clinging to her snout, and answered, “Yeah. I was worried it’d give me brain freeze, but I’m good. And the sorbet’s good too! A lot better than I expected.”

“See? I knew I was right. It’s good to try new things, huh?”

“Yeah. Thanks for the encouragement. I’m glad I tried this out.” I smirked, and added, “Oh... speaking of trying new things, that reminds me. You still need to try spinach sometime.”

Sneasel looked away and gagged. “Never. You couldn’t pay me to eat that stuff.”

I chuckled and scooped up another chunk of the dessert. “Yeah, yeah, I was kidding. Anyway, we should definitely come back here sometime.”

“Totally. But next time, you’re paying.”

“That’s fine,” I mumbled, my mouth full of delicious, soothing sorbet. “I’d even pay extra for this.”

I hadn’t planned to sleep in the garden, but I must have dozed off, because I was suddenly woken up by the creaking of a gate. I sat upright on my large cluster of blue hydrangeas—my impromptu bed—and looked around to get my bearings as my drowsiness wore off.

The afternoon sun still shined brightly up above, so I could tell I hadn’t drifted off for long. The guildhall loomed not too far away, and my partner Sneasel sat by the pond nearby, practicing using her elemental powers to form ice shards in different shapes. The garden around us was filled with planter boxes and flowerbeds that hosted a wide variety of foliage, mainly flowers of many species and colors, alongside an array of berry bushes. A complex mix of pleasant floral scents filled the air, making my antennae flick and wave about on their own. Cobblestone paths weaved through it all, and wooden poles stood at attention in various spots, each bearing an unlit lantern.

The unexpected sound of the gate was the only thing that broke the tranquility. Having slipped fully out of my slumber, I looked in the gate’s direction. Sneasel was doing the same, absentmindedly clawing at a chunk of ice while looking over her shoulder. From where I sat, I couldn’t see the gate itself, but I vaguely sensed two unfamiliar Auras approaching. I wondered who was coming. The anxious part of me believed they were intruders or troublemakers, but I tried to ignore that fear.

I got my answer soon enough, and it was not as bad as I had thought: a Minun and Raichu came walking down the path, each carrying a metal watering can and wearing a Clover Guild badge. Sneasel and I had seen these Pokemon once or twice before, but never talked with them. They were new recruits to the guild, so nobody was too familiar with them yet. Minun wore a white lace collar and had a white pansy tucked behind her ear, while Raichu wore a simple blue bandanna around his neck, almost the same shade as Sneasel’s bandanna or the waist cape hanging from the back of my belt.

As they came into view, Sneasel turned around fully and waved. “Sup?” she said. “You’re the new guys, huh?”

“Oh, yeah, we are,” Minun said. “I don’t think we’ve met. You can just call me Minun, and this is my partner Raichu.”

“Call me Sneasel.” Pointing over at me, Sneasel added, “And that there’s my buddy, Booker. We’re partners too.”

The Electric-type duo looked to where Sneasel was pointing. “Huh?” Minun asked. “I don’t see...”

She gasped as she finally noticed me, the tiny Ribombee sitting among the flowers. She scurried over with a gleam in her eye and a huge grin on her face. On my perch, I was about eye level with her. I gulped and shied away as her excited (and big) face filled most of my view.

“Oh, hi!” she said. “I didn’t see you there! Oh my gosh, you’re so cute! You’re a Ribombee, right?”

“Um, I... y-yes,” I stammered. “N-nice to m-meet you.”

“Settle down, Minun,” Raichu said, coming to his partner’s side. He looked down at me, completely unaffected by my admittedly adorable appearance. “You’re scaring the guy.”

“Sorry, I just can’t help it,” she said to her partner. “But you’ve gotta admit he’s cute, right?”

“Sure,” he said flatly, “but I won’t freak out over it. C’mon, we’ve got work to do. Talk to you later, Booker.”

Taking his can, he went to the pond, scooped up water, and began watering the various bushes scattered around.

Minun sighed and looked back at me. She took a step back to give me more space, saying, “Sorry if I made you nervous.”

“I-it’s okay,” I said. “It’s n-not your fault. I’m just... shy. Never liked hav-having attention on me.”

“I understand,” said Minun. Like her partner, she hurried to the pond and filled her can, then came back to my hydrangea bush. She carefully watered it, examining the flowers and continuing to talk with me. “I’ve only visited this garden one time before this, but I loved it. It convinced me and Raichu to sign up as gardeners. So that’s why we’re out here.”

“Th-that’s nice,” I said. I looked down at the globe of blue flowers under me and gave it a pat. “The garden could always use more c-caretakers. You know, I... I helped Team Cozy put this together. Well... i-it was mostly them. I couldn’t really do much, because I’m, uh... so small.”

“Oh, don’t say that,” Minun said. “Every little bit counts, right?”

“I g-guess so...”

Minun smiled. “Exactly. Chin up! Thanks for helping make the garden, Booker. You three did a great job. Hey, Team Cozy is the Chespin and Wooper, right? I bumped into them before, but I didn’t know they made the garden. I should go thank them later.”

“Yeah, th-they’re Team Cozy. Like I said, they did most of the work, but I’m happy I could help out. I’m... I’m glad we made this garden. It’s a nice place, and the berries we grow here are useful in dungeons.”

“And in cooking, I bet,” said Minun.

“True. I prefer the flowers, though. They’re... really pretty. I never used to care for flowers, but now I can’t get enough of them. In fact, this garden is my favorite spot. I like coming here to relax. After the big Federation quest a while back, I spent a whole day just lying here and unwinding. It’s soothing to be around so much beautiful nature.”

“Now you’re speaking my language,” Minun said with a grin. She had moved to the right of my bush, where a multicolored group of lilies were growing. She was examining the white ones intently. “Ooh, these are so elegant. White lilies are some of my favorite flowers. Tiger lilies are great too. They remind me of Raichu. But he prefers more the common, simple flowers like daisies. How about you, Booker?”

“I like them all, honestly,” I replied. “I can’t pick a favorite. Probably because I’m a bug—it’s just instinct, I guess.”

“I heard some bugs can eat flower nectar and pollen, right? Do you do that?”

“Yeah, I do. I can eat other foods, but pollen and nectar are my natural diet, so I have to be careful about straying too far from it, or else I’ll get sick.”

Minun’s ears drooped slightly. “Oh... so you have a really limited diet, huh? That’s too bad.”

“Actually, it’s okay. Every flower has a unique flavor, and it’s fun to try lots of different ones. Especially if they’re rare or foreign.”

“Rare flowers are cool,” Minun said. “Well, then... for both our sakes, I hope we can get many more flowers in our garden! It’ll be lovely for everyone to look at, and you’ll get some tasty treats too.”

I nodded. As I did, I realized with a start that I was smiling. How long had I been doing that? I wasn’t sure, but it was clear that this casual chat was improving my mood. I usually had great trouble talking to new people, always worried I’d say the wrong thing or make a fool of myself. But now, I felt so relaxed. Was it simply because Minun was being friendly? Or because the topic was something I cared about? Either way, it was a welcome change of pace, and it made me smile even more.

Minun had now moved to the next patch of flowers, looking them over as she watered them. After a bit, she asked, “Booker, do you mind if I take a few flowers for my herbarium?”

“Herbarium?” I repeated. “That’s a book where you dry and press flowers, right? You have one of those?”

“Yeah, and it’s coming along well. I haven’t added any flowers from the guild’s garden yet, though. I wanted to ask permission first. And since you helped make the garden, I guess you have authority, right?”

“I’m not sure about that, but... I don’t think anyone would mind if you took some flowers here and there. This is everyone’s garden, after all.”

“Thanks! I’ll search for some pretty ones later.”

“Good luck. Oh, and about your herbarium... do you think you could show it to me sometime? I’d love to see what you have in there!” I caught myself getting a bit excited, and cleared my throat. “Um... if it’s okay with you, of course.”

Minun giggled, saying, “Definitely! It’s in my dorm. Maybe you can swing by later today, if you’ve got time.”

“I think I can do that. Sneasel and I already did a mission today, so we have the rest of the day off. Thanks, Minun.”

“Anything for a fellow flower lover! Anyway, I’ve gotta water the rest of these plants. Raichu’s probably done five times as much as me—he works fast.”

“Please don’t rush,” I said. “Enjoy your time in the garden.”

“I will,” said Minun. Giving me a wink, she said cheerily, “See you, Booker!”

I waved goodbye, and off she went, continuing her work. Once she was out of sight, Sneasel came over and crouched in front of me.

“Made a new friend, huh?” my partner asked.

“Yeah,” I replied. “She seems friendly. And it’s nice having someone else who appreciates flowers.”

Sneasel gave a slight frown. “When you put it like that... do you mean you’re upset that I don’t like flowers?”

“No, definitely not!” I said quickly. “That’s totally fine. To each their own. I actually think it’s cool that we have such different interests, and we still manage to be such great partners.”

“Yeah, you’re right. Good way of looking at it.”

The two of us went quiet and spent a little while basking in the peaceful garden, so full of beautiful flowers. Some distance away, we could see Raichu’s long tail waving around above a berry bush. The faint sounds of him and his partner chatting drifted over to us.

“Y’know, I noticed you acting different with Minun,” said Sneasel. “You were talking a lot more... casually. And you didn’t stutter much either. You weren’t nervous like you usually are with new people.”

I nodded. “Yeah. I noticed that too.”

“Good for you. I’m proud of you.”

I glanced away sheepishly and murmured my thanks. “I think... I think it was because we were chatting about something we both enjoy. It felt... good.”

Sneasel started to say something, but then paused and began avoiding eye contact for some reason. “Um... y’know, anytime you wanna chat about flowers, and Minun ain’t around... feel free to talk with me. I may not be a big fan of flowers like you and her, but I’ll lend an ear anyway. I mean, I... I do enjoy chatting with you.”

“Oh, thanks,” I said. “I like talking with you too. I’ll take you up on your offer sometime.”

“Cool. B-but don’t tell anyone about it, alright? If they heard I was talking about something lame and cutesy like flowers, I’d never live it down.”

I chuckled and nodded. With that, Sneasel went back to the pond to resume her ice practice. I sighed and flopped onto my back, lying on the soft blue hydrangeas and staring up at the clear blue sky. Another smile crossed my face.

“I’m so, so glad we made this garden.”

####Author’s Note

This page will act as a place to compile my small, short, slice-of-life stories featuring Booker. I wanted to set up one spot to hold them instead of scattering them over a large number of pages. I plan to gradually add more and more short stories to this page over time, while larger stories will get their own pages.
