####Introduction

My name is Booker—once a human, now a Ribombee.

Recently, I awoke from uneasy dreams to find myself transformed into an adorable insect. Not only that, I had somehow been transported to a place I once thought was only a work of fiction: the world of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. At first, it was a frightening situation, but things improved when I met a certain Sneasel. Although she was rather brash and headstrong, we quickly became best friends and partners due to our shared interest in getting stronger.

After traversing a forest full of feral monsters, we set out to the town of Capim. There, we unexpectedly meet a large group of other humans who had also been brought here and transformed into various Pokemon creatures, just like me. We quickly decided to form a group called the Clover Guild to stick together, support one another, and make a living by doing good deeds in this new world. Along the way, we also hoped to learn why we all came here in the first place.

At the time I’m writing this, I’ve been with the Clover Guild for about three months. Every day here has been exciting. Being a timid introvert, that isn’t exactly to my liking. But to my surprise, I’ve found that I don’t mind it. I’m definitely having more fun here than I ever did on Earth, and making more friends than I had as a human. And even though I dearly miss my family, along with many of the conveniences of modern human civilization, I’m still enjoying this new and unexpected phase of my life.

To commemorate all this, and make sure nothing is forgotten, I decided to start writing about my everyday life. I’ve already written several larger accounts of more important events, like when I first met Sneasel, when I tried to build a slingshot, or when I set out on a quest to learn to fly with my new wings. But I feel like some other incidents, despite being less significant than the rest, still deserve a mention. I’ll attempt to write these in order, as they happen, but I may add new entries out of order if I remember something from an earlier date that I missed. Either way, I’ll try to be as accurate as possible in recounting things.

So, without further ado... I present this work-in-progress anthology of short stories to anyone who’s able to read my tiny handwriting. Whether you’re a human like me, or a native Pokemon like Sneasel, I hope you enjoy reading about the assorted things that have happened to me during my time at Capim.

It was a sweltering day early in summer, and I felt terrible. My insect body couldn’t regulate its temperature very well, so now that the weather was getting hotter, it was crucial (yet difficult) for me to stay cool. Fortunately, my partner Sneasel could help with that. As an Ice-type, her body constantly exuded a faint cold energy, so simply staying in contact with her (such as sitting on her head, my typical perch) felt nice. However, this world lacked such wonderful climate-controlling technologies as air conditioning, and Capim Town was located in the subtropics. So even with Sneasel’s help, it was sure to be an unpleasant summer.

“Unpleasant” certainly was the right word for how I felt this day, the first truly hot one of the year. Sneasel and I needed to travel around the town to complete some guild-assigned errands, and the angry sun refused to stop beating down on us. My wings and antennae drooped. My head ached. I felt weak and lethargic all over. Even Sneasel was uncomfortable, judging by her occasional frustrated grumbles and bouts of panting. Her natural ice abilities could only help her cool off to an extent. And having spent most of her life on a remote frozen island near the north pole, she wasn’t accustomed to this sort of climate.

Halfway through running our errands, she decided it was necessary to stop by a frozen dessert shop for some help keeping cool. I agreed, and we went right for the closest one. The small store was built into a tree like most other buildings in Capim. Multiple customers were gathered outside, sitting on benches or rocks as they ate, and there was a line going out the door. This was clearly a popular spot. But Sneasel knew this place, and insisted it was worth the wait, so I resisted the urge to complain.

After silently suffering in the summer heat for a while, we finally got inside. The shop’s interior was mercifully cooler than outdoors, though it was small and cramped. It only had a few seats and tables, all taken. At the other end of the shop, I saw a Snover behind a row of a half dozen earthenware jars. Each jar sat on a block of ice, all held in a long wooden tray to catch any ice that melted into water. A sign hanging above the row displayed paintings of multiple tropical fruits, explaining the flavors on offer. I frowned deeply as I realized I didn’t like any of them. Sneasel would surely find something to enjoy—she loved tropical flavors—but I would likely have to skip out.

And my frown grew even more as I watched Snover blow a gust of frigid air over the ice blocks to keep them from melting entirely. The sight made me shiver and realize another problem I’d neglected to consider until now. Just like how my Ribombee body couldn’t tolerate hot or cold weather well, it was possible that these ice-cold treats would be too much for me to handle. I could get hurt by eating something like this. Still, I didn’t speak up, not wanting to bring down Sneasel’s mood.

When it was our turn to order, Sneasel said to Snover, “Gimme one of those mango sorbets. Booker, what do you want?”

“Um... nothing, I’m good,” I said.

“You sure? You’re feeling hot, right? I’m buying, so you can get whatever you want. You’ve gotta keep cool.”

“No, it’s fine. I can stay cool enough just sitting on your head.”

Sneasel shrugged. She paid for her mango sorbet and took it outside. She sat on a nearby bench, and started messily eating her food. She never did have good table manners. At least she made sure to keep her head steady so I wouldn’t fall off.

As she ate, the sun resumed its assault on me with a vengeance. With a slight groan, I got on all fours and leaned forward over Sneasel’s forehead, peering down at her dessert. I was now second-guessing my decision to skip getting anything. Even if it was dangerously cold, and not a flavor I liked, it looked especially appealing right now.

My partner seemed to notice me moving around. She asked, “You sure you don’t want any?”

“I’m kind of worried it’s too cold for me,” I replied.

Sneasel chuckled. “Huh? You’re telling me you’re afraid of a little dessert? C’mon, I’m sure it’ll be fine if you just eat a little bit. Have some of mine. I don’t mind.”

“Well, another problem is: I’m not really a fan of mango.”

“Really? How long’s it been since you tried it?”

“A couple years.”

“That long? Maybe you’ll change your mind if you try it again. Also, you’re not a human anymore, so maybe it’ll be different now.”

She had a point. After becoming a Ribombee, my new favorite foods were nectar and pollen, despite the fact that I’d never eaten them as a human. I’d also noticed I appreciated fruits even more than I had before transforming. As a result, I’d come to the conclusion that Ribombee naturally gravitated to sweeter foods like nectar, pollen, and fruit. Despite that, I’d avoided any fruits I used to dislike during my time as a human. That list included mango. Still, with a combination of Sneasel’s friendly encouragement and sun’s relentless heat, I finally decided to give the frozen treat a try.

“W-well, if it’s alright with you,” I said, “I guess I can try some. I’ll try not to take too much, though. I want to make sure you have enough for yourself.”

“Seriously?” Sneasel said with a laugh. “I eat more in one bite than you eat in a whole meal. Don’t worry about it.”

She brought up a hand to the top of her head. I climbed onto her palm, then she brought me down alongside the orange-colored dessert. Despite being half-eaten, it was still bigger than any bowl of sorbet I’d ever seen, which was both intimidating and amusing. I looked at it with some hesitation, then used my fingerless hands to scoop up a large chunk from one spot Sneasel hadn’t reached yet. It felt somewhat rougher than ice cream, and not as moist. It also didn’t seem as cold as I feared. Maybe my exoskeleton was providing some insulation against it. In any case, the cold sensation made it seem even more appealing. I braced myself and took a small bite of the dessert.

I froze—not because it was cold, but because it tasted so unbelievably delicious. The sweet citrus flavor was clearly recognizable as mango, and I could tell it was the same thing I disliked as a human, but now it seemed to trigger a totally different response in my brain. I held it in my mouth and savored it. Sneasel was right: my new body had actually changed my flavor preferences. That was slightly disturbing, as if I had lost a part of myself. But that feeling passed quickly. I had changed in some ways, sure, but I was still me deep down. Besides, gaining the ability to appreciate more flavors and foods was undeniably a benefit.

Not only that, but the coldness of the dessert washed through my body in a soothing wave, even more effective than the ambient chill radiating off Sneasel. I felt the sweltering rays of the sun fade away, beaten back by the sorbet. Best of all, it didn’t cause me any pain. The cold food and the hot sun appeared to be balancing each other out, helping to maintain my body temperature at a perfectly acceptable level.

All these thoughts ran through my head as the sorbet melted in my mouth. I swallowed it, and despite my best efforts, I couldn’t stop myself from gobbling up the rest of my handful in record time. I immediately regretted it, and flinched as I prepared for a painful brain freeze. But nothing happened—another effect of my new anatomy, perhaps? Maybe bugs were immune to brain freeze.

“Are you okay?” Sneasel asked.

I looked over at her, struggled not to laugh as I finally noticed the messy spots of sorbet clinging to her snout, and answered, “Yeah. I was worried it’d give me brain freeze, but I’m good. And the sorbet’s good too! A lot better than I expected.”

“See? I knew I was right. It’s good to try new things, huh?”

“Yeah. Thanks for the encouragement. I’m glad I tried this out.” I smirked, and added, “Oh... speaking of trying new things, that reminds me. You still need to try spinach sometime.”

Sneasel looked away and gagged. “Never. You couldn’t pay me to eat that stuff.”

I chuckled and scooped up another chunk of the dessert. “Yeah, yeah, I was kidding. Anyway, we should definitely come back here sometime.”

“Totally. But next time, you’re paying.”

“That’s fine,” I mumbled, my mouth full of delicious, soothing sorbet. “I’d even pay extra for this.”

####Author’s Note

This page will act as a place to compile my small, short, slice-of-life stories featuring Booker. I wanted to set up one spot to hold them instead of scattering them over a large number of pages. I plan to gradually add more and more short stories to this page over time, while larger stories will get their own pages.
