### “Jamison?”

If I had the option, I’d have told you the book jumped out of my hand on its own, just to save a little face. I snapped around to find the source of that gravelly sound that had just startled a year off my lifespan.

Thin basketball shorts stretched tightly over tremendous, mouthwatering thighs. A tank top screamed for relief from the stretching torture those heaving pectorals doled. Arms like massive, vascular cannons. Hands that could make a bowling ball look like a milk dud. Raw power given form, and covered every towering inch with grays, browns, whites all coalescing in a way that couldn’t feel more right.

I’d keep going but words just didn’t do that sight justice. At this point I’d probably been staring for long enough to leave a mark. He finally snapped me out of my trance with another rumble from his throat.

“Sorry dude, didn’t mean to startle you. Jamison McElroy, right?” 

“Ja-“ a regrettable voice crack cut me off. “Jamie is fine,” I cleared my throat and did my best to recover, leaning down and grabbing my book off the concrete. “It’s fine, I was just uh, getting to a really scary part.” 

His eyes flicked down, and he grinned crookedly, muttering, “Pride and Prejudice, spooky stuff.”

“Anyways, Jamie,” he continued, sliding smoothly into the bench across the table from me, “I’m Morgan Bishop. You probably know me from Calc, not exactly a classroom full of werewolves, but I know we haven’t really, you know, met.”

I most definitely had noticed him, I most definitely admired from afar, and I most definitely recalled a few instances where our eyes met for fractions of a second across the room and I shyly hoped he didn’t notice. Seeing him up close though was a whole new experience I was not as prepared for as I wanted to fantasize about. The hairs on my arms were aggravatedly on end, and pictures flashed through my head of myself, seared medium and curled foetally on an oversized dinner plate, and of him, grinning comically wide, spilling drool and wielding silverware in clawed fists, pounding the table in anxious excitement as I’m slid down the table to land enticingly before him. 

Was that racist? Probably a little. But fuck, he’s like eight foot and made of razor tipped muscle, I can’t even pretend I’m not terrified of him. 

“I was hoping I could bribe you a little bit. You’ve got the best grades in that class, and me and a few of my bros are, honestly, fucking struggling.” 

Not quite the turn I was expecting, but in my defense I don’t know what I was expecting. I don’t even think my brain had rebooted yet from when he first started talking to me. 

“You want a tutor,” I asked, probably sounding a little more incredulous than intended, seeing the way he shifted his giant blue eyes away and  subtly closed his posture defensively. 

“Kind of, I guess. I mean - you don’t have to.” The way Morgan shrunk so pitifully into himself was really amusing. Crazy, how quickly this behemoth turned into a bashful, blushing fuzzball. Such a bassy voice had no right to turn that timid on a dime.

Seeing his meekness soothed me a bit. He could’ve definitely still tore me to shreds on a whim, and some deep aspect of myself was aware and afraid. A similarly deep aspect was horny as fuck. I tried to keep my head on straight though, and wondering what he considered a bribe, I asked as much. 

“Well, the thing is - we don’t really have any money, but we do have weed and beer though. You can come over to the frat house and chill as long as you want, like really, I wouldn’t care if you stayed all week.”

I don’t drink or smoke. Why on earth was I considering this? 

I didn’t consciously speak, but thankfully words spilled out involuntarily, distracting me from the ache in my crotch that answered my last question. “You have a frat house?” 

“We call it that but it’s more like my apartment my dad pays for that we all live in. We tried to get officiated by Greek Life but they just said we were cringe. That’s all the letter they wrote said, just  ‘Cringe.’ How fucked up is that?”

I spoke up after a moment of fake consideration. I’d already made up my mind. “I’ll help you out.”

“Really? Thank you so much, dude!” Morgan practically shouted, surely drawing a few prying eyes, not that there weren’t enough already with a werewolf sitting at a picnic table in a community garden on a college campus. 

I caught a few glimpses of his fluffy tail swishing behind him. God what I wouldn’t do to yank on it while I- 

“Let me see your phone and I’ll punch in my number and address for you,” he requested, and I felt my stomach drop. I didn’t know exactly how he’d feel about the picture of a particularly photogenic cock I’d found online a few weeks ago. It was just so nice, I even set it as my phone background - But now my hubris had come back to bite me. I did what I could to hide it by just navigating to the ‘Add Contact’ screen before handing him the phone, praying he didn’t accidentally thumb the home button. 

He tapped a few times and handed the phone back with a toothy smile (though, really any smile he made was bound to be toothy,) and I felt like I narrowly avoided being flattened by a speeding car. 

“Tomorrow at two works for you, right?”

“I think so.” 

I knew so. It wasn’t like I had anything better to be doing. It wasn’t like there was anything I’d rather be doing than getting closer to him. 

“Great! I’ll catch you then, bro. Thanks again, Jamie.” He held out his paw to shake, and I was immediately enamored with the soft, warm pads that ever so gently scratched at my palm like ultra fine sandpaper. I wanted him to hold my hand and never let go. Cruel timing on that thought though,  just as he pulled away, nodded his respect and made off. 

I couldn’t stop myself even if there were a gun to my head. Morgan’s ass had its own gravitational pull, and my eyes were lithobraking. I couldn’t even care who saw me staring, the way his ass jiggled with every step was so utterly breathtaking, I didn’t dare look away until he was totally out of sight.

What did I just get myself into?
