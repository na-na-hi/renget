The afternoon had quickly spiraled out of control for Mio.

She'd been cooped up in her kitchen for the past few hours, ping-ponging between various workstations as she struggled to put together an ambitious amount of Valentines Day chocolates for her friends. She was working on the final batch – a smattering of square-shaped confections for Subaru – when she reached for the carton of milk and felt it lift weightlessly into the air. Empty.

Mio sighed. The recipe called for two cups of the stuff but she must have finished off the last of it earlier this morning on Fubuki's portion. She set the empty jug down and paced within the cage of her kitchen, waiting for a solution to manifest. While a trip to the convenience store would solve her problems, she didn't have any time to spare after oversleeping for three hours this morning.

Mio stopped mid-stride and spared a glance down towards her chest, eyeing up the big, fat wolf tits that hide her bare feet from view. An idea sprung to mind, as effective as it was perverse. Nervously, she hefted her breasts in her hands, feeling their immense weight spill over her palms, and lightly juggled them against each other. They were truly impressive. Heavy, perfectly-shaped teardrops that wobbled with the slightest turn of her torso and were massive enough to hang just above the bottom of her rib cage. A generous pale swath of underboob peeked out from below the overtly risque cut of her shirt, giving frustratingly brief glimpses of her pale, pink aerola whenever her top fluttered over her swaying funbags.

And since it was mating season, her obscene proportions were further augmented by lustful hormones currently rippling through her body, swelling her already sizable chest into a massive pair of shirt-straining, milk-leaking cow tits. Truthfully it had been a pain to manage for the last few weeks, constantly getting up to relieve the pressure in her overflowing breasts whenever she had a moment between streams. But perhaps now she could put these annoying sacks of fat to work. At the end of the day, it's just milk, right? The taste would blend right in...

She propped herself over the counter and let her massive udders hang freely over the mixing bowl, her tits slapping lightly against one another as she got into position. She leaned to the right and yanked her flimsy top to the side, letting her left breast bounce free and sway heavily in the open air. Even without any stimulation, she could already hear the soft *plits* and *plats* of her breast milk leaking into the bowl like a faucet. She reached up and groped her breast, her prodding digits sinking deep into the bountiful, doughy titflesh and pinched softly at the base of her puffy nipple. It was a delicate but firm movement and she rolled the sensitive nub between her thumb and index finger with just enough pressure to stimulate without being painful.

The gentle self-molestation soon payed off and milky jets sprayed from her teat, splashing against the plastic bowl's interior and dousing the pile of powered coca. Biting her lower lip, Mio cupped her breast and applied a long, gentle squeeze.  Breathy sighs escaped Mio's mouth as the ache in her tender chest subsided to a pleasant throb, and she settled into a rhythm to thoroughly milk every drop from her heaving bosom.

A few good, hard pumps later and Mio's heavy flow died down to modest trickle of milk from the peak of her nipple. Looking at the bowl, Mio realized she'd gotten a bit carried away in her session. The chocolate powder was almost invisible beneath the voluminous pool of breast milk and there were small white splashes dotting her counter top. *Ah...that was definitely over two cups...*

She quickly ripped off a few sheets of paper towel, wiped down the counter, and moved on with the preparations. The plastic molding tray was in place but as she carried over the bowl, a new problem arose.

The batter was much too thick.

Whether it was due to her improvised dairy product or some other factor, she didn't know, but it was clear the chocolates would be ruined at this rate.

Again, her mind flitted uselessly to the convenience store. And again, she had to remind herself that she just didn't have time to make that trip. She brought the bowl over to her sink's basin with a huff, hoping to thin it out with a bit of water. The flavor would suffer, but it was a better fate than becoming inedible. She tipped up the handle and...nothing. It seemed her plumbing had joined the maddening entourage of problems plaguing her afternoon, and Mio frantically yanked the handle up and down as though she could physically pump water through the pipes. The futility soon became clear and Mio buried her face in her hands, for the first time genuinely unsure of what to do next.

Her salvation came in the form of an uncomfortable pressure steadily building between her thighs. She unconsciously rubbed her shapely legs together, the dawning comprehension that she hadn't taken a bathroom break in the last twenty four hours now forcing itself to her body's top priority. She had been so busy, so overworked with stream schedules that she hadn't had the time to attend any idol meetings and her neglected bladder was threatening rebellion.

Mio wiggled in place, eyes darting between her bathroom door and the mixing bowl that was so desperately in need of some kind of liquid to thin it out. The solution was right there, however terrible it may be. How much worse would it be to give Subaru poorly baked goods, she wondered. How much worse would it be to interrupt her stream later in the day or miss Valentines entirely, having Subaru be the only one without chocolates? Mio was practically dancing in place now, the pressure quickly becoming untenable and silencing whatever mental squabble was playing out in her head. She squeaked as a few sparkling drops trickled from between her thighs. It was now or never.

“Ah, whatever!” Mio slammed the bowl down on the ground and squatted over it, her face bright red and slick with panicked sweat. She never wore panties in her apartment, so she could easily hike up her immodest skirt and hover her leaking cunt over the mixture. It had been a very long time since she shaved down there, and she prayed none of her dark, sweaty pubes would find their way into Subaru's chocolates.

With a heavy sigh of relief, she relaxed her body and let a powerful spout of light amber piss spray out of her offensively hairy, musk-soaked muff. Her stream blasted against the semi-solid mixture below like a garden hose on concrete, strong enough to shake the bowl and spritz messy flecks of urine across the tiled floor and Mio's ankles.

*Ugh...* Mio brought a hand to her nose as a fiercely acrid aroma drifted up from below.  The smell was thick and cloying, swirling in the air like an overclocked humidifier. She felt a muggy warmth spreading across her inner thighs and looked down in disgust at the puddle of piss that was absolutely *steaming* in the relatively cool kitchen air. She had severely underestimated her need to go, and twenty four hours of held back piss was gushing out of her with worrying volume, drowning every other ingredient beneath warm amber waves. Her fluffy ears twitched and her eyes clenched shut, trying desperately to ignore the utter humiliation of pissing on the floor like a untrained dog locked inside the house.

Close to a full minute later, Mio finished relieving herself and leaned back to sit her fat butt down on her heels.  *Whew...at least the bowl didn't overflow...* She grimaced and flexed her pelvic muscles, squirting out the last few spurts of pee. There was nothing to wipe with, so she had no choice but to drip dry and let whatever was still caught in the thick forest of her glistening bush slowly dribble down into the bowl below. Each drop surely carried a good amount of Mio's pungent cunt flavor after sliding down her oily pubes, but she couldn't worry about that now. It took a few more minutes until Mio was satisfied and she stood back up, placing the bowl back on the counter top to finish up the recipe.

Her plan had technically worked, though any hopes of it being a “secret” ingredient were long gone; the batter *reeked* of her liquid ambrosia. Anyone eating this might as well submerge their face in Mio's freshly used toilet bowl. Fluffy tail hanging low in defeat, Mio pushed her anxieties aside and started mixing the batter. She could only hope that the smell would go away over time.

At the very least, Mio's degenerate efforts were not in vain. She was able to finish her chocolates in time and go the extra mile of placing each morsel on a small piece of pleated serving paper before arranging them in a delicate array within a heart-shaped container. Subaru's house was last on the list, and Mio's huffing, panting body managed to ring the doorbell a mere two minutes after the promised deadline. After a soft clack, the door opened.

“Happy...Valentine's Day, Subaru! I hope...you like it...” Mio gasped between breaths.

Subaru's eyes lit up and she grasped the box of chocolates close to her chest. “Wow, these look great, Mio! Thank you!” She opened up the top for further inspection and Mio's heart leapt to her throat. The scent of her “additions” was faint at this point, but still obvious to the wolf girl's sensitive nose.

“O-oh, well, you don't have to eat them now. They're better as a dessert, maybe later in the day after dinner?”

Subaru was much too interested to wait that long and was already eyeing up a piece of chocolate in her hand. “Just a quick sample then! These are the kind you're supposed to let melt in your mouth, right?”

She slipped the small candy between her lips and let it rest on her tongue, eagerly awaiting the flavors to melt down through the rest of her mouth. Mio watched with bated breath as her friend rocked the chocolate from side to side on her tongue, passing it between her cheeks and licking it from all sides like a fine delicacy. Subaru's saliva poured over Mio's chocolate, heating and smearing it in a thick paste across her taste buds as she savored her treat in earnest, not wanting to miss an iota of her friend's cooking.

Mio did her best to hide the stabbing embarrassment of watching her friend obliviously slobber and suck on what she had essential used as a urinal earlier in the day. Subaru hadn't said anything or spat it out yet, though. Maybe...just maybe, Subaru wouldn't notice?

*“Hmmn?”* Lightening suddenly surged through Subaru's body and she struggled to maintain her composure, an obvious unpleasantness now spreading through her winching features.

“Ah, I'm so sorry! It's no good, right? You don't have to eat them if you don't-”

Subaru held up a hand and quickly chewed up the gooey morsel in her mouth, swallowing it down with an exaggerated gulp. “*Hahhh!* D-don't be ridiculous, Mio, that was delicious! Maybe a  little more bitter than I expected, but that's how I like my chocolate anyway!” She flashed a winning smile and a thumbs up.

“Really? Oh, thank goodness...” Mio took a few steps back and caught her breath. “Well, I really should be going now, so, um, happy Valentine's Day!” Without waiting for a response, she sped down the complex's narrow hallway and disappeared  behind the far exit's stairwell.

*Heh, I guess anyone would be nervous about cooking for their friends.* Subaru smiled to herself and closed the door. The rest of her stream was peppered with the sounds of Subaru munching down Mio chocolates and loudly smacking her lips, exclaiming what a strong and unique taste they had to everyone in chat. By the end of the afternoon, not a single piece was left in the box.
