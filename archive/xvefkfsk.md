DIRECTIONS:

- Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Cover eggs with a tight-fitting lid and remove from heat; set aside for 8-10 minutes. Drain well and let cool before peeling and halving.

NOTES:

- Kichōna hates it.

##Unidentified Male Autopsy - "Simple" Version

The subject was found embedded in a rotting cow corpse roughly West of Ureshīmizu Field.
 Subject was somewhere around 35 years old, and has been dead for aproximately 5 days. 
Shows signs of cranial trauma. 
Subject is believed to be underweight, malnourished, and dehyrdated at the time of death. 
Left arm has been burnt; likely well past death. Markings were found on the inside of the eyelids; markings are unidentified. 
Death was due to water filling the lungs; lungs have been ruptured.

Unprofessional Opinion: 
Cult activity is at work. The markings are professionally unidentified, but I believe them to be similar to those used in the "Jashin" cult. The ritual itself is unlike anything I have ever seen, and what I have seen will not be elaborated on (until request). I have informally decided to crudely identify this as "Insane Ushin Sacrifce Body 1". Is it disrespectful? Maybe. Do I find it a little funny? Yes. Cult should be dealt with to prevent further rituals. Not telling you what to do, but it should. I'm not your boss. 
Open casket funeral is not recommended. The autopsy team will be in attendance!


##Request From Gen Nara: Age 32

I have found a volunteer for the Human-Eagle Wing Transplant! Unfortunately, other Nara Clan members have told me that "Gen is not of sound mind to be making such life changing and potentially deadly decisions." Through psychological analysis, I have found Gen's IQ of 59 sufficient for decision making, and have filed the relevant paper work, including a waver that removes all responsibility from me. Kichōna, my aide and trusted confidant, has also declared that this should be attempted. While awaiting clearance from the Hokage, I shall locate an eagle of appropiate size. The Human-Spider Spinneret Transplant has been moved higher on my experiment priority list due to the success of a volunteer being found, and said volunteer being possibly willing for future experiments.

##Update: Request From Shoto Inuzuka: Age 7

Several weeks ago, Shoto's puppy, Ga, had died. Illness had taken poor Ga's life. Shoto apparently knows me as a man of science, and had asked if I could make little Ga better again. As much as it pains me to say, revival of the dead has consistently eluded me, so I have no way to fulfill his request and return Ga to life. Although I asked Shoto if he would like me to preserve Ga's body, in case a time comes where I can make him better, he told me that he would rather Ga "help people like he wanted to". Far be it from me to deny his request. A Puppet of Ga now patrols the street Shoto takes to school. The design is intended to bark at large figures who walk along the path, to alert others of a possible kidnapping. This request has provided valuable knowledge on dog Puppets, that I would not have without. I thank Ga for his contribution to science, and Shoto for providing me with this opportunity. On another note, perhaps a friendly face will ease people in to the eventual Puppets that will roam the streets and protect the people! Science that offends the tastes of the irrational requires extra effort to be realized. 

##Puppet: Takatoshi Hyūga

Lately, I have been the subject of much controversey. Main House member Takatoshi Hyūga has died; I have come into possesion of his corpse. Takatoshi died because of a liver disease. Normally, a Hyūga clan corpse would be taken care of by the Hyūga clan, resulting in any "secrets" being locked away. Takatoshi had prepared for this. Dr Takatoshi Hyūga was a man I knew for only a short period of time, but it was clear to me that he was a very kind man. He had shown interest in my Puppets; he believed that with them, the Branch House may be abolished due to a lack of need, resulting in the Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu being forgotten. I do not know the particulars of the Hyūga, but Takatoshi had told me that the practices were, in his opinion and not my words, barbaric. Through much hard work, and what I believe was a legal loophole considering the council meeting (which I was not privy to) that happened after his death, he has donated his body to science. Due to my knowledge on the subject of Kekkai Genkai, I was the most qualified person in Konoha to study the intact Byakugan. According to Takatoshi's will, I will incorporate it into a Puppet. This Puppet will be an important stepping stone in Puppet Senses. Through a system of specially bred insects, I have found a way to barely transmute information from eyes through the rest of the Puppet. I am sure that if Takatoshi was still with us, the system would be far more accurate. Until a like-minded Hyūga comes along, the current Takatoshi Puppet will likely be the closest I can get to utilizing a Byakugan. It is obviously unrelated to combat. The Takatoshi Puppet is a medical apparatus, and the surgery it is capable of will surely save many lives. How funny is it that, even in death, Takatoshi continues his duties? Putting joking aside, and likely for my benefit, I am not popular with the Hyūga Clan, nor many others. I can find no blame in them. An outsider from Ame has just tampered with a Byakugan! However, even after they see my results, they still doubt my science. For this, I find them quite... close-minded.

##Puppet: 'Tiger'

After much prodding, I have successfully obtained an execution for the inmate codenamed 'Tiger'. Tiger was imprisoned due to banditry and believed murder. A taijutsu specialist, the most fascinating part of Tiger's arsenal was the rare Weight Control technique. I simply had to have his body, for the good of Konoha. After his body was retrieved for me from his cell, I promptly went to work. Yesterday, the Puppet was completed, and today was for testing. Weight Control's use by the usual Insect System prepared for a taijutsu specialist was unwieldy. A special mixture of the typical ninjutsu and taijutsu Insect Systems was used instead. In combat testing, Tiger has proved promising. It has impressive chakra output, and its skill in Weight Control is highly refined. As to be expected, the ninjutsu and taijutsu insects have some difficulty working together, causing conflicting movements. This needs to be further refined and explored. Via personal discretion, I have outfitted Tiger with a built-in flamethrower, to make use of the subject's Fire Chakra Nature, and in case of the ninjutsu insects needing something they are more suited for. Tiger has also been equipped with an extendable polearm. Tiger has been cleared for use in a training session with my Genin, after the exercises it went through with the Anbu. I have been informed to ensure it recieves little to no damage. It is believed to be a great asset.

##Request from Kichōna
Kichōna has informed me that her favorite doll has been damaged. Everything must be put on hold until it has been fixed.
