## UTC

All times listed in the OP are `UTC+0` unless stated otherwise like for `Server Time` events.

Go to https://time.is/ and find your timezone.
Use the search box | Scroll down a bit to find the `UTC` offset

Alaska is UTC-9, so to convert a time in the OP from `UTC` to `UTC-9`, you just subtract 9 hours. The UTC offset sometimes changes in case there's daylight saving time. `Eastern Time` is currently `Eastern Standard Time (EST), UTC-5`. Later it'll be `Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), UTC-4`

For example, OP has ==[03:00 Dec.15 - 21:00 Dec.26] Venus - Nemesis==, so for `EST` which is `UTC-5`, it starts at 22:00 (10pm) Dec.14 and ends at 16:00 (4pm) Dec.26.

## Server Time
Some events are `Server Time` instead of `UTC`, so these events occur at different times for players across different server regions. You can figure out your `Server Timezone` by comparing your local time against the PVP start/end time, since PVP always starts `12pm Server Time` and ends at `12am Server Time`. For example, if your timezone is `Pacific Time (Pacific Standard Time (PST), UTC-8)` and PVP starts for you at 9am, then you're 3 hours behind your `Server Timezone` so it is UTC(-8+3)=`UTC-5` (added 3 hours).

Region | Server Timezone
:---:|:---:
North America | Eastern Time, UTC-5 if Daylight Saving, UTC-4 otherwise
Europe | ?
South East Asia | UTC+8
Asia-Pacific | ?

## Easier Method to Convert Time
JP streams start/end times are usually stated according to `Japan Standard Time (JST), UTC +9`. At this point I start getting sick of timezone conversions, so to find out how many hours until stream starts in `UTC+0` or my timezone, I just use https://time.is/compare and fill in the blanks. You can share the link you get with others later too.
