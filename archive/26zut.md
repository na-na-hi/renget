#My name is Captain Spaceboy...
Captain Spaceboy looked upon his table. His eyes scanning the various space weaponry at it. A constant-fire blaster rifle. Couple Plasma-nades. A nanite-vest for protection, like he needed any. It was HER who needed protection. His teeth grit as he thought of her... that fucking worthless cunt.


"My name is not important... What is important is what I'm going to do. I just fucking hate Sweetheart and the Sprout Moles feasting on her carcass. My whole life is just cold, bitter bakeups... and I always wanted to die violently. This the time of vengeance and no life is worth saving. And I will put in the grave as many as I can. It's time for me to kill... and it's time for me to die."

Captain Spaceboy turned on his heel and headed to the place he planed to extinguish of life...

"Heya! I'm Sprouty! Are you here to see our dearest, most wonderful Sweeth-"
*ZAP*
Spaceboy's only response was to shoot that miserable creature in its fucking face. Walking through the sprout mole village, he killed every single mole there. Now... now it was her turn...

Burnt piles of corpses. Ash in the air. The mind is hungry... the mind is also thirsty for something new.

Sweetheart stood in horror. Her eyes wide as she watched her ex-husband slaughter every Sprout Mole in her castle. Now... Now he was before her. Spaceboy stood there, blood dripping from his cape and gun aimed to the ground. Sweetheart tried her best to swallow her fear as she uttered words.
"H-H-Hone-ey... I lov-"
Sweetheart's words were halted by Spaceboy's hand grabbing her neck. Her own hands desperately tried to pry his from her neck to no effect. She looked him in his cold dead eyes as he said.
"Shut the fuck up and die."
Before lifting his gun and shooting her multiple times in her stomach. Organs and blood sprayed from her wounds as she coughed. Spaceboy then let her go, making her fall to her dead. Spaceboy looked down upon the carnage he brought... it was majestic.
