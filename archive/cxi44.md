#Goose Neck Silver Strategy

Strategy 

Tongues
They will be used a fast moving army control units using their Thu'um as a way to break enemy formations and fortification and maybe if lucky their moral, each will be given a mount so they can hide behind the Legionaries to get their shout in before retreating into friendly lines to recover and hide.

Scout's

To search ahead and keep constant watch on the Legionaries and Tongues to secure and prevent traps, ambushes, look at landscape and watch out for enemy divisions.

Legionaries
To move as one solid unit, mostly taking Defensive positions and only taking some risk but the main goal is to keep them alive as it takes time to recruit more units.

Pirates
They mainly watch the coast and watch trade ships for rouge Pirates and to protect the coast of the city from invasions and maybe if able to destroy or raid enemy supplies  

Expansion
Not to fast not to slow, rush to take defensive terrain such as hills, mountains, swamps, thick forest but other wise slow and steady to consolidate every life is needed and can't be wasted by rushing to take land we can't keep.
