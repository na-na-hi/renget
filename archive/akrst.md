#The Five Fight

Light and Cacophonous noise split the peace of a quiet residential neighborhood in uptown Kyoto. 3 APCs were parked on a narrow street. Dozens of Kyoto police milled about the once empty street. These officers assisted in the evacuation of nearby buildings and set up fortified positions. All this chaos centered around an unassuming brick apartment building barely 14 meters tall. This poor building which would soon become a battlefield, bore a simple fragile glass door leading into its interior. It was not meant for war. The building’s only notable feature, was that the top floor had a had a massive one-way window. Behind that window were some of the most dangerous criminals in the world.

IN the midst of this chaos, crouching behind the shelter of one of the APCs hastily procured for this operation was Rosethorn. She was hunched over a blueprint of that poor building. With her were 4 other heroes. To her right was Majestic, technically her superior. He’d graciously allowed her to assume command… at least until the press came about. To her left was Popsy, her oldest friend, the two had been drinking together when Rosethorn had gotten that damned text. Next to Popsy crouched a newbie hero named Seiryu and his sidekick Honoken. They’d been in the area.

Not a bad team to assemble on short notice, Rosethorn hoped it was enough.

Rosethorn pointed at the blueprints in front of her. She singled out the Five’s room.

“After Ryusei gets the family on the third floor evacuated, Majestic, you melt that window. Seiryu, you get altitude once the window’s down, give us positions and disposition. Then you get back to cover. Do not give Desolator a clean shot under any circumstance. Popsy, you and Ryusei will be with me. Majestic will be on overwatch. Seiryu and Honoken will be our reserves. We’ll enter through the ground floor, clear as we go.”

Majestic rubbed his chin but nodded his assent. He wouldn’t need to interject here to get the credit at the end. Seiryu shrugged. Honoken gave a thumbs up. 

Popsy nodded groggily. She was a little green around the gills from the drinking earlier. Rosethorn frowned. She’d been holding her voice back until now. She hoped to only use it when Popsy’d need it to become the engine of humorous destruction the clown hero could be. Though admittedly, holding back when Popsy was like this was… hard.

“What about that student of yours?” Seiryu asked.

“He better be home by now.” Rosethorn hissed.

“Fat chance.” Majestic laughed. “Bet he’s got that tall piece of ass with him… what’sherface? No way they’re sitting this out.”

“Piece of ass? Really?” Honoken asked in a mocking deadpan. “She’s 15.”

“Oh don’t you start, I jus--”

“Focus.” Rosethorn commanded. Her voice, even without her quirk, cut through the argument like a hot knife through butter. “If any of you see those two anywhere near this fight, detain them.”

Popsy shook her head. “I’m not gonna waste time detaining kids who wanna help. We’re gonna have our hands full as it is.”

Rosethorn frowned, but before she could argue, Seiryu cut in.

“While this discussion has been enlightening, that’s not what I meant. I meant to ask if the information your student provided is credible.”

“Solid.” Rosethorn answered without hesitation. When he texted her, Christopher’d sent the known capabilities of every member of the Five. That he’d taken the insane risk of slipping his phone into Desolator’s pocket was ignored in the text.

“Then I’m worried about Nox more than anyone else.” Seiryu concluded. “With her quirk they don’t have to fight defensive. They could come out onto the street as a unit and there’s not much we can do to stop them.”

Rosethorn nodded. She’d been dreading what Nox could do in this engagement too. “Do you have a suggestion?”

Seiryu nodded, “Honoken and I take an elevated position. IF the Five stay defensive we follow your plan, if they come out, we blitz Nox and seize the initiative.”

“It’s as good a plan as any,” Rosethorn conceded. “If Seiryu fails, she’s your’s Majestic. Go full power if you have to.”

“I’ll do it, but it’d be a shame to ruin such a pretty face.” He rubbed his chin. “If we had some better equipment… Infrared as an example.”

“We have what we have. Be grateful we could get this much on short notice.” 3 APCs, 3 of Kyoto PD’s SATs (Special Assault Teams) and two sniper teams were more than anyone should’ve dreamed of getting in just a few hours.

Popsy restrained a burp. She was turning a shiny viridian hue. “So who’s the next priority?”

“Maddox.” Seiryu answered again. Rosethorn nodded. 

“I’ll take her.” The other 4 heroes looked at Seiryu sharply.

“There’s no dibs in the field Seiryu.” Rosethorn warned

“That’s not what this is. I can extract her quickly. She has no special movement abilities. If she’s away from her team their threat is vastly reduced.”

Rosethorn chewed her cheek while she pondered his suggestion. She checked the front door of the apartment building again. Ryusei was overdue.

Popsy was the one who responded. “You’re underestimating her. I fought her once, back when I was… last time the Five were in Japan. Aiko going full bore is the only one here that has any business pulling 1v1 against her.”

Rosethorn glanced back at Popsy. It was sometimes hard to remember that Popsy had a life before she turned into this.

Seiryu frowned. “She’s that big of a threat?” 

Popsy nodded gravely. She held a hand over her head as she tried to steady her thoughts long enough to say her peace. “Honestly, if you’re going equal numbers against anyone in the Five, you’ve messed up. Yeah, you get Desolator at close range you can take him, but if he’s got range you’re in for it. As for the others… God. Please tell me Jabberwocky was one of the ones put in Gehenna.”

“He was.” Majestic confirmed, unusually solemn.

“Good, then we’ve got a prayer.” Popsy sighed.

“How do we play this?” Honoken asked.

“Swarm.” Rosethorn interrupted. “Use our numbers, Desolator will hang back if his patterns hold. Maddox will be at the front trying to draw our fire. I’ll hold Maddox off. The rest of you isolate and eliminate.”

“Weren’t we going to breach the building?” Honoken asked, worry creeping into her voice.

“They’re not going to go defensive.” Majestic mumbled. 

“I think so too. Seiryu was right. They’re going to go for the open ground. I just hope Ryusei gets out before they--”

Smoke flooded out the front door of the apartment building. As soon as the cloud left the door, it arched up and outwards until it completely obscured the street in a canopy of gray vapor. AS soon as the cover settled, Ryusei rushed out the door. Smoke billowed around him. He held a little girl with a  cloth mask in his arms. A man and woman raced behind him. They kept their heads low.

Majestic popped up from behind the APC. Eyes glowing red. Popsy closed her eyes, trying to imagine something funny. Rosethorn prepared her voice. Seiryu and Honoken were crouched and ready. They were ready for Desolator to start shooting.

Ryusei made it behind the APC and handed the civilians off to a waiting paramedic. No shot ever came.

Rosethorn frowned. That would’ve been the perfect moment. What were they waiting for?

The girl and her parents were ushered into a waiting ambulance. The little girl waved ‘bye-bye’ to Ryusei as the ambulance doors shut. Ryusei gave a short wave of his own. The ambulance rocketed away, taking the family out of the combat zone. Ryusei made his way back to the other heroes. A lit cigarette dangled from his mouth. 

“Any problems?” Rosethorn asked.

“No.” Ryusei, HN Smokin’ Sexy, sat next to Popsy. “They didn’t even have a watch set up.”

“… what?”

“He knows we’ll be cautious.” Majestic hissed. Before Rosethorn’s eyes could dart to her colleague an intercom squealed to life.

“Hello?” The intercom screeched with feedback. “Hello? Dammit Mercury this isn’t working. What? Yes I’m holding down the red button. What do you mean they can hear me? Oh to Hell with this. Ahem. Hello heroes. I’m sure by now you realize we’ve allowed you to evacuate the surrounding buildings uncontested. And if you hadn’t realized that by now… well I’m extremely disappointed. My name is Desolator, I’m part of a group known as the Five. We’ve been guests of your country for some months now--”

“Where is that intercom?” Rosethorn hissed. There was no speaker visible.

“and I have to say, it’s been a peaceful stay. I love Japan. I might retire here.”

“I didn’t see anything when I was in there.” Ryusei reported.

“But, if you’ll tolerate a small criticism, it HAS been a little boring. We haven’t had a real chance to fight as a group… until now. So, thank you young heroes. For giving us the excuse.”

Darkness shot through Ryusei’s smoke canopy. Tendrils of black ink raced towards the street like lightning. It impacted the ground in massive waves. Those waved flooded the street in a night which would cast a shadow on darkness itself.

“Seiryu get air--” Rosethorn couldn’t get the words out before she was consumed by the onrushing wave of darkness and her voice was lost to even her ears.

***

Seiryu labored into the air. He clutched Honoken in his claw. Massive prismatic wings beat against the darkness, driving Seiryu into the sky. There seemed to be no end to the darkness. Then! Just as the dragon’s heart began to fail him, the darkness broke and the dragon beheld the moon. 

“It was freezing in there!” Honoken shouted, still clutched in her partner’s claw.

Seiryu scanned his surroundings. A blanket of black obscured the street below, up to the third story. Seiryu twitched, it’d felt like an eternity flying out of that darkness and it’d been less than 10 meters tall?! 

Peeking above the black blanket below was the shattered window of the Five’s apartment. There, standing at the edge of the window was the woman codenamed Nox, her eyes a disorienting black. Next to Nox was the tall bruiser named Maddox. She looked bored. Next to Maddox was a boy Seiryu didn’t recognize, he looked just 15… 15 and standing next to hardened criminals?! Seiryu’s gaze left the boy as he searched the rest of the room. There was no sign of Tether, Mercury or Des--

The flash of a scope against the moonlight caught Seiryu’s attention a moment before the crack of a gunshot met his ears. The impact of a rubber semi collided with his chest, tearing a roar from the dragon’s throat. His entire body jerked and his claw loosened.

Honoken fell! She tumbled head over heels. She tried to use the vents on her palms to stabilize herself. Gouts of flame fired all around her. It wasn’t enough. The darkness below raced to meet her. She needed more time to stabilize. She’d fall back into the darkness and there… she’d have no way of knowing which way was up. And if she guessed wrong, she’d have less than a second before….

Seiryu caught Honoken with his tail. Her foot grazed the darkness as Seiryu pulled her out. He held onto Honoken as he beat his brilliant wings against the sky. Another gunshot, another bone shattering impact hit his throat. Seiryu bit down the surge of blood and pain. Quickest way out of Desolator’s line of sight was up. He just needed to climb a few more meters! Then there’d be no-one to shoot at except… except for Honoken.

Seiryu flexed his tail. He didn’t have the voice to warn Honoken right now.

“What are you going to doO?!”

Seiryu flung Honoken in front of him, even as another gun shot rang out. Seiryu didn’t feel another impact. She flew a full 30 meters into the sky. Honoken kept her cool admirably even as she tumbled head over heels into the night. She stretched out her hands. Her palms unleashed geysers of flame. She quickly managed to arrest her spin. By the time Seiryu caught up to her, she hovered placidly. 

Honoken looked at Seiryu. She was out of breath, her adrenaline caused her to shake. Still, she smiled. “That was fun.”

Seiryu ignored her enthusiasm. He wasn’t sure he could respond yet anyway. The blood in his mouth worried him. He glanced at the apartment. He mentally drew a line between himself and the Five’s open window. Desolator’d have to hang over the street to get a clear shot. They were safe. Good. He needed a moment.

Seiryu coughed.

Honoken flew closer. “You okay?”

“Fine.” Seiryu croaked. His wings beat heavily against the night sky, hovering in place felt like a Herculean labor. He felt like he’d just been kicked in the throat by an elephant. 

“We need to disrupt Nox.” Seiryu decided. It wasn’t a brilliant observation. It was a fact. If they didn’t get their allies out of that darkness they weren’t going to take on the rest of the five. The problem was… they’d need to get close, which meant crossing back into Desolator’s firing line. Maybe they could get in through the roof?

“I can take Nox.” Honoken declared. “But, I’m gonna have to ride you so we can use ‘Falling Phoenix.’”

Seiryu narrowed his eyes at her. That was the name of her new super move? Really?

“You love it don’t lie.”

Seiryu sighed. “Just get on.”

Still grinning Honoken obeyed. She took her seat between Seiryu’s shoulders. “How are we doing this?”

Seiryu shook the cobwebs from his head. He looked back down, towards their target. “Best avenue might be through the-- who’s that?”

On a rooftop opposite the Five’s apartment, stood a massive woman holding a large mirror. The mirror was half the woman’s size. The woman watched the Five’s rooftop intently. She made slight adjustments to the mirror’s position in response to signals from the Five’s rooftop. Seiryu followed the woman’s gaze and saw a young man standing on the roof of the Five’s building. He was maybe Orochi’s age, but not as tall. As Seiryu noticed him, the young man began to wave his arms emphatically, as if to signal ‘stop!’

“They look like kids!” Honoken hissed. She felt ready to jump in immediately, detain them like Rosethorn wanted. Seiryu wasn’t. The kids weren’t in any immediate danger and there was obviously a plan at work.

“Are those Rosethorn’s students?”

The giant woman stopped adjusting the mirror at her companion’s signal. The young man gave a thumbs up.

“Probably.” Seiryu growled. 

The boy held out his right hand. He hesitated, then closed that hand into a fist. Seiryu didn’t notice anything at first. His gaze drifted back to the Five’s open window. He saw Nox grab at her throat. 

“Those idiots are going to--”

The darkness thinned.

Maddox pulled Nox away from the window. Desolator scanned the rooftops, he was joined by the 15 year old. It would be a matter of moments before he spotted the students. He wasn’t watching Seiryu’s position!

“Give us an opening!” Seiryu shouted, completing Honoken’s sentence.

With one last flap of his wings, Seiryu dove for the Five’s apartment. Honoken began to gather energy. Seiryu’s vision went tunnel as he began to rapidly close the distance. 20 meters. Desolator was still scanning the roof tops. 15 meters. Desolator’s eyes widened as he spotted the dragon dive bombing him. 10 meters. 

Desolator didn’t have the time to shoot. He grabbed the young man next to him and dove to the side.

Honoken screamed a battle cry as she thrust her hands forward, unleashing a jet of flame into the apartment. The apartment was bathed in burning fire a split second before Seiryu bulldozed through the window’s remains. The apartment was sheathed in smoke and flame. A couch burned, a TV sparked, and the Five were surely in disarray!

Seiryu roared in triumph before a massive fist collided with the tip of his chin. The blow sent him careening into the apartment wall with a gasp. Honoken fell off of him. She rolled on the apartment’s floor standing with the momentum. 

Seiryu tried to get his legs under him, but his massive draconic limbs were like jelly. The blow to the face was stronger than any he’d ever felt before. For the moment, Honoken was on her own.

Honoken raised her hands. Flames jetted from her palms.

“Ears!” Seiryu heard a woman’s voice shout. Then a gale wind blew forward, followed by a massive thunderclap. Seiryu’s vision swam as the noise hit him. His ears rang. But the force which hit him was nothing compared to what Honoken endured. 

Honoken’s flames were snuffed out by the air pressure. Her ears bled from the noise. She fell to her knees.

Seiryu’s eyes instinctively darted towards the noise’s origin. First he saw Nox, on the ground massaging her throat. Then, he saw HER. That giant of a woman with skin like Jet, Maddox. Her hands were held together like she’d just given a round of applause. Her clap, that was the source of the wind, of the deafening thunder. Honoken fell to her hands. Seiryu had to move. HE HAD TO MOVE NOW!

Seiryu growled as he tried to rise. His legs refused to obey. All they would do is scrap at the floor. Helpless, he looked to his partner. If she could move, if she could get away--

Honoken was still on the ground. She looked like she was about to vomit. A trickle of blood fell from her right ear. Seiryu roared as he redoubled his efforts to stand.

The woman, Maddox, frowned at the pair of temporarily disabled heroes. “What I get for hoping.” She’d wanted a real fight. “You good Des?”

“Peachy.” Desolator grumbled as he disentangled from the shocked young man that Seiryu didn’t recognize.

“Nox?”

“Gimme a minute.” The woman croaked. She was still sitting in the corner. She rubbed her throat.

“Take your time.” Maddox approached Honoken. 

Seiryu’s claws scrapped against the blackened floor. He tried to will strength into his limbs, it wouldn’t come. He roared. Desperate to distract Maddox, to attract her attention.

“OH shut up! You’ll get your turn!” Maddox snapped. She didn’t even look at Seiryu. 

Honoken was on her hands and knees. She vomited.

Maddox reached towards her.

Seiryu’s heart began to fail. His legs refused to move. Just one punch and a clap, that was all it took? Really?

A massive green-haired woman burst through the busted window at astonishing speed. It was the one who’d been holding the mirror!

“What the--?” The student collided with Maddox. The world shuddered at the impact. The student carried Maddox through the back wall before the behemoth had time to finish her question.

“Shit.” Desolator hissed as Maddox was carried out of view. He unslung his rifle and pointed it at Seiryu. He was intent on eliminating who he could.

Seiryu, shocked from the sudden save, still hadn’t gotten his legs under him. The building shuddered as two titans exchanged blows out of sight. Desolator’s aim stayed true. He fired. The bullet stopped as it left the barrel. Desolator’s eyes widened as the bullet hung in the air for just a moment, then fell to the ground.

“… not again.” Desolator groaned. An invisible force seized Desolator even as the words left his mouth. The force lifted him into the air and slammed him against the wall. Seiryu heard bones snap. 

Desolator slumped. 

The young man with Desolator dove behind the still burning couch. His head was on a swivel. Seiryu looked around. He didn’t see anyone. Suddenly Honoken shouted in alarm as she was dragged across the room by that same invisible force that had assaulted Desolator. Seiryu didn’t move. That invisible force carried Honoken around the corner, out of harm’s way. He could only hope the kid knew what he was doing.

Desolator pointed his rifle towards that corner, the corner Honoken disappeared behind and fired.

“Fuck!” A young voice shouted as the round took a chunk off the wall.

“Marrow!” Desolator called to the young man. “Incapacitate Seiryu, I’ll cover you.”

“Right!” Marrow yelled he started towards Seiryu.

Marrow hadn’t even finished standing before a man in a pretty pink tutu landed in front of Seiryu in a perfect pirouette. His sword was drawn, smoke billowing around him. Seiryu raised an eyebrow at the dramatic entrance. That was definitely Smokin’ Sexy, but that was NOT how he dressed.

Unconcerned with his attire, Ryusei pointed his sword at Desolator. “You’re under arrest.”

He was joined moments later by Rosethorn. She wore… a bright red rubber nose. Seiryu heard someone on the street scream, “did you see Ryusei and Aiko?!” Before breaking into a hysterical laugh. Popsy. She was in a good mood. Things were looking up.

Rosethorn looked at Seiryu. She channeled her quirk into him with a simple command. “Get up.”

Seiryu felt power surge inside him. With her voice he was finally able to get his legs. He stood. The three heroes stared down Desolator and Marrow.

Marrow grimaced. Desolator smiled. On shaky legs the assassin stood. He leaned against the wall behind him. “Quite the attire. Could you go change before we surrender?”

“Your situation is untenable.” Rosethorn spoke, ignoring Desolator’s taunt. “There are 3 of us and 2 of you and this young man isn’t even a member of the 5.”

Rosethorn looked imperiously at the young man. Bone unsheathed from the young man’s wrist by way of answer. He wasn’t going to back down.

“I know your reputation Desolator. You wouldn’t want to see the boy hurt fighting a hopeless battle.” Seiryu could feel Rosethorn pouring some of her quirk into her voice, trying to sap Desolator’s physical strength, to break his will.

It probably would’ve worked if it wasn’t Desolator’s will she was trying to break.

“Before I surrender, let’s check your math. Nox? Your minute’s up.”

Seiryu’s head snapped to the corner. Where Nox had been nursing her throat. She stood at the sound of Desolator’s. Seiryu galloped towards her. He leapt towards her, jaws opened wide. Nox’s eyes filled with shadow. She dove out of the way. He’d miss her! The apartment plunged into darkness.  

Seiryu despaired only to feel his jaws snap over someone solid. Nox screamed as the darkness blew away in a puff of smoke! Seiryu was shocked to find the writhing form of Nox in his jaws. Hadn’t she been diving out of the way? Wasn’t he going to miss her?

Movement caught the corner of Seiryu’s eye. He saw Honoken, alive and well. She was leaning on a blur of smoke and shadow. It was as if that blur was helping her stand. She grinned sloppily at Seiryu as he noticed her. Blood still trickled from her ears, but she seemed to get steadier by the moment.

“I found the kid on the roof.”


***

Rosethorn dashed for Desolator as the darkness faded. Desolator pointed his rifle towards Seiryu. Rosethorn cursed. If he freed Nox this was over. The kid, the one Desolator called Marrow, tried to intercept her, only to get smacked across the face by Ryusei’s bokken. 

Bones erupted from the kid’s body.

Smoke engulfed Marrow’s head.

Ryusei struck. Marrow parried.

Rosethorn avoided the confrontation. She reached Desolator. Desolator’s rifle swung towards her, but she was already inside its arc. Desolator fired.

The sound of a TAC 50 going off in her ear deafened Rosethorn, but she pushed through. With a body check, she pinned Desolator to the wall. She grabbed his throat. Desolator reached for his sidearm. Rosethorn grabbed his wrist as soon as he drew it.

She risked a glance over to Seiryu. He had Nox in his mouth. Nox was struggling, but she wasn’t in danger of breaking out of a dragon’s jaws. She didn’t even look at Ryusei, he could handle some rookie villain. The sounds of Ryusei and Marrow’s struggle continued, but she was singularly unconcerned about that fight. 

Rosethorn turned her attention back on Desolator. “Order them to surrender.” She commanded. She poured her quirk into her voice. Trying to sap him of every last bit of strength he had.

Desolator gagged. Rosethorn loosened her grip on his throat. “Do it, now. No-one else needs to be hurt.”

“Like your friends on the street?”

“Wh—”

“You didn’t think Tether and Mercury disappeared did you?”

The sounds of battle from the street found Rosethorn’s ears. Her heart fluttered for a second. The SAT units had lost consciousness in the darkness and the snipers were in no condition to line up a shot right now. If Mercury and Tether turned their attention on the incapacitated officers….

“I’m sorry to say but whomever you left on the ground is as good as dead... unless you go help.”

Rosethorn listened a moment longer. Laughter. She heard laughter. A familiar, dearly missed laughter. She smiled at Desolator. “I’m not worried.”

A laser blast erupted into the sky. Majestic was there too she supposed. 

Desolator frowned at her confidence. He said nothing. He didn’t need to. Both of them knew he was fucked unless--

“Get off.” Nox begged. Rosethorn looked over. Was she in a panic? Was Seiryu applying too much pressure?

Seiryu choked. Rosethorn’s eyes widened. Darkness gathered around Nox. Darkness like the deepest void. Seiryu was being pushed back. His jaw was rent open. 

“GET OFF!”

With that scream Nox unleashed a wave of solid darkness upon Seriyu. The wave engulfed the apartment pushing everything in front of Nox towards the window. 

Seriyu and Ryusei were thrown out. 

Marrow speared himself to the ground and endured the blast. 

Rosethorn was able to brace with her brute strength. Unfortunately… she was standing between Nox and Desolator. Her body shielded Desolator from the blast. And the pain caused her to lose her grip on Desolator’s wrist.

With a viper’s speed, Desolator placed the barrel of his .45 on Rosethorn’s temple as the wave of darkness tore into her. The wave began to ebb. Rosethorn reached for Desolator’s wrist with a speed driven by desperation!

BANG

Rosethorn staggered back as a .45 caliber bullet smacked her in the head. That was it. Not even she could survive that.

Rosethorn fell to her knees, blood poured from her head. She blinked. She was disoriented but alive. She held a hand to her head, where she was certain the bullet hit. There was a lot of blood, but no penetration.

“Rubber bullet?” Rosethorn mumbled. If she wasn’t enhanced a rubber bullet would’ve killed her at this range, as she was, it just hurt like Hell.

“I’m not being paid enough to kill heroes.” Desolator intoned as he walked past her. He ignored the grinding of broken bones with every step he took. He turned. “Hope you survive this shot. If you don’t... well it’ll be expensive.”

“What are you—”

BANG

***

The bullet stopped in midair as soon as it left the barrel. The brat had endured the blast?! Desolator whirled towards Nox. Even so, she should’ve been able to hold off the brat! She was unconscious. Shit. An invisible hand grabbed his throat and slammed him against the wall. Desolator gagged.

“Rosethorn you okay?!” Honoken’s voice called. She was barely standing, leaning against a blur, her hand outstretched towards Marrow. She unleashed a gout of flame towards the young villain. The building shook. Honoken’s aim was mussed by a hair. It was enough. 

Marrow was able to roll out of the way, flames licking at his heels. He exited his roll beside Desolator. He moved to help.

“Not me!” Desolator croaked. “Her!" He kicked his feet towards Rosethorn.

Marrow got the message. He dashed towards Rosethorn’s motionless form.

“Shit!” Honoken hissed. She sent another gout of flame Marrow’s way. He was engulfed. For a precious moment it looked like he’d burn. Then, he flew out of the flames. Half his body covered in bone.

Marrow dove behind Rosethorn. Honoken held her fire, she couldn’t hit him without cooking Rosethorn. Marrow put his arm around Rosethorn’s neck and pulled her up. He turned Rosethorn to face her would-be saviors. A spear of bone shot from his palm and rested against her temple.

“Put him down.” Marrow ordered. His voice was iron. Desolator felt the hand gripping his windpipe falter at the sight. Then it reasserted itself, pressing even harder. Desolator felt his face turn purple. Marrow’s spear drew a bead of blood from the still groggy Rosethorn’s neck.

“Now!”

Desolator grimaced. It was the best plan he had in the situation they’d found themselves in. But it wasn’t a winning plan. This wasn’t a standoff. His vision started to go white. Miracle’s brat, for Desolator was sure that’s who the blur was, knew that Desolator would lose consciousness soon. When that happened he’d have all the leverage in the world against Marrow--

A green haired giant flopped out of the hole Maddox had been thrown through minutes earlier. Maddox followed. She had won. 

“Sorry about that Des!” Maddox called. She entered the room and took stock of the situation. “Big bitch had some fight in her.”

Maddox put a foot on the giant’s ribcage. She looked at Honoken and the blur. Honoken pointed a hand at Maddox, but stopped, she couldn’t hit Maddox without frying the student. “Let the boss down, and I won’t put her in traction.”

‘God bless you Maddox.’ Desolator thought as he felt the grip on his throat loosen. Desolator slowly drifted down. His feet touched the ground and the invisible hand released him. 

Desolator locked his gaze on the blur. He could feel hatred rolling off the brat he knew was hidden behind that obscuration field. Honoken turned her aim to Desolator. She could fry him and not risk hitting anyone else. It wasn’t much, but at least they’d have some leverage.

Desolator took the moment’s reprieve to glance down at the street. The police officers were all down. They had been out of commission since Nox had wrapped them in her freezing shroud. Seiryu was sprawled on the sidewalk unconscious. He’d taken Nox’s blast point blank and reverted to his human form. Smokin’ Sexy was conscious but his leg was bent the wrong way. He was trying to crawl to an APC, maybe call backup. Majestic was unconscious but still standing. He was anchored to the APC behind him with Tether’s power. He was bleeding from the back of the head. Tether and Mercury were nowhere to be seen. Neither was Popsy for that matter. Didn’t matter, Desolator was sure those two would be victorious and meet at the rendezvous. Popsy was old news.

“We’ll take Rosethorn to our vehicle and effect our egress. We’ll release her when we’re satisfied we haven’t been followed.” Desolator glared at the blur. “Or tracked. Am I clear?”

“How do we know you’ll let her go?” Honoken challenged.

“You don’t. But you’re out of cards to--”

Desolator’s subconscious noticed something. Something his conscious mind just wasn’t ready to catch up to. It was that damn phone in the pocket all over again. He looked at Miracle’s brat and Honoken. Neither of them were moving. There was buzzing coming from the Blur, like a phone vibrating. Was that it? His mind itched. No. He was hearing something else. Someone was whispering.

‘movemovemovemovemovemovemovemovemovemove’

Desolator’s eyes widened he looked at Rosethorn. Rosethorn was talking to herself. He didn’t have time to shout a warning before she grabbed the tip of Marrow’s spear and leaned forward. Marrow pitched forward with a yelp. He was taken by surprise. He tumbled over her back. There was not much he could do now. His head slammed into the floor in front of Rosethorn hard enough that the floor shook.

Marrow went limp. 

Maddox raised her foot, ready to stomp on Kaylee’s rib cage, only to freeze mid air as the blur stretched towards her. Honoken unleashed a gout of flame at Desolator. They couldn’t have timed it better if they’d planned. Unfortunately, Desolator was already moving.

Desolator rolled to the side and readied his .45. He didn’t panic. Why should he? He could take out two birds with one shot. He blasted a rubber bullet into the blur’s side. The blur crumbled with a shout. Honoken, robbed of her sole support, followed him down. 

Desolator whipped his gun around towards Rosethorn, only to see her tackle Maddox. Desolator tried to get a bead on her only to feel that all too familiar invisible force wrap around him again. The blur stretched towards him.

Honoken pointed her palm towards Desolator. Desolator ground his teeth. He was out of moves. A bone pierced Honoken’s wrist before she could fire. Marrow was on her, stabbing and punching with abandon. He was still conscious?! Desolator couldn’t believe his eyes.

The invisible force released a surprised Desolator. Marrow stabbed into the Blur. Eliciting a scream. Honoken, driven by heroic instinct, stood. She drove Marrow back. Fire spouted from her hands. 

Desolator drew a bead on Honoken. 

Marrow took a gout of flame he should’ve been able to dodge. His hands were forced to his side as the blur’s power seized him.

Desolator heard Marrow’s bones creak as something started to squeeze. 

Desolator fired at Honoken’s ribs.

Bones shattered.

Honoken went down with a shout. She fell. The back of her head slammed into the ground with a crack. She stirred no more.

Marrow went down, gasping.

Desolator pointed his gun at the blur. He couldn’t tell where would be non-lethal on the blur’s body. Shit.

The Blur turned towards Desolator. 

Desolator began to feel invisible hands grab him, bind him in place. No choice. Center mass, hope for the best.

Desolator fired.

The blur stopped moving as a rubber bullet bounced off his chest. The blur was replaced by Miracle’s brat, gasping for air. He continued to stare daggers at Desolator even as he labored for breath. He didn’t close his eyes even when he lost consciousness. Those eyes still stared dully at Desolator. Those damn burned brown, almost orange, eyes tore through Desolator’s soul. Those eyes reminded the assassin of the worst day of his life.

The building shook as Maddox finally landed a haymaker on the exhausted Rosethorn’s chin. Rosethorn FINALLY fell. 

Desolator’s partner stumbled, it’d been a while since she’d been so tested. Maddox grabbed the counter to steady herself. She looked at Desolator. “Des?”

Desolator watched Miracle’s spawn breath. He hadn’t killed the boy. But that look in the boy’s eyes told Sam he REALLY should. He pointed the gun at the boy. This boy would be the end of him if he didn’t shoot. Right between the eyes. Even rubber bullets can kill. 

The gun felt heavy in Desolator’s hands. It was pointed at a boy younger than his grandson. This was a line he’d never crossed before. But did he have a right not to? Those damn burned brown eyes told Desolator everything. The brat wouldn’t stop. He was young and stupid enough that death had no meaning to him. He’d come after Desolator regardless of any threats, any bodily harm. He was obsessed.

Desolator felt his finger tighten around the trigger. The only way to protect the Five, was to kill this boy. To cross that last line. He froze. He couldn’t do it.

“Des!”

Was Maddox going to stop him? Desolator looked towards her, she was looking at the window, eyes wide. A green claw closed around Desolator’s wrist. The claw yanked Desolator’s arm away from his enemy. The gun went off. A rubber bullet slammed into the floor centimeters the brat’s head. 

A green dragon’s tail slammed into Desolator’s gut. He flew back.

Desolator slammed into Maddox’s chest. The bones the brat had broken before groaned in protest. Desolator bit his tongue to stifle his scream.

Standing in the window was a familiar blonde young man. A common companion of the Five. The nephew of Desolator’s employer.

“Gigan!” Inigo shouted. Green dragon armor formed around Inigo’s body. He held out a hand and a lance formed. He leveled the lance at Desolator. 

“What’d you do?!” Inigo thundered.

“Inigo, I’m not in the fucking mood.” Maddox warned darkly. She set Desolator to his feet.

Inigo’s lance stayed pointed at Desolator, but he looked at Maddox imploringly. “He was going to kill Chris!”

“No he fucking wasn--”

“I might’ve.” Desolator answered somberly. 

Maddox looked at him, surprised. 

Desolator ignored her and stepped forward. “There’s been no breach of contract. He attacked us.”

“He’s unconscious!”

“And before that.” Desolator pointed to Junichi. “He tried to kill your friend.”

Inigo looked down. Marrow had lost consciousness from the pain. His breathing was labored. What Miracle’s brat had intended in crushing Marrow’s ribs wasn’t murder. Desolator knew that. If murder was on the brat’s mind, he would’ve tried to break Marrow’s neck. Crushing was just the quickest incapacitating option the brat could think of in a high tension situation. Desolator knew it. Inigo didn’t.

Inigo shook his head, “Chris wouldn--”

“Why not? It was a fight. He was hurt. He was bleeding. Marrow might’ve killed the girl he was trying to protect. He panicked. You know what that’s like.” Desolator smiled. 

Inigo’s face went blank.

‘Why yes Myoga, I know. Luccione tried to recruit me.’ Not a word was spoken, but the look in Inigo’s eyes meant the message was heard… loud and clear.

“But, out of respect for your misgivings, we’ll stop here.” Desolator conceded. “Maddox, grab Nox and Marrow I’m afraid I’m in no condi--”

“Junichi stays with me.”

Desolator’s eyes narrowed. “Look at him Myoga.” 

Inigo didn’t move.

“Look. At. Him.”

Inigo looked down. Marrow was bloodied and burned. His chest heaved like a pile of jigsaw puzzles. Inigo winced at the sound of his friend’s labored breath and of his broken bones rattling.

“Do you think he wants a hero’s help now?”

Inigo… lowered his lance. His shoulders slumped. He stepped aside. 

Maddox retrieved Nox. She slung the woman over her shoulder. Then she went for Marrow. Gently cradling him in one arm, careful not to aggravate his injuries. She looked at Inigo after she’d collected Marrow. The sight stopped stopped her. Inigo looked like he was about to vomit. Maddox stretched a massive hand and clasped his shoulder.

Inigo looked up. Maddox whispered something Desolator didn’t hear, but it didn’t matter. He trusted Maddox. Desolator retrieved Olga and slung her over his shoulder. Ignoring the fresh Hell his ribs became as the rifle settled. 

Myoga almost looked relieved after whatever Maddox said. Desolator was curious now….

Maddox walked past Desolator carrying her burdens. Desolator followed. Bones grinding with every step. He tempered his curiosity. It’d be gauche of him to ask what she’d said right now, when he wasn’t doing any work.

***

Maddox’s words rang in Inigo’s ears. He knelt next to Christopher. Christopher wasn’t in much better shape than Junichi. He was bleeding from a dozen places. But, at least his breathing wasn’t so painful to listen to. Inigo’s armor disappeared as Gigan returned to his small dragon form. The poor little wretch curled up next to their friend, against his stomach.

His friends had fought. Inigo closed his eyes. He should’ve been here to stop it. If he’d just introduced Chris and Junichi earlier they’d have been great friends. He should’ve seen Chris’s text immediately and come running… but that would’ve meant paying attention to his phone. It would’ve meant ignoring Hoge.

‘Sometimes there isn’t a bad guy kid.’ Inigo hoped Maddox was right. He hoped not every fight needed a villain. He hoped neither of his friends had been in the wrong. He hoped he hadn’t been in the wrong. 

Was it so wrong to focus on Hoge? To ignore just one phone call? Was it right that ignoring a single phone call got two…. Inigo opened his eyes. He looked at Kaylee. ...three of his friends got hurt.

Inigo shook his head. No time for that now. He started to plan how he was going to get everyone to a hospital. Gigan formed into a small flying stretcher and slid under Chris’s body gentle as a feather’s fall. First step would be getting them to ground level. Inigo took one last look at Christopher as Gigan began to lift him. Ready to ferry Chris to ground level.

‘Protecting a girl huh?’ Inigo remembered Desolator’s words. 

He looked to where Chris had been laying. Less than a meter from the site lay a brown bombshell Inigo recognized as one of Majestic’s aggrieved sidekicks. Her name was Honoken. At the beginning of the year Inigo had made a point of memorizing the names of all the cute girls in costume. And damn was she cute. Inigo smiled.

“Chris you dog.”
