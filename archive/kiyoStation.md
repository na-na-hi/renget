##Characters (The Three Strangers)
-> ![Kiyo's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/p6pb8y.png) <-
**Kiyo** is a long-time criminal with a surprising amount of musical talent.  He's quick to anger, especially if he's mistaken for a girl, and is very slow to trust.  His capacity for violence is hindered only by how soft his paws are. 

->![Cassie's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/kly1zr.png) <-
**Cassie** is a master carpenter and demolitions expert.  Despite loving the chaos and excitement of being a criminal, she's also a huge softie who loves cute things and cute PokÃ©mon.  

-> ![Bean's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/y33y1h.png)  <-
**Bean** lacks most of his memories, but he's still an invaluable asset to Kiyo and Cassie's team.  He's a bit shy, and mostly just speaks to Kiyo and Cassie; usually he's more busy thinking.  He's also a talented artist and forger. 

The three of them are family, and love each other a LOT!  Full bio's for all three characters can be found [here](https://rentry.org/kcb-01) !
