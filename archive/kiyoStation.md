##Characters (The Three Strangers)
-> ![Kiyo's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/p6pb8y.png) <-
**Kiyo** is a long-time criminal with a surprising amount of musical talent.  He's a bit blunt, a little rude, and very slow to trust.  His capacity for violence is hindered only by how soft his paws are.  Although he's standoffish towards strangers, he very much loves Cassie and Bean, and would do anything for them.

->![Cassie's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/kly1zr.png) <-
**Cassie** is a master carpenter and demolitions expert.  Despite loving the chaos and excitement of being a criminal, she's also a huge softie who loves cute things and cute PokÃ©mon.  Usually she's friendly and goofy, but when things get serious she reels it in, and becomes a force to be reckoned with!

-> ![Bean's Icon](https://files.catbox.moe/y33y1h.png)  <-
**Bean** lacks most of his memories, but he's still an invaluable asset to Kiyo and Cassie's team.  He's a bit shy, and mostly just speaks to Kiyo and Cassie; usually he's more busy thinking.  Still, he's remarkably witty in his own way, and a masterful planner as well.  He's also a talented artist and forger. 

The three of them are family, and love each other a LOT!  Full bio's for all three characters can be found [here](https://rentry.org/kcb-01) !
