##Characters (The Three Strangers)
-> ![Kiyo's Icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/941066180792303687/1208648295438618634/iconKiyo.png?ex=65e40c71&is=65d19771&hm=c1081987a018ad53124876cbf1578c3b15e9a82548f6ac3cd60f7f7a2335c6d2&) <-
**Kiyo** is a long-time criminal with a surprising amount of musical talent.  He's quick to anger, especially if he's mistaken for a girl, and is very slow to trust.  His capacity for violence is hindered only by how soft his paws are. 

->![Cassie's Icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/941066180792303687/1208651823217643520/iconCassie.png?ex=65e40fba&is=65d19aba&hm=b69333a03f498e5f32a015ca5c933637dec883819c4452f7f31daddc31ef0f49&) <-
**Cassie** is a master carpenter and demolitions expert.  Despite loving the chaos and excitement of being a criminal, she's also a huge softie who loves cute things and cute PokÃ©mon.  

-> ![Bean's Icon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/941066180792303687/1208651822995210340/iconBean.png?ex=65e40fba&is=65d19aba&hm=6ea3456499df28b6890ae78ab97154c1be46503b6947bdb794fd354eceade847&)  <-
**Bean** lacks most of his memories, but he's still an invaluable asset to Kiyo and Cassie's team.  He's a bit shy, and mostly just speaks to Kiyo and Cassie; usually he's more busy thinking.  He's also a talented artist and forger. 

The three of them are family, and love each other a LOT!  Full bio's for all three characters can be found [here](https://rentry.org/kcb-01) !
