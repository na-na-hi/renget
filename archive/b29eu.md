ANON RR2 150 TURN GUIDE
since you brainlets keep asking for it

The intent of the guide is to give you the basics on each fight and the [turn par] you should be aiming for to get under 150 turns at the end. Since skill setups wonâ€™t be the same for everyone the guide will not tell you which skill to use which turn, but it should help you get the right setups with as much leeway as possible for unlucky skill rolls and minimize the number of restarts required (you are still going to reset a lot)

IDS/EGOS YOU SHOULD TAKE

While itâ€™s probably not a hard requirement to have every single one, the more you lack the harder itâ€™s going to be. Missing any of the [Must Have] group may make it impossible to hit some par turns. Donâ€™t forget you can borrow a friend unit on support if you happen to be missing one.

MUST HAVE IDs:
Rheath  Uptie3+
WDon  U4
WRyo  U4
NSinclair  U3+
7 or N Faust  U3+ Or LC Faust  U4

MUST HAVE EGOs:
Faust Fluid Sac  U3+

RECOMMENDED IDs:
Molar or R Ish  U4
Rose Rodya  U3+
Flower Yi Sang  U3+
TT Hong Lu  U3+

RECOMMENDED EGOs:
Rodya Rime Shank  U4
Ryoshu F.F.T.F  U4
Don Telepole  U3+
Yi Sang Sunshower  U3+
Faust Hex Nail  U3+

???:
R Meursalt  U4 
While not a staple of any teams, he does have a slash S3 that can roll 21. At 3-5 base speed he also tends to be slow on turn 1. Consider taking him for if you have a bad turn 1 on the fairy (see fairy section for details)

LOL, LMAO EVEN:
Outis:  BL Outis is useful as a support unit for the +30% damage since it triggers on broken abno parts regardless of the total health left. 7 Outis is also a good option for the damage boost passive. 
Gregor:  Also a support unit but your choice will depend on what you prioritize. LCB/Chef Greg gives heals which could help keep a unit healthy after taking a hit without relying on fluid sac. Liu Greg has a nice damage boost which while somewhat conditional can be useful. 


>But what about [ID that just released]?

Tell Monzo to give me apologems so I can roll for it


NOTES BEFORE STARTING
Most of the turn pars were set to try and make it as easy as possible to hit while still being able to get 150 turns at the end. This means that with a good starting lineup getting less turns is generally doable. If you get a really shit setup and have to go over by a turn donâ€™t panic or reset 100 times, you can make that up in later fights. The Par turn for the entire run is 146 so thereâ€™s also 4 extra turns of slip built in.

Skill decks are saved between fights. In case you forgot how this works, you get 1 S3, 2 S2, and 3 S1 which have to be exhausted before it starts over. Yes, this means you have to actually use your S1s instead of just resetting until they go away.

Since you have to use S1s, itâ€™s recommended to use them as often as you can. Most enemies have a couple shitter attacks that S1s can clash with. Try to avoid using your S2â€™s and S3â€™s to clash these since you may need them for the kill turn. Unopposed attacks should also use S1â€™s unless you specifically need to hit a stagger threshold that turn.

You can reset enemy (and corrosion) targeting by restarting the fight. Do this if the game decides to fuck you with unavoidable damage on turn 1.

Thereâ€™s a way to manipulate AoE targeting from your units to get it to stop targeting units you donâ€™t want to hit. Currently the extra slots from AoE attacks prioritize empty slots and avoid slots where another unit is clashing/attacking. If you set your units to clash with slots you donâ€™t want the AoE to hit, you can set the AoE and then cancel the original clashes without affecting the AoE targeting. Very useful on fights with adds.

Most fights will reference setting up the â€œkill turnâ€. This should be pretty self explanatory, itâ€™s the turn you save all your S3â€™s for to use at the same time. The turn before the kill turn should be setup: get the charge you need, get Heath haste for 6 speed QS, use next turn damage boost skills like Ryo FFTF. Itâ€™s also important to make sure the enemy is either staggered/broken or 1-2 hits away from it by the start of the kill turn, since if they resist slash/envy it can REALLY fuck up Ryo and Donâ€™s S3 damage.


Alright, time to get started.

CYCLE 1
----------------

C1 FIGHT 1
TALISMAN DOLL					PAR TURN: 5
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Wrath/Gloom
RESIST: Slash, Envy/Sloth

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
This fight is just shit for the most part since you have 0 sanity and 0 EGO resources. At this point if you have a really bad skill lineup just restart since weâ€™re at the beginning. The dollâ€™s arm uses S1 clashable attacks, and the body uses tougher attacks you might need S2â€™s for. Clash with everyone except NClair and reset until you win every clash in the first 2 turns. Sinclairâ€™s unopposed attacks should be on the arm. 

Turn 3 is the dollâ€™s defense turn. In case you canâ€™t read, you must clash the defense skills with whichever sinners have talisman to give them back to the doll. If you do it right the gloom nukes he uses turn 4 should be weak enough to clash with decent S3s or base EGOs. 
Now if you have the correct lineup you might be able to nuke him turn 4, but without max SP itâ€™s a gamble. If you donâ€™t feel lucky, stagger the arm with unopposed attacks to stop the 2 nukes there and then clash the last one on the body with an S3 or EGO.
Turn 5 he should be staggered or close to it. At this point you can finish him off with some S3s. 

----------------

C1 FIGHT 2
STEAM MACHINE					PAR TURN: 5
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Sloth/Envy
RESIST: Slash, Gloom/Pride

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
Everyone hates this fucker, and for good reason. If you donâ€™t kill him the same turn you break the body he becomes resistant to all damage. So this whole fight is gonna be about setting up the kill turn.

Every turn he switches between protection and fragile. You will want to set up the kill turn to line up with the turn he has fragile. If you killed talisman in 4 turns he will start with fragile, in this case you want to set up the kill turn on turn 3. If you killed talisman in 5 turns he will start with protection, which means the kill turn is turn 4.
Once again try to set up your clashes to build up SP turns 1 and 2. If Sinclair corrodes you can restart the fight until one of his targets is the enemy. 

You must not stagger the body until the turn before the kill turn. If youâ€™re worried about staggering him too early you can target the steam blaster with your harder hitting attacks. Try to avoid using S3â€™s to clash so you can save them for the kill turn. 
Once heâ€™s staggered, itâ€™s time for the nuke. Hit him with some S3â€™s and he should crumble. If you need a little more damage set up extra fragile with Ryo FFTF the turn before.

Ideally this should kill him. If you are short and canâ€™t finish him off the next turn then restart until you can. Alternatively, if you can avoid staggering him until the kill turn, he will stay vulnerable for an extra turn after.

----------------

C1 FIGHT 3
DORIFTO FOX					PAR TURN: 5
WEAKNESS: Slash(Head)/Pierce(Body), Gluttony/Gloom
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
Another pain in the ass fight. This time the fox has protection every turn except turn 4, and the protection goes up every cycle. So our kill turn is going to be turn 4 to get around it. The head is weak to slash and body weak to pierce, so try to set up your clashes to maximize damage. Whoever gets swapped in this fight should also prioritize the weak clashes to build up SP.

Turn 3 the umbrellas show up. Only 2 in the first cycle so no problem, take them out with some S1â€™s to clean up the board. Be careful of attacking the fox, he gets the thorns status this turn which reflects damage as well as a bunch of counter skills. At turn start he also hits everyone with -20SP, so queue up a fluid sac here. Faust will eat a counter but should survive.

Turn 4 is the kill turn. The head is weak to slash so focus your S3â€™s here. He may survive depending on how many skills you can throw at him, but should be weak enough to finish next turn with unopposed attacks to the head. 

----------------
CYCLE 1 END
PAR TURN: 15

RECOMMENDED CYCLE BUFFS: ENVY, OPPORTUNISTIC
Opportunistic is an obvious pick, but if you lack TeleDon or otherwise feel charge gen is a problem, picking charge as the first buff is an option. Note you may have trouble beating the par turn without the extra damage.

CYCLE 2
----------------

C2 FIGHT 1
TALISMAN DOLL					PAR TURN: 4
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Wrath/Gloom
RESIST: Slash, Envy/Sloth

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
Now that you have some resources and SP, this should go much more smoothly. Build back any SP you lost from the fox then finish him off. Goal should be to kill him in 4 turns going forward.

Alternatively, a 3 turn option should be doable at this point, if you have enough S3â€™s lined up. Point your Nclair unopposed attacks, S2â€™s, and blunt EGOs at the body to stagger it on turn 2. If you can pull it off he should be effectively useless on turn 3 and not get any of the protection he normally does. At this point you can try to nuke him for a 3 turn clear.

----------------

C2 FIGHT 2
STEAM MACHINE					PAR TURN: 4
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Sloth/Envy
RESIST: Slash, Gloom/Pride

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
Same as last time. Set up your kill turn on 3 or 4 based on whether he starts with fragile or protection. If you feel really ballsy and have a good setup you can try to do a kill on turn 2 if he starts with protection.

----------------

C2 FIGHT 3
DORIFTO FOX					PAR TURN: 5
WEAKNESS: Slash(Head)/Pierce(Body), Gluttony/Gloom
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Molar Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
Again, same as the 1st cycle. This time he gets a whopping 3 umbrellas on turn 3. Still shouldnâ€™t be a problem.

----------------

C2 FIGHT 4
TIME NIGGERS					PAR TURN: 3
WEAKNESS: Pierce
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Sloth

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
These guys are just like the K Kop Killers from RR1. Kill them before they activate their self heal. With these guys all you have to do is keep their HP from getting between 6% and 24% so itâ€™s even easier now.

Turn 1 clash all their attacks, then point your extra unopposed attacks at the guy not defending. At this point he should be staggered or close to it, so send some S2â€™s or EGO at him to finish him off. Clash with the 2nd guy and he should be easy enough to finish off by turn 3.

----------------
CYCLE 2 END
PAR TURN: 31

RECOMMENDED CYCLE BUFFS: CHARGE, INHALING
(Pick envy if you picked charge last round)
Inhaling and Accelerating are somewhat interchangeable here, but thereâ€™s no significant healing you have to deal with this cycle so I consider inhaling the least impactful at this point.

C3 FIGHT 1
TALISMAN DOLL					PAR TURN: 4
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Wrath/Gloom
RESIST: Slash, Envy/Sloth

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
No changes from last time. With the charge buff you may find it easier to set up the 3 turn kill strategy this time around.

----------------

C3 FIGHT 2
STEAM MACHINE					PAR TURN: 4
WEAKNESS: Blunt, Sloth/Envy

WEAKNESS: Slash(Head)/Pierce(Body), Gluttony/Gloom
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Molar Ish, Yi Sang OR TT Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
4 umbrellas this time. Still easily manageable if you soften them up with fluid sac.

----------------

C3 FIGHT 4
TIME NIGGERS					PAR TURN: 3
WEAKNESS: Pierce
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Sloth

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
Same as the last time. If you have a good setup this one isnâ€™t too hard to 2 turn. Ryo or Don S3s can outright kill one of them if they are staggered, allowing you to focus everyone else on the other one to kill them both on the same turn.
 
----------------

C3 FIGHT 5
DUDE, WHEREâ€™S MY SKILLS			PAR TURN: 5
WEAKNESS: Slash, Lust/Pride
RESIST: Pierce, Gluttony/Gloom

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Sinclair, Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
The fairy lantern is pretty easy the first time around. 3 of your units are charmed and have their skills replaced with ones that donâ€™t deal damage. The other 4 have to kill the fairy before it gets its turn since it can beat on the charmed units with unclashable attacks. It only has ~100 health which isnâ€™t too hard to manage with S2â€™s or EGOs, especially if they deal slash damage.

However PM in their usual fashion coded it so that the charm skills completely replace the originals. This means once the units are uncharmed they will NOT have the same skills you were saving from the previous fight. This can be a good or a bad thing based on what you had left over from the last fight. Resetting for different skills will also work because of this.

Anyway, once you kill the fairy, the main body reveals itself. At this point you need to deal as much slash damage as possible to stagger it on this turn, while still setting yourself up for a kill turn next turn. If you fail to stagger turn 2 or kill turn 3, the fairy comes back and this time 4 units get charmed. If you canâ€™t kill it in one turn then follow up for a 5 turn clear just restart for better skill rolls.

You can manipulate the charmed units slightly by swapping in and out other units which may have different speed values. You can use this to try to recover a unit that had good skills saved but was just slightly too slow to escape. R Meur is a decent option as he deals lust/slash damage and his base speed is on the slower side.

----------------

C3 FIGHT 6
ELECTRIC DICKHEAD				PAR TURN: 6
WEAKNESS: Blunt(Head)/Pierce(Body), Sloth/Gloom
RESIST: Slash, Wrath/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Sinclair OR Yi Sang

STRATEGY:
By far the most obnoxious fight in the game, you will be begging for the steam machine back after this one. His entire gimmick is that he canâ€™t die until he runs out of self charge, which can delay the fight by several turns. You have to carefully manage this fight, but thankfully thereâ€™s an easy out at 6 turns if you need it.

1st turn, he starts with a shield on the head. Your goal should be to pop this shield with some blunt attacks/EGO. Otherwise he keeps some self charge that boosts his big dick AoE attack next turn. 2nd turn, clash his big AoE attack with EGO or a S3. NOTE: The clash preview for this attack is deceptive, it gains clash power based on self charge which his other skills give him at turn start. Either clash all the other skills first to remove the charge or be prepared to roll higher than what the preview shows. 

For the rest of the fight, you HAVE to clash and win against every attack. Failing the clash will let him gain stacks of self charge. You may have to rely on EGO more than usual here. Blunt attacks should go towards the head, pierce to the body.

Now, he has a stagger bar that can be activated by bursting tremor. However, you do NOT want to engage it at all. If you stagger him, his attacks immediately end, BUT he gains self charge. This is because all his attacks give self charge on combat start but only lose it on clash lose. So he keeps the charge from any uncompleted attacks. Yeah itâ€™s bullshit I know. If you break the body part without staggering, he will continue his attacks which will let you finish clashing against all of them. This is the ideal method to kill him without having to carefully watch the order of your attacks. 

At this point, as long as you avoid bursting tremor on the head until after itâ€™s broken, you can continue clashing with him and dealing damage until heâ€™s dead. If he manages to get some self charge back donâ€™t panic, you get a abno event to remove some of it, and on turn 6 he re-uses his shield. If the head is broken by that point the shield HP is halved, and he should be weak enough by then that you can power through and kill him. Destroying the shield removes all self charge so he will die at the end of the turn. Note he wonâ€™t die until the conclusion of the turn so beware setting up overkill that burn S3s and EGO unnecessarily.


ALT METHOD: SINKING DELUGE
A potential low turn method is to blow him up with a sinking deluge, thanks to his weakness to sinking and no attacking on the first turn. In order to pull this off you need enough gloom/envy for 2x overclocked Rime Shank + Yi Sangâ€™s S3 available by turn 2. 
Turn 1 have everyone attack the head as usual, but use OC RS to stack sinking on the body, then add count using one of Ishâ€™s skills (Ish can also go before RS here). If Yi Sang is able to go before Rodya and Ish have him put down an S1 or S2 to add extra stacks.
Turn 2, Yi Sang has to go after Rodya and Ish which may require some resets. Rodya should add more sinking stacks with a 2nd OC RS on the body, with Ish adding if possible. Yi Sang can then pop it with his S3 causing big dick damage. If it doesnâ€™t outright kill the pede turn 2 you should be able to easily pull it off next turn.

Recommended Team: Heath, Sinclair, Don, Ryo, Faust, Ish, Rodya

STRATEGY:
This time around he can spend 50 â€œturnsâ€ to heal 200 HP. Despite this you should still be able to burst him with the same methods as before.

WEAKNESS: Slash(Head)/Pierce(Body), Gluttony/Gloom
RESIST: Blunt, Wrath/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Molar Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
5 umbrellas this time. Need to start relying on the AoE EGOs and S2â€™s that can one-shot the umbrellas. Heâ€™s also starting to get a lot of protection, which means heâ€™ll have more health when turn 4 comes around. Be ready to use more S3â€™s and EGOs compared to previous rounds to take him out.

FAT FAIRY					PAR TURN: 4
WEAKNESS: Pierce, Wrath/Envy
RESIST: Blunt, Lust/Gluttony

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
This one is pretty straightforward. Focus extra attacks on the arm to stagger/break it, then target it on your kill turn. If you get to the point where he brings out the wine, break it. The tipsy status effect reduces clash power but his attacks will do no damage on the next turn, so just ignore the clashes and pummel him with one sided attacks.

----------------
CYCLE 4 END
PAR TURN: 92

RECOMMENDED CYCLE BUFFS: SLASH, THIRSTING
(pick envy if you picked slash last round)

Thirsting is going to suck up your EGO resources at this point (though itâ€™s still better than hardening which will really screw you over in these fights). If you were conservative on EGO to save resources for this round or used it heavily earlier to build some turn buffer, youâ€™ll still come out ok.

RESIST: Blunt, Lust/Gluttony

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Yi Sang OR Hong Lu

STRATEGY:
The fat fairy brings a friend this time. Despite that itâ€™s actually a pretty straightforward fight, just with 2x the HP. The weak point for each are their arms, which can be broken quickly and abused for kill turn damage. Destroying the wine is still a good option to give you a free turn to ignore fatty and put in some damage. Ignore the beanstalk, the benefits from destroying it arenâ€™t worth taking up attack slots.

WARP JANNY					PAR TURN: 9
WEAKNESS: Lust/Gluttony
RESIST: Pierce, Pride/Envy

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Sinclair

STRATEGY:
This guyâ€™s surprisingly a bit of a pushover for the penultimate fight. Turn 1 the most important thing aside from winning the clashes is to make sure whoever hits the left arm first resists slash so they donâ€™t get staggered from the counter.

Turn 2, he opens up some portals. If you donâ€™t kill the portals this turn they give him some buffs, so try to get as many as you can. Just match colors here, they are weak to the sin corresponding to their color (note the blue one is gloom, not pride). If any survive finish them off with unopposed attacks so you donâ€™t have to bother with clashing the attacks. After destroying the portals heâ€™ll come back. If you won the clashes turn 1 the arms should be weak now, break them and put down some damage. 

If you canâ€™t kill him in time heâ€™ll re-do the portal stage, take them out again and finish him off when he comes back out.

RECOMMENDED CYCLE BUFFS: ENVY, HARDENING

THE TERMINUS					PAR TURN: 6
WEAKNESS: NONE
RESIST: SLASH/PIERCE/BLUNT

Recommended Team: Heath, Don, Ryo, Faust, Rodya, Ish, Sinclair

STRATEGY:
Here we are, the final fight.
Turn 1 ignore the signpost since the defense skills will give you debuffs if you attack them. Use some weak skills on the flesh to soften it up this turn.

Turn 2, 1 flower will spawn for each of your units on the field. The color of the flower will depend on the units S1 sin type.
At this point, the most important thing is to kill these flowers as quickly as possible since they provide protection to the boss, sap 25% of their matching unitâ€™s health every turn, and then outright kills them on the 4th turn. Each flower is weak to the sin matching its color. So pull out your AoE EGOs and drop them as fast as possible. Killing the flowers will also return any lost health, but once theyâ€™re dead itâ€™s over. Starting on turn 3 the boss will also start throwing in attacks to make things even more difficult. 

Some abno events will be thrown in, accept it to boost damage both received and taken for a certain sin type. Youâ€™ll be dealing more damage than you take so itâ€™s better to accept these.
Once the flowers are taken care off, focus on and break the flesh. This will weaken the resistances and allow you to get your damage in. Ideally you should be able to finish him off the turn before he spawns the 2nd wave of flowers.
