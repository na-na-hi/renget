# Anon Finds A Ritual Book III
-> *Anon finds a ritual book in a thrift store and finds out that it is completely legit when it comes to summoning things. He is also however, a bastard that summoned a chaotic rat deity and proceeded to bust a nut in her within the first half hour of meeting. Having just barely survived his last (mercifully) brief plapping with Hakos, Anon is on the road to recovery... and revenge.* <-

"W-Wait, h-how much did you say it cost?"
"It was like a hundred and fifty dollars, something like that."
"Anon, can you like... p-put that in cheese terms? Been a while since I bothered with mortal currency..." 
"Well, with that sort of money I think that's like a few hundred slices of what I usually get you or some good chunks of the really nice stuff."

The rat's ears visibly wilt and she's starting to look more crestfallen by the minute, shifting anxiously from side to side as she stands in the doorway of the bathroom and watches you get ready. "I-I'm sorry that I can't... y-y'know.. fix your neck and stuff." Baelz meekly whispered, punctuating her words with a small sniffle and grabbing your attention.

Tugging your turtleneck's collar up, you manage to obscure the grip marks around your neck, turning to your new roommate with a sigh. You're lucky the cold weather's beginning to roll on in, so this choice of attire isn't strange. Turtlenecks weren't really your thing, but you've always had one in your closet just in case. "Calm down, it's really not that bad." You lie through your teeth. You're three Advils deep and it's not even the afternoon yet. Your hips feel like an entire MLB team took turns going to town on your pelvis with baseball bats, and swallowing things hurts because she decided to throttle you. "Is that.. what you're wearing?" You ask, looking her up and down.

"I-Is this bad?" She asked nervously, sending a momentary pang of guilt through you. For such a powerful being, Hakos looks incredibly vulnerable all of a sudden, looking down at her ensemble and picking at it like a dissatisfied child. It just doesn't feel right trying to take advantage of her right now, especially when she's showing such concern for your health. The 4'11" girl looks up at you, staring deep into your eyes with those beautiful hues of hers. "How about this, then...?" Snatching a few images from your memory, her complicated and loud outfit became a more subdued one, leaving her in a white button-down shirt as well as a cute black skirt decorated with red and white stripes. 

"... A-Anon? Say something, will ya? I-It's not nice to stare..." She said, letting out a small nervous giggle and swaying in place whilst looking at you expectantly. Your response comes in the form of an outstretched hand towards her, patting her head. You swear she's trying to lean into your hand. 

"It looks fine, Baelz. We're not even going to any really fancy places for our date anyways."

Your words bring a deep crimson red to her cheeks, almost matching her hair- which she begins to twirl a lock of around one finger. "D-Date? W-Wait, I-I thought we were just g-going shopping for a new b-bedframe together..."

"It's a shopping date, Bae," you assure her, taking her small hand with one of your much larger ones, "this is your punishment for beating me up." You practically have to drag her along, since it looks like the revelation of your outing being called a date and your new nickname for her was too much. She's mostly incoherent right now, babbling as she follows. 

"B-But, Anon! A-Aren't dates romantic?!"

You look down at her, making solid eye contact. "So what if they are? Is there an issue?" As soon as the words leave your mouth, you instantly feel a wave of attachment wash across you from your connection. You're playing an extremely dangerous game by the looks of it, toying with the heart of a deity that could unmake you with a wave of her hand. Then again, you're pretty much already committed to it. What are you going to do, get a *new girlfriend*? 

Locking your door behind you the next time you glance at Baelz, you notice that her mouse ears have disappeared entirely- her human ears more visible and bearing tiny mousetrap earrings. That solves one issue you were going to bring up before you ran into another person. "Do you wanna shop or grab a bite to eat first?" Baelz mulls over this as you walk, chewing on her bottom lip while she makes herself cozy against your arm, her free hand resting on your bicep and slowly feeling up the musculature of your arm. 

"Shopping," she decides, resting her head against you, "we can get the work out of the way first and then have the rest of the day for fun." Despite the slight chill in the air and a subtle kiss from the wind here and there, she seems to practically radiate warmth. Through her clinging to you, you're afforded protection from the cold, remaining perfectly cozy through even the most prolonged breezes. "Y-You won't have that much trouble working, right?"

Letting out a small sigh, you give her hand a gentle squeeze. "I got two days off work, it's alright." You neglect to mention that it's the last of your vacation days, but you don't need her feeling any worse or learning that you can't simply take time off work to be with her. The idea of vacation time being limited might just push her over the edge, and you really need the money. 

Eventually, the two of you made your way into a mattress store, brushing past a few other people and perusing the available frames. You had a nice wooden one before, but with Hakos being there with you now... You cast a devious look at her while she was busy bent over and inspecting a price tag. Ensuring no one was looking in your direction, you promptly grabbed a nice handful of her pert ass, eliciting a surprised squeak from her. "I don't think getting the same frame's gonna work, I'll be needing a metal one. It'll last longer for when you're riding me again." You whisper in a husky seductive tone, taking a step back and admiring your handiwork as the girl turns into a furiously blushing mess.

"A-Anon! Y-You...!" She sputtered, looking around and realizing she was forced to stay her hand since a few people had glanced over at her. "Y-You lil' rat!" Baelz hissed quietly, taking her place by your side again. As you wave a salesman over to discuss buying the frame and shipping it to your place, she hides her face in your side, clutching onto your arm.

"Is your... friend okay?" The uniformed man asks, nodding at Hakos as he takes your card details down.

With a nod, you merely grin. "Yeah, she's just a little sick. Nothing to worry about though." You explain, all while projecting all manners of lewd and sexual thoughts across your connection to her. While you're not sure she's getting any full images, you know that the general gist is making it over towards her. 

"We'll get the frame to your house in two days. We appreciate your business, sir!"

Waving the man goodbye, you leave the store and look down at your companion. "How're you holding up, Bae?" Her response is to look up into your eyes- and immediately flood the connection with a wave of completely unmitigated lust. Before, you could deal with keeping your dick down, but having your mind filled with lewd fantasy after lewd fantasy (in painfully high quality nonetheless) crafted by the rat instantly gets you painfully aroused. You manage to hide your growing erection by stuffing a hand into your pocket and using that to disguise your bulge.

"C-Can we g-go home," Baelz whined, lightly yet insistently tugging on your sleeve and pressing her knees together, "y-you're gonna make me feel *that* way again." But as insistent as she is on going home, you still pull her along with a devious smile on your face. You weren't going to go home without getting any food first.

"We still need to go eat, remember?" You chide, earning a muffled groan of despair from your companion as she pushes her face into your side. From what you know so far, she's capable of resisting these feelings to a certain degree but she also seems to have her guard down sometimes, allowing you to smack her with a big load of emotions without any time for preparation. Fortunately though, you find a food truck and decide you won't trouble her with having to wait for a table in a real sit-down establishment. A Mexican-Japanese taco truck, you look over the menu and decide to torment her even further. 

"Can you order for us?"

Baelz eyes you with suspicion, but the moment she turns your head to the menu and the moment you're sure no one's looking, you surreptitiously slip your hand out of her grasp and grab her ass. The action earns a gasp of surprise from her and an immediately annoyed look, but you aren't done there. Sliding your hand further down, you come to realize two things: she's not wearing any underwear and Hakos is utterly drenched. You're surprised that she hasn't been leaving a trail of juices like a leaking car on the road. 

"A-Anon, d-don't-" She begins, but the firm look in your eyes lets her know that this is her punishment for being so rough. Swallowing nervously as you slowly push a finger into her tight cunny, she looks up at the man in the truck. "H-Hah, h-hi! C-Can we g-get the L-Loco Chees-Unh! Cheese Taco, a-and t-the S-Sashimi B-BurritOH~!" Baelz suddenly tightens up as you add another finger into her, clenching down on your digits like a vice grip. No one seems to be looking at the two of you save for the person taking your order, but they're too busy grooving to the truck's music to really notice anything off.

"Sure, the total comes out to nine dollars and fifty eight cents."

You fork over a tenner happily, while Baelz covers her face with her hands as you toy with her insides, swirling your fingers around and exploring every little nook and cranny. "A-Anon, I- O-Ouuuugh~!" Much to your surprise, the goddess finishes all over your hand leaving it covered with warm, sticky girlcum. Red in the face and panting, you can only ask the recovering girl one question:

"... Are you an exhibitionist?"

The fact that she's silent and your connection is still emitting lust confirms your suspicions. 

"Well... aren't you a dirty girl." As you say these words, another wave of pleasure hits you suddenly and you realize she's even worse. She enjoys being degraded. Your order comes and you take it with your clean hand (you aren't a savage), tugging her along when all of a sudden, you fall.

Stumbling, the world goes dark for a half second before you reappear in your living room, almost spilling the packaged food. "HOOOOLY SHIT!" You almost topple into your dining room table, catching yourself in time and setting the goods down. "B-Baelz?!" You call out, only to find the girl sitting on your couch, legs spread wide open. 

"A-Anon..."

Her rose is glistening with fluids, weeping with need as she spreads her lips with two fingers. Looking off to the side, her small chest rises and falls quickly, tail flicking around anxiously. You don't need any other signs to get your pants off and get to work. The tip of your cock slips right into her, eliciting a loud moan from the rat and sending a lightning bolt of pleasure through your body- strong enough to dampen the pain coming from the last time you fucked. 

Baelz' hands reach for your neck but you stop them. It's her turn to feel a little something, you think as you grab her legs and put them on your shoulders. Letting out a small sound of surprise as you adjust her, the girl grabs at the couch's armrests as you begin pounding her from a new angle. Her insides are intensely hot, conducting an almost unbearable amount of heat into your lower body as you thrust into the squealing rat below you. 

"F-FFFFFUCK ME, ANON! C-CALL ME DIRTY AGAIN! S-STUPID, W-WEAK HUMAN WITH SUCH A GOOD COCK!" She practically screams, scratching at your shoulders as lust clouds your mind. It's clear that even having sex with a human like you must be some sort of taboo and incredibly arousing to her, considering how you're so powerless in comparison. The springs of the couch also begin to creak as you ravage Baelz' pussy, but you know that it'll hold for the time being.

Your hunger for food forgotten, all you can really focus on now is this redhaired girl rapidly devolving into gibberish as your member stretches her out and slams against her deepest parts on every thrust. "FFFFUCK! G-GODS, Y-YOU'RE SO BIG," Hakos groaned, her hair a disheveled mess as she manages to make eye contact with you. "I-IN ME! A-ALL OF IT, P-PLEASE!" She begs, trying to pull you closer into her with her hands, but you refuse to get closer. Your hands resting on the top of the couch's backrest, you grunt as your connection with Baelz begins to overwhelm your thoughts, filling you with the drive to do one thing.

**Fuck.**

The goddess cries out in pleasure as you mercilessly piston your painfully hard manhood into her, settling into a quick in-out rhythm that churns her insides up and fries her thoughts, turning her into an unintelligible mess. Her tail wraps around your torso, as if trying to make sure you won't run away, but that's the last thing on your mind as you roughly breed the girl. Your breathing picks up and you feel a familiar pressure building up within you, consuming you with waves of pleasure.

With one hand supporting you now, you push two fingers into her mouth, past her sharp teeth. Eyes locked on yours, she muffled her moans by sucking on your fingers lovingly, tongue swirling around your digits hungrily. Her limit comes at the same time as yours, mouth popping open and spine arching as you fully sheath your cock in her and fill her needy pussy up with a few healthy doses of your hot spunk. Basking in the afterglow of your orgasm, you slowly pull out of her with a wet sound (and a moan from her), resting your cum covered cock on the side of her face.

Eyes distant and unfocused, her tongue slipped out of her mouth, slowly lapping at it as if out of reflex.

"We'll... we'll go on a real date next time, okay...?"

But there's no response from her yet.
