Makeup is one of the most efficient forms of passing and learning to apply it well can boost your appearance by 1-2 ‘points’. Please keep in mind that everything comes down to personal preferences and that anything I mention here is what has worked for me and if you find that something else works for you, please mention it in /mtfg/

##**Moisturiser**##

One of the best ways to fight off signs of premature agony and keep your skin glowing and fresh is by incorporating a high quality moisturiser into your daily routine. Using moisturiser at the start of the day can also temporarily diminish the appearance of existing wrinkles. Moisturising also prevents skin from becoming dried out and flaky which can lead to unevenness and discolouration. Furthermore, when your skin dries out, the glands produce extra sebum to compensate for the lack of moisture which can clog your pores and cause breakouts.

I recommend The Ordinary Natural Moisturising Factors + HA facial moisturiser. It works for all skin types and is targeted at all ages.

##**Sunscreen**##

Regular sunscreen use protects against photoaging: the wrinkling, spotting and loss of elasticity caused by exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Studies (such as this one) also show that regular sunscreen use may also reverse the effects of photoaging.

I highly recommend the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch sunscreen because its one of the few sunscreens available that makes your skin look almost matte rather than oily.

Never mix your sunscreens with other products and allow your sunscreen to dry down on your skin before applying anything on top!!!

##**Primer**##

Primers prepare your skin for any makeup products that you plan to put on your face, giving them something to hold onto so your makeup lasts throughout the day. Many makeup primers are formulated with silicone-based polymers, such as dimethicone, which assist in minimising the appearance of pores and smoothing fine lines (if you have skin conditions such as cystic acne check with a dermatologist or do a patch test before using a silicon based primer as they might cause allergic reactions or rashes).

The Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Primer is a popular primer with great reviews. However, if you have specific skin concerns such as redness, colour correcting primers such as the Clinique Redness Solution Base may be more suitable.

##**‘Foundation’**##

Do not go too heavy on your base makeup. Instead of using foundation all over your face, opt for a tinted moisturiser or a BB cream instead. Alternatively, you could mix a few drops of foundation into a small amount of moisturiser and make your own ‘tinted moisturiser’. Foundation has a very ‘cakey’ look and can be clocked from a few meters away. Foundation also tends to ‘melt’ off your face after a few hours of wear, leaving your skin blotchy and uneven. Blend with your fingers or a damp beauty sponge for a natural look.

Tinted moisturisers such as the NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturiser or the Estée Lauder Double Wear All-Day Glow BB Cream are good options.

This step can be skipped for everyday makeup in most cases if you prefer to have less on your skin and is only necessary if you have a large amount of unevenness in your skin tone e.g. rosacea.

##**Concealer**##

A small amount of concealer is one of the most important elements of your everyday makeup. A few dots under your eyes to conceal under-eye circles and a small amount on on any blemishes such as pimple scarring is enough. Blend with your fingers or a damp beauty sponge for a natural look. Do not go overboard and ‘highlight’ your nose/chin/forehead with your concealer like a YouTube ‘beauty-guru’. The less you have on your face, the better

I recommend the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer or the MAC Studio Finish Concealer. Remember to get your concealer in your exact skin tone, not a shade lighter for a more seamless and skin-like look.

##**Powder**##

A light dust of powder can be used to set your makeup and hold it in place. This can be skipped if you’re only going to be out for a short amount of time. A fluffy brush or a damp beauty sponge can be used to apply a very small amount of powder to the t-zone or any other parts of the face where your makeup tends to not last. Powders can also give your face an ‘airbrushed’ look.

Powders such as the Kat Von D Lock-It Setting Powder, the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder or the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Pressed Powder can be used. (Any powder can be used, translucent power or powder that’s a similar colour to your skin looks best).

##**Bronzer and Highlighter**##

Use a bronzer to bring back the warmth and depth around the perimeters of your face after applying your base makeup. Bronzer can also be used to lightly ‘contour’ your face - use a larger brush for a more natural look and to avoid harsh contour lines. Use bronzer to diminish any overly large/prominent features e.g. apply bronzer to the forehead to simulate a ‘shadow’ which makes the forehead appear smaller.

I personally prefer cream bronzers as they are easier to blend and have a more skin-like finish but powder bronzers work just as well. Some bronzers you may want to try include the Benefit Hoola Bronzer or the Bobbi Brown Bronzing Powder. It is also possible to use a liquid or stick concealer in a darker shade to bronze and contour your face.

Highlighter is not a necessary part of your everyday makeup but you may use it if you wish. Avoid powder highlighters as they tend to have chunks of sparkle/glitter in them which can look tacky. If you wish to use highlighter, use a small amount of liquid highlighter as they tend to blend better into the skin and draw less attention to skin texture than powder highlighter. I personally like to use a small dab of Vaseline on my cheekbones instead of a highlighter because it mimics the skins natural glow much better than sparkly products.

##**Blush and Lips**##

Use a nude/pink/red/orange lipstick (stick/cream not liquid) for blush and lipstick. Take some of the lipstick on your fingers and dab it onto your cheeks or just dot the lipstick onto your cheeks (make sure to swipe a layer off it if you do this before applying it to your lips) and blend it out with a damp beauty sponge, a brush or your fingers. I like to take my blush over the bride of my nose and up onto my temples slightly for a cuter and more 'sunkissed' look. Dab the same lipstick onto your lips for a natural flush and top with a gloss or a lip balm to make your lips look plump.

I like to use the Revlon ColorBurst Matte Balm in ‘Striking' for my lips and cheeks on most days but I also tend to reach for the Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in ‘Rum Raisin’ or the Sephora Collection Original Rouge Cream Lipstick in ‘Love You Too’.

##**Eyes and Brows**##

I personally prefer to leave the eyes fairly natural for day to day makeup but you may add shimmer on the lid if you wish. Some of the same bronzer you used on your face in the crease and outer corner of your eye gives a really pretty look. A sweep of the bronzer under the lash line can also be flattering on some face shapes. Add a tiny amount of highlighter in the inner corner of your eye if you wish. Use a black mascara (brown if you have light hair) on your lashes, making sure to avoid clumps. Tight-line your eyes with a brown or black pencil to make your lashes look fuller if you wish. For smaller eyes, take a light coloured eyeliner pencil (peachy-beige or white) and run it along your waterline. For your eyebrows, use a pencil to lightly trace the bottom outline of your eyebrow and make upwards strokes from it, mimicking hairs, to fill in sparse areas. Do not ‘draw’ anything onto your skin to extend your eyebrow from its natural shape e.g. a longer tail. I adore the [‘soap brows’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBuq2bqCXK0) trend for when im going for a more bushy eyebrow look.

I like to use the TooFaced Better Than Sex mascara or the Maybelline Lash Sensational Mascara. For eyebrows I recommend the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz or the NYX Micro Brow Pencil.
