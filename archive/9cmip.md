&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;It was a Friday afternoon at the Mars base and the Sun was slowly lowering towards the red mountains, making the whole place even more saturated. The outlands were nothing but crimson hills and dust but the streets weren’t as plain as the only shade of red on them was the strange permanent mist in the distance while the rest were other colours, though mostly grey and silver of the modern-looking modular buildings with some green Earthy vegetation thrown in there.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;After finishing a day in my job I was returning back home. It was a short stroll through the hi-tech town, though it was always interesting to see our new neighbours acclimatizing to the human environment. The demons have been here for a few months now and many of them were quite at home here (and happily accepting jobs their abilities made easier), though some were still a little freaked out of man-made mundane things or even the sudden differences in their own hierarchy. Some demons were taking their distance from regular manholes in case they would start spewing lava or blood and it wasn’t unusual to see previously lower caste demons run away from occasional Barons they would accidentally bump into. They were a strange bunch, acting a bit uncomfortable around humans at first while never having problems wearing skimpy clothes (sometimes not even that) from the moment they set foot here, but I was glad to live here with them.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I turned at a street corner when suddenly I saw a long strand of red light appear out of nowhere, followed by a pair of long, thin fingers on my shoulders. I jumped and looked back to see a familiar, skinny face with a wide smile on it.
&emsp; &emsp;“Lerix? God damn it, you scared the shit out of me,” I gasped and added, “…just like always.”
&emsp; &emsp;Lerix, or, by his basically unpronounceable full name, Tek’hi kah-de Lehrixin, was a Summoner and after encountering him in a local bar, classily sipping tea (his species really liked it), we became strange friends; and since my assigned housing was awfully empty, I invited him to live with me. Most other people went for other demon species they considered less ‘odd’ and usually of the opposite gender for obvious reasons, but hey, us living together has been working out so far and he was quite decent and much more modest than other Hell spawn.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;“What are you doing here, anyway?” I asked.
&emsp; &emsp;“Well… I noticed you were still crawling back to our apartment and I didn’t feel like waiting for you to come back. Those five minutes at the speed of a ‘Cubus won’t kill me.” The Summoner said, with a mildly snarky tone. His kind was used to moving very fast and even though they didn’t mind the general speed of most human actions, transporting somewhere slowly was driving them crazy. I realized he’d rather float around me at an excruciatingly slow pace than to wait at home, possibly doing something more productive. Was I really that good of a company to him? I grew accustomed to him in the past few months but I wasn’t sure what to attribute it to. How did he feel about me? I wrapped an arm around his lower torso (as high as I could, since he was floating half a metre above the ground and was quite noticeably taller than me), catching him a little off guard with it as he looked at me with a bit of a surprised expression before wrapping my shoulders in one of his fleshy wings. Now that was unexpected.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;As were walking (and floating), I began to inspect the membrane he covered my arms with, looking at how it slowly pulsated and moved when I touched it and how it connected to his back. I was fascinated by how the demons’ bodies worked and vice versa; they were intrigued by our smooth skin and soft hair and the terrene residents of Mars were interested in the combination of their harder carapaces and fleshy parts that shouldn’t work, but they did and somehow in their roughness looked sleek and elegant.
&emsp; &emsp;I looked closely at how Lerix’s legs connected to his torso by strings of exposed muscle and how his ridged pelvis moved separately of his main body in small circles to smoothly keep balance when floating. Out of nowhere, he dug his slim fingers into my hair and started ruffling it a little, trying to predict what will happen when he throws it in one direction and then another. For such bony fingers they were unusually soft and with each caress I felt growing warmth and awkward tingling in my chest. Him being still so elegant didn’t help at all, even if he wore a dress similar to an ancient chiton paired with a long, formerly ceremonial skirt. What the hell was going on?
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Before things got too weird, we arrived at our destination. As we entered the apartment’s lobby, I let go of Lerix to take off my shoes while he stayed in place, looking at me. I leaned over to untie my footwear and noticed my hands were shaking a little, but I managed to calm down and stop the tremors. Usually I would go take a shower and then just chill out, enjoying the free time. I looked at Lerix and he looked at me, both puzzled (or just me?) at what was going on. I definitely needed a shower right now. He didn’t need to wash himself as most demon species could control their metabolism and Summoners were able to not sweat at all in usual conditions, but I really had to go. He was still looking at me with an undecipherable look on his eyeless face, floating in the hall.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The lukewarm water had a calming effect and I could think more clearly about what happened. I was just basically making out with a male demon in public. Not that it wasn’t that uncommon of an occurrence here but why me? I was never attracted to men, I always considered myself straight back on Earth and before the Invasion. No matter if a guy was slim or bulky, I felt weird even hugging a male friend, and here I was, smooching and sniffing on a faceless, skinny demon from Hell with his wings and little embers on his back and stomach, his eyeless face with his strange smirk and the initiation artefact in his skull stretching and changing the shape of his head; his slim figure with contrasting wide hips; his spider-like fingers with long but perfectly trimmed dark nails… I opened my eyes and realised that every thought of him gave me a tingling sensation somewhere low. Or maybe it was just the dripping stream of water. Yes, it was definitely the water.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;When I came out of the bathroom and got in some clothes, I encountered Lerix in the living room, leaned against the kitchen line while floating and holding a stone tablet in one hand and an electronic one in another. I didn’t know what to do, should I say something? I didn’t want to act like nothing happened; it would be blatantly obvious and was it really what I wanted to do?
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;“So, uh…” He looked up. Shit, my mouth’s dry. I didn’t have such a problem talking to him even when I first met him. Act cool, you don’t want to go too hard at this. I noticed the stone he was holding was different than the others he used to study and that it had some inscriptions on it, which could be a good conversation starter.
&emsp; &emsp;“What are you doing?”
&emsp; &emsp;Could have been better. After a short pause and a shift between a smile and a frown, he responded, “I found this ancient tablet in an old ruin near one of the monuments of the old demons, before I escaped. It explains the difference between this plane of existence and our planes. And, by demons’ principles, it tries to explain why we’re supposed to conquer other dimensions. Based on its age and the energy in it, it was meant to direct the first spawn to an assault on another plane eons ago. But it had the opposite effect on me.”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The room turned silent. I tried to digest what he said and inquired, “What do you mean with that?”
&emsp; &emsp;Was he different before that? He slowly pitched his head down and explained in a quiet voice, “I was a priest in a blood temple, like most other Summoners. My whole life ever since I was a larva was dedicated to keeping the hordes focused on destruction. I’ve lead and performed sacrifices and I lived only to spill blood and inflict hatred. There was always a hint of doubt every time I preached about the ‘betrayers’ who didn’t know anything about us or anytime I cut out a heart of a sacrificial low order demon, but I always tried to ignore it.”
&emsp; &emsp;His voice gradually intensified until he was basically shouting, “I was a monster and I’m still trying to figure out what this stone did to me. I looked at it and suddenly had different thoughts, different needs. I suddenly wanted to talk to someone and not spill their blood; instead only mindless beasts were there with me.”
&emsp; &emsp;His arms were shaking and short flashes of red light were shooting out of him, before calming down and continuing, “I escaped out of there and got here. There were other demons like me in this place. I used to send humans to damnation but they welcomed me with open arms. I just wanted to talk to someone and now I could. I was trying to forget all of it, but I couldn’t. I was a monster and I know I’m not anymore, but my past still haunts me.”
&emsp; &emsp;His voice was quiet and trembling. Without thinking, I jumped and hugged him tightly. I didn’t know what I was doing; I just wanted to tell him that I don’t mind. That he’s different. That everything’s alright now. “Oh, Lerix…”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;A few tears started coming down my face and after a while I finally let go and looked at the poor demon that was still in shock, looking at me, mouth half-open. I’ve never seen him broken or out of control like that. I leaned to him again and moved my head closer to his. Our foreheads almost bumped when I impulsively put my lips on his and kissed him passionately. He tried to make a surprised muffled yelp, but I was unrelenting, playing with his mouth and bright white teeth. After a while he recovered from his shock and quickly responded, opening his lips to me and rolling his tongue out and tying it with mine.
&emsp; &emsp;It was smooth in the centre but ridged on the sides and covered in warm saliva. I let one arm go and placed its hand on his hard, bumpy chest and pressed it, earning another yelp from him, this time deeper and more lustful, before going further in on his tongue, tasting and grinding it more, our dribble mixing and mellowing out his strangely deliciously bitter saliva. I couldn’t help but start grunting with my eyes closed and nerves in my tongue overloaded while the rest of body rubbed against his.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Finally, our tongues slowly halted to a stop and exited each other’s mouth with only a thin trail of mixed saliva still connecting us before breaking and disappearing. His hands were shaking and he tried not to look in my face.
&emsp; &emsp;“So… I suppose… I thought you’d be angry at me…” I put a finger on his mouth, moved my head closer to his, trying to think of something to say but he was quicker, pulling it away and continuing, “You’re not disgusted? I…”
&emsp; &emsp;I didn’t let him finish and interrupted him, “Who you were back then means nothing. You are who you are now,” I placed my hand on his bony cheek, “And you’re here, with me. And I’m glad for that. I want someone to talk to, too.” He stared at me for a second before letting out a short nervous laugh and hugging me back, even tighter than I did. He was still trembling.

&emsp; &emsp;We stood there in embrace for what seemed like forever and even though out of all things at that point I wouldn’t mind it lasting an actual eternity, I had to let go. He wasn’t shaking anymore and his lips were now forming a smile.
&emsp; &emsp;“So… would you want some tea?” I asked. He laughed and looked away before ruffling my hair.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Later that day Lerix and I were lying on a sofa, spending the free time cuddling and talking while constantly switching positions. Sometimes I would lay down my head against his warm, hard chest, covered in his fleshy wings and listening to him talking about the demon society, its stories and his own tales. Most of the time they were bloody and gritty, but his smooth voice that seemed to talk normally and whisper both at the same time was so sleek and calming that I didn’t mind while his fingers were dancing in my hair and its nails gently scratched the underlying scalp.
&emsp; &emsp;Other times he was lying in my arms, light and curled up with my chin resting on his skull artefact and my hands feeling every bump and crease on his body while I was telling him stories back from Earth and its history. While doing this, we were both inspecting each other’s bodies, though he had a much more difficult time as I was wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants while he was covered only in his long skirt, based on an old Summoner sacrificial attire but less ornate and supposedly more comfortable. I had to admit that it did look cool, though.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The sun was already behind the Mars’s mountains but its light was still visible, changing the place’s colours to dark blue, similar to what twilights looked like on Earth. The apartment’s automatic lights were slowly starting up to match the outside’s quickly diminishing sunshine. We were lying in a warm embrace, sharing a quiet moment, when I sleepily turned my head and started kissing him on one of his mandibles on his chin and then on the other. He looked down and where his mandibles were before was now his mouth with thin lips that were a darker shade of blue than the rest of his face. They were probably the only thing Lerix changed on his body after coming to Mars, both for practical and aesthetic reasons. They looked cute on him and I liked that he kept himself truly demonic without going overboard with the look changes like some of the other demons. I was thinking of how soft they were in comparison to the other parts of his body as we joined them and started making out, red on blue.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;We were kissing gently and slowly, with our tongues mostly hidden behind our teeth only sometimes to come out and wrap around each other for a brief moment before returning. Soon, our lips split up to move downwards, caressing and tasting each other’s bodies, but before, I took off my shirt, exposing my modest torso. I wasn’t really in a good shape but not too shabby, either. Even then, I always felt a little embarrassed when looking at the giant muscles of Hell Knights and Barons alike, proudly showing their abs and biceps on the streets. Lerix didn’t seem to mind, though.
&emsp; &emsp;“Whoa… I didn’t know humans really are so smooth and soft all around…”
&emsp; &emsp;He said this as he moved his arms to touch the skin on my body and I leaned to taste his, both of us softly moaning at us caressing each other. While Lerix’s body didn’t really taste of anything, even though I could feel a very mildly bitter, yet pleasant flavour, similar to what his saliva was like, wrapping my tongue around various bumps and distensions was strangely exciting. My body didn’t really have those but I could feel Lerix’s tongue dancing around on my chest. He seemed to be interested in how differently hard parts of my body were, from the harder chest where my ribcage was, through my stomach with a tiny little bit of muscle (where I’ve got it is beyond me) to my soft underbelly while his hands were feeling my stretched neck and the visible collarbone.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Meanwhile, I was interested in the fiery embers on his torso and back and I noticed the skin around them was thinner and softer than the rest. I licked it and felt the Summoner’s inner warmth that was perhaps caused by the flames. Suddenly, he sharply hissed and spasmed, shifting away from me, gripping my shoulders painfully – I accidentally put my tongue in one of these embers.
&emsp; &emsp;“Oh my god, I… I’m so sorry… Did it hurt?” I asked with an apologizing look.
&emsp; &emsp;“No, not really, it’s just really uncomfortable. It’s okay, but just be more… careful… there.”
&emsp; &emsp;As he was saying this, he was slowly moving away from me and now where his chest used to be was his underbelly with a belt of exposed muscle coming out of his skirt. He freed his wings from under himself, wrapping them around my back and I wrapped my arms around his back while I fondled the red tissue with my mouth before being stopped by the dress again. I looked down and noticed a sharp bulge, very much visible on the white cloth.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I decided to try something and squeeze my hand inside. Meanwhile, Lerix must have encountered my sweatpants already, as he decided to do the same. Suddenly, we both found what we were looking for. I was already hard down there but it was nothing compared to when Lerix’s hard, cold fingers wrapped around my member. I grunted quietly but he did more when I grabbed what he was hiding. It was both smooth in some parts and rough and ridged in others, just like the rest of his body. His vocal response was intense, with him grunting so roughly it sounded almost flanged, mixed with a high-pitched yelp. I started moving my fingers around his shaft, blindly inspecting the texture of it, before getting to the head that was similar to a human’s but ending with a sharper tip and with somewhat clearly defined edges. I couldn’t be sure with the details and I wanted to see it, or more. He was doing the same with my own penis, humming to himself when he encountered the smooth, round ending. I‘ve forgotten how long it was since I last hooked up with someone here on Mars; but it was damn long, too damn long – and after today, I could imagine doing that with Lerix. We stopped and looked at each other.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;He was breathing more heavily and his mouth was open with a loving smile on it and his tongue out. He slowly revealed his teeth, turning the gentle grimace into a luscious grin. Even without eyes his expression was clear. I grabbed his skirt and pulled it down, my mind racing trying to think of what would be there, revealing his demon cock. It was long, though a well-endowed human could surpass it; curved a little; thinner a bit in the middle. There was a wide smooth bulging line of red muscle in the middle going from the base up to the head while the purplish blue sides were ridged and had thick soft-looking barbs on them.
&emsp; &emsp;And the head, the head was longer than what I expected and curved a bit, so it faced upwards. It had a smooth coloured pattern between red, blue and purple, looking like a blend between the sections of the shaft. And the whole thing wasn’t circular, it had three edges, like a prism, though they were smoothed out, much more on the shaft to the point it actually almost looked round and less alien. There was a strange lack of testicles, maybe they were internal, but it made the whole thing look cleaner and more elegant. I was in awe from how devilishly glorious and beautiful it looked. I could only let out a quiet “Wow…” before grabbing it in my right hand, causing Lerix to shudder a bit. I noticed there was no foreskin, so no skin was curling up at the base but it made it pretty much impossible to jerk it without some sort of lubrication. At first I just gently caressed it with my fingers, exploring the texture of it, but it wasn’t enough. I wanted more.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;My lips slowly touched the pointed head that was surprisingly warm. Lerix nervously twitched and asked, “What are you doi--?” I looked up and turned him down with a quiet “Shhh…”
&emsp; &emsp;He tried to say something but I already returned my attention lower and pressed the warm head between lips. It was somewhat harder than a human’s, probably, but it still felt quite soft. I then moved on to the shaft. The smooth, fleshy stripe was even warmer than the head but otherwise more-or-less similar to that of a man. The sides were much more interesting. It was actually quite cold, even surprisingly so and it made an amazing contrast to the centre line. It was rough and harder than the other parts but still relatively soft. I noticed the spikes in particular weren’t sharp at all and felt more like rubber, not squeezing under the softest of pressure but not too strong to inflict pain when pressed hardly against tissue.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I moved back to the head and slowly started putting it in my mouth, applying pressure on it with my lips while licking the very top with my tongue and being careful not to graze it with teeth. It had its effect as Lerix twitched again and put an arm in my hair, gently and slowly ruffling it while inhaling and exhaling more sharply. It had a little bit of that strange bitterness going on, but it was very mild. I wanted more. I got to the end before stopping and moving back. I did this a few times, always getting a quiet sigh from Lerix and a stronger press on my head which in turn made me huff air and grunt sensually. The next time I got to the shaft, I didn’t stop and continued. The middle part was smooth and hot but the sides were a bit rough, but nothing unmanageable. I got to the middle of the shaft before going back, leaving it covered in saliva, making it glisten. I decided to gradually pick up the speed a bit and instinctively I began bobbing my head in a pattern to make the contact as seamless as possible and soon, Lerix was gasping for air and moaning, indulging in pleasure I was giving him. I grabbed him by the stomach with one hand and a hard butt cheek with the other while he clenched my head in his hands even further and started pushing it in and out, taking control of my movement.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly he pushed my head a bit too much, too quickly and the head of his member slammed into the back of my throat. I couldn’t help but gag before quickly moving away and almost spitting out his cock with a thick line of saliva still connected to it. This time it was him who began apologizing, stuttering, “Are you hurt? I didn’t… I didn’t want t-to--“ I interrupted him, “It’s fine, it’s just a thing humans have. I’ll be ready next time, okay?”
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;“Okay.”
&emsp; &emsp;He was still unnerved, so I continued, “Hey, at least we’re even now, right?”
&emsp; &emsp;He laughed a little, breaking his worries before I returned my attention to his warm member. I put it in my mouth again and slowly, carefully I moved my head forwards and didn’t stop until I couldn’t go any further. I realised that if I was wary enough, I didn’t have any problems with it touching my throat. I moved back and forth slowly, gradually picking up speed again while he began directing my head again, uncertainly at first but as his lust graduated, so did the speed and roughness.
&emsp; &emsp;I loved the feeling of his fingers on my head, with him being the master, forcing me to do whatever he wanted. It felt strange to blow somebody off, but with Lerix, it was fine. I let go of him with one hand and went for my pants, but he grabbed it and shoved his own hand in them. His cold touch on my rock-hard, sore from unfulfilled need member caused it to almost explode with pleasure as he started jerking it. He stopped for a second, only to pull the blocking piece of clothing off me to be able to see it. I couldn’t look up to see his face but I could hear it, the satisfied humming, followed by response that was the same as mine, “Wow…”
&emsp; &emsp;Not that I really understood what was so fascinating about the round human dick compared to the piece of art I was sucking on, but I didn’t care right now. I began moaning, mouth full, and grabbed the very base of the Summoner’s cock tightly with my free hand and began massaging it, giving Lerix the full treatment.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;Suddenly he stopped thrusting his hand, stood up from the sitting position he was in before and grabbed my body, raised my lap to his face and rotated me around before mouthing my throbbing member, covering it in warm, sticky saliva and massaging it with his tongue, licking the more sensitive parts with his smooth centre and rubbing the more resilient ones with the stronger and bumpy sides of it. This felt so much better than his already amazing palm. I squeezed his buttocks tighter while he used both of his arms to hold me close to him (and to prevent me from falling). I was getting close and judging from the sounds from above me that were getting louder and more intense, so was he.
&emsp; &emsp;Lerix’s wings and legs gently wrapped themselves around my neck as he began humping my face, almost making me gag again. Meanwhile, the delicious tingling in my crotch grew stronger and stronger as the Summoner was rubbing against my dick with his long tongue that was wrapped around it and soon I couldn’t contain myself. I began moaning and groaning louder and louder and those sounds soon turned into animalistic growling before I roared, Lerix’s cock still deep in my mouth, as I came, waves of pleasure causing my body to tremble while I heard his loud, delighted moan as my cum filled his mouth.
&emsp; &emsp;A few seconds later, he came. A loud and high-pitched, yet beautiful shrieking filled my ears and tides of my lover’s semen came flowing into my mouth and throat and eventually stomach before the thick cum inevitably spurted out and down my face while his wings gripped tighter around my neck, choking me with his legs tightly holding my head between them. I tried to swallow as much of the thick seed as I could but there was too much of it and my throat was contracted, being pressured from the outside. It was this strange bitter taste again, but much stronger and with a strange mellow aftertaste that tasted fresh, both sour and sweet, with a lemony or orange-y aroma. Lerix’s entire body was shaking, including the wings and legs around my head, jolting it violently while his throbbing cock was constantly nudging the top of my mouth. I was in bliss, just me and my demon lover, in a never-ending euphoria. Just us, in this beautiful world.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;When the stream of semen and the trembling stopped and the pressure on my neck weakened, the Summoner slowly lowered himself back on the sofa. I sluggishly let his limp member slide out of my sore mouth and turned around after he did the same while the cum that previously moved up to my eyes now actually went down, back towards my mouth. I looked at Lerix and saw that he got his load, too, albeit somewhat smaller. He reached out with his long tongue and licked himself off before reaching to myself, hugging me tightly and kissing me, wrapping our tongues and mixing the last bits of our product together.&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;We split up and Lerix broke the silence, panting, “That was…”
&emsp; &emsp;I hugged him more tightly and kissed him on cheek and completed him, “…amazing.”
&emsp; &emsp;His smile widened. He was so beautiful, even with his ridges, absent eyes and the skin on his forehead stretched by an ancient artefact.&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;I looked at the clock. Damn, it was evening already? I was really tired and I wished nothing more than to stay here with Lerix who looked quite drained, as well. I only managed to mutter “good night” before falling asleep.
&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;The night was calm, with us laying in a warm embrace with a strange quiet humming coming from the Summoner that carried over to my body, gently vibrating it. When I woke up, Lerix was lying next to me, awake and floating a few centimetres above the sofa, looking at me with his head supported by his arm and a loving smile on his face.
&emsp; &emsp;I was sore but refreshed and after gaining enough consciousness, I greeted him before sharing a quick kiss. I got up and left for the bathroom. He didn’t need to, for some reason. He didn’t need to sweat if he didn’t want to and his teeth were always white and clean. After I was done I got out, half-dressed, and found Lerix already up, floating in the kitchen, leaning against the counter with his dress from yesterday. He was holding a cup of tea in his hands, naturally. Then, I noticed another cup on the table. I looked at the Summoner, who just nodded, “For you.”&emsp; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp;“Oh, I… Thank you.” Was all I managed to say before letting out a small giggle. I grabbed the mug filled with fresh tea and stood next to Lerix who wrapped one of his wings around my shoulders. After taking a sip of the smooth, yet strong tea, I realised it was Saturday. I looked at my demon lover who obviously knew that already because he looked at me with an entertained smirk on his face. I wrapped my arm around his back and took another sip. This was going to be a great day.
