####Chapter 1: The Agents

Agent Law shouldered through the security entrance of the NQA building in Nagoya, the pneumatic doors hissing open to grant him access. Agent Waver followed on his heels.

“Remind me again why we’re here?” Waver muttered. 

Law’s mouth twisted in a humorless smile. “You know how the Agency is. Tight-lipped as always. If I had to guess, it has something to do with the provisional license exams wrapping up today.”

Waver snorted, adjusting the wire-frame sunglasses perched on his nose. “Cleaning up after hero wannabes. Just how I wanted to spend my day off.”

“Could be worse. Better than getting shot at in some third-world hellhole.”

“Debatable.”

They strode down the gleaming corridor, boots ringing off polished floors. The walls were lit by recessed LED panels, bathing everything in crisp, clinical light. The facility practically reeked of money and state-of-the-art tech. Their credentials granted access to the observer halls overlooking the maze exam arena. Rows of monitors and control consoles lined the space. Technicians murmured into headsets, analyzing footage from the recently concluded trials.

At their entrance, a geeky-looking man lit up and bustled over. “Agents Law and Waver, I presume? A pleasure. I’m Hiroaki, one of the lead organizers here.”

Law shook the proffered hand. Hiroaki’s palm was soft and damp. “What seems to be the problem? Our orders were vague.”

“Yes, well.” Hiroaki licked his lips nervously. “We had a few odd incident during the trials. Very irregular. We thought it best to contact the pros. It might be nothing but better safe than sorry, am I right?” He chuckled to himself.

Waver leaned against the console, arms folded across his chest. “What kind of incident?”

“Here, I’ll just show you.” Hiroaki queued up some footage with a few rapid keystrokes. "20 of 24 students from Kyoto passed with a top rank score - even more than UA's esteemed program. And some displayed highly irregular abilities."

The video showed a blurry figure in ninja garb evading traps with ease. "This student, Nyoro, bypassed 90% of our obstacles, including level 8 grade hazards, succeeding solo, despite engaging a rival team and a pro hero."

Next the monitor displayed footage of a sword-wielding teen in futuristic samurai armor fighting alongside a girl whose hair is floating around her. “These two, according to our review, achieved over 200% quirk efficiency during their trial.”

“And lastly.” The monitor displayed the same draconic armored student alongside a teen in dark armor defeating a steel-body suit student marked as Envigor. "These two freshmen, Ryu-kishi and Mirror Devil, managed to defeat someone from your government sponsored program. Their final attack overloaded our sensors, it was beyond what they could read."

“So he’s dead then,” Waver cut him off, tone razor-edged. “An attack like that-.”

“N-no, not at all— you see as he was struck the energy turned upon itself and vanished. As if the construct refused to deal more than what’s necessary.”

“That is... noteworthy,” Agent Waver turned to look at the senior agent. “Well? Think the agency will make an issue of this?”

Agent Law watched the students celebrating on-screen. The boys' smiles were bright and genuine.

“No,” he finally said. “This is expected. Forcing compliance to arbitrary norms now would create more issues than it solves.”

Hiroaki adjusted his wiry eye-glasses, “I beg to differ sir but they could've been cheating. We should bring the students in. The whole class if possible. ”

“No. Tell your superiors the agency won’t interfere. However I’d strongly advise retooling your survey equipment. Quirks only get stronger with each generation. This one is no exception. Inflexibility helps no one.”

Hiroaki withered under the agents’ stares. “I...yes, of course. I do appreciate the feedback.”

Waver snorted. “Feedback. Right.” He clapped Hiroaki’s shoulder. “We’ll take all the data you have on this Class 1-D.”

Steam rose from the heaping bowls of ramen set before the two men. After the sterile chill of the NQA building, the cozy ramen joint was a welcome sight. Agent Law broke apart his chopsticks, keen to warm his gut with broth and noodles.

"So," Agent Waver began, blowing gently on a steaming spoonful. "That sponsored-student, Envigor. What do we know about him?"

Law grunted, mouth already full. He chewed meditatively before replying. "A valuable asset. His quirk, Conduit is one of a kind - makes him nearly unstoppable when boosted with the right quirks. We had a guy that could grant flight. Envigor held on to that effect for a month."

"Right. So how'd those students take him down?"

Law shook his head. "Unclear. Should've been impossible, given the enhancements he had."

"The data readings showed them resonating somehow. Synchronizing their Quirks."

"Mmph." Law took a swig of water to clear his throat. "A potent combo, but not enough to overpower Conduit. Unless..."

He frowned into his bowl. Envigor's Quirk had several layers of defense-boosting enhancements. And according to witnesses, the final blow had shattered the exam sensors bypassing even those. As if... 

"The other students, they were communicating with these two boys."

"Yes."

 "The boys could've harnessed the shared will of twenty students as a surge. Ever hear about quirk resonance? "

Waver raised a brow and chuckled. "Quirk resonance? That's good one. Next, you’ll be talking about quirk consciousness.  Or quirk singularity like some Humarise nut. Give me a break, Law. I'm not a rookie anymore."

Law silently shrugged. Waver was too new at the job to get it. He forced down a bite, appetite diminished. "How caught up are you on the last hundred years? Not the hogwashed history lessons they teach at primary."

"From the confidential files? I looked through them when I was on the first floor."

"Then you know about the Warlords and the hell we went through back then. Still gives me nightmares. That kind of crap makes you believe in things like quirk awakenings. What do you think happens if one of these Shiketsu kids goes on a killing spree? The girl who can't be detected - or this boy that can teleport."

"I dunno. We shoot em?"

"We don't have enough bullets for half of them. That's why we're lucky to have the hero system. Instead of one generation dealing with the next. We make them regulate each other as "heroes" and villains."

They ate in quiet for a minute before Waver went on, oblivious. "I guess but y'know. Envigor's not the only government-sponsored student in this case. The Shiketsu class has the Owari kid in it."

Law tensed, "Yeah. I met his handler once, on assignment. Cold bitch. Some of these 'assets' get a raw deal. This Owari boy's no exception. I'm surprised he's still croaking."

"Might be worth checking in on him and his handler."

“We do this one by the book. First, we observe the class. See what they do with their licenses."

“What about the ones who failed?”

“Give them another chance at it. They scored high enough for a remedial exam.” Law took a bracing sip of beer before continuing gruffly. "Whatever they did to pull it off, defeating Envigor was no small feat. Means they've got potential in spades. Power like that draws the wrong kind of attention."

"You think they're in danger?"

"Not yet. But down the line..." Law shook his head. "Let's just say, I'll rest easier after we evaluate the class directly."

"Right." Waver pushed aside his half-finished meal, appetite gone. "So what's the plan then? Wait and watch?"

Law nodded. "We intervene only if necessary. Subtly steer them if they stray and hope they don't stumble into trouble.”

####Chapter 2: NQC Medical Ward - Room C

The day after the intense Provisional License Exam, the atmosphere in the ward room containing Class 1-D was lively. Though the students bore plenty of bandages and casts from the rigors of the test, laughter and chatter filled the room. Inigo was up and about, energetically bounding down the hallway despite the bandages encasing his right arm. His dragon construct Gigan fluttered overhead, squeaking anxiously as it eyed Inigo's injuries.

"I'm fine buddy, don't worry!" Inigo reassured the fretful creature.  Out in the hallway, Inigo spotted the minotaur UA student, Buruburu, lumbering towards him.

"Yo, meathead!" Inigo called out with a grin. "You here to finish me off?"

Buruburu snorted, ambling over. "Heh. You're not worth the effort, Shit-ketsu. How's the arm?"

Inigo shrugged his good shoulder. "All good. Doc said I was lucky Envigor didn't shatter all my bones. Just a minor break."

"Crazy bastard. I still can't believe he was juicing himself with outside help like that."

"Yeah, no kidding," Inigo agreed soberly. "But I think his heart was in the right place, in a messed up way. He just got lost."

Buruburu nodded. "Yeah maybe. But we showed him, didn't we? Who knew a wimpy bug like you could put up a decent fight?"

Inigo laughed. "This bug helped save your furry behind!"

They shared a fist bump, grinning.

"So what's next for you?" Inigo asked. "Going out to celebrate?"

"Nah, my class is grabbing a shuttle to the station," Buruburu explained. "Figured I'd come say bye before we head out."

"It was great fighting with you, bro. You ever end up in Kyoto. Give me a ring."

"And if you're ever near Tokyo, come stop by UA," Buruburu grinned. He turned to leave, raising a hand in farewell. "Take care Ryu-kishi. I better see you at the top of the rankings someday."

"You know it!" Inigo called after him cheerfully. "Tell Bubblegum and Raijin I said bye! Good luck Minos!"

Inigo marked Buru off his mental list of people to say goodbye to. He had bonded with several students over the course of the provisional exam. Previously, Kinji from Isamu High had asked him to transfer to their school (not that he'd ever consider leaving Shiketsu) and Tsuga from Seijin High had timidly requested his phone number and herogram. As he watched the UA shuttle leave, Inigo walked off, feeling content and strangely nostalgic. Though they came from different schools, they all shared the same dream.
***
Inigo wandered down a lesser used corridor, Gigan hovering over him. Hearing familiar voices, he peered around a corner to see Yui, Nene and Orochi gathered next to a room, chatting with a nurse. Curious, Inigo headed over to investigate.

"Yo ladies, what's up! Did you three go through the exam together?" he asked cheerfully as the nurse walked inside the room.

"You bet we did! Should've seen some of the traps we went through," Yui grinned.

"Yep! And it's a good thing too. This is my second try and I had two lucky charms," Nene-senpai winked and patted Yui and Orochi.

Inigo laughed, but noticed Orochi looking uncharacteristically glum.

"Everything alright, Atsushi-san?"

"Orochi took out some students with her venom during the exam," Yui explained, eliciting a hiss from one of Orochi's tails. "We're checking to see if they're alright."

Inigo nodded sympathetically. With quirks flying every which way during the chaotic melee, accidental injuries were bound to happen.

"I'm sure they'll be fine," he said gently. "You were just defending yourself right?"

"That's what I told her," Nene chimed in supportively. "Could've happened to any of us."

Orochi scuffed a foot along the floor. "I know, but still."

A nurse exited the opposite room and approached them. They looked up hopefully.

"Well, I have good news," the nurse said kindly. "The affected students are recovering well. However, an antidote would speed their healing. I don't suppose I could get a sample of your toxin to analyze?"

Orochi brightened at the news. "Of course! I'll help any way I can."

The nurse smiled. "Excellent. Please stop by the lab at your convenience and we'll take care of it." She gave Orochi's arm an encouraging pat before heading off down the hall.

"Awesome!" Inigo said, flashing a thumbs up. Orochi  smiled, reassured that the students were recovering well. "By the way, doesn't that look a lot like you, Orochi." Inigo nodded towards a portrait against the hallway, it was of a pro hero with horns and silver hair lifting up what seems to be part of a bridge. Just under its lower frame was a shiny bronze plaque "The Goliath Wyrm". 

Nene smirked, "This entire wing was donated by the Atsushi family."

Orochi nodded as the four of them started walking down the hall. "Yeah that's my dad," she said shrugging.

Inigo whistled. "He must've been one strong dude."

Orochi seemed quieter as she stood in front of the large portrait of her father.  Inigo remembered that Orochi came from a legacy family just like he did. Except her family were pro heroes. She must've been chasing after them, the entire time that he was running away from his family's villain legacy.

"I don't have the same super strength that he had." 

Yui chimed in, "But you have other stuff, like these guys!" Orochi's tails stood tall and snapped at the air as if showing off.

"We'll probably have large portraits of our own one day," Inigo noted as they passed by. 

"Speaking of portraits! We heard you made a poster of Yui and I," Nene confronted Inigo teasingly. 

"Nah! What kinda weird rumor is that." Inigo tensed and changed the subject quickly. "OH hey! How bout' you girls tell me how your exam run went?"

Nene raised a hand, her tail raising up as she winked and placed an arm around Yui to the taller girl's surprise. "Oooh! I'll start! You know how everyone stampeded at the start? Well, Yui had a great idea-" 

"Skip that part! Ugh.. It was so dumb!" Yui said, hiding her face. 

"It was great," Orochi smirked. 

The four of them laughed and chatted all the way back to 1-D's ward room.

Upon entering the ward room again. Inigo grabbed two cups of watermelon ice cream from a nearby cooler and made his way over to the bed assigned to him.

"What's up! Did you get any sleep man?," he called out cheerfully to Christopher, who laid in the neighboring bed, reading a book. His friend sat propped up against his pillows, looking drained and slightly irrate.

"I tried but I  couldn't seem to settle down."

"Me neither. Here, I come bearing gifts! Don't worry, it's on the house.""

Inigo passed him one of the icy treats as he settled back onto his own mattress. Ever since the end of the exam, Chris had been acting odd and Inigo couldn't quite put his finger on it. Was he more angsty? 

Christopher accepted it with a nod of thanks, taking a bite of the cold dessert. "Thanks." 

"Feeling better?"

"A little. You?"

"Yeah, just a bit worn out. Nothing serious," Inigo jerked his thumb over as Christopher got another visitor - Faith had arrived. She stood by their beds looking at Chris. 

"Should I leave you two alone," Inigo added with a playful grin.

Faith colored slightly. "Oh! I should let you both rest." She quickly turned away. "Sorry. I'll come back later, Chris."

"Wait, you don't have to-" Christopher began awkwardly, but Faith had already hurried off.

Inigo chuckled at his flustered friend. "We've been cramming for this exam for weeks. She probably misses you."

Christopher sighed, shaking his head ruefully. "I suppose so." A trace of a smile crossed his face. "She did impressively well yesterday. I'm glad she didn't get hurt like we did."

Inigo leaned back and stretching his tired limbs. "Hey now. We got tossed around but we both kicked butt out there. That move we did in the end! That was nuts!"

"We won... somehow." Chris adjusted his glasses. 

"And we got our licenses! One step closer to going pro." Inigo's brows furrowed thoughtfully. "Speaking of the final boss, Envigor, you seen which room he's in? I wanted to check in on him."

Christopher shook his head. "I think they transported him to another facility."

"Well, I hope he's okay. And that he finds a better way forward. He did some bad shit, but everyone can change."

"Not everyone. Some people are just monsters. They deserve to be removed." 

Inigo watched Christopher rub the cast around his neck. It was only a few months ago, that Desolator had his fingers around the younger boy's neck, and about a month back, the same finger was on a trigger that was about to end Christopher's life. 

"You said the Five was in Nagoya somewhere, right?" Christopher spoke out. 

Inigo ached as he moved, but steadily he leaned towards Christopher's bed and headbutted him.

**Owww!** Both boys clutched their forehead in pain.

"What the hell? Why did you do that for?"

"Cuz none of us are in any condition to go after them. Not even Kaylee."

"I didn't say we were going after them."

"You were about to! Don't make me tell Faith!"

"You wouldn't."

Inigo smirked. "Besides, imagine how mad Sally would get if we went without her." He laughed.

Christopher shrugged. "We'll have to come back to Nagoya. Next time."

Inigo heard a ding on his phone. He looked at the screen and chuckled. "Hey check it out, bro. You remember Eri from the cafe?"

"She sent us a congratulations photo. She even drew us as heroes." In the photo was Eri holding a waterpainting drawing.

"That's nice," Christopher smiled. "Who's that behind her?"

"Oh..uh.." Inigo looked at his phone *'Mercury?'*

Their conversation was interrupted by cheers and chatter rippling through the room. All eyes turned to see two figures entering the room.

***

Rosethorn sat at her temporary desk within the NQC building. She was on the phone with her student, Sally McCathy. The exchange student had gone home early after failing the exam.

!!! note
	"Did you get home okay, McCathy-san?" 

	"Yes, you didn’t have to call, sensei. I’m fine on my own," came the disappointed voice over the phone.

	"I feel better knowing you're safe," Rosethorn said. "I sent you an email that might bring some good news. There's a remedial exam you could take, alongside Takara, Jugo, and Ashleigh. This way you won’t fall behind."

	"Oh. thanks," Sally muttered, unconvinced. "I dunno."

	"I understand it's easy to doubt yourself right now but I believe in you, Sally." Rosethorn paused for a moment. "Please take care."

	“You too, sensei.”

Rosethorn hung up the phone and leaned back in her chair. She was tired but overall satisfied. The majority of her hero students had passed the grueling licensed exam. Just a bit more paperwork and she could call it a day. There was a light knock on the door. Rosethorn looked up to see her student, Nyoro Hoge, standing there holding a stack of papers. The young girl bowed politely.

"I have the evaluation papers you wanted, sensei," Hoge said, stepping forward to place them on Rosethorn's desk.

Rosethorn smiled lightly at her diligent student. "Sasuga. You had all week to do this. Shouldn't you be resting and recovering with the others, Nyoro-san?"

"My injuries were not as severe. I decided to get my tasks done early," Hoge replied calmly, yet Rosethorn could hear the fatigue in the young girl's timid voice.

"I see. Now that you're done. I'll accompany you back. Please follow me to the infirmary," Rosethorn took the pages from Hoge and headed for the door. Rosethorn's heels clicked down the hallway of NQC Medical Wing, the fluorescent lights glinting off the polished floor. Hoge followed behind her, the girl's presence barely noticeable against the stark walls. Few words passed between them. 

She spared a glance at her reticent student, a swell of pride rising within her chest.  Hoge had once again exceeded expectations. Rosethorn had her doubts about the class representative at the start of the year but Hoge's drive was an ember that couldn't be smothered, and it carried through the entire class.

"You performed admirably," Rosethorn remarked. Hoge started slightly, as if unaccustomed to direct praise.

"I merely did what was needed," she demurred. 

Her face was stoic as always, but Rosethorn detected a hint of satisfaction in her student's voice. And she should be satisfied - according to the rankings, Hoge had claimed the number one spot among the first-year students in the practical exam. 

"I'm very proud of you. All your hard work has paid off."

"Thank you, sensei. I'm glad I didn't disappoint."

"Far from it," Rosethorn gave her shoulder a light, reassuring squeeze. Hoge flushed at the contact. "I hope you see this time as a chance to take a break, Nyoro-san.  The pressure to stay on top is stressful and I don't want you overdoing it."

Hoge nodded thoughtfully. "I understand.  I've already incorporated recreational periods at optimal times to prevent fatigue."

Rosethorn bit her lip. A tense feeling came over her. It wasn't too long ago that she had a similar talk with one of her star students. A familiar ache throbbed behind her eyes, a purple ghost from the past. Unbidden, the memory surfaced in Rosethorn's mind once more - the last time she'd seen her star pupil Siren, pale and drawn on a hospital bed. The vacant look in her eyes when Rosethorn promised she'd pull some strings with the administration, get Siren time off to rest and recover.
And Siren's hoarse whisper in response - ("It's okay, Sensei. I'll be fine soon. Can't fall behind.") The heart monitor's steady beep as Siren's eyes slipped closed in exhaustion. 

*No. Never again.*

"Sensei, is everything alright?"

"I'm fine. I just recalled some unpleasant memories."

Hoge stayed silence. Watching the teacher she had come to deeply respect. 

"Back when I first started teaching I wasn't always the best role model. There was this group of girls-"

"Do you mean the Undersea Rangers?"

Rosethorn blinked. "Yes, that's what they call themselves now."

"I met them at the aquarium. They seemed familiar with you."

"They used to be a group of four." Rosethorn's expression turned grim. "You likely noticed their...difficult personalities. Back then they were - different. Siren, their fourth member, especially was very talented and kind-hearted, though fragile. She was a rising star and tried too early to reach the top."

She sighed heavily. "On her rookie year, Siren ended up hospitalized. Despite my promises for leniency, I ended up pushing her too far. She felt pressured to do hero work. And in her weakened state..." Rosethorn trailed off. Even now the memories pained her. "There was an incident with the villain, Greenfinger. Siren was gravely injured."

Hoge's eyes widened behind her glasses. "That's terrible. I'm sorry."

"She had to withdraw from the program and her team blamed me for the incident. They cut ties with my agency and debuted as their own team. I had reached out to her after but... the Siren I knew was gone." Rosethorn met Hoge's gaze. "So please, learn from my past failure. No ambition is worth destroying yourself." 

 "You've given me much to reflect on." Hoge nodded, taking in Rosethorn's lesson as she watched the teacher open the door to the Ward Room. Their homeroom teacher had long held the title of #10 in the rankings. Was this the reason why she guarded the gate to the top 10? To keep unprepared heroes from reaching perilous heights? How cut throat was the top rankings?

They were met by cheers as the door opened. The Ward Room was lively with the injured yet energetic students of class 1-D. They had stayed the night after the exams, half of them were in a state of preparing to leave.

The boisterous chatter of Class 1-D filled the common room as the students gathered around Rosethorn as she displayed the exam results and handed each of them their laminated provisional exam license.

"No way, Hoge got the top score?!" Inigo exclaimed.

The stoic girl adjusted her glasses, a faint blush on her cheeks. "It was nothing, really."

"Nothing? Girl, you totally crushed it!" Orochi cheered.

"Nice job Class Rep!" Hiro shook his head in awe.

"And defeating a whole team single-handedly? Bad ass!" added Bobby.

Hoge ducked her head, embarrassed by the attention. "I merely did what was needed..."

"Don't sell yourself short, you definitely earned the #1 spot," Inigo said sincerely. Hoge managed a small smile.

"Only a few points away from us," Hailey scoffed from her #2 ranking, tied with Hifumi.

"Oooh, shots fired!" Hifumi laughed. "But nice job snagging #1, cousin!"

He high-fived Hailey, who despite her prickly exterior had a proud gleam in her eyes.

"Man, 7th place? I totally got robbed," complained Bobby.

Edith smirked from her 11th place spot. "Perhaps you'd have ranked higher if you spent less time brawling and more time focusing."

"Oh c'mon, where's the fun in that?" Bobby retorted. The class chuckled at her indignance.

"You both did fantastic, Noah is sure," Noah encouraged kindly. "Right, Inigo?"

All eyes turned to the blonde boy, who was staring at the screen in dismay.

"...16th place? Seriously?"

Kaylee gave a booming laugh and slapped him on the back. "That's what happens when you spend the whole time making friends instead of grabbing a key!"

"Yeah, but...16th?" Inigo sulked. "That's so lame..."

"Don't worry man. You helped a ton of students pass, that's what matters," said Christopher, humbly not bringing up his own score of 5th place.

"We couldn't have done it without you," added Chihiro with an emphatic nod.

Inigo brightened a bit at his classmates' encouragement. "Heh, yeah...I guess kicking butt and taking names isn't everything." His grin returned in full force. "I'm glad we all crushed it together! How bout' we party after this?"

"Oh yeah. We can fire up our new grill!" Bobby yelled.

"I'm not sure she's ready for that," Hifumi said with concern.

"Party at Mitsurugi-sans when we get back to Kyoto!" Inigo called out. "For all the top rankers!"

A chorus of cheers met his statement. Leave it to Inigo to be pumped about their shared success.

As the lively chatter continued, Hoge slipped quietly out of the room. Inigo noticed, excused himself from the company, and went after her.

He found the quiet girl sitting alone on bench in one of the empty wings, staring thoughtfully into space.

"Hey," he said gently, taking a seat beside her. "You okay? You left pretty quick."

Hoge started, then nodded slightly. "Yes, I needed time to think. You don't have to keep me company. I'm not in distress."

Inigo bumped her shoulder playfully. "Is this about the Sally thing? You can talk to me, y'know."

"I know."

He could tell from her body language and slight blur that this wasn't excited-for-being-#1 Maru. This was I'm-worried-about-something-but-I'm-not-gonna-tell-you Maru. Inigo sat down next to her.

"It's a lil too loud in the room already. Adding my big mouth on top of that is just gonna get us in trouble," He winked trying to get her to smile. "I'll  stay with you until you tell me to go away."

"Okay."

They sat together in silence for a long while, staring out the window overlooking the quiet garden on the NQC grounds as morning rain fell softly. At some point, he found her head leaning against his shoulder. Inigo thought back - all the battles and the exam - was probably worth it just for this very moment. If only he could find a way to cheer her up.

It was a bright sunny day as Inigo walked down the streets of Nagoya besides Hoge. In front of them walked Hifumi and Hailey. The four teens found themselves scheduled for the last shuttle to the station and had an hour to kill before heading home to Kyoto.

"Let's grab some street food!" Inigo yelled. "I'm tired of being cooped. By the way, did you guys notice how the NQC entrance looks like a giant pair o-"
"-Dango!" Hifumi pointed out a colorful stall before walking towards it. "They have the special zunda and kurogoma dangos here."
"Sweet! Bro, I'm starving!"

 "Boys," Hailey rolled her eyes and turned to Hoge. "Let's go shopping. I saw a trendy store over there."
Hoge turned to Hailey and held up a black camera covered in Maru stickers, "Actually, I want to take a picture of the Nagoya Castle. I've never seen it before. As you know, Nagoya developed as a castle town centered around the impressive structure, constructed in 1612. It was originally called the Yanagi-no-maru and was later renamed-"

"Uhuh," Hailey cut her off and seized the girl's arm, hooking it with her own. "You can take a picture of the old dumb building later. Time for some girl time."
"If it's along the way. I supposed-"
"Great! You're with me then! So long boys!"

Hifumi and Inigo were busy surrounding the dango street vendor named Shin Suzume Honten. They both turned with their mouths full.
"Hmmf? Wheremm myou goimf?" Hifumi asked. The two boys looked at each other and shrugged, returning to the food.
"Mhff! I wanmmt that one," Inigo pointed out to the bewildered stall owner.
***
***
"EEEEK!"
The frightened employee jumped as she noticed Hoge was still in the dressing stall she was attempting to clean.
"Sumimasen. I'm still using this stall," Hoge's disembodied voice said.
The flustered employee bowed and quickly left.
"Okay, so that's the second time that's happened," Hailey pointed out as she peeked out the opposite dressing stall revealing a red swimsuit.
"I'm used to it. People don't notice me."
"Take control of your weird quirk or we're gonna get thrown out, Nyoro."
"Must we try out clothes together and show each other what we're buying?" 
"Of course. We're gonna come out hot, and I don't want us to match, duh. And if we do somehow you'll be the one to change not me."

 "I'm having second thoughts about this- Ch-chang-san. What are you doing?"
Hailey had stepped out of the dressing stall and towards the store's mirror. "What? The lighting sucks in there."
"Oh my. You're really wearing a thong? No way. You can't wear that." Hoge shook her head and turned away, embarrassed.
"Relax, there's like no one here. I'm checking to see if I could pull it off. I know we're in Japan, not Seoul."
"We should still be careful. We're representing Shiketsu outside Kyoto after all."

"Yeah, whatever. OH! This would look so cute on you!" Hailey held up a slinky black mini dress with her telekinesis, eyeing Hoge appraisingly. "Show off those curves that baggy uniform hides."
Hoge shrank away. "It's too revealing..."
Hailey scoffed, levitating the dress to their pile anyway. "Don't be such a nun! You dress like a steel pipe. So what, you don't want to dress girly around people, but you'd dress like an idiot in public?"
"I can try it on.."
"Good. Might as well work it so the boys remember what they've got at home." She winked exaggeratedly.

At the mention of her sort-of boyfriend, Hoge flushed, fiddling anxiously with her uniform's cuff. Her ill-advised relationship isn't exactly a secret to a good amount of their classmates. Hailey would be familiar with the school's dating ban, especially with the way she openly defied it during the school tournament.
"Th-there's no need for that," Hoge mumbled self-consciously. "Our partnership meets satisfactory parameters..."
"Uh huh, I'll bet." Hailey continued matter-of-factly. "You do realize when we're pro-heroes, they'll have swarms of groupies batting their lashes?"
She sidled up behind Hoge, holding a dress up to her chest. "So unless you step up your fashion game, Don Juan might start window shopping."
The notion made Hoge anxious. 
"Y-you really think he'll attract that level of attention...?"
"Oh honey." Hailey patted her back almost gently. "Between that pretty face, flirty attitude and flashy rescues? They'll eat him up."
Hoge worried her bottom lip. She hadn't considered consequences of increased visibility...least of all romantic rivals. Perhaps she could implement preventative countermeasures... Her thoughts raced ahead strategizing Inigo-retention initiatives before Hailey's confident voice interrupted.
"HELLO? Stop overthinking!" She clapped sharply in Hoge's face. "I'm telling you, just vamp up the allure so his eyes don't wander!"
"R-right, of course..." Hoge refocused, anxiety rising. Seduction fell decidedly outside her skill set...
Hailey eyed her knowingly. "Stick with me. By the time I'm through, heads will turn when you walk by." Hoge highly doubted such an outcome but found herself reluctantly considering Hailey's advice.

As Hailey busily rifled through more clothes, Hoge wandered over to the boutique's 'Empowering Women’ display, scrutinizing the assorted merchandise depicting popular heroines.
She adjusted her glasses. "Statistically only four female heroes currently rank within the top twenty charts. Gender disparity remains distressingly predominant across all hero industries."
"There's a shortage of iconic heroines to look up to..." Hailey made a face. "No wonder all the celebrity power couples splashed across tabloids  just treat them like aesthetic arm candy. It's hard feeling like you gotta downplay your looks to be taken seriously sometimes. Not that plain Jane brainiacs can relate."
Hoge studied her silently for a long moment.
"All the more reason we as the next generation must excel and set new standards." Hoge replied evenly.
Hailey huffed with an amused smile. "Heh, look who's talking Miss First-Place. Keep making goo goo eyes at Inigo and the boys will leave us both in the dust."
Hoge instantly flushed crimson again. "I do not make goo goo eyes." she sputtered indignantly.
"Uh huh. Just don't let boy crazy distractions cost you your rank. If you do fall, I'm gonna nab that #1 spot!"
Hoge stiffened, haughtiness returning. "You're welcome to try. But I have no intention of relinquishing first place. And Chang-san, if you're trying to start a rivalry type relationship with me know that you'll be competing with Cain-san."
"Ooh, throwing down a challenge?" Hailey smirked. "Just remember you're stuck with #16 slacker boy. While Hifumi and I worked together dominate the charts."
"Perhaps in rank," Hoge allowed diplomatically. "But as the exam demonstrated, well-strategized skill often supersedes brute force. And when scores are combined, our score at rank 1 and 16 still exceeds your own at rank 2 and 3."
Satisfied with her irrefutable logic, Hoge calmly gathered up their shopping and headed for the checkout counter. Behind her, Hailey gaped indignantly for several seconds before snapping her jaw shut. Hoge turned and shot her a smile.
"...I freaking hate that she's right," Hailey grumbled under her breath. But a reluctantly smile tugged at her lips as she trailed after the surprisingly smug class president.
***
Inigo and Hifumi walked happily through the streets of Nagoya, eating sticks of colorful dango. Inigo's little green dragon construct, Gigan, floated above them, nibbling on a single pink sakura dango.

"Mmm...the girls don't know what they're missing," Inigo said through a mouthful. "These are the best!"

"Seriously," Hifumi agreed, popping another dango into his mouth. "Where'd the girls run off to anyway?"

"No clue. They just took off." His eyes lit up as they passed a large billboard display showing the latest hero rankings. "Oh check it out! Looks like Ryukyu moved up to #8 and Wash is still #1 in popularity, just in front of Saurus."
***
-> ![Let's aim for the top!](https://i.imgur.com/VBZqHZt.jpg) <-
***
He grinned up at the billboard. "We got lots of competition when we finally make it up there bro."

But Hifumi was quiet, staring thoughtfully ahead as he chewed. Inigo glanced at his friend in surprise. Hifumi was usually fired up whenever they talked hero rankings.

"You alright, man?" Inigo asked. "Now's the time you're usually like-" He struck a dramatic pose, puffing out his chest and imitating Hifumi's voice. "I'm gonna be #1! I won't let anyone get in my way, just you watch me! I'll be the strongest hero ever!"

Gigan squeaked in amusement as Inigo flexed arrogantly before wincing in pain and grabbing his injured arm with a hiss. "Oww..."

Hifumi cracked a smile at his antics. "Dumbass. I'm not in the mood after what we went through in the exam."

"Oh yeah..." Inigo nodded sympathetically. "You worried about Hailey or something?"

"It's not just her." Hifumi shook his head, looking uncharacteristically uncertain. "I almost failed back there, man. When Magnum Shrimp had me on the ropes...I kinda lost it. I almost gave up."

Inigo nudged his friend supportively with his good arm. "But you didn't give up. You kept on fighting."

"Yeah, well...what if I don't make it next time?" Hifumi muttered, shoving his hands moodily in his pockets. "Maybe I just got lucky."

Inigo hurried to catch up as Hifumi stalked off down the street, Gigan fluttering after them. This wasn't like his usually cocky friend at all.

"Whoa whoa, hold up!" Inigo said seriously. "You can't start doubting yourself now, bro!"

As the two boys continued along the row of shops, the clattering of wood interrupted their conversation. Just up ahead, an elderly man was struggling to push a tall wooden cart piled high with merchandise up a steep hill. With a loud snap, one of the cart's wheels broke off completely. The old man tried to run as the heavy cart began careening uncontrollably backwards down the hill, directly into the bustling pedestrian traffic.

A woman nearby screamed, frantically pointing as the runaway cart rapidly picked up speed on its descent, barrels and boxes spilling across the road.
Inigo and Hifumi whipped around at the scream, instantly spotting the runaway cart barrelling down the hill. Shoppers scrambled to run away, pushing and running into each other in the confusion.

"Crap, that thing's gonna flatten someone!" Hifumi exclaimed. Inigo and Hifumi exchanged one fleeting look before dashing into action. Inigo sprinted forward, emerald wings bursting from his back. "On it! Grab the old guy!"

Hifumi teleported to the old man's side, catching him before he stumbled, grabbing his arm to teleport him safely out of the cart's path.

Trusting his friend to secure the elder, Inigo launched skyward to stop the runaway cart. With a grunt of effort, he rotated midair and dove in front of the juggernaut, bracing his arms. His armor formed just before impact.

BKKMMMM!

Inigo body checked the massive cart, heels carving furrows in the pavement. But he only slowed its advance, dense wood grinding against metal greaves.

Inigo dug his heels in, muscles straining painfully through his injuries as he gripped the cart tightly. But it was extremely heavy, loaded down with stock. His shoes slid inexorably forward on the steep slope as the cart continued its uncontrolled roll.

"Hifumi!" Inigo yelled over his shoulder. "Little help here?"

"Ngh...! Weighs...a ton...!" Inigo growled through gritted teeth, armor plates buckling. In rapid flashes of light, Hifumi began teleporting pedestrians and bystanders out of the runaway cart's chaotic path. Freed from worrying about casualties, Inigo poured all his strength into stopping the wooden deathtrap, yelling with effort. 

"Crap...!" Just behind him a little boy stood frozen as death barrelled towards him.

Inigo snarled and pushed his quirk, emerald energy wreathing his straining form.

"GIGAAAN!"

His armor erupted outwards, expanding rapidly into a verdant behemoth twenty feet tall. Spectators gaped as Inigo's towering draconic construct caught the runaway vehicle against its chest with an earth-shaking crunch of splintering wood. Inigo had halted its momentum just shy of flattening the paralyzed child. With a relieved sigh, Inigo dismissed Gigan and it dissolved into glittering motes. He pulled the cart with him to check on the elderly man as citizens emerged from hiding to clap and praise their deed.

Panting, Inigo sagged against the heavily laden cart in exhausted relief. The danger was past. He glanced back to see Hifumi helping the visibly shaken old man to his feet nearby.

"Thank you both, young sirs!" the elderly man exclaimed, hobbling over to examine the damaged wheel alongside Inigo and Hifumi. "If not for your quick actions, someone could have been badly hurt."

"No problem, Ojii-san," Inigo assured him sincerely. "But it looks like you busted a wheel pretty bad here."

The three of them managed to lift the heavy cart and wheel it carefully back up the hill. Hifumi teleported away to retrieve the spilled merchandise as Inigo helped the old man remove the ruined wheel.

"Please, let me help you get this fixed up," Inigo offered. But the elderly shopkeeper just smiled and waved off his concern.

"No need, no need! It's quite alright," he said kindly. "My boy usually helps me with these deliveries. But since it's just me today, I overloaded the cart. Serves me right for getting too ambitious in my old age." He chuckled ruefully, shaking his head. As Hifumi reappeared with the last of the spilled boxes, the old man turned to them gratefully.

“This here’s my pride and joy. I've run this curio shop for fifteen years now,” He led them to a small, old-fashioned wooden stall crammed with all sorts of curiosities and antique goods. Intrigued, Inigo and Hifumi made their way over.

"Woah, check this out!" Inigo said in awe, picking up a strange contraption of brass tubes and gears. "What is it?"

"Ah, that’s one of the first music boxes created in Japan," the old man explained proudly. "Wind it up and it’ll play an old love song."

Inigo did so, laughing in delight as tiny music began plinking out softly from the intricate mechanism. He showed it eagerly to Gigan, who sniffed it curiously before trying to bat at the turning cylinder.

The boys’ attention was drawn to a weathered wooden rack filled with aging postcards, their once vibrant images faded after decades of existence. Glancing over them, they realized they were old letters written by soldiers and sailors long ago to their loved ones back home.

"Go ahead and take one if you like, sonny," he encouraged. "Those old letters deserve to be appreciated by new eyes." Inigo's ears perked up eagerly at this. "Really, Ojii-san? We can each pick one for free?" "Of course!" The old man beamed. "Consider it thanks for your help earlier."

Eagerly Inigo snatched up an old letter describing exciting tales of adventure on the high seas. Hifumi picked out a meaningful card from a hopeful soldier writing home to his sweetheart. Hifumi's eyes misted slightly reading the postcard from the soldier written after 10 long years at war, hoping against hope that he'd somehow make it back alive to his wife. The emotion in his words was well-preserved in the old ink. Hifumi gently replaced the letter, lost in contemplative thought.

Noticing his interest, the shopkeeper hobbled over.

Hifumi held up the soldier's card anxiously. "I wonder if this guy ever made it back home..."

The shopkeeper went rummaging around the back of his booth for a moment before emerging with another aged postcard. He handed it to Hifumi with a knowing twinkle in his eye.

-> ![Memories frozen in time.](https://i.imgur.com/tOUG5lO.png) <-

Hifumi accepted it curiously - and chuckled. It was a later letter from the same soldier featured in his card, describing his homecoming and joyous reunion with his wife after 12 long years at war overseas.

"He made it back!" Hifumi said thickly, deeply moved. "He never gave up hope!"

Inigo clasped his friend's shoulder, equally affected.

"I can feel his strength from here bro," Inigo said earnestly. "We gotta have the same faith."

Hifumi took a deep breath as he nodded firmly. "You're right. Doubt or not doubt. We're going all the way to the top," He declared vehemently, eyes blazing. "I won't stop till I'm #1!"

The shopkeeper chuckled at their youthful determination. "You lads remind me of my boy when he was your age," he remarked fondly. Noticing their school uniforms for the first time, his bushy brows shot up in surprise. "You attend one of those hero academies then?"

Inigo grinned and struck a pose. "Yup! I'm Ryukishi, the dragon hero! And I'm going to save six million people one day!"

Hifumi crossed his arms imposingly. "And I'm Challenger! I'm shooting for #1!"

At their dramatic introductions, the old man clapped excitedly.

"Bless me, real heroes! Here," he added eagerly. "Would you sign an autograph? Who knows, you may be famous some day!"

Laughing, the two happily obliged, signing their hero names with a flourish on the man's offered notepad. They learned his name was Kanushi as they bid their new fan farewell. As Inigo and Hifumi walked off, the shopkeeper waved merrily after them.

"Good luck, you two! I'll be cheering for Ryukishi and Challenger!"

"Hey Oji-san, how much for these hats?"
***
***
Both boys sported black hats and dramatic trench coats as makeshift "disguises" though their uniforms still showed underneath.
Inigo peeked around a rack of discount blouses, green eyes narrowed in concentration. "Target spotted. I repeat, eyes on target."
Beside him, Hifumi nodded seriously, holding up his phone like a speaker. "Roger that."
"What're they doing?"
Hifumi shrugged. "I don't know - you think they're talking about us?"
"You mean, embarrassing things we don't even tell each other?"
"Yeah.."
"Hoge would never."
"Hay would, and she'll talk Nyoro into it."
"Okay, we gotta stop them! I can't have Hoge blabbling about my-"
Gigan fluttered onto Inigo's shoulder, squeaking something urgently. Inigo gasped. "What's that buddy? The girls went into Racy & Lacey?!"
Hifumi choked. "Th-the lingerie store?!"
"We gotta get closer!" Inigo declared, grabbing Hifumi's arm to tug him along stealthily. "This is a crucial undercover op!"
Keeping low, they snuck up to the risque shop's display window, peeking over the racy mannequins inside. Sure enough, Hailey and Hoge stood surveying a table of frilly unmentionables.
Hifumi sweated nervously. "M-maybe this is a bad idea...Spying on them trying underwear..."
But Inigo shushed him urgently. "We're not actually gonna do that, but just in case - you only look at Hailey and I'll keep an eye on Hoge."
***
"Heads up Nyoro, our boy toys are stalking us." Hailey mock-whispered out the side of her mouth.
Hoge glanced over to where Inigo and Hifumi lurked behind a rack of dresses. Their bright hair and shoes poorly concealed by oversized coats and hats. She stifled an amused snort.
"They're too obvious."
Hailey smirked, eyes glinting. "Wanna have some fun with them?" At Hoge's uncertain look, she grabbed her wrist, playfully towing her along into a nearby shelf.
"C'mon, it'll teach them not to snoop on girl time! Just follow my lead..."
Soon both couples stood browsing the risque lingerie section - the boys poorly hidden behind a floor plant while the girls pretended not to notice.
Hailey raised her voice excitedly. "Oooh Hoge, check out this sexy corset! Cream lace is sooo your color."
She watched Inigo visibly sweat from the corner of her eye. Hifumi was steadily turning fuscia.
Hoge caught on, lifting a racy negligee. "My, how daring! Statistically male attention escalates in correlation to skimpy attire..."
Hailey smiled as the quiet girl played along. Time to kick it up a notch. Snickering inwardly, Hailey steered them toward the changing rooms. "I'll give you a crash course." She whispered the plan to Hoge who blinked owlishly.
Soon Hailey yelled out dramatically from inside their curtained cubicle. "EEK! Nyoro-chan, you look so naughty in that one!" For added effect, she flung a bra out the stall.
"You believe so? I confess lacking data on ideal erogenous lingerie..." Hoge turned scarlet but managed to maintain a neutral tone.
"If you're looking! Guys totally eat up crotchless panties and peek-a-boo bras." She smirked at the muffled choking sounds behind her. "Ooh try these! These drive guys wild!" She dangled a minuscule lace thong out of the stall. 
***
Inigo and Hifumi sprinted out of the store, their eyes glazed over as they pressed their backs against a wall.
"Okay, we definitely shouldn't have been there!! What the hell are peek-a-boo bras, bro?" Inigo stammered as he loosened his tie.
"How the hell should I know. Why were they screaming? Were they slapping each other?!" 
"I don't know! The VNs didn't prepare me for this," the blonde boy shook his head. "We have a lot of research to do." he turned to Gigan who just sighed in dismay.
"This was your dumb idea."
"Hey you were the one who wanted to get these detective coats!"
"Bro, that was my cousin in there," Hifumi replied.
"It's still weird that you're Hoge's cousin now," Inigo pointed out, before peeking around the corner. "You think they're really buying anything?"
"We'll know if they come back with bags."
***
Hailey and Hoge smiled conspiratorially as they met up with the boys. They had burst out laughing as soon as they saw Inigo and Hifumi's faces. 

The two boys played it off, but they had a feeling something was going on. They weren't about to admit openly that they were stalking their girlfriends however.

The mood lightened up as soon as they were on their way to Nagoya Castle. "Get this - there was this runaway cart that almost plowed down pedestrians..." Inigo regaled the girls with the tale of their rescue, Hifumi looked fondly at his animated friend. 


-> ![It's even better during cherry blossom season at the beginning of April.](https://i.imgur.com/7o5Em2j.png) <-

Soon the foursome were looking at Nagoya Castle, laden with shopping bags. Hoge kept pausing to snap photos of anything that caught her interest despite Hailey's grumbling.

The majestic Nagoya Castle towered before them, sunlight glinting off curved green rooftops. Groups of tourists milled about the sprawling compound, admiring blooming foliage and snapping photos.

Hoge's eyes shone behind her glasses. "Simply magnificent...this 1612 architectural wonder synthesizes stylistic elements from multiple eras." Lifting her camera, she circled eagerly like a documentarian amongst artifacts.

Inigo trailed behind her, hands laced behind his head. "Yeah, pretty cool! Think of all the battles they must've had here. They say Oda Nobunaga might've been born here."

"It was extensively restored after destruction in World War II," Hoge lectured, peering through her lens. "Nagoya developed as a castle town so this fortress formed the heart of-"

"She's seriously just gonna nerd out over some old building," Hailey interrupted.

Hifumi chuckled good-naturedly. "I mean, it is a nice spot for some pics."

Soon they were surveying scenic backdrops. Inigo intercepted Hoge as she lined up a shot of the ornate gold leaf walls.

"Here, I can take one of you first if you want," he offered with an engaging smile. Hoge nodded and relinquished her camera. 

She posed demurely by a flowering tree as Inigo playfully directed her. "Gorgeous! Now gimme sassy. Perfect!" Checking his shots, he leaned in with a soft murmur. "How're you feeling by the way? After everything yesterday... and this morning."

Hoge lowered her eyes. "I'm adequately recovered, thank you." At his searching look, she admitted quietly, "I'm relieved it's over. And that we succeeded despite...shortcomings."

Inigo bumped her shoulder affectionately. "You were amazing. Never doubt that."

Hoge smiled, warmed by his steadfast confidence in her. They stood together by the flowering tree, gazing up at the castle.

Meanwhile, Hailey presented Hifumi with a small wrapped gift. "Got this for you back there, Babo. Just a little something to commemorate our license victory."

"Hey, you shouldn't have..." Hifumi carefully opened the package to reveal a sleek rabbit-design exercise headband.

"Wow, this is really nice!" He turned it over, admiring the design. "Is this from that trendy boutique?"

Hailey smirked, pleased he liked it. "I had to make sure my partner looks the part."

She helped him fasten it on his head. Hifumi clasped her hand, brushing a tender kiss over her knuckles. "Have I mentioned you're the best?"

Hailey winked coyly even as her cheeks heated. "Might bear repeating."

Soon the four friends were posing by the castle's sprawling gate, flags fluttering brightly against vivid azure skies. As tourists ebbed around them, Inigo called out eagerly.

"Gigan, heads up!"

His little winged dragon construct snatched up Hoge's camera, toting it skyward.

Inigo lined them up before racing over. "Okay ready...three, two, one, smile!"

***
***
As they made their way back from Nagoya Castle. Hoge's curious nature brought the gang to a halt. 

"Hey, isn't that Seiryu over there?" Hoge whispered, nudging Inigo discreetly. She pointed across the bustling shopping plaza to an outdoor cafe where the familiar dragon pro hero sat conversing with a red-headed woman.
Inigo's eyes widened in recognition. "Oh wow, it's him alright! And that's gotta be Honoken!"

Hailey smiled. "What's their deal? Are they together?"

Inigo nodded. "Kinda looks like it right? I ran into Seiryu during the trials yesterday."


Sure enough, Kalianne was leaning eagerly across the table, gesticulating wildly about something while Seiryu listened with his usual far-off expression.

"What're a couple of underground heroes doing out on a date?" Hailey wondered aloud.

Hifumi raised an eyebrow. "Who says it's a date?" Though the cozy ambience did suggest a certain intimacy...

Inigo was already sneaking closer, motioning for the others to follow stealthily. "C'mooon, aren't you curious what they're talking about?"

Soon the four teens were crouched behind a convenient decoration partition, blatantly eavesdropping on the pro table.

"...and I'm telling ya, that bull kid nearly gored me twice!" Kalianne complained loudly. "How the heck did we get roped into being obstacle course fodder for baby heroes anyway?"

"Hn. When the exam administrators requested experienced heroes as obstacles. I couldn't resist volunteering," Seiryu replied simply, taking a sip of tea.

Kalianne threw her hands up in exasperation. "You just had to show off huh? They had me launch fire straight into traffic! Nearly torched a dozen screaming kids!" She thunked her head on the table with a groan as Seiryu sympathetically patted her shoulder.

"If it makes you feel any better, a group of senior girls thought they could seduce me into letting them pass..." Seiryu offered tonelessly.

Kalianne's head shot back up, a wicked grin spreading across her face. "Oh really~? What kinda freaky pick-up lines we talking here?" She propped her chin eagerly as Seiryu averted his gaze.

"The less said about that incident the better..."

Behind their screen, the teens muffled their laughter. Inigo pretend-swooned against Hifumi. "Such hardships..."

Hailey mimed gagging. "Guess even underground pros have to deal with desperate fan."

"Shh, I wanna hear more!" Inigo hissed. They refocused on the hero table.

"...still say they could've warned us properly," Kalianne grumbled, poking petulantly at her pastry. "I signed up to showcase my new technique, not work crowd control!"

Seiryu hummed pragmatically. "They wanted authentic reactions... though the stampede at the start was problematic."

"No kidding!" Kalianne threw her arms wide, nearly swiping a waiter. "I got crushed under a pile-up thanks to a rock guy barreling through! My ribs still ache..." She rubbed her side ruefully.

"Hn. Apologies." Seiryu inclined his head. "I should have reacted sooner to prevent that."

"Eh, guess we both had a rough time. Impakt must've had it bad. He was in a foul mood," Kalianne snickered, eyeing Seiryu slyly. "I wonder if those senior girls know about the body pillow merchandise.."

Seiryu nearly choked on his tea as Kalianne laughed unrepentantly. The students exchanged confused glances.

"Uhh context?" Hailey muttered.

Inigo looked similarly lost. "The heck are they talking about?"

Hoge just shook her head bemusedly. "It's likely an inside joke..."

Seiryu had regained composure, coughing into his fist. "Yes, well...regardless, Our participation highlighted areas needing improvement. With luck, this year's candidates will have learned valuable lessons about real-world hero work."

Kalianne cocked her head dubiously. "You really think those sugar-hyped kids absorbed anything with all hell breaking loose and all the violence?"

"Not right away. But upon reflection... They could gain insight that proves useful in the future." He sipped his tea meditatively. "Much as we once did under Karaburan-sensei's ruthless training."

Kalianne pulled a face at the mention of their former instructor. "Ugh, don't remind me! Still have nightmares about those 'search and rescue' simulations..." She gulped her coffee. She leaned back, lacing her fingers behind her head. "Welp, guess it wasn't a total bust in the end! We got fancy catering and a fun story. Now c'mon, lunch break's over. We got a train to catch unless you want to fly us home!"

She sprang up eagerly, pausing when Seiryu didn't immediately follow. "Uh, you awake in there?"

"Hm? Sorry, I was thinking about something..." Seiryu rose unhurriedly, leaving a generous tip.

"Ooooh. I get it, you wanted to see if Yoshizumi would show up for the UA students!"

"No, that's not it! What gave you that idea-"

"-didn't you meet her here?"

The two pros sauntered away chatting lively, leaving behind a tableful of covert eavesdroppers.

"They're so cool," Hifumi said.

Inigo gushed back, starry-eyed. "Sidekick goals for real!"

Hailey rolled her eyes. "That tea was lukewarm at best. Not worth spying over."

Hoge held up a finger. "The tea they were drinking looked hot to me."

-> ![Say Ahh.](https://i.imgur.com/ZUz5jJE.jpg) <-
Before leaving Nagoya, the four decided to take a break at a dessert shop at the corner of the shopping center.

Inigo dove into his massive chocolate sundae, savoring the rush of sugar and cream. Across from him, Hifumi was similarly occupied demolishing his own giant dessert.

The two boys were so focused on their treats they hardly noticed as Hailey sidled closer to Hifumi, deep brown eyes dancing.

"Here Babo, try some of mine," she purred, holding out a spoonful of ice cream.

Hifumi blinked, mouth full. "Hngh?"

Hailey seized the chance to slip the spoon between his lips. "Good right? I'll feed you the rest."

Hifumi didn't protest as Hailey hand-fed him, giggling. The couple was lost in their own little world.

Oblivious, Inigo shoveled in another huge bite - until movement caught his eye. To his surprise, Hoge was shifting nearer, holding out her own spoon expectantly.

"Try this, the flavor profile is... exceptional," she stated, a competitive gleam in her eye.

Inigo's brain short-circuited momentarily. H-Hoge was volunteering to feed him? It was like a dream come true!

Heart pounding, he opened his mouth to accept the offering. The sweetness of the fruit parfait exploded on his tongue. But even better was the flutter in his chest at Hoge's focused attention. She was actually feeding him with her own hand!

Across the table Hailey scoffed. "Oh please!"

To Hifumi's flustered spluttering, she swept up a huge dollop of ice cream and popped it right into his open mouth. "There's my big strong guy!"

Hifumi managed an uneasy thumbs up, nearly choking.

Hoge's eyes narrowed. Never one to back down from a challenge, she smoothly gathered a larger spoonful of parfait and raised an questioning brow at Inigo.

He gulped. No way he was turning this down! "I-I'm ready!"

In went the huge bite, nearly filling his whole mouth. He chewed vigorously, ice cream dripping down his chin. Totally worth it though!

Hailey saw dripping ice cream on Hifumi and pounced on the chance to one-up Hoge. "Whoops, let me get that for you!"

Before Hifumi could react, she leaned in and licked the ice cream off his face in one swipe. Hifumi froze, flushing slightly.

"Delicious!" Hailey declared smugly.

Hoge's eyes flashed. Carefully she dabbed at the streak of dessert on Inigo's cheek with a napkin. The gentle touch made his heart skip several beats. He was in heaven!

This romantic escalation continued as the girls aggressively fed their embarrassed but willing boyfriends. Inigo exchanged a giddy grin with Hifumi - they sure weren't complaining!

Finally the desserts were demolished, leaving two very satisfied and two very flustered teens. Inigo was basking in the lingering thrill of Hoge's attentiveness. Who knew she had such a competitive romantic side?

Meeting Hifumi's eyes, they had to laugh. Whatever was happening, the boys wouldn't trade it for the world.

Inigo's good mood was cut off by his ringtone blaring to life. He fumbled with his phone. "Whoops, sorry guys! I should get this..."

He stepped away and hit 'Accept Call'. He was greeted by a familiar raspy voice.

"Greetings, young man. A moment of your time?"

His blood chilled. Desolator.

"Uh, now's not really a good time..." He whispered anxiously. Why was he calling directly? Had something happened?

"Come now, after that rousing display yesterday? We have a lot to talk about. I've yet to thank you for getting healing for the Five," Desolator's tone was light, but he sensed the steel underneath. Heart pounding, Inigo agreed reluctantly and moved to a quiet corner.

"First, congratulations on your success." He almost sounded impressed. "You're making quite a name for yourself already."

"Thanks, but I'm just trying to keep up with the others."

"No need for modesty. I come bearing bad new, young man. Your older brother, Luccione broke out of your family home three days ago. He killed some good men on the way out," An edge entered his voice on the last words.

"What? How?" Inigo tensed.

Desolator chuckled. "It seems he had some outside help. The clan has mobilized resources to deal with him. Nothing that should concern you and your friends. Enjoy your little outing. But do let me know if Luccione tries to contact you." 

Little outing? Friends? Inigo looked around the shopping center. Was Desolator watching them? 

"Where are you right now, Sam?"

The amiable tone hardened. "I trust you understand certain affairs are best left alone? The Five works for another branch of your family now. So you shouldn't be asking questions, young man."

Somehow he knew Inigo tried gathering intel on the Five from Gorou. Inigo shook his head. "Don't worry, I'm just making sure you don't try and get revenge on Chris. Just leave us alone and we'll leave you alone."

"Excellent. I'm pleased we understand each other." The warmth returned to Desolator's voice, setting his nerves on edge even more. "Well, I won't keep you. Enjoy celebrating with your friends. They're lucky to have you watching over them."

*And you're lucky, I haven't gone all out against you with Chris.*

As if reading his thoughts, Desolator added casually, "Do give Christopher my regards. His mother would be so proud of the man he's become. He's got a license now. He'll be following in her footsteps soon enough."

The implied threat made Inigo's blood turn to ice. The call ended abruptly, leaving him shaken. This wasn't good - Desolator clearly had them on his radar now. He had to find a way to protect his friends before it was too late. If anything happened to them because of him...and now Luccione's out there too...

"Hey man, you good?"

Inigo jumped at Hifumi's voice. He was giving Inigo a weird look. "You've been standing there muttering to yourself for a while."

Inigo forced a grin. No need to worry him over paranoid thoughts. "Huh? Oh yeah, I'm fine!"

Hifumi studied Inigo a second longer before shrugging. "If you say so. C'mon, let's grab some food to go!" He headed off eagerly.

With a mental sigh, Inigo followed.

####Chapter 4: Nagoya Station
Inigo paced anxiously, sneaking glances at the station clock. Their shuttle departure loomed, yet no sign of Rosethorn-sensei. She was never late - had something happened? The other passengers bustled obliviously around him, but unease prickled his senses. Nearby, Hifumi and Hailey murmured to each other, faces creased in concern.

"Sensei's gonna chew us out if we miss our ride," Hifumi muttered. Inigo nodded grimly. An angry Rosethorn was not to be risked.

Only Hoge seemed unperturbed, typing away on her phone. After a moment she looked up, eyes hard behind her glasses. "It appears there's been an incident downtown delaying traffic. Likely sensei is caught in the disruption."

"An incident?" Inigo felt his pulse pick up.

Hoge showed them her phone - a breaking news alert about a supervillain attack near the station. Plumes of smoke rose in the distance over the skyline. Hero agencies were scrambling to respond.

Inigo tensed. Wherever trouble brewed, heroes were duty bound to intervene. "We should investigate. Sensei may require backup."

"Whoa, hang on! You're still injured, Hay" Hifumi protested, waving his hands. "Shouldn't we leave this to the pros?"

"We are pros, dummy!" Hailey shot back. At Hifumi's hurt look, she amended, "I mean, we've got our provisional licenses now. This is what we trained for."

Inigo placed a hand on Hifumi's shoulder. "She's right, bro. And if people are in danger, we gotta help out." After a moment Hifumi nodded, jaw set.

Satisfied, Inigo activated his quirk and Gigan grew into its large dragon form. People around them in the station gasped. "Let's move out. We'll get there faster from the air! SORRY FOLKS! HERO BUSINESS! COMING THROUGH!" The crowd made way.

Hifumi whooped and leapt onto Gigan's back without warning. "Hell yeah, I've been itching for some action!"

Blinking, Inigo managed to help Hoge on without stumbling. "Right! Everyone hang on!"

Hailey followed Hifumi's lead, holding on, as Inigo took flight. Soon they were soaring over the streets of Nagoya. Gigan followed the sounds of sirens.
