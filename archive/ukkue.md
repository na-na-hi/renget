Title: Suisei Is Upset
Suisei: So you've bought another new figurine?

Of course I did, what else could I do but increase my collection, the collective additon of the Yumeko 1203 is necessary.

Suisei: .......

I ignore her and continued to focus my attention on my toys, however...

*thud thud thud* Suisei seemed quite impatient or perhaps upset, as she kept slamming her feet down in the floor.

Curious I asked what the matter was.

Suisei: Are you aware what day it is today?

Hmm the day today....

"Ahhhh, I see, you're talking my mom's birthday? Don't worry my mom decided to move it next Friday since she had plans, I thought she texted you?"

Although I meekly asked that question, I couldn't help but notice Suisei halfway didn't even bother listening to me as she stared at me with furious eyes.

"S-sorry...."

Those words left my mouth, I couldn't think of anything else to say.

The woman stared at me with dissapointment as she did a sigh and finally decided to give an answer.

Suisei: I don't even want to bother, here.

Suisei threw me a wrapped box at my face as I tumble to the floor almost hitting the furniture.

"H-hey! I could've dropped this!"

Suisei: .....

Suisei left the room as I was left to my own thoughts and stared at the box....what is this I wonder...

I decided to unwrap after all it was made for me....that reminds me...

"I haven't even gotten her present ready yet...but a present for what..."

As I finished unwrapping the box while thinking of these thoughts, I saw a picture of me and Suisei in a picture frame.

"Oh, it's the time we attended that party, and the lower right...it has a date imprinted on it..."

As I looked at the date, I realized....
"Oh fuck..."

I texted Suisei telling her "I know what to do now"....Suisei didn't respond but she saw the message. She knows me well enough on what I meant by that.

Alhough it's because she knows me well....I know she won't be suprised at all by what I would bring.

"Ah I know...maybe I should contact her"

I decided to contact one of my coworkers, Kanata Hiromi, we contact each other and she stills owes me one for sending her home with my car that one time.

Kanata: Yes?

"Hey, do you have time, I need to pick a present for Suisei"

Kanata: Sure, I'll ask why later, where?

I texted her where we would meet up and as she arrived she was dressed quite casually, with a pink hoodie jacket and a mask covering almost half her face.

"Kanata, what's with the get up?"

Kanata: Well would you want to be seen by your coworker-slash-friend and people assuming your a couple?

"......"

Kanata: So, what pissed her off this time, did you forget your anniversary or something? Hahaha

"......"
Kanata: Wait I got it right? Maybe I should become a fortune teller....but in all seriousness you really forgot your anniversary? Hahaha

Kanata laughed at my misery, it unnerved me but I still need her help.

"If you're done laughing, yeah you're right,, I'm a goofball and forgot our anniversary, so please help me find a gift fast"

Kanata: I'd be glad to, come on I know a great store here for those types of stuff

I was finally reaching somewhere, that's a good feeling.

=======Meanwhile======

Suisei: Let me check up on him, he might be getting scammed again...

Suisei although her feelings never openly showed it, showed concern for him despite all the dissapointments he brings her.

Suisei: Hmm, a nearby store, oh that brown hair that's him and he's with....

A change in the atmosphere happened and Suisei's eyes darkened.

Suisei: Is that a woman...?

=======Meanhwhile======

Kanata: So just give that to her, all girls love rings nowadays.

"But still, I feel like there's something missing"

Kanata: A woman gave her free time to find a present for your woman who you forgot to appreciate and yet you're still being nitpicky.

"........"

Kanata: Are you that serious about this?

"I want to suprise her.....no matter what"

Kanata: Well what's the first thing that comes in your mind when Suisei is mentioned

"Her singing...her will to be relentless and never give up"

Kanata: Ew...not that
"You mean, what she likes?"

Kanata nods

"Well like I said she likes singing and...oh no..."
Kanata: Seeing you with that face, I guess you found your answer.
"I'm not doing it, I don't fit with it at all, I'm not going shounen"

Kanata: Going shounen!? Hahaha, you're going to cosplay? I'd love to see that.

Suisei: Yeah, well I'd love to know why you both are here

"S-suisei?"

Kanata: Hoshimachi...

Suisei: Is there a problem, oh did I intervene in something I shouldn't have.

Suisei had a menacing gaze in her eyes, she was very upset and I know why.

"W-wait Suisei when did you get here, how much did you here?"

"As much as I needed to, I heard about you cosplaying and this woman loving to see it...privately"

Kanata had a flushed face at the words of Suisei.

Kanata: I did not say that! I-

Kanata stared at my direction...perhaps contemplating if she should spill the beans.
Kanata: Nevermind, I’m leaving


But perhaps Kanata was self-conscious she decided to let it off this one time.

But just as Kanata was about to leave.
Kanata: Hik!

Kanata let out a scream, of course who wouldn’t because Suisei just suddenly grabbed her left arm as she was about to leave the door.

Suisei: Don’t think you’re getting away with this.
Kanata: Let go, it hurts!

“Suisei, what the hell are you doing let her go!”

I couldn’t stand seeing my friend get hurt, I mean I understand she’s upset but even this is too violent even for her….this reminds me of…
“What happened last 2 months ago” I mumbled.

Suisei being alarmed let go of Kanata immediately as Kanata stared at me and scurried off.
Suisei: Explain.
“……Like I said when I texted you I know what to do now so I’m getting a present for you”

Suisei: …..
“I know you don’t believe me but I swear we met up-“

Suisei: I believe you
Suisei smiled in front of me.
Suisei: Of course I believe you, I mean we’ve known each for a year, I’d know you well that you feel bad about what happened this morning…that’s why I also felt bad and wanted to apologize…
“N-no, it’s my fault I forgot to get you a present, no more than that….I’m ashamed that I forgot that today was our anniversary”

Suisei: You were always a busy guy, focusing on your collection and your job….but that’s exactly what I like about you, even if you’re not always the most sociable…and most attentive person towards even me…
“So then you”

Suisei: I forgive you…and I hope you forgive me as well
“That’s a given hahaha”

Suisei: So, about that present…
“Um, cough cough that’s still a work in progress please wait a bit more”

Suisei: Hmm, just attend the party this 6 PM.
Suisei suddenly sticked closer to my face and whispered in my ear
Suisei: I made reservations in a….private room.

“Private room”

My face flushed…I think I know what she’s implying….
“I’ll definitely be there!”

Suisei smiled as she left….but then she stopped walking and grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the store.

“Eh? Is there something else”

Suisei: That woman…she reminds me of someone I’ve seen before….do you know her?

“Eh did you forget? She’s my coworker, you met each some time ago when you visited me at work”

Suisei: Oh, I see…is she a long time friend?

“Yeah, we’ve been together since the boss assigned us in the same team, I gotta be honest I pulled most of the work but it would have been impossible if she wasn’t there”

Suisei: Hey.
Suisei stared at my with furious eyes.
Suisei: It’s nothing big but…why have you never mentioned her before…

“Hm? Well you never asked much about my job so…”

Suisei: Nevermind, just be there by 6, don’t break that promise”

Suisei abruptly left and I was left to my own thoughts, I was worried about Kanata so I quickly texted her to ask if she was alright.

Kanata send a furious bear LINE message, although I wouldn’t blame her arm got grabbed pretty hard there.
“Sorry about Suisei”
Kanata: “I don’t blame her….I’m too pretty after all hehehe~ :>

I sighed in relief, it seems Kanata is still fine
Kanata: So, have you finally bought a present?

“No, not yet”

Kanata: Well count me out, and don’t you dare ask me come with you there!
“I won’t, I won’t”
“I’ll deal with this myself”
Kanata: GL then
====MEANWHILE====
Kanata turned off her phone and sighed staring at the ceiling.
Kanata: Ugh..
Kanata’s arm was still hurting she lied to him about it because she didn’t want him to waste any more time.
Kanata: Still that woman…was one crazy bitch
That’s one thing Kanata wouldn’t disagree about.
Kanata’s Mom: Honey, can you buy some medicine for your grandfather it’s run out, I left the prescription notes on the table. Thank you

Kanata: Oh, well I needed a reason to go out anyways
Kanata decided to go to the pharmacy office to get the medicine nothing worthwhile much happened she got it successfully.
Her phone started ringing while on her way home.
Kanata: Excuse me who’s this?
“……..”
Kanata: Hello?
“……..”

The caller kept being silent, they must have gotten the wrong numbe-
“Found you”
A feminine voice rang out in streets….wait isn’t that..

“Hosimachi?”


=====================


Kanata: “Hosimachi?”
This is too strange…why is she here….and what did she mean by that but based from that awful look on her face.

Kanata: “Don’t get any closer”

I brought out the peppermint spray in my bag, usually this is to defend against perverts but I can’t believe I’m using it for this situation!
Kanata: “Well, say something!”

Suisei: “You…you’re quite a whore aren’t you”


Kanata: “H-huh?”

Suisei footsteps echoed in the streets and she approached me closer.
Kanata: Hik!

Out of my sheer desperation I started spraying everywhere hoping it would get in her eyes but I made a big mistake..
Kanata: AHHHHH!
My arm, ah….Suisei got my arm, but how did she….
Kanata: How did you…
Suisei used the cloth in her dress to wipe her face.
Suisei: Dodge all that? Hah….isn’t it simple, it’s useless if my eyes are closed, tsk, guess I gotta do some dry cleaning later.

Kanata: Ah….
I’m screwed, what does she want, oh my god please, what could it possibly be….
Kanata: W-wait, is this about him? Look, the honest truth is, I was HELPING HIM GET YOU A PRESENT”
Suisei: …..

Suisei suddenly reveals a knife behind her back and I almost felt my stomach turn inside out.
Kanata: P-please wait, I’m sorry okay! I won’t go near him anymore, I won’t tell anyone about thi-
Kanata: ….
Kanata: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
Suisei suddenly places a cloth on my mouth
Suisei: Oh would you shut it..
An unbearable pain in my body, ah did she just stab my arm, ahhhh it hurts it hurts it hurts…why oh why is this happening to me.
Suisei: Hey, look me in the eyes.
I stared at her eyes filled with pure darkness, I felt like she could kill me so easily at any moment…no….I know she’ll kill me…I started to cry begging anyone to save me.

Suisei: You brought this to your self, those eyes….are the eyes of someone who loves him is it not?

What…I love him? Has she gotten crazy….ah this pain….my arm still hurts.
Suisei: Hey focus!
Suisei suddenly revealed an alcohol bottle out her pocket, wait is she-
Kanata: *Muffled screams*

Suisei poured the contents of the entire alcohol on my open wound, it hurts it hurts. She grabs my face bringing it closer to hers.
Suisei: You brought this to yourself.
My body felt cold, my body felt like it got paralyzed….was I having a “seizure”….of course I couldn’t handle that much pain….ah it still hurts but not so much anymore…
Suisei already stabbed me in the throat, I can’t even….breathe….
“Mom……Grandpa….”

==============
I looked at the bitch finally dead in my eyes, that white haired bitch dare to steal my man…
I stared at the paper bag that Kanata had, and I saw some medicine inside…..ugh my clothes are dirty.
Suisei: ….I’ll bring this with me.
I decided to fled the scene, I only needed to hide the murder weapon, besides I already established an alibi at a nearby hotel…. Matsuri is playing video games while I left a voice recording of myself singing in my room…I’ll return to the backroom by then.
I sighed as I finally got back to my room, although….I couldn’t help but smile when I remember what happened to that bitch…Kanata was it? Ah those screams, that face…
I smiled….and this day will get even more better after all…. I’ll finally get to the party with him, I hope he gets something decent for me after all that hard work.
*Knock Knock*
Suisei: Come in!
Matsuri: Hey, you’ve been singing for like an hour now, have you finally stopped, I was curious but you weren’t even streaming Suichan!
I chucked a laugh, of course I was busy murdering a bitch after all…
Suisei: Oh, sorry I was just practicing, the real karaoke starts tomorrow.
Matsuri: Practicing for tomorrow….can you do it tomorrow, I want to sleep.
Suisei: Ah sorry Matsuri~

I grabbed Matsuri by her head and hugged her, apologizing.
Matsuri: Ah, don’t stick so close to me…eh what’s that smell? Smells kinda weird

Suisei: Ah, sorry
Right, I only sprayed perfume I forgot….but if Matsuri has realized I’ll have no choice but to…
Matsuri: Did singing made you smell that much? I’m going to sleep, you be first to shower, I’ll play with my PC for a little bit.
Suisei: Okay~

Matsuri left the room and I let out a sigh of relief.
