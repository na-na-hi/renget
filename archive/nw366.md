#Macro Cheetah story

>Used to be on top of the world
>Now you're literally on the bottom of it
>Getting reduced to a few inches tall does that to a person
>Virus didn't just make men small
>It gave some animals human level intelligence
>Can't tell which is the bigger shock
>For some reason some of the women start meeting with the animals
>No idea what kind of deal is going behind those closed doors at first
>Then overhear a wolf talk about life becoming lonely after the IQ boost
>Get a memo John was let go
>Next day a lioness excitedly yells "companion" during a meeting before a chorus of others tell her to shush
>Get a memo Timothy was let go
>Put two and two together
>No way they would do that to you too, would they?
>You was still technically their boss
>Those two were always causing trouble even before the virus anyway
>Had been on the verge of firing them multiple times before yourself
>All of you shrinking made you reconsider
>Wonder if the would have been better off now if you did fire them
>Next three days nothing else happens
>Start to feel relief that those were probably just isolated incidents
>Realize Joshua is missing
>Start to panic until you get a videocall from him
>Called to tell you he won't be coming to work anymore
>He sounds both strained and... excited?
>The wall behind him moves
>Realize that's actually his pet cat standing right behind him
>Recall him saying how he considered himself lucky his cat was one of those the virus made intelligent or he would have been lunch
>And how that had made her affectionate
>A little too affectionate
>Could swear you saw a feline paw reaching towards him
>He ends the call
>A deer walks past you to the meeting rooms
>Eyes you hungerly the whole way until the door closes
>You bolt
>Had no idea you could run that fast
>Or that far
>Funny how the threat of becoming a butt plug to a giant cervid can motivate someone
>Good thing you work at a shipping company
>Duck into a crate
>Try to catch breath
>And think of a plan
>Crate starts to move
>Panic reaches new levels
>Start to leave only to discover create is already high in the air
>No idea where you are being shipped
>But it's not a short trip
>Pretty sure you are on a boat from the rocking
>Hours of an adrenaline high takes it's toll
>Fall asleep from exhaustion
>Wake up
>Still on the boat
>Remember these things are all automated now
>Dare to venture outside
>Can't see much over the guardrails other than sky
>Wave suddenly causes the ship to lurch
>Tossed off like a pinball into the air
>See golden colored plains rapidly approaching
>Too scared to scream
>Tall stalks of straw break your fall
>At least some good came from being small
>Scratch that
>None of this would have happened if you wasn't small
>Look around
>Is this a savanna?
>Mind almost numb with fear of all the ways a mouse-sized human can meet an end here
>Hear something big come up behind you
>That was almost on cue
>Not sure how you managed to get the courage to look behind you
>It's a feline
>Fuck
>Look up
>A cheetah
>Do cheetahs eat mice?
>Cheetah starts lowering it's mouth towards you
>Start to wonder if this was some cosmic entity's sick answer to your question
>Too numb with fear to even care anymore
>Screw it, you welcome the end at this point
>At least it beats becoming some animal's a toy
>The mouth opens
>Still feel nothing
>Wait for the bite to happen
>Bite does not happen
>What does happen causes a small piece of fear you didn't even know you had left to surface
>It talked
>This cheetah had also been effected by the virus
>"My my, and just what even are you?"
>Mutter a weak "...fuck" under your breath
>The cheetah's ears perk
>"And you can talk too!"
>Somehow you managed to make it worse
>"Don't worry, we definitely will. It gets pretty lonely around here."
>And even worse
>"And you look like you would be pretty fun, come here"
>A feline paw reaches towards you
>Life has a way of throwing people curveballs
>You in particular however life seems to have used a pitching machine
>Aimed it at your nuts
>And you hated everything about it
>Hate that you and every other male are smaller than a mouse
>Hate that it made you lose your high-class standing in life
>Hate that horny animals started becoming intelligent and taking your place
>Hate that women seemed to be fine with this and even selling out the men to those fleabags
>Hate that your attempts to prevent this just resulted in you ending up miles away from home and in the paws of an even more unlikely feline
>Hate that it was quite obvious what that perverted cat wanted from you
>Hate that after a week it became clear you could not survive a day in this wasteland without it nearby for protection
>You give a dirty glare towards said feline when the shadow of it's behind caught your attention
>It noticed your stare and shook it towards you
>"Wanna' taste a Savannah delicacy?"
>Where the hell did it even learn things like that?
>Tali, as you have had the misfortune of being told her...IT'S name, had still not let up in it's seduction attempts
>And that is probably what you hated the most about all this
>You had tried to continue living as normal as you could
>After the animals shattered that delusion you tried to escape
>Beat being at the mercy of some deranged quadruped
>Got caught anyway
>After that you were just ready to die
>At least the torture would end
>But got denied even that
>Utterly broken you were ready to just stop thinking and accept being a toy
>And that was when it did the worst thing possible
>Tal-the cheetah did nothing
>It didn't mercilessly grab you
>It didn't bite you
>It didn't just drop it's rear on you
>It didn't stick you in whatever hole it felt like
>The thing you hate the most
>Hate that you weren't even allowed to just give up and let whatever happen to your pathetic little body
>It wanted you willingly
>And thanks to that you were forced to stay lucid
>Which meant dealing with the constant reminder of how far you had fallen
>Literally and figuratively
>A loud thump catches your attention
>Tali had rolled onto her back and was tryi-The cheetah had rolled onto it's back and was trying to give you sad eyes
>Why couldn't this cat have just been a cat and taken what it wanted?
>Then you wouldn't have to put up with it's infuriating games
>Some damn giant spotted ball of fur trying to make you desire it
>Just take what you want by force
>Just like all the others
>They probably got off easy
>John has likely long since been spelunking in that ugly wolf
>No way that stupid lioness wouldn't have made a meal out of Timothy
>"Companion" my ass
>And Joshua...
>Ok, Joshua was weird.
>He sounded oddly excited to "quit" his job, but he always was an odd one
>Inattentive too
>How could he have not seen his cat reaching towards him as he ended the call?
>He likely had no idea what the cat was planning
>What poor timing that he ended the call as it grabbed for him
>Poor sod could have called for help
>...
>...
>...
>Yeah, that's definitely how it went down
>You keep telling yourself
>A lithe spotted leg the size of a tower softly lands to your side
>It caused your fear to rise again
>But not because of the reasons one might think
>There was one more secret item on your hate list
>Unable to resist, your gaze follows the leg up
>You yet again could not pry your eyes off of the ch-Tali's imposing form regardless of how hard you tried
>Hate that you are finding it harder and harder to reject i-her
>An animal!
>... that at this point talks and acts human
>... had attractive patterns and a fluffy body
>... and you admit, a nice ass
>She notices you staring, for the hundredth time, and slowly pads above you putting on a show
>Your eyes stick to her like glue
>You gulp as you realize you had been staring at both the space between her legs... and under her tail
>Just how the hell far have you fallen?
>You pray she doesn't ask if you are interested again today
