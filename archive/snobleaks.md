###%powderblue%1.7 Story Preview%%
Note|Speaker|en_US
-|-|-
Narration||Ten months ago.
|Kegaard|I understand you, τ, so I have no reason to be nervous.
|Kegaard|The Fifth Research Institute — I can give you the access key to the control room.
|Kegaard|It will be activated after our transaction is complete.
||
|Adjutant|The Fifth Research Institute?
|Kegaard|You haven't told him yet, τ?
|Kegaard|From whose hands were the Titans born... And who escaped their cage, leading to all of this?
|Kegaard|The truth is hidden in the research institute.
Narration||The large man didn't say anything else, patting my shoulder and walking toward the security door.
|Kegaard|I admire you, Adjutant. You are the most extraordinary young man I've ever met. I believe you will make it there and learn everything.
|Kegaard|However, as far as true knowledge of the divine is concerned, it is only the tip of the iceberg... That's it.
Narration||The sound of his cane hitting the ground acted like a silent order, leading the security door in front of him to open.
|Kegaard|τ, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get closer to the divine... It was a good deal.
|Kegaard|Farewell. May you and I remain true to ourselves in our pursuit of true knowledge.
Scene change|Old TV Set|Welcome to our July 12th broadcast. Mads Kegaard, leader of the mysterious group known as the "Adventists," as well as Sophie, a key member of the organization, have been confirmed missing...
|Old TV Set|Insiders have revealed that the disappearance of these two individuals was unexpected even within the organization. This incident is still under investigation...
Silhouette 1|???|Ah... Why...
Silhouette 1|???|Why only Sophie...?
Scene change|Old TV Set|Welcome to our November 15th broadcast. Conflict has broken out at the Towers again, starting at 9 o'clock yesterday night and continuing to 4 o'clock this morning.
|Old TV Set|We currently have no casualty numbers, but judging by the drone footage, this is likely the deadliest conflict since the infamous "Towers Incident"...
|Old TV Set|This event was once again triggered by the spread of Titagen contamination. What's more, insiders who escaped from Containment Zone Aleph reported not seeing the Exarch throughout the entire conflict. It is suspected that the Adventist group structure is beginning to collapse...
Silhouette 2|???|High Presbyter...
Silhouette 2|???|What did I do wrong... to cause you to abandon me...? Without your approval, what is the value of my own existence...?
Scene change|Old TV Set|Welcome to our February 6th broadcast. The three-month-long "Second Towers Incident" is finally over... Judging by footage sent in by our field reporters, the Towers were seriously damaged. Any residents that hadn't already fled on their own have been evacuated.
|Old TV Set|Moving forward, refugee rescue and resettlement projects will be implemented. In addition, changes will be made to various fiscal plans for Containment Zone Aleph...
|Male Scavenger|Turn off that crap. There hasn't been any good news for months. Just hearing it irritates me.
|Female Scavenger|What to scrounge up something to eat? I heard there's an old couple about five kilometers away. They—
|Female Scavenger|Who's there?
|Male Scavenger|Hey, take a look through the window. Maybe they're one of ours.
Narration||The man stood up from the ground, slowly drawing the pistol on his hip.
||However...
||The moment the woman stuck her head out of the window, her body exploded into a bloody mess.
|Male Scavenger|Oh sh—
Narration||As for the man, a laser pierced his chest in the same second he shot the intruder in the shoulder.
|Sartre|...
|Sartre|...There's no sign of the High Presbyter here either...
|Sartre|Time to go...
|Sartre|Argh... My body is already...
Narration||The man who had fallen to the ground finally realized his right leg was missing, his body covered in wounds.
||He'd lost his mind ever since Mads Kegaard left. He had traversed Containment Zone Aleph in search of the High Presbyter, experiencing countless conflicts...
||Now, his already dimming light was being extinguished for good.
||He didn't struggle. It was as if he'd accepted the fact that he was abandoned...
||The sound of light footsteps reached his ears.
|Sartre|...?
Silhouette 3|???|Pathetic scum. Open your eyes.
Silhouette 3|???|If you have any reverence for your gods, you should recognize me and remember my name.
Narration||The girl wore white clothes and held a white branch, staring at him with blue eyes.
|Sartre|Ah... Edda... our lily-white deity... Why have you come here?
|Real Edda|In pursuit of misery and suffering, and to bestow you with a new purpose.
|Real Edda|My poor child. It is not yet time for you to give up your life and enter Valhalla.
|Real Edda|I want you to become the new High Presbyter and grant you, and other abandoned individuals like you, happiness.
|Real Edda|Are you willing to accept this new purpose?
Narration||I will become... the new High Presbyter...
||I will replace the one... who abandoned me...
||...
|Sartre|I... accept...
|Real Edda|Then the pact has been established.
||And with that, the girl raised the white branch in her hand and stabbed the man in the chest with it.
|Real Edda|From now on, you work for me.
Scene change|Enya (Hospital Gown)|Ah, it's snowing outside! Coming down pretty hard, too~
|Cherno (Hospital Gown)|But it's spring... It shouldn't be that cold...
|Enya (Hospital Gown)|Hehe, by the way, the Adjutant is getting back from Yehrus this afternoon. He'll probably be surprised. Who knew it would snow here too?
|Cherno (Hospital Gown)|Then we should make some hot soup so he can warm up when he gets here.
|Enya (Hospital Gown)|Sure! Let's get to it~
