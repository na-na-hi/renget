-Last Resort: A massive mech strong enough to bring down some country's military by itself. Absurdly expensive and time-consuming, it’s named like that for a reason. (Cost: 10M & 1 year)

-K.I.S.A upgrade: Etsy says this is the second to last upgrade. It’ll be able to support another alloy and last much longer in combat thanks to an internal mini-nuclear engine. She assures you it won’t go full chernobyl if it gets destroyed, although she does mention it is something it can do if you want it to. (cost: 5M & 5 months)

-Squire: A cheaper version of K.I.S.A, while it isn’t half as strong or sturdy, it is much faster and stealthier as it isn’t weighed down by all the extra armaments of its superior. Excellent for scouting and low danger missions. Can be equipped with an experimental alloy for 150K extra. You can build more than one. (Cost: 400K & 1.5 months)

City specific dossier:

Vladivostok:
The city has a rather low supernatural activities on land, but one should always be careful when going near the water as many creatures lurk there, some more obvious than others. Because of this, the Russian agency usually focuses their efforts on patrolling the sea and beaches rather than the city itself.

The agency is however still very capable of taking care of most land based threats, and they are very wary of foreign spies, especially American one, as the covert magic war between the two nations is still ongoing.

Apart from this, the city is pretty safe for the average citizens who do not work near the water.

Stuttgart:
The city has a small special force supervising it, everyone within it is incredibly competent, a few of them even sitting at an immense magic potential level, but their numbers are in the single digit and as such rarely bother with anything that isn't going way too far. As for the survival tips, they amount to 'never go home alone after dark' and 'make sure to open and close every closet in your house at least once a week'. Apart from this, it doesn't seem like a bad place to raise a kid at all.

The Kraken’s Tongue:
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 20M

The Kraken’s Tongue is a high potential magic user living in Vladivostok currently working in an oil refinery. His magic is speech related, the more someone speak of him, by name, title or description, the more of a ‘hold’ he gets on them. Mentioning his name a few time creates a weak hold that dissipates after a few days, and allows him to hear anything the victim says. A medium hold triggers when a proper conversation involving him happens. A strong hold triggers when an elaborate description of the Kraken’s Tongue is done by the victim, medium to strong hold can take months if not years to dissipate by themselves.

Medium to strong hold allows the Kraken’s Tongue to alter someone’s spoken sentences. The bigger the hold, the bigger the allowed change is, and the more subtle to the user the effect is. While a strong hold does not affect the victim’s mental state in any significant way, it is very good at convincing the victim that what it said was a freudian slip, which can subsequently gaslight them into believing things they did not before. However, being aware of the Kraken’s Tongue ability makes it harder to be manipulated this way.

Holds only applies when VOCAL mentions of the Kraken’s tongue are done, as such, any written text or messaging about him are exempt from his influence. Thinking about him while speaking about something else or describing someone similar to him is not enough to trigger his hold, as the victim has to make a conscious effort to address the Kraken’s Tongue specifically during their speech.

While the Kraken’s Tongue is not currently a threat to anyone, his ability has a global range that has no known upper limit. As such, its bounty is rather high as many fear what he would be able to do if he actively tried to win the game. Especially since his potential can increase when enough people talk about him.

Demon of the Backstreets:
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 5 million.

The demon of the backstreet was once a rather notorious bully, one who continued to assault their classmate physically all the way up to high-school, then, after their best friend left their side for their behavior, she reflected on herself and decided to live a life of isolation.

She has learned a soul based martial art, and has been able to take on even immense magic potential users and above. Despite this, she has little to no magical potential herself, meaning that the martial art itself can theorically be learned by anyone she is willing to teach it to. She only has one known student: one of the Praying Arthis leftover from the Queen’s fallout. It seems she only teach those she has a favor towards, or that she considers to be ‘pure of heart’.

While she is arguably one of the strongest non magical user there is, she also rarely interferes in other people’s affairs if it does not include the recently awakened infectious personality. Because of this, her bounty is relatively low compared to her perceived strength. If one is to take her on, it is recommended to hold the infectious personality hostage, or to use her own moral code against her. 

If that is not possible, take into account that she can hit her opponent’s soul at frightening speed, and can even negate most types of magic, she is not to be underestimated.


Weaver:
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 500K.

Weaver (or new Weaver as some call him) is a nameless high-school dropout that recently entered a romantic relationship with the Lady of Circuits. Their relationship is steady as of now and show no sign of ending. Weaver’s magic specialize in patterns, and can disrupt a small thing’s trajectory. He is also capable of creating a zone where he can manipulate the speed of everything within it (this might not extend to living things.)

He is equipped with devil’s gamble and light’s bane bullets, making him quite dangerous for people that over rely on their magic to defend themselves. The bullets are also known to curve and move in rather unpredictable ways. While he is only at high potential, he has been growing fast and his ability to analyze his opponents makes him able to see weaknesses that others may not. He is currently enemy with the PCAB agency, and has subdued multiple agents with the Lady of Circuits. His nameless status also implies he may become important in the future, but it could be a red herring.

Lady of Circuits:
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 1 million.

The Lady of Circuits is an inventor currently working for D.I.Y. She recently entered a romantic relationship with Weaver. While she lacks magic potential, her prowess with electronics has been enough to make her an honorary player within the game. While she is quite weak herself, she has paranoid tendencies that makes her prepare many counter measure in case she is attacked. Very little is known about what those counter measures are, as she goes out of her way to stay hidden from us, only leaving her house with Weaver occasionally. It is highly discouraged to invade the house itself, as it looks to be incredibly secure. Instead, it is better to wait for her to leave the house, or to use Weaver as a hostage. Avoid killing Weaver if possible, as it is unknown the length she will go to for revenge. She is currently enemy with the PCAB agency.

Her most notable creation is what many people have dubbed ‘Armaggedon’s Emissiary.’ A machine equipped with devil’s gamble plating and enough weaponry to bring down even immense magical potential opponents. The best course of action when facing it is to simply run or stall for time, it should eventually run out of ammo or energy, whichever comes first. It is often seen with Weaver, supposedly to protect him. 

Schadenfreude:
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 10 million.
A woman capable of lowering the ‘seriousness’ of things surrounding her in a zone. This is one of the few types of magic that actually gives less control to the user the more powerful it becomes. Schadenfreude was actually known to be a rather smart person before, but her magic has turned her into a parody of her old self. She originally strived for godhood in order to fix her worsening mental condition, but it is unlikely she remembers her original goal.

Very little can be said about her ability as it defies description by its very nature. her magic seem to enjoy doing things it finds ‘amusing’, but what counts as amusing changes often, and cannot be relied on. It is recommended to avoid fighting her in her zone if possible, and to never use attacks that look too ‘serious’. Attacks with bright colors were notoriously more effective than those with a darker tone.

Do not under any circumstance kill or let her boyfriend die during the middle of a fight with her. He is her only anchor to reality, and without him, she is very likely to reach a state of true absurdity again.

When her zone reaches true absurdity, all rules stop applying. It might last a thousand year or two minutes, and no matter how powerful you may believe yourself to be, reality will start changing to make you look like a fool. It is believed that even the deep arbiter would struggle to handle her in this situation, and it is recommended to leave her zone and hope either Schadenfreude or the zone itself dissolves after destroying the rule that brought its creation.

There has only ever been one recording of true absurdity, and while the death count was low, it left many people awakened and traumatized. This is believed to be the best case scenario.

Infectious Personality(Leah):
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 5$
A recently awakened woman capable of transferring her emotion to certain objects. Spends a lot of time online, and as such her entire life has basically been fully documented despite her attempts to stay anonymous. She has awakened after a failed suicide attempt, and has stayed unaware of that awakening for a few months. Her potential is believed to be low (possibly medium now). While her magic could evolve into a more dangerous mind control type, her lack of ambition makes her a non threat to most people. She is held by the Lady of Circuits in one of her factories, it is unknown what they are using her for.

The bounty has been set by one of our customer who was called a slur by her online. They said that ‘a comically low bounty was more insulting than no bounty at all’.

Segmented Reality(Sarah):
Info cost: purchased. Bounty: 100K.
An ex-agent of the PCAB agency. She is capable of separating things, like souls from their body or limbs from their torso. Even if her ability is quite powerful, it requires a lot of concentration, making it quite hard to use in high stress situation like combat. She was originally supposed to be kept in use as a support unit, but the Arthis Queen situation forced the PCAB to spread their resource thin and sent her to retrieve the Infectious Personality alone.

She was ambushed during this mission and captured by Weaver. It is believed she is kept in the same factory Infectious personality is held in.
