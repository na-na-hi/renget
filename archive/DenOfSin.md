##Den Of Sin Inside Your Mind 
**(AKA: The /AIDS/ Lorebook Card Repository)**

[TOC3]

###FAQ
####What the fuck is this?
This is a simple repository for /aids/ lorebook cards made for either the Den of Sin or other purposes, pending a better solution which may or may not ever come.
####What the fuck is the Den of Sin?
A spiritual successor prompt to the Infinity Brothel, which pioneered the concept of being able to import characters into a fairly universal prompt for a customizable, quick-and-dirty coom prompt with whatever character you want, provided that character was already created.
####What the fuck are these cards?
Lorebook cards like the ones below are simply PNG files that contain lorebook information. The images in and of themselves have no impact on the AI at all, they are simply there to give you, the schmuck sitting in front of a computer right now, information about what's inside. You can easily import the lorebooks into prompts, and they can contain anything from characters to objects, concepts or locations, though generally characters are the most common.
####What the fuck do I do with the cards?
You can import cards easily in multiple ways.

![Image](https://files.catbox.moe/tpese0.png)

For one, you can go into the lorebook editor and click the import button, after which you select a PNG that has lorebook information embedded.

![Image](https://files.catbox.moe/bcz01r.png)

Alternatively, you can use the "Import File" button under "Options". There, you can select many different files to import, including PNG files.
Finally, you can also just drag and drop the file on the output window - that's the big part of the screen where the actual text of your prompt is in.
After you've imported the file, it depends on what you have. If you have a Den of Sin character, you shouldn't have to do anything. Den of Sin lorebooks use force activation to be activated in a very specific way that works with the associated prompt (see below for that prompt). If you have a non-Den of Sin character, you should check the lorebook, you will probably have to activate the entry manually by invoking the key. You can import non-Den of Sin characters into the Den of Sin and vice versa, they're just lorebooks in the end, but you might not get the best results without some fiddling.
####How the fuck do I make my own?
If you just want to make a lorebook image, you just go into the lorebook editor and click "Embed Lorebook in PNG" (or "Embed Entry in PNG" depending on what you want to do). You select an image to embed into, then NAI will create that image and download it to your hard drive (note, it does not insert it directly into the image, it makes a copy of the image, puts it there and downloads it).
If you want to make a card like those below, the easiest way is to use the cardmaker: https://grotar00.itch.io/nai-card-editor
There are other options available, but this is by far the easiest and requires the least work. (For those that need more control, here's a PSD for a template: https://files.catbox.moe/oqd0in.psd)
If you want to specifically make a Den of Sin card, I recommend using an existing lorebook as a base and simply editing the existing entries with your character of choice. DoS characters follow a fairly strict format that works pretty well, though experimentation is always something you can try. Maybe you can find a better format, who knows?

###Den of Sin: The Prompt: Remastered
>Science truly is marvelous. Thanks to incredible advancements in a field so advanced it might as well be magic, people can now create entire dimensions entirely with their mind. World peace was declared minutes later as it was realized this could be directly used for fucking, or for things that aid in having more time for fucking.

>[Note: Intended to be used with the import of a specific custom lorebook before playing. I have not had good results with the default model, so choose your favorite before playing as well.]
