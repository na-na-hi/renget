>Fighting Style
Music - Drums

A style that stands at the apex of thunder aligned arts that aims to purify both evil spirits and corrupt hearts by means of the Sound of Purification played with the aid of drumsticks which the drummer plays by alternating  strong calculated blows using all of their strength with wild frenzied movements as if possessed by an otherwordly presence, something that Daiyu usually does with a smile on her face, only truly embodying the solemn and steady heart that the technique requires on occasion. 

As a discipline that aims to embody the wrath of the heavens descending onto  sinners, it will not be stopped by flesh or steel alike penetrating and destroying the victim inside out in both body and soul without a single visible wound, as such it cares not if their attacks are parried, relentlessly attacking with the certainty that while not as powerful as a direct strike, damage will build up inside the opponent

Immortal Grade 
>Techniques

####Heavenly Thunderbolt Prayer[Grade 10 Qi Gathering] + [Grade 11 Soul Refining]####
  Thunder aligned cultivation technique, a path to the heavens by means of the greatest song of purification. The drums of Heaven send thunderbolts down to earth, and by playing a comparable song one will open their own path to Heaven. The technique works by deliberately summoning progressively stronger bolts of Tribulation Lightning upon the user in order to purge their Soul of all impurity and evil while gathering extreme amounts of Thunder Qi to steel themselves against the  onslaught of lightning bolts the technique summons. 

  The first stage of the cycle is to modify the Spirit Root, creating the Thunder affinity if it does not exist and then elevating it to Heavenly Thunder, allowing the Dantian to act as both a drum and starting point of the purification process, only to later serve as protection against the Tribulations summoned in the second stage. Because this technique is meant to be used in conjuction with the Pure Sound, the Thunder techniques done with its influence are not only extremely powerful for the usage of the purest form of thunder, but it holds an equally strong anti-evil nature that manifests itself as the Thunder growing closer to the nature of the true Tribulation Lightning, against a target or technique evil enough it truly becomes a smaller Tribulation"

####Heaven Crossing Thunderbolt[Grade 6 Traveling]
A variant of the Devil Seeking Thunderbolt adapted for long range travel, as one maintains the rhythm the lower the cost and the greater the distance they are able to cover, but as a modified version of the original it's possible to easily switch from one technique to the other, building up speed and momentum with Devil Seeking only to transition into Heaven Crossing, or to leisurely build up charge from Heaven Crossing and transitioning into Devil seeking for combat.

####Pure Sound Formation - Standstill[Grade 6 Profession (Formation)]
A Formation technique named after the 12th Hexagram, depicting the proper balance of nature, the pure and proper balance of yin and yang, it's core theory is "As above, so below", therefore the Heavenly song must be above the Earthly world. It aims to use the leylines to prepare the world to channel the sound of purification, creating diverse effects to support the user and purify the land. 

####Pure Sound Style - Duality[Grade 6 Profession (Musician)]####
Covers the study of the Sound of Purification as a traditional musician technique with a focus on different effects depending on the good or evil of the listener, in the same way as the heavens ought to punish the wicked and reward the righteous. A raging drum that invites the righteous to war with its roar while inflicting despair into those fallen from grace, the songs produced by this technique sound completely different depending on the listener, those with evil hearts will hear a horrible cacophony while the pure would hear a beautiful sound.  It's traditionally used not by itself but in conjuction with other techniques, playing the songs from this technique as part of the ability

####Pure Sound Style - 108  Beats of Purification [Grade 11 Attack] + [Grade 10 Ambush]
The true form of the Sound of Purification which originates the other techniques, an attack directed not at an individual but at "one's sins", a tool of purification that resonates inside the victim cleansing them from the inside out by ignoring the physical realm entirely and targeting their existence. The Pure Sound is the ultimate judgement from the Heavens to erase all that is impure and sinful, giving origin to a technique that can purge anything, for what is the value of an indestructible body against one that has transcended the Earth? 

As the Pure Sound resonates it not only destroys but creates a cascade of effects: Immobilizing the affected according to the strength of the Sound, forcefully purifying the target resulting in Spirit, Devil and other such Evil techniques entering in disarray due to the forceful introduction of Heavenly Thunder inside the body and soul. This forceful purification being the origin of the Pure Body technique, and its power increases with the evil in the target, making it so that Devils and Spirits feel great pain merely from the roar of the drum. 


####Ghost Destroying Curse Charm[Grade 11 Reversal]####
A prayer to repel evil spirits and a drum worthy of a great musician as one, this technique summons a drum shaped Qi barrier that when struck by an attack creates the Pure Sound to strike back at the attacker. Against evil spirits or daiosts, this technique holds extreme defensive power with a suitably strong counter.   

The drum serves a dual purpose as both a defensive option but also as the ideal drum for the Pure Sound techniques, making it so that when struck by it, the Charm will instead greatly amplify the techniques used, allowing for grandiose showings of skill when combined with its sister techniques. 

As a unique  Reversal technique based on a barrier, maintaining the technique active is not necessary as it will keep itself for a short while after being summoned, making it so the user only needs to pay an upfront cost to summon the drum barrier and a small amount each time it is struck


####Devil Seeking Thunderbolt[Grade 11 Footwork]####
A technique that grants the ability to make sudden movements between two places at incredible speeds not unlike a thunderbolt descending unto earth. As one keeps the rhythm flowing the more in tune they become with the heavens and each step becomes a grander and grander shockwave while its cost decreases, transforming its wielder into a living thunderstorm crossing great distances with a single step. 

As a thunder aligned movement, it's movement speed naturally stands at the apex especially when it comes to burst movement, but speed is not all it offers for the Sound of Purification created by each step can be modified with the use of other techniques, allowing for both mobility and offensive action as one.

####Evil Reflecting Lightning Mirror[Grade 6 Detection]####
 As lightning comes before thunder, this utility technique comes before judgement. This lightning technique seeks out evildoers and opens the practitioner's eyes to their presence by piercing the darkness that hides them.  It detects targets by their sins, therefore the power of the technique increases drastically when it comes to those who have commited great or many crimes, practice evil techniques or foster a Devil in their hearts, allowing the user to easily identify those they must smite, even if they use illusions or other forms of trickery to hide themselves. 

####Pure Body - Curse Eater[Grade 6 Endurance] 
Created with the intent of protecting oneself from the wild and unpredictable forms of Tribulation, this technique constantly reinforces the body with the Sound of Purification deflecting attacks that touch the body with shockwaves, but it's true purpose is to remove impurities that seep into the flesh and soul, constantly destroying Yin Qi, poisons, curses as well as cleansing the mind from similar kinds of filth.  By itself a valuable technique allowing to fight unbothered by all sorts of poisons, but when combined with other techniques a more active cleansing is possible

####Pure Soul - Inner Cleansing[Grade 6 Auxiliary]
A technique that grants the Soul the ability to more effectively reject all foreign agents and reestablish its ideal state, as the soul and body are linked, so does the Qi inherit the ability to remove external influence such as poisons, illusions and other contaminants. It's obvious usage is to increase one's defenses against foreign bodies, but it also improves the Sound of Purification's ability to debilitate targets.

####Eightfold Resounding Stroke [Grade 6 Barrage]####
A barrage meant for usage with drums which allows one to move their hands 8 times at once while performing 8 strokes with each movement, creating shockwaves that while independant from each other can merge into greater waves to overwhelm the target, a technique used both for long range attacks and for close quarters combat by delivering multiple strikes in what appears to be a single attack. As one realm increases, so does the number of movements and strokes by a factor of 8, when combined with other pure sound techniques is when its true worth appears

Life Bound (Qi)

A pair of drumsticks found in an old mausoleum made with the goal of creating the finest sound, they serve as the ideal focus for the Sound of Purification but the Inscription holds a very particular technique which turns day into a deep misty darkness whose influence steals the senses of those who dwell within: Without a sensory technique, the traditional senses of a daoist are completely sealed while those who hold one have their senses dulled to a certain point

>INFO
One of the many daoists who tried their luck finding Mausoleums in search of powerful techniques and long lost secrets, but the one she found was quite unusual, no deadly monsters, no hidden traps, no  puzzle no one could solve , nothing but an old drum an equally old pair of drumsticks and an unending song resouding in all rooms of the palace.  Fascinated by the music, Daiyu spent  days  as if posessed trying over and over again to recreate the sound she has heard, until one day it stopped and the girl exited the place changed.

Lei sees herself as the one who will fix the heavens and bring back righteousness to the land, if the current Heaven has forgotten how it is meant to be, all She needs is someone to show her what her place is, although Daiyu isn't bothered by the idea of taking the position away from Her if that's what is required. The girl isn't afraid of losing Face if it means living by the ideals she has set for herself after being graced with the Sound of Purification that day

A cultivator who always wears a smile, someone whose friendliness can be seen just by seeing her face and one of the  notorious musicians of the land having performed both on the most desolate of regions to the greatest palaces, her usual cheery behavior when interacting with her fans makes it very easy to forget she's technically a great saint who has cleansed many evil spirits and daoists alike.  For all her lack of "elderliness", Daiyu is in fact the founder of a small sect of eccentrics that have inherited different forms of her iconic techniques with different sound weapons, something she doesn't usually mention unless required to.

For all her sanguine tendencies, the girl can be quite phlegmatic for even if she rushes headfirst into danger, it is not done out of recklessness but of concern for the wellbeing of people and desire to see justice done, as well being quite the good listener simply enjoying to hear the stories of others and the happiness it brings them. 

While usually carefree with a philosophy that can be summarized as "Well it turned all right in the end didn't it?", Daiyu is capable of mustering the stern heart that is required for proper send off to those who have strayed too far away from the path of righteousness.
