# /gedg/ Compendium

Welcome to the Game and Engine Development General or [/gedg/](https://boards.4channel.org/g/gedg) Compendium.

We have a [wiki](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Gedg)!

Also check out our IRC channel [#/g/gedg on rizon](https://qchat.rizon.net/?channels=/g/gedg)!

>Why does this general exist, isn't  [/agdg/](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/agdg) already a thing?

The goal is to allow for a more technical forum when discussing these topics.  One large incentive for posting on /gedg/ is code blocks. On /g/ you can share code like so

[code]
paste your code here
[/code]

Feel free to post about what you are working on by sharing code, pics, or [making webms](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/WebM).  The feedback will drive you to keep working! The general is also receptive to in depth conversations on emulation and modding, but you should take questions like "what roms are best?" or "what emulator should I use and how do I configure it?" to [/emugen/](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/emugen).

If you want relevant resources or other additions to the compendium,  ask Froggy !!UYKMqlVW9eC who maintains it. Strong disagreements about the contents of the compendium amongst posters or with Froggy can be handled by holding a vote of what should and shouldn't be present. In the worst case scenario, the markdown file can be easily taken and other posters can branch out with what they think is best. 

A lot of the links use rentry.org, if .org is down try .co instead.

### Current Polls

Polls are used as an effort to keep things democratic on the general.

## Game Jams

Game jams are held on itch.io. Make sure to read their [terms of service](https://itch.io/docs/legal/terms); posters on /g/ who have become accustomed to posting &#128557; and the [gamer word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nigger) should tread carefully. 

[List of Jams](https://rentry.org/gedg-jams)

> Can I use "x" tool to make the game?
Yes.
> Can I use ai?
Do what you want, make the games how you want.

## Progress Days

Post your progress monthly. Unlike game jams you can work on something old. Submit to itch.io like we do with game jams. The difference is you work on your stuff before the jam officially starts, then submission is open for a couple of days.
