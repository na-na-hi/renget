# /gedg/ Compendium

Welcome to the Game and Engine Development General or [/gedg/](https://boards.4channel.org/g/gedg) Compendium.

We have a [wiki](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Gedg)! If you find a helpful resource, make sure to add it there. 

Also check out our IRC channel [#/g/gedg on rizon](https://qchat.rizon.net/?channels=/g/gedg)!

>Why does this general exist, isn't  [/agdg/](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/agdg) already a thing?

The goal is to allow for a more technical forum when discussing these topics.  One large incentive for posting on /gedg/ is code blocks. On /g/ you can share code like so

[code]
paste your code here
[/code]

Feel free to post about what you are working on by sharing code, pics, or [making webms](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/WebM).  The feedback will drive you to keep working! The general is also receptive to in depth conversations on emulation and modding, but you should take questions like "what roms are best?" or "what emulator should I use and how do I configure it?" to [/emugen/](https://boards.4channel.org/vg/emugen).

If you want relevant resources or other additions to the compendium,  ask FroggyGreen !!UYKMqlVW9eC who maintains it. Strong disagreements about the contents of the compendium amongst posters or with Froggy can be handled by holding a vote of what should and shouldn't be present. In the worst case scenario, the markdown file can be easily taken and other posters can branch out with what they think is best.

## Resources and Links

In addition to all the resources listed, you might want to check out the [/agdg/ resource page](https://hackmd.io/dLaaFCjDSveKVeEzqomBJw). Just be warned, anyone can edit that file and the anons of /agdg/ are not afraid of removing links, especially if they think it will be funny. You can also check out the [horsefucker paste](https://ponepaste.org/2348).

## Games and Engines by /gedg/

Make sure to provide some kind of evidence that it was made by a /gedg/ poster. Examples can include any of the following:

* Reference to /gedg/ in the game / engine description.
* Referencing /gedg/ in a README or another kind of doc if the game / engine is open source.
* Linking to posts made during dev. A good archive website for this kind of thing is https://desuarchive.org/.
* Having dev that was posted on /gedg/ that is well known by the posters of /gedg/.

Of course, game jam and Progress Day entries should be added to the list without any fuss. In addition to games and engines you can submit a plethora of tools used for dev like engine plugins, libraries, frameworks, and other tools. Entries that are submitted to /agdg/ events that have also appeared on /gedg/ will still be listed.

## Game Jams and Progress Days

Game jams are held on itch.io. Make sure to read their [terms of service](https://itch.io/docs/legal/terms); posters on /g/ who have become accustomed to posting &#128557; and the [gamer word](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nigger) should tread carefully. 

> Can I use "x" tool to make the game?
Yes.
> Can I use ai?
Do what you want, make the games how you want.

For Progress Day you post your work monthly. Unlike game jams you can work on something old. You can submit a game, engine, tool, etc.

 Submit to itch.io for Progress Day like we do with game jams. The difference is you work on your stuff before the jam officially starts, then submission is open for a couple of days.
