#Satanos rewrite (HEAVY WIP)
@everyone
NOTICE FROM ADMINISTRATORS:
A hack called SATANOS has been spreading around and we'd like to make an official statement on it. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR SHARE DOWNLOAD LINKS. SATANOS contains copious amounts of malware inside and could potentially destroy your PC.
In addition to having graphic violence and gore images inside the files, the game has what appears to be CP. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET ARRESTED FOR DOWNLOADING THIS GAME. 
If you die ingame, the hack will attempt to start printing black pages from any printer it can find connected to the PC. If it can't find any, it will begin to create massive text files to clog your hard drive and waste ram. 
Epilepsy-inducing imagery is common, as well as deafening screamers that could damage your ears among countless other things.
When asked, creator of this hack (who shall remain anonymous) claimed that this was to "make an immersive experience". The majority of his messages were incoherent rambling consisting of variations of "he made me do it" or "it was prophesized".
#PART ONE: gameplay transcript
SATANOS is a quite infamous rom hack that's been a hot point of discussion on the forum. So much so, that users that post the rom are often banned due to the copious malware that the game hosts. I'm well aware of the risks present when playing this hack, so as a precaution I'll be using a virtual machine to quarantine the game's file from the rest of my computer. 
If you are foolhardy enough to try and conquer this hack, heed my warnings.
Whatever you do, DO NOT let Satanos gain administrator access. This game will stop at NOTHING to brute-force its way into admin privileges, running dozens of programs in the background while you play.
If Satanos manages to break its way through your firewall, it'll make sure you know. The game is quite temperamental, and punishes you if you don't play by its rules. 
No area in this game will spare you. It is an exceptionally difficult hack, and takes every opportunity it has to make the player miserable. This confrontational nature is far from limited to level design; offensive and graphic content is littered throughout, up to and including real gore videos.
Don't believe me? I have written a transcript of my playthrough of this godforsaken piece of shit.
Booting up the game greets you with a black screen for around 30 seconds before loading you into the game. No title, credits, or anything like that.
After that anticlimactic opening, I immediately noticed several things:
First of all, the layout for Emerald Hill was completely different, with spikes scattered everywhere and crudely-drawn blood coating the entire stage.
Secondly, Sonic's sprite had been given the same treatment as the rest of the stage. His eyes were bright pink with specks of red around the edges, giving him the appearance of a crackhead. The fingers on his gloves were drenched in blood, and on his chest was a huge clump of blood that looked vaguely pentagram-shaped.
Third of all, the regular music for Emerald Hill was replaced with horribly compressed audio that sounded like a crude attempt at making a Linkin Park song using a Genesis sound font. 
As I began to move around my crackhead sonic, what became apparent quickly was the amateur level design. The very first slope of the level had crudely-placed spikes at the peak, which required a spindash. Doing so, however, would propel crackhead Sonic into a yellow spring that would bounce right back into the trap.
Even before that, every single tree had one of those coconut monkey badniks on them, all with what looked to be blackface on. That's just great -_-

After a bit of experimentation, I figured out that I could use the coconut monkeys to bounce on top of the spring platform, giving me a ledge to jump from. 
In the base game, Emerald Hill has underground segments with spikes that'll come out of the floor on a timer. Turns out, these were placed everywhere in random spots, meaning that all flat surfaces were essentially minefields. 
I learned this rather quickly when the ledge I was standing on suddenly shot out spikes that knocked me forwards, landing where there was supposed to be a bridge. Instead, a large pit was put in its place. 
Another death, another attempt. 
Interestingly, the game didn't appear to have a limited amount of lives, instead a small red skull with a counter next to it. 

After maneuvering myself across the chasm, I managed to finally find a safe area to rest and think about my next move. Ahead of me were several small pits, between them being grassy platforms with visible spike traps on them, meaning that I'd have to spend as little time on them as possible. 
While waiting, a large tab appeared at the bottom of the screen with a portrait of the crackhead sonic sporting a demented, toothless grin. 

"RACIAL CLEANSING  BEST SELER 1977 HAIL SATAN"

Not sure what to make of that, I continued my playthrough with mild difficulty. 
Little did I know, the most irritating segment was yet to come. After a minute of traversing shitty spike pits and enemies retextured to resemble racial stereotypes, I found a pair of red springs with visible spikes above them. Ahead of them was a massive wall blocking my path. Seeing no other option but to change my position midair somehow, I loaded a save state using a cheat engine I managed to attach to the game. 

"BUGS IN YOUR SKIN HAVING SEX
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE NEVER HAPPENED"

While I won't detail the dozens of failed attempts at pulling off this trick, I noticed that every time I loaded a save state, the crackhead sonic who I assumed was named Satanos would keep spouting racist and schizophrenic nonsense in the dialogue box.

"CUT YUOR HEADS OFF; AND LEAVE YOU MOTHRFUCKERS DEAD"

"UPON THE SUN THE FALL OF HEAVEN THE FATHERS SON IS JUST A HEATHEN"

"ANGUISH    SEARING PAIN"

"NIGGERS TOUNGE MY ANUS"

Eventually I managed to launch myself onto the top of the cliffside, and made a savestate. The top of the cliff was a long stretch leading to a diagonal spring that launched me into a spiked wall. Figuring this to be close to the end, I continued to fling myself at it over and over to no avail.

No matter how hard I tried, the final stretch of the level was impossible. I'd build up momentum, run onto the spring, and then faceplant into the spiked wall. There was only one opening, and it was lower than I could reach without crossing another field of spikes along the way, and I couldn't just lower my momentum in the air. 

With seemingly no other options, I opened the cheat engine and enabled Super Sonic without all seven emeralds collected. Restarting the level with a newfound confidence, I avoided most of the cheap traps and unfair enemy positions and collected the rings necessary. 

An unexpected challenge came in making my way to the peak without jumping so that I can get the most time possible as Super Sonic. I was able to make it up halfway before needing to enter Super Sonic, with only 43 seconds to pull off the necessary platforming to get past the wall.
Now comes the leap of faith. I jumped forward, sprinting across the bloodied metal spikes as fast as I could. Above me was a small fleet of buzzer enemies, shooting at me to no avail. 

20 seconds left.

Using the badniks as springs, I bounced from one to the next until I managed to thread the needle and penetrate the one gap in the wall. Lodged between the barbed defenses was a short slope with the goal sign at the end. 

Victory was mine at last. 

"NO."

The usual "SONIC HAS PASSED ACT 1" text was gone, and before I could question it, more and more flooded the screen.

"NO NO NO NO NO"

"YOU CHEATING FAGGOT"

That's rude. 
Was this game throwing a fucking temper tantrum at me? 

It tried opening pop-up ads that were quickly closed by my adblocker as it threw everything it could at me. I could only see the filenames of the media attached before it was swiftly deleted, mostly along the lines of "funkytown.mp4" or other notorious gore videos. 

"CHEATER CHEATER CHEATER"

I was practically pissing myself laughing. I beat this game, and it was acting like a toddler. The screen kept rapidly flashing in what I could only assume was a failed attempt to give me a seizure, accompanied by heavily bitcrushed audio of a man screaming racial slurs.

After about two minutes of this ordeal, the game was able to crash itself on me. I'm probably going to take a break for now, and wait to see what more SATANOS has in store for me.
