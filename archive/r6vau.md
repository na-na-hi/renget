#Palantir - The Sword of Western Intelligence
![](https://telegra.ph/file/6af5641f44dd7f993d665.png)
When we talk about Western and, in particular, American intelligence, we should not think of the James Bond movies or the CIA or MI6, but first and foremost of the company at the forefront of the invisible struggle for American interests around the world: Palantir.

Officially, it is "a software company that enables organizations to effectively integrate their data, solutions, and operations." The description is extremely vague, but essentially it is a software company that develops software to meet the needs and interests of U.S. intelligence and military, and it works for organizations [such as the FBI, CIA, MI6, and Interpol](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement). The company is also a staunch apologist for the New World Order (NWO), as it, among other things, develops software capable of [tracking individuals by their face, "and they don't even need your permission to do it"](https://thenextweb.com/news/facial-recognition-company-ceo-says-he-doesnt-need-permission-to-use-your-face). Naturally, in addition to the organizations listed above, this company also works with over 600 law enforcement agencies. The link above has information on this.

What a dynamic introduction. Let us now examine in detail the activities of this organization and the products it makes, and how particular products help in achieving the openly declared goals of both this organization and those it helps.
####Roots of the organization
Palantir was founded on an investment by CIA venture capital firm In-Q-Tel, whose senior partner sits on the board of Metabiota, a company that has played a central role in all anti-fraud operations, from developing COVID in the CPC lab to advising UN WHO policy. [It's described in more detail here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/?sh=40ebefcd7785). The company itself is referred to in the article as nothing more, but nothing less, than a "data-mining juggernaut." Palantir is also directly connected to the Manhattan Institute, which was founded by William Casey, director of the CIA, and Anthony Fisher, founder of free-market think tanks such as Atlas Network and the Institute of Economic Affairs ("Britain's most influential think tank"). Fisher was also associated with the Fabian Society's London School of Economics. In the future, they will directly sponsor the [Clearview AI](https://www.clearview.ai/) project and involve their experts in its creation.

*Clearview AI interface from the presentation*
Palantir lives by the realities of its - without exaggeration - extremely influential clients: the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA - first investors through the In-Q-Tel venture capital fund - along with an alphabet hodgepodge of other U.S. counterterrorism and military agencies. Over the past five years, Palantir has become the leading company in mining vast amounts of data for intelligence and law enforcement applications. It has a nifty software interface and coders who instantly set up their programs at client headquarters. Palantir turns "messy swamps of information" into intuitive mind maps, bar charts and link diagrams. So-called "overdrawn engineers" only need to be given a few days to review, tag, and integrate every scrap of client data, and Palantir can clarify issues as diverse as terrorism, disaster relief, and human trafficking.
####Clearview AI and PayPal
Since we started with NWO and facial recognition technologies, let's talk about that. This software works by collecting photos en masse from public social networks, including Russian ones. Clearview AI is funded by Peter Thiel, who was Facebook's first outside investor and co-founder of PayPal. He is also the co-founder of Palantir, an artificial intelligence corporation used by U.S. intelligence agencies and the Defense Department. According to General Mattis, "[Palantir] has developed revolutionary technologies that help us make better decisions in war zones. You're giving us the advantages we need right now." [Source: Palantir website.] 

[Thiel also financed Moldbug / Curtis Jarwin's cryptocurrency startup "Tlon"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html). Jarvin is also known as the actual founder of the neo-reaction or "dark enlightenment" ideology, with his father being "in foreign service", presumably at the CIA. It is also amusing that in 2020/2021 there was a flurry of references to this very dark enlightenment in the English segment of the Internet by the "far right", who also said that "there is no global conspiracy".

This money was then used to fund Clearview AI. Also, according to Time magazine, Clearview was also co-founded secretly by "far-right" activist Chuck Johnson, an associate of Moldbug, who also founded a bunch of crowdfunding sites to raise money for people like Richard Spencer and Tommy Robinson. And also another Clearview man and Thiel associate, Jeff Giesea, advised people to fund alt-right organizations with PayPal in 2016. PayPal (again, founded by Thiel) is now officially partnering with ADL and using private user transaction data to map "hate networks" and identify wrong-thinking people. "The information gathered through this research initiative will be widely shared across the financial industry as well as with politicians and law enforcement." According to "former white supremacist" Cathy McHugh, who was "in the right place at the right time" to witness and report on many of the machinations of alt-right - Johnson said Clearview's goal is to "identify every illegal alien in the country." Here's a quote:

>"He told me they had a way to identify every illegal alien in the country [...] He mentioned facial recognition technology and demanded that I call Stephen Miller because he knew Stephen Miller sincerely believed in it."- McHugh

But Clearview also employed various "racists" and "anti-Semites". For example, Ricky Vaughn, aka Douglas Mackie, was a contract consultant for Clearview. He advertised the tool to Paul Nelen, who allegedly planned to use it to "research the opposition" (in fact, to spy on it). Clearview allegedly fired Ricky after he was doxed by Nelen because of a disagreement over Clearview (Nelen claimed that Vaughn had not provided the promised services).

In essence, we can say, albeit somewhat speculatively, that U.S. intelligence agencies are behind the origins of the concept of cryptocurrencies. We will understand even better in the future the purposes for which it was done, in addition to those described above.

####Financial Intelligence
Do I even need to mention - or is it obvious - that everything written is directly related to the recent news about a [certain U.S. financial surveillance system that covers more than 20 countries?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/little-known-surveillance-program-captures-money-transfers-between-u-s-and-more-than-20-countries-11674019904)

Hundreds of U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies have access, without court oversight, to a database of more than 150 million remittances between people in the United States and in more than 20 countries, according to internal program documents and an investigation by Senator Ron Wyden. The program covers data for numerous Caribbean and Latin American countries in addition to Canada, China, France, Malaysia, Spain, Thailand, Ukraine and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Some domestic translations are also part of the dataset.

The database, hosted by a little-known nonprofit called the Transaction Record Analysis Center (TRAC), was created by the Arizona State Attorney's Office in 2014 as part of a settlement agreement struck with Western Union to combat cross-border drug and human trafficking from Mexico. Since then, it has expanded to allow officers from **more than 600 law enforcement agencies** (what a coincidence!) - from federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to small-town police departments in almost every state - to track the movement of funds through money services between the United States and countries around the world.

![](https://telegra.ph/file/de803324ec81d4f6ce697.png)
*TRAC director on Linkedin looking for staff*

TRAC data includes the full names of the sender and recipient, as well as the amount of the transaction. Rich Lebel, director of TRAC, said the program has led to hundreds of leads and solved hundreds of crimes involving drug cartels and other criminals seeking to launder money, as well as identified money flow patterns that help law enforcement gain a better understanding of smuggling networks. 

"It's a tool for law enforcement investigations," Mr. Lebel said. "We're not broadcasting it to the world, but we're not running from it or hiding from it either." Mr. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said TRAC allows the government to "serve itself a smorgasbord of Americans' personal financial data, bypassing normal protections for Americans' privacy."

Internal records, including TRAC meeting minutes and copies of 140 subpoenas from Arizona's attorney general, were obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union and studied by The Wall Street Journal. They show that any authorized law enforcement agency can request data without a warrant to examine people's transactions inside the United States for money laundering and other crimes. One of the slides, prepared by a TRAC investigator, shows how the program's data can be used to scan categories such as "Middle Eastern/Arabic names" in mass transaction records.

We have no doubt that Palantir is directly implicated in the architecture of this financial surveillance system. Specifically, it can help map financial flows, chart financial flows, create criteria for blocking financial transfers, and test them with the application of impressive statistics. Cyber detectives are busy catching far-right radicals based not only on Palantir, but also on this financial surveillance system. There is also no doubt that this system was in full operation during the BLM pogroms of 2020, controlling the sponsorship of black terrorists. Given that we know only about 10% of the activities of this system from open sources, these assumptions seem to us to be facts, not assumptions at all.

####Fighting far-right radicalism
We learned a lot about this from the first paragraph about Clearview, but let's paint the picture to the end, completing the details, and give the floor to people directly connected to Palantir.

"You'd have a far-right government in every country in Europe if it weren't for us," reads a catchy headline in a Swedish newspaper. [We provide a link to the article.](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/ai-kan-ge-ett-overtag-i-kriget) Swedish state television was in Davos, and they took the opportunity to interview Alex Karp, the head of technology company Palantir. Not in code, not even trying to hide it.

What did he say there? A lot. Palantir has developed artificial intelligence technology for U.S. intelligence agencies, and now it's working with the Ukrainian military to counter the Russian invasion. We'll talk about that as well, but now about something else. What's more interesting is COVID. After the obligatory COVID inoculation, he tells the reporter about one of his AI products:

>"This product has stopped major terrorist attacks several times a year... And I believe... I am most proud of the fact that... if these attacks had happened, every country in Europe would have had a far-right government... and especially in [the Scandinavian countries]."

Apparently, what Karp is saying is that migrants would cause so many terrorist attacks that every country in Europe would elect a "far-right" government to end this madness.

And in fact, what other conclusions can be drawn from these words?

1) Mass immigration is such a bad idea that you need the latest AI technology to prevent a civil war. (And even with that technology, mass immigration is destroying Europe.) What's our MVD saying, "We' can't get away from this"? We're certainly not getting away from it.

2) The right answer is to elect "far-right" governments to end the problem. In fact, that is exactly what people would do if not for artificial intelligence technology and the genocide of whites in Europe by the army and police.

3) What does this say about European "democracy"? European countries need to elect far-right governments, but the ruling class uses the latest AI technology and repressive apparatus to prevent this from happening. 

Interesting conclusions that follow directly from Karp's words. 

####Political lobbying
This story will be quite old, from as far back as 2011-2013, but it shows the capabilities and ambitions of this organization.

Palantir once resorted to traditional tactics to bolster its position in Washington. In 2011, it spent about $300,000 on wall-to-wall ads in subway stations, including L'Enfant Plaza and Pentagon. It was probably the first exposure thousands of Washingtonians had to the shady company. During the last election cycle, Palantir employees donated more than $92,000 to election campaigns, a record for the company.

Palantir has also stepped up its lobbying efforts. Last year (as of 2011, that is, 2010), when the company was trying to gain access to an important Army program in Afghanistan, at least half a dozen members of Congress stepped in and tried to pressure the military to give Palantir a chance. The Army resisted and gave the contract to its main competitor. But the fact that Palantir was able to convince lawmakers so effectively shows that it has learned to play hardball in Washington.

As of 2013, Palantir was used by at least 12 groups in the U.S. government, including the CIA, DHS, NSA, FBI, CDC, Marine Corps, Air Force, Special Operations Command, West Point, Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, and National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services planned to pilot test the use of Palantir in 2013 to investigate hotline reports. A second test was conducted by the same organization to identify potentially fraudulent health care providers in the southern region of the United States.

As of 2013, however, not all units of the armed forces were using Palantir. The U.S. Army has developed its own $2.3 billion data analysis tool called the Distributed Common Ground System, but it's not believed to be very popular. The leaked document cites a 2012 study in which 96 percent of fighters surveyed in Afghanistan recommended Palantir.

The U.S. military has used Palantir with great success. The Pentagon has used its software to track patterns in roadside bombs and was able to conclude, for example, that garage door openers have been used as remote detonators. With Palantir, the Marines have been able then and can now download DNA samples from remote locations and use the information gathered over the years to collect fingerprints and DNA. The results come back almost instantly. Without Palantir, suspects would have already moved elsewhere by the time agents got the results.

As of 2012, some current and former government officials say Palantir's star has faded in the intelligence community. They complain that the software struggles to analyze very large databases and that it takes a long time upfront to put the information into a format that Palantir can use. 

Now all of these disadvantages were completely offset. The year is 2023.

####Helping Ukraine and the Ukrainian Armed Forces
>Two Ukrainian military officers peer at a laptop computer operated by a Ukrainian technician using software provided by the American technology company Palantir. On the screen are detailed digital maps of the battlefield at Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, overlaid with other targeting intelligence — most of it obtained from commercial satellites. As we lean closer, we see can jagged trenches on the Bakhmut front, where Russian and Ukrainian forces are separated by a few hundred yards in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. A click of the computer mouse displays thermal images of Russian and Ukrainian artillery fire; another click shows a Russian tank marked with a “Z”, seen through a picket fence, an image uploaded by a Ukrainian spy on the ground. If this were a working combat operations center, rather than a demonstration for a visiting journalist, the Ukrainian officers could use a targeting program to select a missile, artillery piece or armed drone to attack the Russian positions displayed on the screen. Then drones could confirm the strike, and a damage assessment would be fed back into the system. This is the “wizard war” in the Ukraine conflict — a secret digital campaign that has never been reported before in detail — and it’s a big reason David is beating Goliath here. The Ukrainians are fusing their courageous fighting spirit with the most advanced intelligence and battle-management software ever seen in combat.
![](https://telegra.ph/file/cd948803f560167c6b43c.png)
*A cockhole with palantir*
Thus begins an [article devoted to Palantir's assistance to Ukrainian soldiers](https://www.almendron.com/tribuna/how-the-algorithm-tipped-the-balance-in-ukraine/). At first the Ukrainians refrained from the services of this company "because it is too strongly connected to the American government and they might see something confidential," but then they were forced to use their services. 
>Karp responded to criticism of the company in an email to me last week: “Silicon Valley screaming at us for over a decade did not make the world any less dangerous. We built software products that made America and its allies stronger — and we are proud of that”.
>And Ukraine has shifted the political landscape in Silicon Valley. For Karp and many other technology CEOs, this is “the good war” that has led many companies to use their tools aggressively. This public-private partnership is one of the keys to Ukraine’s success. But it obscures many important questions: How dependent should countries be on entrepreneurs whose policy views could change? We can applaud the use of these tools in “good” wars, but what about bad ones? And what about private tools being turned against the governments that helped create them?
As we can see, American intelligence is not at all worried about openly interfering in the political affairs of other countries, especially in the war against Russia. A digital war.

This is algorithmic warfare, as Karp says. Using a digital model of the battlefield, commanders can penetrate the proverbial "fog of war." Using artificial intelligence to analyze sensor data, NATO advisers outside Ukraine can quickly answer basic questions of battle: Where are the allied forces? Where is the enemy? What weapons will be most effective against enemy positions? They can then relay accurate information about the enemy's location to Ukrainian commanders on the ground. And after action, they can assess how accurate their intelligence was and update the system.
![](https://telegra.ph/file/8ef9c1e2fab2184c8c4dd.png)
*A leaked part of Palantir's interface*
Data feeds this new war engine - and the system is constantly updated. After each kinetic strike, battle damage estimates are fed back into the digital network to bolster prediction models. This is not an automated battlefield, and it still has layers and stovepipes. The system uses a limited set of sensors and artificial intelligence tools, some of which have been developed by Ukraine, in part because of classification limitations. A larger external system can process highly classified data securely, with cybersecurity and limited access, and then transmit enemy location data to ukraine for action.

To imagine how this works in practice, recall Ukraine's recent success in capturing Kherson. The Ukrainians had accurate intelligence on where Russian Armed Forces units were moving and the ability to deliver an accurate long-range fire strike from HIMARS. This was made possible because they had intelligence on the enemy's location, processed by NATO outside the country and then passed on to commanders on the ground. Armed with this information, the Ukrainians could go on the offensive - moving, communicating, and quickly adapting to Russian defensive maneuvers and counterattacks.

In our Kherson example, Palantir estimates that about 40 commercial satellites would pass over the territory within 24 hours. Palantir normally uses less than a dozen commercial satellites, but it can extend that range to acquire images from 306 commercial satellites capable of focusing up to 3.3 meters. Soldiers in combat can use handheld tablets to request more coverage if they need it. According to a British official, Western military and intelligence services are working closely with Ukrainians in the field to facilitate this information sharing. The last important link in this system, however, is the broadband communications provided from above by a network of some 2,500 Starlink satellites in low earth orbit. This system, owned by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, allows Ukrainian soldiers who want to download intelligence or download targeting information to do so quickly.
####Palantir Methodology
"Okay," you think, "this is a genius corporation that knows everything about everyone and everywhere at any given time, but how exactly do they do this? Perhaps if we can't find out about specific tools, there's some methodology?" Of course there is, and it is known to us. 

Palantir specializes in **analysis**. Nowadays, it's very easy to slap a proud label on yourself as an analyst and sincerely think afterwards that you're something serious. But at Palantir, **analytics** means very concrete and substantive things, namely creating a software platform that allows people to take any data that matters to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before, using concepts they already understand. And they're applying that vision at first to solve problems in the financial sector and the government intelligence community. And then, of course, in the armies of their "allied" countries. But they don't do the analysis themselves. They do not develop winning trading strategies or catch terrorists. They write software for people who perform these and many other feats. And those people are the ones who are called analysts.

So what is analysis? So, **analysis** is all about extracting insight from information. Let's clarify this definition. 

It's pretty easy with information: it's data. It's stored in a relational or any other database or as files and you can easily query it. It comes in two kinds - structured and unstructured. And there's a lot of it in today's world-even too much for existing tools to comprehend.

It's more complicated with insight. Insight is something that only humans can generate (so far), and realizing this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis properly. Thus, the problem with data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human (or, in the future, artificial) intelligence. In other words, the challenge is how to get the analyst to work productively, to "turn on" the analyst.

From the analyst's perspective, there are five main characteristics of an analytics platform:
1. First, and most importantly, the analyst must keep the tool under control. In other words, the main way to interact with the analysis tool should be human-driven queries. Although automated approaches can complement the human approach, there is no substitute for human intelligence. Unless you put a human at the helm, the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original ideas. Artificial intelligence just hasn't reached that level. Yet.

2. The ability to generalize large amounts of data. This is partly what is traditionally called data mining: a largely automated approach -- using machine learning or other statistical techniques -- to process large amounts of data simultaneously and extract the nuggets that reflect something interesting in the data. Unlike Palantir, traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis.

3. The ability to visualize large data sets. Here the analyst needs interesting and informative ways to graphically represent data to make it easier to see. The analyst doesn't just want a summary of the data, but a nuanced look at what's going on within those data sets: What is the overall shape of the distribution? What are the outliers? What are the important structures in the data? Which of these matters more and which matters less? Maybe some of it is useless at all? And so on.

4. The ability to iterate quickly. This means that the analyst can ask a question, get an answer, and then quickly ask either a variant of the original question or a follow-up question that depends on the answer to the original question. This rapid iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test hypotheses and develop theories about what is happening in the data, and thus learn what is happening in the world.

5. Ability to collaborate with other analysts. Working with terabytes of data, especially if it includes multiple types of data, is not just a one-person job. Any organization serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts who can work together as more than just the sum of the parts. This requires that one analyst can easily share the results of his or her analysis with colleagues.
This is what analysis looks like for the analyst, or rather, this is what it should look like in an ideal world. So what exactly is Palantir doing to subordinate analysis to this vision?

Probably the most difficult problem they tackle is data modeling-the process of figuring out what types of data are relevant to the domain, determining what they represent in the world, and deciding how to represent them in the system. They make sure that the data model (ontology) is flexible and dynamic, and that it reflects the concepts that people naturally use when reasoning about a domain. This is not an easy task because it touches the very foundations of human thinking, but Palantir handles it. In finance, their basic types of data include financial instruments, dates, portfolios, indices and strategies - the same things that financial researchers or market tinkerers think, talk and reason about. In the intelligence field, their main types of data include people, places, and events (all with their respective properties), which is exactly how we all imagine the world in our minds.

Data modeling, data summarization, and data visualization are core disciplines for dealing with large data sets. Human-driven queries, fast iterations, and collaboration are multipliers that take the capabilities unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level. When all these pieces come together as a coherent system, the result is an analytics platform that is both very general and very powerful.


That's what Palantir has in mind when they say they're changing the way people approach data. And if you consider the current capabilities and perspectives of neural networks, the perspectives of this organization are also clear. Frighteningly clear. 


Welcome to the future of analysis. Welcome to a new world.
