#Avian Assessments

##S-Rank
>Inatsu Hikuhei, "The Bull of Konoha"
Y: "He has honored the agreement made between the Tengu and the previous Hokage and earned the recognition of my elders, so I have no cause to feel anything but the utmost respect. Though, I would like to see Lord Inatsu's capabilities during wartime with my own eyes."

A: "Nothing more to say? Does even your swollen pride have its limits, master? Well, what if I told you that the old man is looking for a successor?"

Y: "...There is no one currently worthy of the position."

>Akuryoga Mitiru, "The Old Demon"
Y: "I would think him nothing more than a rumor if I had not been told of how he struck down Lord Second. He's a savage even when compared to other shinobi, and fate was too kind to let him die before I could take his head myself."

A: "Such passion for a man you've never met."

Y: "It's only natural. Why should an enemy be forgotten?"

A: "Poor child. Still so young, and yet you'd even make a ghost your enemy before allowing yourself a friend."

>Yusuke Hiramatsu, "The Third Kazekage"
A: "Did you know that Suna underwent a civil war not so long ago? A rather bloody affair."

Y: "It is no concern of mine who leads Sunagakure. If the Land of Wind's daimyō is unsatisfied with them, he will make his grievances known, and they shall be dealt with accordingly."

##A-Rank
>Taiki, "The Trunk Thrower"
Y: "His strength may be impressive, but he is...lacking. I would find him holding the title of Jonin insulting if I cared for how shinobi classify themselves. That he has been entrusted with a team is nothing short of a tragedy. Still, he is a better choice than *her*."

"Ah, but wouldn't you say he is quite honest then? Even if only because he lacks the wit for clever thought."

>Konna, "The Shady Foreigner"
Y: "This Bingo Book is truly extraordinary. Though, I don't know why such a shady character would allowed within Konoha's bounds in the first place. We should watch him closely."

A: "And what if he catches you? I think it would be hard not to notice such a stern little girl following me."

Y: "Hmph. Then, the cheeky bird can watch him on her own. I'm sure he'll only roast you if he hears you bellowing."

A: "How cruel..."

>Mika Katsumi, "Opioid Smoke Girl"
Y: "I cannot fathom why anyone would trust this woman with their health."

>Hakumo Ikari, "Kitsune Vixen"
Y: "A kunoichi. The worst of them."

A: "You had so much more to say when you happened across some of your clanmates wandering near one of the Hakumo's dens. Do you no longer wish to burn them to the ground and see the foxes skinned?"

Y: "There is nothing more to say about a group who revels in their weakness and vice. If *I* had led the Tengu all those years ago, their presence alone would have made Konoha intolerable."

>Kurumi Yamagumo, "Prideful Puppeteer"
Y: "Her puppetry is marvelous. I'm not one to brag-"

A: "Are we talking about my master?"

Y: "...but doubt any but the Tengu can appreciate her work to its full extent. The sight of the threads dancing with each minute movement is as impressive as the plays themselves. Lady Kurumi is regretfully rather slothful outside of these shows, however."

A: "You're my master, after all. I was worried you wouldn't find something to criticize."

>Amami Kai, "The Tide"
A: "You must take a mission that sends us to Yashino again."

Y: "So that you may treat the treat the monk as a meal ticket. I think not. Catch your own fish if you desire it."

>Mutsuo Aburame "Bug Guy"
Y: "His abilities and dedication are admirable, but to think that mere insects should be more renowned than the eyes of the Tengu? Foolishness."

A: "And what of his bugs? Will you treat me coldly if I snack on them?"

Y: "I'm sure he'll be glad to know he has your support, but I'll have no part in it. If you wish to feast on larvae and beetles, then you do not need the snacks I provide! My purse will grow a bit heavier, thanks to you."

A: "How unkind! I just thought I might not inconvenience you, but I underestimated my master's jealousy."

>Goro Tsuchigumo, "Snare Spider"
Y: "Strangely, one of the few reliable Jonin. It's a shame that he doesn't use a bow. Can you imagine the strength with which he could draw it?"

A: "Stronger than a Tengu?"

Y: "Of course not."

##B-Rank
>Ray Sisuto, "Bloodline Actor"
Y: "Bloodline mimicry? It's little better than theft. Yet, It would be unwise to ignore the genius it must take to create even pale imitations. It is not doubt displeasing, but it will be even more so to the foe who finds himself facing the shadow of many clans at once."

##C-Rank
>Nara Suzura, "Cowardly Dragon Host"
A: "I think you and her would get along rather well, master."

Y: "I am nothing like a shinobi."

A: "Oh? But you both try so hard to act as callous and unpersonable as you can. I'm sure you'll have lots to bond over as you silently stare each other down"

>Oscar, "The Outlander"
Y: "I wouldn't be surprised if he was a scout. As soon he's taken stock of us, he'll sail off back across the sea to tell his kin how best to conquer us."

A: "Must you be so suspicious?"

Y: "It's caution, and it keeps a warrior alive. If it were up to me, he would have already been driven back."

A: "If it were up to you, Konoha would declare war on the world in the name of caution."

>Kambara Soue, "Frosty Kunoichi"
Y: "Her kenjutsu abilities deserve some recognition, but make no mistake — I will best her."

A: "She's such a sweet girl. I wonder if she even realizes she has a rival."

Y: "If she is incapable of recognizing the enemy, then she's already lost."

A: "Perfect. There'll be no need for your silly duel then."

##D-Rank
>Takatsui Inukasai, "The Infernal Painter"
Y: "The arts should revered, but he is little more than a petulant child who doesn't realize his limits."

A: "I didn't realize you could be so critical of yourself, master.

Y: "Hmph. At least that octopus of his doesn't talk."

>Eisei Hokan, "Timid Grinner"
Y: "I must question the wisdom in allowing powerful tools in the hands of the inexperienced. They will become too reliant on their weapon's abilities and forget to hone their own.

A: "Perhaps, but growing alongside their tools is what allows them such mastery. I'm sure you'd prefer to be training with that gaudy old bow."

Y: "It would be an honor, but I have no need. I can say that my skills are my own."

>Kazuo, "The Unarmed"
A: "Such a sad sight. It's a wonder that he continues on."

Y: "What he requires is not sympathy, but discipline. Luckily he has time to learn some before he can become a danger."

!!! Info Slices of Life
Y: "His direct way of dealing with situations is praiseworthy."

A: I must say that the boy has a *familiar* way of doing things. Tsuchigumo may disagree, but I think he handled that dirty old man quite well."

Y: "Indeed. My only fear is that his honesty of action will be unlearned. It may be best to have one of my cousins teach him the way of the sword."

A: "Oh, how easily you change your tune! Were you not speaking callously of poor Kazuo but a week ago?"

Y: "And my thoughts have not shifted. I simply see now that the discipline he needs cannot be found in a shinobi."

>Sarurata, "The Retarded Orphan"
Y: "He should consider himself lucky that the Academy is even willing to teach him.

>Zeiji Gorobuyo, "Toad Nemesis"
A: "He may find some companionship with Mitsuo."

Y: "Allies will do little good if he cannot eliminate his weakness."

A: "I see, I see. My master has no time for friends because she's eliminating weakness, is it?"

>Kenzo Nakamura, "Gluttonous Dragon"
Y: "A glutton, but a talented one. I must admit that I have habit of patronizing the food stall he works at."

A: "And how thankful I am, master~!" I really didn't think you could eat so much, though."

*Yumiko glares at Asaya as her cheeks burn a bright pink.*

Y: "Ahem. A warrior must keep up their strength, and I do not criticize *your* appetite."
