!!!note World Lore (as far as I know)
	[World Map](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1668/49/1668491021458121.jpg)
		[Haven Area](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1668/63/1668637361105016.png)
	[God Lore](https://controlc.com/21bfaebe)
	Set in PMD:EOS Dark Future, which means:
		-The Temporal Tower is broken, causing time to freeze and Dialga to go into a permanent fight or flight mentality, doing anything he can to prevent his current state being messed with, such as stopping the tower's collapse in the past
			-Time being frozen means everything is dark and bleak, nothing moves outside of pokemon, and most pokemon are hostile and gloomy, travelers must beware chaotic distortions in time that could slow them to a crawl or age them rapidly
		-All attempts made to fix the past have failed and likely have been given up
		-Darkrai likes the world of eternal darkness he made, and would like to keep it that way
	Currently revolves around Eon Town/Sanctuary, a safe haven created by Aeona via Legendary Bullshit.
	Essentially all pokemon can subsist on berries and other crops, not requiring meat (from weaker non-thinking/speaking pokemon) although that is socially acceptable to consume. Some pokemon have more esoteric diets, such as sunlight or the souls of the damned.
	-Due to the frozen time effect of the Dark Future, growing food crops is extremely difficult: nearly impossible outside the area of Eon Town or without certain types of poekmon. Because of this, food is essentially a matter of every mon for themselves: eat, or be eaten with few exceptions.

Timeline up to Story Start: (approximate, no specific amount of time between events)
>time is frozen
>hyginus gets kicked off a mountain (by rayquaza)
>hyginus finds a new town to settle around a prophecy site
>aeona gets isekai'd and unstops time around town

###Mysteries
Name | Synopsis
:-: | :-:
The Mountain of Maize | An ancient shrine dedicated to a god of grain and harvest rests atop Mt. Maize, just beyond the edge of the Eon Town haven. The spirit that dwells within is the source of many stories and has a fickle reputation. A group of rookie explorers, the Pawniard Rangers, have gone missing. Now a band of explorers climbs the mount to find them.
Rise of the Machines | During a routine exploration of the city ruins on the southern cape of the continent, Tolltaker accidentally awakens slumbering machines like simulacra of Pokemon inside of an ancient laboratory. Each machine is as hostile as a wild Pokemon, but smarter and working in perfect unison with the rest. They now scrounge every piece of scrap and electronics in the city to restore their facility. And if our worst fears are true, they could be building more of themselves.
Famine | Torterra has found that the latest crop has been growing in poorly. Plantlife is suffering from a curse or illness and it's only spreading further, placing Eon Town and those settlements surrounding the haven under a worsening food shortage. Investigations begin to find the source of this blight and restore the supply before the last bastion of peace succumbs to desperate infighting.
