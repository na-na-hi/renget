/lttg/ is a general determined to discussing our favourite YouTube e-celeb, Linus Sebastian and his crew, the Linus Media Group (in a friendly way).

>General Information
Linus Sebastian is a 36 year old YouTuber, who formerly worked with NCIX, a now bankrupt computer company. 
>Channel History
Back in the early 2010s, NCIX had discovered that one can use YouTube, a relatively small platform at the time, to advertise for the company. After being assigned leader of the NCIX Tech Tips YouTube Channel and regularly making videos, he created Linus Tech Tips as an alternative to the main channel, where he could upload whatever without having to worry about the quality of said videos. The channel quickly gained subscribers and after a legal battle with the NCIX owner, he got all rights to LTT. As production quality got better, the channel only grew more and more. 

LTT reached a milestone of 10,000,000 subscribers in 2020.
