##Subject A24 - Sith Warrior Grok Ko'Garr

**Target Analysis A24 - Version 81**
**Subject Identity:** Sith Warrior Grok Ko'Garr - Codename 'Hunter'
**Subject Value:** A
**Subject Validity:** N/A
**Last Update:** 13 - 30 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
It gives me no pleasure to continue wasting my resources on this creature - the Hunter is a Sith Warrior under former tutorship of the fallen Lord Skyr, shortly taken up as the attack dog of Lord Fernal, who has commissioned much of this research out of likely some unjustified sense of paranoia. Were he even on my list of potential subjects, I might note his impressive form and severe connection to the Force, but I could make the same observation of any Sith amongst our ranks without spending agents to do so. Still, here we are.

**Phase 1 - Identification**
It goes without saying, but we have accurate records of more of the Hunter's life than we have gaps - particularly during his early years before he was considered viable for independent operation. Multiple databases of medical data from the droids Fernal has working on him have also been corroborated with my own observations from his younger years and I find myself once again asking if there is anything new here. To give at least some credit for my work, I have verified that the Hunter is an almost complete unknown to the galaxy still, and Dossier A24-1 may yet be the most comprehensive analysis of the subject to date.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
Naturally hunting the subject has not even commenced, nor do I necessarily believe it ever will, but a hypothetical has been arranged through analysis of the Hunter's capabilities recorded so far. With an almost nonexisant understanding of social tact the subject will inevitably leave a trail of evidence to follow - actual tracking would be surprisingly more difficult - like a reptilian ambush predator the subject has shown a great skill, talent and desire to remaining unseen before he strikes, something that has been observed on many occasions within our training simulations pitting him against the other Sith Apprentices. This proclivity I feel will only heighten as the subject is forced into more unfamiliar environments, rendering them far more difficult to locate than one might otherwise presume.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
The Hunter shows an admittedly remarkable restraint in leveraging his superior physique in combat - instead opting to utilize an array of sophisticated Force-powers to cripple, corner and dismantle enemies, relying only on his more aggressive instincts when his caution is sated by the opponent's incapacitation or, more rarely, goaded into a false sense of security. To this end like almost all Sith he is a far greater threat in direct conflict than the Jedi, but worse still may possess a certain strength of fear that prevents him from being too predictable like many of our Warriors. The Cabal simply lacks the means to capture such a target, and Fernal will have to waste his own forces if his pet ever slips the shackles - enough of my time has been wasted compiling this ode to an obsession with control.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; continued apathy. The Hunter shows little care for the Cabal and I see no reason why we should not return the favour. Yes, the subject would be an interesting specimen in the laboratory and yes, he might prove a threat should he desire to engage in the traditional Sith passtime of betrayal but these are observations I can make of our entire order after the loss of Skyr's leadership. If something must be learned from this, it is that the Hunter is more intelligent than my peers give him credit for - though such an intelligence if not nurtured will result only in a violent, blood-crazed beast, doubly so with Fernal's less than stellar stimulant concoctions of which I have repeatedly criticized. Send him to face Jedi - either he balks in the face of an unfamiliar galaxy and his own paranoia kills him, or he will wither away our rivals, proving his quality either way.

##Subject B15 - Unidentified Jedi Operative

**Target Analysis B15 - Version 21**
**Subject Identity:** Unconfirmed - Codename 'Shadow'
**Subject Value:** Unconfirmed
**Subject Validity:** Unconfirmed
**Last Update:** 21 - 5 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
The galaxy is home to many clandestine organizations - those who's identities are obscured for pragmatic security, fearful paranoia or simply the manifestation of an isolationist mind. These individuals are, for obvious reasons, the hardest for the Cabal to identify, and precautions must be taken to ensure that the existance of such targets are validated before further action is cautioned - I shall not be remembered as a conspirator jumping at shadows. In truth, my agents had doubted the existance of the Shadow on multiple occasions, so proficient are they at the arts of subterfuge - unfortunately for the target, they had gained my personal attention during a conflict with Cabal forces two years ago.

**Phase 1: Identification**
Head of a network of spies, informants, assasins and sabateurs - see Dossiers under B15-B for further analysis of the organization - the Shadow has shown remarkable aptitude for commanding their unit with extreme subtlelty and unconventional discipline. Although the extent of B15-B operations cannot be fully catalogued, evaluation of what we have suggests a vendetta against criminal and Sith elements across the galaxy. While other associates have dismissed this group as one of the many Republic cells deployed by the remaining Senate, I possess another theory. If one were to map every confirmed report of B15-B alongside events within a tolerable range of assumed involvement, a pattern of growth emerges - restrospective analysis indicates this growth can be traced to a smaller number of incidents occuring right after the Battle of Mizra where no Republic infrastructure was present - the Shadow is not an agent of the Senate, it is a Jedi.

**Phase 2: Hunting**
Hunting such a target is an exhilirating prospect - with many Jedi adopting a more aggressive and open stance since the Battle of Mizra it has become all-to-easy to track their locations. The Shadow possesses a different mind - though no less aggressive than their more militant counterparts and extremely active in combating Sith forces, they show no desire to reveal their presence or signal their achievements to the wider galaxy, correctly deducing that they can use the bellicosity of their associates as a distraction while striking at elements too wary for subjects such as Y8 'Wanderer' or C5 'Anathema' to catch. I have no doubt that they possess a similar curiosity for the Cabal and make their moves on myself as we speak, but the Shadow and I are patient creatures and our inevitable conflict shall, by the very nature of our work, not be rushed.

**Phase 3: Capture**
The deduction of the Shadow's nature to such a degree where a plan of capture can be formulated is beyond our current capacity. Needless to say the subject shows an adequate degree of precaution in hiding their intentions and abilities to dissuade precisely this form of evaluation, however a few things can be noted - the subject shows continual disregard for the Jedi Order's values, as revealed by the varied nature of B15-B agents - Jedi are not known for their manipulations, so this group was formed in mutual respect, philosophy and camraderie and are, in short, loyal to each other as individuals. Were a blow need to be struck against the Shadow, it would need to be struck at their allies to force them into more open conflict.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; active disruption. The Shadow grows ever closer to the Cabal and other clandestine Sith operations, without adequate resistance they will be in a position to inform more dangerous elements of the Jedi Order of our more secretive projects and thus jeapordize nondisposable assets.

Further, we are not the only ones to take notice - contacts in the underworld have confirmed that they too are beginning to piece together the Shadow's operations and are more than willing to seek revenge on the Jedi. For my part, I cannot condone sharing all we know with our rivals in Huttspace and the Core underworlds - but in the event where the subject must be more directly prioritized they could be afforded certain identities amongst B15-B to draw the Shadow into a less favourable position.

##Subject Z2 - Jedi Knight Netra

**Target Analysis Z2 - Version 6**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Knight Netra - Codename 'Augur'
**Subject Value:** A
**Subject Validity:** B* (Pending Reassessment)
**Last Update:** 13 - 29 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
An opportunity of unexpected velocity - the Augur has developed from a complete unknown to our primary target in the space of a few cycle fractions. The subject holds incredible powers of foresight for a mere Knight, such that she had become aware of us before we became aware of her. No longer a simple matter of curiosity, the subject has become the most immediate threat to the Cabal amongst the Jedi Order.

**Phase 1 - Identification**
Identification of the Augur was, in truth, entirely accidental. During pursuit of subject Anathema - see Target Analysis C5 - our agents were intercepted by a then unidentified Jedi Sentinel. Current investigations indicate she is a Jedi veteran that disappeared from galactic affairs sometime after the Battle of Mizra, thus leaving her beyond our perception until now. Theories of her acting as secret agent of the Jedi Order have been called into question by her verified modus operandi, my analysis is instead voluntary exile as a result of psychological trauma - as few sources have yet been verified, see Z2-2 for all unconfirmed documentation.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
Hunting the subject proved far swifter than other targets. Forced to abandon our more patient methods for risk of exposure, Cabal agents have been in active pursuit since shortly after identification. The Augur, while incapable of hiding from us on a permanent basis, appears to always be one step ahead of our attempts - a capability attributed to proposed abilities in her Force-related senses - current estimations indicate that she should have been cornered no less than three times, see Field Reports Z2-3, Z2-5 and Z2-8. Hypothetical analysis indicates that she may be fleeing to Jedi contact in an attempt to escape our clutches, this cannot be allowed and demands swift counteraction.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
Capture of the Augur has already been attempted on three occasions, to largely inexplicable failure. While possessing of many powers extrapolated of Jedi Knights, her combat capabilities have been estimated as substandard for her rank, instead showing affinity for the more cerebral arts of reconnaissance and investigation - we can only presume that her powers have rendered our surprise attacks ineffective and more direct methods of conflict have been proposed for future attempts.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; active and rapid detainment. The subject's potential knowledge of the Cabal, though largely unthreatening on her own merits, would prove disastrous in the hands of one of the Jedi Masters, elimination is therefore essential for operational security if nothing else - of course, her nature is also of considerable interest, I have not yet had the opportunity to study advanced practitioners of precognition in a controlled environment.

Lord Fernal's forces are currently incapable of catching such an elusive target, but perhaps Ah'Navi and my other associates will appreciate the opportunity to take such a promising figure off the dejarik board before her Jedi allies can save her from our clutches.

##Subject T3 - Jedi Padawan Farem Jarrik

**Target Analysis T3 - Version 4**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Padawan Feram Jarrik - Codename 'Savant'
**Subject Value:** B
**Subject Validity:** C
**Last Update:** 11 - 29 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
It is not often I bother myself with the likes of Padawans anymore, their abilities have been thoroughly categorized and it is far easier to acquire untrained specimens for purely biological research - the Savant, amongst a few others have proven fascinating exceptions worthy of study. Along with the Adept - see Target Analysis T5 - Savant has proven an exemplar of a strange but traceable phenomenon I am dubbing the Crisis Resurgence Principle; pushed to its limit by the massacre of its leadership following the Battle of Mizra the Jedi Orders' younglings appear to have been forced into a period of rapid development, from which a few individuals have shown significantly greater aptitude for the Force than previously encountered of their rank.

**Phase 1 - Identification**
Identification of the subject was not, in fact, performed by Cabal operatives, but was instead co-opted from the now defunct project of Darth Vex. My associate, it seemed, was intent on recruiting the Savant - whether to exploit the subject's obvious natural talents or simply to achieve some moral victory over the failing Jedi Order is beyond my care; regardless, they had collected extensive, if sloppy reports on him - these files have been marked under Dossier T3-3, with my own findings being organized in T3-1 and T3-2 as per the usual archiving. Needless to say, Vex utterly failed at seducing the Padawan into their service, though I am not certain their failure was total - the subject's operations outside the Temple have become notably more erratic and aggressive since the attempt.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
Outside of a single isolated incident, hunting the Savant has only just left initial stages - with so many of my resources stretched tracking subjects C5 'Anathema', Y8 'Wanderer,' and the rapidly developing situation with Z2 'Augur' the Cabal is simply stretched too thin to adequately track any Padawan that meets my curiosity - as much as I wish that were not so. Still, the subject has proven exceptionally crude in their informational security, declaring themselves to the galaxy in pointless displays of pride and self-aggrandizing benevolence. These weaknesses however came into question during the incident shown in Field Report T3-5, when one of my agents miscalculated his chances at detaining the subject and was subsequently discovered by the subject's then uncategorized talents at investigation - I would file a bounty on the agent in question for insubordination, but it appears as if the Savant had tied the loose ends up on his own.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
As shown in the single, if ill-conceived attempt at capture, the Savant has matched and exceeded all expectations as an avatar of the Crisis Resurgence Principle, surpassing a majority of Padawans in conventional Force abilities and, in particular, lightsaber applications, of which analysis indicates raw combat capacity more befitting of a Knight than a Padawan. Further still, a keen awareness of his surroundings belies his otherwise reckless temperament. Should the Cabal focus their efforts on his capture, I am certain such anomalies could be accounted for and the subject captured with high but manageable difficulty - of course, such resources are currently beyond my capacity.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; direct surveillance. The Savant's above-average value for experiments and newfound, if only cursory understanding of the Cabal leaves them both a priority specimen and a heightened risk to our operations - however, the subject shows a rash habit of stepping beyond the safety net of their abilities and I have no doubt that, given the right information, his many enemies in the underworld can be persuaded do draw him into a trap that someone of his inexperience cannot account for. If all else fails, he is the perfect target to test the capabilities of A24 'Hunter' in the field against Jedi without too significant a risk.

##Subject T5 - Jedi Padawan Kēru Ya'moshi

**Target Analysis T5 - Version 3**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Padawan Kēru Ya'moshi - Codename 'Adept'
**Subject Value:** B
**Subject Validity:** C
**Last Update:** 10 - 25 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
Have all Jedi lost their pretence for civility? The Adept, which we now come to believe is the Wanderer's Padawan - see Target Analysis Y8 for further comment - has shown a remarkable aptitude for being as boorish, ignorant and barbaric as her mentor, perhaps the theory that Jedi program all individuality from their students shows some merit. Regardless of my personal distaste, she has proven to be another product of the Crisis Resurgence Principle along with T3 'Savant', possessing abilities in the Force far beyond what is to be suspected of her experience. More so than her nature as a Force-sensitive, however, I cannot find her species within any of my records - it would be remiss for one of my kind to hold back on an opportunity to study her physiology even if nothing else.

**Phase 1 - Identification**
Like many Padawans, identification of the subject is an ongoing process due to their lack of verifiable history beyond the shrouded confines of the Temple - to which my information network still struggles to reach. Agents have been dispatched to adequately evaluate origin and history, though as with many of the other Padawans she has rapidly developed a habit of aggressively engaging with Sith and underworld forces, I have sent a request to Savin Targrave to develop a profile and Alexander Drax of Drax Industries to query on her species - I hear his database on exotic xenology is second to none and if nothing else he might be interested in an otherwise uncategorized sapient.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
As with other Padawan subjects, hunting the Adept has only just begun in earnest, with too many of my agents currently deployed elsewhere to make a focused effort. Like Y8 'Wanderer,' she has shown no talent for subtlety and an insistence on announcing her presence by resorting to violent measures in response to almost any obstacle - more promisingly, unlike Y8 'Wanderer' she has shown near-total obliviousness as to our motives and methods, though Field Report T5-3 does cover a near incident pertaining to hypothesized superior Force sense abilities. However, the subject has shown a certain wanderlust and high capacity for independent operation with her starcraft - a modified vessel optimized for swift galactic traverse, which renders active observation all but impossible at the Cabal's overtaxed state.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
With an extreme affinity for combat-related Force powers, a superlative skill in Form V and one of the most impressive physiques I have seen contained within such a limited physiology, it is no doubt that direct conflict would prove more difficult than any Padawan encountered before. Fortunately, passive observation has proven more than adequate in satiating my curiosity at the current time - particularly while my forces concentrate on the Z2 'Augur' situation. I believe we are simply unequipped to engage with such a combatant without significant reinforcements and the advantage of surprise. Yet it cannot be overstated how much more impossible this would become should the Adept and Y8 'Wanderer,' reunite.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; indirect surveillance. Though it pains me to let such a scientifically valuable specimen slip through our grasp, the Adept is simply a low risk and currently beyond our means to actively pursue until a later date. Future operations must rely on her lack of proximity to her master, however, and I could urge all Sith forces to keep the two separate wherever possible - not only does her capture become impossible in the Y8 'Wanderer's' presence, but the subjects' relationships might slow the deterioration of the latter's psyche and further sabotage future prospects.

##Subject C5 - Jedi Master Dhor Tallav

**Target Analysis C5 - Version 51**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Master Dhor Tallav - Codename 'Anathema'
**Subject Value:** S
**Subject Validity:** E
**Last Update:** 15 - 29 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
A source of frustrations unending, the Anathema holds the vice of ignorance as dogma and the ravings of the luddite as prophecy. Worse than an unknowing brute, he is no simpleton, but a keen mind dedicated to destroying and sealing knowledge - the paradox alone warrants nothing less than total destruction and yet he goads my wrath further by flaunting his gaudish Vaapad as if the Darkside cannot touch him. Death, nothing else will do, slow, painful and full of sorrow.

**Phase 1 - Identification**
Identification of such an antagonistic figure is, as always, beneath the need for my expertise. The Anathema has proven a staunch enemy of the Sith since the days of Skyr and has made his career in opposing our efforts for the past few decades. Dozens of accounts from Sith and independent sources have been compiled in Dossier C5-1, though any of our forces who are not already aware of his reputation should be marked for punishment of gross incompetence.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
Hunting has been equally trivial - as if to further test my patience, the Anathema has shown no talent nor desire for subtlety. Though the most mobile of our current targets, and thus difficult to actively track, his patterns are predictable and his operations without cloak - preferring to announce himself with lightsaber to our agents in artefact recovery operations across the galaxy. How he has such a capability in finding these sites just after - if not before our own investigations - is unknown, but I hypothesize he is something of an expert in the Sith amongst the Jedi Order. Of course only one so 'wise,' and 'incorruptible,' as he must be the rightful owner of our power, a power he no doubt uses for his own benefit behind closed doors - a curse upon his hubris! See Field Reports C5-4, C5-6, C5-12 and C5-21 for further context and theories on his investigative powers, as well as crimes commited against the Lords.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
Capture of the Anathema is an extremely difficult prospect, even if its success and subsequent experiments would bring me no shortage of satisfaction. Already a proficient combatant amongst the Jedi Masters, he has shown an extreme affinity for countering the abilities of Darkside users - a mastery in Vaapad and a strange ability to reportedly harm our Force-sensitive agents with some exotic power, to name a few. As such, any attempt at capture must rely on mundane forces, let us see his mastery of Sith lore prove useful in the face of plasma storms and other weapons of the common man.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; indirect surveillance. It is with no shortage of disgust that I must concede our inability to detain the subject without a significant advantage we do not currently possess. Worse still, the Anathema has repeatedly shown an ability to investigate and pursue Sith cults on his own intuition - any direct action on our part poses more risks than rewards at the current time.

An opportunity does prevent itself however, the subject insists on delving deep into Sith operations with fewer allies than would be pragmatic. If we could somehow weaponize one of these expeditions against him without alerting our own operatives, it would be difficult - but not impossible - to lead him into a trap. I am unsure if the Lords would permit the cataclysmic annihilation of one of our ancient treasures in return for the Anathema's life and I must admit I, too, would like to kill him personally - yet he may leave us no choice but to resort to more reliable measures than personal conflict.

**Addendum**
Contact Orn Viszla of the Mandalorians, tell him we have a Jedi Master for he and his brethren to kill, if they are up for the task.

##Subject Y8 - Jedi Master Kir Kadi

**Target Analysis Y8 - Version 22**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Master Kir Kadi - Codename 'Wanderer'
**Subject Value:** S
**Subject Validity:** E
**Last Update:** 13 - 28 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
The Wanderer continues to vex me. Such a prime specimen of the Force is rarely seen outside the safety of the Jedi Temple and yet every instinct of mine screams to back out - advice I would gladly follow were it not for the subject's insistence on drawing my attention with his brutish displays - if I were not convinced he was incapable of any motive but violence, I would almost think he intends to taunt me!

**Phase 1 - Identification**
Identifying the Wanderer has been trivial. An abundance of aggression and tendency towards direct action have left a strong reputation and many witnesses to interrogate - including Sith forces, Jedi captives and independent sources to eliminate perspective bias. Deeper investigation of his past will require more time, as readily available records of the subject predating the Battle of Mizra are less abundant, see Dossier Y8-1 for verified articles and Y8-2 for those pending verification.

**Phase 2 - Hunting**
Hunting has proven a more difficult matter - the subject has shown a remarkable degree of proficiency in avoiding notice for one so otherwise unsubtle. A keen awareness, hypothesised to originate from his strong connection to the Force compounds the issue - he knows he is being hunted and is all too eager to remind us. See Field Reports Y8-15 and Y8-31 for deeper analysis of primary incidents, but suffice to say previous estimations on the subject's deteriorated combat performance without his lightsaber were severely miscalculated. I am most curious as to these reports of absorption and deflection of blaster bolts with bare flesh - slugthrowers should be utilized in future engagements to further test these capabilities.

**Phase 3 - Capture**
Capturing the subject is, in simple terms, impossible for the Cabal. As one of the most proficient combatants in the Jedi Order, only a surprise attack would hold any chance of subduing him, a course of action I hypothesise to be equally difficult given his general wariness. Further, my agents have yet to confirm a single instance of the subject sleeping - whether this is the result of some rejuvenative power, uncategorized quirks of biology or simply a byproduct of pragmatic caution is currently under investigation.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; indirect surveillance. The Wanderer cannot hide his general locale from the Cabal, but more direct operations have resulted in repeated, abysmal failure. Any opportunistic deeper reconnaissance must be performed under higher obsfucation protocols - he cannot be allowed to trace our operatives back to us.

Still, such an incredible opportinity begs for attention. Perhaps if we can locate his missing lightsaber as bait, he can be goaded to face Lord Fernal in a conflict of our choosing - I know of many Mandalorian warriors who might bargain for a chance to bring the odds firmly in our favour and his ridiculous flagellatory crusade ever widens the distance between he and his Jedi allies. A proposal for the Lords at a later date.


##Subject K2 - Jedi Master Saewara Kol

**Target Analysis K3 - Version 53**
**Subject Identity:** Jedi Master Saewara Kol - Codename 'Politico'
**Subject Value:** A
**Subject Validity:** E
**Last Update:** 4 - 12 - 5ABM

**Foreword**
This one had previously been under investigation for many years, our records on her predating even the Battle of Mizra. I had given up on pursuing her entirely for more available prospects until recent events and must admit I feel a certain sense of familiarity returning to these files, like meeting an old colleague from a better time. Sentimentality aside, the Politico has shown signifcant restraint in her Order's darkest hour, pursuing the arts of council and negotation where others of her station have taken to their lightsabers in the face of our looming victory - these are qualities my Sith associates no doubt despise as weakness, but offers her a certain protection from their reach that they cannot understand.

**Phase 1: Identification**
The Politico's personal history before her introduction to the Jedi Order was detailled but fragmented - a socialite of some promise that was nevertheless prone to equal parts scandal as accomplishment, she was taken into the Temple at an advanced age for training. The skills of her past naturally gravitated towards her role as ambassador and envoy for the Jedi Council, culminating in her becoming one fo the Orders' most prominent diplomats in recent times. She has been fiercely fighting our efforts since the days of Skyr, yet her weapons have been words and favours, turning many of our prospective allies against us before they could be properly leveraged. Little information has been discovered since my re-evaluation of the subject, though the Politico's recent operations have shown a favouritism towards the Falleen nobility uncharacteristic of her usual restraint. Dossier K3-1 holds an extensive array of verified documentation on the subject, with Dossier K3-2 covering an even larger sum of unverified reports.

**Phase 2: Hunting**
Discovering and tracking the Politico's location has proven as trivial as one might expect given such a public figure - the necessities of her work all but demand her to broadcast her outward intentions and appearances to the galaxy and thus offer a simple method of pursuit. More concerningly - though entirely expected - is the level of security surrounding her more private information; my agents have been consistently rebuffed by operatives more skilled at subterfuge and counterespionage than usual Republic or Jedi agents - see Field Reports K3-14, K3-18 and K3-30 for more direct confrontations. It appears as if, though easy to find, the Politico will be difficult to approach without alerting many of her allies in court, the Senate or Jedi Order.

**Phase 3: Capture**
Analysis of the Politico's capabilities in combat are incomplete, oweing to the lack of indicents in which the subject's track record in conflict can be extrapolated from. As a Jedi Consular and Master, it is to be assumed that she possesses significant capabilities of Force-related awareness and the mental manipulation often employed by their diplomats - presumed deficiencies in lightsaber combat cannot be identified at this time and should not be acted upon. Given her position surrounded by Republic infrastructure and the foresight of her agents, it would require an extreme application of force, or otherwise the deployment of a highly elite group to have a chance at capturing her before she is extracted by any allies and as such remains beyond the reach of the Cabal.

**Conclusions**
Recommended course of action; passive surveillance. Though I have desired this subject for some time, the simplicity is that the Politico does not take any risks we can exploit and possesses the resources to become a greater threat to the Cabal if pressed. Attempted conflict is not only fraught with risk, but likely to be entirely without benefit at the current time.

In years to come, when the the last of the Republic crumbles under Lord Fernal's forces and her allies at court turn to infighting, I might offer a hand of salvation - she is more than capable of decieving my associates of her apparent threatlessness and might make for a better ally, or conversationalist if nothing else, than another medical subject. Should she refuse, it is no great loss, her persuasive powers in the Force are a rarity in today's barbaric landscape and would certainly be of interest for experimentation.
