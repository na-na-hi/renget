“My name is Chris could I please get a Sonic fact pertaining to-”

“Sorry time's up you snooze you lose and now you’re dead! Anyway Sonic fact of the day Sonic fact of May!”

Various alarms go off in the background before a text-to-speech esc voice blares the words “sonic fact.”

“Did you know that Sonic rapes children?”

The sound of an audience gasping is played coupled by various sounds of an audience clapping.

“That’s your Sonic fact you better remember cause we’re gonna ask you what Sonic does tomorrow alright next guest the lucky guest the one ready to win all the money from the biggest Sonic fan contest alright contestant give me a cool Sonic fact and if it’s not cool that ain’t cool alright you ready?”

“Can you stop taking up all the radio signals you moronic nitwit? For the past hour I have-”
The audience gasp noise is repeated thirteen times over, continuing over even as Stanford speaks.

“You’re too slow you’re too slow man don’t you get that reference that’s an epic Sonic reference for all you epic Sonic fans out there that just love Sonic and everything related to Sonic and not Tails nobody likes Tails if your name is Tails and you’re listening to this BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT!

A singular low-quality drum sound can be heard for the next two minutes.

“Okay my epic Sonic fans who know all about Sonic who love Sonic who are Sonic who will be Sonic we’ve got an epic trivia round for you guys it’s gonna contain some real hard-hitters some real hedgehog hitters don’t you get that reference it’s a Sonic reference Sonic is a hedgehog reference reference reference reference it’s a Sonic reference alright first caller what’s the answer?”
