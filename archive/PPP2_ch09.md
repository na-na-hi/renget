#### Technicalities: Classes, etc.
>*“Remember, things take time.”* —Piet Hein

*"In this chapter, we keep our focus on our main tool for programming: the C++ programming language. We present language technicalities, mostly related to user-defined types, that is, to classes and enumerations. Much of the presentation of language features takes the form of the gradual improvement of a Date type. That way, we also get a chance to demonstrate some useful class design techniques."*
