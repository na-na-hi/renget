Name: Maddison C.
Face: Resting bitch face. Nice cheekbones. The type of blonde bombshell you'd see in a high society gathering.
Hair: Long and voluminous, of course. Golden blonde and wavy. Very soft. Same for the eyebrows.
Eyes: Emerald green.
Height: On the taller side. Let's say about 5'7".
Bodytype: She's got nice curves and an ample bosom. Perfect cheerleading body.
Complexion: Pale, fair skin. A small beauty mark under her right eye and side of her chin and a couple more on her left cheek.
Uniform variation: Short skirt. Nice design. Don't really care but she is the daughter of high end fashion gurus.

Voice: Loud and annoying. Very haughty. Laughs at the misfortune of Huffs.
Body language: Proud and stands tall. Crosses her arms a lot. Of course she has good posture.
Social: A bully and a bit of a bimbo. Likes to cheerlead for her favorite Quidditch team (though in reality she doesn't care for the sport and only joins in for the social status). Usually seen around Rout. Despite the constant bullying, there's a bit more there that she hates to admit.
Visibility: "Would."
Engagement: She's plenty social. (I am not, however).
Quirks: Is bitchiness a quirk?
Things your character wouldn't do: Admit to befriending a Hufflepuff.
Animals: She relates to the pretty birds.
Misc: She tends to heavily favor the witches. Especially the pretty ones.
