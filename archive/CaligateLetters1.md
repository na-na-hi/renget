#Things got dicey...

"Ah, letters, great! I gotta write my stuff fast! Someone get me a proof reader!"

>To Grenel
Noble Grenel! I am pleased to have such a letter! I extend any help I can possibly offer to you, and I wish to meet up soon! We must talk, as soon as possible. There are several important issues, one of which being the safety of our allies. We need to immediately discuss what shall be done with the boy, Magnus. I would prefer to discuss this in person, like many other things, but I need to secure my bearings before I can do anything. Another issue we must discuss is Octavian Caelrus in the East. We need to secure such a valuable ally. As you may already know if my letter arrives late, and at risk of this being leaked, Torn wishes me to hinder either Ruga or the *Cobra King* in the South. I have the beginnings of a plan on how to deal with this. However, I wish to gain responses from several of my neighbors before I do anything. I also need to deal with a certain fellow to the West of me and Captain Commander Torn. If you need immediate assistance, send for me, and I will try to respond in a timely manner. Due to urgency, I will not use an Authentication Code. To prevent interception, I have provided instructions for the messenger. You shall hold him with you, and I shall retrieve him myself. This is to secure any faulty messengers!

>To Torn
Captain Commander Torn! Forgive my lack of greetings. I will attempt to focus on the orc when I get the chance, but something of incredible urgency has appeared. Right to the West of you, a certain bastard has shown his face! Shame on me for letting such a tyrant grow in Colovia under my watch, but the slimy undertaker Cassynder Mero has shown his ugly mug! I have heard rumors that he wishes to ally with the so-called *Cobra King*, and dealing with vermin so close to my (and by extension, your) supply lines will be of upmost importance to our efforts! I wish to meet with you post-haste. We also must talk about the boy to the North of us. You know the one. Due to urgency, I will not use an Authentication Code. To prevent interception, I have provided instructions for the messenger. You shall hold him with you, and I shall retrieve him myself. This is to secure any faulty messengers!

>To Magnus
Noble Magnus Septim II! Forgive my harsh language, but I absolutely demand your presence and safekeeping! I know the Blades well, and I need to discuss with them as much as I need to discuss with you! Please, as soon as you possibly can, meet up with me! If I know Noble Grenel well, then he has already reached out to you! Follow his orders as well as you can! Do NOT engage, under any circumstances! The Empire needs the Septim line! Be careful of any alliances you agree to! Give vague answers until both I, Grenel, and Captain-Commander Torn have given you counsel! Be careful!

>To the Blades of Magnus Septim II
This is for any Blade willing to listen! Bring Magnus Septim II to Grenel or I as soon as you possibly can! His safety is of utmost importance. Keep 30 men with him at all times. Attempt to use as many elaborate codes as possible, and the Blades under my command will figure it out. Use every trick you can! Burn this message after reading it.

Authentication Code: I have sent a capable Blade to take care of this. I have left the code up to him. If you suspect that he is not a Blade, kill him.

>To Endehm
Lord Endehm! I know practically nothing of you, other than that you are fearsome, and lead a great army. A battle between us would certainly lead to great casualities, hopefully only among combatants. For that reason, I extend an offer of peace, and hopefully one of an alliance! I wish to discuss if our goals align and if compromises can be made! At least, I wish to prolong the beginning of battle between us as long as possible! Please, respond as soon as you can! If you need to know of my goals, it can be summed up as the safety of the people of Colovia, and hopefully the safety of people all over Tamriel!

>To Octavian
Noble Octavian! As a fellow good Imperial, I need to know of both your safety and alliances as soon as possible! I am worried of your current position. I ask not of you to fight, nor do I expect it of you. All I ask is that you and I have a meeting. Due to the danger of where you are, I also do not want you to make yourself vulnerable. I will attempt to come to you in time. For now, be wary. If I know anything of Torn, he will wage battle against either the orc in the North of the snake in the South. Either way, I believe that you will be in a crossfire. Prepare as well as you can.

>To Kasha
Noble Kasha! Although I am unsure of your goals, I believe that you wish to keep the people of this land safe. In that, we are both allies. At worst, I wish to discuss of where we will do battle to avoid the pain of Imperial citizens. At best, I wish for us to strike up an alliance! May a meeting between us happen soon!
    - General Caligate

>To Vivie
Lady Vivie! You are in grave danger! The orc, the barbarian, the swordsman, the necromancer, and the bird... they can not be reasoned with. You will find that the Imperials are very easy to reason with, and that we can easily become valuable allies. I propose an alliance, and I hope that you can survive their onslaught long enough for us to reach an agreement. Believe me, you do not need even more enemies on your hands. Even if only temporary, an alliance between you and the great Imperial army will be of a great aid to you. Forgive any ill feelings this letter may carry, I hope for only the best.

>To Ysmir
Lord Ysmir! I wish to discuss the orc. He is an issue. A very large issue. I merely wish to offer an alliance between us, and I wish to also let you know that an alliance between you and the orc, although you are both from Skyrim, will end in one or even both of your deaths. He is a savage beast, hardly fit for the worst dungeon the Empire has to offer. I believe that you are both far more reasonable and far more civilized than him. In fact, bloodshed between us may be avoidable entirely. An alliance would do good for us both, would it not? Remember; savages always turn on each other. Align yourself with those that can be reasoned with, for the good of both of our people.
