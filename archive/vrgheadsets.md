#####--- PC REQUIREMENTS ---#

The [SteamVR Performance Test](https://store.steampowered.com/app/323910/SteamVR_Performance_Test/) is a bit out of date, but it's a good way to see if your PC is way too weak for VR.
There's a similar check specifically for the Index [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070910/Are_you_ready_for_Valve_Index/).
If there are any games you're specifically looking to play, it'd be a good idea to go ahead and check the requirements for those as well.

Aside from just looking bad, not being able to maintain a smooth framerate VR can actually make you feel sick, so it's important to make sure your PC is up to par.

If you're looking to upgrade or build a new PC for VR, Logical Increments is a good place to start since they have a [guide specifically for VR builds](https://www.logicalincrements.com/articles/vrguide).
 

#####--- HEADSET SELECTION ---#

The Valve Index is still arguably the best overall PCVR headset, although depending on your use case, there might be better options. Unlike most of the current alternatives, it still uses lighthouse tracking instead of relying on headset cameras and allows for easy integration of full body tracking.

The Quest 2 is the best budget option at the moment if you don't mind having to use a Meta account. In addition to being able to be used as a standalone headset, it can be used as a PCVR headset either wired through [Link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-link-with-quest-2/) or wirelessly through [Air Link](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-with-air-link/) or [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/).
Telemetry can be limited through [Oculess](https://github.com/basti564/Oculess) if you're worried about that, although it does have a few minor drawbacks.
Also worth mentioning that Quest 2 also gives you access to a few exclusives that currently aren't playable any other way.

Quest Pro is lighter than the a Quest 2, has improved lenses, and has face and eye tracking that can be used in VRChat. It also has self tracked controllers that can be bought separately to use with other Quest headsets. It's not generally better for games, so unless face and eye tracking are a must have for you, it's not worth the extra money over a Quest 2.

Pico 4 is another good budget option if it's easily available in your country. Like a Quest, it can be used as a standalone headset or connected to a PC either wired and wireless through [Streaming Assistant](https://www.picoxr.com/global/software/pico-link) or [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) to play PCVR games. Has pancake lenses, which are an improvement over what's available in the Quest, but has a worse game selection if you're using it as a standalone headset.

Pico 4 Pro adds face and eye tracking to the regular Pico 4, but doesn't really improve anything outside of that. Face and eye tracking also require you to use the Chinese firmware instead of global, which means you're stuck with Pico's official [Streaming Assistant](https://www.picoxr.com/global/software/pico-link) instead of Virtual Desktop. Notable for being the cheapest way to get face and eye tracking if it's available in your country, but hard to recommend for most people.

Reverb G2 is still a decent option for sim players if you can find it for a good price. Headset resolution is high, but the controller tracking, while still usable, is subpar compared to other headsets. Playing some heavier SteamVR games through the WMR software can add some overhead, [OpenComposite](https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR) can help if you're running into performance issues there.

In general, older headsets like the Vive, Rift CV1, or any WMR headset other than the Reverb G2 are only worth picking up if you can find one very cheap.

PSVR 2, while better than the original, still has a fairly limited selection even compared to a standalone Quest and is pretty hard to recommend.
