"GOOD MORNING EMPIRE CITY AND WELCOME TO EMPIRE RADIO! I am your host Etnio, Today our morning is showering us with fine sunrays as Monday starts and... oh they hit the saxophone guy again uhh... anyway-" **Click** the radio turns off by Bunsy who has just shoot saxophone guy near pads in the hopes he doesn't play the sax, which the radio did confirm, if a little bit dramatized, but it's a price to pay to get some more hours of uninterrupted sleep.

Or at least that was Bunsy's plan, untill the phone started to ring.

The phone was in the other side of the room, or if you can call it a room, it's a bloody mess... but  it used to be worse, ever since "her admirer" tries to enter her home under Bunsy's nose to do "Things" to her, she usually grabs some of the trash it finds in the room and takes it with it.

Regardless bunsy picks up the phone and she instantly knew it was the voice of Empire Radio.
"Hello bitch..." 
*"Wow what a way to start a day." Bunsy though to herself* 
"... I know it was you who shot my saxophonist, you have been doing this for more than 5 months and nobody has had the balls to call you out on it."
*"and he kept the count to, what's next? will he guess at what hour i will start on the commisions?" Bunsy also though*
"So today, i am fixing that, and i am sending an army of drones and- What do you mean we had to sell them? WHAT DO YOU MEAN C.I.E.C. IS IN OUR AS-"
Bunsy decided to close the call for the time being, it seems to her that the Etnio was already busy with his own problems.

Then she hears the phone call again, this time a different number.
"Good morning Ms. Bunsy, we are from the **C**entral **I**nteligence of **E**mpire **C**ity"
*"Oh no" Bunsy though as she was starting to sweat*
"We have called you to let you know that your attempts on stopping Etnio Mind controlling plans have been great help on capturing him."
*"... nevermind then." Bunsy though*
"Thanks with the fact that he had purchased (and sold) an amount of drones that citizens aren't legally allowed to have, we were able to capture and send him to jail, Empire Radio is going to take an hiatus because of this, but at least the city shall be safe."
"You are welcome..." Bunsy responds with a slight amount of shock, she was still surprised that the CIEC went to thank her.

The phone then hangs up... Bunsy is going to need a minute, but alas she can't get one as she recieves another call.
"Hello..." Bunsy responce to the call.
"Hello Ms.Bunsy, we are from the **F.BI.**"
*"Yup, i am fucked now." Bunsy though.*
"We want to make commision"
"What..."
"Yes, we want to commision some NSFW."
*"Ughh..." Bunsy though.* "Alright... but please, next time, set your orders via Email because right now i just want to sleep." Bunsy responds to the commisioner
"Understandable, we will send your info there then."
the caller ends the call, leaving Bunsy with more confusion than anything else.

But alas Bunsy seeing she doesn't want hear another ring of her phone, she decides to turn it off and take a long rest. 
Too much happend in so little time on Monday no less, she's going to sleep for the day.
