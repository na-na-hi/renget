## Deck Tier Lists

GameWith and Shadowverse Master each maintain tier lists for both the rotation and unlimited formats. GameWith is in Japanese, so if you can't read the moon runes you may need to pump it through a translator. Shadowverse Master is in English.

- GameWith Tier List: [Rotation][gw-rotation] | [Unlimited][gw-unlimited]
- Shadowverse Master Tier List: [Rotation][svm-rotation] | [Unlimited][svm-unlimited]

Additionally, competitive player [Zhiff][zhiff-yt] publishes weekly meta snapshots on YouTube, which contain a more detailed breakdown on popular decks and meta trends.

During the first 1-2 weeks of a new expansion tier lists tend to be wildly inaccurate as players experiment with new decks and counters to those decks. The best indication for which decks are good during this time are players who reach Grand Master rank early in the expansion, though even this can be misleading. Where possible, it can be better to keep using a deck from the previous expansion in the early stages of a new expansion until the meta has settled enough to know which decks are worth crafting.

## Where to Find Decks

- Shadowverse Master's Tier List includes decks from each archetype taken from major tournament winners & contestants, as well as decks that achieved large win streaks.

## Useful Search Terms

These terms may be useful for finding Japanese-language posts on Twitter or other resources. Note that in Japanese, the classes have fairly generic names (e.g. Runecraft is simply called "witch") so you'll probably also find many unrelated posts when simply searching for class names.

## FAQs

1. **Does my progress up the ladder reset?** The Shadowverse ladder is divided into two sections: the "rank ladder" and the master ladder. The rank ladder starts at Beginner rank and goes up through D, C, B, A and AA. Each rank except Beginner has four sub-ranks (e.g. D0, D1, D2 and D3). **Your progress through the rank ladder never resets, even between expansions**. While it's possible to fall down between the sub ranks, once you reach a new lettered rank, you can never fall back down into the previous letter. For instance, it's possible to fall down from B2 to B1, and B1 to B0, but it's impossible to fall back from B0 into the C ranks. Once you clear the AA ranks you'll enter the Master ladder. Once you reach Master you're Master rank forever; it's impossible to fall back down into the rank ladder.  Progress up the master ladder is measured purely in points rather than ranks, and is reset at the end of every expansion. If you reach 10,000 points in the master ladder you'll achieve the rank of Grand Master, which lasts until the start of the next expansion, at which point you'll be returned to Master rank with a Master score of zero.
1. **How temporary are "Temporary Cards"?**  Most of them aren't. All temporary cards fall into one of three categories:
    1. Every player has a single temporary copy of each legendary card from Classic through Steel Rebellion. These never expire.
    2. Temporary cards can be bought using Temporary Gems. Neither these cards nor the gems themselves ever expire.
    3. Temporary cards can be obtained by purchasing a temporary deck. **These are the only genuinely temporary temporary cards**, and expire at the end of the expansion they were purchased in.
2. **I saw a player with a fancy animated sleeve, where do I get it**?: Animated sleeves with ornate patterns of circles and shapes on them [(such as this)][gm-sleeve] are Grand Master sleeves. They are obtained by reaching 10,000 master points in a single expansion. Each expansion has a different GM sleeve; the pattern is the same as the card back you see when opening packs for that expansion.  Animated sleeves with a character or other art on them are either rewards for drawing that character's leader card, or purchase bonuses for certain limited-time bundles in the store.
