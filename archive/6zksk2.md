Inigo looked up from his phone. It’s been two days since a group of villains attacked four hero agencies and injured Majestic, a pro-hero and one of the teachers in Shiketsu Academy. Class had been canceled for a day while authorities increased security, and swept Shiketsu Academy for any villain activities. The news had been airing footage of the attack non-stop for the last 24 hours. He sat back and looked at the television. A blue-haired woman was reporting in front of the damaged Majestic Hero Agency.  

*[ “-none of the villains associated with the attack has been apprehended. The public is advised to remain alert and report anything suspicious to the authorities.” ]*

“No arrests yet. At least class is back on.” He walked to the kitchen counter and poured himself a bowl of Lazer Honey Flakes, the Majestic brand cereal. His small shapeshifting dragon, Gigan, floated by his side with a worried expression.

Junichi sat on the other side of the counter eating his own breakfast. The dark-haired boy, who lived two buildings down, spoke with his mouth half-full of cereal. “It may not be obvious, but these attacks are a necessary step. The world has to change or fall apart. Hero society can’t- dude can you pass the milk.”

Inigo looked up from texting and nudged the milk towards his revolutionary friend. “Hey, you ever run into these Night Parade guys?”

“No, but maybe one day..” Junichi said, looking at the box art of the Lazer Honey Flakes box. “Do you think they’ll change the box art now that he’s.... you know…..” He extended a sharp bone with his quirk and poked it through the eyes of the grinning Majestic on the box, leaving two gaping holes where his eyes should be. 

“Looks better...” The flicker of a smile crossed his emotionless face.

“I dunno,” Inigo shrugged as he quickly took his shirt off, snapped a selfie and sent it. “The news said he was rushed off to a medical facility. They probably have some super healer that’ll fix him up, or he’ll get robot eyes.” He started quickly eating his cereal.

Junichi narrowed his eyes. “Leave it to the government to hide advanced medicine from the rest of us. Saving it for their privileged heroes.”

“Yeah, doesn’t seem right.” Inigo placed his empty bowl in the sink. “I’m about to head out, you got any plans today?”

“Still waiting on Legion. I’m gonna beat the game on Nightmare, then do more quirk training.”

“Beats having to go to class. Bro maybe, I should just drop out too.”

“You should.”

 “Not yet, cause I got someone I want to see in class.” Inigo grinned. “Good luck man. I’m off!”

Junichi bumped fists with Inigo before making his way to the couch to play more games. Inigo sent several heart emojis with his phone, grabbed his school bag, and made his way out the door. 

#####II. Shiketsu Academy Gates
Inigo hopped off his skateboard as he got close to the school. Gigan shifted back and floated by his head. The gates to Shiketsu Academy had guards posted near the entrance. There was a small number of protestors in front of them. The aftermath of the recent villain attack weighed heavily on everyone’s minds. As he passed by the protestors, their voices reached his ears. They accused the heroes of recklessly endangering civilian lives and the community. The parents in the crowd feared for their children’s safety in the school. 

Inigo couldn’t help but feel a pang of guilt and sadness for them. He knew the sacrifices that heroes made to protect society and how hard his classmates worked to reach their dreams of becoming pro-heroes, but he also understood that not everyone shared that perspective. 

As the guards waved him through the gates, the stares from the non-hero course students inside didn’t help the already charming atmosphere. He heard murmurs and whispered conversations as he passed by the schoolyard. He decided to hide Gigan in his pocket for the time being. There’s no use in making other students uncomfortable. At least he could hide his quirk if he wanted to, he wondered how the others were fairing. Yui, Noah, and some of the others wouldn’t have many ways to hide. They’d have to face all those eyes on them. He was a little worried.

#####III. Shiketsu Hero Course 1-D Classroom

1-D class was quieter than normal as they were all waiting for their teacher. There was a gloomy atmosphere in the room which mirrored the dark gray skies outside. The air felt charged with electricity like a storm was approaching. The news of a recent villain attack on one of their esteemed teachers had cast a shadow over the student body’s spirits. Rosethorn-sempai had come in only for a short time, she explained that the faculty would be in meetings all day, and that the class would have a substitute teacher. 


Meanwhile Inigo was in a different world, he sighed with his chin on his hand, his elbow propped on top of his desk as he stared at Hoge in the corner of the classroom. Hiro, who sat between them, frowned at the absent-minded blonde-boy. Inigo heard murmurs when the substitute teacher, Localoca, walked in. As she spoke, her contagious enthusiasm lightened up the attitude of the class. Inigo remembered liking her videos online and the rescue classes she taught them, but today she seemed to be more concerned with keeping them pre-occupied while the teachers had their meeting.

*“Omigosh! You’re super-safe in Shiketsu, don’t you worry about it! I’m so totally super-excited to be here today, teehee~! We’ll start with a roll call, oh she did that already?~ Woopsie, then let me just see here. You! Angel-boy, Abrams right? I love love love your face! I could just eat you up! UwU *Hug hug hug* Gosh so today I have to tell you all the NEW mega-awesome safety rules the boys in BLUE gave us!~ We’ll be using puppets to demonstrate! Yaaay! You Sandatsu-kun! Put your hand up, you’ll be playing Mrs. Tiddles. And This is Mr. Furrybottom! Imai-kun, you can be him. Everyone say Hi! HIIII!~ (Deeper voice) I’m Mr.Furrybuttom, and here’s Shiketsu’s newest safety protocols! First of all, please use the buddy-X system. (Higher voice) Oh! Mr. Furrybottom, what’s the buddy-X system? (Deeper voice) Glad you asked, Mrs.Tiddles! I think it’s really, really, really….”*

Inigo, Bobby, and Hifumi watched from the back of the class. Hifumi had his arms crossed. Bobby let out a low groan of boredom. All at the same time they leaned forward and looked at each other. An unspoken conversation flashed between the boys’ faces. They all stood up and made their way out the closest door.

*“..really, really, really, really…”*

Localoca-sensei didn’t seem to notice them as she continued speaking with the puppets and reading from a script written in pink bedazzled paper. Some of the class did notice them leaving however. Inigo caught Yui’s attention. Inigo winked, and pointed up. “We’re going to the roof,” He whispered sharply. The bored delinquent glanced at the preoccupied substitute-teacher and then got up to join them.

On the way out the door, Hifumi moved past Hailey’s desk, he lingered next to her and held out his hand without looking. Hailey was busy on her phone. Her eyes widened slightly as his finger brushed against her hair. An amused smile flashed across her lips and her hand moved to take his. Their fingers intertwined and she stood up, doing a small twirl and a wave to her friends as she left with him. Bobby was trying to do the same with Minnie, but she didn’t seem brave enough to risk getting caught. The two shared a longing look as Bobby passed by. Hifumi, Hailey, Inigo, Bobby, and Yui walked out of the classroom and made their way to the roof.

Inigo glanced back at the classroom as the others made their way up. He had approached Hoge, but she shot him a look of disapproval, or at least he thinks she did, her quirk made her difficult to focus on. He was getting more used to how her quirk worked however, he could kinda tell from her head position whether she didn’t like something he was doing. He projected his construct outwards from the hallway, Gigan transformed into a floating replica of his hand. He had to tell if she was mad, maybe he could feel her frowning. He attuned his senses to the construct hand, and willed it forward. He moved it to lightly brush Hoge’s arm as she watched the teacher. Hoge tensed up. He crawled his fingers slowly up her shoulder, along her neck, and then eased it up to her cheek. She was breathing hard and her face felt warm. He touched her lips and-  “You coming, Bro?” Bobby called out from half-way up the staircase. Inigo jumped and recalled his construct. 

“Uh.. Y-yeah! On my way man!” Inigo stammered. 

His face was red, he shook his head and took one last glance at the class before leaving. Gigan shot him a judgmental look as he climbed up the stairs.

#####IV. Shiketsu West Wing Rooftop
Grey skies hung over the rooftop of Shiketsu High. The group of 1-D students arrived seeking solace from the constraints of the classroom. From the roof they could see and hear the small group of protestors, and the new guards at the school’s gate.  As they gathered, each student found their own space to occupy.

Hifumi reclined against the ledge next to the door. He stared up at the sky and seemed to be relaxing in the moment. Beside him sat Hailey who had her phone out, her legs resting comfortably on his lap. They were lost in their own little world, exchanging affectionate glances and playful whispers. In the corner, Yui kept to herself, she was busy crafting something with her quirk. Her hands moved swiftly, weaving together the fibers she produced, occasionally she’d swear and disentangle a part she didn’t like, starting all over again.

Meanwhile, Bobby and Inigo were engaged in a friendly duel, their powers clashing with each strike. 

Bobby let loose a series of sunlight-enhanced punches. Inigo blocked two of them and rolled back, dodging the rest of the combo. He pushed his arm forward. “Dragonclaw Crash!” A clawed construct arm grew from his armor and crashed towards Bobby. Bobby weaved past the construct and punched Inigo in the stomach, denting his armor as he staggered back. 

“Nice hit. You got me.”

Bobby grinned. “Round 2?”

“I’m always up for another round.”

“Hey why do you do that by the way? When you yell out your move before you do it.”

Inigo shrugged. “I dunno, I think it’s cool. Isn’t that what pro-heroes do?”

Hifumi spoke up, “Yeah, Endeavour does. You should check out his Top 10 Prominence Burn videos. It's sweet. He really knows how to work a crowd.”

Bobby scratched his head. “Doesn’t it tell the opponent when to dodge?”

Inigo grinned, “But then you can fake them out if they start doing that.”

Hifumi smirked. “Heh. Just do a one-liner at the end of the fight. It’s more badass.”

“Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker!” Bobby yelled, as he swung his fist in the air.

The other two joined in. 

“Your evil ends here, for good!” 

“Keep the change, ya filthy fungus!” 

“I have no words. My voice is in my sword.”

“Ice to meet you!” 

“I want my father back, you son of a bitch!” 

“Justice is served! Your fate’s sealed.”

The three boys laughed and kept on repeating one-liners.

Hailey rolled her eyes, she was a little bored and turned her attention towards Yui in the corner. Yui swore as she started untangling something. Hailey spoke loudly, “Ew. What the fuck is SHE even doing??” She pointed at Yui, as all the guys stopped to turn their heads.

Yui turned around, holding what seemed like a half-finished crafting project. “Screw off! Why don’t you mind your own damn business!?"” she yelled from the corner. 

“Let’s have a look.” Hailey said with an amused smile, ignoring the delinquent’s comment as she used her quirk to yank Yui’s unfinished craft towards her. She floated it in front of the group and made it spin slowly.

“Gross.. It looks like something died to make this,” She laughed.

“Kinda looks like a lil hat,” Bobby suggested. “Good work Yui.”

Inigo frowned. “Hey, you should give that back to her.”

“Give it back!” Yui stood, she glared at Hailey.  She marched towards them angrily. “Now!” Yui puffed out her chest as red ribbons shot out of her and wrapped around her limbs.

Hifumi placed a hand on Hailey's head and gave her an impatient look. "C'mon."

“Whatever. It’s just trash!” Hailey said, she smirked and sent Yui’s craft flying up and over the rooftop fence.

"I'll get it."  Inigo jumped and flew to get it, but Hifumi beat him to it. He teleported and grabbed it mid-air. He opened his eyes and reappeared where he was before. With one arm around Hailey’s shoulder, he stepped forward and held it out for Yui to take. “Take it, and.. she’s sorry.”

Yui growled and snatched the item from his hand. “Don’t apologize for her bitchy behavior! If she tries that again I’ll punch her face in!”

Hailey scoffed, she placed her hands on her hips. “Don’t pretend like you’re worth talking to circus-freak. Why did you even join us here? NOBODY wants you around.”

“You wanna die?!” Yui snarled. 

Inigo saw a look flash on Yui’s face, the one she makes before she’s about to attack, he’s been on the receiving end of that glare. She looked like an unkept fuzzy tabby that’s about to pounce. It was kinda cute. His eyes met with Hifumi’s, who was taking a defensive stance of his own. He rushed forward. “Hey, we gotta go!” Inigo stepped in front of Yui and activated his quirk. Below them, Gigan transformed into its larger dragon form, it was about the size of a large horse. 

Inigo and a startled Yui flew off the roof on Gigan’s back. They flew towards the sky. “Hold on tight!”

***

“Myoga! W-what the hell?” Yui whipped her ribbons around Inigo’s arm and neck, and held on to him from behind. Before she realized what was happening, they were already too high up for her to get off. She whimpered.

“I had to get us out of there!” Inigo yelled through the sound of air rushing past them, he patted Gigan to make it slow down. “Hailey shouldn't have done that, but I don’t want to see my friends fighting.”

“You’re friends with that Hailey-girl?! Maybe I was wrong about you!”

Inigo felt stung. “She’s more of a work-in-progress, she’s with Hifumi. Besides, we’re all in one class, we should all be friends.”

“You’re dreaming. I can’t stand any of those girls.. You saw what she fucking did!”

“-one billion yen!”

“Huh?”

“I said what if I gave you one billion yen? Would you be friends with her?”

“What! No! Do you even have that kind of money?”

“Two billion yen?”

“No!”

“Five billion?” Inigo grinned.

“Stop trying to bribe me! H-hey.. aren’t we a little too high up.” She held onto Inigo closer. He was aware of the ribbon around his neck that threatened to choke him out as it got tighter, and also of Yui’s form behind him. Inigo patted Gigan and they stopped going up, they hovered over the school. 

“I thought we could chill here for a bit. Besides, I wanted to talk to you, Yui.”

Yui narrowed her eyes. “What is it? You better not try anything weird, dragon-boy.”

“You seemed like you weren’t in a good mood this morning. Uh.. worse than usual.”

“Who the hell would be? You saw the villains in the news and the protesters down there. The way the other classes look at us.  I had enough bullshit to deal with already!”

“That’s why I brought you. I like to come up here and look down, see how small and tiny everything is. All the problems seem further away. Even those protestors are just ants! Helps me see the bigger picture.”

“That’s dumb. They’ll still be there when we get down.”

 “Yeah, I guess what matters is how we react to them.”

“Tch. I don’t care. I just want them to mind their own business.”

“Hey, before you came to the school, you were a villain right?”

Yui was quiet for a moment. “So, what?”

“You ever run into Night Parade?”

“No. What the hell? Do you think I’m with them now? Is that it?”

“No, I’m just curious, I swear!” He turned around to face her. “You're the most heroic person I know. You were really brave when you took on that elephant villain."

Yui turned away. “I don’t know anything except..  I heard the Night Parade has a cat. A black cat.”

Inigo smiled. “Cool. Hey what’re those things you were making anyway?”

“You’ll know when I’m done with them!”

“Fair enough.”

“Now take us back down already! I’m not attacking anyone. That stuck-up bitch isn’t worth getting suspended over.”

“Alright then.” Inigo winked. “It’s time to show you, what the best part of being up here is.” He took Yui’s hand in his. 

“Myoga?”

“I call it dragon-diving!” Inigo hunched down and Gigan dove hard and sharply. "Hold on tight!" The wind rushed past them, as Gigan began to spiral as well. 

“YOU IDIOT! I’M GONNA KILL YOU! YOU’RE DEAD!” Yui’s grip on his hand was crushing. Inigo grinned. 

“WOOOHOOO!! IT’S FINE! TRUST ME! I WON’T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO US!” As they were free-falling, he glanced over at Yui. She had her eyes closed. He saw a small smile on her face. He just hoped she felt better when they got down. He won't let anything bad happen to any of his classmates, not if he can help it.

#####V. Shiketsu Hero Course Hallway

It was lunch time, and Inigo was busy searching the halls of Shiketsu to find Hoge. She wasn’t in her usual "hidden" spots, but they were all marked by a sticker of an angry tanooki. Maybe she was mad at him? He decided to go back to the classroom. 

As he got there, he spotted Christopher walking the halls as well. He grinned and waved, Chris seemed more tired than usual.

“Hey. Have you seen Hoge around?”

“She left right away after the last period. I assumed she was with you,” Christopher let out a small groan of discomfort and rubbed his arm.

“Bro, are you alright? You seem out of it. Want me to come with you to the nurse’s office?”

“I’m okay. I’m just working on something.”

“Alright well, I’m around if you need help.” Inigo felt a bit worried, but then he pointed at the two lunch boxes that Christopher carried. “That’s a lot of food for one person.” 

“I packed a lot from home so-”

Inigo grinned slyly. “Oho. I get it. You brought lunch for a girl, I did the same thing with Faith, and here I was planning our next big campaign. The Seniors! Do you no longer need your finest general by your side?”

“It’s not like-”

“No need to tell me anything.” Inigo placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder. His eyes were shining. “You found a girl of your own, and I couldn’t be more proud. I just hope you and the sweet tender young maiden have a wonderful love story. Treat her with care. Just remember that love is fleeting and girls are fragile sensitive creatures.”

“Hey! You coming or what?” Kaylee called out to Christopher from down the hall.

“I’m coming! I have to go, Inigo.” Christopher nodded to Inigo and followed Kaylee. 

“Wha- you’re with..and.. She’s..?” Inigo was at a loss for words as Christopher walked side-by-side with the tallest babe in their class. He watched them walk off.

He put his hand on Hiro’s shoulder, who was just passing by. Inigo pointed at Christopher. “You see that brave soldier. I raised that boy. He’s shooting for the stars. I just hope his pelvis is strong enough.”  Inigo blew into a napkin. “Love bloomed. All that chess must’ve worked… I need to buy a chess set and learn how to play.”

Hiro frowned. It’s bad enough he had to sit next to Inigo. He had to run into him in the hallway too.

#####VI. Shiketsu Hero-Course Gardens

Inigo walked around the school a few times. He finally spotted Hoge sitting by herself near the hero-course gardens. She sat at a bench and was reading a large blue notebook. He crouched down and slowly approached her. He activated his quirk and Gigan transformed into an invisibility cloak around him. He got the idea from a fantasy wizard book. Light bends away from the fabrics making him undetectable to the nake- 

“I can see you.” Hoge looked up from reading and stared at him. 

“You can see through my invisibility cloak?”

“Baka. There’s no such thing.”

Gigan squeaked and snickered. Inigo narrowed his eyes at his construct. That’s the last time he takes one of Gigan’s ideas before bed. He was relieved he hadn’t gone to the girl’s locker room yet. 

“Come here.” Hoge scooted left and patted the spot next to her, she tilted her head to the side. Inigo stood up and sat next to her, he felt her head on his shoulder. She was reading again.

"You weren't responding to my texts. I was kinda worried."

Hoge didn't reply.

"You mad at me for skipping class? Not like I would've paid attention anyway."

Inigo glanced at her, Hoge was looking straight him. She grabbed his red tie and pulled him closer. She was kinda hot when she got all aggressive.

"No, but I did see you flying with Yui." Her eyes narrowed.

Inigo smirked. "You saw that huh? We were escaping from a fight, Hailey and Yui were about to go at it."

Hoge stared at him with those analyzing eyes. After a moment, she seemed to ease up and let go of his tie. 

Inigo smiled at her. They had met up a couple of times after their first date in the cafe three weeks ago. They would listen to music together, and she'd often ask him questions about villains and the Yakuza business, it eventually evolved into them just asking about random things to each other. He was, according to Hoge, solemnly sworn to tell nothing but the truth, but Inigo was just happy to have such a cute girl to talk to. He snapped out of his train of thought; Hoge had just asked him about his family.

"Back home, well it's kinda complicated. My father runs the family business and my brothers have their own branches. My eldest brother wants me as a pawn, my other brother, the one that attacked us, I'm pretty sure he wants me dead if he's allowed, and my father hadn't spoken to me for 8 years. All of them hate me," Inigo grinned, seeing the worried look she was giving him. 

He inched over, reached down and took her hand in his. She didn’t seem to react to the fact that they were now holding hands. Although her hand was unusually warm and her quirk made her harder to directly focus on.

"All and all it's not too bad. Oh yeah and I have Gigan." 

Gigan squeaked and did a twirl in the air. What a little show off.

"What about you?"

"My father works at an office, and my mother stays at home. They email me occassionally to check up on me. I don't have much to say about them. They live ordinary lives, and keep my bank account topped off." She looked down.

"I'd give anything for a normal typical family. Just a small happy one who don't try to murder each other. You think your parents would like me?"

Hoge shrugged. "Maybe."

"Can I have your dad's email?"

"Hm?"

"I gotta ask for permission right? That's what Hifumi's gonna do. Get the family blessing! We could get both our families together." Inigo chuckled.

"Baka." Hoge turned away, and she adjusted herself so that the official-looking blue notebook she was reading hid half her face from him. Was she blushing? He leaned back as she read, and watched Gigan chasing a squirrel in a tree.

“Whacha’ reading?”

“The new security procedures. I took it from Localoca’s desk. It’s what she’s supposed to teach us.”

“So you stole it.” Inigo grinned. “That’s pretty dangerous, miss class rep.”

“I'll return it once I've memorized it. I’ll be more prepared if I read it directly. In the event of an emergency, I can advise and lead the class more effectively. This knowledge is vital and should not be taught with puppets. ."

“Y’know by telling me that, you’ve made me a culprit right? We’re partners in crime now.” 

“You wouldn’t turn me in. It’s another secret to add to our list.”

“Why would I, now I have power over the class rep. Think of what I could do with that power. Uh.. what can you do anyway?”

“I’m in charge of taking our completed worksheets to Rosethorn-sempai.”

“Mwuahaha! I want to read all the worksheets before you turn them in, or else.”

“So blackmail. So terrible. What if I refuse, will you reveal my crime?”

“Only if you don’t do what I say. Now be a good girl okay?” He winked and squeezed her hand.

Hoge turned to him and leaned in, her face was offly close to his. She looked up at him.

“What should I do, master?” She gave him a cute look.

 Inigo’s heart nearly jumped out of his chest. 

His face turned red. He turned away. “H-h-hey I’m no snitch. I’m just kidding..”

Hoge’s face turned red as well, she turned the other way. “M-me too.”

They sat there quietly for a minute, awkwardly lost in their own thoughts.

*Damn. Did I screw up? What was I supposed to say to that? We’re at school… If we were in my bedroom or at the beach it’d be different. We haven't even kissed yet. That was way too hot. She’s getting too dangerous.*

“Hey, you wanna go back to class?”

"Yes. We should go."

"You want to hold hands on the way back?"

"Okay."

As the two walked back to their classroom, a black cat passed by. Inigo watched the gray skies up ahead, they didn't seem as gloomy now.

#####Bonus (After Credit Scene) - Shiketsu Southern Woods Trail
>Song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu5TDEpAqwQ

The trail wound through the forest, going through deep ravines and irregularly-shaped trees. The only rule was no flying, you could hover a few feet, but you couldn't fly all the way up.

Sora used his gravity quirk to rush pass the others, he could fling himself at high speeds but he had some trouble turning and dealing with obstacles. The hooded boy wall-ran his way forward as they passed through a small stone tunnel. Victor was wrapped in a wave of water, he used his water-controlling quirk to push himself at great speeds. Inigo sped forward behind Sora. He was inside a bubble formed by his construct, he formed pinball springs on surfaces that launched him through the trail. Sen didn't worry about obstacles. The train mutant rushed forward breaking branches at breakneck speeds. He was incredible when the trail was straight.

The four would-be heroes were neck-to-neck. They were close to the finish line now.

Suddenly, Victor took the lead, riding on a large wave!

Sora: Doesn't that idiot even know this trail.. After this slow ride is a sharp left!

Sen: There's a ravine on the other side, he's gotta hit the breaks!

Victor got even faster. VROOOOOOOOWWWROOOOMM!!

Sora: I knew it! That freakin' idiot is going way too fast!

Inigo: There's no room to slow down, he's going into that guard rail!

Sen and Inigo: WHOA!?

Sora: What the HELL?!

Instead of slowing down, Victor increased his speed, a wall of water propelled him sideways in a perfect arc.

All three: WATER INERTIA DRIFTO!?

Victor grinned and waved at the others as he finished the race to an easy win. 

Victor: Ha! I get to pick the restaurant! I pick sushi!

Inigo: We always get sushi..

The three of them sighed and followed Victor.
