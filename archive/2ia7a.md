She's a low priority target, since she's exceptionally powerful for her species and has proven to be able to enchant women too, but is content with just feeding herself. Her ability, Passion, allows her to extract information from any target she has recently engaged in sexual activity. Despite her reluctance to kill, we remind employees that she's still a succubus and thus, is draining life force. 
Danger Level: F
Observations: There is a chance she might expose the world to demons if she's not checked, but aside from that she's a harmless creature who takes care of not draining too much. Currently disguising herself as a school nurse, strings were pulled so she was assigned to a school filled with abnormal individuals. Succubus are easily dealt with gunfire

For the spidergod, humanity is a plague and she will kill without hesitation. While her true body is not able to cross the veil, her divine intervention prevents Akai haato from all harm. This includes all of the hosts attempts at suicide, since she seems to relish in their despair
Danger Level: SS
Observations: She cannot sustain her possesion from long periods of time, so should she cross into our world, a strike team is to confront her until her time is up.

Description: Nekomata Okayu is a reincarnated Nekomata and not a Kemono with Cat traits. Her ability in itself, is what allowed her to reincarnate after her death as a cat. She lives in the facilities and personnel is allowed to pet her
Danger Level:  Non-Combatant
Observations: While Okayu acts like a cat, she can and SHOULD consent to anything she's asked to.  Getting Assaulted by Korone is the adequate punishment. Okayu has inherited the same weaknesses as us humans, so she's easily dealt with

Observations:  Its believed that Koseki is not a truly evil being, but the constant abuses by the humans of the world has cornered her. We theorize that destroying her in direct combat, and then crushing her core, will be enough to kill her

Name: Nerissa Ravencroft
Ability: Symphony of Agony
Description: Last survivor of the Ravencroft family, and a exceptionally strong Banshee. Her family's antagonism against HoloCORP, which ended the life of them,  has fueled her vengeance. While initially contained and awaiting execution, she was freed and is now part of ADVENT. Her sound magic, razor sharp feathers and blinding speed make her a formidable adversary
Danger Level: A
Observations: It seems that she's focused on ending Kiara's life, once and for all, since she was the one who ordered her family's execution. Despite her magic prowes, metahumans could deal with her

Name: Cerberus Abyssgard
Ability:  "Never one, without the other"
Description: Cerberus was the guardian of Hell who revolted against her masters.  As a punishment,She was split into three different entities (Fuwawa,Mococo and Pero Abyssgard) and sent to guard the containment unit. In there, she took contact with ADVENT and collaborated in the escape, deserting from her post
Danger Level: C (B)
Observations: While she can reform for short periods of time, every part of her its a decent fighter on their own, specially in group fights since they can all coordinate their brains. Isolating and killing them one by one would deal with them

Name: Shiori Novella
Ability:  "It. Is. Watching." - "The book of Revelation"
Description:  An acolyte of "It who watches", Shiori Novella wishes to plunge the world into her master's embrace. Her ability allows her create eyes that relay information to her, altough she has to concentrate on them. For the sake of her master, she has orchestrated a jailbreak, created ADVENT and even stole "The Book of Revelation"
Danger Level: S (C)
Observations: While Shiori herself is not as dangerous, her cunning patron and the stolen book more than compensate. The book is an anomaly that allows to summon 12 different creatures, which change  depending on who's holding the book"
Shiori's known ones are the following

Number 1: Yorick, the silent companion

Number 3: Moirai, the Scissors wielding ghost

Number 8: El Cid, The champion of the peninsula

Number 12: NovelKnight, The servant the queen loved

Employing a third party that Shiori doesnt know could easily get her assasinated, granted that her location is first confirmed

Name: Laplus Darkness
Ability: "The Great King of Terror"
Description:  Following the events of the year 1999, The invading Great King of Terror was sucessfully imprisioned in the body of a young child, at the cost of two godkilling weapons: "The fan of Cao Cao" and "The curved saber of the South Liberator". Laplus is to be sedated every 20 hours, power dampners to be re-energized every 15 hours and a "Nietzche's Tetrahedron" is to be fielded every two days. Failure to comply any of these demands, protocol "Awakening" is to be enacted. Then, all personnel responsable should be executed and the king to be relocated
Danger Level: SSS
Observations: Without the measures listed above, the King of Darkness would engulf the world in darkness. Currently, her generals are scouring the world, in search of their master. We are still researching a way to sucessfully dispose of the King

Name:  Sakamata Chloe
Ability: "The King's Assasin: Total Eclipse"
Description:  Sakamata Chloe is one of the four generals of the king and an artificial being created by Hakui Koyori. Her ability allows her to teleport and move through shadows. Dr Hakui's creation has been injected with Orca DNA, meaning that she's also able to breathe underwater and to feel blood
Danger Level: A+
Observations: Assume every shadow compromised when engaging with the Asassin. Teams of two or more Metahumans are the only ones allowed to engage with her. It is imperative that captured agents commit suicide before giving away information

Name: Kazama Iroha
Ability: "The King's Executioner: Mugetsu"
Description:  Descendant of the Original Kazama Clan, Iroha is a metahuman who has mastered the art of the blade beyond even metahuman levels. While not outright murderous like her peers, she's still one of the King's General. Her ability can only be activated in One on One duels, and supresses abilities and supernatural factors, then either dampens or elevates Iroha's powers to match her enemies. This forces both parties to fight in equal ground. To this day, Kazama Irohas has yet to lose
Danger Level: A (S)
Observations: Even without her ability, she's capable of cutting through a small army by herself. It is advised that Metahumans engage her in teams. failure to do so, it is advised to retreat and regroup with other agents.

Name: Hakui Koyori
Ability: "The King's Alchemist: Abiogenesis"
Description:  Hakui Koyori is, perhaps, the biggest mind humanity has seen in Millenia. Her ability allows her to construct life, altough the science of it is an enigma to everyone that isnt her. Her absolute lack of morals and obsession with creating the next step in evolution, crowning herself as a god, has led her to serve the King of terror. It is advised that she's captured alive, in hopes to extract her knowledge before her execution
Danger Level: S (Non-Combatant)
Observations: While DR.Hakui is a non combatant, her bodyguards are among the toughest and most loyal servants of the King. If capturing her alive isnt posible, retrieving her head will become a top priority

Name: Takane Lui
Ability: "The King's Taskmaster: Imperial Decree"
Description:  Takane Lui is the leader of the Generals and theorized to be the one who orchestrated his incursion in our realm. Loyal to her master to the point of Obsession, she uses her ability to mentally bind people to her will. Normal Humans and Kemonos are enslaved for life, while Metahumans are able to resist up to a degree. If Takane Lui is spotted, it is advised to face her in groups of 3 or more Metahumans
Danger Level: SS
Observations: Her ability's range isnt global, but slaves will carry her orders even if she leaves. Currently, the leaders of Morocco, Spain, Korea and Canada are compromised. Staging coups, electoral frauds and scandals will take time, but it will tighten the net around her and her fellow generals.
