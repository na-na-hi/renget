Outlines/Reference (Delete when completed):
Characters:
Meowstic (Lliam), Explorer/Resercher Supporter
Skiddo (Unknown so I have to make shit up). Transport
Ribombee (Booker), he is the one to write a report on this expedition. Either on Sneasel's head or ride on one of her bags. 
Sneasel (Booker's partner) comes with Booker, the lead of the group. 
Mareep (Macom), for light source and research on the new passage.
Vulpix (Nick), gives directions for Skiddo to pick the group up when they're done exploring.

Plot outline:
-Investigating Crystal cave rumors of an abandoned location. 
-While traveling, some interaction
-Go through the dark passge
-Enter a separate mystery dungeon or Crystal Cave depths (?)
-Maybe get lost a bit until Macom notices they're going in circles 
-Made it at the end and a forest can be seen beyond
-Booker is riding or wants to be on Snesel's head to have a clear view of the ruins 
-At a brief second, Booker disappeared, only a strong gust of wind can be felt. (Booker got kinapped by a Drakloak) PokeDex Reference: Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it'll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy. 
>\>Ribombee-anon here. Question: I assume Drakloak isn't a feral. If she's civilized, why is she in the dungeon? Does she live there, or is she just visiting the dungeon for some reason?
>\>She lives at a small cottage near Crystal Cave. The ruins itself is related to a Dragapult Legend where those who waits patiently at the temple (now ruins), a friend, a friend that will never leave your side will show up before you, and she waited for a very long time and finally, a Dreepy shows up. But they were suddenly go and she went mad, flying all over the place until she found Booker. This is where Booker uses his aura abilities to locate Dreepy but idk when he actually learn that
-Go through another mystery dungeon in the ruins while sneasel is feeling uneasy as times goes on(careful on this part because might be off character)
>\>Sneasel usually hides her fear and acts tough, but she would genuinely be concerned if Booker's in danger. So even though she wouldn't like to admit it, she would feel uneasy here. That's in-character.
>\>Okay~ thanks for confirming that!
-encounters a salamence on one of the floors
-Sneasel recklessly fights it because it's blocking their way, Lliam replaces all his moves with supporting moves to aid Sneasel (Replaced moves: 
Light Screen, Reflect, Misty Terrain, Protect)
    Something side or a separate entry, don't know where to place: 
    -Booker will be frozen in fear by Drakloak but tries to be friendly with booker and eventually softens up
    -Then Booker convinces Drakloak to find dreepy
    -Found the culprit and chase after Morpeko
-Defeats Salamence but was revived by a Reviver Seed and Sneasel is exhausted
-Lliam steps in and was called out he only has support moves
-Make it subtle as possible (that's why I made Macom the pov on this story), Lliam knew who that salamence and Morpeko is
>\>will this be explained in the story or left as a mystery? And I mentioned in thread, I think 3rd person POV is best so we can jump over to Booker and see what he's doing
>\>Yeah, going 3rd person is best on this story. For this, it will remain a mystery as I planned to keep it only snippets on who Lliam is. I had 4 more stories planned the revolves around the guild and Lliam and if those who paid attention can paint a picture what he is. Idk I'm trying to be quirky instead of directly showing his origin story lol
-Quickly tries to silence them by bringing out a wand with a badge attacted to it
-Used Reflect to reflect his wand's attacks, like a mirror around them, Light Screen to amplify the strength of the attack if it passes through it (got that idea from a certain pokemoba game), Protect as a shield and Mist terrain as a smoke bomb. 
-Knowing they're strong, Lliam sneakily throws a Escape orb next to them and they accidentally activate it (crushed or something) and force retreat
-Sneasel and Booker reunite and so does Dreepy and Drakloak
-insert cheesy dialogue idk
-Meet up with skiddo and nick, asking what took them so long and travel back home as sunsets

or something like that, maybe change later or so. 

Character related:
Sneasel dialogue samples: “Hey, Booker, this looks good. Waterfall Cave is pretty close by. And the reward’s decent, I guess. You can never have too many Pure Seeds.”
“Don’t worry, I can handle it. And I’ve actually visited that dungeon before. Even if this Golem is strong, it’s the only thing that’ll give us trouble. The common ferals in that cave are easy to beat. I say we do it." 
"Y’know,” Sneasel interrupted, “I’ve got a question for you, too: do you ever stop talking?”
“W-well, I wasn’t excited about the music itself! I was excited to see Meloetta, okay? She’s world-famous! Even if I don’t like music, I wasn’t gonna pass up the chance to see her!”
“Yeah. That’s the way to get in. I hate it. And obviously, you can’t stay on my head during that, Booker. How about you hide in my bag? Can you fit?”
“Now what?” Sneasel asked. “That armor is way too strong. It’s like that stupid Exeggutor’s shield, from back in the forest. Why is this so tough?”

Sneasel info: Booker acts as a voice of reason to temper her hasty/aggressive tendencies. She is headstrong and overconfident.
                     She dislikes strategizing and prefers the straightforward approach. She can go berserk if pressured enough.
                     She is kind and has a good heart deep down, but tries to hide it beneath a blunt and sarcastic attitude.
                     She knows the moves Ice Shard (her main attack), Scratch, Taunt, and Quick Attack.
(^ can also create supercold mist around claws to freeze the surface of things she touches. quick attack = she dashes so fast she's invisible, and slices her enemy while dashing)
                     They call each other partner. 
(^ But not all the time)

Booker dialogue samples: “Um... please wait a second,” I said to Taillow. “I’m curious about the description. It says ‘Waterfall Cave — Echo Chamber’. I’ve heard of Waterfall Cave before, but what’s the Echo Chamber?”
                                          “So you think we should take it?” I asked. “A Golem sounds tough. I know you’re a strong fighter, but let’s not get in over our heads.” 
                                         “But this song just saved you, y’know,” I said. “It distracted the Golem.”
                                         “I’m not sure this will work,” I said. “Just... be ready if it attacks back.”
                                         “Stay calm!” I shouted. “Focus! Watch the attack, and move just enough to evade it. Don’t overdo it. And as soon as you dodge one move, aim and throw before it attacks again!”
                                          “Sneasel!” I shouted. “H-hang in there!”

Booker info: he becomes more confident when he's with his partner, Sneasel. Away from her, he reverts to a more withdrawn and docile persona. He often freezes up when pressured or scared. He is empathetic, and wants to help those in need.

Macom dialogue sample: "Lliam. I found it. It is about a two day travel from Capim town. I suggest sending a team because of the Mystery Dungeons along the way. I personally volunteer to go to better map the area out. I will leave the planning to you."

>Macom's additions
>"We are entering unknown territory, Stay together and we will get out of this together. Understood?" "Uh Booker, this is the wrong map." Imagine a sort of gruff, but caring vocal tone. Adam from Metroid Other M kind of tone. *(God that game was so bad but the Voice Acting for Adam is pretty fitting)*

>Macom moveset: Charge+Discharge link. Power Gem, Tail Glow *(WHY ISN'T THIS ACTUALLY ON THE MAREEP LINE? IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE)* Will keep most moves in reserve until necessary. 
Lmao ikr.

Macom info: While more reserved than quiet he speaks only if he needs to, indicating some sort of older wisdom. Outside of his research he can be gruff, but it just shows that he cares in his own way. He tends to build electricity when stressed or angered, but it is a rare sight to see either. (<- May or may not use during story) 
                    I remembered him saying , "About a partner. I used to have a partner once. His name was Siggy. I hope he does not think of me a failure anymore." is this still canon?
>Macom Comment: *Very much so.*
Vulpix info: Very formal and on guard usually, but willing to be more casual with people as he gets to know them better. Has a tendency to overthink and overanalyze things.


I think I'll write this one last, I had other 4 writings I had to do
