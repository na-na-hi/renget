#### Sunny September Monday

*Yoshikawa Hospital, 13:00 PM.*

I shuffle through the entrance, shrugging one shoulder to adjust my backpack.

The receptionist looks away from her screen and smiles at me. "Good afternoon. How can I help you?"

"Good afternoon," I echo, bowing slightly to her. "I'd like to visit a patient."

"Name?"

"Orochi Atsushi. She was admitted here yesterday," I add as she looks in the hospital's database.

She winces slightly at that detail. "Are you her family?" she asks. Judging by the look she gives my Shiketsu uniform, she knows the answer already.

I shake my head. "Classmate... is there a problem with that?"

"Sort of. We normally only allow guests after a certain period—which has passed. But we also need confirmation from Atsushi-san or her parents."

I see. Orochi probably hasn't gotten the time to approve this because she was resting from the attack yesterday.

"Oh, don't worry!" she urges as my shoulders slump. "We can send someone to her room so she can fill out the paperwork, and then you can go."

That's good news, but... It's already 13:00 PM.

"He won't have enough time."

A deep voice echoes my concerns before I can speak up.

I turn my head reflexively, glancing at the man approaching the receptionist.

Tall. Blue-haired. Wearing an expensive suit. Young, but still older than me.

"Yuusei Atsushi," he introduces himself, sliding an ID over the balcony with a composed smile. "I'm here to visit Orochi too."

"O-Of course, right away." The receptionist seems flustered by his arrival, but it only lasts a moment before she starts logging his visit to the terminal.

"I'm also bringing two guests," he says, and I finally notice the woman stepping behind him. "Kalianne Sato, and..."

He glances at me. "Imai Soujyuuro. Right?"

I nod.

Does he know me because of the tournament or because Orochi mentioned me?

... I'm not sure which one I would prefer.

After we're registered as visitors, we walk to Orochi's room, and I try not to stare at them too much.

Yuusei Atsushi. Orochi's cousin. Seiryu. He is... friendlier than I expected.

And the one walking alongside him... Honoken, I think her hero name is. She's supposed to be his sidekick, but considering she's here, they must be more than simply coworkers.

Sato catches me looking and grins at me, making a peace sign.

"I'm glad Orochi has such caring friends, but you should have more patience," Yuusei-san comments. "Unless things changed since last year, you only have 20 minutes before the 5th period starts."

I scratch my neck nervously. "I know. I'm not planning on skipping class or anything. I... I wanted to check on her, that's all..."

Almost everyone in 1-D wanted to after Rosethorn-sensei made that dreadful homeroom announcement. We know she can regenerate herself, but an attack like that leaves more than physical wounds.

I was just the first one to finish my lunch and come here. Most of the class will probably wait until classes end.

Sato tilts to the side, bumping her shoulder on Yuusei-san's arm. "Stop bothering him, Yuusei. If you didn't want him here, you wouldn't have signed him as a guest."

He rolls his eyes at her, then blinks in surprise when I nod in gratitude.

"Thanks for that."

"No problem. As I said, I'm glad you're here. Orochi will be, too."

He enters her room first, with Sato following behind.

As I cross the door, Orochi throws her phone aside and jumps from her bed, smiling brightly at her cousin.

"Yuusei...!" she cries out, giving him a crushing hug. Her tails surge from behind her, showering him with attention.

"Hey," he greets softly, patting the small of her back. "You're looking a lot better."

She nods a few times. "Hm-hm. The doctor said I was fully healed, but I still need physical therapy for a week... because of all the nerve damage."

Her voice lowers slightly at the end.

"... Don't worry, you'll make a full recovery. The staff might even let you out ahead of time."

"Ahh... I really hope they do. I don't think I can stay a week cooped up in here, even with Dad, Mom, and you visiting—"

She stops. Her tails got bored of poking her cousin and started looking around, so she finally noticed there were more people in the room.

"It's not just our family that wants to see you," Yuusei-san tells her, breaking their hug.

I wave at her somewhat awkwardly.

"Imai? You ditched class to come here?"

"Uh, no... it's lunch break right now."

"Oh, right, right... you ditched lunch with Ashleigh to come here?"

"No..."

She is weirdly cheerful for someone in her situation. She's always been an upbeat girl... but I was prepared to see a new side of her when I entered this hospital.

Is she putting on a smile for us? Or did she really bounce back that easily?

Sadly, I'm not close enough to her to tell.

"I'm feeling like chopped liver over here," Sato-san jokes as Orochi releases me.

"Don't say that. I've been dying to meet you since you started working with Yuusei!"

"Heh, I know, I'm just pulling your leg. Kalianne Sato, nice to meet ya."

"Orochi Atsushi, the feeling's mutual."

Sato-san reaches up to bump Orochi's fist, then frowns. Her gaze goes to Yuusei-san, looking him up and down. "... why is everyone in your family so tall?"

Huh.

She's right. I didn't notice it at first because sharing a space with Kaylee has numbed me to this sort of thing.

The older cousin shrugs in response, walking past us and sitting on an armchair.

"Can you actually play anything with hospital connection?" he wonders, looking between Orochi and her bed.

The white-haired girl freezes in place, eyes widening as she remembers what she was doing before we popped up.

Her eyes go to the bed. Then, to the tail using her phone like a chew toy. And finally, to the screen, which has faded black with a message signaling her loss. Her opponent has already left the lobby with her points.

What a shame... she was about to enter her promos, too...

"So..." Orochi drawls, "How are things on the outside world?"

She's sitting on her bed with her legs tucked while we occupy the chairs around her.

"Shiketsu's a mess," I say. "I saw at least twenty parents going in and out of Karaburan-sensei's office to threaten to pull their kids out."

Orochi groans at that. "Buncha idiots."

"The news outlets are painting you as the valiant hero-in-training who held off an S-Rank villain," Yuusei-san explains. "Father and I pulled some strings to keep them from getting near the hospital, but you'll still get called to a bunch of interviews once you leave."

Pulled some strings... it's one thing to hear about the Atsushi family, but seeing it in action is something else.

Orochi takes a moment to process the information, then nods. "Thanks for holding them off. If I saw one of them from the windows, I'd throw something at them."

Her cousin huffs in amusement. "I know."

There's a lull in the conversation... an elephant in the room. A piece of information Orochi should probably know, but we're not sure how—if we should tell her.

Feral's whereabouts.

Yuusei-san doesn't say anything, so I follow his cue.

Hopefully, it's the right move.

"Any good news?" Orochi asks, no longer smiling. "C'mon... you guys are bumming me out..."

"Inigo said he'd bring a console for you when he visits," I blurt out.

"Heh. Nice," Orochi murmurs, pumping a fist, then glaring at her cousin.

"Oi, Yuusei, how come you didn't bring me anything?"

He tosses her a small but thick book.

... I hadn't even realized he'd been carrying that the entire time. One Earth, One Chance, the title says. It's probably a novel.

Orochi cracks it open, and a... chocolate bar slips out of a page.

I remember seeing her eating this once during Hijack-sensei's class when he wasn't looking. I guess it's her favorite brand.

"Yuusei!" Sato-san gasps. "You're smuggling unhealthy food into a hospital?"

"What if it doesn't go well with my medication?" Orochi plays along. Her tails don't get the memo, reaching for the bar to bite through the wrapping before she takes control of them.

"..."

Yuusei-san looks between his cousin and coworker, expression carefully blank.

"I might have made a mistake letting you two meet," he says softly.

The two girls nod at him, then at each other. Their coordination is kind of scary, considering this is their first time face-to-face.

"I'll give you family stories of Yuusei..."

"... And I'll give you the gossip from his student and pro-hero life."

They shake hands.

Good luck, Yuusei-san. Good luck.

Ah...

"... Can you tell us about your provisional license exam?"

All eyes turn to me.

This is excellent timing. The exam is in a few weeks, and having firsthand accounts from two Shiketsu alumni would go a long way.

"Hehe~" Sato-san chuckles. "I could tell you about mine, but I'm not sure if you'll wanna hear about Yuusei's side."

"Eh? Why not?" Orochi asks, quirking an eyebrow.

"Because I failed the initial test and got my license on the remedial."

"..."

"..."

"... Damn," Orochi breaks the silence. "I wasn't really interested in the exam story, but I changed my mind now. What did they make you guys do?"

"For the first stage, they thinned down our numbers," Yuusei-san begins. "Students from all academies were spread across urban simulation zones and told to fight each other under a timer. At least half of the participants in each arena had to be eliminated before the clock ran out, or else everyone there was disqualified."

"I just teamed up with the classmates I found and hunted down some U.A. scrubs until the time ran out. Easy win," Sato-san boasts, dusting off her hands.

"If the first section tested battle prowess, the second was about rescue and evacuation. This time, underground simulation zones meant to resemble caved-in buildings. We had to cooperate with the same people we might have fought to locate hired actors and take them to safety."

"That one was a bit harder," the woman concedes. "I got a lot of points docked off by how I used my fire underground. Still passed on the first try, though!"

Orochi and I focus on the blue-haired man, waiting for him to continue.

I'm not trying to embarrass him. Learning from another's failure is also valid, that's all.

"... For the first stage, I had the same idea as Kalianne. Try to find my classmates and win as a group. Unfortunately, they were all eliminated by a second-year before I got to them."

Yuusei-san smiles at us. "Do you two know Yoshizumi?"

We stare at him speechless after he namedrops the number four hero.

"Hold up... you fought Yoshizumi?!"

Even his sidekick is shocked.

He nods. "It was her second try on the test, and she wasn't happy about it. Even after taking down enough people to satisfy the timer, she still went after me."

"But... but you failed during the second stage. I saw you there!"

"I didn't want to take her on because it was unnecessary to pass," Yuusei-san continues, not addressing her. "But she was relentless. After a few minutes of flying around her, I realized I would be wasting more energy avoiding her than if we fought. So... we went at it. I managed to pin her down and knock her out but got eliminated in the next phase because I was too hurt to use my quirk properly."

"... Sheesh. I didn't know you and Yoshizumi had beef like that."

"We don't."

"So it was a U.A. versus Shiketsu thing?" Orochi asks, tilting her head. "I don't get it."

"Let me finish my story, you two... after the exam, she cornered me. I thought she was mad about losing to me, but she actually came to apologize. Apparently, using her quirk has some side effects on her emotional state. I could relate, so I forgave her."

Huh. Does Yuusei-san also get angry when he uses his quirk? 

I can't imagine anyone making it far as a pro hero with a weakness like that. Then again, Yoshizumi had to have improved since her student years, so she must have found a way to mitigate it. Maybe it's the same for him.

"Anyway, we got to know each other better and made up. Even helped each other out in the remedial."

*"Got to know each other...?"* Orochi repeats, eyebrows furrowing.

Sato-san crosses her arms. "I see... and you never mentioned this to me before because...?" 

Why do they sound so suspicious of him? It doesn't sound like he's lying.

"You know why. You were insufferable after the exams. Even nowadays, you're still ribbing me about it."

She chuckles nervously at that. "Ok, maaaybe I gloated a bit too much. Sorry."

His gaze lands on Orochi and me. "If you learn anything from this, let it be this. The provisional license exam makes you experience the cutthroat parts of pro heroism, whether you like it or not. Will you sacrifice other students to climb the ladder and get your license? Will you give up your chance for the sake of another? Find a third path? That's the biggest decision you have to make. Everything else is about putting into practice what Shiketsu teaches you."

This isn't much of a decision for me. I've been sticking to my path since I got this quirk. It's not going to change now.

"Thanks for the story, Yuusei-san, Sato-san," I say, leaving my seat and bowing to them. "... I have to run back to class now. Sorry, I couldn't bring you anything, Orochi."

"No problem, dude. See ya!"

"Good luck with your studies."

"When you pass the exam, send a resume to our agency!"

I grab my backpack, wave them goodbye, and leave the room.

I'm... not sure if I want to intern under their agency. It's nothing against them personally. It's just that picking an underground hero won't be good for my career.

But it's not like I can be picky about these things. Elite schools like Shiketsu put a limit on how many of their students each pro can take, so I'll be competing for spots not only with my classmates but also with classes 1-E, 2-D, 2-E, 3-D, 3-E... 

Hahh... I'll figure this out after I get my license. If I get it, that is.

For now, I'll be glad Orochi seems to be doing well.

"Anyway, thanks to the way Shiketsu organized battle training, we only got to do our first super-move together in like... July."

After Imai left, Orochi talked briefly about her stay in the hospital and the other patients she had met. Then, the two young women started trading stories in an attempt to embarrass Yuusei. Since Orochi was smiling, he didn't mind it.

"Huh. After all the convenient pairings we got in my class, I thought their team randomizers were just for show," Orochi admitted, pursing her lips.

"Maybe you just got lucky?" Kalianne guessed, shrugging. 

Considering everything this year, Yuusei wouldn't call 1-D lucky. But he didn't voice these thoughts.

"Or... they could be trying to hold back our combo, which makes sense. We had a 99% win rate!"

"What about the 1%?"

"Probably our first time," Yuusei told her. "She wouldn't stop moving on top of me—"

"Pfft—!" Orochi burst into chuckles.

"Almost fell off—"

"But I didn't!"

"And burned my costume trying to right herself," he finished, grinning.

"Ok, in my defense, I was only used to flying solo. And I apologized for the costume."

"Hey, I'm not judging. I'm just narrating how it went."

"Don't worry, Kalianne-san! You got a lot better at dragon-riding since then, haven't you?"

"You know it—!" she began, then noticed Orochi's wagging eyebrows. "Damn. This isn't as fun when I'm the target. Yuusei, help me!"

He nodded at her, giving her hope.

"Yeah, her technique improved a lot—"

"Stop the innuendo!"

They only had a few more minutes to talk before a nurse arrived to tell Orochi about her scheduled physical therapy session.

The white-haired girl sighed as the hospital staff left. "Thanks for coming by, guys."

"We'll be here tomorrow at the same time," Kalianne promised, giving her a thumbs up.

Yuusei didn't leave his seat. 

"Kalianne, you go ahead. I want to talk to her in private before we leave."

"Hm...? Sure." though confused, she agreed. "See ya, Orochi-chan!"

"Bye!"

She waved Kalianne on her way out before turning to her cousin. "She's fun. I like her."

"Me too."

"Uh-uh," she teased. "So, what did you want to talk about?"

He took a deep breath before answering with a question. "... Your father told you he's coming back from retirement, right?"

She nodded, smile dipping slightly.

"And Akane is moving to Kyoto."

Another nod.

"So... when you get your license, do you know which one you'll pick?"

"..."

"..."

Orochi stayed quiet, and he patiently waited for her answer.

"... honestly...? I'm not sure I'll even take the exam this year."

"Why do you feel that way?"

*How do you feel, Orochi?*

It was a question he'd wanted to ask since he came here, but never got the chance to.

She told him about how quickly she had healed and her physical therapy. What she did to pass the time in the hospital.

But she had avoided mentioning anything other than her physical health, most likely because of the other visitors.

"... I was so weak back there, Yuusei," she confessed, voice shaky. "A-And I know you'll say I should get stronger, and I plan to ask Father to train me when I get out, but... I don't think I'll be enough."

After a brush with death, her confidence was at rock bottom.

"From what I saw in the tournament, you're more than enough to pass."

Her head slumped at that, but he grabbed her chin, tilting her head to look her in the eyes. They told him that she didn't believe him. "You think I'm just trying to make you feel better, but it's true. You are strong, Orochi."

"But I—"

"You lost, but that only means you're not invincible. Like everyone else."

"..."

"You want to get stronger, right?"

She nodded.

"But your mind is stuck replaying that battle, so you can't visualize yourself winning, even against another student. You need to regain your image of strength. Your ideal self."

In a way, Orochi considered her previous self her ideal self. She was born strong and felt the need to use that strength to help others. That was her reason for entering Shiketsu. But Yuusei was right in saying Feral broke that self-image.

But how was she supposed to restore it? Even if she trained, even if she got stronger, how was she supposed to defeat that villain? Her quirk would catch up to any training she did.

"... How do I do that?" she asked, clinging to his shoulders almost desperately.

Yuusei smiled ruefully. "I can't tell you how to be yourself, Orochi. People can't change others like that."

Her mother certainly tried, and the result was a rift in their relationship.

"Your family, your friends, your teachers... they provide the environment for your growth. They'll be there whenever you take an important step in your recovery and warn you when you stray from the path you wanted."

Of course, there would also be those who tried to push her into their preferred paths. But she was a headstrong person. The only one in charge of her change was herself.

"... thanks, Yuusei. I'll try to think about things the right way... about what I want to be."

He got up, ruffling her hair. "Good. Just don't overdo it, alright? This sort of self-reflection can end in self-loathing pretty easily."

She hummed in affirmation.

They glanced at the door as a man in a lab coat entered the room. "Hey, Atsushi-chan, I'm here to oversee your physical—oh, am I interrupting?" he asked once he saw the scene.

Yuusei shook his head. "I was just about to leave, doctor."

He hugged Orochi one last time, exchanging parting words. However, before he could leave the room, she spoke.

"Also... if I pass the exam... I'm still picking your agency."

Her big sister would coddle her too much during an internship, and her father, while harsh during training, would also try to keep her from the action against villains. She would rely on her cousin to stick to their promise of working together at his place.

Yuusei looked at her, surprised yet flattered that she still chose him. A grin graced his lips as he reached for the door handle.

"I'm looking forward to it, Yamata."
