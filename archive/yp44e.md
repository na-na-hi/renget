>\>Be me
>\>Special Agent Gardevoir, G-007
>\>License to kill
>\>Member of the Secret Federation Forces
>\>Tasked with monitoring any and all human activities in Capim Town
>\>Despite saving the world numerous times, humans always made a mess of things
>\>Breaking into tombs and destroying ancient relics
>\>Thousands of Poke worth of merchandise stolen with Trawl Orbs
>\>Someone had to clean up the damage
>\>That’s where I came in
>\>Be surprised when an entire guild of humans arrives
>\>HQ says to ‘keep an eye on them’
>\>As if I can shadow dozens of humans
>\>Spend my time watching their guild hall

>\>Be me, a few months later
>\>More humans have arrived
>\>They cause mayhem
>\>One of them, a Meowth, keeps conning the local Pokemon
>\>One of the teams started a huge forest fire
>\>HQ is pissed at me
>\>Tell HQ to send more agents
>\>They oblige and say to start ‘taking care’ of the humans
>\>If they can’t be brought into custody, dispose of them
>\>Oh God
>\>HQ says to start with the psychics
>\>Oh fuck

>\>Be me, post bloodbath
>\>Human guild is mostly rounded up
>\>Some Ribombee and Sneasel team managed to escape
>\>We got the rest
>\>Either in jail, or in the ground 
>\>A few natives in the guild got roped into the purge
>\>Get a ‘promotion’ for my work
>\>Stuck guarding the humans
>\>Most of the captured ones were docile
>\>All but one

>\>Be walking through the jail
>\>Maximum security Federation prison
>\>Pass by the Cyndaquil’s cell
>\>He calls out to me
>\>”Hey Gardy! Are you sure you don’t want to come in here? I’ve been a very naughty boy!”
>\>Not this shit again
>\>I respond
>“If I have to come in there, I’m going to paint the walls with your gray matter.”
>\>”I didn’t peg you as a lady into guro, but I can swing it.”
>\>No idea what ‘goo-ro’ is.
>\>Remember seeing the Muchlax chef of the guild make something the humans called ‘gyros’
>\>Why was Cyndaquil talking about food?
>“If you want gyros, we don’t have any. If you’re hungry you’ll have to wait for the designated meal times.”
>\>”I’m not hungry, I’m thirsty. Desperately thirsty.”
>\>I walk over to check his cell
>\>His water bucket is full
>\>What?
>\>He keeps talking
>\>”So does the skirt come off, or is it part of your body?”
>\>Wish that HQ would let us liquidate the humans
>\>HQ wants to keep a few in reserve incase a world ending threat appeared
>\>But would they miss one?
>“I have been authorized to kill you if necessary.”
>\>The Cyndaquil lies flat on the floor, looking up at me
>\>Is he going to beg for mercy?
>\>”I see there’s a part in the front for easy access. Can you come a little closer? I can almost see up your skirt.”
>\>Quickly take a step back
>\>I look at the other cells
>\>None of them seem phased by this
>\>Walk over to an Oshawott and point at him
>“Has that Cyndaquil always been like this?”
>\>Oshawott nods
>“If you don’t get him to stop, I’m throwing you into his cell.”
>\>Oshawott thought for a moment before replying
>\>”That’s impossible.”
>“Then you’re sharing a cell with him.”
>\>”I refuse. I’d rather face the wall than share a cell with him.”
>\>There’s no way I could explain losing two humans to HQ
>\>Fuck
>\>Cyndaquil wins this round

>\>Be me, and have a plan
>\>Cyndaquil let slip he had a crippling fear of being restrained
>\>Jackpot
>\>Purchase a length of rope and a scarf
>\>HQ would look the other way on a little torture
>\>Barge into Cyndaquil’s cell
>\>He doesn’t resist as I tie him up
>“Not so tough now, are you? Filthy human!”
>\>It was hard to read his expression
>\>Stupid Cyndaquils and their beady eyes
>\>Not racist, just don’t like ‘em
>\>Finally he speaks
>\>”You think this’ll scare me? I can take whatever punishments you have in store for me!”
>\>So he wanted to do this the hard way
>\>Blindfold him and throw him onto the ground
>\>”Yes! Step on me Mistress!”
>\>What
>\>Hear the Oshawott from across the hall
>\>”If you’ve decided to get kinky with Cyndaquil, can you please take it somewhere else?”
>\>Hear murmurs of agreement from the other prisoners
>\>Kinky?
>\>Look back at Cyndaquil
>\>He’s blushing bright red
>\>He’s breathing heavily
>\>Fuck

>\>Be me, a fresh face in Post Town
>\>The prisoners blabbed to the other guards
>\>Coworkers started calling me ‘Mistress’
>\>Not dealing with that
>\>Quit
>\>No more secret agent for me
>\>Looking for work on the other side of the planet
>\>Meet up with some Honchkrow
>\>He wants to start an exploration team
>\>Said he blacked out while with his last team
>\>Woke up on a boat to the Mist Continent
>\>Probably bullshit, but I couldn’t be picky
>\>Agree to adventure with him
>\>He tips his hat when I do so
>\>Must be a Honchkrow thing
>\>We take a rescue request
>\>Keeps talking about Legendary Pokemon
>\>He wants to kill them
>\>Says it’ll usher in the age of science and atheism
>\>Whatever
>\>Carry him through the dungeon easily
>\>He tries to awkwardly flirt on the way back
>\>Tells me about his favorite ‘an-e-mays’
>\>Reminded of the humans in Capim Town
>\>Panic
>\>Was I cursed?
>\>Would every Pokemon I meet from now on be a human?
>\>Try to ignore Honchkrow talking about Bocchi the something or other
>\>Old instincts kick in
>\>I should stick around
>\>Just in case he’s like that guild
>\>I couldn’t live with myself if I let a human walk around unsupervised
>\>What if he was like Cyndaquil?
>\>I shuddered
>\>Like it or not, I was qualified for this job
>\>Pretend to be interested in whatever he’s talking about now
>\>He seems happy
>\>He wraps a wing around me
>\>Fuck
