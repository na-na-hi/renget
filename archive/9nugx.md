panel sitting on the table.

===========================================================================
#####->Green Forest<-

###### Slime Girl:
the very first Slime you meet serves as an introduction to capturing, so she doesn't actually put
up a fight. Hit her once, and she will stand up and offer a hug. Hit her again, and then two
more times, and she will stand up, dazed and ready for grabs.
Second Animation: in the Secret Garden, in the area with the many Caterpillar Girls, stay on the
low path from the entry, and move to the right until a dead end. Use double jump to get into a
hidden path within the wooden wall, and follow it until the end for the panel.

in her close vicinity, and if she starts to hold her abdomen with an aroused expression, quickly
free yourself and hit her, and she'll be ready for capture.

jingle will sound, and then, you can pocket the Gargoyle Girl.

###### Dark Bunny Girl (needs Wild Slash):
when you enter her room, hit the switch to the left to start the roulette. The monster shown will
then attack you, but with slight differences: Yamabiko will only throw hearts, the Slime Girl is
slow, but cannot be stunned, and the Bunny Girl is incredibly fast.
When the roulette shows the Dark Bunny Girl, a table will emerge from below, trapping you. Dodge
it, and hit it three times with the Wild Slash to crack it a bit. Now, let yourself get captured,
but break free from the table to stun and capture her.

on the table.

###### Six Butts:
the room with the six butts features a simple memory puzzle. Remember the order in which the buts
are shown on the center panel, and hit the switches accordingly. The first three rounds, you'll
have reasonable challenges for this, but on the fourth, the images flip through so rapidly that
it becomes almost impossible to follow. And you don't need to. Instead, jump up through a hole in
the ceiling that wasn't there before, and walk to the right to find a switch. Hitting it will
disable the room allow you to gather all six butts for yourself.
