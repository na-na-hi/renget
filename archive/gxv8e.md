Seconds
>you'd only meant the hotel room fucking dynamite be a one time thing
>Sonic had gotten under your skin
>you wouldn't let that happen again
>there was no way it would happen again
>just had to resist
>he wouldn't let up and your promise lasted only a few days
>less than a week
>the chase ended up throwing you both through a portal 
>what awaited you both on the other side was something he recognized
>his own world 
>you figured as much from seeing other furries walking around
>you had been pulled out of your own life on earth
>no more rent
>no more rush hour to work
>no more social media 
>no more power bills 
>no more groceries
>no more
>wait
>so maybe this was a blessing in disguise
>however, you stuck out like a sore thumb
>given most of the woodland critters here tended to be manlets
>you wondered why
>it didn't help that Sonic had been all over you since that hotel encounter
>slightlyâ€¦ chumier than friends
>you had to put some distance but he moved at light speed
>this was too out there
>you could count the number of days you were just a wagie cashier making ends meet on one hand
>now you were chest deep in some Looney Tunes animal world
>when you used the excuse you wanted to explore a little Sonic decided he'd be Lois to your Clark 
>you didn't bother correcting him, he was at least close enough there
>you'd only been in this village one day and he was all intent on following 
>he really was a drifter
>when you asked about family he got kind of quiet
>it was a side of him you'd never seen and you sort of regretted asking
>when you went to apologize he said it was OK and you decided to drop it
>you changed the subject and asked if there were humans out here like you
>"eh, sort of. not as fun as you though, big boy."
>thank God he said that last part out of earshot of anyone
>you didn't want to be labeled hedgehog fucker
>when you stiffened your back up at that he got his grin back
>"I saw that! so big boy does it for you? or do you want me calling you," he leaned up to get closer to your ear, "daddy."
>he said that last word with the most honeyed tone he could muster and you tried to think of how fascinating a nearby tree was
>he chuckled at that
>"looks like I touched a nerve. or touched something else."
>you pressed your hand to your temple and tried not to think about how close he was to you
>his usual attire of running shorts had been replaced with skin tight spats
>he said they were much more comfortable 
>you bet that was lies
>he hopped up and wrapped his arms around your neck
>his gloved fingers locked and you were aware how light he could be compared to you
>"kind of change for me riding you right?"
>you fucked once 
>and you finally pointed this out over your shoulder
>"you didn't have to follow me through that portal. I think you wanted to be here."
>he locked his legs around your waist for balance and kissed the back of your neck
>you could have reacted, shoved him off
>"going out on a limb here. somebody likes me~"
>he said that last bit in a sing song tone 
>you were initially silent but he was slowly getting his way
>"I bet you can feel how much I like you. these spats don't leave much to the imagination."
>dammit
>it was supposed to be one time only and he was definitely making that harder to stay that way
>welp 
>he was winning
>just like that hotel room
>your reluctance could only hold out for so long
>he was really good at wearing down your defenses and goddammit he knew it
>so you head out from the village into the wilderness
>you had barely been there a day before wanderlust had you both continuing your road trip
>just with no car
>you had to ask though
>just why was he hung up on you
>he couldn't have even known you were into him
>not that
>you were 
>hell, you could have turned him down at the hotel room
>"c'mon. you're going to turn this down?"
>he stuck his ass out and smacked it
>the smile on his face and the look in his eyes told you he was winning
>he wasn't accepting any sort of defeat here
>he snapped his fingers
>"I'll just have to sweeten the deal"
>he vanished and returned in the blink of an eye
>a shoulderless pink crop top now clung to his flat chest
>bicep length pink gloves replaced his old white ones
>his legs now covered by silky pink stockings
>and the spats were thrown into your hands
>where did he?
>"what's the matter, never seen a hedgehog in pink before?"
>fuck it
>he was still wearing pants until you two got privacy though
>you tossed the spats to him and told him to come on
>you weren't racing him through the woods despite his insistence 
>"but I thought you liked looking at my ass? you'd have a chance to see it a lot when I beat you"
>not racing through a forest
>your luck you'd trip and break your neck out here
>so you weren't taking his bait
>in fact you'd turn it around
>you told him you knew he was faster 
>at least from the hotel room 
>"cute. cute. so you did like it."
>oh dammit
>you tried denying the accusation 
>"you wouldn't be joking around if you didn't remember it. so round 2? 3?"
>you weren't fucking him in the woods
>"it's like nature's hotel room. probably cleaner."
>ok you laughed at that one
>did he do his quills back differently?
>there was a sleek downward curve to them now
>less aggressive punk and more 80s big hair
>where did he find hairspray?
>this world was weird as it was and you were sure your guide would make it weirder
