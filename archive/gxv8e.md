Seconds
>you'd only meant the hotel room fucking dynamite be a one time thing
>Sonic had gotten under your skin
>you wouldn't let that happen again
>there was no way it would happen again
>just had to resist
>he wouldn't let up and your promise lasted only a few days
>less than a week
>the chase ended up throwing you both through a portal 
>what awaited you both on the other side was something he recognized
>his own world 
>you figured as much from seeing other furries walking around
>you had been pulled out of your own life on earth
>no more rent
>no more rush hour to work
>no more social media 
>no more power bills 
>no more groceries
>no more
>wait
>so maybe this was a blessing in disguise
>however, you stuck out like a sore thumb
>given most of the woodland critters here tended to be manlets
>you wondered why
>it didn't help that Sonic had been all over you since that hotel encounter
>slightly… chumier than friends
>you had to put some distance but he moved at light speed
>this was too out there
>you could count the number of days you were just a wagie cashier making ends meet on one hand
>now you were chest deep in some Looney Tunes animal world
>when you used the excuse you wanted to explore a little Sonic decided he'd be Lois to your Clark 
>you didn't bother correcting him, he was at least close enough there
>you'd only been in this village one day and he was all intent on following 
>he really was a drifter
>when you asked about family he got kind of quiet
>it was a side of him you'd never seen and you sort of regretted asking
>when you went to apologize he said it was OK and you decided to drop it
>you changed the subject and asked if there were humans out here like you
>"eh, sort of. not as fun as you though, big boy."
>thank God he said that last part out of earshot of anyone
>you didn't want to be labeled hedgehog fucker
>when you stiffened your back up at that he got his grin back
>"I saw that! so big boy does it for you? or do you want me calling you," he leaned up to get closer to your ear, "daddy."
>he said that last word with the most honeyed tone he could muster and you tried to think of how fascinating a nearby tree was
>he chuckled at that
>"looks like I touched a nerve. or touched something else."
>you pressed your hand to your temple and tried not to think about how close he was to you
>his usual attire of running shorts had been replaced with skin tight spats
>he said they were much more comfortable 
>you bet that was lies
>he hopped up and wrapped his arms around your neck
>his gloved fingers locked and you were aware how light he could be compared to you
>"kind of change for me riding you right?"
>you fucked once 
>and you finally pointed this out over your shoulder
>"you didn't have to follow me through that portal. I think you wanted to be here."
>he locked his legs around your waist for balance and kissed the back of your neck
>you could have reacted, shoved him off
>"going out on a limb here. somebody likes me~"
>he said that last bit in a sing song tone 
>you were initially silent but he was slowly getting his way
>"I bet you can feel how much I like you. these spats don't leave much to the imagination."
>dammit
>it was supposed to be one time only and he was definitely making that harder to stay that way
>welp 
>he was winning
>just like that hotel room
>your reluctance could only hold out for so long
>he was really good at wearing down your defenses and goddammit he knew it
>so you head out from the village into the wilderness
>you had barely been there a day before wanderlust had you both continuing your road trip
>just with no car
>you had to ask though
>just why was he hung up on you
>he couldn't have even known you were into him
>not that
>you were 
>hell, you could have turned him down at the hotel room
>"c'mon. you're going to turn this down?"
>he stuck his ass out and smacked it
>the smile on his face and the look in his eyes told you he was winning
>he wasn't accepting any sort of defeat here
>he snapped his fingers
>"I'll just have to sweeten the deal"
>he vanished and returned in the blink of an eye
>a shoulderless pink crop top now clung to his flat chest
>bicep length pink gloves replaced his old white ones
>his legs now covered by silky pink stockings
>and the spats were thrown into your hands
>where did he?
>"what's the matter, never seen a hedgehog in pink before?"
>fuck it
>he was still wearing pants until you two got privacy though
>you tossed the spats to him and told him to come on
>you weren't racing him through the woods despite his insistence 
>"but I thought you liked looking at my ass? you'd have a chance to see it a lot when I beat you"
>not racing through a forest
>your luck you'd trip and break your neck out here
>so you weren't taking his bait
>in fact you'd turn it around
>you told him you knew he was faster 
>at least from the hotel room 
>"cute. cute. so you did like it."
>oh dammit
>you tried denying the accusation 
>"you wouldn't be joking around if you didn't remember it. so round 2? 3?"
>you weren't fucking him in the woods
>"it's like nature's hotel room. probably cleaner."
>ok you laughed at that one
>did he do his quills back differently?
>there was a sleek downward curve to them now
>less aggressive punk and more 80s big hair
>where did he find hairspray?
>this world was weird as it was and you were sure your guide would make it weirder

>as you walked you tried to make conversation that didn't tie to sex
>anything but that right now
>he was trying really hard to bring it back to that
>but you insisted on steering away from it
>at least for now
>the woods were a small trek
>really reminded you of up northwest back on earth
>strange to think that way
>just in a totally alien environment 
>and this alien lifeform was dressed in a skintight outfit trying to get your dick
>this is your life
>circular conversations about what lovely weather this was wasn't cutting it with Sonic
>he could tell you were blatantly stalling and you knew he knew
>so why did you keep up the charade?
>maybe you were nervous about such a massive upheaval in your life
>it wasn't like you couldn't eventually get back
>maybe
>granted, what was there for you?
>you'd seen this genre of fiction before, all the thrown into a fantasy world stuff
>instead of elves and dragons and you being an instant expert on something you were surrounded by animal people
>Sonic decided to be playful and walked ahead backwards
>his arms rested behind his head as he casually tried to steer you over to his point of view
>he wasn't even coy or vague about his words
>"I mean we could talk about clouds all day. we could. or, and here's an idea, we bang."
>you were really curious where he learned everything he did
>"I flipped through your smart phone super fast while we were on the run." 
>oh goddammit 
>so that means…
>he instantly picked up the look on your face
>"yes I know about the folder"
>you tried to play it off
>he was clearly mistaken
>a joke
>yeah
>haha
>"you have an image labeled buttsluts 13 and it features two guys in cheerleader outfits."
>his memory was surprisingly good
>"question is… where were the last 12 buttsluts?"
>you didn't get it and he sighed
>"I'm joking. sort of. before you destroyed that phone I got a good look at human culture."
>he leaned his back against a tree and slowly waved an arm out towards you
>"apparently, earth culture involves thigh high stockings. who knew?"
>you realized the outstretched hand was meant to present you once more with his new wardrobe 
>the smile returned to his face when he knew he was winning the debate
>fine
>you were called out
>fine
>"see. was that so hard? I knew you wanted it."
>you did kind of quickly surrender in that hotel room
>"only difference between those buttsluts and this buttslut is this bullslut is real."
>please stop saying buttslut
>"buttslut"
>you weren't winning that debate either
>"I guess you'll have to come over here and shut me up."
>he wagged a finger at you
>then an epiphany 
>he just had a brilliant idea and you didn't like that one bit
>"I'll just have to play hard to get. Buttslut."
>he just vanished in a blink
>again
>how the fuck were you supposed to catch something almost as fast as a jet when he wanted to move?
>it was time for an idea of your own
>you used psychology against him
>you weren't chasing anything
>in fact, quite the opposite 
>if you knew anything about him after the brief time together you knew his attention span 
>while he wasn't all that clingy, you hoped this was his Achilles heel
>so you sat your ass down next to a tree
>not 2 minutes had passed 
>he was back beside you, leaning over you
>very pouty 
>that's when you used a little slight of hand
>sure all it amounted to was saying "what's that over there" and pointing
>but your other hand clamped tight over his ankle
>so you won the chase in a second
>all without having to actually run
>so maybe he'd help you be a little more honest with yourself 
>didn't mean you weren't going to punish his ass
>he accepted the win
>you had a feeling the hard to get thing was an act
>while the whole situation would probably never become mundane to you, you were gradually accepting it
>Sonic was at least the most stable thing you'd gotten
>never try a hookup site for any of that shit
>it's how you end up with some 40 year old Teddy Roosevelt looking fucker greeting you at his door
>got out of there immediately 
>you still shuddered at that thought
>this guy here wasn't human
>but maybe you didn't need that
>you had pondered briefly more than once if this had made you some sort of beast fucker
>but you shooed the thought away 
>you might have gotten weird looks in public but he was sentient and talkative
>you were just at Captain Kirk level of xenophilia 
>he was just slightly more out there than a green woman
>plus he looked pretty
>so why shouldn't you?
>maybe see where this leads
>a little bit of living and learning
>you'd come around to him and maybe not putting a lockscreen on your phone was a good thing after all
>Sonic had no time to react when you pulled him into your lap
>your hand around his ankle moved up to squeezing his thick thigh 
>the runner thing did leave him looking very ideal below the waist
>he almost had some smarmy quip when you shoved two of your fingers into his mouth and he submitted instantly 
>feeling and seeing him suck your digits was getting you in the mood
>his own erection had been fighting the confines of his spats the entire time but now you could see the head poking up and out
>they'd gotten bunched up or he had moved them down
>hard to say with how quickly he could move
>it would be like him to show this off
>precum dribbled from the tip as he rolled his hips in your lap
>he straddled you like he belonged there
>maybe he did
>he was right about you batting for the other team
>it was just the whole talking woodland creature thing that had hung you up
>but those doubts weren't hanging around now
>you were just horny enough to made bad decisions now
>your hand fumbled with his spats, eventually settling on tearing them down
>you pulled your fingers back from his mouth and he opened his eyes slowly 
>after suckling on your digits he knew what was happening
>you reached around and gripped into him like a bowling bowl
>he rewarded you by arching his back, his cockhead leaking more pre onto you
>dominating him seemed to hush him up plenty
>your fingers slipped in and out without a rhythm, just haphazardly thrusting wet fingers into him
>you saw a drunken smile slowly grow on his face
>he was loving the attention and he knew this was only the start
>that eager triumphant look was the end of all your reservations 
>how one could look like they won when it meant getting a dick in the ass you couldn't figure
>manhandling him and pinning him to the grass made him squeal
>"oh you brute you~"
>he knew he'd won despite you winning the race
>you'd make the best of this situation 
>his grin melted when you started wildly thrusting your fingers into him
>what a fucking bottom
>all that bragging and attitude
>well you'd oblige, using your free hand to unzip your pants and pull them down
>the noise made his ears twitched and he looked down expectantly

>if he was going to fucking tease
>well
>you pulled your fingers out and used that hand to guide your dick
>if he was going to dress like a girl he was getting railed like one
>when you slid in you did so gently at first
>then he realized you were going easy
>he clicked his heels behind your back like a rider spurring a horse
>"I know you're tougher than that."
>well fine
>be that way
>you hilted in roughly and threw the word "buttslut" right back at him
>you grabbed him by the thin waist and shocked him by picking him up, your dick still buried in him
>"just want to make it clear I'm a buttslut and not a buttwhore"
>your thrust wiped away that smart ass attitude
>his hands went to grab a nearby tree as you sawed your cock in and out of the hedgehog boy
>he'd get what he wanted
>if he didn't want to sit down he wasn't going to sit down
>you were using him like a fleshlight as he he barely held onto a tree
>his own cock bouncing back and forth, the first of many loads splattering everywhere
>so he was a buttslut
>he'd just have to deal with it
>if he was going to be a tease well, you were into furries now
>the way he squeezed and thrust back into you made you thrust harder
>his body was so tight and hot, practically burning 
>you felt his body relax in your grip
>he completely submitted and enjoyed himself
>well he was definitely burning off energy today
>every time he climaxed he threatened to push you over the edge
>his outfit would probably be tatters but he was just wearing something girlier next time
>eventually his arms gave out and his shoulders were in the grass
>you just jackhammered down harder and harder
>you felt mischievous and pointed his cock right towards his face when your efforts got a 3rd load out of him
>goddamn this world might be an improvement
>Sonic's blue fur was covered in streaks of white
>his seed wasted across his own face
>you could swear he was getting off to the emasculation 
>getting punished for being so bratty
>he reached up and touched at your stomach
>a surprising amount of affection in such a small gesture
>your thrusts pushed him hard into the grass, each one having your full weight behind it
>another climax had his body shuddering and his hole grasping tighter on your manhood
>that was enough to make you finally cum deep inside him
>painting his insides instantly cleared your mind
>you had the strength to set him down and lay on top of him
>that lasted only a few seconds when you realized with how small he was by comparison to you
>so you flipped around
>the mess you planted in his stomach leaking out as he got his smirk back
>"so~"
>you were already dreading what ever he was going to say
>he gently poked your forehead and 
>"it's safe to say you think pink is my color, right?"
>welp might as well enjoy the ride
>you gripped his blue ass with both hands and got ready for another round
