Beautiful. The sight before you can only be described as beautiful. Breathtaking. Otherworldly. 

An arm moves over your shoulder, and you settle against Eleazar’s side. The magus’ bony snout presses to your temple as your arm wraps around his waist in return, and you look up to him as he gazes over the courtyard. His skeletal grin remains in place, as ever, but the shimmering lights in his eye-sockets flicker with so many mixed emotions. You stay silent, allowing Eleazar his moment; he’s home, after all. 

The moment is broken as a cadre of cloaked figures surround the two of you, seeming to step right out of the air. You press against Eleazar, looking around at what must be the magus’ brothers. Skulls of all shapes grin at you from every side, the horns crowning each magus’ head tinkling with hanging ornamentation, and eye-lights of every color in the aurora above flare and flicker as they look over both you and your magus. 

“Eleazar Draenendu.” One of the other magi steps forward, and at the sound of his voice Eleazar clutches you against him. The apparent leader of the pack meets Eleazar’s gaze for a long moment and then gives a formal bow; you notice that his horns look more like some kind of exotic headdress, draped in thin, fine cloth along with the jangling metal ornaments. “The Grand Magus has requested your presence. Come.” 

“…You are looking well, Baldwyn.” 

The magus, Baldwyn, rises up out of his bow as his own eyelights flare. You can feel the shift in the air as the other magi glance to one another; Eleazar’s body stiffens—tenses—as the hand on your shoulder crackles with faint magical energy. And then, once more, the moment is broken as Baldwyn’s eyelights flick away from your magus. “Come.”

You look from Eleazar to Baldwyn and back again, but still remain silent; you can ask what the hell that was about later. For now, the other magus steps back into the ring around you with his brothers, and the lights burning in their skulls flare bright while the world shifts and blinks out around you. The magical courtyard garden is replaced with a long, torchlit hall ending in a pair of open double-doors. You stumble against Eleazar once again, groaning as your head pounds, and your magus’ soothing hand strokes your back. “Steady, Anon.” His voice grounds you, and you give him a strained smile before you’re lead forward by the group of magi surrounding you into an even more massive room. 

 The cavernous space seems to be within the tower you saw in the courtyard, judging by the curve of the far wall; the monolithic spire must be even larger than you first thought. Pillars like the trunks of ancient trees, flanked by looming cloaked and skull-headed statues, rise into the shadows hiding the ceiling far above. Large stained glass windows in ever-shifting kaleidoscope patterns and colors line the wall across from the door, framing the gargantuan throne sitting on a raised platform surrounded by more magi. And there, sitting upon the throne, must be the Grand Magus.

The first thing you notice is that he’s large, very large; he’d probably stand head and shoulders above Eleazar if the two were standing toe-to-toe. His mane, long and flowing and groomed much like Eleazar’s—or perhaps it’s the other way around—extends in a thin line down what you can see of his chest and to the tip of his sinuous tail. His grinning skull is yellowed with age in a way the other magi’s aren’t. His horns are curved and long and polished with immaculate care, though strangely bare of the ornamentation the other magi have. He looks over the approaching group, the flames in his eye sockets flaring with power and shining in impossible colors, as they lead you and Eleazar to the foot of his throne. 

Baldwyn moves to stand at the throne’s right hand, and Eleazar tenses once more. “You stand now before Grand Magus Mordha, highest of all magi in Eyghlewhyn and keeper of the Source. Bow your heads before his might, and praise his-“ 

The Grand Magus lifts a hand to cut Baldwyn’s intoning voice off. “That will not be necessary.” Every magus in the hall goes dead silent as their leader stands, tall and proud before you. “Eleazar…” 

“M-Master Mordha…” Eleazar’s voice trembles, small and weak like a child’s. He grips your hand tight, and you give his fingers a reassuring squeeze in return. “Grand Magus Mordha, I have come to request an audience with you regarding matters both personal and involving the future of Eyghlewhyn. If it is not too much to ask, I beg to seek your counsel in private.” 

“Denied.” Baldwyn draws himself up. “You crawl back into our presence, tainting all of Eyghlewhyn with your disgrace, and have the gall to-” 

“Baldwyn Draenendu.” The Grand Magus’ words remain quiet, his deep voice rumbling low like distant thunder, but the other magus flinches and cuts himself off. When Mordha looks to Baldwyn, the smaller magus drops his gaze to floor. “I will handle this matter personally.” 

“Of course, Master Mordha. My apologies.” 

The Grand Magus turns back to you and Eleazar, and all thought of that little interruption is swept away as his eyelights fall upon you. His gaze is heavy, an almost physical pressure pushing down on you as it sweeps you up and down, and you find yourself feeling small—childish—under his stare. Fight-or-flight instincts freeze in indecision as you tremble before the Grand Magus of Eyghlewhyn. “And what of your companion?” 

Eleazar’s arm wraps around you, protective and supportive. With your magus standing beside you, you’re able to force yourself up to meet Mordha’s eyelights before having to look away again as the impossible colors flickering in his eye sockets make your head swim. Instead you look up to Eleazar, receiving a glance from the magus and a small nod. “My companion, Anon, will stay by my side throughout my time here.” 

It’s at that point that you feel the eyes of the other magi fall on you, and you realize that you hadn’t even been a blip on their radar until now. You were insignificant to them, just something that followed along in Eleazar’s wake. You draw yourself up, looking around to the other magi, and then give Grand Magus Mordha a nod; it’s still hard to meet the massive magus’ eyes, but you do your best anyway. You say that it’s an honor to be in his presence, and that you hope to learn of Eyghlewhyn from Eleazar much like he has learned of your world from you.

Your declaration is met with murmuring from the magi surrounding you, and you glance around to see them looking to you and then each other. Was that the right thing to say? Did you insult them in some way? For a long, anxious moment, the thought that you screwed things up before they even had a chance to really begin flitters through your mind. 

And then, you feel the pressure of Grand Magus Mordha’s gaze soften. He bows his head just a small fraction in a nod towards you. “It has been too long since we’ve had a human in our presence. You are welcome, Anon, and may you find enlightenment as you walk our halls and mingle with our brethren in comfort and security.” You glance to Eleazar, and your magus gives you another nod and a gentle smile. “For now, allow me to send you to the place where we will convene to discuss the matters you wish to raise. I have matters of my own to attend to, and shall be free to counsel with you momentarily.” 

Eleazar gives Mordha a low bow, and you quickly follow his example. “We are grateful for your graciousness, Grand Magus Mordha.” 

Again the massive magus nods, and then his eyelights flare. Again the world blinks out around you, and you stumble against Eleazar as you’re shunted off somewhere new. Again you feel the dull throb behind your eyes flare up, though not nearly as bad this time; maybe you’re finally getting used to being teleported here and there and everywhere. 

The room you’re in now is a lot smaller, and could reasonably be called cozy. A large hearth on one wall contains a roaring fire that warms the cold stone walls. Lush rugs cover the flagstone floor, and a table of dark, exotic wood sits in the center of the space. Wide windows overlook the courtyard garden from high up, and even offer a few peeks of the landscape beyond the surrounding walls and spires. The only truly ‘off’ thing you notice is the lack of a door; however, you suppose with their powers to teleport around, the magi don’t really have any need for doors.

Eleazar sighs, long and heavy, and collapses into a chair at the table. His shoulders, which had been tense ever since first seeing Baldwyn, finally relax as you move to rub over them through his coat. “That went well, all things considered. Though I suppose I should’ve expected the reception…” 

Yeah, you murmur in response. As you take a seat next to your magus, you bite your lip and try to organize your swirling thoughts. So much happened in such a short amount of time that you don’t even know where to start. Finally, you decide to ask about Baldwyn; the way he reacted to Eleazar, and the way that Eleazar reacted to him.

“Baldwyn…” your magus’ voice hardens as his eyes flare and his hands clench on the table. “One of my brothers, one of the few among the ranks of magi to share my surge-name. And the one whose hand held the knife that stabbed me in the back. I see that he has used my absence to take my position as the Grand Magus’ servant-apprentice for himself.” 

Surge-name? You hum in thought. The Grand Magus called him ‘Draenendu’, the same as Eleazar’s last name. You didn’t think the ‘brothers’ that the magus had told you about were his literal brothers.

Eleazar jumps at the chance to distract himself from his thoughts by offering an explanation. “When magi are born from the Source, it happens in surges. Groups of polyps rise from it together, and grow into, well…” He gestures to himself. “I suppose they are similar to what you would call a family; the polyps are raised and cared for together by the Grand Magus until their adolescence, when they take their places in the caste according to their magical potential.” 

And Baldwyn was jealous of Eleazar having more potential, and got together with their other ‘brothers’ to oust Eleazar from his position.

“That’s right.” Eleazar’s gaze drops to the tabletop, and his voice grows soft and wistful. “We were close, when we were younger. Perhaps that blinded me to the jealousy that festered within him…” 

You reach up to stroke between his horns, and his eyelights flicker out. You tell him not to blame himself; Baldwyn was completely responsible for his own actions. And now, Eleazar’s here to make sure that he can’t screw over any more of their brothers for his own gain.

“You are right.” His snout moves to press against the side of your face, and your hand moves down to rub across his broad back once more. “What occurred in the past has no bearing upon today’s matters.” You feel a surge of energy from his touch, and are suddenly sitting in your magus’ lap. You can’t stop your face from warming up at the feeling of the bulge beneath his loincloth pressing against your rump as his arms wrap you up in a tight embrace. “I am here, and you are here with me. Together, we shall entreat Master Mordha to hear us. And I can finally settle a matter that’s been on my mind since our first coupling…”

He keeps talking about this personal matter, but he still hasn’t come out and actually said what it is. 

His skeletal grin is wide and teasing as one of the lights in his eye sockets winks out for a moment. “As I have said, Master Anon, all in due time.”   

You stay like that for a long moment, head on Eleazar’s shoulder and your magus’ arms wrapped around you. You forget all about Aldrich and Baldwyn and Mordha and just enjoy the feeling of Eleazar’s body against yours, as you have over the week you’ve spent together; has it really only been a week? It feels like the two of you have been together for months or years. 

Of course, all things come to an end. With the sound of gusting wind, Grand Magus Mordha steps out of the air and into the room with you. He pauses, looking over the embrace you’re sharing with Eleazar, and you feel your cheeks heating up once more as you stumble out of your magus’ lap. Eleazar, meanwhile, stands gracefully to offer Mordha another low bow. “It has been much too long, Mas- Grand Magus Mordha.”

“It has indeed, Eleazar. Much too long.” Rather than a king welcoming a servant back into his presence, Mordha’s voice contains the warmth of a father greeting his prodigal son. He steps forward to pull Eleazar out of his bow, hands on the smaller magus’ shoulders as their eyes meet. “Do not bow to me, at least when we are alone. You’ve seen me in far too many compromising positions for that.” He laughs, but it falls flat and quickly dies out. “…I never thought I would see you again.” 

“I thought much the same.” Eleazar’s voice trembles again, and you can see a shudder run down his spine. Finally, he falls into an embrace with Mordha, clutching onto the larger magus; Mordha is indeed a giant among his race, the fact becoming much more obvious as he completely enfolds Eleazar in his arms. “I missed you.” 

“And I you, Eleazar.” Softly, tenderly, the Grand Magus begins to stroke between Eleazar’s horns. His long, nimble, clawed fingers seem to find every pleasurable spot upon the bony expanse that makes Eleazar melt with ease. The moaning of your magus makes you blush, and you can’t help but notice the way Mordha presses his lower body against Eleazar’s. ‘Really close’, indeed. Finally, you clear your throat to remind the two that you’re still present. 

“Mm. It is only through chance that I am here, Grand Magus. Chance, and the efforts of my dear companion Anon.” Eleazar looks to you with a warm, loving smile. He can see where you’re looking—Mordha’s hands on Eleazar’s back and the crown of his head, and the way their bodies press against each other—and finally pulls back from the Grand Magus. 

“Please, Eleazar, no titles.” Mordha looks to you as well, considering, before taking a step back from Eleazar himself. However, his hand remains on the smaller magus’ shoulder, rubbing slowly and with familiarity.  

Eleazar gulps. “Very well, Mordha.” You can tell that, if he were capable of it, the magus would be blushing.

You raise an eyebrow; so they’re on first name basis. Your own blush returns as you recall what Eleazar told you in the heat of your passionate lovemaking—exactly what he and his Master Mordha used to do with each other—and you clear your throat again. You stammer a little bit, but quickly say that you’ve been helping Eleazar with anything he’s needed. It was a pleasure to do so, especially after the way you found him. 

“I see. So this is your new master, Eleazar?” 

“Master, and more. Companion and lover and husband.” Eleazar takes you by the hand and brings you forward to proudly show you off to Mordha. Once again you feel the Grand Magus’ eyes upon you, but now that pressure is different; more like a warm embrace than a weight on your chest. “Anon purchased me out of slavery. He has been my guide throughout my time in his world, and I would not be here before you now without him.”

“Then I have you to thank for keeping Eleazar well.” The time you’ve spent with your magus makes it easy to see the shift in the Grand Magus’ expression; the softening of his own skeletal grin, and the gratitude in the nod he gives you. Then he gestures for the two of you two take your seats once more while pulling out a chair for himself. “Please, tell me everything of your experience, Eleazar. Hold nothing back.”

And Eleazar doesn’t. It all comes pouring out, everything that had happened since he left Eyghlewhyn in disgrace; everything that had happened to him in the weeks he spent Mellygch’s clutches. He removes his coat, allowing Mordha to trace over the scars crisscrossing his back, and the Grand Magus scowls at the sight. 

“Baldwyn had assured me t’would be no different than the treatment servants receive in Eyghlewhyn.” Again, the Grand Magus’ words rumble like distant thunder. “…I see now that he was gravely mistaken.” Or lying, you don’t say. Eleazar stiffens and groans as Mordha’s fingertips move up to the nape of his neck, and the larger magus quickly jerks his hand away. “Does the branding hurt, Eleazar?”

Wait, branding?

Eleazar looks over his shoulder to Mordha, and something passes between them in a moment. “’Tis no matter.” Your magus is quick to throw his coat back on, sit beside you, and quickly wave away the awkward air that’s gathered by resuming his tale. What had happened at the auction, and how you had brought him home to live with you. What had occurred between you over the weekend, and the week afterward. You flush and stammer when he gets to the part about your first time together, trying to shush him. He can’t just go blurting out your sex life like that!

“And why not, Anon? I am proud to be your lover.” Eleazar strokes your arm. “I am proud to show off the marking you have left upon me. Proud to have your scent upon me, plain for anyone to sense. This is no different.” 

What does he mean by ‘marking’ and ‘your scent’?

You hear a deep rumbling from Mordha. A laugh. “You forget, Eleazar, that humans’ senses are not as keen as those from this side. He would not know that you’ve been walking around with his marking upon you all this time.” 

With a groan, you bury your face in your hands. So every Other you’ve come across has known that you and Eleazar are banging. That explains some of the looks you’ve gotten. 

Eleazar sighs as he wraps an arm around your shoulders. “Peace, Anon. I should apologize. When I was his apprentice, I felt comfortable sharing everything with Grand Magus Mordha. It is something that all magi feel for him, but with my position as his apprentice…” Again, that flick of his eyelights and shift in his skeletal grin; he’d be blushing too, if he could. “And you know how close he and I once were. What ‘positions’ I took as his apprentice…” 

You clear your throat. Yeah, you reply. 

Mordha looks between the two of you, his skeletal grin wide and gentle and paternal. “Peace, human. You can be assured of my confidence in all matters, as all who come to me are.” That shift crosses the larger magus’ face as well, and you stare at the Grand Magus in disbelief. Does he mean what you think he means? One of his impossibly-colored eyelights winks out for a moment. “I am interested to hear all about the time you have spent with Eleazar, Anon. I wish to know that he has been kept happy in your bed while he has been absent from mine.” 

“Mordha…” Eleazar is staring too, and a glance at his crotch reveals the boner poking up from under his loincloth. Not that you can blame your magus, since your own erection is throbbing insistently in your pants. But he looks to you, eyelights questioning as he takes your hand; uncertain. You consider for a long moment, biting your lip, and then decide ‘fuck it’. With a blush burning on your own face, you offer Mordha a smile and say that you’d be okay with filling him in, once your business is concluded. After a moment of hesitation, you then say that maybe you and Eleazar can give Mordha a few demonstrations. 

Whatever you thought would happen after flirting with the Grand Magus of Eyghlewhyn, you don’t expect what happens next. Mordha stand from his chair and shrugs his voluminous robes off, allowing them to fall to the floor and disappear. The larger magus is completely nude underneath, and just as shameless as Eleazar about showing it off. He nods in encouragement as your eyes rake over his chest—indeed, the line down his belly to the lips of his slit is groomed in a thin line just like Eleazar’s—down to the massive balls hanging between his thighs. “I should like that very much.” 

“In that case…” Eleazar stands as well, ogling Mordha with open longing and desire. “We can discuss the personal matter I mentioned earlier as we lay with each other, if you would like to take this to your chambers.” You look up to your magus, watching as he shrugs out of his coat as well. Reaches down to unwind his loincloth. Strips down until he’s completely nude and bare, just like the Grand Magus. 

“And that is?” Mordha’s eyes are locked firmly on Eleazar’s crotch, and his sinuous tongue flicks out from his parted jaws. 

Eleazar meets your gaze. Smiles, and gently pulls you to your feet. Wraps an arm around you, and holds you close against his side. “I wish to finally consummate my marriage with my dear Master Anon. And I wish you to be present, Mordha. I wish you to provide both your blessing, and the means to bind my husband and me together.”
