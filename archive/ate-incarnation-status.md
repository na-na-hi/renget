>God Rank: C
>Synchronization Rate: 100%
>Level: 6
>Influence: 942/3200
>Divinity: 275/275
>Directive: By Their Own Hand
You gain Influence whenever a person touched by your influence meets disaster as a result of their own folly. Additionally, you gain influence for each bystander harmed in the process. Once you meet a certain influence threshold, you may either increase your level or the level of one of your authorities. However, the levels of your authorities may not exceed your level. Additionally, new authorities may be unlocked at higher levels

>Secondary Directive: Rebuke Against Heaven
Gain significantly more influence by laying low divinities and their followers

>Trait: Olympian Exile:
Your influence can touch anyone, mortal and god alike. However, you will be recognized and seen as a threat by any incarnation of an <Olympian>

>Trait: Sweet Venom:
All of your authorities are more effective against individuals who either like you or are under the impression that you are a person that they hold affection for, proportional to the feelings they hold.

>Pantheon: Spawn of Discord
Assemble your pantheon to gain a bonus to the effective level of all authorities, as well as a bonus authority that is only available upon full pantheon assembly

##Authorities (13/15):

>Divine Folly (EX):
You may copy one Authority from any incarnation that falls victim to your directive. The authority you copy is random, and you may do so only once per incarnation, and all authorities are copied at level one

>A Thousand Faces, a Thousand Voices (4):
You can temporarily alter your physical appearance and voice as you please, provided you maintain a human shape. Additionally, your words can be understood by anyone, regardless of language. It is possible for you to replicate specific individuals, although you still need to roll to maintain the disguise unless you know the person (or at least their appearance and mannerisms) reasonably well. (20 divinity/level per hour).

It is possible to add non-human features to your disguises so long as they don't deviate considerably beyond the human form, such as horns, impossible eye or skin colors, or pointed ears. It remains impossible to use this skill to augment your physical capabilities.

When imitating a specific person, their mannerisms, accent, habits, and language of origin become natural to you.

>Whisper of Temptation (5):
While in effect, individuals sustain permanent losses to their capacity for delayed gratification and impulse control, becoming more severe the longer they hear your voice. Recordings are sufficient for this effect. It is possible to lower the inhibitions of specific impulses. However, the more specific your restrictions, the longer it takes for your authority to take hold, and the more likely it is for your <Whispers> to not have any effect at all. (25 divinity/level per hour).

It is possible to implant not only specific desires, but specific directives through your voice. However, as before, the more specific the command and the less in line with the desires of the target, the more exposure is necessary to bring about the desired effect

You are capable of using your <Whisper of Temptation> to illicit not only desires, but beliefs which the target desires to be true: (for example, you can convince a person that they are beautiful). This process takes much longer than any other use of this authority 

It is also possible to produce a much more immediate effect with this authority by having the intended outcome align with the words you say. 

>Touch of Madness (5):
You may target one individual by making physical contact with them, causing them to temporarily lose all restraint, engaging in indiscriminate violence, extreme indulgence in sex, food, or substances, or even suicide. You may choose what vice they succumb to provided that those impulses existed in at least some capacity within the target. However, these impulses can be resisted with enough willpower, depending on the authority's level. It is possible to project the effects outward beyond your hand, expending one additional point to increase the radius by a number of inches equivalent to the skill's level. You may expend as many points per usage as you would like, however, only one desire can be stoked per target. (5 divinity per use)

It is possible to make considerable alterations to the target's sense of reality. For example, as long as the approximate size, rigidity, and shape of an object is maintained, the affected individual could perceive the object as anything. The target's brain will automatically fill in the information to meet the <Concept> the user choses when the illusions are cast. However, the more outlandish or complex the concept, the more likely the target is to realize they are in an illusion. Once the target realizes that they are under the effects of an illusion, the effects of the authority will immediately end.

>Regeneration (4):
You may expend divinity to recover from any injury or from supernatural physical conditions such as <Rot> or <Petrification>. The amount of divinity necessary to heal an injury depends on its nature and severity. It is possible for this skill to recover injuries to the brain, such as a concussion, automatically, but it is possible to die from other causes while this process occurs.

>Titanic Strength (3): 
You may infuse your body with divinity, strengthening the power and durability of your muscles. Overuse may cause damage to connective or skeletal tissue. Max Usage: 10 divinity per minute. It is possible to activate this skill on reflex.

>To Mortals, A Scourge (3): 
You may expend divinity to gain a resistance to attacks from mortals or from non-divine natural phenomena. Additionally, you are able to survive any single attack from a mortal while this skill is active, regardless of the power and scope. This includes explosives. However, resisting more damage than would normally be possible will reduce your divinity to zero. (10 divinity per hour)

>Bane of Calydon (3):
Consumes divinity to temporarily transform you into the <Calydonian Boar>. While the skill is in use, you will have access to every natural authority of the <Calydonian Boar>, but you will be unable to use any of your other authorities while <Bane of Calydon> is active. Additionally, it is possible to utilize the authorities of Divine Relics while transformed.

>Assess Hamartia (2):
You are able to identify the trait, desire, or flaw of an individual that is most likely to result in their ruin. Additionally, a target of <Assess Hamartia> gains penalties to resisting psychological effects targeting their Hamartia

>Omen (2): 
Gives you a premonition whenever you are at risk of immediate death or severe bodily harm. Also indicates the general direction of the danger. Consumes divinity whenever it activates

>Preservation Instinct (3): 
You will automatically dodge out of the way of attacks directed at you, even if you had no way of knowing that they were coming. Consumes divinity upon activating proportional to both how dramatic or complex the dodging maneuver and how difficult the attack would be to see coming. It is possible to perform movements using this authority that would not be otherwise possible, however doing so will put proportionate strain on your body.

>Supernatural Speed (3):
You can infuse divinity into your body, causing you to move faster. This does not slow down your perception of time, but does heighten your reflexes and instincts. Using the skill for prolonged periods of high capacity can lead to muscle soreness. Max Usage: 10 divinity per minute. It is possible to activate this skill on reflex.

>Guerilla Tactics (1):
Hides the presence of yourself and designated allies. Consumes influence proportional to the number of targets. Can fail against higher level authorities. Does not negate the effects of items.
