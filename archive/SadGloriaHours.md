#You've Had Your Fun

The curly haired girl was practically skipping down the hall as her last class ended, not a care on the world as she moved along. She had recovered recently from her little... Breakup with Matthew. Though she probably deserved that for what she had done, though it didn't hurt any less. It wasn't like she was pining for anyone...well...almost anyone. 

She was stock still when he passed by, hair pushed back as usual while he walked some some other boys and his cousin from the Slytherin house. He turned his head and they matched eyes for what seemed like only a moment and he made a bit of a face before his attention was snagged by Artie and they were gone just as quickly as they had come. Gloria smiled a little and decided to take a detour to the bathroom before heading back to her common room for a snack. 

The bathroom she had gone into was one of the one closer to the main hall so there were girls of all houses in there, most of them looking in mirrors above the circular set of sinks and the fountain that held them together. She smiled pleasantly, going to to her business but....there was something tingling in the back of her neck. Some sort of looming....unsettling feeling. She ignored it and finished up in the stall, not noticing how quiet it got. 


She came out and before she could say much she was shoved back into the Stall, a few Slytherin girls and a Gryffindor at the center, she was forced to sit, her eyes wide as she went to ready her wand. 

Petrificus!

She was stuck there, looking at all the scowling faces, some were smug and the others...

”You think you're so cute, gallivanting all around with your short skirts and such, huh?” one of the girls snapped, Glory was wide eyed, unable to speak for herself because of the spell. She had no idea what was going on but she didn't like it. 

”Floozy!”

”Whore!”

”Slut!”

The insults flew at her in such a rapid state she could barely keep up until the hand of one of the girls silenced all the others, it was the Gryffindor, which had settled her heart a little. They were always about doing the right thing, she would get her out of her. 

The girl waved her wand and Gloria felt the spell release and she sighed, going to stand up. “Th-Thank you I—”

”I heard what you did. To Hannah? I also saw you sniffing up the Slytherin common rooms looking for Artorias Black!” She said, Gloria looking even more perplexed now. Where was all of this coming from, why was this happening?

”Trying to snag a boyfriend when you've been on your knees so much people don't even know how tall you are! Stay away from them, a slut like you doesn't deserve to be in any relationship.” She said, that statement bit into her, her face frozen into this pained stare.  She opened her mouth a little, trying to speak. 

”I...I don't...”

”Aw, you really think Artorias Black, nephew to the Headmaster, pureblood wizard was going to lower his standards for some back alley trollop who won a game of Quidditch because she's great at catching balls!” The girls started to filter out, one of them staying behind as Gloria just stood in the bathroom. 

”They talk about you all the time you know, you never wondered why the boys never talked to you and only asked you to suck them off? By Merlin, you're so stupid.” She said, laughing a little before leaving. 

Gloria finally could breath, though she wasn't sure what she should be breathing for. Had....Had it always been this way? She thought she was making friends, she was having fun! Why....

She went to sit next to the stall on the floor, curling up and hugging her knees, resting her head against them for a while as she felt sobs starting to build in her chest and up her throat. Though she heard the door open and she expected another girl but it wasn't....

It was a boy, a few of them in fact. She looked up, watery eyes wide as she went to stand.

”Yo, they weren't joking, she is here waiting!”

”Hey, Gloria, can I be first?”

”No way, I'll be first...move..”

Her body was hit with shock, the girls, they had sent them here. She started to try to push past them. “I...Not right now...There's something I have to—gah!!” 

Someone had tripped her before she made it to the door which shut and locked itself via a spell, she tried to get up but one of the more devious and mean Slytherin boys was standing before her, hands already starting to undo his trousers. 

”Oh come now, You've had your fun...now you have to take responsibility. You're the one who started all this.” Gloria gasped, looking up with a pained, fearful look in her eyes, a circle starting to form around her as the others were preparing themselves, the witch swallowed hard, choking back whatever tears that were threatening to fall down her face as she settled herself on her knees. 

She could hear her father's voice in her own ears as she reached out to grab the first cock before her.
