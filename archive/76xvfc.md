##Disciples
>Yashsa
"I was accosted on the road again today by a foul-mouthed man. I explained to him that I had already given away all but the clothes on my back the previous day, but he wouldn't listen. It seemed that he would force my hand when, all of a sudden, he was on the ground and motionless. Then, a masked stranger approached to check if I had been harmed before his intervention. My sword hungered after being denied, and I think he may have known. We only exchanged a few words before I thought it best to depart, but I could tell he was experienced."

>Ming Ming
"A more pleasant encounter today. A young merchant girl spent some time showing me her wares. I found myself agreeing to purchase a dozen talismans but had to inform her of my lack of coin when I reached for my purse. She shooed me away after the revelation."

>Zheng Hao
"Even I am aware of the Seven Clouds Medicine School and its fall. It is regrettable, but when I think of such things, it makes me wonder what may have happened were I dealt a kinder role. Would I be allowed to live peaceably had I no talent for bringing death, or would I simply become a victim? Surely what students survive wish they had such a gift."

>Nobu
"While passing through a village, I heard talk of an outlander with an affinity for fire lances. There is no wrong way to kill, but I would like to think my sword offers a kinder death than being blown to bits."

>Yexin
"I shared a meal with someone today. How long has it been since I last had the honor? We crossed paths as I hunted a boar, and she helped me butcher it in exchange for some of the meat. She didn't seem to mind my limited cooking abilities. In fact, she seemed quite happy to eat it raw. She proved more than willing to tell me of her time in the Wilds, so I saw fit to share a little of my own past. My old master would have used her to make a weapon out of spite for how she spoke of the Sect."

>Lord Charles Maynard

>Heng Zhiqiang
"They say there is a man who appears before you and twists your fate. Always for the worse, yet with the promise of power. I've already known my share of cruel masters, but I wonder how my fate would have been shaped should a different one have found me. If possible, I would like to observe one of his supposed students and know what it means to reject fate."

##Elders
>The Boneless Old Man
"A withered man tended to my lingering wear and offered me tea. He didn't even question me on how I'd grown so beaten. A bit too for his own good, but he seemed capable enough. We did chat for a while, but I never caught his name. All I recall is that he had a habit of making puns. My blade found it somewhat grating, but I think I may have let a smile slip.

>Dong Do
"The things those who walk the path of the immortal leave behind are as great as they are varied. I have heard of fish that others would cross mountains to listen to him give lectures. I think I will join them to hear what he would say of my nature. What needs has the world for a killer among so many others?"

>Xiu Yi
"I have heard of a flame that burned the hand that fed it, forsaking her clansmen for a taste of freedom. She now journies unrestrained with only her dao to keep her company. I can be sure of nothing, yet both my blade and I feel strongly that we must meet her. It will be a moment of love and joy that I can scarcely recall having felt or of disappointment that gives way to enmity. And should fate look poorly upon me, to die at the hands of someone similar would not be regrettable."

>Guan Chāo
"Their bodies seemed to decay before my eyes, yet they attacked without concern for the death that clung to their souls. Slaying them seemed a mercy. I have seen my share of suffering and know when such wickedness is the doing of cultivators. I can only wonder why. The flesh of bandits is of too low quality to be used as materials, but the source of their infliction might serve as a quality weapon. My master might then be pleased enough that he would not have me harassed. Or at least it might be sold for comfortable lodging."

>Gyldenwulf
"A golden-haired outlander and his she-wolf have stirred up trouble for a number of sects. Perhaps a pet of my own would make my fate more bearable, but I fear that I have mastered caring for myself. How might I care for a creature of a weaker constitution, then? Maybe this outlander would impart some wisdom on me."

"It seems that this outlander visited other lands before finding himself in my own. I've had little opportunity to experience the loss that has driven Leanne to pursue him, but I will lend my blade to calm her heart. I wonder, will some child come to me one day and tell me of the pain I have inflicted upon them?"

>Huang Yu

>Shu Luxing
"A strange girl spoke to me. Her head was filled with fantastic stories, but the way in which she related them to me was unfitting. I felt no ill intent, but there are ways to hide such things. I suspected he was an assassin hoping to use a weaker form to make me lower my guard, so I put on the appearance of being at ease and prepared to retaliate should she strike. Yet, she never did. Still, I let it be known that I had no desire for companionship to avoid the risk."

>Moriko Nana

>Morgain Blackheart
"Some festival seemed to be transpiring when I came into town. I had little interest in the choice of games, but I thought I might watch the show while enjoying some sweets. The crowd's eyes swelled with desire for an artifact that might give them power such as the king in the story. It struck me that I might give my sword to another, and let them bear its curse. Perhaps it would simply choose them over me."

>Mei Lan
"Who would yearn for the whip? The concept is entirely strange to me, yet one of the Immortal Empires dotting the land dedicated its resources to training such people in the ways of servitude. I suppose some were simply born to serve just as I was born to kill."

>Wen Lifen
"I cannot say that I share my master's strictness, for he spoke on end of his contempt for those like the Wen. Still, I was taught a weapon's true purpose and have some distaste for the showiness that some cultivators are fond of. To see this woman use her blade as a means of entertainment... I do not know how I should feel. I find her nature somewhat enviable, yet I feel as if I've been made a fool of. I know that I would not be troubled if I drew my sword against her."

>Lei Daiyu
"I stood a distance away while listening to her play for a crowd. My blood seemed to boil as my sword cried to be set free, yet I found a peace unknown to me settling in. I fled before anything more serious could transpire when I thought she might have noticed my discomfort. It's a harsh thing to be confronted with the truth, to know my soul has been dyed in blood. Perhaps it might be purified, but I have no confidence that it would persist in this realm."

>Leanne Pierpont
"Her presence is no replacement for the one I seek. Yet, I find myself moved to aid in her quest for vengeance. The way I found her she did not seem ready to take on such a bloody mission. She may be a warrior, but she is no killer. The sense of valor and honor I was touched by has little place in battle,  where savage and cowardly efficiency is what determines your survival . Still, she showed no care for my own wrongdoings when she requested I join her. Perhaps it was simple ignorance, but I would like to spare her the pain of learning to kill."

>Zhihao Cheng
"It must seem strange, my relationship with the law being what it is, but I would like to meet this man and be judged. I know it's foolish, but who else might show sympathy to a devil? Perhaps he is in need of an executioner."
