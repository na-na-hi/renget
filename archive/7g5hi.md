#Naruto Second Reboot

>Scenario: MP starts at the equivalent of episode 1 of Naruto, but none of the original characters exist. Anons are free to create their own historic clans.
>Rules:
>No Z rank
>No world-altering drawbacks
>Kekkai Genkai Perks give you 10 points towards a KG instead of giving it to you for free/upgrading it for free
>Ignore the mandatory drawback requirements listed on some Perks (Enhanced Bodyfags better watch their backs)
>You must throw tomatoes at soulless powergaming builds
