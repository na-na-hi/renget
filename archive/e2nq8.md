## DREKUS INC.

>INT. KYOTO SEWER
*A dimly lit sewer with bits of sunlight going through cracks. DREKUS, a burly and tall mutant who resembles a blue-skinned devil, stands amidst piles of corpses and surgical tools. He grunts and snarls, clearly agitated. He is wearing a tattered labcoat and had just finished pulling a gold tooth out of a skull. Suddenly, a loud banging noise is heard from outside the sewer, followed by the sound of a car engine.*

**DREKUS (angered)**
What is this noise?! Drekus wants peace!

*The manhole above DREKUS is pulled open, and MR. OOMORI, a middle-aged man in a suit with dark graying hair, climbed down into DREKUS' sewer. He looks somewhat out of place in this grimy setting.*

**MR. OOMORI (cheerfully)**
Good morning, Drekus! I'm Mr. Oomori, the new regional manager of LC Corp. You're the mutant that's been scaring away all our construction workers, correct? I've come to offer you a job!

**DREKUS (confused)**
Job? What job?

**MR. OOMORI  (enthusiastically)**
Why, a corporate position, of course! LC Corp is expanding its horizons, and we're looking for individuals with unique talents. Your strength, resourcefulness, and...uh...surgical skills are just what we need!

*Drekus scratches his head, trying to make sense of Mr. Oomori's words. Something about the man has kept Drekus from attacking him outright.*

**DREKUS (grumbles)**
Drekus not understand "corporate position" or "LC Corp." But Drekus like idea of more money for better tools.

**MR. OOMORI (smiling)**
Great! You'll be our "Director of Urban Adaptation and Mutant Communications." Your mission is to bring your brand of urban mutant style to the modern world. We want to tap into your raw energy and creative problem-solving skills.

**DREKUS (grinning)**
Drekus tackle corporate life? He can do this, but Drekus cannot work Fridays, that is time when he stalks little students in hero school from shadow.

*Mr. Oomori claps his hands in excitement.*

**MR. OOMORI**
Fantastic! I knew you'd be up for the task. Welcome aboard, Drekus! Just sign right here!

*Drekus signs a document and they shake hands, Drekus's grip nearly crushing Mr. Oomori's hand.*

>INT. LC CORP OFFICE  - ONE WEEK LATER

*Drekus, now dressed in a ripped ill-fitting suit with his muscles bulging through the fabric, strides confidently through the sleek, modern office. His entrance causes heads to turn and whispers to ripple through the employees.*

**EMPLOYEE #1 (whispering)**
Is that the mutant they hired?

**EMPLOYEE #2 (whispering)**
Yeah, rumor has it he brought in and fought an undead bear on his first day!

**EMPLOYEE #3 (whispering)**
He'll last a month here tops. Just look at what he's wearing. Gross.

**DREKUS (muttering to himself as he enters elevator)**
Drekus hates gossips. He conquer job then all will fear Drekus.

*As he passes by various cubicles, employees stare in disbelief at the angry mutant in their midst.*

>INT. MR. OOMORI 'S OFFICE - ONE WEEK LATER

*Drekus barges into Mr. Oomori's office, knocking over a stack of papers in the process.*

**DREKUS (excitedly)**
Drekus ready for new challenge! What he do now?

**MR. OOMORI (amused)**
Ah, Drekus, I'm glad you're here. Due to your extraordinary enthusiasm and managerial skills, I'm promoting you to Senior Director!

*Drekus' eyes widen in surprise.*

**DREKUS**
Drekus... Senior Director? Drekus will have corner office?

**MR. OOMORI (nodding)**
Absolutely! Your unconventional methods have already made an impact. We believe in your people skills and out-of-the-box thinking! I just have a few documents I need you to sign.

>INT. LC CORP OFFICE - ONE MONTH LATER

*Drekus, now sporting a custom-tailored suit that struggles to contain his muscular frame, strides confidently through the bustling office. He has adapted remarkably well to the corporate world, though his occasional outbursts and foreign speaking pattern still make him stand out.*

**EMPLOYEE #1 (whispering)**
Can you believe it? Drekus just single-handedly fixed the company-wide stock crash!

**EMPLOYEE #2 (whispering)**
I heard he negotiated a deal with a rival company by doing heart replacement surgery on their CEO! No one knows where he got the heart.

**EMPLOYEE #3 (whispering)**
There's a rumor that he headhunted several executives and brought them in bound and naked.

*Drekus approaches a glass-walled conference room where a group of executives eagerly awaits him. He pushes the door open without hesitation, surprising the high-ranking officials.*

**EXECUTIVE (stammering)**
Ah, Drekus! We've been waiting for you. We have an important merger negotiation today, and we need your...unique approach.

*Drekus takes a seat at the head of the table, surrounded by astounded executives. The opposing company's representatives, wearing expensive suits, eye him skeptically.*

**DREKUS (pointing)**
You... give more food!

**EXECUTIVE (confused)**
More food? That's not really...

**DREKUS (interrupting)**
More food! Make feast strong! Bring vodka! 

*The executives exchange glances but decide to go along with Drekus' unconventional request. They order an extravagant lunch spread with many bottles of alcohol. Drekus demanded that they all partake, none dared to challenge the angry mutant.*

*As everyone enjoys the delicious meal and drinks, the atmosphere gradually shifts from tension to drunken camaraderie. Laughter fills the room, and the executives loosen up, their barriers crumbling under Drekus' unorthodox charm.*

>INT. MR. OOMORI'S OFFICE

*Drekus enters Mr. Oomori's office, beaming with satisfaction. The walls are adorned with certificates and awards, marking Drekus' rapid rise within the company.*

**DREKUS (excitedly)**
Drekus make peace! Food has crushed fears and doubts of merger!

**MR. OOMORI (grinning)**
Ah, just the man I wanted to see. I just got off the phone with the Board and your exceptional skills in conflict resolution have earned you a promotion to Vice President!

*Drekus' eyes widen, he grinned excitedly. *

**DREKUS**
Drekus... Vice President? Drekus can afford upgrade to bigger sewer?

**MR. OOMORI (nodding)**
Absolutely! Your leadership  have brought unprecedented success to LC Corp. You're revolutionizing how we approach challenges. You've even automated our factory lines, with those.. what do you call them?

**DREKUS**
Animated corpses brought back to life with quirk. Very old ones. Noone will miss. Drekus fire useless puny employees. Corpses work for free, make factories better!

*Drekus thumps his chest proudly, determination in his eyes.*

**MR. OOMORI**
Indeed, Drekus. Keep pushing boundaries, and who knows? Maybe one day, you'll be running this whole corporation. 

*Drekus leaves the office, brimming with newfound ambition. Drekus is now a force to be reckoned with in the corporate world. He stands on the steps of the LC Corp building. He looks up at the towering structure, seeing a future where his power could shape the world.*

**DREKUS (determined)**
Drekus conquer all! All shall bow down to Drekus!

*With a resounding primal roar that turns heads on the busy street, Drekus marches forward, ready to conquer and reach the top.*

>EXT. LC CORP BUILDING - TWO MONTHS LATER

*The LC Corp building stands as a beacon of modernity and success, with a massive banner displaying Drekus' face and the words "Drekus: From Sewers to CEO!" A bustling crowd of employees and media gathers outside the building, awaiting a special announcement.*

*DREKUS, now donning a custom-made suit that fits him perfectly, walks out of the building with MR. OOMORI by his side. The sewermutant-turned-executive carries an air of confidence, his brutish strength refined into a powerful presence.*

**REPORTER (eagerly)**
Drekus, what can you tell us about your meteoric rise to the top of LC Corp?

**DREKUS (smiling)**
Drekus wins through power! No executive can surpass his strength! With support of Mr. Oomori and LC Corp team Drekus achieve record profit for stocking holders!

**MR. OOMORI (proudly)**
Drekus' exceptional leadership, innovative thinking, and ability to inspire have transformed our company. He embodies the true spirit of LC Corp's motto: "Unleash Your Inner Strength!"

*The crowd clapped loudly, captivated by Drekus's energy and Mr.Oomori's quirk. They both raise their arms, and the crowd cheer with excitement.*

>INT. LC CORP OFFICE - ONE WEEK LATER

*The atmosphere in the LC Corp office has drastically changed. All the lights are flickering due to unpaid energy bills. Tension hangs in the air as employees whisper amongst themselves. Drekus, no longer in his tailored suit, stands near his desk, looking bewildered. The company stock has been plummeting and accusations of corporate embezzlement and corruption were popping up in the media. Loud sirens can be heard outside, as police vehicles are surrounding the building. Mr. Oomori, wearing a deceitful smile, approaches him.*

**DREKUS (confused)**
Mr. Oomori, what is happening? Why are police here?

**MR. OOMORI (feigning concern)**
Drekus, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. It appears that some fraudulent activities have been taking place within LC Corp, and unfortunately, the evidence seems to implicate you. You see all the orders for our new acquisition have your signature in it.

*Drekus's eyes widen in disbelief and anger.*

**DREKUS**
Fraud? Drekus not do fraud! Drekus worked hard, trusted you!

**MR. OOMORI (slyly)**
Oh, Drekus, you've been such a useful pawn. Signing those documents without understanding their true contents, taking the fall for my schemes.

*Drekus's fury intensifies, his mutant instincts awakening as his quirk activates. He starts cycling through his mutations. Steel feathers grew from his body, spider venom drips from his teeth, his eyes glows red and mists with propane.*

**DREKUS (roaring)**
You trick Drekus? 

**MR. OOMORI (whispering)**
Yes, Drekus. You were a perfect disguise, a distraction from my own misdeeds. But things are getting a bit droll now, and it's time to clean up loose ends.

**Drekus' glared at him and roared loudly.**

*Just as Drekus is about to charge, the police approach followed by three pro heroes, ready to arrest him. They grab his arms and try to drag him away, but he stands his ground, his mutant strength surging.* 

**SLIPSTREAM (professional tone)**
Come along with us. Don't start any trouble now.  

*Slipstream uses his quirk to control the friction of the floor under Drekus causing him to slide back as they drag him.*

**DREKUS (growling)**
Drekus not bad guy here. He is! Take Mr. Oomori!

**SLIPSTREAM (chuckling)**
That's a good one. Why would we do that? Mr. Oomori is a pillar of our community.  You're the one with a background as a villain.

*Drekus starts thrashing around throwing off two of the heroes. He hears gasps outside his office, he sees scared expressions from all the employees he knows. He did not want to destroy the building. He did not want to hurt Fujita who is one year from retirement, and Takanashi who just bought a house with a baby on the way. He sighs and let himself get taken away.*

**SLIPSTREAM (chuckling)**
Yeah, you better settle down. Nothing you do will let you "slip" away.  

*Slipstream winks at a camera crew that's come out of the hallway. Drekus growls and turns his attention to Mr. Oomari.*

**DREKUS (angry)**
Drekus not go down without fight.. Drekus will come for you! He will get revenge!

*Mr. Oomari watches Drekus being forcibly taken away, a mix of satisfaction and amusement in his eyes. He pours himself a glass of sparkling blue wine.*

**MR. OOMORI (whispering to himself)**
It was all worth it. Now, LC Corp is mine.

*As Drekus disappears down the hallway, his eyes burning with vengeance, the employees of LC Corp look on in shock. Mr.Oomori, AKA Charlatan sips his glass of wine.*
