The usual six were gathered in the clubroom.
 
F: They said they're recruiting volunteers to help with the rebuilding...
 
T: But they haven't contacted us yet. I'm bored enough to start doing magic tricks.
 
Y: Waah! Doves just flew out of Tougou-san's uniform!
 
S: There's probably so much to do they're having trouble figuring out where to start.
 
K: I'm going to run out of dried sardines to munch on at this rate. President, what are we going to do?
 
F: Hmm, let's see...
 
F: Wait, Itsuki's the president now!
 
K: I was asking her all along.
 
I: M-Maybe we should just wait here? They can contact us suddenly, and even if they don't, we do a lot of work every day already.
 
K: Resting time should be spent resting. That doesn't sound too bad.
 
Y: Itsuki-chan, be more confident in yourself.
 
K: That's right. If you say something weird I'll be sure to let you know.
 
I: Even if you say that...
 
T: Itsuki-chan can be pretty sharp-tongued sometimes. She might not be very confident right now, but give her another year...
 
T: Itsuki-chan, I've finished the task I was given.
 
I: But you still have three more, don't you?
 
I: Finishing one task should go without saying. Don't waste my time, report back only after you finish all three of them.
 
T: I-I'm sorry, Itsuki-chan.
 
I: Looks like you've grown dull, Tougou-senpai.
 
T: Itsuki-chan, that kind of attitude is a little...
 
I: Silence. All of my actions are correct.
 
T: ...Like that.
 
I: I'm not going to start acting like an exploitative boss from the old era...
 
F: Yeah, Tougou, turn down that imagination.
 
T: No matter how hard I try, my metaphors are never received well...
 
S: Wasshi, you went ahead and uploaded a novel online last year, didn't you?
 
T: Ugh! W-Why do you know about that?
 
S: I happened to come across it, and after reading it I realised, "Yeah, Wasshi wrote this".
 
F: Huh? Tougou, you wrote a novel? What genre?
 
T: Pure national defense.
 
F: Since when was that a genre...
 
T: It's one I'm advocating for.
 
Y: I want to read it, I want to read it!
 
T: I'm sorry, but it's too embarrassing. When I uploaded it, I got flooded with criticism.
 
T: There was one person who gave it five stars, though.
 
T: ...Wait. Sonocchi, you were that person, weren't you?
 
S: I wonder, ehehe...
 
T: To think the only good rating was from someone I know... I guess writing literature just isn't my thing.
 
S: Or maybe you are? You got a lot of really detailed reviews, just like last time, right?
 
T: But they were all negative.
 
S: But you still got their opinions. That means you have the power to move people!
 
S: Not being able to convey anything is what's truly painful.
 
S: And by the way, the people who reviewed your work last time reviewed your new one too.
 
T: Huh? You read the things I wrote back then too?
 
S: Yeah, I found them later. Anyway, getting back to the reviews.
 
S: If someone reacts "Oh look, it's that author again! Time to find every problem with it, right from the first page!", they're basically a fan already, right, if they read into it that deeply?
 
S: So I think you're almost there, Wasshi. You definitely have a lot of soul poured into your novels.
 
T: S-Sonocchi... Thank you.
 
T: A lot of soul poured into them, huh... Gin said something like that too once. Remember, when we were helping her pick out a present for Tetsuo-kun.
 
S: What about these? Building blocks.
 
Su: Isn't that too childish?
 
S: Not just rectangular bricks, let's make them in all kinds of weird shapes, like stars and clouds!
 
Su: I see, to stimulate creativity that way. I've heard building blocks are good as an education tool as well...
 
G: Hold it there. Where are we going to find the wood to make them out of?
 
S: You'll go to some mountain and chop a tree down with one of your axes, Mino-san!
 
G: My axes aren't logging tools!
 
Su: I've heard that there were puzzles shaped like Japan's regions. Won't that be good? Not just Shikoku, but all of former Japan turned into puzzle pieces...
 
Su: It'll help him learn our country's history.
 
G: Well with you around, we could make it. I'd be no good on my own. I don't even know what else there was outside of Shikoku.
 
Su: It's written in our textbook, though. Look, here's the map of Japan from before the Divine Era. By the way, the opinions on what Japan's capital back then was were divided...
 
S: Zzz...
 
G: Sonoko just fell asleep. Fell asleep with a really cute look on her face.
 
Su: Uh... Maybe a child wouldn't be very interested in something like that.
 
G: Oh, apparently some father made a plane model out of wood as a present for their kid. Says so on the net.
 
Su: A boy should definitely like that, a good idea. Now, about the wood for it...
 
S: Mino-san will go to the mountains to chop it!
 
G: I told you! My axes aren't for logging!
 
G: Okay, I know. I'm going to make a book! 
 
G: Write a story myself, turn it into a book and give it to him. You write novels, right, Sonoko? Kind of like that.
 
S: Yay, me and Mino-san are going to be writer buddies!
 
Su: Uh...
 
Su: G-Gin... Writing a story is harder than you'd think... Maybe try something else?
 
G: It's fine! Well, not that I'm very good at writing, but as long as I pour my heart into it, it should work out! Just gotta have guts!
 
S: Yeah, and all three of us are going to be working on it together, so it's gonna be fine.
 
Su: I see... Makes sense.
 
S: Oh yeah, that happened.
 
Y: Everything I hear about her makes Gin-chan sound like a really fun and amazing girl.
 
F: Even though we don't know her, for some reason it feels like we've already met her somewhere. 
 
Y: Can you tell us more about Gin-chan?
 
I: Just like Onee-chan said, even though there's no reason why we should know her, for some reason... The scenes Tougou-senpai is describing just pop up into your head.
 
S: On the topic of novels, there was this too. When she was helping out with ideas for one of my stories...
 
G: So like this?
 
Gin was firmly princess carrying Sumi.
 
S: Aah! That's right! Keep it up! Ideas are gushing out like a flood!
 
G: Are we done yet, Sonoko?
 
S: No, a little more!
 
Su: Sonocchi, it's embarrassing to be in this kind of position.
 
Sumi mumbled while being held.
 
G: And I'm getting tired. Gin-sama here might be a well-trained Hero, but holding someone for a long time is still hard.
 
Su: *cough* W-Well, I suppose it's at least a relief I'm not that heavy, right?
 
G: I wonder about that. Aren't you pretty heavy, thanks to those fruits attached to your body?
 
Su: There you go with your fruit jokes again...
 
S: Okay now, can the two of you refrain from having dream-shattering conversations? Be more romantic.
 
S: I was basing the characters in this story on you two already, so when you actually do the pose I envisioned my creative urges go into full force.
 
Su: I'm glad to help you with your writing, but...
 
G: What next, Sonoko? Should I give Sumi a kiss?
 
Su: Wha-What do you mean? A kiss?
 
G: I-It's a joke! Don't act embarrassed, you're making me embarrassed in return!
 
S: "It's a joke, you're making me embarrassed in return!"...done. Ooh, what a good line! 
 
G: Don't just copy that! I'll charge you money for that!
 
S: This happened.
 
F: You two never change, do you.
 
S: I would like to grow up remaining the way I am.
 
F: Huh. Alright then, let's have the second-years tell us their resolution for the next year, starting with Nogi. What kind of third-year do you want to become?
 
Y: A third-year like you, senpai!
 
F: Yuuna, if you woo me any further, I'm going to propose.
 
I: Yuuna-san sure gets a lot of proposals.
 
T: And I'll prevent this one too. Defense! Defense!
 
I: The resolve to defend even if she has to resort to Western words!
 
S: I guess my resolution is: 23 centimeters!
 
F: What is?
 
S: I want to do my best to be of use to everyone.
 
K: Yeah, that's the core idea of the Hero Club!
 
F: Nogi, you had a long period of hardships, so don't you want to have fun?
 
S: I'm already having fun with everyone here!
 
S: And during that period of hardships, I was allowed to be pretty selfish.
 
The old priestess at the front bows to the enshrined Sonoko and begins talking.
 
Pri: Oh most esteemed Nogi Sonoko-sama, please allow me to humbly speak to you.
 
Pri: The current safety of our land is the fruit of your efforts, Sonoko-sama, and your glorious deed verily surpasses even those of the fallen warriors revered for eternity. May I inquire how you are feeling today?
 
S: Your introduction's too long.
 
S: "Hey, Sonoko! How's it goin' today!?". Just that would be enough. That's what you wanted to say, right?
 
Pri: I could not address you in such a discourteous manner, Sonoko-sama.
 
S: If you waste 80% on the introduction and just 20% on the real issue I'll doze off before you get to the point. Are you fine with me dozing off?
 
Pri: ...I shall see what I can do.
 
Pri: We shall do anything in our powers if it eases your heart, Sonoko-sama. So please do not hesitate to call upon us.
 
S: I want to eat a Manchu Han Imperial Feast.
 
S: I want to see manzai and rakugo and noh and kyougen live.
 
S: Mahjong looks fun. I'd like to try it.
 
S: ...Like that. Well, they totally ignored the most important request: to let me meet Wasshi. Even though I would've been fine with just that.
 
T: Sonocchi...
 
S: Of course I'd get angry when they spoke to me that one time.
 
S: When the wall was broken, that is.
 
Pri: Sonoko-sama. One of the current Heroes, Inubouzaki Fuu has gone out of control. Additionally, as you may have noticed already, Tougou Mimori is showing concerning behavior... We beseech you. Please lend us your power.
 
S: So I just need to transform and stop Inubouzaki Fuu's rampage, right?
 
Pri: We beg of you, Sonoko-sama.
 
S: I think I'll wait and see how things turn out.
 
Pri: Sonoko-sama. Were the Heroes to go on a rampage here, it would endanger not only the Taisha, but even the Shinju-sama... The world itself.
 
S: Yeah. We're in big trouble, aren't we.
 
Pri: If the world is destroyed, then for what purpose did Minowa-sama lay her life down for?
 
S: If we all die, then I'll apologize to her lots on the other side.
 
Pri: Eh?
 
The Taisha person let out a stupid-sounding voice at such an unexpected anwer.
 
S: Right now, the feelings of Wasshi, who's alive, are more important to me.
 
Pri: S-Sonoko-sama...
 
S: I want to see what the Heroes are going to do when they know the whole truth... I want to let them to as they please... Because it's not like I can know what they feel.
 
Pri: But in the worst case, the entire world will...
 
S: So...what? Am I supposed to transform and fight Wasshi and her friends?..
 
Sonoko said, directly looking at her.
 
S: Bullshit.
 
S: I sure told them back then.
 
T: Nothing less from you, Sonocchi. Thank you.
 
F: We sure put you through a lot there... Thanks, and I mean it.
 
S: Oops, looks like we got off-track.
 
S: Nibosshi, what's your goal?
 
K: To become a proper third-year.
 
Y: I think you're already proper enough, Karin-chan. Right?
 
I: Definitely. You're as proper as can be, your room is tidy too.
 
K: No, I still have a long way to go.
 
K: (Especially when it comes to human interaction...)
 
K: I want to talk to various people, about various things.
 
F: Well that's great! You have a wonderful goal there, Karin.
 
K: And, obviously, I'll give it my best supporting Itsuki.
 
I: I will be counting on you.
 
S: Wasshi, what kind of a third-year kid do you want to become?
 
T: One that protects the Hero Club's six tenets and our daily life.
 
Y: Ooh! Sounds awesome!
 
F: Tougou became so gallant after rescuing Yuuna, didn't she?
 
S: This kind of Wasshi is wonderful too.
 
Y: Ah, by the way, Itsuki-chan, how is your becoming a singer going?
 
I: I got a response from them. But with the situation being like this, it's not going particularly smoothly.
 
S: The situation being like this is exactly why songs are needed right now. Do your best, Ittsun.
 
K: Munch munch munch.
 
F: Karin, should you really be consuming dried sardines at such a speed? We don't know if or when the food supplies are going to return to normal yet.
 
K: It's fine. I have some stored up.
 
K: Or rather, my brother stored them for me.
 
F: But don't they go bad unexpectedly fast? Half a year or so, wasn't it?
 
K: Stored properly, they can keep for two years.
 
S: As the dried sardine supplies dwindle and demand rises, Nibosshi becomes the dried sardine minister thanks to her vast storage!?
 
K: Then I'd just donate my emergency sardines to those in need.
 
S: Your brother must be having a rough time too.
 
K: He is. But he's in good health, and that's what matters.
 
Y: So was our volunteer task for today supposed to be cleaning?
 
F: The rebuilding efforts are facing a lot of trouble right now, so probably.
 
Y: We even thought about a new play for the kindergarten, but when we'll do that is kind of up in the air now.
 
F: Eventually the demand for that kind of stuff will rise too.
 
I: Let's keep thinking about the contents.
 
T: I was supposed to play the role of a robot created by the enemies who rampages in the harbor and throws ships around, right?
 
Y: With real life being like this, maybe we should rewrite it from action to something more heartful?
 
S: But we're still doing this for kindergarteners, so it'd be more interesting if there was a lot of movement.
 
The random chit-chat continues...
 
The restoration volunteers work the fields, hoe in hand...
 
There are attempts to contact regions there was said to be a reaction to...
 
The girls gripped on tight to the peaceful days.
