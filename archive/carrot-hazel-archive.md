### Prelude 1: On the tale of a valiant wolf, and a mischievous cat so far
“It’s as beautiful as always, don’t you think?” the Lycanroc affirms with a bark
“Sure, for you! You were not drowning just down there in the ocean” The Liepard replies slightly annoyed with a hiss, “But yeah, sunsets will always make me happy, it’s an omen that the night is finally arriving”
The Liepard keeps watching the sun being swallowed by the darkness of the ocean close to the edge of the ravine, where they first met, the golden orange sky, the same tones of the Lycanroc, being taken over by the purple hue of the incoming night, the same color as hers
“I guess it’s your call, Carrot, somewhere between the light and darkness, serving two lords, or rather, a lord and a lady”
“Whatever you say Hazelnut, I will always be part of the light path”
“That’s Hazel for you, I’m starting to think that it’s not an accident anymore, not after ten times” she says, slightly sarcastic
“Eye for an eye, you keep calling me Carrot” he answers, unfazed by the large cat
“Because you still don’t remember your name, and refuse to take another, oh well, we should start moving before it’s too late” Hazel says, starting to walk away, Carrot following him
“Are you going to miss this place? You still have time to turn back, Carrot”
“Not without you, it was a promise, remember? And besides, we already told guildmaster Chesnaught that we’re leaving”
“Yeah, you think that he’s going to miss us?”
“I hope, Arcanine will do at least”
Deep in the forest, both Pokemon walk, the sounds of hundreds of other critters moving around, ready to slumber once again, and others waking up to roam around the dark, starry night
“So, a new start, huh? You really can’t stop thinking about adventuring, don’t you Rocky?”
“Never, that’s the best *we* do, and the only thing really…”
They stop near a clearing, the same place where both evolved almost at the same time
“You never told me why you decided to reject the moon carrot, and the sun too”
“I’m not sure, I just didn’t feel like either of them were calling me particularly strong, both wanted me, so I decided to embrace the sun and the moon, and it worked”
“And not only that, here we promised to stand by each other, and never let the other down, remember?”
“Just like it was yesterday…”
**7 Years prior**
“This sucks…” A small Rockruff whined, kicking the dirt and pebbles on his path, just some weeks earlier, he had been a human, or that’s what he thought, not remembering what was his name, looks, or even where he came from, just a memory deep inside him, saying that he was human
“Maybe I should just surrender, those mean dogs keep beating me…” he thought, weakened, his last meal… just some hours prior, he got lucky and a nice Wurmple gave him an apple, it was not much but he wolfed it down in mere seconds, making the terrified worm slither for her life
“No! I will not stop! I have to find a way back! I just need a small chance for… what is that?”
In the distance, he could see a weird purple thing floating on the ocean, it looked like a Pokemon!
“Hey! The currents are too strong! Come back!” 
No response
“Hey! Can you- keep afloat!”
Not waiting for an answer, the small dog jumped straight into the water, paddling was still alien to him, but he had to learn quickly or he might be too late by then! He kept paddling as fast as possible, quickly closing the distance on the floating Pokemon
He noticed that it was unconscious, so not asking a question, he grabbed it by an arm with his mouth, and started dragging it back to the shore, it was a daunting effort, but with lots of effort, he was able to clear the five meters to the edge of the beach where the sand was dry, the cat was immobile
“Come on! Wake up!” The Rockruff barked, before doing what he thought could double as the Heimlich maneuver (AN: Compressing the cat with his front legs lol), after some bumps, the cat started coughing the water while starting to open its eyes
“Are you ok?” The Rockruff asked, doing laps around it, nervous
“Ughhh *Cough cough*… Arc-“ The cat passes out once more, but just for some seconds, before jumping back, still coughing water
“Hello? Can you understand me?”
“Y-ye *Cough cough* yes, I can understand you… what happened?”
“I found you in the deep water and I dragged you here, what were you doing there?”
“I wa- I wa- *Cough*… I don’t remember”
“That’s bad, are you feeling ok? Anything hurts?”
“N-no… I don’t think so” The cat stands up wtf
“Phew, I was on time… what’s your name?”
“My name? It’s… i-“
“Amnesia too?”
“Yes…”
“Good! I- mean, not good, but I have amnesia too!”
“…” The cat sits, Rockruff can see a small piece of metal with a string, like a collar
“Hey, you have a tag, maybe I can read it…”
It was more of a courtesy, as Rockruff clearly couldn’t read whatever language Pokemon used, but to his surprise, the medal was in what seemed to be plain English! How convenient!
“Here it says…” He reads the medal, it says “Hazel”, there’s something else written on it, but it’s scratched beyond reading
“Hazel? Is that your name?” 
“I- think it might be it if was on my neck… and what is yours?” The Purrloin asks
“Well, it’s easy, I have a name but I don’t remember it, so while I remember it… I have no name!”
“… I’m going to call you Rocky”
“R-rocky?”
“Rocky, Rockruff, simple”
“Rockruff? What is that?”
“Your specie? You don’t know your specie? What I am?”
“I- don’t know…” he looks sad
“It’s ok, you have it worse than me, I’m a Purrloin”
Hazel quickly gives him a rundown of the world, thinking that he might just be even more amnesic than her, while they’re talking, Hazel started walking into the forest, getting as far away as possible from the beach
“And what about humans?” Rocky asks
“Humans? Those are a legend, some say that they still exist, but- “Something clicks on her
“S-something’s wrong Hazel?”
“… are you a human?”
The dog is unable to hide his surprise
“It’s that obvious?”
“Not really, from afar you look like a normal Pokemon, but if anyone asks you anything, they might discover you”
Both stay silent for what are seconds but feel like hours
“… thanks for saving me, Rocky, and I want to repay you, but I don’t have any money…”
“I know! Come with me!”
“… what?”
“Yes, come with me! I need to learn more of this world, I promise I will never leave your side!” He jumps to a rock that was in front of him
“… what?”
“Oh, cmon, it’s not like we have anywhere to go anyways, let’s stick together while we remember who we are”
“… fine, but just until we remember who we are”
And that’s how the partners came to know each other, 7 years prior
**Present times**
The Lycanroc and the Liepard keep walking through the forest, maybe for the last time, their few belongings in bags, tied up to their backs, courtesy of guildmaster Chesnaught
“So, shall we stick together Hazel?”
“As you say, Carrot”
“… STOP CALLING ME CARROT FOR ARCE-“
The barking and hissing continues for a while, walking far away from the place they call home, ready for their new adventures


###Prelude 1.1: On the subject of food gathering and poor planning of meals
Deep in the forest, the orange wolf/dog and the purple cat keep on walking, dissapointed and with their stomach empty
"Maybe eating all the food in one go wasn't a good idea..." Carrot whimpers
"Don't think about it, we coulnd't expect that no one is taking new recluits in..." Hazel purrs hungrily
Overconfident, they thought that they could get a place in any guild they wanted, but most guilds were not accepting new 'mons or veterans, and although they directed the duo to a relatively new guild (It was not even registered yet), it would still take some days for them to get there
"Well, we have no other option, we have to forage for something, anything" Carrot stops, ready to hunt
"Like... berries? I saw a Chesto bush while we were walking" Hazel points
"Perfect, i have some Pechas, and surely we can find some Rawsts close" Carrot barks
Decided, the duo start foraging, it's not long until they find the bush Hazel mentioned, taking all the berries they can take (And planting two), they're now only missing one for Hazel's signature dish
"I still wonder why i still remember how to make berry salad, maybe Arceus really wanted me to keep that memory?" Hazel ponders, still hunting for the missing berry
"Or you really liked it and it's ingrained deep in your mind, in any way it's incredible" Carrot barks closely, sniffing for any traces of the berries
"I don't think we're finding any here" Carrot whimpers, defeated
"Eeh, we can still make it without the Rawsts, it's not that important"
"If you say so..." Carrot gets ready for the cutting
Hazel lines half the berries on a piece of bark with a rock on Carrot's side and half on hers, ready for the game
"Ready?" Hazel asks
"Always ready"
"Well..."
.
.
. 
The dog/wolf and the cat keep a keen eye on the other, waiting for the slighte-
"Fetch!" Hazel jumps on the improvised catapult, throwing a berry at high speed directly to Carrot
"Who-" Splash, the berry explodes on Carrot's muzzle, dripping in berry juice
"Heh! You're slowing do-" Hazel can't finish the tauting before a berry hits her in the faze, covering her in berry juice
"Said something?" Carrot is proud of his almost perfect throw
"... good hit, maybe we shouldn't be wasting our food" Hazel huffs
"Correct, last one!" Another berry is thrown at great speed directed to Hazel, but she was expecting it, cutting it perfectly with sharp claws
Now with the game over, the duo cut the rest of the berries and mash them together, before serving a portion on each's wood bark
*Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch*
After a relatively fast meal, the duo is ready to keep on advancing... if it wasn't too late, the sun showering them with radiant (And hot) beams
"... maybe we should nap" Carrot mentions, pointing at the convenient tree that almost perfectly covers the sun beams
"Absolutely" Hazel accepts
Both curl up side to side, cowering from the radiant sun
"Have a nice sleep, Carrot" Hazel yawns
"*Yawn*, you too Hazel"
It's not long before both are deep asleep

###Prelude 1.3: Combat and spar
The orange wolf and the purple cat stand vigilant, ready for a fight to (not) death.
"You first; I started last time," Carrot barks.
"You know that hitting first is not my thing, carrot." Hazel purrs, almost an invitation for those unaware of her tactics.
"If that's the case, Surprise sand!" Carrot kicks a small but dense cloud of sand straight at Hazel, who masterfully dodges the low blow.
"You should open in another way; you always start with a sand attack, and I can simply" copycat Carrot's sand kick, this time hitting Carrot dead on.
"Heh, you too should start changing tactics." Carrot barks, keeping a keen eye on Hazel, although the sandy feeling is not as horrible as you think.
Carrot stomps the ground hardly, making some stealth rocks grow on Hazel's side.
"Stealth rock? That's new; when did you learn it?" Hazel asks
"Some days ago, in that dojo, I remember not learning it at first, but maybe entrapping works well."
"In that case, let's see how you play now." Hazel uses torture! Her deep eye burns through Carrot's soul, making him incapable of doing the same move more than once!
"The eyes again? I know what you're going to do, so let's get going!" Carrot bunnyhops, accelerating before finally crashing into Hazel with his signature Accelerock! Hazel is launched backwards but, as always, is able to land perfectly.
"Blaw! I forgot that you can run, Wolfie, but can you outrun this darkness?" Hazel uses Dark Pulse! A series of dark pulses emitted from her, affecting Carrot!
"That still feels weird, but I can do that again!" Carrot howls to the moon, smiling upon him in the sky! His howl revigorates him!
"Checkmate!" Hazel jumps forward on the pointy rocks, hurting her a bit before rolling just below Carrot before...
Throat Chop! She kicks him straight in the throat, sending him back! Ouch
**KO!**
Carrot wheezes and coughs a lot for a few seconds before trying to stand up. Still weak, Hazel is already on his side.
"Tie?" Hazel asks mischievously:
"*Cough cough*... tie" His voice is raspy.
With that, Hazel gets another win.

### Misc. Overviews
***

####Carrot
>“Carrot” (Nickname), a male Dusk Lycanroc, he’s a seasoned explorer and former member of another Guild, arrives at the Clover Guild along Hazel sometime after it was founded, in the called “Second wave”, he’s brave, courageous, and some even say incredibly reckless, he will not stop at anything or anyone if he believes that Hazel or any innocent pokemon is in harm’s way or under any peril, at that point his eyes turn bright red like a Midnight Lycanroc’s, becoming almost unstoppable, unleashing his full power, in some cases excessively, after all those years he still doesn’t know his name, so officially he doesn’t have one, although Hazel decided to give him the “Carrot” nickname after he said that “He looked like a damn carrot” after evolving, he has great respect for the sun and the moon, calling them his “Guides” and “Masters”
>>Interactions
>Be someone new or an old friend, Carrot will always talk casually, cracking jokes (Sometimes a bit too far, and mostly lame) but keeping a high degree of respect for them, he will treat anyone equally, be a simple townfolk or a federation agent, this might cause misunderstandings and to some pokemon to even feel offended for his layback attitude
>While in combat, however, any drop of casual talk disappears, becoming almost authoritarian, barking orders, and in some cases, even screaming to be heard
 
>>Misc.
>He wears a purple scarf on his neck, and for a time, some broken sunglasses he found in a mystery dungeon, he keeps his badge on either the scarf or a bag he wears for quick access to his objects
>He has an irregular white patch of fur on his side due to a powerful ice move that he tanked, burning the nerves and causing the fur pigmentation of that patch
>His ‘Sigil’ is of the chariot as told by a Xatu, he will not stop until the job is done, or he considers it to be done
>Secret: He still misses the flavor of meat and cold cuts like Salami, and has wondered how different pokemon would taste, but those are just intrusive thoughts and he will never even try it
***
#### Hazel
> Hazel, a female Liepard and Carrot’s partner, she’s a seasoned explorer and former member of another guild, arrives at the Clover Guild along Carrot sometime after it was founded, in the called “Second wave”, she’s quite mischievous, calculated, and some even say incredibly reckless, unlike Carrot she prefers to trap her foes with the use of almost-guerrilla tactics and pre-planned traps, that sometimes are not marked at all, triggering by other pokemon, she didn’t remember her name, but a small collar with her name was found alongside her, so she supposes that Hazel is her real name, she considers Carrot’s idea of the sun and the moon to be foolish

>>Interactions
>Hazel is a trickster by default, her entire personality is being mischievous or at least a jokester, so she might laugh a bit while talking
>While in combat, her voice turns slightly softer, an omen of her traps and trickeries she has prepared to her foes, to the point of almost being enticing

>>Misc.
>Her 'Sigil' is that of an inverse star as told by a Xatu, her loss has bringed her fortune in her life
>She wears a golden scarf, with her badge(s) on it, along with a secret oran berry she keeps as a safeguard in combat
>Along that, she also has two small bags that work as quick access to blast seeds and healing/reviving items
>Secret. One of the only things she can remember of her past is a black and red shadow, that, although is scared of, knows was important in her past
