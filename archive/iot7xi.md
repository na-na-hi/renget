#Kay Lee's Relationship Chart

[TOC]

##Disciples
>Yasha
Aww, the cute little junior! Doesn't have many/any friends, seems to have a really bad reputation. Comes from a group that apparently did awful things, I wasn't really paying attention. He's also wanted with a bounty, so I feel a sense of kinship there. Nice pets too.

>Ming Ming
Do not underestimate her. Not in fighting, she could be flicked away, but in interactions. She haggles, negotiates, just really good at business all round. Can take all your money before you know it! Always has good stuff for sale though. Good little merchant.

>Zheng Hao
Poor guy, he's a complete cripple. He's got incredible Qi control, but still, he's a normie when it comes to physicality. So, no proper fighting. That's fine, he's a gentleman and a scholar, extremely well-educated in his chosen field of medicine. He always comes across as desperate though, he's clearly got some demons in him.

>Nobu
One look at this guy is enough to determine his character. He's rotten to the core, only out for making this world as foul as possible. He's violent and murderous, and while that can often be entertaining, it's the murder and not the battle that he wants. Needs sense beaten into his head, but how deep the rot is in his very soul, even that may not be possible.

>Yexin
She's weird and smells funny. Acts more like an animal than a person most of the time, and fights like one too. Suits me fine. We share a philosophy when it comes to weapons, that being the body is the only weapon one should need, but her definition of "body" is...fluid. Lots of others think she's a future problem, so keep an eye on her.

>Lord Charles Maynard
What's up with his accent? What's up with his vocabulary? He's apparently not around from here either, but I can't imagine a place where everyone speaks funny like him. He's polite though, so he's far from the worst around. (Note: always greet him by knocking off his hat. It's hilarious.)

>Heng Zhiqiang
This guy. This guy has one of the worst stories for his start to power. Can't help but feel sorry for him. Hope he gets his revenge for his loved ones. Can't help but respect his perseverance in the face of fate. Not good company though; everything goes wrong around him, and that extends to everyone else in his proximity.

>Dónall
A...rabbit? A bunny can attain power in this world? Whatever. He's a foreigner from a foreign land as well, so we've got that in common. He also enjoys traveling, so while we rarely meet, he's a nice - albeit fuzzy - face to see.

>Qiáng Wěi - 強偉
Heh heh, he loves his "spear". I wonder how often he rubs it down, heh. All penis jokes aside, he's an extremely serious guy with little time or patience for any fun. His "spearfu" - the spirit within his weapon - is far nicer, and more open to conversation. Has no concept of sparring, leading to any attempts at such causing him embarrassment since he can't match me. Maybe he needs to practice more without killing his partner?

##Elders
>The Boneless Old Man
WHY IS HE CALLED THIS? HE CLEARLY HAS BONES! They stick through his skin, for crying out loud! And he claims he was once buff! He's a kind-hearted old guy, though shouldn't he be an ancestor by now? Th
is world's strange. Anyway, while he's no good for sparring, there's few better for fixing up the aftermath! Also makes nice cups of tea whenever I visit. Top tier guy.

>Dong Do
Freaky fish guy. All about peace, meditation, and reflection. We don't have much in common. He's one of those that seems out of place in this world. Everything is about fighting, and has been since the last god-king guy, right? So why waste time on peace when the will of the world is war?

>Xiu Yi
A clan killer. Those sorts can never be trusted. Still, I have yet to meet her, so I shall reserve full judgement until then. But she would have a large hill to climb to get into my good books. 

>Guan Chāo
Eeeeew! This guy is *literally rotting!* What kind of insanity would compel someone to do that to themselves? Apparently he's part of a devil sect, so no wonder those types have such poor reputations! Not met him yet, but I reckon I'd smell him before seeing him if the stories are to be believed.

>Gyldenwulf
He'd be cute if he weren't so tragic. I've fought him a couple of times now, and what I've seen is a complete stagnation. Like an animal that can't improve itself, he just destroys what he can, and seethes about what he can't. I wonder how many more times he can be a challenge before I have completely surpassed him? At least he's always up for a fight.

>Huang Yu
One of those feather-brained types, always dozing away contemplating the heavens instead of following the path they've laid out for this world. At least he's getting back into things with rebuilding his sect. Can't imagine sitting still for a year.

>Shu Luxing
Something smells off about her, can't put my finger on it. Apparently reincarnated wrong, so I guess that's sorted, but still. Anyway, seems a lot older than she is, related to the former point, but isn't a bad sort. Our Tao are supposedly similar, so maybe we'll get along should we meet again.

>Moriko Nana
Got her power from eating a herb? What kind of plants are about in this world? Would barely fight even to defend herself, so all that power is just lying around getting wasted. But all of this aside, she's a genuinely pure soul in this world, to the point that she gathers strength from simply making things better for others! Can't attack her for that. 

>Morgain Blackheart
Another one with a horrid reputation, and a bounty to go with it. Wonder if I could bring one of them in to get rid of my own? Despite her reputation, she still seems to have a popular traveling minstrel show. Must be mind control with the show tunes.

>Jian
Another devil type. They all stink worse than the maggot guy. She's a killer, cold and simple, and while that can be entertaining to battle, once she draws her blade she's out to kill. That, unsurprisingly, makes her a poor sparring partner, even though I can beat her. Outside of battle, she's this timid little thing, which shouldn't irritate me as much as it does. If you are so opposed to the path that your weapon has set you on, then take a hold of your fate and defy it!

>Mei Lan
Cute Maid! While the concept is new to me, apparently it's a whole thing over here, and Mei is the best! Serving others becomes self-serving for her, but that's clearly a side effect and not her motivation. Extremely nice company, would even spar with me when requested! Wherever and whoever finds her as a maid is clearly a fortunate individual. 

>Wen Lifen
A devil worshiper, but she doesn't reek like the others. Perhaps she's not all bad. She's definitely fun to be around, living life to the fullest, but unless/until she conquers whatever demon holds her under its sway, she'll find that more is always required, until there's nothing more to give and it eats her soul. Make sure not to drink what she offers, heard rumors that'll end up in her bedchambers.

>Lei Daiyu
She's funny. Both "ha ha" funny and weird funny. What kind of battle can be won with drums and thoughts? Power wins fights, power and skill. She's a great musician though, no doubt about that. Overall, she comes across as quite naive, or maybe that's just optimism? We don't agree on the state of this world, but she's still a nice person to be around. Until she gets boring. 

>Leanne Pierpont
Another friendly sort, she's always looking for more allies to face Gyldenwulf, and I'm always up for fighting him! (until he falls behind, but then only because it'd be dull.) Still, through learning her footwork technique, I can always find her! She's not bad in a fight either, better than she gives herself credit for. 

>Xicotl, Sixth Sun Nomad
Haven't met this guy, but from what I've heard, don't call his gods demons. He doesn't like it, and he fights to kill. He's apparently a strong warrior, with bizarre techniques that are from his gods. Strange. Still, not the worst guy around, despite the rumors of heart ripping. 

>Lan Jìngměi (蘭 静美)
I like food. Jìngměi is the best chef around. Therefore, I like Jìngměi. Not complicated. Seriously, this woman can make ANYTHING taste great, and with how keen she is for friendship, I'm happy to be friends with her! Beyond this though, she's another good sort. Not one for either cruelty or complacency, which I appreciate. 

>Pàng Jīng
This comes across as more of a monster than of a cultivator. It seems to be sentient to some extent, but it definitely stretches that term. Easy to stay away from, not much of a conversationalist, not much of a sparring partner. Just beat it up whenever it makes a problem.

##Ancestors
>Xū
Wow. Insanely powerful guy. Has apparently lived for thousands of years, and that was just his prison sentence! I tried sparring with him; it was as though he was fighting a baby, he was so good. While we don't agree on philosophy or Tao, I still have immense respect for him. Could do with a haircut though. If I didn't know how powerful he is, I'd wonder how he sees.

>Shu Shihan
Never encountered her, but a plant-woman guarding a forest of spirits that is also her soul is pretty par for the course around here. What isn't is how OLD she supposedly is, old enough to know what this world was like before everything was like this! I don't have any great inclination to meet her, but if our paths ever cross, tales of the ancient warriors of that bygone age would be fun to hear.

>Magikarp
A fish?! Well, between the OTHER fish, the bunny, and the whale, I shouldn't be surprised anymore. He (or she? I don't know.) is extremely skilled in a wide array of talents, but not cultivation, even though he's supposedly thousands of years old. What a confusing being. Just make sure not to eat whatever they ate that messed them up.

>Zhihao Cheng
I don't like bureaucrats, but I make an exception for one who proved their case themselves and paid the price for it. No cowering behind others, he had a theory and proved it! Doubt he'd be particularly interesting to talk to - laws don't interest me - but *how* he pulled off such a perfect reincarnation would be interesting. Or perhaps not, when I think about the price he paid for it. To lose all one's abilities... Then again, what use are they if they come at the whim of the distant and far off heavens?

>Po Kong
Never met him, but if the legends are true, I think even MY battle thirst has met its limit in him! I heard he's either the Sovereign of this age, or even a Sovereign from a previous age who was so powerful, that he was able to return from wherever they go! Sends a chill up my spine when I consider how everything there is in this world rests on his whims.

>Chenrezig Bodhisattva
To be perfectly honest, even if I did meet him, I doubt I'd understand the stuff I've heard about him. The words have too many syllables and weird sounds! Besides (again, if I've heard correctly) even at my current age I'd be able to beat him in a fight! Though I don't intend to put that to the test, I wouldn't want to find out I was wrong and be forced to reincarnate as a monkey or something!

>Fēn Jiàngé
Another ancestor I haven't met, but I have heard the tales of The One Who Cut His Own Soul. Honestly, sounds like he had a skill issue in his past life. I wonder if he'll repeat the mistake? Probably not, but that's funny to think about. Though I doubt he'd find me laughing at it amusing, he's apparently got a stick up his rear. But if you can't have that attitude at his level of power, when can you have it?

>Meng Zhen
I haven't met her either, and don't want to. Stories of her make her seem atrocious, always playing with people and pulling strings from the shadows. Not my scene at all. Still, this world is large and vast, and with its size, I am sure I won't have to deal with her or her cult.
R-Right?

##Mortals
>Five Mortals
Well, what's there to say about them? They're mortal, that's about it. They seem to be good friends, so good for them, I guess?
