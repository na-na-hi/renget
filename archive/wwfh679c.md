#Senanon's Unofficial Guide to Custom Jutsu

[TOC]

###Preface
The following is a guide intended to help anons create and categorize any custom Jutsu they want to make for their builds. It contains core relevant information to the nature of Jutsu for those unfamiliar with the setting, as well as a soft stat system intended to help anons consider the strengths and drawbacks of their techniques.

This guide is not in any way an enforced rule for builds or writing and is purely intended as an aide in the creation or comparison of custom Jutsu. Participation in the format is completely optional and any advice given in the guide is purely from my perspective, as well as helpful input from some other anons. Further, it is important to remember that no writeanon is obliged to follow this guide or read any build's custom Jutsu as any information here exists outside of the rules of the Naruto CYOAG.

###Thoughts on Custom Jutsu Etiquette
- It is generally presumed that most writeanons will base your character's Jutsu repertoire on the vibes of their actual build. Nobody has the time or energy to meticulously catalogue dozens of abilities every time they write a short story. For this reason it is recommended that you keep the number of your character's custom Jutsu - ideally ones you want to see used - to a small handful. This increases the chance of writeanons seeing and remembering them without causing information overload.
- To give a better structure to the power scaling and prevent powergaming, this guide makes suggestions on limitations for your character's Jutsu. If you feel as if the limitations presented prevent you from achieving what you want, consider adopting other limitations of your own design instead to balance out your character's abilities. As tempting as it might be to create an instant win button, it is highly unlikely that writeanons will take such seriously and will likely either downplay the Jutsu on their own, or ignore it entirely.
- The nature of Jutsu in Naruto means that two characters using the exact same technique with the exact same level of energy might see different results depending on skill, talent, Chakra nature and other factors. In this case, the guide is only concerned with creating the core description of the Jutsu - you can presume that any other abilities, perks, Chakra natures and the like provide a stacking 'edge,' when using the ability by slightly increasing power, efficiency, speed and the like, but never enough to change the Jutsu's class entirely. A C-Class Fireball is a C-Class Fireball, regardless of if it's used by John Uchiha or Jobber McGenin, John Uchiha's is just likely to have a minor edge in all brackets.
- Kishimoto wasn't interested in writing a hard magic system for his setting - he was a storyteller first and foremost. This guide is therefore collected from his own works as well as some third-party material like the Naruto Databooks. Not all canon Jutsu will have the information needed to properly compare to, for this reason I will leave a catalogue of canon Jutsu using this method at the bottom of the guide to try and help compare.

###What Is A Jutsu?
Simply put, a Jutsu is a shorthand for any technique where a ninja uses Chakra to create an effect. Anything from mind control to summoning firestorms, healing wounds, telepathically communicating or simply punching someone really hard are all considered Jutsu. Jutsu tend to have relatively specific *intentions* rather than scientifically measurable *effects*, as various factors can account for differences in power and interactions. For the most part, a Jutsu's *intention* is usually simple, like 'throwing a fireball' or 'causing blindness,' though the process of 'casting' the technique is significantly more discrete. At first this may appear too vague a definition allowing for effectively anything - while that is technically true, this guide will take you through a step-by-step process for how a Jutsu is defined to better determine which ones your character can learn and generally help streamline what they can do.

###What Is Chakra?
While the manga and show end up streamlining all forms of energy into 'Chakra,' for ease of explanation during the panels, this is technically inaccurate. Anyone who has read or seen the first few arcs will know that the actual system is more complicated. A rough explanation of Chakra and other forms of energy can be found below.

**Energies of the Body (Yin, Yang)**
Despite what the HyÅ«ga Clan may tell you when trying to rapidly explain a complicated concept, living bodies do not naturally possess Chakra - instead, they possess Yin and Yang. 

Yin, or mental energy, is the supernatural energy that governs the mind, senses and spirit and is typically associated with cleverness, empathy and wisdom - the smarter, more enlightened or more insightful someone is, the more control and larger their reserves of Yin energy.

Yang, or physical energy, is the supernatural energy that governs bodily health, power and control and is typically associated with strength, skill and stamina - the more physically fit someone is, the more control and larger their reserves of Yang energy.

**Chakra**
Chakra is what happens when Yin and Yang energy are combined - this process is referred to as 'kneading Chakra,' and commonly requires a great amount of physical and mental concentration in the unskilled. As a ninja develops their techniques, they find themselves capable of generating Chakra more efficiently, faster and with less concentration - eventually, most ninja are capable of kneading some level of Chakra instinctively, but it is very rare for them to be able to knead a greater deal of Chakra quickly - as is required of most Ninjutsu - without standing still and focusing.

Chakra is fundamentally far more volatile than Yin and Yang, and is capable of bonding to and interacting with other kinds of energy also. The process of transforming or bonding Chakra to other energies, often referred to as 'weaving Chakra,' is far more complicated than kneading, and is the source of handsigns and other rituals - while these aren't strictly necessary to weave Chakra, the process is so much more difficult without them that even Jonin and Kage might struggle to weave effectively without handsigns, particularly when under stress.

**Elements**
The five Elemental Releases - Wind, Fire, Lightning, Water and Earth represent the most fundemental and readily-known forms of energy and matter that Chakra can directly transform into. With the right pattern of weaving, Chakra can literally become a wall of fire, bullet of water or bolt of lightning. These Elemental Releases are not 'pure,' elements however, and are highly reliant on the remaining Chakra impurities within them to maintain - as such, a firestorm made by a Fireball Jutsu might be 'unweaved,' and absorbed by a Chakra-cancelling technique where a normal, natural fire might not.

Sometimes two or more Elemental Releases might be combined to create other effects - Ice from Water and Air, for example. Due to the extreme complexity already required in weaving Chakra into elements, it is generally impossible for ninja to perform this alone and often requires longer rituals or multiple ninja working together. Some possess an inbuilt talent - known as a Kekkei Genkai - that allows them to combine Elemental Releases on their own, but even this rare ability only usually allows one or two specific combinations.

Most people possess a 'Chakra Nature,' - a shorthand for an affinity towards one of the Elements. While any ninja can theoretically use any Elemental Release, their personal spiritual nature makes their Chakra more receptive to being weaved into the Elements of their Nature, making any Jutsu reliant on that Nature significantly easier to learn, as well as more powerful and energy efficient.

**Outside Energies (Sen, Ju, Shin)**
The world is brimming with energies that exist outside of the Human body and the nature of Yin, Yang and Chakra. These energies come in many forms, but the most commonly utilized by ninja are Nature (Sen), Negative (Ju) and Positive (Shin). These forms of energy cannot be replicated by Chakra but, through highly difficult and advanced techniques and rituals, may be moulded alongside Chakra to create effects of superior power and versatility than those offered by Yin, Yang and the Elements.

Sen, or Nature Energy, is highly related to Yin, Yang and the Elements - when combined with Chakra it creates 'Sage Chakra,' which is the foundation of 'Sage Arts.' At first glance, Sage Arts are indistinguishable from regular Elemental Releases, but there are two key differences - firstly, Sage Arts are massively more effective and energy efficient than regular Jutsu and secondly the Elemental Releases created by Sage Arts are considered 'purer,' and therefore less susceptible to effects that negate, absorb or dispel Chakra.

Ju, or Negative Energy, is associated with negative emotions, decay, death, darkness and other 'evil,' themes - when combined with Chakra it creates 'Cursed Chakra,' which is the foundation of Cursed Arts. Cursed Arts often take on a far more sinister and mystical theme than regular Jutsu, and is often used for literal curses as well as the manipulation of souls or the empowerment of regular Jutsu to take on a darker, more destructive or malicious form.

Shin, or Positive Energy, is associated with positive emotions, health, life, light and other 'good,' themes - when combined with Chakra it creates 'Divine Chakra,' which is the foundation of Divine Arts. Divine Arts are usually the domain of holy men and are more miraculous than regular Jutsu - from less scientific healing than Medicine Arts to exorcisms or the empowerment of regular Jutsu to take on a lighter, more enlightened or divine form.

###Jutsu Format
The following is the format I used to create Jutsu. Each stage will be explained later in the guide. This format is compiled from explanations in the manga as well as some Databooks and is not an official format in context of the setting - it is simply a guide to help categorize techniques by their most important factors.

**Name:**
**Type:**
**Nature:**
**Class:**
**Stats:**
**Description:**

####Name
All Jutsu have a name that identifies two things - the broader 'Arts' that the Jutsu is derived from as well as the identifier itself. It is normally done with a prefix of the Arts and then the actual name, for example;

**Fire Release: Great Fireball** - The 'Great Fireball' Technique of the Fire Release Art.
**Fire Release: Majestic Destroyer Flame** - The 'Majestic Destroyer Flame' Technique of the Fire Release Art.
**Illusory Arts: Hell Viewing** - The 'Hell Viewing' Technique of the Illusory Art.

The prefix comes in a great variety depending on the source, but largely follows the same format;

**{Element} Release -** Governs the direct usage of elemental natures (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, Water) as well as sub-types (Poison, Ash, Ink etc.) and Kekkei Genkai elements (Blaze, Wood, Storm etc.).

**{Type} Arts -** Governs the usage of most advanced or non-elemental Jutsu subtypes. Curse Arts, Barrier Arts, Sensor Arts, Illusory Arts etc.

If you are not sure which prefix to use, consider which of your build's abilities is being directly applied.

**A Note on Taijutsu**
Taijutsu is typically an exception to the prefix rule and can simply have a name. However, if you would like to tie in multiple Taijutsu techniques to the same style and maintain a sense of consistency, consider using the style as the prefix, for example 'Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.'

####Type
All Jutsu possess a type - either Taijutsu, Genjutsu or Ninjutsu - followed by any additional subtypes they possess. For example, a sealing Ninjutsu may have the Ninjutsu (FÅ«injutsu) type. While most Jutsu have a single subtype, it is possible to have multiple - for example, a Cursed Arts-buffed illusion is likely to have the Genjutsu (Jujutsu, Illusory Arts) type.

#####Taijutsu (Body Techniques)
Taijutsu covers the manipulation of one's own physical energy (Yang) - one of the two separate components of chakra. It is normally used to perform feats of athleticism or physical combat - including unarmed and using a weapon. It also technically governs any mundane physical skill, like sneaking, enduring physical trauma and handiwork. Taijutsu experts are faster, stronger, tougher and more energetic than their fellow ninja. 

Low-rank Taijutsu might not even use chakra at all, instead referring to the thousands of blocks, steps and strikes taught across the world's martial arts. High-rank Taijutsu might allow one to use chakra to explode their physical prowess to supernatural levels, make singular strikes that can destroy buildings or regenerate their own wounds. Taijutsu is typically much faster and easier to use than Ninjutsu or Genjutsu, requiring little 'setup time,' like handsigns, but is often the least effective per technique - Taijutsu practitioners will usually string combinations of various techniques together rather than rely on a single ability to end a fight.

#####Ninjutsu (Ninja Techniques)
Ninjutsu covers by far the most versatile skillset. It involves combining one's physical energy (Yang) and mental energy (Yin) to create Chakra - this Chakra is then transformed into an effect that is often not covered by one's natural physical or mental abilities. In a vast majority of cases, Ninjutsu is released in one of five elemental forms - Wind, Fire, Lightning, Earth and Water - which are either spontaneously created or manipulated by the user's Jutsu. In rarer cases, Ninjutsu may also be used to manipulate Yin, Yang or other energies entirely. Ninjutsu practitioners are the most varied of ninja - from power-hungry sorcerers utilizing the strongest techniques available to canny improvisers with a large array of less powerful, but more versatile tools.

Low-rank Ninjutsu might be something as simple as lighting a candle with Fire or blowing a loud gust of Wind from the lungs. High-rank Ninjutsu can level entire villages in tidal waves, cause earthquakes, summon thunderstorms or cause blazing infernos. Ninjutsu is typically the slowest, most energy expensive and complicated form of technique, requiring an exponential setup time and Chakra expenditure as the power increases - for this price, it reaps the rewards of being the most powerful and versatile of the three core types.

#####Genjutsu (Mental Techniques)
Technically translated as 'Illusion Techniques', Genjutsu covers the manipulation of mental energy (Yin), both one's own and others. It is most famous for being the foundation of illusion techniques, but is also capable of other effects governed by the mind and nervous system such as sensing, telepathy, mind reading and mind control. Genjutsu experts are typically the most clever and manipulative ninja - they have to be, for despite its grim reputation, the control offered by Genjutsu is far less complete than most believe.

Low-rank Genjutsu include single-sense, brute force or uncontrolled illusions, in addition to basic sensory and communication techniques like telepathic messages or enhancing a single sense. High-rank Genjutsu can trap others in a world entirely of the user's design, share complex memories amongst multiple people, project thoughts across the world or even allow the user to temporarily develop entirely unnatural senses of extreme clarity. Genjutsu is often the most energy efficient type of technique, but ironically lacks versatility - most Genjutsu require a specific form of contact to introduce the Jutsuto another's Chakra system, and virtually all Genjutsu can be dispelled either by a more skilled 'reverse,' of the Genjutsu or, more often, a brute force reset of the chakra network.

#####Subtypes
In addition to the three major types, there are dozens of subtypes - these are typically layered on top of the core three. A single Jutsu does not usually have multiple subtypes, but it is far from unheard of. There are too many subtypes to fully list and describe, but the most common ones can be found below.

**Barrier Arts (Kekkeijutsu)** - Creation of barriers, wards and reactive Jutsu, typically blended with other arts such as with a Sensory Barrier.
**Communication Arts** - Sending, receiving and storing of mental energy (Yin), such as via telepathy or encoding thoughts into objects.
**Concealment Arts** - Hiding yourself, others or objects using Chakra such as via coded illusions, minor transformations or warding away Sensory Arts.
**Cursed Arts (Jujutsu)** - Blending of negative energy (Ju) with Chakra to create 'unholy,' effects otherwise unattainable with just Chakra.
**Divine Arts (Shinjutsu)** - Blending of positive energy (Shin) with Chakra to create 'holy,' effects otherwise unattainable with just Chakra.
**Elemental Release** - Creation or manipulation of one of the five Elements (Fire, Wind, Lightning, Earth, Water) or its combinations (Storm, Scorch, Lava, etc.)
**Illusory Arts** - Direct manipulation of mental energy (Yin) in order to control sensory input.
**Medical Arts (IryÅjutsu)** - Manipulation of the body's cells, tissues and organs via Chakra, usually in a medical capacity such as improving regeneration or extracting poison.
**Nullification Arts** - The use of Chakra to destroy or disrupt existing energy constructs in order to weaken or negate Jutsu or disperse concentrated energy.
**Ritual Arts** - Can be applied to most existing Jutsu - the usage of tools and other long-term ritualistic techniques such as occultism or complicated arrays of tools to make other Jutsu far more powerful than a user could do alone. Efforts can also be combined with other Ritual Arts practitioners for even more benefits. Ritual Arts are far too complicated and long-term to perform under active stress, but can dramatically enhance virtually any other Art.
**Sage Arts (Senjutsu)** - Blending of natural energy (Sen) with Chakra to create 'natural,' effects - typically elemental effects of greater purity and power than could be done by Chakra alone.
**Scroll Arts** - Jutsu focusing on the manipulation of scrolls, tags, marks and other Chakra-based tools. Includes things like the remote activation or manipulation of tags. Highly related to Ritual Arts.
**Sealing Arts** - The input of energy, objects or individuals into a seal until released. Most commonly used to store prisoners, tools or even other Jutsu for future use, may also negate other Jutsu by sealing the effect away rather than nullifying it. 
**Sensory Arts** - Manipulation of mental energy (Yin) to enhance one's senses, or to create entirely new senses.
**Summoning Arts** - Conjuring of objects or individuals from other places - usually requires some form of connection to the item, such as a seal or blood contract. Is also used for teleportation effects such a substitution, sometimes referred to as 'Space-Time' Jutsu.
**Tool Arts** - Jutsu focusing on the manipulation or usage of tools, such as using threads to channel Chakra.
**Transformation Arts** - Techniques designed to change the physical nature of an object or creature, often temporarily. Sometimes these transformations are purely aesthetic, other times they may confer additional benefits such as superior strength to a user.
**Unarmed Arts** - Jutsu focusing on the manipulation of one's own body as a weapon or tool, usually Taijutsu.
**Weapon Arts (Kenjutsu)** - Jutsu focusing on the manipulation of weapons, usually Taijutsu techniques for using or enhancing them. Highly related to Tool Arts.

####Nature
Most Jutsu require a specific form of energy, sometimes multiple, the nature of a Jutsu determines which energies are used. Most ninja have unique affinities for one or more kinds of energy, dubbed 'Chakra nature,' - in these cases, a ninja will find Jutsu that match their affinity are more powerful, more efficient and easier to learn. In a vast majority of cases, Jutsu will only possess one nature, as channeling multiple forms of energy at once is virtually impossible without a Kekkei Genkai or multiple ninja working together - rare exceptions exist.

**Yin (Mental)** - Mental energy, covers virtually all Genjutsu.
**Yang (Physical)** - Physical energy, covers virtually all Taijutsu.
**{Elemental}** - Usually an element (Wind, Water, Fire, Earth, Lighting) or their combinations (Blaze, Storm, Lava etc.), covers most Ninjutsu.
**{Energy}** - In some cases, an additional kind of energy is required than Chakra, particularly with Sage (Nature), Cursed (Negative) and Divine (Positive) Arts. As these energies cannot be produced by the body, it is unlikely that ninja will have affinities for them. These natures are the most likely to be combined with Yin, Yang or Elemental natures, but are most commonly used on their own. 

####Class
Jutsu come in dramatic variations of power and ability. While there is no scientific method for evaluating the power of a technique, they are separated into various Classes, broad classifications of how advanced a Jutsu is. These Classes offer a general expectation of the Jutsu's potency, as well as how difficult it is to learn.

Jutsu Classes are categorized by the expected level a ninja would be when they are likely to master them. Below is the common expectation of what an average ninja might possess in their repertoire;

**F-Class** - Non-Ninja
**E-Class** - Academy Students
**D-Class** - Genin
**C-Class** - Chunin
**B-Class** - Jonin
**A-Class** - Kage
**S-Class** - N/A

Note that it is not uncommon at all for ninja to have Jutsu of one class higher than normal in their specialty - two is considered a extreme talent and the realm of savants, three is virtually unheard of. In this case, it is recommended that your highest Class of Jutsu is calculated as follows;

1 Ability Rank - Character Rank
2 Ability Ranks - Character Rank +1
3 Ability Ranks - Character Rank +2

For example, a Genin with Sensory Arts 2, Communication Arts and Barrier Arts 3 is capable of using C-Class Sensory Jutsu, D-Class Communication Jutsu and B-Class Barrier Jutsu. A Jonin with the same abilities would be capable of A-Class, B-Class and S-Class in those same arts respectively. It is also presumed that your character is capable of all Elemental Releases equal to their Character Rank in their chakra natures.

Basic Jutsu are always considered E-Class, with the exception of Utility Jutsu, which are F-Class. However, despite their lack of power, as these Jutsu are simple and Chakra efficient enough to be utilized instantaneously and with little worry of Chakra expenditure, they might be trained almost like mundane skills, and practice in these fundamentals can radically alter a ninja's combat style - particularly when combined with higher-Class Jutsu.

####Stats
Though there are dozens of different components of a Jutsu, for the purposes of this guide there are four statistics intended to represent its general advantages and disadvantages - particularly compared to others of its Class. This is done for simplicity's sake and covers as many avenues as possible while still remaining vague, feel free to put additional context into the description.

Stats are measured on the following scale;

**E** - This Jutsu is terrible in this regard.
**D** - This Jutsu is notably below average in this regard.
**C** - This Jutsu is average in this regard.
**B** - This Jutsu is notably above average in this regard.
**A** - This Jutsu is exceptional in this regard.

The four stats are as follows;

**Power** - Determines how potent the Jutsu's effect is. The higher this stat, the more likely it is to accomplish its goal, or the more effects it can have. Ninjutsu tend to have higher Power, while Taijutsu tend to have lower Power.

**Range** - Determines the Jutsu's reach, both in literal distance as well as considerations of other methods of the Jutsu reaching its goal, such as through shadows. The higher this stat, the longer or broader its reach. Most Taijutsu and other techniques exclusively involving the user's own body have a Range of E, while most techniques that can be used on others but require touch have a Range of D.

**Usability** - Determines factors like complexity, number of hand seals and other requirements such as the necessity for a specific environment or other limitations. The higher this stat, the easier and quicker it is to use under pressure, such as in combat. Taijutsu tend to have higher Usability, while Ninjutsu tend to lave lower Usability.

**Efficiency** - Determines how energy-intensive the jutsu is. In most cases, this is a direct representation of how much chakra is required, but may also represent additional resources needed like blood or cursed energy. The higher this stat, the less energy it requires and the less it taxes the reserves of the user. Genjutsu tend to have higher Efficiency, Ninjutsu tend to have lower Efficiency.

To determine a custom jutsu's stats, begin by applying 'C' to every category. Then, for every increase in one rating, reduce another by the same amount. For example - Power A, Range A, Usability E, Efficiency E would represent a Jutsu of extreme power and reach for its class, but costly in terms of Chakra and difficult or complicated to use. To prevent powergaming, it is recommended that this method always results in an 'average,' of C.

**Class & Stats** - It is generally presumed that stats are used to compare Jutsu of the same Class. When Jutsu of different Classes are compared, the general expectation is that for every Class above the other, a Jutsu gains an additional three levels of Power, but reduces its Usability and Efficiency by one each.

For example, a Class-C Fire Jutsu with C in Power, Range, Usability and Efficiency would be equivalent to a Class-D Fire Jutsu with S Power (an otherwise impossible amount), D Usability and D Efficiency.

####Description
The specific capabilities of a Jutsu are virtually endless - this is where you may describe any intricacies or intentions behind the technique. As the capability of a technique fluctuates wildly between different users considering differences in talent, skill and other factors, it is recommended that the description remains relatively vague. 'A large, highly destructive fireball,' is easy to parse and write creatively for, 'a thirty foot radius fireball,' is too specific. Similarly, it is also good to acknowledge that while all Jutsus may attempt to to something, their attempts may not be successful - for example, a Fire Sealing Jutsu may *attempt* to seal away a Fire Jutsu, but will not necessarily be guaranteed to do so, perhaps only partially sealing or completely failing to seal it depending on differences in Power.

It is also here where any additional limitations - such as requirements of outside energy or circumstances, should also be specified. These limitations can be as specific as you want, remember to consider them when determining the Usability stat. If no additional limitations are specified, it is generally presumed that the Jutsu's Usability rating directly determines by the length and complexity of the handsigns, and the Efficiency rating directly determines how much Chakra it expends.

###Your Jutsu & You - Thoughts On Jutsu Contests, Clashes & Build Interactions
Though a majority of Jutsu should be used to further the story rather than be used to create arguments, it may be inevitable that someone wishes to compare two different Jutsu against each other - or even the same Jutsu used by two different people - to see which is stronger, faster, etc. While the barebones foundations of this can be found in the Stats section, here's a few thoughts on how I'd compare Jutsu 'fairly,' using the rules present in the MCYOAC.

####Comparing Power Directly
When comparing two Jutsu directly clashing with one another - be it two fireballs or a sensory ability trying to pierce and concealment art - it is generally presumed that the Power is the easiest method of comparing which Jutsu is stronger in the conflict. A Power A Jutsu of D-Class is slightly stronger than a Power B Jutsu of D-Class and much stronger than a Power C Jutsu of D-Class.

When comparing Jutsu of different classes, remember that each Class is presumed to have *three* points of Power over each Class below it. A C-Power Jutsu of A-Class is three Power higher than a C-Power Jutsu of B-Class, and **six** Power higher than a C-Power Jutsu of C-Class. You'll note this gives Jutsu of a higher Class an extreme advantage - this is intentional, as not only is it also presumed higher Class Jutsu are more Chakra-expensive and difficult to perform under stress, it also requires more specialized investment to possess them in the first place.

####Comparing Speed Directly
Sometimes it might be important to decide who uses a Jutsu first - perhaps one ninja intends to summon a colossal fireball and another counters with a less powerful but quicker Jutsu - in this situation it might matter exactly *how much earlier* the counter goes off, if at all. There are no rules determining a specific amount of time, as I believe that is both unnecessary and likely to cause arguments. Instead use the vague comparison of Usability - much like with Power, a Usability A Jutsu is far faster than a Usability C Jutsu.

When comparing Jutsu of different classes, remember that each Class is presumed to have *one fewer* point of Usability beneath each Class below it. A C-Usability Jutsu of A-Class is one lower Usability than a C-Usability Jutsu of B-Class, etc. This makes lower Class Jutsu inherently faster by design, this is also intentional, and it is a common strategy amongst ninjas to interrupt more powerful Jutsu with swifter, lesser techniques - this is also the reason why ninja do not commonly begin with their high-end, powerful Jutsu, for fear of countering or wasting Chakra if it's avoided, and will usually try to set up a scenario where their stronger techniques are more sure to land.

####Jutsu 'Advantage'
Plenty of things in a character's build make them better at certain Jutsu, as might many other situations - further, some characters have practiced some Arts so closely that they can produce stronger effects or weave a Jutsu with fewer handsigns. Rather than meticulously categorize a system to determine how a character is better or worse than their peers, I would recommend a simple concept of 'Advantage.' Simply put, for every thing in favour of the user's Jutsu, they have an 'Advantage,' over their enemy - Advantage stacks, and both sides can have Advantage. In the case where two Jutsu are equally matched in Power or Usability, a character with more Advantage might be able to beat the Speed Comparison, Power Comparison, or both if they have a particularly large number of Advantage over their opponent.

**Things That Give Advantage**
- Elemental Natures each have an advantage over the other. Fire is strong against Air - Air is strong against Lightning, Lightning is strong against Earth, Earth is strong against Water, Water is strong against Fire. Strong Elements have 1 Advantage over their Weak Elements.
- Any Perk that makes you better at a multiple kinds of Jutsu (e.g. Skilled, Gifted) gives 1 Advantage with Jutsu of that type. Talented gives 2 Advantages with Jutsu of that type, Prodigious gives 1 Advantage to all Jutsu (as it lacks any additional benefits).
- Chakra Nature (e.g. Fire, Yin) gives 1 Advantage when using Jutsu of the same Nature.
- Ritual Arts gives 1 Advantage per rank of the ability to all Jutsu that are turned into a ritual. 
- For every Class of technique a character is capable of OVER the Jutsu they are using, they gin 1 Advantage. For example, a Jonin with Sensory Arts 2 is capable of A-Class Sensory Arts - they would have 1 Advantage for B-Class Sensory Arts and 3 Advantages for D-Class Sensory Arts.
- A strong presence of aligned energy, such as using Cursed Arts in an 'evil land,' or Water Release in rain gives 1 Advantage. Earth Release is always stronger underground, Wind Release requires active movement of Wind rather than the simple presence of air.

###Example Canon Jutsu

####Fire Release: Great Fireball
**Name:** Fire Release: Great Fireball
**Type:** Ninjutsu (Fire Release)
**Nature:** Fire
**Class:** C-Class
**Stats:**
Power B
Range C
Usability C
Efficiency D
**Description:**
A common Ninjutsu developed by the Uchiha Clan in ages past, the user creates a great amount of chakra in their belly, ignites it into, then expels it from their mouth as a large fireball. It is highly destructive, has adequate reach and isn't particularly complicated on handsigns or cumbersome to use - it does, however, require quite a large amount of chakra and for this reason is used as a rite of passage for the Uchiha youths as their own reserves grow with them through adolescence.


####Fire Release: Majestic Destroyer Flame
**Name:** Fire Release: Majestic Destroyer Flame
**Type:** Ninjutsu (Fire Release)
**Nature:** Fire
**Class:** S-Class
**Stats:**
Power A
Range B
Usability D
Efficiency E
**Description:**
The pinnacle of the Uchiha Clan's art of exhaling flame, this jutsu requires a colossal amount of chakra and forces the user to remain stationary during a long exhalation. The benefits to this are apparent - a massive tide of uncontrolled flame is projected, stronger, further and wider the longer the user maintains it, potentially reaching up to hundreds of meters. Very few in history have mastered this technique and fewer still have the chakra reserves to utilize it to its full potential.


####Illusory Arts: Hell Viewing
**Name:** Illusory Arts: Hell Viewing
**Type:** Genjutsu (Illusory Arts)
**Nature:** Yin
**Class:** E-Class
**Stats:**
Power D
Range C
Usability C
Efficiency B
**Description:**
One of the fundamental Genjutsu taught during the academy, Hell Viewing is incredibly simple in that - unlike most Genjutsu - the user does not have any control of the illusion. Instead, the chakra attacks the portion of the brain responsible for fear and conjures a vision of something terrifying to the victim. It is highly efficient and easy to inflict, but comes with a major flaw - without any ability to control the illusion, and without any supernatural persuasion behind the image, it is highly susceptible to being recognized and - given a strong will - subsequently ignored by the target.

###Example Custom Jutsu - Sen's Signature Techniques
In these examples, I will be using my build Sen Yamamoto, a Genin participating in the ChÅ«nin exams. For those unfamiliar, the following portions of the build are necessary for consideration:

**Rank: D** - Sen is a Genin and as such her highest Class of Jutsu will begin at D-Class.
**Nature: Wind** - Sen possesses only one Chakra Nature, Wind - it is presumed she is capable of D-Class Wind Releases without any additional abilities, and is also presumed that her Wind Releases are slightly stronger, more useable and more Chakra efficient.
**Utility Jutsu 3** - Sen has a very high rank of Utility Jutsu. As all Utility Jutsu are F-Class, it is presumed that she possesses dozens of these techniques, but none of them are powerful in the slightest.
**Sensory Arts 3** - As a Sensor Type, Sen has a massive focus on the Sensory Arts and is considered a rare prodigy in the field. Due to having 3 ranks in Sensory Arts, she is capable of increasing her 'base Class' of D all the way to B specifically for Sensory Jutsu. As this is the only field in which she possesses exceptional talents beyond most Genin, it will be the sole focus of her custom Jutsu.

####Sensory Arts: Zero Sages Watching
**Name:** Sensory Arts: Zero Sages Watching
**Type:** Genjutsu (Sensory Arts)
**Nature:** Yin

**Description:**
Sen draws Yin energy away from one or multiple of her senses and redistributes it to others. This effectively allows her to rapidly prioritize her own senses as she deems fit, such as dulling her sense of taste and smell in order to sharpen her eyesight. It is significantly less Chakra-efficient than more basic sense-enhancement techniques for little extra gain, but its true intended purpose was to combat Genjutsu. In the event that a Genjutsu requires a target sense to be inflicted, she might simply draw all energy from the sense and cut off the Genjutsu's vector entirely - such is not an entirely faultless defence, as it leaves her without that sense for some time, but sometimes it is better to be rendered completely blind than suffer more dangerous visual Genjutsu.

**Description:**
Normally, a sense-enhancing Jutsu can only improve one of the user's senses - this Jutsu was designed to overcome that limitation. By flooding her entire nervous system with Yin-enhancing Chakra, this boosts all six of Sen's primary senses, including all of their secondary functions to multiple times their normal sensitivity and clarity. Though quite Chakra inefficient as it requires a constant intake, it allows Sen to increase her overall perception and reaction speed quite significantly - as the boost is tied entirely to the nervous system, it does not make her any stronger, faster, more skilled or more agile, simply capable of processing stimulus at a faster pace.

**Description:**
Essentially the concept of Ten Sages Watching taken to the next level, this Jutsu simply increases the amount of Chakra flooding Sen's nervous system and thus exaggerating the effects - at such a stage, her senses become entirely supernatural, becoming capable of tracking almost-invisible movements, developing a rudimentary sense for Chakra levels and processing the world around her as if in slow motion. Other than the increased Chakra requirements, this Jutsu is more difficult to master than its predecessor due to the hypersensitivity it inflicts on the user - without proper control and moderation of the sensory input, the user would be dazzled by faint glares or rendered in agony by the slightest pain. Rumors of a final, even more powerful variant of this technique persist, but this Jutsu currently lies at the pinnacle of Sen's abilities.
