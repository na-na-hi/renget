Omori hadn't felt this way before, unleashing slash after slash on this intruder in White Space He'd never felt anything like this, not since...
Mari(?) didn't have room to attack. She could only dodge, a few times she had the audacity to even block with her shovel. The pattern on her shirt. The lines, the way it formed on her skirt...it was undoubtedly his-the violin. Omori kept wildly swinging, wanting nothing more then to sever her strings.
He didn't understand why it sent him into such a frenzy. He loved *Mari*, so why was she of all people making him this mad? Why did they even start fighting in the first place? Why...why did he *want* to hurt *Mari*? Somehow these questions stopped bothering him after a while, looking at her shape for too long. All that mattered was hurting her, making her pay, break it for hurting his fingers, for all the long hours, for all the pain this STUPID VIOLIN-

Omori only realized when it was too late. He was exhausted. He'd spent the past few minutes blindly swinging and chasing after her that he lost all his Juice, and energy. He stood there, hands on his knees and panted. He heard the sounds of slow footsteps towards him. Even after mustering all the energy he could within his exhausted body, all he could do was look up. *Mari* stared at him with a look almost reflective of his usual cliff-face. Empty. Lifeless. Pained. And yet...he saw it, too. It was faint, but...*Mari* was angry. Was she mad at him for attacking her, or was it similar reasons he-
She slowly reached out her left arm, and gently nudged him. In his weakened state, Omori fell flat on his back, still panting for energy.
Was she...going to kill him? Or what? What could she do from this position? His confusion only furthered as she threw her shovel away.

Omori watched curiously as *Mari* got to her knees. And then lowered herself further, having to use her elbows to prop herself up. A jolt ran through his body as she suddenly, and without warning, pulled down his trousers and spread his legs enough for her head to fit between them. His eyes widened even further, as it finally, finally clicked what she was about to do. Panic overwhelmed him. He couldn't fight her off like this, he had exhausted himself and there was literally nothing he could do now, she was going to ravish him all over, what could he-
His penis sprang to it's full length. *Mari's* eyes widened a little. Omori couldn't help but shyly lower his head. It wasn't...Well, he was ~~12~~, so it wasn't going to be... That shame was quickly washed away by a warmth enveloping his penis. Looking back, he saw *Mari's* head bobbing up and down. Her empty eyes stared right into his. She was still mad, but...why was she doing this for him if she-
"Nh-ah-!"
Omori's thought process was interrupted by the first sound to ever leave his lips, and the last one he would have ever thought to do so. A moan. A soft, gentle sound that was so unlike him escaped as *Mari* devoured his penis, easily taking it in to kiss his crotch and slobbering her tongue around it. Omori unconsciously moved a hand to cover his lips and suppress these foreign sounds coming from him. But *Mari* reached one of her hands over to hold his, gently prying it away from his lips. She didn't let go, only tightening to squeeze his hand between hers.
She loved him. It was that last thought which broke any restraint in his mind as Omori's released his first ever load directly down his sister's throat. *Mari* had tightened her lips and took it all in to drink. Omori couldn't help but watch her throat's movements as his fluids went down.
Omori still felt exhausted, his mind racing at what had been happening in the last few minutes.
He didn't have too long to think, as he felt a suction pull on his penis. He looked at *Mari*, who had started again. 
"Ah-ngh-no-*Mari*-aahaa-!"
The sudden stimulation on the already oversensitive Omori was enough to instantly bring him to orgasm. Another load, almost half as much as the first, went directly down *Mari's* throat. He noticed a flicker of irritation across her face as *Mari* redoubled her efforts. Even when he came again, she kept going. She refused to stop as she drained him of all he was worth. Even with the vice grip her lips had on him, small bits leaked out between her lips onto his crotch. It was overwhelming, unlike anything he felt before, even in Headspace. Nothing there had ever come close to this feeling. Moans started escaping more freely from his lips, and he  starting thrusting his hips. He couldn't see it, but *Mari* was starting to get into it, too. She matched her movements to his, squeezed her lips tighter and her hand around his even tighter, and slowly learned what was making him react the hardest. Omori's face had tears spilling down it from overstimulation and exertion, the cutest and feeblest of sounds escaping from is messy face.
Before long all Omori could register was the feelings rising and bursting in his dick, and *Mari's* hand tightly wrapped around his...
...
Omori was a mess. His vision flickered. His stomach rised and fell with intense breathing. Wet stickiness was all over his crotch.
And *Mari* had small dribbles down her chin, looking down on him from above with a stare as empty as the lightbulb hanging over them.
And that's when she spoke her first words he had heard from her. "Little brother...Omori." Omori shivered at the force she spoke that word with.
"It breaks my heart to hear you forgot my name after all this time. It's Hikiko." An odd feeling of recognition flashed in his brain.
"Hi...ko..." Was all Omori could mumble, barely able to register the sister shaped figure above him.
"Hehe. Still so cute. Alright, I'll forgive you this time." Her voice sounded like hers, but without any of the warmth. And yet, it was there...
Omori's vision started darkening. A part of him felt like he was going to die...but Omori would not succumb. He would wake up sooner or later.
Hikiko rested besides her cute brother, and gently pulled him over to face her on his side and pulled him in a tight embrace. After a moment of thought, she raised her skirt so Omori's penis could rest in-between her thighs. It only took a few seconds of gently caressing him between them to cause one last, feeble spurt. The last sensation Omori felt before ~~waking up~~ dying was one last pitiful climax, feeble moans that could only escape as whimpers, and his fading vision finally recognizing a clear emotion on Hikiko's face as she nuzzled against his.
Love.

Sunny felt exhausted beyond belief when he woke up. Like he had run a thousand laps around Otherworld while carrying a hundred Pluto's. He was this close to just closing his eyes and drifting off again, but his stomach hurt too much. If he went to sleep without food he might not wake up again.
Somehow, that wishful thought encouraged him to sit up. His room had early morning light filtering through the window. It was enough for him to see the figure of a girl rise up from his side, long hair flowing. His eyes widened. She let out a yawn and stretched, before looking around seemingly confused, before turning to face him. Her eyes soon mirrored his. She looked like she would have screamed, had she not recognized him immedietely.
...
"Su...Sunny?" She whispered, face stuck between too many emotions to read.
Sunny didn't respond. He reached his hand under the blankets to hold her hand. It felt like her hand.
...
It was Mari.
Mari fully burst into tears after squeezing his hand back. "SUNNY!" She yelled as she pulled him into the tightest embrace of his life
And her lips were very quick to give him a kiss he had never felt from her before. He returned it.
