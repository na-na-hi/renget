>Coco yawns, reading manga in the comfort of her room
>Suddenly the door slams open, startling her; Kanata stands under the opening, shoulders slumped forward 
>Drags her feet until her knees reach the edge of Coco's $9000 bed, opening her arms and falling face-first on the cushion
>Coco lifts an eyebrow. "What's up, Kanatan?"
>"Hihed," she mumbles, her voice muffled
>"Wuss'at, I can't hear you!" 
>Kanata turns her head sideways, freeing her mouth. "Tired..."
>Coco chuckles. "They're really putting you through the wringer, huh?"
>"Dance lessons, rehearsals, recording a new orisong, then two collabs this week. I'm beat..."
>The small girl stays motionless on the bed as Coco gets up and sits next to her
>"Is it comfortable?"
>"Mmm." Kanata nods
>"Need a pillow?"
>"Hmm..." She nods again
>Coco smirks, then lays down perpendicular to the angel
>"Here you go." She pats her chest - her large orbs nearly spilling out from her top
>Kanata raises her head, confused until she sees just what Coco was doing
>A sudden burst of energy fills her body
>"Uwaaaah! Boobs, boobs!" She's quickly crawling over, resting her face on Coco's pillowy mountains
>The dragon blushes lightly when Kanata rubs her face against her skin
>"Yosh, how's that? Feeling better?"
>"Boobs, boobs boobs boobs!" The smaller girl begins to settle down, resting the side of her face in between both
>"Yeah yeah, I get it." Coco brings a hand over to her head and begins to pet her head. 
>"Mmm... You smell nice." Kanata's voice starts to fade, her eyes heavier and heavier
>Coco chuckles, continuing to play with her hair
>"Good night, Kanatan."
>"'ood 'igt..." 
>The two fall asleep together, taking a long afternoon nap.
