I don't think unrepped nations should be written for in the first place until someone from their thread comes in to write for it, but if it is to be done, then guidelines for it would be a good idea.
The content of these guidelines should remain malleable.

No. In the end, I vote for my thread, not for a region.
To add, a devolution in voting topics, such as small scale border changes, does seem like a good idea.
