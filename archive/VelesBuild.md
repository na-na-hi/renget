##Appearance
Since Veles is a Tanuki, she can take on practically any form, though her true form remains that of a small raccoon-like animal.

Veles' favourite human form stands approximately 161cm tall. Her hair is light brown in color, reaches down to her neck or longer depending on the feeling of the day and is usually kept loose. Aside from the hair on her head, eyebrows, eyelashes and bushy tail when not explicitly hiding as a human no other traces of hair can be found on her body. Her eyes are similarly brown and have a calculating look about them. Out on the sides her ears are either human or racoon-like when not hiding. Her nose is small and unremarkable. Even further down her chest sports a pair of respectable breasts. Down some more her butt is deliciously filled out. In general her build can be described as neither unhealthy or fit. Her skin is unremarkably fair. Muscle-wise, there's nothing to speak of.

In terms of clothing they can usually be found wearing either a simple yukata or a shirt and skirt. Though through [Transmog] are also capable of showcasing quite the collection of costumes.

##Attitude
A trickster scamp who loves nothing more than playing pranks on others.
Loves traveling to and exploring places she hasn't been to or re-discovering old haunts.
Interested in experiencing new things so as to be able to improve her repertoire of illusions.
Quite the foodie, enjoys all manner of cuisines, though her personal favourite remains nuts.

##Plans

Trick an Arbiter

##Profile
[EOH Name]
Veles

[One line description]
Trickster Tanuki Traipsing Towards Trouble

[Personality]
A loveable(?) troublemaker who travels the world seeking for ever greater entertainment and chances
to expand on her own skillset. Easily gets in and out of several problematic situations mostly of 
her own making. Wanted in several cities for dine-and-dashing though none of the descriptions ever
seem to match her current looks. 

Great animal lover, would sooner throw a humie off a cliff than see an animal suffering. Will not
acknowledge or deny the veracity of this specific example. Has a publicly declared grudge against 
Kitsune and Kotengu and will rant about how Tanuki are superior to both others when pressed about it.

Though some pranks may get out of hand, she doesn't actually hold any malicious intent towards her
victims and will attempt to rectify any serious problems she deems to be her fault.

[Backstory]
Dropped into the great wilds by Arc and left to fend for herself, Veles quickly learned that letting
your enemies see, hear, smell, taste and feel what they expect to using Illusion magic was the best
and most fun way to survive the wilderness.

That being said, she quickly grew bored of playing with the animals, monsters and the occasional elf
in the forests and began her search for civilization. A search which was significantly sped up by her 
discovery of an overgrown riftgate that spat her out near Encore after she used it to escape the 
aforementioned elf who had come back for round 2 with some friends.

This signalled the beginning of a long pattern of Veles arriving in a new location, her having fun
exploring and playing tricks on the locals and one of them eventually getting annoyed enough to chase
her out, only to start the cycle anew someplace else.
