**Name:** Haitham Montcroix

**Face:** Very friendly, confident face. Usually has a smile or wide grin on most of the time. A morning person, and has energy levels already online shortly after he wakes up and and gets ready for the day.

**Hair:** Short, jet black hair. His hair is voluminous and slicked back, short and a bit wild. It is surprisingly soft to the touch.

**Eyes:** Light, clear sky blue eyes. They seem even lighter due to how it contrasts with his dark hair.

**Height:**  Among the tallest boys in his class, standing at 6'3"/ 191 cm. The tallest among the Quidditch Keepers so far, and a very useful trait for the position.

**Bodytype:** Constant movement and activity every day ranging from Fitness club, Quidditch practice, self training, and running or flying everywhere lead to a very well maintained, athletic and muscular body. 

**Complexion:** Spends most of his day outdoors, so he has slightly tanned but relatively clear skin. Has a distinct scar across his right eyebrow from a childhood incident. 

**Uniform variation:** Almost always has rolled up sleeves. Usually wears the Slytherin diamond casual vest in warmer seasons or the Tartan Blazer School Uniform in the colder seasons. Usually wears his Quidditch robes or the Embossed Tailcoat over his clothes as well. Always wears the Striped House Colour Scarf or the Golden Snitch scarf, along with a pair of black leather gloves.

**Misc:** Visible abs/muscles.

**Voice:** Loud, deep, and booming voice, especially as the Announcer during Quidditch games (even while playing). French is his first language so he still has a sliver of an accent. Since he grew up predominantly in Bristol, he has a refined British accent barring some words that have him revert to a more French one. People in general tend to forget he is actually French.

**Body language:** Confident, stands and sits up with a straight posture. Makes direct, full eye contact to anyone he speaks to. Usually has hands on his hips, crossed over his chest, or in his pockets in a "power stance" of sorts.

**Social:** In a relationship with Niamh Campbell from House Hufflepuff. He is extremely fond of and quite protective of her, especially since she is about the only person that can fully distract him from his thoughts about Quidditch, which knowing him, is surprising considering his burning passion for the sport. A new, confusing, but welcome feeling for him. Has to be extra careful with bludgers sent by her during matches, though. She is quite deadly and formidable as the Beater of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team. Other than that, being the Keeper and captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team, a member of many clubs, and his generally extroverted personality, makes him pretty well known around the school. Considers everyone he meets as his friend, but the people he considers "closer" friends to him are James, Artorias, Matthew, Faolán, Alice, Ava, Ioni, Margaret, Cora, Addie, and both Evalyns. Has a good relationship with everyone in the Quidditch teams, the Fitness club, and the Supply and Demand club as well. Has a soft spot for Hufflepuffs, but usually still gravitates to his fellow Snakes. He didn't have any friends growing up at all and was extremely lonely due to his family's upbringing and reputation as solitary scholars. As a result, he tries his best to treasure the ones he has now, as well as to try to get along with everyone he meets.

**Visibility:** His size and voice in general makes him hard to miss, especially when he's usually yelling enthusiastically about Quidditch. It is very hard to miss the shining nuclear green glow he emits often as well.

**Engagement:** Very likely to approach and befriend new people, especially to get them to join the Quidditch teams.

**Quirks:** Hates and feels weird if he isn't doing something. Staying still idly reminds him too much of his family back home forcing him to become a scholar like them, locking him up in a metaphorical cage. Almost always needs to be moving, and will pace back and forth if he's forced to stay in one place idly for too long. "A massive speeding bludger of pure uranium powered ambition" is the best way to describe him.

**Things your character wouldn't do:** Will never bully anyone. If he sees someone getting bullied, he'll always go straight to intervening. Doesn't have it in him to be genuinely mean-spirited or needlessly cruel, and generally just wants to get along with everyone the best he can.

**Animals:** Very fond of animals. An eagle flying freely that he saw during his childhood was one of the reasons he is what he is now. Is a hawk Animagus, and has an eagle Patronus. Has a pet dog named Leon.
