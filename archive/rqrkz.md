#Clean White Pants
Reine's stream didn't start until late, so Reine had the perfect opportunity to do some errands in the afternoon. Since Moona also had business in the city, she had decided to tag along as well.
"It's been a while since we've had lunch together, Moona-sempai. Would you like to go somewhere? My treat." She said.
"Why not?" Moona said, nodding. "I have a place I'd like to go. It's not too far."
Reine was hungrier than usual, so she went all out, trying many dishes.
"Can you really eat that much?" Moona said.
"I guess we'll find out!" Reine said, as she gave her trademark laugh.
Their paths diverged after lunch. Reine had a productive early afternoon, but before they were supposed to meet up again, Reine felt a bad pain in her stomach. She decided to settle her stomach with a tea.
She made haste to the cafe. She got in line, but unfortunately it was much more crowded than she was expecting. It was near the front of the line that she realized that maybe she should have just made a beeline to the toilet instead. These clothes were pretty expensive.
"What's your order?" asked the grumpy-looking lady at the front.
"Ice tea, please. That's it." Reine said, looking hasty.
Reine could feel something heavy inside her building up, pushing it's way out... but it felt like she just might make it. She clenched her asscheeks and fidgeted impatiently as the lady up front gave her her tea.
As soon as she got it, she pushed past the crowd and made a mad dash to the toilet... But, to her horror, there was a sign in front of the bathroom: Out of order.
Her clenching wouldn't help much longer. 
"Oh no... oh no!"
The shit emerged from her pucker, stopping for just a moment, just grazing her panties. Reine almost felt like she was going to make it. Moments later however, her intestines complained again, and she lost her grip on it. Her asshole stretched to accommodate the girth of the stool, as the ornate, fancy panties she had been wearing deformed and bulged outward. The white pants she was wearing were too thin to resist the force of her excrement, and they too ballooned out noticeably. The first log filled her panties completely, and it wasn't the only one that would force its way out of her.
The waitress's nose wrinkled in disgust, but her eyes had a strong sense of pity. She averted her gaze, but the rest of the crowded cafe didn't. Dozens of curious eyes looked on as Reine's second turd began to force its way out of her. Now sagging a bit from the load, the panties no longer blocked the stool from traveling into Reine's upscale snow white pants. Even from the outside it was easy to see turd snake out of the panties, saturate the seat of the pants with a brown stain, and begin making its way down her left leg. The crowd made their disgust known.
"Gross!"
"How disgusting...!"
Unbeknownst to Reine, too distracted to notice, there were even people who had whipped out their phones.
"Really dude?" One man whispered to his friend.
"Ah, shut up man. This is great, I know a guy who will pay good money to put this on the internet."
Reine's misfortune wasn't even over yet. Another loaf wanted release, and she couldn't deny it passage. The shit continued to push itself out of her panties, this time going down the right leg as well. Her legs trembled as the brown trails became longer and longer. The pants had been tight enough that the form of the shit could be seen, and white enough that the color bled through perfectly without even masking the color. Reine leaned against the wall, and covered her face in humiliation, as it finally emerged from the bottom of her pants, staining her socks and falling to the floor.
There might have been more to come, but Reine was able to finally get just enough control over herself from soiling herself any further. But the damage had been done. Trembling, Reine picked up her cellphone and called Moona.
"Moona... could you come pick me up at the cafe? And could you bring a skirt? And maybe..." Reine gulped. "...a... a spare set of underwear?"
