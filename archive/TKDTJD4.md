 🇺🇸🇯🇴 3 U.S. soldiers killed and 25 injured in Jordan - CNN

At least 3 U.S. soldiers have been killed and 25 injured in a drone attack in Jordan near Syria's border, CNN reports.

The killing took place in Tower 22, near the US-backed Free Syrian Army's Al-Tanf Military Base in Southern Syria.

According to CNN, it happened as a result of a suicide drone strike by Iranian-backed militias.

First of all, it wasn’t Iran. But this is part of US’ doctrine. They hold Iran responsible for any attack against them that causes a great blow, simply because they need an equal player. 

The upkeep alone, of 1 American soldier overseas costs the taxpayer $136,000 per year. Now, imagine the invested money into training that soldier and the expensive equipment that were violated by just one cheap drone fired by resistance fighters. The US admitting failure to these guys? Hell no! That’s a MASSIVE disrespect for them. So that’s why they point fingers at Iran, to save face. 

But this was all Iraqi resistance.

“The drone attack on a U.S. Military Installation in Jordan, killing 3 American service members, and wounding many more, marks a horrible day for America. My most profound sympathies go to the Families of the Brave Servicemembers we have lost. I ask all Americans to join me in praying for those who have been wounded. This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender.

Three years ago, Iran was weak, broke, and totally under control. Thanks to my Maximum Pressure policy, the Iranian Regime could barely scrape two dollars together to fund their terrorist proxies. Then Joe Biden came in and gave Iran billions of dollars, which the Regime has used to spread bloodshed and carnage throughout the Middle East.

This attack would NEVER have happened if I was President, not even a chance - Just like the Iranian-backed Hamas attack on Israel would never have happened, the War in Ukraine would never have happened, and we would right now have Peace throughout the World. Instead, we are on the brink of World War 3. This terrible day is yet more proof that we need an immediate return to PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, so that there will be no more chaos, no more destruction, and no more loss of precious American lives. Our Country cannot survive with Joe Biden as Commander in Chief.”

These brave Americans and their families are in my prayers, and the entire Department of Defense mourns their loss.

Iran-backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on U.S. forces, and we will respond at a time and place of our choosing.

The President and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests.”

It also has hypersonic missiles that can easily hit aircraft carriers. Iran is not Iraq or Syria. A direct war between the US and Iran would be a bigger war than the one between Russia and Ukraine.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Officials say that Washington is pressing for a ceasefire in Gaza long enough to stop Israel's military momentum. WSJ also says that The urgent need to reach an agreement while American and Israeli military officials are increasingly confident in Hamas' ability to survive, raising doubts about one of Israel's main war goals.

Reports from Lebanon say What is proposed is 3 stages for prisoners, the duration of the first stage being 45 days for civilians and the second stage for military personnel, but without specifying a time period. The third stage is for the exchange of bodies between the two sides, and it is also without specifying a time period.

Netanyahu is still opposed to the agreement, but in the end it looks like he will have to accept it. After this, Britain has already announced that the Palestinians will get a state and it will be recognized all over the world.
