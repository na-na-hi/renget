Such false information that is now being released by the US government is part of the psychological war, to show the public that the US is against it, but Israel is going to fight and attack Lebanon on its own.

The killing took place in Tower 22, near the US-backed Free Syrian Army's Al-Tanf Military Base in Southern Syria.

According to CNN, it happened as a result of a suicide drone strike by Iranian-backed militias.

>The US holds Iran responsible for the attack that killed at least 3 and injured more than 34, Biden vowed to respond. 

First of all, it wasn’t Iran. But this is part of US’ doctrine. They hold Iran responsible for any attack against them that causes a great blow, simply because they need an equal player. 

The upkeep alone, of 1 American soldier overseas costs the taxpayer $136,000 per year. Now, imagine the invested money into training that soldier and the expensive equipment that were violated by just one cheap drone fired by resistance fighters. The US admitting failure to these guys? Hell no! That’s a MASSIVE disrespect for them. So that’s why they point fingers at Iran, to save face. 

But this was all Iraqi resistance.

>Full statment:

“The drone attack on a U.S. Military Installation in Jordan, killing 3 American service members, and wounding many more, marks a horrible day for America. My most profound sympathies go to the Families of the Brave Servicemembers we have lost. I ask all Americans to join me in praying for those who have been wounded. This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender.

Three years ago, Iran was weak, broke, and totally under control. Thanks to my Maximum Pressure policy, the Iranian Regime could barely scrape two dollars together to fund their terrorist proxies. Then Joe Biden came in and gave Iran billions of dollars, which the Regime has used to spread bloodshed and carnage throughout the Middle East.

This attack would NEVER have happened if I was President, not even a chance - Just like the Iranian-backed Hamas attack on Israel would never have happened, the War in Ukraine would never have happened, and we would right now have Peace throughout the World. Instead, we are on the brink of World War 3. This terrible day is yet more proof that we need an immediate return to PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, so that there will be no more chaos, no more destruction, and no more loss of precious American lives. Our Country cannot survive with Joe Biden as Commander in Chief.”

“I am outraged and deeply saddened by the deaths of three of our U.S. service members and the wounding of other American troops in an attack last night against U.S. and Coalition forces, who were deployed to a site in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border to work for the lasting defeat of ISIS. These brave Americans and their families are in my prayers, and the entire Department of Defense mourns their loss.

Iran-backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on U.S. forces, and we will respond at a time and place of our choosing.

The President and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests.”
