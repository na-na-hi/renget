#R.I.D. Report No.[REDACTED] A.K.A. "Stellar Steak" Incident

**Involved persons of interest.**

Director of starship /nasa/
General of starship /nasa/'s military police
Blessed warrior of /meat/
Naval Captain and explorer from /infinity/ being accompanied by:
Alchemist of the Kaiserreich FP
Mercenary from VSPO
the Blessed warrior is presumably traveling together with them

**Summary.**
On the date of [REDACTED] the space station of /nasa/ was going through civil unrest due to dissent surrounding the "grand directive", the director apparently shut down most of the ship's functions in order to convince the population to accept the changes in the grand directive he proposed, this prompted a coup by the General. The director is currently escaping away from the starship into a secured location, with aid of the rangers this secure location has been found to be no less than [REDACTED]km away from the starship. The intention of the coup is to restore power to the ship and presumably establish a military government.
Current actions are limited to observation and non-intervention.

While traveling to the secure location, the director was seen with a small, brown, girl possesing a highly trained body, she seems to be uniformed in what's thought to be provisional clothes from the starship. The girl is known to be a blessed warrior from the lands of /meat/.
The Captain and explorer from /infinity/ has been identified as being from the 1st Kroniisiah Flotilla and has been under vigilance due to such position and existing tensions with the state of /infinity/, the girl was first seen travelling alongside the Captain, an Alchemist from the Kaiserreich, and a mercenary from VSPO, at some point they had separated and the girl ended somewhere along the tundra.

**Conclusion.**
Due to current developments, suggesting change in diplomatic strategy to the starship, if the director manages to take control of the ship again: Aggresive friendliness should be fostered and attempt to gain exclusive access to /nasa/ technology before they make any more deals with other nations can be made by them.

If the military coup succeeds then it is to be assumed that cooperation with /nasa/ will be highly reduced with the exception of the bakery business, in such case, attempts to mantain diplomatic relations should still be done with a special focus on vigilance and isolating them from any other state.

Dealing with potential tech smugglers of the starship: Forcefully take in and/or arrest every single posible smuggler, depending on the result of the civil crisis at the starship we will use them as bargaining ships to improve our standing with /nasa/, however, if the military government is established then we will insert them into our research teams and study the tech instead.

Extra notes:
- The headquarters of the ship can somehow control the flow of energy, investigate further.
