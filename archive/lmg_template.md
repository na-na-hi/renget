!!! Danger The template Renty is now split into two Rentry's to keep things consistent: This Rentry will be home to the template, https://rentry.org/lmg-resources will contain the charts. Apologies for the inconvenience | Updates here will be slower this week (Sunday through Friday)... I will be spending time with friends and family as well as going out for my birthday. After next week, I should be regularly updating this Rentry again.
!!! note Wiki in the template is dead at this point. A new one is needed.
