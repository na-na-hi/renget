!!!info *Today is a good day for fog. A set of boots strut along the cobbled road as a blond ponytail sways in the air. The strutting woman has never seen such a poetic representation of her role in this town. She, a player in Dunwich's otherworldy power game, one of the terrifying monsters lurking in the darkness. But she wasn't always this way. A maw in her mind vomits a jumbled ball of memories. Forcing herself back into it, she recalls her not-so-sightly past, when she was just a plaything and a lapdog for her family. Where the closest freedom she had was the size of her gilded cage and the material of her muzzle...*

###*March 2019, four years from now.... and three before the freedom wrought from Whateley's fall...*

>Story
Mimi's parents were surprisingly reluctant to claim their family fortune. Her father, hailing from the high-standing Lehto family, decided to marry an ex-CIA detective. Familial pressure and PTSD, just what kind of nightmares awaited them? None, in fact, they complemented each other. Their shared trauma allowed them to heal from their experiences, eventually promising to raise their child away from the sources of their torment.

A young Mimi spent 16 years happily fulfilling that dream. Until her parent's demons came knocking. Her father dead and her mother separated, she was forced into the hands of her paternal grandfather, acting as a replacement for his lost legacy. Torturous training sessions, exposure to the worst of both Dunwich and the world, her new caretaker spared no aspect of the Lehto's complex and violent history. 

Three years of the Lehto's worst have cracked Mimi. As the princess of the family, she has been trained to hide the numbness, fear, and self-hatred coursing through her. Every smile she flashes, merely to hide the scars underneath. But her new roommate seems to be breaking through that mold: an energetic Chinese girl with dreams of being a film technician. She's the first person she actually smiled at.

Maybe she'll be her chance to escape...

> Name: 
Mimi Lehto
> Age: 
19 (during this build, she's 23 by the time of the main story)

> Shadow Threshold: (Abnormal/ Unhinged)
39 (69 while using Hell's Whisper) 

> Residence: 
Central City (-3 T, -5 S, +10 LS)

> Lehto Estate is thought to be a shadow of its former self. The empty grounds and cracking architecture only fuel the accusations, that its owners are falling on hard times and couldn't be damned to renovate. Still, the Lehto family keeps it around for one reason: the accusations are wrong.

> Deep within the seemingly crumbling 4-story mansion lies rooms full of both opulent luxury and nightmarish design. Hideous masks share the same table with museum-worthy jewels while its Renaissance-style doors have electronic locks and protection sigils embedded within them. The mansion also bears 8 levels of underground chambers, full of the Lehto's prized assets: here, classified government documents are nested with all sorts of torture devices, firearms and weapons from the last 4 centuries and cursed artifacts blacklisted for the bizarre deaths surrounding them.

> And that's just the mansion, God help anyone lost in the Central Park-sized forest at the back. The contents of that area are unknown although rumors have spread of military bases and ritual sites coexisting.

> Cause of Death:
Traumatic Demise (+25 S, +46 T, +55 LS)
>It was a moonlit Thursday night when an assassin broke through Mimi's window. The source of his ire: her mother. The first person to arrive: her father. The struggle was bloody and intense, finally ending with the assassin stabbing his head with a glass shard. When her loving mother stepped into the scene, she personally slaughtered her to-be killer on the spot. The sight of her mother weeping on her husband's corpse, blood staining the bedroom, will forever be etched in her mind.

Additional Trauma (+14 S, +10 T)
>The death of Mimi's father was just the tip of the iceberg. The Lehtos had barely allowed their son, their hope of usurping the Dunwiches, to marry outside the family's plans. But this was the final straw. As punishment, Mimi's mother was exiled from Dunwich, never to step foot within the city again. As for the girl herself, she'd be groomed to take their son's place: a fair trade for the loss they suffered. The tears of mother and child were enough to stain the carpet to no avail. Soon, hell awaited the young Lehto.

> Ship of Theseus
Gloom: (Chosen Tree)
Aversion of Self (Free)
Inner Self (-1 T)
Sympathy: Overclocked (-2 T)
> (Sympathy Overclocked) A Growing Pang
Something hungry has decided to walk alongside Mimi. So far, its power takes the form of mouths appearing around her body, capable of opening to evade attacks as well as biting down on foes. The mouths can temporarily detach to consume anything Mimi directs them to, perfect for disposing of corpses.  

Those who Fight Monsters (Free)
> The mouths have grown even more powerful, to the point that they envelop the entirety of her body. Mimi can now summon maws from any hole around her, capable of devouring the surface they're on as well as anything thrown into them. 

Delusion:
This Illusion: Overclocked (-2 T)

Paranoia:
Propaganda (-1 T)

Fright of the Known: Overclocked (-4 T)
> (Fright of the Known Overclocked) Uneering Mind
Mimi's mind has been sharpened to tip-top perfection, to the point that she can trace the history of anything she wants to find. She'll always meet people that further her current goal and trace their actions.

Looming Dread (-3 T, +10 S, +1 Paranoia Trauma Type)
Inferno (-9 T, +15 S, -1 Paranoia Trauma Type)

> Life Skills
Part-Time Job x3 (-15 S, -15 LS)
Firearm Training - Shotguns (-10 S, -5 LS)
Stealth (-10 LS)
> Publically, she has no job. But when the Lehto's need muscle, they'll send her in. She's painted enough walls red to know how to kill a man with a single shell or blast an entire magazine while leaving one alive. It's never pretty but the pay's good. The only condition is to never tell anyone about this.

Dark Communion (+10 S, -6 T, -10 LS)
> Spells of eldritch nature are just a part of the Lehto's bread and butter. Even her father was not spared from their corrupting nature, and now Mimi is swimming in it.

Awareness
Not Everything is Elementary, my Dear
Sins of the Father
Beholder 
Total: (+15 S, +3 T, -30 LS)
> A true born Lehto is expected to see everything and take everything, emotions be damned. Perhaps this lesson worked too well because the things Mimi has seen would land her in the Asylum.  

Spider's Web x2
Social Butterfly
Total: (25 LS)
> Connections to the Lehto's network of informers and cultists means that Mimi can easily collect information about anyone in the area. Not like she wanted to earn it, her grandpa personally introduced those bastards to her.

> Possessions
Melee Weapon: (-2.5 LS)
> A very sharp army knife. Frankly, she uses it to cut body parts for Hell's Whisper.
Medium Firearm: Benelli Supernova (-5 LS)
> Straight from the Lehto family's armory, continuous service requires a firearm that works just as long.
Lehto Grand Key (-7.5 LS)
> This bizarre key, hidden inside a bracelet, can bypass any electronic lock in Central City with ease. Fingerprint and voice identification, computer passwords, none are safe against this nifty device. 

> Old Man Death's Shop
Stigmatized Old Firearm: Hell's Whisper (-12 T, -5 LS +30 S when wielded)
> A shortened Browning Auto-5 that only accepts the flesh of dead bodies as ammunition. Each pellet it fires hones straight for the weak point of the desired target, even supernatural creatures aren't immune. The gun includes a tiny blade at the top, cutting a finger on it and smearing the blood on the barrel will induce a second effect. Pulling the trigger will result in every pellet from the gun exploding with the strength of a frag grenade, those who hear the sound of the explosions are forced to experience the rage of the dead. As such, they will become berserk, attacking every living thing in the area. The user is not immune to this auditory effect, meaning they must cover their ears while firing.

> Life Events
Psychological Help (-20 S, -10 T, +15 LS)
> Mimi has her own personal therapist to deal with the stress of her Cause of Death and separation. So far, if somewhat subservient to Grandpa Lehto, she has been pretty swell to talk with. Although something tells her that she may be snooping on her personal details.

Survive the Night (+10 S, +6 T)
> "Next time, shoot the fucker dead." said her disappointed grandpa after a wounded target ran into the subway system, stranding the both of them in a swarm of mutated rats. The bite wounds only subsided after 2 weeks and were glowing yellow.

Old Money - Deep Drive (-10 S, +15 LS)
> After the Crosses but before the Dunwichs, there was the Lehtos. Once the rulers of the town, they were eventually usurped by the Dunwichs, resulting in a cold war that lasts to this very day. While not in control of Dunwich's government, they've invested in Central City's infrastructure. Every length of sewer, every new skyscraper in the area, and a few hotels in and out, they bid their time within the concrete expanse, in search of something that'll bring them back to glory. 

> While their material wealth may pale to the Dunwichs, they make up for it with their supernatural footprint. All sorts of curses and spells date back to them, horrific monstrosities prowl areas where their power has been consolidated, and cults seem to sprout within the businesses they own. The Dunwichs may be hiding the apocalypse but the Lehtos are the ones causing it.

###*Awww that was quite the shitty overview. Let's see what snazzy new me's got for the future!*

Timeline:
2000 - Mimi is born
2016 - Mimi's father is killed. Her mother is exiled from Dunwich and she is forced to stay in the Lehto Estate
2017 - Mimi is trained to be an enforcer of the Lehto family against her own will. She will work as one until the events at Whateley.
2019-22 - Time of this build, Mimi has just enrolled into Whateley University with Lyra. 
2022 - The Whateley Incident/ Tragedy
2023 - Time of Memento Mori

***Alas, we both know what happened to Whateley. But, things couldn't stay the way they were. Sure, Lyra wouldn't be chasing me with that toothy sword of hers but at least SHE'S the only "problem" I have to deal with. She's fun to play, 
unlike that old shithead... and his stupid little mansion... I'll make sure it all. Crumbles. Down.***

> Story (continuation)

So what could have turned an emotionally dead gunwoman opening up into the playful university-destroying apostle she is now? Well, its roots lie in what Mimi was doing behind her grandfather's back.

While performing her enforcer duties, Mimi had been scouring for leads relating to her missing mother. Between the six years of their separation and the Whateley Incident, she worked feverishly to search for the only family she loved. Extra fervor in her jobs led to less scrutiny led to more time for investigation.

She shouldn't have done that. The state she found her mother in would have rendered a normal human suicidal. Whatever it was, a deep craving enveloped every feeling she had. The desire to feel in control, to reclaim the life that had been stolen from her. Grief and hatred so overbearing that they looped back to joy. At that very moment, she gave up on appeasing the world around her. From now on, she'd take what she wanted, no matter what the masses said. And the Maw in the Darkness was clearly waiting for that answer..

She holds little loss for the events in Whateley; the elders of the Lehto family died with the university and no one will ever believe the little boy. On the contrary, the mouth god has granted her knowledge of everything their collective kill count knew. She effectively holds the location of Whateley and the Lehto family's assets as well as the means to acquire them at any time.

All that's left is Lyra, the only real connection she had. Deep down, her antagonism is just a way to carve the same path she once led. To make sure that her former roommate can grow into a flower that takes whatever she wishes, whenever she wishes. And she's having so much fun in that. Soon, they'll be reunited, ready for the world to owe them everything.

> A guide to NPC Mimi:
By the time of Lyra's build, Mimi is too powerful to act as a character. Absorbing the knowledge of both her (forcefully) adopted family and Whateley's entire faculty means that she knows basically everything there is about handling crime syndicates, politics and the supernatural, as well as the location of the necessary funds and equipment.

So I decided to make her a looming NPC. Think of her as a genderbent hybrid of the Mayor and Evalina's father, a power player in both the town's surface politics and underworld struggles. In fact, I'd put her as a figure capable of dethroning the Mayor, not doing so because of her focus on tormenting/molding Lyra. If he tries to put her down, she'd just evade and make sure it ends in a draw. It's not fun otherwise

If you want to put her in a writefag, assume that she knows everything about your character but doesn't care. If Lyra is a part of your story though, she'd immediately shift her focus on her.

However, that doesn't make her completely immune. The fact she doesn't care about characters other than Lyra unless necessary is also her greatest weakness. Slippery enough builds can destroy her assets and control as long as she's focused on the vengeance-seeking swordswoman. 

Some other weaknesses include the memory of discovering her mother and some disputes with the Mouth God. In the former's case, whoever finds the physical copy of that memory can break her by forcing her to remember it. Meanwhile, the latter functions on a timely basis as Mimi only provides enough offerings to keep the entity compliant. If one could convince the Mouth God that they could provide better offerings to it, Mimi's powers and knowledge will be stripped entirely and she will be ripe for the killing.

If you go for the second option, be careful. Usurping the role of the Mouth God's apostle will attract the ire of Lyra, who will be hostile to both a powerless Mimi and your build. Make sure you know what you're doing before writing it in.

Also, the weaknesses of Those who Fight Monsters and Sympathy still apply to her. 

Other than that, Mimi is yours to act as an antagonist for your writing.
