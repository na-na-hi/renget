#Ultra Magnus Relationship chart ft. Kara

Contrary to the expectations of many, the huge man is out of his equally huge God-Armor. For the first time in months, he is in a “restaurant” to eat properly cooked meals, rather than the simple meals and rations he has eaten in the last few months.

“Here is your meal, big guy.” The cook, Kara, comes with a plate of “Pasta with minced meat” and garlic bread in her hands. Although minced meat wasn’t so rare of a sight, it was mostly used to make sausages rather than eaten with any dish he knew of.
A smile blooms in the man's face, of all the discoveries of the south, this Tavern, or restaurant as it is called, is one of the best. One of the few places his heart could feel at peace without danger lurking— so much that taking out his armor to eat is safe, even if it is standing just a few feet across him.

Leaving the plate on his table, the barbarian takes silverware with surprisingly grace for someone with his origins. A gesture of respect towards Kara's craft, to eat the meal before him with care and enjoy every bit of it, to eat as one would call: “ A proper gentleman.”

Unexpectedly, Kara asks a question out of nowhere: “You do walk a lot in the wastes, right? Mind if I ask some questions about some people? A second opinion would be good about some of them.” An unusual question, one he won’t mind answering. “Alright, but it will take some time— I need time to appreciate the food” The southerner dialect was… hard, not impossible, but hard to talk in comparison to the northerner one. Well, maybe he should’ve thought twice about that, but now is too late anyway.

##Sasha
!!! warning “The man eating snake. I heard rumors about her, but never had the displeasure of finding it across my pilgrimage. She is dangerous, however I think I could take her down with the God Armor.”
!!! info ”You think so? I thought your armor makes you a walking tank. Surely fighting a man-eating snake is not enough to push it to the limits?”
Grimacing, the warrior formulates his words with care.
!!! warning “Common sense would dictate so but I never had the chance to meet the snake, so it has chances of being a Fragora. By her descriptions, I do not think she is a Krimaira, so a monster or a Fragora.”
!!! info “Fragora? Krimaira?”
This time, the cook grimaced at the words she never heard before.
!!! warning “Hm. Fragoras are creatures of legend, heavy and capable of soaring the skies, even in thunderstorms. According to the old legends , some of them were capable of spitting Radtion’s wrath upon the battlefield. Krimairas are what your people in the south call “muties”. However, Krimairas is a broader term in the north, beastkin are Krimairas, as are intelligent animals.”
!!! info “I think I got the gist of it… so why do you think she is a monster instead of a Krimaira? What is the difference?”
Taking a spoonful of his food, the giant first eats, before swallowing and answering the cook.
!!! warning “Krimairas are still somewhat human, or human-like. People with the characteristics of a beast, Beastfolks like the Ursathrantus of the North, or the Fenriswolves. They are like animals yet still humans. Monsters are demons, inhumans creatures, born of the pits of Radtion’s wrath, or close to them. Krimairas are like humans, capable of trade, honor, and thinking. Monsters are demons.”
!!! info “So you think Sasha is a demon?”
The giant nods.
!!! warning “For now I still have to find her to get the final say on what she is. However, she is low on my priority list, there are more pressing concerns than a flesh eating monster. Although if people need my help, I will go and face her.”

##Ramses:
!!! warning “Back in Winterstorm, we had legends of Demon Lords. Men and women capable of unleashing the powers of the Gods upon the land. Spells capable of destroying cities and leaving the land poisoned forever, swarms of Fragoras who blocked out the sunlight. He is weaker, a lot weaker than the Demon Lords of the past.”
!!! warning “A human amassing hordes of Krimairas and Demons under his command, wanting to destroy humankind. If he is not a Demon Lord, those who can only destroy and never create in their ravenous hunger for calamity, I don’t know what he is.”
!!! info “Human… but he is a mutant?”
!!! warning “For the little I know about the man’s appearance, he is neither a Krimaira, nor a monster. He is a human.”
!!! info “So back in the north, people who lack any extreme mutation are just humans, huh?”
!!! warning “I think this… is right. Either way, he is dangerous. No one who calls for an army of monsters has good intentions in his heart, no matter what he preaches. Him wanting to destroy his own species is… not a good sign too.”
!!! info “So, you dislike him?”
!!! warning “Vehemently so.”

##Nikto:
!!! info “A good boy, even if he’s not so right in the head. Seriously, he says that a good company pays enough for his services!”
!!! warning “Can’t say I know the man. From what I heard, he had a rough life. Even as an adult there are things I… forget that. He suffered too much for his age. Not that this era and land care about a youngster suffering. From what you said, I think he has his heart in the right place, at least.”
!!! info “... I think you guys would work like butter and bread together.”

##HOP3:
The warrior suppressed a loud snort. His face almost showed vicious mockery and spite.
!!! warning “few are the God’s metal emissaries that survived Radtion’s wrath. Fewer are the ones with a good heart in their steel chest. I dislike this one, she is no good. Many are the parasites waiting to attach themselves to a poor person and sap all of their strength. She is just another crawler waiting to prey on the desperate.”

##Dr. Charles Crane:
!!! warning “I have met the man. A man with a heart, so rare in these lands. Sadly we couldn’t travel together, my height and armor making it impossible with his light steel steed. However, I pray for the gods to allow our paths to meet again. A healer who helps and recover people for nothing but food and shelter and supplies. He is not a great warrior, but he is a Hero worthy of praise and admiration.”
The warrior speaks fondly of the man, a glimmer showing in his eyes.
!!! info “You are right, he is a good person.”

##Sage:
!!! warning “Of all people, I do not want to see her. Her form, her armor, speaks of great danger and ill omens.”
!!! info “Alright, big guy. How is this girl dangerous and an ill omen?”
Kara says in an annoyed tone, almost frowning at the warrior’s word. He was doing well until now. He went back to step on me.
!!! warning “Back in the Hall of Heroes, there were things, creatures in strange arcane constructs, holding them inside of see through barrels. They weren’t Krimairas nor humans but something else. The scrolls told my clan about them, true demons, being held by Gods’ might. Not even all arcane constructs could compare to the fear those things brought.”
For a split of a second, the warrior let go of the silverware, making it hit the table.
!!! warning “They were something else. I think this armor was never meant for us mortals to use, but for THEM. Those shadow demons, being held in the Hall of Heroes. The same wrongness, the same evil aura, she has them. Not on their level, but she has them.”
!!! info “How did you come across these demons in the first place? Shouldn’t your clan say to avoid them in your scrolls?”
!!! warning “I had to go to the depths of the Hall of Heroes to get the God Armor and the spells necessary to defeat the invaders. Many sections had collapsed, filled to the brim with ancient traps, made before my clan and by my clan across the years, or simply unaccessible. I had to go deep in the Hall of Heroes, where I met them.”
!!! info “Hum. Sorry about that. I got jumpy.”
!!! warning “Worry not, it happens to the best of us.”

##Nymphs:
!!! warning “I avoid the jungles. They are too troublesome to cross on a good day. At worst I meet the witches and their Fragora.”

##Samson:
!!! warning “A true Fragora if the rumors are to be believed. A beast who flies, strong and almost unbeatable. One of our songs sings about Smith the Foul Beard, a man who abandoned the clan to try and slay a Fragora, going far into the South, beyond all charted maps. For decades he searched for a Fragora, be it of metal or flesh, to slay. He never found one. In his old age, he returned to the clan, a dissatisfied and bitter old man, slayed many beasts and men, yet never a Fragora. It used to be a song of caution about wanting more than you can chew, and seeking foolish endeavors. Who would’ve thought generations ago that Smith Foul Beard was right? A fragora really exists!”
For a moment, the voice of the warrior almost becomes giggitty, a happy smile crossing his face.
!!! warning “If I can help it, I would prefer to not face the Fragora on my own. If he is as strong as the legends say Fragoras are, not even my God Armor will help much against him. So beware of him when crossing the jungle, I think he is more dangerous than the witches he protects.”

##Mike:
!!! “His behemoth is like the ones left to rot inside of the Hall of Heroes, and the ones from the legends of my people. Never thought I would see one in my life. His behemoth is one of the few steeds capable of housing I and my armor. Although his prices are sore. Sadly I can only afford, on a good day, one ride to get to an area who really needs my help. The man seems trustworthy enough as a rider.”

##Yuki:
!!! warning “I have run into this Yuki person a few times. If I’m being honest, it was just sightings rather than any meaningful interactions. Wanderers rarely meet one of their own, much less the type of wanderers we both are.”

##Heli:
!!! warning “I have fought besides the woman— She does good to her words and actions. It was a one moment thing, it is good to fight besides a woman with an honest heart again. However I would want it to be a less heated interaction than our first encounter.”
A sassy grim appeared on Kara’s face upon hearing “less heated”.
!!! info “Any details you may want to mention about this “heated encounter, wandering knight?”
!!! warning “If you insist. We both attacked a Raider encampment. She was paid by the locals to get rid of them, I came from the other end of their camp to hunt them down after raiding a defenseless caravan. She met me when I was cutting through their ranks, thinking I was some sort of God’s emissary on rampage. She tried to burn me with her flame spell. Wasn’t an enjoyable first meeting. We solved our issues later when we realized we weren’t enemies.”

##Georgia:
!!! warning “Had met her once. Being a pregnant woman in this wastes is a hard endeavor. Escorted her to the nearest settlement before parting ways. I hope she is okay. No pregnant woman should go through the hardships this land offers.”

##Argo:
!!! warning “A true Fragora if I ever saw one. I don’t have too much interest in them, they are men of the skies, I am a man of the land. However, one of their men has a God Armor. I want to at least inquire where he got one.”
!!! info “Well… you are right. I don’t think I have seen anyone else with this type of bulky armor besides you two.”
!!! warning “I’m dying to know where he got one.”

##Marcus:
!!! warning “I will disagree with you. His armor… his weapons are all in line with things my clan had seen in the Hall of Heroes. He could be someone from the age of Gods.”
!!! info “Then I will disagree with your words. There is no way it is possible.”
!!! warning “A demi god of the age of Gods wouldn’t be out of place in this Era. I hope I can meet him on an amicable occasion, there are many things I want to ask about the age of Gods.”

##Calliope
!!! info “Wait, you heard of her? Wow. I thought you would only know about the most widespread rumors and people of the wastes. Well, besides other wanderers.”
!!! warning “She is a great bard. I have met people who heard her singing and her songs. Never managed to reach any of her “shows”, but one day I hope to. Bards and singers were always a sight in Winterstorm, their performances of our legends and poems. Besides, she uses a “chain weapon” as you southerners call it.”
!!! info “This is surprising. Well, if you come by in the future, I will see if I can mark a show for you to see.”
!!! warning “I will be glad if you did so.”

##Isha:
!!! warning “What is a ray-di-oo? it has relation to Radtion?”
!!! info “... I forgot you also do not know what a radio is. Anyway, what do you think of her?”
!!! warning “Hmmm. From what I can tell, our tribes had a fair share of overlap in their structure. The promiscuity wasn’t there, although husbands and wives had a lot of sex to guarantee the survival of the Winterstorm clan. So we were more “monogamous” than the polygamous of their tribe.”
!!! info “This. I didn’t. Forget that. What do you think of the girl? As another barbarian, I think you guys can work well?”
!!! warning “She is a devoted priestess of her religion, people with strong spirits and will are capable of making miracles and surviving the worst this world can throw at them. She is strong, this is a desirable trait in any mate, the man who marries her will be a lucky guy. She has a bright future, and I hope her tribe gets the help they need. I know the pain of losing a home.”

##Karnak:
!!! warning “This is a demon. It somehow is worse than the creatures inside the Hall of Heroes. How can a creature like that be allowed to prowl the lands?”
!!! info “Sometimes I wish to have such a simple and clear view of the world as you.”
!!! warning “What do you mean?”
!!! info “Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.”

##Aaron:
!!! warning “I never heard about him, but knowing a hero also threads the wastes right now is… heartwarming. I want to meet him, much like Marcus, in a threat free and light hearted occasion. The Gods know that we need people like him in this world.”

##Magnus Wang:
!!! info “Are you guys related somehow? Both being from the north, big, are named Magnus.”
!!! warning “A common misconception, I’m afraid. Magnus is a normal name back in the north, due to an ancestor of the Winterstorm Clan, Ultra Magnus. I took my name after him.”
!!! info “And why are you guys so big? There is something strange in the food you eat?”
!!! warning “‘I am an outlier, while the people from the north are indeed bulkier, we are not taller than your average man and woman. About our strength… plants narrowly grow in the North, so we get our food from hunting down beasts and trading. We need stronger bodies to hunt down our food and to thread across the pale plain. If we aren’t strong, we perish.”

“Well, thanks for the food, Kara.” The warrior stands up, taking a pouch of “coins”, and putting it on the table. “Journey awaits me. Hope we can meet next time. I pray for good tidings for yourself and your tavern.”
