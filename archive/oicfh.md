*** LE is the recommended version of Skyrim to use for hardcore lewd modding ***

--- Thanks to the anon who wrote this ---

So you want bouncy tits in Skyrim, but you're a stupid fuck and/or an all-around pissant, so /tesg/ sent you here. Fine. You will read and you will learn. And now this is updated for SexLab, too.
 
First things first, get/use Mod Organizer. These instructions will be built around the assumption you are using MO.
 
Second, accept that UUNP is a superior body format over CBBE due to its increased polygons and better body meshes. Deal with it. Anything worth having already has a UUNP conversion, or will, so learn to google better, you shitheel.
 
Third, follow this guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/beginners_guide
Once you've followed that guide, you'll have a pretty good fucking head start on the ins and outs of modding Skyrim. If you haven't, fuck you, and whatever follows in this guide will still probably confuse you and give you shit. Tough titties.
 
Fourth, install order matters, I've structured the guide around requirements and overlaps and shit. Don't fuck it up and look like a retard. If something's wrong, PEBKAC.
 
PART 1: LAYING THE GROUNDWORK (HAVOK PHYSICS AND YOU)
 
    I'm sure you went through the /r/skyrimmods guide, because you need SKSE. Go read it (again) and install it if you don't have it.
 
    http://www.mediafire.com/file/4zc68botnz2z6ix/HdtInvisibilityFix_0_11_beta-77815-0-11beta.7z <-- Because it kind of sort of works? Don't worry about it, just install it.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/601/? <-- Grab this, install it with Mod Organizer
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/11811/? <-- Grab the XXL version (trust me), install it with Mod Organizer
 
        Spells pack you can decide on later, it's not the point of this guide. Creature pack if you want bestiality and/or monster sex. Register FNIS.exe with MO, then run it. Check "Skeleton arm fix" near the bottom, then run it. Wait, and don't panic. FNIS is supposed to take forever. Pro-tip: if you touch anything that has to do with .hkx files (animation files), run FNIS before you run Skyrim next.
 
    Either Racemenu[ http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/? ] or ECE [ http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/? and http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/37481/? if you pick ECE]
 
        I'm not here to spark a Racemenu vs ECE war, just pick the one you want for sculpting your bitches. For reference, pretty much all of those Asian modders use ECE, like half of /tesg/ uses Racemenu.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000/? <-- Grab this, install it with Mod Organizer
 
        Pick Skeleton Rig (HDT), I couldn't give less of a fuck what other things you pick on the other pages.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53996/? <-- Grab this, install it with Mod Organizer
 
        The .dll file enables jiggly shit.
 
PART 2: MAKING YOUR IDEAL FEMALE FORM (USING BODYSLIDE AND OUTFIT STUDIO)
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49015/? <-- Grab this, install it with Mod Organizer
 
        Unified UNP option, Racemenu morphs for Unified UNP, and you don't need pre-built morphs. We will be building them.
 
        Once you've installed BodySlide, you will register BodySlide.exe (NOT BodySlide x64.exe) through Mod Organizer. Just like FNIS.
 
        Before we continue with BodySlide, though, grab:
 
    http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2431-naturalistic-hdt-jiggle-and-collisions-xml-set/ <-- Jolly green download button, Naturalistic XMLs for HDT PE vXXX.7z
 
        Install it. Most of the instructions are self-explanatory, don't be a retard and read. Yes to breast rotation. Under Body Type, just pick UUNP Special, and yes you want the repaint. Yes to HDTfingers.xml attached. Schlong choices you'll have to decide for yourself when you install Schlongs of Skyrim.
 
    http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/498-sos-schlongs-of-skyrim/
 
        That one's all you, figure it out yourself. (Hint: install the full version) I'm just here to teach you how to bouncy tits.
 
        Now that's out of the way, run BodySlide (through MO). Under Outfit/Body (near the top), you will scroll down and select Unified UNP Special (if you want a visible vagina with folds that warp from penises) or Unified UNP HDT (if you understand that shit's a meme and overrated and don't want to have to deal with using Texblend to paint on vaginal folds onto your textures).
 
        Now, select the Preset (the specific set of slider values that determine what your body looks like) that tickles your fancy.
       
        Use the Preview button near the bottom to see what it looks like from a range of weight, 0-100. This is the body that any female NPC that is pathed to the default female body will use. Custom body-pathed NPCs (such as followers or some replacers) will require that you go digging through your Data folder, find the actual body they are pathed to, and replace those with the defaults you built. The files in question will be:
 
            femalebody_0.nif, femalebody_1.nif, femalefeet_0.nif, femalefeet_1.nif, femalehands_0.nif, femalehands_1.nif
 
        Pick the preset you want (bodies won't look the same in-game because gravity will droop breasts, so you'll want to try out different ones), or move the sliders around until you're happy.
       
        Check the box named Build Morphs, and click Build.
 
        Go back to Outfit/Body section up top, select Unified UNP Hands Special and Unified UNP Feet Special and build those too, to the same preset or slider values. These built files will now be in your MO data folder, which you can go to by right-clicking BodySlide in Mod Organizer's left pane and clicking Open in explorer. The folder path will look something like this:
 
        \BodySlide and Outfit Studio - vXXX\meshes\actors\character\character assets
 
        Start getting a feel for how these folders are laid out. Those pathways are going to be important if you like changing shit like bodies and textures around a lot.
 
    At this point, you're set. You have a bounce-compatible default female body, all the prerequisites for it, you've popped your BodySlide cherry, and the best jiggle xmls (subjective but true). If you have a female body texture without vagina folds blended onto it, you'll have a distinct lack of textures on your vag lips. Learn to Texblend, you got this far in the guide, you can google yourself a guide for that.
 
PART 3: SO YOU WANT PRETTIER BITCHES? (NPC BEAUTY MODS)
 
    Download whatever fucking NPC overhaul mods you want on Skyrim, it's your fucking choice. Install. Then, grab:
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70547/? Install.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40038/? Install.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71054/? Install.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/63473/? Install.
 
    http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38326/? Install. 1.7 is da best, but pick whatever floats your boat. Don't forget Valerica.
 
    Don't be a retard, make sure you're installing the UNP-compatible versions. Make sure your plugins for NPC replacers show up in the same order on the right as on the left. Otherwise you're gonna get shit potato face and that's your fucking cross to bear until you can unfuckup the order. Some of those mods have high-res texture packs for download, too. Grab them if your computer isn't AIDS (something like 4GB+ VRAM on your GPU is a good start).
 
    None of the replacers I made you install use the default female body meshes or textures; they're pathed to their own custom bodies, so now that you have some experience digging through mod folders right click the mods on MO, Open in explorer, and go copy and paste whatever body you want wherever you find them to be replaced. Congratulations, your bitches are hot. There's a guy named sidearmf93 from Korea who did a bunch of really Korean-mmo tier faces that I use as a base before The Ordinary Women and the Bijin mods, but fuck if I have the patience to teach you how to do that right now.
 
PART 4: SO YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN TIMES? (SEXLAB FOR DUMMIES)
 
    Before we begin, I'm going to say it again: follow /r/skyrimmods' beginner guide. All of Sexlab's requirements will already be taken care of, and you won't look like a dumbass when you post somewhere complaining you can't get SexLab to work.
 
    http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/150-skyrim-sexlab-sex-animation-framework-v162-updated-jun-3rd-2016/ Install. This lets you sex.
   
        If you want bestiality/monster sex, open up the MCM menu (press ESC mid-game, Mod Configuration), find SexLab > Animation Settings > Allow Creature Animations. All the other settings are up to you, experiment.
 
    Now the guide splits into must-have mods, and optional-but-recommended utility mods.
 
    MUST-HAVE MODS:
   
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/563-jcontainers/ Install.
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2488-sexlab-animation-loader/ Install. This lets you add SLAL packs (animation packs designed to be used with SexLab) to your game.
   
        As a FYI, each category of SexLab's animations (human animations and creature animations) has a 500 animation limit, and if you start adding SLAL packs willy-nilly you'll definitely hit the human cap. Experiment and see what you like/want.
 
    OPTIONAL UTILITY MODS: 
   
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/163-sexlab-matchmaker-updated-09172014/
       
            Use this for a pair of spells to target yourself/others for sex. Great for seeing if your shit is working properly.
   
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2018-sexlab-tools-v30/
       
            A bit more sophisticated than just blamming targets to make them initate sex, this lets you queue up animations and actors, as well as change animations mid-sex. Read the instructions.
 
    (SOME) SLAL PACKS:
       
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2615-slal-animations-by-leito-91216/
        http://www.loverslab.com/topic/55268-sexlab-animation-loader-guide/page-6#entry1422937 Under "New Falmer animations by Evacuation!!! and also four human anims (05 MAR 17)"
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3975-znaroks-animations-with-slal-pack/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2585-nibbles-animations/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3999-billyys-slal-animations-2017-6-11/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2376-anubs-animation-dump-updated-15012017/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2702-funnybizness-v25-slal-pack-by-shashankie/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3426-k4-animations-slal-package/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3020-slal-animations-by-sailing-rebel-srb-2016-06-29/
        http://www.loverslab.com/topic/62530-sukes-animations-slal-692016/
        http://www.loverslab.com/files/file/2897-slal-komotors-animations/
       
        Remember to run FNIS every time you add a SLAL pack, then in the MCM (Mod Configuration Menu) for SL Anim Loader, under General Options, Enable All and Register Animations. Or, if you want to be more selective about the animations you enable, go to the specific subcategory and only enable the ones you want to register, then register.
       
    http://www.loverslab.com/topic/19588-sexlab-index/
   
    That's the link to the SexLab Index, which should be relatively up-to-date. Good luck. Now that you're at this point, you can go through LoversLab's Skyrim section yourself, or ask on /aco/ for mod recommendations. As a head start, SexLab Defeat is the best at what it does, and Amorous Adventures is hilariously great.
 
 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
PART X: PATRICIAN MEME BODY (PUFFY NIPPLES AND BETTER VAGINAS)
       
    If you're down here and you're a patrician and you like better vaginas and bodies that have actual nipples on them, read on. Hell, I think even the sloping of the breast is better. You need to have your head straight and not be retarded, but the upside is you also don't need to blend vaginas onto your textures because the vaginal folds are pathed to a separate .dds file.
 
        https://mega.nz/#!Vc9lQJrY!gRYfZQUXY7ITEuNStP5FGkErdBy2ad3F2YzQTcM8k64
 
        After having done everything above in Parts 1-2, download this, install it. Make sure the name of the entry on MO isn't in moonrunes, you don't need moonrune folder fuckery fucking up your modding. When installing, don't worry about what options to pick, just get through it. Once it's installed, right click its entry in the left pane of MO, and select 'Open in explorer'. Delete every folder that isn't CalienteTools. Now, go to:
 
        http://www.loverslab.com/topic/54417-naturalistic-hdt-jiggle-and-collisions-xml-set/?p=1917744
 
        Grab Bazinga's attachment, UUNP Chinese - UUNP HDTVIGINA NIPPLE-MINI.7z
        Install that.
 
        Open up BodySlide, find UUNP HDTVIGINA NIPPLE-MINI under Outfit/Body. Open the preview. See if it's what you want. You want it. Build it.
 
    Approximately half the people who've gone through this guide and commented about it are fucking dyslexic/retarded, so DOUBLE-CHECK EVERYTHING. Something's off? You fucked up. Go through the guide again, dumbass. Don't post some stupid passive-aggressive shitpost somewhere complaining about how you fucked up, you look stupid as shit.
   
    Don't like the built-in pubes? It's simple: grab Nifskope (look online), open femalebody_0.nif and femalebody_1.nif with it. When you click the pubic hair, it'll light up, and you'll see the section responsible for it highlighted on the left. Right-click that text, Remove Branch. Save. Make sure you did it for both, you retard.
 
Enjoy.
