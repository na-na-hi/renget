*"This is unbearable,"*  said Mio.

For the past few days, she had been spending time at Sandatsu's place every time she finished with her class representative duties. She could avoid the heat inside the tent since the shade of the trees around it kept it moderately cool while lazing around, waiting for the sun to go down before going home.

But the heat was especially high that day, and she was starting to sweat even when all she was doing was lying on her back and looking at her phone.

*"Hey..."* said the girl, raising her head to look at her kouhai.

He didn't respond.

*"Hey idiot, I'm talking to you!"* said Mio, now giving Sandatsu a soft kick on the back.

After feeling Mio's foot, he finally turned around, letting her see what he had been busy with. All this time he had been sitting on the other side of the tent, with her back towards her, putting what few clothes he had inside a plastic bag.

*"What the fuck are you doing?"* said Mio.

*"Getting everything ready to do some laundry"*

*"Laundry? An ape like you doing laundry?"* Mio said, poking fun at the idea of such a brute doing house chores.

*"Yeah. Chihiro told me about a stream near her house where I could go wash my clothes."*

*"Isn't that the sword girl in your class? I never expected you to get along with other people."*

*"Shut up. I even have friends. Didn't you see them in my memories?"*

*"Yeah. And they call you Sandy... Probably because you sleep on the ground, you dirty hobo."* Mio was insulting the boy while giving him a couple more kicks. But he was unbothered and continued talking.

*"Well, the thing is that Chihiro really knows her stuff when it comes to living off the land, so if she says a river is worth checking out, then I'm definitely going to do it."*

Sandatsu's enthusiasm when talking about his survival buddy was starting to annoy Mio.

*"And I think she lives in a dojo in the woods. How cool is that?"* he continued, *"I think I'll ask her if I can visit sometime."*

*"Hey,"* she said while standing up, interrupting him, *"get off your ass. We're going to a convenience store. I want to get some ice cream."*

*"Huh? Then go by yourself?"*

*"No way. I don't want to carry my bags in this heat."*

*"Then leave them here,"*  complained the young man.

*"Fuck no. I don't want to leave my stuff around you!"* answered Mio.

*"Fucking hell... Then give me the money, and I'll go get your ice cream myself. It'll be faster, and it'll get you to shut the fuck up."*

*"No way I'm letting you handle my money, you greasy hobo!"*

*"Ugh. Alright, you whiny bitch, you win."*

Sandatsu was squatting in the small parking lot outside the convenience store when Mio finally returned from inside, carrying a small plastic bag. The boy stood up when he saw her walking towards him.

She took out a water bottle from the bag, had a drink, and then put it back inside. The next thing she took out of the bag was the ice cream. It was one of those popsicles that come in pairs. She took a bite out of it without splitting it into two first.

*"You little shit..."* said Sandatsu.

She looked at him with a devilish grin while enjoying the refreshing flavor of the ice cream. *"Hmm?" What is it?"*

*"First you tell me to come here with you, then you tell me to wait outside like a dog, and now you don't even offer me any ice cream."*

*"Maybe bring your own money next time? Oh wait, you are poor, and I don't want to share my money with a piece of trash like you~"* It looked like Mio was having fun.

Sandatsu was annoyed, but that's how most of their interactions were, so deep down, he didn't expect anything different. They stood in the parking lot for a while. Given the difference in their heights, Mio could comfortably stand besides Sandatsu, with the boy's shadow protecting her from the sun.

*"Now that I think about it, you are always laying around doing nothing or eating snacks at my place, but all the weight seems to be going to..."*

*"Hey!"* Mio interrupted him. *"Shut your trap, you idiot."*

Sandatsu stayed silent for a second, but then spoke again with renewed resolve after remembering how especially annoying Mio had been that day.

*"All the weight seems to be going to your tits, your ass, and your thighs. There. I said it. The fuck are you going to do about it, you bitch."*

*"That's sexual harassment, you fucking creep!"* said Mio, stepping on Sandatsu's foot with her heel.

Sandatsu crouched, grabbing his foot in pain. Mio took the chance to step on his back.

*"Thanks for ruining the taste of my ice cream with your yapping, you mutt,"*  said Mio.

*"What's wrong with you today?"* asked the boy.

Mio stood silent for a bit before deciding to sit on Sandatsu's back. Sandatsu didn't complain, instead staying still. After interacting with her for some time, he knew that it'd be better to just let her have her way if she was having a bad day.

*"Hey, asshole,"*  Mio finally said. *"How's Ashleigh doing in class?"*

*"Huh? Can't you read memories? You can see that for yourself."*

*"I was asking for your personal opinion!"* Mio barked at him, *"And you should be thankful I'm even trying to have a chat with you."*

*"Fine... Well, if there's one thing to mention, it's that it's pretty clear that you are family,"*  said the boy.

*"Hm? How so?"* Sandatsu's words had piqued Mio's interest. Maybe the idiot had some insight worth sharing.

*"You have the same family name,"*  said Sandatsu, with a completely serious face.

Mio drove the wooden stick from the popsicle she ate into Sandatsu's ear. While the boy agonized on the ground, she stood there, lifting her skirt up and down a bit because of the heat.

*"Why was I even expecting a relevant answer from you?"* said Mio. *"When I know full well that you're retarded enough to make an entire special education class look like geniuses,"*

*"Come on, it was a good joke,"*  said Sandatsu, struggling to stand up after his ear regenerated.

*"It was embarassing. It ruined my appetite,"*  she said, while handing the plastic bag from the convenience store to Sandatsu.

He expected it to only contain the ice cream wrappers and the water bottle, but there was still one last popsicle inside.

*"Are you saying I can eat this?"* asked the kouhai.

*"Sure. It's only fitting for a dog to eat leftovers,"* said Mio, already starting to walk.

The sound of birds chirping woke her up first.

Mio got up. All the sweat had left her skin sticky, and it felt really uncomfortable.

She looked around for a bit, still half asleep.

Her eyes landed on him.

Her kouhai had not only grown taller but was more muscular as well.

She poked his chest with a finger. He had some pretty nasty scars.

Wait.

She looked down at her own body.

The realization that both of them were naked woke Mio completely. And with waking up came remembering what happened the previous night.

Oh.

Oh no.

Mio grabbed her things and exited the tent.

Her uniform was not only drenched in sweat but also wrinkled. Sandatsu had been quite rough with it. She thought about having him pay for the cleaning.

The blonde senior put on the tracksuit the boy used for practical classes. It was too baggy, so she had to roll up the sleeves and legs quite a bit. She was saving her own sportswear for later.

Mio looked at her phone while making her way to the showers. The birds had woken her up much earlier than she thought. There was still time before even the students started to arrive.

The water helped Mio clear her mind for a bit, as long as she did her best to keep what happened out of her mind.

*"I know I said it was the weight you gained, but now I think your entire growth is focused on your chest, ass, and thighs."*

Mio turned around. There was her kouhai, looking at her with a hand on his chin, as if pondering something. She threw a shampoo bottle at his face without hesitation.

*"What the fuck are you here for?"* These are the women's locker rooms!"  said Mio.

*"I need my gym clothes for class,"*  he said, with his hand on his forehead, now red after being hit by the bottle.

*"They are next to my bag. Now take them and go! And don't let anyone see you."  Sandatsu was already stripping right in front of her. "What the fuck do you think you're doing, you idiot?!"*

*"It's not everyday I get to have a morning shower, so I might as well enjoy this! There's probably enough time before the first students come."*

*"You are disgusting."*

He was enjoying the water so much that he wasn't paying attention to her insult. How the fuck did he dare act all calm after that? It made Mio's blood boil.

She looked at him. The scratches and bite marks she left on his back and neck were still there.

Mio delved into the boy's memories. He hadn't used Rewind at all last night. What the hell was that guy's endurance?

*"You retard, get rid of those!"*

*"But they're like badges of honor for me. I want to keep them for a while."*

*"Ugh, I hate your guts so much."*

*"You were saying the opposite when I was rearranging yours. Ouch."* Sandatsu's remark was answered by another bottle hitting his head. This time it was conditioner.

*"Shut up. You are like a fucking animal in heat,"*  said Mio.

*"Look who's talking."*

Mio stared daggers at him.

*"I'm just going to delete all of that from our brains once I'm done showering,"* she said.

*"It'd just come back to me when I use Rewind."*

*"If you ever mention it again, I'll ruin your already shitty life."*

Both of them stayed quiet for a bit. Sandatsu broke the silence.

*"Then wanna do it again before we get out of the shower?"*

*"Are you seriously asking that? You. Fucking. Piece. Of. Shit."*

*"Is that a no?"*

*"..."*

They barely made it in time for class.
