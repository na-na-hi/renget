#A Legend of a Jade Princess

*The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced All things.*

Some would say it’s the Fourth that truly produced them all, but few know the real stories behind the tales, and even fewer among them would wish to expend “The Three Pure Ones” to four, their hearts still bearing the weight of witnessing atrocities committed by the Empress’ creations.

Despite that, when the heart of the First burst and released the Devil, she stood together with the Three Pure Ones in the war to contain it. Many battles have been won, but the same can’t be said about the war. A Grand Project was undertaken in hopes of finally putting an end to it.

After the seeds would have been planted, but before the time for harvest has come, to oversee their growth, a student of the One has been chosen. He came to be known as the Jade Emperor. Whether it was fate that the Jade Emperor and the Empress became fond of each other, or the reason he achieved that title was because he was her husband, is not important.

The two had seven daughters, known as the Seven Fairies. During the height of the war against the Devil, in an attempt to wound the Empress, he took the life of the youngest of them, known as the Green Jacket. The grief-stricken mother had not been ready to part with her child so soon and set out to seek the aid of the Third, who was the master in all matters of the afterlife.

She pleaded with him to bring her child back, to give her just some more time. The Third was reluctant, for interfering with the Wheel of Life to bring someone back was both difficult, and could slow down their progress towards salvation. But the Empress in her grief insisted, argued and finally threatened, and because her support in the war was necessary, the Third finally relented.

He agreed to bring the spirit of her daughter back for one year, so that she could say her farewells and make peace with her passing. The Empress agreed, and rejoiced when she was reunited with her child. But the year was passing fast, especially for someone as ancient as her, and the Third refused to extend the time she’d have with her daughter.

The Empress in her vanity decided to break the deal. She wanted her daughter to stay with her longer. Using the magics known only to her, she bound the soul of Green Jacket to that of a jade tipped spear, preventing her from rejoining the Wheel. From this day, the girl has also been known as the Jade Princess.

Once the time has come and the Third came to collect the spirit of the Green Jacket, he realized what had happened and was appalled, but unable to reverse the bindings that joined the spirit and the spear, only the Empress herself had the powers to do that and she refused.

When his orders and pleads to release the spirit were ignored, the Third decided to take the Jade Princess away from her mother. He brought her to his palace and, as repayment for being cheated, tasked her with assisting him in his duties.

Millennia passed, and the Jade Princess served faithfully for her mother’s transgressions. The enmity between the Empress and the Third died down. The Grand Project progressed, and the seeds were ready to be planted. It seemed like things were turning out for the better.

But the Jade Princess was feeling lonely leading spirits to their next lives, but unable to achieve one herself. Bound to the spear and stuck between the worlds of the living and the dead, through no choice of her own, her sadness was broad and deep like a sea. Only one person heard her plight.

The Second, who was nearing completion of his part of the project, visited the Third asking for treasures required for it. That’s when he met the Jade Princess. He listened to her story and offered to help.

He was unable to undo the magics of the Empress, nor convince the Third to release her from servitude, but he thought of a way to give her something at least resembling a new life. The Jade Princess agreed without a second thought.

That night, the Second sealed the memories and powers of the Jade Princess and stole her out of the Third’s Palace. In hopes that, even bound to the spear, she might find the life she sought on one of the new worlds, he placed her among the other treasures that he was to plant on them.

When the Empress and the Third realized what had happened, it was already too late, and the worlds had been sealed. The Second refused to reveal which world he placed the Jade Princess on, and even the Empress, after so many years to come to terms with her daughter’s passing, dared not unseal all of them. She only prayed that one day her daughter might come back to her once again.
