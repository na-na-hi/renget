!!! note Update instructions. If SD breaks go backward in commits until it starts working again
	Instructions:
	* If on Windows:
		1. navigate to the webui directory through command prompt or git bash
			a. Git bash: right click > git bash here
			b. Command prompt: click the spot in the "url" between the folder and the down arrow and type "command prompt". 
			c. If you don't know how to do this, open command prompt, type "cd [path to stable-diffusion-webui]" (you can get this by right clicking the folder in the "url" or holding shift + right clicking the stable-diffusion-webui folder)
		2. ```git pull```
		3. ```pip install -r requirements_versions.txt```
	* If on Linux: 
		1. go to the webui directory
		2. ```source ./venv/bin/activate```
			a. if this doesn't work, run ```python -m venv venv``` beforehand
		3. ```git pull```
		4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
	
	If AUTOMATIC1111's Github goes down, you can try checking his alt repo: https://gitgud.io/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui

Note: If I don't update in a month, I probably decided to step away from documenting and keeping up with SD. If that's the case, my final update will be cleaning up some stuff and doing one big final update. To keep up with news, you can usually use
Reddit (recommended since everything is filtered if you sort by top): https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/
4chan (look at the top comments to see if anything big was added, good if you want to be on top of things): https://boards.4channel.org/g/catalog#s=sdg
SDCompendium (not too sure how good this site is, from a quick skim it seems pretty good and maintained. Has weekly(?) and monthly(?) news as well as a ton of other stuff): https://www.sdcompendium.com/.

Thank you all for your support for this repo and the general development of SD, I really appreciate everyone who's contributed and hope you'll take SD to new heights.

		- Improvements for various tools (like upscalers)
- (forgot to put this ever since it was created, but it's really good) InvokeAI, an all-in-one alternative to Automatic1111's webui, is updated with a lot of stuff: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI
	- InvokeAI needs only ~3.5GB of VRAM to generate a 512x768 image (and less for smaller images), and is compatible with Windows/Linux/Mac (M1 & M2).
	- Has features like: UI Outpainting, Embedding Management, a unified (infinite) canvas, and an image viewer
	- Very user friendly (simple UI) and super easy to install (1-clicK)
	- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/zabmht/invokeai_22_release_the_unified_canvas/
- Unstable Diffusion reaches $25000 kickstarter goal for further training of SD 2.0
	- https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unstablediffusion/unstable-diffusion-unrestricted-ai-art-powered-by-the-crowd
	- Goals:
		- Community GPU Cloud: researchers and community model makers can request compute grants and train their own models and datasets on our system, provided they will release the results open source
		- Further training using more steps and images
		- Only filtered out children to prevent misuse
- Stable Diffusion v2.1 released: https://stability.ai/blog/stablediffusion2-1-release7-dec-2022
	- https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1
	- Reduced the strength of filters to allow for generating better people
- LORA - Low-rank Adaptation for Fast Text-to-Image Diffusion Fine-tuning space (based on the github from below): https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Low-rank-Adaptation
	- Dreambooth at twice the speed
	- Super small model file sizes (3-4MB)
	- Supposedly better than full fine-tuning according to author of the linked space

- Automatic1111 adds support for SD depth model
	- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/zi6x66/automatic1111_added_support_for_new_depth_model/
	- Instructions on how to use by reddit user: 
		1. Download https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-depth (model) and place it in models/Stable-diffusion
		2. Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion/main/configs/stable-diffusion/v2-midas-inference.yaml (config) and place it in the same folder as the checkpoint
		3. Rename the config to 512-depth-ema.yaml
		4. Start Stable-Diffusion-Webui,z select the 512-depth-ema checkpoint and use img2img as you normally would.
- depthmap2mask extension released that can create 3d depth map masks --> supposedly better img2img
	- Seems to be an alternative to conditioning image mask weight
- Dreambooth training based on Shivam's repo extension updated to support SD v2.0 (find it in the extensions tab)
