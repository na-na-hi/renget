Q001: What is an amplifier?
* An amp takes the low level signal from a source (for example CD player) and amplifies it so much, that it's able to move the speakers diaphragmm, thus generating audible sounds. Some amps are stereo, sources connected to it have two channels and there are two power amplification stages to drive speakers. Some amps are for AV (audio video) equipment, there we find often 5, 7 or more channels coming from the source (which is TV, Bluray or DVD for example).

Q002: What is a receiver?
* It's an amplifier with a one or more builtin sources, such as FM radio, DAB, Sirius, internet radio and others.

Q003: What does 2.0, 2.1, 5.1, 7.2 and so on mean?
* It's the amount of channels used: 2.0 is 2 regular channels (front left, front right, aka stereo) and 0 subwoofers. 5.1 means 5 regular channels (front left, front right, center, back left, back right) and 1 subwoofer.

Q004: Can I just buy decent speakers and call it a day?
* Depends. You need a source, an amplifier and speakers at least. Say you have a computer, that would be your source. A possible amp would be a Yamaha A-S701 or Aiyima 07, speakers would be KEF LS50 or maybe speakers with builtin amplifier (called active speakers, in contrast to passive speakers like the ones mentioned).

Q005: At what price point do you get into meme territory when it comes to cables?
* Immediately. There has never been a blind test that proofs that cables sound different. Just buy regular, full copper (it's more flexible), speaker cable with less than 15 ohm/km resistance. That means 1.5mm² or 16 AWG full copper. If you have more than 10m from the amplifier to the speaker, pick 2.5mm² or 13 AWG full copper. For RCA or other low signal cables use what is on sale at Amazon. HDMI can get finecky if longer length and larger resolutions are in play, but usually regular 4k certified is ok.

Q006: Is a balanced signal path noticeably different from unbalanced?
* Not audible at home. If you're in professional audio stuff and depending on the environment you work in, yes it does help to keep EM noise from polluting your microphone/line level signals before amplification/recording. Using balanced for amplified audio signals is useless though, you have to cancel noise before amplifying it.

Q007: Do I need to be an audiophile to appreciate the difference between using a 3.5mm jack and a 2.5mm jack?
* There is no audible difference. It's just different sizes (originally 3.5 was used everywhere, then mobile devices called for a smaller connector of the same kind, thus 2.5mm was born).


Q008: If a pair of speakers lists "15-120W" in amplifier requirements, what exactly does that mean? Should I provision 120W for each speaker? Would a 50W x 2 amplifier be no good?
* The manufacturer thinks an amp should at least have 15 watts for sufficient loudness, but not more than 120 watts to not damage the speaker. Most amplifiers are somewhere between 50 and 100 watts per channel and would fit.

Q009: What is a DAC? Do I need one?
* A DAC converts a digital representation of a waveform into an analog waveform, that then becomes source for a mixer, preamplifier or amplifier. It turns the data inside flac or mp3 files or coming from a CD or TV into analog music. Inputs are usually USB (to connect a computer), toslink/optical (to connect a TV) or SPDIF coaxial (often found in CD players). Outputs are usually RCA/Cinch. External DACs sometimes are combined with headphone amps into one box.

Q010: Do I need a separate DAC?
* The answer is likely no. Often DACs are built into amplifiers, so you can use those.
