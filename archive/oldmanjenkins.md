That mantra has helped me calm down during the times where my friends need me the most. I'm always the one with the plan and the one that's able to  lead everyone to the catching the guy in the suit. It didn't help matters that for a bunch of young people who just got themselves an apartment, we were always getting at least one client that someone in the gang wanted to help out for one reason or another. Whether or not it was Shaggy and Scooby wanting to go to some popular food festivals, Velma with her "impossible" cases and Daphne with the stories that tug at her heart strings. I never really involved myself in the case choosing, mostly because I got a football career I got to look forward to. It always a Plan B for just in case things go awry or the gang is broken up but more and more it feels like it's becoming a goal I need to reach sooner rather than later. I mean we can't do this stuff forever right? Back then we'd ride around in my refurbished camper van to solve some mysteries because it was fun. These days it just feels like...work I guess. Less of a sprawling adventure, more of something we do to pay the bills. It's probably just me, I got no idea.  Anyways, the gang had chosen for us to check out this amusement park by the pier of some place in Florida. All expenses for the trip will be paid and we'd be arriving there by train. These kinds of cases are the "break case" ones. Easy pay out, a chance to relax to and from home with a slight scare in the middle. We all voted yes on it and then we were off, on our way to solve another simple mystery.

The client was kind enough to get us some first class tickets, certainly nicer than other ones who'd either pay for the gasoline or just wished us good luck on the travel. It wouldn't be a long train ride going to and away from Florida so we just packed lightly and got the suitcases safe while we had some time to ourselves. Scooby had to be snuck onboard since trains don't usually accept the excuse that he's a 'worker dog' so he was resting in Shaggy's room. Both Shaggy and Velma were giggling to themselves as they hid some double decker sandwiches underneath their shirts. Practically on the cusp of being a couple yet they always pass it off as just being friends, although I've heard on more than occasion of Velma whispering "with benefits." after they say that. Daphne was having a casual drink of a cosmopolitan. I sat myself down by her and ordered some cola. "Always the straight lace, huh?" She must've been on a couple of them by now, her version of liquid courage that she needed for some cases. "You know I don't drink during work hours Daph, can't come up with a plan when I'm not at full capacity y'know?" "Suit yourself Freddy, there isn't anything wrong with taking a load off before we work." "This *is* me taking a load off." "Suuure. So what are the details for this mystery?" "Let's see...

"The owner of the place Kenny Wilds was in his office late at night when he heard some loud noises outside in the hallway. At first thinking it was the janitor, the noises grew louder and louder until they were right outside his door. He ducked under the desk to hide in a panic. He didn't hear the door open yet he heard a loud humming sound. It was already inside. The thing was bathed in a glowing, blood red light and it went to his desk before grabbing something out of one of the drawers, Mr Wilds doesn't want to say what that something is. It peered its head down after grabbing it and held a finger to where its mouth was supposed to be. It had yellow pin prick eyes that greatly unsettled Mr Wilds. It left soon after, although Mr Wilds was unable to leave until morning due to the fear of running into it. His assistant will be the one telling us where to go and where to look as he refuses to go back to the pier until he knows for sure the monster is gone."

By the end of the debriefing, Daphne looked like she had just seen the Red Ghost then and there right behind me. She knocked on the bar and held up two fingers at the bartender before swigging down her drink. "Jesus Freddie...So much for a break case, huh?" "You think the other three will be alright with this?" "Maybe? They're usually good for all of our mysteries. Especially Shaggy these days." "Pretty much. One of these days, he'll hopefully get himself his own job." "He's fine enough as it is with us, from what I've seen he's done pretty well with his cut of earnings from cases." "However good that may be, he and the rest of us should be prepared for the worst." "We're going over this conversation again?" "It's important to have." "Not for the 10th case in a row. Look if you want to drop out for a bit and have a break while we work, no one will judge you for that." "You won't judge me. But I'll judge me. I'll keep doing this with you guys but I'm just saying...we can't keep doing this forever." She gave me a peck and cheek and gave me a hug. Her hair smells lovely...I gave her one back. "It'll be okay Freddie. We're not going to do this forever but we'll be with each other forever. Right?" 

"Of course."

Soon after that, we got to our stop and took a taxi to the pier. Daphne filled in Velma on the details I gave her while Scooby and Shaggy watched some Youtube videos Shaggy downloaded on his phone. I couldn't help but peek some glances at what they were watching, laughing alongside the two. It's a method I tend to use whenever I need to relax before the case starts, helps release some stress by hanging out with the gang. It wasn't a long drive but the time spent in that car was vital. When we got there, it was clear as day that the pier had seen better days. That much alone could be told from the front entrance and the walk to the office building. Everything from the signs to the rides to the wooden planks beneath us told us that this place was one accident away from a complete shutdown. It was a wonder how the place was kept alive at all, to be completely honest. "Heya Fred, like after we check out that kooky building me and Scoob are going to set off on our investigation of this place. Y'know, get a head start and all." "Let me guess, heading straight first for the concessions stand?" "Oh you betcha! L-like just to see if the ghost was feeling peckish of course!" "Reah, reckish!" "Alright alright, could do with a quick bite to eat myself there. I'll join you guys there, Daphne and Velma can ask around the building." The two girls gave a thumbs up and we carried on our way to the office.

The assistant to Mr Wilds greeted us at the entrance and brought us to the scene of the crime. It was a bit of a tight fit with all six of us in the office room but we each looked through a section of the place. Velma kept herself glued to the desk where the item was stolen, Shaggy and Scooby looked around at the entrance, I had my eyes peeled on the floor and Daphne spoke with the assistant to get some more details. Velma wasn't sure as for what was taken, the door wasn't forced open, I couldn't find any footprints and at most we had three suspects; Tim Shawe whose a janitor that has it out for Mr Wilds for insufficient pay, Barbra Kells whose a former worker that's been campaigning for the shutdown for the pier and Bradley Hughes whose a frequent vandal of the place. The assistant had the alibi of having a dinner with her husband during the night of the incident. After that, I gave Daphne a quick hug and wished the two girls luck on their side of the case while the rest of us went to get something eat.

The two were practically rushing over to every stand to see what they could grab, ordering the best item off of the menus for all of them so that they didn't have to wait long for a meal. I just settled for a classic ketchup and mustard hot dog with fries while they got what could only be described as a buffet of food for themselves. Despite seeing them go at it for years at this point, it's always a marvel to see the two demolish whatever they pick to have on their plate. By the time I was finishing the hotdog, the food on their plate was gone. "Phewie! Not the best food Florida has offered but a darn good meal nonetheless!" The two laughed to themselves as I ate my fries. It didn't seem like a good time to ask but...it was as good as time as any. "So Shaggy, Scooby...ahem...have you two ever thought about what you want to do after Mystery Inc?" "After? Do ya wanna throw in the towel Fred?" "No no, of course not! Just...in the case that does happen." "Ri haven't rhought rabout it." "Neither have I. Like, this is the kind of job that lasts for as long as you want it to last." "Right right. Sorry I asked." "Not at all!" We sat around a bit more in silence as they had some drinks and I finished eating my fries. "...Sorry, it's just...I'm worried that if something goes wrong, you guys won't have anything to fallback on." "Fred, it's cool. Right now I don't think it's important to need a fallback. Like it's good to have and all but if you love what you do and the people you're with, life is perfect. Ain't that right Scoob?" "Right!" Couldn't help but smile along with them at that. That was another thing that kept me going through the tough spots in these mysteries:

All of my friends.

Speaking of, it was about high time to check out how the other two were doing. I wished the two of them luck as they got to searching the outside of the building and I went out to find Velma and Daphne. Checking where they were last time, I found Velma looking through the outer hallway out from the office to find some clues. "Anything new you found out?" "Nope, nothing of the sort Fred. Also, hi." "Hello to you too! Any deductions so far?" "Not a whole bunch, which is a definite problem. I don't see Barbra or Bradley wasting enough of their valuable time getting a bright and expensive costume to intimidate Kenny so it leaves Tim as the only suspect. But that doesn't make any sense since why would the janitor just rummage through a desk drawer and grab just one thing? Something's not adding up here and I don't know what." She wandered around in a circle as she kept thinking on what could be the missing puzzle piece. "...Anyways, do you know where Daphne went off to?" "Huh? Oh right! She went off to the lobby to speak to anyone who could've been a witness." "Right right, thanks Velma-" We were interrupted by the loud and piercing sound of a shrill shriek. The two of us started running to the source to find out what was happening.

By the time we reached the lobby, we saw the Red Ghost holding onto Daphne on his shoulder. He was running off to the side off in the distance yet even there, I could tell he was taller than me. He seemed taller than what anyone could reasonably be. His red light bathed the dark hallway it was running into and his movements were sloppy and erratic. Like he was trying to find somewhere to escape but couldn't find a place. Velma stayed behind to check up on other people while I pursued, I wanted to make this freak stop hurting Daphne. Shaggy and Scooby cut him off at the end of the hallway, I think they might've came in through the side entrance. They made a showing of trying to look tough but in response, the Red Ghost swung at the two and them and snarled an awful growl. Scooby tried to pounce on him but whatever the Red Ghost was made off, it was hot to touch as I heard the sound of singed flesh being made. If a momentary touch made Scooby scamper off like that...Daphne was in serious trouble. I had to step in and save her.

-> Just a simple mystery. <-

I grabbed a nearby fire extinguisher and sprayed it all over him, I wasn't sure if that was going to cool him down or anything but it was a needed distraction. He dropped Daphne by his side and ran off ahead, leaving her on the ground. We all gathered around her to see if she was okay. And...she wasn't. She really wasn't. The touch by that Red Ghost had burned completely through her clothes and onto the skin. All of the parts of her body that was touched by the thing looked like cooked minced beef.

-> Just a simple mystery. <-

 Smelt like burned beef too. That was the only thing I could smell at the time. I only just noticed that I could see parts of her ribcage within the browned and charcoaled parts when I had to turn away and keep chasing after the Red Ghost. He wasn't going to get away with this, that I knew for sure.

-> Just a simple mystery. <-

I saw him ran straight into the Employees Only section of the place so that's where I followed him. He was relatively easy to catch up with considering that I could easily see him with the glowing red light. We ran past some people still working, he brushed up against someone who started screaming about his eye being burned. I couldn't stop to help.

-> Just a simple mystery. <-

 He ran further backstage and ran up some rickety stairs, the back half of the office building was repurposed into a theatre for kids. Something was up with him as he was walking and running all over the place, like he didn't even know where he was anymore. But I kept going after him, kept running at the person who had hurt Daphne. 

-> Just a simple <-

As he ran, he tripped on a worker's toolbox. He was thrown headfirst into the guard rail. And then he stumbled over it. And fell two stories down to the ground. I stood there frozen. I forced myself to walk to where he had fallen to see if he landed on something soft. All I saw was the Red Ghost curled up in a ball. He was snoring. Blood pooling out from the gaps of his costume. He was squirming. Trying to crawl but his body was in too much pain. Other people ran towards him and panicked amongst themselves. I didn't move. I couldn't move.

I killed him. Running off of pure anger, I chased him to his death.

Eventually we were informed that Kenny Wilds did not survive the fall. From what the police could gather, the Red Ghost was a publicity stunt to try and get some people interested in a haunted amusement park. Daphne was able to make a decent recovery, although it's unlikely she'll be able to run around much like the old days. Shaggy and Scooby have been doing well in making sure she's been having a fun recovery. Velma...she's been completely out of it. Hasn't spoken to all of us at once in person since a week after that night and has only been keeping in touch with Shaggy. Whether it's because of what I did or what happened to Daphne, I don't know. But she might be gone for good. And I might be too. I mean I can't let myself work when I'm like this. I shouldn't have let myself work that night. They were right, I needed the break for my own health. But because I wanted to protect my ego, I let someone die. So... after some consideration, here's what going to happen. Consider this an announcement for the general public and...and for you guys too.

Shaggy.

Scooby.

Velma.

Daphne.

This was the one thing I wish never would've happened.

I declare that the Mystery Gang is dead and gone, effective immediately.

I know this hurts but because of what's happened, we cannot work as a team anymore.

I'm sorry everyone.

I hope we can just stay as friends.

I don't want to you lose guys.

But we can't be the Mystery Gang anymore.

This is Fred Jones, signing off.

See you guys around.
