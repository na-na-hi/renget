1. NAAA, the side effects of it aren't taken into account in nearly as much depth as they should've been and it has too many issues for it to be implemented in its current state. Alot of the votes for it are made by nations that are affected the least and many of the ideas don't consider how the most affected nations would deal with it, it took me bringing up the specific issues that I found with it for them to be discussed at all which really should have been done regardless by many of the people voting yes and this kind of shows in the general response to those issues being, "well yeah but still" and "we already have that issue". There's also the lack of acknowledgement as to why nuefag made the map how it is in the first place, which was so that we could start writing lore with a location in mind without relying on future reps which this essentially brings us right back to, it also seems unlikely that we'll get an influx of dedicated writers considering we've already agreed to not going around other threads to get people to join. I don't really see how this is an improvement, it just seems like an equal proposal with just as many problems, nanora.
2. Nay, also isn't this the same as Abstain? I don't see why this is cannot abstain and the other isn't since one is of way more consequence nora.
