===Harahel v0.7.7===
Dorothy "Dolly" Byxmori
Race: [Moth], [Fairy]
Sex: [Female]
Hair: [Turquoise]
Eyes: [Violet]
Skin: [Ghostly]
Face: [Girly]
Height: [Average]
Bust: [Medium]
Hips: [Thicc]
Butt: [Feminine]
Fitness: [Slim]

##F.M.S.U.
[Eggnancy], [Curse of A Thousand Maidens], [Life, Uh, Finds A Way], [Indestructible Ahoge], [Love Nectar], [Eggz]
(I see no downside here)

##G.R.M.
[Arms], [Wings], [Tasty Fate], [Regeneration], [Bio-Immortal], [Tireless], [Mofu Mofu], [Monster Mash x1], [Caustic Blood], [Kyuu], [Aqua Affinity], [Mushi], [Sleigh Beggy], [Auxiliary Systems], [Doublethink]
(I need the caustic blood to counter love nectar. Sleigh Beggy is not only a free demon core, but I also get paid. I got rid of ubermensch, so know I have doublethink for the soul split combo)

##U.T.T.
[Perfect Pxxxy], [Fertile Fields], [Pxxx Physics], [Divine Pregnancy], [Back Support], [Pron Studio], [Contortionist], [Mr Clean], [World Clean], [Long Tongue], [Flavour Town], [Absolute Comfy]
(I don't think I need to explain any of this...but I do have a question. Do I need P00n Physics if I have Pixie? I should have asked this long ago...)

##Spawn Point
[LOST]
(Free points...also I'm bad at deciding things)

##Player Count
[10,000 People]
(There is no point in wasting 5 points if everyone else I know if in the 10,000 worldline...)

##Afterlife
[Mastema - Arbiter of Sanctuary]
(I can only take a month of slice of life before going insane)

##Afterlife Timer
[1 Month]
(A short rest after adventuring)

##Death Mods
[Corrupted Vision], [A Most Terrible Fate], [Metamorphosis]
(25 points for dying once and 5 for having weird dreams? Nice. Metamorphosis is an adventure I keep to myself)

##Banes
[Ooh Shiny], [Pixie], [Fate Dynamo], [Ahegao], [Damsel], [Masochist], [Lightweight], [Femininity], [Calamity Magnet], [Dankest Dungeons], [Hephaestus’ Curse], [Mark Of Failure], [Just Passin’ Through]
(I see no downside in most of this, but having Damsel, Sleigh Beggy and Love Nectar might be bad. I going to need to be a little paranoid)

##Boons
[Ooga Booga] (I can't get lost)
[Hush Money], [HUD], [Hammerspace Inventory], [Status] (Necessary to deal with the natives)
[Tasty Prof], [Torpor], [Permanence] (Not necessary, but cool to have it)
[Man Portions] (I can not get poison)
[Hero] (A tier IV is never bad)
[Inconspicuous] (Sneaky sneaky)
[Face Me] (I don't wanna get weird commands from around the globe)
[JuJu] (A little help for the rest of the team, but I may get rid of it in the future)
[VooDoo] (It can help a lot)
[Flavour Flay], [Sensory Overdose], [Darkvision] (Necessary)
[Lucky!] (Let's tip the scales)
[Final Journey] (I may die but I won't lose)
[Transmog], [Relative Realism]
[Talk To Me] (Good to have)
[Aura’s Veil] (Necessary to deal with other EOH)
[Soul Split] (I took this for RP reasons, it will make some things make sense)

##Items
[Riftgate Licence], [Survival Guide], [Magic Mirror], [Knowledge x1]
(I cannot carry that much, so I only pick the essential)

##Proficiencies
Agility 2
Endurance 2
Durability 3
Cooking 2
Beast Mastery 1
Arcane 2
Elemental 4
Luck 4

The cutest moth ever.

#Profile

##Name
Dorothy "Dolly" Byxmori

##One line description
The cutest Moth-Fairy girl you will ever meet.

##Physical description
A 2ft Half-Moth Half-Fairy with ghostly skin, Turquoise hair, white fluffy fur in her neck and arms, violet eyes, black antennae, 4 4-finger arms, and beautiful wings.
(I did draw her, so you can look at her. I'm bad at describing things)

##Personality
A friendly yet slightly paranoid moth girl whose hobbies are: stalking cute couples, stalking maids, stalking cuties, being cute, being pampered, shipping, give opinions that nobody asked for, contemplate the consequences of her actions.
(A lot have happened, so I probably have to rewrite some of this to reflect her present RP personality)

##Backstory
She was hiding in the great wilds until a chuuni singularity happened and found a bunch of EOHs that she stalked for a while and then made friends with them.
(Maybe I will expand on this someday)

##Goals
-Chill.
-Being cute.
-Being Happy.
-Not being alone.
-Not becoming an arka-battery.
-Having lewd adventures.
-Know more about the maid cabal.
-Stop thinking that if Earth was destroyed so easily, nothing prevents Harahel from sharing the same fate.

##Status
About to get married to Fuko.
Having a lot of totally platonic sexual tension with Idri.
Being Athena's Maid.

##Expectations
Nothing right now, Dolly is kinda away from the general RP doing her own things at the moment.
Ask in chat before engaging if you are not in the scene please.

##Violence Comfort Level
