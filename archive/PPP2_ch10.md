#### Input and Output Streams
>*“Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.”* —Richard P. Feynman

*"In this chapter and the next, we present the C++ standard library facilities for handling input and output from a variety of sources: I/O streams. We show how to read and write files, how to deal with errors, how to deal with formatted input, and how to provide and use I/O operators for user-defined types. This chapter focuses on the basic model: how to read and write individual values, and how to open, read, and write whole files. The final example illustrates the kinds of considerations that go into a larger piece of code. The next chapter addresses details."*
