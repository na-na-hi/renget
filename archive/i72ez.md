# Day at the Fair
Ame stood waiting near her door. Reine was supposed to arrive soon - on top of activities that they had planned together, Ame had agreed to take Reine to visit some attractions in America, as a friendly date. Once the doorbell rang, Ame opened up the door to her apartment. Reine smiled but then recoiled.
"Hi Reine! ...Whassa matter?" Ame said.
"Good afternoon, Amelia. I'm sorry about the reaction, I wasn't expecting it to be so..." Reine's nose wrinkled, it was clear something smelled bad. "Anyway!" Reine laughed.
"I have a lot of animals!" Ame said, getting defensive.
"No, no I know you do, I know you do. May I come in?"
"Of course!" Ame let her inside.
Ame gave Reine a quick tour of her apartment. Reine pretended to look impressed with everything, but Ame wasn't buying it.
"You know, I have trouble cleaning my room too." Reine said, diplomatically. "When it gets too bad, that's where housecleaners can help."
"I don't want to make trouble for anyone else, I wanna do it my way!"
"Well, if you leave it like this you're gonna get sick." Reine said. "I just don't want you to be unhealthy."
Ame fumed. She never liked backseating.
"Hasn't anyone else been around lately? Hasn't anyone else seen your room?" Reine asked.
"It's mostly just my genmates, although Kiara and Mori live too far away to visit very much." Ame said, hiding her salt. "Gura's not particularly clean either and Ina... well, let's just say she learned to enjoy my filthiness."
"Oh really? And how does someone learn to do that?" Reine asked.
Ame did a little gremlin laugh. "Oh, I think you'll find out."
After the house tour, Ame took Reine to a nearby restaurant. A local place that Ame visited quite often.
"I've never had this before." Reine said, as she ate the food that Ame ordered for her. 
"Good isn't it?" Ame said innocently.
Reine had no idea that the food Ame gave her, especially in this combination, would make her gassier than she'd ever been. 
Ame helped herself to it as well.
"I will say it's a little cheap... but it's pretty delicious." Reine gave her trademark chuckle.
"Yeah, that's a lot of classic American food in a nutshell." Ame admitted. "Let's make our way to fair! I want to show you our ferris wheel."
"How romantic!" Reine said, and laughed again.
"Heh heh heh." Ame gave a foreboding laugh.
The line was longer than either girl expected. As they moved to the front of the line, Reine shuffled uncomfortably, holding her stomach.
"I'm going to go to the-" Reine started, but Ame paid her no mind and pulled her into the car. "Woah! Okay, I guess I can wait."
The two girls sat in the car. Reine clenched as hard as she could. There was a look of concentration on Reine's face as their ride began.
Ame pretended not to notice and took out her phone, turning on the camera function. "I'm gonna take video of this lovely moment!"
"Wait, hold on!" Reine said trying to stop her.
"Is everything okay?"
"I think I should have... Oh no..." Reine flushed as she tried her best to hold it in, but it was at that moment that Reine couldn't hold it in any longer. She let out a long, drawn out fart, right on camera. The enclosed space trapped the odor, letting the stink stew inside the car.
"Reine! I can't believe you would do that in here." Ame said, disingenuously.
"I couldn't hold it in!" Reine covered her face, fully red. 
Ame placed her phone upright on the seat, but didn't stop recording. "Why don't you lay down?" She said. "That always helps me."
Reine did what Ame suggested. It did relieve some of the pressure, but she could tell it was only a matter of time.
"Here you were judging me about the cleanliness of my place, but look at how filthy you are!" Ame taunted. She also knew her own gas was going to force its way out of her, but she was more practiced at controlling it. 
Reine farted again, making the car smell even worse. She had never felt so embarrassed in her entire life. Reine could feel herself getting wet from Ame's extreme dominating presence.
"My, you really are hopeless at holding it in, aren't you? Well, you're going to have to endure your own stink now!" Ame said.
Reine moaned loudly. "Oh no... I'm gonna... I'm gonna..." 
Reine involuntarily pooped herself. Her panties started to bulge out as they filled up. She kept producing more and more, balooning them out and stretching them, in full display of Ame.
"Look at the mess you made! We're gonna get in trouble!"
"No... I..." Reine gulped. "I... I'll take responsibility."
Ame pulled down her own panties. "Well okay. If you're sure about that."
"Ame?" Reine said, as Ame walked over and hovered over her.
"Of course, like you so politely pointed out, I'm not afraid of a little smell." Ame could feel the need to release coming.
"Are you going to...?" Reine said. 
"Ask for it." Ame commanded. Her bare ass was hanging over Reine's face. 
Reine let out a little more wind. Her face took a pitiful expression.
"O...okay... You can do it..."
"No. You have to ask for it. And be specific!" Ame said.
"You can... you can... Ame will you please..." Reine gulped "...fart on my face?"
On cue, Ame let it go. She ripped a monstrous smelly fart right all over Reine. Reine shuddered in shame. The room was getting to be quite smelly at this point.
"Aww are you holding your breath? You're kinda missing the point, aren't you?" Ame said. "Take a whiff already!"
Reine closed her eyes and took a sniff of Ame's ass. Her eyes rolled back from the intense smell.
"W... wow." Reine said, flustered. "Are you... do you... are you..."
Ame straddled Reine's chest.
"I'm not done yet." Ame said.
Ame closed her eyes and released her bowels. A long rope of shit snaked out of her, covering Reine's outfit top with her filthy excrement.
Reine gasped. "We're... We're going to get out of the car soon... How are we going to clean this up?"
"Pretty simple." Ame said. "We just have to hide it." Ame ran her finger along Reine's lip. "Maybe you can suggest someplace?"
Reine's legs rubbed together as her pussy got even wetter. Ame's domination was overwhelming.
"You've got more reputation to lose than I do, princess~" Ame said, with a cheery threatening tone.
"Well... since this is my fault, I guess I'll have to hide it in..." Reine's voice got quieter. "...my mouth."
"How generous of you! Well, since you're being such a good sport, I'll help you do that."
Ame slid Reine's ruined panties off carefully, taking care not to touch or spill the payload. She produced a pair of gloves from her bag and turned them inside out. She put them on and began to pick up the messy pile that Reine had produced. She wasn't particularly careful, smushing lots of filthy residue against the inside of the gloves.
"Say aaaah~ We don't have much time, after all."
"Aaaaah~" Reine said, feeling absolutely humiliated. She couldn't help but play up her helplessness to Ame.
Ame began feeding Reine her own shit, taking a reasonable amount of care not to get any on her face. A look of sickly disgust fell over Reine's face as she ate. She chewed it quickly and swallowed it down. She opened her mouth for more. Ame took a fistfull and pushed it in. This time it was harder for Reine to keep it all in, but she obediently continued to choke it down, bite after bite. 
"Look at you wolfing it down so eagerly." Ame taunted.
Reine nervously eyed the window. They were getting closer and closer to the ground. She finished gobbling her own turd. All that was left was Ame's. But Ame merely held it as if waiting for something, even as the clock ticked.
"Aren't you going to...?" Reine said, clearing her throat.
"Well, it's mine isn't it? If you want it, you've gotta ask politely. And don't forget to be specific!"
Reine closed her eyes. Her dignity was in tatters. "Ame, may I please eat your poop?" Reine pleaded desperately.
"Oh what's that? You wanna eat my poop?"
"Please, Ame!"
"Maybe want is the wrong word. What's a better way to say that?" Ame looked down at Reine.
Reine trembled. She said, in a louder voice than she'd intended, "PLEASE, AME! I NEED TO EAT YOUR POOP!"
"Well, since you begged me for it, I guess I have to!" Ame said, laughing. 
Ame took her excrement and began pushing it into Reine's face as one long unbroken rope. Reine desperately devoured Ame's poop as quickly as she could.
"You enjoying your chocolate desert?" Ame said, in mock sweetness.
"Mmmmf." Reine answered indistinctly, but she was getting even wetter. Finally she managed to reach the end.
"Alright, what do we say when somewhat feeds us?" Ame said. She removed the gloves from her hand and started reverting them back to right-side-in. 
Reine cleared her throat, then swallowed the rest of the filthy stool in her mouth.
"Thank you for the meal, Amelia." She said, submissively.
"You're welcome! Okay, put these gloves on. Might wanna hurry!" Ame urged. "And lick your lips, they're filthy!"
Reine made a noise of protest. "Those gloves are so..."
"Put them on already!"
Reine nodded nervously and put the gloves on. A very icky feeling came over her fingers. The residue was pressed into them from the inside. Ame threw the ruined panties carelessly into Reine's bag and picked up her still-recording phone. Reine tried licking her lips, but she wasn't able to get it all off.
"Fine, I'll help you again then!" Ame leaned toward Reine and kissed her on the lips, slathering Reine's lips with her saliva, sucking them messily and then forcing the filthy spit back into Reine's mouth. Reine shivered with arousal.
The ferris wheel came to a stop. As the opening of the doors let a lot of fresh air in, in full view of the outside world, Reine gulped down Ame's dirty spit. Unfortunately even as the stinky air left the car, Reine still stunk badly. There nothing was visually wrong with her unless you could see under her dress, so the attendant waved her by.
"Well that was fun!" Ame said, jovially as they walked through the fair. She patted Reine on the back. Since Reine was still gassy, and her stomach was filled again the stimulation caused Reine an uncontrollable, undignified belch. The aftertaste was somehow even worse than the taste had been. The rancid stench coming from her mouth turned heads. She could feel the judgmental stares from everyone around her. Some even made noises of disapproval her way.
She tried to ignore how wet it was making her. 
"Should we... head back now?" Reine said hopefully. "Clean up a bit? Change of clothes?"
"I don't think so." Ame said. "I've got a whole day planned for you still. Remember what I said that you were going to find out?"
Reine was quiet until they moved to a less crowded area. "Can... can I at least go to the bathroom to wipe myself?" Reine whispered.
Ame thought for a moment. "Well, under one condition." She took her phone out again. "I'll film us walking around in public like this for a few minutes and do an upskirt of your filthy butt. And you have to act proud of it."
Reine swallowed. It still tasted foul. "I... I'll do it... but what exactly are you planning to do with the footage?"
"A better question would be, what are you willing to do to keep it just as our private masturbation material?"
"Our? What makes you think I'd... you know?"
Ame smiled. She knew she'd get Reine there.
