State of Mind: Adaptability
Philosophy: Mortal (+175)

The Tao of Adaptability promotes changing oneself whenever one finds a challenge that they can't face. To discard anything unnecessary in the pursuit of sovereignty, becoming something new whenever the old you isn't enough to take the next step. If swiftness and unpredictability are required, then be like the Wind. If profudinty and resilience are necessary, be like the Sea. If you need to be a guide to others, providing truth, be like the Sun.

This Tao was not given to Yasha by a teacher. He forged it himself, because the Tao taught to him wasn't compatible with his personality.

Yasha's Soul Scenery is a forest. In the center of that forest, there is a water terrace leading to a temple. And inside that temple, there is a [Tangram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Tangram_set_00.jpg).

Sometimes, the tangram gets new pieces. Other times, it loses some. It builds itself into a new shape. It changes colors. It is an ever-growing, ever-changing puzzle, and it is the core of Yasha's mind.

#### -> Personal History (+35) <-
Yasha was born as Ye Jingshen in the Yexuan Martial Empire. His father was a humble farmer and his mother a simple seamstress, but he yearned to join the imperial nobility in the ways of cultivation. Every 2 years, Yexuan would organize a martial arts tournament to promote gifted youths. After the winner was decided, the top 4 would be offered peerage.

When Ye Jingshen turned 16, he entered such a tournament, and though he ended in 2nd place, it didn't matter. He had climbed above hundreds of others and secured his spot. Yet, when it was his time to start his journey, it was discovered that Jingshen was incompatible with the cultivation practiced by Yexuan. In fact, he was a complete cripple in all forms of Qi Gathering.

His continued presence in the upper echelons was deemed as an ill omen, and he was unceremoniously kicked out from nobility. "May you fix your karma and walk the path to immortality in your next life," they told him. Depressed, he returned to his home, ready to tell his parents the bad news. There however, his mother held a letter adressed to him, sent after the tournament had ended.

It was an invitation from the Lanhua Immortal Empire to join their ranks. Although his talent for Qi Gathering was void, they had detected an immense potential for Soul Refining within him. Reinvigorated, Jingshen accepted. With a trusty steed his parents bought for him with most of their savings, he traveled to the immortal empire with haste.

Sadly, his second chance was merely a facade. The Lanhua Immortal Empire was actually the Hongjian Devil Sect, preying on the weak and unfortunate, and passing on their Tao to those compatible with it. Jingshen was placed in a separate dimension called the Crimson Prison Formation, forced to battle other aspiring cultivators every day for the right to live.

Though he despised the cruelty surrounding him, he also thrived in that supremely competitive environment, easily learning the techniques taught by the sect, slowly climbing its hierarchy, and making tense connections with the other inmates. After turning 17, he passed his fourth tribulation and decided he was ready to join the outside world again.

He fought, devoured, and killed many, but eventually, he reached Crimson Prison's place of power and ripped a hole to the other side.

Branded a wanted man by the Hongjian Devil Sect, Jingshen discarded his previous identity and became Yasha, a wanderer seeking sovereignty.

>Fated Encounter: Immortal Scripture
It once belonged to an immortal lord who opposed the Hongjian Sect's ancestor, and was killed in an ambush for not knowing his enemy enough. His corpse was used as a component for the Crimson Prison Formation.

Before his untimely demise, he used a technique to create a pocket dimension and hide this priceless scroll. That pocket dimension was transformed into a subdimension of the Crimson Prison, laying there unnoticed for centuries. Yasha's Grade 4 tribulation disturbed the space around him enough to uncover it.

This scripture was the deciding factor for Yasha's rebellion. After uncovering it, he acquired the confidence to finally form a escape plan, and the power to oppose the elders in his way to freedom.

>All-Devouring Dharmadhatu [Grade 10 Soul Refining + Grade 10 Taming] (Sect Freebies) (-20)

A cultivation technique that grants its wielder the ability to absorb the soul energy of others. After absorption, the wielder cultivates by mixing the target's energy with their own, and depending on the amount absorbed, a new soul spirit can be formed inside the wielder's mind sea, with characteristics that reflect the original soul.

This technique requires an extremely egotistical wielder. One that will not lose their individuality as they absorb the mind of another. It was created by a man with the Tao of a Tyrant, whose soul scenery was like a graveyard holding the countless soul spirits of enemies he slayed. Eventually, he succumbed to a Heart Devil, and the monster piloting his body broadened the applications of his cultivation with a Taming technique.

After mixing the absorbed soul energy with his own, the devil would return a part of it to the victim, flooding their empty soul with an essence that wasn't their own, yet at the same time, was. This 'taming by devouring' doesn't come with any manuals for how to appease the target, but it doesn't need to. Taking the victim's soul energy gives the tamer a deep understanding of their mind, and giving it back forms a deep, very one-sided bond.

The All-Devouring Dharmadhatu and the Tyrant's Tao were inherited by the Hongjian Devil Sect and spread by its members. The sect would promote cultivation by trapping its disciples inside a separate dimension, forcing them to devour each other to become stronger. Sometimes, mortals, beasts, monsters, and disciples of other sects were also added to the mix, to make the devil disciples stronger without reducing their numbers too much.

The Taming portion of the technique is normally only accessible to its elders, but Yasha stole a scroll with its details during his escape.

When using this cultivation, Yasha does not let his mind sea become a monument of carnage. Instead, he turns it into an ever-growing puzzle, with each soul spirit as a piece.

For example, if he absorbs the soul energy of a human with a strong affinity for the wood element, then the resulting soul spirit would obtain a very small fraction of that affinity, resonating it to whatever Yasha has bonded his Soul Scenery with. And if he absorbs the soul of a fire-aligned beast, he would reach the same effect with fire. However, he can also use the wood soul spirit when mixing the beast's soul energy with his own. The generating reaction between wood and fire would result in a much stronger fire affinity. An evolution that can only happen by discarding the old self.

Due to Yasha's low realm, his soul spirits can only inherit a portion of all talents. He's still not on the level where memories, emotions, and identities can be absorbed.

>Blooming Beast Blood [Grade 10 Body Tempering] (-20)

Practiced by tamers of all ways of life, this technique works through an oath. 

The wielder calls upon a ritual before fighting a creature. This ritual contains a promise to Tame their opponent, be it Beast, Monster, or Human. If they succeed in taming the creature, the wielder can partake in the vital energy generated by the ritual, which is a combination of the blood shed by both sides of the conflict. This life force induces change in the cultivator's body, which becomes more dramatic depending on what was tamed. If the wielder fails in taming, their Bloodline will suffer damage and be considered 1 grade lower for the rest of the day. If they keep trying and failing, the damage will stay longer, and could become permanent, requiring them to cultivate back to their original realm.

The wielder can impose various conditions on the ritual, such as putting a time restriction on fighting their opponent, forcing the battle to stick to one location, or restraining the realms of both sides. Putting more restrictions on the tamer increases the life force gains if they succeed, and putting restrictions on the opponent decreases it. Furthermore, high realm opponents may simply resist the ritual rules.

During a ritual taming, only the wielder, the target, and any creatures tamed by the wielder may participate. Any interlopers will cancel the technique, but in this case, the wielder's Bloodline will remain unharmed.

This method was created by a body temperer with the Lion Tao. A man who wandered into a forest to challenge himself, and ended up captured by the forest's Spirit and forced to endure its trials. When he finally escaped, he adapted the Spirit's primitive magic into this technique. Yasha found comfort in this man's life story, for he was also crippled in his spirit root, yet pushed to godhood with the talents he did have.

##### -> Offensive Techniques <-

>Transcendent Flash [Grade 4 Attack] (Fighting Style Freebie)

A quick-draw sword technique that relies on precisely sensing the target through their soul, then threading the needle on a fleeting weak spot. It was developed by a woman who followed the Sword Tao, and elevated by her madman of an apprentice, who was not satisfied with only finding the weaknesses of living creatures. Instead of finding a new technique to suit his needs, he would practice the Transcendent Flash on mindless targets, visualizing myriad possibilites and trajectories for a cut that would only last a moment.

The delirium he experienced before his blade sang was channeled into the technique and his surroundings, giving it an illusionary aspect.

While the Transcendent Flash occurs, anyone around the sword wielder will only perceive the angles of attack that were discarded before the real strike. Depending on the reaction speed of the opponent and the movement speed of the wielder, this can have varied results. The wielder could decapitate his enemy while they are still stuck in the mirage of them unsheating their sword, or the target could perceive an attack coming, move to avoid it, but still get struck because it was merely a possibility.

>Raindrop Blade [Grade 4 Barrage] (Fighting Style Freebie)

A technique created by a soul refiner of the Raindrop Tao. The wielder stretches out their mind sea, shapes it like a bladed weapon, then attacks with it. Against a living opponent, each blade has the added effect of eroding their mental defenses, making each following attack more effective. Against soulless opponents, it's merely sharp kinetic force.

##### -> Defensive Techniques (-10) <-
>Devil-Denying Shroud [Grade 4 Endurance] (-10)

A technique taught and used by most of the Hongjian Devil Sect cultivators. Since their members cultivate by absorbing the soul energy of others, knowing how to protect themselves from such attacks is mandatory.

The wielder flows a part of their mind sea around their body, generating a thin shroud that serves as a layer of protection. The shroud is an automatic defense that reacts swiftly, exerting telekinesis on physical and qi-fueled attacks like punches or projectiles, and pushing back hostile mind seas.

##### -> Movement Techniques <-
>Chameleon Path[Grade 4 Stealth] (Sect Freebie)

As the name implies, it's a technique stolen from practitioners of the Chameleon Tao. It mutes the user's aura while also changing it to make them part of the environment. In a forest, they could appear as a beast stalking its prey, or as a humble plant with its trunk swaying in the breeze. In a city, they would be unrecognizable among the masses. In a temple, they would gain the air of a seasoned elder, walking purposefully to their destination, unquestioned by any juniors.

##### -> Auxiliary Techniques <-

>Auspicious Monster Summons [Grade 11 Summoning x4] (Immortal Scripture)
![](https://i.imgur.com/SsXGmEv.png)

The wielder of this technique can call upon 4 legendary monster kings in the realm of divinity: Qinglong Youxing, Zhuque Yunyun, Baihu Chao, and Xuanwu Lanzhu.

These summons don't have a time limit and are unconstrained by the summoner's power, so with their help, a Grade 4 Disciple like Yasha can match enemies stronger than himself.

There are several caveats to using this technique, however.

1. It is incredibly straining for someone on his level, equivalent to using a Trump Card. If he wants to perform the technique and continue fighting for an extended period, Yasha has to consciously hold back and only summon them at a portion of their true strength. Because it is draining to use, he also cannot currently summon more than one monster king at a time.
2. Being stronger than him, the monster kings are not under his full control, and will act as they see fit. The Vermillion Bird and Black Tortoise can be relied on in a crisis, but the White Tiger might lash out if called at the wrong time and place, even if Yasha embelishes the technique with chants, sacrifices, and extensive hand signs. As for the Azure Dragon, Yasha has yet to summon him once. Qinglong will kill him for his insolence in every possible future.
3. Summoning these godly creatures at full power would call a lot of attention, and he's a wanted man.

These are things he can fix with time, but for now, he will struggle.

>Qinglong Youxing [Auspicious Monster Summon #1]

!!! note Abrigded chant for summoning Qinglong:
	-> The shining sun always comes with rays of hope. <-
	-> And that hope is here! <-
	-> Come forth, Dragon of the Dawn! <-

!!! note Unabridged chant:
	-> Through all the turmoil. <-
	-> Through all the adversity. <-
	-> These truths remain absolute. <-
	-> He's the first of the symbols. <-
	-> An Immortal God of the wood element. <-
	-> A War God with the title of true dragon. <-
	-> And a Spirit God carrying the spring season's soul.<-
	-> And that is the reason! No matter how formidable of an opponent you are... <-
	-> As long as I have him on my side, I fear nothing. <-
	-> As long as I keep my face close to his sun, I'll never lose. <-
	-> Let your hope light the road, Qinglong Youxing! <-

The abridged chant is already an insult to Qinglong. He will refuse to be called with a shorter declaration than that.

Qinglong only approves of being summoned if he is the first offensive move. Yasha can run away with footwork and travelling, escape with stealth, and defend with endurance, but if he wants to summon Qinglong, he cannot use any attacks or barrages beforehand.

Doing so would imply that his attacks are effective in any way against his opponent. And if it's an opponent Yasha can fight against, then it would be an insult to bring a true dragon into the battle.

Still, this is just a detail. Even if Yasha follows all of his desires for chants and technique orders, Qinglong will still kill him. He does not approve of the young man as a summoner yet.

**Qinglong's Abilities:**

1. Purest dragon bloodline that grants him immense strength, durability, endurance, unrestrainable flight, control over the traditional five elements and the weather, and very deadly roars.
2. Qi that carries affinity for the wood element. Even the most barren lands will flourish under his steps, becoming an ever-growing forest on his command. However, he can also absorb the wood element manipulated by his enemies, turning it into the dew that makes his own life grow.
3. His mind sea is the springtime sun and a dragon's judgment. Those who earn his cooperation will glow brightly and bloom their innate talents, becoming better versions of themselves by being near him. Those who earn his ire will wither away, as he can convert the dawn of his soul into rays of energy that burn body and soul. The dawn will also passively destroy any shadows around him, messing with attempts at hiding one's aura or using stealth techniques, even if they are his allies. A dragon does not need deceit.

>Zhuque Yunyun [Auspicious Monster Summon #2]

!!! note Abridged chant for summoning Zhuque
	-> Relight my fire, Vermillion Bird! <-

!!! note Unabridged chant for summoning Zhuque
	-> Though her gaze is like a calm sea... <-
	-> The warmth in her soul is like the summer's sun. <-
	-> Mankind waits for her to fly along, setting hearts afire without a care. <-
	-> Oh, empress of all birds, lend me your wings. <-
	-> Lift me up to the heavens, the source of your being. <-
	-> You're the magic that I need, Zhuque Yunyun! <-

Zhuque will accept the call even if Yasha doesn't use any chants. She has a bit of a soft spot for him.

**Zhuque's Abilities:**

1. Purest phoenix bloodline that grants her unmatched regeneration, control over fire, and resurrection. Strength and agility are also increased, but not to the level of a bloodline focused on them.
2. Qi that carries affinity for the fire element, increasing the strength of her fire manipulation and granting fire absorption. Those flames also have a purifying quality to them, cleansing evil.
3. The mind sea of the empress of all birds. Zhuque has a soul spirit for every bird under the sun, and she can release their souls or channel their abilities through her mind sea connections. The Qingniao that carries messages to faraway places. The Zhenniao that's poisonous from its veins to the tips of its feathers. And mundane birds like the peregrine falcon that only increase the speed of her allies. Her mastery of the mind sea is high enough to share even her own abilities, allowing her to heal and resurrect her summoner while their souls are connected.

>Baihu Chao [Auspicious Monster Summon #3]

!!! note Abridged chant for summoning Baihu:
	WIP

!!! note Unabridged chant for summoning Baihu:
	WIP

Baihu will only approve of being summoned as a last resort. She wants her summoner to give it their all before relying on her. In this regard, she's the opposite of Qinglong.

The tiger also expects her summoner to keep giving their best even after calling her. Protecting them is different from letting them hide behind her while she does all the work.

**Baihu's Abilities:**

1. Purest tiger bloodline that grants her strength, agility, and senses, alongside claws and fangs that cut through anything evil.
2. Qi that carries affinity for the metal element. Baihu normally manifests it as a pair of gauntlets and greaves that enhance her destructive power and defense, but she can make all sorts of weapons and structures with it. Her metal can also be imbued with the moonlight of her inner world, giving it the ability to reflect the things it meets.
3. The mind sea of the queen of beasts that carries an army of white tiger cubs. Alongside Baihu, they hunt during the night, granting her allies aura-muting properties equivalent to a stealth technique, and also warding off evil.

>Xuanwu Lanzhu [Auspicious Monster Summon #4]

!!! note Abridged chant for summoning Xuanwu:
	WIP

!!! note Unabridged chant for summoning Xuanwu:
	WIP


**Xuanwu's Abilities:**

1. Purest tortoise bloodline that grants her longevity, endurance, and the quality of a living barrier. She has incredible durability and can spread her protection to large areas, without the need for techniques.
2. Qi that carries affinity for the water element. She can use it as an offense that crushes steadily or rapidly. However, her waters can also serve as living barriers, ones that conceptually soak damage. Attacks thrown against the waters are captured on their surfaces, becoming like flowing photos.
3. Her mind sea carries a snake soul spirit that can target an enemy's soul with a deadly toxin. While manifesting the snake, her waters lose their barrier-like quality and become muddied, also gaining venomous properties.

The purple moon above the tides of time. It gives its wearer eyes that can pierce through space and time, allowing them to glimpse anywhere in the past, present, and future. It works by drawing a line between the user's current dimensional coordinates and the point they wish to see.

While looking through time, information is compressed by the treasure and bombarded to the user, so one second in Twilight is equivalent to one microsecond in real time.
