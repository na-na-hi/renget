Delinquent Mari

>Sunny had always had it... A little rough
>He wasn't the most social of kids, in fact if it wasn't for the fact that his sister's boyfriend had a little brother he likely would have never made any friends
>And of course they were great friends and all, but Mari was more than a friend
>Lame as it might sound, she was easily the most important person in his life
>She was always there for him
>From keeping the monsters under the bed at bay to saving his life when he fell into the lake
>Whenever he needed a shoulder to cry on, on a supportive voice to cheer him on, or even just someone who could give him good advice, she was there
>But something happened...
>Mari got older
>She dyed her hair, starter wearing weird clothes, started hanging out with some new nastier friends
>But the worst part is how she treated him
>She got meaner
>It started small at first, a "god, grow up you baby" and shove when Sunny tried to hug her
>A "shut up, I'm trying to sleep" when Sunny tried asking her something in bed
>A "don't you have any of your own friends!" whenever she was hanging out with her new friends at the house
>It got worse though, much worse
>Eventually she wasn't pushing Sunny away, she wanted him around her and her new friends
>But not the way Sunny wanted
>They insulted him, forced him to get him things, hit him hard while claiming they were "just goofing around"
>Now it was Sunny trying to push Mari away, but Mari wouldn't let him
>Even at night Sunny couldn't escape this "new Mari," they shared a room after all
>One night she claimed she could make Sunny "cooler" and forced him to get a lip piercing right there, using a sewing needle and lighter
>It wasn't long before Sunny was "a part of the crew," his hair dyed, piercings everywhere, "cool" clothes
>He wasn't really part of it though
>He was just there to do what they wanted
>One day this ended with him being driven to the police station after Mari forced him to shoplift some earring for her
>Of course he took the full blame for it, he knew if he ratted out anyone else for it he wouldn't be able to sleep without fear of Mari beating him
>He didn't like this but he didn't have any choice
>Kel now thought he was also a punk and refused to talk to him
>Aubrey and her new gang considered him a "rival" and threatened to beat the shit out of him
>Hero was off to collage
>Basil was terrified of him
>All he had anymore was Mari
>No, wait
>He didn't
>HIS Mari, that beautiful, kind big sister who loved him, who never did anything worse than a few harmless pranks, was dead
>This purple haired bitch sleeping in her bed wasn't his sister
>A conviction struck him
>He snuck out of the bedroom, walking over to his parents room
>Slowly, quietly, he opened their door and tip toed to his father
>He opened the night stand drawer, took an object out of it
>Then he snuck out and walked to his room
>He stood over Mari's sleeping body for a while
>When she slept, without her makeup, even with the purple hair, she still looked like the Mari Sunny remembered
>He'd give her one more chance, just one more
>"Mari..."
>She didn't stir
>"Mari!" He whispered louder, shaking her shoulder
>"Sunny, what the fuck, I'm trying to sle-"
>Mari stopped dead the moment she realized she was staring down the muzzle of her dads pistol
>"S-Sunny, what are you..."
>She started crawling away from him, falling out of bed and pressing her back against the dresser
>"C-come on Sunny, y-you know I was only messing around with you..."
>Sunny just stood there silently, sights lined up at her head
>All he wanted was anything, anything at all to indicate that HIS Mari was still in there somewhere
>"J-Just put down the gun Sunny, l-let's talk about this..."
>Please, anything...
>"COME ON! PUT IT DOWN YOU PSYCHO!"
>*BANG*
