>"Sunny, please..." Kel trailed off, blood dripping from his abdomen.

>Sunny shook his head, and stabbed the 12-year-old bound in jump ropes to the old tree once more.

>"It hurts Sunny, please, I love you..." he whispered.

>Sunny ignored him, slicing a long gash in his abdomen causing his entrails to pour out onto the ground.

>Kel's breathing slowed and became heavy, he was passing out.

>But sharp pains brought him back to awareness.

>"OWWWW, IT HURTS!", he screamed as Sunny began stomping on his intestines.

>"HELP!  HELP!", he yelled, his calls falling on deaf ears, Sunny now blissfully spinning and giggling as he stomped heavily on Kel's organs.

>"We love you Sunny, we only want the best for you, why...", he cried, Sunny blissfully unaware as he spun stomping on his organs swinging his knife erratically in tandem giggling maniacally.

>It was a morbid view: in the center stood a mad child torturing Kel, bound to a tree; to the left hung Mari, swinging in the breeze; to the right lay Aubrey, knife still in her stomach; and nearby lay Basil, bruised and beaten to a pulp.

>Sunny stopped smiling and stomping, quickly turning his head towards Hero, and began quickly walking towards him.

>"S-STOP!", Hero bellowed, but as he backed away Sunny slowly followed.

>Hero opened the sliding door and hid behind a kitchen counter, but Sunny was there too, looking for him.

>Hero went from room to room, Sunny always seeming to just miss him.

>He found Sunny and Mari's bedroom.

>Inside he found many things of Mari's he thought he would never see again, he gathered as many things as he could until suddenly he spotted Sunny on the other side of the room!

>He bolted down the stairs clutching as much as he could in his arms holding it against his face.

>He ran into the closet looking for somewhere to hide.

>He spots Mari's toy chest.

>Mari's toy chest.

>He opened it.

>He looked inside.

>Sunny's violin was shattered to pieces, coated in Mari's blood and hair, Mari laid down there bruised, bloodied and broken.

>Hero sobbed.

>Hero woke up with a light moaning cry, his alarm clock showing it was a little after three in the morning.

>Breathing heavily he looked towards the other end of the room.

>Kel's bed was empty, but glancing downwards he noticed Aubrey apparently decided in the middle of the night to sleep next to Kel, Basil, and Sunny in their pillow fort.

>Hero left quietly to get a drink of water and some fresh air...
