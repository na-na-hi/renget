### -> Boss Tips <-
#### Rudolph
##### World Boss Version
Once he switches to the Flame attribute, the player holding aggro must kite him to the balls with green buttons on the floor to stun him and revert his element to electric. There's also a hidden maximum gauge whenever he goes flame on, which after certain amount of time, he'll go nuclear. Rudolph also deal extra damage on this state so it's very important to calm his shit down with the sleeping gas.
##### Battle Test Raid Version
Same as world boss version except he adds a floor is lava attack. When he's going to do this shit, four buttons will appear on the floor and you and your teammate must step on them asap spawning an elevated safe tile to stand on. You can also just shoot an Omnium pillar down and stand on it, or just jump in the air and stay airborne with aerial attacks.

#### Puppet Singer
Jump to dodge most attacks (Failed Shatter Attack)|Grapple phantoms into each other to burst them down faster

### -> Mirroria Funzone Route and Cheese <-
 -> ![Funzone Route](https://files.catbox.moe/kphk6c.png) <-

#### Rythm Score
Equip Samir guns, stand at the yellow line perpendicularly against the incoming notes such that your bullets should hit all the notes right at the perfect time, and hold down the attack button.
-> ![Rythm Score Cheese](https://files.catbox.moe/qd76wn.jpg) <-

#### Ball Toss
Full Clear: https://files.catbox.moe/8ina8x.webm
- Pick a ring and learn its speed; I prefer the middle ring since it's fast and it has the most nodes
- Aim your arc in advance of your chosen node and throw when you feel that the points will intersect (this will ultimately come down to muscle + visual memory)
- Don't feel bad if you choke, it will still happen

#### Laser Corridor
You can bug this for max afk points by summoning your mount and pressing the interact button of the funzone at the same time. Summoning the mount first then instantly pressing the interact button seems to be more consistent than doing the presses in the opposite direction. Make sure that you're not standing too close to the funzone pillar leaving no space for the mount to spawn into. Some mounts and small simulacra seem better for this than others.
!!! warning After you're done press the unstuck button or teleport to return control to normal.
	Unstuck teleports you to the higher floor too which is nice because the next ~~fun~~zone is on this floor.
-> ![Laser Corridor Cheese](https://files.catbox.moe/j0a58v.jpg) <-

#### Wings Tour
Full Clear: https://files.catbox.moe/n7uynx.webm
- Try and aim in accordance to the momentum of the glider (as in above or to the left/right of a cube) though aiming dead on is acceptable depending on the distance
- The final 5 cubes are easier to hit as you get closer, but try from a distance anyways
- There is little to no cap for the amount of shots you can output per second; when in doubt, mash LMB and pray

#### Elemental Magic Box
Equip 3 weapons of different attributes obviously. You can equip Saki A0+ (not fortitude resonance) and use her skill to gain Sword Shadow which inflicts Frost Damage (Flow) when the Wanderer deals damage with any weapon  (0.8 second cooldown). Sword shadow persists even when you swap off Saki so instead of having to swap between 3 attributes for the funzone, you'll only have to swap between 2 (volt and flame).

If you want to try hard and clear it extremely quickly for some reason, then you can add Zero cheese to Saki. This cheese is bit more technical than the rest, but gets much easier with practice and can be macroed (at your own risk). You will need A0+ Zero and A0+ Saki for this:
- Equip A0+ Zero, a fast hitting Volt Weapon, and Pepper/Coco (to generate weapon charge, optional)
- While on Pepper/Coco, generate enough charge to discharge. When done, replace Pepper/Coco with Saki.
- Use Saki's skill to gain Sword Shadow.
- Discharge swap to Zero then in the midst of the animation, jump cancel swap to the equipped volt weapon. This timing is tricky. You should do the cancel around the point the character puts down his leg in the animation. Try and get the macro working to make this less annoying. Here's mine but yours will probably vary in timing:

#### Box Haul
Full Clear: https://files.catbox.moe/mtu677.webm
- An alternative to the presented opening is to start left and Cube the green boxes early; I don't find it to be necessary, YMMV
- Refrain from flinging the camera while in the animation of picking up and tossing boxes, especially while in vicinity of other boxes (unless you think you're a bad enough dude to control the yeet)
- Momentum cancelling via jumping and letting go of your movement keys before landing or by tapping your forward movement key at the end of a run isn't required to 10box, but it can help
- If you enjoy the idea of giving yourself a concussion, run forwards immediately after throwing a box and you can use your head in order to add extra airtime to the thrown box

Use your Strange Cube relic to move multiple boxes quickly. If you can spare SR shards, upgrade it to A3 so that it holds an additional charge. Using certain abilities on the boxes causes them to get launched much further by the Strange Cube. Some valid abilities: Any bow's Arrow Rain attack (Normal Attack + Hold), Claudia Skill

### -> Essential Knowledge <-

#### Climbing Trick
->![Climbing Cancel](https://files.catbox.moe/9nq350.gif)<-
You can climb walls quickly and without spending stamina by letting go of the wall (CTRL), double jumping, moving forward to hold back to the wall, and repeating.

#### Food-based Healing
Passive healing consumes satiety and activates when out of battle. The best way to get satiety is to eat at Mia's kitchen (max 3 times/day). However, passive healing is inactive during instanced content (JOs, DTs...), so craft food and set it to your Quick Use keybind. Radish Soup (requires 1 White Jade Radish) and Crispy Lard Gourd (requires 1 Lard Gourd) are two of the best and cheapest healing foods.

#### User Interface
Make sure to swap to the team panel when doing any team-based content so you can monitor your teammates' HP. 

->![User Interface](https://files.catbox.moe/q1knu7.png)<-

#### Asking for help and team taxis
->![Transmit to team leader](https://files.catbox.moe/sv6433.png)<-
Changing channels has a 30 minute cooldown, but it can be circumvented by joining a team which allows you to freely teleport to the team leader's position and channel. Someone offering a taxi to a boss is asking players to join their team so they can teleport to their location (where the boss is). You can leave the team afterwards to free up space for other players to join and teleport in.

If you want to invite players to help you fight a world boss or strong enemy then you should
1. Create a team
2. Set team mode on (in case you expect a lot of people joining: raises max team size from 4 to 8)
3. Set Auto Approve Requests on (optional but useful)
4. You can press the Recruit button to send a recruit message to the Recruit channel and/or send a message in world chat describing what you want to do like:
->==Sobek ch4 taxi/autojoin/open party...==<-
->or<-
->==AI Large gate help please==<-
->or<-
->==Vera miniboss Fafnir help==<-
You can specify the channel you're on with something like `ch4` but this isn't very necessary.

#### Simulacra Traits
Each simulacra has a unique trait (basic and enhanced version) that you can unlock upon raising its awakening points to a certain level (1.2k for basic and 4k for enhanced) by giving them gifts. They provide various strong buffs to your character and sometimes whole party so its highly recommended to obtain 1 at least and make sure to equip it. Do note that you do NOT have to activate the simulacra or equip their weapon to use their trait. Once you activate the trait, it should show up at your buffs bar above your HP.

****
### -> Misc. Tips <-
- A1 Alternate Destiny heal ignores Wormhole healing reduction

- Stay until you're auto kicked from Stargates for a chance to get the Starseed for a free gold orb. The higher the difficulty of the Star Realm, the greater the chance for Starseeds to appear.
- In case you have a bad Dream Machine run, you can leave (top left button) and re enter the dream to retry with no consequences.
- Equip multiple relic sets and press G to swap between them.
- King can fly (consumes stamina) by holding normal attack while in air and activating the jetpack at the the highest point of the animation and repeating.
- Hold ALT to use Mouse.
- Exit the game by using the Exit Button in the Settings if you want your custom keybinds to survive for another day.
