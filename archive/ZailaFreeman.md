**Name**: Zaila Freeman
**Face:** Zaila has a very childish face, the gap between her front teeth isn't helping the image either. Her expression is almost always cheerful and friendly, her eyes shine with a constant curiosity. 
**Hair:** She wears her hair in long dreadlocks most of the time. When it's undone, she wears her 4C type shoulder length hair in a relaxed style.  
**Eyes:** She has very dark grey eyes.
**Height:** She is very short, barely 160 cm (Around 5.2 ft).
**Bodytype:** She has an athletic but feminine body type, deep bronze skin and very small breasts.   
**Complexion:** She has a very clear skin with no freckles and mostly free from moles. Her very few moles are on the right side of her face, one above her navel, and two on the left side of her chest. There is a visible scar on her nose, thanks to her former bully.
**Uniform variation:** In school she wears skirts slightly below her knee, when out exploring or at home with her parents, she wears pants. In cold weather, she wears pants even in school and tends to wear as many layers of clothing as physically possible, with several scarfs. Those who see her like this can only think of one word: "Comfy". All of her clothes are old, covered by patches.
**Misc:** Her skin is soft and tender to the touch. She has a faint scent of lavender barely noticeable for most. If she spends a longer period of time at home, her clothes smell like mold instead.

**Voice:** She is a quiet speaker unless she gets excited. The more excited she is the louder she gets without noticing. She tries to sound like people around her but the more excited she is, the more her African-American accent bleeds through.
**Body language:** She always gestures with her hand while talking. Despite her feminine and small body her gestures and movements are tomboyish especially when excited. She displays confidence, but that's just acting. When romanced, her behavior turns upside down: She starts acting girly, shy, her movements become gentle. She drops her fake confidence and starts acting like herself. 
**Social:** Zaila doesn't have many friends. She looks up to Margaret Megamelons and sees her like a big sister. She also likes to spend time with My Appletrundle, daydreaming about Slytherin boys. She has a slight crush on the mysterious Slytherin Plague Doctor. She has a crush on many Slytherin boys in fact, but she knows they are all taken. She considers Matthew Russel her friend, who she greets with a hug every time they meet, much to his girlfriend's annoyance. (If she said it bothers her, she would just start hugging her too.)
**Visibility:** She is hard to notice as she tries to avoid attention, she tries to stay away from people but she can also blend into any crowd.
**Engagement:** She is not likely to approach people, unless they look really friendly. (She is more likely to stalk Slytherin boys.)
**Quirks:** She likes to call herself the "Mightiest Witch of Hogwarts" with a loud emphasis on the word "mighty" even if she knows it's a lie. She is a hopeless romantic but also hopeless in romance. She yearns for physical intimacy, be it a hug, a head-pat, or anything else. She likes to draw, and listen to music, but only if there is no singing involved. Her life before Hogwarts was a life of hardships, so whenever she finds something she enjoys, she usually overdoes it (like eats until she gets sick). 
**Things your character wouldn't do:** She would never be cruel to anyone, let alone hurt them. She would never be in any relationship without commitment, flings and one night stuff is a big no for her. She would never exploit anyone for her own gains. She would never mock anyone.
**Animals:** She is very fond of animals and animals are very fond of her too. She has a natural talent handling them and they enjoy her company.
**Misc information that might be useful:** She is not an animagus yet, but when she becomes one, she will use her Kneazel form to get free pets and cuddles from people. If she found My in her rat form while she is in her Kneazel form, she would try to protect her. She would also give My a ride on her back.

**Writing hooks**

She enjoys cooking and baking. She has a taste for sweets.
When she's not stalking Slytherin boys or fantasizes about them with My, she can be seen tending to magical beasts.
She gets visibly uncomfortable when cat-called or when someone makes dirty comments about her.
