#Wintry Love (Sunny/Basil)

In the cloak of the night, only barely grazed by the moonlight from the wide-open window, were two boys sitting on a bed, in a house that was all too quiet.

The creepy silence was only interrupted by the light sounds of their love, as they kissed passionately and savored each other’s tongues.

What was once meant to be a simple sleepover had clearly turned into something much more. A fervent warmth, in contrast to the cold wintry darkness.

It didn’t take long for one of the boys, the dark-haired one, to be enthralled by the fiery lust that grew during their session. He slowly crept his hand up the other boy’s chest, caressing his warm body with his frigid touch and nuzzling his every bone and little feature. 

“S-Sunny…!” the blonde boy, Basil, mewled softly. The breeze he felt under his shirt and around his nipples made him shudder and filled him with the same emotion Sunny felt. 

An emotion completely alien to him. For the first time in his life, it made him forget his usual nervousness and anxiety. Just this once, in his dear friend’s arms, his shyness melted away and was replaced by a strong want.

No, not a want. A need.

A smug smile formed on the blondie’s face, one that Sunny immediately understood. Without uttering a word, he grabbed the dark-haired boy’s elbow and slammed his back against the bed, accompanied by a loud thump. Sunny never saw such confidence in his friend. It was almost frightening, but also… arousing.

Basil tugged onto the bottom of Sunny’s shirt and took the rag of clothing off of his beautiful body, haphazardly tossing it to the ground. In response, the other boy’s trembling hand grabbed the blondie’s shirt. Basil gently took Sunny’s hand and helped him take his own shirt off, before throwing  it aside too.

Both boys were now shirtless, and not a single sound escaped their lips. Instead, they basked in the warmth that exuded from each other’s bodies. As they romantically stared into each other’s eyes, they could only find love and lust within themselves, and with every second those feelings intensified.

Basil broke the silence by lowering his body onto Sunny’s own until their chests touched. His face hovered above Sunny’s collarbone, much to the confusion of the boy below him. But before he could ask the flower boy what he was doing, he sunk his teeth into his shoulder and began softly nibbling at his clavicle.

This time it was Sunny who whimpered in pleasure. He repeated the other boy’s name under his breath as he left a mark on his fair skin; his body was not being harmed, or defiled, but decorated by Basil’s love-filled gnaws. It felt so good, so right. 

Maybe even too good. The blondie suddenly rose from his comfortable position, having noticed a small bump, only getting bigger and bigger, pushing against his thigh. And once Basil curiously lowered his face down to Sunny’s excited crotch, the source of the bulge, he could feel his grin widening, ignoring the other boy’s visible embarrassment.

“Hmm…! Hah… S-Seems like I got you pretty riled up!~ Don’t worry, let me take care of this…!” he giggled quietly, albeit still with a dash of uneasiness in his voice. The two boys’ faces were by now covered in a deep red blush.

Basil’s hand traveled down his side and to Sunny’s barely-covered, throbbing erection. He wrapped his fingers around the boy’s member, and slowly stroked it through his thick pants. Every single motion of his fragile fingers corresponded to a moan, a twitch, a cute little breath from the submissive boy who couldn’t help but react to everything Basil did. 

This thrilled Basil even more. He felt a warmth down in his crotch, and noticed that his small bulge was also growing large, sprouting into a full erection as he fondled his friend’s penis.

At this point, he could not take it anymore. The blondie, usually shy and quiet, fell to his instincts.

He quickly jerked his hand away from Sunny’s crotch and moved it to the dark-haired boy’s pants, brashly unzipping them, still with a searing smile on his face. 

Sunny was perplexed - a gentle motion immediately succeeded by a fast, lustful one? Odd. Not that he objected to it, though.

The flower boy grabbed Sunny’s undone pants and, along with his underwear, pushed them all the way down to his ankles, revealing… it.

Sunny’s penis was exposed to the cold winter air. It twitched nervously in anticipation, reflecting the emotions of the boy to whom it belonged: anxious, sure, but also curious and impatient. Basil couldn’t help but admire it, it was so… beautiful. He drooled and stared at it attentively, like the dreams he’s had for the past years had just become reality. 

Yet, after admiring its presence for long enough, he snapped out of his thoughts and did the same to himself - removing his pants and letting them fall carelessly down to his feet. They wouldn’t be needed anymore. In fact, they were the last thing the two boys needed at this moment.

Basil eagerly rubbed himself onto Sunny, their erect dicks pushing against one another as passionately as was the love between them. Still not keeping his pompous eyes off of the other boy’s flustered face, the flower boy took both of their members into his hand and rubbed them together, intent on comparing their sizes.

The result was shocking, to say the least.

“You're… smaller than I thought!~” Basil joked, a new wave of confidence rushing past him. So meek, yet so big. What a pleasant surprise.

The smaller boy buried his face into the pillow and sucked air through his teeth. “N-No, Basil… P-Please, stop teasing…” he muttered with a tinge of anger, pleading to the boy who’d clearly taken control over him.

Basil scoffed playfully and returned his gaze to their crotches, clutching his hand and sneaking another peek to Sunny’s baffled face. Feeling the warmth from Sunny’s penis permeate his own was… heavenly.

“Well, well… If I got you so excited already, I hope you’re ready for this!” He said, again with a brave look, so unusual for him. Sunny had a thousand questions, but before he could obtain a response to them, he was interrupted.

The blondie suddenly started rubbing their penises together, stroking them with the slow movement of his fingers. 

Jolts of pleasure rippled through the boys’ bodies, like their nerves were intertwined. The loud moans and heavy breaths they released echoed across the empty house and back. Sunny’s entire body was shaking, and he had to tightly grip the bedsheets for support, while the bigger boy did away at his composure and calmness.

Everything was so… new. Sunny had no idea what to feel, and how could he? Sure, he’d touched himself in the past, but that was akin to lighting a matchstick to stave off and escape from the dark reaches of his mind. Those actions were empty, loveless, unlike now. The affection between them was like a raging fire. And even though his mind was like a fog of thoughts right now, he could tell one thing: he was happy, right where he was.

The boy was dragged out of his thoughts when he saw Basil’s face leaning in towards his own for a kiss. Their lips clashed and their tongues met as the blonde boy placed his free hand onto Sunny’s, firmly locking their fingers.

Nearing his climax due to the intense frotting, Sunny detached his lips from the flower boy’s and tried to speak, but so caught up in the moment he was that he couldn’t. Instead, more high-pitched whimpers escaped his shaky lips, followed by heavy panting filtered through his teeth. 

Basil immediately understood that his friend was reaching his tipping point, and so was he. Coated by the precum leaking from the two’s tips, his hand stroked their penises together even faster than before, wishing to milk as many adorable wails and shakes from the boy beneath him as possible. Sadly, when he felt that immense pressure welling up within him, he knew he had to release it.

And where better to do so - the blondie thought - than on Sunny’s beautiful, perfect body? Where better to leave a white mark of warmth and zeal, one that would seal their love?

Finally, Basil threw his head back and closed his eyes, unleashing a loud, almost animalistic moan which was soon after accompanied by Sunny’s own. In the blink of an eye, the two boys released their warm seed, which mixed together and landed on the bare frame of the boy on the bottom. Neither of the two had ever ejaculated so much before.

The boys were left gasping for breath, their eyes half-shut and their bodies still twitching, awaiting something more. 

Basil removed his cum-stained hand from his crotch. It caressed Sunny’s penis one last time as it slid away from the two bodies, instead meeting the dark-haired boy’s own hand and locking with it again.

He slowly lowered his body onto Sunny’s, with some of the cum sticking to his chest. That wide grin of his remained onto his face as he looked at the smaller boy lovingly, fiddling with his hair with his index finger.

His eyes wandered back to Sunny's dick, still erect and shaking in the darkness. He could feel that wide red blush of his returning.

“Y-You're still… What, you want to go again?" he breathed out, laughing and forcing the other boy to blush too. It was a question that Sunny simply couldn’t answer with his words. Instead, it was his body that did the talking. And the blondie could tell that his friend desperately, desperately wanted more.

But, well, so did he. Arguably even more so. This intimate moment between them was the perfect chance for Basil to show the dark-haired boy just how much he mattered to him; a certainly mutual feeling.

Neither of them wanted this moment to ever end. It was like some of their wildest, most carnal dreams had become reality. And finally, they didn’t have to dream anymore. Within each other's arms, for once, they felt protected. They felt free. They felt brave, they felt…

Loved.
