#The Great Bulk Character and Lore Guide

##The Good:

#####Makuhita's Team (Unnamed)
"Makuhita", AKA "Makky":
Sex: Male
Ability: Thick Fat
A strange Pokemon who woke up in the middle of the Thirsty Desert, with no supplies to him. He is rather evasive about his origins, claiming he lost all of his memory in a concussion, but he keeps changing the story every time Asana brings it up.  He has a loud and energetic personality, which makes him both many friends and enemies. Beneath his exterior, however, lies a stubborn, determined, and reckless core. He has an extreme level of pain tolerance and durability, fighting through injuries and agony that lesser Pokemon would wilt under.

Some Pokemon, Asana especially, might think he's an idiot due to his loud, reckless demeanour, but he sometimes shows that there's a bit more to him than meets the eye. He's particularly good at agitating his partner into doing things, usually by mildly insulting her and calling her “Assy”; a nickname she loathes.

Makuhita is a slow, yet sturdy brawler, usually goading his opponents to attack while Asana picks them apart. His body is highly resilient against blunt-force attacks such as punches and kicks. However, not only is his head less protected, but he can still be stabbed or cut open. He also struggles against speedier opponents, and his defenses are not as strong against those who utilize special attack. For example, if Asana hit him with a few bolts of Confusion, she could beat him very easily.

Moveset:
Arm Thrust
Tackle

Asana (Meditite):
Sex: Female
Ability: Pure Power
A harsh and haughty, yet competitive and driven Meditite who is an Aura Sensor. She has a remarkable sensing range for someone as inexperienced and unskilled as herself, but she has trouble discerning the subtleties of aura, such as colors beyond a Pokemon's primary one, and the movement of it through their bodies. She had a desire to focus on her aura mastery and skill in fighting full-time, but due to needing to pay her bills, she was shackled with caravan guard duty, a job she hated. She only quit and moved to the bounty hunting business at Makuhita's urging, and is taking quickly to it.

Her relationship with Makuhita started as being tense, bordering on outright antagonistic, due to how their personalities conflicted. She saw him as a boorish, oafish dolt who almost ate her out of house and home and regarded his attempts at concealing his origin with suspicion, but she is slowly warming up to him. Even if he annoys her sometimes, she is able to recognize Makuhita's faithfulness as an ally, and even though she doesn't want to admit it, has a small degree of respect for him.

She has a very low opinion of outlaws and criminals, deeming them all to be parasites who refuse to work or provide for themselves. Her fighting style is a skilled mixture of both psychic and physical combat, but she relies on avoiding hits, rather than tanking them. She has a habit of underestimating her opponents which cost her an eye against the first outlaw she helped turn in, and nearly resulted in her death. She can dish out tons of damage, but she can't take it in return.

Moveset:
Brick Break
Confusion
Detect

Aura Abilities:
Basic Long-Ranged Sensing (Can sense for quite a long distance, but cannot read the more intricate details of auras)

She has also been training Aura Expression for a long time, and had no luck with it, due to her training methods. Meditation was good for developing her Sensing, but as part of Expression requires movement, that on top of her lack of connection to herself meant she made zero progress before meeting Makuhita. She achieved it for the first time in [Basic Training](https://rentry.org/GreatBulkInter1) in the middle of a match with her partner, in a fit of anger where her pride as a fighter felt threatened.

##The Bad:
#####Team Verdant:
"Cacturne the Unbreakable":
Bounty: 10,000 Poke
Rank: ★
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault
Sex: Male
Ability: ???
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho, and has scars all over his body. He speaks in an accent typical of the Saguaro Tribe, a nomadic group of Cacturne native to the Thirsty Desert.

An infamous caravan bandit from the most inhospitable parts of Thirsty Desert with a long career that has spanned over a decade and a half. He's known for his cunning and love of dirty battle tactics, as well as surviving events that less hardy Pokemon could not. He has been reported captured or killed on at least seven seperate occasions, but he always finds a way of surviving or escaping custody.

Lombre:

Rank: ~~B~~ A
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault, Fraud
Sex: Male
Ability: ???
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho. Speaks in a slow, tired voice, and has a distinctive scar running down most of his left arm.

Getting his start as a conman, this Pokemon has only partnered up with Cacturne in the past year, and has quickly become a danger in of himself. He usually hangs back and fires Water-type attacks from afar, providing support to his partner in crime. His accuracy is exceptional, and he has bailed Cacturne out of trouble out numerous times.

Moveset:
Water Gun

#####Independents:
~~"Iron Wing" (Hawlucha)~~:
Bounty: ~~300~~ 1,500 Poke
Rank: ~~E~~ C
Wanted For: Assault, Theft, Caravan Robbery
Sex: Male
Ability: Limber
Distinctive Features: None

Originally nothing more than a petty crook, this bird of prey started climbing the ranks with the help of an accomplice - his "manager", Nickel. With their insight and tactical knowledge, he graduated from picking pockets to engaging in the competitive "industry" of caravan robbing. The sheer frequency and increasing effeciency of his attacks sparked discussion of moving him straight to A Rank, before Makuhita and Asana captured him, and his partner abandoned him.

Moveset:
Flying Press
Stone Edge
Wing Attack
Aerial Ace

Nickel (Roaming Gimmighoul):
Bounty: 1,000 Poke
Rank: D
Wanted For: Conspiracy to commit assault, theft, and robbery
Sex: N/A
Ability: Run Away
Distinctive Features: Wears a pair of teashade glasses, tinted silver. Tends to hide in the storage of his "talent", such as in backpacks, bags, etc.
This outlaw may seem dimunitive and harmless, but do not be fooled. He is a cunning manipulator with a high degree of battle acumen and intellect, "managing" other outlaws and coaching them in combat. He bounces around from accomplice to accomplice as they succumb to injury or capture, his dimunitive size allowing him to escape with ease. He has a higher bounty than other outlaws of his rank, due to both his role as a mastermind, and his numerous escapes.

Moveset:
Irrelevant.
##The Others:
Jolteon:
Sex: Female
Ability: Volt Absorb
A novice caravan guard with a bit of a cowardly streak who works with her best friend, Mawile. She's a bit of an airhead, and after witnessing Makuhita's victory over Iron Wing, she fawned over him for a while. She took him on a date to The Saloon, a pub in Sahra Town, but her bubble was burst when she found out that he didn't even know it was one, and that she wasn't his type.



##Geography:
###Sand Continent:
#####The Midlands:
The Midlands are, as the name implies, the region comprising the middle of the Sand Continent. The conditions are far more hospitable here then in the North and South, and thus, much crops and produce is grown here, to be exported to the more extreme regions.
######Oasis:
A town near the Mystery Dungeon Holey Meadow. They're one of the agricultural towns in the Midlands that export their goods to the rest of the Sand Continent.

#####The North:
The North is, like much of the Sand Continent, rather mountainous, and is marked by the Thirsty Desert and its corresponding Mystery Dungeon, with the same name, at its southern border. The Thirsty Desert is the most inhospitable spot on the whole continent, its only permanent residents being hardy tribespeople and survivalists. Nonetheless, travellers and traders alike must pass through it in order to it to get to and from the region.

#####The South:
The South is split into two sub-regions, the Southeast and the Southwest. The Southwest, unlike the rest of the Sand Continent, is rather frigid. Notable Mystery Dungeons include the Hall of Magic and Snowy Cave. The Southeast is primarily made up of deserts, mountains, and coastline, and is where Sahra Town is located.


##Miscellaneous Notes and Lore Tidbits
The outlaw ranking system used on the Sand Continent is similar to the mission difficulty rankings in Explorers missions, with the ratings beyond five stars trimmed out, as I found them redundant. From lowest to highest, the ranks are:
E, D, C, B, A, S, ★ (One Star), ★★ (Two Stars), ★★★ (Three Stars), ★★★★ (Four Stars), ★★★★★ (Five Stars)

E, D, C, and B are primarily used for criminals such as your typical petty crooks, muggers, and conmen. A-Ranked outlaws are a dangerous threat to the average civilian, but can be dealt with by most exploration and bounty hunter teams who know what they are doing. S-Ranked outlaws could easily defeat nearly any civilian, and your average team would have to prepare heavily to prevail.

The Star rankings are where things become far more dangerous. It's advised that only seasoned teams go after even One-Star outlaws, and things only become dicier as the number of stars go up. Five-Star outlaws are living legends; pillars of villainy that come only once every generation. It would take a large group of skilled fighters to take them down, whether due to raw strength, or the influence they possess among their fellow criminals.
