#The Great Bulk Character and Lore Guide

##The Good:

#####Team Yin-Yang
"Makuhita", AKA "Makky":
Sex: Male
Ability: Thick Fat
A strange Pokemon who woke up in the middle of the Thirsty Desert, with no supplies to him. He is rather evasive about his origins. He claims to have lost his memory in a concussion, the circumstances of which changing with each retelling, and that he is from the Mist Continent. He has a loud and energetic personality, which makes him both many friends and enemies. Beneath his exterior, however, lies a stubborn, determined, and reckless core. He has an extreme level of pain tolerance and durability, fighting through injuries and agony that lesser Pokemon would wilt under.

Some Pokemon might think he's an idiot due to his loud, reckless demeanour, but there's more going on inside his head than most pick up on. He's capable of being philosophical at times, such as the endings of Parts 2 and 4, and when he's pushed, he can come up with solid tactics, such as in the fight with [Foi](https://rentry.org/GreatBulk4).

Makuhita is a slow, yet sturdy brawler whose style is slowly developing into one featuring grappling and throws. His body is highly resilient against blunt-force attacks such as punches and kicks. However, not only is his head less protected, but he can still be stabbed or cut open. He also struggles against speedier opponents, and his defenses are not as strong against those who utilize non-physical attacks. For example, if Asana hit him with a few bolts of Confusion, she could beat him very easily.

He also struggles against speedy opponents, [Hitmontop](https://rentry.org/GreatBulk2) being a good example of this. Force Palm can help against them, but only partially.

He is currently attempting to learn how to sense Aura, although his overly active mind is a great detriment to it. He only managed the feat once, and even then, its range was only an arm's length away from himself.

Moveset:
Arm Thrust
Tackle
Force Palm

Asana (Meditite):
Sex: Female
Ability: Pure Power
Held Item: Power Band (worn around the neck)
A harsh and haughty, yet competitive and driven Meditite who is a gifted Aura Sensor. She had a desire to focus on her aura mastery and skill in fighting full-time, but due to needing to pay her bills, she was shackled with caravan guard duty, a job she hated. She only quit and moved to the bounty hunting business at Makuhita's urging, and is taking quickly to it.

Her relationship with Makuhita started as being tense, bordering on outright antagonistic, due to how their personalities conflicted. She saw him as a boorish, oafish dolt who almost ate her out of house and home and regarded his attempts at concealing his origin with suspicion, but she slowly warmed up to him. Nowadays, he's almost like a brother in her eyes.

Due to being a Sensor at birth, she grew up with a sense of pride and superiority to others around her. However, due to the realities of adult life, she had to take caravan work to make ends meet, and there, her pride morphed into arrogance. It's only due to Makuhita that it's slowly beginning to melt away, but a part of her doesn't want to leave it behind - her arrogance was her shield against the world around her, and without it, she'd feel defenseless. However, thanks to her time in Redkiln, she's slowly learning to lower her guard around others, and even made a couple of friends there.

Her fighting style is a skilled mixture of both psychic and physical combat. She can dish out tons of damage, but she can't take it in return.

Moveset:
Brick Break
Confusion
Detect
Psybeam

Aura Abilities:
Long-Ranged Sensing (Can sense for quite a long distance. She started out being unable to sense the more intricate details of Auras, but has overcome this issue as of Part 3.)

Crude Expression (Can aura-boost limbs and moves, although the latter tires her out greatly)

##The Bad:
#####Team Verdant:
"Cacturne the Unbreakable":
Bounty: 30,000 Poke
Rank: ★
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault
Sex: Male
Ability: ???
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho, and has scars all over his body. He speaks in an accent typical of the Saguaro Tribe, a nomadic group of Cacturne native to the Thirsty Desert.

An infamous caravan bandit from the most inhospitable parts of Thirsty Desert with a long career that has spanned over a decade and a half. He's known for his cunning and love of dirty battle tactics, as well as surviving events that less hardy Pokemon could not. He has been reported captured or killed on at least seven seperate occasions, but he always finds a way of surviving or escaping custody.

Moveset:
Pin Missile
Bullet Seed
Sucker Punch
Needle Arm

Lombre:
Bounty: ~~3,500~~ ~~5,000~~ 7,000 Poke
Rank: ~~B~~ ~~A~~ S
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault, Fraud
Sex: Male
Ability: ???
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho. Speaks in a slow, tired voice, and has a distinctive scar running down most of his left arm. He's also lankier and a bit taller than most of his species, giving him a distinct, reedy-looking appearance.

Getting his start as a conman, this Pokemon has only partnered up with Cacturne in the past year, and has quickly become a danger in of himself. He started out as a support, sniping troublesome targets from the rear, although reports indicate that he's recently become a lot more active and aggressive in battling. 

Moveset:
Water Gun
???
???
???

#####The Flock:
Foi (Galarian Farfetch'd):
Bounty: ~~4,000~~ 6,000 Poke, plus 1,000 for each accomplice brought in
Rank: ~~A~~ S
Wanted For: Extortion, Theft, Assault, Caravan Robbery
Sex: Male
Ability: Steadfast
Distinctive Features: Plumage is darker than normal. The leek he wields is longer than his own body, and he wears a necklace of smaller stalks taken from his rivals.

This Pokemon was the leader of a gang of Flying-types known colloquially as “The Flock”, totalling five individuals. Their usual M.O was to force caravans on southern routes to pay a toll for “protection”. Those that pay were protected from any lesser robbers, but those that didn't were promptly assaulted and frisked for all their valuables. He's also known for his peculiar habit of wearing a necklace of leeks taken from rival Farfetch'd; praying and asking for them to lend their strength to him each time he enters a battle.

Foi is an anomaly among his species not only due to his different physical features, but his prowess in combat. His oversized leek was able to send lighter combatants flying with a single swing, and if Makuhita didn't work with Mawile to disarm him, he would have won against them both, in spite of the damage Jolteon inflicted on him before that fight.

Even after he was disarmed, however, he ripped off two leeks from his necklace and continued fighting, making quick work of the latter and fighting the former, a Pokemon with durability as his strongest trait, to a draw.

Moveset:
Brave Bird
Leaf Blade
Close Combat
Brutal Swing (Unseen in story)

Knuckle and Sandwich (Doduo):
The two heads comprising this Doduo fight amongst themselves constantly when not in battle, and their nicknames result from an incident surrounding this – Foi threatened to give them a knuckle sandwich if they didn't stop trying to maim each other, and he followed through on his threat. They possess a great degree of speed that they could amplify even further with Agility, which forced Asana on the defensive.

Pidgeotto:
He wasn't featured much, but he finds Knuckle and Sandwich's antics amusing. Makuhita defeated him in a surprising showing of technique, using an Arm Thrust to disable his wing and then rain attacks on him while he was open.

Swellow:
He's a masochist who revels in the pain battles inflict upon him, growing stronger the more he hurts due to both that and his ability, Guts. He was able to outmatch Asana easily, but like a fool, he left himself wide open to gloat. This was promptly exploited, leading to his downfall.

Staravia:
She's the only girl in the gang. Not much is known about her, but Makky and Mawile worked together to defeat her.

#####Independent Outlaws:
~~"Iron Wing" (Hawlucha)~~:
Bounty: ~~300~~ 1,500 Poke
Rank: ~~E~~ C
Wanted For: Assault, Theft, Caravan Robbery
Sex: Male
Ability: Limber
Distinctive Features: None

Originally nothing more than a petty crook, this bird of prey started climbing the ranks with the help of an accomplice - his "manager", Nickel. With their insight and tactical knowledge, he graduated from picking pockets to engaging in the competitive "industry" of caravan robbing. The sheer frequency and increasing effeciency of his attacks sparked discussion of moving him straight to A Rank, before Makuhita and Asana captured him, and his partner abandoned him.

Moveset:
Flying Press
Stone Edge
Wing Attack
Aerial Ace

Nickel (Roaming Gimmighoul):
Bounty: 1,000 Poke
Rank: D
Wanted For: Conspiracy to commit assault, theft, and robbery
Sex: N/A
Ability: Run Away
Distinctive Features: Wears a pair of teashade glasses, tinted silver. Tends to hide in the storage of his "talent", such as in backpacks, bags, etc.
This outlaw may seem dimunitive and harmless, but do not be fooled. He is a cunning manipulator with a high degree of battle acumen and intellect, "managing" other outlaws and coaching them in combat. He bounces around from accomplice to accomplice as they succumb to injury or capture, his dimunitive size allowing him to escape with ease. He has a higher bounty than other outlaws of his rank, due to both his role as a mastermind, and his numerous escapes.

Rumors state that he has left the Sand Continent, although if they're true, his ultimate destination is unknown.

Moveset:
Irrelevant.

~~Thievul the Shadow~~:
Bounty: 8,000 Poke
Wanted For: Breaking and Entering, Theft
Rank: A
Sex: Male
Ability: Run Away
Distinctive Features: None
Held Item: ~~Sneak Scarf~~ Ripped off by Asana.
Thievul may not be a rough fighter who can survive anything like Cacturne, but his stealth and ability to make clean getaways have resulted in a career even longer than his. For 23 years, Thievul has been stealing from rich and affluent Pokemon. He takes great care to remain hidden, even concealing his scent, and only leaves one article of evidence behind to show his mark - a card with his pawprint on it. Due to the sheer length of his career, his bounty is much higher than others around his Rank.

He was only captured through the efforts of Asana and her skill at sensing Aura - what she saw was a slightly timid thief who, in spite of his poor battling skills, was unpredictable in a fight, owing to a bag of items and tricks. 

~~Hitmontop~~:
Bounty: 3,500 Poke:
Rank: A
Wanted For: Assault, Theft
Sex: Male
Ability: Technician
Distinctive Features: Wore a Power Band around his mouth.
Held Item: ~~Power Band~~ Given to Asana.

A stylish outlaw who used a mixture of skill and flashiness to attack numerous exploration and outlaw hunting teams as both a means of thrill-seeking and gaining notoriety. He gave Makky his first loss, although Asana beat him thanks to a combination of her Aura Sensing skills and preparedness. Due to Asana unintentionally reminding him of his mortality and some words from Makky, he might change his ways once he's done serving his time.

Moveset:
Rolling Kick
Triple Kick
Double Team

##The Others:

#####Team Watchers:
Espathra:
Sex: Female
Ability: Speed Boost
She's a blind Sensor, and the team's leader. Her role was primarily to find hidden passages and details others would miss, via using her ability to detect changes in the environment. Her philosophy behind Aura is different compared to others due to her not being a fighter, focusing more on finding hidden meanings and revealing that which is concealed. She's quite old, being 87 years of age as of Part 3.

Indeedee:
Sex: Male
Ability: Psychic Surge
Espathra's husband. His role was in reading and navigation, since his wife is blind, alongside boosting the damage of Hatterene's moves. He's very concerned with etiquette, and is implied to get violent with those who breach it.

Hatterene:
Sex: Female
Ability: ???
The third member of Team Watchers, who never retired in spite of her advanced age. She was mentioned as being introverted, although very kindly to those she opened up to. She was the team's main battler.

#####Independents and Civilians:
Jolteon:
Sex: Female
Ability: Volt Absorb
A novice caravan guard with a bit of a cowardly streak who works with her best friend, Mawile. She's a bit of an airhead, and after witnessing Makuhita's victory over Iron Wing, she fawned over him for a while. She took him on a date to The Saloon, a pub in Sahra Town, but her bubble was burst when she found out that he didn't even know it was one, and that she wasn't his type.

After the incident with Iron Wing, she got chewed out by Mawile and became far better at her job, giving even an S-Rank outlaw some trouble.

Mawile:
Sex: Female:
Ability: Hyper Cutter
A caravan guard who works with Jolteon, Houndoom, and Rhydon. She's a bit arrogant like Asana started out being, although she's more sarcastic, many of her words being veiled insults or back-handed compliments. 

Rhydon:
Sex: Male:
Ability: ???
Works with Jolteon, Mawile, and Houndoom. Not much is revealed about him.

Houndoom:
Sex: Male
Ability: Flash Fire
The guard Captain of the caravan that Mawile, Rhydon, and Jolteon all work at. His reputation has suffered a hit lately, between Iron Wing besting his men and murdering one, and Foi squeezing his company for much of what they have.

Polteageist:
Sex: N/A
Ability: Cursed Body
He's a potter from Redkiln who was, at one point, a perfectionist. The pot he lives in is noticably shoddier than others of his kind - he was tricked by a green, lanky stranger into buying a counterfeit to evolve into, 20 years before the events of Part 3. He also describes himself as one of the few Pokemon on the Sand Continent who can make good porcelain.

Sonora, aka "Merry" (Maractus):
Sex: Female
Ability: Water Absorb
An ex-outlaw living in Redkiln wearing a worn poncho, with numerous scars across her body. She ran with her ex-husband for a long time, leaving both him and the criminal business behind due to her aversion to bloodshed. She's a naturally cheery Pokemon, although she's weighed down by her past actions, and the regret that she could never convince her ex to change his ways with her. She's still very attached to him, keeping a Gold Ribbon he gave her as an unofficial signifier of their marriage. She possesses as many aliases as there are stars in the sky – “Sonora” is simply the name the residents of Redkiln know her by, and “Merry” is a nickname her ex gave her.

Mienfoo, aka the Sourdough Supremacist:
Sex: Male
Ability: Reckless
A baker from Redkiln known for his constantly shifting mood, passion for his work, and insistence that sourdough is the superior form of bread. His family has been baking for generations, and the sourdough starter he nutures is old as, if not older than Redkiln itself. He views baker's yeast as "soulless" and has a particular disdain for bread leavened with the assistance of Fidough breath, hating it for being, in his eyes, unsanitary.


##Geography:
###Sand Continent:
#####The Midlands:
The Midlands are, as the name implies, the region comprising the middle of the Sand Continent. The conditions are far more hospitable here then in the North and South, and thus, much crops and produce is grown here, to be exported to the more extreme regions.
######Oasis:
A town west of the Mystery Dungeon Holey Meadow. They're one of the agricultural towns in the Midlands that export their goods to the rest of the Sand Continent.

######Redkiln:
Another town near Holey Meadow, located to its Northeast. It's known in particular for its ceramics, pottery in particular.

#####The North:
The North is, like much of the Sand Continent, rather mountainous, and is marked by the Thirsty Desert and its corresponding Mystery Dungeon, with the same name, at its southern border. The Thirsty Desert is the most inhospitable spot on the whole continent, its only permanent residents being hardy tribespeople and survivalists. Nonetheless, travellers and traders alike must pass through it in order to it to get to and from the region.

#####The South:
The South is split into two sub-regions, the Southeast and the Southwest. The Southwest, unlike the rest of the Sand Continent, is rather frigid. Notable Mystery Dungeons include the Hall of Magic and Snowy Cave. The Southeast is primarily made up of deserts, mountains, and coastline, and is where Sahra Town is located.
######Krabby Cave:
A small Mystery Dungeon to the south of Sahra Town. As the name implies, its entrance is in the shape of a Krabby. It's rather small, and mostly home to Water-types. Hitmontop used to use the bottom of this dungeon as a hideout.


##Miscellaneous Notes and Lore Tidbits
The outlaw ranking system used on the Sand Continent is similar to the mission difficulty rankings in Explorers missions, with the ratings beyond five stars trimmed out, as I found them redundant. From lowest to highest, the ranks are:
E, D, C, B, A, S, ★ (One Star), ★★ (Two Stars), ★★★ (Three Stars), ★★★★ (Four Stars), ★★★★★ (Five Stars)

E, D, C, and B are primarily used for criminals such as your typical petty crooks, muggers, and conmen. A-Ranked outlaws are a dangerous threat to the average civilian, but can be dealt with by most exploration and bounty hunter teams who know what they are doing. S-Ranked outlaws could easily defeat nearly any civilian, and your average team would have to prepare heavily to prevail.

The Star rankings are where things become far more dangerous. It's advised that only seasoned teams go after even One-Star outlaws, and things only become dicier as the number of stars go up. Five-Star outlaws are living legends; pillars of villainy that come only once every generation. It would take a large group of skilled fighters to take them down, whether due to raw strength, or the influence they possess among their fellow criminals.
