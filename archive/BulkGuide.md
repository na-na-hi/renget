#The Great Bulk Character and Lore Guide

##The Good:

#####Makuhita's Team (Unnamed)
"Makuhita", AKA "Makky":
Sex: Male
A strange Pokemon who woke up in the middle of the Thirsty Desert, with no supplies to him. He is rather evasive about his origins, claiming he lost all of his memory in a concussion, but he keeps changing the story every time Asana brings it up.  He has a loud and energetic personality, which makes him both many friends and enemies. Beneath his exterior, however, lies a stubborn, determined, and reckless core. He has an extreme level of pain tolerance and durability, fighting through injuries and agony that lesser Pokemon would wilt under.

Makuhita is a slow, yet sturdy brawler, usually goading his opponents to attack while Asana picks them apart. 
Moveset:
Arm Thrust

Asana (Meditite):
Sex: Female
A harsh, haughty Meditite who is an Aura Sensor. She has a remarkable sensing range for someone as inexperienced and unskilled as herself, but she has trouble discerning the subtleties of aura, such as colors beyond a Pokemon's primary one, and the movement of it through their bodies. She had a desire to focus on her aura mastery and skill in fighting full-time, but due to needing to pay her bills, she was shackled with caravan guard duty, a job she hated. She only quit and moved to the bounty hunting business at Makuhita's urging, and is taking quickly to it.

She has a rather tense relationship with her partner. On one hand, she finds him boorish, oafish, has issue with how much he eats, and regards his attempts at concealing his origins with suspicion. On the other hand, she recognizes that he's a faithful ally, and respects his drive and the fact that he pushed her to follow her desires.

She has a very low opinion of outlaws and criminals, deeming them all to be parasites who refuse to work or provide for themselves. Her fighting style is a skilled mixture of both psychic and physical combat, but she relies on avoiding hits, rather than tanking them. She has a habit of underestimating her opponents, which cost her an eye against the first outlaw she helped turn in, and nearly resulted in her death.
Moveset:
Brick Break
Confusion
Detect

Aura Abilities:
Basic Long-Ranged Sensing (Can sense for quite a long distance, but cannot read the more intricate details of auras)

##The Bad:
#####Team Verdant:
"Cacturne the Unbreakable":
Bounty: 10,000 Poke
Rank: ★
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault
Sex: Male
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho, and has scars all over his body. He speaks in an accent typical of the Saguaro Tribe, a nomadic group of Cacturne native to the Thirsty Desert.

An infamous caravan bandit from the most inhospitable parts of Thirsty Desert with a long career that has spanned over a decade and a half. He's known for his cunning and love of dirty battle tactics, as well as surviving events that less hardy Pokemon could not. He has been reported captured or killed on at least seven seperate occasions, but he always finds a way of surviving or escaping custody.

Moveset:
Pin Missile
Bullet Seed
Sucker Punch
Needle Arm

Lombre:
Bounty: ~~3,500~~ 5,000 Poke
Rank: ~~B~~ A
Wanted for: Murder, Caravan Robbery, Assault, Fraud
Sex: Male
Distinctive Features: Wears a worn, brown poncho. Speaks in a slow, tired voice, and has a distinctive scar running down most of his left arm.

Getting his start as a conman, this Pokemon has only partnered up with Cacturne in the past year, and has quickly become a danger in of himself. He usually hangs back and fires Water-type attacks from afar, providing support to his partner in crime. His accuracy is exceptional, and he has bailed Cacturne out of trouble out numerous times.

Moveset:
Water Gun

#####Independents:
~~"Iron Wing" (Hawlucha)~~:
Bounty: ~~300~~ 1,500 Poke
Rank: ~~E~~ C
Wanted For: Assault, Theft, Caravan Robbery
Sex: Male
Distinctive Features: None

Originally nothing more than a petty crook, this bird of prey started climbing the ranks with the help of an accomplice - his "manager", Nickel. With their insight and tactical knowledge, he graduated from picking pockets to engaging in the competitive "industry" of caravan robbing. The sheer frequency and increasing efficiency of his attacks sparked discussion of moving him straight to A Rank, before Makuhita and Asana captured him, and his partner abandoned him.

Moveset:
Flying Press
Stone Edge
Wing Attack
Aerial Ace

Nickel (Roaming Gimmighoul):
Bounty: 1,000 Poke
Rank: D
Wanted For: Conspiracy to commit assault, theft, and robbery
Sex: N/A
Distinctive Features: Wears a pair of teashade glasses, tinted silver. Tends to hide in the storage of his "talent", such as in backpacks, bags, etc.
This outlaw may seem dimunitive and harmless, but do not be fooled. He is a cunning manipulator with a high degree of battle acumen and intellect, "managing" other outlaws and coaching them in combat. He bounces around from accomplice to accomplice as they succumb to injury or capture, his dimunitive size allowing him to escape with ease. He has a higher bounty than other outlaws of his rank, due to both his role as a mastermind, and his numerous escapes.

Moveset:
Irrelevant.
##The Others:
Jolteon:
Sex: Female
A novice caravan guard with a bit of a cowardly streak who works with her best friend, Mawile. She's a bit of an airhead, and after witnessing Makuhita's victory over Iron Wing, fawns over him, to the displeasure of Asana. However, he seems to be ignorant of Jolteon's romantic feelings towards him.



##Geography:
###Sand Continent:
#####The Midlands:
The Midlands are, as the name implies, the region comprising the middle of the Sand Continent. The conditions are far more hospitable here then in the North and South, and thus, much crops and produce is grown here, to be exported to the more extreme regions.
######Oasis:
A town near the Mystery Dungeon Holey Meadow. They're one of the agricultural towns in the Midlands that export their goods to the rest of the Sand Continent.

#####The North:
The North is, like much of the Sand Continent, rather mountainous, and is marked by the Thirsty Desert and its corresponding Mystery Dungeon, with the same name, at its southern border. The Thirsty Desert is the most inhospitable spot on the whole continent, its only permanent residents being hardy tribespeople and survivalists. Nonetheless, travellers and traders alike must pass through it in order to it to get to and from the region.

#####The South:
The South is split into two sub-regions, the Southeast and the Southwest. The Southwest, unlike the rest of the Sand Continent, is rather frigid. Notable Mystery Dungeons include the Hall of Magic and Snowy Cave. The Southeast is primarily made up of deserts, mountains, and coastline, and is where Sahra Town is located.


##Miscellaneous Notes and Lore Tidbits
The outlaw ranking system used on the Sand Continent is similar to the mission difficulty rankings in Explorers missions, with the ratings beyond five stars trimmed out, as I found them redundant. From lowest to highest, the ranks are:
E, D, C, B, A, S, ★ (One Star), ★★ (Two Stars), ★★★ (Three Stars), ★★★★ (Four Stars), ★★★★★ (Five Stars)

E, D, C, and B are primarily used for criminals such as your typical petty crooks, muggers, and conmen. A-Ranked outlaws are a dangerous threat to the average civilian, but can be dealt with by most exploration and bounty hunter teams who know what they are doing. S-Ranked outlaws could easily defeat nearly any civilian, and your average team would have to prepare heavily to prevail.

The Star rankings are where things become far more dangerous. It's advised that only seasoned teams go after even One-Star outlaws, and things only become dicier as the number of stars go up. Five-Star outlaws are living legends; pillars of villainy that come only once every generation. It would take a large group of skilled fighters to take them down, whether due to raw strength, or the influence they possess among their fellow criminals.
