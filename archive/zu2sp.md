You were sitting in a chair with your mind in a haze while you only felt a numbness from the tip of your fingers down to the end of your toes. Your eyes were only opened slightly, just to see a table with a full plate of raw wasabi on top of it and directly placed in front of you. Everytime you try to move around a wave of achiness stops you in your tracks. After a while you stopped and only sat there, a sense of emptiness filling as you try and search your mind to figure out how you got there.

But then you heard a door slowly creek open and the sound of a footsteps slowly approaching.

“Ah, dear! I’m glad you didn’t fall over… that means you would’ve missed supper…” spoked a familiar voice as a familiar pair of wolf ears came into your side view. The memories came back. It was Mio, the one person in your life. She took care of everything for you. Everyday.

“Mio...momma…” you barely whisper as you feel her chest press against your back. You feel her hand reach around your face and direct it upwards. There you see them. Those orange eyes that are always there for you. A smile was across her face as she pressed her lips against yours but quickly pulled away and let your head fall back into place.

“You’ve been a good boy… tonight momma will treat you to something special...:”

She walked around and grabbed a spoon and scooped up a swath of wasabi. The spoonful of wasabi was pushed in front of your mouth, Mio waiting there almost expectantly as you slowly opened your lips, knowing what would happen if you didn't accept it.

The burning sensation of lava filled your mouth as the wasabi overwhelmed your senses. You felt your body begin to heat up, sweat began pooling and tears began to fall. You tried to swallow to the best of your ability but the sheer pain wouldn’t allow you to. Your body forcefully ejected the wasabi out and you hacked it out all over the table.

Dread filled you as you shakily tilted your head up at Mio, who was only standing there in silence. That warm look she once had was now replaced with an icy visage that sent a chill down your spine.

“You don't… like it? Ah, and here I was… about to treat you to something great but it seems we’ll have to change that attitude of yours…”

She quickly walked over and pulled you off the chair and your body violently crashed against the floor, unable to do anything as she grabbed you by the collar of your shirt and dragged you across the floor. You could only wait as Mio lifted you and propped you on her bed.

“Mio… momma…” you say again but instead of responding, she slaps you across your face and straddles you. The sting hurts as that familiar devilish look fills her eyes and you tremble on the inside.

“Don't worry, dear… momma will take good care you…”

Then the true pain began.

She would take turns, slowly caressing your body and filling you with unbridled pleasure, but just before you can climax she would punch your stomach. Again and again she would repeat these rhythms as your mind began to slowly shut down from the storm of sensations. This torture of pain and pleasure would go on and on for hours.

“Mio… momma…” you pleaded with tears flowing freely down your face and drool pooling at your lips.

“Ah! It seems I might have overdone it… you’ve lasted this long, so momma will let you off easy tonight…”

Mio then presses her breasts against your chest, her tail wrapping around your leg and gives one last touch that sends you over the edge. You finally climax and the pleasure you feel is so overwhelming, enough that you almost black out. As you're in your post-climax clarity, however, Mio knees you in the crotch so hard that all that pleasure evaporates in a second and a horrible pain overtakes you.

She gets off the bed and walks over to the door, stopping just before she opens it and turns to you once more, that look of warmness returning from earlier.

“We’ll do this again tomorrow… make sure you're a good boy and get some rest…”

She then leaves the room and the void of silence only remains. You can only lay there in pain, knowing that the next day will bring the same routine.

You’ll have to live it again.

And again.

And Again.

Your consciousness fades as the comforting sounds of her singing and playing the ukulele in the room next door fills the house and lullabies you to sleep, knowing there wasn't anything you could do.
