Don't Forget, It's In The Treehouse

>Mari was falling, adrenaline pumping though her veins as she fell.

>She hit a side rail, twisted her leg, hit the other side rail, and then-

>She...was sitting in the treehouse?

>She stared at a game of cards (they had just played the week before their recital, having to stop for one reason or another), and some of Hero's cook books.

>She tried to get up... but couldn't.

>She tried to move anything but couldn't.

>She tried to scream, but couldn't.

>She was panicking.

>How did she get up here?  Did she pass out at some point and wake up here?  Was she paralyzed from the fall and wake up here?  Did Sunny really put her up here after paralyzing her?  She screamed, or tried to.

>After what seemed like hours she began to calm down.

>She listened to the leaves of the swaying trees, the chirping of birds.

>She felt the cool autumn air on her skin.

>She smelt the outdoors permeating the gang's humble abode.

>Someone would notice her missing right?  The gang would certainly check up here for her, right?

>It began to get dark, she became scared, she did not want to be up here after dark.

>She tried screaming once again, but nothing came out.

>What if Sunny wasn't the person to bring her up here?

>She felt extremely tired, but she would have to force herself to stay awake.

>And that she did, for two nights and two days, the first night with anxiety filling her senses of the fear someone would come up here and finish doing something horrible to her, the second that something must have happened to her friends and family.

>The third night she gave up, wishing to get a small amount of rest.

>But she couldn't sleep.

>She tried to sleep, but she couldn't sleep.

>She tried to cry, but she couldn't cry.

>She tried to scream, but she couldn't scream.

>To pass the time she mentally practiced her part of her and Sunny's duet, able to hear the notes clearly, along with his blunders.

>Night turned into day, and day into night.

>She was no longer scared, just extremely bored and tired.

>She wishes she could just fall asleep.

>Suddenly, she hears a noise.

>Someone is coming up the step ladder!

>"Sunny!", she tried to scream, but nothing came out.

>Sunny looked around, eyes looking at everything, even peering at Mari for a moment but quickly glancing away.  He was holding something, was he looking for something else?

>"DON'T YOU FUCKING IGNORE ME SUNNY!", she tried to scream.

>But nothing came out.

>He disappeared out of her vision to her left, and then walked back through crying and quickly rushing out of the tree house.  Mari wishes she could cry too.

>She was tired.

>She waited and waited.

>She waited for someone to come to her.

>She waited to die.

>She waited to wake up from this nightmare.

>She waited for something to happen.

>But nothing did, besides an occasional bird flying in and out of the tree house.

>She mastered her part in the duet long ago Sunny even improved, she let her mind wander to other things, of her friends and future.

>It became colder and colder, she was uncomfortably cold.

>She light amounts of snow blow through the doorway towards Hero's cookbooks.

>She sat in the same spot, unable to move.

>Unable to sleep.

>She was tired.

>She no longer saw the tree house anymore, just a waking dream of her friends and her.

>Sometimes they'd go on a picnic, other times they would play in the park.

>Eventually they would become more and more fantastical as she tried to quell her boredom.

>Eventually she became warm once again, and then uncomfortably hot.

>She dreamed for an eternity sitting in the same position, some days being too hot, some being too cold, some being just right.

>Some days she could hear the rain and thunder break up the monotony.

>She could hear a new bird set a roost nearby from it's chirping.  They probably would have a fight with the existing birds or squirrels later.  Birdy birdy birdy birdy bird.

>Sometimes squirrels would pop in but they didn't find her conversations interesting enough to stick around.

>For three days in a row she felt a stream of ants walk across her body.

>It was amazing!  The tickling of their little feet!

>Eventually they had to go home to their castle.

>She sat there for an eternity going on adventures with her friends.

>Some days it was too hot, some days it was too cold.

>One day when climbing a mountain the gang was beset by giants.

>"Oh Mr. Plantegg, you're so dirty...", it stated, cradling her in its arms, gently brushing her face.

>The giant sat her back down, her vision slightly skewed from where it had been before, and the giants put their own photo album together just like she and her friends had done several times during the course of their adventures.

>She asked the giant to take her and her friends with them, but it didn't listen, and quickly rushed down the mountain followed by the rest of the giants.

>Mari and the gang quickly followed suit, turning back around and dodging the craters the giants left before the avalanche crushed them...
