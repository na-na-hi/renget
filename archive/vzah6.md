##### `Cozy Summertime Vibes`
>Summer
>Blazing hot
>No AC, never thought to need it here
>Getting creative with the wifwolf waif to beat the heat
>Well, maybe not creative, but definately changing routine
>Sleeping through the hottest part of the day with the windows open to catch what little breeze there is.
>Can't cuddle without death of a thousand sweats, still have fingers twined together though.
>Get active about six, worst heat of the day abating and still a couple hours of daylight left, just enough time to do what needs doing.
>head out to the stream, hip deep in the cool water
>pole, flies, and a good cast
>not long and theres enough fish for both of you for dinner
>meanwhile your waif has been making a small fire, just enough to cook the fish she knows you're catching
>also perfect for baking the bread that was started in the dutch oven in the morning
>cooking outside keeps the heat out of the comfy little cabin the two of you share
>fire keeps the biting bugs away
>nature provides mushrooms and herbs to go with the fish.
>sure, you could have driven into town, put something in a microwave, but why? When this is available?
>Sun tea has been brewing on the porch
>Perfect non alcoholic mint juleps
>food and drink is done just as the last of the light of the sun is being claimed and the fireflies are challenging the stars
>sure, summer heat sucks, but it isn't all bad
