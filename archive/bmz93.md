I Have No Body, And I Must Fight


Mari was missing her friends in the Afterlife. Sure, it was nice taking to deceased family members and associates, but those people just couldn't replace her friends. She got word from the grapevine one day that you could break through the clouds, and roam around in the realm of the living.

Mari ventured to the clouds, and started ramming. The first few tries were a failure. She increased her speed every time, only to me stopped dead into her tracks.

Eventually, she started far from the cloud barrier, and sped towards it. She picked up speed, more than all her previous attempts. She was getting closer to the barrier, and instead of her previous attempts, she did not brace for impact.

As Mari closed the distance, she broke through the barrier.

It took her all her strength, but she finally did it. She was now roaming in the realm of the living. There was a lot on her mind, with so much to do, but so little time to do it. Her first order of business was checking up on the two most important men in the world to her.

Sunny and Henry. It's been a long 4 years without them; to be seperated any longer would even more tortuous to Mari than it already was. Mari made a bee-line to Hero's house, hoping that Hero is still his strong self.

When she arrived, she darted around the house looking for him. She found Henry, alongside Sunny. Mari was relieved at first to see the two in one place, but she quickly noticed that something wasn't right.

Sunny had an eyepatch. Mari held her tears from flowing out, for now. Sunny looked rather nervous, with Henry talking to him rather sternly. Henry kept rambling on and on about apologizing, before going to the closet.

Henry took out a black wig, a white shirt, black vest, and a skirt. Henry tossed the clothes to Sunny, and told him to put it on.

"Hero, what are you making Sunny do?!" She exclaimed. Once Sunny was done changing, Henry wrapped his arms around Sunny, and spoke into his ear. Mari didn't get to hear what he said, but she knew that it wasn't good.

Henry pushed Sunny onto the bed, and undid his pants.

"No. No no no no no. No no no no no no no!" Sunny exclaims. Mari tries pulling Henry off of Sunny, but she phases through him. She tries moving in between the two. It's not working. Mari tries toppling the lamp, the desk, the trophies.

It's not working.

Sunny's screams of agony make Mari sick to her stomach. How, how could the man she loved for so long do such a thing to her little brother!? Mari clawed, yelled, punched, kicked, and chopped at Henry. Anything to get him to stop, but to no avail.

Mari kept going, and going, and going.

Mari had no body, but she fought.
