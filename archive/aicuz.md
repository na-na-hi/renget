## Counter terrorist otter

>some terrorists have unleashed a de-evolution virus into society
>it's the usual 'humans turn into cavemen' thing, and those are the lucky ones
>others end up as apes
>have a trim otter gf
>brightest little bubble of energy in the world, super loving, super intelligent
>just...y'know, slim and tiny
>she's also part of the counter-terrorist enforcement that shut down these attacks before it got too far, with maybe a hundred afflicted and even a cure in the works for the victims
>world saved thanks to her and her team, and the other cells of the counter-group worldwide
>too bad when it came to disposal, someone accidentally gave her a compromised cleansuit
>which you only discover during a bout of celebratory sex
>her 5ft 1/4 inch self groans and writhes as her muscles balloon under her sleek fur
>and the bed groans
>there's a feral edge to her eyes as she grows so big the bed gives way
>and not just raw size; her tits go from palmable to head-smothering
>her thighs and ass grow from piggy-back ride to that one Squidward pic with the flattened face
>suddenly your tiny gf is now a fifteen foot behemoth filling the whole room
>you do your utmost to soothe the savage beast
>basically you end up being used like a willing dildo
>you pass out several times during your brave and totally consensual pacification of your now dumb-as-rocks gf
>she fucks you until you're both spent, but you manage to grab her phone as she snores so loud the ground quakes
>and, thankfully, you have her contacts on speed-dial
>they're quick to mobilize, contain and attempt to cure your gf
>but it's still experimental
>as evidenced by the fact that, at first, nothing seems to happen
>but when she wakes up, she's lucid and as smart as she ever was
>just, y'know, still fifteen foot tall and a couple of tons heavy of curves and muscle
>the team apologizes
>you put on a brave face at how 'disappointed' you are until they leave
>and snu-snu all over again

>otter gf is shocked to discover the anti-terrorist group now wants her on the front line
>she’s still your geeky gf, even if she can now deadlift a cement truck
>and your admit, you’re a little worried
>she’s never been a fighter
>but she’s been ‘cured’, so she does make a perfect candidate for chasing down any terrorist remnants
>since she *should* be immune to further doses of the de-evolution virus
>so when a group decided to attack nearby, your gf was mobilised
>the terrorist cell didn’t anticipate a 15ft otter and fled
>she kept up with their escape van, but she was a bit too bulky to catch them without serious collateral damage
>so she leapt, her ultra-powerful thighs cratering the street
>she aimed to land in front of it and bring the van to a controlled stop
>instead she crushed the van under her huge weight
>she also got smothered in the terrorist’s anti-evo virus
>her body reacted immediately
>the imperfect cure resisted it, but didn’t make her immune
>as your gf clutched her head and cried out that she couldn’t think straight, a terrorist survivor climbed out and shot at her
>and that was it; the fear of being shot, the anger at the pain, the fight-or-flight response…
>she turned feral again
>and she grew
>and holy shit, did she grow
>her shoulders crashed through the nearby apartment rooftops
>as did her hips
>and her truck-sized tits
>with a roar that shattered the glass of everything in a half-mile radius, she slammed her foot down on the idiot that shot her
>which collapsed the nearby buildings and could be felt the next city over on the Richter scale
>you were called in as backup
>again, your talent for surviving being shoved up your gf’s slit was in high demand
>and another dose of the cure was administered
>it brought her down to size
>mostly
>let’s just hope they refine the cure next time she gets dosed with anti-evo virus
>because your 20ft otter gf now slowly grows when angry
