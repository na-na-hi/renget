###Quinn Chase's relationship chart
***
>Sasha
There’s a giant fucking mutant snake out there somewhere? I’m gonna go fight that. What do you mean ‘she doesn’t eat living people’? Wait, she? Oh, that’s even better. This’ll be fun!

>Ramses
Oh yeah, I’ve heard of that fucker. Maybe if he and his band of freaks swing down this way, I can go pay him a visit. Nah, I’m not scared. Why would I be? If he takes over and starts killing us pure humans, that just means I get to practise my stealth, Vietnam style!

>Nikto
Him? Yeah I’ve met the guy. Tried to fight him, but he was so uninterested I just lost the desire. He’s good in my books. My boys stay away from him or they suffer the consequences.

>H0P3
Eh. She can be useful if I want something in particular, on occasion. Not much else to say. 

>Dr. Crane
Doctors get a pass. He won’t fight anyways, and everybody needs patching up in this place. He doesn’t seem to like me, and to be honest? I don’t blame him.

>Sage
Oh man, have you seen her? I get tingles just thinking about throwing down. She’s apparently not a mutant but an artificial life form, too. That just kinda makes it hotter. She doesn’t seem like she’d enjoy it, though. That’s a shame. Maybe we could have fun in a different way…

>The Nymphs
C’mon. I have some kind of sense. Could be fun to talk to, find out how they view life out here. Wonder if they’d try and kill me first?

>Mike the Driver
Driving out in the desert? I can respect that. Never met the man.

>Ricky W. Booth
He’s a courier, right? Takes balls, for sure. I don’t really need deliveries often though. Wait. Wait. That guy? Ah, man, I remember him now. He was the guy tripping balls. Heh, he really didn’t wanna fight. My boys stay away from him. He earned that much.

>Kara
The cook! She makes good food. No, like, seriously good food. I’ve visited her place a few times, it’s worth it every time. It’s a real shame she bats for the other team. Hey, I don’t judge.

>Yuki Kikuchi
She’s fun. Real fun. We’ve had a few encounters, and man she’s a tease, just right. I need to catch her one of these days, and really pin her down. In a fight or in bed? I reckon I could let her decide.

>Ultra Magnus
You’re telling me- hang on, lemme get this straight- there’s a guy out there roaming around in fuck-off huge power armour? Just waiting out there getting into fights? Nah, alright. I’m gonna go find him. Don’t get too complacent without me lads.

>Lockley Aimes
Yknow, it’s funny to me every time I see any kind of aircraft up in the sky. We were led to believe things were far worse out here.

>Heli Matharom
Oh, we’ve met. Trust me, I won’t forget that. What? No, she’s so not into me. I respect her mindset. If she didn’t hate my guts, maybe I’d have the occasional job for her. If my boys cross her, they're literally asking for what they get.

>Amu
You’ve heard of a robot out in the wastes? Yeah, they’re probably fucking everywhere, idiot. They worth fighting? Guarded by something big and mean? No? Get the fuck out then. God, I hate worthless gossips.

>Samson
Damn right I’ve heard of the big guy. A real terror of the wastes. He’d rip me to shreds! Oh man would he. I’m shaking in excitement just thinking about it, though. Think I could catch him unarmed… nah no chance, but what if?

>Nick
This guy! THIS GUY! I WANNA FIGHT HIM SO BAD! He’s perfect, absolutely perfect. Skill, power, speed, he has it all. It’s the truest match up, and I just wanna grab him by the throat and beat the shit out of him! We could share a beer after, it’d be a great time.

>Dr. Remilia Rochefort
Doc Remilia, yeah we’ve met, even travelled with her a bit. She’s good looking, I’ll give her that. Cute in an almost endearing way. She doesn’t put out, though. Maybe I should take her out one of these days? I’m sure she knows what she’d be signing up for. Uh, maybe. Fuck, the sheltered ones are the worst.

>Georgia
Some wastelander wandering around with a zoo while pregnant. Not the wisest idea, I reckon.

>Lance
That’s the radio guy, right? I catch him sometimes when I’m out and about. Maybe I should get a radio and tune in more often.

>The Argo and its Crew
I’ve heard of them, travelling about. I don’t particularly care, and my genes are as pure as they come. If they want a taste, they can come get it. Aside from that, I doubt we’d get along on a personal level, sounds like they embody the stiff and haughty attitude I wanted to escape from back home.

>Marcus Cassius Allen
Heh, ‘Killfuck Soulshitter’, really? That’s hilarious. I wanna take him down a peg based on the name alone.

>Calliope
Now, this girl sounds like a real fun time! Reckon we could- fucken’ hell, she bats for the other team? Guess we throw down the other way, then. Decent taste in music, too.

>Isha
I do not believe you. There’s no way a fucking princess is just wandering about. If it is true? Why would I not try and get a piece of that? You’re still fucking with me, though.

>Karnak
There’s another radio guy?

>THE ANT KING
I’ve heard of weirder things. I’ve never fought an ant before. It could be fun? Who knows.

>Hannah Ossus
Yeah, yeah, you saw a mutant chick out in the jungles. News at 11, pal. You think she looked stronger than normal? Alright fine, I’ll bite. Next time I head out that way, I’ll see if I can find her.

>Sunny
Who? Oh, that mutant that’s been raidin’ lately. Yeah, he’s got style, I’ll admit. Rare to find a mutant with taste in clothes that good.

>Alexander S. Luthor.
Ha! There’s actually someone running for fuckin’ PRESIDENT? Oh, that’s rich. Hilarious!

>Magnus Wang
Magnus? Which fucking one? It’s a common as fuck name, apparently.

>Maya Liang
Oh, I totally would. Think I wouldn’t? I ain’t that picky, friend. She’d be more fun to fight, though; doesn’t seem too into the idea of having some harmless fun for a night.

>Lin
I wanna fight her. It makes me hot under the collar thinking about it. Besides, from what I hear, we share a common philosophy. Shame I ain’t looking to settle down, ‘cause I reckon ladies don’t get much more perfect otherwise.

>Chloe
You… want me to fight a kid? Get the fuck out. Don’t come back or I’ll break your spine.

>Phi
Another robot out in the wastes? A clown, this time? Stop pestering me about this stupid bullshit. A robot clown… that fights though? Maybe. I’ll think about heading out that way.

>Billy Kido
The guy wielding an invisible blade? Oh I’ve thought about it. Tried to catch him once or twice, but he moves around a lot. If there’s any truth to the story, I really wanna meet him. I’ve fought blade wielders before, but a high-tech one like that one would have to be? That’s new, and I wanna see how I could do!

>Tuma
Yeah, I know there are mutant fishfolk down there. What does that have to do with me? Well, I guess fighting underwater could be a new challenge.

>Victor
A wandering cowboy bot out in the wastes? That’s just precious. No, I’m not gonna go fight the cowboy. You idiots always come around here and think I fight just anything, huh?! 

>David Wiles
A leader, and a good shot? All the fun is in the approach. If you can’t get close, you die, but if you can…? I’ve been there before, no need to antagonize the guy. No, I’m not going to go have a gang war for his territory. What the fuck would I want it for?

>Dimir Leksirei
More of the fuckin’ same. I don’t hate him, but if I need a doc, he ain’t my first choice. Too similar to home. Besides, I don’t need his ‘upgrades’. Where I’m goin’, I’m takin’ myself all the way. No shortcuts or help needed.
