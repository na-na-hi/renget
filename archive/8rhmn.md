##### `How I Met Your Mother`
>You're a spoop hunter/exorcist/some other job that involves the supernatural
>You're called into to investigate sightings of something huge in the woods eating livestock.
>You find... a large shewolf... One who is easy on the eyes.
>After a few years in the business, you were expecting something much worse.
>As reluctant as you are to hurt this pretty thing, you have a job to do and try to get her to clear out.
>Shewolf is befuddled and somewhat amused with how fearless you are, but her pride demands she not back down.
>Bloody scuffle ensues, with you somehow pinning her and leaving her staring down the barrel of a gun.
>You...Don't pull the trigger and instead let her go, telling her to find a new haunt.
>Maybe being in the business of spoops has skewed your standards, but this shewolf is beautiful in a natural, primal way. You don't want her to die.
>Confused as to why she was allowed to live, the shewolf takes the mercy and leaves.
>Over the next few months, you meet her again and again, and each time, the encounters get less violent.
>She relocates to a national park you know is controlled by a sympathetic beastkin pack, but she still makes trouble here and there and forces you to respond.
>Finally, the meetings stop being violent altogether, and you understand why.
>She finds you just as fetching as you find her, but isn't quite sure how to make her feelings known.
>The season is beginning to change over to spring, though, and spring is when many beastkin go into heat.
>You think you know how to make this work...
