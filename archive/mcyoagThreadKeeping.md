>Facility ControlC:
https://controlc.com/8cb08486

Rules:
> Getting out: Mass Breakout, you start with 4 Heat Points + Military Mobilization is a mandatory option but still reduces your Super Heat by 1.
> Don't take Breach of Secrecy.
> You can take the "Stay" option.
> Don't use the points from Potential in the build.
> Your build could have been from any Facility, as Mass Breakout means that builds from every Facility have the opportunity to interact. They might also go on missions together if they chose to stay.
> You can choose to experience the revelation for your Facility or not.

>Naruto ControlC:
https://controlc.com/45e966d1

Naruto MP Rules:
>Timeframe - Warring States
>Scenario - Co-Op
>You can choose your ninja rank (Genin, Chunin, Jonin, Special Jonin, Kage), but you only get the benefits of B Rank no matter what you choose. (7 Basic, 2 Advanced, 30 Points, 3 Perks).
>Higher rank ninja are more experienced and capable than lower rank ninja, making them stronger despite the similar point pools.
>Global Drawbacks are Time Warp and Bigger Fish. You get the points and perks from them. (18 Points and 2 Perks).
>Drawbacks gained from Perks still grant points.
>If anything would grant you a companion, gain 5 points. (Alternatively, you and another PC can have each other as companions.)
>Villain's Vendetta, Star-Crossed, and Curse of Waifu/Husbando can't grant your PC companion any points. These drawbacks would require another PC to agree to be the target of them.
>If you take Curse of the Waifu/Husbando, then you become much weaker in a fight against the PC you targeted with the drawback.
