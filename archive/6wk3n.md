Sunset with Beau by anon

>sunset on the island
>sitting next to beau
>it's been a long day of doing...nothing, really
>mostly just fishing and goofing off
>beau was your first friend on the island
>the both of you quickly spent nearly every day together
>it's hard for you to remember a time without beau
>you're very glad to have him as a friend
>you wouldn't trade him for the world
>"hey, anon?"
>beau's voice brings your focus back to reality
>for him to call you by your name instead of "saltlick", he have something important he wants to talk about with you
>you turn towards him, waiting for him to continue
>you can hear him take a soft, yet deep, breath
>"i really like you."
>you're not quite sure how to respond
>>what did he mean by this?
>you decide to be cautious just in case you're misunderstanding
"...how do you mean?"
>his eyes shift toward the ground ever so slightly
>it must be hard for him to tell you this
>you feel a little bad for making it harder for him, albeit unintentionally
"i mean i really like you. i...*like* you."
>there it is
>you're not quite sure how to respond
>no one has told you they've been romantically interested in you before
>you sit there, racking your brain for any semblance of an idea of how to respond
>you've always thought of beau as a friend, but you weren't necessarily opposed to the idea of having him as a lover
>what even constituted being someone's "lover"?
>was it just like being friends, only with more physical contact and the occasional pda?
>you were already pretty open when it came to physical affection with the other male villagers
>or was it something completely different?
>fuck you can't just stay silent
>you race to think of something to say
"...tell me more."
>WHAT
>this antelope just confessed that he likes you and you have the nerve to tell him to EXPLAIN HIMSELF???
>god you feel like such a fucking nerd
>beau takes a deep breath
"well...we've known each other for a while now, right? i've always enjoyed spending time with you, but something always felt...weird. i couldn't stop thinking about how much i love being with you, and i always found myself looking forward to the next time i'd get to see you...and then i'd start thinking about you yourself, and my face would get all hot...i don't think i've ever felt that way before. and i think i just now realized what that meant...and i wanted to tell you."
>fuck
>you've never seen beau be so heartfelt before
>you think about it for a bit
>beau's idea of love seems pretty simple
>he likes you
>he likes being with you
>therefore he loves you
>...
>was it really that simple?
>could love really be as straightforward as just liking someone and wanting to be together?
>by those standards, you liked beau too
>...
>woah
>you liked beau...?
>you weren't quite sure, but, again, you weren't opposed to the idea
>...
>fuck it
>if love is as simple as wanting to be around someone, then you loved beau and had for a long time
>...
>tell him
"..."
>you're at a loss for words
>your face starts to feel hot
>just like beau was talking about
>so you *do* feel the same
>you think
>you slowly inch your hand towards beau's before gently placing it on top of his
>he looks at you with wide eyes
>which isn't really saying much, he looks like he's stoned more than half of the time
>but you can tell he's waiting for you to say something
>you decide to tell him how you feel
"...if liking someone is as natural as you say it is, then..."
>you turn towards him with a nervous smile
"i think i like you too, beau."
>you both sit in silence, staring into each other for what feels like forever
>finally, a faint smile creeps onto beau's face
>he slowly leans toward you, pulling you into a big hug
>he must have been holding his breath
>he looks relieved
"it can be as natural as we want it to be, anon."
>you ended up missing most of the sunset because you were too busy looking at beau
