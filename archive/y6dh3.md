Light of Life

The pen and paper song assaults your mind tonight, a dream of unspeakable discord as was brought upon by forces beyond you.

You have gotten used to this. You would bear it all for her. 

The dream churns and swirls unending, until finally, a merciful snap.

Nothingness. The horrifying sights became naught, and even in your slumbering mind, you know the reason, the only one who could wave away all dark with a wave of her hand.

You smile, unconsciously, and dream of better dreams.

Then, hesitance.

Something was wrong. The familiar weight beside you is not there, the familiar warmth you crave, absent.

No peace no safety no warmth, how dreadful, did something happen.

Through the sands of slumber you force yourself awake, blearily blinking away it all.

“Aubrey…?” You softly croak out. Nothing.

You look around and catch a glimpse outside the window, curtains drawn back.

A full moon.

Oh dear.

Bad things happen on the full moon, you realized. The full moon signals the height of power for many in the supernatural realm, a fact you came to realization during your time spent beside your beloved.

A fact that became a harsh reminder when a lowly beast came upon you one fated night, fur darker than dark and teeth as cruel as the monsters within.

She saved you that day, with a whip of her hands and a blast of arcane might, but since then, you are ashamed to admit that you are more terrified of the dark and...well scary movies as well.

It’s not such an unreasonable fear, surely? Aubrey thinks they’re exciting and often funny in how wrong they portray the monsters, you can’t help but take it all as reminders.

Does it matter though? Aubrey was always there to protect you.

Even now, when she thinks that she has to protect you from herself.

You stand from your shared bed and slowly make your way to her usual, heh, “moping spot.”

You are very certain she’ll bonk you for calling it that but you can’t help label these silly things you and her do.

Flicking the lights, steps towards a balcony.

You saw her.

In the moonlight she was ever radiant, outright otherworldly.

And the full moon emphasized just how much she was beyond you, beautifully inhuman, glowing and softly thrumming with pure power.

Her eyes glowed with that captivating cyan, her hands softly spewed wisps of the same color.

She calls herself no better than the things that stalk the dark. You tell her everyday that she was the light of your life.

She was larger than life, and she chose you to remain by her side. 

You step towards her, unfearful. She would never hurt you, no matter how much she insists that she would at times like these.

You saw her tense up.

“Aubrey.” You softly call out.

Silence.

Then, a grunt.

Looks like she was going to be stubborn about this? Fine by you, you were just as firm in this.

You step just beside her, leaning on the railing.

She turns to you with an unsure frown.

“Anon, what did I tell you about-?” You cut off her admonishment by hugging her and resting your chin on her shoulder.

She feels very warm, out here in the chill of the midnight sky.

She freezes up, but makes no motion to push you away.

But she makes none either to return your embrace, and so, it is up to you.

She sighs, frustrated at you insistence.

“Anon...I told you, you shouldn’t even be close to me like this...” Nope.

“Anon…” Nah.

“Anon...let go…” Nay.

“Anooon…” You hear a small something in her voice, like a smile suddenly being shot down.

You’re doing great.

“Say something, you goof...heh…” A small chuckle. You did it. You smile at her.

“Do you really not listen...? Aren’t you scared that I’d just...go wild?” Her hand flicks out, and a small wave of power blows into the sky, softly tousling your hair.

“No, you’d never hurt me.” You say with as much honesty as you can. It was the truth you very much so believed in, no matter how much she’d say otherwise.

You lift a hand and tenderly wrap it around hers. She stares into your eyes soulfully, gently quivering from unspoken emotion, her eyes just a tad bit watery.

You held her tight and refused to let go, offering as much comfort and respite for her, just as she did for you so many times, through your nightmares and through cliched horror movies.

The both of you spent a bit more time outside, a comfortable night, under the gleaming stars.

Your love for each other was enough to keep the both of you warm and cozy, and as you gazed at the stars, you decided to talk to her about precious past memories, to distract her.

You reminisced and cherished time itself with her, and the both of you could not be more grateful to have each other in their life.


Soon, the both of you retreated to bed, safe and warm in each other’s embrace.
