TL:DR concept: Drunk lamia monk who cannot lie. She goes around devouring monsters and villains, only to then rebirth them into something new. Trained extensively on the floating islands of Aria, before Lahash sent her to the mainland so she could hunt down and devour monsters of all shapes and sizes.
Her fighting style is largely focused around grappling and constricting her opponents, she is a no nonsense tomboy (except when breeding season arrives).
