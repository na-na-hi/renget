>This was it. Sonic had once again triumphed over the dastardly Dr. Robotnik, and with the power of the seven chaos emeralds, no less. As Robotnik and his giant mech came crashing down into the cold, hard ground, Sonic's friends immediately felt a huge sense of relief wash them over. The Wachowskis and Tails then came running towards the golden hedgehog, in order to celebrate their victory with him

>Their small celebration wouldn't last long, however, as Knuckles suddenly came with a grave warning to those near Sonic. The echidna warrior said to the others that the hedgehog's mind had now been corrupted by the emeralds' power, and that he was no longer the Sonic they once knew. 

>Soon enough, Sonic began summoning a thunderstorm made out of pure chaos energy, which then ended up engulfing him whole. The hedgehog then began cackling madly, green lightning arcs surrounding him and the thunderstorm as he felt the power of the chaos emeralds take over him.

>A few moments after, the thunderstorm then began dissipating, revealing Sonic's new appearance. His quils much more unkempt than they already were, his aura even bigger and brighter than it was before, and his irises replaced with red spirals that extended all over his eyes, something which only solidified his now unsound state of mind.

>Sonic then went on a rampage, destroying anything that came onto his field of view. Trees, rocks, buildings, vehicles and roads. Anything he could see he would destroy. He was now running wild, and it would certainly take much more effort to take him down than with Robotnik's giant mech.

>Tails, Knuckles and the Wachowskis struggled to at least make a small bruise on him, something Sonic found rather pathetic and laughable. He then went in for the kill, brutalizing all 4 of the ones fighting him, and leaving a gory mess in their place.

>After having seen the viscera and blood of his enemies, Sonic then let out a thunderous, terrifying laugh at the skies above, as if he was celebrating his friends' death... When suddenly, all his glee and laughter began getting slowly replaced by intense feelings of despair and regret, all while he was slowly reverting to his normal form.

>Sonic then realized what he had done. His friends, all dead, thanks to him and the emeralds. He began crying while letting out screams of anguish at his friends' death, something which caused the emeralds he absorbed to exit his body, and scatter themselves all over the planet. The hedgehog then noticed one of the rings he'd use to travel to other places, and so he decided to toss one of his rings, and escape to the mushroom planet, in some form of self-exile.

>He once again went mad after having isolated himself on the mushroom planet. All the things he had endured, coupled with his extreme feelings of loneliness, did quite the number on his psyche and body. His eyes were now bloodshot and leaking blood, and his body, along with his clothes, soaked with the blood of the ones he had killed.

>One could say that Sonic had brought all of his misery and loneliness upon himself, but it was simply not the case. He was merely a victim of circumstance. A victim to the maddening power of the very gems he thought would solve the conflict he and his friends were going through at the moment. It sadly didn't turn out to be the case, however, as the only thing they did was worsen his problems even more.

>He had nothing left at this point. Nothing at all, indeed...
