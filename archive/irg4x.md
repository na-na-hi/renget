#Olaf's Chart

>Vampires
For being so far above Normals they seek the same petty tyrannies Normals do.
>Quentin King
A leech with delusions of grandeur. A usable ally given his interests are so predictable.
>Alicia de Ville
Occasionally you have Others like her and her ilk who refuse to accept that their humanity is gone. It’s an unfortunate affliction but I can sympathize.

>Werewolves
My kin.
>Caroline Hayward
She seemed to enjoy my combat training for… the wrong reasons. She clings to her lost humanity too much but I don’t have the heart to correct this failing.
>Scott Caledonia
Actual potential with this one. He seems overly concerned with matters of the flesh, but after he sees the insides of enough victims in service to the pack I suspect he’ll lose his preoccupation.

>Fae
Vexing creatures. With the vampire you can rely on their self interest. With the fae even that is suspect. They may well put themselves in danger for the sheer thrill of it.
>Emelia Shadowsong
I have no quarrel with the fae, but she is everything I find vexing about them. She acts rather than thinks, it makes her a dangerous opponent.

>Cthulid
Enemies to be sure, but entertaining ones.
>Greed
I have fought against this Kage Hito. She could not match me in this world, though she had a distinct advantage when she pulled me into her own. Her zeal is respectable if misplaced.
>Child of the Void
A rumor rather than a known opponent. She seems content to rot in her own little corner of the city. I’m torn between allowing a sleeping dragon to slumber and a preemptive strike to rid us of future trouble.

>Fallen
Abominations.
>Zander Merrick
Abomination he may be, but our goals are compatible. I can work with this Zander in the short term. 
>Joshua Morningstar
To hunt him would result in the deaths of far too many Normals to be worth it. Vexing though it may be I feel we have no choice but to hope an opportunity to be rid of him presents itself.
>Conquest
She and I have never met, though if her reputation holds she may be a worthy opponent. 
>War
I have never met him, though he has the reputation of a lowly manipulator rather than of a true warrior, as one should expect from the Fallen.

>Demon
Their entire being centers around deception and low cunning. It would be cruel to judge them for it.
>Cherie Fonesca
A roommate to one of my packmates. Apparently alluring enough to ensnare my alpha, which is rather embarrassing.

>Zombies
Simple minded creatures.
>Natalie Windsor
A roommate to one of my packmates though I don’t know much beyond that.
>Sweeney
A difficult opponent politically. He cannot be trusted with an alliance though I’ve no issue working with/for him when the pack’s interests align with his own.

>Dragons
The so-called King of Beasts must be brought low eventually, though I doubt this will be accomplished in my life time.
>Senna Netherclaw
Allegedly on the outs with her draconic brethren… interesting. As we are now it is impossible for the Ulven to escape Draconic overlordship, though working with one who works against the interests of the whole wouldn’t be objectionable.

>Experiment
Worse than the Fallen.
>”Tom”
There are few things that send chills up my spine, but he is one of them. He is a repulsive creature.
>Evan Harker
Death would be a mercy
>Death
I have had the occasion to meet the horsemans’ leader. I had intended to kill her, but I didn’t even draw blade against her. As I was about to strike, I saw the promised Blood Moon in her eyes, so I left in peace. Her motivation for staying her own hand are a mystery to me.
>Mister Smith
Do not speak to this thing. Kill on sight.
>Famine
I can smell the madness on this one. I cannot tell if he’s essential to the promised Blood Moon, or if he’s a threat to be killed. Time will tell.

>Humans
We were all human once. We were all prey once. Except for Dragons. Those humans who seek to rise above their station and overcome their weakness while holding true to their humanity are to be admired.
>Crow
Many in the pack owe her a debt. Too many. She may need to be removed before she rules this pack by weight of obligation alone.
>Owen
A psychopath and a Dhampyr? Poor fool.
>Number 7
A useful contact to have and her payment methods are far less insidious than Crow’s.
>Pestilence
A lunatic who wished to live in interesting times. A foolish wish, but one that seems to have been granted.
>Ted Zion
We fought once this human and I. He was a worthy foe. Fortunately the battle was born of a misunderstanding so the conclusion to our contest was not tragic. Still, he earned my respect that day.
