# Stop having fun!

"Stop having fun!" Lamy exclaimed at you petulantly, swinging her bottle of sake around as she pouted.

You immediately wipe the small smirk from your face, and revert back to staring directly ahead of you.

You are a member of the high guard, responsible for protecting young Lady Lamy of the Yukihana family of Unylia.

The honour of serving the Yukihana family has been a tradition in your own family for as long as you can remember: your father is an elite bodyguard, and your mother a personal maid and assistant to Duke and Dutchess Yukihana themselves, Lamy's parents.

Here you are stationed in Lamy's room.

*You must not break composure. That would be unprofessional.*

But... You are certain Lamy's companion Daifuku just winked at you from inside his little blue pot.

You notice Lamy is looking at you; you look away, causing Lamy to make a sound like a hurrumph, and walk directly over to you.

Uh oh. This will be difficult.

She takes another swig from her sake bottle, sets it down on a table to the side, and then moves closer to you so that your faces are within inches from eachother. Her beautiful blue hair looks elegant and soft as it drapes across her pointed ears and down her face, and her gorgeous amber eyes are staring directly into yours--almost as if she is staring into your very thoughts. 

She begins in a very gentle voice:
"You know, it's very lonely up here in this tower, even with you all watching over me like you do."

"Sometimes it makes me feel left out!" she squeaks.

You can smell the alcohol on her breath.

You begin to sweat as you try to maintain a straight face. You are surprised at how pale her skin is, and how soft her lips look this close to you; in fact, it takes all of your willpower not to lean in and kiss her, but you know that would be the end of your career, or worse.

Her eyes soften a bit, and she starts to smile, almost knowingly.
*So this is the power of an elven snow witch?* you think to yourself.

"Do you ever wonder what I do when I'm alone?" she asks you softly.

"Not at all, my Lady. That is strictly your business" you respond immediately, hoping to end the conversation there.

Lamy giggles, and loosens up a bit.

"Aw, you sure are dedicated to your job."

She leans in and kisses you lightly on the lips, causing you to move your head back in surprise.

"Not a single soul may know about this" she whispers as she steps back from you, smiling. 

Lamy turns, her dress and hair swirling around behind her; an alluring flowery fragrance enters your nostrils as she walks past you and out of the room.

"This is the third time she's done this" you mutter to yourself, pulling your phone out of your pocket. "I'm telling her father".
