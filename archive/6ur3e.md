#Pride of the Tengu

The sun hangs low in the sky, bathing Konoha in warm hues of red and orange. What this meant to its people varied. For many, it meant that they would close their shops and head home for dinner to make some mischief with their friends. Yet, for others, their duties had no set end and could even be said to begin with the sunset. After all, many of the activities a ***shinobi*** might engage in were best done under cover of night.

One after another, arrows hit their marks with startling speed. Tengu Yumiko belonged to the group whose work did not necessarily, though she would bristle at being called a shinobi. Indeed, many of her clan existed in the limbo of being something *like* a shinobi. They carved out a place amongst Konoha's military police as an honorable form of service, continued to favor kyūjutsu and kenjustu over many of the tools and tricks of the shinobi, and called themselves ***samurai***. Yet, they served alongside shinobi, and their children learned their ways. Yumiko herself could accurately throw a kunai or shuriken. There were differences in ideology and mannerisms, but how much could this difference be emphasized amidst all that was shared?

Dozens of arrows are loosed in a single draw with no loss in accuracy evident. Its application in the heat of battle would not come as easily, but the image of even a small squad of yumihikis blotting out the sun makes her heart swell with pride. Yet, this was also something Yumiko had learned as a shinobi. The young Tengu would say that what separated her from the common shinobi was her honor as a samurai. The shinobi had their bonds and nindō, but the samurai had their honor and bushidō. The difference was obvious, she thought. But she could not say whether her children's children would have these ideals consumed by Konoha's *Will of Fire*.

"Caw!"

Another note is added to the evening symphony. A sound that Yumiko had known from the moment she was strong enough to draw her bow. Her companion, Asaya, perches on her shoulder.

"You've returned," Yumiko speaks matter-of-factly, not even turning away from the training dummies as she loses another volley of arrows.

The crow preens herself. Asaya knew well enough that her master's sight extended beyond what lay in front of her. Even if it didn't, it was only natural for a proud master to have a proud pet. "Your senses are truly extraordinary. Tell me, have you rested since I left to stretch my wings?"

Yumiko scoffs. "Do you think Kambara is resting? Would you have your master surpassed in blade and bow by a mere shinobi?"

"Worried about sweet Soue, are you? I believe I encountered her on my flight. Ah, but I suppose you're too busy to listen to little ol' me. I'll leave you to it then." Asaya spreads her wings and makes to fly away, steadily circling higher and higher above Yumiko.

The raven-haired girl grimaces, and after some deliberating, her posture relaxes as she walks towards the garden's basin. "A soldier who wears himself out before the battle will only prove how foolish he is."

Asaya lands on a branch, chirping in amusement. "Oh, my memory seems a bit foggy now. Perhaps a snack would help it clear up..."

Yumiko sighs as she unhooks a purse and places a small mound of seed on the basin's rim. The crow happily gorges herself before regaling her master the tales of her travels. For the most part, it is nothing unexpected, and Yumiko almost regrets stopping early to listen. However, one piece of information comes as a surprise.

"That gaijin will only cause trouble. It would be better that we didn't let him into the village at all." Yumiko finishes rinsing herself off and crosses her arms. Her fierce eyes somehow look fiercer as she mulls over what she's been told.

"Oh? But a washed-up fish doesn't seem as dangerous as a band of birds like us. Perhaps old man Inatsu shall send the Tengu away with him."

Yumiko's eyes clench shut, and her frown deepens. "We can be trusted. He cannot. Neither can that wretched fox. Any who fall under guidance shall be led to ruin.

"Such strong words. Were you not taught to show reverence to your elders, master? I could have sworn there was a lesson or two between all your posturing." Asaya cackles as Yumiko grits her teeth.

"My faith in Lord Inatsu is unshakeable, but that woman is little more than a foul trickster. Once I best Kambara, I shall put Hakumo in her place as well".

"Oh my, oh my. What grand aspirations my master has. Once you've drawn the bow and swung the blade until your palms ache, will sprout a tail as well? Perhaps you'll start throwing tree trunks as well?"

Yumiko only scoffs. If it was for her honor, then there was nothing she would not try. Even act as a shinobi.
