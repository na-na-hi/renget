!!! Danger
     By request, a drama Rentry was made. Should any new Rentry show up covering drama or whatnot, it will be added to this chart. This drama Rentry will stay on the template Rentry to maintain the peace. It's up to individual bakers to include any of theses links in their OP post, or be it in the recap, or anywhere else. Either way, It's not going to be my problem.
