Mother and Son

>It was nine in the morning.
>Three hours remained before the movers arrive.
>Casey drove her car into the garage with a weary smile, not having slept much last night.
>She’s been increasingly worried about her son not answering her calls for the past three days.
>The woman nervously bit her lip as she got out of the car. Is her baby doing okay? She did leave him that steak and some money to spend when she left for the city, but what if those weren't enough?
>To make it up to him, Casey decided to stop by a steakhouse on the way home and get Sunny’s favorite steak.
>Upon entering the house, the woman was struck by how clean and spotless everything was. Not a single speck of dust covered the floor. Impressive.
>Looks like son did his chores as promised — and did it exceptionally well. The woman smiled proudly as she made her way to her son’s room, paper bag with the steak in hand. She would have to reward him for his hard work later.
>”Sunny, it’s mommy! I’m back!” she announced whilst softly knocking on his door.
>No response.
>”Sunny?”
>Sunny’s usually awake by this time of the day. Did he stay up late last night?
>”Honey, I’ve got something for you. I’ve got your favorite right here, steak!”
>Still no answer.
>Casey nudged the door’s handle and found that it hasn’t been locked.
>”Should I come in now and wake him up or do I let him sleep just a bit more?” she pondered.
>Casey decided to come in, but she won’t wake him up just yet. She just wanted to see her son’s face again after so long.
>A pungent odor assaulted her nostrils upon opening the door.
>It smelled strangely…metallic.
>Casey froze up in her spot.
>Her son’s right there, draped in his blanket sideways.
>But…
>”Sunny?!”
>Abject fear gripped her mind as Casey slowly made her way towards her son’s bed, the ceiling light flickering above.
>Something has seeped into the blanket.
>Something…
>Red.
>The mother’s eyes widened and her entire body trembled as she frantically pulled the blanket and turned her son around.
>A loud scream came out of her.


>A knife…


>A bloody knife…


>Plunged right into her son’s stomach


>Her son’s body lay motionless on his bed; his open eyes staring right at her, devoid of life.


>It’s as if time has stopped; the world and everything in it frozen up.


>The initial shock vanished not long after…


>And it struck her…


>”Oh god…”


>”Oh my god! Sunny!”


>The horrified mother hugged her son’s lifeless body, one arm behind his back and the other caressing his forehead.


>Her son’s dead


>He took his own life


>”My…baby.”


>That was all she could say for a while as if locked in a delirious trance.


>It was all her fault.


>She should have never left him.


>”I’m sorry…so sorry. “Mommy’s…so…sorry. Sunny…Please forgive your mommy”


>The mother continued to sob as she kissed her son’s cold forehead, wishing she could turn back time and do things differently.
