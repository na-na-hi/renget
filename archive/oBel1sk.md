Jackal's Obelisk by anonymous

>Ywn compliment your jackal on his "nice obelisk"

>toying around with "total real" ancient Egyptian artifact you got out of ebay
>suddenly there is a flash of bright light and you find yourself in a place that look like some kind of Egyptian palace or temple
>"What are you doing here, mortal?"
>you turn around and spot Anubis sitting on a couch
>he tries to looks all majestic and such but judging by his boner and pre-cum you caught him in the middle of masturbation session
>As the jackal desperately reaches for a pillow to cover his throbbing passion, your mind scrambles to think how and why you've ended up here
>Come to think of it, that small artifact did seem a little... strange
>You were supposed to receive a small obelisk, but even though the artifact had all of the requisite markers and hieroglyphics you'd expect of one, the shape was decidedly non-monolithic
>Indeed, it's slightly curved and there's a bit of a flaring out at the base-
>...
>Oh...
>You look up at the stone dick that has appeared to grown size in your hand
>You try to recall the moments that activated teleportation
>Or did it was really the work of the obelisk? What if Anubis himself brought you here because of what you did?
>Time to test your new theory
>You grab more firmly the the black like obsidian, smooth like glass, hard like diamond, yet oddly but pleasantly warm like real body statue and begin sensual stroking it like you would your real cock
>Almost immediately the jackal's body tenses up and he push the pillow harder to his crotch, but you don't stop
>After a moment of fighting with the pleasure his head lies down on the sofa with close eyes, the silence in the room is break by his soft moan, the pillow falls on the floor and you can again admire his cock, this time jerking and drooling pre-cum in rhythm to your strokes
>this only lasted like a few second before the god suddenly stood up
>"You better put that away, mortal. I'm not one to me toy with." He don't scream, but his voice is so ice cold serious you take a step back
>And then you notice your hand going through a nearby column like through air
>A realization hit you
>It's all an illusion, you aren't really here. It's like magical videochat
>He can't touch you
>But YOU can touch him
>Your heart's pace speeds up as you think about what you're about to do
>You really hope you're right in your conclusion and the buff jackal can't get you in other way
>He doesn't make things less scarier with his cold stare fixed on you and his calm yet spine-chilling voice constantly demanding complete obedience
>Despite that you rise the statue to your face and take a long lick all across it length
>Anubis bits his lips mid-sentence, fighting to not moan again. His hips thrust forward and his cock throb excited
>It doesn't surprise you at this point that the "obelisk" taste like real living body rather than stone, but you didn't expect the hit of strong dazzling scent that now emit from the artifact
>Prompt by the new senses and the lack of punishment you start sucking it
>The jackal's eyes turn into plates as he witnesses the dildo disappearing in your mouth, he stands still with only his cock twitching constantly
>The magic cock matches in size with the real Anubis's one and now has grown so much you can barley fit it inside your throat
>You work hard and after some impressive struggle the immortal falls on his shaking knees
>"Great Nile, I haven't experience such pleasure in centuries" he half-mumbles, half-moans as he lies down on the floor, pushing his hips up to the air like if he wanted to fuck it
>Another moan, longer and louder, trembles the room and a white fountain shoots up in the air and stains the floor with cum
>And again the magic of the artifact surprise you as you feel thick ropes of fake cum running down your throat
