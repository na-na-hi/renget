##### What is Narcissistic Personality Disorder?
Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) is a Cluster B Personality Disorder. Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behavior. People with NPD tend to have a low self esteem, without others to constantly lift them up, to tell them they are valuable, to give them attention and to treat them well, they may quickly fall into self-hatred, emptiness, and shame, which they try boost by making themself 'seem important' or higher up.  They may seek attention or exaggerate their own achievements to gain this. People with NPD also tend to have low empathy, but this may not be the case with all. I wont go too into detail about *what* NPD is, so if you want a better explanation, [here is one](https://medium.com/@EvelynPsychotic/narcissus-and-the-daffodils-ac149b3399ca).

##### What is Narc Abuse?
Narcissistic Abuse refers to abuse where the victim may be gaslighted, being denied that something happened, belittle or demean your emotions, use small white lies to make you doubt your reality, make dramatic, grandiose promises, mamanipulate your feelings, tell fake promises and false apologies, exploit empathy and be violent.

##### Why is Narc Abuse not real?
"But Jinxx you just explained what Narc Abuse is, so how isn't it real?" Well, yes some of these traits *can* be linked to symptoms and traits of NPD, they're not NPD exclusive. These traits of "Narc Abuse" I described are common with emotional abuse, regardless if the person has NPD or not.

'Narc Abuse' is just emotional abuse. Most cases of people saying they went through 'Narc Abuse', the perpetrator doesn't even have NPD and the victim has just armchair diagnosed them as a Narcissist, even though these traits which make it 'Narc Abuse' are things ALL emotional abusers too. This *is* demonising NPD as a whole. NPD traits dont make a person abusive, being an abuser makes someone abusive. Even if an abuser has NPD, it is still emotional abuse regardless. People are using Narcissist as a synonym for someone who is manipulative, which is untrue and Narcissists are just people with NPD.

'Narcissistic' isnt an action, it is a **disorder**. It is not why someone will or will not be abusive, it will not define if someone is a good or bad person.

**YES, PEOPLE WITH NPD CAN BE ABUSIVE**, but they also can be some of the best people you meet. People with NPD are still able to be good people. The term 'Narc Abuse' has contributed to the demonisation that all people with NPD are abusers and horrible manipulative people, which is the main reason why it is ableist.
