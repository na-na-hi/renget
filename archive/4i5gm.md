#Tournament Intermission - Inigo

####I. Battle Stage
The Shiketsu High battle tournament was well on its way. Inigo stood in the arena of a stadium that held huge crowds of spectators, with dozens of cameras pointed right at him, but all he could think at the end of his first-round match is how she felt. He had beaten Hoge in their first match. It felt unfair. Stealth quirks weren't exactly effective when you're on such a small stage. Gigan's maximum size easily reached 20 meters as it is. He got off his back and sat up from the ground. Pretending to be tired for the crowd was easy when his body did feel slow and heavy. She had gotten him with a clean blow after all, but the sting from it echoed in his head. 

She had given it her all and fought him like a real enemy. A few more wrong moves on his part and she might have won. She would've been pissed at him for not trying if that happened. He doubted she would've ever forgiven him. In the end, his best move was to surprise her with something dumb and end the match quickly. She knew all his best construct forms from their sparring, and she would've expected his Crash Dragonclaw or Knight Armor. Bulldozer Armor, on the other hand, was stupid and unwieldy. There was no anticipating something that dumb. Even the Gigan Splash, was an unorthodox idea to throw her off and get the crowd excited for their fight simultaneously. He hoped the arena cameras were high-tech enough to capture her acrobatics and ninja skills. They needed to see the fruits of her hard work. They needed to see how cool and amazing Hoge was. The same way he saw her every day.  

The crowd cheered wildly as the announcer talked up Inigo's victory. A good two minutes had passed by and he opened his eyes. That was enough time to sell the match, right? Time to walk up to her, offer a hand, and maybe stand together in front of the cameras. This was, of course, the world premiere of the future powerhouse pro-hero couple, Ryukishi and Maru(maru), even if the rest of the world didn't know it yet. They'd probably write a movie one day. Getting up slowly, he turned towards where she sat and found her no longer there. Crap. He frantically looked around. There were four exits out of the arena she could've taken. He got up to follow her, cursing himself for being too optimistic. 

The announcer's voice boomed across the arena.

**“AAAND GIVE IT UP FOR MYOOOOGA ONE MORE TIME! STAY CLOSE BY, FOLKS! OUR NEXT BATTLE WILL BEGIN IN A FEW! GET YOUR SCORECARDS READY CAUSE ITS GONNA BE AN INCREDIBLE CLASH OF STEEL! WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS QUICK MESSAGE!"**
***

####II. West Exit
Inigo frowned and slipped his phone back into his pocket. None of his texts were getting through to her. He dashed down the hall with Gigan flying just above his shoulder. He looked quickly, not at the crowds he passed but at the little things people usually skip over like how the hall lights reflected off people's heads and the way their shadows danced alongside each person. That's how you find a Hoge. He rounded a corner and suddenly found himself face-to-face with a woman with a huge grin. She moved towards him with a camera crew behind her. A small crowd began to gather around them. 

"Hello there, young man! Do you have a moment?" A boom mic appeared just above them, just as Inigo nodded reflexively.

The dark-haired newscaster spoke out, changing her stance so she was in the line of the shot. "This is the one and only Reporter Akari Honda from the WK Network, coming to you live from the Shiketsu Battle Tournament! And today, we have one of the winning competitors of the first round, fresh from his intense match! Please tell our lovely audience who you are!" She held up the mic towards him.

Inigo was taken aback for a moment by the sudden ambush. He was in a hurry, but maybe this was a good thing. Gigan landed on Inigo's shoulder and gave the woman a suspicious look. Inigo tightened his red tie for a moment, before striking a confident pose and putting on his trademark grin. 

"Ah, Reporter Honda-san! A pleasure to meet you! I'm Inigo, but you can call me the Dragon Rescue Hero: Ryukishi, the prince of hearts!" He gave a peace sign to the camera. "But listen, let me tell you about my opponent, Nyoro Hoge! She's the class representative of Shiketsu's 1-D hero course and she's the smartest student in all of Kyoto. Likely the most beautiful girl too." The reporter blinked and tried to move her mic away, but he grabbed it to hold it still. "Her Hero Name is the Professional Ninja, Maru(maru)! She's going to do great things, I guarantee it!"

The reporter's composure only fell for a second after getting caught off guard by Inigo's redirection. She was a professional after all. She spoke without missing a beat. "That's lovely, Ryukishi! So our viewers absolutely loved the cute green dragon! Can you tell us more about that amazing quirk?"

Inigo waved a dismissive hand, his focus solely on one thing. "OH YEAH! So the quirk's called: Wasuremono. It makes Maru super invisible and undetectable. She can do all sorts of ninja tricks like that after-image stuff with it too. It's an incredibly strong quirk that really any agency can use." Gigan morphed into a chibi Maru ninja and threw green ninja stars as he spoke. It did flips in mid-air which garnered cheers from the crowd around them.

The reporter attempted to steer the conversation back on track. "That's fascinating, Ryukishi, but our viewers are curious about **your** quirk as well. Can you please tell us a little about it?"

Inigo narrowed his eyes. "Eh, my quirk? Gigan's like a green cat." Gigan mewed for the camera. "If you don't mind! ACTUALLY-!" He winked and swept the mic off the surprised reporter's hand, before taking a confident step forward to address the viewers directly. The camera crew exchanged perplexed glances, unsure of how to proceed.

"HOGE! I'm trying to find you! I'm in the West Exit right now! So just stay where you are, or come and get me. I'm bringing the cheer-up session ASAP!" He winked and shot a fingergun.

The reporter took the mic back. "Um, yes, Gigan sounds like an incredible quirk! For our next question, can you please-"

"Sorry, Reporter-san, but duty calls!" Inigo interrupted with a mischievous grin. He clapped his hands together and leaped into the air, startling everyone around him. He grabbed a zipline made by Gigan and swung past the crowd of people. "Thanks for the chat!"

And with that, Inigo dashed off, leaving a bewildered reporter and camera crew in his wake. "Well, folks, you heard it here first, in the wild world of heroes! Why don't we talk to some of the local visitors again? Next, we have a local businessman, Oyster-san. How're you doing Oyster-san?"

Bubbles filled with his speech popped around the Oyster-headed mutant. "Why yes- I'm good, I'm very excited to anno-"

"Excuse me! Coming through! I gotta go this way!" Inigo ziplined back in the other direction. Oyster-san stepped back and bumped into a passing news intern. Orange juice spilled all over his suit.

"SORRY ABOUT THAT!" Inigo waved behind him at the grumbling Oyster-headed man as he headed for the locker rooms.

####III. Lockers & Waiting Rooms
***
"Alright, Gigan! You know the drill!" Inigo's voice rang mischievously, the green shape-shifting dragon construct perched on his shoulder nodding sympathetically, emitting a squeaky mew.

"You look left, I'll look right! We got this!"

With explosive energy, Inigo burst through the locker room doors, sending clothes and bottles flying. Startled screams erupted as he weaved chaotically through the room, apologizing loudly.

"Sorry! Coming through. I'm on a mission for love! Nice leopard print."

<Security!> <GET OUT!> <Hi Inigo!> <Thanks!>

Removing a fallen skirt from his head, he charged into the next room, swinging past a few waiting rooms.

"Yo Chris! Good luck, man! Can't stay. Feel free to use my dragon, bro!"

<Inigo. What're you-?>

He ran through. Chris looked pretty serious and excited. Better check on him after his match. Inigo dashed through a set of orange doors.

"Sora! You got Yui next! I'm sorry, buddy...You might as well be in 1-E..."

<You almost saw me un-hooded. You're lucky to be alive.>

Leaping acrobatically over benches, Inigo sprinted towards the competitors' lockers. Spotting a familiar face, he waved eagerly.

"Yo Chihiro! That's a cool new sword! Where do I get one?"

<This? The supporters gave it to me. Over there.>

"Sweet! Thanks! Good luck with your match!"

Following Chihiro's directions, Inigo dashed into the support locker rooms.

"Wow, some support girls, need a lot of support huh?"

<Pervert!> <Eeek!> <They're prototypes!>

Dodging equipment flung by panicked support students as he passed through, he charged into the next set of lockers.

"Victor? MIRE GIRL? You two!? When did that happen? Also, nice."

<It's not like that! I was just-> <HER?! PFT. All I need is my quirk.>

Nope, not there. He ran to the next room.

"Noah! Don't lose before getting to me alright? We gotta have a friendship battle."

Damn, he must've impressed Sally's parents today. He wondered if Hoge's parents just watched him beat their perfect daughter. That can't be good. He groaned before running into another room.

"Majestic-sensei? Sir, I didn't know we had cheerleaders."

<MYOGA! I'm just checking their credentials. HAHAHA!>

What a true hero. He sprinted into the halls to give them some privacy.

Inigo ran up the stairs only to come to a skidding halt. Two burly security guards blocked his path.

"Stop right there!" the larger one yelled.

"Can't do that." He grinned and turned around to see another set of guards behind him.

"We got you now punk!"

"Sorry fellas, wish I could stay." Giving them a mock salute, Inigo dove out a window, wings of shimmering green carrying him down towards the crowded courtyard outside the stadium. The smells of fair food filled the busy square. Upbeat music played as Inigo weaved between booths, flashing signs and shouts bombarding his senses. Business students hawked hero merchandise from packed stalls, foam fingers, and flags waving above the sea of heads. Fans swarmed tables piled high with plushies, gear, and shirts.

"Whoa, there are Gigan plushies?" Inigo turned his head to stare mid-flight. "Did you know about this, buddy?" 

**PPPKKKKKKTTT!!** Inigo slammed into a sign.

####IV. Merchandise Courtyard

The stadium sign cracked loudly as Inigo careened into it face-first. He slid down the smooth surface, landing in a dazed heap on the sunbaked pavement below. Blinking slowly, Inigo stumbled to his feet. The cheerful din of the festival drifted hazily back into focus.

"Ow. Guess we just gotta hang out here a bit until the heat dies down." Inigo felt around his blazer. "Crap, did I leave my wallet in my locker?"

Gigan mewed worriedly, nudging his cheek. Inigo sighed, "Yeah, I know. No money for snacks or merch."

His gaze drifted longingly over the crowded stalls. Delicious aromas mingled in the warm air—fried dough, grilled meats, chilled ice cream. Inigo's stomach rumbled hungrily. At a nearby booth, a mountain of plushie Gigans beckoned him.

"No way, they made plushies of you already?" Inigo drifted towards them as if magnetized. "We gotta get one of those, pal."

Wandering aimlessly amidst the lively stalls, Inigo found himself caught in the hero hype. Sunlight glinted off hero gear and collectibles. Excited chatter surrounded him. Inigo paused by a Saurus-themed Taco stand, mouth watering at the sizzling meat. He checked his pockets one more time in vain.
Just then, a familiar voice called out. "Inigo! Over here!"

Inigo turned to see his friend Junichi waving by a snack stand. Inigo made his way over, grinning. "Junichi! Saving the day with your presence. And your wallet."

Junichi frowned. "No money? Guess the hero's student business doesn't pay much."

"You know it," Inigo laughed. "But dude, check out all this stuff they're selling. That's me!"

He pointed excitedly at the merchandise booths. "Gigan plushies, Ryu-kishi t-shirts, little Maru(maru) ninja stars. It's crazy!"

"Capitalizing on naive kids desperate for fame," Junichi muttered. But Inigo was already eyeing the snack stand.

Noticing his gaze, Junichi sighed and handed over some money. "Here. I'll get us ice cream. You're paying me back later."

"You're the best!" Inigo looked over the selection of ice pops made to resemble popular pro-heroes. 

"I'll take the Rosethorn Raspberry. Thanks!" The stall owner happily gave him the ice pop. "Which one are you getting, man?"

Junichi pointed. The seller grinned and spoke "Ah! The Endeavor Pop! That's our best seller."

Inigo blinked and smirked as the two of them walked to the side to enjoy their frozen treats.

"Didn't think you'd get an Endeavor one." Inigo teased.  Junichi bit into it, decapitating the Endevour pop, he held it up for Inigo to see.

"Makes more sense now," Inigo said shrugging.  "Man, I was starving! This is so good." He stared at the Rosethorn Ice Pop. "They got the proportions wrong though. They're much bigger in-person."

"Wanna see who gets brain freeze faster?" Junichi said flatly.

"You're on!" 

They raced to finish their ice cream, clutching their heads in agony moments later.

"A draw?" Inigo wheezed out.

Junichi nodded, wincing. After recovering, Inigo leaned in, "Not that I wasn't happy to see you, but what're you doing at a hero tournament, man?"

Junichi lowered his voice to reply, "A Legion defector arrived in Kyoto from Tokyo, yesterday. I think there's a good chance they're here. I wouldn't be caught dead here otherwise. "

Inigo thought for a moment. "Hmm, is that right? Security's pretty tight. Why would they go to a place full of heroes?" 

Junichi continued, "Dunno, but have you seen anyone suspicious?"

Inigo shook his head. "Nah, no one here gives me that vibe." 

The two kept on walking passed a series of game stalls such as the Majestic Laser Tag and Localoca Air Rifles.

"Must be cool getting secret Legion missions," Inigo mused as they looked around. "You got the final part of that package, right? What was in it?"

Junichi shrugged, "I'm not sure. The key opened the pack and I found this." He held out a black syringe with a red liquid inside. "No labels or anything. I heard some higher up from Tokyo's been sending them to random low members. I just happened to be lucky enough. Some kind of experimental drug. All it said was to use it in case of an emergency. The label says "TR-D2C"."

Inigo frowned, "I got a bad feeling. Take it from someone born in that crowd. I've seen drugs that just blow up your jaw, or turn your blood into jelly. It's messed up. I'd just throw it away."

Junichi nodded, "I know I should, but it doesn't hurt to keep it around. Just in case."

Inigo stopped and clasped Junichi's shoulder. "You don't need it, bro. You're great, just the way you are. I wouldn't change anything about you."

"Stop," Junichi turned away and grumbled, "I'm not gonna use it."

Inigo grinned, "Cool." They had walked to the edge of the merch stalls and towards the stadium entrance. "You wanna come in? I can get you in, bro." 

"Nah. I'll circle around some more. Just keep an eye out," Junichi advised seriously. "It's possible it's nothing."

"Will do! Hey! Watch me win, alright?" 

The two shared a fist bump as Inigo made his way back inside.

####V. Stadium Halls

**“MITSURUGI WINS! HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH REMARKABLE SWORDSMANSHIP? ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! LET'S WATCH THAT MOVE AGAIN IN INSTANT 99K REPLAY!”**

The announcer's voice blasted as Inigo wandered through the crowded arena hallways, scanning the sea of faces for any familiar ones. Chihiro had just won. She's gonna be a tough one to beat. He spotted Hifumi leaning against a wall looking intently across the hall. Following his gaze, Inigo saw the unmistakable fiery form of Endeavor, surrounded by a mob of eager fans and reporters clamoring for his attention.

"Yo, Hifumi!" Inigo greeted as he approached his bro. "What's up man? Trying to meet Endeavor and get his signature?"

Hifumi nodded, not taking his eyes off the number one hero. "Yeah, been looking for a chance but he's been swarmed this whole time."

Inigo didn't really understand what's so great about Endeavor when Popsy was rumored to be somewhere in the arena. He grinned and cracked his knuckles. "Want me and Gigan to help clear a path for you? We can get you front-row access no problem." 

Hifumi just chuckled and waved him off. "Nah I got this one solo. By the way, how're you feeling after your match?"

"Bro, it was brutal. Now I know how you felt in our team battles." Inigo said, giving Hifumi a pat on the back.

"You did what you had to do to win, bro. I know it couldn't have been easy."

Inigo sighed. "Yeah, I've been looking for her. I'm worried. Wonder if she's upset at me for winning."

"I'm sure she doesn't blame you," Hifumi said reassuringly. "Just be there for her now, that's what matters. Did you know we're cousins? I saw her in the east exit lockers earlier."

"Nope that's new to me, and damn, I must've missed her. Thanks for the tip. I'll head back." 

Hifumi nodded just as the crowd thinned and Endeavor moved through the halls towards them.

"Bro! Now's your chance! I'll see ya in the finals man! Tell Hailey, I'm gonna give her a great match," Inigo said as he took off.

"Heh. You can tell her yourself, man!" Hifumi grinned and stepped out of the corner to get a moment with his hero. "And good luck!" 

Another crowd of fans moved to block him.


####VI. Eastern Hall

Inigo hurried to the east lockers. He had searched that place thoroughly. How had he missed her? Gigan fluttered with concern behind him as he peeked inside the empty room. "Hey Hoge, you here?" Nothing. As he turned to leave, he caught the familiar scent of lavender and eucalyptus - it was her aromatherapy spray. 

Inigo raised a brow, recognizing the familiar scent. He aligned his sense of smell with Gigan and decided to follow it.

The scent trail led out of the locker room and towards the upper levels of the stadium. Inigo followed it up flights of stairs and down corridors until he arrived at the VIP section. The faint fragrance eventually disappeared but he was confident his heart would lead him right to her. The red-carpeted hall was empty and lined with doors to private booths. All of them were open except one.

Inigo hesitated for a moment, then knocked softly on the suite's door. "Hoge? Are you in there?"

***

Hoge had hurried away from the lockers, unable to face Inigo or any of her classmates after her loss. She knew she had little chance of beating Inigo, but some small, foolish part of her had hoped for a miracle. Now she just felt sick and ridiculous.

Blindly, she made her way up to one of the vacant VIP balconies with wide glass windows that overlooked the arena below. She needed to be alone. The loud crowd under her drowned out the words in her head. As she sank into a plush chair, the full weight of her failure crashed down on her. Hot, angry tears spilled down her cheeks. She was letting everyone down - her friends, her teachers, herself. Most of all, she hated that a small, resentful part of her had wanted Inigo to lose. What was wrong with her?

A soft knock interrupted her miserable thoughts.  She didn't want him to see her like this. She half-shouted her words so he could hear her through her quirk. "Please, just go," she choked out. "I don't want to talk."

But Inigo didn't leave. Instead, he sat down behind the door, leaning against it.  "I see.. then. I'll just stay here for a while. Did you hear the crowd during our match? They were going wild. We did pretty well, right? I don't think any of them will forget your name anytime soon." 

She stayed quiet.

"Did I do okay? I really hated going up against you. I wouldn't mind never doing that again."

Hoge turned away, wrapping her arms around herself. I don't deserve it, she thought mournfully. I'm awful for wanting you to lose. You were only doing what I made you promise.

"You know you can talk to me. If you feel sad about something, you can share it with me. Otherwise, what's the point of me being your boyfriend?"

Slowly Hoge's resistance crumbled. Inigo's steady voice was like a lifeline, easing her hurt. She rose and put a tentative hand on the door, wishing she could see his kind eyes despite being unable to look him in the face.

At that, Hoge slowly opened the door. Inigo stood up and folded her into his arms without a word. She clung to him, sighing with relief. Here, held safe against his heart, the darkness inside her couldn't touch this moment. As if sensing her inner turmoil, Inigo held her tighter. "You're amazing, Hoge. I believe in you, no matter what."

His unwavering faith brought fresh tears to her eyes. She clung to him, letting the steady beat of his heart soothe away her doubts, even if just for this moment. She was too conflicted to confess the truth, but here in his arms, she could pretend that she did belong. Afterward, she would work hard to prove to herself that she deserved to be here, but that was later. 

Outside the suite's one-way windows, camera flashes lit up the arena grounds and the crowd roared. But inside, in their own private balcony, Hoge and Inigo held each other close.

####VII. Bonus Scene

Kaga sank into a deep lunge, feeling the burn in his thighs as he held the position. 10...11...12... He counted off in his head, embracing the fatigue flooding his muscles. A few more reps and he'd be ready. He threw several punches into the air. Gotta be faster! Stronger! 

*HYAAA!*

The small locker room was empty except for him. The rest of Class 1-E had already fought and lost their tournament matches. Now it all came down to him, the last fighter remaining from his class. Gritting his teeth, Kaga powered through another set of knuckle push-ups. His limbs trembled with exertion. Good, he thought. The more tired I am, the stronger I'll get. That was the bizarre logic of his Quirk - Fatigue Boost.

Ever since the tournament brackets were announced, Kaga had been training non-stop to fight against members of the vaunted Class 1-D. Those arrogant punks thought they were so much better than 1-E. They were in the "Hero Course" too! 

Kaga switched to air squats, the burn searing his quads. Sweat dripped down his neck. His babyface was flushed red with exertion, brown eyes blazing with determination. A buzzer sounded, signaling the one-minute warning. Kaga downed an energy drink, the sugar and caffeine only amplifying his trembling exhaustion. He felt dangerous, feral - a cornered beast ready to strike.

As he exited the locker room toward the arena, a confident grin split Kaga's round face. 

*Sensei, watch over me and guide my strikes. And please bless me by letting me get taller if I win.*

He walked towards the arena. He couldn't wait to surprise the world and put class 1-D in their place. The last match of the first round was his to win. It didn't matter how "cute" or "harmless" he looked - he'd show them the power of Fight Man!
