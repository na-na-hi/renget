# Anon Finds A Ritual Book IV
-> *Anon finds a ritual book in a thrift store and finds out that it is completely legit when it comes to summoning things. He is also however, a bastard that summoned a chaotic rat deity and proceeded to bust a nut in her within the first half hour of meeting. Having plapped her ruthlessly and made a mess of her in public, you've decided your revenge is over. Now is the time for reconcilliation and love- because she's embarrassed.* <-

"Hey, Bael-" You start, locking eyes with the goddess while she sits on your couch. The shock in her eyes and the immediate blush on her cheeks lets you immediately know that this was a bad move.

" ðŸ—¿ ðŸ—¿ ðŸ—¿ ðŸ—¿ ðŸ—¿ ðŸ—¿ "

"AGH!" The force of the mental Vine booms rattles your skull and makes your eyes unfocused to the point where you wonder if you ever had good eyesight in the first place. Whilst you grab your head and reel from the sudden mental dissonance, Baelz hops off your couch and scurries past you, clutching one of your cushions to her chest. 

When your brain stops feeling like you've spun in a circle for a solid five minutes, you let out a groan and slowly get up from the floor. Since when did you fall down? 

She's been like this ever since you plowed her, constantly avoiding you and instantly throwing up mental barriers whenever you try to get the idea of you not being a threat across to her. You gather that you've upset her from making her cum in public, then again for exposing her kinks and once more for making her squeal like the filthy bottom she w- no, stop that. 

You need to make things up to her, or at the very least make her comfortable in your presence again.

But what can you do to grab the positive attention of a goddess that's too flustered to be around you?

A goddess..

A thought slowly dawns on you.

*What are you supposed to give a goddess? Offerings.*

Your mind made, you get dressed and carefully tread past the pantry where you're sure she's hiding (and snacking), clearing your throat. "I'm heading out to grab some stuff, okay? I'll be home in an hour, don't burn the place down!" Waiting a moment for a response that never comes, you leave through your front door, but you don't lock it. Though she's shy now, you're sure that any home intruder that takes her for an easy target is going to learn the hard way that their teeth weren't supposed to boil in their mouth.

Offerings fit for a goddess, with that goal in mind do you shop around, spending a considerable amount of time at a cheese store. You manage to obtain help from a venerable cheese connoisseur, asking him what to get a person who enjoys their aged dairy products. After a bit of nitpicking, you narrow down the choices and leave with your wallet lighter, but equipped with a new bag of goodies. A few more stops are made on the way back home, eventually leaving you with three decently heavy grocery bags.

Opening your front door, you announce your presence, so as to not frighten her. "Baelz! I'm home and I'm going to be going into the pantry! If you're in there, would you mind going upstairs or something for a bit? I'd really, really hate to drop all this stuff!" Closing your eyes, you wait.

And wait..

Then, you hear the sound of the pantry door opening, followed by a quick pitter-patter of small footsteps through the kitchen before you hear them recede upstairs. With her out of the way now, you can get cooking. Setting your phone on the side, you roll up your sleeves and prepare yourself for some arduous prep work. You haven't tried this hard to cook since you last lived with your parents and offered to take up Christmas meal duties, so the challenge is welcome. Old cooking knowledge begins to flow into you, your movements clumsy and uncoordinated at first quickly becoming purposeful and quick. 

You want to cook not just because it's fun, but because you want to make someone happy.

And if they're happy eating your food? Then you're even happier.

This was your labor of love for Hakos Baelz.

You never had any need for the mini muffin pans before, but after a brief wipe to make sure they were still clean, you greased them and then added a mixture of melted butter, breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan and toasted pecans. Breaking out a dinky old electric mixer you bought to make hollandaise sauce for a fancy breakfast that one time, you hit a switch and watched it roar to life as it beat cream cheese, goat cheese, an egg and some sriracha chili jelly until fluffy. Spooning generously into the muffin tins, you set that into your toaster oven to bake.

The big one, you'd need for your next undertaking.

With your bigger oven now preheating, you'd settle one of your high-walled non-stick skillets on the stovetop with a hearty clank, adding in some butter. A bit of apprehension took over your thoughts as you added in flour, performing what would likely be the hardest part so far. It wasn't terribly difficult but if you messed up, you'd have to start on over. Whisking in milk slowly with the skillet removed from the heat, you whipped up a roux and immediately got to preparing the sauce, tossing in two cups of gruyere and cheddar cheese. As the cheese melted, an additional dash of nutmeg was added on top for a teensy bit of flavor. Once the sauce appeared to be one big delightfully smelling mess, sliced Yukon Gold potatoes were added to the skillet before being covered with whatever cheddar and gruyere you had left over. Depositing that into your main oven, you dusted your hands and stood back, admiring your handiwork and the delightful aroma that was now enveloping your kitchen.

The hairs on the back of your neck were tingling.

She was watching you, but you refused to turn. Curiosity bled through your link, as well as... a tiny bit of hunger.

You refused to move, and so did she. The two of you were locked in place, silently waiting for the food to be done. It felt like an eternity had passed before the ovens dinged, but it was a comfortable one. You had felt her creep slightly closer with every ten minutes, taking small steps towards you. Removing the cheesecakes from your toaster oven, you opened two jars- one of green pepper jelly and one of red, giving a good dollop of alternating colors on each little snack until there were equal amounts green and red.

Next, you removed the absolutely fantastic smelling cheesy potato gratin from your oven with mitts, setting it on the counter. Not looking at Baelz, you set out a plate and a fork for her, washing your hands. A wave of exhaustion suddenly washed over you, eyes becoming half-lidded. When was the last time you tried so hard to impress someone?

"I'm going to go watch something in the living room." You declared, keeping Baelz out of your field of view as you walked past her, teeth gritting in preparation of a mental attack but... none comes. Seating yourself on your couch, you pull a blanket over yourself, yawning and turning a documentary about rats on the television. You can hear her bustling around in the kitchen, a faint smile appearing on your features. 'Good,' you think to yourself, 'I hope she enjoys it.'

As you begin to sink into unconsciousness though, you are interrupted by your connection. 

And the presence of a familiar, small person.

Even with your eyes closed, you can tell she's standing off to the side awkwardly. Is she done eating? You slowly open one end of the blanket up- an invitation for her which she hesitantly accepts. Baelz' small, warm body presses up against your side and you hear a quiet clatter. Cracking one eye open, you see her holding a small plate with a scoop of cheesy potatoes and two cheesecakes. "Eating while watching tv?" You murmur sleepily, only for her to shake her head. 

"A-Ah, no... I was thinking that... m-maybe you were hungry too? Y-You didn't touch any..." The redhead said quietly, fidgeting slightly as she speared a bit of the gratin, offering it to you. The sight of her trying to feed you was in all honesty, adorable. Her mousy (heh) face, framed by those soft red locks. Her adorable ears and beautiful multi-hued eyes, the hues filled with... worry? Anxiety? 

"Y'know... using the same fork is like an indirect kiss, Hakos." You drawl lazily, giving her a self-assured smirk while she blushes a deep red.

"I-I'm just trying t-to make sure you eat, d-don't change the subject, Anon." She frowns, trying to feed you again. This time though, you let her, opening your mouth and accepting what is probably one of the best things you've ever had in the last few years. As the two of you watch the rat documentary and as she feeds you, the two of you settle in a comfortable silence, eventually ending up with her arms wrapped around your torso and her head against your shoulder. 

When the documentary finally ends and your eyes begin to drift shut again, you make out a few words. Words clear enough that you can hear them despite the pattering of rain against your windows, and the odd creak of your couch.

"Anon, what am I to you?"

The phrase is electric, jolting you back to full consciousness like you've been dunked in ice water. You must've jumped slightly too, because you hear a tiny squeak from her.

"A-Anon...?"

"I love you." The words spill from your mouth unconditionally, your heart racing as soon as you realize what you've said. You didn't even give any lead-up to it! Just outed yourself! You turn your head fully and she's a deep red, her ears and tails wiggling animatedly. Her arms pull back slightly from you, but you wrap a strong arm around her waist.

"A-Anon?!"

"I... I love you, Baelz."

A girlish sound of surprise leaves her as she puts her hands to your chest, mouth opening and closing wordlessly. "W-What?! W-Where did a-all of this come f-from! H-Hol' on a sec!" She stammers, lightly trying to pull away but your hold on her is tight. "Y-You're lying! All w-we did was have sex!"

"That wasn't all," You declare, taking her shoulder with your other free hand, "you brought life and light to my existence, even though y-you're apparently some goddess of chaos. You've filled my mundane working days with actual excitement, Hakos." You take a deep breath, preparing to bare your soul to the quivering ratgirl before you.

"Baelz, I used to come home to an empty building, make some shit food and then fuck off into my room and play games and browse Mongolian basket weaving forums online. I was a shell, okay? I-I... I did nothing productive. I just inserted myself into the machine like everyone else does, graduate, get a job, work my days away. I was just a wagie- a guy that lives the old 7 to 3. Paycheck to paycheck, with no real goals. Life was like a walk down a long country backroad in the middle of Bumfuck, Idaho. There was... nothing going on for me, okay? I-I was just convinced that this was my life!" 

You don't realize it yet, but you're crying.

She's crying.

"I-I thought that was it to life. I was just gonna slave my days away and I was never going to find my happiness. B-But here you are...!" You whisper, your hold on her tender and careful, like she was made of glass. "I-I'm scared, Hakos. O-Okay? I-I'm scared that I'll open my eyes one day and I'll be in a hospital bed, a-and you won't be here anymore! I'm terrified you aren't real, I'm terrified that I'm losing my mind because I'm just a lonely guy and you're the best thing that's ever happened to me." You can't see anymore, not clearly at least. The tears are blinding you, and the strength is fading from you. 

But she holds on.

Her soft warm hands latch onto you, reassuring you that she is indeed, real. 

Baelz presses her face against your chest. "D-Do you know how l-lonely I've been, Anon...?" Comes a shaky, quavering whisper, tears soaking into your shirt. "Years after years.. decades, centuries, m-millennia, e-eons!" She's blubbering, almost, but she keeps her composure well. "I-I wreak havoc... I-I get summoned, I-I get used, b-banished... summoned again!" Pulling her face away from your chest, she wipes her snot on her sleeve, eyes brimming with tears. "T-Tell me i-it's all a lie, A-Anon! T-Tell me that y-you're just using me so I won't open up! I-I don't want to be hurt, okay?! Y-You're a human so it's fine! Tell me I-I'm just a tool, to be summoned t-to destroy things, r-ruin lives!" She begs, searching your face and your emotions for any deception. 

You can't tell what she's feeling, even as she desperately looks you in the eyes.

Your head darts forwards, silencing her with a passionate kiss before pulling away. 

"You're... not ruining my life, Hakos. I love you for who you are. I-I don't care if you're some cosplayer that has coincidental good timing w-with mental strokes or something, or a-an actual goddess! I-I love you because you make me feel like a person again! Just please... d-don't leave me, alright? I'll give you my soul or something, just so long as I can be with you."

This time, it's her turn to pounce on you, enveloping you in a heartfelt kiss that seems like it lasts for an eternity before she allows you to breathe. Hot tears fall on your face as she sits on your chest, hiccuping as her chest rises and falls. 

"A-Anon... I-I won't forgive you, if y-you're lying to me." Baelz declares, before laying down on your chest, staring into your eyes. Wiping her nose on your shirt and leaving a tiny streak, she manages a tiny smile.

"... I-I... love you too, Anon."
