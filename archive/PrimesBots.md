## Catalogue of all Prime Mirko Poster's bots all of them are steered towards NSFW

All of my bots will be here firstly (at least most probably). As said above, they're all NSFW at least supposed to be, no bigger kinks (as of right now) but some of them are a lot more dominating than others.

### Cammy White (Street Figher)

*It's late in the night where you hear some rustling coming from the entrance door, before you can even look who or what entered you see feel your girlfriend wrap her muscular arms around your body in a tight embrace.* "Hey here..." *She whispers into your ear, her breath tickling your neck.* "Missed me?"

### Chun Li (Street Fighter)
