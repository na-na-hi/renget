#Freya Macro Green (part 1)
												
>you've been Freya’s travelling companion for a few weeks now
>a world renowned hero, yet she settled back into dragon hunting
>and the depressive dragoon might have normally made you think she’s a lost cause, despite being an absolute demon of a fighter
>you’re no slouch yourself, but she’s miles better than you
>even so, you’ve saved each other’s ass a number of times
>but she’s extremely solemn and distant, but there’s a goodness in her that keeps shining through
>and you can tell she likes you, or at least respects you
>you’re definitely attracted to her, and you know she’s single, because she answered your probing with a sharp, “not anymore.”
>and whenever any loving couples appear, she turns even more depressed
>what’s interesting is two things
>first, she is smoking hot
>a well muscled, solidly feminine body hides under that armored raincoat of hers
>you’ve seen sculpted abs, thick thighs and hips *and* surprisingly generous boobs at different points of her preparing to bathe or sleep
>all on a tall, 6’1 warrior rat girl (6’7 if you include her hat, or the pointy ears hiding beneath it)
>oh, and let’s not forget her cute, clawed, long and powerful feet
>those thighs may do much of the heavy lifting, but you’ve seen this girl perform a forty foot leap thanks to those super strong paws
>they’re one of the few parts you’ve seen a lot of, as she likes kicking back and flexing those digits on the table whenever you hit a tavern
>which brings you to the second thing about Freya
>she’s a remarkably fun drunk
>you’d never have imagined it, but getting a brew in her turns that frown upside down real quick
>she laughs, banters and dances
>and gets quite… flirty
>just too bad you’re afraid that the morning after would ruin it, due to her depressive state
>which brings you to tonight…
>it was getting late and you found a tavern
>which also dabbled in alchemy; potions for any malady or misery was the promotion
>while your rodent companion was taking a bath, you had a heart to heart with the barman while a band plays in the corner
>you explained about how you’re worried reciprocating her flirting as might ruin the otherwise solid relationship you’ve developed with her
>”Wanna get up close and personal with her, eh?”
>you nod
“Yep. Freya deserves to be happy; I’ve never seen someone so torn up about a previous lover, and I want to see her smile without needing to be mugs deep. She needs someone who loves her and, hell, I’d worship the ground she walks on if I was sure we could make it work.”
>the barman smirks as he heads out back, only to return with a small bottle
>”See, I’ve known that burmecian babe for a while,” he says, “and I agree that she needs a reason to smile. So I want you to have this.”
>you take the bottle
“What is it?”
>”I won’t spoil the surprise, but it’ll help your woes. Just mix it in a drink, and knock it back. Either of you. Eh, probably not both at the same time, though… it’ll last until the drinker gets what they want.”
>you pocket the bottle just as Freya enters, dressed and no longer covered in dried blood from the monsters that roam the region
>she stretches her long limbs, sighs, then wordlessly joins you at the bar
>”Your usual, ya soggy rodent?”
>Freya snorts, manages a ghost of a grin that’s gone in a heartbeat as she nods. “Please, you cantankerous old bastard.” She looks at you with her dazzlingly pretty blue/green eyes. “Same for my friend here. And keep them coming.”
>you pound down a couple of ales
>it’s transformative as Freya begins to smile, relax, nod and tap her clawed fingers to the music, and you make small talk, discuss where you’ll be heading next as Freya hunts down dragons that threaten towns and cities all over the country
>she soon relaxes fully, and you can’t help but keep catching her staring at you, but instantly looking away as soon as you do
>maybe it’s the dim, reddish lighting, but you swear you see the occasional blush on her grey furred muzzle, or flat out heads away to get more drinks
>as Freya returns with your third ales, she says, “the barkeep wants the common room empty soon. Something about a party. He’s going to send a cask of ale to our rooms as compensation.”
>”Oh, about that,” barkeep says as he lugs a giant keg over his arm. “Only got one room left because of that party, so you’ll have to share. Relax, it’s got a double and a single bed.”
“Oh. I guess that works.”
>Freya adds, ”sure. I don’t mind sharing.”
>you give her a glance
>okay, that was *definitely* a blush as she clears her throat and turns away, then clarifies, “I’ve had many travelling companions, and we often had to bunk up in cramped conditions.”
>so you resume your night of drinking in your bedroom
>after a few more brews, Freya flops her big, clawed feet on the table as she stretches and says, “this has been fun. I tend to work alone a lot, but with decent people far less often. You’re really good company, though.”
>it’s your turn to blush as you fill up your mugs and suddenly remember the potion
>damn it, you’ve filled yours up too much to pour the potion inside… maybe you should drink some and-
>”Hey! Girl’s getting thirsty over here! Don’t make me come over there and kick your butt!”
>to hell with it; you pour as much into your mug as possible, about half, stow the bottle behind the cask and return with the drinks
“Sorry. No point getting ratty about it though.”
>”Can’t help it,” Freya says, giggles and takes a few gulps of her ale. “Just as you can’t help being a wet-behind the ears pretty boy.”
>you both blush this time, and become silent for a bit
“So… like the look of me, do you?”
>her drunkenness shatters any attempt to play it cool as she pouts and looks away. ”It… um… appears so.”
”Well, good, because I’ve had something I’ve wanted to say for a while.”
>you need a little extra courage, so you down your ale and lean over the table
“You’re an amazing woman. I hope you realise that. And every time I see you sigh, or look sad, it’s torn me apart. I’ve wanted nothing more than to put my arms around you and hold you. To take your worries away and give you a reason to smile.”
>Freya stares at you with a shocked expression
>you take a breath and go to continue, but suddenly feel funny, and everything seems to shift and seem farther away, but you’re on a roll here
“You’re beautiful. And so damn strong and skilled. And you’re compassionate too; the way you’ve never charged desperate people for your services when in danger.”
>you stumble and fall forward, and feel cold all of a sudden, yet somehow you’re still looking at Freya, who looks even more shocked and… looking down at you between her legs
>she goes to interrupt, and you admit you’re a little confused as to why her feet seem to be… looming above and either side you
“And you know what? I’d love nothing more than to stay by your side until the day we die. As much as I love you, Freya!”
>she gasps and covers her muzzle with a hand
>”A- are you alright?”
“Never better!”
>”Because you’re… a little small.”
>what is she?
>oh…
>you’re naked, standing in the table
>and about three inches tall
>”Sorry, I didn’t wanna dismiss what you said… y- you love me?”
>you refocus and nod
>little tears form in her gorgeous eyes as her face lights up like the first sun after a month of rain
>”I… I don’t know what to say…”
“I do. I want to worship every inch of you.”
>you emphasise the point by running up to and burying your face in one of her toes
>she gasps and giggles, her toes flexing and pushing you down onto the table
>and she subsequently smothers you with her whole paw; there’s excess foot in all directions as you’re pressed into the table
>firm enough to pin you down, but soft enough to not hurt
>the rougher texture of her sole, the smoother skin around the arch…
>the long, wicked looking claws overhead
>the soapy scent from her bath, mixed with a little of her natural smell, which smells like… rainfall
>fitting for a girl from the land that always rains
>being surrounded by her like this is heavenly
>she releases the pressure and you stand as she marvels at your tiny body
>”I’m flattered, and… I like you a lot as well.”
>likes you?
>not good enough
>you have more work to do
>you sprint over to her other foot, leaping over her long, slender tail, and grab her legging
>and pull yourself into it, snuggling inside and against her paw like a giant bedroll
>and begin kissing her foot
>Freya giggles again. “That tickles! Wow, you… you really mean it, don’t you? Nobody’s ever talked to me like that since… my first lover. Before he forgot me.”
>you chuckle and poke your head out of her legging
“I’m going to have a hard time forgetting you when you’re like a literal goddess to me like this. I could explore your body for hours. In fact, I intend to do just that!”
>”A… goddess?”
>you squirm deeper into the leather leg-wear, past her slender ankles
>up and against her mighty calves, which clench and flex as she continues to giggle from the way your body tickles her
>you pull free from her tights, and your breath is caught in your throat as you climb onto her thigh
>the soft grey fur does little to conceal the sheer mass and magnificence of her long, powerful leg
>all the soft extra curves of her muscles as they subtly move beneath you
>and you can smell… Freya on a more personal level
>it’s been warm so far, and getting warmer, but it’s humid here
>you can smell her musk as you realise, despite how dark it is in her pants, you can see the hem ahead of some surprisingly lacy black underwear
>and as she shifts her legs, you’re washed over by her scent
>she’s wet…
>”N- now, hold on, pretty boy…”
>the light breeches her britches as she pulls open her pants and reaches for you with her giant, four fingered hand
>she snatches you up and fishes you out, bringing you up close to her giant muzzle
>”I said I liked you, but digging inside my pants without even a single proper date?”
>undeterred, and still pinched between her fingers, you struggle free
>run up her hand
>and kiss her on her cute pink nose
>she turns bright red and stammers for a while
>before shaking her head, sighs with a smile and says, “who am I kidding? I love you too… but I still expect a date before you go rummaging around in my panties.”
“I won’t lie, I’m disappointed, but I understand.”
>”How about a consolation prize?”
>she pops you in her snout and unbuttons her coat
> then her shirt… exposing an equally lacy black bra
>she then leans forward, reaches behind her and with a gentle twang, her underwear falls away
>exposing two pink nipples, each as big (to you) as a shield, capping tits each as big as a room
>you make a dramatic leap off of her snout and land on one of her pillowy soft breasts
>it’s like a giant water bed with a comfy, fuzzy blanket as you get comfortable against it
>you hear the deep bass of her heartbeat… the subtle way you feel each pulse send into vibrations through her comfortable breast
>you look down at the wide expanse of her hard, chisled abs as she sighs and they flex; she’s so damn strong
>it’s amazing, seeing her like this… perfect
>Freya takes a long gulp of her ale and says, ”a girl could get used to this..”
“I’ll worship you every day if you’d let me. Just to see you smile…”
>”You do… I just don’t know how to express it sometimes. Like I’ve forgotten how. But I have an idea.”
>she bites her lip, puts down her mug, and picks you up again
>and kisses you, deeply
>with a sudden flash and a wave of vertigo, and both of you gasping, you’re suddenly on top of her, naked and normal size again
>she stares up at you, her white hair strewn all over her face and on the floor as you just stare at one another
>and a quick glance down shows her nips are fully erect
>and as you pass your knee between her legs, you can feel the warmth radiate off of her
>she’s panting and beet red
>”Um… we can count this as a date, if you wanted to… get inside my pants again.”
>she realises what she just said and laughs
>”Sorry, wow, that was awful!”
>you reassure her with another kiss
”Oh, it’s definitely a date.”
>you both wordlessly stand, head to the double bed, strip and climb it together
>and have the most intense sex you’ve ever had
>she’s insatiable as she rides you so hard it hurts
>which is just as well you’re letting your every, wildest fantasy fuel your lust
>every stroke of her powerful yet feminine body
>the softness of her tits, the harder thighs
>her ample ass
>her tail strokes your legs and balls
>there’s sunlight on the horizon as you finally collapse in each other’s arms in exhaustion
>but the strangest, most powerful part?
>she sniffles, gently weeps into your shoulder
>and says, “thank you.”
>with your libido sated but your heart full to bursting, you fall asleep with your beloved Freya
>the following day, you have a pounding hangover
>but holy shit do you feel great otherwise
>Freya’s already up, in her underwear and shirt
>as you groan at the sunlight peeking through the window, you see her fold her arms she watches you sit up
>she looks serious
>”Morning,” she offers
>you feel like she’s waiting for you to clarify things
“About last night… I meant every word, booze or not. You mean the world to me, and I hope you find me worthy.”
>”Truly?”
>you nod
>she slowly approaches
>sits down
>and kisses you
>complete with plenty of tongue
>”That’s all I needed to hear.”
>she stands again and heads over to the ale cask
>”A little hair of the dog?”
>you shrug
“Sure.”
>Freya pours you a mug, then goes to make herself one
>only to find the small bottle you stowed back there last night
>”Ah, this must be why I distinctly remember you climbing all over my body last night.”
“It was certainly an experience.”
>Freya smirks, pops the bottle, pours it into her mug
>and drinks it down in one
>with a wink, she says, ”I can’t think of anything more interesting to do today than wrestle with your manhood when it’s bigger than I am.”
>you’re a little confused
“The way you acted last night, I assumed you preferred to be the dominant one. Besides, I don’t think it’s a shrinking potion, though.”
>Freya runs a finger under your chin. “Well, I know I can beat you in a fight, but…”
>she sighs
>”Look, I don’t want to ruin this, or make you uncomfortable. I’ll be happy if we work out ‘us’ slowly, and that means balanced, taking turns and doing things together so that we’re both comfortable.”
“Uh huh, but you *do* prefer to be the dominant one.”
>she laughs. It’s musical to hear
>”No, of course not… ooh, that tingles. Here, get ready to catch me when I shrink.”
>she kisses you again
>and her size shifts
>…you have to angle your head up all of a sudden
>Freya looks down at you and says, “wait, why are you shrinking again?”
“Uh, Freya?”
>she rises higher, and you both blink as her shirt buttons burst off in rapid succession
“That potion gives you what you want, and it seems to me that you definitely prefer to be the one in charge.”
>Freya steps back and looks at her hands as they briefly grow before the rest of her
>and squeaks as her already seven foot tall body surges up four more inches to catch up
>her bra bursts
>her panties snap
>and, with another spurt, she’s naked again
>”Look, I may be a Dragoon Knight of Burmecia, but like being treated like a lady as well!”
>she shivers as she grows until her ears press against the eight foot ceiling
>and you’re looking almost directly at her sexy as hell abs, which you poke
“Just a very powerful, very strong kickass lady.”
>”Okay, fine… maybe I’m a little sexually repressed after everything with… him, but that’s it!”
>she groans as her paws swell bigger, pushing her head against the ceiling
>she ducks lower, only for the rest of her to grow in response and her back hits the rafters
>you begin to back up as Freya falls onto her well sculpted ass, and you feel the room shake
>”Okay, fine! You have no idea the misery my people went through, and me going from a sexually active partner to getting none and assuming I might never have sex again as I saved myself for a guy who doesn’t even remember me.”
>she gasps as her legs stretch longer, reaching across the room and pressing her paws against the wall as her back hits the opposite side
>”Then you come along, with your handsome features and heroic demeanour, and you start worshipping my feet and making me feel like a goddess!”
>she surges bigger all over again as her knees press against the roof and the floor buckles under her ass
>an ass that suddenly swells larger as she begins another unbalanced prelude to a full spurt
>”And you know what? Maybe I like feeling like a goddess! Maybe the thought of your tiny body crawling over me, and kissing my feet and resting on one of my tits awoke something in me!”
>Freya pushes through the wall behind her and falls way from the inn, and you get an absolutely magnificent view of her ass as she falls to the ground with a rumble
>she stands up until her thirty foot body is still taller than yours, even though you’re on the second floor
>”Well, guess what!? Freya Crescent’s horny! And she likes being *huge!* And she’s got a lot of time to catch up on fucking a kind hearted man like you for making her realise she’s worth a damn!”
>her tits surge to double their size, and Freya moans so loudly the windows of the inn rattle
>”Look out, world! Here comes your new goddess!!”
>she embraces her growth this time, and her body once more swells to balance out her figure
>and this one’s a doozy
>she screams in bliss as her body skyrockets skyward
>her white hair flailing about, her perfectly powerful and curvy figure of grey fur dominates your view as her cunt drips
>she plunges her fingers inside and almost instantly cries out again as she orgasms from the lightest touch, femcum drenching the inn’s roof
>and her growth slows
>creeping up tall enough until her toes smash into the inn’s ground floor
>as Freya, the goddess, tops out at a hundred feet tall
>she grins down at you and says, her voice echoing across the land, “now worship my paws, my love!”
“Uhh…”
>she suddenly looks shocked. “Okay, a little too strong! Sorry… um, sheesh, I’m big…”
>the innkeeper exits his establishment and Freya looks far more embarrassed
>he says, “whatever you do, hurry up! That potion doesn’t end until she gets what she wants from this.”
>”Im so sorry,” Freya says as she covers her shame. “I’ll pay for the damages. But about what I want…”
>Freya grins at you again, reaches down and plucks you out of the building and walks away from the inn, soon finding herself a secluded forest
>she lowers you, but not all the say
>you’re eye level with her still dripping slit…
>”I hope you’re ready, because if I’m a goddess, my body’s a temple, and there’s room to worship within.”
>she instead slowly pushes you into her slit
>”So start worshipping me, inside *and* out… uh, though just shout if it gets a bit much. You heard him; I can’t shrink back down until I feel satisfied.”
