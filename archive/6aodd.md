#***Another Legiana Lewd***
---
\>Another day in the Coral Highlands. You honestly doubt that you could ever get tired of this place, given how beautiful and exotic it was.

\>Having decided to take some "you" time away from the hustle and bustle of Astera, you'd gone out on an expedition to relax the kind of way only a hunter could - with some casual hunting and living off the land. And that was exactly what you'd done that late afternoon as you slung the body of the Shamos you'd hunted over your shoulders and slowly made your way back to camp, keeping an eye out for any larger monsters that might have wanted your kill.

\>Still, you weren't expecting such a ruckus to suddenly kick up some distance away, sounding undoubtedly like two monsters slugging it out. Dropping the corpse and pulling your weapon out as you cautiously jog towards the sound, you crest the hill and crouch down behind some coral as you spot a Legiana and a Pink Rathian duking it out in a territorial dispute, talons kicking and wings flailing.

\>The first thing you notice is that the Legiana is particularly small for its kind, almost unusually so. It was also thin to an unhealthy-looking degree, likely from a prolonged lack of food. Probably the runt of the clutch, it still put up an attempt to defend itself from the Pink Rathian, although it seemed to be losing badly - a point driven home when the Rathian swings its tail and smacks the Legiana out of the air with enough force to make you cringe.

\>Shakily getting to its feet as the Rathian screeches at it to get lost, the Legiana slowly limps away, dragging one of its wings along the ground as its head hangs low in defeat. You feel sorry for the poor thing, but this was just nature taking its course, and it wasn't your place to intervene. Sheathing your weapon, you sneak away and retrieve your Shamos before continuing back to camp.

\>However, as you get close to home, you start to notice strange tracks along the ground. A closer look reveals them to be Legiana footprints, but also signs of a dragging wing, making you curious as to why the poor runt you'd seen earlier would come this way. You can't help but follow them, not just out of curiosity but because the tracks also follow the same path you're taking back to camp. Eventually, a few minutes away from where your tent is set up, the tracks lead you to a coral overhang with a dark recess underneath.

\>Peering in, some of your scoutflies emerge from their cage on your belt, lighting up the nook with a soft green glow and revealing none other than the runty Legiana you'd seen get its ass handed to it, huddled pitifully in the back. Upon noticing you, it lets out a weak, challenging cry, struggling to stand and defend itself, but it collapses and lets out a distraught huff of air, heaving for breath as its body trembles.

\>You have no idea why it would try to hide here, so close to your camp - most monsters steered clear of a hunter's camp, knowing the dangers that lurked within - and yet, here it was. Did it think it would be safer here? That monsters wouldn't get close? That your presence in the area would somehow protect it as it tried to recover?

\>Unfortunately, it looked like recovery wasn't going to be an option for the poor thing. As your scoutflies trace over it's sleek white-and-azure body, you notice several bleeding punctures in it's bad wing, the crimson blood mixed with a toxic purple substance. The hit it had taken from the Pink Rathian had poisoned it, undoubtedly, but most monsters could usually shrug it off after a while. This runt looked so small and weak, though, that by your estimates the poor thing would be dead by sunrise.

\>That tore it for you. You normally wouldn't intervene with nature's course, but you'd experienced a Pink Rathian's poison firsthand, and you wouldn't wish that particularly lethal fate on your worst enemy. Thinking quickly, you withdraw from the nook and pull out several antidotes from your bag, popping the corks off each one and drizzling the blue liquid over the corpse of your Shamos, making sure that plenty soaks into the wounds you'd dealt to it to ensure a proper dosage. After drugging the corpse adequately, you drag it over to the nook and push it inside, going in after it and slowly, cautiously approaching the now-confused looking Legiana.

\>You slowly pull out your hunting knife, trying not to act threateningly, but the runt still thrashes and cries out again. It's movements are so weak by this point, however, that it can't really do anything to stop you, and eventually it stops as it tries to catch its breath again. Moving slowly, you carve off a small piece of the Shamos and hold it out near the Legiana with the tips of your fingers, it's brilliant golden eyes following your every move.

\>You hear it sniff a bit, and it slowly raises its head as it eyes the piece of meat you're holding, it's expression looking a bit...skeptical? Could monsters even be skeptical? Still, it was in no position to refuse a free meal, especially one offered in lieu of certain death, and its jaws open as it snatches the slice from your fingers and swallows it down, not even bothering to chew. You carve out another chunk and hold it out, and it repeats the motion, either oblivious to the fact that you'd laced it with antidote or simply too hungry to care.

\>Slowly, the shuddering in its body begins to subside, and you can tell what little strength it had before was slowly returning to its body, as it clambers up onto its legs again as best it could in the small space of the nook and eyes you with visible confusion. Figuring it could eat for itself now, you pull the rest of the Shamos corpse in front of you and offer it to the monster, slowly backing out of the nook as you hear sounds of it digging in, eager to continue its meal.

\>You sigh to yourself, not looking forward to the dinner of dry, tasteless rations ahead of you, but you supposed it was worth it for your good deed of the day as you head back to camp.

\>You swore you suddenly heard it shuffle partway out of the nook, as though it were watching you go, but the sun had gone down so much by this point that it was too dark for you to tell...though you weren't quite sure if that was a pair of glowing yellow eyes you saw for a split second before retreating.

\------------------------------------

\>You wake up the next day, feeling refreshed and ready for another bout of exploring. Still, you find your thoughts wandering back to the runty Legiana as you gather ingredients for breakfast. You knew the antidote had worked, and the sustenance from that Shamos corpse would be enough to keep it sustained for a day or two, but you couldn't help but wonder what fate awaited it. Sure, you'd helped it survive to see another day, but given the trouble it seemed to be having with that Pink Rathian, you weren't sure it would be able to continue living like that, constantly on the edge.

\>Thankfully, your worries end as soon as you leave the tent, when a odd-sounding trill pulls you out of your thoughts. Dumping all your ingredients on the ground, you go for your knife as you spin around and see...none other than the runty Legiana, perched on the ledge above your camp with its head tilted as it stares at you curiously.

\>This was incredibly odd behavior for a monster, no doubt, but it didn't seem like it was trying to be threatening in any way, so after a moment of staring each other down, you slowly sheathe the knife and hold your hands out to show that you aren't trying to pull anything. Shuffling its feet and wings a bit in response to this, it eventually spreads its large wings and floats down into the clearing of your camp, landing a bit roughly due to its weakened wing but still managing well enough despite it.

\>Now that it was daytime, you were finally able to get a good look at the Legiana, who continued to stare at you as you slowly paced around it, perhaps studying you as much as you were studying it. It's smooth white-and-azure hide, while beautiful, was far from flawless - scars both big and small criss-crossed it, reminders of the numerous battles for survival that it had no doubt had to endure. Even the trailing edge of its wing membrane was slightly tattered, though it seemed not to hinder her ability to fly from what you'd seen...and she was indeed a "her", after a quick peek under her tail as you pass behind her.

\>She seemed to not feel threatened by you very much, if at all, looking to be more curious than anything. Still, as interesting a situation as this was to both you and any potential researchers to catch wind of it, having a monster in your camp that wasn't your Barnos was a big no-no, so you tell her to shoo. She cocks her head at you again, looking a bit confused, before she flaps back up to her ledge and peers down at you as though waiting for you to do something.

\>Good enough, you guess, looking down at your now-dirty pile of breakfast supplies and sighing as you resign yourself to another meal of rations.

\>After gearing up, and deciding that today you wanted to gather some Tzitzi samples for some favor with the researchers back home, you head out in search of a footprint trail to follow...but it didn't take you long to realize that you were being followed yourself, as a shadow passes over you, "your" Legiana now following you in the air as you hike through the Highlands. You scowl as you look up at her, hovering in place in the air as she stares at you, but before you can yell at her to try and shoo her off again, you realize something.

\>Was...was she trying to help you track your prey?

\>Figuring it was worth a shot, you continue along until you find an unmistakable sign of a Tzitzi's passing, and looking up at the Legiana, you point at it and wait. Sure enough, she looks from you to the Tzitzi's trail a few times before letting out a cry and taking off ahead of you, prompting you to follow. Despite her small size, she's apparently still good at tracking prey, and with her leading you straight to the Tzitzi it only takes you a fraction of the time to find it than it would tracking it the old-fashioned way.

\>The Tzitzi looks up as you approach, weapon drawn, but before you can strike, your Legiana "companion" lets off another cry as it swoops down with its talons raised...and misses, as the Tzitzi dodges to the side and lets off a screech as its photophores begin charging. The Legiana shakily wheels around for another pass, and you rush the Tzitzi, hoping to stop what you knew what was about to happen, but you're just a little bit too slow. The blinding flash goes off and with a cry that sounds like it was just shot by a bowgun, the Legiana goes down in a heap and thrashes around as she tries to get her footing back.

\>Thankfully, you attack before the Tzitzi can take advantage of this, and the two of you scrap for a bit. Your Legiana shakes off the blinding effect after a moment and is quick to try and join back in, but her frantic and flailing movements get in the way of your attacks more often than not, and it isn't long before her efforts are rewarded with another blinding flash to her face as the Tzitzi zaps her again.

\>You let off an exasperated sigh. This was going to take a while.

\>Being an experienced hunter yourself, it isn't too hard taking the Tzitzi down even with your companion's "help", the beast eventually crying out before it fell over and stopped moving. As you sheath your weapon, your Legiana recovers from its most recent bout of blindness and lets off a half-hearted cry of victory before watching as you pull your knife out and begin carving some materials off, as well as some choice cuts of meat for later. Once done, you wipe the sweat off of your brow, only to notice that the Legiana seems to be a bit fidgety, looking from you to the corpse on the ground and back to you again.

\>You ask if she's still hungry from yesterday, gesturing at the body, and she perks up noticeably as though she understands you somehow. Figuring you don't need much else from the Tzitzi, you indicate that the body is all hers, and with an excited trill, she leaps upon it and starts pulling pieces off as she digs in. Her eagerness in the matter reminds you that, being so skinny and runty, she probably hasn't had a meal this big in a LONG time, and the fact that she "helped" you get it must have made it all the sweeter for her.

\>With nothing else to do for now, you watch her as she continues to eat and make excited sounds in between each bite, as though she were expressing how good it tasted. Her happy display actually makes the corner of your mouth turn up in a bit of a smile - she certainly proved that, while rough around the edges, she had her uses during a hunt.

\>Maybe, just maybe, it wouldn't be so bad keeping her around?

\>After the two of you head back to camp, and the sun dips low in the sky, you take a load off by the campfire as your new Legiana companion rests atop the ledge above your camp, though you can still tell by the glow of her remarkably bright yellow eyes that she's still watching you. 

\>Maybe she was somehow considering the situation like you were? It was apparent by this point that she seemed smarter than she looked, which would certainly make sense given that her species was the apex predator in the Highlands. You were also interested in seeing where this new companionship could possibly go, wondering if the two of you could become a real hunting duo if you nurtured the relationship and let it flourish. It was almost unheard of, a hunter teaming up with a monster, but hell, crazier things had happened. Why not give it a shot?

\>The first thing you do the next morning is send your Barnos back to Astera with a message tied to its leg, saying that you had stumbled across an interesting discovery and were extending your expedition "indefinitely" until you'd procured something concrete. With that out of the way, you dedicated the next few days to feeling your way around your new companionship with the Legiana, getting a feel for her limits and capabilities as much as you tried to express your own to her. Her tracking was already top-notch, given that she had razor-sharp eyesight and could get a birds-eye view of the Highlands virtually at will, so you start off by pitting the two of you against some roaming packs of Shamos to try and hone her fighting skills, telling her to stay put and watch as you fight them off, then having her fight them by herself to see how she'd handle it. This often resulted in her getting a bit over her head initially (as comical as it was seeing a Legiana get bowled over by a tiny Shamos, you were quick to kick them off of her before she was put in too threatening of a position), but eventually, you notice a tipping point: she starts getting better, reading their movements more accurately, going with the flow of the hunt more gracefully.

\>Despite her runty-ness, she's a quick learner, and it isn't long before the two of you are tackling bigger game. She learns her lesson with the Tzitzi's flashes before long, and her next encounter with the blinding monsters goes much more smoothly than the first. As the days pass, you begin to notice a particular trend with her fighting style, her movements starting to look surprisingly similar to yours. She seemed to be taking your combat style to heart and adapting it to the differing shape of her own body, stepping back to avoid an attack before quickly darting in with her long neck and sharp teeth to land a counterstrike, or using some footwork and a quick flap of her wings to reposition much like how you dodge-rolled under swinging tails and slicing claws.

\>As the days start turning into weeks, you also began to notice that her thin and malnourished body was starting to fill out. The constant supply of nutrient-rich food and the vigorous activity of your hunts was finally causing her to gain back a healthy amount of weight and muscle. It wasn't long before the runt of the clutch wasn't looking so runty anymore, and her stance had shifted from being weak and unsure to strong and confident. She was finally putting some real weight behind her attacks, and at one point even grabbed a troublesome Paolumu you'd both been hunting by the scruff of its neck with her talons, hurling it to the ground with devastating force and leaving it dizzy and helpless as you hacked away at it.

\>Things were also developing more in your camp. In addition to getting more of a "lived in" look as you settled in for the long haul, your Legiana companion had also started moving down from her perch above your campsite and spending some time curled up near the fire with you. It wasn't long before she started disappearing intermittently and returning with various materials gathered from the Highlands, using them to build herself a sort of nest next to your tent. As your victories began to pile up and your bond with her deepened, it started to become a common occurrence for you to either spend your downtime with her in her nest, or your nights sleeping in your tent with her head reaching all the way inside to rest on your lap, the two of you simply enjoying the closeness of each other's company.

\>For a while, things were going really well...then she started acting a bit strange.

\>It was little, harmless things at first - sometimes a playful nip or nuzzle, the occasional night where she acted a LOT more friendly than usual - and you brushed them off, but things only got worse from there. Harmless nuzzling started turning into shamelessly shoving her nose into your crotch and inhaling your scent before you shoved her off with a nervous laugh, or insistently pulling you in close with her wings and refusing to let you go, all the while rubbing her head against you and chirring in a way that sounded almost...amorous?

\>After a particularly draining snugglefest one night, you manage to pull yourself away from her after she falls asleep and dig out your hunter notes, searching for the Legiana entry and wondering what could possibly have her acting in such a way.

\>It doesn't take much reading to realize that you've fucked up big time.

\>As it turns out, hunting together, sharing territory and nesting space, and even bringing food home for each other were trademark behaviors of mated pairs of Legiana. All this time, you thought you were building up a close bond and friendship with a monster, when in actuality you were ALSO unwittingly wooing her to a fantastically successful degree.

\>So now you were in deep. Just how the hell would you go about letting her down gently? While you're certain she understood you fairly well, something that complex would probably go flying over her head. But even though you were human and had your own fair share of fetishes, there was no way you were going to fuck her. Legiana apparently mated for life, and besides that, she was a wild animal! One who was surprisingly intelligent and tame, sure, but still an animal. It was out of the question!

\>You sat there for a while, mulling things over and wondering how in the world you were to go about this, but nothing came to mind before you started getting tired, so you decided to hit the sack and think about it more tomorrow. Maybe if you just ignored her for a while, she'd knock it off and things would go back to how they were.

\------------------------------------

\>How wrong you were. Things came to a head the next morning when you awoke from a very sexy dream to the feeling of something long and wet being dragged across your crotch, and you open your eyes with a start to find her taking long, sensual licks with her wet tongue across the fabric of your underwear right were your bulge was, your crotch soaking wet with her drool and the stimulation having already given you a major boner that tented the fabric.

\>With a wild yell and sudden flinging of whatever small objects you could reach from your bed, you drive her out of the tent and come stumbling out after her, covering yourself with your armored pants as you start yelling at her full-bore, the sudden shock of having gotten a near-blowjob from her too much for you to handle gently. She cowers against the back area of the campsite, hiding her head under a wing as you go off on your tirade, only peeking out after you finally stop and flop down in the dirt trying to catch your breath.

\>Finally getting your wits about you, you look up at her to see what could only be described as the saddest, most rejected look you've ever seen from a wyvern, before she suddenly spreads her wings and darts off into the sky, quickly disappearing over the horizon.

\>Great. Now you felt bad. In hindsight, you know should have handled that a LOT more gently than you had, and now she probably you hated her, or at the very least never wanted to see her again. 

\>Taking some time to gather yourself and starting cleaning up the mess you made over the next hour or so, you keep finding yourself staring at the empty nest she left, a strange feeling welling up inside you.

\>You DID like her. You really did...but, up until now, you'd thought it was the kind of attraction man had to nature, or the friendship of a loyal companion. Now, though, you were utterly confused by what you felt. Did you REALLY like her in that way? Enough to even...?

\>You shake your head as you throw down what you were carrying and move to grab your gear. Love or not, you had an apology to make.

\>Even without her assisting you, you were still a trained hunter capable of following even the slightest trail to a monster's location, and you had the extra benefit of the signs she'd left behind being as fresh as they got. Given that she could fly, though, she could cover ground a lot faster than you, so you were on the trail for a while.

\>Your pace picking up, you start jogging down the path she made before you notice something strange mixed in with her footprints and scratches.

\>Pink Rathian scales, and scorched ground. Signs of fighting.

\>Oh no.

\>Was THAT what she was going to do? Fight the Pink Rathian who had utterly destroyed her the first time you'd met, in some desperate attempt to prove herself and get you to accept her advances?

\>Hearing roars and sounds of fighting in the distance, you break into a dead sprint towards the cliffs ahead of you, climbing as fast as your arms and legs could allow and even using your grappling hook to expedite the process. The sounds of fighting get louder as you near the top, and you start feeling sudden and dramatic shifts in the temperature as gouts of fire and ice wash over the edge of the cliff, raining embers and frost particles down on you.

\>Right before you reach the top, you suddenly hear a deafening shriek before everything goes quiet. Dread sinking in, you pull yourself up and over, finding yourself standing in the entrance of a large cliffside cave, but you lose interest in the architecture as soon as you see what's lying before you.

\>The Pink Rathian lay motionless, her maw curled into a morbid rictus as blood poured from a massive gash in her neck, her wings covered in a thick layer of frost. Your Legiana struggled beside her, still moving, but covered in bleeding wounds and punctures that leaked the Rathian's raw poison. Upon seeing you, she let out a weak cry just like the first time you'd met face to face, only it wasn't a challenging cry this time, but a grateful one.

\>You drop your weapon and run to her, cradling her head in your arms and doing what you can to stem the flow of blood from her injuries as you repeatedly whisper to her how sorry you are, how you shouldn't have driven her off, how you should have been there for her, how she needs to be quiet and save her strength now, how you're sorry for the bitterness as you pop open one antidote after another and pour them down her gullet, massaging her neck to get her to swallow.

\>Your care continues well into midday and late afternoon, working tirelessly as you use whatever spare cloth you have on you to bandage her wounds, making quick runs for herbs and other healing remedies when your potions run out, not even sure if she can digest them properly and not even caring at the moment since she'll die without them anyways. Long after she's passed out and the sun has gone down, you build a fire and keep watch over her, nestled between her and the massive Pink Rathian she'd slain, as though it would somehow come back to life and attack again. 

\>You hold her head in your lap and listen to her breathe in and out, weak at first, but slowly, surely, getting stronger and deeper as the night passes.

\>Part of you doesn't want to go to sleep, even though it seems like the worst of the danger has passed, but the other part of you is completely and utterly drained from the adrenaline rush. Reluctantly, you let your eyes close as you fall asleep sitting up, your friend's head still in your lap.

\>Your dreams are restless, filled with uncertainty, despair, confusion, and...nuzzling?

\>You wake up with a start, only to hear a weak but excited trill as your Legiana friend, alive and well, rubs her head against your face happily, like yesterday never even happened between you. You pull her close and give her a tight hug, feeling moisture creeping up in your eyes from how grateful you are, and she responds by licking your face affectionately, wiping your tears away with her tongue.

\>It's a slow, shaky journey back to camp, but you stay with her every step of the way and help keep her propped up so she doesn't fall over. As soon as you're both back in the clearing, she flops down in the nest and rests as you go out to hunt for some food for the both of you. 

\>The next few days pass in a blur as you take care of her, bringing her food and water and piecing together some more makeshift bandages from the ivy growing around the area to replace her old ones, giving you plenty of time to mull over the relationship between the two of you.

\>It was pretty much impossible for you to deny by this point that you loved her as more than just a loyal hunting companion and friend, but you were still getting caught on the fact that she had been wooing you in return for your own accidental efforts, and very clearly wanting you to mate with her. While she'd thankfully toned it down for the time being, given that she was recovering from her injuries, you found yourself wondering if she would eventually attempt it again. It certainly seemed like she would, considering she'd killed her territorial rival and you'd basically taken her back in because of it, but did you really like her enough that you'd even consider doing the nasty with her?

\>Even as the bandages eventually came off, even as she stretched her large wings and took to the air, her beautiful shiny body catching the sunlight and her brilliant yellow eyes practically glowing with happiness at being able to fly again, you continued to think about it. She was a lot smarter than most animals you'd encountered, perhaps even smarter than most monsters too. You figured she'd probably be able to tell the difference between you and another Legiana, maybe she just responded to your actions more than your appearance.

\>She landed and slowly walked over to you, a peculiar look in her eye, but you were still absorbed in your thoughts.

\>Maybe she was even smarter than you gave her credit for, given how she reacted to your angry outburst. Maybe, even though she couldn't talk, there was a actual, genuine, intelligent being beneath those eyes that knew what consent was and-

\>She licks you across the mouth and face, interrupting your thoughts, and she gives you an extremely coy look, her bright yellow eyes filled with as much warmth and love as there was mischief.

\>...Fuck it. You loved her too damn much.

\>Placing your hands on both sides of her head, you pull her in and kiss her. Not just on the top of her nose, but also around the entrance to her maw, giving her an idea of what you had in mind. She opens up and starts slathering your face with saliva from her own long, thick tongue, even going so far as to squeeze in between your lips as far as she can fit it as you press the lower half of your face into her maw and kiss her in earnest. The world around you seems to fall away as this transpires, the two of you locked in each other's embrace as you wrap your arms around her neck and she pulls you into the embrace of her wings.

\>Definitely even smarter than you thought.

\>After what feels like hours, she finally pulls away from you, both your breath and hers being hot and heavy. She definitely knew what this was about, and she wanted more. Both of you did. But first, she had to get you ready.

\>Her head lowers down towards your crotch and she noses you lightly with her beak-like muzzle, letting off a slight lilting trill to tell you to undress. You slowly begin to unbuckle your armor as she watches with vested interest, your chestpiece dropping to the ground quickly followed by your greaves and boots, leaving you in just your undergarments. Taking a deep breath as you fully comprehend what kind of rabbit hole you're about to go down, you slowly peel off your last remaining line of "defense", leaving you nude before her and revealing your member that was already at half-mast.

\>You can see a primal hunger flare up in her eyes at the sight of your manhood, and she's quick to gently but firmly push you over into a sitting position on the steps in front of your tent entrance. She takes a moment to sniff at you, clearly relishing your smell, before she sticks her long tongue out and slowly, SLOWLY drags it from the base of your shaft to the tip, drawing it out as long as possible and making you groan as you lean back and try to brace yourself for the ride as best you can. She certainly doesn't make it easy for you, though, as she begins to quicken her pace to the point where she's lapping at it and pressing your fully erect member against your lower body with each lick, the exquisite texture of her tongue driving you nuts. You try your best to hold it in, but at this point you've been pent up for such a long time that it isn't long at all before you start feeling yourself reaching the tipping point.

\>As if she can sense this, your Legiana doubles down on her efforts, taking your member into her maw entirely and begins to bob up and down, letting out a short, bestial grunt with every pump, clearly enjoying this as much as you are. While you certainly don't want the moment to end this quickly, your soon-to-be mate doesn't give you a choice in the matter and it isn't long before you cry out and grab her long antennae-like horns, pushing yourself into her maw as deep as you can go as you cum. The wyvern lets off an approving coo as she continues to pump your shaft with her tongue even as she gulps down your seed, some of it dripping out from between her sharp teeth along with her drool.

\>Trying to catch your breath, you watch as she licks the remainder of your cum from her chops and sets to cleaning you off, her gentle ministrations a welcome reprieve as you pet the back of her head. Once finished, she nuzzles against you lovingly, her smooth hide cool and relaxing against your bare skin, and the two of you rest for a while and simply enjoy each other's company as you wait to recharge for the next round.

\>She pulls away after a short while and moves several feet away, before rolling around until she's resting on her backside and sticking a leg up in the air as she begins to clean herself off, running her tongue over her opening and never taking those expressive eyes of hers off yours, clearly aware of what she was doing as she deliberately continued in order to get you aroused again.

\>Once you're ready, you stand up and walk over to her as she gets back into a standing position, purring as you place your hands on her head and run one down the length of her long neck, admiring her smooth, sleek form. As you continue along one of her wings, feeling the smooth membrane as it travels down the length of her body, eventually tracing over one of her thick and powerful haunches, the Legiana looks back at you with a half-lidded gaze as you come around to her backside and take another peek underneath her tail, noting the reddish blush that had appeared around her saliva-coated nethers, sticking out in stark contrast to her lightly colored underside. Reaching under the base of her tail, you run your fingers across her opening, lightly teasing one inside of her, which causes her to shudder and let off a hissing breath from the stimulation.

\>Taking the opportunity to pay her back for the blowjob, you push a couple fingers into her opening and slowly pull and push them in and out, causing a deep and utterly aroused moan to escape her as her fluids drip out onto the ground and your hand. The increased lubrication allows you to push your fingers even further into her, and the moaning turns to half-strangled cries as she presses the lower half of her body against the ground in ecstasy as her backside raises up to meet your hand.

\>Not wanting to end the moment quite as early as she did, however, you eventually pull your fingers out and give her a moment to recover, sampling some of her honey off of your finger and finding the taste exquisite. Once she's caught her breath, you decide it's finally time for the main event, and lift her long, slender tail up over your shoulder as she whines for you to hurry up and get to it. Thanks to her runty size, she's just about the perfect height for you, only having to lower herself down onto her "knees" for you to be able to line up your waist with her.

\>Something in the back of your mind tells you that this is your last chance to turn back, that once if you go through with this, you're tied to her forever, but when you see her head to look back at you, her gaze equal parts loving, aroused, and needy, the thought quickly fades and you press the tip of your shaft into her.

\>She lets out a short squawk and her breath quickens as her inner walls immediately clamp down on your intrusion, making the fit more snug than you were expecting and causing you to gasp as you hug the base of her tail for leverage. Not stopping there, though, you slowly inch your way further into her, her warm and slick tunnel yielding to you as you push in as far as you can go, eventually hilting yourself inside and still having not found an end inside her.

\>She's absolutely loving it though, her head angled upwards and her wingjoints "pawing" against the ground as she hisses and moans, getting louder when you slowly pull out and push right back in again, the friction of her insides making you shudder against her and causing her body to reciprocate in kind. The two of you are well and truly connected now, pressed against each other in a sweaty, heaving, twitching singularity, and you continue to hug her tail with one arm as you place another on her rump and start up a steady rhythm, bent over her back as you hump into her again and again.

\>Your movements push her against the ground, making her large body shift back and forth as she cries out again in ecstasy, her long tongue hanging out the side of her maw and dripping saliva as the membrane attached to her horns flares out, turning slightly pink from the blood rush, her heart undoubtedly racing as you bred her hard and true. You aren't exactly far behind her, either, your cheeks flushed from the exertion and feeling the heat build up between the two of you as you ram into her again and again.

\>You can feel yourself getting close again, and judging from her twitching and almost desperate-sounding moans as her large talons clench at the air on both sides of you, she is too. 

\>But before either of you can finish, you get a sudden surge of motivation to make things a bit more interesting, and you quickly pull out to her chagrin before you grab her backside and heave, rolling her over and getting a surprised squawk out of her as she find herself on her back, her large wings splayed to each side and her powerful legs and talons raised up in the air. Before she can gather herself, you kneel down, straddling the base of her tail and lining yourself up again before thrusting back in, and she lets out a screech of pleasure as you begin to breed her again, this time with her below you.

\>Your quick swapping of position only delays you slightly as you soon approach the tipping point again, but she has one last surprise for you as well. As you bend forward, your teeth clenched as the pressure builds to almost unbearable levels, you find yourself being kissed by her again as her long neck cranes forward and her face meets yours, breaking it off quickly as she approaches the end and suddenly clamping down on your shoulder in a mating bite as she finally climaxes, her talons clenching tightly as her distinctive roar echoes across the Coral Highlands, louder and more beautiful than you've ever heard from her before. Driven over the edge along with her, you let off a shuddering yell as you cum inside of her, pumping gouts of your seed deep into her depths, so hard and forceful that it feels like your balls are being milked for all they're worth as her canal massages the length of your dick, taking all of what you can give.

\>Completely spent, you stay inside of her for another minute as you both catch your breath, before you slowly pull out and cause some of your cum to leak out along her underside. Crawling up onto her belly, you lie down against her as she wraps you in her wings and lets off a loving croon as she nuzzles against your head.

\>Well...that was it then.

\>You were mated to a Legiana now.

\>Honestly, though, the thought didn't sound as bad as it did before. You still felt the same way for her, even after the deed...perhaps even more strongly, now, given the loving embrace you find yourself in as you both bask in the afterglow and the warm rays of sunlight filtering into your camp.

\>You thoughts wander back to what the future might hold for the two of you, now. You couldn't exactly stay out here for the rest of your life, given you had a responsibility to Astera and all the people there who were depending on hunters like you. But at the same time, being mated to a Legiana meant that you had to take care of her now, as well. It was a...difficult situation, to say the least.

\>She gives you a lick across the cheek, her expressive and intelligent eyes staring into yours, and you rub her lower jaw affectionately with a hand.

\>That was something to worry about later. For now, you just wanted to stay here with her and enjoy the moment.

\>...And maybe, if anyone from the Commission asked, you could just tell them it was for "research". Knowing them, they'd probably buy it.
