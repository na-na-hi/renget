##->What Prifes units do I reroll for, as a new/returning player? <-
Updated: March 3rd, 2024

**TL;DR - If you don't get Neneka & Ames in the first spark, consider re-rolling if you have the patience. Free 3* from Tutorial is not relevant, just a nice cherry on top.**
Prifes is a great chance to get a ton of 3* units, Prifes or not. The goal here is to get at least 2 to 3 Prifes units. These are semi-limited units that can only be obtained from the Princess Fes banner. Newbies and returning players have their own personal Prifes banner, copying the last one ran on JP. This banner lasts 72 hours, counting down from when you started the tutorial. A spark is 200 rolls, or 30,000 gems. 
The following list is for new players to target, as some units are amazing - But require a ton of investment before they're actually good. 

###->SS Tier - Get these in or before your first spark and you're gold<-
**Neneka** - Amazing magic unit that does everything except heal your team and restore TP. Useful for any level player, from new to #1 clan. Re-roll or make her your #1 spark target. 
**Ames** - Amazing support unit, makes entire party tankier with barrier, heals and a damage cut to lowest HP unit. Can help new players get further than they otherwise would without borrows. No Unique Equip.
**Eris** - Similar to Ames, makes entire party more durable and has a unique revive mechanic that allows your units to cheat death one time per fight, after she uses her SP skill. Great support overall, not just for Dark teams. No Unique Equip.

###->S Tier - Must have targets for max level players, worth completing a spark or two if you get the other two above as a new player<-
**Christina** - Requires 6* & Max investment. Some TLs may require X.Chris bonds as well, so be careful when reviewing TLs. But an amazing physical damage dealer
**Labyrista** - Thanks to her Unique Equip, rocketed straight back to dominance in CB. Requires max investment, but well worth it. Can be considered SS tier with newer players who have mostly physical teams.
**Princess Kokkoro** - Great utility, party wide buffs/debuffs to enemies. Can still be used in higher level content, excellent pickup on your way. With UE, can frontline even better and provide permanent buffs from S1+. Excellent wind support
**Princess Kyaru** - Fantastic magic damage dealer that nukes a single target. Great Dark mage for magic teams. Has a Unique Equip that requires max investment. Can stomp lower level content and Arena, while maintaining consistent usage for new and max players in most content.

### ->A Tier - Good for low levels, great for for Max-high levels<-
**クローチェ (Croce)** -  Good specialist in multi-target physical damage, but does have a huge drawback if she runs out of her battery resource. Needs team support and is a pure damage dealer. No Unique Equip yet.
**Anne/Grea Duo** - A great magic DPS that can benefit from buffs give to them and convert it into bigger buffs. A great unit that has been consistently used. Requires a lot of team support.
**ライラエル(Lyrael?)** - Unique field effect that damages all physical units every action, great magic damage alongside great buffs. Extremely helpful early on, but a squishy unit.
**Hatsune/Shiori Duo** - Great multi-target physical AOE damage dealer that can UB fairly often. Has a UE and does need max investment for optimal efficiency, but still good with just UE30.
**Misora** - A good magic damage dealer, being very useful in Dungeons such as EX6. Consistently used against a few bosses in CB as well.

### ->B Tier - Good for low level players, growing into niche usage Max level choices<-
**Princess Rei** - Good multi-target, physical damage dealer that needs to crit for max damage. Has UE. Can do well in low level Arena, with enough TP charging and against multi-target bosses.
**Muimi** - She's definitely back in action as a physical damage dealer, but Muimi requires absolute max investment in order to become relevant. This does knock her down a few ranks for new players.
**Akino & Saren Duo** - Good utility with heal and self buffs, can add good damage and solo carry fights with 4 supports. Decently useful physical unit in end game content so far. No Unique Equip
**Princess Hiyori** - Good option for physical damage, but does require max investment on her UE to be fully functional. A nice to have in the roster for fire teams.

### ->C Tier - Nice to have, but not incredibly helpful for new players or necessary for late game<-
**Ranpha** - Good magic damage dealer, can spawn her dragon to help tank and deal even more damage. Good at higher levels, but still nice for lower levels. No Unique Equip yet.
**Homare** - A nice Multi-target magic damage dealer, but is outclassed outside of specific scenarios. No Unique Equip yet.
**Princess Pecorine** - Fantastic for tanking things that only hit your 1st position unit, but lacks a taunt to save backline units from being targeted.  Made worse by the fact that you can borrow max level units in story from friends. Loses importance once people learn how to actually make functional team comps.

### ->D tier - Not worth rolling for at this time<-
**Little Lyrical Trio** - Nice target damage unit, doesn't see much usage late game at the moment.
**Princess Yui** - A machine gun style, multi-target, selfish magic damage dealer. Has a Unique Equip that requires max investment, for high level, but can smash low level Arena. Not extremely useful outside of that.

##->Permanent New Player Campaign Bonuses<-
While below a certain level, there are various catchup mechanics for starting players to take advantage of. These will be applied to your account, until you reach the threshold called out below.

1. Level 50 to 100 - Players will receive x4 EXP for stamina spent on Normal, Hard & Very Hard Main Quest nodes.
2. Level 101 to 291 - Players will receive x6 EXP for stamina spent on Normal, Hard & Very Hard Main Quest nodes.
3. Any player below level 250 will receive x3 Drop rate on mana and equips for Normal, Hard and Very Hard Main Quest nodes.
4. Any player below level 291 will receive x2 EXP for all daily missions.

Notes :
!!! note If another Campaign is applied at the same as the beginner Campaign, the beginner campaign will be applied instead.
!!! note If another ongoing Campaign gives higher reward values compared to the beginner bonus, the beginner bonus campaign will be increased to match it.
!!! note If a higher ongoing Campaign ends, the beginner bonus' original values are applied.

##->Recommended Hard nodes to farm<-
Here are some good targets to take advantage of your x3 Hard bonuses as a new player. Be careful not to farm some of their nodes in side stories by accident. You can if you want, but obviously they won't be getting x3 hard bonuses. These characters are not suggested in order of priority, as the meta/usage of a unit can shift from month to month.

##-> Coin Shops <-
These shops allow you to exchange your earned coins from various game modes, in order to obtain memory shards for your girls.

4. Clan Battle: Makoto, Io

##->Tips for beginners<-

- Once reaching level 50, you can skip the story for around 12k gems and a ton of rewards.
- Complete the easy versions of the training dummy gargoyles for easy 100 gems and 1 large heart per. There are 5 in total, but do the first 3.
- Spark at least 1 unit from the 72 hour banner, unless there's another prifes banner going on.
- After hitting level 291, the best way to power level is through side stories. This is because the hard nodes cost 10 stamina each, but give 16, 16, 18,18, 20 EXP each. Only use this method if you absolutely have to power level as hard as possible.
- If you want to remain low level to cash in on sub 200 x3 Hard/normal nodes: Don't claim mission rewards from Dailies aside from the ones that give gems, after you hit level 50. The trade-off here is staying lower-level and not getting to clear content due to that. This is just preference and can lead to losing out on clearing current content, or growing fast enough to clear near future content.
- To fund the early Dungeon 6 Stars, you'll want to clear the worlds up to 57-14 in order to get EX6 unlocked. The nodes scale to your level, but the rewards are based on the dungeon. This means you'll have access to a large amount of dungeon coins
- Unlock Lvl 17 Mana/EXP exploration quests as soon as possible.
- Clearing side stories earlier will grant players general growspheres, allowing characters to be leveled for free.
- If you're running low on guild house furniture coins, consider only upgrading the stamina furniture and liking as many guild houses until you hit the cap for daily coins. You can collect up to 50 per day (10 likes).
- Be patient when it comes to progression. 
- Request equips as often as possible.

##->Frequently Asked Questions<-

### -> Gameplay Mechanics <-

Q - **What is this wedding ring I can give to my units?**
A - It allows units to go 10 levels above the player level (Ex - Plvl cap is 260, your LB'd unit can go to 270). You must have maxed out a units' stars in order to access this feature. These extra stats apply in all game modes, except Clan Battle.

Q - **How many resources does it cost to LB a unit?**
A - 3 different categories:
	1. Non-Limiteds (Not Prifes or limited banner unit) = 120 Memory Pieces & 20m Mana
	2. Limiteds (Prifes or limited banner) = 40 Memory Pieces & 30m Mana
	3. Use of an Astraria Ring - Free upgrades
!!! note You still need to use EXP and mana to level your unit, the above methods just unlock the ability to get to +10 levels.


Q - **What is a Growsphere? How do I get them?**
A - It's an item that gives you the ability to raise a character up to a certain rank and level at no cost for your own resources. Currently, the latest events offer Rank 26, level 250 Growspheres. Re-runs may offer lower thresholds, based on the time they were run. You can get them from events on Box 5, they usually have 2. If you didn't get them initially, you can get them in a re-run event.

Q - **Are there specific character growspheres?**
A - Yes, for welfare event units starting from Christmas Yukari. You can obtain them through side stories and re-runs as well, but only once.

Q - **Can I use a growsphere at low level, or will that waste it?**
A - No, you can use it instantly. The game will still let you level up for free until you reach the cap, regardless of when you applied it.

Q - **How do I unlock a Unique Equipment?**
A - Your unit must be at least Rank 7 and requires 50 of their character memory pieces, 30 heart frags (or 3 large heart frags) and 1 million mana to craft.

Q - **What is a Unique character Growsphere and how do I get them?** 
A - The same as a regular growsphere, just that it's for their Unique Equip. Currently capped out at level 240. They're given away at various points and rewards in things like Special Dungeon. **You DO NOT need a unit's Unique Equip already built** to use these Growspheres on them. Using this will cover the hearts, mana and shards required to unlock a UE for a unit.

Q - **Are there character-specific Unique Equip Growspheres?** 
A - Not at this time.

Q - **What the fuck is adventure mode?**
A - Mode where you send girls out on adventures. Can collect memory pieces of first 3 girls added into the lineup. For a more in-depth look, go [here](https://rentry.co/AdventureMode).

Q - **What is Clan Battle?**
A - A game mode that runs once a month for 5 days where you and your clanmates fight various boss monsters individually, to clear as many waves as possible.
They typically start 6 days before the final day of the month and end the day before end of the month (December CB - Dec has 31 days, so CB is Dec 26th-30th JST)

Q - **What is the "Soft Cap" and how does it work?**
A - In Clan Battle fights (and some other fights), there is a maximum damage that the boss can take from any single damage calculation, which is 1.125m. Some characters have skills that allow them to bypass this cap, to hit double the value. This is not represented by the amount of hits a character does on their UB/Skills 
(Ex, Eriko 1-5 Star UB has one damage calculation but multiple hits. Eriko 6 Star Has several hits, but 2 separate damage calculations)

Q - **Is looping still a thing?**
A - No, because the maximum TP Gain or Retain a Unit can have is capped. This means you won't be seeing a single Maho UB filling up the TP of an entire party. You won't be able to get 6* Kokkoro to wipe your entire team with a heal anymore, sadly.


### -> Progression <-

Q - **Help, I'm stuck and can't progress past world X-14 for some reason**
A - You need to be a higher level. This is an unfortunate side effect of the increased EXP gain, and from being able to borrow. It results in progressing much further than would happen normally, which is why you will hit this early on.

Q - **I'm stuck at X in the main story, how do I progress?** 
A - You can add friends and borrow their max level units (max 2 per friend). Christina 6 Star, Hiyori 6 Star, Kaori 6 Star and Akino 6 Star are examples of great units to borrow. Borrowed units no longer go away after a single use, they're always available in Main Quests.

Q - **Can I borrow a unit even if I'm auto-progressing?**
A - Yes, however, be warned that each borrow costs roughly up to 50K mana.

Q - **What is a good story progression team if I'm not borrowing?**
A - Tank/Ames/Neneka/Healer/Damage dealer is always good. "Healer" can be replaced with another damage dealer if you feel you are not dying.

Q - **How often should I refresh with gems?**
A - Usually 3-6 times max. That's 120-300 gems. Any higher might drive a considerable hole in your gem count if you're not careful.

Q - **Where do I spend my stamina as a new player?**
A - Usually on whatever Campaign is running. For sub 250 players, you'll want to focus on shards for key targets. [Recommended Hard Nodes](https://rentry.co/pcrgjpstartguide#recommended-hard-nodes-to-farm) for further details.

Q - **Who should my first 6 Star be?**
A - Maho or Yukari. They are both easy to farm through the Dungeon Coin shop.

Q - **Why can some people skip all the way to the end of Arc 2 in the story, but not me?**
A - Because you aren't level 50 yet. After hitting level 50, you can go to the Main story and will be given an option to skip past all of Arc 1 & 2. This will give you all the rewards you would have received from doing so.


### -> Ranking/Equips <-

Q - **What Rank should X character be?**
A - As of February 2nd, 2023 JST - You should be safe going to Max rank. This is because TP gain calculation is now done based on the character's stats at the lowest Rank Bonus rank, no equips attached. (Ex - Rank bonus is 28/27. My Maho is R28 full equips, but TP Gained from damage is calculated as if she's R27 naked) 
!!! warning Defensive skills
    Things that buff defenses still have not been fixed in this regard, which can potentially brick some autism TLs. Questions below speak more about this.

Q - **What do I equip on X unit?**
A - See above. Reonmaru and other Youtuber guide makers have stopped releasing these types of videos, because they largely believe this issue is fixed.

Q - **I heard this game can ruin units by maxing them out, is that true?**
A - As of February 2nd, 2023 - The only way to brick a unit is most likely by having them leveled to max for things like Maho 6 Star, Rin 6 Star & some other supports that provide defensive buffs.  This is due to the fact that skills increasing defensive stats still reduce the amount of TP gained, based off damage taken. Cygames has mentioned that they're monitoring this system change and will adjust as they deem necessary.
**TL;DR - Sometimes your comps may see varying results due to units with defensive buffs, so in that sense they are bricked.**

Q - **They got rid of bricking? How?**
A - An update made TP gain somewhat standardized across the board. TP Gain from damage taken is calculated as if your unit is the 2nd highest rank, with no equips. These calculations also remove HP, M.Def & P.Def stats from the following sources:
- EX Skills
- EX Equipment
- Bond stories
- Unique Equips
See https://priconne-redive.jp/news/information/21224/ for full announcement.

Q - **What happens when a unit has defensive buffs?**
A - The defensive buffs still use the base value of a unit's defensive stat, meaning that you can get less TP from damage taken in that scenario. Common units that raise defensive stats are Ames & Maho, as examples.

Q - **Can I still brick my units by getting them to 5 Star?**
A - You can star down between 3, 4 & 5 if your unit is 5. You cannot star down a 6 Star unit. 

### -> General <-

Q - **Why are there so many hard nodes recommended for Arena?**
A - A lot of Arena units happen to be farmable in Hard main quests.

Q - **Who should I spend my Goddess Stones (Whale Tears, DA, etc...) on?**
A - Realistically, you should hold on to them until you really need to spend them. If you have an itchy trigger finger, Neneka, Ames, Christina, Laby are all excellent choices. Good limiteds like NY.Neneka, NY.Homare also fall into this category.

Q - **Which dungeons can I do as a new player?**
A - You can crush the first 4 dungeons with Ames/Neneka and 3 other units that don't die. For EX1 & 2, you may want to join a clan and ask in your clan chat for a borrow of a stronger damage dealer like Ranpha or Misora. Remember that Dungeons still have a 30 level cap limit.

Q - **How do I sim bosses?**
A -  Before CB begins, we get access to "Training Mode". This allows you to test/save comps in-game against all 5 tiers and all 5 bosses to prep your comps ahead of time. 

Q -  **Can I test bosses after CB ends?**
A - Yes, if you go to the menu and click on the training dummy icon, you will have access to Gargoyle training dummies that give rewards for 1st time clears, as mentioned in the tips section above. In addition, you can fight the previous month's bosses to test for fun.

Q - **How do I change the app icon on my phone?**
A - Only iOS users can do this, but it can be found in Menu > Profile > App Icon

Q - **I missed this important unit's banner, will it come back** 
A - A limited unit will have a re-run 6 months after its release. Afterwards, they generally come back once a year, near their original release window. Permanents do not receive re-runs.

Q -  **When is the next Prifes?**
A -  Typically, we will see a prifes on these dates:
		Last day of February
		During Golden Week 
		Last day of August
		Last day of December

Q - **I got Neneka & Ames before needing to spark, is it worth it to finish the spark? Who would I pick?**
A - Yes. The only wrong answer is anyone in B tier, but it also depends on the units you've got. Asking in the thread with an image of your rolls is a great way to get advice on who to spark. 

Q - **Princess Connect is crashing on Launch on my Bluestacks Emulator, what do I do?**
A - This is due to the Unity Engine update on April 12th, forced on April 15th, 2023. You'll need to create a new instance and make sure that you have it running on Android 11 (Beta)

Q - **I did the above and now I'm seeing pink textures everywhere, is there a fix?**
A - Go into your setting and change your Graphics Rendered & Interface Renderer to "Direct X". It might be set to "OpenGL" by default.

Q - **How do I get a ton of gems quickly as a new player, to spark?**
A - Add a Max level player from the thread with a max Christina to borrow and clear the following content:
1. Main Story - Normal nodes
2. Main Story - Hard nodes
3. Side Stories - Normal nodes (No borrows allowed)
4. Side Stories - Hard nodes (No borrows allowed)
5. 12k from skipping Arcs 1 & 2 story after hitting level 50
6. Arena early rewards for climbing in ranks
