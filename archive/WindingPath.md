#The Winding Path

Deadwater. A haven for all sorts who disagree with the law, and evidently also a place of joyous camaraderie. A figure in a black cloak with locks of white hair peeking out stands outside of a tavern, laughter roaring from inside. Shadows dance across the windows as patrons drink, dance, play cards or dice, and generally make merry.

*Do not delay, child. Those you must meet lie within.*

For all Kalma had read and been told of the humble island of pirates, she did not know why she was here. Her pilgrimage had thus far taken her to holy sites where the Veil loomed close or where she might find the enemies of the Lady and strike them down. Yet, the Veil felt no closer than usual, nor had the identity of any heathens amongst these pirates been made known to Kalma. Rather, her divine mother desired her to find *someone*, but gave no hint as to who or for what purpose. As the Lady's blade — and as a daughter — she dared not question her will.

Kalma quietly slips inside the establishment, her presence beyond the notice of its intoxicated customers. However, if they did look the disciple's way, they would find something that looked more like a living shadow than a woman. It made sense for someone who desired discretion. Perhaps not its intended use, but for those of meeker character it made avoiding awkward situations so much easier. Divine Blood had a habit of making one stand out in ways that Kalma found less than desirable. Even in Deadwater, where your heritage would earn little more than a few disparaging jokes, she felt compelled to hide her more curious features.

Although the tavern's exterior was quite shabby looking, its interior is relatively well kept. Strange spirits from all across the continent, and more than a few from beyond, line the shelves under the watch of a heavyset man with a thick, grizzly beard. The clientele a no less diverse than their drinks. In particular, Kalma's eyes are drawn to a petite elf woman dancing with a cheery human man and a towering merfolk that resembles a shark who is currently murmuring in an alcohol-induced sleep. A few of the over guests seem disappointed that they won't get to test their strength against the merfolk, but are too fearful of being eaten alive to risk waking him.

Kalma approaches the bar and places a gold coin counter. The elderly man glances at it before looking at her as he polishes a glass.

"Whotcher want, then, luv?" He gives a wide grin, showing off his gold fillings as he takes the coin between his find fingers to inspect it.

Kalma gestures to the three guests. "What can you tell me of the two dancers and the man-shark."

"Touched in the 'ead, eh? I sell drinks," he says dryly, snorting.

He most certainly did not merely 'sell drinks' as he claimed. As inexperienced as she was, Kalma knew well enough that what the barkeep meant was 'give me more money'.

"I'll leave the choice to you, then," Kalma says as she takes out two pieces of silver and slides them over.

"The knife-ear lass's Para. A clever thing. No slouch with them 'and cannons neither." The barkeep snatches several bottles from the shelf behind him and some ice before mixing it all in a tulip glass. "Says she'll lord over these seas 'n' a way that makes ya believe 'er."

There was no shortage of pirates who aspired to proclaim themselves king and there was nothing about the elf girl that made it seem any more likely that she would succeed where others had failed. Of course, Kalma knew nothing of how such a goal would even be achieved. Just watching the girl had the corners of the aasimar's mouth straining, and perhaps that was enough. If she could convince others she was a king, then why couldn't she be?

The barkeep slides the finished drink over, looking at Kalma expectantly. She had not had many drinks before and certainly had not consumed any like this. Concoctions meant to facilitate spiritual journeys were plentiful in her training; Liquor was scarce. She takes the glass in her hands and gives it a sniff. taking in the drink's fruity aroma. Satisfied that it isn't anything wicked, she tilts the liquid past her lips. It's sweet and creamy and warm, and Kalma finds herself almost emptying the glass in one go.

*There will be plenty of time to enjoy man's vices. It will feel even better with companions.*

Kalma pulls the glass from her lips as the whispers echo in her mind. It wasn't much, but she now understood that these people were to become her companions. She looks again at the barkeep, hoping that in his explanation she might find the reason.

Satisfied with her unspoken approval of his mixing, he continues. "Lad she's wiv is Del Mar. Blokes call 'im the Turtle Prince on account o' 'im bein' thick wiv 'unsha. Even 'as one o' them turtles carryin' 'is ship. I 'ear 'e's got a nutter who worships that kraken too."

Kalma nurses her drink as she glances at Del Mar. She was familiar with the followers of Hunsha and the Unspeakable and couldn't keep herself from inwardly questioning what her Lady's intent was, no matter how futile. It wasn't as if this difference in dogma was something irreconcilable, but it was still a strange choice. 

"Fink the shark's Kavak or sumfink. 'e runs wiv Del Mar too. Got some kind o' deal I 'ear. A quiet sort, but not much o' a temper." As the barkeep finishes off he passes Kalma another glass which she eagerly accepts. She'd overpaid for both the drink and the information, and while she cred less for how much coin was in her purse than most, she still intended to extract as many of her new favorite cocktail as she could from the man. As pious as she was, it was much better than the blend of blood, berries, and herbs she had grown used to.

Kalma had little to no experience with merfolk. She had run into them in her travels, but she could hardly she was an expert. Though the deal mentioned piqued her interest even more the prospect of studying merfolk. What sort of arrangement could they have been made? She wouldn't know until she was able to secure her place, but it suggested that the captain might be more willing to do so than she thought.

Drink in hand, she approaches Del Mar and Para. The hood of her cloak is pulled down to reveal her milky white form: hair, eyes, and skin all pale enough that one might confuse her vampire. Only her dark lips and some markings visible on her legs and arms keep her from being a completely unspoiled canvas.

"Excuse me, but I must make a request." She takes out her purse, prepared to offer it all if need be. "I am Kalma, blade of the Lady of Final Rest. Her word has guided me to you; thus, I ask that you take me and let me know you so I might understand why."
