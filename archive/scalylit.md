#### Dragons
!!! info Info
	*Because ~~otherkins~~ /scaly/ always complains about how dragons are treated, the following rating system will be used:*
	- DC (Dragon-centricity): How much the plot revolves around dragons as compared to humans.
	- CA (Character Agency): How much dignity dragons are given (i.e. as more than just a stepping stone to make another character look cool). 
	- PS (Philosophy/Spirituality): How much the story focuses on what it philosophically/spiritually means to be a dragon.

**Bound in Scales** (2017) by Steven De Luca
Fantasy (TF/xenofiction)
A scientist/wizard in a fantasy world turns himself into a dragon in order to study their society (basically the plot of Avatar but actually done well). If you enjoyed this novel, you should check out *Bound in Black* (2020) which is an equally well-written sequel. For a more spoilery synopsis, check out the [tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BoundInScales).
**ISBN-10** 1973440571
**ISBN-13** 978-1973440574
> **DC 4/5**
> Humans only really show up in the beginning, before the protag becomes a dragon and also as (mostly-faceless) antagonists for about 1/4 of the novel.
> For its sequel I would give it a 4.75/5 as this is one of the few cases in which humanity becomes less prevalent as the series progresses.
> **CA 4.75/5**
> There's a section that involves some dragons being tortured (to show how evil the antagonists are) but besides that, the dragons in the story are generally free to make choices that drive the plot in a meaningful fashion.
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a chieftan and tend to avoid humans.
> **PS 5/5**

**Dragon Dreams** (2021) by C.B. Morgan
Urban Fantasy (TF/xenofiction)
A boy meets a dragon in a dream... then becomes one himself. Forced to hide from humanity, he journeys to a sanctuary that they have created, mentored by the dragon from his dreams. Note: This is the author's first published novel and also happens to be adapted from the [DA fic](https://www.deviantart.com/citizenindigo/art/Dragon-Dreams-Prologue-563338138) that he wrote several years ago. (Although the prose is decent)
**ISBN-13** 979-8766514879
> **DC 4/5**
> In addition to his family, the protag meets a few other humans along the way.
> Personally I would have given this a 4.5 but the underlying conflict is both directly resulted from and partially, subsequently solved by humanity.
> **CA 5/5**
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a chieftan and tend to avoid humans. (also so far the only species that can wield magic).
> **PS 4/5**

**Scales and Honor: The Dragon's Paladin** (2018) by Justin Lee
Fantasy (dragon riding)
~~When a human and a dragon love each other very, very much~~
~~The author's self-insert encounters a devilishly handsome, young male drake~~
In a setting heavily inspired by DND, a paladin meets a dragon and they go on a quest to find the latter's stolen book. Currently, only the first novel is published but the series spans 7 complete books which you can read for free on the author's [SF account](https://unscforces.sofurry.com/). (Also his [DA](https://www.deviantart.com/theunscforces) and [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/theunscforces/) which have been discontinued)
**ISBN-10** 0692154825
**ISBN-13** 978-0692154823
> **DC 2/5**
> While the iconic duo is the main focus of the series, the POV often switches to many of the other non-dragon characters on their own adventures.
> **DC 3.75/5**
> Dragons are treated surprisingly well but are (reasonably) curbstomped when they fall victim to hubris
> **PS 2/5**
> As a whole, but one of the books in the series deserves a 5/5

**Scaleshifter** (2019) by Shelby Hailstone Law
Fantasy (TF)
Following a war between two kingdoms involving artificial dragons, a child is drafted into the military and experimented on. After being turned into one, he escapes and comes under the tutelage of a real dragon who teaches him about their way of life. This book is part of a (currently) 3-part series , with *The Black Dragon* (2020) about a female dragon in a similar situation and *The God's Gift* (2021).
**ISBN-10** 169342889X
**ISBN-13** 978-1693428890
> **DC 4.5/5**
> Besides the beginning, generic humans only really show up as part of the army hunting the protag after he escapes. 
> 4/5 for the second novel but by the third and fourth this drops to a 2/5.
> **CA 4/5**
> If you consider the torture of fake (human-turned) dragons equivalent to real ones. 
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a council of elders and tend to avoid humans.
> **PS 4/5**

**Songs of Chaos** (2020) by Michael R. Miller
Fantasy (dragon riding)
Ongoing series currently on books 2 of 5. Ascendant and Unbound are the two already released. Servant boy saves blind dragon from death and the two become companions to grow stronger and defeat an upcoming apocalyptic threat. Lots of high fantasy and adventure influenced by cultivation tropes. Really nice wholesome relationship between the two main characters, rider and dragon.
**Ascendant**
**ISBN-10** 1913695042
**ISBN-13** 978-1913695040
> **DC 3.5/5**
>Dragons are full fledged characters and act as the driving force behind most of the plot. Gets even more pronounced from book 2. But the POV is not from the dragons'.
> **CA 4/5**
> As above.
>**PS 3/5**
>The magic system is a central focus and is a product of the dragon's soul.

**Tooth and Claw** (2003) by Jo Walton
Alternate History? (xenofiction)
Interestingly, the winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 2004. Set in a victorian setting, using victorian-era character archetypes and narrative structure, this novel attempts to worldbuild an alien society of dragons with their own social structure and customs. Notably, confession and absolution are regarded a high form of sin, and it is customary to feast upon not only the deceased, but any perceptibly weaker dragons whose continued existence is regarded as a degradation of the species as a whole. The novel follows the immediate aftermath of the death of a dragon clan's patriarch, the ensuing trouble upon dividing up his family's inheritance, and the consequences in seeking reparation thereof.
**ISBN-10** 0765319519
**ISBN-13** 978-0765319517
> **DC 5/5**
> Probably the only novel on this list that does not feature any human characters, whatsoever.
> **Note: CA and PS are ommited**, because of the subjective morality of a species that have no qualms regarding cannibalism due to it being required to reach adulthood.

**Temeraire** (2006-2017) by Naomi Novik
Alternate History (dragon riding)
Have you ever wondered what the Napoleonic Wars would be like if it were fought with dragons? Well, starting with *His Majesty's Dragon* (2006), the series focuses on a British Navy Captain who ends up becomming a dragon rider for the Britain's Aerial Corps after taking possession of a hatchling.
**His Majesty's Dragon**
**ISBN-10** 0593359542
**ISBN-13** 978-0593359549
> **DC 2/5**
> As with most books focused on dragon riding.
> **CA 2.5/5**
> Western dragons become feral if they do not imprint on a rider and are mostly treated as fodder rather than actual people. There are some exceptions, such as the main duo and dragons are worshipped in some places outside of Europe.
> **PS 1.5/5**

**Vainqueur the Dragon** (2019) by Maxime J. Durand
Fantasy (isekai/litrpg)
Part of a 4 book series originally adapted from the [royalroad webnovel](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon). Probably the only litrpg on this list, purely because it is a self-aware satire/parody of common litrpg tropes. Also due to popular demand.
**ISBN-10** 1660990572
**ISBN-13** 978-1660990573
> **DC 3/5**
> Besides the eponymous dragon, there are also many other /scaly/s such as kobolds.
> **CA 3/5**
> Can't say much without spoiling, although Vainqueur gets a lot of good character development despite being your stereotypical dragon.
> **PS 1/5**
‪‪‪‪
**The War of Embers** (2019) by James Duvall
Fantasy/Urban Fantasy (TF/isekai)
Western ~~isekai~~ portal fiction, which is to say, isekai but without the usual isekai cliches. Although this is poorly rated by /scaly/ standards, it is still an incredibly good fantasy novel on its own. The only reason why this is on the list (besides nepotism) is because it delves deep into the main protag's mental state and personality changes after they are turned into a dragon and has some of the best original worldbuilding for dragons. For a better synopsis, see the tvtropes page [here](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfEmbers).
**ISBN-10** 1795086289
**ISBN-13** 978-1795086288
> **DC 2/5**
> Only two of the characters in the "main" cast are dragons and they take human form half of the time.
> **CA 3.5/5**
> Outside of the main cast, most of the other dragons remain in the background, but they have their own kingdom and maintain their sovereignty.
> **PS 2/5**

**Wings of Fire** (2013-) by Tui T. Sutherland
Fantasy (xenofiction)
Yes, this is the same author who was part of the Erin Hunter team who wrote *Warrior Cats*. Comprised of 15 novels and a side series that spans 3 arcs, this is the definitive /scaly/ indoctrination machine published by Scholastic intended for a YA audience. Set in an alien world where dragons have organized into tribes as the dominant species on the planet, the first arc focuses on a war of succession and a multi-tribal friendship of dragonets who are the subject of a prophecy of peace.
**The Dragonet Prophecy**
**ISBN-10** 0545349230
**ISBN-13** 978-0545349239 
> **DC 4.75/5**
> Humans do exist in this setting but as a bronze age, endangered species and are mostly a footnote for the first arc. By the third arc, this is a 3/5, however.
> **CA 4.5/5**
> A human does kill a dragon but most of the plot is driven by the main cast who happen to all be dragons. In arc 3, this is debatably a 4/5 and features one instance of dragon riding and another single unrelated dragon who gets captured and tortured (its complicated and not what you think).
> **2/5**
> Though, there is a novel in arc 3 that rightfully deserves a 4/5.

**Raptor Red** (1996) by Robert T. Bakker
Historical Fiction? [late Cretaceous period] (xenofiction)
The story of a young female Utahraptor by paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, who served as one of the fact-checkers for the film version of Jurassic Park. It was written as a sort of companion novel to his non-fiction book The Dinosaur Heresies, in which he exposed his then-revolutionary ideas about dinosaurs being a little more active and birdlike than the popular imagination's vision of them as big, stupid lizards. It's written as a kind of nature documentary that allows some insight into the animals' thoughts.
