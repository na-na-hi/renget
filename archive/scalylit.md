**Avonoa Series** (2014-2021) by H. R. B. Collotzi 
Fantasy (xenofiction)
In this world, dragons maintain an ancient tradition of refusing to speak in front of humans to hide their true intelligence. Each dragon must pass the Krucible, a test of silence that acts as a sort of coming of age trial which indicates that a dragon has enough maturity to be allowed to venture beyond dragon territory. The story is told in a split POV, with 60% following Dak, who, having failed the Krucible many times, decides to sneak out after hearing that Tog, his friend, and Priya, a dragoness whom he has promised his heart to, has left with a group on a mission and the other 40% revolving around a reasonable prince, having inherited the throne, trying to deal with a "dragon problem" and the return of his long-lost sister. For maximum enjoyment, only read the first two books.

**Bound in Scales** (2017) by Steven De Luca
Fantasy (TF/xenofiction)
A scientist/wizard in a fantasy world turns himself into a dragon in order to study their society (basically the plot of Avatar but actually done well). If you enjoyed this novel, you should try *Bound in Black* (2020) which is an equally well-written sequel. For a more spoilery synopsis, check out the [tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BoundInScales).
**ISBN-10** 1973440571
**ISBN-13** 978-1973440574
> **DC 4/5**
> Humans only really show up in the beginning, before the protag becomes a dragon and also as (mostly-faceless) antagonists for about 1/4 of the novel.
> For its sequel I would give it a 4.75/5 as this is one of the few cases in which humanity becomes less prevalent as the series progresses.
> **CA 4.75/5**
> There's a section that involves some dragons being tortured (to show how evil the antagonists are) but besides that, the dragons in the story are generally free to make choices that drive the plot in a meaningful fashion.
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a chieftan and tend to avoid humans.

**The Dragon Knight** (1976-2000) by Gordon R. Dickson
Alternate History/Historical Fiction?/Fantasy (isekai, body swap, transformation)
Very popular for its time, it would be accurate to describe as a staple of fantasy literature during the 70s-80s that made its way into the libraries of many avid young readers. The first novel of this nine book series would go on to receive an animated movie, The Flight of Dragons, a decade after its initial publication. It follows a typical portal fantasy-esque plot. Two college researchers, Jim and Angela Eckhert, astrally project themselves by accident into magical historical england after an experient goes awry. Jim, now having found himself in the body of a dragon, must rescue his wife from the Dark Powers that threaten the world.
**The Dragon and the George**
**ISBN-10** 0345350502
**ISBN-13** 978-0345350503
> **DC 3/5**
> Although the POV is from a human trapped in a dragon's body struggling with his now dragon-instincts, there is another dragon companion in the group that gets a fair share of character development.
> **CA 3/5**
> Fairly unbiased, dragons are treated as characters as much as everyone else, even though some major deaths do occur.
> **PS 2/5**
> This is mainly a sword and sorcery adventure with some sarcastic meta-commentary on fantasy tropes. On the positive side, the dragons are sufficiently dragon-like in mentality while maintaining their intelligence, having been upgraded to the eschelon of standard race picks for a player party.

**Dragon Dreams** (2021) by C.B. Morgan
Urban Fantasy (TF/xenofiction)
A boy meets a dragon in a dream... then becomes one himself. Forced to hide from humanity, he journeys to a sanctuary that they have created, mentored by the dragon from his dreams. Note: This is the author's first published novel and also happens to be adapted from the [DA fic](https://www.deviantart.com/citizenindigo/art/Dragon-Dreams-Prologue-563338138) that he wrote several years ago. (Although the prose is decent)
**ISBN-13** 979-8766514879
> **DC 4/5**
> In addition to his family, the protag meets a few other humans along the way.
> Personally I would have given this a 4.5 but the underlying conflict is both directly resulted from and partially, subsequently solved by humanity.
> **CA 5/5**
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a chieftan and tend to avoid humans. (also so far the only species that can wield magic).

**Mating Flight: A Non-Romance of Dragons** (2015) by Bard Bloom
Fantasy (xenofiction)
Pretty strange book but quite fun to read. The author clearly had fun writing it too. Its a comedy about a set of misfit young dragons who go on a interdimensional trip to fight over who will marry who. Can be a bit of a difficult read at times, deliberately so. Had to refer to a dictionary several times. The dragons are presented as quite alien in their thinking in their thinking and society but in a pretty understandable way? Also unbelievably powerful. Some anons might not like how they are presented as not being wise paragons of virtue, but very amoral from a human standpoint and the flaws in their society are pretty clear to see. But if that doesn't bother you then then book is absurd, witty and explores some interesting themes. The book doesn't really have an ending its sequel is clearly meant to be read as one book.
**ISBN-13** 978-1514840528
> **DC 4.5/5** 
> Dragons are the central focus of the book, non dragons exist but as clear inferiors to the dragons or side characters. No humans.
> **CA 5/5**
> "How much dignity dragons are given?" No one is really given much dignity in the book but they are clearly far and large the most powerful/ important beings in the setting.
> **PS 4/5**
> Not really sure how to rate this. Its a comedy so their entire outlook and philosophies are mostly played for laughs but it does have interesting worldbuilding and detailed explorations as why the dragons are the way they are. Interesting themes about power.

**Scales and Honor: The Dragon's Paladin** (2018) by Justin Lee
Fantasy (dragon riding)
~~When a human and a dragon love each other very, very much~~
~~The author's self-insert encounters a devilishly handsome, young male drake~~
In a setting heavily inspired by DND, a paladin meets a dragon and they go on a quest to find the latter's stolen book. Currently, only ~~the first novel is~~ two novels are published but the series spans 7 complete books which you can read for free on the author's [SF account](https://unscforces.sofurry.com/). (Also his [DA](https://www.deviantart.com/theunscforces) and [FA](https://www.furaffinity.net/user/theunscforces/) which have been discontinued)
**ISBN-10** 0692154825
**ISBN-13** 978-0692154823
> **DC 2/5**
> While the iconic duo is the main focus of the series, the POV often switches to many of the other non-dragon characters on their own adventures.
> **CA 3.75/5**
> Despite being a rider novel, dragons are treated surprisingly well but are (reasonably) curbstomped when they fall victim to hubris
> **PS 2/5**
> As a whole, but one of the books in the series deserves a 5/5

**Scaleshifter** (2019) by Shelby Hailstone Law
Fantasy (TF)
Following a war between two kingdoms involving artificial dragons, a child is drafted into the military and experimented on. After being turned into one, he escapes and comes under the tutelage of a real dragon who teaches him about their way of life. This novel is part of a 4-book series, with *The Black Dragon* (2020) about a female dragon in a similar situation.

> **DC 4.5/5**
> Besides the beginning, generic humans only really show up as part of the army hunting the protag after he escapes. 
> 4/5 for the second novel but by the third and fourth this drops to a 2/5, focusing too much on human intrigue.
> **CA 4/5**
> If you consider the torture of fake (human-turned) dragons equivalent to real ones. 
> Dragons live in a stereotypically utopic, primitive society with a council of elders and tend to avoid humans.

**Songs of Chaos** (2020) by Michael R. Miller
Fantasy (dragon riding)
Ongoing series currently on books 2 of 5. Ascendant and Unbound are the two already released. Servant boy saves blind dragon from death and the two become companions to grow stronger and defeat an upcoming apocalyptic threat. Lots of high fantasy and adventure influenced by cultivation tropes. Really nice wholesome relationship between the two main characters, rider and dragon.

>**PS 3/5**
>The magic system is a central focus and is a product of the dragon's soul.

**Tooth and Claw** (2003) by Jo Walton
Alternate History? (xenofiction)
Interestingly, the winner of the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 2004. Set in a victorian setting, using victorian-era character archetypes and narrative structure, this novel attempts to worldbuild an alien society of dragons with their own social structure and customs. Notably, confession and absolution are regarded a high form of sin, and it is customary to feast upon not only the deceased, but any perceptibly weaker dragons whose continued existence is regarded as a degradation of the species as a whole. The novel follows the immediate aftermath of the death of a dragon clan's patriarch, the ensuing trouble upon dividing up his family's inheritance, and the consequences in seeking reparation thereof.
**ISBN-10** 0765319519
**ISBN-13** 978-0765319517
> **DC 5/5**
> Probably the only novel on this list that (technically) does not feature any human characters, whatsoever.
> **CA 5/5** see above
> **PS X/5**
> As a victorian novel, the author intentionally follows the genre convention of having a (human) moral message at the end.

**Temeraire** (2006-2017) by Naomi Novik
Alternate History (dragon riding)
Have you ever wondered what the Napoleonic Wars would be like if it were fought with dragons? Well, starting with *His Majesty's Dragon* (2006), the series focuses on a British Navy Captain who ends up becomming a dragon rider for the Britain's Aerial Corps after taking possession of a hatchling.
**His Majesty's Dragon**
**ISBN-10** 0593359542
**ISBN-13** 978-0593359549
> **DC 2/5**
> As with most books focused on dragon riding.
> **CA 2.5/5**
> Western dragons become feral if they do not imprint on a rider and are mostly treated as fodder rather than actual people. There are some exceptions, such as the main duo and dragons are worshipped in some places outside of Europe.
> **PS 1.5/5**

**Vainqueur the Dragon** (2019) by Maxime J. Durand
Fantasy (isekai/litrpg)
Part of a 4 book series originally adapted from the [royalroad webnovel](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon). Probably the only litrpg on this list, purely because it is a self-aware satire/parody of common litrpg tropes. Also due to popular demand.
**ISBN-10** 1660990572
**ISBN-13** 978-1660990573
> **DC 3/5**
> Besides the eponymous dragon, there are also many other /scaly/s such as kobolds.
> **CA 3/5**
> Can't say much without spoiling, although Vainqueur gets a lot of good character development despite being your stereotypical dragon.
> **PS 1/5**

**The War of Embers** (2019) by James Duvall
Fantasy/Urban Fantasy (TF/isekai)
Western ~~isekai~~ portal fiction, which is to say, isekai but without the usual isekai cliches. Although this is poorly rated by /scaly/ standards, it is still an incredibly good fantasy novel on its own. The only reason why this is on the list (besides nepotism) is because it delves deep into the main protag's mental state and personality changes after they are turned into a dragon and has some very interesting worldbuilding. For a better synopsis, see the tvtropes page [here](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfEmbers).
**ISBN-10** 1795086289

**Wings of Fire** (2013-2022) by Tui T. Sutherland
Fantasy (xenofiction)
Yes, this is the same author who was part of the Erin Hunter team who wrote *Warrior Cats*. Comprised of 15 novels and a side series that spans 3 arcs, this is the definitive /scaly/ indoctrination machine published by Scholastic intended for a YA audience. Set in an alien world where dragons have organized into tribes as the dominant species on the planet, the first arc focuses on a war of succession and a multi-tribal friendship of dragonets who are the subject of a prophecy of peace.
**The Dragonet Prophecy**
**ISBN-10** 0545349230
**ISBN-13** 978-0545349239 
> **DC 4.75/5**
> Humans do exist in this setting but as a bronze age, endangered species and are mostly a footnote for the first arc. By the third arc, this is a 3/5, however.
> **CA 4.5/5**
> A human does kill a dragon but most of the plot is driven by the main cast who happen to all be dragons. In arc 3, this is debatably a 4/5 and features one instance of dragon riding and another single unrelated dragon who gets captured and tortured (its complicated and not what you think).
> **PS 2/5**
> Though, there is a novel in arc 3 that rightfully deserves a 4/5.

Historical Fiction? [late Cretaceous period] (xenofiction)
The story of a young female Utahraptor by paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, who served as one of the fact-checkers for the film version of Jurassic Park. It was written as a sort of companion novel to his non-fiction book The Dinosaur Heresies, in which he exposed his then-revolutionary ideas about dinosaurs being a little more active and birdlike than the popular imagination's vision of them as big, stupid lizards. It's written as a kind of nature documentary that allows some insight into the animals' thoughts.
