“Do you remember anything else from that day?”

“Well. I had aunt with my… I mean, I had lunch, with my aunt, and uncle.”

Tic. Toc. Tic. Toc.

The clock. You heard it inside your head.

You felt dirty.

~*~

So dirty.

You stayed in the shower for longer than expected. Your heart weights like lead. Even though the water ran down your body, you couldn’t shake off the feeling of filth. You stared blankly into the wall. Lost looking into a single tile. 

Someone knocked on the door. You didn’t react.

“Anon?”

It’s your aunt.

“Anon!” She knocked again, her tone slightly raised, agitated. Other than the running shower head, you gave no signs of life. A lump in your throat prevented you from speaking.

Fubuki took a deep breath and opened the door slightly, you felt her stare landing on your naked body. Hearing the creaking door made you feel dizzy. Fubuki meekly spoke.
 
"Anon, finish up soon, alright? We’re waiting for you at the table.”

You nodded in silence.

...

The burger is tasteless.

~*~

For some time you wouldn’t see your aunt. Many things came up in Fubuki’s life that rendered her unable to take care of Anon, or so she said. Your mother told you you’d stay at home to be safe. Don’t open the door for anyone, she said. 

While alone, you’d sneak into your parents bedroom and search the closet for dad’s CDs, all stored into black boxes. You couldn’t figure out how his disc player worked, but you saw the covers and that was enough. The first one featured two women in skimpy clothes, being hugged by faceless guys. The second one, hands feeling up the stomach of a young, sweet looking girl who bit her lip seductively. The third, a girl in a school uniform, mustering a look of shame and disgust as a fat man in a suit lifted up her skirt. The feeling of adrenaline you felt when viewing the covers was ridiculous, a different kind of high. 

Your favorite was one with a worn out cover. In the poor quality print of the box art featured an older woman with kemonomimi ears.

You didn’t find her particularly attractive, but those ears, they beckoned you, they hypnotized you, they put you in a trance...

~*~

In the afternoon of a summer day, as close to you as last year.

You could see the warm sunlight with your eyes closed as it pierced your eyelids, waking you from your slumber. Before you could open them, a shadow covered your face. Feeling as if sleeping on top of a soft cloud, you could’ve easily returned to dreamland if you wanted to, but the curiosity of seeing what that shadow was asked to open your eyes. Slowly, as your eyes became accustomed to the light, you began to make out her figure.

Wearing a summer hat, Fubuki held your head in her hands while you rested in her thighs, smiling as her fingers gently scratched your head. You were in her backyard, sitting under the cool shadow of a tree. 

The world felt so colorful back then. Everything was shinier. The sun felt warm instead of hot. Every last bit of that day is still intact, immaculate. You notice the ants walking in the ground, the little hole in the fence, the wrinkles in the tree, even the shape of the leaves hasn’t changed. Much less had changed the features on Fubuki’s face. Her beautiful silver hairs in a casual ponytail, her tail playfully moving. *Her tail*. The blue cardigan slightly revealing her bare shoulders, lightly tanned from being out in the sun, caramelizing her beautiful skin like the pastries she made for you. Your eyes closed, and in a jolt, they opened.

“Auntie?” You mumbled.

“Hey.”

“How long did I…”

“An entire day, I’ve sat here since yesterday.”

“Yesterday?” You looked around, had it been really an entire day?

“I’m just kidding, Anon!” Fubuki hid her smile with her hand. “You were so quiet, I didn’t want to wake you up.”

You blushed.

“Do you like it when I caress your head?” She asked you, her nails digging into your scalp.

“…Yeah.”

Her hand was so soft. A genius idea crossed your mind.

“Auntie! Can I pet your head too?”

“Sure you can.” Fubuki turned her back to you and you walked over to her. You gently placed your hands over her head, and began caressing her.

Fubuki’s hair was silky, smooth, and shiny. Well kept and well combed. You played with strands of hair and watched them drop, flowing from her head like a silver river. And her ears? Oh, her ears. They are so fluffy. Whenever your fingers scratched their base, you’d hear your aunt make strange noises, ones that worried you.

“Hmm, mhmm, hummm, awmm.”

“Auntie, are you okay?”

Fubuki’s fingers were almost digging into her thighs, if she pushed any harder she’d probably make herself bleed. Without turning to face you, she cleared her throat. 

“Please, keep going.”

For a good while you kept hearing those sounds from your auntie, and forever you remembered the texture of her ears.

Warm memories come to haunt a person after they feel that they lost someone. The memories of their parents after they pass, the memories of friends after they graduate. Kids are no different.

Perhaps it was your fault. You didn’t know why, but you thought it was your fault. The guilty pleasure you usually felt from the CD’s was feeling insipid.

You hid the CDs between the work pants they were supposed to be, and after that, you went back to your room and rubbed your crotch through your underwear.

A kid pleads to whatever he believes in, right now you wanted to believe in God, you wanted to believe that your pure, sweet auntie would still love a dirty boy who felt funny watching indecent images.

Being the one working to feed her husband drove Hana mad multiple times. He was incapable of tending to the house, doing everything wrong in Hana’s eyes. In her entire life, not once did she tell him what he did wrong, she just kept shut and kept her anger to herself. A bad habit that she would keep until the last of her days.

Naturally, Hana had outbursts that were far less pretty than what a regular discussion would’ve been. A shaken bottle is bound to blow once opened, and if the pressure’s enough, it’ll explode.

The straw that broke the camel’s back was a little too much to drink after she was tasked with a business trip that was due in a few days. Tonight, as she saw her husband dirtying the table (that she would clean) with bits of rice, she began screaming.

You remained silent, as mama and papa began a yelling competition. Mama screamed that “If you hadn’t forgotten the fucking condom, I would’ve never settled for you, you miserable fucking pig.” 

You had seen enough, and thus, retreated to your room to play with your toys. Making your sonic plushy talk wasn’t enough to shut out the voices of your parents. You curled up in a ball, wishing to disappear for a few minutes, maybe a couple of hours even. You wanted to disappear into Fubuki. She did get mad at you sometimes, but she never hit you, she helped you clean your messes instead of yelling, and even when she was mad and tired, she still loved you.

But does she still love you, knowing that you’re dirty?

You tried to cry, but you couldn’t. The tears, they won’t come out. Despite everything, you can’t cry.

~*~

Wiping tears from her face and picking up broken pieces of plate, Hana worked out her thoughts. Right, the business trip. Someone needs to take care of you. Her best bet was Fubuki, as much as she despised her.	

In the morning, she told you the news.

“Your aunt will come for the week.” She spoke bluntly.

Your heart jumped of happiness, soon overtaken by anguish.

~*~

Fubuki parked outside of Hana’s house, bringing with her a carefully wrapped gift. Anon should be by himself at this moment, his dad was probably out job hunting, or fucking whoever he had an affair with, Hana must’ve been at the airport already. Fubuki took a deep breath, telling herself everything was going to be ok. She rang the doorbell and waited. Anxiously, her nephew opened the door and let her in without saying anything. Fubuki remained silent too.

His blank expression was already causing Fubuki to feel as if a needle was being pushed into her hearth, slowly cutting her tendons one by one. 
 
“I brought something for you, Anon!” She said as she showed you the present. It was a pretty big box, impossible not to notice, he just didn’t show much emotion.

“Thanks, auntie.” He said with a formality he never used around her.

Fubuki encouraged him to open it right away, his expression didn’t change as he tore apart the paper. A new set of Lego Star Wars. 

Fubuki picked up the torn wrapping paper and headed for the trash can, holding back the need to cry. Her joyous nephew, gone. No one to blame but herself. Years of trust and love gone. Did he tell Hana? Did she beat him?

Her nephew began building in the living room, looking at the instructions manual. Fubuki made rice and watched as the steam rose from the hole in the lid, shyly sneaking glances at him, wishing to see even a glimpse of a smile,. She figured trauma was clutching him in its cold hands, and made her see nothing but a horrific monster lurking over her nephew as he built his LEGO set silently.

The rice was done. And with that Fubuki had nothing else to distract her from her sins, so she made some eggs and sausage as well, then tomato salad. Hana didn’t precisely have a very plentiful fridge or pantry.

She called him to eat, and he complied. He set up the table as he always did with her. Fubuki set the hot plate in front of him, as he wordlessly grabbed the fork and began eating. 

In silence, Fubuki watched him eat, her appetite null. Her eyes were fixated on him, which made Anon wonder what his aunt felt. Is it disgust? Is it anger? Is she mad that he humped her? Does she know he gets hot watching those dirty box arts?

“Auntie…” He muttered.

“Y-Yes?” Fubuki jolted awake.

“Do you still love me?” He spoke dully.

Fubuki’s vision was blurred by tears, she contained wet sniffles inside as she got up from her seat and hugged him tightly. Why is she crying? Why is your auntie crying?

“Of course I love you, Anon.” She said with determination. “I love you more than anything else.”

His nephew's eyes began wetting her shirt, the knot in his heart came undone, it's finally coming out.

Finally, peace, not only for him, but for Fubuki as well.

After that, he finished his LEGO masterpiece and showed it to his aunt, who gasped in awe at his creation. He knew her excitement was faked, but he was so happy to know she still cared. Nothing else matters.

As the sun went down and Kenji texted his wife, he told her he would be working late, trying to fix a critical mistake in his company’s tax records. Fubuki agreed, and told him to drop by Hana’s house later, so he would keep her company.

Her nephew was in bed. Fubuki thought he were sleeping, and allowed herself to take a well deserved shower. She felt her sins creeping under her skin but slowly retreating as the warm water hit her skin. 

“He likes me too, doesn’t he?” She muttered, humming a song to herself.

“Pi rapa papa po, papa papa po~”

That’d go greatly on her channel.

Past midnight, Kenji went to Hana’s house, Fubuki let him in. They shared a bit of Hana’s wine and made love in her bed. After a long day of work, her husband felt into a deep sleep, while Fubuki was left wide awake in the sheets.

She heard the door open, and kept quiet, thinking the worst possible scenario. A robber? A kidnapper? Hana’s husband? Hana?

But, whoever entered the room had very light steps, nowhere akin those of an adult, and instead of looking around looking for valuables, they went straight to the closet as if they knew what they wanted, opening its doors ever so slowly so they wouldn’t disturb the tiniest of slumbering lives around. Fubuki heard rustling clothes, then the closet slowly closing, and with nimble steps, the perpetrator was gone. 

Her curiosity sparked, and without making a sound, she got up and went with her first guess, Anon.

She sneaked around the house avoiding creaking floorboards with the intent of reaching his bedroom. She saw light peeking into the hallway, a dim line of yellow color sneaking out of his room's door, telling on him that he was still awake.

Fubuki looked through the thin crevice, and witnessed her nephew masturbating.

He was pushing his hips back and forth slowly onto his pillow, sensually and controlled, just as he had done with Fubuki in the shower some time ago. Fubuki squatted and felt herself get hot. Her hand unconsciously reached down to her womanhood, which, despite being sore, ached for Fubuki’s fingers to caress her. And she did. Fubuki rubbed herself as her love juice dripped onto the floor, her left hand now caressing her tit under her sleepwear. She imagined herself as the pillow he was humping, her legs keeping his little body in place as she instructs him on how to thrust. He panted and panted, he felt the same hot sensation he did when rubbing his crotch, and so, he stopped, scared of knowing what lied beyond it.

As Fubuki watched him suddenly stop, she tried to finish as quick as possible, but just as her hand rubbed her pink pearl, she noticed he was putting the pillow back in it’s place. Panic overtook her, and with quick steps, she ran for the bathroom and hid so she could touch herself out of sight.

As he exited his room, he saw little droplets of something on the floor, making a small puddle that shone with his lamps glow. He wiped it with his pajamas, and quietly went back to his parent’s room to put back the boxes. He didn’t notice his aunt missing from the room, nor did he know that she was desperately trying to please herself but unable to reach orgasm in his bathroom. Now that she had seen, no, now that she had *experienced* forbidden fruit, her fantasies would never suffice ever again.

With that, she went back to bed, and remained awake well until the sun came up plotting ways to bring her dreams to life.

~*~

Fubuki drove you back home. Sunday afternoon. Your auntie had taken you out for McDonalds, and even bought you two happy meals that you’d eat back at the house. Kenji was in Hana’s couch, lazing around as a man musts after an excruciating week of work.

Your auntie spoke to you, while she drove, and you saw the trees pass you by.

“So, Anon, is there any girl in your class that you like?”

“No.” You replied bluntly.

“No one?~”

“Nnooo.”

“Hmm? Come on, you know you can tell me!”

“Mmm, I, like…” You lingered on that word for suspense, before telling Fubuki exactly what she had wished to hear. “You, auntie!”

“Aww, Anon!” She giggled. This is it. She took a turn on a street you didn’t remember.

“Auntie, wrong street.”

“It’s a shortcut, sweetie.”

“Ohhh.”

Fubuki scouted her surroundings. A street secluded and deserted, and a small alleyway to do the deed.

“So, Anon, you like me?” She spoke as she turned the steering wheel, her heart beating louder than a motorbike being revved up.

“Yes!”

“Do you love me?”

You blushed. Love is a strong word! But it was your auntie, you couldn’t say no.

“Y-Yes.” You let out.

“Well, I love you too!” Fubuki stopped the car and then undid her seat belt. Her hands were shaking with excitement, as her tongue licked her lips imagining how it would feel.

You didn’t panic at the decrepit alleyway, not while your auntie was there. At most, you felt discomfort because of a ripped bag of garbage spilling it’s contents out onto the floor.

“Anon, do you want to play a game?”

“A game?”

“Yes, a game that you can only play with people you love.”

She doesn’t mean that, right? You knew what she was speaking of, but you weren’t sure.

“H-How do you play it, auntie?”

“I can only tell you if you want to play it. Do you?"

You were unsure what to answer, and you didn’t. Fubuki’s hand took your silence as a yes.

First, her fingers caressed your cheek, but it wasn’t the usual, warm caress she would give you, it was instead needy, as if she wanted your cheek to melt into her hand.

Fubuki’s lips came closer, and met yours in a long, long kiss. Fubuki had no hurries, and no worries. Nothing will step between her and hew nephew, she will show him just how much she loves him.

Her hand now lifted your shirt, and ran a tour of your prepubescent body all over. Her fingers gently brushed your nipples, and made you recoil in panic. The sensations running through your body, you feel dirty again, dirty all over…

But how can you be dirty, when your beautiful aunt is the one making you feel it?

You gave in to her kiss, and tried to grope her breasts, Fubuki giggled lecherously as she pulled down her shirt and bra down to reveal her left tit to your eyes.

“Go on…” She spoke.

You touched the boob with shyness, slowly fading away as your aunt’s labored breathing became louder and louder. Your lips grazed her nipple before sucking it, causing Fubuki to salivate like a starved dog. Drool ran down her chin, she kept wiping it over and over but was unable to make it stop. Now she aimed for your pants, as you felt her fingers sliding inside your shorts, you panicked, and yelped in surprise. Her calming voice came to your ears.

“It’s okay…” She muttered subconsciously. 

And so, you let her drag both your pants and your underwear down, revealing your small, erect penis.

Fubuki closed her fingers around it like a ring, and jerked you up and down in slow, calmed motions.

Your breathing was erratic, you couldn’t resist making obscene sounds and pants by now, and in the peak of your high, Fubuki brought you higher.

After letting her tongue cover your tip with dripping saliva, she slowly lowered her head and made your penis disappear into her mouth.

You head jerked back, Fubuki, watching closely every little one of your reactions, every last movement of your body. She tilted the seat backwards so you’d be more comfortable and quickly undid your seatbelt.

You looked at your aunt’s smug, lustful eyes, the eyes of a woman who knows that she was the first woman to take you in more ways than anyone could conceive. Hana came back to her mind for a second, and she laughed internally. Her son is hers, she knows that already, but she’ll never know just how much you *love* your auntie.

Fubuki sucked. Short, rhythmic pants were escaping you with each contraction of her mouth, twirling around your dick, her tongue lusciously trying to wrap itself around you, hot dogging you with her cheeks to make her mouth smaller and more fit for your size.

The feeling of hotness is back, and you want to stop, you’re scared of what comes after.

“Auntie, auntie!” You plead, falling onto deaf ears as Fubuki puts all her focus onto making you cum.

And then, nothing comes out of your penis, but your body twirls in pleasure, clutching your auntie’s head with both hands. Your vision blurs from the sudden shock that ran through your spine, and with that, you regain focus, and see your smiling auntie, who had just given you your first dry orgasm.

She smugly swallowed her saliva and delighted herself as your penis went limp. 

“We can play this game whenever you want, as long as you don’t tell anyone.” She spoke as she saw you regaining your breath.

After you nodded, unconscious and dealing with the feeling of wanting to pee, Fubuki started the car again and drove you back home.

Hana came back that night, thanked Fubuki for her help, and even offered her some money so she wouldn’t feel in debt, but Fubuki refused. 

She assured her that spending time with her nephew is her favorite thing.
