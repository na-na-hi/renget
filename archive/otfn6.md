>you were D class but you knew what that meant
>you'd heard stories of a unkillable monster
>the organization would roll out something to try and kill it
>and it never worked
>you'd thankfully worked far away from keter duty like that shit
>you were D class but you weren't a murderer or anything like that
>just press ganged into it
>on the plus side free grub and essentially light duty
>but 682 was amok right now
>in the same facility
>you'd heard the thing was like some sort of adaptive angry lizard
>so just what the fuck was with the thing in front of you
>feminine yet monstrous
>capable of just bursting through a wall
>the multiple eyes were a dead giveaway
>682 was right in front of you
>you prepared for a violent death
>it was in your room and blocked the exit
>frozen against the wall, you flinched when it noticed you
>then it pounced

>what came was not a killing blow
>you'd closed your eyes for the moment
>as if that would have helped
>instead of death you had a long tongue shoved down your throat
>682 had almost unhinged its jaw around your face to shove himself deeper
>clawed hands gripped your jumpsuit
>you really had no idea to react
>your body did
>and apparently HIS body did
>klaxons continued to blare and the red lights flooded your room

>you could have sworn he tested your gag reflex
>he leaned back and sat on your chest
>you got a good, less panicked, look at him
>clearly a him
>due to the whole strange cock now peaking from a slit in his crotch
>it leaked you guessed the equivalent to precum onto your jumpsuit
>his claws right over your ribs put things in perspective
>he could kill you
>instead he just looked down at you
>all five yellow eyes
>man that was weird as fuck
>the red harsh light gave him a weird glow
>long hair was in wild tangles and hung to the floor when he sat on you
>was his ass grinding on your dick?
>at least you weren't dying
>maybe
>a containment team kicking in your door almost gave you a heart attack
>their guns were trained on 682
>his head turned towards the team as he made what sounded like a pissed off gator bellow
>"get the fuck away from me! they sent you here to die and buy time!"
>you grabbed 682's massive clawed hand
>that got his attention and his eyes softened when he looked back at you
>4 men with guns didn't bother him now
>his heavy tail rested on your legs
>the containment team seemed as confused as you
>eventually everyone stood down after a few minutes
>somehow you pacified 682
>that day 682's logs had an amendment made to them
>a new containment program
>you
