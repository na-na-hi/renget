##Intro
https://www.youtube.com/@Onolumi/ is a cute Vtuber that plays retro games, this is about an ARG hidden in some of her community posts. Every 3k subs on the channel there's a community post thanking her subscribers. My account of the early days of her channel and /vrt/'s involvement is limited as I am getting most of this second hand, I am a new bot (2 month member) so I will try my best to add context, but I may get things wrong.

##ARG Posts
####3k Subscriber Post

While it wasn't noticed at the time, if you are going into this knowing it's an ARG you immediately notice the bot in the bottom left with the blinking light. This is morse code: -.- . . .--. / - .... . -- / -.-. --- -. - .- .. -. . -.. or KEEP THEM CONTAINED.

Again at the time this was posted nobody thought much of it, but upon returning to it the letters were found to be an encrypted key which once solved read: KEEP THEM PACIFIED.

This one was more obvious and triggered people going back and looking at the other posts. The falling blocks when put together form a QR code.

When scanned the code reads: KEEP THEM ALIVE.

This one is the first one considered unsolved, some anons found that if you take all the letters used in the words you get a root sign: âˆš

These are the corresponding member badges with how many months you've been membered, as a reference for the chips in the GIF.

This one was easy to solve, it's a barcode that once scanned reads: Z- EMOTIONS, or Z EMOTIONS.

This one is also considered unsolved, using the F, L and R on the monitors as Forward, Left and Right respectively and starting on a grid with the arrows pertaining to the starting direction the letters Gb, or alternatively G6 were found.

####Special Mentions

In this video made by Lumi as a highlight reel of sorts there is a particular timestamp, 80 seconds in, that seems to be of some interest. It might just be more atmosphere building, but best to keep it in mind.
