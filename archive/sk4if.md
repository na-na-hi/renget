>You're dead
>You died and went to hell
>This place isn't really that bad to be honest
>Mainly because you're met someone
>Someone you're actually about to visit and hang out with
>You knock at her door and wait for the hellhound to show up
>You remember her adoptive father is gonna be away for a whole week because he's serving some royalty as his private bodyguard at some important ""political"" trip
>Loona opens the door and before you can greet her she grabs you by your shirt and pulls you inside until you're her room.
>"You're late" she sits on her bed and grabs her phone to check the time "20 minutes late" Oh, she's not happy
>"Hey.. Yes I know, and I'm sorry! But I got you something!" You hand her a small package you've had in your pocket for the last half an hour
>"What's this?" Her expression still doesn't change but you noticed her ears perking up a bit
>"It's a gift" no shit, Sherlock - you think to yourself " I mean it's something I want you to have"
>Loona shreads the small package open with her claws and takes out a brand new collar. You've made sure it has the same style as her current one, it was hard to get but you know she's gonna love it.
>"Ah, that's a pretty cool collar, so what's the occasion?" She asks tilting her head a bit
>Oh boy, here we go
>"Well" you get up "It's been a few months since we've met and I think I need to ask you about something"
>Loona squints her eyes at you "Yeah?"
>"Y-Yeah" you pause "I mean.. I got you that new collar because I thought that maybe we could.." 
>"We could what?" She gets up "We could what?" 
>You take a step back "I mean.. I just wanted to"
>"Oh, I think I know what's going on anon" 
>"You do?!" Holy fuck, that's really happening
>"Yeah! We've been hanging out so much lately, you've been there for me a few times and now it's finally the time to be honest with me, right?"
>You can't help but smile at the hellhound "Exactly!"
>Suddenly she grabs your crotch with her left hand and squeezes it hard
>"W-What are yo-" you squeal
>"Oh, I bet you can't wait, right??" She turns around still firmly holding onto your balls only to push you on her bed
>"I want to HEAR you SAY it" Loona growls at you
>"LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND SAY IT" She squeezes harder
>You try to get up she pins your shoulder with her claws so you can't move without getting hurt
>You don't know what the fuck is going on
>"Say what?! What's goin-" she squeezes them again
>It hurts but you're starting to feel something else as well
>"Don't play dumb with me or I'm gonna bite them off" she's not letting go of them
>"Loona PLEASE" you let out a long whimper
>For some reason your dick starts getting hard
>The hellhound exhales, you can see she's trying to calm herself down
>"What do you think about me?" Her voice sounds different now, it's calm and.. sad?
>It's hard to sound confident right now but you try to anyway"
>"W-Well uh.. I.. we, we've been-" she lets go of your balls and rests her hand on your crotch. This time she's gentle
>"I'm a hellhound, I can smell you've been jerking off before you came here. Just like the last four times we've been hanging out together". 
>You feel your cock throbbing in your pants, her hand is still rubbing you through your pants. You try to not look at her but she grabs your head and holds it in place
>"Keep looking at me, I'm not done." You nod "That new collar you got me today? I know that brand and it's an expensive one. Very hard to get, especially here" she pauses for a few seconds "So you've been hanging out with me, playing a friendly guy all this time, and now you you got me a gift because you think I'll let you fuck me?"
>"No! You got it all wrong!" She's about to say something but you continue
>"Please, just let me explain myself, okay? I like you way more than as a friend, but it wasn't like that before, I swear! I've learned how I feel about you a month ago.." she's looking you in the eyes in silence
>"I just wasn't sure if those feelings were real, okay? At first I was glad I've found someone who I can just chill with, someone who likes similar music and doesn't need to get wasted at parties with people you don't even know. But then you started opening up a bit, you told me about how.. you got adopted and other stuff you've had to deal with..
>I couldn't stop thinking about you Loona, there wasn't a day you haven't been on my mind at least ten times. I wanted to be honest with you today, I remember you told me your collar gets a bit worn our so I got you a new one.. you have to believe me Loona, I wouldn't lie to you like that, I value you way too much. I don't want you to think I could ever use you this way, I don't want to los-"
>"I believe you"
>You would never think hearing just three words would have that effect on you
>"You do? you aks with a cracking voice
>"Yeah" Loona exhales " just look at you, you're about to fucking cry" she giggles "besides, you got soft even with my hand rubbing your cock the whole time"
>You notice something is happening behind her - Loona's tail is actually wagging a bit.
>Then you look at her face and see a slight blush through her white fur
>Her ears also perked up a bit
>"Loona, are you.. enjoying thi-" she cuts you off "HEY, you're the one who got hard from me squeezing your balls!" 
>"You scared me anon, you really did. But now.."
>You look into her eyes and see something new, something you haven't seen before yet. There were filled with something.. feral?. 
>Your head feels a bit dizzy and you start feeling tingles in your chest. 
>"Loona?"
>She doesn't move for a few seconds until you hear her start to growl. 
>Suddenly she gently bites the right side of your neck, you can feel her fangs pressing hard against your neck but not hard enough to actually hurt you.
>Then she lets go of your crotch and scratches your stomach with her claws, ripping your shirt and leaving a few long scratch marks on your skin.
>You feel her fangs gently digging into your skin as her warm salvia dribbles down your neck.
>Loona's tongue starts moving up and down the sensitive skin of your neck. Your cock is throbbing in your pants as you've never been that turned on in your whole life. Both, on earth and in hell so far. 
>You want to say something but you just start moaning instead
>Her hand goes back to your crotch but this time she places her hand on the bulge in your pants, there's just a thin layer of some material  between your dick and her hand.
>Loona lets go of your neck and looks at you again. This time it looks like she can control l herself
>"Did you like that, Anon?" Her hand is gently rubbing your bulge
>"I.. I did, but..I told you how I feel about you.. Do you feel the same?" you just realized how hot you feel right now
>Loona smiles at you "It depends"
>The hellhound grabs you by the crotch again and squeezes your balls with her palm, this time a bit harder than before
>You open your mouth and whimper as her other hand scratches your chest, leaving a few light marks
>"Ah L-Loona!" you moan. It hurts a bit, but a part of you finds some pleasure in that pain
>"This is how I want to treat you" she growls right into your ear before licking it
>"This is how I want to show you how much I like you" you can feel her tongue on your neck again
>"Are you sure you love me, anon?" now she drags her claws againt your side left side"
>"Yess Loona" you moan "I do, I love you Loona!" She laughs
>"I'm scratching you all over and crushing your balls, yet you're throbbing in your pants and moaning my name"
>You're panting and shaking from the excitement, not sure what's gonna happen next "Please!"
>She moves closer to your face "Are you ready to be mine, anon? Are you ready to be owned?" 
>"YES" You almost scream desperately
>Loona suddenly bites your neck again, this time with more force. Her fangs pierce the left side of your neck. Not deep enough to cause any damage but enough to make you bleed and leave marks of her fangs.
>It hurts.
>You open your mouth to scream but she quickly kisses you and swallows those sounds you're trying to make. You can feel her warm tongue exploring your mouth to find yours.
>She's making out with you. Loona. And she tastes so good, even with the metalic taste of your own blood..
>She lets go of your crotch and grabs your head with her hands from both sides. That lasts about half a minute until she breaks the kiss and looks at you.
>"I like you too anon" she gets up and grabs a box of tissues from her desk to wipe the blood from your neck.
>It stings you but not as bad as before. 
>The hellhound moves your head to the side to look at what she did to you. She smiles to herself and grabs her phone to take a picture
>"I really like you"
