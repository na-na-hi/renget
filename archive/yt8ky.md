>Mari was starting to get frustrated with Sunny.
>The Recital was getting closer and he still couldn't get past that one note.
>And that wasn't the only reason, either.
>For someone who begged to be a part of the recital, Sunny's heart really wasn't in it.
>Sometimes, she found him studying the wrong set of music sheets.
>Other times, he kept trying to weasel out of practice early.
>The only time he ever really focused was when Aubrey came by to watch.
>But it wasn't often enough to offset the issues.
>Quite frankly, the elder sister was this close to kicking Sunny out of the Recital.
>And then she woke up one night, only to find Sunny absent from his bed.
>Absent from the house, when she checked. Same for his coat and his violin case.
>That was the last straw for Mari.
>It didn't matter that tomorrow was the weekend; she was going to find Sunny and sideline his butt so hard.
>She didn't bother waking her parents before slipping out into the night.
>It was pretty cold out, but she brought her coat with her.
>She checked the Park first, but no one was there.
>Same for the shopping plaza.
>Couldn't be at the Rodriguez household; she would've heard Kel if that was the case.
>Only other place she could think of was Basil's house.
>But as she approached the street, she faintly heard some music.
>Violin music, coming from the other side of the crossroads.
>Mari slowly approached the source, using the trees as cover.
>Turns out that the violin player was none other than Sunny.
>And he was.... playing in front of Aubrey's house?

>It was a smooth, romantic piece too-- a clear step up from the effort she usually saw from him.
>Mari then noticed Aubrey poking out from the second story window, hands propping up her cheeks.
>But she's never seen Aubrey's eyes this soft, nor her smile this big.
>Was this the reason behind Sunny's behavior?
>Did he half-ass their practice so he could serenade Aubrey?
>Mari wouldn't lie; she was still a bit ticked that he'd purposefully fumble the Recital.
>But she found it much, much harder to stay mad at him.
>Not when he was being this romantic.
>Sunny's piece soon ended, and Aubrey gushed over his performance.
>She gave him a big, distant kiss, and Sunny almost keeled over in shyness.
>It took everything Mari had to not coo at the sight.
>Then she motioned for him to climb up to her window.
>Oh god, he's not actually going to try scaling the wall, is he?
>But no, he went for a nearby ladder.
>Mari sighed in relief as Sunny safely ascended towards Aubrey's outstretched hands.
>He let her pull him into her room, and Aubrey closed the window.
>Mari waited a few seconds before slowly starting to walk back from the trees.
>Once she cleared the crossroads, however, she started cooing and giggling.
>Despite the inconvenience it brought her, she couldn't be prouder of Sunny right now.
>Her little brother knew what was important in life.
>Maybe the Recital didn't need to be perfect after all.
>Mari soon passed by the Rodriguez house, glancing at the window to the brothers' room with a smirk.
>Now that she thought about it, Sunny's performance gave her a wonderful idea....
