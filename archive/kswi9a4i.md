->A Cursed Valentines Day<-
->**Febuary 14th, 6:00 AM**<-
Yoru awakes to the sound of a special alarm, groggy from a night of fun.  She almost immedietly throws her covers off and runs into the shower.  Today was the ONE day where she could really solidify her love between a certain three indivuals and she had PLANNED this, at least a week in advance!
She works fast, conditioning her hair in a matter of minutes with minimal self-admiration in the mirror before brushing her teeth on putting on perfume and doing a quick makeup job: She didn't need to look like a supermodel(yet) consider her destination.  She throws herself into the most disgustingly modest dress in her closet, a mustard yellow long button-up dress with puffy sleeves she would wear to mass whenever Yoji badgered her into going.  Much as she hated to say it... he was helping her have a better handle on the lust demon in her brain, even if it was all under the pretense of corrupting him into a proper man who doesn't let faith lock his member up.
She throws a white cardigan over her shoulder as her purse bulges with makeup and essentials for leaving the library.  She slows down so she doesn't wake the Amaryllis up at the very lest before slipping her mary-janes on and swallowing her pride to go church.

->**7:30 AM**<-
Yoji was releaved to see Yoru showing up, even as the rest of congraation was not.  She had a reputation for unorthadox and lewd prayer requests and a particuler way of singing which many compared to Adult Video Idols(Not that they would know of course).  Yoru at least dressed herself with dignity in the house of God(and nowhere else) alongside her usual routine of weekly confession.  Always in the early mornings and never too late in the day since she didn't like "losing her slut power".
He sighs as she apporaches the confession booth and his brothers look at him: Yoru was his problem given the fact the was very candid with every little misdeed she did over the week and would often try something lewd through the window. 
God knows he does need that sort of attention, his scheme to keep bothering her about church while he was at the library was pride enough to make him feel good about the whole escapade.

Yoji took his place in the confessional, prepared to hear the depraved ramblings of his lust-cursed congregation member.  She sits down with an oddly elegant pose and adjusts her cardigan.
"What sins do you have to confess on this day, Yoru?"
"That I'm smitten by you of all people" she says, handing him a small bag of chocolates,dark and rich but loosely cut by unsure hands.
Yoji sighs as he remembers the holiday: "Yoru, you understand my vows, we've had this conversation before.  I cannot engage in the pleasures of the flesh, let alone with one as addled by sin as you.  You do not need more stimulation, you need to earn the obediance of the voice in your mind which compels you to engage in such filth through denial of stimulation and pleasure" 
"I know but... but.."
%purple% "He wants to be broken: he's begging for it under that sweaty collar.  Srtip off the skin of decency and use him for pleasure if he's too much of a coward to use you~" %%
Yoru closes her eyes and bites her lip as she tries to stop her hand from unbuttoning her dress, biting hard enough to draw blood as Yoji escorts her elsewhere.  She draws the eyes of the congregation as she is taken to the rectory.  He puts the blinds down and looks at Yoru mercifully with a hint of smugness.

Yoji holds the trans girls hand: "If you have more sins, please confess them.  Your soul is clearly weighing heavily on you"
"I've been having erotic dreams of you watching me flagellate myself, letting my sins out through blood and then laying a robe over my scarred back.  The blood almost soaking through as you comfort me and-"
"Please, I know where stories like this go" Yoji says blushing a bit at the visual.
"Call me slurs, tell me you hate me, anything!  I SHOULD'NT love _you_ of all people!"
Yoji watches as Yoru looks angry, her impulsiveness on full display as she stares at him with her challenge declared.  He could berate her, demean her, or hurt her and let the impulsive demon in her head win and release the precsous and addictive dopamine she craves.  Instead, he chooses to ask what Jesus would to himself as he looks at her with a slight smile and clasps her dainty hands together.
"Yoru: I'm flattered, really.  Were things differant... I may have taken your offer: both of them.  But I am a man of God and a follower of Jesus Christ"
The girl looks away from him, blushing as he meets her want for abuse with refuting kindness.
"Redemption is not scarring your flesh, or even sealing evil spirits for you: It is taming your lust and learning to live a normal life despite what you have done to yourself.  If you have uncomfortable feelings toward me, then perhaps you can volunteer with the church so we can work together more or allow me on your sealing hunts"

The priest grin is wide as Yoru of all people is blushing like a schoolgirl first grappling with the concept of love.  She leans over the table and tries to kiss him, but he manages to have her land on his cheek before he lightly pushes her back into her chair on the other side of the desk.
"Your lucky I didn't wear lipstick or there might be rumours about you smooching me~" Yoru says, her confidence returning a bit as Yoji laughs it off.  
%purple% "Lead him on, he is already your darling: make him your pleasure thrall if he will not use your perfectly sculpted body for its intended purpose~" %%
Yoru giggles as she imagines Yoji in bondage leathers before standing up: "T-Thank you, I'm sorry for being hysterical.  She Who Thirsts has been quite loud these days but... I feel her quiet down after seeing you"
"Your always welcome as long as your soul is in need" Yoji says as he escorts her back out, the girls large and darkly colored eyes gleaming under the lights as she stares at him with appreciation.

He was a reminder that she had a choice in how she lived: That self-control was possible when she wanted it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->**10:00 AM**<-
Yoru's next stop was the one she was looking forward to most: Hinako's mansion.
Once let inside by the staff, she goes to get herself ready for her doll darling.  She sheds her conservative church clothes for a purple and black baby doll and matching lingerie.  She kept her chest small but noticable as she let her purple hair down and dip her makeup: Smoky black eyeshadow with purple glitter over it with sultry scarlet lipstick and mascera to enhance the look of her eyelashes.  She knocks on Hinako's door once ready, the staff looking away from her with second-hand shame. 

Hinako looks over Yoru and practically salivates, and thats before she hands her a bag of chocolates: "I made them special, just for my darling~" Yoru whispers in her ear as she passes and looks over the countless dolls in her workshop/room.
"Yoru, I actually wanted to get some... referance photos of you all dolled up, like you are now is so perfect.." she says, wrapping her hands around Yoru's waist and hanging her chin off her shoulder.  
Yoru blushes at the aggressive move, loving the attention: "_Anything_ for you, darling~"

->![Dollhouse Set](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E7zphtaVUJAw1og.jpg)<-
Hinako personally sets up the scene in her yard: a set of a dollhouse bedroom with all of her spare Yoru dolls posed to look at their inspiration.  Yoru kisses and fondles a doll of Hinako, as if instructing the doll versions of herself on how to please their creator.  Both of the lust-cursed girls cannot help but go further with this special day of true love.  Hinako herself gets talked into putting up curtains around the set and stripping into her own lingerie. 
Yoru wraps her legs around Hinako's and presses her close, letting the dollmaker stand over her. 
"Your so shy, its really cute~" Yoru says
"I never thought I'd be this intimate with you, Yo-chan.  Its always much easier to get photos with dolls, and my dolls are like an extension of myself"
"Do I feel any differant now that you feel my _heat?_"
"Yes.. your like if Aphordite descended down from the clouds and chose me to render her form into glorious art... you'll always let me honor your beauty, right?" Hinako says with heavy breathing as Yoru giggles.
"Who else can I trust to depict _every_ aspect me?~"
Hinako reaches for the strap on Yoru's baby doll, slowly pulling it down past her shoulder.

Then the sun blared in, and Hinako's parents look at them both in disgust.
"Young Lady!  How many times have we told you to not bring dirty hookers here!  If your going to do this at least don't let the neighbors see it!" Her mother says as her father pulls her off of Yoru.
"You: grab your things and leave before I call the police" her father says threateningly, Yoru walking walking off her arms crossed.  She gathers her things and doesn't try prudes patience.  She is driven to a street corner to save face.  She attracts as many eyes as possible as she casually walks about in her lingerine to a place to change her clothes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

->**4:00 PM**<-
Yoru wears a pair of tight short shorts and thigh-high stockings with a simple v-necked t-shirt with a pink and blue striped pattern on it, hiking on a mountain trail beside Mari.  She wears more modest hiking clothes and carries the groups dinner in her bag: some sandwiches Mari had made for when they reach the waterfall at the end of the trail.  
Mari looked down at Yoru with a slight smile: while Yoru was technically older in years, she had less experiance controlling her curse.  Mari had spent long years trying to keep destructive rage under control: if she could do it then Yoru had hope of stability some day.  

The two walked in relative silence as the sun had started its setting and much of what Yoru wanted to say to her first Darling was non-verbal.  This was a day to engage in a deeper, romantic kind of love as opposed to the debauched sort of things Yoru liked having an enraged Mari do to her in the privacy of her own room at the library.  

"Yo-chan, did... you go on any other dates today?" Mari asks as they walk hand-in-hand.
"If you wanted me all to yourself then all you had to do was take me away, I won't fight back with you~"
"...You don't... have anymore dates planned then, I hope" Mari says with a irked expression: Yoru had a problem with loyalty, at least as far sticking to one partner like most people did. 
Yoru simply smiles back to Mari and cuddles her arm: "You'll keep me nice and safe, right?  If any of my old boyfriends come looking for chocolates I don't have any left to give them~"
"I thought you chose a secluded spot for a reason..." Mari says a bit awkwardly.
"Well yeah, you like quiet and peaceful places.  So I found a place you'll love!" Yoru exclaiams, embracing Mari as the taller girl puts her arm around Yoru's shoulder possessively as they reached the end of the trail.

As the sun set behind them, and the only sounds around was the chirping of birds and the running of the waterfall in front of them, Mari took the scene in.  No demons to worry about, no betrayals to watch out for, not even school or family stuff to worry about.  She could for a moment, let the part of her keeping a leash on her own personal demons relax a bit knowing nothing would agitate the monster of rage and anger that she was deep inside.

A differant sort of beast is roused in her when she sees Yoru fling her short aside to reveal a skimpy bikini bottom in dark purple with black frills.  She locks eyes with Mari as she takes her time casting her shirt aside and stepping into the water.  Yoru lets her hair down and looks toward Mari longingly as she lifts herself up to the dirt shore and flips her hair, the water droplets catching the rays of the setting sun as they scatter with Yoru arching her back to put her small but shapely front-facing assets forward. 
"Darling, can you bring me my sandwich please?~" Yoru says as Mari blushes and walks over.  She almost stumbles over herself to find Yoru's meal, her eyes never leaving the gaze of Yoru's.
"I-I um... didn't bring a swimsuit.." Mari says guiltily, as if looking for a reason to beat herself up.
"It alright Darling, I might have slipped a towel and a spare bikini into the bag~" Yoru says with a giggle as she kicks her feet in the water, grinning in aniticpation for the next step in her master plan.

Mari opens a side pocket and finds a shiny black bikini with a red lace pattern over it, having the look of lingerie you could swim in.  
"Yo-chan this is... ummmm... a bit much..."
"Oh come on, its just us girls.  I went looking everywhere for a swimsuit which captured your essence.. your dominance.. your dark strength.  At least try it on for me?"
Mari blushes and sighs: "N-No pictures then" she says firmly as she turns her back to Yoru and takes her hiking clothes off, and dons the skimpy swimsuit.  It shows her muscles and her scars in equal measure.
Yoru swims over and stares in awe as the two enter the water together, there vibes matched in peaceful quiet as they float on the mountain lake, holding hands and not concerned for the time.
