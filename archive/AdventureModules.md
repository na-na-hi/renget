# SoloAI's Adventure Modules

[TOC]
# What is this?
Adventure Modules are like outlines created to guide your Mythic adventures. Ready-made scenarios  so you can simply create your character and play without having to think too much about the story behind the game. These were introduced in volume 11 of Mythic Magazine, and in this document I will teach you how to play with them using the methods described in [SoloAI](https://rentry.co/SoloAI2) as well as how to create your own. 
!!! note Important!
    Be sure to read the Mythic GM Emulator manual and be familiar with its concepts before using this!

# Instructions
## First Scene
> A fully detailed first Scene provides the start point for your Character and will likely be more detailed than a standard concept for a first Scene in a Mythic Adventure. This is like the opening monologue from a Gamemaster as they begin an Adventure, setting the tone and place and what your Character is doing and facing.
In the normal Mythic, you create your first scene to introduce you to the adventure, and start playing from there. But here your first scene is already created, you just need to place your character in it. With Novelai, you must describe the first scene in detail in your New Story, or copy and paste the first scene described into some adventure module already created.

## Populated Lists
> The Threads and Characters Lists will begin with some entries already filled in, many of those elements pulled from the first Scene. The Threads and Characters Lists would come with elements already on them, such as goals and Characters introduced in the first Scene. There may be other elements on the Lists too, such as Non-Player Characters your Character has not met yet.
Here, take time to write down in lorebook entries the information about the characters, so the AI will know how to interpret them when they eventually appear in the adventure. Optionally, you can also write down in Memory the goals of the adventure.

## OPTIONAL - Location Crafting
>A Solo Adventure Module should also contain Locations to explore with filled out Region Sheets along with any special instructions that go with them. These are the places your Character can discover and explore, such as dungeons, villages, mansions, graveyards, etc.
Location Crafter is an expansion of Mythic with its own rules for exploring environments. However, because it is a system by itself, explaining it here would be too long. You can read about how it works in Mythic Magazine #11, as well as in the Location Crafter manual. 

On the other hand, for those who already know the system, locations can be created to add flavor to your adventures. You can implement these together with the AI by simply asking it to describe the room to you using the [ Story: ] command, but being careful to state which elements you already know exist in the scene. Example [ Story: Describe the lobby of the abandoned ship full of old tables and murderous ghosts ]

## Keyed Scenes
>As discussed in Mythic Magazine #10, Keyed Scenes allow for pre-programmed events to take place in an Adventure. By including Keyed Scenes in a Solo Adventure Module you make sure that the Adventure stays on track toward its theme.
As written in issue 10 of Mythic Magazine, "a Keyed Scene is a new type of Scene that is designed with a trope or concept in mind that you want the Scene to enact". Keyed Scenes have Events and Triggers.
**Events:** A Keyed Scene Event is what you want to happen in a Keyed Scene. Whatever you want to happen in your Adventure can be baked into it as a Keyed Scene Event. When that Event comes up, it becomes a necessary part of the next Scene making that a Keyed Scene.
**Triggers:** The Trigger is what tells you when a Keyed Scene Event happens. Just as you decide what the Events are, you also decide what Triggers them. Triggers can be virtually anything you want them to be, from specific events to happen that trigger the keyed scene, to even "just wait 5 scenes and event happens". You can think of the Keyed Scene Trigger as a sort of If/Then computer statement. If X happens then Y happens.

# Adventure Modules
Below are some examples of Adventure Modules already created. Feel free to use these as examples to create your own, or to improve one you have already created and customize it to your liking. 

You can even get some scenario already created for Novelai and transform it into an Adventure Module, just by making its prompt the First Scene, transforming its characters and objectives into Characters and Thread lists, and creating places and Keyed Scenes for them. 

## /aids/ Deck Adventure - Nightmare Realm
*Strange beings lurk in the shadows, unknown to the general public. A secret network of operatives known as AIDS (Agency for Investigation and Detainment of the Supernatural) studies and catalogues these many paranormal phenomena. It doesn’t matter whether it’s ghosts, vampires or aliens, the agency will handle them all—the truth is out there.*
