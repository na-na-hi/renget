[A.] Camera's rolling now. So this is going to be some footage for the top guys to see where the development of the DS remake for Super Mario 64 is currently going. Standard stuff for this company, just following the general procedure. Just going to be exploring the castle area today and seeing if there's any faults in the level design. Collision breaking, accuracy to the original game and stuff like that. 

[A] Lower levels of the castle have been pretty much accepted as normal so we'll just have a look on the top layer. I'll be skipping the starry room with Tick Tock Clock. There's a bit of an error there from what I can remember but I wasn't told to check that today so I'll leave it be.

[A] So from there, we'll be going to the room with Wet Dry World and Tall Tall Mountain. Not so shabby here, although I'll note down that the clouds are a little bit off colour there...This is starting to bring back some old memories. I'll try not to plague the recording with that stuff though. I'm sure the top guys don't want to hear some old man reminisce.

[A] Check the staircase...yep, still as endless as ever. Same as it ever was. Just a bit different in presentation...just a bit. It's weird, having to do this back then and getting back to it now. It's like I'm giving my memories a fresh coat of paint. Hard to tell if it's a pleasant feeling or not. Least I'm getting paid for this, not too sure if I'd be playing this game if I weren't. Nothing against the game of course. Is just some strange memories.

[A] Tiny Huge Island is more or less the same too. So far, pretty good. Probably better than how it was at least...Maybe. All that's left to be checking is the Mirror Room with Snowman's Land. Apparently the guy's have been thinking of hiding a star behind the mirror but only with Luigi and a powerup he can use. Currently playing as Mario but we'll see if they managed to get it right.

[A] At the Mirror Room now. So far so good, the other Mario matches up with the movements pretty well. Pretty ordinary stuff so far...

[A] ...Where did his head go? That's never happened before. Not even sure if that's possible as a glitch, this has to be jotted down. It happened when I ran over this spot. Maybe it'll come back when I run to a different spot? Let's try moving here to see-

[A] The...the game just broke. We're just on a red screen of death now. The camera must've caught that, it should've caught that. Thought this kind of shit wouldn't be happening again...Well. Sorry for the impromptu end to the showcase. Going to get this checked out, maybe they can fix the game or whatever.
