# /gbfg/ Crew Directory

!!! info LAST UPDATED | Actively maintained as of
	September 25th, 2021 | February 8th, 2022
	
	**NOTICE (Nov. 2022)**
	I've obviously been pretty behind on updates -- at the moment, the plan is to just scrap all the past GW score data and start tracking stuff again starting from next GW, in January. Any updates to recruitment info that's changed since then will also be solicited then. Sorry for the inactivity.



The date last updated represents the last time substantial info (e.g. a new crew, scores, or recruitment policy info) was added to this directory. The maintainer date is more or less an occasional signature that the maintainer will actively update this paste. If the maintainer signature has not been updated for some time (two or three months is a good sign that I'm fucking dead), you are welcome to clone this directory, maintain your own version, and replace the link in the OP so /gbfg/ has an up-to-date listing.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

**Q: "Do you have any recommendations for crews to join?"**
A: If you're here looking for a crew to join, GW / UnF activity as recorded here is typically a good measure of a guild's stability and what you can expect should you join. For new crews, just take them at their word for now in their recruitment posts... for the most part.

Take into account the recruitment policies as they're listed here, compare them against what you're willing to do, and wait for a slot to open if need be. Crews that are recruiting will generally post in thread about openings; the recruitment policies as they are listed here reflect their last known recruitment posting. Unknown recruitment policies mean that the crew has not had a known opening since this directory's last update, or that any previous known policies are seriously outdated.

Please don't dump your alts on /gbfg/ crews unless it's advertised as welcome. If you're looking for a crew able to reach the top 2,000 in crew rankings, see the question below to understand how these crews are identified in this directory.

**Q: "What do the numbers / letters in the Guild Wars records section mean, and why are some months bolded?"**
The letter in brackets is the tier they qualified into. There's no way to track whether the crew ranked up aside from /gbfg/ reporting; if a rank-up is known, the scores in both tiers will be listed separately. 

Contributing members are listed beside a crew's W-L record for a GW. The number inside the parentheses denotes those who made it into the highest reward tier (currently 80k), and the number outside denotes those making it into the lowest tier (370k). The cut-off ranks have expanded several times since their introduction (the original tracker counted members in top 20k / 80k respectively).

A bolded month denotes that the crew made it to the **top 2,000 crews for that GW.**

Unite & Fight W-L record is taken from /gbfg/. As all scores are self-reported, data may be incomplete and/or inaccurate.
Contribution records prior to September 2019 are from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kfUi2GNcwXobEWnG_sdqPQu2r5YSLNpk
Contribution records from September 2019 onwards from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f6DJ-u9D17CubY24ZHl9BtNv3uxTgPnQ

Only scores over the previous 12 months will be recorded. The scores of inactive crews will not be recorded.

**Q: "What's the criteria to be listed in this directory? <crew> is unironically reddit, why did you include them? <crew> is /gbfg/, where are they?"**
A: The criterion for continued inclusion in this directory is inclusion in the post-GW contribution tracker in /gbfg/ (more commonly known as the "leechlists") posted after every Unite & Fight. I have no interest in crew drama, and any bullshit in thread asking me to remove crews for any other reasons than what I've listed here WILL be ignored. Please don't sabotage any crews, new or current, by posting recruitments in their name on non-/gbfg/ communities without their knowledge. I will ignore any requests for removal that reference posts obviously not made by the actual crew.

For new crews looking to be added who have yet to participate in Unite & Fight, I ask only that recruitments be posted solely in /gbfg/ and optionally, in SENSIBLY /gbfg/-related Discords (but NOT as a substitute for recruiting in the thread) or on any active /vmg/ threads, if any. Obviously, postings on gaijins / GBFI / the GBF Wiki are out of the question. 

If a new crew that has been posting on /gbfg/ as of any ongoing Unite & Fight event is not in the pastebin, please quote the OP of an active thread during Unite & Fight with a request to be added if you wish to see your crew listed. It's the most reliable time to catch me browsing the thread.

There have been issues in the past where people would fight over which pastebin to include in the OP over this, partly because it was up to the maintainer to use some sort of vague standard for which crews to add or keep. Therefore, please bother the leechlist anon (you can find him in /gbfg/ at the end of Unite & Fight) instead so the directory can keep neutral of all this garbage and actually do its job. 

Crews that historically existed on /gbfg/ are listed at the bottom and separated from the active crew listing, and are preserved for historical reasons. A crew will be considered to have gone "inactive" if its most recent leechlist posting has a supermajority (~75%) of its members not ranking, and no recruitments for new members are posted on /gbfg/ within the week following GW.

**Q: "How do I view a crew / guild in-game?"**
A: To view a guild:
Menu \-\> Friends \-\> Search \-\> ID \-\> Enter ID \-\> Click portrait \-\> Scroll down to Guild \-\> Details
game.granbluefantasy.jp can be replaced with gbf.game.mbga.jp for the mobile browser version. This won't work if either the crew display or the profile is set to private, obviously. Or you can use the referrer links listed below. Just keep in mind that if you're using AndApp or the mobile app (or just any version of GBF without a URL search bar), the only real way to reach crew pages in-game is to find them through the profile page of a member who publicly displays their crew.

Bear in mind that the number of members in a crew can change often, so this directory does not track active openings or recruitments. The Strike Time hours listed below are in JST (+9 UTC), and are subject to change. 

Crew recruitment posts on /gbfg/ will typically link the crew page directly. Otherwise, they may include the ID of the referrer, who often has the crew they belong to publicly displayed.

**Q: "What's with all the missing data?"**
A: All match scores are self-reported, and crews don't always respond to calls for scores. I've done my best to fill in gaps in data, but score data as a rule will be incomplete, albeit otherwise accurate.
 
Furthermore, due to the private guild feature added in May 2017, some guilds occasionally won't have contributing members added. While /gbfg/ crews typically (briefly) un-private their crews for the purpose of the leechlists, irregularities happen every now and then. A crew's contribution data will be marked as (PRIVATE) here if it was known that the crew's data was private, and (UNKNOWN) if their contribution wasn't previously tracked. 

## CURRENTLY ACTIVE CREWS 

Some crews may have two entries under Strike Time. The second entry will list Strike Times for that crew during Unite and Fight, if they are known to be different from regular Strike Time schedules.
