>days running through the sweltering jungle
>you were running low on supplies
>your journey from the shore was a long one
>it had been filled with danger
>the second you had mentioned audience with this "vampire queen" things had gone awry
>initially the river tribe you had met had guided you
>then when you got to a bridge near a waterfall that's when they turned on you
>near the rushing waters it was sword and shot versus spear
>normally you'd be able to bottleneck them on the bridge
>take them one by one
>they spoiled that
>one of them was dumb enough to rush you and take both of you off the rickety rope bridge
>what your assailtant lacked in brains he made up for in the mass that cushioned your fall
>he was a mess across the rocks
>you had enough time to catch your breath before running off
>eluding the rest of the tribe down here would be impossible if they knew you were alive
>that's when a lucky break came to you
>after a few more hours of trekking through the jungle you came to a forgotten cave
>growth over it gave it a sort of camouflage
>you could rest in there while you planned your next move
>what you discovered within the narrow passage was what changed your plans considerably
>the city of the vampire queen was real
>as the forgotten passage showed you
>the city must have been cut into the mountains centuries past
>they'd forgotten such a small entrance that seemly led to just a peephole
>warm lamp fires could be seen through two holes in the rock in the back of the cavern
>they peered into the most majestic throne room you'd seen on the continent
>the figure on the throne no doubt the rumored figure you'd been searching for
>the issue was... that was not a queen and perhaps the vampire part was literal
>below you was a royal court almost like those of Europe, yet dressed in savage outward attire
>you'd stumbled through fortune into what you'd wanted
