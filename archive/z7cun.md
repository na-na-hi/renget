Penny and Matty RP

>>A walk around the hills surrounding Hogwarts was just what the Healer ordered. It had been a tough week of classes - well, not the classes so much, but the extra work I normally put in on side projects - just recently I had sneaked once more into the Restricted Section under a heavy Disillusionment Charm and managed to swipe a book on 'Fire Charming' written by a Sikh in the fourteenth century. It seemed promising, since I wanted to learn how to not only extend the range and power of my own fire spells, but 'take control' of outside sources of flame - for example making the fire of a torch strike out at an opponent like a viper. It was dreadfully fascinating work, but I -did- need a break.

>>The moon overhead cast pale rays down on me and the cool breeze ruffling my copper hair cooled me from the hot bath I had not-long left...

>>The path I was on suddenly veered to the left and I followed, crossing my arms behind my back, grasping my own wrist as I started humming a ditty my family's live-in maid used to sing.

>>The path eventually passed a large oak tree, it's tallest branches bare where lightning had struck it sometime in the past, though the rest of the boughs were flourishing. Under the tree was a stone bench covered lightly in moss and crawling ivy and I decided to sit for a while, my mind a million miles away with mental distraction, something that could prove fatal with Ranrok's Loyalist and the plague of poachers and Dark wizards crawling over the Highlands these days.

>>It had been a while since she had last spoken to him. After that night, after he had poured his heart out, after that had shared such passion, exploring each other. Outside and in. For her to simply leave without a trace, why? Matthias’ head was wracked with a pain he had never once felt before. Like the new wave of emotions he felt with Jihon, he was now feeling a grief completely unfamiliar to himself.

>>Then, a humming. It seemed almost angelic, its softness piecing the silence he had grown accustomed to since the sun fell earlier that day. It was only then he had realized how long he had been sitting there. The harmonious humming had grown ever closer and then stopped its approach. Behind the tree, it was coming from behind the tree, that’s right. There was a bench there he saw on his way there, but declined.

>>He stood up and peered around the tree and gazed upon an enchanting young woman with locks auburn that were illuminated by the evening glow.

You there, you’re that one student aren’t you? Penelope was it?

0

>>My stopped humming, my shoulders hunching as I reached for my wand, hidden as it was up my right sleeve, even as I pivoted on the mossy bench, stopping only when I say a young man in clothing of a fine make, including a featureless mask of pale porcelain, and a bowler hat, under which curled dark hair. I stood warily, bright green eyes flicking left and right, taking in my surroundings, looking for things to manipulate or charm and transfigure.

Yes... and who are you?

>I was normally a more courteous girl, but that mask was... unsettling.

0

>>I see, I’ve startled her, perhaps I should turn my palms over to calm her

>>he fully emerged from behind the tree baring his empty hands towards her in an effort to put her mind at ease. He wasn’t quite sure whether he should take her for a jumpy one, or if he had simply forgot the effect his masked visage may give off.

I’m sorry, it wasn’t my intention to frighten you, I may not dress it, but I’m a student as well. I’m Matthias Herdorum, of the Gryffindor house. I didn’t mean to frighten you, truly, o was merely curious as to the source of that beautiful-

>>did I just say beautiful?

Um, that humming…

0
>>I let out a soft woosh of breath and tucked a loose lock of hair behind my ear, as I had not tied it back in its usual plait and it fell in a thick wave of loose curls down passed my shoulders.

>>*Did he say 'beautiful'?*

>>I sighed and sat back down, this time facing the Gryffindor rather than the sweeping vistas of the nearby valley.

My apologies - the way the Highlands are currently infested with ne'er-do-wells has me jumpy. I'm more than capable of defending myself, but anyone is susceptible to a surprise attack.

>>I shook my head and smiled at you, hoping to move passed any awkwardness my reaction might have caused.

'That one student'? My name is Penelope Warwick. I'm in Ravenclaw. What brings you out here, Matthias?

0

Well you see, I…

>>I…I…

>>his body began to noticeably slack. A shivering overtaking his body. Why couldn’t he just say “I’m out for a moonlit stroll” or “I’m star gazing” perhaps these newfound twinges of beg were clawing at his insides, begging to be let out so some would could care for them.

I just, I don’t know. There was a girl you see…she was an odd irritating minx. A true vex whenever you crossed her path! She was as rude as she was conniving which is just would you would come to expect from someone like her. But then things became different. She began to open up to me, and I to her. Perhaps more open than I’ve ever been in my life. But, now things have grown even more different, where her visage was once all encompassing within these halls, she’s no where to be found! Like she just up and left! That’s what some student are saying anyways, and unfortunately I’m starting to believe it. But why would she? I thought we were- I don’t even know why I’m saying any of this!

>>As if coming to his senses he stopped himself from continuing further. Standing their in silence, body shaking from his outburst, unsure of how to contain his emotions now that the floodgates had opened.

0

>>I frowned in understanding - I had never been in love, despite a secret crush on a certain surly ex-auror brewing potions down in the dungeons (a secret that would never see the light of day if I had anything to say about it), but I was emotionally intelligent enough to recognize Love Sickness.

>>Standing from my bench I crossed over to Matthias and tentatively wrapped an arm around his bicep.

Come, sit with me…

0

>>his breathing became labored. This was becoming too familiar to him, and he feared a pain would not be far behind. He had began to pull away but could feel his body stopping itself. It was nice to have someone to hold onto. Even to be holding on to him. Even if it led to pain, perhaps even just this once it would be worth it…

O-okay.

>>he sat with her, she was still holding onto him, her head began resting on his shoulder. He could feel his cool skin becoming warm and flushed beneath his ghostly shell.

So…what is it you are doing? What is…this?

0


You looked like you needed to be comforted - well I assumed you did. The mask -does- make it hard to judge your mood. Thankfully you have a rather expressive voice, Matthias...

>>Penelope started humming again, a clear soprano, like a silver bell, and she smiled, drawing her wand and giving it a small flick, causing the immediate area around the bench to warm up slightly.

Much better. Now, do you want to talk about her? How did you meet? How did you become close? You don't have to answer if you don't want to, but as I understand these things it's useful to 'clear the air' so to speak

0

>>He was beginning to feel so at ease, it was not just the warmth of her charm but the warmth of her body next to his. It was a warmth he had feared he’d never truly experience again.

Well, we had only truly began to talk when a group of students decided to do a meet and greet led by a prefect who had deemed us all as “less socially abled” and wanted us to meet more students.
We didn’t because close until a while after that. She had called upon me to meet her in the bathrooms near the Slytherin Chambers. When I had gotten there, all I discovered was.

>>Matthias paused, he had realized we’re this story would go, but if she was this close to his person, perhaps it was okay if he divulged the details.

Well, what I discovered was her small frame, laid bare save for her favorite scarf and a pair of high waisted emerald…um…undergarments.

0

>>Penelope giggled into her hand, looking over the vast grounds of Hogwarts Valley.

Oh my, this young woman was so very forward, wasn't she. I must say that confidence, should be admired, at the very least.

>>Of course talking about undergarments made me think of the pair I was wearing, a lacy pair in Ravenclaw blue with a very special cut-out section - a gift from my mother (along with tutelage in a very special spell) when I came of age.

So shall I assume what happened next or would you want to go into details, Matthias? Don't worry about offending my sensibilities. I'm not as innocent as I might appear.

>>And wasn't that the truth, after the casual sex with several young men in recent days, usually after befalling some perverse magical trap involving the depraved whims of wizards long-since dead, encountered in her position as the de-facto leader of the Hogwarts Expeditionary Force.

>>his body was no longer shaking, he felt completely at home in her arms and ready to reminisce.

We, next I actually rebuked her, it was late and I was annoyed she had wasted my time all just to bare herself to me. But that’s when I noticed it, her trademark smile had faded. She began to lament her whole plan, and that’s when it struck me. I didn’t like to see her that way, and I wanted to amend the mistake I had clearly made. As she was turned away from me I lifted my mask and walked up behind her. She jumped at first but quickly began to writhe in excitement in my hands. They explored her soft and supple sides, moving down to her hips. Gently kneading her delicate skin. She felt like a flower, her touch was intoxicating, he scent was inviting. I began to slowly kiss her neck, with skin so warm it felt like her body was kissing me back.

>>he was getting lost in himself, lost in the memories of her. He could feel his loins throbbing and stiffening. He felt Penelope’s grip on him tighten, he turned to see what she was doing.

0

>>I smirked playfully as I heard the wistful tone Matthias was falling into - wistful was much better than depressed, it meant that you could think back on what you missed and appreciate it without being swallowed by it.

>>Looking down to where my arm was wound around his, I caught a glimpse of his lap, and the bulge straining against his trousers, and I stifled my giggle, giving his arm a squeeze before pointing down at his arousal.

That good, was it?

0

>>he seemed startled back into reality

Oh! My apologies! I seemed to have been carried away with myself!

>how shameful, to display myself so brazenly in this girl’s presence when I barely know her?! This is awful, I should leave at once

>>He had stood up halfway when he felt himself being jerked back, it was Penny. She hadn’t, or more appropriately, wouldn’t release her hold on his arm

0

>>My voice took on a coaxing, teasing quality, bright green eyes sparkling with barely concealed mirth.

Like I said, Matthias. I'm not as innocent as I might appear. If you want I could share a story? Make us even?

>>I didn't know what I was saying , that had just slipped out - that wasn't normally like me, but I had already said it and I wasn't the type to go back on my word. Ravenclaw I might be, but the Hat almost put me into Gryffindor for a reason, that being because Gryffindors charge ahead, a trait my etiquette tutors down in London had never really broken me of. Still there was no way I was going to mention Edraine's tomb and its aftermath, nor Jacob's ancestor... Ah! Got it... assuming he wanted to hear, of course.

0

>>frankly, the way she had pulled in his arm had excited him greatly. He could feel his girth beginning to press against his leg, pulsating, begging for some sort of attention. He figured he’d stifle it, in order to hear a pleasant tale. He had heard Gloria spin her tales many a time while visiting Jihon, but they were friends, it wasn’t odd. To him, Penny was a stranger, and he was eager to hear what sexual escapades would escape those decadent lips.
Sure, I think I would love to.

>>My cheeks felt a bit warm, but I eventually looked back out over the vistas and said,

I'm going to tell you the story of how I lost my virginity. It happened shortly after I came of age, you see. My birthday is in mid-April, so I was celebrating at school. I head up a... sort of club. The Hogwarts Expeditionary Guild. We investigate mysteries around the castle and study advanced magic in our free time...

Well, I say 'we' but really it's just me and whomever I can get to join me - it's appalling how little the secrets of Hogwarts interests most students.

Well, one night I had sneaked down into the restricted section - a common occurrence, let me tell you - to look into the legend of 'Bumfree the Splendiferous', apparently he was a bit of a 'hero' but also a cad with the Witches. Legend say that after saving Brocburrow from a score of trolls and hags, he celebrated by taking the town mayor's daughter to bed... Only for said mayor to catch them, Bumfree's 'wand' buried deep inside her gullet.

The Mayor took exception to that and Bumfree fled to Hogwarts where he became a Professor of Defense.

While there he built a secret 'training' chamber. I had assumed it would be a dueling arena, maybe a library full of rare spell books.

I set off to find it, only to run into Gareth Weasley, looking for a place to brew his latest concoction, when I told him what I was doing, he decided that sounded much more fun and he joined me on my 'quest'.

Turns out, though that Bumfree's Training Room, wasn't for magical combat or anything of the sort. It was a place he took (thankfully overage) students - witches - to 'train' them in the art of wand-swallowing.

Part of that training was a magical lock on the door that could only be opened when 'training' was complete. So you see it was rather fortuitous that I brought Gareth along, because I couldn't very well 'train' myself.

>>Again, I realized that most of my sexual experience involved traps laid by long dead perverts and I wondered if I was somehow cursed... Still, Gareth had been nice about things. Eager, too - though perhaps that wasn't surprising.

My goodness, the Weasley boy! Tell me you didn’t…

>>his voice had grown excited, having not been the most experienced wizard I. This field himself, he couldn’t help but want to know what it was like for other his age. Without noticing he had even begun to slowly run his thumb up and down his length while his hand rested upon his thigh. His eyes transfixed upon Penny’s lips, wondering just what exactly they’ve been doing.

0

Well of course I did. We needed to get out of there, didn't we? Luckily Bumfree included a 'training regiment' tacked to the wall of his room with a Permanent Sticking Charm. To pass 'Training' I had to suck him three times, swallowing each time, then let him take my pu-vagina. Then I had to bend over and give him my as-...rear-end.

And Gareth, said he was a virgin, too. I don't know if that's true or not, but if he was, then both of us walked out of those training rooms changed people.

>>I looked down at your lap, seeing your length pressing against your trousers, even the 'subtle' way he was teasing himself. An idea suddenly came to me and I hummed to myself, letting it stew for a while - to see where things go from here.

0

>>Penny hadn’t done the best job of hiding her traveling eyes. Matthias had noticed her gazing upon his member, bound by his now right an oppressive trousers. He slipped the arm she was gripping with his free hand he softly cupped the side of her face.
You wouldn’t perhaps, be willing to demonstrate the abilities you learned on your journey would you?

0

>>And just like that my idea came full-circle and I smiled at him, but I wanted to make sure - I didn't want to hurt him if he couldn't take me as I am.

Are you able to treat this casually? I don't mind having sex with you, Matthias. I'm rather worked up, myself and a-a shag will do wonders for my stress-levels, but I'm not looking for a relationship beyond friendship. Will you get attached to me? I don't want to hurt you so I need you to give me a straight, honest answer because you seem to be in an emotionally vulnerable space with your lover missing…

0

>>Penny’s words made it all click for him. This demeanor, this attitude it was a side of relationships he had never seen before. A friendship that could explore all aspects of a bond with none of the pain that came with leaving a lover. He took a deep breath, his hand then traveling to slowly rub her warm entrance through her pant. It was not only surprisingly warm but quite moist, he had supposed with both of their stories it’s no surprises she was more than a bit excited
You’ve taught me a lot in this small time, I’d like to see if I can make proper use of this new connection.

0

>>I let out a shuddering gasp as you inadvertently ground my trousers into my slit, bypassing any protection offered by my crotchless panties. I spread my legs a bit more and rolled my hips forward, pressing harder into your fingers, but I wanted to make this about Matthias, besides... He wanted a demonstration~

>> Moving closer, I slid off the bench and crawled around and between his legs, gently parting them with my hands on his knees before scooting closer, my face hovering above that tell-tale bulge. Smiling up at him, I deftly undid his belt, button, and zipper, fishing his cock out of his undergarments with a slim-fingered hand. It was hot, and hard, but the skin had that pleasing 'soft' feel that seemed to naturally happen to a man's genitalia - like a bar of iron wrapped in silk.

Oh~ That's a nice one. You know the muggles call this sort of thing a 'rebound'.

>>I winked up at him and removed my half-moon spectacles before leaning in to kiss this tip, collecting a bead of pearly pre-cum, looking back up at him and moving my lips together, smearing it around until my lips were shiny, as though I had just applied lip gloss…

0

>>Matthias’ head rolled back in ecstasy, he had yet to have someone suck his cock, let alone how skillfully Penny was doing it. He felt his hand a run through her Silky hair. Never grabbing, but gently brushing her hair while ever so slightly pushing her farther onto his gland. He could feel her tongue working around the head, the beautiful warmth of her mouth slowly tickling his cockhead, inviting it to make its way inside.

Ohhh~Gareth Weasley is a lucky boy if you preformed half as good for him. I’m beginning to feel quite lucky I found you here this evening

0

>>Soft suckles filled that little section of foot-path, my lips sealing around your head while I worked the flat of my tongue against your frenulum, all before sinking deeper, my cheeks hollowing with the force of my suction, and all the while I maintained eye-contact, having long since learned that most men loved that sort of thing.

>>Eventually, I managed to make it down about half-way, taking my time and enjoying your reactions, until your glans was pressing against my gag-reflex, but I simply took a deep breath through my nose and pressed forward like the Gryffindor I had almost become. There was a moment of resistance, but then you were sliding into my tight throat, my slender neck visibly distending and bulging with the shape of your hard cock. Then, holding you in my throat, I started to hum that same song from earlier in the night. It was an uglier version, not as clear, but doing so I was able to surround your shaft with the powerful vibrations of my vocal chords while I went to work unbuttoning your vest, scraping my nails lightly down your chest and abs.

0

>>Matthias’ hips began to thrust slowly as you lightly clawed at his exposed chest. His body wincing with each scrape. Unbeknownst to her, he was licking his lips beneath his mask, her small scratches were an intoxication pain that made him feel as though he was soaring higher than any hippogroff could dream of. His hands began to run down her fore arms as he moaned:

Harder, dig into me deeper.

0

>>I slowly ceased my humming, took a deep breath through my nose, and started to pull off with a powerful sluuuuuurrrrping sound, scratching your chest, even digging into the skin enough to leave red marks (but not enough to break the skin), before I pulled off your cock with a wet pop, a strand of saliva connecting your bobbing cock to my panting, parted lips.

Demonstration one, oral sex complete~~!

0
Wow, that was, you’re quite incredible indeed. That was a whole new experience for me.

>>I almost can’t believe I just did this. Was this the right thing to do…? Do I even care? No, this isn’t the time or the place.

Hard to believe that was only the first part, you must have put in so much work to escape.

0
>>I admit that the first time I was penetrated didn't feel all that good and could be qualified as 'work', every other time, and every other guy was fun... for the most part... eventually.

>>Shaking my head, I stood, unbuttoning my jacket and slipping it off my shoulders and then undoing the lacing of my leather vest, a garment that soon joined my outerwear. UNtying the drawstring of my trousers, I smirked and turned around, my rear-end in Matthias' face before I bent over and, making sure to wriggle my arse for him, slowly pull them down, revealing the crotchless panties I preferred bare inches from him.
