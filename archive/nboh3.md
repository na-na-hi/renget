For the time, for the place, for this fleeting instant, it was not alone.

A young spawn, a shard of the Gate, one that merely whirled in confusion as it was cast into the dolent spheres., lost confused and like to get caught in a sea for all millennia.

Lost to the stream.

Perhaps, it once thought, that it was best for it to slip away for good, to simply let oblivion itself forget it.

Let not its will pool beyond the petty limits of the inner and outer circles, let it fade away, a poignant non-existence.

But, such was not to be.

Intervention became unnecessary, its worst fear, unrealized as for a moment its mind crossed paths with a dreamer and his little home, odd flitting thing that it was.

Its dreams were...curious, starting and stopping with startling clarity. This was not special, it thinks.

Then for a moment, once more in the dark, its dream shined like a beacon in the ocean, and the old thing cannot help but turn its gaze.



Humans. one of countless races that burn and are snuffed out in moments to the void-denizens.

But to it, they were fascinating somewhat. So far from what it was, yet at the same time so close.

Ironic then, that its life falls to one. 

It underestimated this little dreamer. 

The grip he had on his headscape was...grand. 
Intricacy after intricacy, layer upon layer. 

If she were to be more heretical, she could compare him to the Nuclear.


This child was bound to a billion fates, each one much more horrific and wonderful as the last. The chaos was...different to her.

She was a being of wisdom, of the best choices taken, it was within her authority to know.

This one was almost beyond her. She was enraptured and annoyed. A challenge usually was.



To find itself drifting towards it, and now, trapped in his dream was more of a curiosity than an annoyance. A joke played by a bored toddler.


Indeed, this child was human. 

A blink of its eye, the passage of time shall take action, and he shall be an old frail corpse and it shall be free from here.


But that was before the dreamer himself finally found it, the inky form writhing in some distant corner of nowhere.




...



Funny little soft thing, he was.

He stayed by its side then.

He remained, when others did not.


Sunny, he was called.

It did not have a name.

Abbi, he decided then.

Abbi...

Abbi...

Mm.

Odd.



Odder still, he comes back.

Again.

And again.

And again...


He would come back again and again, willing and enthusiastic, all his insolence and endearing stubbornness.

It decided to reward the child one day, the only way it knew how.

Knowledge. Ask, and it shall give.

It was expecting something miniscule, answers to questions regurgitated throughout the ages ad-nauseam.

He asked about her, and Abbi felt a strange pulse of something within her.

It felt warm.


Perhaps that is where it all began.

Little star, it's shine was not as resplendent as the grander powers beyond...

But this one...

This one was her star...

Something special for being nothing more than an ant in the cosmic scale.

Because he cared.



Nothing more to do, Abbi spoke about herself, trying to compress her void of an existence in a way that his mind can comprehend.

Often, he wouldn't and he would make that cute tilt of his head when he did...

How troublesome it were. 

And quite strange too when she really puts more thought into it. 

Odd protrusions from it's torso that became other organs. 

A mop of hair atop it's head that he truly should take better care of.

Curious hands that softly petted her form. 

An alien face with adorable cheeks she wants to squish and pinch. 

A beautiful light in his eyes as he stared at her in such wonder...

Erm. Yes. Indeed. Very weird child. 



She talked and talked, sharing her life with something that should not comprehend.

Even still, her little star stayed there to comfort the lulling ancient she was...

...something for which she felt she couldn't properly repay...




Staying beside her titanic, abyssal form, they shared a connection deeper than anything physical can produce, sharing thoughts soft as snow, feelings like gentle winds.


It took her a while to realize she had changed.

It was not a bad change.


For once, in her life, where she spent existing merely as a scrap of wisdom of the All-In-One, she...wanted.


And her form shrunk, and coalesced.

She wanted to take the form of a human, if only to feel normal around her little star.


Abbi.

She has decided she loves the name.


...


One day, he will not return, and in the distant future, she too will fade away, absorbed back into the blackness she came from.

Then...make this memory count.


Let her have this moment, loosely snuggled with little Sunny as they stared out at the beach the child had visualized.

He softly told her of this summer, of how he enjoyed such menial activities with his friends.

It sounds nice.

She wants to be a part of that too.

She asked if she was a friend too.

He nuzzled her then, best friend he called her.


...

Cuddle.

Cuddle cuddle.

Ehe.



What she would give for a moment in his reality...

She's taking quite the step.

The painting they made together, she spoke of helping him, and encouraging his creativity.

That was only a part of it.

Another, was that she was gathering faith.

The more people acknowledged her existence, the better the chance that one day, she will be able to take even the smallest of steps in his world without tearing the fabric.

Art. She thrived in art. Drawings, scribbles, paintings, oh how she adored it.

And it just so happens, that her little star was about to take on even more art!

It was not one she was used to, but the sounds he wove with that violin was one she would be willing to hear for an eternity, how he handled the wooden construct, his face of concentration, the enchanting but admittedly rough melody he wove...

Aaaah, look at him go!

It was coming soon, this beautiful duet they had planned.

And she would be there too, imparting her presence across the masses, she can't wait.


She will not be forgotten.
