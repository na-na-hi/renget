##### `Lifemate Anxiety`
>You and your wolfur sit on the ground leaning against a wall, her arms hugging you tightly against her chest
>"SORRY-SORRY-SORRY-SORRY" She repeats, words sometimes devolving into anguished sobs
>Her apologies do little to dull the pain coming from the left side of your face
>Aside from the pain there was also a warmth trickling down your neck, it must still be bleeding
>When she's run out of different ways to say sorry she loosens the hug to talk to you face to face
>The fur around her eyes is soaked with tears, and she visibly cringes when her eyes briefly glance towards your cheek
>"Anon, I didn't mean to do it, you have to believe me!" She desperately implores. "It's just-I-we're-we're a mated pair anon. Bonded for life. You know how much that matters to me, right?"
>You gently shake your head in an affirmative
>She's suddenly devoid of remorse, her teeth bared and words almost snarled
>"Then you know how I must have felt when you came home smelling like some other woman. The scent of some foreign canine on your skin, her blond fur on your shirt, and you tried to act like nothing was wrong!"
>But then her ears droop and eyes moisten with fresh tears
>"I should have believed you when you said your shirt got torn at work and a friend offered you a spare. I should have believed you."
>Her voice cracks
>"B-but I was just so mad Anon. We were made for each other, you and me. And it seemed like you had betrayed my trust mere days after proposing. I can't even bear to think of you being unfaithful. I know I can't find someone else like you out there and I got scared. So scared of losing you. Then I got angry at the thought that I had already lost you to some other bitch, that I wasn’t strong enough to keep you, and-and-and...damn my temper."
>She slowly moves her muzzle against your cheek and licks your wounds
>You're not sure if it helps

>She stops the licking and moves away from your head
>"Anon?" She says, voice low and soft
>"What?"
>"Don't let anyone else know about this. Please. I don't want anyone to think that I've gone rabid or something. All wolves have protective instincts but we aren't supposed to hurt our mates like this, even when it comes to keeping what’s ours. You know how much I love you Anon. It's just I let my emotions get the better of me and took it out on you. But I didn't mean to, it was a mistake, I fucked up, you have to believe me Anon. Please"
>Once again she hugs you tightly and cries into your shoulder
>While crying her eyes out you bring an arm up and gently rub her muscular back
>It seems to help her recover from the crying fit
>She looks at you with her bright hazel eyes, they seem to be filled with a determination you haven't seen in a long time
>"Anon, I love you, and I can only love you. We both forfeited our right to anyone else the second I claimed you as mine. You're going to father my pups, help me raise them, and when our days are done the first one to go will wait for the other in paradise. That's how it's going to go. Do you get me?"
>You shake your head and she raises her voice, sharp canine teeth bared and glistening
>"Good. Because I WILL NOT have you stolen away by some skanky cock breathed fur slut. I don't care if I have to make you see that I'm the only one. I'll rub my scent all over you, give you a claiming bite, record the conceiving of our first litter and post it on the internet so the whole world will know it ME that’s mated to YOU. I'll escort you to and from work, growl at any sluts that look at you, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll."
>She stutters then falls silent, words failing her
>In this delicate moment you bring a hand up and stroke her furry muzzle
>She closes her eyes and leans into your hand in response
>"Honey, sometimes I think you love me too much." You whisper
>She opens her eyes
>"No, I think I don't love you enough."
