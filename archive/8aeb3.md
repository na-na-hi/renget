# Post Editing for Dummies
This is a short guide for the completely clueless on editing posts on 4chan. Pictures soon!

## What will you need
- A browser
- Violent monkey: https://violentmonkey.github.io/
- 4chanX: https://www.4chan-x.net/builds/4chan-X.user.js
- That's it!

## Enabling the edit button
- Open 4chanX configurations
- Scroll down to **Posting and Captchas**
- Check **Edit button**

## (Bug) Double-posting when editing
A known bug, apparently you can fix it by re-installing Violent Monkey and 4chanX.

## (Bug) Edit button not showing up
The bug seems to be very common and might be related to people installing 4chanX from GreasyFork. Re-installing 4chanX fixes it for some people, but not everyone.
