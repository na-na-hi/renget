>anon got the vaxx to keep his job
>heard crazy people online talking about a shrinking side effect
>thinks they're all retarded conspiracy theorists
>after a week of being violently ill he shrinks to half a centimeter tall
>gets taken to the Fsizer lab to find a cure
>arrives in box with a bunch of other shrunken subjects
>most people are around his size
>though some are over 10 cm tall, giants compared to him
>nobody knows what to expect as the Martin scientist girl sorts people out by size
>anon puts on a tiny hospital smock as he wanders the terrarium
>the mood is oppressive
>these people look like they've lived through a war
>there's a slightly less disturbed looking man leaning up against the glass
>anon wanders over to him and makes introductions
>he looks anon up and down but doesn't say much
>anon asks about all the people, the news said there were only a few cases reported
>the man laughs, "she goes through dozens a day, bro"
>anon looks at the martin girl wandering around the lab
>shes humming to herself while looking at a clipboard
>there's easily a hundred people in the terrarium he's in
>a few dozen in some of the 1-10cm category next door
>and on the far table in front of the martin are four people over 10cm tall
>"too bad we couldn't have been a bit bigger" anon says jokingly
>the guy doesn't respond at all
>a few more people come to join anon and the guy he was talking too
>they watch the martin work but with more dread than curiosity
>the martin sets down her clipboard and reaches for a syringe
>"shes using the wrong size again" one man says
>"fucking awful way to go" says the man anon was talking to
>the first guy gets picked up and without much ceremony is injected right in the gut
>he immediately starts screaming
>"oh shoot" says the martin looking at the syringe
>she opens a drawer and slides the man into it
>his screaming is muffled once it is closed
>she grabs a much smaller syringe
>the two women and man that are left are shaking with fear and crying
>she proceeds with her injections
>they look pained but not crippled like the first man
>the martin puts them in cages mounted on the wall before turning back to her clipboard
>the screaming has stopped and she casually opens the drawer
>putting on a blue latex glove she pulls the corpse out
>she pops open a medical waste trash can and unceremoniously drops him into it
>anon is shocked to his core
>"you don't want to be big enough for an injection" says the guy
>he puts a hand on anon's shoulder
>"if you want to survive don't become an experiment"
>"wait for the cure?" anon asked hopefully
>"there is no cure, only survival"
>luckily there wasn't much excitment left in the day
>the martin left out some food before leaving, pellets made for mice by the looks of it
>anon couldn't stomach it but hunger gave everyone else the motivation
>some people soaked the pelets in the water dish to soften them up first
>no one seemed to sleep at all that night
>the martin arrived again early in the morning
>she set up some lab equipment including a sealed chamber
>walking over to anons terrarium with her clibboard she was mumbling to herself
>"series 178b, gaseous exposure 12 subjects"
>she set the clipboard down and pulled out another latex glove
>people began to run chaotically
>some gathered in corners hoping to be at the bottom of the pile and less likely to get picked
>others sat still; their spirits broken
>they were each picked up and rolled into her palm before being placed in the chamber as a group
>anon was standing too still watching the insanity of it all
>she reached for him next and he tried to run
>the blue claw tip punched him in the belly shocking him
>he was rolled onto a finger, and then her palm
>as he recovered more people were collected
>a sudden vertigo feeling let him know they were being lifted out of the tank
>all anon could think was "don't become an experiment" over and over
>he relized he was clinging to the latex palm
>directly bellow him was the open cuff of her labcoat
>her movement paused briefly and anon let go
>he fell down but missed going under the cuff and had to try and cling to the labcoat
>it was unexpectedly hard to grab onto, but about halfway down her forearm he managed
>the martin dumped the remaining people into the test chamber
>she closed the terrarium and removed her glove before counting the people out with a claw
>missing one, she stepped back to look at the floor to she if she dropped one
>it was safer to move the subjects one at a time, but she had so many trials today
>no red dots meant nobody fell at least, must have miscounted
>she sratched the back of her neck, crossing out 12 on the clipboard and writing in 11
>anon was dangling from her arm as it scratched her neck
>he looked down and saw that the lap coat was open
>directly below was a forest of orange fur toping her chest and poking out of a tank top
>anon let go and prayed for a soft landing
>the fur compressed only slightly for him but he held fast and wasn't injured
>anon held still as she carried out her experiment
>the eleven people were put in the sealed chamber
>a gas injector was put on the intake port
>she pressed a button and nothing immediate happened
>slowly the people inside coughed but they seemed to recover quickly
>they were transfered out of the sealed chamber and put on a shelf
>she marked their container with an experiment number
>anon paid little attention to what was going on
>he had avoided the test chamber but was now stuck on her body
>he couldn't get back to the terrarium and certainly couldn't trust her to help
>anon dug in just enough to avoid being seen and tried not to feel like a tick while doing so
>from his vantage point he watched the rest of her experiments
>she did check ups on the other experiments, using tweezers to inspect people
>from the pained expressions on peoples faces she did not seem to be gentle in doing so
>the people she injected yesterday were all dead
>the were disposed of in the medical waste bin as well
>as the day wore on anon grew hungry
>during her lunch she ate a packed salad from home
>anon watched as tons of chicken, lettuce, and dressing was forked into her mouth
>a crumb, barely a speck of crouton fell from her lip near anon
>a crust of toast covered in cesar dressing the size of his head
>he felt like his teeth might break on it, but hunger helped him power through
>after lunch she checked on the experiment anon had narrowly avoided being part of
>two dead, the rest looking very rough for wear
>she worked late into the evening
>at some point she unpacked a fresh box of new victims
>that guy had been right, dozens dead by the end of the day
>she never faltered or stopped
>it was strange to see someone work so hard at something so horrible in its results
>still clinging to her fur anon had no idea what to expect as she got on a bus and headed home
>her meager apartment had next to nothing in it, not even a tv
>she went to her spartan fridge and ate half of a sandwich leftover from some fast food place
>anon hadn't lived like this since college
>in the real world she was nothing, in the lab a cruel god, and she seemed not to care either way
>finishing up her sandwich the martin lifted her arm and sniffed herself
>anon was driven down into her fluff by her contortions
>she brought her tail around and sniffed it too
>before anon could realize what was happening she was shimmying out of her pants
>she threw them into a pile at the foot of her bed as she walked bottomless to her bathroom
>she pulled her tank top up and over her head
>the fabric dragged anon out of his hiding place and onto her shoulder
>the shorter fur here was much harder to grab
>especially as she was moving around to turn on the shower
>back of the neck anon thought
>no one washes the back of their neck
>he climbed to the base of her more hair like fur on the back of her neck
>anon dug into the roots of her fur
>the martin washed her fur quickly and efficiently
>while scrubbing her head she felt something weird on her neck
>she stood out of the spray and scratched at it
>her claw caught the edge of anons hospital smock
>his grip failed as she pulled him from her fur
>the smock came off of him with her claw and anon fell
>the martin brought her finger around to inspect it
>the water had already washed the miniature garment down the drain
>finding nothing and feeling the agitation gone she went back to washing
>anon fell for a long ways before slamming into something wet
>her tail had saved him from the drain
>his size had allowed him to survive the fall
>anon clung for dear life
>the majority of her tail was outside of the stream of the shower
>she finished up soon and stepped out to towel dry
>anon climbed to the base of her tail just in time to avoid the blow dryer
>the martin turned off the lights
>she flopped on to her single mattress which laid on the floor
>the light from the city still came in through her apartment window
>anon finally let himself fall from her body
>he lied exhausted in the dark valley made by her tail and thigh for a while
>she was still too anxious from work to go to sleep
>reaching off to the side of her mattress she fetched her vibrator
>a simple mechanical device to relieve biological stress
>anon stood up not willing to risk being caught off guard if she moved
>her fingers were exploring her crevice high above
>a musk began to fill his valley and he could only watch as his captor pleased herself
>in the distance he heard a rumble
>like a zeppelin the massive vibrator revealed itself
>his host worked the object into her sex and anon noticed her tail start to stir
>soft as it was he still didn't want to get barreled over by it
>getting nearer her thigh seemed just as dangerous
>the tail made his decision for him as it swept over his position
>clinging to the bed he avoided getting brushed aside
>she was close to orgasm now, which always required more specific attention
>pulling out the vibrator she worked herself with just her fingers vigorously
>the monstrous device crashed on the bed near anon
>tossing him in the air he could hardly hear anything over it
>the scent it brought along was overwhelming
>as she finished her tail brushed the bed
>she reached for the device to turn it off
>as it rolled over anons position he became stuck to it
>he felt like his brains were going to rattle out until she turned it off
>anons momentary relief vanished as he was lifted away
>stuck to the vibrator by her juices he had no choice
>he could only watch as she moved the device up past her body
>she dropped it at the top of her bed where her mattress met the wall
>anon barely avoided being crushed against the wall or smothered by the bed
>at this point his ability to avoid death felt more like a punishment than a blessing
>the martin quickly fell asleep after satisfying herself
>anon passed out as much as he fell asleep
>they were both awoken by her phone alarm
>anon was so sore he felt like he fought twelve rounds and lost badly
>the martin got up and quickly left for work before he had managed to climb down the vibrator
>anon realized his situation was hopeless
>he had just been clinging to life in a panic since trying to avoid the experiment
>if he didn't get her attention when she came home he was just waiting for a spider to find him
>mouse pellets in a terrarium was actually preferable to this
>to that end he climbed to the center of her pillow
>it took much longer than he expected
>sore as he was he fell asleep again almost immediately
>anon woke up in the evening to the sound of keys opening the door in the living room
>he got up and stretched so that he could hopefully wave her down
>she didn't come to her bedroom right away and he waited a couple hours
>she was eating and on her computer from what he could tell
>when she finally entered the room anon expected her to go to the shower
>instead she went right for bed
>she looked down at her pillow and focused right on the tiny human in it's center
>she blinked before sitting back up and leaving the room
>anon feared for the worst after she said nothing
>he wondered if it was a good idea to be in the same spot when she returned after all
>but the soreness of his muscles protested the idea of running
>fuck it he thought
>she soon returned however with a small plastic food container
>well small enough for her palm
>she leaned the lip down a few paces in front of him and told him to get in
>he did and she carried him back to the kitchen
>she set his container next to a legal pad
>as she took a seat she stared down at him
>she explained how she wouldn't be able to hear him
>in the lab she used a simple communication system for micros
>raise one hand for yes and two for no
>she interrogated anon this way for a while
>she assumed he had come from the lab
>though her questions were mostly in regards to how he was feeling
>it was more like a strange visit to the doctor
>and if she had any curiosity about what anon had seen of her in her home she didn't voice it
>eventually she told him she was going to inspect him closer
>before he could brace himself the pads of her paw grasped him and raised him to her face
>her huge orange eyes inspected him without emotion
>she brought him to her nose
>a hurricane of air whipped past anon as she gave him a slight sniff
>she recognized her own sent and it did pique her curiosity
>but it was late and she didn't feel like figuring things out with yes and no questions
>she put anon back in the food container and sealed the lid
>based on previous experiments someone his size would have days worth of air inside it
>she went to bed and anon sat against the wall of the container until he was able to sleep again
>he woke up in the middle of the night and paced to alleviate soreness
>in a few hours she was awake again
>he expected her to take him to the lab with her
>when she took her time getting breakfast anon remembered it was the weekend
>then again she seemed like the type to work weekends
>she popped the lid off of his container and dropped crumbs of something into it for him to eat
>some kind of muffin anon guessed from the taste
>she was writing on her legal pad for a while
>eventually she gathered her phone and set it on the table
>she put on a mobile earpiece and dumped anon next to the phone
>she told him she was using an app on her phone
>if he spoke near the microphone her earpiece would allow her to hear him
>she spoke to him in between sips of coffee
>"I think we should be training the micros to do something useful but my colleagues..."
>she paused thinking of the words
>"said it was degrading and dehumanizing"
>"what about the cure?" anon asked
>"we don't know what caused the shrinking or how to fix it"
>"I've been told explicitly that most of our experiments are just about getting rid of evidence"
>"actually the company is more curious about replicating the shrinking effect than fixing it"
>"you should see the difference in funding that team gets"
>anon wasn't sure if she actually expected him to care about the 'injustice' of her funding or not
>despite everything he'd seen anon was still shocked
>"you're okay with that?" he asked
>"the world has too many people in it anyways" she said with a sip of coffee
>"yeah I'm one of them" anon said angrily
>"not anymore" she said with a shrug
>"anyway I'm going to continue my personal research with you"
>"if we make progress I can sneak some more out of the lab"
>"no one really cares about the under 1cm subjects"
>"what the hell do you expect me to do at this size?" anon asked
>"whatever I tell you to"
>"but we'll see if micros like you can do anything useful first"
>"we'll start with stuff that doesn't require tools and work up from there"
>"teeth cleanings, ingrown hairs, pimples, claw care, that sort of thing"
>"you intend to use me for hygiene?" anon asked
>"its just a first thought"
>"but you guys are basically free to feed and can follow instructions like anyone else"
>"a personalized hygiene team might be a useful product"
>"we're also still not sure if you guys can breed or not"
>"and like I said no one really wants to answer these questions at work"
>anon was horrified, he couldn't comprehend wanting to force this condition on babies
>"who knows?" she continued
>"if proper tools get developed all sorts of repair or manufacturing jobs could be developed for micros"
>"you're basically talking about creating a slave caste" anon said
>"my bosses want me to kill you and disguise it as science"
>"you can always go back in the experiment pool if you prefer"
>anon said nothing
>"ok well that's about all the two way communication I can stand with you guys"
>"just follow orders for the time being"
>it would actually be the last time they spoke
>she preferred the one way yes/no system over listening to the micros
>over the next week she brought more micros
>anons explanations were of little comfort to them
>it wasn't long before she gave them their first teeth cleaning attempt
>the humid heavy air of her mouth almost made anon retch
>but then she adjusted her tongue and a man near the back fell down her throat
>she swallowed reflexively and made a note when only five of the six people emerged from her mouth
>anon lost the last bit of hope he had when she showed no concern about the person she was digesting
>she suggested using dental floss as safety lines next time
>the micros raised one hand in agreement
