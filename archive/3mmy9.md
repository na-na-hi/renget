Sweaty Tomboy GF

>Sunny and Aubrey were making their way to Faraway Park
>They were planning on meeting Kelsey there and then heading to Hobeez together to hang out
>Upon arriving, they saw Kel on the basketball court shooting hoops by herself
>"Oh, hey guys! Gimme a second..."
>She ran to the net and jumped, tossing the ball in with a swish
>After grabbing the ball again, she jogged over to Aubrey and Sunny with a grin on her face
>"You ready to head to Hobeez?"
>Aubrey just looked at her with a blank expression
>"Kel... you can't be serious."
>Kel tilted her head in confusion. "...so we're... not going to Hobeez?"
>"I'm not talking about Hobeez, I'm talking about what you're wearing!"
>"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?"
>Aubrey looked incredulous. "Just... look at yourself!"
>Kel gave herself a once-over. She was wearing a crop top with a sports bra on underneath; she had worked up a sweat from exercising, so perspiration was running down into the crevice of her chest, and her toned midriff was completely bared. The gym shorts she was wearing were a bit small; they showed off her long, tan legs and hugged her a butt just a little too tightly
>"I have no idea what you mean, Aubrey."
>Aubrey threw her hands up and started walking away in the direction of the plaza. "Whatever, let's just go."
>"Better hope there aren't any perverts around..." she added under her breath
>Kel looked at Sunny, who remained silent during this whole exchange
>"Do you know what she was talking about, Sunny?"
>Sunny gave Kel a long, deliberate look up and down her body, then shook his head and simply gave her a thumbs up
