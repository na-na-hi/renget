>Ghidorah
"I believe I'm familiar with the creature whose venom sac has been implanted in you. Quite troublesome things from my experience. I'd recommend you have its sac removed and dedicate yourself to the arts. There's nothing more flattering to girls than creating something in their name. Of course, I suspect your village wouldn't approve of that. Hmm. I suppose there are some techniques to grant you better control. Does that pet of yours have any innate abilities? Even if it doesn't, it's clearly loyal. It would be wise to take advantage of that and train it into a protector. Oh, you should take this joke book. You'll need it."

>Junki Takenaga
"Rather well-rounded I have to say. It would be simpler for you to tell me which of these skills you most desire to cultivate than have me guess. Perhaps it's better to say that I believe your ability to effectively lead this team should be developed first and foremost. Of course, that talent for making trees sprout shouldn't be ignored either. Whatever else you decide on will complement it. If you'd like to take part in a little experiment, then there's a rather beautiful flower that simply won't bloom under the Land of Frost's climate. Do you think you could replicate it so I can compare?"

>Sen Yamamoto
"Really now, I am more than certain that you would be better off becoming my assistant. Sensitivity should be cherished, but I fear a shinobi who refuses to kill only invites their own untimely demise. Even were that not the case, You would do well to well to remember that you won't soon forget the more unpleasant details of such a life. If you insist on pressing forward, then we shall pick up where we left off. Training you to see as I do is quite impossible. However, I can show you what to look for. The greatest of memories will be of little use if you're unable to sort out the clutter and focus on what matters. It's an unfortunate way to phrase it, but true for our purposes. Your ability to fill a scroll will also be tested. I haven't always had the luxury of writing from the comfort of my home with a cup of team in hand, and neither will you."

*Tsugumi peers into a crystalline orb, watching various figures flicker by as they carry out their routines. A hand scrawls down her thoughts as they pass.*

>Natsuo
"Work hard and play harder? It is a rather nice idea, but I find such advice only useful for those who do not enjoy their work. He doesn't stray from what one would expect of an Uchiha. If anything, he fully embraces their affinity for fire. I think I might like to experience the effect of his eyes and document the trip. A few shinobi talented in manipulating ice to deal with the dreadful heat is a necessity. Someone confident in their ability to subdue a beast would of course be a boon, but I suspect that finding such a person will be the biggest roadblock in organizing this expedition together."

>D
"I've noted his musical interests. I've also noted his lack of any inherent talent in the ways of rhythm, rhyme, or flow. Fortunately, he's pursued a career as a shinobi rather than a lyricist. As for his actual talents, his refusal to take advantage of one of the Sharingan's greatest strengths is pure foolishness, but he is quite capable with a blade and has impressive speed for his age. I must say that I greatly disapprove of him mindlessly seeking to imitate his brother, however. I'll have to tell Ghidorah to make me a puppet to drive him off the next time seeks to offend my ears."

>Himari Miko
"The Miko clan does not make use of conventional healing techniques, but they are nonetheless effective. While I've been fortunate enough to enjoy good health, there is no lack of those desperate enough to take extreme measures for the sake treat their ailments. This one's temperament is not too different from my own, but I have a feeling we would disagree on what is and isn't entertaining."

>Takeru Suzuki
"Could anyone who was not willing to risk themselves be a shinobi? I think not. That said, it may be more appropriate to describe his risk-taking as pure recklessness. I may not be keen on fighting, but he would be in for a rude surprise if he attempted to peek at *my* collection without the proper permission. I am more than willing to remind any who make that mistake that part of amassing such grand collection is the ability to defend it."

>Osamu
"Ah, a fellow academic. I do believe he'd have much more success with greater clarity of mind. His dedication to his 'daughter' is admirable, but certainly limiting. Not every goal can be achieved through, let alone those most worth pursuing. If she must be the focus of his work, then he should put more effort into making her wise."

>Shimabukuro Fumio
"What can I say? The coward may yet redeem himself, but it won't matter. Not if he cannot be at peace with himself. There is no glory to be found in accomplishing something children are made to do, so he will be sorely disappointed if what drives him is acclaim. Moreover, I am much more interested in what he will do if and when he succeeds. Will he endeavor to continue climbing the ranks? Muster up the courage to make right some wrongs?"

>Kichōna
"Osamu's 'daughter' as he calls her. As good a daughter as any, I suppose. There are much better ways to make friends than living a life of deceit and death, but those who stick by her will certainly be loyal. Or manipulative. It could go either way as things stand. I'll have to recommend her father seek out my services. He certainly isn't in any condition to teach her societal norms."

>Nodao-Douji
"A clan as bloodthirsty as the Kaguya, but with the addition of being shameless drunkards. One day they'll bring ruin to the Land of Fire, I'm certain. This one seems particularly troublesome. All it takes is the slightest bit of observation to realize that she loathes visitors from other lands. She'll make no small number of enemies, so it's fortunate that she's durable."

>Kamiko Karatachi
"I suspect some members of my team are disappointed that they became stuck with the babbling bookworm instead of the saintly jinchuuriki of their village. However, I believe she may be of more value to Sen. She should have a great deal of experience in managing her own sensitive nature, and may prove better at helping the girl in that regard than I. That aside, she appears to be a suitable vessel for Saiken who I believe has high potential to bond with the creature."

>Masukuda Rarime
"Clearly emotionally and socially stunted. Given her aptitude for disappearing, this was likely done through deliberate action on the part of her teacher. Unfortunate, but not uncommon. It is all too often that a child is forced to sacrifice things that they cannot even comprehend in the name of becoming a more effective weapon. Nothing but cruelty for the sake of producing yet more cruelty. I noticed her enjoying the company of frogs. I'll have to provide her with what books I have on the creatures, so she might find some joy even without their presence."

>Ichika Chinoike
"It's good to see that the Chinoike have recovered from their ill fortune some while back. Once you get used to the smell, the waters in the valley really are quite refreshing. I'd go as far as to say that I've written some of my best work while submerged in them. The young one's quite a bright spot and her willingness to listen to my my rambling is appreciated. Given her character, I do find her use of curses for healing an odd choice. She may turn out to be more self-sacrificing than her mentor. What I find more concerning is the strange person I noticed watching over her. Aside from myself, I mean."

>Kita
"I feel that shyness is preventing him from taking full advantage of his position, but I suppose there's nothing wrong with not taking the lead. There's certainly a market for those stories. His lack of boldness does seem to assist him in surprising others with those seals, however."

---

>Kiko Inuzuka
"My poor, poor student. She proved herself quite unteachable, so it's a wonder that she managed to find students of her own. I suppose it's proof of how little anything aside from the ability to kill is valued. Despite her general lack of manners and inability to even pretend she's listening to me, I must admit I have a soft spot for her. She's like a vicious, overexcited wolf pup."

>Remilia Orochimaru
"It's good that lisp of hers doesn't seem to hurt her confidence. I wonder if she slithered out of Ryūchi Cave and grew legs to frolic amongst the humans. It'd certainly make for an interesting story. That she has skill with poison isn't a surprise given her nature, but it is great enough to be worthy of noting. I do feel I'm noticing a preference for debilitating techniques amongst the young women of today."

>Itami Nanae
"I suppose any child of a clan has reason enough to act with a sense of pride, even if there is not currently much of a clan to speak of. I doubt that attitude will assist him in reviving his it either. At least he dresses nicely and has some talent to back up his boundless bravado."

>Kazen Uzumaki
"The destruction of Uzushiogakure is one of the more regretful events I've witnessed throughout the years. I wrote some other rather scathing reports at the time and did my best to salvage what little was left so it wouldn't end up in the hands of looters or callously be lost to time. The eas I can do is provide the young Uzumaki with what scraps I have of his clan's legacy. I do hope he can achieve his dream of reviving them, but I fear the steps he may take to do so will only cause more needless suffering."

---

>Ezaki Tuto
"While I've noticed some others enjoying my writing, he seems to be quite the fan of my more stimulating works. I hope he can be a bit patient while waiting for the next volume. He tends to act a little foolishly, but he has an excellent aura of mystique about him before he opens his mouth. I would like to know what lies beneath those bandages, but I doubt I'll be finding that out soon. The shinobi who conceal themselves even among friends don't easily let their guards down in my experience."

>Jin Hyuga
"His dislike of jujutsu, while not entirely unfounded, seems a tad bit extreme. I don't envision his stance persuading the young Chinoike. If anything, I expect this little feud to push them both to extremes. That nasty seal is no doubt an influence, but that's unlikely to be resolved without a change from the Hyuga as a whole. Even worse than any of that nasty business is the awful jokes he has a fondness for. Perhaps that is his true curse.'

>Shinrō Kamotai
"Interesting to see a ninja monk participating in the exams. He'd be better off not involving himself with any of this mess, but I suppose it's far too late for that. I'd be pleased if he at least dedicated more time to honing his artistic abilities. I need some new favorites to show off, and every showpiece needs a good story to accompany it.  A rare work by a ninja monk seems interesting enough."

>Yuma Kouda
"This one seems exceptionally useless. She'd be better off training to play the boogeyman of some backwater until a retired shinobi passes through and becomes the town's hero by making swift work of her. Of course, I know well that dojutsu are always in high demand. It's just as likely that she'll have her souvenir plucked from her head before she gets the chance to meet a grander end."

>Darkbone
"I've written a number of grim stories in my time and read even more. This one's just a bit too cliche to be interesting."

>Taihō Shiryō
"Two umbrellas? Perhaps they're popular with today's youth. I'll have to keep it in my if want to entice a younger audience. That aside, his confidence is actually quite charming. It makes how ill his fate appears to be even more unfortunate. I would be more than pleased to see Umigakure and other minor nations receive more recognition, though growth usually comes at the cost of blood."

>Ahiratsu Ōtsutsuki
"The world would've been better off if she drowned. It sounds cruel, but there are some problems you just have to nip in the bud. Oh well, I suppose it won't really change anything."

>Kuro Blackshadow
"She seems a tad touched in the head. Not so much that those of tender heart would feel compelled to assist, but enough that one cannot help but look upon her with pity. I'll admit that it is rather amusing. Still, what could it be that she hopes to accomplish by treating so many as sworn enemies? Perhaps she's simply hedging her bets. After all, if one of her 'rivals' does her in, it will seem more impressive than being killed by someone entirely unfamiliar with her."

>Kijyo-Douji
"The best of the worst, I suppose. It is quite impressive that she lacks any reason for her drunken behavior and is instead a mere normal lush. I can only hope that she inspires the rest of her kin to follow suit."

>Kamare Hozuki
"He'll hopefully find something better to do than become a shinobi. Service is a fine enough way to repay a debt, but there's no point in doing something you're not passionate about."

>Daiki Ueno
"A clan with a rather grim primary duty and some peculiar auxiliary functions. If someone chose to wear my face like that, I'd have no choice but to rise from the grave and hunt them down. I can't have an imposter running around ruining my image, after all. Not to mention the treasury of unearned knowledge. If he hopes to impersonate the living, then he will no doubt invite trouble from those of similar temperament."

>Engetsu Bōfū
"I have no doubt that the Land of Lightning's interest, and indeed that of many participating nations, in joint teams is not the result of a desire for cooperation. It is certainly an effort to secure foreign bloodlines, at least in part. However, it seems the Raikage will not live to see the seeds he has planted bloom. I wonder if I'll be hired to write his eulogy?"

>Fujiwara Nobutake
"He has decent manners. Oh, he's skilled in both blade and bow as well, but his manners truly are refreshing. I should make time to visit the Land of Iron. I'm not sure why he's taking part in the exams, but it is amusing."
