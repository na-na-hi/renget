I: That day, Tougou-san invited me to Kameya for some udon.
 
I: Itadakimasu!
 
T: Please eat whatever you want to.
 
I: Thank you! But why did you call out me alone?
 
T: I wanted to talk to you in private. Look at this.
 
I: (Tougou-senpai took out a notepad and drew a mysterious diamond shape on it.)
 
I: Is this the diamond suit of cards?
 
T: No. This... is the Hero Club.
 
I: Huh? What do you mean?
 
T: Try to think about the members that compose it.
 
T: Third years: Fuu-senpai for a total of one. Second years: Yuuna-chan, Sonocchi, Karin-chan and me for a total of four. First years: Itsuki-chan for a total of one...
 
T: In other words, the Hero Club has a lot of members in the middle age range, but extremely few in the younger one!
 
I: Now that you mention it...
 
T: Itsuki-chan, you must understand how grave the situation is.
 
T: Fuu-senpai is very responsible so she still comes to the club, but normally third years retire in autumn...
 
I: (I think Onee-chan comes to the Hero Club as a way to distract herself from studying for the exams..)
 
T: And by this time next year, we might end up retiring from the club already.
 
T: And you'll be the oldest person in the club, all by yourself!
 
I: Ah! You're right!
 
T: You're definitely the one who'll be taking over the Hero Club, Itsuki-chan. But right now you're being protected by the second and third years...
 
T: Next year, however, we'll be gone, and you'll have to lead it on your own.
 
I: I... I'm not sure I'm up to that duty...
 
T: And that's why we must give you special training now.
 
I: Special training?
 
I: Yes, for the future of the Hero Club!
 
Next day...
 
T: And thus, I propose to train Itsuki-chan so she becomes capable of carrying the future of the Hero Club.
 
F: Uh... Well, if she wants it.
 
I: I'll do it, Onee-chan! When I think about what's going to happen to the club when you or Tougou-san leave, I get really worried!
 
F: Itsuki's raring to go... Well then, so be it!
 
Y: Special training! What are we going to do?
 
T: All sorts of things. And I mean it when I say "all sorts".
 
K: Hearing the words "special training" come from Tougou makes me expect something extreme.
 
S: If you need a club president development suit, I can arrange for one to be made.
 
T: Karin-chan and Sonocchi, there's no need to worry. I'm not going to do anything weird.
 
F: I'll just warn you in advance: ideological brainwashing is out of the question.
 
T: Please relax, Fuu-senpai. Recently, I've finally come to a realisation.
 
T: Before, I was too obsessed with propagating the idea of national defence, and only thought of preaching it to others...
 
T: But just like true compassion naturally gushes forth from the heart, so must one's desire to protect the country. It mustn't be forced upon others.
 
F: Well, I didn't really get what you meant by gushing forth, but as long as you get, all's well.
 
T: Now, Itsuki-chan, it's time for us to begin your training.
 
I: Got it, coach!
 
T: Not "coach". Mentor!
 
I: Got it! Mentor!
 
F: Tougou, are you starting a dojo?..
 
T: The first quality that's important for a leader is composure. She who leads others must always act as a pillar of stability.
 
I: Got it!
 
T: Itsuki-chan. Starting now, you must not falter no matter what happens.
 
T: Now, put that apple on your head.
 
I: What is this supposed to?..
 
T: The apple falling will signify your loss of composure. Remain steadfast, without dropping it.
 
I: I understand, mentor!
 
T: And now, Itsuki-chan... Ei!
 
I: Hyaa! Why are you suddenly tickling my sides!?
 
I: Ah... The apple fell...
 
T: Looks like you still have a long way to go, Itsuki-chan.
 
I: T-This time I'll be fine! I can handle some tickling! Just... need to put the power into my sides...
 
T: I see...
 
T: By the way, Itsuki-chan. Yesterday after classes I saw Karin-chan and Fuu-senpai kissing.
 
I: Eeeeeh!?
 
I: Ah...
 
T: That was a lie, of course... But you still lack discipline!
 
I: I'll... do my best!
 
T: Next, I'll be training you in etiquette. Graceful behaviour attracts people and is key to making them admire you.
 
T: And to teach you the heart of wabi-sabi, let's have you learn tea ceremony.
 
I: Got it, mentor!
 
I: (And so, I...)
 
T: Next you'll be obtaining knowledge. A leader must be knowledgeable in various subjects. Read this book, this and also this one.
 
I: Got it, mentor!
 
T: And start studying intensely, because you have to be in the top 10 of your year on the midterms in the second semester.
 
I: G-Got it...
 
I: (Began receiving all sorts of training from Tougou-senpai...)
 
T: Once knowledge is yours, you must obtain strength. This black wooden sword I borrowed from Karin-chan weighs thrice more than an ordinary one. Give me 500 practice swings!
 
I: Got it!
 
I: (And to shoulder the Hero Club in the future, I developed!)
 
T: Itsuki-chan... You did well holding out throughout this training. Right now, you're more than fit to carry the Hero Club.
 
I: Thank you very much!
 
T: Itsuki-chan... This is your final trial.
 
I: Final... trial? What are we going to be doing?
 
T: Recruiting club members!
 
T: Just like your sister, Fuu-senpai did! Find a way to procure more club members!
 
I: Just like Onee-chan did...
 
T: When you accomplish that, you'll become the cornerstone of the Hero Club's next generation...
 
T: Now, carve the name of Inubouzaki Itsuki into the Hero Club's history!
 
I: Got it, mentor!
 
I: (But how should I... Go about recruiting club members?)
 
I: (For starters, I'll try inviting friends from my class.)
 
I: Say, do you have a bit of time?
 
Classmate A: Huh? What's up, Itsuki-chan?
 
Classmate B: Sorry! I'm already in the manga research circle...
 
I: I see... Don't worry about it.
 
Classmate B: Really sorry about this!
 
I: Aah... This is the fifth person who's declined.
 
I: Hm... First of all, the time is bad. It's autumn, anyone who wanted to join a club probably already has, and those that didn't wouldn't join a club in the first place.
 
I: But I won't give up! This is my final trial!
 
T: That's right, Itsuki-chan... I know you can do this!
 
I: (I spent the whole day asking my friends and classmates, but nobody agreed to join the club...)
 
I: (If it's this hard with first years, then second and third years are probably out of the question... Maybe I should look for a different way?..)
 
I: That's right! Time to consult Yaboo!Answers! 
 
I: "What should I do to find new club members in autumn?"...and sent.
 
I: Oh, there's already an answer. That was fast!
 
I: From KKBKMN: "This is a very typical method, but how about making fliers instead of just asking people around?"
 
I: I see... That's worth a try! When we were looking for someone who'd take a kitten in, I made a bunch of fliers, so if I use that experience...
 
T: The answer came in. "Thank you very much. I'll try making some right away".
 
T: Good luck, Itsuki-chan...
 
I: Alright, I got some club recruitment fliers printed!
 
I: And I got permission to distribute them on the grounds from the teachers... I put half up on the message board, and will give out the remaining ones.
 
I: (...But it takes some guts to hand out fliers to unknown people...)
 
I: (Onee-chan is amazing... She must've done the same when creating the current Hero Club... So I have to give it my all!)
 
I: The Hero Club is recruiting members! The details of our activities are written on these fliers!
 
Girl A: Huh, the Hero Club's recruiting? But why now?
 
I: Yes! There are various reasons, you see. Please, take one!
 
Girl A: Ah, my bad. I don't really feel like entering a club.
 
I: Ah... I see.
 
Girl A: Sorry!
 
I: Please don't worry about it!
 
T: Itsuki-chan...
 
I: Haah... Almost nobody accepted a flier today...
 
I: Will I really be able to find club members like this?..
 
Mysterious voice: You cannot give up here!
 
I: This voice!?
 
I: You're Tou-...
 
KKBKMN: I'm the patriotic warrior, Kokubou Kamen!
 
I: Uh, Toug-...
 
KKBKMN: Kokubou Kamen!
 
I: O-Okay! Kokubou Kamen-san!
 
KKBKMN: I've been watching your efforts from the shadows. I'll assist you in your recruiting.
 
I: T-Thank you very much. But this is my trial as someone who'll have to shoulder the future Hero Club... I have to overcome it myself!
 
KKBKMN: That resolve not to fall back on others right away is most commendable!
 
KKBKMN: But the reason I decided to help is because your hard work touched me deeply. Thus, this is also a result of your efforts.
 
KKBKMN: So I believe it's fair for you to accept my help and be proud.
 
I: Toug- Kokubou Kamen-san! Thank you very much!
 
KKBKMN: Tomorrow, we'll be handing those fliers out together!
 
I: Got it!
 
Next day, on the school grounds...
 
I: The Hero Club is recruiting!
 
I: The Hero Club strives to do its best for others! Would you like to join us?
 
I: Phew... The pile of fliers isn't growing any smaller...
 
I: (I wonder how Toug- Kokubou Kamen-san is handing them out? She said she'd help, but I can't see her anywhere...)
 
I: No, whether Kokubou Kamen is here or not doesn't matter! This is a trial that I must clear on my own!
 
Girl B: On my road to school there was a girl in a weird outfit handing out fliers. I guess she was cosplaying?
 
Girl C: Ah, I got one too. Fliers for the Hero Club, right?
 
I: (Ah... Since she can't dress up as Kokubou Kamen on the school grounds, she's helping out from the shadows like that...)
 
I: Haah... But of course, new members won't come that easily...
 
T: Itsuki-chan. How goes the recruiting?
 
I: Mentor! Thank you for helping out with the fliers!
 
T: What do you mean? I've done nothing of the sort.
 
I: Ah, right. It's nothing, forget about it.
 
I: About my final trial... It's pretty hard. I just can't seem to make a dent in it...
 
T: Of course... What sort of trial would it be if it was easy? But Itsuki-chan, you already have the power to ovrcome it.
 
T: I know you can do it. I believe in you.
 
I: Okay!
 
F: How long are those two going to keep that up for?.. I'm starting to get worried.
 
Y: I think it'd be great if we got new members!
 
I: Talking to friends and handing out fliers isn't enough. There has to be another way...
 
Girl: ...
 
I: (Huh? What's that elementary schooler doing? She keeps gazing at the sea...)
 
Girl: Ei!
 
I: (Eh? She took of her clothes... And there's a swimsuit underneath! Is she planning to swim!?)
 
I: Wait! Stop! The swimming season is over already!
 
Girl: Uuh... But...
 
I: Is there some reason why you want to?
 
Girl: You see...
 
I: (Apparently, she began going to a swimming class with a friend. But she can't swim, and she's having troubles learning how to.)
 
I: (And it gets even worse in front of people, she can barely move...)
 
I: (This girl is just like me back then... When I was having issues with singing...)
 
I: Alright! Leave it to Onee-chan!
 
Girl: Eh?
 
I: If you swim in the sea at this time of the year, you'll catch a cold. Let's go look for a heated pool.
 
KKBKMN: I've heard everything.
 
I: Toug- Kokubou Kamen-san!
 
KKBKMN: Let us look for one, using all connections at our disposal!
 
KKBKMN: It's me.
 
Sonoko (on the phone): Hey hey! What's up, Wasshi?
 
KKBKMN: I'm no Wasshi. I'm Kokubou Kamen!
 
Sonoko (on the phone): ...Ah, I see. Well then, champion of justice Kokubou Kamen, is something the matter?
 
KKBKMN: Is there an indoor pool one could use at this time of the year? If possible, one that's not too populated...
 
Sonoko (on the phone): Indoor pool? Sure there are, but ones that aren't populated... Okay, leave it to me!
 
I: Don't worry. I'm holding your hand, you'll be fine.
 
Girl: A-Alright.
 
T: Don't throw your legs when flutter kicking.
 
Girl: Okay!
 
I: Alright, I think you're becoming pretty good at swimming.
 
Girl: Thanks, Onee-chan!
 
I: No, you should be thanking Kokubou Kamen over here. She found us such an empty indoor pool, after all.
 
T: Well, I was called here by her as well... As an instructor.
 
I: (Ah, so Tougou-san isn't playing the Kokubou Kamen character right now...)
 
T: (Sonocchi's full of surprises, as usual... She must've reserved this entire pool, seeing as there's absolutely no one else here.)
 
I: Let's try swimming once again. Once your body gets used to it, you're not going to feel nervous at all.
 
Girl: Okay!
 
I: Practice makes perfect! If you can use that phrase that.
 
Girl: I'll try!
 
Several days later...
 
Girl: Onee-chan, I swam in class today! They even praised me and said my form was very good!
 
Girl: It's all thanks to you! Thank you!
 
I: No, extending a hand of help to people in need is natural. I'm a member of the Hero Club, after all.
 
Girl: Hero Club?
 
I: Yeah. Sanshuu Middle's Hero Club.
 
Girl: Sanshuu Middle... I'm going to be going there too! When I graduate next year, I'm going to Sanshuu Middle!
 
I: Toug- Kokubou Kamen-san!
 
KKBKMN: I present you, an upcoming student of our school, with this.
 
Girl: A flier? Hero Club recruiting members?
 
Girl: Yeah! I'll join! I'll join the Hero Club next year!
 
KKBKMN: Heh... The final trial: recruiting a member. Looks like you've passed it, Itsuki-chan.
 
I: Eh?
 
KKBKMN: The reason this girl became interested enough in the Hero Club to want to join it is result of your heroic efforts and devotion.
 
KKBKMN: And so... The join date might only be a year from now, but you've successfully secured a new member.
 
I: Ah... You're right... I did it...
 
KKBKMN: Well done... Itsuki-chan.
 
I: Thank you very much!
 
T: Itsuki-chan has successfully passed the final trial. I think she's fully ready to shoulder the Hero Club in the future.
 
Y: Congrats, Itsuki-chan! You're the future club president!
 
I: But that's still two years away. Next year one of you is probably going to be the president.
 
Y: Oh yeah, I wonder who's going to be the president next year. I'm not cut out for that stuff... Maybe Tougou-san?
 
K: Well, if nobody else wants to, I wouldn't mind being one.
 
F: Hmm... I wonder, who should I appoint? Not very confident about Karin.
 
K: And why is that!?
 
I: Heehee.
 
I: Next year... The one after... I wonder what the Hero Club will be like then?)
