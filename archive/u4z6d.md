##### `Moonlit Proposal`
>Five months to the day since you met your wifwolf girlfriend
>Back at the place you met, a tiny hardware store/deli/gas station
>weird combo of a place, but it made perfect sense for this little town off the beaten path
>you were just passing through on a trip to visit family
>car had trouble
>she helped you out
>you hit it off
>here you are, five months later, where it all started
>lazy autumn afternoon, only a couple other people in the place, no pressure
>sitting at one of the tiny tables, eating sandwiches
>you dig a small box out of your pocket, place it on the table and push it towards her
>She looks at you a little surprised and confused, either she's a little dense and not putting two and two together, or she doesn't expect this out of you and you've just fucked up an otherwise beautiful relationship
>feels like your heart stops in your chest and seconds drag on into eternity, like your whole existence is balanced on a knife's edge and oblivion is below
>she opens the box
>reads the little note "Will you marry me?"
>looks at the ring, symbolic knotwork and a moonstone setting
>her eyes get glassy
>"Of course I will you idiot."

>Back at her cabin on her family land
>emotions still high, joyous, right next to blissful really
>Beautiful strawberry blonde with grey/green eyes that's just agreed she wants to spend the rest of her life with you has you against a wall
>Her mouth is at your ear
>"I love you. I love you so damn much. I want to be with you, grow old with you, raise your children. But..."
>"But what?"
>"I want you to be like me too. You know?"
>You knew. You'd talked about it before. But you'd waffled, unsure then. It was a big decision, life changing in ways nothing else was or could be.
>But right now, you were sure. You knew. With her, forever, you could overcome anything; any social consequences, any stigma, anything.
>You grab your shirt collar, pull it aside to expose your shoulder.
>"It's going to hurt, pretty bad."
>"Doesn't matter."
>Her teeth are on your skin and she bites. Hard.
>Hard enough to bruise, hard enough to hurt a bit, but not hard enough to break skin.
>She comes away and you look at her confused.
>"Can't now. Has to be under the moon. But I wanted to be sure you were sure."
>She smiles broadly, then wraps a hand up in your hair, makes a fist and pulls your head over to the side so she can aggressively kiss your neck under your jaw.
>"Get out of your pants."
>It isn't a request, or even a statement. It's a command and you both happily and quickly obey.
>She's stripped off her soft flannel shirt, exposing her ample chest and damn near chiseled abs.
>Her pants and underwear are carelessly stripped away and tossed aside. The trimmed tuft of her mound is damp with her arousal.
>You kiss her nipples and she makes those soft sounds you've come to cherish.
>Her hand is on your engorged member, and then it's her mouth.
>She comes back up just so she can use her superior height and strength to push you to the floor on your back.
>Experience tells you this is going to leave bruising. And you don't care.

>She guides herself onto you. The heat of her body envelopes your cock.
>No condom, no precautions.
>Her hands on your shoulders, pinning you down.
>Her eyes lock with yours.
>"Put babies in me."
>You feel like you're flying into oblivion. It's the most intense orgasm you've ever had, and that's saying something given the things she's done to you before.
>Your response drives her over her own edge, and she howls as she rides out her orgasm on top of you.
>For a long while, you both just lay there with your member still inside her. A tangled sweaty mess of heavily breathing bodies and sprawled limbs.


>A week later, and the moon is full.
>The night is chilly, the sky is clear, the air is full of the scent of fallen and rotting leaves.
>A familiar roan wolf is at your side.
>She wasn't kidding. A wolf's bite hurts, a lot.
>But at least it's only a flesh wound.
>And she helps you bandage it up after.

>"So. Mom...."
>"Oh, that's lovely dear. When can your Father and I expect puppies?"
>"So. Dad...."
>"You"re a pervert son. But you're my pervert and I love you."
