How to spend stamina every day

# Technical issues

If you have no subs then you need to unpack them manually. Go where you installed your game (..\BH3_Data\StreamingAssets\Video) and unpack all the zip files in that same folder. Do this every time you notice a scene has no subs or every patch.

If your download speeds are too slow then modify the registry. Open regedit and search/locate Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\miHoYo\Honkai Impact 3 then change the value on GENERAL_DATA_V2_ResourceDownloadType_h2238376574 to 2

If you're still stuck at "Updating settings..." or don't want to modify the windows registry then join the Official Honkai 3rd Discord community and check the pinned messages under the #technical-help channel. One of the messages should have the files you need with instructions on how to use them.

# Materials

**Note:** Don't try to memorize all these and just use it as a guide/glossary. Most 'Currencies/Mats' are obtained from a single place and have a single use with the main Exceptions being Asterite and Mithril that are used everywhere so it's much simpler than you think. Just play the game and learn stuff as you go.

## Asterite

Used in many of the shops for many things, one of the primary currencies. You can get a large chunk of this per week so don't feel bad about spending it but try not to spend it on dumb things.

**How to get Asterite:** You can find it everywhere in game. A lot of the things you do daily/weekly reward you with asterite and events give you asterite too but one of the easiest ways to get a lot of Asterite if you have no Equipment you're planning to upgrade at the moment is to farm Sakura Wills at the Material event stage that happens weekly and sell those.

## Mithril

Used in some shops. This is everywhere, you will get boatloads of Mithril by doing nothing and it's hard to imagine ever running out of this unless you really go out of your way to spend it all.

**How to get Mithril:** You can get a fair bit of Mithril by selling stuff you don't use but make sure you know what you're selling and you absolutely know you will not have any use for it.

## AE Imaginon

It's main use is to get 150 of these guys and convert them into 1 complete Honkai Cube that you can use to upgrade your weapons by one step. 150 of these can also be used to craft one weapon in the Foundry.

**How to get AE Imaginons:** The fastest way is to just target them in the Open world. You get some from missions, one time rewards, events and they even have a expedition but the easiest and fastest way is to just take tasks that have Imaginons in it and you could get around 20~ every time tasks reset if your open world level is maxed.

## Ancient Willpower

Used to buy Valk frags weekly from the War Treasury shop. Remember to buy stuff weekly/monthly from this shop because this is one of the biggest timegates of the game.

**How to get Ancient Willpower:** Mainly obtained from Memorial arena or bought as a chunk monthly from the War Treasury. 

## Ancient Legacy

Same as Ancient willpower but rarer and harder to get. You can use it to exchange for some rarer Valk fragments like Celestial Hymn or Fallen Rosemary at the moment.

**How to get Ancient Legacy:** Also Memorial Arena and War treasury. Some events might give Ancient Legacy too

## Gold Pins

Used for the Battle Arsenal shop. There's some nice things you can buy in there with your gold pins like Starlit Astrologos fragments and it resets weekly.

**How to get Gold pins:** The time works stage is where you will farm these but some events and other things might give some of these too.

## Lucions / Crystallum

The Battle Pass Currency. These are exclusively used for buying stuff from the Battle Pass shop that has rare weapons/stigmas in it. The name might change in the future but it's always going to be whatever currency the battle pass wants at the moment. The currency the Battle Pass takes changes every season (3 patches or so?) to prevent players from hoarding these but you can use your old currency on the Legacy shop at the end of a season.

**How to get them:** You can get two from maxing your Battle pass level, two from the dorm shop and Eight if you buy the Knight Battle Pass for $10

## Honor Chip

**How to get it:** Battle Pass

## Phase Shifter & Sakura Wills

# Gacha list

Equipment gachas guarantee one 4\* or above every 10-rolls unless you're on the JP server. Valkyrie gachas guarantee one 4\* Valk and above every 10.

## Dorm Supply

The Dorm gacha. Pity counter here is separate from all other banners and rolls here are discounted. The only reason to roll here is to pop your first cheap guarantees. Really high odds of whatever came from here to not be good so don't feel bad if you got something widely regarded as bad and consider yourself extremely lucky if you got a huge prize like Celestial Hymn from here.

## Starter Supply

Pity counter here is also separate from all other gachas. Only avaliable for newbies starting in 2021 and avaliable characters in here are Herrscher of Thunder and Azure Empyrea.
There are no duds in this gacha because both are great but HoT is a meta DPS character great for almost everything in the game while Azure Empyrea is a support used to make your elementals stronger so a newbie might find themselves wanting HoT over AE. Don't feel obligated to roll on this gacha but you can try your luck with it to see what you get if you wish.

## Dorm Equipment Supply

Please don't roll on this. Don't waste your crystals.

## Valkyrie Expansion / EXPA SELECT

The normal Valkyrie supply. Pity here carries over to other Expansion/EXPA Select banners.
There is only one S-rank in this banner and the counter at the top right shows how many rolls until you can guarantee them. The difference between regular expansion and EXPA SELECT is that you can choose the rateup valkyrie you want to roll. EXPA select banners are rare and only happen during big releases or big celebrations.

## Equipment Expansion

Sometimes comes when a brand new Valk comes in. FOCA select is better if avaliable but this mode guarantees one piece of the set every 50 rolls to a hard cap of 200 rolls to obtain the full set (Weapon + 3pc stigmata) in the worst case scenario.

## Focused supply

Has a stigmata set on rateup plus a weapon. Unlike the Valkyrie banner, you can get offbannered here by other things so make sure to check the pool of things you can obtain. Comes with a feature called 'Wishing well' where you can trade dupes obtained from this banner into pieces you're missing.

## FOCA Select

The companion to EXPA select. The main difference between Focused supply and FOCA select is that you can pick what Weapon+Stigma set you want to roll for and guarantees the weapon from that set in 60 rolls. FOCA select banners are rare and only happen during big releases or big celebrations so they're definitely worth your crystals if you want a characters weapon/set due to the guarantee. Pity counter does not carry over to other banners.

## SP Supply

Only avaliable for SP valkyries. If it came with an event then you can get SP tickets to roll this gacha in it. Rolls in this gacha are half off and they guarantee one copy of the valk at 25 rolls among other things. Counter here does not carry over.

## Elf Supply

Gacha for ELFs. Valkyries and Equipment are more important so consider these low priority unless you're a spender or really want the ELF in the gacha right now. Pity on this banner carries over to other ELF banners.

## Divine Key supply

Guarantees a Divine key in the number of rolls displayed. Pity counter does not carry over.

## Advanced Supply

Advertises that you can take your S-rank valkyrie featured on the banner to SS-rank in 100 rolls and it does what it says. You can use this banner to get the character if you don't have them already, it's not exclusively to SS them. Just note pity counter and rolls made on this banner do not carry over so it might be better for you to roll Expansion instead.

Start of the Zhuge arc and big Captainverse line

## Odd Drifter

Really long. Like really really long and hard to find a proper video that has the full thing on youtube. Mostly irrelevant to the captainverse plot outside of the very, very end when Zhuge shows up because the rest of the event is completely unrelated meming. Luna kindred shows up and references her event too I guess but Luna Kindred is unrelated to the Captainverse/Zhuge plot line so far.
If you wish to skip to this part then you can find it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJm16a6MmYE&t=5034s but it's not necessary to read or go through.

## Honkai Quest

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLXfAXucLCs
Introduction to DELTA (Rozaliya's Augment suit). Canonically, Delta is a different character from Rozaliya and this event explains why while giving the player her backstory by playing/watching the 'Old Dreams' Chapters.
Happens sometime after Estranged Stars. Different story and different characters but the ending connects it to the zhuge plotline

## Arc: Light bound

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNRKXBSzIWY
Introduction to "Bronie" (Bronya's captainverse version). Canonically a different character from Bronya, never met Seele and never underwent the X-10 experiment so she retains full use of her legs.
Happens after Honkai quest and Sanka Saga.
