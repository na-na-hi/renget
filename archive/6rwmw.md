# Crush... 2!

"-and like, basically, we know Cain's father is white, meaning his mom has to be Japanese, right?"
Max paused for breath, hands on her hips, and surveyed her audience. Minnie's eyelids were fluttering. Edie was on her phone. Hailey was slumped on Faith's bed, breathing slowly and evenly.
"Uh-huh," Faith said.
"So there's really only a handful of people whom Desolator might have killed who'd be related to him." One of her limbs poked at the photos scattered across her board. "I could name 'em all, but it was down to Crimson Ronin and Miracle."
Edie looked up from her phone. "So Cain's mom was a vigilante?"
"Uh, Miracle's name is on record as Hitomi Cain."
There was a brief silence.
"You're not going to blab about this like the Desolator thing, right?" Faith's eyes were very big and very earnest.
"Don't be ridiculous," Hailey said. "Max can't keep a secret. This is *known*." She sat up, stretching languidly, and brushed her hair out of her face.
Max sneered at her. "Shut *up*. Can too. Anyway, the Desolator thing was, like, in the public interest. Or something."
"All it did was give Cain a fanclub. Not that he knows it exists."
"I can't just go up to him and ask if Desolator killed his mom," Faith moaned.
"Sure you can," Edie said with false cheer. "Just keep it in your list of backup conversational topics. Like what H did for Takeda."
"He doesn't even know me."
"I mean," Hailey said, examining her manicure, "even if you crash and burn, at least you can tell yourself that you tried."
Minnie sat up, one finger rising to gesture warningly at Hailey, but Faith's expression only wavered for a moment before settling. "Yeah," she said quietly. "Yeah."
