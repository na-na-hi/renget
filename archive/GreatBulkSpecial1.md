#Team Verdant Special: The Broke-Heart Cowboy
[TOC2]
##20 Years Ago
The town Lombre found himself in was rather quaint. Redkiln wasn't too large or too small; it was a perfect place for him to peddle his wares. On a blanket in front of him lay numerous goods – evolution stones, TMs, a scarf, ribbons, and even a blue and white teapot were on sale. However, there was a secret behind his merchandise that only he knew.

Most of his goods were fraudulent. Half of his TMs were fake. The numerous stones were merely rocks that Lombre had chiselled and painted himself, being sold cheaper than the genuine product in order to undercut competition. Even the teapot was phony, it was in truth painted stoneware passed off as authentic porcelain – a true expert in pottery would've been able to discern this, but they were not the conman's target audience.

The day passed by, numerous Pokemon buying Lombre's products. Each stone sold was a solid 1 thousand Poke lining his pockets, and that wasn't even counting the other things he had on sale! Soon, a peculiar customer floated up to his business – a dimunitive Sinistea, eyeing the teapot that was on sale.

“Hey, buddy!” The Sinistea called out. A crude approximation of a limb floated out from the teacup he called a body, and pointed towards what he desired. “Do you think I could use that thing to evolve? It's getting kinda cramped inside this cup, and I want more real estate, if you know what I mean.”

Lombre put on the most genuine-looking smile he could muster; the mask serving to hide his true intentions. “You certainly can,” he replied in a drowsy-sounding voice. “Everything here besides the TMs are used to evolve. This thing's authentic porcelain,” he lied. “It's only 3,000 Poke. It's quite a steal, if I do say so myself.”

The Sinistea frowned. “Dang it. I only got about 2,500!” He exclaimed. “Are you gonna come back here, mister?”

Lombre shook his head. “No, I'd consider myself a nomad,” he replied. “I came here straight from the Mist Continent; never looked back. I *could* part with the pot for what you've got, though. I can tell you're a fine conniseur of pottery, and you would be the best fit for the little beauty I have in stock.” This was another lie; flattery serving to disarm any potential skepticism about the product he was selliung.

The Sinistea forked over all the Poke he had without hesitation and then struggled to float off, holding his newly acquired teapot all the while. Lombre breathed a sigh of relief once his customer was out of view – Sinistea and Polteageist were known for their appreciation of pottery, and if the one he talked to wasn't so inexperienced, he could've exposed Lombre for the fraud he knew he was.

##17 Years Ago
Leaving their tribes was the hardest thing that Cacturne and Merry had to do, but they both knew it was the only way they could stay together. Their respective tribes, the Saguaro and the Cholla, had despised one another ever since the former arrived to the Thirsty Desert a few hundred years ago. The story was different, depending on who you talked to. The Cholla claimed the Saguaro tried to capture their territory by force the minute they arrived. The Saguaro, on the other hand, claimed they begged the Cholla for land, having escaped a catastrophic event from their homeland, but they refused to share their turf. To them, the conquering of Cholla lands was a necessity for their continued survival.

The two runaways couldn't care less about those grievances, though. They loved one another dearly, and thought nothing of the conflict that no one was left alive to see the genesis of. After travelling to the outer borders of the Thirsty Desert, the two of them found a cavern and set up camp, protected from the heat of the sun outside.

“Merry, what were our options for travellin' again?” Cacturne asked, speaking in the foreign drawl signature to his tribe.

The Maractus next to him pondered to herself for a few moments. “Well, there's two options,” Merry replied. “We can try our luck in the North or the South and Midlands. I personally think the latter would be better; I've heard some pretty disturbing rumors about what's going on in the North.”

“Disturbin'?” Cacturne questioned. “We ain't exactly soft like some of the Southern-folk, but if it's got your spines standin' up, it must be pretty bad.”

“It is,” Merry said, nodding. “There's this warlord up North annexing settlements left and right, and he's got an entire army backing him. As tough as we are, there's no hope of us beating back sheer numbers.”

Cacturne sighed. “I recognize your point,” he muttered. “It's a damn shame, too. I ain't exactly good at math, readin', or anything of the sort, but I know there's a goldmine up there for the takin'. Maybe once we're experienced enough, we can switch to targettin' the North..”

Merry snickered. “A goldmine, you say?” She queried. “I can't tell if you're speaking metaphorically or literally, but your plan sounds good to me!”

Cacturne smiled right back at Merry, his spirits lifted. “Why not both?” He jokingly replied. “Of course, you're more precious than any hunk a' gold I've seen.”

Merry hugged Cacturne tightly. “You always know how to steal my heart,” Merry muttered. “Just remember that we're going to triumph over any obstacles in our way **together**, alright?”

“I wouldn't have it any other way,” Cacturne responded, holding Merry close to him.

##15 Years Ago
Cacturne had been acting strangely, in Merry's eyes. He had been oddly focused on a single caravan delivering luxury goods from the Southern coastal towns to the Midlands, and refused to tell her why. They had been tailing it for a few days, and tonight, he told her, was the night to strike. When the assorted guards, packmons, and others went to rest, the outlaw duo of Team Verdant struck.

Cacturne traded powerful blows with a Primeape, his sturdy body weathering the worst of what the primate could offer. A normal Dark-type would've faltered under such an assault, but Cacturne was born and raised in the most inhospitable part of the Sand Continent. In his own words - “The Thirsty Desert raises nothing but the most stubborn, hardass Pokemon there are.”

A few Needle Arms softened his opponent up, then when Primeape least expected it, Cacturne shot out a Bullet Seed through the holes that constituted his mouth – unlike most iterations of the move, his Bullet Seed had more of a shotgun-like spread, making it a perfect surprise weapon. The force of the move was enough to knock Primeape onto his back, where Cacturne finished him off with yet another Needle Arm, this time to the gut. They'd be in too much pain to cause him any more trouble.

Meanwhile, Merry was dealing with a group of sentries on her own; her fighting style being remarkably different from her partner's. While Cacturne's style was pragmatic and blunt, Merry weaved out of the way of her opponents in an elegant dance, petals following her every move. Her Petal Dance wore down anyone who dared to engage her up close, and even those few who tried to snipe her from afar couldn't hit her due to her agile, unpredictable movements. Thanks to the Persim Band around her head, she was unable to feel the deleterious effects of her move at all, turning her into a walking environmental hazard.

Once all of those around her had succumbed to pain, the Frogadier and Heliolisk that had been shooting at her from afar gave a single look at each other, then fled. Cacturne and Merry re-united, the former looking trimumphant. “Merry, you can grab whatever money these folks were carryin',” Cacturne told her. “I'm gonna take a look at what they got in the carts-”

“No, you won't,” a strange voice boomed, echoing with power. Both members of Team Verdant looked towards the source, and saw a strange Pokemon. It was like a Stantler, but with a grey coat and a beard. Merry recognized what it was – it was a Wyrdeer, a rare evolution of Stantler.

“You won't be laying a single hand on *my* caravan's cargo,” Wyrdeer stated firmly. He scraped a hoof across the desert sands, preparing to charge, while a strange glow eminated around Merry. The desert heat became much hotter, thanks to her using Sunny Day. In an instant, she fired a Solar Beam straight towards Wyrdeer, enveloping him...

Only for him to emerge from the attack unharmed. “Absolutely foolish,” he muttered, charging at Merry with a Psyshield Bash. It hit her with enough force to send her sprawling to the ground, unable to fight any further.

Cacturne scowled at his new opponent. **“GET YOUR DAMN MITTS OFF OF MY MERRY!”** He screamed, lunging forward as Wyrdeer was mid-charge. Thanks to his Dark typing, Wyrdeer's attack did nothing, allowing for Cacturne to cling onto him and slug him with a Sucker Punch. The move impacted against an invisible barrier on his opponent's person as they tried to shake him off, but Cacturne was undeterred.

He Sucker Punched Wyrdeer again and again, shattering the barrier after the fourth try. He continued his assault until his enemy fainted from pain. He felt a stray urge to keep on hitting him, but he knew better than to do that, as the Pokemon was no longer a threat. Death wasn't needed. Besides, if he finished him off, Merry would be upset.

Unlike him, Merry detested murder in any form, even if it was in self-defense. Cacturne didn't understand why. His time growing up in the Thirsty Desert taught him that it was only yourself and your “kin” - friends and loved ones, that mattered. Harm and misfortune inflicted on outsiders didn't matter, as long as it was in defense or benefit of those you cared about. It was bizarre to him, considering she grew up in the same desolate desert that he did.

Cacturne took a few deep breaths, calming himself down. “As I was sayin', go frisk these folks for what Poke they got,” he told Merry. “I'm gonna go search the carts and see if they got what I came here for.” She nodded, and the two split up again. Cacturne looked through each cart, every one of which was filled with all sorts of expensive ribbons, scarves, and jewelry, until he found his prize – two Gold Ribbons, glittering like the finest diamonds. He picked them up and made his way towards Merry, hiding his pilfered goods behind his back.

“Merry, I got somethin' for ya,” he said. “I'm sorry I couldn't tell ya why we had to strike these folk, but I wanted this gift of mine to be a surprise.”

Merry turned towards Cacturne, her face barely able to contain her curiousity. “Oh, we did all this for a gift?” She asked. “What is it?”

Cacturne presented the two Ribbons, handing one over to Merry. “Since we ain't on the right side of the law and can't get a “proper” marriage, I reckoned I'd get us somethin' to commemorate our union, and our three year anniversary since we left home.”

Merry affixed the ribbon to one of her head stalks, clinging onto Cacturne tightly right after. Tears began to pour from her eyes. “Cacturne, you shouldn't have!” She exclaimed. “I was happy with just having you by your side, but you went and did all of this for me... You're the best husband a woman could ask for.”

Cacturne patted Merry on the back, chuckling to himself. “Yeah, and you're the best wife I know. In all honesty, I dunno what I'd do if I ever lost ya.”

“Don't think about such things right now,” Merry replied. “Let's just get whatever loot we can carry to sell off later.” Cacturne nodded, both members of Team Verdant then getting to work and stealing whatever valuables they found.

##12 Years Ago
Team Verdant sat around their home base – a well-concealed cave in the side of an area of the Thirsty Desert known as the Parched Gorge. “Cacturne, there's more to life than just surviving and scraping by on whatever we steal,” Merry remarked. “Every time I've gone into a town to gather information, I've seen the same thing. Pokemon there are actually content and *happy* with their lives. They don't have to worry about lawmen chasing each other across  the land, figuring out where to hide, and most importantly, they don't have to kill. I've tried my hardest to keep death to a minimum where ever we went, but sometimes, it's just unavoidable.” She frowned. “Aren't you getting sick of it? It feels like half the time, I'm dreaming about the Pokemon whose lives I had to end...”

Cacturne didn't look concerned in the slightest about what his wife was talking about. “It's just how the world works, Merry,” he replied. “Ya grew up in the same crapheap I came from; you should know this. It's either them or us; those livin' in “civilized society” are just future victims for those who fought an' struggled to get what they have.” He re-adjusted the Gold Ribbon on his collar, looking contemplative. “The despot runnin' half of the North proves my point. The tribes up in the mountains were feudin' for generations, and he had the strength to unite them all together and turn them into somethin' to be feared. The reason why the Northeners fell so easy is 'cause they were too weakened by the conveniences of city livin'.”

“Yeah, but do you think the people up there are happy?” Merry asked. “You wouldn't be so nonchalant about this if I was one of them, Cacturne. Don't you care about them in the slightest?”

Cacturne sighed. “I can't afford to care about outsiders,” he responded. “They're a waste 'a time and resources. You're the only thing that matters to me now, since I ain't welcome back in my tribe anymore.”

“You wouldn't be saying that if you went on my trips with me,” Merry said. “There's plenty of good Pokemon out there to befriend, although our current profession mostly cuts us off from them. You just sit back and brood while I do all the mingling-”

“They'd spot me in an instant,” Cacturne interrupted. “There ain't exactly many Cacturne like me; with a foreign accent an' a bunch of scars on them. You're the one who can actually blend in, Merry. You coulda been a theatre star, with all 'a your costumes and guises.”

Merry nodded. “You do have a point, but do you really think that robbery is the best path for us?” She questioned. “We could turn ourselves in, do our time, and do literally anything else. There's plenty of Pokemon who don't stick around in settlements and still make a good living. There's adventurers, explorers, rescuers, bounty hunters; all sorts of folk who aren't “soft” like you believe everyone else is.”

“How many years do ya expect them to put us behind bars for?” Cacturne muttered, sounding annoyed. “We robbed a ton 'a caravans, and left more than a few bodies behind us. We'd never see the light of day again!”

“Well, I'd rather pay for my crimes than continue on this road we're on,” Merry confessed. “I'm going to turn myself in. You can join me or not; the choice is up to you.”

Cacturne looked completely shocked at the news, nervousness creeping through his gruff exterior. “Wait, **what?**” He sputtered out. “Merry, you can't do it! The authorities won't go easy on you, and besides, what about our promise? You said we'd overcome every obstacle we faced **together**, didn't ya?”

Merry became still, the weight of her decision weighing heavily upon her shoulders. “Cacturne, I'm sorry,” she tried to apologize. “I really am. I just can't take all this bloodshed and guilt anymore! The whole reason why I tried convincing you to stop was so that you'd come with me, but I guess you've got your mind set on your choice.” Tears began to stream from her eyes, Merry feeling heartbroken over the choice she had to make.

“You're throwin' your life away for somethin' that ain't even worth it,” Cacturne stated. “If you really think this is the smart thing to do, go for it. I won't chain ya here.”

Merry nodded, and began to leave the cave without a word. As she reached the entrance, she looked back and saw a sight no other Pokemon ever bore witness to.

Cacturne, the hardened criminal and thief, was on his knees. He was crying sand – he looked like a broken man. Merry left the cave, regrets and doubts clouding her mind.

->**One Week Later...**<-

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team Stakeout had been on the hunt for weeks. Gumshoos, Arcanine, and Stoutland were known for their impressive tracking ability, but their current hunt was pushing the trio to their limit. The Thirsty Desert was notoriously hostile to all but the hardiest of Pokemon, and if it weren't for Stoutland's experience in traversing the region, the three of them would have perished long ago. The trail Gumshoos picked up led them close to the Thirsty Desert's center, straight into Parched Gorge. It was the hottest part of the region altogether, the hellish heat serving to beat back almost any intrepid explorers.

It repelled all, except the three Pokemon that had came in search of their quarry. Due to Gumshoos' meticulousness and Stoutland's experience, they had packed more than enough provisions to last the entire trip two times over, and now, they were drawing close. “Cacturne's scent is getting stronger,” Gumshoos remarked. “We're drawing close, men. If you have any last minute preparations, now is the time to get them over with. Do you both recall the briefing on Team Verdant I gave before we set out?”

“Yeah,” Arcanine replied. “Cacturne is hardy and stubborn, while... Whatever that Maractus is calling herself this week prefers to rain destruction on her foes using Petal Dance and Solar Beam. I've heard she can pack a real punch.”

“Arc, just call her Opuntia, like the posters do,” Stoutland replied. “It's no use remembering all of her aliases if she changes them out so often.”

“Agreed,” Gumshoos affirmed. “We'll continue our mission in a few minutes. Make sure to keep yourselves hydrated – we need to be in peak condition if we are to prevail.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cacturne's heart still ached. Merry was akin to his other half. Now she was gone, chasing off a foolish dream of a quiet life that she would never attain. He took a sip of an alcoholic Gummi drink, trying to take his mind off of their separation. However, his drinking was interrupted by the unmistakable sound of footsteps. He perked up and headed towards the mouth of his cave, hoping to see Merry again, only to be met with some very strange company.

Three Pokemon stood at the entrance to Cacturne's home – a Gumshoos, flanked by an Arcanine and Stoutland. The one in the center cleared his throat. “Cacturne, you are under arrest for caravan robbery, theft, assault, murder, and numerous other charges,” Gumshoos stated in a calm, professional voice. “Come along peacefully, and you won't be harmed.”

The buzz Cacturne felt from his drink only added to his confusion. “How in the blazes did y'all find me?” Cacturne shouted. “I don't care who or what you are; I ain't gonna lie down and die!”

“How we found you is irrelevant,” Gumshoos replied, entering a firm, defensive stance. “What matters is that we come home with at least *someone* snagged.”

Cacturne moved first, attempting to shoot Pin Missiles into Arcanine's eyes. They dodged, as Stoutland tackled Cacturne from the side. The outlaw stumbled back slightly but quickly regained his bearings, jabbing Stoutland's snout with a Sucker Punch. As he recoiled from pain, Cacturne followed up with a series of Needle Arms, only to hear the sound of flame rushing towards him.

Cacturne lept out of the side, allowing Stoutland to be hit by Arcanine's Flamethrower. “Watch where you aim!” Stoutland barked at his partner, as their target repositioned himself. Cacturne retrieved several Blast Seeds from his bag and began lobbing them at Arcanine mercilessly, aiming to disable him before he could actually hit him.

Only around half of the projectiles landed, but the damage was done – they severely injured their target, whose reaction time was now dulled by wounds and pain. Cacturne took the chance he was given, dashing off towards Arcanine and Sucker Punching him square in the jaw, causing him to fall to the ground. He was too injured to fight anymore, leaving only his comrades to finish their work.

“You're going to pay for harming him,” Gumshoos remarked bluntly. He walked straight towards Cacturne and attacked him with a Super Fang to the arm, wounding it severely. The outlaw cried out in pain, shooting out Pin Missiles in yet another attempt to blind his adversary. However, Gumshoos blocked the projectiles with an arm, wincing as they impacted it. “I did my research before I came here,” Gumshoos chided. “Your cheap tricks aren't going to work with me.”

Cacturne popped an Oran into one of his mouth holes and glared straight at his opponent. “Do ya really think I've got you figured out?” Cacturne asked mockingly. “Actually, *I'm* the one who's got your tricks uncovered. I know who sent you bastards to bag me.”

Stoutland charged, aiming to tear into Cacturne with a Fire Fang. The outlaw simply side-stepped him, then pelted him with a Needle Arm barrage, causing the sturdy Pokemon to flinch. “As I was sayin' before that prick interrupted me,” Cacturne began to explain. “I know it was my wife that gave you my location. She was the only other soul on the Continent who knew of this place.”

Gumshoos stared awkwardly at Cacturne. “I don't know where you got that idea, but that isn't the truth,” he corrected. “We tracked you here oursel-”

Cacturne shot Bullet Seeds into Gumshoos, following the maneuver up with a Sucker Punch to the gut. “**That's a heap 'a lies and you know it!”**” He screamed out, unwilling to take the bounty hunter's word as truth. The outlaw heard the patter of Stoutland's paws on the ground and turned to face him, lunging straight towards him and socking him in the face as he was preparing to use Crunch. Cacturne followed up by repeatedly thrashing his target in the head with Sucker Punches, not stopping until Stoutland quit moving.

“STOUTLAND!” Gumshoos cried out, the professionalism in his voice evaporating away. He rushed towards his partner to check on them, only for Cacturne to throw a Vile Seed at him. The item hit Gumshoos, causing feelings of weakness and nausea to rush through his body. “Why in the name of Arceus did you do that to my partner, you sick freak?”

“Sick?” Cacturne asked. “Y'all are the sick ones, for helpin' Merry double-cross me!” He yelled, pointing straight at Gumshoos. “If anything, you and your folk signed your death certificates by comin' here! Don't come cryin' to me if you ninnies can't finish what you've started!”

Gumshoos charged at Cacturne, enraged due to both his remarks and the demise of Stoutland. The outlaw used this as a chance to jab the bounty hunter in the side, causing him to crumple to the ground. He was unable to fight, yet he still breathed. Then, out of nowhere, a yellow and white light enveloped him.

He had a Reviver Seed on him – insurance, in case the mission went wrong. Gumshoos got back up to his feet, dusting himself off. “You almost had me,” he said. “I won't lose my composure again. I'm not going to let one of my comrades die for nothing, you **vermin**,” he spat, venom seeping into his voice.

Gumshoos waited patiently for Cacturne to get close to him. When he did, he raised his arms again to block Pin Missiles aimed at his eyes, then countered with a Low Sweep, setting the outlaw off-balance. Then, using Take Down, he pinned Cacturne to one of the cavern walls, biting his shoulder with a Super Fang and disabling it for the moment.

Cacturne shoved Gumshoos off of him with his single working arm, then aimed for his gut with a Sucker Punch – his opponent blocked it with an arm, but it still injured him some. “I know how much you love playing dirty,” Gumshoos told Cacturne. “I am going to show you a dirty trick of my own.” He threw a Blinker Seed towards Cacturne, the criminal's vision growing dark.

Cacturne listened carefully to the numerous sounds Gumshoos made – the sound of his feet moving on the cave floor, the sounds he made he moved his body, and so on. A rush of air let him know that Gumshoos was attacking him again. Lombre moved out of the way and fired a Bullet Seed towards the source of the noise, hearing his opponent grunt as the seeds hit him. He was hit.

Cacturne focused on fighting defensively while he was blinded, listening in for any attacks and firing towards where he last heard Gumshoos. He only managed to land his shots a few times, but it was good enough for him. He was still kicking, and his vision was returning – it was time to finish off the last of the intruders that dared to step into his home.

Gumshoos was wounded, yet defiant. He met Cacturne's charge and blocked his wild, one-armed punches when possible, but a few still hit their mark, wearing the hunter down further. “Do you really think this'll be the end, Cacturne?” Gumshoos asked. “I think a key detail has escaped your notice.”

The fugitive narrowed his eyes. “Do ya really think I'm gonna fall for that one?” Cacturne asked. “I wasn't born yesterday!”

Gumshoos smiled wryly. “Arcanine is gone,” he revealed, pointing to where his partner once laid. “I doubt I'll make it out of here alive, but he *knows* where you are now. All it'll take is him spreading the word to the rest of the Sand Continent before other teams start knocking at your door. If we cannot detain you, someone else will.”

Cacturne looked at where his opponent was pointing. Once he realized he wasn't bluffing, he trembled with anger. **”It doesn't matter how many of you they send!”** The outlaw cried out. He charged forward again, striking Gumshoos in the jaw and sending him down for the count. “I'll knock 'em down as they come!” Cacturne yelled as he began to repeatedly punch his opponent's face in, his ferocity only being further fuelled by Arcanine's retreat. If Cacturne weren't so blinded by rage, perhaps Gumshoos and Stoutland would've been spared and allowed to leave, but that was not meant to be. After the former was finished off, Cacturne marched to the back of his cavern, ripping his Gold Ribbon off of his neck.

He stared into it, contemplating to himself. Before, he had only ended lives when he thought it necessary – it was only those who were a threat to him or Merry that met their end at his hands. However, on this night, for the first and last time, he did so out of anger. He frowned as he examined his Ribbon further. With a few quick motions, he tore what was supposed to be a symbol of a life-long bond into pieces.

Team Verdant was dead, and in its place, Cacturne the Unbreakable rose.


##7 Years Ago
Cacturne approached the front of a caravan that had been running from the Midlands to the North, two Bisharp stationed at the front. They had been assigned to the caravan to protect the Shah's precious funds from any brigand daring enough to steal them, but they didn't expect him of all Pokemon to show their head.

“Y'all better give me your Poke, or else you won't like what happens next,” Cacturne said coldly.

“You dare to steal from the Shah's kingdom?” One of the two Bisharp at front asked. “I don't know whether you're confident or foolish. Either way, we will show no merc-”

Cacturne fired Pin Missiles into the eyes of both of the Bisharp, blinding them. He then followed up by punching them with a few Needle Arms, weakening the two considerably. Finally, with a single Sucker Punch to each of their heads, the two went down. He then moved on to the rest, aiming to make quick work of them.

He treated the other sentries with the same lack of mercy or restraint. An Inteleon's shooting arm was broken by the sheer force of one of Cacturne's Needle Arms. A Coalossal was subjected to repeated Bullet Seed firings. Two twin Morgrem were beaten into submission. A Sneasler was blinded and hurt the worst of all, as they had carved a large wound into Cacturne's side.

With all of the guards defeated, Cacturne popped an Oran Berry into one of his mouth holes and secured his loot – 15,000 Poke. Not bad, for a dishonest day's work. However, he still felt hollow inside. He always did, ever since Merry left him, and from his perspective, stabbed him in the back.

Cacturne was already one of the most infamous criminals on the Sand Continent, but he led a lonely life. He hardly talked to anyone, save for when he needed supplies. He travelled alone, relying only on his own knowledge of the Continent's terrain to navigate. He was miserable, but to him, his continued survival was more important to him than his happiness.

##5 Years Ago
Lombre had finally lost the mob that chased him out of town. Breathing a sigh of relief, he checked his supplies. There was plenty of food and water left to provision, and he had enough Poke to last him a while. However, there was a problem that was growing increasingly common.

He was running out of towns to exploit. For fifteen years now, he would travel from settlement to settlement with his fake goods, and at first, things were good. He was always able to sell off all of his merchandise before moving on. Then, word started going around about the quality of his stock.

TMs wouldn't work. Evolutionary items, stones especially, were found to be cheap knockoffs that didn't function at all. Soon, people began growing wise to his schemes. At first, it was only a town or two that would chase him out, but word began to spread over time about his true nature. Nowadays, getting even half of his products sold in a single town was seen as a “lucky break”. Something had to change, but he didn't know what to do. All he knew how to do was scam other Pokemon. He couldn't fight, nor did he know of any genuine talents to his name.

For now, all he could do was struggle.

##1 Year, 3 Months Ago
Lombre had drawn the ire of yet another mob, angered by the false promises he peddled. So many Pokemon eagerly waited to evolve, only for their hopes to be dashed by his lies. As he ran towards the outskirts of the latest town he ventured to, he bumped into a strange, cloaked individual. The only feature of theirs he could see was a large, hat-like protrusion on their head, the stranger's face being unseeable due to looking downwards. “What do ya want?” The odd Pokemon asked of Lombre, tension filling the air.

“I'm sorry about bumping into you, but I need to leg it,” Lombre cooly responded – even the intimidating figure of the unknown figure and the angry Pokemon rapidly approaching the two didn't rattle him. 

“Why's that, huh?” The mysterious individual asked, not even bothering to look at him. Just then, the mob from before surrounded the two, the Copperajah leading the crowd facing towards Lombre. 

“We have you cornered, thief,” the elephantine Pokemon said in a deep voice that seemed to carry across all the land around him. “You will give back the Poke you fleeced my village out of, or there will be consequences.”

The Pokemon that had been talking with Lombre finally looked straight ahead, revealing his face – it was a Cacturne. “It was the fault of you an' yours for being so gullible,” he retorted. He took off his cloak, revealing the numerous old battle wounds that dotted his body – this wasn't a Cacturne, this was **the** Cacturne.

“I don't give a damn about what the scrawny fella did,” he continued. “Go back to your homes – I ain't in the mood to deal with your grievances.”

Many of the villagers caught on to the outlaw's identity in an instant – there was only one of his kind that was taller, broader, and meaner than the rest of his kind. Those that had enough sense or were scared of him fled, only leaving a core group of around thirteen villagers, all standing behind their Elder. “I care not for who you are,” Copperajah replied. “If you dare to obstruct justice, then we will treat you the same as that merchant.”

Cacturne looked towards Lombre and whispered to him. “Fella, do ya know any Water moves?” He asked.

Lombre nodded. “Water Gun,” he whispered back. “It's weak, but I used to shoot at stuff when I was bored.” A realization then dawned upon him, concern beginning to be shown through what was otherwise a masterly crafted facade of indifference. “Are you telling me we're going to have to fight? I don't know how.”

Cacturne sighed, as the villagers began to surround the two in a ring – they clearly didn't want the two to escape. “It don't matter how bad you are,” he responded. “I need you to hit *me* with that Water Gun – it'll heal my injuries in no time.”

Lombre looked skeptical, but it didn't matter. Three Pokemon closed in. A Thwackey struck first, attempting to beat Lombre with the sticks it wielded. He backed out of the way, allowing Cacturne to hit them with a Pin Missile – due to his strength, they were knocked out in an instant.

A Mudsdale slammed into Cacturne, but the outlaw met them, and began hammering them with Needle Arms. Meanwhile, a Hakamo-o drew close to Lombre, and clawed at him. His eyes opened as he felt himself get cut, but he wasted no time. In spite of his lack of power or experience, he pointed a single claw straight towards his enemy and fired a Water Gun towards their head. The impact was enough to cause them to flinch, allowing Lombre to shoot more projectiles into him and defeat him. The conman stared at his own claw in awe, wondering how he was able to defend himself in such a way. He always remembered being picked upon as a child – how had he changed so much?

Meanwhile, Cacturne finished Mudsdale off, multiple injuries from his battle evident on his person. Lombre, having finally returned back to reality, shot a Water Gun straight at his ally, and to his surprise, his wounds mended themselves! There was no time to marvel at him, though – Cacturne and Lombre found themselves fired upon!

A Dartrix, Trumbeak, Drizzile, and Floragato all contributed to a barrage of fire. Lombre instinctively hid behind Cacturne for protection, the more experienced outlaw enduring Razor Leafs, Bullet Seeds, Water Pulses, and Leafages – the Pulses actually served to heal him, allowing him to take far more punishment than normal.

From behind his imprompteau cover, Lombre calmly aimed and fired at Trumbeak. The first shot hit their head and took them out of the fight, and it was a similar story with the other three. Above all else, the salesman could remain calm under pressure, a quality that made him more useful than most would anticipate.

With the firing squad gone, Lombre left his cover while Cacturne gawked at him. “I thought ya said you didn't know how to fight!” He yelled out. “How the heck did your string bean-lookin' ass manage *that*?”

Lombre shrugged. “It's like I said,” he muttered. “I used to shoot at things out of boredom. That, and having nerves of steel helps.”

“Well, whatever you're doin, keep it coming!” Cacturne shouted, as five more Pokemon began their assault. The Skeledirge leading the group bellowed out a Torch Song towards Cacturne, the criminal being washed over by a wave of flame. Lombre shot back with a few Water Guns to the head, incapacitating them. He then shot his injured comrade for good measure, healing them of their injuries.

One of the remaining four, a Pangoro, looked towards his comrades. “Aim for the Lombre, you idiots!” He yelled. “He's healing Cacturne, we'll all get beat by attrition if we don't take him out **now!**”

They all agreed and moved towards Lombre, who looked unperturbed. He shot two Water Guns towards a Pawmot, knocking them out cold, although he still had three foes to contend with.

Cacturne lept towards Pangoro and socked him with a Sucker Punch, but the hardened brawler hardly felt a thing. The two began to scrap as Lombre was left with a Houndstone and a Quaquaval, both eyeing him.

Houndstone was slow and quickly dealt with via Lombre's sniping prowess, but Quaquaval was a different story. His dance-like fighting style and steps confounded him and threw off his aim, all the while he got more and more battered. Just as he was about to faint, however, Cacturne lept in front of him, appearing to be heavily injured.

Quaquaval refrained from attacking Cacturne with his water feathers, knowing the regenerative effect they'd have on him. That didn't matter, however, as Lombre shot his partner right then and there – renewed, Cacturne began to fight the dancer and made oddly quick work of him, in spite of his experience.

“Ugh, that bastard fought almost like Merry,” Cacturne grumbled.

“Who the heck is Merry?” Lombre asked, before being interrupted by Copperajah stomping towards them.

The Elder held no words for them – all he had left was his hatred and contempt. He charged straight towards Cacturne with a Heavy Slam, but he lept up and onto his opponent's back, and began to hit him with the strongest Needle Arms he could muster. Lombre was left alone for a few moments with his opponent staring him down, seemingly uncaring in regards to Cacturne's assault.

Lombre awkwardly dug through his bag and found a Rainy Orb, and smashed it onto the ground. As the item's name implied, it caused rain to begin to pour down, which caused a most unusual reaction with the salesman who summoned it.

In spite of being middle-aged, he could feel himself becoming more agile; more limber. When the Elder charged at him, he simply ran away from his path, his speed being greatly increased. What followed was a game of cat and mouse, the Elder trying in vain to chase Lombre down while he evaded everything being thrown at him.

“Did you really think you could catch me with those slow feet of yours? You'll never catch me!” Lombre taunted. He did so more out of tactical concerns than cockiness – if the Elder's anger didn't abate, he wouldn't realize how useless his current course of action was. He would be free to tire him out as much as he wanted, while Cacturne continued to hammer away at their foe.

The taunt worked. Lombre's enemy began to attack even more recklessly than before, his trunk swinging towards where ever he saw him last. Lombre wasn't merely using his speed to dodge, either – he had kept his eyes on Copperajah's movements the entire time, and now, he knew how he would fight. Armed with this knowledge, he was borderline untouchable to his foe.

Soon enough, the Elder became fatigued. He was so exhausted and wounded from the duo fighting him that he passed out on the spot. Cacturne climbed down and scrutinized Lombre carefully.

“Y'know, you're pretty good in a brawl for someone who looks so wimpy,” he remarked. “Does this happen often?”

Lombre nodded. “I get chased out a lot after everyone finds out I'm selling fake products,” he responded. “This is the first time I've actually fought back, though.”

Cacturne's eyes widened. “That was your *first time?*” He sputtered out in disbelief. “You're more of a natural than most of the suckers I meet on the road! I've actually got an offer for ya, if you wanna hear it.”

Lombre's expression didn't change, in spite of the nervousness he felt inside himself. “What sort of “offer” would that be?” He asked, rolling his eyes. “Is it “give me all the money you have, and you won't get hurt”?”

Cacturne shaked his head, cackling. “No, no!” He corrected. “I want ya to join me. I haven't had an ally fightin' by my side for a long time now, and I know I wouldn't have been able to get out of that fight in one piece without your help. I might be onery, but even I can't face off against nine feet of fury alone!”

Lombre thought to himself, silence filling the air. After a few moments, he figured out his course of action. “It'd be nice to be able to actually fight back for a change,” he replied. “I don't exactly have many places left to go – sticking with you would be a safer bet.”

Cacturne smiled. “That's what I like to hear!” He shouted. “We're gonna stop by another town for supplies, then head back toward home. Once you're there, I'll treat ya to some booze – you earned it, you little miracle worker.”

Thus, Team Verdant was reborn.

##5 Months Ago
The Maractus staring at herself in the mirror had dozens of names and guises over the years - “Merry”, “Opuntia”, “Cochemiea”, and many more she struggled to recall. All those faces of old were discarded, leaving only Sonora. She remembered what happened after she left Cacturne vividly. Why wouldn't she?

After a few weeks of travel, she turned herself in. Magnezone was busy on that day as he usually was, so she came face to face with Deputy Magneton, instead. He was a veteran even then, being one of the few who still recalled the faces of the previous generation's legends, good and bad. She was sent to prison, as she expected, but that old Deputy knew her goal of reformation was genuine. She didn't know whether it was due to his decades of wisdom or meticulous knowledge of her record, but she was grateful he could see through her.

Sonora worked with her fellow inmates and prison staff, and quickly made herself known as a model prisoner. She had a way of cheering others up and bringing the best out of them and she was even released early for good behavior, yet her heart ached still.

She settled down in Redkiln in order to leave her old life behind, yet it still nagged at her. The fate of her ex-husband was the most troubling of all – he had become far more ruthless after he was forced to work on his own. Was it her fault for abandoning him?

She pushed those thoughts out of her mind, adjusting the Gold Ribbon on one of her head stalks, making sure it was affixed just right. She then walked out of her dwelling, and headed towards the home of one of her friends.

She arrived at Espathra's home and knocked the door. It opened, Indeedee giving her a quick wave. “Are you here to talk with my wife again?” He asked. Sonora nodded. “Well, I'm sure she'll enjoy the company,” Indeedee replied. “I'll get some tea started. Go to the dining room, Essy will be with you shortly.”

Sonora walked to where she was told, taking a seat at the dining room table. Espathra and Indeedee soon shown up, the latter sitting down and pouring some tea. “I can see that you're very troubled,” Espathra told Sonora. “It's like a blanket of storm clouds blocking out the sun's rays. Are you thinking about your old life?”

Sonora sighed. “It's not just that,” she replied. “It's Cacturne. You do remember what I told you about him, right?” Espathra nodded. “Well, I can never stop worrying about him,” Sonora continued. “I tried my best to convince him to join me, but he refused to believe there was anything better out there for the both of us. The worst part is that I think it's my fault he became the most infamous bandit on the Sand Continent. When we were still together, we were good at what we did, but there were numerous other teams and gangs just like us. It's like he cast aside his heart when I left. Let me put it this way – how would you feel if Indeedee left you? Would it feel like a betrayal?”

Espathra froze, unsure of how to express her thoughts. Indeedee nudged her, and she began to formulate a response. “It would,” she told Sonora. “It'd be the worst feeling in the world, and I'd imagine it would be even worse for Cacturne. You did tell me he didn't have many friends, even before you two ran away from home. However, it was his choice to stay behind, not yours. This is a very hard truth to accept, but you must hear it:”

She took a deep breath. “Some Pokemon refuse to be helped, whether due to stubbornness or being set in their own ways,” Espathra said. “However, I do have one good piece of news.”

Sonora took a sip of her tea, looking befuddled by her friend's wording. “Good news?” She asked. “I don't get what you mean by that.”

Espathra chuckled. “I know you still love Cacturne, even after all these years. I saw your worry as clear as day, so I read into your future some time ago,” she revealed.

Sonora looked awestruck. “You didn't have to do that!” She cried out. “You didn't need to tire yourself out for my sake!”

“I did it because I wanted to,” Espathra responded. “You and Cacturne will meet again very soon, and you will get your heart's desire. You'll come across the road to his salvation in time, but I'm afraid the details about it are murky. All I can tell you is that you will know it when you see it.”

Sonora frowned, her heart feeling conflicted. “I'm scared of seeing him again,” she muttered. “What if he isn't the man I fell in love with? What if he turned into a monster?”

Espathra drank some of her tea. “When you encounter him, show him what's in your heart. The rest is up to you,” she said cryptically.

##3 Months Ago
Lombre had a bad feeling about this caravan. Even before his boss started to make his way towards it, the guards were on high alert. It was like they *knew* the two of them were there before they even revaled themselves! He had an eye for detail, and what he saw didn't paint a very optimistic picture.

Regardless of his worries, he got into position. He had made sure to warn Cacturne before his attack regardless, so he was as prepared as he was ever going to be. Lombre pointed his index claw out towards the crowd of sentries, locking onto a target and firing. With a single shot, he took a Croagunk out of the battle. He began to line up a second shot, aiming for a Machoke, but seeing Cacturne getting hit by flame changed his plans.

He switched his target to the Growlithe that assaulted his boss. He fired, and they went down, too. He then saw a Meditite attack Cacturne from the back, who then began to float off towards his direction, which filled the former salesman with a deep sense of dread. She knew where he was!

Steadying his breathing, he began to shoot at her, but she weaved out of the way of his projectiles, soon landing right in front of him. “Are you really the coward who's been firing pot shots all this time?” The Meditite asked mockingly. “You're pathetic.”

Lombre was unphased by her insults. He aimed towards her and shot another Water Gun, but she jumped out of the way, firing a bolt of Confusion at him. It hit him, sending him staggering back. He rooted through his bag for a Blast Seed, but before he could retrieve it, he was hit with a Brick Break to the chest. He fell to the ground, unable to fight any more. He was now completely at the guard's mercy, who was now carrying him back towards Cacturne.

Lombre felt useless; like a liability. It made him sick to his stomach.

##Two Months Ago
Ever since his defeat at that Meditite's hands, Lombre had been busy. He replaced his Water Gun with Bubble Beam first thing, and soon learned how to alter its properties – its penetration power, velocity and speed were all under his control. He had also been raiding Cacturne's gummi stores with his permission, knowing that the strange treats could help him grow stronger. He always detested sweets, but he forced himself to stomach them for his continued growth.

Learning how to fight up close was a different matter entirely. He lacked strength and technique, and he was far more fragile than his boss was. He always struggled in their sparring sessions, even after he figured out every trick in Cacturne's book. Yet, he kept on going, driven by spite and self-loathing. It was during one such day of training that he came to an epiphany.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lombre was knocked down by another one of Cacturne's rock-hard punches. He struggled to recover, while his boss looked over him.

“Quit tryin' to fight like me, Lombre,” he said. “Ya aren't built to take punishment.” He helped Lombre up. “Every Pokemon has their weapons,” Cacturne began to elucidate. “Some're strong, some're tough, others are fast. Ya need to think about what tools **you** got, as an individual. What sets you apart from me?”

Lombre thought to himself for a couple of minutes, carefully formulating a reply. “I'm faster. I've got good aim. I also think more than you – I hope you aren't offended by that.”

Cacturne laughed at Lombre's choice of wording. “Boy, I know I ain't a brainiac like you! I'm the one who's always beggin' for your help when I gotta read!”

Lombre smirked at his boss. Cacturne was as thick-skinned in a conversation as he was in a fight. He was almost filterless, and that is why he trusted him more than most – if Cacturne hated him or thought he screwed up, he wouldn't hide it.

The two partners took up a fighting stance, getting ready for another round of sparring. Lombre extended a few thick roots from the palm of his left hand. They were how he used Giga Drain, but in that moment, he had a different idea.

As soon as Cacturne moved forward, Lombre controlled the whip-like roots he had, whacking his boss with great force! Throughout this bout of fighting, he learned that he could keep him at a distance with those natural weapons, and furthermore, he could independently control each one! He used the roots to try to confuse and confound Cacturne, and when he needed healed, he'd simply wrap them around him and use Giga Drain to heal himself.

Lombre still lost, but his performance was a grand improvement from the one-sided curbstomps that he was accustomed to. With a bit more practice, he could finally make up for the singular stain on his record that happened one month prior.

##One Month Ago
A Mabosstiff led a pack of Maschiff, who guarded multiple carts following behind them. While they weren't the strongest protection, they made it up in sheer numbers – over two dozen Maschiff were watching over the caravan in total.

Mabosstiff felt something wrong; a pervasive feeling of tension that went through all the way to his bones. He innately *knew* something was wrong. “Everyone, stop!” He ordered. “I think we're being followed!” Everyone halted their movement and began to look around. One of the Maschiff looked up and saw thick, dark clouds overhead – they were a most unusual sight to see in the desert.

A torrent of rain then began to fall. Mabosstiff heard the wind. He turned around, and saw one of his pack on the ground, bruised and beaten. Raising his hackle, he looked sternly at his pack. “We're under attack! Protect the packmons and cargo at all costs!” Mabosstiff ordered, his men scrambling into position.

Three more Maschiff were knocked out, this time by a sort of water-based attack that was too quick for Mabosstiff to see. After that, a large, green orb, an Energy Ball most likely, crashed into the crowd of Maschiff desperately trying to guard the caravan. It was then that Mabosstiff could finally see the one who had been attacking them, although he was almost too fast to make out.

It was a Lombre wearing a brown poncho with a Mach Ribbon tied around his neck. Roots extended from his hands and swiped at the sentries, thinning their numbers to the point that only Mabosstiff was left. The bandit that had been plaguing the caravan ran up to him, staring him down.

“My partner and I are robbing you,” Lombre said in a tired, calm voice. “Do not resist, or you'll end up like the rest of your group.” The roots retracted back into his hands as he waited for Mabosstiff's response. He bared his teeth and tried his best to scare Lombre, but he didn't even flinch. In the span of less than a second, he pointed a claw at his opponent and fired a Bubble Beam at his head, knocking the elderly guard down.

“I warned you not to interfere,” Lombre scolded. “Why do you people never do as you're tol-” 

He suddenly cut himself off, rubbing his head in pain. He turned around and saw three Maschiff charging towards him, which he disabled with a single Ice Beam each. “My intuition's such a bother,” Lombre grumbled, as Cacturne walked up to him.

“I didn't peg ya for bein' a show-off,” Cacturne mused. “How did ya know you were bein' jumped, though?”
Lombre sighed. “Those Gummis did some weird things to my body,” he replied. “First thing that happened was that my sense of smell became much better. It's probably on-par with a canine's now. Then, I began to be able to sense when I'm being ambushed. I don't know their numbers or strength, but I can feel it nonetheless. The most recent change is hard to explain, boss. It's like I intuitively know my surroundings, even if I'm supposed to be unfamiliar with them in reality.”

Cacturne listened to Lombre's explanation, then shrugged. “Gummis're weird like that. They didn't change me as drastically as you, but I've heard stories,” he said. “You'd probably be better at trackin' folk than me now, between my lessons and that improved nose of yours.”

Lombre chuckled. “Yeah, you're right,” he responded. “Let's go get our loot and leave.”

##Present Day
Cacturne and Lombre lounged around in their cave, each of them gripping a bottle of whiskey in hand. The latter of the two took a swig of his bottle and looked towards his boss. “Cacturne, I want to ask you something,” Lombre stated.

“Go ahead,” Cacturne responded. “You know you ain't gonna get in trouble, no matter what you say.”

“Well, I wanted to know why you never moved our hideout,” Lombre asked. “You said your ex snitched, right? Wouldn't it be a better idea to go somewhere else instead of having bounty hunters at our doorstep?”

Cacturne drank some of his whiskey, smiling. “Well, ya gotta get through the rest of the Thirsty Desert to get here, and this place is even hotter,” he revealed. “You gotta be both stubborn and know what you're doin' while travelling here, or else you'll die of heatstroke or thirst. It's a great filter for nine tenths of the folk after us.”

“Oh, I get it,” Lombre affirmed. “I hope that Merry woman is dead. She wouldn't know gratefulness if it collided with her skull. You've been more than generous with me, even though I've held you back-”

“Lombre!” Cacturne shouted. “You never held me back. If anythin', you've been a great help to me. Do ya know what it's like to have to live on your own, isolated from everyone else?”

Lombre shrugged. “I dunno. I couldn't afford to make any friends as a merchant, but I did talk with customers regularly,” he replied.

“Lemme tell you, bein' stuck on your lonesome is the worst feelin' on Earth,” Cacturne began to explain. “You got nothin' but you and your own thoughts. It's enough to drive most men mad. The only reason I came out of it in-tact is because the Great Thirsty don't raise quitters. Havin' you around has been the most fun I've had since, well...” He frowned. “Since before I got betrayed.”

“Am I really that important to you?” Lombre questioned. “I thought I was silly for seeing you like a brother, but I suppose that wasn't as foolish of a notion as I first conceived.”

“I like the sound of that,” Cacturne muttered. “Brothers. You're the first brother I've actually gotten along with, too.”

Lombre laughed at his boss's words, which was then interrupted by a splitting pain in his head. “My intuition is acting up again,” he warned Cacturne. “It looks like we've got a bounty hunter or two after us.” He hopped up from his seat, roots extending from his left hand. “Get ready for action.”

Cacturne got up as well, stretching his arms and sitting his booze down. “Message received, partner. Let's give them intruders the welcomin' party of a lifetime!”
