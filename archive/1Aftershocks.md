###1-aFtershocks###
!>Totally Non-Canon
1-F becomes 2-F, and 2-F becomes 3-F. The day 'that class' graduated was the first time that Shiketsu had a day of peace and quiet in years. 
But where are they now? 

>Suki HN Sukeban
Rank 52
A hero almost reaching the position of household name, but not quite. Mostly known for the gang scandal, which tanked her popularity despite never being conclusively proven. Some even say she never intended to be a hero at all. Hoping to increase her rep (and perhaps not for the better), though it's been an uphill climb. Ganbatte, Suki-san! We believe in you!

>Runt HN Dust Devil
\#4 Most Wanted Villain (44)
The shame of the F-series, giving rise to the rumor that every Shiketsu class produces a monster. While the limitations of his quirk and circumstances of his crimes keep him out of the top 3, his brutality during the Conquest of Africa make many consider him to be perhaps the largest threat in the Villain world. His motivations are a mystery, even to those that used to know him. Partnered with a strange, cringing dirt-creature, the origins of which are unknown. 

>Rob Williams HN: Velvet Worm
Rank 20
Velvet Worm managed to overcome a large bias against him to become a popular, famous hero. An uncomplicated story of one man overcoming the stigma of nipple-powers through great effort. Caused a renaissance of other "strange fluids projected from body parts" heroes (and villains), much to his immense chagrin. 

>Haiiroshi Kinzoku HN Fullmetal
Rank 3
A true sleeper success. Nobody expected this to happen, but Fullmetal managed to reach the position of #3 hero through a combination of chance and simple efficiency. He may not have the best training, PR team, or quirk, but he was always on the scene when he needed to be. Gradually crept up the leaderboards, step by step, until he reached his current lofty height. The one to prove that a true hero doesn't need to be anything special - they just need to be there, ready to fight, when it counts. 

>Igarashi Ryosuke HN Araken
Rank 19
An ascetic hero that achieved notable success through application of his incredibly versatile quirk. Manages to be spectacularly boring despite this, leading some to consider his numbers are being artificially inflated - but no, he's just weirdly popular with the Buddhist crowd. 

>Tatsuya Yamashita HN Bad Touch
Rank 17
A famous hero with a one-of-a-kind quirk. Permanent quirk removal has made Bad Touch more of a support hero than an active fighter, but his role in healing individuals with life-threatening or mind-debilitating quirks has given him a reputation as a healer - while the power to put an end supervillains nonlethally has ensured the stability of Japan against villainous quirk users and allowed for the abolishment of human rights disasters like Tartarus. His popularity has been marred with accusations of quirkism and ties to fringe religious movements, as well as the disgraced hero Majestic, but his accidentally leaked nudes managed to overcome a lot of that. Works hard to specifically remain above Araken, who has never once noticed. 

>Azuma Hisa HN Beach Day
Rank 89/-
Obscure hero that died horribly and recently, under mysterious circumstances (not shark related, for once). Her death is still being investigated for signs of foul play. 

>Daigo Ulmeyda HN Fly 1 Million
Rank 97
Daigo never managed to cut it as a hero, despite his immense motivation. Despite failing out of the program, he ended up becoming an investigator with close ties to the police, helping to recover missing people and deal with mundane crimes. He utilizes his quirk "off the books" and brings his vast experience with refuse to bear to become an incredible tracker and crime fighter. Moonlights as a garbageman. 

>Kiyoura Shidehara HN Icky Hero: Slimenuts
Rank 86
~~Returned to his home planet.~~

>Higa Umeko HN Slip-N'-Slideasaurus
Rank 86
Underground hero that has focused on investigating corruption from within the system. Almost entirely unknown, but is entirely fine with her placement as it helps her slip under the radar during her investigations, and slide into obtaining classified information. Currently looking into the disappearance of two other heroes from her graduating class, with the aid of Daigo.

>Nayuki Kyoko
Rank 42
A friendly (albeit unreliable) face in the hero world. Utterly free of controversy, but is very rarely active for personal reasons. Still, those few times she performed her hero duties have propelled her to a comfortable position on the boards. Some - the "Kyoko-truthers" - think that she is more engaged in fighting villains the puiblic knows, and have taken to seeking out any traces of her activity. Others think this is total bullshit, and are generally termed "Kyoko-deniers". 

>??? HN Meteoric Hero: Cube
Rank 1
A true juggernaut that has defined the Japanese hero scene for the past few years. An epic narrative of overcoming ultimate odds with a heroic heart; a firm belief in moral good and the power of redemption; a helping hand (angle?) extended to the mutant, the poor, and the disenfranchised - Cube is a hero of the people, for the people. If there is a single flaw in her career, it was her torrid love affair with the #4 villain. Known for her dramatic speeches, where almost nobody knows what she's saying, allowing everybody to agree with it. 

>Riku Washizawa HN The Steel Talon Hero: Skycarver
Retired after teaching 1-F all the way to graduation, swearing off the field of education forever, and aging 20 years in 3. Produced an incredible class, despite systemic roadblocks, but the stress got to him in the end. Many have tried to get him back into the classroom to produce another generation of geniuses, but he remains in the skies for now.
