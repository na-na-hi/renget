##Step 1: Get a Bot and an Emotion pack
We will use my Sarah: -Road Trip Edition- bot for this guide.
*Note: (All of my Sarah bots have the same expression pack and share a folder. So once you download it for one it'll work for all of them)*

---------------------------
##Step 2: Adding the Bot and Expressions to your Silly
Now that you have downloaded the bot and the expression pack. Go to your Silly Tavern and import both.
The way will import is manually into our character folder.
1.) Go to your SillyTavern\public\characters  folder.
2.) Place the Character Card and the Extracted Expressions files there. Pictured below.

3.) Open Silly Tavern then Load up the Sarah bot.
4.) Once the bot is loaded click the triple stacked boxes. Then click the **Character Expressions** dropdown. It should look like Pictured below.

5.) Ensure that the expressions show.
*Expressions are matched to the character based on the name of the folder matching the name of the bot.*
-------------
##Step 3: Opening the Extensions Colab
Now that we have the bot and the expressions are loaded and matched with it we need to run SillyTavern's extensions.
To get a link use the link below OR click on the link pictured below.
link: ![Extension Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SillyTavern/SillyTavern/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb)
If you don't use the link above below is a Guide on where to click inside Silly to get to the same place.

##Step 4: Running Colab and getting the API
Now that we are in the Colab click the play button pictured below and wait a bit (It will be slow the first time. Give it some time grab a coffee, leave me some nice reviews or join the [discord](https://discord.gg/UkfGrsFe9D) lol).
