>You weren't sure you'd be any good at Quidditch, but you thought you'd try out - it would be a good way to make friends, and the wizard you fancy is trying out as well.
>He wins a place in the team, by some miracle you do as well - he as a Seeker, you as a mid-field Chaser
>It's the first practice session for the year, you discover that practice makes you both very sweaty
>During post-practice debrief, you're standing next to each other
>The smell of him gives you a fluttering in your stomach, and a warmth between your thighs
>Catch him stealing glances at you, maybe he likes your smell as well?
>You look forward to every single practice, enjoying the sport, and getting to be with your wizard, the only downside is how horny you are after each session.
>Your team wins the first interhouse match of the year, and everyone is exhilarated from the win.
>You're getting on very well with the wizard you have your eye on, even flirting a little, and the pair of you try to hang back in the pitch meeting room afterwards to talk more. Briefly, the room is empty but for the two of you.
>You make eye contact and both of you stop talking, but it doesn't feel awkward - instead, your heart beats faster and the fluttering is back in your stomach. He walks towards you and starts to lean in.
>You're almost positive he is about to kiss you, but at that exact moment, your Captain comes back to look for a piece of equipment they'd left behind, and the two of you are shooed out by your Captain.
>Things become more intense between the pair of you after this - flirting, long glances in class, sneaking away to talk together, making excuses to touch each other. You've never been this excited about Quidditch before.
>Your team wins the mid-year match as well, which means that your team has made the finals.
>You and your wizard are both sweaty and on a high from the physical exertion of the match, and the sexual tension between you is undeniable.
>You're standing very close to each other, and he whispers in your ear, asking him if you'd like to join him for a shower.
>The pair of you sneak into the women's showers after everyone has left, luckily your Captain does not return this time.
>You eye each other hungrily while you disrobe, he's lightly muscled from the sport, and you've toned up quite a bit in an effort to keep up with the team.
>He starts the shower, and you join him, savouring both the sight of his cock and the warmth of the shower
>H makes the first move.
>He's very gentle with you at first, kissing you softly while you are soaping his chest and arms, moving to his groin. You then start to play with his hard cock, pumping him gently, thumbing the head and enjoying the soft moans you are rewarded with.
>He then does the same thing for you, exploring you and making you gasp as he brushes your sensitive nipples.
>You move his cock between your thighs and slowly rub him against your wet pussy, kissing him harder and nibbling his bottom lip.
>He can't bear any more and after rinsing you off, he turns you around to fuck you from behind
>He pushes you against the wall, grabbing your hip with one hand and his cock with the other, and enters your aching and eager pussy
>He's not rough, but he grips you very tightly and there is an urgency in his movements, he's clearly wanted this for a while. Both of you are turned on by the fact that you could be caught at any moment.
>You are trying to keep it down but you can't help moaning and gasping from the pleasure, and he's groaning in your ear which is exciting you even more. 
>He helps you along by rubbing your clit at the same time as his thrusting, and you find you are rapidly approaching climax
>He learns forward and bites your neck, and the shower is not loud enough to muffle the sound of your very loud orgasm. 
>The feel of your pulsing sweetness against his cock pushes him over the edge and he comes hard and deep inside you. Both of you stand there for a few minutes, trying to catch your breath. Once he's regained his breath, he takes yours again by kissing you very deeply, and he tells you he loves you.

>You are unable to play in the third and final match for the year, as by that point you are three months pregnant.
