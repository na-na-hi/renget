>"Alright Cosmo, activate the photonic inversion ray. Just one last adjustment to the nanite foundations should mean this is complete. Your mana technology has really been a great help with this."
*Cosmo warbles in reply as he activates the machine. The suit floats a foot off of the air, but no other effect is visible.* 
>"This is exciting, isn't it? Oh, of course, for you it must just be another... what day is it again? Tuesday? Must just be another Tuesday." 
>"...What do you mean you don't know what a Tuesday is? Haven't you read the cultural primer I gave you? I suppose you've been getting used to just getting around us relative primitives." 
*Cosmo quavers nervously*
>"Yes, of course, of course. Oh! The suit, Cosmo, it's doing something. What is it doing? Are mana resonators supposed to glow so brightly? And for so long?"
>"Oh my. Cosmo, turn the inversion ray off, quickly now, quickly! I knew I never should have connected the Neuronic regulator nanites to the Cognition suite, they're overloading. If the mana disperses outward... yes, total cell death is likely. Cosmo?"
>"Ah, it's off. Very good."
*DOC STELLAR sighs, shaking his head.* 
>"Well Cosmo, we can mark attempt number seven hundred forty seven as a failure on the Apocalypse project. I can see now why those hacks at management don't want me to work on it. Not that they would know anything about **real** progress. *Nooooooo*, they would rather ignore the **FIRST** in his field. I was First Chair, Cosmo, back in the days of chairs. "
*Cosmo buzzes, whines, croons, and finally ends on a burble.*
>"I hate to admit it, but you're right. I could, of course, figure it out, perhaps some sort of interface disruption weave, but I would need time I simply do not have. Need to have this finished to present to the Board of Directors, hm. Well - what was that? Alright, alright, no need to get Socratic with me. Can't hurt to try and find someone with something like this out there"
>"Ship! Listen to me, Doctor Stellar, your master! Broadcast my voice to the Controllers."
*Static buzzes through the laboratory's speaker system. It is almost structured like speech, as if someone were trying to communicate through only the turning of a knob on a radio.*
>"**Controllers! Listen to my voice! I want you to monitor - who put their filthy extremities on the volume knob for the loudspeakers? I specifically - oh forget it.** As I was saying, monitor all channels for anything - anything at all - related to Exosuits, Mechs, man-portable weapons of mass destruction, top-secret Federation projects, stranded mad scientists, and especially any mana-based systems. That is all. Goodbye."
>"All right, Cosmo. We'll see if your plan works, but meanwhile, I'll be doing some actual science. Unless you wanted to pick our game of Go Fish back up?"
