The grueling blizzard has finally started to pierce through the coat of the lost trainer.
Despite the warning of those in the nearby town, he pushed his way up the mountain in search of this "deity incarnate."
Promises of some rare Pokemon is all that drove him deeper and deeper up the frigid paths.
The power it must possess to live alone up here for so long must be incredible.
As the wind crawls its way inside of the failing fleece, the trainer's muscles tighten more and more. Inevitably, they fail. Making him fall to his knees.
He curses himself for thinking this was a good idea. The distance he climbed has made him almost unreachable to anyone. Even if he had the strength to yell, the wind would only carry it away.

Death is all that awaits, it seems.

Right as he came to terms with his death, a warm feeling covered his back.
A quick turnaround showed the face of a beautiful woman, her smile giving all the warmth he needed.
"My dear, come with me. I shall take you inside and save you from this wretched cold."
He could barely keep from falling when the woman slowly brought him back to his feet.
"My cabin is just up ahead."
The trainer profusely gives thanks to the woman.
"No thanks are necessary. Just close your eyes and rest. I will carry you to safety."
A sigh of relief shakingly pushes its way out of the trainer, as he embraces the woman.

The warmth of the cabin was not too far off now. The trainer could see the lights in the distance.
"Now listen very closely. I need you too..."
The woman stops, and with an almost inhuman swiftness, she turns around. Staring out into the endless blizzard.
"Foul beast! Leave me and this innocent man alone! Can't you see the harm you have caused him!"
A beast-like figure loomed in the distance, barely visible.
"LeAvE us BE."
The women started to sound strange. Her voice began to disappear, being replaced with some intelligible noise.
"Skkkreeeeee!!!"

The human was dropped harshly back into the snow.
The women screamed once more before fading into the blizzard. Never to be seen again.
With what little energy he had left, the human looked up.
A fantastical crystal blue vixen slowly approached from the place of the shrouded beast. Its tails swayed calmly in the wind despite the harsh conditions. It glared harshly at the human, barely hanging on to his life, and felt pity.
Without warning, the creature lifted him off the ground and carried him away. To where is not known, but he could no longer keep himself conscious and his mind slipped away.

The trainer's eyes shot open.
It takes a minute for his eyes to adjust, but it would seem he is in a cave with a small fire barely illuminating the area.
The howling of the storm outside reverberated the inner walls.
Without hesitation, he quickly moved towards the fire. The warmth brought some sharp spike-like stings to the skin, but it didn't matter, the frostbite alone would have been doing more damage.
The flame had his full focus.
So much so he could barely feel the presence coming up behind him. Causing a chill to run down his spine.
With a slow turn, he came face to face with the powerful vixen. Still with the stinging glare from before.
No words are spoken.
After an eternity of staring at this creature, it finally clicked.
This was indeed a Ninetales, but it was not any he had ever seen before.
This Pokemon was a being of Ice.
The trainer looks over at his bag and wishes he could grab his Pokedex, but moving his eyes away from the eyes of the Ninetales seemed to only anger her.

He tries to break the silence but all of the human's words are ignored.
Suddenly, the Ninetales raises one of her front paws and puts it on the cold lap in front of her.
This quick movement startles the trainer. What could the Ninetales be doing?
Did it just drag him here to finish the job?
If only he could get to the Pokeballs in his bag, the human might be able to stand a chance.

Using the lap as leverage, the Ninetales moves in close and licks the human's face.
The confusion caused by this allowed the Pokemon to use her weight and push him down on his back.
The trainer thinks he is about to be eaten and scrambles as much as he can towards his bag, but the Ninetales applies a little more weight so he couldn't move.

The panicked trainer pleads for his life but his words fall on deaf ears.

He braces himself for a bite or a slash of some kind, but it never came. Instead, the Pokemon relaxed and lied down on top of the human.
After the period of disbelief passes, the human looks up at the Ninetales once again.
The stare still lingered, but her flowing tail slowly moved back and forth.
She leaned down and licked the human once again. This time much slower.

Questions started to creep up but the Ninetales put one paw on his lips to silence him.
She then slowly started to slide down his body, until her head was sitting on his lap and the body rested back on the ground.
A small nuzzle made its way out and rubbed up and down his thigh.
The trainer couldn't help but twitch a little from the sudden affection.
Any reasons he could think as to what the Pokemon could be doing have completely left his mind and all that's left is disbelief.
A small smile forms on the Ninetales' muzzle as she bites down on the hiking pants the human was wearing.
A small tug is enough for the human to panic.

His heart rate increases.
His breathing becomes heavier.
This Pokemon is starting something and she is starting it fast.

With one final tug, the pants came down enough for a half-erect cock to pop out.
The Ninetales' face very slowly turned red as her paw played around with the proof that her hard work was paying off.
The trainer at this point was completely blown away.
Here he was having his dick stroked by a Pokemon and this was an experience that never once crossed his mind.
He believes that the snow finally got to him and he is passed out in the blizzard.
The soft paws slowly moved around the tip, making the cock more and more erect.
When the Ninetales felt like the human was hard enough from just her soft touches, the Pokemon slowly leaned in as close as possible and licked up the shaft slowly.

It took everything the trainer had to not audibly gasp.
The tongue was so comfortably warm and soft it made him shiver as the throbbing member was licked slowly.
He couldn't take his eyes off of her as the pace slowly increased.
Her eyes, however, finally pulled away from his when she closed them to focus more on the human dick sitting on her tongue.
Ninetales took a small breath and slowly slipped the dick into her muzzle.
Despite her aggressive attitude to get things rolling she was starting to hesitate.
A few moans escaped from her mouth and it made this wonderfully
pleasurable vibration.

The trainer's hips instinctively pushed forward a bit making his cock slide further in.
Making her eyes open wide again and look back at the human.
The Pokemon's eyes went from the strong glare to something more innocent. She looked like she was nervous.
The human caught this and slowly put his hand on the Nintales' head.

He caressed her before giving a small reassuring smile.

Some confidence returned to her as she lifted her head to only bring it back down. The whole erection slipped as deep as it could go.
Arching the trainer's back and finally making a pleasurable moan come from him.
This sound was music to her ears as she sped up and moved her tongue around the tip every time she pulled herself back up.
Causing the deepest pleasure.
The pleasurable repetition gets faster and faster until the fox pulls herself off the dick and rubs her paws up and down the shaft again. The trainer cries out while releasing his load all over the Nintetales' face.
She sits for a minute before licking some of cum off of her face.

After being given enough time to recover the Ninetales jumped back on top of the human.
He pulls her in close and starts nibbling the side of her neck.
This is a bit of a surprise, but a very welcomed one. She sinks into the little bites, relaxing more and more on the Trainers chest.

Without hesitation, he starts tracing her figure with his hands. Eventually reaching down low enough to fully grasp her haunches. Getting a nice handful of those beautiful blue hips.
Ninetales tightens up her body a little bit before sinking into the feeling of this human sizing up her body. She just rests her head on his shoulders while he plays with her.

The trainer slides one hand down from her hips and in between her hind legs.

There is an immediate warmth permeating from her cookie, and with a little sweep across it with a finger it was easy to tell she was already nice and slick.
This makes the Ninetales shiver and hide her face into the Human's shoulder.
He couldn't help but get a little devilish smile on his face as his finger circled partly inside her vixen vulva. Feeling every twitch and hearing all the little noises she made while doing so. The little yips and squeaks was soft and lightly echoed off the cave walls.

His finger continued circling until he felt Ninetales lightly push down onto it. He squeezed her other hip with his free hand while plunging his finger inside of her.

Ninetales' body barely could keep itself from completely crumbling under the wave of pleasure that effortlessly pushed itself throughout her body.
Like under some kind of spell, she quickly started moving her hips in rhythm with the piston-like finger action. Biting down on the trainer's jacket to try and stifle as many of her pleasurable moans as possible.

The Ninetales couldn't take it anymore and used the jacket as a way to pull them both back, making an audible pop as the fingers leave her. The hind legs spread as wide as possible.
The ethereal like tails slowly wormed their way around the human. A gentle feeling crawls around the arms first with the hips soon after. They lightly pull, inviting him to take her for everything she's worth.
Such a wonderful invitation.

The tip of his dick started poking up against Nintetales' dark blue cookie.
She can feel it pressed up against her, so she teases a little by grinding up against the trainer's cock.
The trainer is no longer in the mood for foreplay and thrust himself inside of her. Quickly jabbing against her cervix. A good few innocent yelps escape her as the sudden penetration makes itself known.
Even after all this foreplay it's a very tight fit and with every minute movement he could feel her clamping down. Making it difficult to move.

Gritting his teeth, the trainer tries to pull back slowly. The pressure is almost too much to bear. This sends the Ninetales' body into varying levels of shock and she tightens around the human cock even more.
He stops and reassures her, while lightly messaging her abdomen in an attempt to calm her down.
The Pokemon very slowly takes in the nice gesture and her heavy breathing evens out. Those deep blue eyes open again, giving a more calm and innocent look.

Now with a lot less grip on his cock, the human pulls back. Leaving just the tip inside.
He places his right hand over her stomach and grabs a hold of one of the raised legs. Taking in the sight laying in front of him, he couldn't help but gently kiss the paw that sat near his face. The tiny paw brushed back in response.

After a mental countdown, he slowly pushed himself back in. The tightness slowly returned, but with much less intensity. Ninetales' eyes stayed open and gave a reassuring look.
The hand on the stomach could faintly feel the difference in pressure as she was pushed back open.

Finally, he once again reached the back wall of her canal. He waits a few more seconds before pulling back. The pleasure in both the human and the Pokemon swirled inside making them both squirm in anticipation.
With a thrust, he starts the passionate lovemaking between the two. Very quickly picking up in pace. Every slap against her body made the tails wrap tighter and tighter around the human. Showing the intensity.
They start breathing heavier and heavier as the amount of time between each thrust shortens. The sounds of their lovemaking bounced on the icy walls, turning the dark cave into an auditorium of pleasure.

The intensity grows until the human could no longer keep himself together. With an almost animal-like ferocity, he pounds harder and harder. Until he feels himself about to blow.
He wants to pull out and shower the ice beauty with his load, but she orgasms. Tightening her pussy back as he reaches the cervix. The tails grip even harder and force the human as close as possible.
The trainer barely could himself from gasping when he started filling up the Ninetales. Every small twitch of her insides was her yearning for more and milked him dry.
The grip was too strong to fight, so he just lets himself get pulled deeper and deeper. Almost passing out from the intensity.

The position is held for several minutes while the Ninetales lay in aftershock. Jumping her hips a little.
The grip of her pussy and tails finally loosened and the human dropped back. His muscles completely gave up on holding together.
The Ninetales shaking flips back over onto her stomach and slides next to the man. They hold each other while falling into a deep sleep.

There was no way of knowing for sure how long he was out, but the man did eventually awake from his slumber. The fire was left in shambles as the remaining embers died out in from of his eyes. Despite the fire being gone, he could still see. Light washed over the cave from an opening not too far.
The trainer looked around, but the Ninetales was gone. It left this feeling only loneliness that he had never felt before. He wasn't sure what to make of this new feeling and just decided to gather his belongings and make sure the fire was completely put out.

The sun was brightly displayed in the cloudless sky making his eyes sting a bit. He wasn't sure where he was, but the path couldn't have been too far off. With a sigh of relief from surviving the harsh blizzard, he started to make his trek back to the mountain base. Though, he couldn't shake that Ninetales from his mind no matter how hard he tried.

He talked to himself, trying to piece together everything that happened. He eventually decided that it must have been a hallucination of sorts and he just made his way into the cave before dying, but that answer was immediately brushed aside when he noticed the bite marks on his jacket. It was impossible keep himself from reaching over and touching the open holes in the coat. Brushing up and down against them in disbelief. Until he pulled out some thin blue fur from one of the damaged spots.

The man slowly turned around and stared up towards the mountain's peak.
