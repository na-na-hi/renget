Hotel room
>life is… unpredictable 
>very unpredictable 
>the current curveball thrown at you was the hedgehog sitting on the hotel bed
>now when you think hedgehog you think tiny woodland creature
>they don't talk
>they don't wear a towel around them like a chick
>they aren't blue
>they aren't asking you about what there is to do around here for fun
>you'd been on the run for a while 
>after he popped out onto earth you'd had nothing but trouble
>and here he was drawing rings with his finger on the bed sheet
>"c'mon you can't think of anything fun? I'm dying of boredom here."
>you felt like being a smart ass
>he'd been damn near uncontrollable 
>like trying to rein in someone with ADHD
>just constantly running circles around you
>his enthusiasm would be cute if it wasn't a hazard
>he spread his legs in front of you and you remembered his lack of shame 
>he caught your quick glance and trying to look away
>it felt dirtier considering he mostly was naked most of the time
>you remembered when you had to enforce at least running shorts when he popped over here
>he had picked a pair for girls 
>but somehow the towel made him lewder at the moment
>"I think you know something fun"
>you did know
>you were ignoring it
>trying
>did he have to be so damn smug
>he had a grin on his face as he made a show of crossing his legs
>when you tried to get up and avoid the situation your face was draped in said towel and your pants had vanished, judging by the breeze 
>oh what the fuck
>you threw the towel aside to see Sonic leaning against the bathroom door frame
>your underpants were twirled on his finger and he had the biggest goddamn grin on his face
>sure enough, pants thrown on the ceiling fan
>and your dick was out
>now, while you stood about a head or two taller and you could theoretically take him in a fight, he was not exactly easy
>super speed was an annoyance when it wasn't saving you
>because it only aided in the amount of mischief he could pull off
>"slowpoke"
>you figured there was no chance to catch him like this
>what if you just didn't play along?
>you didn't need your briefs that bad
>when you went to pull the pants down from the fan, your shirt was thrown out the window
>"don't you feel awkward? showing up in the same birthday suit?"
>he was on your bed now, laying on his side with his hand propping up his head
>his running gave his sleek legs but very defined hips 
>and he made sure to show them off
>it was then he blew you a kiss and winked
>you were being mocked by a scrawny blue hedgehog with his hog out

>you knew he was trying to get a rise out of you
>some weird Bugs Bunny routine
>he couldn't be serious
>you asked how he even knew about that stuff
>"traveled all over and you don't think I'd know what sex was?"
>he saw your dick twitch at that 
>it was weird to think of this guy like that
>he wasn't even from your dimension
>wasn't even human
>plus the whole guy thing bit that was the least of it
>he had a realization flash across his face
>he snapped his fingers and vanished
>oh no
>from your brief experience you knew leaving him out of your sight was a bad idea
>he came back through the door in a gust of wind
>he threw something at you and you caught it out of muscle memory
>a bottle of lube
>christ he really did know
>"you need a written invitation? c'mon, slowpoke"
>he casually hopped onto the bed and thrust his ass up in the air
>he wiggled it towards you as a taunt
>his white gloved hand smacked his ass
>this was everything slamming at you like a freight train
>"we don't gotta be alone on a Friday night"
>you took it in
>his blue fur covered thick thighs and very defined glutes
>he had amazing legs and knew it
>a pink hole in the center of his ass winked at you
>this was really happening
>he had fur over his nuts but a pink leaky cock peeked from his sheath
>he looked up over his shoulder
>clearly he was impatient 
>his foot slid up and he gently ran over your cock you left exposed 
>you'd realized you'd been hard this whole time
>"I bet it'll be fun. if you're up for it"
>again with the taunts 
>he was trying to get under your skin
>you saw the flick of his tiny pointed tail
>his foot brushed over your dick
>"you don't feel unsure back there."
>you really only had one idea running through your mind
>it looked inviting
>he wanted it
>could it be so bad
>it was weighing on your mind
>his foot moving over your dick made you buck and that got a laugh out of him
>he spread on cheek with his hand
>"you can bet this feels even better"
>tempting 
>he was breaking through your willpower
>it was like a gate getting battered down
>he was definitely winning
>dammit
>he was a total brat but he knew 
>you opened the bottle and he actually fist pumped 
>he'd gotten victory but you were going to make sure he'd pay dearly
>after all, if he was going to be a pain in the ass you could play that game too

>you didn't spare any time 
>after all that teasing he'd gotten you worked up
>so he was in for a shock when you lined up and shoved it in without pause
>"fuck," he groaned out into the mattress
>well he wanted it he got it
>his blue fur felt smooth to the touch
>and his ass practically swallowed your length despite his groans and curses
>well he wanted you to fuck him
>the cocky attitude had melted away almost instantly 
>it was definitely nowhere to be seen when your hips made contact with his toned ass
>his own cock dribbled a constant stream of precum onto the sheets
>should you have worn a condom?
>the things you only think of when too late
>you were trying to pull out when his legs looped back around yours
>"don't… don't you dare"
>the attitude in his voice was slightly marred by the fact he practically whimpered that
>well maybe it was safe to fuck the interdimensional blue talking furry
>he did milk at you pretty good, even if he didn't mean to
>with his ass up in the air you could thrust down pretty hard 
>it didn't take long for him to grab a pillow and scream into it
>his orgasm making a mess on the bed spread
>you replied he really was the fastest thing you'd ever seen
>the pillow got tossed over his shoulder into your face
>the glare was worth it
>especially when you started right back up into pounding him and his hands clawed at the blankets
>he took to getting fucked easily
>you had to ask
>if he had experience like this
>in between the whimpers and moans he said he just fingered himself sometimes
>so you were slamming it into virgin territory?
>"yes, yes, oh fuck yes"
>a second oragasm made his body quiver
>but you weren't finished
>you picked him up and put him in a full nelson 
>the quills on his head scratched over your skin
>but you paid it no mind
>you growled into his ear as you thrust up into him
>if this was the time waster he imagined it would be
>he arched and shot a couple ropes over the bed
>his arms and legs were locked in and he was trapped
>man, if you knew it was this easy to catch him you'd have done this a while ago
>he didn't even touch his dick and he was cumming a fourth time
>even if he was a quick shot he seemed to have limitless stamina
>he recovered quickly and thrust back into you
>"c'mon," he said between gasps, "I know you can go faster"
>oh that's how he wanted it?
>you turned your back towards the bed and fell onto it
>you disregarded the mess on your back and released the full nelson 
>he was confused and almost protested when you grabbed his narrow waist and started impaling him on your manhood with all the energy and speed you could muster
>while the hedgehog had looked alien to you when you first saw him, you had a newfound appreciation for him
>his hole gripping onto your dick might be clouding your judgement 
>that blue coat was like velvet to the touch
>the peach color fur of his stomach marking complimented it
>his face had a soft roundness to it
>not that you could see it now for the quills that made up his head of "hair"
>gave him sort of punk look
>no way he could match the attitude that style exuded though
>not while he was moaning like a girl on your lap
>"you… you can… go harder, right?"
>oh he was a brat
>every thrust down your shaft was met by your hips halfway
>you weren't giving him time to pause now
>his arms scrambled as his hands tried to find anything to grab
>another orgasm
>this time you could only tell from his noises and his hole
>you'd managed to wring him out like a sponge
>that didn't mean you were stopping though
>his prostate was getting jackhammered so much he was seeing stars
>you felt it was time for another position change 
>he didn't have time to react before you mating pressed him into the bed
>this time you were face to face 
>his hands went for your shoulders and his legs locked around your back
>"don't pull out, you hea-"
>he was cut off as you redoubled your efforts
>the sentence turned into a drawn out whorish noise
>you were so close and you bet he had one or two more in him
>without hesitation you crushed your lips to his mouth
>his tongue explored your mouth eagerly 
>when you were right at the edge you hammered in one final thrust that had him writhe in your grip
>his body convulsed as you poured that load deep into him
>so that was it
>that was how you were going to get interdimensional clap or whatever
>well hopefully that got that out of his system 
>he looked you square in the eyes
>his green eyes immediately filled with that gleam of mischief that his smile couldn't muster
>through ragged breath he finally spoke
>"were you that eager to shut me up at the end with that kiss?"
>he rolled his hips against yours, like he was trying get that very last drop out of you 
>"told you that was going to be fun. going to be running funny tomorrow though."
>this had to be a one time thing
>you had to put your foot down
>you tried to break it gently
>he was practically a stranger
>and you just fucked him into near coma
>it wasn't the smartest thing to just do the closest thing to a Craigslist hookup with a furry
>there was a trace of disappointment on his face
>"was it not good?"
>oh dammit 
>was he playing the puppy dog eyes?
>all the while occasionally rolling his hips against yours
>it wasn't bad
>you couldn't stand the puppy dog eyes
>you just worried
>"about? I'm pretty sure you can't get me pregnant"
>not that
>it was just the whole situation was alien
>"we had fun. I mean if you want me to stay put I can't really hop off that cock"
>grin and a shrug
>he used his locked legs to drive your hardening cock deep 
>he heaved his chest into yours as he arched his back 
>you were trying your hardest not to concentrate on… everything
>"I snagged that cowboy hat from the western bar and you're not even going to let me try that 'cowgirl position'"
>very difficult 
>"if I do 'reverse cowgirl' does that mean I have to make beeping noises during?"
>you kissed him
