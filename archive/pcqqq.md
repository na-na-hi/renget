Hotel room
>life isâ€¦ unpredictable 
>very unpredictable 
>the current curveball thrown at you was the hedgehog sitting on the hotel bed
>now when you think hedgehog you think tiny woodland creature
>they don't talk
>they don't wear a towel around them like a chick
>they aren't blue
>they aren't asking you about what there is to do around here for fun
>you'd been on the run for a while 
>after he popped out onto earth you'd had nothing but trouble
>and here he was drawing rings with his finger on the bed sheet
>"c'mon you can't think of anything fun? I'm dying of boredom here."
>you felt like being a smart ass
>he'd been damn near uncontrollable 
>like trying to rein in someone with ADHD
>just constantly running circles around you
>his enthusiasm would be cute if it wasn't a hazard
>he spread his legs in front of you and you remembered his lack of shame 
>he caught your quick glance and trying to look away
>it felt dirtier considering he mostly was naked most of the time
>you remembered when you had to enforce at least running shorts when he popped over here
>he had picked a pair for girls 
>but somehow the towel made him lewder at the moment
>"I think you know something fun"
>you did know
>you were ignoring it
>trying
>did he have to be so damn smug
>he had a grin on his face as he made a show of crossing his legs
>when you tried to get up and avoid the situation your face was draped in said towel and your pants had vanished, judging by the breeze 
>oh what the fuck
>you threw the towel aside to see Sonic leaning against the bathroom door frame
>your underpants were twirled on his finger and he had the biggest goddamn grin on his face
>sure enough, pants thrown on the ceiling fan
>and your dick was out
>now, while you stood about a head or two taller and you could theoretically take him in a fight, he was not exactly easy
>super speed was an annoyance when it wasn't saving you
>because it only aided in the amount of mischief he could pull off
>"slowpoke"
>you figured there was no chance to catch him like this
>what if you just didn't play along?
>you didn't need your briefs that bad
>when you went to pull the pants down from the fan, your shirt was thrown out the window
>"don't you feel awkward? showing up in the same birthday suit?"
>he was on your bed now, laying on his side with his hand propping up his head
>his running gave his sleek legs but very defined hips 
>and he made sure to show them off
>it was then he blew you a kiss and winked
>you were being mocked by a scrawny blue hedgehog with his hog out
