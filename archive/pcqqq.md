Hotel room
>life isâ€¦ unpredictable 
>very unpredictable 
>the current curveball thrown at you was the hedgehog sitting on the hotel bed
>now when you think hedgehog you think tiny woodland creature
>they don't talk
>they don't wear a towel around them like a chick
>they aren't blue
>they aren't asking you about what there is to do around here for fun
>you'd been on the run for a while 
>after he popped out onto earth you'd had nothing but trouble
>and here he was drawing rings with his finger on the bed sheet
>"c'mon you can't think of anything fun? I'm dying of boredom here."
>you felt like being a smart ass
>he'd been damn near uncontrollable 
>like trying to rein in someone with ADHD
>just constantly running circles around you
>his enthusiasm would be cute if it wasn't a hazard
>he spread his legs in front of you and you remembered his lack of shame 
>he caught your quick glance and trying to look away
>it felt dirtier considering he mostly was naked most of the time
>you remembered when you had to enforce at least running shorts when he popped over here
>he had picked a pair for girls 
>but somehow the towel made him lewder at the moment
>"I think you know something fun"
>you did know
>you were ignoring it
>trying
>did he have to be so damn smug
>he had a grin on his face as he made a show of crossing his legs
>when you tried to get up and avoid the situation your face was draped in said towel and your pants had vanished, judging by the breeze 
>oh what the fuck
>you threw the towel aside to see Sonic leaning against the bathroom door frame
>your underpants were twirled on his finger and he had the biggest goddamn grin on his face
>sure enough, pants thrown on the ceiling fan
>and your dick was out
>now, while you stood about a head or two taller and you could theoretically take him in a fight, he was not exactly easy
>super speed was an annoyance when it wasn't saving you
>because it only aided in the amount of mischief he could pull off
>"slowpoke"
>you figured there was no chance to catch him like this
>what if you just didn't play along?
>you didn't need your briefs that bad
>when you went to pull the pants down from the fan, your shirt was thrown out the window
>"don't you feel awkward? showing up in the same birthday suit?"
>he was on your bed now, laying on his side with his hand propping up his head
>his running gave his sleek legs but very defined hips 
>and he made sure to show them off
>it was then he blew you a kiss and winked
>you were being mocked by a scrawny blue hedgehog with his hog out

>you knew he was trying to get a rise out of you
>some weird Bugs Bunny routine
>he couldn't be serious
>you asked how he even knew about that stuff
>"traveled all over and you don't think I'd know what sex was?"
>he saw your dick twitch at that 
>it was weird to think of this guy like that
>he wasn't even from your dimension
>wasn't even human
>plus the whole guy thing bit that was the least of it
>he had a realization flash across his face
>he snapped his fingers and vanished
>oh no
>from your brief experience you knew leaving him out of your sight was a bad idea
>he came back through the door in a gust of wind
>he threw something at you and you caught it out of muscle memory
>a bottle of lube
>christ he really did know
>"you need a written invitation? c'mon, slowpoke"
>he casually hopped onto the bed and thrust his ass up in the air
>he wiggled it towards you as a taunt
>his white gloved hand smacked his ass
>this was everything slamming at you like a freight train
>"we don't gotta be alone on a Friday night"
>you took it in
>his blue fur covered thick thighs and very defined glutes
>he had amazing legs and knew it
>a pink hole in the center of his ass winked at you
>this was really happening
>he had fur over his nuts but a pink leaky cock peeked from his sheath
>he looked up over his shoulder
>clearly he was impatient 
>his foot slid up and he gently ran over your cock you left exposed 
>you'd realized you'd been hard this whole time
>"I bet it'll be fun. if you're up for it"
>again with the taunts 
>he was trying to get under your skin
>you saw the flick of his tiny pointed tail
>his foot brushed over your dick
>"you don't feel unsure back there."
>you really only had one idea running through your mind
>it looked inviting
>he wanted it
>could it be so bad
>it was weighing on your mind
>his foot moving over your dick made you buck and that got a laugh out of him
>he spread on cheek with his hand
>"you can bet this feels even better"
>tempting 
>he was breaking through your willpower
>it was like a gate getting battered down
>he was definitely winning
>dammit
>he was a total brat but he knew 
>you opened the bottle and he actually fist pumped 
>he'd gotten victory but you were going to make sure he'd pay dearly
>after all, if he was going to be a pain in the ass you could play that game too
