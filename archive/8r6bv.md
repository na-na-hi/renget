###Foundry Gear (game v6.6)
[TOC4]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
####Universal Mirage Gear
Note that universal mirage takes a long-ass time to collect the resources
for even one piece of gear - know what you want, do all your weekly entries,
and salvage spare drops for extra fuel as needed.  Weapons are ordered
by type, stigmata are ordered alphabetically.

**NOTE:** All bounty weapons and stigmata can be salvaged for their respective
	      resonators.  Get grinding.


#####Bounty Weapons

**Pistols**
*Fenghuang Pinions*
New divine key that uses the bounty spirit system - was available from
the 4.6 Shenzhou event - looks like a more readily available Kikaku.  First G2
weapon, so ex-fucking-spensive to forge.  Works (poorly) as a sub-in for
Eden's pistols.

*Hyper Railguns*
Most useful as a precursor to the Positron Blasters
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Katana**
*3rd Relic*
Good physical burst katana, works best with Striker Fulminata and
Miko Sakura - neither are all that meta endgame.

*Florid Sakura*
Motif for FS.  Get it if you use her.

*Ice Epiphyllum*
Mandatory for Meme.  No more bitching about not having anything to
kill Houdou.

*MagStorm*
Motif for LE.

*Pledge of Rain*
Was a filler for Raikiri in Judah team - since HotF/HoT replaced
Judah as DPS, skip.

*Void Blade*
Shiny.  Also good for DPS Danzai.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Cannons**
*Briareus PRI* (Missile)
Most useful as a precursor to Briareus EX.  Can be used on VC
for missile stacking.  Active has time-stop/impair field.

*Quantum Destroyer Type II* (Laser)
Was useful for the suction on YA.  DK's succ on ultimate is
better, also, lasers suck, so skip.

*Star Destroyer 19C* (Missile)
Crap.  Skip.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Greatswords**
*Balmung*
Tolerable filler for MC/FT when you don't have Sleeping Beauty.
Don't expect miracles, though.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Crosses**
*Pledge of Sakura*
Motif for SR.  Okayish, good for feeding her SP, but the magical
stick is better.  Unlocks Binding shrine when converted to Divine
Key (+lightning dmg %.)  Has a support PRI upgrade.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Lances**
*Abyss*
G2 BKE/PE Lance, very incremental upgrade over Endothermic VF, given that
PRI essentially complete the ripped out sections of an S-rank's kit, you'd be far
better served getting one of them compared to wasting your mats.  It's a divine 
key, though, so knock yourself out if you really want that +10 atk.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#####PRI Arms
This section is more of a forewarning to newer players as to what you can work towards pre lv81.
For the most part, if you don't have a PRI on your DPS, you don't have shit (due to stat creep.)

!!!note Crafting Requirements
	To craft a PRI arm, you first need to have owned its precursor form - e.g., Hyper Railguns
	is needed to craft the Positron Blasters.  Check your ingame encyclopedia - if the base form
	is greyed out, you ain't crafting it.  

	Once you unlock the recipe, any maxed 5* weapon that meets the following can be	used:
	1. The weapon can be salvaged for resonators (all bounty/gacha weapons)
	2. The weapon is of the same type (i.e. Pistols for a pistol PRI Arm)
	3. If the PRI-to-be-crafted is a Divine Key, the donor weapon is the maxed precursor

######Pistols
*Domain of Genesis*
Precursor: *Key of Anonymity* / Gacha
Motif for HoFi, plays like shit without it, just like all the recent motifs.

*Domain of Incandescence*
Precursor: *Key of Radiance* / Gacha
New pistol for HoF.  Like all new-release S-rank PRIs, mandatory due to stat creep.

*Domain of the Void*
Precursor: *Keys of the Void* / Gacha
Disappointingly nerfed, but still p. good.  Gives HoV much needed shield break.
Get it if you use her regularly/good on VD due to being a massive +phys/crit 
dmg stat stick.

*Echo of Paradise: Time Ruins*
Precursor: *Echo of Paradise* / Gacha
Eden's new PRI, only really necessary for more sub-dps in Aponia teams.  Shoots
its wad fast, which makes it imperceptibly worse for Turganev Eden, but the increased
sub-DPS should make up for it.

*Positron Blasters*
Precursor: *Hyper Railguns* / Bounty
Was great for KMB time fracture qte rotation comps, but there are better choices
these days.  DPS KMB is also pretty dead.

*Tranquil Rhapsody*
Precursor: *Tranquil Arias* / Gacha
Gutted in beta.  Only good on 6S due to the reduced TDM.  Succ on active is
decently strong, though.  Safe skip if you don't have enough mats for other,
more pressing PRIs.

######Katana
*Domain of Sanction*
Precursor: *Key of Castigation* / Gacha
Was mandatory for HoT - replaced by *7TR*.  If you already have *Domain*, can
be moved off to DJ (but with Aponia, DJ is already p. dead)

*Domain of Unity*
Precursor: *Key of Limpidity* / Gacha
Motif for HoO, should also work on Kasumi.  Weapon is tied directly into HoO's
combo, so it's a definite must - just pray you get it before you 3/3 her stigs and
waste the pick box.

*Frozen Naraka*
Precursor: *Ice Epiphyllum* / Bounty
Mandatory for GM if you want her to be anything more than a meme.

*MagTyphoon*
Precursor: *MagStorm* / Bounty
Mandatory for support LE in the endgame - instant paralysis/conductive debuff/lightning
damage taken on skill activation.  Triple activation skill for quick paralyze trauma.

*Ruinous Sakura*
Precursor: *Demonblade - Florid Sakura* / Bounty
Blood Dance-lite for AE/VK/fire comps.  Ignites on second hit for support 
purposes.  Get if you use support FS.

*Seven Thunders of Retribution: Narukami*
Precursor: *Seven Thunders of Retribution: Rumble* / Gacha (Divine Key)
Replaces *Domain* on HoT - removing those 3 wasted seconds every ult is worth it.

######Cannons
*Briareus EX* (Mixed)
Precursor: *Briarius PRI* / Bounty
Mandatory (with a caveat - CH/HoS are significantly better, so skip if you have either)  In the 
running for the best support/farmable PRI released to date - massive impair field at 0sp, works with 
Teri Origins M, and can be used with DK to activate Newton [B] from off field.

*Domain of Ascension* (Laser)
Precursor: *Key of Ascension* / Gacha
Required for HoTr to even compete with AE, and the active is tailored for the upcoming triple
Herrscher tri-element kompu team.

*Domain of Revelation* (Shell)
Precursor: *Key of Reason* / Gacha
Upgrade to Key of Reason to bring HoR back up from her recent meta slide.  Delayed
activation now, so it might be better to pop the skill before HoR's ult vs the old
way of using it immediately after.  TDM on charge attacks, so it's the new general
purpose Bronya DPS PRI.  Works as a second choice on Boobnya too.  Replaced on
HoR by *Star of Eden* PRI, with this and the new *Willows* set, there's no reason to
ever roll on the old *KoR*/*Welt* banners ever again.

*Falcon Flare: FINAL* (Shell)
Precursor: *Falcon Flare 0019* / Gacha
Motif for Boobnya, near mandatory, like most of the recent PRI motif weapons.  
Can also be used with HB for the qte-activated team ice buffs.

*Star Destroyer 19C-X* (Missile)
Precursor: *Star Destroyer 19c* / Bounty
Crap.  BriEx does its job better - amusing FPS mode though.  Skip.

*Star of Eden: World* (Shell)
Precursor: *Star of Eden: Anti-Entropy* / Gacha (Divine Key)
Solidly replaces *DoR* on HoR due to adding clock-stop to her ult animation, and giving her
bar regen during her ult.  Due to being a divine key, it'll be put in suck-ass split-rate weapon
banners, so get it when you can.

*Tower of the Past: Silk Ladder* (Shell)
Precursor: *Tower of the Past* / Gacha
Vill-V's motif, utterly unusable on anyone but her.

######Greatswords
*Shuhadaku of Uriel*
Precursor: *Might of An-Utu* / Gacha (Divine Key)
Divine Key PRIs MUST be forged from their maxed antecedents, so fuck you if you salvaged
your An-Utu.  Stack the shit out of your debuffs and erase bosses.  Note: Absolutely ruins
your damage output after dropping the double nuke, so only use the second hit vs end-stage
bosses that you are certain to kill.  VK is kill with tittybar Rita, and the rise of multi-phase
bosses means Uriel is now junk.

*Sleeper's Dream*
Precursor(s): *Swan Lake* or *Sleeping Beauty* / Gacha
I cri evry tiem.  New fusion of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake - unlocking either of them
will let you forge it.  Weapon active has a self-damage proc to force FTD/BB's ults to 
activate, but it loses most of the general purpose abilities of Sleeping Beauty/Swan Lake.
Get Swan Lake from the resonator exchange and forge from there.

*Surtr Muspellsverd*
Precursor: *Godslayer: Surtr* / Gacha
An attempt to fix Blood Rose without actually buffing her.  Excellent general purpose
weapon, readily usable by all Greatsword wielders.

######Crosses
*11th Leitourgia*
Precursor: *11th Sacred Relic* / Gacha
Mandatory for CH due to the mad SP gained per proc and SP recovery boost.  Active
gives a massive 20% crit rate field, makes enemies melt if you have a kitted physical
DPS.

*Basilisk's Image: Deathshroud*
Precursor:*Basilisk's Image* / Gacha
Mad boost over the base weapon, very important for Mobius due to the damage and 
recovery boosts for her combo attack.

*Elysian Astra: Heart's Color*
Precursor: *Elysian Astra* / Gacha
Important for Griseo - QTE in, unload ult and go.

*Hekate's Sombre*
Precursor:*Hekate's Gloom* / Gacha
Brings TP back up a bit from the hard fall due to AF.  Speeds up rage recovery and
helps build combo stacks faster than before.  Can also be used in place of Zither/Astra on
SA/Griseo.

*Salvation of Sakura*
Precursor: *Pledge of Sakura* / Bounty (Divine Key)
Ignition, fast SP growth, and a fixed damage type from base to benefit from +fire stigs.  Even 
at max upgrade, feels weak/comparable to the magical stick as dps, since the goosefuckers
intended it to be for Rimestar/DA support instead of designing it for SR first and adding
the support after.  Replaces BD/Ruinous in poverty fire/ignition comps.

######Gauntlets
*Cosmic Duality*
Precursor: *Nebulous Duality* / Gacha
Support fist upgrade for AE, removes the self-bleed effect on main skill and adds a
secondary SP trigger from other valks using their ults.  Support TDM was slightly
buffed, and the active now gives max stacks on use for quick rotation.  TDM on 
combo was stripped out, making it less interesting for HoS/NS, but the increased
base ATK at lv 65 makes up for it.

*Domain of Sentience*
Precursor: *Keys of Oblivion* / Gacha
New PRI for HoS, important for the sp gain (can sub with Nebs, but you lose the damage
boosts.)  +phys is locked to herrscher mode, so not as useful for NS (still the new BiS on
her, though.)

*Nuada's Revenge*
Precursor: *Nuada's Grief* / Gacha
BiS for both SK and HotF.  Usually can get away with switching between them,
though.  Less mandatory now due to HoT shilling and Mobius taking Rita.

*Oblivion Down*
Precursor: *Fenghuang Down* / Gacha (Divine Key)
New damage gear for PX/AE, useful for forcing fire Benares.  Great SP gain.

######Scythes
*Astral Divide: Pisces*
Precursor: *Astral Rend: White Dwarf* / Gacha
SpA's scythe, the now standard rules apply.  Gives the same off-field charge regen
as the base, with significantly better modifiers.

*Iris of Hellheim*
Precursor: *Iris of the Dreams* / Gacha
Rework of FR to make her more of a secondary dps/debuffer.  Trades out the team TDM
for more self damage, faster rune application, and a monster buff to her ult.  Definitely
worth the upgrade for the instant runestacks > Garmr > stain on rotation, way more
useful and consistent than 15% diluted TDM when you have proper supports.

*Path to Acheron: Kindred*
Precursor: *Path to Acheron* / Gacha
Statstick upgrade for SN - also good on SP Seele.

*Sanguine Gaze: Union*
Precursor: *Sanguine Gaze* / Gacha
Motif for SeX.  Better damage than Skadi, but lacks the fast SP.  Fast active.

*Skadi of Thrymheim*
Precursor: *Skadi Ondurgud* / Gacha
Fantastic on AKA, but absolute shit on everyone other than SeX, due to the TDM being replaced 
with Ice DMG mods.  Mandatory if you use AKA, usable for faster SP on SeX.

######Lances
*Abyss Flower: Liminal Spiral*
Precursor:*Abyss Flower* / Gacha (Divine Key)
Uncalled-for goose wank, given that the non-pri was perfectly good as a memorial nuke, and BKE
is getting Hler PRI as well in the future.  Only good on the goose.

*Hler's Ataraxia*
Precursor:*Hler's Serenity* / Gacha
BKE's second PRI, seems intended for abyss floors with multiple sub-waves of trash mobs since you can
stay in burst and spread out more consistent damage compared to Flower's single damage spike.
Should also work with Asuka now, since the BKE-only crit rate boost was made into a straight buff to
the wielder.

*Midnight Ataegina*
Precursor: *Midnight Eclipse* / Gacha
Motif for PE, even more mandatory than usual, since the skill is part of her normal attack string.

*Sagittarius Astra*
Precursor: *Starlance Prime* / Gacha
Mandatory for the new S-rank fire goose - also replaces Eos Gloria on VG.  This PRI on 
release shit is getting old.

######Bows
*Domain of Ego: Flawless Return*
Precursor: *Key of Ego* / Gacha
New PRI for HoHE, provides needed SP regen.  Not many choices for bows, so p. much mandatory.

*Whisper of the Past: Sonnet*
Precursor: *Whisper of the Past* / Gacha
Signature bow for pink gobbo, no alternatives due to PRI stat inflation, but if you have your
physical supports kitted, goblin can be used to budget clear most content that doesn't hard
counter her (either mechanically or type wise.)

######Chakrams
*Purana Phantasma: Nighteye*
Precursor: *Purana Phantasma* / Gacha
Signature weapon for kot, and the first of the new class.  Mandatory for Pardo, and can be used by
Ai-chan.

*Lost Conviction: Damnation*
Precursor: *Lost Conviction* / Gacha
Aponia signature, same as usual, part of the kit is cut off and put into the weapon, and Gilded Librae,
while workable, isn't a comparable alternative.

*Rudder in Dream Λ-I*
Precursor: *Rudder in Dream* / Gacha
Ai-chan's weapon.  Strangely feels more like a dps weapon than the usual stacked support fare.  Can
be subbed by *Purana* if you skip Ai-chan's gear.

*Twirling Glaze: Lustrous*
Precursor: *Twirling Glaze* / Gacha
Susannah's weapon - mandatory, since she's a DPS.  While you *can* sub out for Pardo PRI, it won't
work very well comparatively.

######Javelins
*Prophetic Dreams: Self Fulfilling*
Precursor: *Prophetic Dreams* / Gacha
Hare's weapon, obviously mandatory (and single use), since she's the only Javelin user thus far.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#####Stigmata
Section has been split due to the addition of G2-4 stigmata to the crafting pool.  G1 is your basic
2-3wk crafting option, and things only get worse from there.
######G1 Stigs
*Cleopatra*
		T - Good against non-boss fatties/Doesn't work on bosses
		M - Stun has the worst duration of all effects, and mechs are immune.
		B - Mandatory for KMB/DJ/HotF paralysis mobbing
		Note: With the 5.6 changes to status effects, [M] and [B] might become more useful in the future.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	*Dracula*
		T - Excellent physical filler when using Griseo.
		M - Loads of SP, but generally 2 good +sp/sec affixes will serve just as well
		B - Better on LK, since TP loses her stacking crit dmg against mobs.
		2pc	- One of the better passive damage abilities, just keep critting.  Might
		also be workable in Elysian Realm due to the bats counting as 3 summons.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	*Ekaterina*
		T	-	Skip
		M	-	Good on all physical damagers - if you can keep your combo stacks
		B	-	Skip
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	*Fuxi*
		T	-	Decent on AKA vs non-bosses
		M	-	Mandatory for DJ/HotF paralysis mobbing
		B	-	Good on BR/VK/FS/VG
		Note: Same as Cleopatra, these stigs might be useful in the future.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	*Jixuanyuan*
		T	-	Decent for shield-breaker qtes/SA qte spam
		M	-	Decent phys Bronya filler
		B	-	Skip
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Higokumaru*
			T	-	Good top fire piece
			M	-	Normally not used, but has a special extra-stronk knock-up
			B	-	A. Spd w/damage pulse
			2pc	-	The old FS meta set as [T+B] and either Nuwa or Shakespeare [M]
			3pc	-	Had some use forcing combo stacks in older Memorial speed runs.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Kallen Pledge*
			T	-	Shit
			M	-	Shit 
			B	-	Shit
			Note: Good to salvage for cheap resos
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Kepler*
			T	-	Old KMB mob murdering equip
			M	-	Not necessary anymore, due to Positron Blasters passive paralyze
			B	-	Shit
			2pc	-	Was used on KMB before Positron Blasters, now replaced with 4-star Tesla [T]
					and 5-star DXY [M]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Lier*
			T	-	Skip
			M	-	Skip
			B	-	Fussy to use, but good in Memorial - don't use in constant bleed Abyss.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Lier Scarlet*
			T	-	Good on TP/non-burst (sp-draining ult-mode) characters
			M	-	Passive damage pulse.  Skip.
			B	-	Good A.Spd piece, without making you slow as shit like Planck [B]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Nagamitsu*
			T	-	Not bad, decent as 2pc with [M] on LE/SK
			M	-	Still p. decent.  Provides a passive conductive field.
			B	-	L2P
			2pc	-	Slow field is decent for LE/S-rank SK
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Nohime*
			T	-	Status effects don't last very long, and bosses are generally immune
			M	-	This is flat added damage, not a damage modifier
			B	-	Similar to [T], set is very focused on trash sweeping
			3pc	-	The only reason to use Nohime at all.  +80% is (was) a big boost.  Compared
					to more recent ice stigs, seriously gimped.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Nuwa*
			T -	Useless, conditional 20% TDM
			M - Was good long ago, but with the split-phase bosses that fucking drop your combo, now sucks.
			B - Could be fantastic if we get an Ignite DPS a la Griseo/Susannah for bleed (likely why we won't)
			2pc/3pc - Not worth giving up all three slots to buff summoned unit DPS.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    
		*Shakespeare*
			T	-	Solid single piece Lightning damage
			M	-	Solid single piece Fire damage (can be replaced with Jingwei M on BR/VG)
			B	-	Solid single piece Ice damage (can be replaced with Rasputin B in rotation comps)
			2pc	-	[M+B] can be used with Kongming [T] for fast evasion cooldowns in memorial
			Note-	Shakespeare is one of the best single piece elemental sets in the game.  Farm as needed
					to suit your elemental dps.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Shennong* (the horror won't end)
			T	-	Could be great if there was a phys supporter that dropped SP packs like PX - as is, memorial only.
			M	-	No.  Just No.
			B	-	NO.
			2/3pc	-	This is possibly the worst stigmata set in the game.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Siegfried Kaslana*
			T	-	Avogadro memes
			M	-	Better version of Teri Origins [M] - if -10% CD is worth the grind for you
			B	-	Weapon skill memes
			2pc	-	May be useful in the future with the right PRI arm, who knows.
&nbsp;
######G2 Stigs
These stigs are about twice as expensive by materials cost vs G1.  Conversion from G1>G2 costs over half the
price of a G2 stigmata directly.  Might be worth it if you have a spare G1 stigmata and don't need the 
resonators (you always need resonators.)
&nbsp;
	*Beethoven*
		Transmute: None / Fuel + Lenses only
		T	-	Garbo, only good for the 2pc set bonus
		M	-	Good for lazy fags for the passive off-field melee phys bonus
		B 	-	Fantastic.  +15 SP on switch in is often enough to use cheap utility ults on refresh.
		2pc - Usable, but very conditional.  Buff goes poof if you need another support before dps.
		3pc - Survival skills are ass.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	*Caravaggio*
		Transmute: None / Fuel + Lenses only
		T 	-	TDM filler piece
		M	-	The meat of the set, good supportive piece
		B	-	Bad, the a.spd is too low
		2pc - [T+M] work well on Fish if you skipped Zhenyi
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   
		*Gustav Klimt*
		T - Only worth a shit for the 2pc effect
		M - Team phys on weapon usage with a long cooldown
		B - LMAO LOL
		2pc - Was a premier physical support set for a long, long time, but sucks compared to the absurdly stacked stigs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently being released.  [T]+[M]+Newton are workable cope. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;       
    		*Jin Shengtan*
			M - Good off-field ice damage piece, can also be used as on-field dps filler
			2pc - This is p. much the only reason to farm the set.  [T]+[M] with a Newt [B] is the classic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elemental support set (can be used on Pardo if you skipped her stigs.)
			3pc - Normally not used - extending the buff can be nice, but it depends on your dps.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;        
		*Michelangelo*
			Transmute: *Ekaterina*
			T	-	Good damage boost, but only for non-ult attacks
			M	-	Weakest piece, normally replaced by Ekat [M]
			B	-	Best piece, tons of stacking crit damage, works well on TP/MC
			2pc	-	Use [T+B] if possible - remember you need to switch to refresh the buff
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Monet*
			Transmute: *Nagamitsu*
			T	-	Best general [T] lightning piece due to mixed ele/total mods - keep the combo up
			M	-	2nd best piece, important for the 2pc w/[T]
			B	-	Good with LE/S-rank SK for activating vs status buffs
			2pc	-	Good chunk of extra ele damage - don't get hit.  [T+M] are best.
			3pc	-	LE/S-rank SK only
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Nobel*
		Note: I'm not even going to waste the space - dogshit set.  Even when it was new, people just 
used Michelangelo/Ekat/Michel on MC.  Purely a collectable.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    
		*Planck*
			Transmute: None / Fuel + Lenses only
		T	-	Old BR [T] piece, needs health balancing to work, skip
		M	-	Works on all non-burst physical valks, but doesn't affect ults and increases self damage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually replaceable with Ekatrina [M]
		B	-	Very high attack speed bonus, and since you're able to swap chars, the downside isn't as
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bad as it seems.  Part of a good SK build (Monet/Dirac/Planck).  Also good for fast stacking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of PX/AE brands.
		Set -	No current DPS Bronya deals majority physical damage.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Robert Peary*
			Transmute: *Nohime*
			T	-	Excellent.  Can be a good filler too, due to flat TDM
			M	-	Excellent.  24% TDM = excellent filler
			B	-	Shit.  Important only for set completion bonus.
			2pc	-	Bonus isn't too good, but [T+M] are strong enough to not care.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Tesla Band*
			Transmute: None / Fuel + Lenses only
			T	-	Excellent off-field physical support piece
			M	-	Excellent off-field lightning support piece
			B	-	Acceptable as a stand-alone [B] for a lightning DPS
			Set	-	No.  Chain lightning is too weak vs better +elec stigs
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Thales*
			Transmute: *Higokumaru*
			T	-	Fire version of Peary [T], good in general
			M	-	Gives rare Fire Damage Taken debuff for multiplicative stacking
			B	-	Stop getting hit
			2pc	-	[T+M] is the old VKE fire meta set with Fuxi [B]
			3pc	-	Just bring your Jingwei ELF, ok?
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Wilde*
			Transmute: None / Fuel + Lenses only
			T - Workable [T] piece for SN / phys types that can force fracture
			M - lol, no
			B - Force bleed, but the duration is shit
&nbsp; 
######G3 Stigs
Fucking hell.  You'd think with the absurd requirements, the game would just bend over and present
once you forge these.  Each piece costs ~2.5x as much as a G2 (including the precursor G2 cost.)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Allan Poe*
		Precursor: None / Direct Craft
		T	-	Wonky scaling, anywhere from 18% crit rate to 8% crit rate + 20% phys damage
		M	-	Slightly janky given weapon skills can reset it, but can give a good chunk of crit damage
		B	-	Nice piece, only [B] piece that gives evasion reduction afaik
		2pc	-	Minimum requirement for SN, can also use [M+B] w/Wilde [T] and be reasonably near the 3pc
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Ana Schariac*
			Precursor: *Robert Peary*
			T	-	Good, but you need to be hugging to avoid the damage drop-off
			M	-	Fail vs Peary [M].  Make this the last one you forge when going for the 3pc
			B	-	Good, but worse than Shakes [B] on its own.
			2pc	-	[T]+[B] if you go through this hell.
			3pc	-	The +50% TDM is why you suffer.
			Note: Where the fuck did the ice-damage-taken debuff go???  Bob Peary [T+M] and Shakes [B] is
a tolerable placeholder during the multi-month grind (bitch to maintain combo, though.)  Go for 3pc
Ana or don't bother (T+B>M.)  Competitive with Welt on HoR as a 3pc.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Dante*
		Precursor: None / Direct craft
		M - Works on phys that can force activate their evasions (BKE/Hare)
		2pc - Good as [T]+[M] with Elysia [B] on BKE with Abyss Flower
		3pc - Self Impair for BKE with Hler
		Notes: Like all Dudu gear, it's so damn restrictive.  Mainly for Burst Charged Phys, but then you have
to account for needing either a forcible evasion or needing to wait to evade for perfect mantle.  At this tier
of irritation, you might as well just work on Dirac to convert into Elysia 2-3pc and be in a better place for
off-BKE usage.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;        
		*Dickens*
			Precursor: None / Direct craft
			Notes: I'm not even going to bother.  Absolute waste as a G3, and everyone skipped 
even back when FT was first released.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    
		*Dirac*
        	Precursor: *Michelangelo* / Direct craft
			T	-	Crit rate - mostly used to complete a 2pc/3pc set
            M	-	Best single piece burst booster in the game (NS/SFM/SK/HoS/etc.)
			B	-	Mass SP on dodge, ticker runs even when off field, great for slow starters.
			2pc - Good for physical bursters with either built in impair or with HoS support
			3pc - Self sustaining impair, good for long bursters w/o HoS, or field hogs like BKE w/Hler
			Notes:  [M] and [B] are fantastic pieces, but >G3.  Be ready to grind.  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Fu Hua: Margrave*
			Precursor: None / Direct Craft
			2pc	-	Only way to use this set, given that the activation is tied to the 2pc effect.  Nominally, you can
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use [T+B] with either a weapon cooldown stig like Siegfried or an off-field booster like JST,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tesla Band, or Fu Hua Musician.  Also good for Eden/Griseo.
			3pc -  Mandatory if you don't have Nebs and need to use Grips of Tai Xuan.  Good on or in teams with 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self/team funders like Eden/Pardo/Sushang.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Irene Adler*
		Precursor: None / Direct Craft Only
		T - Good off-field piece for elemental supports (needs B)
		M - Worthless outside of the 3pc for FR
		B - Good elemental support piece
		2pc - [T+B] is a good elemental support set, usable with tesla band [M] on Fischl
		3pc - Mainly for FR, and if you're running DPS FR, you might as well use Handel and solve her SP issues.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    
		*Ishikawa Goemon*
			Precursor: *Monet*
			T	-	Trash.  Monet is strictly better.
			M	-	Excellent mixed modifier [M] piece.
			B	-	Good solo lightning [B], similar to Tesla Band [B]
			2pc	-	Most lightning dps use combo attacks, so it's gravy.  [M+B] along with Monet [T] were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the general purpose elec set.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Kafka*
		Precursor: None / Direct Craft Only
		T - Good general top piece for physical, assuming crit rate is high
		M - Sidegrade Ekatrina [M]
		B - >needing crit rate to get crit rate
		2pc - [T]+[M] are great for any physical charge attack users like TP/Delta
		3pc - Only used with TP for the post super charged attack combo regen, still can be replaced with [T+M] 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Elysia [B] if you have Hekate PRI to cover the hit regen.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Leeuwenhoek*
			Precursor: *Thales*
			T - Great
			M - Great, but Thales [M] is cheaper and usually a better choice
			B - Great
			2pc - Commonly used as [T+B] with Thales [M]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
		*Shakespeare Adrift*
        Precursor: None / Direct Craft Only    
		Notes: This set is why everyone pooh-pooh'd DA when she came out - it only works on her.  Other than VG (who only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets 3/4 stacks off the stigs,) there are a grand total of zero fire valks that can spam their ult fast enough
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make real use of the set.  Get if you have DA, otherwise, skip.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;    
		*Shuijing*
        Precursor: None / Direct Craft Only    
		T - Passive phys off field support and on qte team buff
		M - Filler for the 3pc set bonus, but with the fat shields lately, good on Carole
		B - Good phys taken debuff, use with [T] for the 50% duration extension
		3pc - Good physical support set for Carole/Griseo/HoS/SA
&nbsp;
######G4 Stigs
They really, really, *really* expect you to pull for these, and only craft the ones you're missing - it's the sort
of left-handed rodgering you should come to expect when Mihoyo makes something "farmable" at release.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
*Elysia*
Precursor: *Dirac*
T - Good, but needs a high crit rate (all new phys valks seem to have a high CRT stat)
M - Unconditional phys+ and evasion cooldown, great
B - Good for phys charged attackers, can be used with BKE and Abyss Flower
2pc - [T]+[B] are the new general purpose physical filler.
Note - With how fucking expensive this G4 tier is, if you intend to build MPE, you might as well try to pull
her bow first, possibly saving you from getting duplicate stigs.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
*Handel*
Precursor: *Goemon*
T - Good self and support lightning buff
M - Good lightning buff for weapon skill users
B - Good lightning buff and self battery
2pc: Due to the force-activate on ult, plus the refreshing nature of the buffs, Handel [M]+[B] replace
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goemon as the cope lightning set of choice.
3pc: Good buff, but can't stack, so 1 fullset per team maximum.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
*Willows*
Precursor: *Ana Schariac*
T - Significant 1pc ice damage buff
M - Also significant self damage buff (with an odd restriction - ice Teri soon?)
B - Attack speed and a coveted damage taken debuff
2pc - Gives some needed SP regen to HoR for her burst rotation
3pc - Good for HoR's ult w/*Star of Eden: World*
Note: A fair buff over Ana, getting rid of the leashing is significant.

####Foundry Gear
All these gears cost imaginons.  These weapons will also be your primary source
of Honkai Cores for upgrading your actually good gear.  You can buy 1/3 core shards to make
cores cheaper, but it is generally a good idea to buy and salvage each weapon at least 
once to fill in your encyclopedia.

Imaginons are readily farmable.  Assuming that you are focusing on them, it takes
about a week and a half to acquire 150 of either type (40 weekly from the asterite shop, 
25 from the pin shop, remainder from refreshing open world tasks for 3-4 of the type you 
need.  Salvage spare dual sakura blossoms/nanoceramic/A.skill mats from the dalies for the
needed asterite.)
	
**NOTHING IN THIS SECTION CAN BE SALVAGED FOR RESONATORS OR USED FOR A PRI ARM**


#####Basic Weapons
!!!info
	Almost everything in this section sucks due to Universal Mirage, so temper your 
	expectations and avoid using your cores - you only get 1 back when you salvage.
&nbsp;
**Pistols**
	*Fafnir Flame*	/ AE Imaginon
		Core Fodder
&nbsp;
	*Jingwei's Wings* / AE Imaginon
		Solid single-target physical guns.  Active can ignite and apply Newton/PP 
		Mei from off field.
&nbsp;
	*Spirit Guns - Yae* / Ranger Cred
		Some uses for the bleed on hit (KMB/Sherlock, perhaps) - otherwise, skip.
&nbsp;
	*Usurpers*	/ Co-op Mats
		Skip, Co-op mats take too long to collect vs. imaginons
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Katana**
	*Futsunushi-To*	/ AE Imaginon
		RNG=Bad.  Decent when the stars align.
&nbsp;
	*Plasma Kagehide*	/ AE Imaginon
		Core Fodder
&nbsp;
	*Sky Breaker*	/ AE Imaginon
		Mixed feelings on this one.  Good impair on active, but all physical Meis
		are sustained damage.  May have some use on support DS.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Cannons**
	*Cyclops PRI* (Shell)	/ AE Imaginon
		Only free TDM cannon, still Core Fodder
&nbsp;
	~~*Eye of the Collapse* (Laser)	/ Kolosten Rewards
		Can force collapse, good in memorial.  Cooldown is Looooong, so either use Theresa
		/Sieg/Avogadro [M], or have enough dps to kill with a single proc.~~  Fucking lel, they
		actually made it a gacha weapon, the absolute balls.
&nbsp;
	*Hellfire Type III* (Shell)	/ Ranger Cred
		Skip.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Greatswords**
	*Dark Xuanyuan Sword*	/ AE Imaginon
		Semi-useful due to time-fracture on hit.
&nbsp;
	*Dragon Spine*	/ AE Imaginon
		Core Fodder.
&nbsp;
	*Judgement by Dawn*	/ Co-op Mats
		Had edge use in a MC/BB comp on BB with DXY M.  Useless if you have BriEX/HoS.
&nbsp;
	*Labor of Olympus*	/ Phase 1 PHO Gacha
		Surtr's retarded, crippled son.  Good BR filler, but costs cores to 
		upgrade.  Not in foundry, but placed here due to the core requirements.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Crosses**
	*Selune's Elegy*		/ AE Imaginon
		There is no ice Teri.  Core Fodder.
&nbsp;
	*Silver Reaper*			/ AE Imaginon
		Core Fodder.  Can be used to trigger weaken QTEs.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Gauntlets**
	*Stellar Vortex*	/ AE Imaginon
		Decent filler for NS, but you'll want to replace with Nebs/KoO ASAP.
		Supposedly p. good with Chuu Hua (HoS).
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Scythes**
	*Onyx Iron*		/ AE Imaginon
		Decent Seele/Rita filler, but don't waste cores on it unless you have no
		other option.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Lances**
	*Endothermic Lance VF*	/ AE Imaginon
		Straight upgrade to Lucia.  Guess they needed something F2P to shill
		S-rank fire goose.  Flat TDM and the active damage type morphs to suit
		the equipped valk.  Decent enough with the four damage type coverage
		that you can consider spending cores to upgrade.
&nbsp;
	*Lucia*		/ AE Imaginon
		Was good, now sucks.  Get Endothermic.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Bows**
	*Call of Crescent* / AE Imaginon
		First craftable bow in game, shares the same damage morph skill as
		the Endothermic lance.  Tolerable as a cope weapon, given that you can
		move it around to any bow user that gets released.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Chakrams**
	*Gilded Librae* / AE Imaginon
		Filler craftable chakram, works as a cope weapon on Aponia - not much
		to choose from, due to being a new weapon type.  Garbo for Susannah
		due to being explicitly elemental damage.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
**Javelins**
	*Mirage Spearhead* / AE Imaginon
		Filler weapon for Hare, damage wise similar to her base weapon, but gets
		dumpstered by her PRI.
&nbsp;
#####Basic Stigmata
!!!info
	With the continued expansion of the Mirage catalogue, most of the SS Imaginon-only
	stigmata should be considered early to mid game filler - there are some exceptions.
&nbsp;
	*Cocolia*
		T	-	Big (Skip)
		M	-	Big (Skip)
		B	-	Big (Skip)
&nbsp;
	*Dark Jixuanyuan*
		T	-	Strong shield-break pulse.  Good.
		M	-	Strong Crit boost, good for KMB.
		B	-	Decent A.Spd under fracture
		2pc	-	Good for VD burst rotation, good sp gain for DP/Kikaku effects
		3pc	-	Trash
&nbsp;
	*Darwin*
		T	-	Good.  Cheaper Shakes [T].
		M	-	-DMG taken is useless/Only get it to complete 2/3pc bonus
		B	-	Good.  Boost persists when switching/in Dirac.
		2/3pc	-	Lower cost Monet
&nbsp;
	*Edwin Hubble*
		T	-	On-call freeze.  Has some uses.
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Skip
&nbsp;
	*Einstein*
		T	-	Skip
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Bronya/Himeko filler piece
&nbsp;
	*Fu Hua Musician*
		T	-	Meh.  Good for 2pc w/Newt [B]
		M	-	Good.  F2P off-field fire booster.
		B	-	Good.  Easier to get version of Fuxi [B].
		2pc	-	Excellent off-field TDM
		3pc	-	Good filler for PX
&nbsp;
	*Homecoming Theatre*
		Princess-	Skip
		Knight	-	Excellent replacement for Ekatrina on melee phys.  Don't get hit.
		Overlord-	Only good if you can crit-spam
		2pc	-	Might be decent in low Dirac
&nbsp;
	*Jingwei*
		T	-	Best cheap general bossing piece.  Get multiple.
		M	-	Good on BR/VK/VG, similar to Shakes [M]
		B	-	Some sustain for BR, normally unnecessary
&nbsp;
	*Marco Polo*
		T	-	Good
		M	-	Good
		B	-	Good - replaceable with event Onyx Simiurgh [B] for a more dps oriented build, but
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sp can still be useful for rotation supports.  With Beethoven [B] being in foundry,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can just go with that instead.
		2pc	-	That 250% is a single instance of damage (ATK * 2.5), so don't get hung up on it.
&nbsp;
	*Mary Shelley*
		T	-	Pseudo-Schrodinger [T] for VC.  Skip.
		M	-	Impact shield, can have some uses - or just l2p.  Skip.
		B	-	Had some use on old YA.
&nbsp;
	*Mendelev*
		T	-	Skip
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Decent Atilla [B] replacement for field-hogs like BKE/SJ
&nbsp;
	*Picasso*
		T	-	Good on non-burst physical damage dealers.  Can get it from Chronicle 2 missions.
		M	-	40% bleed resistance.  Can get it from Chronicle 7 missions.
		B	-	Decent attack speed.  Really fucking expensive.
		2pc	-	[T+M] is best - paint effect can also be used for support.
&nbsp;
	*Rasputin*
		T	-	Only works well on AKA vs non-bosses
		M	-	Decent if you can keep your combo stacks - 3 star Scott [M] is generally better
		B	-	Can replace Shakespeare [B] in rotation ice comps, but since Shakes is in g1 Mirage, just get that.
&nbsp;
	*Seele Volleri*
		T	-	Decent Phys Damage boost - might need +HP affixes to max out
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Decent A.Spd with high health, same problem as [T]
		2pc	-	Ultra instinct can sometimes fuck up your dodges
		3pc	-	Weapon skill spam has never been meta
&nbsp;
	*Seven Deadly Sins*
		Gluttony-	Good support [T] piece.  Cheap, so buy a few.
		Wrath	-	Skip
		Pride	-	Decent Atilla [B] replacement, but cranks Abyss bleed
		Sloth	-	Good for ult-bot valks like SS
&nbsp;
	*Yae Sakura*
		T	-	Skip
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Skip	
&nbsp;
	*Zhangheng*
		T	-	Skip
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Excellent on HotF if you can stomach the autistic activation requirement.
		3pc	-	Decent support effect, but way too expensive to field
&nbsp;
	*Zhuge Kongming*
		T	-	F2P evasion cooldown, good on KMB in Memorial
		M	-	Skip
		B	-	Old YA shield booster, similar to Shelley [B]
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
	**4* SPECIAL MENTIONS:**
&nbsp;	
	*Atilla*
		B	-	Standard [B]-piece filler for all physical valks
&nbsp;
	*Edison* 
		Note: ~~Not for actual use.  Since edison only costs 48 honkai pieces (the shitty ones,~~
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~not the weapon upgrade mats) you can buy and salvage for relatively cheap ~~
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~affix crystals.~~  Affix crystals available for coins now.
&nbsp;    
	*Kitten Fun*
		2pc	-	[T+B] are solid choices with Jingwei [M] for early BR/VK/VG builds.
&nbsp;
	*Ogier*
		T	-	Good early [T] phys damage filler, good mid game for off-field +elemental damage
		B	-	Passive off-field physical damage.
		2pc	-	Might have some use tanking just a bit more bleed to kill an abyss boss
&nbsp;
	*Roald Amundsen*
		3pc	-	Off-field elemental damage boost if you have nothing better for 3 slots
&nbsp;
	*Scott*
		T	-	Good on ice damage dealers (GM/AKA/HoR)
		M	-	Better version of Rasputin [M] without the combo requirement - not as good on AKA
		2pc	-	+12% TDM makes Scott [T+M]/Rasputin [B] generally better and cheaper than Scott [T]/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasputin [M+B]
&nbsp;
	*Theresa: Origins*
		M	-	Easiest source for support weapon cooldown reduction.  Mandatory.
		3pc	-	Fantastic early game off-field physical damage boost.  Excellent with SA.

&nbsp;
####Other Gear
While Ranger weapons and Co-op divine keys are lacking, they don't require Honker cores to
upgrade, so they all make good early stat-sticks if you lack better gacha gear.  Chronicles requires a fair
bit of grinding, and the free Divine Keys can only be acquired when their attendant co-op raid rotates
through - if the key you want isn't currently available, just wait, it'll come back eventually.  Just
remember: filler is still filler.

#####Chronicles Weapons
*Ranger's Cross*					/ Chronicle 1
		Ignite on deploy.  Decent filler for Teri.  Can be good for Rimestar shield break.
&nbsp;
	*Ranger's Sawtooth*				/ Chronicle 3
		Filler for Himeko/Roza/Lili
&nbsp;
	*Ranger's Laser*				/ Chronicle 4
		Decent on DB for co-op.  Active counters the need to facehug with lasers.
&nbsp;
	*Ranger's Pistol*					/ Chronicle 5
		Filler for Kiana/Kallen.
&nbsp;
	*Ranger Gauntlets*				/ Chronicle 6
		Excellent early filler for bursty Fu Huas due to the TDM on skill.  Good on 
		NS/HotF, just manage your HP properly.
#####Co-op Divine Keys
*Judgement of Shamash*			/ Pistols
		Filler pistol, active has a nice TDM-taken modifier.  Lay off the active in co-op,
		no one likes to stand around waiting for your dead ass.
&nbsp;
	*Jizo Mitama*						/ Katana
		Good Yae/Mei filler on Miko/SD due to their knock-up.  Jizo summon is amusing.
		Can support with Turganev.
&nbsp;
	*Star of Eden*					/ Cannon/Shell
		Used to have the succ on impact, was beta nerfed to just suck.  Nice projectile.
		Note that this is **not** the new PRI for HoR.
&nbsp;
	*Cleaver of Shamash*				/ Greatsword
		Piss-weak TDM, but has passive <50% HP heal, so had some use on BR.
&nbsp;
	*Grips of Tai Xuan*				/ Gauntlets
		Fantastic PX weapon, often better than her motif, since she's a shit damage dealer.
		Active triggers a ton of QTEs.  Better sustained damage than Ranger Gauntlets.

&nbsp;
####Final Notes
Always have multiple sources of information
You really think someone would do that?  Just go on the internet and lie?
You're the one playing your account, only you can decide where and what to invest in.
Just because a stig/weapon is good, that doesn't mean you need to burn half your inventory for resonators.
This guide just gets amended each patch, not rewritten, so entries can/will be of varying age/relevance.
