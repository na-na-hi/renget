->Espurr is a strange, quiet cat who rarely voices an opinion on matters. They don't join in on many conflicts, only doing what they're needed to without much room for exception. Espurr has an affinity for gravity, though they seem to have some issue controlling it. Espurr always keeps a blank expression on their face, and they lack a shine to their eyes. Often times, they are busy suppressing their psychic powers and controlling their powerful, gravity-altering thoughts, too invested in themselves to worry about the world around them. Their origin is not known, and Espurr isn't receptive to frivolous conversation.<-
