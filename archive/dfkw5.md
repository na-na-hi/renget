0:29~0:54
He stands there, beneath the vast blue sky. The ground beneath his feet coming undone, being devoured by the vast sky.
His own self— tearing itself apart, breaking down in many pieces.
“These are the world’s fragments                     my fragments.”

0:55~59
A big cat stands before him. It speaks to him: “It is radio waves.”
Confused, he repeats the cats’ words: “It is radio waves.”
Perhaps his life can be wonderful?
“It is not wonderful.” Speaks the cat.

0:59~1:01
The ground around him changes from the blue sky. Becoming a familiar room, a familiar office with blood stained ground and corpses. A demon standing before him. He shouldn’t care, there isn’t anything to care about.
Despite his own indifference, something inside him tells that the demon is wrong, the blood and corpses are wrong. “This isn’t correct.”
The demon sneers, a grim and tooth smile on its curved lips. “It is correct.” Its shadow soon engulf him and the room—


1:01~:1:04
This time, a knight stands before him, disgust in his face and revolt shining in his eyes. Around him, once again, piles of corpses. “Is it wrong?” He already went too far to care, too far to feel remorse.
“It is wrong.” Answers the knight. 

1:04~1:08
The knight disappears in mist, leaving him behind, a strange feeling of euphoria rushing in, forcing to laugh.
Holding his face, he feels something drop from his eyes. “Am I crying?”
Despite the euphoria, only Sadness filled the void inside his heart.

1:08~1:13
Once again, the big cat appears. The one with the answers. “IS our mission mysterious?” The cat sighs.
“It is doubtful”

Worry suddenly fills his heart. “Is it cleansed?” He asks.
“It is not appearing” the cat answers, as his vision once again fades to black.

1:23~1:49
He remembers when it all started, back in the prison. “Chaos start with healing.” His body forcefully patches itself. Will anyone be there for him? 
His hunger grows…

1:49~1:51
The big cat, once again, is here with him. Worry and despair in her face. Looking ahead, a destroyed building. “Is it disorderly?”
“It is disorderly!” She screams.
He blinks, a mirror appearing before him.

1:51~1:54
“Do I understand?” Sandatsu asks
“I don’t understand.” Sandatsu answers

1:54~1:56
The mirror disappears to reveal a dead knight, his lifeless and mangled body laying at his feet. ”Is it real?
From the shadows, an ominous red blade thrust forward, piercing his chest. “It is real.” A malevolent voice speaks with disgust.

1:56~1:58
Looking at the sword in his chest, his  stomach clenches. “Am I alive?”
A beautiful white dove lands on his shoulder. “I am dead.” His stomach growls…

1:58~2:00
The sword stays lodged in his body, yet his heartbeats don’t stop— did his heart even beat? “Do I have a heart?”
Stepping out of the shadows, the demon reappears, holding the sword’s hilt. “You are a vessel.” IT takes out the sword.

2:00~2:04
Looking up, the blue sky is back, with many doves flying away, their many wings flapping, but making no sound. “You make me sick.”

2:04~2:08
Looking to his side, the big cat is with him, licking her paws. He points at the doves. “Can you delete it?”
The cat laughs. “I won’t delete it.”

“Am I being unreasonable?” He questions.
Big cat continued to lick her paws. “It is only fair.” He doesn't understand…

2:08~2:28
A body mirror appears before him, reflecting himself. In the mirror, a ghoulish Sandatsu stands, licking bloodstained claws. “Am I starving?”
The ghoul feasts on his friends’ corpses. “It is not enough.”

The visages fade to reveal another him with his organs out of his body. Deep sword cuts through the rest of his body. “Does it hurt?”
**”I received it***

“Was it just?” Another asks, just like him but smaller, less broken.
“I was evil.” A crack ran across the mirror.
A black void covers the mirror. His hunger is growing. “Is it normal?”
**It is abnormal.** The void answers. His heart races, making him step back. The mirror finally breaks, its darkness covering himself and everything.

The demon voices echoing in his head. “Is it wise?”
A voice just like his echoes from the darkness. “She is a fool.”

Looking to his side, the big cat was still there by his side. A claw grows on his left hand, the hunger growing out of control— “Will I allow it?”
Shaking his head, Sandatsu held his clawed hand. “I won’t allow it.”

The darkness starts to crack, once again revealing the blue sky past it. “Is it cursed?” The big cat asks, unbothered. 
“I am cursed.”

“Can’t it be seen?” The cat asks, pointing at the sky. Despite the blue sky shining bright past the darkness, Sandatsu closes his eyes. “It can’t be seen.”

2:28~3:11

Opening his eyes, there are many “him”. Many Sandatsus. The ghoul, the hurt, the past, and the darkness. Himself. Him. Many.

Looking up, the blue sky mis once again there, flying aimlessly. Soon he would awake, past this twisted reflect of reality
