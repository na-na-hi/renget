>My time away from Japan has given me a newfound appreciation for it
>Sure, my height's a bit less conspicuous in America
>And people are more likely to just say what they mean
>And I don't regret moving there
>But I'm still fond of my birth country
>It's where I grew up, after all
>I think it helps that I'm not a teenager anymore
>People aren't going to accuse an adult of being a juvenile delinquent
>Yeah, some Japanese people are still intimidated by or even afraid of me
>That's pretty much inevitable when you're a 180cm woman in a country where the average female height is about 165cm and the men aren't much taller
>But it doesn't bother me as much as it used to
>Partly because I don't get those reactions as often
>Partly because I feel so loved
>Partly because I know multiple people (even women!) in America who make me look short in comparison
>My husband is one of them
>He likes to tease me and say I fell for him because he was the first guy I met who was taller than me
>While that's not the only reason, I admit him making me feel small and cute for once was a big part of my initial attraction
>Not to mention the novelty of having to look up at his face
>I wonder how tall our kids will be
>They're already tall for their ages
>For all I know, they might end up taller than me, and even their father
>I guess it's nice to still be in touch with my homeland
>America is where I truly belong
>But I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for where I was born and raised
>And where I met the best man in the world
>I still look forward to our annual family visit
>Maybe we'll do something extra special this year
