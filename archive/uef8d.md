\> be anon
\> you're a third year anthropology student, currently stuck at the library on a lazy Friday afternoon
\> although it's the end of the semester and all your friends have went back home, your dick of a course coordinator gave you all one last assignment out of the blue and gleefully stated that it was terms, even though all of your exams are already over
\> so now you're wracking your brain trying to think of what to write
\> although it was about monster-human relations; something you would normally love to write about, you just can't seem to get past the first few sentences
\> your brain has decided to go on break as well apparently; all the articles read like hieroglyphs to you
\> fuck.tiff
\> you'd have even asked the mysterious velkhana librarian at the counter to lend you a hand in this case, but you didn't see a single soul when you entered the building
\> in fact, it was deathly quiet where you sat save for the occasional birdsong and the clickety-clack of your keyboard
\> which was a shame though, you loved seeing the venerable dragon and the way her glasses sat cutely on top of her snout
\> she seemed like the foxy type to you honestly, with the condescending and smug way she seemed to treat the other students
\> but damn if she didn't know about almost all the topics in this library
\> you even found that to be pretty hot, with her mastery of knowledge and her aura of superiority
\> but anyway, you digress
\> so far you're only a paragraph into the draft and you feel like you're completely spent
\> you continue flipping through articles on your laptop to no avail
\> although you pick out some weird noises from a couple bookshelves down, you paid it no mind
\> all these different studies and research papers look exactly the same
\> holy shit please just let me go home
\> before you know it you're mindlessly scrolling through a Yukumo bamboo planting forum
\> hell, now you're shitposting and feeling way more productive than whatever you were working on before
\> after being roasted hard, you sigh and decide to get back to work
\> you feel your gaze wandering again and realize how nice of a afternoon it was today
\> fml.png
\> you then suddenly pick out a muffled gasp and...
\> was that a moan?
\> wasn't this place empty?
\> some fucker must be watching some unsavory videos in here
\> lmao.jpeg
\> you've been sitting for a while anyway, should probably stretch for a bit and investigate
\> what could possibly go wrong, right?
\> you decide to get up from your chair and check out the weird noises
\> this should be way more entertaining than whatever you were doing anyway
\> you saunter over to the source, the carpeted floor muffling your movement
\> hiding behind a shelf, you peek over to find out what exactly was making that noise
\> ...
\> ...
\> holy shit
\> you didn't know what to expect, but this was definitely not what you expected to see
\> there was an IED on a table right in front of you
\> before you could even react, it fucking explodes
\> thatslife.mp3
\> you are immediately rendered unconscious as millions of pieces of shrapnel rip into your body like a hot knife through butter
\> although you are promptly rushed to the hospital and spend hours in the ER, the internal haemorrhage from your punctured organs is simply too much for your poor body to keep up with
\> you die
\>
\>

\> anyway, I want to kiss Nergigante!
