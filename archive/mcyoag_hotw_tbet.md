Such a name is hardly sufficient to describe this mutant neo-barbarian tribe of vampire-like cannibals whose mutated eyes glow through the razor sharp winds of the ice wastes. These exceptionally violent savages are barely human and prey on any entering their hunting territory, but they will recognize you as one of them if you are a cannibal with mutant eyes. Equipped with primitive melee and thrown weapons as well as bows, their strongest assets are their numerous mutant beasts, tamed thanks to the tribe’s founder animal magnetism and by giving them all of the non-human food they hunt. They’re also very small in numbers, so they survive by hiding in caves or under the snow and ambushing their food in blizzards. They probably won’t bother you if they deem you stronger than they’re hungry, but they’re more often than not very hungry. Useless members of the tribe, such as weak or non-mutant babies, injured males and barren women, used to be eaten but on the demand of the Crow, they let him train and experiment his bionic skills on them.

## Oll the tracker
Oll the tracker is the founding father and elder of the beast eyes tribe. Having been abandoned by his old tribe of pure-blooded humans due to his mutant eyes and freakishly pale complexion, he was taken in, raised and trained by a giant great horned owl, charmed by his innate use of his animal magnetism power. Growing up, the barbarian kid was often sickly, until his owl mom brought him human meat one day which he happily devoured, and as he was growing stronger, he started ambushing and feasting on the humans lost in the ice wastes. Social animals are rare in this frozen desert where there is little food to share between such large mutants, but Oll’s preference for human flesh and natural telepathic manipulation made him a good friend of the animals, and his group was soon strong enough to take on other barbarian tribes. He notably defeated his birth tribe, unknowingly as he was abandoned at birth, murdered and ate the men, raped all the women and kept them captive to make children (not his mother as she was executed long ago for giving birth to him). Among the newborns, he ate those that didn’t look like him, with special eyes and a vampiric skin. And thus, was created the beast eyes tribe.
15 years later, he hunted accompanied by his young but bloodthirsty barbarian sons and could take on bigger targets, such as Big Dig shipments. They rarely attack the ones leaving Big Dig as they are generally full of inedible stones, but those leaving the trading post sometimes contain interesting treasures. In one, he found a bio-weapon, a feathered serpent spear, with a massive sharp fang as its head. This spear rests by coiling around its user’s neck or arm, and slithers back to his hand and hardens when asked, it feeds on blood through its fang-head and can bleed an entire mega beast when it’s hungry. It produces a mind-altering venom making its victims more sensitive and less willing to resist telepathic powers, and slithers back to its master when thrown or lost. Oll’s animal magnetism allows him to control his spear through simple commands such as “harden”, “rest”, “venom” and “back”.
But a barbarian life is rarely long, and Oll would have died if not for his encounter with the Crow, a mutant genius, who replaced the barbarian damaged lungs with high-tech thermo-regulating water-proofed lungs equipped with a re-breather. This new pair of lungs not only gave a new youth to the frozen winds-battered man, but it enhance his stealth and ambushing skills, allowing him to lie in the snow for hours and even mask his heat presence by dangerously lowering his body temperature and recycling his air or breathing out cold air.
He is now too old to properly lead his tribe but he is still kicking and maintains a central role as the sole animal magnet of the tribe. He wishes to find a new one before passing away, to pass on his secrets and ensure a future to his tribe.

Physically, Oll is an old man, heavily damaged by the harsh nuclear winter, his ice-snow skin was reddened by the whipping winds and his once long black hair is now completely white, too. His strong facial features, smooth sagging skin, large sharp teeth and glowing mutant eyes give him the appearance of a corpse. He is obviously very tall and well-built, but less than other beasts and barbarians natives of the ice wastes, being the bastard son of a mutant foreigner and his barbarian mother. A wanderer lost in a blizzard would swear it had encountered a ghost or a lich, if he could even spot him first.

## Steg the vampserker
Both the son and grandson of Oll, Steg is a killing machine and the favorite son of the tribe, heavily mutated, confident and a lot more powerful and skilled than his brothers, he was destined for the head of the tribe since his birth. And now that his father became old and weak, he took the head. But because of his more severe version of his father’s allergy to non-human meat and the lack of big enough human preys, he tried eating the inedible ore they had looted, and enjoyed the reinforcing effect it had on his mutated skin, so he decided to raid Big Dig’s shipments more often, attracting a very much unwanted attention in his father’s opinion, but he doesn’t give a flying fuck. His gigantic war mammoth (tamed and gifted to him by his father) can ram and derail freight trains as if they were made of paper.
He got his mace in one of these raids, breaking apart a pre-war hydraulic press for its heavy cylinder made from a high-tech alloy capable of crushing anything else, which he then had soldered to a long and solid steel shaft. This weapon is too heavy even for barbarians, only strong mutants (muscular hypertrophy or brute strength + unusually large) can wield it in combat.
When the Crow joined the tribe after saving Oll, he started working on bionics for Steg, he made a thermo-regulating turbo heart capable of pumping a crazy blood flow to every organs and muscles but overheating so quickly than he had to poke holes around the barbarian’s body to let the hot blood spurt out, requiring a heavy intake of cold blood while using it, forcing the warrior to shower in the blood of his enemies while using it. It came with a primitive brain chip used to bypass most of the brain’s functions outside of the muscle and reflexes ones, protecting it while sending the user in a true berserk rage dedicated to brutally maul his foes. Steg only ever used it once and killed multiple good warriors of his tribe, his own brothers and uncles, as well as beast companions, making it a last resort trump card.

Steg is an enormous barbarian, with a thick white silver skin, a large head with a jaw wide enough to accommodate his array of jagged teeth with which he tears human flesh apart. He once had a full head of long black hair but it is now holed by the clunky brain apparatus. And his vampire-like red glowing eyes make him even more fearsome.

## The Crow
The Crow, a mutant orphan who grew up near the tech-mine, salvaging what a mutant kid could alone, tinkering and stealing to survive. He wasn’t that good at stealing and was soon forced by angry gangs to flee the city. He would have joined the Razorheads or one of the Tech-mine workgangs if he could, but they wouldn’t let a weak, ugly mutant like him join. So he fled North in the desert, traveling and surviving settlement to settlement, until he reached the University, where he failed the test miserably. Deemed a complete amateur, he was still offered a job as an intermediary, but the mutant kid had grown since the city (well, mentally at least), and he now had dreams. Dreams he believed could only be realized at the University. So he left, swearing to come back, more knowledgeable and worthy. He continued his journey in the North and eventually boarded a train to Big Dig which was attacked by the beast eyes barbarian tribe. They let him live thanks to his mutations and surgeon skills, installing a pair of high-tech lungs looted from the cargo to the wounded tribe patriarch, and he was even allowed to join the tribe. It was a first for the Crow, finding a place that accepted him despite his weakness and ugliness, a place he could call home. But he didn’t. He didn’t enjoy these people’s company, they were inbred barbarians, stupid, violent and their mutations only reflected the darkness of their heart. They were even worse than the hill folk. The Crow was different, he was rejected by humans, but didn’t hate them, he hated himself. He feared his own reflection, so he could understand the reaction of others. He stayed with the barbarians to train and learn, as they were surprisingly open-minded toward his craft and willingly offered many unwilling test subjects, but he kept his dream in a corner of his large brain. His dream of achieving a complete and beautiful machine body. He’d need high-tech equipment and assistants to do that, as he couldn’t operate on himself, this was the reason for his persistence towards the University.
The Crow isn’t equipped very well for combat, but has a symbiotic bio-pistol he bought during his travels, for self-defense. His main “weapon” is a pre-war scalpel with an extremely high fusion point that can be plugged and slowly heated to cut through anything. He doesn’t use it to fight but to cut anything hard (to perform surgery on thick skinned mutants) or prevent blood loss.

Looking at him, you would only see a kid disguised as a plague doctor wrapped under a long black cloak of crow feathers. A hat, tinted goggles and a mask covers his entire head, while his cloak, boots and gloves cover the rest. But under the cover, he’s an amalgamation of flesh and skin. His mouth is a circle of sharp teeth around a hole in a sort of elephant trunk, 20 cm long and wide. His eyes are fly-like multi-faceted globes extending out of his skull and glowing in the dark. His ears are tiny holes in the flesh, he has no nose. No hair neither and instead, a large translucent skull stretching his skin so much so that you can see his brain. His body is a bit less abnormal, with dwarf proportions and saggy like a very old man would be, but relatively normal. That is if you ignore his twin brother drooling on his chest, which he is almost as big as, and frenetically turning the handle of a dynamo, his only source of happiness. Sometimes, the Crow’s tentacle arm will sprout out of his twin’s mouth to do some work, as real estate is pretty expensive on this fun-sized guy, both mutations were forced to share the same spot.
