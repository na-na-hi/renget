### Evan Greene ♂
"This isn't what I had in mind..."
Evan was a man who you would pass on the street every day. Nothing special going on, boring job, the usual everyman. He was putting serious thought into Pokemon Training, but he seems to have been reborn before he could get started! Regardless, he's happy enough to not be pencil-pushing anymore.
