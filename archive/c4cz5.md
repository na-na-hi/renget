#Wintry Love (Sunny/Basil) Part 2

A heavy silence fell upon the room, now completely dark and abandoned even by the faint moonlight. The two boys who occupied it found themselves unable to utter any word or sound. 

Their minds were racing, filled to the brim with emotions they struggled to process akin to immense weights in their head. And yet, being romantically intertwined in each other’s arms like this definitely helped to soothe their nerves.

Finally, Basil rose from Sunny's naked, beautiful body, admiring the white mess he left on it as his eyes wandered to the boy's twitching hands, firm nipples, and especially… his excited member. 

Every little detail that the blondie noticed fed his unending lust. How could it not, after all? To have a person he always thought as perfect beneath him was still hard for him to believe. They could do anything they wanted, it was surreal.

However, it was a feeling the other boy shared: the shyness and anxiety slumbering deep within him was again replaced by a strong, carnal desire. It corresponded to a manic grin that formed on his face, which left Basil quite perplexed. 

What could it have meant, he wondered?

Sunny giggled and suddenly moved his hand towards the flower boy’s hair, tightly clutching his blond side bang and tugging it. He used it as a handle to shove Basil’s shocked face against his penis and force his entire length into his mouth, with its warm shaft coated in saliva. The smiling boy was overtaken by another bolt of immense pleasure, parallel to the blonde boy's sheer confusion and whatever else laid in his scrambled brain.

Basil removed his lips from Sunny’s leaking penis, panting and holding back a gag. His distressed eyes moved upwards to look at the other boy who, after having returned to his senses, admittedly felt quite bad; pulling and shoving his dear friend around as he just did was just not his thing.

Yet, when Basil noticed that hint of sorrow creeping into the other boy's otherwise ecstatic eyes, he understood what was happening all too well. Watching him try to establish dominance was just… adorable. If futile. 

Basil's new, lustful gaze met Sunny's increasingly nervous one. Breaking the quiet, he muttered:

"W-What are you doing, Sunny? O-Oh, you thought YOU were going to top?" 

His soft words quickly dissipated, making way for a small chuckle that evaded his lips. Sunny’s cheeks were washed by a deep tomato red color, the embarrassed expression on his cute face represented his thoughts perfectly. 

“B-Basil… W-Wait…!” the boy whispered. Unfortunately, his shaky words were interrupted when the blonde boy abruptly grabbed his leg and raised it above his own shoulder, too far gone in his own desires to heed Sunny’s ranting. 

And… Well, there it was. Sunny’s sweating, pulsating hole, free for Basil to admire and stretch with his free hand. It was so beautiful, so inviting, all for him to take. Blood rushed to the flower boy's cheeks, staining them crimson. He'd been waiting for something like this for so long, and he wasn't going to stand there and simply praise it with his eyes. He'd praise it with something much different. 

His body trembled as the nervousness settled in. It was his first time, after all. Yet he felt that, as long as he had Sunny by his side, he could do anything. 

Basil rocked his hips against Sunny's own, thrusting deep into his hole and prompting an intense moan from the submissive boy. The tight and warm environment that the blondie's penis found itself in made him softly mewl in pleasure too, as he kept pushing, seemingly without end. 

However, the whimpers of enjoyment Sunny made had a tinge of pain that only amplified with each one of the blondie’s rhythmic thrusts. And once Basil noticed the agony he was putting his friend through, his smug, brave façade immediately shattered and rather made way for all-too-familiar embarrassment, shyness and self-hatred. For what awful, awful person would hurt their beloved friend… and feel good doing it?

His mouth agape and his eyes wide, the flower boy pulled out and hurriedly pressed his body against Sunny’s own, their faces inching close together. He took the bewildered boy’s hand into his own and cupped his cheek with his palm.

“S-Sunny!! S-Sunny, I’m s-so sorry! D-Did I hurt you?! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” the boy pleaded, tears welling up in his eyes, though Sunny failed to understand what was happening. It didn’t even hurt that much, so why, in the blink of an eye, would the dominant boy above him revert to his stumbling, miserable self? A face that he hated so much, one that he never wanted Basil to wear anymore?

Nevertheless, it felt comforting. It was the last bit of confirmation he needed: Basil truly, truly loved him, more than he could imagine. And the fact that he'd throw his confidence aside for him? It brought him to tears. Happy tears, unlike Basil's. 

"I-I'm fine, B-Basil… P-Please, keep… keep going…" Sunny reassured the boy, who shakingly replied:

"A-Are you sure? W-What if I hurt you again?" 

"N-No, really… I-I'm fine. I'm okay. P-Please, do that again… Please…" he continued.

Even Basil could see how lustful and desperate Sunny was, so much so it replaced the pain he bore. So, as he felt his courage returning, he breathed:

"A-Alright…!"

Basil planted a kiss on the dark-haired boy's cheek and returned his eyes to his alluring hole. The two boys looked each other in the eyes again, almost losing themselves within them, and nodded. 

Then, like a hasty whirlwind, the bouts of pleasure returned. The flower boy's shoving milked more moans and whimpers from the two. And just as his penis met Sunny's entrance, so too did the boys' tongues intertwine, sharing a loving kiss that muffled out their noises.

Hearing the quiet boy whisper Basil's name after each thrust only served to arouse him even more, and by now he was intent on finding Sunny's pleasure spot. With each push into the other boy's insides, the blondie searched for that point which would give his friend the most satisfaction possible.

Suddenly, Sunny released another moan. One that, unlike the others, was loud, brash and animalistic. Finally, Basil found it. And to this revelation, he couldn't help but grow a pompous smile on his face, knowing what was about to come. His hand gravitated towards Sunny's own and held it tight to make sure his friend wouldn't feel any pain again.

With incredible stamina, Basil began drilling into that spot with his penis, in and out, in and out. Sunny's face was swathed in such a deep blush he was certain his cheeks were going to burst. All those lewd emotions he felt were finally unleashed while his deafening, adorable moans overwhelmed the quietness of the room. 

Still, no matter how deeply the couple wished for this affectionate session to never end, eventually, it had to, as Sunny noticed. For something within his body was bubbling up, a certain pressure that tingled his member and begged to be let out like a roaring flame. His legs trembled and his breath drew shorter. He was close to releasing his chained love all over the blondie beside him, just like the boy did to him before.

“B-Basil…! B-Basil, I-I’m about to… I-I’m…” the crackling sounds barely escaped his lips, but immediately they were drowned out by another kiss from the blondie’s mouth. As their tongues parted, their glares met again and here, Sunny realized: Basil did not give care to his friend's frivolous words. He was nowhere near finished.

The blondie's hand firmly wrapped around Sunny's tip, cruelly denying the boy's much-needed release. The other boy winced and his hole tightened, his distressed head was instantly filled by white noise only partly interrupted by a quiet, distant "Not yet!" from his friend. Needless to say, the tears on his face were not of happiness anymore.

He was taken out of his trance when he felt his insides being penetrated again, drawing more charming sounds from his lips. But after his pleasure was so brashly contained, it didn't take long for his dick to feel like a dam close to bursting. The continuous edging was about to break his mind.

"B-Basil… A-Aahh, B-Basil… P-Please, let me… L-Let me cum…" he pleaded, however thinking it to be an idiotic approach. Instead, the flower boy let out a sound followed by a nod: he himself was close to climaxing too. He wanted the two to release their pressure together.

His grip around the other boy's member loosened and the couple breathed out a loud, crazed moan containing all of their pent up strain, thrill, love. And when they released said love onto each other, with Basil's warmly coating Sunny's insides and leaking from his hole, it was like all of their lust and energy had immediately been drained.

His dominance forgotten, Basil fell onto the sperm-coated boy beneath him and tightly wrapped his bare arms around him. There they laid, looking at each other not with the fervor they were engrossed in before, but with affection. No longer as dominant or submissive, but as two lovers with their bare bodies entwined. 

"B-Basil… T-That felt…" Sunny murmured, breaking the silence. The flower boy's index finger passed over his friend's lips, and he replied:

"...I know."

And as the two were about to doze off, Basil realized just how much Sunny meant to him. How much he valued moments like these. 

Basil wouldn't trade him for anything in the world. 

After all, his beautiful world was already here. Beneath him, on the bed.
