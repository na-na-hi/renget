A BIG Cutie! by writer number six

>i thought I'd never find a boyfriend, bars are shity, i like a few people in my college classes but there isn't a lot of room for socializing during lectures, not only that, but the people i like aren't the type for parties, i know, I've checked.
>like all lone shut-ins, i was cuddling with my pillow every night and lonely. i found solace in a table top rpg discord,where i met him
>he was a cute little femboy, Denis. he lived in the same city as me so it was an easy decision to start dating. we had plenty in common, we played the same video games, listened to the same music. we definitely had chemistry, we didn't play the same rpg's, i played dnd and he played warhammer but i didn't mind.
>he was a black bear, i found out from the pictures he sent me, short, a little chubby, and thicc. he didn't send any explicit nudity, neither did i, but he sure liked yoga pants, that's for sure. i loved seeing his curves, that almost black fur, just a shade lighter than the ebony it should be. does he not get enough vitamins? he always took photos from top angles, and he didn't have furniture? there was never any in his photos. that didn't really matter, i had a sweet spot for his ways of speaking, or typing rather, sure some think the owo 's and such are annoying but i found them cute.
>our first date was scheduled for a week after we first met, i know that sounds sudden, but we really hit it off trust me! i got to the place early, a cafe near both of us. coffee dates are low pressure so i thought it might be a good place. he sent me a pic of him in the outfit he'd be wearing, a knee length pink skirt, with a cute pink bow, and a pink crop top with something anime on it, he even had pink on shoes, a pink jacket, and even pink accessories! he was committed to this look and i was really digging it for him. 
>i wasn't watching the door but i knew he knew what i looked like so there would be no problems with him finding me. i was sipping on my drink when the door jingled like it had for the past few minutes, customers coming i and out, but then the sound in the cafe sort of dampered, i turned to look at the cause and i saw Denis.
>he had to be at least 7 feet tall he was almost touching the ceiling, this MASSIVE femboy was walking towards me, his face looked a bit uncomfortable, the sudden attention on him, the fact i had a look of surprise on my face. luckily both stopped after he sat down.
>"hey..." he said "i'm really sorry for not telling you i was taller." he looked down at the table
>i replied "oh, i don't mind, really, Denis, sorry for the stares, it was a little unexpected that's all." i stayed casual, this wasn't a deal breaker for me.
>he perked up "oh! really? usually people are put off by size, they expect someone who acts like me, and dresses like... this," he gestured to himself, "to be, smaller?"
>"oh i get that," i said, "you don't have to be bothered around me though" i though for a second.
>"you don't have to answer this but, do you know why you're so tall?"
>he wasn't bothered by this question, we settled into our usual style of conversation, casual, and fun, with a bit of flirting.
>"well my grandpa was a polar bear, and i guess the tall genes skipped a generation, so i'm quite big."
>"big huh?" i smirked at him.
>"not like that! er, not, not like that!" he was so cute when he was flustered.
>"but," he lowered his tone a bit "i'm not a... 'pitcher' per se, so, it's not a very useful organ I'm afraid, if that's what you're after..."
>i laughed "no, it's fine, I'm just messing with you, but... that's good to know." i sipped my coffee while giving him bedroom eyes. 
>"ugh, if i knew you'd be this irresistible I'd have us meet at my apartment instead of here" he winked a gave a cute smile before getting up to order his coffee, while i sat, a little shocked. so he's got game too huh? he didn't usually flirt when we were talking over discord. no one beats me at flirting. i knew i had to beat him somehow.
>when he got back i laid my hand on his, covered in a fingerless glove, (could you guess what color it was?) he seemed to be the only person i liked them on.
>i slapped a heaping pound of sultry into my voice, stroking his hand. "hey, i was thinking about what you said, and i was wondering if we could go back to your place?"
>"u-uhhmm" he gulped "yeah, sure." he was already flustered again, please tell that little thing before wasn't all that you had?
>"not for any particular reason i assume?" he asked
>"nothing you haven't done before." i gave a vague answer, wanting to keep him on his toes
>"well um, um yes! let's go then, shall we?"
>we picked up our drinks and i walked next to him, i went back to small talk but i could tell he was a little sheepish, being that he was expecting for me to seduce him by what i could gather. we ended up taking the subway to his part of town, he lived farther away from the colleges, "because of all the noise". i leaned against him on the ride, he was shy about it at first but he seemed really content after a second or two.
>we arrived at his apartment, it sorta looked like a 92 year old grandma and a teenage emo girl, and neckbeard lived here, the chintz couch with band pillows. the nice table cloth, on top sat quartz skulls and anime figures, and miniatures. 
>"so..." Denis said, "what do you want to do?"
>it was only around 11 by the time we got here, i couldn't hold the act up for much longer, otherwise we'd just escalate until we had sex, i wasn't interested in just a quick hookup with him anyway.
>"why don't we... watch a movie and snuggle? if you'd be ok with that"
>he seemed confused, but relived "wait, so you don't want to...?"
>"no, sorry, you're just really cute when you're flustered" i gave him a shit eating grin
>he looked slightly incredulous, but was mostly, well, flustered, maybe embarrassed better describes it
>"what are you talking about fluste-?! i am not- i-!"
>all i could do was laugh.
>eventually, after discussing the best cuddle position,he ended up laying on the couch, sitting upright, i sat in his lap, laying against his stomach.
>i reached up, toutching his face "you know, Denis- oh wow you fur is so soft!"
>"is this one of those things where you try to get me all hot in the face? cause it's not gonna work this time."
>"no no, really it's so soft" i felt his belly fur, "oh! here too!"
>he had a good reaction to this, he didn't stop me, and giggled at my "human fascination with fur" i slid down to a laying position, resting my head on his stomach, he was like one big pillow. i couldn't help myself from falling asleep during the movie, not like it mattered, it was some nothing b movie.
>when i woke up, it seemed he had fallen asleep as well. what's more, i was wrapped in his grasp being held against him, i was kinda sweaty from being so close to his warm body.
>he felt my movements and woke up too.
>"hey, I'm glad you slept well." there was no sense of condescending or irritation in his voice.
>i sucked air through my teeth, still guilty "sorry man, i guess it was pretty rude to fall asleep on you..."
>"no, it's fine," he said "i dont mind, plus it was nice to do this with you, if there's nothing else you want to do, then... i guess you could go home"
>"well, actually, you said you play Warhammer? i was wondering if you could tell me more?" i asked
>he beamed, and he spent the rest of the afternoon explaining lore and showing me his miniatures, we watched more tv and actually paid attention, ordered food, having not eaten at all that day, and generally nerded out the rest of the day.
>around 6 when it was starting to be night time,i went home feeling more in love than i think i ever have been before, we scheduled another date two weeks from our first, i talked with him almost every day until the day actually came, our messages got more sexual after our date. i couldn't wait at all for our next date to come.

>so by now it was only a day before out next date, and i had become fully aquatinted with his ass, he wasn't lying about his dick either, i knew I had to pound him the next time i saw him, which was good considering our next date was tomorrow, at his place. now i get that people say that you're supposed to wait for the third date before engaging in Tummy Tetris, but i think me and him were too pent up for that.
>it wasn't just sex either, we could listen to each other, i was less of a feelings guy than him but i was happy to help him out, I'd call him every night before bed, and talk about our day, uni, work, nerd shit, etc. i had gotten his phone number after our first date, followed him on a few socials, and had fallen in love with him over the weeks between our date.
>he had wanted to have some fun over video, but i insisted on waiting till we were in person. 
>you couldn't tell from the outside that i was so ecstatic, i was still the socially awkward dude who kept to himself but less so, i made a few friends that i talked to outside of uni sometimes, so that was a plus.
>i woke up early on Saturday, our date was at noon, but i decided to wake up at six becaus i was so stressed i had to get everything perfect, i showered, twice with different smelling shampoos, combed my hair in 3 different styles before going with the first one, stared at my closet naked for at least an hour to find the best outfit, and practiced what i was going to say when he opened the door.
>"h-hey gorgeous, how's it going?... no that's stupid."
>i looked at the clock. it was 11, shit! i hadn't eaten, so i decided to quickly make a sandwich and book it to the subway, still nervous about this.
>but why? god, it was so comfortable the first time, why am I nervous now? shit, i just don't hope i ruin it with my anxious bullshit.
>i got there at 12:02 knocked on the door, and panicked, thinking he would be mad at me being so late, and not having flowers, and not having my hair right, and...
>happened the door and i saw him, blue cropped turtle neck, with matching earrings and a black ankle length skirt. i was also wearing blue funnily enough, opting for a open button up over a white shirt.
>i paused
>"u-uh- hey gor-"
>the threw me into a big hug and lifted me up, damn how is he so strong? i melted into his hug, i missed him so much, and my nerves were immediately calmed.
>"hey!" he said, putting me down, "ive been waiting for this all week!"
>"me too!"
>we kept talking as we got on the couch, and got into a good cuddling position, our arms around each other. i could feel the tension, he was waiting for me to do it, to make the first move, i ran my hand down his side to his butt, under his skirt.
>"ooh, i see what you want" he said to me.
>he began to rub my dick through my pants
>he didn't have any underwear on, and i could see from the rise in the fabric of his skirt he was wanting this too. i reached out and grabbed it with my free hand, he jolted
>"ahh" he let out a little yelp of excitement
>"wow, sensitive are we? how about you put your hands on the real thing instead of through my jeans?"
>he complied, getting on his knees unbuttoning my pants and pulling out my cock, he looked at it, having finally seen it in person, with the most intense fascination i have ever seen on him since, the he devoured it, letting every millimeter on my shaft get covered in his saliva. his tongue was rubbing the bottom of my dick, and the roof of his mouth was on top he was hitting all the right spots, stumbling here and there, having, getting teeth a little to close, not a pro but I'd be hard pressed to say i wasn't loosing it.
>i pushed his head back "holy shit..." i took deep breaths, "your turn..."
>we went to his bedroom, i spread his cheeks and rimmed him, slobbering all over his hole, sticking my tongue in and coating the inside with sticky slippery spit, only stopping for air. he was so cute letting out those high pitched moans and squeaks, i'd think i was eating out a mouse or rabbit. he'd main my name and beg for more when I stopped to breath.
>when he was slick enough i gave his ass cheek a firm slap, he let out a "yip!" i ran my fingers through his fur before sticking it in, laying in him, cuddling as i pounded his hole, i breathed on his back as he screamed with pleasure, i didn't stop as i came, the plaps turning into wet slaps as the cum seeped out from me painting his guts.
>exhausted, i fell asleep on him again, on purpose this time, I'd wake up in 30 minutes or so and do it again, but for now i enjoyed sleeping on my new femboy boyfreind.
