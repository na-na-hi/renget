##### `Along for the Hunt`
>"You know what? I am."
>The normally stoic huntress can't hide her surprise. She really didn't expect that answer. You both know you're no good in the woods. The question was really meant as a soft jibe, a joke really. And here you are completetly upsetting that idea.
>You're no good in the woods. You do your absolute best, and all that really amounts to is being just stealthy enough to not spook anything closer than 100 yards.
>You take to following her at a point where you can barely keep track of her. But just watching her lets you learn some things.
>You're no good in the woods. But no one else ever says yes. She's too pretty, too good, too intimidating.
>You go again and again. You learn. You get better.
>You get good in the woods.
>Not for the pack, not even for yourself. You do it for her, and the children you're going to have.
>You make your first kill with her.
>You make your first solo kill.
>Her body is just as firm as you imagined it would be under your fingers. And yet it's soft too, pliant.
>Neither is taking the lead under the blankets, it's two bodies making love, happy to make the other happy and feel good.
>Your face nearly splits itself with the grin when you realize the howling isn't in your head and the rest of the pack knows exactly what the two of you are doing.
>Yes, you'll join her on the hunt.
