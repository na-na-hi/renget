####Chapter 1: Flightless

Ever since awakening in this world of civilized Pokemon, I had been bothered by several unanswered questions.

Why did I transform from a human into a tiny Ribombee? Why did so many other humans also turn into various Pokemon and appear here, around Capim Town? Was there any way for us to return to Earth? Why couldn’t I use any Pokemon moves?

But the most painful question was this: why was I still flightless?

Although I had a fear of heights to some extent, I’d always wanted to fly. Now that I had a new body with a pair of lovely gossamer wings, it should have been a dream come true. But the universe seemed determined to taunt me, because I was completely unable to use my wings for their intended purpose. In fact, I could hardly control them at all. When I did force them to move through sheer willpower, I could only manage a faint twitch or flutter, pitiful and weak.

Weak. I hated feeling weak. I was sick of being unable to get around on my own. I was sick of people staring as I rode on my partner Sneasel’s head instead of flying. I was sick of strangers asking if my wings were broken. I was sick of being useless.

Even so, I was unable to deal with it right away, since an avalanche of other things had stolen my attention shortly after my arrival in the new world. I had to spend a week or two getting situated and adjusting to my new life, during which I met my fellow transformed humans. We formed a group called the Clover Guild, then worked together to set up a guildhall where we and our new native Pokemon friends could live and work together. It certainly felt good to have guildmates, but being timid, I never wanted to bother them and ask them for help with my wings. It was a problem I preferred to handle myself.

As I settled into the guild, and my desire to fly refused to die down, I finally began experimenting with my wings during my spare time. The process was arduous. It felt like there was some sort of barrier in my mind that blocked me from sensing and accessing the muscles in my new body. My wings seemed as though they were paralyzed, and moving them even the slightest amount required immense effort and focus. Despite my dream of flying, it was difficult to stay motivated under the weight of so much failure. By the end of the first month, my enthusiasm was struggling to stay afloat. I could barely work up the energy or the motivation to keep trying. The days where I practiced soon became outnumbered by the days where I didn’t bother at all.

One morning, after eating a quick breakfast, I forced myself to go through the usual motions on the desk in my guildhall dorm. I shared the room with Sneasel, but she had left to help Guildmaster Lliam with a small task. So much the better; I hated the idea of anyone seeing my struggles, even my partner.

As I always did, I concentrated on my wings and did my best to move them around. I visualized them fluttering effortlessly and smoothly. Nothing happened. I looked down at my body and tried to feel where my rearranged muscles were. I could feel nothing. I told my wings to move, begged them, ordered them, yelled at them. They refused to move.

It was the same old song and dance, but for some reason, this was the day where my frustration finally reached the boiling point. I stomped and screamed in rage. I jumped all around the desk, desperately flapping my arms along with my wings. I knew it wouldn’t work. I knew I was making a fool of myself. But after all this time, I was willing to try anything. And I thought nobody was watching me.

I sensed a presence. I froze, then spun to face the doorway. The door was now open, and Sneasel was standing there, holding back laughter.

My new insect body didn’t allow me to blush. But if I was physically able to do so, my face surely would have turned beet red by now. I stood there, weak in the knees, as my partner walked into the room with a big smirk on her face. I couldn’t look her in the eye. She sat on the floor cushion in front of the desk and leaned forward, resting her elbows on the edge.

“Still at it, huh, partner?” she asked. “I don’t think flailing your arms around like a crazy guy is gonna do anything, though.”

“I know!” I screamed. Both of us were surprised at my uncharacteristic outburst. But I kept going: “I hate it! I hate this so much! Why is this happening? Why can’t I figure this out? ...W-what’s wrong with me?”

My voice cracked and faltered. I fell to my knees and hung my head, crushed under a mountain of self-pity. Nothing I did was working. My wings would stay broken forever. I was a failure.

Suddenly, something gently brushed the top of my head. I flinched. It felt nice, although my antennae tingled as they were flattened down. I looked up again. Sneasel was giving me a reassuring pat on the head. Her smirk had vanished completely, replaced by a serious stare.

“Nothing’s wrong with you, Booker,” she said softly. “Nothing. You’re a human, and humans can’t fly, right? So you never learned how to use wings, and you ain’t got instincts for it. It makes sense you can’t fly. Now, if you figured it out right way, then I’d call you weird. But if it’s hard for you, that’s okay.”

I reached up and lay a hand on Sneasel’s claws. “Thanks,” I said. “That makes me feel better... kind of.”

As Sneasel moved her hand off my head, I looked back at my wings and tensed up my body, grunting in frustration. My wings feebly fluttered in response. I muttered, “I just... can’t wrap my head around how to use these things. And if I can’t figure it out, they’re useless.”

“Not really,” Sneasel said. “You can use them to float down from high spots, right?”

“Yeah. I can do that, but...”

“Exactly. See? And floating is just one step away from flying. Doesn’t sound so bad when you think of it like that, huh? I’m sure you’ll figure this out somehow. I mean, you’re not gonna give up, are you? Back in the forest, back when we met, you promised me you’d get stronger. And I’m gonna hold you to it, partner.”

“You’re right,” I said. Sneasel and I originally bonded because of our shared desire to get stronger, and she had always kept me motivated. Today was no different. I buried my anxiety and stood up.

“You’re right,” I said again. “I’ll find some way to fix this. I won’t be flightless forever. Or, at least, I hope not. But obviously, trying to do this on my own isn’t working. I need to find someone who can help.”

“Don’t look at me,” Sneasel said. “I don’t know anything about flying.”

“I know. We’ll need to find a flying Pokemon. I hate to bother other people and ask for help, but I don’t think I have any other option.”

I paused and thought about my guildmates, and the Pokemon affiliated with the guild. “Let’s see... flying Pokemon... there’s a Vibrava who showed up at the guildhall before, but I only saw him once or twice, and I don’t know anything about him. And there’s the Noivern, Bullet. He’s not a guild member, but I think he could help me if we could find him. Do you know where he lives, or where he is right now?”

“Nope,” said Sneasel. “We could ask around and track him down, but he’s probably out on a mission with his girlfriend, as usual.”

“The Indeedee? She’s not his girlfriend—according to Bullet, anyway. But that’s beside the point. Any other flyers you can think of?”

“How about we talk to Archie? She’s a guildmate, and she lives just at the edge of town. We can swing by and see if she can help.”

“Archie the Archeops? Uh... I don’t want to sound rude... but she’s not a good flyer. Not her fault, though—her species just can’t fly well. So I don’t think I’d be able to learn much from her. It would be better to talk to a skilled flyer.”

“Good point. But we ain’t got any in the guild. I guess we can hit the town and look for someone there. There’s plenty of flying Pokemon in town. And I’ve been here longer than you, so I can probably give you some ideas about who’s best to ask.”

A certain Pokemon popped up in my mind. “Actually,” I said, “now that you mention it, I have one idea. Let’s head out into town.”

Sneasel nodded, then hunched down and rested her chin on the edge of the desk, letting me clamber up her face and sit at my usual spot atop her head. 

“Who’d you have in mind?” she asked.

I hesitated. My idea seemed good to me, but I had a feeling Sneasel would dislike it. “I’ll... tell you when we get going,” I said.

I felt Sneasel shift as she shrugged. “Alright, fine,” she said. “Guess it’ll be a surprise.”

She stood up and went for the door, but I tapped her head to stop her. “Sneasel,” I said, “thanks for helping me. And thanks for the kind words earlier, too. It means a lot to me. This flying problem is really tough, so... I’m glad you’re with me.”

“Don’t mention it,” she replied. “I’m sick of watching you get all depressed cuz of your wings. I can’t stand seeing you like that. So helping you’s gonna be good for us both.”

That made me smile as Sneasel left our dorm and brought me out into Capim Town—and hopefully, closer to flight.

####Chapter 2: Airborne

The morning sun was shining brightly over Capim Town, and high-altitude clouds were drifting in the wind. Down near the ground, things were only a little breezy. My wings and scarf of setae softly rustled as Sneasel carried me out of the guildhall.

“So, you’re gonna tell me where we’re going, right?” she asked me.

I gulped. My partner disliked the individual I had in mind, but this was the first Pokemon I thought of when I thought about friendly flyers. “Guess I might as well get it out of the way,” I said. “We’re gonna see Taillow.”

Sneasel’s exasperated groan probably could have been heard on the other side of town.

“Not her again,” Sneasel moaned. “She’s so annoying.”

“Do you have a better idea?” I asked. “We need someone who’s not only able to fly, but actually willing to teach me. Sure, Taillow’s loud and excitable, but she’s also really friendly. Plus, we helped her once before. So I think she’ll be okay with helping me.”

“Well, as long as I don’t have to deal with her, I guess it’s fine. I’ll drop you off with her and then... go do literally anything else. If she does anything stupid with you, holler for me.”

“Sure. Do you know where she lives?”

Sneasel’s ear flicked right beside me, making me flinch. “No, but... I hear her singing.”

I heard nothing, but I trusted my partner’s sensitive hearing. We made our way across town. We only stopped once, when we passed the town bulletin board by the Blue Claw Inn. I made Sneasel pause so I could look closer. One of the papers pinned to it had caught my eye.

“See that one?” I asked. “The writing’s all… shimmery. Like they used a special ink for it. What’s it say?”

Sneasel took one look at it and grumbled, “Oh. That’s an ad for the ‘Room of Awakening’. I went there once. I hated it.”

“Really? Why? And what is it, anyway?”

“New move tutor,” Sneasel said as she continued walking through Capim. “Just showed up a week ago. It didn’t work for me, and the Oranguru in charge is a weirdo.”

I didn’t pay much mind to whatever Sneasel said after ‘move tutor’, because my mind was quickly filled with images of me training and learning moves. After my flightlessness, my biggest grievance in this new world was my inability to use any moves or attacks. An actual move tutor seemed like a perfect solution.

“Move Tutor...” I murmured. “I wonder if he can teach me.”

“Dunno. We can talk about that later. But for now, let’s find that dumb bird friend of yours and get this over with.”

We soon climbed to Upper Capim, comprised of the flat tops of titanic ancient tree stumps, all linked by rope bridges. This part of town served as a way to get around more quickly than the winding paths at ground level. Various businesses and market stalls had sprung up here over the years, along with a great many gardens and miniature parks taking advantage of the sunlight up here. There were also plenty of trapdoors and stairwells descending into the hollowed-out stumps.

Sneasel followed the sound of singing across town, passing by some townsfolk and even a few of our guildmates. I soon started to hear the music too. It came from one stump near the edge of town, where there were a couple empty stalls and some crates piled up. There were no Pokemon around except for a singing Taillow atop the biggest pile of crates, which was almost twice as tall as Sneasel. The bird’s song was beautiful, but loud. I could sense the frustration emanating from my partner.

“Hey, chatterbox!” Sneasel shouted as she approached.

Taillow immediately stopped singing and looked down. “Sneasel!” she shouted. “Oh, and Booker too! Hi there! Great to see you guys! How’ve you been? Heard you made a guild! That’s so cool! I wish I was in a guild! Hey, checked out any cool dungeons? I still remember when we went to Waterfall Cave and the Echo Chamber—that was so fun! Thanks again for taking that job, by the way! I really—”

“Booker needs your help!” Sneasel shouted.

“He does?” asked Taillow. “Yay! I get to help someone! What do you need, friend?”

“I’ll let him tell you,” Sneasel said. She nimbly climbed partway up the pile and let me hop off her head onto the summit. I landed in front of Taillow as Sneasel dropped down and said, “I’ll be checking out the market over there. Call me if you need anything.”

She left at a quick pace. Meanwhile, Taillow was bouncing up and down, eager to hear what I had to say. Nervousness overtook me now that I was away from my partner and being scrutinized by an overly excited bird who was twice my size. Still, I managed to speak despite my tight throat and quickening heartbeat.

“Um, I... I was h-hoping you could help me... y’know, fly.”

Taillow gasped. “Really? You can’t fly? I didn’t know that! Actually, now that you mention it, I never saw you fly back in the Echo Chamber job. I thought you were just giving your wings a break or something. I didn’t know you were flightless! Aww, that’s so sad! I’m sorry! Why can’t you fly?”

“I just... never learned how. I’ve been trying to learn, but I need help.”

I decided to leave it at that, hoping she wouldn’t press me. I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because I was a human—that was a secret only known to my guildmates, since most of them were also humans. Luckily, Taillow was so eager to please, she didn’t care about the explanation.

“Well, you came to the right bird!” she exclaimed. “If you wanna learn to fly, I bet there’s no one else who knows more about it than me! I love flying! Wait, did I tell you that already? I feel like I did, last time we met. Anyway—I love flying, and I’d love to teach you all about it! I mean, you and Sneasel really helped me out earlier. I’ve been spending lots of time in the Echo Chamber singing, since you helped me clear it out. So helping you is the least I can do!”

As if to release her nonstop buildup of excitement, Taillow spread her wings and launched up into the air. I flinched as a strong wind from her wings blasted me, nearly knocking me off the crate pile. When I regained my footing, I watched her do a variety of stunts in the air. She spun and looped and dove around. I was equal parts impressed and jealous. Before long, she swooped down and landed softly in front of me.

“Alrighty, guess we’ll start with the basics,” she said. She extended one wing out to her side. “Okay, so! This is a wing. We flyers use this to fly.”

I blinked. “I... I knew that,” I said.

Taillow’s eyes went wide. “Wow, you’re a natural! You already know so much!”

I chose to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was just being an airhead, and not patronizing me. “Okay, well, how do you use your wings?” I asked. I tried moving mine back and forth, with no success. “I can barely move these things, let alone generate lift. How does a bird do it?”

“Lemme think,” said Taillow. “It’s kinda like instinct for me now, so I don’t even think about how I fly anymore. Lemme play around a bit and see if I can figure out how to describe it to a newbie.”

She leaned forward, shut her eyes, and flapped her wings, though not enough to take off. Then she repeated the motion over and over, sometimes slowing it down or speeding it up. I took a few steps back, braced myself against the breeze, and watched intently. I’d never seen a bird flap its wings so close—or in so much detail, considering how big this one was compared to me. I watched her for a minute in silence, until she finally spoke up.

“I guess it’s kinda like this,” she said at last, continuing to work her wings. “I don’t move my wings straight up and down. I kinda twist them with each downstroke so I can push some air back. Then I tuck them in a bit on the upstroke, so there’s less air resistance. And I’m not just moving my wings from the shoulder. I use my chest. Kinda like when you sing, you sing from the diaphragm, not the throat, right? Well, actually, we birds do sing from the throat, cuz we don’t have diaphragms. But I heard other Pokemon talk about how it’s important to sing from the diaphragm.”

“I’ve heard that too,” I said.

Taillow nodded and spread her wings wide. “Anyway, point is, you may think you’ve gotta move your wings at the base of the wing, but there’s more to it than that. You’ve gotta use your flight muscles. Me, I’ve got muscles all the way from the wings to my chest, so I actually use my chest to fly. Wanna feel it?”

After a brief bit of hesitation, I moved forward and awkwardly reached up to bury a hand in her fluffy chest feathers. She moved her wings, and I was surprised to feel powerful muscles working there.

“You’re right,” I said. “I wonder if I’ve got the same thing.”

I touched my own chest and made another attempt to move my wings. I grunted with the effort, and after half a minute of straining, I barely managed to make them twitch. When they moved, I felt something faintly shifting under my hand, as if I was holding my bicep and slightly flexing it. It was nowhere near as noticeable as Taillow’s flight muscles, but there was certainly something there, something different from anything I had as a human.

“Feel anything?” the bird asked.

“There’s something going on here,” I said. “Interesting. Next time I practice, I need to figure out some way to... access these muscles, so to speak, and make them move. I bet that’ll let me move my wings better. Of course, then I still need to move them fast enough to take off. But being able to control them at all will be a step in the right direction.”

“Great! Glad I could teach you something!”

“Yeah, thanks, Taillow. But there’s another problem. The kind of stuff you were talking about, with tilting your wings and tucking them in... I think it only works with birds. You have a lot of control over your wings, since you have bones and muscles in them. But I can’t do that with my wings. Bug wings are different.”

“Oh, right. Guess we shoulda thought about that, huh? Sorry.”

“No, no, it’s okay. I think watching you gave me some ideas. And the thing about the flight muscles was interesting. So, I learned some stuff. Thanks again.”

Taillow chirped and hopped up and down. “Yay! You’re welcome!”

At my encouragement, she continued moving her wings around, and told me more about how each motion felt. Even though our anatomy was different, I hoped that some of the information she told me could make something click in my head. I tried moving my wings too, while doing my best to concentrate on controlling my flight muscles. I couldn’t sense them unless I held my hand on my chest, though, as if my brain didn’t realize I had new muscles there. Somehow, I would need to relearn my own anatomy and musculature.

Taillow spent some more time telling me about flying. She taught me about headwinds, tailwinds, updrafts, and downdrafts. She gave me tips for taking off and landing, and also how to conserve energy by gliding. She talked about how she could sense the wind with her feathers, and how my fur-like setae could probably do the same thing. I listened to her prattle on—she really was a chatterbox, especially when she got started on a topic she cared about. But I wasn’t the least bit annoyed. If anything, her enthusiasm was rubbing off on me, and I began asking questions and listening more closely to her stories of flight.

At some point, I realized a big smile had appeared on my face. I was enjoying this talk. And the more Taillow told me about flight, the more I knew I had to experience it for myself. 

Eventually, Taillow interrupted herself by gasping. “Hey, I thought of a great idea!” she cried. “Here’s the thing: if you wanna achieve something, it’s good to get some feeling for what it’s like first, right? That way you know what you’re aiming for. So in other words, I think you should get a taste of flying before you start practicing and learning to fly yourself.”

“A taste of flight?” I asked. “How? What do you have in mind?”

“I mean I can give you a ride! You can get on my back and see what it feels like to fly around.“

My heart skipped a beat or two. That idea sounded terrible—and terrifying. I stammered until I eventually managed to voice my main concern: “W-what if I f-fall off?”

“I’ll just swoop down and you can land on my back again,” Taillow said, as if there were absolutely nothing to worry about. I did not agree with her.

“I’m j-just not... sure that’s safe...” I stuttered.

“It’ll be fine! Remember, back in Waterfall Cave, I saw you use your wings to float down off Sneasel’s head and into her bag. Even if you can’t fly, you can fall really slow with those big wings, by the look of it. So I guess you don’t have to worry about being hurt from a fall, right?”

“Um... that is true, but I’m not sure...” I trailed off.

“What’s there to worry about? If you fall off, you can just float on down, and I can get under you, and you can land on my back again. Like I said, it’ll be fine! I think this is a totally safe way for you to see what it’s like to fly.”

To my surprise and dismay, the bird was actually convincing me. My wings were like a built-in parachute, and I knew Taillow was agile. Assuming she really was able to save me if and when I fell off her back, then I really had nothing to fear. And this definitely would be an inspiring experience. It would be the closest thing to flight that I could possibly experience for now—and possibly forever, if I never got my wings to work right.

That one thought pushed me over the edge of doubt. I had to take this chance. Otherwise, I may never feel the sensation of flying. Against my better judgement, and with a very faint voice, I agreed.

Taillow cheered and hopped around a bit, then sat down low and gestured at her back with her head. “I’ve never given anyone a ride before,” she said, “but how hard can it be?”

That made me hesitate for a moment, but I’d already agreed to her offer, and I felt a momentum pushing me onward. I didn’t want to lose it, so I gulped and climbed up onto her back as if I were mounting a strange horse. Although there was no saddle, her feathers made a comfy, soft seat. I lay down flat on her back and tried to wrap my arms around her neck. They didn’t quite reach all the way around, but it was enough to make me feel more secure.

“You good?” Taillow asked.

I took a few deep breaths to try and calm my nerves. I wondered if the bird could feel my tiny heart pounding rapidly against her back.

“Y-yeah, I guess I’m... ready,” I lied. “Just... be careful, okay? Please?”

“Yeah, sure, whatever, let’s just go!”

Taillow trilled as she jumped off the edge of the crate pile and dove down towards the ground. In the blink of an eye, we were airborne. 

My stomach plummeted as the ground shot up fast. I was too scared to scream. My eyes instinctively tried to clamp shut tightly, but I forced them to stay open so I could see and experience everything. I held on to the bird’s neck tighter and grabbed hold of her feathers as best I could. My wings and antennae were bent back and violently shaken by the force of the wind, and my scarf and blue waist cape rippled behind me.

After falling for a few seconds, Taillow smoothly curved and leveled out before hitting the ground, then deftly banked left and right, gently swerving between the enormous tree stumps looming all around us. It felt like we were flying through a city and dodging skyscrapers—or darting through a forest and dodging trees, to be more accurate. Below us, I saw plenty of Pokemon gathered along the pathways of Lower Capim, some of them glancing up in surprise at the bird zipping closely overhead. I almost wanted to scream for help, but I decided to trust Taillow and hang on.

Eventually, we soared out over the dock of the bay, and my mount angled up and beat her wings rapidly. With each flap, we climbed higher and higher, and my stomach dropped lower and lower. I felt pressure build up in my head, as if I were in a plane during takeoff, and I forced myself to yawn to relieve it. My arms quickly grew sore from holding on to Taillow so tightly. My heartbeat and breathing spun out of control, and I finally shut my eyes and squeaked in fear.

“Doing okay?” Taillow asked.

I barely managed to stammer, “C-c-careful!”

She laughed. “It’s fine! Just don’t let go—and if you do, I’ll catch you! I promise!”

After what felt like hours, Taillow leveled out and began to glide. I heard her wingbeats stop. The only sound was from a quiet breeze that continuously rustled my setae and wings. I finally opened my eyes and looked around. I saw Taillow’s big wings outstretched on either side of me, making small adjustments to catch the winds that blew this high up. Aside from the bird’s dark-feathered wings, head, and body, all I saw were the bright blue sky and fluffy white clouds. I gulped, then carefully crawled a bit forward on Taillow’s back and peered over her shoulder.

The sight made me faint for a brief moment. The ground was unbelievably far below. Capim Town was a small cluster of pale brown among a sea of green, next to the shimmering blue bay. I saw the wilderness of the Grass Continent stretching out around the town, covered in random splotches of lighter green fields and darker green woodlands, with some high gray mountains looming in the distance. The vast ocean stretched out to the west, and the glittering blue ribbon of Serenity River flowed southwest. At the limits of my vision, the horizon curved all around us far away, hazy and indistinct.

Taillow slowly banked to the left, circling high above the ground. I stopped hugging her neck and cautiously pushed myself up off her back, propping myself up with my arms and leaning over her shoulder even more, to get a better view of the world below. I couldn’t take my eyes off it. The view almost made me forget my fear of heights. Almost.

I muttered to myself under my breath, “I can float, it’s fine. My wings are a parachute. I’ll be safe. It’s okay...”

“You okay back there, Booker?” Taillow asked without looking at me. Her head was darting around at random, making quick little adjustments as her eyes focused on all sorts of things in the world below. “What are you talking about?”

“I... I’m still worried about falling. But, the ground down there... everything... it’s...” Despite being a writer, words failed me. I eventually settled on something simple: “It’s beautiful.”

“And now you know why I love flying,” Taillow said.

She began to sing. I slowly felt my fear of heights melt away. I gazed down at the land and sea under me, and I couldn’t stop smiling. I wanted to stay up here forever.

And in that moment, high above the world, alone except for the bird I rode, I silently made a promise to myself. No matter what the cost, no matter how long it took, I would achieve my dream.

I would learn to fly.
