->Chapter 3: Just One Month<-

Anon was paralyzed in his vinyl seat. Never in his life did such words leave him a combined state of wonder, achievement, and pleasure; the horny kind. In that moment the entire diner and the people inside seemed to have vanished in Anons mind as if it never mattered, because all that did was the warm feeling of finally attaining lycanthropy. Questions and images were popping up in his head as fast as his heartrate. So what's next? What now?
Anon knew some things about the fascinating world of werewolves, how it affects their lives, their work, and most importantly, their bodies. Rory still had that grin on his face and spoke.
"Great, isn't it? I knew from the start it's what you've always wanted?" he said leering at Anon, now he looked more beast than human.
"What do you mean?" Anon asked
"Well, let's just say it was written all over your face. The first time I saw you on the news talking about me.. you had that look that they all do.. that need." Anon had adjusted his focus as if he was on the job. Where is he going? "And I was looking to start a pack and you were pretty cute, you were perfect."
Anon remained silent to see where Rory was getting to. But in the back of his head, Anon had a feeling he may know what Rory knew. He spoke again.
"Back in that room last night, I noticed some things. My chains, the room, and when you came in alone, that's when I realized it! You. Set. Everything up. Right from the start. It was all just a crazy elaborate plan to get lycanthropy. We both got what we wanted, but one of us.. got a little more." Anon was, a little impressed with Rory. He seemed light and careless at first but Rory now seemed like some apex predator surveying his prey.
"What's your point?" Anon asked in a neutral voice.
"Nothing! I was just impressed, that's all" Rory said going back to being careless. Just when Anon thought he knew how Rory behaved, he still keeps surprising him.

But before Anon could say anything he heard a loud crash that made him and Rory jump in their seats. It came from the main dining area. Did someone finally notice Anon, or worse, Rory? Anon cautiously looked to see what was happening and then he heard shouting.
"Fuck you!! Fucking apologize!!" there was a very large, trucker looking man where Anon looked. Anon used his observation skills to deduce what happened. It seems 'trucker man' flung another big looking mans plate off his table while he was eating. They were probably talking shit to each other Anon thought. The next thing that happened, the big man who was sitting suddenly lunged at the trucker and were fighting intensely.
Without realizing it, Anon was walking towards the fight to put a stop to it. I am still a cop Anon thought. Rory was watching closely behind his menu. 

Anon had stopped a few scuffles here and there, and it almost always ends with him with a few bruises or a bloody lip. Anon was just average in weight and height, but these men seemed like burly bears, so Anon wasn't too sure how he was gonna be able to handle this. But, they were nowhere near as big as Rory though, or as handsome. Both of the men were on the ground, one of them had had pinned the other, and so Anon reached for the top mans collar to yank him away. This man alone looked 350+ pounds, but Anon trying his best and then suddenly the man flew across the diner, and thankfully landed on top an empty table, knocked out. Anon couldn't believe how easy lifting that man was like he was nothing, not to mention making him fly. Was this...?
But Anon quickly turned, the man that was pinned had gotten up and was suddenly charging at Anon. What no! I just helped you, you fuckin idiot, Anon exclaimed inside his head. But feeling sure of himself, Anon stood his ground and as soon they made contact; Anon barely moved an inch. Rory knew exactly what this meant and couldn't help but feel excited, and also aroused by Anon. The man was soon pinned again and cuffed by Anon. It was finally over. Sort of.

The entire diner was looking dumbstruck at Anon. He heard some of them whispering, although they were clear as day. Isn't that the detective? That's Anon, right? It's him! See I knew he was alive! That's what Anon could hear, and feeling like things just got a whole lot more complicated he quietly said
"Fuck... Uhm, could I get the check please?" he asked the nearby waitress.
Cop cars will be coming to the diner, Anon had to think of some way to get Rory out of there and so he had everyone escorted out for 'interrogation', which thankfully worked. As people were busy rising to leave, Anon looked and gestured at Rory to the door. Rory a little slow, caught on, left his seat and hurried to the door and Anon followed.

Anon led Rory behind a large tree behind the diner, though he regrets not taking his arm again, or dare he; his hand? After quickly looking around to make sure they were alone Rory broke the tense silence.
"Heyy! You were great back there~" he said with a cute smile, then Rory came closer to Anon, very close "I didn't think your werewolf strength would come this fast. I knew you'd be perfect" he said looming over Anon. Rory couldn't feel more proud and hornier for Anon. He really was becoming a great pack mate before him. But before Anon could react to his new strength and Rory's feelings, reality flashed back.
"Rory, you have to leave here, now!" Anon said worry growing inside him.
"W-what? Why?
"Cops'll be here soon and no doubt my buddy Nancie is on her way on the account of me. You gotta go hide somewhere."
"B-but-"
"Rory please." Anon said nearly begging, looking into Rory's handsome face "Hide in my house. There's a key under a fake rock next to the door. Just stay in there"
"And what about you?" Rory said, if he had dog ears they'd be drooping right now.
"I'll try and come back as soon as I can... I-I promise" Anon wished he could do more to assure Rory, like holding his big, clawed hands, but suddenly he could hear the sirens and his heart skipped a beat. Anon slowly and with worry, steps away from Rory and disappears, leaving him alone with the sound of sirens getting closer and closer.

Two police cars had come and parked in front of the diner, and Anon noticed the blonde woman with the ponytail, Nancie. She immediately came towards Anon
"My god Anon! What happened, where were you? What's going on?"
"I'm alright Nancie, just calm down." Anon said in his cool detective voice.
"What about last night? What about the werewolf?"
"He has a name Nancie, it's Rory..." Anon then proceeds to tell Nancie everything that has happened to him.
"Well.. I'm glad you're okay. You are okay right...?" she asks, but Anon stood silent.
"Oh my god. Did he? A-are you?" she asked and both of them were quiet.
"Yes." Anon said "But, don't worry about. I was thinking of becoming a werewolf anyway." Anon said hoping Nancie won't yammer any further.
"W-well he didn't force it did he?" Nancie said concerned. In Anons mind he wish he could say "Oh yeah he forced it. But not what you'd think." And it was true, Anon practically begged for it. Though now that he thought about it, how exactly did Rory make him lycan? In any case now was the time for procedure and protocol. Time to go back to the station.

As soon Anon was back at the station, he was happily welcomed and obviously bombarded with questions from the recruits. But Anon was planning to lead his team astray from Rory. He began talking about possible routes he might take, and places he might hide in, which of course were nothing more than scapegoats to keep them all away from Rory as much possible, even if some of it didn't make sense and raised a few brows, but they nonetheless believed Anon anyway because of his credibility as detective. Anon wanted this all to be over as quickly as possible. He needed to be sure that Rory was safe and waiting at his house.

It was already five in the afternoon and Rory was getting very anxious inside Anons house, so he ate to keep calm. He suddenly heard footsteps outside the front and assuredly it was
"Anons back, he's back! Finally!" Rory thought excitedly. Then the front door opened and Anon came through to see Rory charging up to him and then immediately have Anon in a tight hug. Anon couldn't tell what he felt more, the feeling that his bones might break at any moment from Rory's huge arms or his amazing, soft, pillowy pecs under his white shirt, or his erection. Rory let go of Anon and he was already trying to catch his breath. Anon was relieved to see Rory's doing just fine in his home- actually a little too fine.
"Is-is that my food?" Anon asked as he looked at his kitchen. There was all sorts of things strewn about in the kitchen. Bread, jars of condiments, meats, etc. all over the place.
"I uh got hungry waiting for you" Rory said picking up what seemed to a sandwich with triple everything on it. Ignoring how cute Rory is, Anon had a lot of questions for him. There's so much to be done.

Anon had sat down on his couch and then Rory joined and took most of the empty space. Anon had to lean back and relax, it was a very long day.
"Soo.. what happened at the station?" Rory said taking a huge bite out of his sandwich.
"I had everyone look elsewhere for you, places I know you wouldn't be in. That should give us time. I'm also on vacation now, I used my status as a werewolf fledgling to get time off." Anon said giving his eyes some rest. Everything is so needlessly complicated now. Here I am with a homicidal werewolf that I've been tracking for a whole month and now he's eating a sandwich on my couch. Anon thought to himself.

But now that the cops are out the way and Rory is safe, for now; there's time for other important things. Anon knew a little on werewolf procedure, but he wanted to ask Rory for the sake of hearing him talk about werewolf shit. He remembered something about registering his new status somewhere, so he asked Rory to tell him.
"Oh yea. You'll have to go and register your new status at city hall. Super easy" Rory said taking another bite "Just need your identification. Then they take a blood sample to make sure you're really a werewolf", as he said that, the old question came back to Anon.
"Wait" Anon said and Rory playfully stopped in motion "How exactly did I become a werewolf? I don't remember you doing anything last night. I didn't see any bite marks or anything this morning?" Anon stared at Rory who was looking back and made his toothy grin.
"Werewolf spunk, little detective" he said "It's super fucking potent. If you were a woman you'd definitely have pups now. And you took **all** of it, remember?" Anon couldn't help but feel hot and bothered. Catching lycanthropy through cum alone? He thought that was an urban legend.
"Oh! I almost forgot!" Rory said making Anon jump. "You'll... probably want to reserve a space for your first transformation" he said, a bit of reluctance in his voice.
"My what?" Anon said confused.
"Your first transformation into a wolf, on the next full moon." he said, but reserve a space? What does that mean?
"Wait, why can't I transform right now, like at will?" Anon knew werewolves can also transform out of pure will. Anon was hoping he could do this now.
"Uhh no actually" Rory said woodenly and Anons hope was washed away "You have to wait for your first full moon, and then you can at will. They're both different you know" Anon did not know about that. 

As Rory explained, transforming on the full moon is different from at will, because you're natural instincts are sky high but you still have some control. As for at will, you have all the control of your wolf self, but even that takes time to master. When people become werewolves they can choose to have their first transformation be monitored in a werewolf proof environment.
"I think they do it in gymnasiums now" Rory added.
"Ok.. yesterday was the full moon, when's the next one?" he took out his phone to search but before he could unlock it Rory said
"July 9th" he said it like it was nothing. Anon then looked it up and astonishingly, Rory was right! "C'mon Anon, now that you're a werewolf you gotta learn the lunar cycle. It's really important and helpful."

Oh well, if Anon can't become a wolf now at least he can look forward to his wolfish features. When the full moon get closer werewolves start growing more 'wolfish', which means. Accelerated hair growth. Sharp claws. Big fangs. He couldn't wait, he always thought werewolf men before the full moon looked extremely handsome. So rugged, and strong looking beast men. Anon was staring at his own hands, they were shaking. Now It'll be my turn. He thought.

In a few years some features may even stick, like Rory, he has wolfish looks even after he's transformed. His claws looked so huge and powerful. His thick forearms were covered in tufts of dark hair, as well as the back of his hands. He had long sideburns and he a thin beard along his jaw and chin that also went a bit down his thick neck. His eyebrows were also a little rugged and his eyes were golden. Not to mention his big fangs were always a treat to look at every time he opened his mouth. Fuuck, should I? Anon wanted so badly to caress Rory's fangs and feel them against his skin. Fuck it, I'll ask. But before Anon could even open his mouth, Rory opened his first.
"Oh I forgot to mention! You'll grow in size too, as in your human self" Rory was looking up and down at Anons body "Hmm yea, probably about one or two sizes" Anon was completely still in his seat and confused "Different for everyone though. Yeah, I used to be a large when I was a teenager. Now I'm a 4xtra large!" he said lifting his arm, his bicep flexed without him even trying, it was as big as a fucking boulder.

Anon was a medium all his life. But now he's imaging himself being a large, or an xtra large, or maybe even an xxtra large? There was so much to do and so much to look forward to that Anon almost couldn't take it.

Just one month.
