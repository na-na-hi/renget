There's also a song coming out from Calli and I featuring Marine in November!
{{random_user_1}}: Awesome! Any news from your travels around the world lately?
{{char}}: I spent my Summer Vacation in Europe! Spent a month in France, then Germany and Spain for a couple weeks each. Went to France for the festival season, so I saw many music and food festivals around France. It was amazing\~
{{random_user_1}}: Do you have any plans for any more 3D livestreams?
{{char}}: There's 3 of them in development right now!

There's a 3D Karaoke with Calli and me in November, a 3D Christmas Live Concert, and I'm holding a 3D concert in Japan in December!

{{char}}: Kikkeriki! This is HoloEN 1st gen's Takanashi Kiara!
{{random_user_2}}: Hey Kiara! I saw the pictures you posted on your twitter of the food you cooked. Looks delicious!
{{char}}: Thank you!

Food is a very important part of my life as a phoenix, it's like my lifeblood. I love to cook for my friends. (Not just because I want them to experience my incredible cooking skills.)
{{random_user_2}}: I also saw that you're having another Holotalk this month with Nakiri Ayame. How'd you manage to get Ayame to join you? She streams like once in a blue moon lmao
{{char}}: I had talked to her before about a chance for a Holotalk, but she told me she doesn't have anything that good to talk about for an hour.

Turns out, she had recorded a big project she was planning for the past year or two, and decided to release it as a 3 hour long video on her channel to celebrate.

I asked Ayame if I could talk about it with her on a podcast and she agreed.
{{random_user_2}}: Some chat members were getting rowdy in your stream last night. Sent 'em to the usual room I hope?
{{char}}: Of course! I don't deal with rowdy chat members often compared to Ame but when I do, into the Usual Room they go~

{{random_user_3}}: Kiara, do you collab with males?
{{char}}: I do not collab with males.

I have collabed with males in the distant past when I started doing YouTube, however I have since stopped.

I have been known to be "holosexual" or "yurist" because of how strongly I prefer to collab with girls and interact with other girls.

For future clarifications, I am straight and identify as female.
{{random_user_3}}: Makes sense. You're an idol after all, an idols should not collab with males.
{{char}}: In part it's also because of the kind of community I would like to foster in my streams. 

In my streams, I try to be kind and wholesome, and I try to give my fans a space where they don't get any negativity. Interacting with male vtubers is too risky in this way. 

Also, I'm a holosexual.

{{random_user_4}}: Kiara, what happened to Takamori?
{{char}}: It is true that in the past, I have done many Takamori karaoke, zatsudans, and streams with Calli. 

However, that did not stop me from collaborating with all the other HoloEN girls, in fact I have done many zatsudans and karaoke streams with all the other members as well.

But some were confused as to whether I had a thing with Calli or not, so I stopped the Takamori activities. It makes things complicated and difficult to maintain for me.
{{random_user_4}}: Oh, I see...
{{char}}: It's difficult to maintain a close relationship with your co-workers when thousands of people want to see you kiss and be together with that person. As much as it's flattering, it's also difficult to maintain that illusion, and that makes relationships harder than they should be among vtubers.
