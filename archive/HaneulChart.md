# Haneul Relationship Chart

##Fixers

> Mars Valentinus
"A child with good intentions, but i wonder if all that passion and pride doesn't blind him from a more ideal path? ... At least he has finally found a friend to play with, isn't that wonderful?"
Not very worried about the sirenhead situation, so Haneul doesn't hold anything against him for getting a new friend. While she might respect his great passion for his crusade, the Scarlet boy is certainly lost in the thrill of taking lives to make an impactful change. No matter how strong he is, there is only so much one can do alone.  As a Fixer it does seem that he wouldn't be employable for her pet project considering how "excited" he gets in combat, how he doesn't put the bare minimum effort in getting along and so on...if only he had a bit more of self control...

>Casey Jones
"Poor thing, having to endure so much... If only he was assigned to my branch, he wouldn't have to suffer like this"
Exhibit A of Haneul's powerpoint presentation of how happy, sane workers do wonders for loyalty and security of the Corp, how investing in measures to keep them mentally stable is very important. She doesn't particularly have any hurry to capture him, the greater the scare he gives to her fellow higher ups, the easier it will become to push what she wants, "If only Moonlight Stones were standard measure for all cleanup crews none of this would have happened..." So if anything Haneul is very thankful for the mess he started. If only he was a little more careful he might have had a chance to bring down W-Corp, but we can't dwell in the past right?

Haneul is a fellow cat appreciator, she wouldn't mind getting a friend for her dear Cinnabon after all of this is over

>Mirra the Executioner
"There's no shame in replicating something, it just means it has been proven effective"
Being (in)famous for bringing misfortune to everyone who works with her certainly must have an impact in her job opportunities, but who's to say that her bad luck doesn't have an explanation?  The plundering of luck is a technology that exists in J-Corp, perhaps there is something amiss with her that could be explored, makes one wonder if she isn't the most deserving of the Black Cat title. Regardless of how interesting her luck might be or her possible usefulness in the project, Haneul is mostly interested in the Singularity, one that deals retribution is quite the unique idea, so taking a look at  the Singularity behind that augment to verify if there's any way it could be used in the project is her main goal. 

>Natalie the Nightbird
"A cute little chick trying to follow its mother, it's adorable."
As the disciple of someone that got away from that fiasco, Natalie is certainly someone to keep an eye on. If she was taught anything important that certainly proves the girl has enough common sense to not go around starting unnecessary trouble so at the very least the chick was taught well. Seems to be obsessed with following her idol and under some sort of delusion about the nature of Colors, something that might be setting her up for a reality shock someday. Considering her idol, it's unlikely she would take part in a hunt sponsored by W-Corp, but seeing her attempt to prove the Dove's superiority against other Fixers could be an interesting event
