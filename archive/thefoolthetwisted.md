	*The man next to me at night, coughing himself inside out. One day I couldn’t make out what was happening to the corporal’s face. It kept changing into faces I knew from somewhere else. I began to yell so that everyone would see it too. When somebody did finally come up to me, it was this man with the cough, and he was holding a broom, but I saw right away that it was a man’s leg which had been cut off (...) There were arms and legs and heads everywhere and I couldn’t tell when any minute!—"* - Elwin Lepellier

> Story
Not all of Lobotomy Corps' divisions were branches. Sometimes, they called themselves affiliates. And that's what the Devon Preparatory School became. What was a normal academy turned into an institute that prepped soldiers for the incoming Smoke War. This is where the fate of poor Elwin Lepellier began.

Everything was so idyllic for the Nest-dweller. The perfect student body, the invigorating sports culture, a campus that was far from the main Wing. But all this was a lure; beneath Devon lay an enhancement facility primed for the most gruesome and bizarre surgeries. When a naive Leper signed up for the War, he was assigned to these bowels. Squirming limbs long severed, organs vomited from the mouth, shifting faces: it was too much. He ran away 2 weeks after his assignment. 

When Devon's greatest alumni passed away, he was already gone, the horrors of the facility twisting him inside out. Now, almost nothing is left of the student he once was. All that remains is the fear gnawing within him, one that can shift to staggering violence.

(820 points, 110 left)
> Perks (700)
(-15) Standard Combat Style
(-30) Unique Combat Style Lvl 3 [Ice Traps]
> Leper is a very skittish Distortion who relies on his ice constructs to finish off his pursuers. That doesn't mean he's a slouch at a fight, however. If anything, his cowardly nature hides a brutal force of a man who'd pummel heads until they're nothing but smears on the ground. 

(-15) Booksmart
> The fruits of Devon never leave Leper. He still remembers the lessons taught there like yesterday.
(-30) Unnatural Emanation
> Ice isn't the only thing forming around him. A sense of disgust fills the freezing air the closer one gets to Leper. His ice constructs seem to radiate that aura even more, to the point of oozing clear disdain for the atrocities of the City. Even a single brush on the ice and you'll be hating the world for the entire day.
(-15) Extreme Survivalist
(-15) Urban Movement
(-15) That is that, and this is this 
(-25) Chemical Abuse
(-35) Junk Rat
> Like the Rats around him, Leper endured the Backstreets by ducking his head down at the worst sights. And finding the best places to duck down. Or just juicing and beating said worst sights into a meaty puddle. Or finding a tool to do said beating. Hey, ducking down doesn't get you everywhere.

> Distortion Perks (+DLC)
(Free) Inhuman Form
> Sometimes, the ice around his body flutters like a flower. Other times, it even pulses like muscles. No matter how much it burns, It's a part of him now. 
(Free) Supernatural Aspect
(-25) Enhanced Aspect
> Ice works in many fabulous ways. Forming weapons and armor, cooling the air around you, giving frostbite to unsuspecting foes, giant golems made of frozen underwater ruins, sewage turned into blades to give enemies every disease known to man, frictionless skiing, traveling through lines of ice by merging into them. The possibilities are only hampered by Leper's reluctance to fight, which starts its own issues and creative solutions.
(-15) Blend In
(-15) Relatively Stable
> Surprisingly, or maybe DUE to his cowardice, Leper has retained as much humanity as a frostbitten ice-grown creature can have. While not fearing for his life, he can hold some detailed conversations about sports and the nature of insanity. Don't ask him about his war experience though: the last person who did screamed at him to shut up. 
(-40) Parasitic
(-70) Crying Children
> Touching his ice constructs is one thing, having shards of them left in your body is another. Victims with Leper's ice implanted in them aren't immediately brainwashed but become receptors for his powers. Wherever they go, the range of his attacks and vision stretches to that area. One could sleep and then wake up to find out their room was frozen to 0 degrees Celsius. Or that an icy arm formed from their sweat and tore the entire place into shambles.

> The crystals are fueled by feelings of melancholy, loneliness, and grief, attempting to magnify these feelings in those they infect. Increasing the body temperature only works so long, the sadder the host, the quicker they'll reform.

(-90) "Philip"
(-80) Accepting Oneself
(-70) Qliphoth Meltdown
> District 24 was terrorized by 4 different creatures for 4 years. The first was a gorilla-esque lizard that had an army of ice replicas copying its every move. The second was a truck-sized ball of frostbitten corpses that could unfurl into an octopod creature. The third resembled a giant ice crystal with flesh coating it, which fired massive blasts of frozen air. And the last? It was the worst. No one remembers what its true form was but the accounts talk about a snowstorm that constantly melted and froze everything it touched, and what looked like a blade-covered eye in its epicenter.

> Every single one of these creatures was a form of Leper's, the last one being his first Qliphoth Meltdown. Though he prefers his current humanoid appearance, desperate measures will call for these nightmarish forms to appear. And god help his psyche if he has to do a Meltdown again.

(-40) Distortion Fields
> Wherever he goes, the area starts to become a frozen version of his Devon days. Ever seen a snow-coated tree burst through an abandoned Workshop?

(-60) Red, White, Black (White)
> Don't touch the ice, you'll see what he saw underneath the preparatory school. Even Smoke War veterans have been rendered catatonic just from touching a gas-tank-sized chunk.

> Equipment (200 + 90)
For the record, Leper did not kill any of the original owners. He just picked their corpses.

(-50) Quality II Armor: Abandoned Enforcer's Outfit
> A coat and helmet that washed up in District 24's sewers. Leper has been wearing them ever since, as a reminder of his dreams of "ski-trooper", even if the coat has become frayed from ice crystals snagging it. The helmet is sturdy enough to block hits while the coat has Neuvo Fabric intertwined within it, protecting his frozen interiors.
(-70) Quality II Weapon: T Corp Collector's Pick
> A double-sided mining pick used by T Corp's golden collectors. The second user, a lucky Rat, didn't take good care of it so the blades have cracks and chips on them. However, its ability to store energy with each hit is still intact. With enough energy, the pick can create a burst that shocks its victims. 
(-70) Quality II Weapon: Leech Drone
> Canister-shaped drone that can attach to Leper's helmet. Its main forte lies in its life-draining abilities, latching onto an enemy to drain their energy before bestowing it to its user. The drone usually deactivates upon the death of its first user, he doesn't know how this one is still active.
(-100) Quality III Weapon:  Modified Flesh Halberd
> A favorite among Paracelsus Atelier's customers, its telescopic handle allows it to be easily carried. Before his death in X Corp's Backstreets, the owner of this particular halberd requested a modification for his copy. This came in the form of a second blade, which, combined with the original, can move like a buzzsaw to cut through flesh and metal easily.

> Misc (50+20)
(-25) Tailoring Machine
(-25) Moonlight Stones
(-20) HP Syringes

> Body Enhancements (180 + 10)
#####Devon Enhancement Prepping System (DEPS)
>During Devon School's affiliation with L-Corp, every student in Leper's year was implanted with a series of enhancements. Their main purpose was to strengthen the body enough that more specialized augments could be placed without a chance of rejection. The project was simple: augment a person beyond the Red Mist's strength. While the personal intervention of Gebura forced the project's closure, the students did not have their existing augments removed. 

>Leper, in particular, did not have any further augments after the DEPS. As a result, it has begun to malfunction; his bizarre physiology and continuous use not helping matters. Some of the tattoos' nanomachines have dropped off, his HUD system freezes and displays incorrect data at times, and his muscles experience bouts of paralysis. Still, he sees it as a sign of better days, when it was just him, his friends, and the forest around their campus.

(-40) Tattoos Tier III
> Back tattoo depicting a hummingbird in a Vitruvian Man pose. It reduces the weight of the muscles, giving a sense of weightlessness to the user. This increases their speed and attack velocity as a result, allowing faster strikes. The tattoo glows red when this happens.
(-60) Cybernetics Tier III
> Combination of a HUD connected to Leper's nerves and a pumping system. The pumping system converts waste products in the body into more energy, allowing the user to continue fighting without attending to their bodily needs. Meanwhile, the HUD system can identify what kind of enhancements a person is using as well as general facts about their identity: perfect for finding lost students around Devon grounds.
(-90) Biological Implant Tier III
> The main powerhouse of DEPS, the muscles are reinforced and fed a steroid cocktail to encourage their growth. The intended result is the implantee's muscles reaching the power of Kali's. At the start, the implantee has 15% of the Red Mist's strength, further thresholds restrained by the discretion of L-Corp. By some coincidence, Leper's muscle malfunction also deactivated the power restraints. This resulted in his strikes being stilted but powerful.
