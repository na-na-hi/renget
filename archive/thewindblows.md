#Chance Encounters

->*"I won't kneel. Not now, not ever."*<-

Ancient trees bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun as Suzerain clutched her neck, blood seeping through her trembling fingers. She tried to speak, to cast away her pride, and plead for mercy at the indifferent stares of her executioners. But her voice failed her, choked up by the blood that welled up in her throat. When the sun finally dipped below the horizon, the light in Suzerains eyes had already faded. For a fleeting moment, the world stood still in darkness, and then something shifted.  A blinding light, knowing no stasis, danced and fluttered, expanding without restraint. 

****
Her eyes eventually adjusted to what was the sunlight, Suzerain beheld an azure sky stretching endlessly beyond sight. She reached up above, her fingers grazing the velvety softness of crimson petals. The soft rustle of moving leaves and delicate scent of flowers kept most thoughts scrambled.
After pushing herself up from her knees, rising to her feet. The world seemed to shift and align in this upright stance. She touched her neck, half-expecting to feel an open wound, but there was nothing there, only smooth skin. 

Then it hit her—the landscape was covered in an expansive bed of flowers, devoid of any trees. It resembled an endless ocean of vibrant red, with a single road meandering through its midst. Tall crimson stalks of a popular herbal plant for the ailing swayed gently in the breeze. 

Yet Suzerain had to be sure, so she pinched one of her own cheeks.

"O-ouch," escaped her parched throat.

While she felt relieved, her body struggled to walk. Like her legs had transformed into stiff wooden stilts, awkward and unyielding. After a few stumbling steps, they finally found their way onto the road. It unfortunately didn't give Suzerain a clue to where she was. Help can be sought during times like these. As she followed the road, there grew a thicket with purple blooms. Berries grew along its thorn-laden branches, and pricking her finger, a tiny trickle of blood poured out.

**B-CAST**

The sensation was both stimulating and uncomfortable, an electrifying tingle coursing through her veins. Crimson droplets coalesced, filling an invisible mold, and soon a floating rune took form. It glowed brightly for a fleeting moment before the energy transformed back into pure Mana, pulsating with untamed power  


**PLANE;(ELE)**


Suzerain immediately applied pressure to the bleeding index finger with her thumb. She extended her other palm under the glowing rune.  Intricate symbols spun above the open hand like pins of a lock finding their place.

*"Come forth childe o wind. Heed my call. I seek your aid."*

**SUMMON_α**

Upon extracting her hand the rune collapsed into itself. Two beady ethereal eyes looked back at her from the emerging body of a gentle swirl.

"□□□□□-□□□. □□□?" It inquired 

"For seven nights." Suzerain set the deadline

"□□□?" the elemental probed further.

"When it reaches the third." she informed the minor elemental

"□□-□□□□-□□." It stated in a otherwordly tongue

"My constitution can keep up." she assured her summon

"First, find my recorder. I must have dropped it over there." she pointed to the sea of flowers

The nimble zephyr raced into the field. Plants bowed through its passage before settling back to their original forms. Amidst the trodden flowers that marked Suzerain's rough outline, the elemental raised a flute triumphantly. It glided back to her.

"Thanks, I think I'll call you Junior."

"□!" It chirped back

Suzerain received the instrument with great care. After wiping some grass away, she lifted the wooden flute to her lips once more. The first notes escaped the flute, they were timid, like it had been dormant for too long. However, before the melody could fully take shape, her eyes were drawn to her summon.

"Can you take me to the coast?" she asked

The wisp snapped to attention, turning away from the mesmerizing dance of flying pollen. Circling around Suzerain, it guided her with gentle winds that tugged at her dress bloomers. They mostly followed the beaten path, taking in all the sights in each others company. After much walking along the road, she reached the foot of a hill. With Junior cheering her on every step of the way, Suzerain started ascending. However, much to her embarrassment, climbing proved more challenging than she had expected. The slope was steeper than it appeared from afar, and her breaths quickened with each step.

Atop the small hill, she spotted a lone figure — a beastman — sitting comfortably by the first tree she had seen. In the east, with their sharp tusks, flat snouts, and lumbering appearances, pigmen were commonly mistaken for being demon-kin. Despite his less-than-graceful appearance, this one seemed to be meditating. Prayer beads adorned the unkempt, coarse, and discolored skin which seemed to spill over itself in rolls and folds. But his movements were clumsy, unlike the practiced gestures of wandering countryside exorcists. Suzerain cautiously approached the large beastman, uncertain if he was even awake. 

"Can't you see I'm enjoying the morning shade? the beastman snorted

 "J... Just passing through. Apologies ser." Her words stumbling out as she replied.  She maintained a polite distance, wary of his intentions.

"Caligula. I'm old, not some lord's retainer. But you should really know better than blocking such a great view, boy." he mistakenly remarked, his gaze drifting towards the horizon.

Suzerain stepped out the way as her summon floated close by. It suddenly zipped over to the stranger, whirling around him in a strange manner. It gently tugged at his ears examining them with great curiosity. Soft, immaterial giggles escaped Junior as it teased the pigman. Caligula remained unperturbed by the elemental's antics, but a hint of a smile grew on his face. Losing interest, Junior went back to place.

"Come now Junior. Let's go, stop disturbing them." Suzerain chastised

"Are the two of you lost?" he asked

Junior turned to its master, and as Suzerain hesitantly nodded, so did the elemental. Caligula lowered the smaller prayer beads he held and scratched his chin.

"I'm heading for the coast or the nearest town whichever comes first." she admitted

"Keep going. If there are roads, then there are cities. The weather is just so unbearably hot." Caligula grunted

"Thank you and goodbye," she spoke, her voice cautious yet grateful. "If we meet again, please call me Suzerain," she introduced herself

Following the bending road, Suzerain gave one last look to take in the  view herself. However, her attention quickly shifted as she noticed something leaning against the tree's trunk—a club spanning half its length with spikes protruding on one end. She didn't want to find out if her armor could hold up.

Along the way, she passed through a succession of vibrant fields, each a kaleidoscope of colors and open plains.  Suzerain found herself alone with her thoughts. The more she tried to enjoy the picturesque landscape, the duller it all looked.  Junior released a few wildflowers into  greater winds in her stead. Grass eventually gave way to beginnings of a forest. The air grew cooler, and the familiar scent of earth and moss invited her in. Sunlight filtered through a thick canopy of leaves casting dappled shadows on the dirt.

**ESS;(SPD)**

Suzerain felt a small gust of wind brush her shoulder, and in that very moment, something yanked the minor elemental with surprising force. A startled sound, resembling a disturbed wind chime, followed the sudden disappearance. Instinctively turning her neck, Suzerain caught sight of a peculiar scene. Before her stood a pale woman, all her limbs appearing to be nothing but crimson bone. Despite the eerie sight, the woman's voice was high-pitched and filled with giddiness.

"Hellooo there! Well, aren't you just the fluffiest bundle of joy!" the voice called out.  

Her skeletal hands cradled the squirming air elemental, its form trapped  in her grasp. She petted it with an eerie fondness, like one would treat  a stray cat.

"Are you alright?" Suzerein asked.

"□□□..." interjected Junior, expressing its displeasure.

"I am the illustrious Lady Caniara, not some mere country bumpkin," she boasted. "Of course, I'm perfectly alright."

"They aren't some toy for you to play with," Suzerain complained sheepishly.

"Oh, don't worry, I didn't harm your little friend," Caniara replied.

"Tsk. Tsk.Tsk. Missy, you're quite lucky," Caniara continued, her voice filled with pride. "I even have the patience to deal with dummies."

"Thank you?" Suzerain responded, unsure of how to react.

"Hmph. You don't look like a peasant, so what are you supposed to be?" Caniara questioned, raising an eyebrow.

"Incredibly lost," Suzerain admitted.

"Well, a pitiful town had the honor of my timely presence. Ruddborn? Ruthferd? Ruthun t'was called," Caniara said with a hint of uncertainty.

"Oh, that's good. Could you tell me how far I have to go?" Suzerain asked, hoping for some direction.

"Right, right! The town... well, it's not far from here. Just head... uh... that way!" Caniara gestured vaguely, her enthusiasm waning.

The limp air elemental sprung out her distracted hands. Flying in the air before retreating behind Suzerain. It snuck a few daggered stares at its former captor. Suzerain managed a weak smile while considering her next words. It was hard to ignore the instinctual aversion she felt towards Caniara. This feeling wasn't born out of personal dislike; it was just something deep within their shared heritage she struggled with.

Still, a nagging tinge of sympathy bloomed within her. Caniara seemed older than she looked but was lacking a few things upstairs. Never mind notions of camaraderie; at least Suzerain could somewhat predict her. If she turned out to be truly monstrous on the inside, then there would be problems.

"Miss Caniara, would you like to walk together?  It would be my pleasure to accompany someone as strong and capable as you." she spoke carefully
