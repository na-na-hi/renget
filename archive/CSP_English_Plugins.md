# CSP Plugins
!!! note In regards to usage
    Anecdotally plugins work on my copy of CSP but may not work for everyone as they are not **officially** supported outside of the Japanese version.
    You should place the .dlls directly in `AppData\Roaming\CELSYSUserData\CELSYS\CLIPStudioPlugIn\PAINT`
    If it worked as expected you should see the files under `Filter`
==Might only work on global versions instead of official English but this needs testing==

These plugins are old and I have no way to access the Japanese store to obtain updates or new plugins.

 Name | Description | Thumbnail
 ----: | :----: | :----: 
**Inomura**|This filter uses perlin noise to change hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha to create uneven colors. Detail can be easily raised with analog-style painting|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_grand_prix02.jpg)
**Ryusen**|This plug-in draws streamlines. Various effects can be rendered depending on the settings.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_etc01.jpg)
**Syuchusen**|This plug-in draws a concentration line. Various effects can be rendered depending on the settings.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_etc02.jpg)
**Retro Filter**|Instagram-style processing. Using it for color illustrations can create an antique look.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_etc03.jpg)
**Ganime Color**|This filter automatically converts the color of an image drawn on a raster layer to a shadow color (or highlight color). It converts the color of the painted image to a shadow or highlight color using a specific color set inside the filter. |![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_special_prize.jpg)
**GAuto Shadow**|This filter automatically converts the color of an image drawn on a raster layer to a shadow color (or highlight color). It corrects color tones by color gamut and converts them to shadow or highlight colors.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_first_prize.jpg)
**GReserved Color**|Replaces the color of an image drawn on a color raster layer with a specific color set by the user. It is intended to be used to change the color of a character or replace it with a shadow or highlight color. The first pixel is the "original color" and the second pixel is the "color to be replaced".|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_etc04.jpg)
**Point Light**|This plug-in can generate an effect as if a light source were placed at a certain point on the editing target.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_02_encouragement_prize.jpg)
**Kahitsu**|This filter makes the thickness of the pen line thicker or thinner. By adjusting the line thickness, you can create a delicate touch with thin lines or a rough touch with thick lines. Narrowing down the correction area by selection simplifies common expressions such as making lines thicker where they intersect (e.g., at the hairline). You can also use perlin noise to add random strength to the lines, making it easy to rework the lines to be more crisp. |![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_grand_prix.jpg)
**Analogue Kakeami**|By specifying the number of lines, the number of cuts, and the size of each square, you can create a variety of cuts more naturally and easily than with a brush.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_first_prize01.jpg)
**Crystalize**|This filter transforms an image into a collection of monochromatic polygons, as if seen through a crystal. It was created using a technique called Voronoi decomposition. ⁘Voronoi partitioning is a partitioning method that divides space based on which point is closest to an arbitrary point (the base point) when there are multiple points in space.|![](https://clipsrc.s3.amazonaws.com/clip_site/view/promotion/clipstudio/paint_plugin_contest/view/img/thumb_first_prize02.jpg)
