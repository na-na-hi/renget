## FAQ

1. How do I upgrade Equipment?
You can only upgrade green-level equipment and above. They'll begin to show up at a high enough Outpost level, or at Stage 4 of Interception level D.

2. I can't beat the train in EX Stage 2!
Your Nikkes are set to level 80 for all EX stages. The train is weak to wind-element Nikkes and snipers. Destroy its missile launchers first to get rid of the unavoidable projectiles. You can come back later to it later, though.

3. My Nikkes are leveled 10, and I can't process pass Stage 2-
See the red dots around in the lobby? They're there for a reason.
Click the '!' on the Mission tab.

4. I spent resources on the wrong Nikke! Can I get them back?
There is a "reset level" option on a Nikke's screen, underneath their displayed level. It costs 10 gems. You cannot reclaim your mats from upgrading a Nikke's skills, however.

5. Butt physics toggle?
Settings>Graphics Tab>Scroll down for "Physics" and "Morph" options. Graphics on "High" for maximum jiggles.

6. How do I change the Nikke in my lobby?
Settings (only in the lobby, it changes to three squares in the top right!)> lobby option

7. What is the Simulation room for?
Getting mats for leveling your Nikkes skills. They reset after each day, so you can get daily rewards. You can play the highest difficulty to collect all rewards below for each sector. E.g. completing 3-A will grant you the rewards of 1-A, and 2-A.

8. Do I need to level my Nikkes evenly?
Past 4-15, you will unlock Synchro Link.
The way it works is that you will be able to share the level of the weakest of your top 5 characters.
So if you have 5 SR characters at level 160, you can link one of them with your SSR and pull your SSR to level 160 without needing dupes.
Removing a character reset her level and locks the slot for 4 hours. It's to prevent you from abusing the level up sync to tackle multiple-phase stages.

9. How do I unlock the Wishlist function to focus on units I want on rolling?
Roll 40 times on any banner.

10. What are Pilgrims?
The real SSR units. What makes them special is that you can't focus to get them via Wishlist function or High-Quality Molds, but they're available on most banners. Basically, secret spooks exclusive to banners. When in doubt, check the rates of the banner. 

11. What is Interception?
Re-fighting bosses for tiers of gear. Doesn't matter if you win or lose. The gear that is dropped depends on damage dealt. You have 3 tries per day.

12. Is Scarlet the strongest unit? Should I re-roll for her?
She is one of the strongest Nikkes for DPS thus far, however, this is a team comp synergy kind of game. There is no "one Nikke fits all" situation. just b urself.

13. Can I rebuild my covers?
Litter can do it! Otherwise, no one else can, currently.

14. What do I do with the commander code from pre-reg?
We just don't know (yet).

15. Servers?
Global is EU, NA is North America. You can't transfer data between servers.

16. Explain Burst, I skipped it!
After dealing enough damage, Burst starts with using a level 1 character burst. You then have a time window to activate level 2 which opens up a new time window to activate a level 3, which finally causes Final Burst where all Nikkes follows the aim of the Nikke you're playing.

17. How do I get everyone under cover at once?
Tap the Nikke's portrait of the Nikke you're playing as. Tap again to make them start shooting again.

18. Where do I put codes?
Click Notice (the bell icon on the top right of the lobby), and then select "CD-KEY INSERT".

19. What are my dailies?
Do the highest Simulation sector you can do.
Intercept a boss 3 times.
Check your outpost, dispatch your Nikkes for the Bulletin Board, and Advise your Nikkes.
Send friend points to your friends so you (and them) can do the Social banner with the Heart Points. The same Nikkes in the normal banner also show up in the Social banner, Pilgrims do not.
Check your other main Dailies log by clicking on the '!' above your Nikke in the lobby.

20. What are the numbers on my boxes?
IT IS NOT A TIMER. It gives you 'x' hours of production from your Outpost based on its level, making it useful at higher Outpost levels. For example, opening a 12-Hour EXP box gives you the amount of EXP you would've gained in 12 hours, instantly, instead of actually waiting for those 12 hours to pass.

21. What is the Code Manual Selection Box?
It gives you mats for upgrading your Nikkes' Skills past level 4, the elements correspond with the Nikke of your choosing.

22. Pity?
On special banners, one roll gives you one ticket. After 200 rolls (60k gems), you can buy the unit you want. These tickets carry over to other special banners.
The Ordinary Recruit banner does not give pity tickets, it does, however, give you tickets for spare bodies which can be used to limit break your Nikkes.

23. How do I get Union Points?
Firing Range (Union Menu) & Doing Dailies. Raids will be added later.

24. Is there anything I should be buying from the shop every day, other than the free item?
You could buy some high-quality molds, but after Outpost Lvl 16, it starts producing 1 Re-Energy every hour. So, no need to buy them, except for the discount daily ones.
Optimally, save some for Consoles if you want further permanent stat bonuses. Consoles are required for the Recycling Room, which allow upgrading the attack and health of Nikkes, events will also reward Consoles in exchange for event drops.

25. How can I tell if I've already received friend points from someone ?
You have to manually click the left heart (Heart<â€”) to see if they did or did not.

26. Does it matter which Nikkes you send out on dispatches? And how many times can you dispatch per 24 hours?
No, and that depends on your Infrastructure Core. Leveling up the Infrastructure Core gives you more Dispatches, you start off with only two dispatches per day.

27. How to level up the Infrastructure Core?
Completing challenge missions, and progressing through the campaign.

28. How do I unlock more slots for Synchro Device?
Do the lessons in the Academy.

## Guns

- Shotguns: Close range, concentrated splash damage, average magazine capacity. Fast reload speed for needing to reload a lot, can do it multiple times at once. Very suitable for breaking the shield of enemies, and killing a close group of nearby enemies at once.
- SMG/Sub-Machine Guns: Short range, large magazine capacity, very fast firing rate. Low damage, but short reload time. Machine Gun's cousin, but is more concentrated to dealing fast damage to a single enemy, and moving to the next.
- Machine Guns: Mid-range, The fastest shooter type. Long-range, large ammunition magazines. Longer reload time. All-rounder, more suited for killing swarms of enemies.
- Snipers: Long range, single target, piercing, can be charged to deal higher damage. Medium reload speed. Can interrupt big attacks with a well-placed shot, and deal big damage on weak spots.
- Assault Rifles: Mid-range weapon, versatile and able to reload quickly. Perfectly sits on all-rounder.

The gun types can still hit enemies that are further than their range, but they will receive damage and accuracy penalties. The same applies to Snipers, on hitting close-range enemies.
Rocket Launchers have no range restriction, but have travel time.
