Mari woke up in her bed, only registering the pounding headache that threatened to split her skull in two.
*Oww...oh...aagh...* Mari started to cry from how much it hurt. Thinking hurt too much. Everything hurt. She forced herself up and rushed into the bathroom, taking some headache medicine from a cabinet. Once she did, Mari collapsed on the floor. She laid there, shivering in pain.
After what felt like years, the pain ebbed enough for her to think.

Mari's face lit up like a firestorm
*WHAT-WAS-WHA-*
What kind of a dream did she have?! Why did she have that?! She-what-
Mari slapped herself in the face. *No! That was NOT okay! Bad, sick Mari! What would they think if-*
And with that her headache came back in full force, causing her to let out a cry of pain.
*Oh-ouch, fuck-agh...* Mari gave up and stayed down.
She closed her eyes, which seemed to help her feel better.
Much better...
Enough that she falls asleep on the cold bathroom floor...
...slowly...tired...
