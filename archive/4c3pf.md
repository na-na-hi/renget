"*THEY'RE GOING ON **ARCADE DATES**?*" Minnie screeched.
"*ONE HANDMADE PLUSH A DAY?*" Edie echoed.
"Nope." Max shot to her feet. Tugging Faith's phone out of her grip, she locked it and tossed it to the sofa as the other girl squealed. "Nope. Nope. Nope. I can't sit there and watch you break your own heart again."
"It *is* cute, though." Faith sighed, rolling on her back as she stared dreamily at the ceiling. "Him and Sagara make a cute couple."
"You need to learn to be selfish for once, Faith," Hailey said. She, Minnie and Edie were typing furiously as the conversation on Inigo's makeshift groupchat continued. "Fuck Sagara! And fuck Suzuki, though that's a given." Leaving her phone suspended in the air, she climbed onto the couch and thrust one small fist towards the ceiling. "Pull yourself together! Go. Confront the problem. Fight! Win!"
There was a brief silence, interrupted only by the sound of Max unlocking her phone and dashing out a quick message. A few seconds later, Edie's head snapped up. "Hey, what was that for?"
"It was a genuine question! Her profile doesn't have any information at all! It's like my eyes just slide off it."
Edie groaned in disgust. "The groupchat's ruined. Myoga's gonna go on about Nyoro for an hour."
Minnie set her phone down. "Okay, I could be chatting with Bobby-"
"Sexting," Max chirped. Minnie ignored her.
"-but this is way more important." She grabbed the ornamental calendar on the coffee table and flipped to August before spinning it around to face Faith. "See this? Summer festival's coming up. Now, here's what I'm thinking..."

Hailey was drying her hands off on her monogrammed handkerchief when she fell into step beside Minnie and Faith. "Did you manage to catch Cain?"
"Wasn't he with you?"
"He and Suzuki were already here when I reached." Hailey scowled as she summoned her handbag with a flick of her wrist. "Didn't even glance at Faith before they flew off. Even when we put in so much work into styling her. Asshole." Lifting her head, she squinted into the night. "...And now they're gone."
Edie joined them as they crossed the grass patch, cutting a straight path towards Max and the guy from the convenience store. "Did you manage to speak to Cain?"
Faith shook her head glumly. They were silent for a while. Then:
"Hey, H. Did Max come here with the guy from the convenience store?"
"Why're you asking me? I was busy saving people from, like, literally drowning themselves-"
"*Have fun working security, asshole*," Max shouted.

No sooner had they piled into the convertible than Max gave Faith a savage noogie. Edie snorted.
"Ow! What was that for?"
"You couldn't think of *anything* to say?" Max demanded. "*It's an E-reader with books you might like*. That's it? Not even an *I'm glad you're okay*?"
Faith's mouth opened and closed. "T-the room was too crowded, okay? And Sagara was there! What if I-"
"Okay, it's time for the nuclear option."
Minnie narrowed her eyes. "What nuclear option?"
Hailey shrugged. "I'll ask Hifumi to ask Cain."
"They've barely spoken."
"Then you can ask Samson."
"Fine. You ask Takeda, I'll ask Bobby."
"Could try Myoga," Edie suggested.
"Myoga and his big mouth? I'm pretty sure he thinks Cain'd be better with Sagara."
"Why not get Soujyuuro to read Cain's mind or something?" Max piped up.
"Don't you, like, hate his guts because he mind-raped you?"
"Hey, it's the path of least resistance."
"Except he's probably going to refuse."
"It's literally just relationship stuff! Nothing significant. I'd kill for a quirk like that..."
As the others started to bicker, Faith sighed and turned to stare out the window.

Hailey checked her watch.
"Should we just go to your place?" Edie asked.
Hailey shook her head. "Maybe once Minnie and Max get here." She groaned. "I shouldn't have repeated what Cain said about Sagara."
"I mean, nothing against Sagara, and nothing against Cain," Edie agreed, arms folded. "But still."
"Yeah."
"Yeah."
Hailey checked her watch again, then followed Edie as she carried a steaming mug of hot chocolate into Faith's room. The girl in question was huddled up on her bed, staring blankly into space. Realistically, Hailey knew that Faith couldn't be happy all the time, but she'd known the other girl for years, and while she did cry sometimes, the last time she'd been this miserable had been in middle school, when that guy had moved to South Dakota. Hopefully Edie's hot chocolate would work its magic a second time.
They sat in silence for a while until Minnie and Max let themselves in. When they appeared in the door, Edie blinked. "What's that?"
Minnie looked down at the massive, A2-sized board that she and Max were carrying. "Uh, it's Max's evidence wall."
"For what?" Hailey demanded. "How fucking tone-deaf can you be?"
"It's about Cain's relationship with Desolator," Max said. "Look, Minnie joked that maybe he'd killed Cain's mom, so I did some research, and then one thing led to another. I don't have, like, a definitive answer yet, but-"
"I want to look at it," Faith said.
Max and Minnie put the board down and joined the others on Faith's bed. They sat there for a while.
