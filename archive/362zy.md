\>humans live for no time
\>you were a youngling then, all those endless days ago
\>you were born in the mortal plane
\> your father was a full-blood demon and your mother was a human
\>she was taken away when you were young
\>but you were able to escape, your claws could easily cut through the mortals armor
\>You could sense their life force, making them easy to pick off
\>when you got out, you fled
\>you wandered the forests, coming upon people
\>you grew to like people
\>they wern't like those mean men in suits who hurt you
\>you explored the cities at night
\>and came upon a mortal with a notably darkened life force
\>you could tell it would not be long before his will to live dies
\>in those first weeks, burned into your memory like a hot iron
\>he was scared at first, that dark aura being replaced by fear at your lizard-like form
\>but soon he learned you merely wanted to be friends
\>you could understand any language, but he sadly could not understand the hisses and clicks you made
\>you became his best friend
\>at his work place you helped him learn to work more efficiently
\>you helped him carry home his devices and food
\>you enjoyed many a meal in the soft light of a non magic lightbulb
\>as he grew up you didn't change
\>you didn't know why
\>soon enough he got a female in his life
\>but he always made time for you
\>when he had kin with her and she left only a few years later, he was decimated
\>he cried into your chest for hours, regularly falling asleep in your arms
\>you did not know why mortals cried
\>you just knew you game him comfort, and that made you feel good
\>even more years past, his hair gaining a couple streaks of gray
\>you saw humans of all kinds of different colors and with all different kinds of "hair" so you merely marveled at you best friends capability to change color as well
\>in the years since his mates absence, he has grown to view you as such a mate
\>you learned many things about yourself and your body 
\>but as time continued and you stayed the same, he kept changing
\>his skin grew looser
\>his body was not as fast or as strong
\>his beautiful mind was dulled
\>it only grew worse as well
\>you thought he was just sick, as he has been many times before
\>you thought he would get better
\>but he got worse
\>his hair was silver by now, your enjoyment of it's color now gone
\>he moved like he was in pain with every step,every breath
\>more time went and he was gone
\>no life left
\>you watched that night as it flickered like fire in the wind, and went out
\>You cried for the first time that night
\>hard and sloppy, you shook him endlessly, tried every way you knew to bring him back
\>they found him a couple days later, and he was put into the ground, from whence he came
\>you cried for him for years, centuries, eons
\>your hatred of yourself for being unable to save him, your yearning to keep something, any part of him alive you could
\>you relived every second of your time with him
\>all the years and such a gentle loving creature was taken from this world, given a curse unbreakable
\>and then you knew why 
\>you knew why mortals cried
\>because humans live for no time
