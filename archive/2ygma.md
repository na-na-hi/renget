Nikolai and Adam had recovered slowly since the explosive night a few weeks ago. Dominic even came to check on his packmate and make sure he wasn't slumped in his emotions. If he had to say the right words for it, it was as if Adam was a wolf without a pack. The comfort of the alpha only went so far when even Nick could sense insincerity in his greetings.

As for himself the alpha wasn't very kind or willing to try and be kind anymore. His accidental stunt all but burned the bridge and made the chances of the pack accepting his plan less than slim. All the odds were against him but the camera set-up would make sure they couldn't be suspicious. No taint, no lies, only truth that even their leader could vouch for.

Sadly no self boost of confidence would make approaching Dominic any easier.

After a minute of reluctant waiting, he managed a few light taps on the doorframe. Quiet to anyone else yet booming to the highly refined hearing of the alpha. Said alpha didn't so much answer as he did swipe the door's tiny window curtain aside like a grumpy old man down the street. Multiple latches clicked loose and Nikolai was met with the mountainous build of his body.

"What," the alpha stated in a crabby tone.

"May I come in?", Nick asked a bit shyly.

"..You may."

Nikolai took notice of the well kept and tidy environment. Some hunting trophies adorned the wall, all local but nothing truly impressive like a bear. Everything was about as normal as the other cabins, even the furniture was plain. The only expensive thing he spotted was a hot tub out on a deck, currently steaming out into the cold air.

"Don't mind that, I'm gonna relax."

Dominic casually stripped in front of him before dipping into the tub. Nick looked up out of respect and assumed the happy sigh was an all clear to look down. Turns out Dominic was only stretching before fully enjoying the water. Nikolai decided to get over himself as he watched the Alpha's dick float a moment before being submerged. 

He glared at the smug alpha a moment before rolling his eyes.

"If you're done, I have a question."

"Alright."

"Can you… er, help me fortify the blind spots so they can't get in as easy? You know, cameras and some barb wiring?"

Dominic hummed as he sunk more in the tub. Nikolai thought it odd he wasn't in his wolf form, but then the idea came that fur and hot tubs wouldn't mix well. Probably just better to just leave his regular self out.

"You got a reason to keep staring at me?", Dominic asked.

….

"I'm waiting for you to answer me," Nikolai firmly stated, not sure what he was implying, not at all.

"Fair enough. We're a little more casual about nudity around here, but you're well aware of that by now, aren't you? No, do not undress," Dominic said as he flexed his arms behind himself.

"So will you help me?"

Dominic got up and stood himself at the side closest to Nikolai. The water had glued some of the hair together and only illustrated the man's strength. A massive chest and abs, arms too, even the shoulders and his thighs were mounds of beef. A beefcake through and through.

Being an alpha wolf mattered little to one's age. Some of it was so tightly packed together that it might as well have been called fur. The way the water ran down him-

Nikolai did a little shake of his head and refocused on the man's face.

"Heh, had my doubts but Adam isn't just a one off," Dominic settled back in.

"What's that supposed to mean?!"

"Means yes. I'll help you with the perimeter. I'll be going into town to get some supplies, try not to get yourself in more trouble. Oh and," Dominic tilted his head down, "You should tuck that thing away, hunter."

It took him a moment of embarrassed realization to understand what he referred to.

"*Fuck*!"

Nick closed his legs and tried to think of something to say. No excuse came to mind, and that damn alpha was laughing his ass off about it.

"It's fine, Nick. Come by later today, I'll be ready."

"F-for what."

Nick didn't know if he'd meant the cameras or if he had meant something more.

"The perimeter reinforcement? What else did you think?"

Nikolai made haste as the alpha howled (no pun intended) with laughter across the campsite. If luck was on his side that little incident wouldn't become common knowledge. He'd already embarrassed himself enough lately. 

The brown one named John was in the back of his head after their small tussle.

In all the chaos and bitter moods he hadn't apologized yet. By coincidence said wolf was heading to the same intersection of their trail accompanied by his companion wolf. John's muzzle immediately curled badly at his approach, veering left and heading towards the tree at the center of their camp. The more feral one picked up on what his larger friend ignored and stood the human down. 

"Hey, uh… John, do you have a moment?"

"The hell do you want?", the wolf replied, stalling but not turning to face him.

"To say I'm sorry."

"Fuck off," he growled out.

"For attacking you. And this pack. Making everyone feel like they weren't safe anymore. And…", the next part felt hard to say even if he could admit it.

"And?", John's head slightly began to turn round.

"For scaring your boyfriend a few months ago. Insulting you all and thinking you were monsters and just… yeah."

Nikolai knew there was more but that covered most of his crimes towards them. John was towering over him in moments, a low warning sounding from his throat. A few hostile barks were let out from his friend but he would stand his ground.

'Just relax,' Nikolai thought.

"Sorry doesn't quite cut it, asshole. Just because you're dating one werewolf doesn't mean we all should trust you. Did you even mean what you said about trying to protect us? Or do you still think Adam is the only wolf worth saving?"

"You don't even care about him-"

"*Shut your goddamn mouth*!", John snarled out, "Of course I care, you just don't care about the rest of us."

"How would you know? Even before that fight none of you seemed eager to talk."

"How do ya plan to change my mind, tea or something?", John curled up his fist.

"No! I just…. I've been training Adam how to fight better. Stuff that helps him learn how to defend himself in case another hunter attacks. If you wanted to, you could come to some of those classes. Adam will be with us if you don't wanna be alone with me."

"Hmph. So…what's to stop me from whoopin' *your ass* back to bed?", John asked, amused at the thought.

"Try it, I can still flip you to the ground. I took a few others on easily and even kept up with Dominic. And that was just when I felt like I had no choice."

John growled at that reminder.

"But if you stop by, you'll learn how to do that to me," Nick gave his own smug grin, "And even if you don't wanna be friends you'd still come out of it better prepared for other hunters."

"Let's say I decide to show up to this lil gatherin'. You're not using this as an excuse to fight me again, right? Cause I don't plan to lose again," John knelt to face him and stared the human down.

Nick sighed, "Get used to losing, until you learn how to counter it I'll be the one flipping you on your ass. I know you hate me, but at the very least we can cooperate for something like this. At least give it a try because some defense is better than nothing."

"Deal. When do you have a lesson planned?"

"Tomorrow, we usually do it at 3 in the afternoon."

"See you then, shithead, and mark my words I'll have you on your ass by the end of it," John gave him a nod and almost left.

"Wait!"

"Oh Jesus, what?", the wolf annoyedly asked.

"I don't think you or him want me to try and say it in person, but can you… can you tell your boyfriend I'm sorry for scaring him?"

"Well, you're right that I don't. Lee may not either but he spoke up in your defense a few nights ago. Seems he thinks you're trying to turn to us, or somethin'. I'll let him know, but don't expect us to be your pals."

John whistled his wolf back to his side and while the beast seemed to distrust Nikolai, it obeyed the command.

"Yeah that's… about what I expect."

He let out a sigh of relief, he'd actually convinced Lee he wasn't the same anymore. And without even directly talking to him. Someday he might even have a chance to speak directly. That is if the other human didn't see him as some frightening warrior.

Nick brushed through some branches as he approached his cabin, wondering if Adam had left to do anything. There his boyfriend was, still playing video games to distract himself and avoid the rest of the pack. Unlike the wolf's usual appetite he actually hadn't eaten very much. Maybe tea and a snack but that was it.

"Hey handsome…", he cuddled up to his favorite pillow.

"Oh! Hey Nick, I didn't see you come in," the wolf was almost beaming.

It didn't seem as bright as before but any smile was better than no smile at all.

"Are you ok?", he asked while scratching his wolf's belly.

"Yeah! I'm just, uh.. finishing this level."

"You just beat that game two days ago," Nikolai pointed out.

Part of the training for his previous job that he no longer liked to associate with was to notice particular details for an individual. Adam wasn't one to just replay games so quickly, he went through his stack by order not by favorability. So to find that not all the games were distracting enough was concerning.

"Yeah! Yeah it's just.. I think I missed something. I wanna see everything here."

His smile was gone as quickly as it had come. Pausing and pointing out the percentage in a corner of the screen.

"See? I found something new. Now it's higher."

Nikolai could tell he was lying but wouldn't press on it for now. Not unless this became a problem of sitting in all day. Neither had directly said it but they weren't sure if the pack was ready to take him back in.

"So I spoke to Dominic earlier. He and I are gonna try to set up some safety measures, if you wanna come along."

"I'm ok."

"Oh, and…"

"And?"

Awkward moment of truth…

"Dominic made me talk while he was in a hot tub. At some point he stood up and, I don't know how, but I got stiff. Not nervous stiff, but, well, y'know.."

"Oh yeah that happens to me too, he's a total dilf."

That term made him raise a brow.

"You.. don't mind that it happened?", Nikolai asked, making sure he wasn't going crazy.

"Nah, Dominic is a stud! It'd be weirder if you somehow didn't get hard. Did you think I wanted to keep you to myself?"

"Uh, *yeah*," Nick replied in a somewhat offended tone.

"I haven't slept with anyone else. I know this is all new to you, babe. I figured someday you may develop certain urges that aren't frowned on here, and we can take it from there. Not that anyone really wants to sleep with either of us right now…", Adam sighed and decided to quit his game for the moment.

"I.. I'm not sure how I should take this. Do you normally sleep with others?"

"Sometimes. But um, not since we started dating…"

'Darn those sad ears', he thought.

Nikolai coughed, "W-well, I forgot you werewolves do things a bit differently. I don't know if I should jump into that just yet. Dominic seemed to enjoy teasing me, I'm not sure why."

"Cause he secretly likes you too. Why else keep you around?" Adam scruffed up Nick's fiery mullet.

"No way…", Nick said, feeling hot all of a sudden.

"Hey Nick."

"Yeah?"

"You're blushiiing~", Adam pointed out in a dopey voice as his tail thumped.

"I am thinking of you. Only you. No amount of older, ripped men will-"

"Oh so *that's* some of your types!" Adam pounced and pinned him down.

"You are the type for me. And even if anything changes, I want you to be with me. You come first over everyone else," his hand reached up to pet him.

"But you usually come first."

Oh, now it was on.

Both put up a good wrestling effort but a few romantic kisses and a decent BJ later and they were laying in bed for a lot of the day. Nothing superb but he'd been very willing to practice with him. He wished this could be how they lived forever, no responsibility, just a bed and a home.

Four hours of cuddling later and he had to tear away from his big furry blanket after someone knocked on the door. They'd been knocking for three minutes and had resorted to constant ones in order to get one of them up. His partner let out a sad whine but relented after receiving a kiss. If it was this urgent then he might as well have gotten dressed.

Barely even two steps out of the door did he find himself facing the alpha. Still taller but much less threatening now that they'd gotten used to each other. Thankfully he was dressed this time, a repeat of that moment wouldn't help the tension.

"Is Adam ok?", Dominic asked with a glance into the door.

"As ok as he can be, I'm hoping to improve things by doing this. And the training could help too."

"Training?"

"Yeah, in case of more hunters. I want him and any other wolf to be ready, the problem is I can't exactly make them attend. You don't need to either but it'll help us be ready if anyone gets the wrong idea."

"Didn't plan on it, though I may suggest they can gang up on you during 'training'."

Nikolai wasn't sure how serious that was even with the laughs.

"So… to that fence?", he asked the alpha.

"Yeah."

Along their way to one of the areas not exactly well seen they passed by a cabin with two of the pack speaking with each other. Not in the typical sense, it seemed one of them was deaf. That one being a brown furred wolf with a head of black fur, though closer to black human hair in appearance. He was similar in build to Adam but a rounder belly, taller too.

The blonde colored wolf was smaller than the other, in fact hardly bigger than Lee even in shifted form. Wolves came in all sizes but that didn't limit their strength so he wouldn't try anything to piss him off.

Upon spotting Nikolai they changed topics.

(Seems he's trying to look better), the blonde one signed.

(Dominic's making him useful), the brown and black furred one responded.

(My idea), Nikolai signed, getting a shocked response from them.

"Since when did you-", the blonde wolf began.

(I'm sorry. Shouldn't have acted bad), Nick continued but was coldly rebuffed.

"Stop. Don't talk to us, don't think about us. C'mon Bryce," the small one took his partner's hand.

Bryce nodded to his mate, but looked to Nikolai for a lingering moment. Was he.. smiling? Even if just for a spare few seconds? No, just Nikolai feeling too eager to be accepted in the pack while his eyes played tricks on him.

"Didn't think you hunters would make use of that language," Dominic said as he walked beside him.

"Hey, some people can have hearing aids. Or be deaf. Call the hunters killers if you want to but at least they don't discriminate," Nikolai tried to say.

"Is that your idea of a joke? My fallen kin is funny to you?", Dominic began with a growl.

"N-no, no of course not, I-"

"Aaaah, I'm just fuckin with you. But really, don't try to be funny like that."

"Understood, sir."

Near the edges of the territory seemed as good a place as any to start setting up spots. A few other wolves of the pack occasionally passed them by but not to talk. Or walk either since they had a near snails pace. Nick thought that he would have to teach them how to be more subtle about spying. 

He knew there was one lesser known and rare method called 'using binoculars'.

And some of the wolves, well, they didn't look familiar at all. Maybe they were just extra security after that false flag. 

"Hey Dominic…who are those wolves there?", he asked.

"Loan wolves."

"Lone? Like alone?"

"No, loan as in lending their help. They don't live in a pack but they assist with packs and thus we extend our protection to them."

"But why don't they live here?", Nick strung up more wiring as he spoke.

"Wolves on their own are pack animals. But werewolves? Not every werewolf can get along in a pack, even with a social urge, or they may not even want to. John was like that for a while but we knew he'd come back one day. He just brought along his little boyfriend too, stupid as that seemed to me."

"Why is that?", Nick asked.

Dominic sighed, "Open your ears, I just said they're not-"

"Not the wolves. About John's boyfriend. Why do you think that's stupid?"

"Lee, well, Lee just met John as his wolf by chance. But he'd been treating him like a fetish. This fantasy come true. He wasn't doing everything he could to appeal to the wolf side."

"So he's not the greatest fit but a former hunter is?" Nikolai wondered.

"You got something to say? Say it then," the alpha growled.

"You-", Nick sighed and stepped off the ladder.

"Look, I'm really grateful you let me in your territory. That you let me stay here and you're giving me a chance. But if anyone deserves that chance, that's Lee, he didn't expose you and he didn't take it badly."

"You wouldn't get it. Stay out of it."

Despite a warning growl Nick felt compelled to stand up for that guy.

"What don't I get? He's-", Nick was yanked forward by the scruff of his shirt.

"You are extremely lucky that I didn't kill you on the spot when you attacked us. And you haven't seen or heard what happens to our kind. There are people that trick others into a false sense of safety. Oh, but maybe you *have* heard of it, considering you took part in that shit. So shut your goddamn mouth and set up the goddamn cameras!", the alpha ordered with a partial shift and wolven eyes.

Nikolai gulped and waited for the man to set him down. He'd keep it in mind not to touch on this nerve in the future. As angry as he'd been, the alpha let his features go as he reverted to a human. He set a hand on his shoulder and sighed.

"I…I will do *anything* to protect my pack. We took a chance on you. Maybe you're right that Lee deserves a better chance, but for now let me process this."

"Ok.."

They didn't talk much after that outburst from the alpha. He knew it wasn't his place to question a pack leader's decision but it felt off to see Lee that way. Did he treat him that way too? That other human had done nothing at all.

It was Nikolai that attacked them.

And now he was paying the price by putting security up while Dominic guarded. He had absolutely no intention of running away but the alpha probably couldn't be too sure. A few leaves rustled behind him but he was too busy getting the camera in to care.

"Well, look who it is," Dominic said.

Nikolai turned round and found Bryce had interrupted their camera set up with a wave. The wolf looked fondly towards the alpha but seemed unsure how to see Nikolai. After what happened earlier, the ex hunter thought it best to just politely nod and get back to work.

There was silence as he turned his back to them and continued to place it in a subtle spot. He wondered how many others had learned sign language for the wolf.

"Ok Nikolai, seems like I can get back to my work. Bryce here has decided to be your partner for today," Dominic said.

"What?", Nikolai asked as he turned back around from his ladder.

There was the wolf from earlier, dressed in some warm clothes and some of a mechanic outfit.

"You and him can get the rest of the cameras set up and begin on the fence. It may take a week before it's all done, but he wants to judge your character for himself. Don't fuck it up," Dominic said.

"Oh and if you touch a hair on his head I'll rip your fucking head off."

"N-no plans to," Nikolai spoke with a bit of fear.

Bryce waved the alpha goodbye and stood near the ladder. He seemed to reach his height just as a wolf. Nikolai stared at his face and wondered how his eyes looked. It was so shaggy on top they'd hidden anything aside from maybe a flash or a glimpse.

It looked surprisingly good on him.

(Hey), he signed to the wolf.

(Hi. Need help?)

(Yes. Thank you), he reached his hand out to greet him.

Well, tried to shake his hand, instead he managed to slip off the ladder in the process. He cursed as he fell but felt no pain. Rather he only felt the in and out breathing of Bryce who had saved him from more injury. Falling on his still healing body wouldn't help and thank god this wolf was here to help.

For a moment he thought he saw a glint of green under the hair. It wasn't anything special but some part of his head wanted to get a look at them again. Even just another brief flash to confirm the color.

(Ready?), the wolf signed.

(Yeah. Thank you. Again.)

A paw brushed him off and pat his head and for a few seconds Nick swore he could see a smile. It was probably nothing more than a polite checkup but it made him feel funny. Like he both enjoyed it but didn't really deserve that from him.

(You ok?)

No, Nick wasn't exactly ok. Here was a wolf that decided to help him on something that was more of a one man effort. And their small bond was built on nothing more than knowing how to talk to him.

(Nervous?), it's paws signed.

(Yes)

(Don't worry, I trust you), the wolf pulled apart some of the hair and winked with his green eye.

But it was blue as well, almost purely blue except for that green dot. He thought it looked very nice.

It would be cute on Adam but on Bryce it was nice.

Just that.

They had work to do so he stopped thinking on it.

(Let's get started, shall we?), it asked.

Nikolai explained some of the basics for how to tie a camera to a tree. Some of them closer to the compound would be wired directly to a building. Some would be remote but take a picture for any image that had movement. Any sort of blur be it an animal or human wouldn't be missed by this.

While the remote ones weren't as effective as live feeds, they'd serve well as a warning. Bryce spoke nothing as they went from tree to tree.

For someone that only just learned about this he was a fast worker. Faster than him in fact since he seemed to be doing most of the setup work. All he did was read the instructions once or twice and now it was almost second nature. Maybe he shouldn't have been too surprised since he showed up in workers gear.

The wolf was even mindful of the best spots and making sure nothing would get in the way. In one instance he had to bend down to set up a camera. Muscles flexed as he tightened a band around a tree. The pants stretched around the more muscular aspects and his eyes gravitated to his behind.

Why was he even looking there?

"Goddamn it."

Bryce swung his head at what sounded like an issue. Nick smiled and waved, signing an excuse that he dropped something. The wolf sniffed the air and hardened his muzzle a moment but ultimately shrugged it off. Better that way to relieve his head.

'Too close, dummy. You have Adam to look at you pervert', he thought.

By the end of the day they'd already set up more than half of the workload he'd planned for the day. Tomorrow they would set up the final two on some outskirts and begin with the fence posts. A larger hammer would be what he normally used but maybe he could convince the wolf to just push them in the ground on his own.

With supervision, of course.

Another thought suddenly crossed his head.

Bryce heard him earlier. And earlier than that he seemed like was actually talking to that other wolf.

"Bryce?", Nick asked.

The wolf looked ready at attention for whatever he needed.

"You can hear me?"

Bryce nodded and began to explain himself some with his paws. Apparently he had anxiety with regular talking for whatever reason. With sign language he could get the point across and have no need to explain more.

(Should I still talk this way?) Nick asked.

(Not always necessary. Very appreciated.)

Whatever reason he didn't like talking normally was probably deeper than just "anxiety". But if he didn't want to explain in detail then that was the wolf's choice. It saddened Nikolai though about whatever happened that made him this way. 

Bryce was a very kind person to even be helping him after everything Nick had done.

(Think we should stop?)

(Yeah, I'll head back), Nick hopped off and gathered up his tools.

His partner pulled up the box of the cameras and even snatched the toolbox. His head motioned for the hopefully honorary pack member to follow. 

Adam could wait just a bit longer, so no harm in following Bryce home.

"Hey, why not let me carry that and we talk on the way back? I'll say it and you sign it," Nikolai offered.

Bryce seemed to think over it, and agreed with an abrupt drop of everything into Nick's arms. He stumbled a moment before getting used to the weight and began their walk.

"You've been with the pack very long?", he asked.

(3 years.)

"And that blonde wolf is your husband?"

"Connor," the wolf said, (And yes. Don't be surprised, I can still speak.)

"N-not at all, the voice matches you though. Big and strong, right big guy?"

(Maybe. Just don't like how it sounds.)

"Ah my bad. I'll try not to ask anything that needs that of you."

One thumbs up and they managed to strike up a good conversation. Most of it was readable to Nick but sometimes it got lost in translation. Bryce said the word and motion to correct him but still mostly kept quiet. Other than the few hiccups it seemed they got along well and his friend-

Friend.

"Hey Bryce, um… do you trust me a bit more after today?"

(Yes)

"Could we be.. associates?", he scratched his head.

(Like friends?)

"M-maybe, I just don't know if you want that. Or if you're ready for that, I uh-"

(We can be friends. It's ok.)

"Uh.. good to know! That's good, that's…a relief, um…"

(You know how I talk. I respect that. You want to help us. I respect that more. You can become a good person.)

"Ah, well, long way to go!", he nervously laughed.

(You'll get there), a paw rustled with his fiery hair.

He blushed somehow but hoped the wolf didn't notice. After that they spent the last two minutes in silence. Connor was waiting for them and had a look of contempt at the former hunter. Which he didn't blame on the wolf for the former profession mentioned.

Bryce took the box inside and came back to speak with Connor. Earlier he'd been more receptive but this conversation Nikolai was asked to turn around for. He didn't hear much other than a growl from one of them and an answering one in return. Followed by a whine as though he, probably Connor, conceded.

"Ok, you can look now," said wolf told him.

(Thanks for helping), Nick signed with a smile and a wave.

(Yeah. We'll do more tomorrow.) Bryce replied, shyly waving goodbye as he stepped in his cabin.

"See you in a minute, ok?", Connor said as he welcomed him in.

Bryce nodded and brushed past him, the blonde wolf fondly watching him depart a moment. Evidently he still had business to discuss with Nikolai, why else would he linger? Anger wasn't quite the word to say it, more like an annoyance aimed towards the elephant in the room. Eyes warning him not to fuck with them.

"Hey uh, if you don't want me to work with him, I can just-"

"It's ok. You only just met Bryce, but I will always trust his judgement of someone. He tends to see people exactly how they are, he's never been wrong. It's rare he warms up to someone to speak directly, and I didn't expect it for a person like *you*."

Nick nodded in reply, feeling bad but wanting to let him continue.

"Even so. If you do anything to hurt him I will put you in the ground. Don't think I'm only warning you, that's a promise," the wolf narrowed his eyes with the last few words.

"The… the last thing I want is to mess up again. I need to get back to my cabin, um, Adam probably wants dinner soon.."

"Go on then. Don't forget what I've said, Bryce is important and he's your only other friend that isn't Adam."

Nick spun and walked off with an awkward feeling in the air. He'd expected other wolves not to trust him and he had a feeling Connor still didn't exactly trust him entirely. 

Maybe enough to keep an open mind but that was the thing about open minds. If needed it could be closed off to him.

The next few days of work didn't involve much talking. Bryce pushed down the posts with his fists and helped set up the wire, and Nick couldn't stop focusing on him just shoving them in the ground. Here and there they would set up a gate to let any of their less sentient wolves out to hunt. But those little gates also had a camera set up to be sure no one else used them.

Sometimes they'd talk for a while after sundown, sometimes not. Connor began tolerating him a bit more, even asking if he needed water one night. No thanks, he'd said, feeling a bit guilty but appreciating the offer. Other wolves would pass them by and murmur about whatever gossip Nick could think of.

Was he there to help?

Was this a trap for them?

Had Bryce gone *crazy*?

Slowly but surely he would build up their trust so that this didn't happen. So that one day a wolf didn't need to care if it was seen with him. Or care that it was friends with him. But he'd had enough thoughts about that, there was work to do.

Every day of those two weeks they would get so lost in the process that it usually took a mutual noise of growling stomachs to halt them. Today went a bit longer as the sun wasn't just high over their heads but into its downward curve by then. As expected their bodies growled out to get something to eat already.

(Hungry?), Bryce signed with a smile.

(Yeah.), Nick agreed. 

He almost went back home for dinner were it not for a paw grabbing his shoulder.

(We're making food.), his new friend said and waved him along.

Nikolai hadn't expected an invitation for that, but it wouldn't feel right to leave Adam out.

(I think Adam wanted to-)

(He is there too.), Bryce reassured, then took his hand as they walked. 

That didn't carry the same emotions of Adam doing so but Nick still felt warmth rush through his body.

Did Bryce think of him as part of the pack?

A bond he had struggled to forge with anyone other than Adam and only just rebuilding with the alpha. The wolf had seemingly been charmed by the prerequisite ASL, even if it wasn't the best at times. Strength was hiding behind the wolf's paw, though the bigger concern was the sweat Nikolai felt over his body after their hard days work.

Werewolves took in smells much differently than humans. Not just deciding a smell is bad, but assaulting their senses in several ways that Nick could only hear of rather than experience. Someone like his own partner may not have minded the ripe smell, or possibly Bryce, but Connor wouldn't appreciate stinking up his cabin. 

And how would that small but likely powerful wolf react to this gesture? Holding his partner's hand like this was new to him, like many wolf things. That said, he didn't feel inclined to let go. 

Near the beginning of his relationship, it was explained it wasn't just cuddling, but many intimate gestures. Sometimes the wolf traits would occur as well which Nikolai regularly experienced as fond licks from Adam. And a bit more personally when his partner didn't just make love to him but obsessed over what was probably scent marking. Not just his boyfriend, but his in any way possible.

Odd, but cute.

…Not odd.

Normal.

Welcome.

There was no good reason to keep judging them. Even if he was slightly weirded out, he'd had plenty of time to get used to this. Going on two months now that he could determine their behaviors and he was still thinking the way he was.

But for the life of him, he couldn't explain why.

(What's wrong?), Bryce asked as they stopped by the stairs.

The look on his face was only worry for the sake of his new friend.

"I-I don't know how to say it yet but, thank you Bryce. For giving me a chance, and.. and…"

Crying? Why was he? It was only a few sniffs but as Bryce hugged him tight and let him cry into his chest, Nikolai felt so much relief pour out. 

Joy, anger at himself, the safety for the group, so many things pushing him to release. He hesitated but soon gave in and pushed himself deeper in the wolf's shirt. Uncaring of the sweat, Bryce had begun grooming him as if to say he was there, no need to worry, no need to be turned away. 

Rusty hinges creaked as the front door almost flew open and out came Connor with his boyfriend close behind. The small wolf seemed confused but let them do this despite dimmer waiting.

Adam joined in the hug whilst licking away the tears.

"Are you ok?", he softly asked him.

"I'm…I'm fine, I just…. I'm happy I can be here, that's all…", Nick sniffed, wiping away the tears.

"We're having grilled cheese, do you like tomato soup?", Connor asked.

"Yeah. I'm not picky.."

"C'mon in then, you two must have worked up a big appetite."

Tomato soup usually wasn't something special for Nick, but this recipe far outdid what they used to serve in a hunters cafeteria. That or maybe he was just too used to subpar quality and average meals were enough to impress him. 

Under human dinners the amount of grilled cheese would be concerning, but not with Adam and Bryce scarfing them down. Just as a bit of a cheat he himself took a few more than a strict diet would allow. Connor didn't quite dig in like they did but seemed content with his soup and half a sandwich.

While they ate he got to learn a bit more about this couple and how they met. Something else was left unsaid regarding the circumstances of Bryce joining, but he figured it wasn't his business to ask. Connor had asked him how he enjoyed settling into the pack, he thought it funny to use that term.

"I uh… wanna work on my reputation. So far Adam has taken to me, Dominic almost seems like he's beginning to take to me. John agreed to attend some of my combat classes so he could learn how to kick my ass, more or less."

"Combat?", Connor seemed concerned, maybe thinking it meant attack training.

"Well, more self defense against hunters. So that what happened when I stormed in doesn't happen again."

(We could go), Bryce signed, his partner nodding an agreement.

"That we could."

Nikolai explained the details of where to meet and what they'd be going over. It would be a step by step process of exercise and basic defense but moving up when they were ready. As it was only Adam before, they'd be restarting some of the beginners stuff for the newcomers.

Speaking of whom, Nick couldn't help but watch him for the rest of the dinner. All it took was time for him to get his friends back on his side. Time could heal a lot of wounds, even the wound of him daring to assault the pack. He didn't know for sure if he'd been forgiven, or that they could forget it, but if he could prove himself different then that was enough.

"Are you coming to the pile tonight, Adam?", Connor brightly asked.

Adam's ears went flat and he paused as though he'd suddenly lost his appetite. An awkward silence continued for a good twenty seconds til Adam responded. No words but rather a sad whine with a shake of his head.

"We um…. Think he needs to wait until the right moment to join everyone," Nikolai explained.

Bryce tilted his head in thought, snapping his fingers with a smile. What he proposed to Connor was very welcoming, and possibly a bit too fast.

A discussion occurred via their hands, about whether or not that would work and if he was ready to try that. Nick felt sorry for his partner who didn't know how to interpret this.

But Nikolai saw every word.

The suggestion to do something in the cabin.

(On the bed.)

(I'm not sure, maybe we shouldn't.)

(Yes, why not?)

(Is he ready for that?)

(Nick is ready.)

(Say he gets uncomfortable. Would you be able to handle that?)

(Yes.)

(And you're sure you want this?)

(Very.)

"What's wrong?", Adam asked, "D-did I…do something?"

"No, Adam. Bryce is just….", Nikolai was unsure to say anything.

"What?", the grey wolf said, less nervous but still on edge.

"Bryce wants to have a small cuddle pile. You didn't do anything wrong Adam, don't worry."

Connor had been the one to say it. There was a bit of dishonesty in his tone but mostly it was true. He probably didn't like who the grey wolf chose to be with, but that was settled and done.

Adam's tail swished with hope yet still didn't quite transform into its rapid wagging. The energy lacked confidence after it had been robbed of him. Nikolai had been enough company but an undeniable need for a pack was obvious in his face. Most wolves needed a pack for the social bonds, and even those few that lived on their own could make small connections.

Nikolai's wolf though, his wolf had been through a lot of shit in life and came out smiling. Adam meant everything to him and he'd do anything to make him happy. He thought he deserved the world and nothing less than that, ever.

"Do you want me to go?", Nikolai asked.

"Up to you. It's on the table but if you're not ready, you can go."

"Stay, please," Bryce said, coughing and wringing his hands together.

The room was quiet and Adam's ears perked up from hearing him. Who knew he had such a convincing voice? Connor might not have understood it at all but where Bryce went he would follow. 

Nikolai himself didn't even think any of them could stand to think of him as part of that. Adam seemed he was just glad to have some of his friends back, even few over none.

"Before we do anything at all, you two…", Connor waved a spoon at Bryce and Nick, "Need a shower. Dinner covers up the smell but I won't let that ruin the bed. Take turns if you want but-"

"If they want~" Adam suggestively noted.

Connor rolled his eyes, "......If they take turns. It's just a shower."

"I don't know what you mean," he replied in the most innocent angel voice he could manage.

Nikolai hid behind his hands at their jokes. It was a bit of embarrassment but it was mainly for one other major reason.

He'd turned redder than his hair at the idea that others could possibly be attracted to him. So far it was just his boyfriend with eyes on him, and maybe Dominic but that felt like deliberate teasing to get a rise going.

The look Bryce was giving him right now made him think differently.

(We should get going), he signed with a wink.

"U-um..", Nikolai didn't really have a way to say no.

Well he could have, if he wanted to but why didn't he want to? That was the million dollar question.

Adam's tail thumped the floor while he looked between the two as though he knew some secret. And what secret? There was nothing in his head about him. Bryce was a friend. Just a big, gentle, admittedly kinda cute friend to him.

"Connor, we're not-"

"Look, I trust Bryce. He trusts you. Try not to make a mess in there."

"We…won't?", Nikolai replied.

"Say that more confidently next time, I don't want cum clogging up the pipes."

Nikolai slowly blinked at that remark.

"It's ok babe! Just use condoms- *Ow!* Hey, it was just a joke!", Adam was being pelted with pieces of a leftover sandwich.

As they walked Bryce shifted from wolf to human, hand in hand as they passed by some rooms. Their cabin was old but homely, like it was tapped from a different time and carefully preserved. With upgrades of course yet otherwise comfy and warm. 

His friend pulled him into the bathroom and as he began pulling his clothes off.

Bryce undressed first and though similar to Adam, he was just a bit bigger and had more muscle definition in the arms and chest. His thighs were especially impressive to him as they could flex with every movement. On the lower side though his belly was a bit more rounded out but just as hairy as the rest of the wolves. Darker skin than Adam but closer to Lee's skin so another Hispanic, if he took a guess.

Not a bad ass on him either.

And then those pretty green eyes caught him staring and flicked over to the shower as though saying to follow him in. Something about them was so warm and friendly that he couldn't help but do as he asked. As for the rest he wasn't going to try and look.

All he had to do was wash off with a friend, that was it.

Nothing lewd about that, about Bryce flexing an arm and wiping sweat off. Looking at his arms hardened with each shove down into the earth. Seeing him bend over sometimes and his ass straining against clothes.

'Damn it', he thought.

"Uh…Bryce, can you wash my back?"

Well fuck, he didn't say out loud.

This sort of scenario also happened to be on his mind but not right after dinner.

That damn thing wouldn't go down and thank god his shower partner hadn't noticed. Why did this always have to happen to him? If he just thought of other things, he would be about to outlast this.

Bryce continued washing him but…

Was he massaging him too?

The bastard was actually rubbing his back. And he seemed to really know what he was doing. In one movement the hands reached under his neck and brought soap there. 

Strong hands.

"*Mmm*," he grunted as he pressed a hand on the wall.

"What?" Bryce softly spoke, continuing to massage.

"Just.. feels nice. After a long day."

"Can I wash your front?", Bryce asked, sounding like he was enjoying this in other ways.

"Er… I'm ok, I can get that," Nikolai squeaked out, coughing and grabbing a bar of soap.

'Too close. Too fucking close.'

He tried to step forward but managed to slip on the floor. Right back into Bryce and right down onto the ceramic tiles. Unfortunately for him he still had a raging hard-on from showering with him. His friend only had a look of understanding as he helped him up, but not making him show that further.

"It's ok. Happens sometimes," Bryce said.

"I… I didn't mean to, and I don't want to disrespect you, or Connor, and-"

"I meant the slipping," Bryce laughed, knowing damn well what else it could mean.

"R-right," and with that he kept his mouth shut.

Bryce continued to wash but now remained a bit farther back. Nikolai had yet to wash his hair but didn't dare embarrass himself again by turning around. All he needed to do was back up and grab the shampoo.

Veeeerryyyy careful.

"Dude I don't care if you have a boner," Bryce casually said.

Nikolai winced but sighed and grabbed the curtain bar as he turned himself. The man he shared this with acted like nothing was wrong. Weirdly he wasn't excited about this judging by the flaccid length. 

Though it was impressive, if that was just the regular length.

"Nick," Bryce said.

"Uh..hem, yes?"

"It's ok. To look. Or feel. I don't mind. I won't make you do anything, but you don't need to feel like you're a pervert."

"O-ok, I'll.. think about that. And thank you, Bryce."

Nikolai blushed as he grabbed the shampoo. 

All he had left to do was wash his hair.

That only two seconds.

But Bryce, Bryce still had to wash his back and maybe his front.

Nick could…do something.

He just had to be brave. Take a step with a bar of soap and wash him off. Rub along his belly, along his biceps, maybe even squeeze-

…Scrub, yes, scrub his chest. Bryce was getting hard now too as it bumped against his own. No big deal, natural reactions, he just had to wash under his pits and be done with it. Wash under them, maybe wash his back while he was up against the guy.

Maybe even-

"Hey."

Bryce pulled him up and inches away from each other.

"It's ok."

Nick wasn't sure at first. And yet….

When their lips met he couldn't pull away. His legs wrapped around him as Bryce held him up. All of this tension melted with each kiss, each brush of his clawed hand-

"You boys done yet?"

Well then.

"H-hey Connor! Just…….*fuck*," Bryce had begun nibbling on his neck mid sentence.

"I can see that. Not making too much of a mess, I hope?"

Connor looked at his husband and winked.

"Just make sure to finish up soon."

The blonde wolf waved off with a wiggle of his fingers. Bryce grinned and pulled him in before he could say another word. One hand to hold him up and grope his ass a bit, the other to keep the flustered human in place. Nikolai huffed into his friend's ear as he felt him leave a few marks.

Much as he wanted to enjoy this they had to be quick. Probably best enjoyed if they did this some other time. And to include Adam.

That's right, his brain reminded him, he didn't even ask if Adam wanted to join.

"H-hey, we um…we gotta get you cleaned off."

Bryce seemed disappointed as he set him down but cooperated as Nick scrubbed him. He was thorough save for the private bits in case of anything gross there. But Bryce insisted it was fine and told him to go dry off, be out in a minute.

Whatever he'd done to earn hearing actual words, he didn't know.

He'd spent enough time drying now that all he needed to do was get dressed. No problem except that all of his clothes were in a cabin a half mile away. He braced himself for an awkward conversation as he stepped in the bedroom. Prudity didn't seem to affect the other wolves as they were nude.

"I heard someone got lucky in the bathroom~", Adam said to him.

"M-maybe.."

He and his big fluffy belly seemed to call for him. Connor looked radiant, not as big but probably just as soft. And his sheathe looked just as big as Adam's despite his relatively human size. He gulped but before he could back out a huge paw pressed him in.

"H-hey Bryce," he said in a small voice.

"You ok, hon?", Adam asked with a tilt of his head.

"Let's…just get this over with."

Bryce lightly smacked his ass as he brushed by and laid on one side of the bed. Adam occupied the other and it was clear they expected their guest in the middle.

"So, how does this work?", Nikolai asked the three.

"Wolves will curl up to each other in piles. And these piles help us bond," Connor explained as he sat on the edge.

"Do we have to be nude?", Nick asked as he blushed.

"I brought underwear for you, if you prefer that," Adam threw him a pair as he waited.

"Um…"

Nikolai sighed and let it drop to the floor along with his towel. Thoughts of strangeness danced around his mind but he needed to just try.

Try to be in a pile and see if he liked it. Try the center of the bed and have two massive wolves on either side of him. Try not to think it weird as their legs lifted over his own as though he was someone important.

Try a skinny blonde wolf on top of him acting as a blanket and resting on his chest.

….And try not to get a boner.

Too late for him, unfortunately.

"Um…I um…", Nikolai tried to say.

"It's ok. That happens with first timers."

"C-course! Um…just don't wanna make things awkward.."

"Just relax. If you're not comfy let us know and you can go home."

Nikolai gulped but reached a hand up to gently pet behind his ears. Connor sighed and nuzzled against him in return whilst the other two whined for affection. As he scratched behind their ears they snuggled closer and licked him affectionately.

It was one of the best things he ever got to experience. Soon they all settled and snoozed against the human but he could only lie awake for the next few hours. Connor had grabbed onto him like a comforter with the other two doing the same.

He almost didn't deserve this, or rather he thought he didn't. In his mind after everything, who he was, what he'd done was almost too much guilt. But regardless he wouldn't ever let this go.

The trust of a few wolves and treating him like he was in the pack. He sniffed and let a tear out but it was only a happy one. No time for tears when he could rest.

Sternwell offices were all deserted at night.

At least, that's what the public knew regarding this secretive location. Day workers were a good front for hiding the real purpose of this building. Disguising an entrance to a werewolf hunters organization and any other supernatural abomination they came across.

In one particular office was a man hunched over several papers, maps, and plans. The room was cold, dimly lit as the agent went over the files. Standard procedure to keep the light minimal in places like this. Still didn't stop him from tapping cigarette ashes into the trash basket and taking another drag.
