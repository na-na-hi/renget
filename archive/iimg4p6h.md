#Exhibition Match

Two youths stepped forward and bowed. They have been chosen to participate in a sparring match ahead of the upcoming chunin exams to help establish support for the project.

Under the watchful eyes of their teachers and the honourable guests, they set off towards their places upon the raised arena.

Governmental officials, sent by the daimyo to oversee the display in their place, turned to their right, where from the west side a boy with golden locks, kept back by a forehead protector bearing the crest of Kumogakure, entered. On his shoulder rested a katana. His step was confident and rhythmic, nearly bouncy. It seemed as if he was mumbling something to himself.

The noblemen then turned left, where from the eastern side, the second performed of today. His dark hair was long and tied behind his back. Above the famous white eyes, the mark of Konoha was displayed proudly. A soft smile brightened his face until the moment when he took his stance, and shifted into a more serious expression.

Their teachers, acting as referees, nodded to each other and raised their hands in unison.

"GET READY!"

Their voices announced in harmony. With the last encouraging looks at their pupils, they sharply cut the air with a downward motion.

"FIGHT!"

Seeking to exploit any possible openings, Jin quickly attempts to land the first blow of the fight.

「EIGTH TRIGRAMS: AIR PALM」

With a sharp release of his chakra, he crushes the air in front of him, and a shockwave comes crashing at his opponent.

Or rather, at a place where he's just been. With a smirk and a quick handseal, D has disappeared from his starting position and appeared behind his opponent. He wasted no time, and his sword was already chopping down, seeking to end this fight early.

But for Hyuga, attacking from the rear alone isn't enough to exploit their blindspot.

「GENTLE FIST: BODY BLOW」

Quickly expelling the chakra from the tenketsu on his back, he pushes the blade off-line, giving himself enough space to jump back.

The two began to circle one another. The initial exchange was enough to instil a measure of respect into them. It was time to take this a level higher.

They both closed their eyes.

Jin took a heavy breath and focused, channelling his chakra through his respiratory system.

D focused his on his eyes, and called on the power coursing in his bloood.

They opened their eyes.

「SEVEN HEAVENLY BREATHS: FIRST ACTIVATION」

「MIRROR WHEEL EYE: SHARINGAN」

They leapt forward. One clad in a golden aura, its pressure causing his hair to violently whip around. The transformation of the other filled his eyes with a scarlet glow. 

They exchanged blows.

Jin's fingers shot forward with terrible intent.

But even with his technique making him a blur of speed, D was able to respond, his sword always in the right place, as if he read his opponent's mind.

But he didn't only defend. He was a genius of the sword, the likes of which come only once a generation. Jin only barely managed to defend against it, shallow cuts on his hands a sign of a couple close calls.

Once again, they jumped back to separate.

The battle was taking a toll on them, but still, they had to take it another level.

Jin started to focus on his breathing again, getting ready for the second activation.

But D was not about to let him do it so easier. With a few masterfully quick hand movements, he channelled his chakra.

「LIGHTNING RELEASE: STORM SPARROWS」

A few balls of crackling energy rapidly shot forward. Their chaotic paths directed at young Hyuga.

Taking the risk, Jin attempted to finish his technique instead of dodging.

「SEVEN HEAVENLY BREATHS: SECOND ACTIVATION」

When he completed it, the elemental attacks were but inches away from him, but with his newfound speed, he managed to pull off one of his signature techniques.

「EIGTH TRIGRAMS: PALM ROTATION」

He spun around. Chakra cloaked his body, raising the perfect defence of Hyuga. The lighting dissipated around it harmlessly.

As he finished, he noticed D leaping right towards him. Like a shadow following behind his initial attack, he sought to end this fight with his blade finding an opening after the initial strike was blocked.

The eyes of Sharingan could keep up with Jin even after the Second Activation, but could their owner's body do the same? Young Hyuga decided to bet against that.

Rather than raising his shield again, he sent his fingers forward. With a surgical precision, the scalpel of chakra surges forward, if it reaches its target, it will end the fight in one blow.

But which will be faster? The sword, striking iron heated with the power of storm? Or the gentle blade of internal damage?

Thanks to the power of breathing, it is the latter!

However, there is one fact that stops the Hyuga from basking in victory.

While the storm of his own energy raged about him moments before, it blinded him from noticing that one more technique was subtly used by his opponent...

「shadow clone jutsu」

As the D in front of him explodes in a puff of smoke, Jin feels something sharp poke him in the back of his head, right where his only blindspot is.

 "STOP! VICTOR: D!"

Jin sighs, releasing his technique, but then grins.

"I guess you could say... I did not see this coming..."

Natsuo drags his student away before he decides to put his opponent out of his misery.
