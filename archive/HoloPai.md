HoloPai!

TAKE 1
A conundrum, a deep, puzzling conundrum.
Amelia Watson scratched her chin in thought, trying to remember which room A-Chan had told them to go to for the HoloGra shoot. 
Before them were two rooms: 405 and 406. 
“What did A-Chan tell you?” Ouro Kronii asked, her arms folded across her bountiful chest. 
“That’s the thing; I can’t remember,” Ame said with a frown. “Can’t pull up Discord either; I forgot my phone at the hotel. Ina, Ina, you got...?”
Almost as soon as she asked the question though, Ina shook her head. “I don’t have mobile data; sorry.”
“I don’t have data either,” Kronii added impatiently. “So, what are we gonna do now?”
“I guess, we just... uh...” Ame narrowed her eyes while thinking of a solution. “Guess we’ll just go into one of the rooms, and if it turns out to be the wrong one we just say ‘Sorry!’ and all that. You know.”
Kronii thought about it for a while herself before finally nodding. “That makes sense... Fine. But which door should we knock on first, detective?” 
It was up to Ame to decide which door they would try first. But it was clear that even she wasn’t confident in her choice. 
“Hmmm... let’s go with Room 405,” she said finally after a moment of hesitation.
The others followed closely behind as Ame wiped away sweat from her forehead before knocking three times on the door. 
After a moment’s pause, the door creaked open...

TAKE 2
Taro Kuronishi was on edge as he realized that the production had gone beyond budget - much more than what Crystal-Eizou was willing to cover. Despite cutting corners in all aspects of the shoot - including location, staff costs, costumes, and editing (all while maintaining quality standards) - they were still going over budget.
He flicked the ash from his cigarette into a nearly full ashtray. It was clear that most of the money went toward paying the foreign AV actresses. Hololive English was made up of foreigners, after all! But quality could not be compromised at any cost - especially not for such an ambitious project as Holo no Paizuri!
Despite opposition from naysayers at Crystal-Eizou who deemed it unprofitable to have live-action AVs featuring women dressed up as virtual YouTubers, Taro was determined. He’ll show them. He’ll show all of them that they were wrong!
If only his actresses would show up already...
“Director!” One of his production assistants, Q-San, interrupted him from the studio’s lobby. “The actresses are all here, sir. Shall I let them in?”
Taro stubbed his cig into the ashtray and had T-San, another member of the production staff, put it away. He then put on his circle-rimmed glasses and opened the first two buttons of his shirt, just like how his idol Toru Muranishi would do. 
“The actresses are here!” he said, clapping his hands at the cameramen, the lights men, and the naked actors. “Places, everybody! Places!”
It was showtime! He would do Muranishi-san proud!

TAKE 3
“Where the heck are they...?” A-Chan clicked her tongue as she tried calling Watson-san for the fifth time that morning. 
“Are you sure she has her phone?” Sora Tokino asked thoughtfully, tilting her head to the side. “Maybe she forgot it.”
A-Chan sighed, frustrated by the lack of response from someone who always seemed so dependable. It was weird for Watson-san not to pick up calls like this. “I guess you’re right, Sora. But do you think... you don’t suppose they got lost or anything, right?” 
The possibility set off alarm bells in A-Chan’s mind. If that happened, it would be a disaster!
“Well, if you gave them instructions on how to get here,” Sora said reassuringly while handing a cup of warm tea to A-Chan, “I’m sure they’ll find their way."
“Yes, yes, I did,” A-Chan replied before taking a sip. The warm green tea immediately took some of the edge off. She remembered how she gave Watson-san a Google Maps link to where the Mori Building was in Minato Ward last night through Discord. Surely she would be smart enough to use that, right? 
“You should relax for a bit. They’ll be okay; don’t worry,” Sora said before taking a sip of her own tea. “You’ve been working hard all morning, A-Chan.”
It was true - A-Chan only slept for two hours the night before. The upcoming episode of Holo no Graffiti was very ambitious. Perhaps its biggest one yet. Watson-san and Kronii-san would attempt to steal each other’s sandwiches by time traveling in the Hololive office, while Ina’nis-san would join in on the fun too. 
Other JP talents were also supposed to appear, like Pekora (who had to cancel her speech at a carrot farm opening in Chiba), Marine (who was working overtime), Miko (who said she wanted to train her ‘Elite English’, whatever that was), and Sora (who said she didn’t have anything else going on that weekend anyway). 
It was such a significant episode that it would be a massive waste if Watson-san and the other EN talents didn’t show up on time.
That was when an idea came to A-Chan’s mind. 
“The others!” she exclaimed excitedly. “I should call them instead! They should have phones too, right Sora?”
“Uh-huh! That’s a good idea, A-Chan,” she replied. “You should call them right now.”
Just as A-Chan was about to press the call button on her phone, though, Miko entered from the studio lobby.
“A-Chan!” she yelled. “Watson-san is here with the others!” 
Almost instantly, a wave of relief came over the beleaguered Hololive staff member. “Really? Oh, good lord...”
Sora smiled knowingly at her. “See? I told you they’ll be okay.”
“Well, then!” A-Chan began as she stood up. “Let’s meet them, Sora.”
When A-Chan emerged from the studio lounge and met with the Hololive EN talents, her relief soon gave way to confusion. Before her stood three women who roughly resembled Watson-san, Kronii-san, and Ina’nis-san, but... something was rather off about them.
Watson-san was blonde, but she also looked a little more... mature-looking, while Kronii-san had thicker lips than usual. Ina’nis-san was as thin as expected, but she also looked a lot more slant-eyed than how she normally appeared during her streams. 
This meeting marked the first time that A-Chan and the Hololive JP talents had met their counterparts from the Hololive EN branch in person. But even so, everyone else present shared in A-Chan's confusion.
“Sora, is it me, or...?” A-Chan whispered quietly so as to not be heard by the EN talents. “Do you notice something... different about them?”
“Hm?” Sora looked at A-Chan before glancing at the EN talents. “I don’t think so.”
Sora then turned to Pekora, who had one rabbit ear bent as she was lost in thought while looking at their EN counterparts.
“How about you, Pekora? Do they look any different to you?” Sora asked her.
“Hmm... it’s hard to tell, peko,” the bunny girl said as she rubbed her chin.
“Not to be judgmental or anything,” A-Chan began as she scooted over to Pekora’s left. “But don’t you think they look rather... weird?”
“Well, hey, they’re foreigners, peko,” she whispered casually. “Foreign girls always look trashy, right?”
A-Chan’s eyes widened at that remark. “W-Well, I wouldn’t say that,” she replied uneasily while taking another glance at the EN talents. “But, then again...” 
“Yoo-hoo~!” The woman known as Watson-san called out to A-Chan in English with a southern drawl as thick as molasses. “We’re here for the shoot! You know, for Holo no... Holo no...” She paused before looking at Kronii-san. “What the fuck was that again...?
“Holo no Graffiti,” A-Chan said, stepping forward with one hand extended before speaking again in English. “Hello, Watson-san! I’m glad you and the others are here.”
“That’s the name of my role, right?” Watson-san asked before smiling and spreading her arms. “Awww, you’re such a sweetie! C’mere, give mamma a big hug...”
Watson-san then pulled A-Chan into an embrace against her rather pronounced bosom. Although the Hololive staffer knew that foreigners hugged other people as a sign of affection, she wasn’t used to being treated like that at all. 
Though she couldn’t deny that it mildly felt nice - more so thanks to Watson-san smelling of lilacs. 
A-Chan chuckled nervously while trying to draw away from the woman’s embrace. “Ahahaha, thank you Watson-san... if you could let go now, please.”
“Oh! No problem, sweetie! No problem,” said Watson-san as she loosened her embrace. “Oh wait, before I forget, can we just ask one teeny little question?”
“Uh, sure, Watson-san,” A-Chan said. 
“Can you tell us where K-San is? I believe he’s the director of this shoot?”
K-san? A-Chan dug through her mental directory of names, trying to remember. 
K-san? 
K-Son...? 
The Hololive staffer snapped her fingers. Perhaps they were looking for Coco? But why, though? And why would Coco direct an epsiode of HoloGra? 
A-Chan shook her head. There was no time for these unnecessary thoughts. They were losing enough time as it was. “Sorry, Watson-san, they’re not here at the moment,” she said. “I’m currently in charge.”
“Oh! Well, okay! No problem, sweetie, no problem. A shoot’s still a shoot, after all, right girls?” Watson-san asked the other two EN talents, who both nodded. “Also, what was that name again...? Oh! You can call me Amelia. So we stay in character and all that, right?”
A-Chan nodded. “Amelia-san, Amelia-san, yes, yes...” Foreigners were very casual with names, after all. 
Though they were a bit different than what the Hololive staffer was expecting, the EN talents seemed nice enough. Besides, time was of the essence. They had to get the shoot going! 
“Okay, everyone!” A-Chan called as she clapped her hands at the cameramen, the lights men, and the talents. “Places, everybody! Places!” 
Regardless of unexpected difficulties, it was showtime! She would do Yagoo proud!

TAKE 4
“Holy shit!” Taro Kuronishi couldn’t believe his eyes as he ogled the AV actresses - no, angels that had descended upon his set. So much so that he exclaimed in English, “You guys look like the real Hololive talents! Wow!”
Ame cleared her throat before responding. “Of course! I mean... we are them, after all.”
“Method acting!” Taro exclaimed excitedly. “I love it! This is beautiful! Beautiful!”
But before anyone could get too comfortable and start working on the project, Kronii asked an important question: “Do you guys have a snack bar?”
“I hope they have cookies,” Ina added.
Taro quickly got into action mode and started waving his hands around at Q-San and Z-San. “You two; you heard the woman! Get the fuckin’ snack bar ready!”
Both production staffers nodded dutifully. “Yes, director!”
The studio set was alive with different staff members assembling everything necessary for what was supposed to be Hololive’s offices in Chiyoda Ward - office tables, copiers, water coolers, sofas, even shelves full of realistic-looking office documents.
Ame couldn’t help but notice how incredibly detailed and realistic everything looked compared to the set she saw in the few HoloGra episodes she caught on YouTube. Maybe they upped their production value since Hololive EN was involved now too? That would certainly be nice of the JP office.
But there was one thing that Ame wanted to know. 
“Uh, director-san,” she began her question cautiously. “Where’s A-Chan? She was supposed to be here too, right?”
Taro raised his brow in confusion. A-Chan? Who the hell was that? He whispered over to T-San out of earshot of the actresses: “Who is she talking about?”
“Maybe she’s referring to Asanuma-san, director?” T-san offered as an explanation while he pushed up the bridge of his glasses.
Ah, yes - Big Dick Asanuma-san! The infamous AV actor with a 12-inch dong. Although he worked under Crystal-Eizou and Taro meant to cast him for a role in HoloPai, he unfortunately already had other commitments.
But could it be? These innocent-looking actresses actually knew who he was? Wow! What they said about foreigners was true - they really were experienced in sex. What a goldmine!
Taro knew he had hit the jackpot. “Ah! A-San!” he told Ame in apology. “They’re not here at the moment... but we do have J-Chad! They’re just getting prepared. Their role takes a bit of preparation, you see.” 
J-Chad, also known in the industry as Josuke-Chad, was the second-best AV actor that Taro could find. Although he was no Asanuma-san, J-Chad still boasted a respectable 11 inches himself - definitely in a class of his own! 
As for Ame, the name made her raise her eyebrow. “J-Chad...?” She turned to Kronii and whispered. “Why the heck would J-Chad be here...?”
“Dunno,” Kronii replied. “Maybe Mori’s here too?”
“Or maybe J-Chad is filling in for A-Chan,” Ina offered. “I heard A-Chan’s been working all night, so maybe she got sick or something.” 
Ame nodded, taking note of their ideas. From her own experience, it wouldn’t be out of character for Hololive to switch people around to carry out tasks - especially on important projects like this episode of HoloGra.
“Okay then, director-san!” chirped Ame brightly as she got ready to start filming. “We’re ready when you are!” 
“I love your enthusiasm!” Taro exclaimed in joy. It seemed these actresses shared his love for the high art of pornography. “Alright! You’ll be shooting in three different rooms for three different scenes! Go!” 
With the production staff herding the actresses into their respective rooms, Taro proudly went behind the main studio console where all of his cameras’ monitors were displayed. Each room was connected to an intercom system, allowing him to communicate with each actress and direct all three scenes simultaneously! 
Through this technological marvel of communication and his expertise in multi-tasking, he’d be able to make it to the deadline for Holo no Paizuri without breaking a sweat. 

TAKE 5
“HoloPai Episode One! A Detective’s Investigation! Take one!” shouted the camera assistant as he clapped the clapperboard. “Action!” 
As the scene began, an excitement built up within Ame that was beyond words. She could hardly contain herself - this was her moment to shine, and she was more than ready for it! 
She was supposed to ‘investigate’ this office set for any signs of wrongdoing. Although the scenario wasn’t exactly what she had read in the script last night (it was something about Kronii and sandwiches), she didn’t let that get her down. After all, a little improvisation never hurt anybody. 
With the cameraman following close behind her every move, Ame channeled her inner detective and began her ‘investigation’. She carefully flipped through books, opened drawers with purpose, and skimmed through files covered in ‘Lorem Ipsum’ with keen attention to detail before making some profound nods and well-timed scratches of her chin.
And then came her big moment - Ame dramatically turned toward the sole office desk in the room and pointed at it just like how Detective Conan would do in anime. “The secret documents are definitely in that desk!” 
As she cautiously approached the desk to pick the lock with her Swiss Army Knife multitool prop, suddenly an enemy grabbed her from behind! 
“Gasp!” Ame exclaimed as she struggled against her attacker.
“I caught you now, detective!” the enemy said menacingly. He was a black-haired man with a wrestler mask - not exactly someone you’d want to mess with! 
As he said this, he grabbed Ame by one arm and began patting her down for any hidden weapons or clues... until his wandering hands... started massaging her breasts?
“Wait, whuh, wha-- aahhn~!” Ame moaned in confusion as the enemy kneaded her tits through the fabric of her white shirt. “Aahhhn~!” 
The strange sensation sent shockwaves throughout Ame’s body - something she had never experienced before. After a few minutes of relentless massage by the enemy wrestler-man, the detective slumped onto the desk, panting heavily with her tongue out like Bubba on a hot day. 
What the hell was happening? Was this... was this part of the script?!
As the confusion began to cloud Ame’s mind, the wrestler-man grabbed her from behind, hands on both of her breasts, and laid her on the desk. At this point, four other men with big white Xs painted on their masks entered the room and held down Ame’s arms and legs. Meanwhile, the cameraman hovered over her, taking satisfying footage of her face, tits, thighs, and the panties hidden under her plaid skirt. 
“Ha-ha-ha! Detective Watson!” The wrestler-man shouted. “Tell us! Who are you working for?!” 
Although it was all quite unexpected, Ame knew that ecchi content was all the rage these days. Was it possible that Hololive was experimenting with something racy in this episode? She wished they had given her some prior notice first beforehand, though!
Not wanting to hold back any progress on set because of perceived unprofessionalism, Ame decided to play along. “Never! I’m not telling you anything-uh!” she cried without missing a beat.
“Well, that’s unfortunate!” The wrestler-man said menacingly. “Because we have ways to make you talk!” 
Ame pretended to struggle out of the grasp of her ‘attackers’, even as the cameraman continued taking one too many panty shots. “You... you expect me to talk? H-Hah!”
“No, Detective Watson!” exclaimed the wrestler-man before pulling out an eight-inch vibrator from behind his back. “I expect you TO CUM! HAHAHAHAHA!”
On cue, the four other henchmen held out identical vibrators with sharp military precision. 
At this point, Ame knew things were going waaay past the limits of your usual HoloGra shoot. Deep within her, she knew that she had somehow made a big mistake. 
“Whu-whuh, wait a minute-uh!” stammered the detective, her tone much more timid, before the sudden rush of pleasure made her go cross-eyed. “D-Don’t-- aaaAAGHN~! AAAAAGHHHNNNN~!!!” 

TAKE 6
“You want me to do what with this guy?” Kronii asked the camera hesitantly as she stood beside a muscular man donning a Kronie clock mask and an 11-inch dong. She was unsure of how to proceed.
“Massage his dick with your tits!” Taro’s voice called out from the intercom. “You know, let it slide between ‘em! It’ll look great in the camera!”
“I am not touching that thing unless it is written in the script!” Kronii exclaimed with apprehension before casting a curious glance toward that ginormous phallus. “Jesus Christ...” 
“Uh...” The man who had yet to receive his massage chimed in. “Director, we’ll need to start soon because it’s hard to keep this thing up without pills, you know.”
“I know, I know!” Taro bellowed with impatience. “That’s why all we need from you, Kronii-san, is to put his dick between your massive tits! It’s like making a Subway sandwich - easy peasy!”
“Well then show me the goddamn script so I can check if this scene’s even there!” demanded Kronii, annoyed. “I didn’t sign up for massaging dicks on film, you know.”
“Ahhh, hell! Q-San! Give her the damn script already!” Taro shouted through the intercom. “It’s right there, see?!”
True enough, there was a line of the script that said ‘Kronii gives the Kronie a paizuri.’
“Well... wouldya’ look at that,” pondered Kronii thoughtfully, though slightly perplexed. She didn’t read that in the script last night. Then again, she did fall asleep halfway through it, so maybe it really was there and she just missed it. 
“Now will you do us a favor and massage that dick already?” Taro groaned. “Come on, now.”
Kronii was somehow intrigued by the idea of putting that enormous penis between her breasts just to see how it looked like. But she sure as hell didn’t want that sleazy cameraman taking footage of the whole thing. 
The Warden of Time sighed in resignation. Unfortunately, idol culture was a thing. That probably meant having to put up with these types of bizarre requests from time to time. 
“Fine, okay... I’ll do it,” Kronii grumbled under her breath before kneeling in front of the Kronie. His long dong cast a thick shadow over her face as it cut through the light above her. 
“HoloPai Episode Two! Kronii’s kronies! Take one!” shouted the camera assistant as he clapped the clapperboard. “Action!” 
At the start of the scene, Kronii unzipped her pinstripe undershirt, letting her large breasts spill out. Her nipples brushed against the fabric of her Council uniform, causing a small tingle to rise within herself. She then grabbed both of her boobs from underneath and pressed them together around the dick, before moving up and down in a motion similar to the scant few videos Mumei shared with her way back when. 
As she continued bouncing, the erect penis began glistening against the skin of her tits, each stroke covering it in precum. It smelled earthy but was not unbearable; at least this guy took a bath before the shoot.
Despite how strained it looked with all those veins running across its shaft, Kronii found herself intrigued by how huge his cock was as it rose between her cleavage like a dragon rising to the sky. 
“Aw man,” groaned the ‘Kronie’ as he lost himself to pleasure. “Holy shit! K-Keep going!” 
Kronii couldn’t help but think: How did people’s dicks get so big? To her, his erection appeared painful based on its apparent strain under tension. Yet, for some reason, he seemed to be enjoying himself. 
Men are weird creatures. That’s what Kronii concluded as she continued sliding his hard-on up and down her bosom. 
After a while, as it grew warmer and warmer between her breasts from all that massaging, the cock began to twitch. Then, without warning, something spurted out from the tip - warm and sticky gooeyness that landed on Kronii’s forehead and cheeks, reeking of bleach. Some even found its way into her mouth.
“Ugh...!” she groaned, trying to spit it out quickly due to its salty taste. Unfortunately, her saliva simply drooled out of her lips, sliding down her neck, and onto her breasts. “Aw, what the hell...”
“That was too good,” the Kronie admitted apologetically as his hips continued to push his quickly-limping erection between Kronii’s valley. “I’m sorry, director, I came too quick...”
“No! That was perfect!” Taro’s voice boomed through the intercom with glee. “Absolutely exquisite! You, Kronii-san! You’re a natural at this!” 
The warden rolled her eyes before wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. Natural, huh? If only there was a ‘natural’ pay increase that came with crap like this...

TAKE 7
“So this is a cookie?” Ina asked, her small hands reaching out in front of her. 
She was blindfolded, though on camera she was actually about to grab something from a table where a man wearing a Takodachi mask lay. From the cookie box positioned directly above his groin thrust an erection that she could feel growing under her fingers.
“Yes! Yes!” Taro boomed over the intercom. “It’s a, uh... it’s a very big cookie!”
Ina seemed unconvinced as she felt around it with her fingers. “Are you sure? This feels like a thick stick of Calorie Mate, really,” she muttered. “I’ll need some Doctor Oopsie to wash this down. You guys got any?”
“Yeah, yeah! Q-San! give Ina’nis-san the, uh... Doctor Oopsie,” Taro commanded while sounding excitedly pleased at this turn of events.
“Yes, director,” Q-San said dutifully as he handed over a bottle of Ina’s drink of choice, though it was filled to the brim with a white-grey liquid instead of the actual drink.
“Wah... this Doctor Oopsie’s kinda warm,” Ina remarked as she held onto the bottle and unscrewed its cap, examining its contents closely with her nose. “Kinda smells weird too... is this a new flavor?”
“Yes, yes, Ina’nis-san,” Taro replied before chuckling mischievously. “Drink it and find out!”
“I’ll take a bite outta this cookie first,” Ina declared before grasping onto the dick once more. “Oh my, it’s twitching... Cookies don’t twitch, you know?”
“It’s uh... It’s a special cookie!” Taro stammered. “Yeah!”
But Ina wasn’t buying it this time. Her tone was more assertive than usual when she next spoke. 
“Hey, director-san, be real with me for a second,” she demanded. “Is this a penis?”
Silence descended upon the set as Ina posed her piercing question, leaving Taro no choice but to respond truthfully.
“Um... uh... y-yes, that is correct,” he finally replied, unsure of what might happen next.
Despite watching his monitor intently to gauge Ina’s reaction, her expression was unreadable. Only after some moments of tense silence did she speak again.
“Well, why didn’t you say so?” she said before pulling off her blindfold and discovering the erect member in her hands. “Wah,” she exclaimed, surprised with its size. “It’s pretty big...”
Still unsure of how things were turning out, Taro decided to go off-script, improvising anew. “Okay Ina’nis-san,” he suggested hesitantly. “I suppose you should enjoy your new treat--”
“You don’t have to tell me twice,” retorted Ina with an impish smile directly into the camera before closing her eyes. She then elegantly discarded one article of clothing after another: platform sandals followed by her sole thigh-high sock, a pair of black spats, before finally stripping a thin pair of violet panties, all of which she laid  casually on the “Takodachi’s” chest.
“Aw, you even got him a Takodachi mask,” Ina mused as she climbed onto the table. “That’s cute.”
Ina positioned herself directly above the “Tako’s” erect penis. With no hesitation whatsoever, she threw aside the box containing his supposed ‘cookie’, and lowered herself down onto him.
As Taro watched this vixen slowly devour one of his actors on film with no protection whatsoever, uncertainty crept into his mind. 
“He-Hey, are you sure you don’t want him to wear--” he began nervously, only for Ina to cut him off.
“Aaaaggghhnnn~!” she moaned in delight, taking in every inch that was offered to her with no reservations. 
“... a condom?” Taro finished, before wincing.
“Oh yeah, that hit the spot...” Ina declared while licking the top of her lips. As she began bouncing up and down on her prey, she gave the camera a lazy, half-lidded look. “Sorry, what was that?”
“Um...” Taro gulped audibly. “... Nothing. Proceed.”
“HoloPai Episode Three! Ina’nis Gets a Cookie! Take four!” shouted an assistant as he clapped together a clapboard in front of the camera. “Action!” 

TAKE 8
During their breaktime on the HoloGra set, Watson-san, along with Kronii-san and Ina’nis-san were sitting down alongside Pekora, Sora, and Miko. A-Chan had left for a bit to buy snacks. 
“So girls...” the mature Watson-san began, fluttering her brows behind thick makeup. “Is this your first time on a shoot?”
Miko and Pekora looked at each other briefly, wondering just who should be answering first, before agreeing on Miko going ahead.
“Ahhh, no, no,” Miko began gesturing wildly in an effort to make up for not being able to convey her message in English outright. “Ehh... not firsto time, no, no, no...”
“No, no, no, no,” Pekora interjected, shaking her head so vigorously like she seemed poised to snap her own neck muscles. “It issu notto first time shooting. No, no!”
“Oh, wow!” Watson-san exclaimed, clearly impressed. “But you girls look so young, though! How long have you been in the industry?”
“In-doos-tree?” Pekora repeated slowly before turning to Marine, speaking Japanese. “What is she saying, peko?”
“I think she means, uh...” Marine put a hand to her chin. “How long we’ve been idols.”
“Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,” Pekora said while nodding in agreement. “You answer, peko.”
“Eh? Why me?” asked Marine, clearly hesitant.
“Just do it, peko!” 
“O-Okay...” Marine took in a deep breath before opening her mouth to speak. “I ammmu... seventeen girl,” she declared nervously.
Upon hearing that, Watson-san, Kronii-san, and Ina’nis-san’s eyes bulged in shock.
“Wow, seventeen huh?” Watson-san exclaimed before turning to Kronii-san. “They really start them young in Japan, don’t they?”
“I guess it’s because they have a lower age of consent here, or...?” Kronii-san speculated more, but her voice had gone to such a low whisper that the Japanese talents couldn’t hear her properly.
“What are these fuckers talking about, peko?” Pekora asked Miko in Japanese.
“Ehhh... uhhh... I can’t understand them; they’re whispering too much...” Miko responded, somewhat uncertain.
“So much for ‘Elite English’...” Pekora clicked her tongue disapprovingly. “Korone should’ve been here too, peko.”
“She has a stream with the rest of GAMERS, though,” Marine mused. 
“I know, peko, I know,” Pekora exclaimed in frustration before clicking her tongue again. “I just wanna know what these EN people are getting at. I think they’re trying to show us up.”
The three EN “talents” whispered amongst themselves for a while, before Watson-san interrupted again with a question. “So, girls, what kinda shoots have you guys done? Vanilla? Public? Creampie...?”
“Isn’t vanilla an ice cream flavor, peko?” Pekora asked Miko incredulously.
“Maybe she’s talking about... uh... food-tasting streams?” the shrine maiden offered.
At this point, Sora also started contemplating exactly what her EN counterparts were referring to during their conversation - particularly when Watson-san mentioned ‘Public’. It was entirely perplexing. Did that mean doing livestreams in public? 
Then again, Sora did watch a lot of western streamers doing precisely that these days. They would go around the street, asking random people about how much they paid for rent and other personal queries. Maybe that’s what Watson-san meant by the term ‘public’? 
Though she found the idea a little embarrassing, Sora did feel it could be fun to do that sometimes. She would be like that NHK reporter who interviewed that couple in front of Shibuya Station during a snowstorm. 
“So, how do you feel being up and about in the snow?” Sora would ask.
“Ah, well,” the young man would begin as his lover hides her face in embarrassment. “You know, being in the snow with my girlfriend like this immerses me in a special feeling. I like it.” 
Come to think of it, a ‘public’ stream like that would be fun!
“Ahh... eh... Public not yet, no,” Sora told the EN talents in English before adding hastily: “But I am... willing to learn. Yes, yes!”
“Awwww, that’s wonderful, sweetie!” Watson-san exclaimed warmly. “You’ll get the hang of it, so don’t worry about a thing! I remember my first public shoot -- it was on this overpass in Savannah, Georgia.  Wild times. How about gangbangs? Have you guys done gangbangs before?”
“The hell is a ‘gangbang’, peko?” Pekora asked Miko with confusion etched all over her face.
“Hmmm...” Miko began pondering seriously as she arched her brows, deep in thought. “I guess it means... you know - ‘gang’ as in group? So maybe she’s asking if we’ve done collabs? As for ‘bang’... eh... maybe ‘bang, bang!’ Like in an FPS? Maybe Rust?”
As for Marine, though, the word ‘gangbang’ evoked rather different imagery within her mind - something involving groups, but entirely different from what one would consider a ‘normal’ stream. 
“Uh, guys... I don’t think that’s what ‘gangbang’ means...” Marine murmured hesitantly while trying hard to come up with another interpretation. 
“Marine,” Pekora admonished sharply as she turned toward the pirate girl. “Hololive JP can’t afford to lose face in front of these people, peko! If they do ‘gangbangs’, it means we should be doing them too. Don’t forget that we’re their senpai!” the rabbit girl declared with determination.
“Uh...” Marine gave the EN members another glance before turning to Pekora. “I... I guess you’re right.”
“Yes!” Pekora said before turning to Watson-san, blazing with the same determination. “Yessu! We do... we do many, many gangbang. All Hololive JP! All generation, peko! Yeah.”
“Wow!” Watson-san exclaimed, again impressed with these plucky girls and their confidence. “Hololive is quite the agency, huh?” 
“Hai!” Pekora said, puffing her chest out. “It issu indeed... za best agency in Japan!”
“I sure bet!” the blonde talent replied warmly before turning to Kronii-san. “A whole agency that specializes in gangbangs - can you imagine?”
“The Japanese are really ahead of the curve when it comes to stuff like that,” she concurred sagely.
It was then that A-Chan had returned with the snacks - ice cream and bread and other sweets. “Hallo, everyone! Here is... snacks! Shooting will resume momentarily. Eat up!”

TAKE 9
“Oh my god, what the hell, man?” C-San groaned as he kept thrusting his member into Ame’s body. “Make her stop! Make her stop!” 
“Those noises, they’re messed up for real, dawg...” D-San concurred as his hipbones clapped furiously against the detective’s white ass cheeks. 
It was becoming an alarming situation for these men. Ame, who had earlier been a symbol of integrity, had become nothing more than a pile of cum and pleasure lying on an office table. The evidence of that was so clear even on camera - with a blank, almost cross-eyed expression twisting her face. Whatever personality that previously existed behind those blue eyes had been overridden by lust, replaced with nothing but a brainless sexual instinct. 
Maybe that would have served the purpose of the shoot quite well, since it was exactly what they required anyway. But with each thrust delivered by C-San and D-san alike into Ame’s nubile form came not delightful moans, but high-pitched screeches strange enough to make anyone cringe. Clamors that sounded more creature than woman!
“She sounds like... like in that damn movie about those monsters that melt in water!” C-San exclaimed frantically whilst attempting to recall its name. “Shit, I can’t remember what it is.” 
"All I know is..." D-San could hardly hold back any longer despite holding onto Ame’s thighs, hammering away at her with all his might. “Someone needs to shut her up before I lose my boner, dawg!”
“I’ll take care of it,” E-San declared decisively before positioning his own member right in front of Ame’s mouth. With one hand, he slowly opened it wide open. “All right, girl, take it!”
With barely any resistance, E-San’s dick slid into the detective’s mouth - muffling the sounds she had been making all this time.
“Oh thank fuck,” D-San said before sighing in relief. 
“No need to thank me,” E-San said before moving his hips back and forth rhythmically as the cameraman captured every moment from different angles. “Yeah, detective! Take that! And that! And that too!”
But there was still a problem. Although muffled, the noises still emanated from deep within Ame - audible enough to cause concern amongst everyone present.
“Damn, I can still hear it,” C-San muttered.
“Me too,” D-San added while looking at E-San and shaking his head. “Man, you’re a tiny sonofabitch.”
“Hey, fuck you!” E-San retorted as he pressed harder against Ame’s lips and thrust deeper into her oral cavity. “I just... just need a little more time; give me a damn break!”
It was then that the main star of the shoot - the wrestler-man, F-San, walked up to E-San and clicked his tongue. “Scooch over, you useless piece of shit; I’ll take care of it.”
“What? F-San, I got this all handled--”
Without another word, F-San took out his own respectably-sized dong and stuffed it into Ame’s mouth, even with E-San still being in there too. With her mouth fully occupied by two penises at once, those strange sounds came to an immediate halt.
“Aaahh, gross!” E-San wailed as he gesticulated wildly. “F-San, get away; I can feel your dick, man!”
“Stop making a scene out of this, dumbass!” F-San snapped before turning toward the cameraman directly. “Make sure you record every moment or else I’ll be putting this dick up something else entirely - understand?!” 
The cameraman gulped nervously before stammering out a hasty response. “Y-Yessir!”
F-San groaned inwardly to himself. That bastard Kuronishi promised him that this would be nothing more than a standard gangbang shoot - not some sort of epic battle against an unholy monster! What they were up against was well beyond what any of them were prepared for. It felt like they still had hours ahead of them! 
This entire shoot was undoubtedly one of the darkest moments in his career as an adult film actor. However, he couldn’t allow some blonde to get the best of him - no way! 
“Listen up, men!” F-San bellowed while gripping both sides of Ame’s cheeks firmly with his hands. “I only have one rule! EVERYONE THRUSTS - NO ONE QUITS! If you don’t do your job, I’ll fuck you in the ass so deep, people will think you’re my dick puppet! Do you get me?!”
D-San exchanged hesitant glances with C-San and E-San. Was this guy really serious about fucking their asses? 
Despite their doubts, however, that speech had fired up something in their hearts as well, and they felt compelled by F-San’s energy and willingness to lead from the front.  
“We get you, sir!” they yelled, throwing away their reluctance.
“The only way we’re getting out of here alive is if we screw this woman 'till she stops feeling her legs!” F-San yelled. “Come on you apes, you wanna live forever?! LET’S GOOO!!!”
As one united will, all four men thrust into Ame with a force equivalent to...

TAKE 10
“Director, I’m sorry, I can’t...” J-Chad stopped thrusting and directly looked at the camera. “I can’t work with this.”
“What are you talking about?” Taro yelled over the intercom. “You’re inside her already; just fuck her, for God’s sake!”
“Well, Director,” J-Chad replied while maintaining eye contact with the camera. “I can’t fuck someone who keeps lying down there like a dead fish! I mean, seriously - look at her!”
Even though she was currently connected to J-Chad’s massive 11-inch meat stick, Kronii was still scrolling through Twitter with a disinterested look on her face. There wasn’t much worth reading anyway - just your usual outrage over male collabs and lots of Twitter users expressing their not-so-smart opinions.
“Hey,” Kronii asked without looking up from her phone. “Is this going to take any longer? ‘Cause I have a stream later tonight.”
“Kronii, you have to act like you enjoy being fucked,” Taro said sternly. “You need to moan and shake your hips... We can’t have Josuke over here fucking a corpse!”
The Warden of Time rolled her eyes. It wasn’t that J-Chad was terrible or anything; it was just that this entire shoot went beyond what she agreed to as being a streamer for Cover. How would they even pay her for this porn shoot if YouTube prohibited NSFW content? It didn’t make a lick of sense.
So, being the cunning individual she was, Kronii decided to put in minimal effort until management gave her better news regarding compensation. Besides, who wouldn’t want to be compensated well after enduring an intense pounding with a dick almost as big as her forearm? Talk about risking getting knocked up!
Inhaling and exhaling slowly, Kronii felt exasperated and concerned at the same time. Cover had better included Plan B pills in their health insurance package - just in case.
It’d be troublesome for a Council member to have a kid. How would Kronii even begin with being a mother? The idea was so far-fetched, it bordered on the inconceivable.
“Okay, okay,” Taro called out to Kronii over the intercom. “What will it take for you to at least pretend to enjoy taking this man’s cock? Please tell me so we can get over with this once and for all - I’m begging you here!”
At least the director was willing to play ball. A few ideas already came into Kronii’s head, one more demanding than the other. “Okay,” she said while formulating a cunning plan. “First, I want a sandwich - a Meatball Marinara from Subway with extra sauce and cheese. Got it?”
“Uh... okay? Sure,” Taro replied hesitantly. “T-San! Get that sandwich right away!”
“Oh yeah, don’t forget my large bubble tea. Wintermelon flavor would suffice, thanks,” Kronii added nonchalantly.
“Okay, okay,” Taro said while trying to maintain his composure. “Anything else?”
“I’m good for now,” Kronii replied while making an internal smirk. This was easy enough, and she already got everything she wanted! Like taking candy from a baby. 
Soon, both items arrived - a fresh and warm footlong meatball marinara sandwich, and a large cup of Wintermelon bubble tea. As J-Chad pounded away, Kronii helped herself to half of the sandwich. The tartness of the sauce collided with the saltiness of the meatballs and the cheese and the neutral flavors of the vegetables. 
Now this was heavenly... 
“Aaaahhnnn~...” Kronii moaned in between bites of her sandwich. “Aw, man, that’s good... Aaaahnnn~...”
“There we go!” Taro boomed. “That’s what I’m talking about! Keep that camera rolling and focus on them fucking, but keep that damn sandwich out of the shot!”
“Mmmm... if only you knew...” Kronii muttered under her breath as she lost herself to the ecstasy of eating one of the best sandwiches known to man. “Subway never disappoints.”
“Ugh! I’m almost... I’m almost there!” J-Chad cried loudly.
“I’m almost there too,” Kronii said, holding up her meatball marinara. “If you only knew how good this sandwich is...”
Then, J-Chad held both of Kronii’s legs up as he hardened inside her, almost ready to burst. 
“I hope you take pills!” he blurted. 
Kronii snapped out of her daze. “What?!”
Before she could react any further, J-Chad released all his pent-up semen into Kronii’s unsuspecting womb, the warm gooeyness of it all filling the lower end of her gut completely, to the point that it began seeping between her legs and onto the table beneath her. For a moment, it felt like someone was pissing inside her!
“Oh fuck,” Kronii muttered as she took the last bite of her sandwich. 
J-Chad then removed himself from inside of Kronii, creating an even bigger mess as semen gushed from her body like a faucet at full blast... until Taro ordered him to cover it up with one of those purple clock stickers lying around the set.
“It’s part of the production!” Taro barked. “Do it!”
Just like a man slapping Flex Tape onto a leaking water tank, J-Chad grabbed one of those godforsaken stickers and smacked it on Kronii’s pussy - sealing everything in tightly. It was a perfectly-timed slap, maybe the most perfectly-timed in Japanese porn history. Definitely no more need for a retake.
“A clock sticker?” Kronii said as she looked down at herself, sipping her bubble tea as she did so. “Are you kidding me...?” 
The Warden of Time sighed deeply. Now she had little Kronies swimming inside her uterus. 
What the hell...

TAKE 12
“Director, you gotta do something, man,” G-San pleaded with the camera. “H-San’s in terrible danger here...”
Just behind him, Ina continued her rhythmic movements atop H-San’s spent body. Sweat, tears, and cum had gathered around her thighs while they were still connected. He had cum inside her seven times already, but the eldritch being still demanded more seed.
“Hey...” Ina whispered seductively into H-San’s ear as she skillfully rode his dick. “Come on... just cum one more time.”
H-San the “Takodachi”, almost lifeless by now, could only whimper helplessly. “Aaaaahhh...”
“Director! You need to fucking do something!” G-San shouted frantically. “Please!
“I’m thinking, goddamnit!” Taro yelled back over the intercom. “Shit! What can we fucking do?!”
Back at the main control room, Q-San tapped the director’s shoulder and showed him what looked like a taser gun - one that shot electric needles. “Maybe we can use this?” he asked. 
Taro couldn’t believe his eyes. “I-Isn’t that a little bit too extreme?”
“Well, then what do you suggest we do, huh?” Q-San challenged him. “Let her suck all the damn life outta that poor fella?”
Taro mulled it over for a moment. There was indeed someone’s life at stake here - it was imperative to save them no matter what!
“Okay,” he eventually said. “Do it.”
With a nod from Taro, Q-San held his gun and entered the room, where Ina was still whispering into H-San’s ear.
“You know, Future Ina says... you’re gonna have a lot of babies,” she said with relish.
“Over there! Aim it at her back!” G-San shouted frantically while pointing toward Ina’s location.
H-San couldn’t lift his head to see what was happening properly; he could only manage a weak groan in protest. “Wh-What are you guys doing...?”
Q-San aimed his X2 taser gun shakily at Ina’s back as instructed. But then he saw something strange - a dark haze began surrounding her body as he took aim.
Suddenly, despite the laws of anatomy, Ina turned her head around unnaturally fast in Q-San’s direction - causing him to almost drop his weapon in shock.
“You dare interrupt... me?” she growled angrily - her voice distorted in a way more befitting of a demon than a human.
“Holy shit! Shoot her! SHOOT HER!” G-San yelled in hysterics.
“Wait, you’re gonna shock me too--” H-San tried shouting out in protest, before being cut off... by a screaming Q-San who just pulled the trigger.
The needles of the X2 hit Ina in the shoulder, sending hundreds upon thousands of volts of into her body, the electricity spreading to all endings of her nerves.
Usually, a taser would cause severe pain and involuntary muscle contractions in its target. But, due to the particularities of how her body had been modified by the Ancient Ones, all Ina felt was a surge of utter pleasure. Even as her teeth clenched and drool began pouring out the sides of her mouth, all she could think about was how heavenly this all felt.
Unfortunately, the same could not be said for H-San. He had cum so many times already that his body was barely responding anymore.
When the battery had finally run out, Q-San and G-San cautiously approached the couple. Ina was laying on H-San, panting and sweating with this pleasant grin on her face. 
“I guess... we should pull her off?” Q-San suggested while looking at both figures on the table.
G-San nodded in reluctance, and both men flanked Ina, ready to pull her off H-San by her shoulders. 
But as they did so, H-San cried out in agony. “Aaaagh! D-Don’t pull her off!”
“What? What’s going on?” G-San asked, confused by what had just happened. 
“Sh-She’s stuck on me!” 
Apparently, due to the taser shock and the muscle contractions it caused, Ina had somehow clenched and locked herself on H-San’s dick.

TAKE 13
A-Chan sighed in relief. Finally! The shooting for this episode of HoloGra was done. Watson-san, Kronii-san, and Ina’nis-san were very easy to work with and (to A-Chan’s surprise) proved to be excellent actors! Sure, they still looked a bit different from how they did during their streams, but a little bit of CGI magic could fix that easily enough. 
“Well then, girls...” A-Chan started clapping her hands. “Shooting is done! Congratulations!” 
The Hololive JP talents cheered as their work for that afternoon was done. They could finally help themselves to some snacks, drinks, and maybe even look forward to a hotpot dinner later that night. 
However, A-Chan noticed that the EN talents were staring back at her with looks of confusion etched on their faces. Why did they look so perplexed when everything had already been wrapped up? 
So she asked in English, “Hi Watson-san, what seems to be the problem?”
Watson-san hesitated before answering. “Well... it seems we’ve wrapped up shooting for today,” she began before pausing. “But me and the girls have been wondering about something...”
“Hm?” A-Chan leaned closer, curious of what this was all about. “What is it that you’re wondering? Maybe I could help answer it.”
“It’s just that...” Watson-san fluttered her thick eyelashes flirtatiously. “We were just curious when we’ll start shootin’ the sex scenes.”
Those final two words made everyone look at Watson-san’s direction. 
“Pardun?” Pekora asked as she raised an eyebrow quizzically
“Sex scene...?” Sora whispered to herself with a tilt of her head while trying to understand its meaning.
“Sekusu... sheen...?” Miko held onto her chin as she tried to decipher what those words meant as well.
“Sex scene?” Marine exclaimed eagerly as her scarlet eye glittered in excitement.
“I-I’m sorry? Could you... could you repeat that, please?” A-Chan asked, hoping she just misheard what Watson-san said.
“You know... the sex scenes,” Watson said casually. “The fucking. I mean, shooting this scenario’s been nice and all, but I think it’s about time we get to the main event now.”
“A-Chan, if there was going to be a sex scene, then why didn’t you say so?” Marine asked as she began unbuttoning her red vest. 
“There’s no sex scene!” A-Chan exploded out of shock with what she was hearing. “Why would there be a sex scene in Holo no Graffiti?! There must’ve been a big mis...”
That was when A-Chan realized the truth.
“...take.”
The shooting for HoloGra was held at the Mori Building in Room 406. But just next to them was another room, Room 405, where another studio had their own shoots as well.
A-Chan knew that studio was shady, and even had her suspicions that they were shooting AVs there. Could it be that...?
Oh no.
“Excuse me for a moment, girls,” A-Chan said apologetically before leaving the room in haste. Just in front of their door was the door to Room 405. 
After taking a deep breath, A-Chan knocked three times on the door before a bespectacled production assistant answered. 
“Hello,” A-Chan introduced herself politely. “I’m from Cover Corp and we’re shooting next door right now. May I speak with your director?”
“Uhhh... we’re in the middle of a shoot right now, too, ma’am,” the PA replied nervously. “I don’t know if--”
“Please, it’ll only take a minute,” A-Chan insisted, running out of patience.
“Uh, I’m not sure if I should--”
Instead of waiting, A-Chan barged past the PA, walked past the studio lobby, and into the main set, where a man with circle-rimmed glasses sat with other PAs, surrounded by multiple TV monitors. He must've been the director of the shoot. 
“Hello there!” A-Chan greeted. “Are you the director?” 
Taro Kuronishi looked up in surprise before seeing this dainty-looking woman with glasses standing behind his monitors. “What-- who’s this?” he asked.
“I’m sorry, director,” Z-San said as he walked onto the set. “She just barged in here!”
“I just wanted to ask if you happened to see these girls,” A-Chan explained while pulling out her phone and showing Taro a picture of Amelia Watson, Ouro Kronii, and Ninomae Ina’nis.
Taro pushed his glasses up his nose as he looked at the picture, before glancing back at the video recordings of those same girls being fucked on his monitors. 
“Oh, these are our actresses,” Taro confirmed. “They’re currently working at the moment though, so what’s the matter?”
“The problem, sir...” A-Chan emphasized the word ‘sir’, her teeth clenched tightly in anger. “... is that these girls are actually talents of Hololive Production. And we may have been doing our own shoots with your actresses ins--”
Before A-Chan could finish her sentence, though, Kronii came out from one of the rooms, covered in nothing but a bathrobe. Seeing A-Chan, the Warden walked up to her. 
“Oh, hey, A-Chan, you’re finally here!” she said, looking like she wanted to ask her something. 
It only took one look at Kronii for the Hololive staffer to start sweating bullets. Mother of God, did Kronii... did Kronii participate in this shady shoot?!
“Kr-Kronii-san,” A-Chan stammered nervously. “Why are you dressed like that--”
“I wanted to ask something,” Kronii interrupted. “Does Cover offer maternity leave?”
A-Chan blinked in confusion. “...huh?”
“I think I’ll be taking a nine-month vacation, if you know what I mean,” Kronii elaborated further. “At the very least, does our HMO offer, you know... Plan B pills?”
“Um... Um...” A-Chan struggled to form coherent words as she began processing various possibilities of what might have just happened here. “I-I’ll have to ask...”
Kronii sighed heavily. “All right, all right. I’m gonna go back to the hotel... I need a shower.”
As Kronii walked away, two men with a stretcher exited the set as well, carrying what seemed to be Ina’nis-san... laying naked on top of another man. 
“Wh-What...?” A-Chan asked herself, feeling more and more uncertain about everything.
Then suddenly, from one of the other rooms, a naked man in a wrestling mask burst out of the door, shouting, “We’ve slain the beast!”
Seeing his long dick dangle between his legs, A-Chan yelped and covered her eyes. What the hell was going on here?! 
Taro meanwhile, unfazed due to his experience, stood up from his chair. “It’s done?”
“Yes, director,” F-San said, panting. “She’s... we’ve put her down... finally.”
“All right, then,” Taro said as he walked toward the door. “Let’s see the damage.”
Though afraid of what they would find, A-Chan followed him. 
Inside the room were three other naked men, collapsed on the floor while gasping for oxygen desperately. The air was heavy with the scent of bleach and other strange odors. 
At the center of it all was a table where a blond woman lying face down twitched and spasmed as streaks of semen burst out of her exposed pussy. 
A-Chan looked on in horror as the realization reared its ugly head. 
Was that Watson-san?!
“In the name of the Dharma...” Taro exclaimed, himself shaken by what he saw. “What did you guys do to her?”
“We...” F-San leaned back on one of the shelves. “We gave her everything we could...”
Unable to stand any longer himself, the masked man crumpled onto the floor. 
Suddenly, Ame’s body twitched violently, sending yet another shot of jizz up in the air... and onto A-Chan’s face.

EPILOGUE
“Battle for the Sandwich!” became the Hololive YouTube channel’s most-viewed HoloGra video, with over 7 million views.
Meanwhile, “Holo No Paizuri” became Crystal-Eizou’s top-selling JAV of the year. It even won at the Sky PerfecTV! Adult Broadcasting Awards for “Best Original Work”, “Best Parody,”, “Most DVDs/Blu-Rays Sold”, and “Best Director.” However, due to being under pseudonyms, all three leading actresses could not receive their individual awards for “Best Actress.”
Ouro Kronii went on to stream regularly in the following months before taking a sudden nine-month vacation for family reasons. To this day, there remains speculation on various social media platforms and image boards about what exactly spurred her long absence. 
In contrast, Ninomae Ina’nis had almost no interruptions in her streaming schedule. The gestation period only took a week.
As for Amelia Watson, she appeared to have lost all memory of what happened. During her travels to Japan, she would often wonder why men would give her curious looks - as if they all recognized her from somewhere. 
A-Chan took a well-deserved vacation in Maldives for three weeks.
Finally, Usada Pekora went on to host one of Hololive JP’s biggest RUST collabs titled “Hololive Ultimate Gang-bang!” involving all of the branch’s talents. The live stream broadcast reached over 500k viewers, while the VOD gained more than six million views in total. Pekora was suspended for three months afterwards.
