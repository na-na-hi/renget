# 3 Gun, the Retard's Guide

3 Gun is awesome. There are few hobbies that can get give you a way to shoot guns, improve yourself, socialize, and get exercise the way 3 Gun can. This is a guide to get you to your first match and have a good time. The more people in the shooting sports, the better a society we form. 3 Gun also has pretty big Instagram clout.

But, first things first.

## Don't get disqualified, dickhead.

Getting disqualified fucking sucks, especially if it's early. 3 Gun matches are typically far away and require a significant time investment. Getting DQ'd means it was all for nothing: your score doesn't count, you don't shoot anymore stages, and will mean you're going home if you don't already know someone there.

Here's how to keep from being disqualified: 
- When you get there, make sure you don't have any ammo in your firearms. Magazines can be loaded, just don't put them _in_ your guns. Some matches will allow you to pre-load your shotgun tube, but you're retarded. Don't do that.
- When it's your turn to shoot, there are 3 rules to remember:
  1. Mind the 180. Look left. Look right. Don't point your gun any further than that.
  2. Keep control of your firearms; one gun at a time, no guns on the ground.
  3. Reddit finger your gun the whole time you're moving; lots of moving and lots of shooting, don't do them at the same time. Yes, that means you.
- There is a 4th unspoken rule:
  4. If you are truly and irredeemably retarded, stay home. Guns are fucking dangerous; 3 gun is fun, but it's not a game. If you cannot control your firearms and present yourself well, you will be sent home. Save everyone the fucking trouble.

If you do these things and come with an "I need help" attitude, you'll be welcomed with open arms.

## Gear

Believe it or not, you can't just shove shit in your pockets. Below is what you will __need__. Any additional things can be brought given your budget. There are three paths you can go down for weapon classes that are generally supported by most match rules. What you decide will depend on your budget, retardedness, or whatever.

Different classes require different gear and have rules on what you can or can't have on your gun, so we'll talk about that first.

Classes tl;dr - 
1. Open (recommended for new shooters with no shotgun)
  - Rifle: you can have a bipod.
  - Pistol: you can have a red dot.
  - Shotgun: magazine fed. They are incredibly fast, but finicky if you don't have patience.
2. 2 Gun (most 3 gun matches DO NOT support this, but some do)
  - Rifle: depends, just ask
  - Pistol: depends
  - Shotgun: you don't need one. Don't shoot clays, probably shoot the shotgun-designated steel with your pistol.
3. TacOps (this is for peak retard, this is where most people who shoot a lot of 3 gun are)
  - Rifle: one optic (variable or red dot + magnifier)
  - Pistol: iron sights, no red dot
  - Shotgun: Tube-fed, no more than 8 rounds in the gun at the start

### Open

If you don't have a shotgun and your club/match doesn't support 2 gun, start here. Buy a Rock Island VR80 and either the 19 round stick magazine or 20+ round drum magazine and you will be good. VR80s are incredible and have proven themselves many times over. Many open shooters shoot these if they don't have more money than sense or haven't been shooting 3 gun a gajillion years. As for the other weapons, who cares. Bring what you got, open means there are no rules on what you can or can't have.

The only thing to worry about is that you are in with the "race" guys. Ignore them. Or talk to them, most of them are very nice. But they also have more money in their guns and gear than your net worth. Uncanny.

### 2 Gun

As mentioned in the tl;dr, many matches don't support this because running a 3 Gun match is hard enough. But most that do just say "don't shoot the clays, shoot everything else with your pistol". If you don't want to mess with a shotgun (reasonable) and they have the class available in practiscore, go for it. Just, like you would in the stages, ignore the sections about the shotgun.

Ask your match director or consult the rules on what is or isn't allowed. Every place does it differently. If there is a 2 Gun (open) or 2 Gun (limited), consult the above or below rules for the pistol/rifle rules respectively.

### Tac Ops

__This class is not recommended for beginners.__

This is where all the people who regularly shoot 3 Gun are. If you _really_ want to put shotgun shells down a shotgun tube under duress, then by all means, this is your class. A pump will do; if you _have_ to run a pump, make sure you can either hold 8 rounds in the tube or get ready for pain. If you have a semi-auto shotgun, cool. But I cannot stress enough: **having an 8 round tube is basically required to shoot in Tac Ops**. You _will_ have a bad time if you don't.

You also cannot run a red dot on your pistol. Some "outlaw" matches (Outlaw = "there are some rules we don't like, so we changed them" = "ask the match director, he'll give you the tl;dr or put you in open") that allow red dots on pistols in Tac Ops. Most do not.

In Tac Ops, you also cannot run back up or offset sights on your rifle. Also, no bipods, tripods, or shooting bags (advanced).

Now, on to the actual gear.

### Belt. You need one.

You need a sturdy belt because you'll be putting a lot of stuff on it. It doesn't have to be an expensive piece of equipment but should at least have a firm grasp on you, you gear and your pants. If your belt falls of with your pistol in it, that is an automatic DQ. On your belt you should have __AT LEAST__ the following:

-    Handgun holster.
-    Shotgun shell holders/bag (tube-fed) (Tac Ops)
-    Handgun mag holder x2
-    A Dump Pouch

Most of the time, you won't need a Rifle Magazine pouch. If you do, that's one of the things you can keep in a pocket without much affect.

If you are shooting a magazine fed shotgun (recommended), try and get the biggest, longest, drumiest magazine your shotgun will take. Reloading sucks, so try not to have to do it, and try not to have to have additional magazines on you. You can find carriers for most mag-fed magazines out there, or you can repurpose your dump pouch to hold an extra magazine.

AR and Pistol magazine pouches can be picked up pretty cheap at any surplus store. You can even get a combination rifle/handgun mag pouch off amazon for ~$50.

For the handgun holster I would suggest a good one for the same reason I suggest a sturdy belt. The gold-standard is Safariland, but they are pricey and require attachments. If you can float the ~$140 all-in, do that. Otherwise, any Kydex OWB holster that attaches to your belt will do, so long that it has __positive__ retention. You're looking for something with adjustable retention (screws visible) or a click-type attachment that wraps the trigger guard/rail.

Shotgun shell holders are relatively affordable and will speed up your time significantly if you're going down the Tac Ops path. A bag will work just as well but at the cost of time. Stock shell carriers are awful. Ignore them.

## Guns. Can't go boom without the boomstick.

- Rifle: Any AR will do.
 The Rifle is, strangely, the easiest thing to lock down. Almost every 3 Gun I'm aware of shoots out to no-greater-than 200 yards. Even if you shoot out to 500 yards (like my club), take my word for it: 90% of ARs out there can do it if you do your part. The hard part of shooting far is in the optic and your knowledge of it, __not__ the gun. Make sure your gun _is zeroed for your optic_ and you know your height over bore. A good zero will give you a good foundation on which to shoot well. 

- Handgun: Literally anything with capacity at or above 15.
With the proliferation of cheap double-stack 9mm handguns, you are spoiled for choice. If you already have something, make sure you have at least 3 magazines for it. If you don't Canik or Glock is the go-to entry-level competition guns. If you want to splash cash, any double-stack 1911 variant do very well (2011, Rock Island Tac Ultra FSHC, Springfield Prodigy DS, etc). If you don't shoot a lot of pistol, you will miss a lot, so if you have more magazines for it, toss one into the dump pouch before you start if you know there's a lot of pistol targets. 
If you have a red dot, use it. They are amazing. If you don't, don't worry. They're only a little bit better. 

- Shotgun: This is the complicated part. If you're doing 2 gun, skip this part.

  - Shotgun, Open: VR80. VR80. VR80. There is no other option that is reliable. 
    - Do not shoot anything lighter than 1200 FPS, 7 1/2 shot, 1oz loads (Heavy Target Load or equivalent). 
    - Bring a rounded-needle file to open up your gas port if your gun needs it. 
    - Magazines are relatively cheap; the 19s work wonders. 1 will typically do you for a local-match stage.

- Shotgun, Tac Ops, Cheapo mode: Remington 870 or Maverick 88. 
  870 rust memes aside, these guns have an important advantage over most mossbergs: their mag tubes are extendable. Getting an 870 with a +4/+5 tube will make your life possible, even if you have to save up for the extension. Otherwise, a Maverick 88 will do. You're in for pain, you already know it. I would recommend convincing your match director to add 2 Gun after he witnesses you fuck this match up (if you're good enough not to get DQ'd).

- Shotgun, Tac Ops, The Real Options in order of preference: Beretta 1301, Stoeger M3K with the extension (ideally, M3000 is ok), Beretta A300 Ultima Patrol, Mossberg 940 Pro (930 is ok). 
  These are match-proven semi-auto shotguns. If you are here, you probably don't need advice from me.

 ## Ammo. Feed the beast, don't break the targets.

Most matches will require 100 rounds of each ammo type (rifle, handgun, and shotgun). If you are shooting 2 gun, add 25%. If you're terrible/new at shooting, add another 10%

All ammo should be either COPPER full metal jacketed. Steel ammo will probably get you DQed.

Shotshells: Should be 2-3/4" low brass 7 shot. Shot MUST BE LEAD NOT STEEL. You can use high brass for longer range targets and a harder punch. Also have about 10 rifled slugs and 10 00 buck shot on hand incase the coarse calls for it thay day.

## General suggestions and closing thoughts

Read through the rules of the range and the match specific rules. The match rules will generally be some form of USPSA Multi-gun or some 3-Gun Nation / UML ruleset with minor tweaks.

Don't get DQ'd, retard. But if you do, don't work yourself up too much. Everyone I know has been DQ'd in some stupid and embarrassing way.

For your first matches, don't try to be fast. Try to be smooth and engage all targets with no penalties. The speed will come. There is a saying in 3 gun that goes like this:
- Missing is slow, going fast is slow, going slow and not missing is fast.

At the end of the day, 3 Gun is an awesome hobby and I've met loads of folks I'd call friends as a result. Stick with it, have a good time, and use it as an opportunity to improve yourself and keep what you care about safe.
