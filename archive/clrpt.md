#Lion Taming! 
#A Tsundevil's Mind

Rurudo-mama, I'm home! I brought all the groceries you wanted, and the perfume you picked.  

You didn't pick it? But...oh! Yes mama, I get it now.

I'd love to eat together and play some Daifugo, really! But I have a stream scheduled, you know? Can't let my Kenzoku down!

I know you need three players, mama. I'm sorry, but you can have a nice evening anyway, can't you?

Door closed, finally safe. Let's do this – phone there, Apex, OBS...go online, start the intro...deep breath...GO! Konyappi, dear Kenzoku! Oh, so many are here even for a guerilla stream. With all the loyal Kenzoku Towa is never alone, mama! No matter what you say. I don't even care how I'll do in Apex, I just want to play and- oi! Who typed that message about streaming extra for cigarette money‽ Oh well, it's just a joke right? Let's all have fun together!

.....Ugh.....what time is it? Dark outside, and the phone says...01:24. Why did I wake –  oh, it's noisy over there. Why must you be so loud, mama? And can't we get you a less creaky bed? Towa needs her idol sleep! And how can a little lion make such noise, anyway? Why are your screams so strong, and the walls so weak? 
I would never bring a man over and risk alerting you like this. I don't do even do it with myself anymore...hmm, but now that its so loud on your side I could. I want bliss like you are feeling now, mama. You have him doing all the work and I just have my fingers...uwah! Cold, devilish fingers. 
Ah, but they still know their place...maybe I will get a nice dream inspired by my fingers and my fantasy after this, too. It's fun to fall asleep like this, after all –  like I always did before I knew about the thin walls that are so weak to your lion ears, mama.
I wonder how it must be to have someone else enter in? You sound like you enjoy his efforts, and the loud slapping...is it going all the way? Maybe I will find a man to make me happy and loud like you one day, mama. A big strong man like yours...no, no! Not one like yours, not a big mean man. That is just good for my fantasy.  In reality a nice small man is best, a man that does what I say! 
No big strong man that lifts me by my waist and puts me on the table and pulls down my pants and slaps my butt and grabs my purple ponytails and takes me as hard as he wants to and makes me scream like you, mama...fantasies feel good, but they make for bad realities. Isn't that what you taught your daughter? Oh...ahh...OHHH! You were right that they feel good, at least!

Miso soup, salmon, rice...okay, that's everything! Rurudo-mama, breakfast is ready! I hope you will like the breakfast I prepared for us two now that he has left and it's just you and your daughter, like it used t- MAMA??? Why are you wearing that for breakfast???

No, you're not his...pet! Can't you use that collar only in your bedroom? It's embarrassing!

E-even if he commanded you to and you like it this way, isn't it ng? You told me to not let my fantasies get in the way of common sense! You can't just be his pet, mama! You're not a playful young girl, you're an old independent woman! Oops, I said old and didn't just think it! Ehm, I mean mature. Mature! 
Anyway, you can't just let him command you like this, mama! What if he is using you? Manipulating you? It's easy to get taken advantage of by such a big...handsome...charming man!

Why are you giggling, mama? It's nothing! I just stumbled over my words because you shocked me, you know?  

EHH? Don't tease me like that! Disgusting! Let's eat breakfast already.

That's the right side done, now the left...let's start with the teeth in the back before I forget. It's important to care for one's teeth after all, so –  hm? The front door, who is coming now? We didn't order any packages, right? Is he visiting you again just after breakfast, mama? Is he checking whether you have been wearing your collar like a good – wah, go away bad thought! And he should go away, too! Oh, but he isn't...

Please wait, the bathroom is occupied. Small and occupied, so please do not just...oi, close the door! There's no space at the sink for hand washing as long as I'm here. Be courteous and wait outside until Towa is finished!

Standing behind me and reaching around because I'm so small? Oh no, that's not good at all! Well, it's not like I can stop it but he should listen to the wishes of his pe- partner's daughter!!! This our home! And my armpits aren't a place to put arms through! And isn't there more space? Does he have to stand so close? Well, I won't speak to him anymore. Towa is busy with her brushing so she can't talk! Sorry! 

Why are you risking to listen to a man who behaves badly and is so...dangerous, mama? Do you like him just coming in here and flir- ehm, harrassing me‽ What a collosal dick, pressing against my back like that! Oh no, I meant prick! OH NO, I meant...uwaahh!!!
