Can't sleep by anon

>Your eyes are closed, your face burying into his fluffy, warm chest.
>"Anon, come on..." he groans.
>He shifts up and moves the blankets with him.
>Now you're under covers with your neck at an awkward angle, but your face is buried in his soft stomach.
>You wrap your arms around his torso and nuzzle into him again.
>"Anon!" he says again and pushes you over.
>You get a glance at the alarm clock: it's just after 4 AM.
>"What?" you ask, lazily turning back around into his warm embrace.
>"I can't sleep."
>"Do you want some help with tha--"
>"I mean you keep nuzzling into me, so I can't fall asleep. A- A- And it's making me nervous."
>That wakes you up a little. You look at the cheetah next to you.
>He's lying on his back, gripping the top of the blanket; you're on your side, head supported by hand, looking at him.
>You sigh and lower yourself to kiss him on the cheek.
>"Hey, sorry. I didn't mean to do that."
>You caress him on the other cheek. Even in the darkness you can see him smile subconsciously.
>"I mean, I like being with you, Anon. Like, naked in bed too. But it feels weird too, you know?" he babbles, his grip relaxing.
>"Yeah, I get it," you nod and ask, "Would it help if I didn't push on you that much? Like," you pause, "if we tried cuddling together or something?"
>"O- Okay, maybe like face to face?" he proposes.
>You shuffle around for a second until you tangle yourselves into an embrace with your chests and foreheads together.
>There's more struggling as you try to find a comfortable position together.
>Your arm gets squished underneath his chest.
>Then there's the issue of how to lay your heads next to each other without excessively bumping into each other's nose and snout.
>You don't realise how hard you are until your manhood accidentally bumps into his.
>He freezes.
>He makes a clear throating noise.
>You probably should say something.
>"I, uh, sorry about that."
>"Was it like this the whole time?"
>No point in lying:
>"...Yes."
>There's a brief moment of awkward silence, even though you're not sure why â€“ you've already jerked each other off before.
>"It's not something I can do much about," you begin to explain, now being the one who's getting nervous.
>WHY? It might just be the second time you're in bed together, but he sure knows how biology works.
>You try to form another sentence. You give the fluffball a look. He doesn't look shocked, just unsure again.
>You sense him sliding down his hand down his crotch underneath the blanket, as if to scratch himself there.
>Oh, you know it. He's definitely horny too.
>As if there was any debate about either of you not being horny when lying next to each other in bed while naked.
>"Okay, what if we..." you try not to blurt out something crude, "do the thing together?"
>He looks at you and nods, "Alright."
>"Let's take it slow, alright? No touching with my hand on it and around unless it's alright, alright?"
>"Right."
>You roll onto your sides again, facing each other, and go for the embrace again, this time not minding a bit of discomfort since you're not trying to fall asleep.
>Both of you shiver a little during the initial touch.
>You find his hand and grab it. You squeeze it gently.
>You go for the kiss, though it's a bit of a sloppy affair. You mostly get licked on the lips, and once the cheetah's tongue flicks yours, he immediately pulls it back.
>You caress him under the chin, then on the neck, with your free hand. He's so soft.
>You feel sharp claws and squishy paw pads running on your bare chest tentatively, unsuredly.
>Your dicks touch as you go deeper into the embrace.
>You feel it shudder against yours.
>You try to move away a little, "Sorry, I didn--"
>"It's alright."
>Moments later, your hands are already at each other's underbellies.
>You continue the kiss despite not knowing what you're doing.
>You buck against him slightly, rubbing your dicks together.
>The squishy, rubbery spikes at his base rub you comfortably.
>He exhales into your mouth.
>Suddenly, he breaks the kiss.
>"Holdonholdonholdon, I'm not sure."
>You stop and move away from the frottage. You kiss him and ask him in a whisper,
>"If you want to pause or something, it's fi--"
>"Nononono, I mean I just don't know--," he fidgets around nervously, throwing the blanket away, "Yeah, I need to-- we need to cut the shit."
>Huh?
>You see him rubbing his body: stomach, hips, crotch too.
>"Like, I'll go insane if we don't do it."
>"So, let's justs do it, okay?"
>"Y- Yes."
>You pull the blanket over both of you again and almost jump into the embrace again.
>You reach with your hand and slide with your fingers along his shaft. He twitches from the touch.
>Then you feel the same, his warm hand patting around your crotch before grabbing your dick.
>He starts to clumsily move his hands up and down, beginning to jerk you off.
>You don't wait and reciprocate.
>With your free hand you pull yourself closer to him.
>He leans his face into your shoulder.
>You nuzzle yours into his fluffy neck, huffing into the soft fur.
>"Ano-- Anon"
>Did he just moan your name?
>You can't help yourself but do the same.
>It takes just a moment before you're both close to release, both moaning and whining into each other's necks.
>He comes first, huffing and gasping as you keep jerking him.
>His uncontrolled, rough, twitchy movements send you over the edge too.
>Your toes curl as you lose the idea of space and time for a second.
>Sticky, warm wetness on your chest dripping down onto the bed slowly rouses you from the bliss.
>You find yourself exhaling sharply into the cheetah's chest.
>He's cuddled up, his chin stabbing your scalp.
>"You alright?" you ask.
>"I-- Y-yeah, I think so," he responds, exhaling in-between words.
>"Still nervous?"
>He giggles. "A little, yeah. Is better, though."
>You smile. Rowsiness starts overtaking you.
>Ah fuck, what about the mess?
>The first time, you at least had the foresight of bringing in a towel.
>Maybe that made it awkward, though.
>With a groan you get up and grab a pair of clean towels from the wardrobe.
>You throw yourself in the bed while wiping yourself off. You give the other one to him.
>You try to scrape and rub the messy sheets.
>They might not stain much now, but damn are they still wet.
>Throwing the dirty towels on the ground before the work wakes you up too much, you throw the blanket on you again.
>You cuddle. He lies on top of you and wraps his arms and legs around you.
>You rest your hands on his lower back, almost grabbing on to his rump for him to not fall off you.
>You smirk when your flaccid shafts bump against each other. It makes him giggle again.
>"We better do this again soon, Anon. Like, in the morning-kinda soon," the cheetah purrs in your ear.
>You glance at the alarm clock.
>4:23
>God damn it.
>Sleep takes you, made faster by your tiredness, the flood of feel good hormones, and the warm fluffiness pressing against you.
>You wake up in the morning.
>Well, you're woken up by the alarm clock at 8 AM.
>Tired. As. Fuck.
>You don't want to move.
>Lazily check your phone, wanting to prolong the inevitable of having to clean up, get something to eat, and go to work.
>GOVT. ALERT:
>Due to sudden uptick in Bovid-69, every outside activity is strictly prohibited. Stay at home. If you show signs of mooing as a non-cattle resident, call your nearest health station. Do not leave your homes.
>How convenient.
>You sleep in until noon when you finally get out of bed.
>The only thing you do is heat up milk to make instant cocoa, then back to bed to cuddle.
