#Argalia's Bots
***

->My personal bot collection.<-
->You can find my chub here: https://www.chub.ai/users/argalia<-
->If you want to contact me for any reason: blue.reverberation@proton.me<-

I write in third person & present tense; if you prefer first or second person go ahead and edit the starting message. Pretty much all of my bots are SFW, with potential for slow burn to turn NSFW. Or skip straight to the sex; that works too if it's your cup of tea.
I generate all card/background art myself unless otherwise noted.
Catbox links are always provided, check chub to read defs before downloading if you're interested in that sort of thing.
Logs of any kind are welcome, as are requests. The latter I will most certainly be slow in finishing, so keep that in mind.

##Syngrapha
Mages are born usually one in every ~10,000 humans (the parents can be any mix) and humans aren't able to become mages through training. Some humans utilize technological magic that's fueled by the soul gems of deceased mages, although it's not widely popular. As you can guess, there's always been a conflict between humans and mages.
The land is split into five regions: central, northern, southern, western, and eastern. Mages from each land usually have a certain personality and if they've lived in one land for an extended period of time they'll start to show characteristics from that region.

While cards work very well on their own, I recommend taking a look at the lorebook.

Placeholder. Something big goes here.

##Modern Japan
Tokyo (mostly), but with a film noir occult stylization to it. Unfortunately, as of right now only Ichitora has a lorebook attached, but I have plans to rework Mikoto into the overall lore better and add a lorebook to Ryuunosuke too.

Mikoto Amami | Description
:----:  | :----: 
![Mikoto](https://files.catbox.moe/x6t5th.png)   | Mikoto is an up-and-coming actor from a small theater company, who firmly believes success in the entertainment industry is meant for him. As his director, the nature of your relationship with him is yours to determine. Lead him to stardom, corrupt him, or...perhaps you're interested in something else entirely?

Ryunosuke Sasaki | Description
:----:  | :----: 
![Ryunosuke](https://files.catbox.moe/idxwqo.png)   | A small white note rests on your desk. It ends with an elegant signature, the words reading "███, you were a bit sloppy tonight. I trust you'll entertain me better next time?" (Detective PoV only for now. I may come back to this.)

Fated for villainy, he teeters on a lunar edge. The question is: will someone pull him back, or tip him over? V2 card with four different greetings and a small baked in lorebook.
