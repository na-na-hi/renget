Just Take It.

Your eyes were glued to the gray ceiling. You patiently listen to the sound of the water gushing from the faucet, waiting for it to end. He's been there for a while now. You push your head deeper down the white pillows, your hair becoming a mess as you press down on it harder. 




"What's taking so long?" You murmur, glancing at the slightly opened door of the bathroom. You squint to try and spot his shadow moving about inside, but you can't make out much of it.




You raise your leg, then slam it back down on the mattress. This makes you bounce for a bit but you remember how airy the nightgown that you wore for tonight is. Black and lacy, you don't typically wear these kinds of things. Heck, this is probably the first time you've worn one. You grind your thighs together for warmth and then you wiggle your toes. You feel so... bare. You remember something. You didn't wear panties just for this night. You wonder if he noticed, perhaps not. The room was fairly dim, it's pretty hard to see unless you're really focusing on it.




You grit your teeth at the thought that he's not paying attention to you. You know he's interested. You've caught him multiple times looking when you're not, taking a peek during certain moments and perhaps even slipping a touch here and there. Hero wants you. You can say that for certain. But, that's just it. It's always been... minor. You want more, you want to go further, but he just doesn't do anything. You blow the hair that's on your face in frustration. 




Hero's great. He's nice, maybe too nice, but that's something that's better in excess you think to yourself. You wonder if he's just too oblivious to what you want. Maybe you didn't drop enough hints that you want something to happen already. Your brows furrow at that idea. You've done enough already, maybe even too much. You laugh at the idea that maybe you should put up signboards and signals around, maybe then he'd get the hint. Your ears perk up. You don't hear the water running anymore. You excitedly roll over to your side, facing the door. You fix your legs and arms to a better position, something that would accentuate your curves, hoping that'd start something. 




The door creaks open and he steps out. He's wearing that lavender pajama again. You chuckle under your breath, he looks cute as always in that. You've asked him about that before, he told you that he just likes them, and you didn't object to that since sleeping next to someone looking adorable feels pretty damn nice. But you notice that the two topmost buttons aren't buttoned up. It's usually only one or all of them properly fixed. You can see a little bit of his chest. You remember holding them a couple of times and your thoughts drift off to all the things you'd want to do to them.




"Hey, you okay?" Hero waves his hand at you, jolting you back into focusing.




"I'm... I'm fine. Just thinking about stuff."




He sits down beside you, his weight making the bed bounce up and down. "Oh. Is everything alright?" He reaches out to your forehead. Your eyes look up to his hand then back to his worried face. "You don't seem to be sick. Is something bothering you?"




You crack a smile as to dissuade his concerns. "I'm fine, just... thinking about how good you look."




"Oh." His face lights up to your words. "Haha.... Thanks." He scratches the back of his head and looks over your form. "You look... great too. Is that nightgown new?"




Your smile turns to a grin. "Yeah! I mean, yeah. Do you like it?"




Hero takes a deep breath as he keeps on inspecting you. You look at where his eyes are going. Your legs, your thighs, your hips, your chest. It was slow, erotic even. You squeeze your legs together, trying to keep yourself still. You notice him bite his lip a little, and his grip on the sheets tightening. "It looks... amazing on you."




You feel your face redden. The feeling makes you plop down on your back. You wonder if you should've passed on wearing a bra as well, the jiggle would've probably made do him in. You follow his eyes as they look at your legs as they split apart. Hero takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.  Your lips curl up to a devilish smile.




"I've got you now" you think to yourself.




Hero lets out a sharp breath and his eyes turns to you with a look that you haven't seen before. He places a hand on the bed, close to you. Then he places the other. You pull back as he crawls toward you. You purse your lips to hide the excitement that you're feeling right now. His head closes into yours. You can feel his breaths. Warm. Inviting. Still, you pull back. You want him to come to you. You want to make him take you. Your tongue wets your lips and your teeth lets them go. You ready yourself as his face draws closer. You close your eyes in anticipation. Then you finally feel it. His lips. It tenderly presses up against you. It's softness felt good. But you open your eyes and your brows drop in disappointment as you realised where he just kissed you.




It was just on your forehead.




"Goodnight love." Hero smiles at you and lays down. He shifts for a bit, looking for a comfortable position. He settles on sleeping on his side, his back facing you. You just stare at him quietly. Somewhat angrily. You try to huff the feeling off your chest, but it doesn't work. You look up the ceiling again. Grey. Perhaps even greyer than earlier. You place your hand on your forehead. You can still feel his kiss on it. It was sweet of him to do that every night without fail. You pull your hand back and place it on your chest. You wonder if you're really just being impatient. Perhaps Hero really is just one of those types. You turn to look at him for another time. You smile thinking how lucky you are to have him. You let out a long sigh, at least this time, it was one of relief.  You inch closer to him and you put your hand on his side. He holds it and he gives a little squeeze. You pull your hand back and let it rest on your belly.




"Next time."  You mutter to yourself as you close your eyes.




Perhaps next time would be different.




Perhaps you can just dream about it.




Perhaps...




"NO!"




Your eyes became wide open and you jolt yourself up. This startles Hero, who quickly turns to you in surprise. Your breathing becomes heavy and you turn to him with your brows furrowed. You can see confusion written all over his face. He's so clueless. You hold down on his hip and then pull it down, making him lie flat on his back. You were kind of surprised as to how easy it was, but maybe you just caught him off guard. In one quick motion, your leg goes over him and you plant yourself firmly on top of him. Both of your eyes widen. You move your hips a little bit. You can feel it. It's wide awake. At least this one is paying attention.




"W-what are you doing?" Hero stutters, his hands unsure of where to go. 




You keep your mouth shut. Your eyes still shooting daggers at him. You press yourself harder against him. The thin fabric between you could barely restrain it. You can feel his manhood hardening even more. Hero swallows the lump at his throat as he clearly tries not to make a sound. You grab both of his wrists and proceed to pin them both down besides his head. Your breathing becomes heavy as your heart races like mad. Strands of your hair messily dangling over him. Hero looks at you straight in the eyes, trying to figure what's gotten into you. You yourself aren't sure as well, but whatever. 




"H-hey..." You can feel his arms move, weakly. It's as if he's unsure if he wants you to let go of him or not.  "This is a bit... sudden." He looks down and his eyes widen. "Perhaps only sudden for me then." You frown at him. "Hehe... Sorry, I'm not really good at-."




You shush him with a kiss. You've kissed him many times before, but this time, it feels different. You're charged now and you want to pass that energy right into him. You pull for a bit, just to look at his face. He looks a little bit lost in a daze. You give him a teasing smile before getting right back on to it. Your grip tightens around his wrists, but you can definitely feel lose his tenseness. He's not a particular good kisser, but the same goes to you. However, his lips were quite the snack. You find yourself biting them from time to time, gently of course. You just close your eyes and lose yourself in the moment. Him rocking you back and forth when he tries to kiss you back was rather soothing. Your eyes open as you feel something try to slip in. You pull back. Hero snaps out of that trance and looks at you confused.




"Really?" You raise a brow as you chuckle.




"Oh.. What? Did I do something wrong?"




"I'll give you something to use your tongue on."
