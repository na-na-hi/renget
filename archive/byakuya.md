BYI / [back](https://rentry.co/byakuyatogami)

-> my mood fluctuates often and i can get irritated easily, which can affect how i interact with others. i normally prefer to be left alone and will sometimes leave you on read. I am very forgetful and easily distracted. I am not an extremely critical person, but i will not defend obviously terrible things in medias i enjoy <- 

-> i am very unserious and almost everything i say is a joke (i will tell you if im serious or not & i dont use tone tags if im joking). Im indifferent about most online drama or topics, and find it hard to express care for certain subjects; this is not always a good thing and i am self aware of that , so i am working on it <-

-> i heavily dislike the topic of weight, diets, or EDs, descriptive or not, so id prefer it not be mentioned around me at all, thank you <-

-> im really protective when it comes to byakuya togamiðŸ˜…i promise i am not crazy perhaps a little eccentric but he does love me Okay anyway<-
