Rika stared through the smoke and dirty snow as the last of the Pawnbots fell in pieces from her blade. She couldn't see the sun through the thick clouds overhead, the only light here was artificial and cold, but her fur warded off the air's chill. The ice running through her veins came purely from within, from the gut-wrenching sight of the person stepping out of the blast door of the facility she was trying to raid. It was like looking into a funhouse mirror at a fairground, but this wasn't very funny.

In hindsight, it should have been obvious that Eggma'am wasn't the only twisted copy around. She just had to wonder what she'd done to deserve facing herself like this. Maintaining a cocky smirk, she rested her blade against her shoulder and tucked her free hand beneath her elbow, feigning relaxation. Her clone held a sword of similar scale but very different style at the balance point in one hand, and as he came to a stop he rested it like a walking stick, tip stabbing into the metal deck.

"Be straight-edged with me." Rika barked at the stranger she recognized too easily. "Your name some weird twist on Rika?"

"Rikan." He answered. "That settles it, then. I didn't expect you to exist."

"I figured you'd be dead on your side of things."

"It came close a few times."

They stared at each other in mutual appraisal for a moment; the only sounds were the sparks of dead robots, the howl of the wind, and the muted crash of waves around the pylons holding the facility over the water. Rikan's red coat didn't even need the logo to be a clear indication of loyalty. Simlarly, Rika was standing ankle-deep in scrap metal. Their allegiances were at odds, and that could only mean one thing from here on.

"You've made a lot of bad decisions." She spat, nudging her chin towards the red jacket and the building he'd come out of.

"Yours aren't much better." He indicated the area they were standing in with a wave of his hand.

"I'm still free."

"Only for a few more moments. Then you'll be dead."

The fight began in a blur, the two sword-slingers clashing their blades in a test of raw strength. She found herself lacking.

"Formal training and endless practice against robots." He grinned as he answered the unspoken question, forcing Rika back with a two-handed shove and a step forwards. "Plus a weapon that wasn't pulled out of a blacksmith's cheapest barrel."

Rika took three quick steps back, drawing into her true fighting stance, Ox guard at the ready, the blade hovering by her head and ready to strike out in all directions. She'd taken what she could get: weapon, training, and practical opponents all. That hadn't included a lot of other people using swords. She could count the number of people she'd clashed blades with on half a hand. One was her half-brother, the other was the teacher she'd briefly learned from, and this would be the third.

All of that came through her mind in the instants she had before Rikan lunged forwards with a stab. She side-stepped it, looking to shove the blade down, but he took that thrust and twisted it into a slash for her ribs. This time she got her own weapon up to push at it, but he had two hands against her one, and the weakened blow pushed her back again. Trying not to lose more momentum, she closed the gap and grabbed for her Alter's shoulder. He slipped away with grace and put her in the optimal striking range of his sword again. Every time she attempted to get through his guard, he would either backstep or push; and then he could retaliate. Their dance was a cacophony of metal crashes, the bells of battle ringing so hard and so often that Rika's ears folded back on her head. 

It was clear that she was outmatched, but if she ran from herself like this, from her Alter? She wouldn't be able to look at the world with pride ever again. Better to die brave and free than run with her tail between her legs. He might not even let her escape anyways. She certainly wouldn't. If he turned to run, he'd find a blade slipping through his ribs. That didn't seem likely right now, though, and she shoved those ideas aside to focus on the weapon bearing on her from below once more. That low slash was poised to sheer through her calves and leave her defenseless on the ground, so she jumped over it and cleared the sheet of steel. 

The moment of landing gave her Alter enough time to spin with the full momentum of his blade rather than arrest it, coming right back around to cleave for her neck. She ducked low, bringing her sword in a slash for his midsection, but he used the pommel of his weapon to deflect it with a sharp downward motion. The cut missed by hair's breadths.

Neither of them spoke as they clashed, all their efforts focused on staying alive. Even with Rikan's superior skills and physique, they were close enough that too many mistakes would lead to downfall. At least, that's what Rika thought, until she realized she'd been slowly backed towards the edge of the platform. There was nowhere left to run. He'd managed to look like he was struggling all while controlling the fight in its entirety. 

The moment he paused, the moment he aimed to push her off into the sea, she lunged forwards and dove between his legs. He tried to stab down, but desperation lent Rika speed that her twisted clone could not match with his longer weapon. She rose in one fluid motion, pivoted on her heel, and kicked him in the back.

Rikan went sailing into the waves, but it wasn't a true kill. The shark-shaped robots below wouldn't rip HIM to shreds. If anything they'd carry him back to dry ground. 

Still, she counted it as a victory, and darted towards the blast doors he'd come out of. If she was fast, she could ruin this place before he or another serious threat came out of the wetwork again.
