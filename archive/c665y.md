#Cuddles Before Bed

>Roaring winds along with heavy snow covering the streets inch by inch. Anon buckled down head to toe with large, winter clothes. 
>He enters the house quickly and shuts the door. He takes a deep breath and starts taking off his snow-covered brown coat. He enters the living room to see his soulmate sitting by the fireplace. 
>She turns around, her pink hair matched the flames too well. She smiles and gets up to walk towards her beloved.
>”Blizzard was that bad, huh?” 
>”Yeah, but knowing what was waiting for me back home gave me enough juice to make it back.”
>Aubrey chuckled as she kissed the Anon on the cheek. They cuddled near the fire while drinking hot cocoa. 
>Time passes by and it was already night, they both wore their sweatpants and long-sleeve shirts. 
>Under the sheets they cuddled next to each other, leg wrapped around leg and arms holding onto each other’s backs. 
>The warmth, the soft touch of skin and the beautiful rhythm of one another’s breath.
>Anon opens his eyes to see a sleeping Aubrey, already absorbed by the warmth of her lover.
>Anon smiles and closes his eyes.
>Everyday was a hard day, getting up and going to the outside world was scary enough.
>But as long as she was home, waiting….
>Maybe one more painful day outside wouldn’t hurt. After all,
>I had her by my side.
