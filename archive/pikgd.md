Somno fic desires... rising...

It's a rare moment when you're awake before he is, and you figure you'll surprise him. Get the drop on a mafia boss, share a few laughs and tease him. You rush a morning shower, humming softly, feeling light and airy as you dash through your morning routine. You're careful, but not flawless.

Doesn't seem to matter, because Luca's still out like a light, the light of the sun beaming on his sweet angel face. And his body, tattooed and scarred and made for sin.

Not careful but still flawless.

Your footsteps feel so heavy as you approach the bed again, this time warm and wrapped with only a towel. Water still clings to you in places as you crawl next to him, eyes traveling over his sleeping form. If you were good, you would let the man rest.

Your shaking fingertips skim over his chest, getting a soft exhale from him when they brush against his nipples. You could wake him up that way, teasing much more potent than words allowed for.

Simmering on the idea for the moment, you decide to keep going. Besides your growing lust, there's no sense of urgency, and like this you can stare shamelessly. Touch even more so.

No part of him was safe from you. The backs of his knees, his knuckles, the lightness of the touches and kisses driving you crazy, the occasional groan from him making you lightheaded. Had the shower been too hot?

You tug insistently at his boxers, exposing him, watching him harden with a grin that spread across your face that was nearly evil. Your mouth was sweet to him though, hot and wet, your flickering tongue a perfect wakeup call. His eyes flutter open, and you shake your head before he utters a word.

"You're only dreaming..."
