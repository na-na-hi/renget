Comment: “Ranis Athrys, the steward of the Balmora Mage's Guild. She's an ice queen with a tragic past. Her pragmatic outlook and callous nature made her into an effective authority figure at the Mage's Guild in Morrowind, but it hasn't made her any friends. Beneath her hard exterior, she wants to open up to someone. Could it be you?”
