Wheelchair Devil 2

>Today the gang's going to have their traditional picnic at the Faraway lake
>Sunny's finishing to pretty up Mari, much to his annoyance.
>He hates doing it since Mari uses the situation to berate him, and he knows that she can make a scene out of it if he denies to "help" her
>And of course, the fact that today he's doing it with crushed fingers (>>325569714) definitely doesn't help
>But the pain of having his bones broken is nothing compared to the humiliation she made him go through when she sucked him off like a nympho
>Just remembering the pain, the shame, the burning hatred, the skilled tongue, the luscious gaze...ops, Sunny got lost in his thoughts.
>What's really important is that cripple has to suffer, and now it's finally revenge time on the Wheelchair Devil
>As he finishes putting lipstick on his sister lips, a devious smile crepts across his face.
>"Hey sis, I have a surprise for you"
>He immediately takes something from his pocket, and shows it to Mari
>She always tries her best to have the upper hand in any situations regarding her brother, and being impassive with an aura of smug superiority became her trademark when dealing with Sunny
>Except today.
>Mari couldn't maintain a straight face even if her life depended on it
>Because today, in his hand
>Sunny was holding a love egg

>Sunny cursed himself for not having Basil's camera, because Mari's expression was definitely worthy of, at least, a full album. Priceless, simply priceless
>"Don't you fucking dare you-"
>Before she could even finish her cursing, with uncanny speed and precision born from hours of training with THE MAVERICK, the egg is already in place inside her
>"You must be really hating yourself now for making me dress you up everyday huh? Pulling down your disgusting panties is like a second nature to me now"
>"Sunny, I swear I'll scream right now and when Dad and Mom come here, not even a Combo Meal-"
>"Scream? What you're gonna say? 'Help, mommy, daddy, Sunny put a sex toy in my pussy!' They'll send you to a mental hospital. I'm all for it though, I heard ECT does wonders to a fucked up brain like yours"
>With a fury only known in the very depths of the Fifth Circle, Sunny sees Mari killing him with his eyes, face red with pure, conformed rage.
>He was extra careful in her makeup today, just for this moment.
>Her dolled up face face contorted in anger
>That evil, abusive, beautiful face
>God how he dreamed in seeing that face.
>"Don't be so angry, sis. I'm only doing this because I know you love to be with Hero in our picnics. But I think you're not giving him enough attention, since you're so focused in making my life miserable. So think of me as a cupid, helping you strength your bond"
>"You useless asswi---hhnnnng!!" Mari couldn't finish, waves of pleasure making her hands grip the hand rest as if she was trying to tear it off completely
>"Well, it does work at least. Guess it's true what they say abou cripple sensibility."

>"Now sis, I don't want to make you cum hard in front of everyone, specially Hero, so today you're going to be very nice to me. Because if if you don't..." Sunny reaches closer to Mari and whispers in her ear "...I'm going to tell Kel that I found this strange controller on the grass."
>"And you know how curious he is to such things, right? Being all touchy with everyhting... maybe he'll push the buttons too hard? Like this?"
>"HHHHHHHHHHHHNNNG Y-YOU PIECE OF SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT"
>Sunny stops the egg, and take some time to appreciate the view of Mari trembling, her vision blurred and searching for breath. It's a miracle her makeup didn't became a mess after that.
>"I'm becoming pretty good at this" Sunny told Mari. He takes her hand mirror and puts it in front of her.
>"See, your makeup still intact even after you acted like a bitch in heat. Still beautiful"
>"Anyway, it's fun to see you go crazy, but we must not let our friends wait. Time to go"
>Sunny takes control of the wheelchair and leaves the room with Mari, but not before waving the controller victoriously at her face
>"And remember: be nice!"
>Mari was completely livid with anger. But that angry was not directed at Sunny. The truth is, she was angry, very angry with herself.
>Of course Mari hated Sunny more than anyone else in the world.
>Sunny is the piece of shit that put her in a wheelchair forever
>Sunny is the one that ruined her life
>That changed their group of friends forever
>So then why
>FUCKING WHY
>When she looked at herself to see if her makeup was still intact
>When Sunny told her she was "still beautiful"
>In the exact moment he wasn't looking, too self absorbed in his victory
>She saw herself biting her lips so hard?
